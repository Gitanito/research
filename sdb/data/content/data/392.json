In\r\nthis way the law of gravitation as established by Newton \u201c explains \u201d the movement of the moon and \u201c explains \u201d Kepler\u2019s laws\r\nof the planetary movements. Very many explanations in the\r\nsphere of physics and chemistry are of this type.\r\nThe second form of \u201c explaining \u201d may be called hypothetic\r\ninvention. There is no class of known cases with regard to which\r\nthe new fact is nothing but a modification, no class into which, so\r\nto say, it may be inserted ; the class-concept itself has to be established as an idtimate principle. This is the case in the sphere of\r\nbiology, for instance, as soon as you have broken with the mechanistic theory of life and have accepted so-called vitalism in any of\r\nits various forms. It has also been the case in physics and chemistry\r\nwhenever these sciences encountered radically new discoveries, as,\r\ne.g., in the sphere of electro-dynamics about a hundred years ago.\r\nWe are accustomed to say that we \u201c understand \u201d a fact as soon\r\nas it is explained. But this is not quite correct. For we never understand any fact in the sphere of Reality in the deepest sense of\r\n' This paper was read at a General Meeting of the Society on 24th October,\r\n1934.\r\nA 1\r\n2 Professor Hans Driesch [partthe word \u201c understanding Understanding of this sort is onlypossible in the sphere of the theory of pure meaning, i.e. in the sphereof pure logic and mathematics. We may say, however, that\u201c explaining \u201d in the sense described gives us something we can call \u201c secondary imderstanding \u201d, for in any case explanations aresimjilification guided by the principle of the economy of thinking.But we never imderstand the explaining principles in the deepestsense of the word. They can be acknowledged qua ultimate principlesof empirical Reality, but we never miderstand that they must bewhat they are.\r\nI said at the beginnuig that explanations are wont to be of twodifferent kinds. Please notice the words \u201c are wont \u201d. Their purposeis to leave open the possibility that there might perhaps be still athird kind of so-called explaining, and it is of this third form thatI shall speak to you to-day with regard to a particular problem.\r\nExjilanations of the first kind start, as I have said, from a groupof known cases, which we shall call the \u201c normal \u201d ones, and tryto show that a new fact which at first appears to be \u201c abnormal \u201dis nothing but a modification of normality. But may it not happenthat facts which are very common and very \u201c normal \u201d, nay evencommonplace, may receive some light from facts which are veryrare, very abnormal or even \u201c paranormal \u201d ? It seems to me that this may be the case with regard tomemory.\r\nLet me first speak of so-called memory as being a fact withinthe sphere of Reality ; we shall soon be able to see that this \u201c fact \u201d\r\nimplies very many problems of a very enigmatic character, and it\r\nis to the enigmatic character of these problems that my hypotheticstatement will refer. Psychical research should throw some light on at least one of these problems.\r\nWe must make a sharp distmction between remembrance orrecollection on the one hand and memory on the other. By thefirst word (in German Erinnerung, in French souvenir) we describe a particular type of immediate conscious experience, by the seconda something that is generally called a potency or faculty of theso-called mmd. This distinction is connected with another one,\r\nnamely with that between the conscious Ego and the somethingwhich is \u201c unconscious \u201d and yet does not belong to the world ofmatter, in short the \u201c unconscious-psychical \u201d. We have to start from remembrance, for this is immediately experienced, whilst\r\nmemory may be said to be a theoretical construction.\r\nWhat, then, is remembrance or recollection ? What do I experi- ence whenever I remember ? In any case, remembrance is a form\r\n139 ] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 3\r\nof my immediate experience, i.e. tliat whicli I consciously possess\r\nor \u201c have \u201d in an immediate way. There are many other forms\r\nor types : images, e.g., and wishes and thoughts and feelings, etc.,\r\nbelong here. What, then, is the very essence of remembrances,\r\nthat which distinguishes them from other experiences ? The\r\nparticular essence of remembrance is established by a certain\r\naccent, as I should like to call it, which is absent in all the other\r\nforms of immediate experiences. And this accent is denoted by\r\nthe word \u201c before \u201d or by the words \u201c this has already been \u201d. In\r\nother words, we call immediate experiences, which carry on them\r\nthe accent \u201c before \u201d, \u201c remembrances \u201d. The accent of \u201c before \u201d may be attached to all other classes of\r\nexperiences. I can \u201c remember \u201d that I have had this image, or\r\nthis wish, or this thought, etc. Is not this accent of \u201c before \u201d, i.e. my possessing remembrances,\r\na very strange thing, a real enigma ? Think of the fact that I have\r\na remembrance always in a particular present moment of time or, in short, in a \u201c now \u201d\u2014but it means a\r\n\u201c before \u201d. In rememberiug\r\nthe past becomes present.\r\nBut certain distinctions in the field of remembrances are now\r\nnecessary and will be of great importance for what is to follow.\r\nIn the first place, it is necessary to distinguish between a mere idea\r\nin the most general sense and a remembrance proper. If the image\r\nof Westminster Abbey is standing before my conscious Ego, this\r\nis not yet a remembrance ; it only becomes a remembrance when\r\nthe accent of \u201c before \u201d is added to the content of that idea, i.e. when I say \u201c This image of Westminster Abbey has already been\r\nthe content of one or of many of my experiences in former times \u201d.\r\nThis, of course, does not tell you anything new. But less obvious, though not less important, is another necessary\r\ndistinction in the field of remembrances : the distinction between\r\ndated and non-dated recollections. I have been m Great Britain,\r\nhaving crossed the Channel on the way to it, a dozen times : and\r\nI can remember each of my visits separately. Here the time accent\r\nwhich is attached to my conscious content is not only the general\r\naccent of \u201c before \u201d, but is a particular \u201c before \u201d in each case. And each of these particular \u201c before \u201d accents stands in a very\r\nstrange relation to the others, namely, in a relation which is ex- pressed by the words \u201c earher \u201d and \u201c later \u201d, and this in quite a deternuned way ; in my case, for example, connected with the years\r\n1889, 1890, 1896, 1907, etc. This, then, is a dated remembrance.\r\nNot only the past in general becomes present here, but the particular\r\npast in the course of time.\r\n4 Professor Hans Driesdi [partSo much about remembrance as an immediate form of experiencein general ; so much, in other terms, about what may be called thedescriptive psychology or, to use the modern word, the \u201c phenomenology \u201d of remembranced\r\nSo far we have faced a fact not a problem, but a problem, a veryimportant problem, comes upon the scene as soon as we are inclinedto ask the question\u2014and all of us are inclined to \u201c ask \u201d it in thisform\u2014What are the reasons for the genesis of my remembrancesin the course of my conscious life or, in popular terms, from wheredo they come ? For that my remembrances are standing withinthe temporal sequence of my conscious experiences, each of themin its particular jdace, whether dated or not, is a fact. Here the analytical study of our problem has to begin, for nowthere is a problem before us, namely, as in the sphere of all sciences,\r\nthe problem of discovering order within a totality of facts. Butto try to discover order means to be in search of the relations in\r\nwhich a particular fact, which for this very reason is called a problem,stands with respect to other problems, and in particular withregard to the question of its temporal genesis. Let us then try tofind out the genetic relations of the facts of remembrance.\r\nI discover the first of these relations as soon as I compare myremembrances with the sum total of all my other experiences inthe past. And here I discover the relation of similarity or evenidentity. For remembering means that I experience a certaincontent which has l)een already experienced at a former moment.Apart from the accent of \u201c before \u201d which is a constituent of theremembrance exclusively, the quality of the content of the remembrance is the same, or at least almost the same, as the quality ofthe content of a former experience.\r\nAnd this proves that there has been 'preserved a somethmg duringthe course of my conscious life, that it has been preserved in anon-conscious state, and is yet able to become conscious again ; that it is permanent in a certain sense. But where is it preserved ? Certainly not within the Ego, for quite apart from the fact that theEgo is not a sort of pot in which there might be a something, theEgo quite certainly does not possess the content in question aslong as it does not remember it. Are we allowed to say that \u201c themind \u201d is the place of preservation, that ever}fihing that has beenan object for the conscious Ego leaves its \u201c engram \u201d or a trace, or a vestige, or whatever we may call it, in the Unconscious Mind ?\r\n^ A very profound analysis of the phenomenon remembrance will be foundin J. B. Baillie\u2019s book, Studies m Hummi Nature, chap, iv, \u201c The Nature ofMemory Knowledge \u201d (pp. 105-132).\r\n139] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 5\r\nThis may be, and certain psychologists have thought so, as e.g. Beneke in the beginnuig of the nineteenth century. But it seems\r\nto me that it would be a little rash to accept this hypothesis, which, once for all, would attribute to mind \u201c memory \u201d in the sense of\r\na faculty of preserving, and regard this statement as a definite\r\nsolution of our problem. In the first place it seems to me it would\r\nnot tell us very much simjily to reduce the actual phenomena of\r\nremembrance to \u201c memory \u201d as a sort of faculty or potency. For\r\nsuch a statement merely says that remembrance comes from the\r\nfaculty of remembering\u2014think of the \u201c Virtus dormitiva \u201d of the\r\nopium in Moliere\u2019s Malade hnaginaire. And besides, we know\r\nabout certain relations of the phenomenon of remembrance to other\r\nfacts which must in any case be discussed before a definite answer\r\nis possible.\r\nIt may be that in some sense we shall come back to the concept\r\nof \u201c memory \u201d as a primordial faculty of the mind. But it may also\r\nbe that things will appear to be much more complicated.\r\nMan is a dualistic creature, a psycho-physical being, whose\r\nphysical part is called body. I cannot develop here before you the\r\npsycho-physical problem in its totality.^ Let me only say that\r\nthe doctrine of so-called \u201c psycho-physical parallelism \u201d in its usual form, namely the doctrine that conscious life is \u201c the same\r\n\u201d\r\nas the mechanics of the brain \u201c seen from the other side \u201d, seems\r\nto me to be absolutely absurd. This theory, in fact, should definitely\r\nget its place in the antiquity museum of scientific theories.\r\nBut some sort of relation between conscious life and states of\r\nthe body, and particularly of the brain, does certainly exist, of\r\nwhatever kind it may be, and it has a reference to that form of our immediate conscious experiences which we call remembrance.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that lesions of the brain, whether they are the consequence of an ojjeration or of an accident, are very often,\r\nthough not always, followed by disturbances of the conscious life, and in particular of the faculty of remembrance. The defects of\r\nmemory may either reveal themselves in the impossibility of\r\nrememljering something that normally would be remembered with\r\ncertainty, or in gaps in the sphere of recognition : objects which\r\nin the state of normality would be recognised as what they are, are not recognised if a lesion of the brain has taken place.\r\nThis is a fact. Another fact, however, is that in very many\r\ncases such defects of remembering or recognising disappear after\r\n1 Compare my books Mind and Body (English translation by Tli. Bester- man) and The Crisis of Psychology (Princeton University Press). Also the\r\nsecond edition of the German book Grundprohleme der Psychologic.\r\n6 Professor Hans Driesch [parta certain time, to the great benefit of the patient. You may saythat for this very reason the defects of memory have not been of afundamental character. But in any case they have been present fora certain time after the lesion ; and this fact is sufficient to provethat a certain relation between remembering and the state of thebody, in particular the brain, does exist. It is just here that adeeper analysis of what happens will have to be made later on, ananalysis which is to give us important results.\r\nBut the phenomenon of remembering does not only stand inrelation to other |)henomena of the conscious life itself and to statesof the lu\u2019ain ; it also stands in a relation of dependence in respectto something else, that we may shortly call the modifications of the\r\nstate of mind, where the word \u201c mind \u201d is taken in the rather vagueand general sense in which I have used it, namely, as signifyingthe unconscious substructure of conscious life. In the state of hypnosis the faculty of remembering is alwaysgreater than in the waking stage, very often in cpiite a curiousdegree. Former experiences which long since have been completelyforgotten, and which could inider no circumstances be reproducedin waking, are reproduced in hypnosis. The hypnotised person,when woken from the hypnotic state, may not remember what hehas reproduced during that state. But in any case he must havereproduced these things during h}q)nosis, otherwise he would notliave been able to speak about them when in that state. This, then, is the third kind of relation in which rememberingstands ; the faculty of remembering depends on the states of themind in the sense defined.\r\nAnd now we are prepared to enter into theoretical considerations.I shall ])egin by shortly explaining to you in the form of sketcheswhat may be called the usual and, so to say, \u201c official \u201d hypothesesabout the genesis of the phenomenon of remembering, aj^art fromthe impossible theory of parallelism. These hypotheses, of course,do not touch psychical research, for they are \u201c olficial \u201d. We have already shortly mentioned the hypothesis of mentalengrammata. This is a purely psychological theory ; it is insuffi-cient, as it does not account for the dependence of remembering onthe condition of the brain, a dependence which, as we know, cer-taiidy exists, and the relation l)etween the degree of memory andthe various mental states also remains miexplained. The matteris certainly not so siniple.\r\nLet us, then, argue as follows ; There are vestiges m the braincorresponding with everything which the person in question hasexperienced during his life. These vestiges or engrammata are of\r\n139 ] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 7\r\na purely material nature\u2014miknown in detail. The unconscious\r\nMind, taken as an entity in itself, has also received vestiges during\r\nlife and preserves them all in the form of memory. But this memory\r\non the part of the mind does not greatly help the remetnbering on\r\nthe part of the conscious Ego, which is regarded here as being a\r\nparticular part or side of the Mind. Under certain circumstances,\r\nhowever, the Mind wishes to give to the Ego a conscious experience\r\nof the forms of a remembrance, and in order to do this it activates a particular one of the mental vestiges of the brain\u2014reading in a book of these vestiges, as it were\u2014and then the Ego remembers.\r\nSo far we have regarded the Ego as being a part or side of the\r\nMind. Another modification of the theory is, however, possible.\r\nWe may call it the Aristotelian modification, for it takes Mind and\r\nEgo as two separate entities, corresponding to the Aristotelian\r\nconcepts of iffvxy and vovs, whilst hitherto we have regarded Mind\r\nand Ego as being one entity at the bottom. From the Aristotelian\r\npoint of view we might now say that the entity which we have\r\ncalled Ego is stimulated by certain states of the entity Mind to\r\n\u201c read \u201d in the book of material engrammata of the brain\u2014and\r\nthen it remembers. Mental engrammata would not play any role\r\nin the sphere of this hypothesis.\r\nBoth theories are rather fantastic constructions. They are\r\nnecessary, however, in one form or another, as soon as you reject\r\nparallelism but are not at the same time prepared to leave the\r\nsphere of official psychology.\r\nThere is one particular difficulty common to both theories. This\r\ndifficulty, however, may be overcome.\r\nI am thinking of the fact that both theories employ the concept\r\nof material engrammata in the sense of particular material states\r\nof the brain. Now all that is material exists at once ; it always is what it is at the present moment, but never what it has been.\r\nMaterial states, in other words, qua \u201c material \u201d states never carry\r\ntheir past history with and on themselves. How, then, may what\r\nwe have called a\r\n\u201c reading \u201d in the book of engrammata reveal\r\nthe particularly dated past to the reading Ego\u2014whether we take\r\nit as a part or side of the imconscious mind or as a particular entity 1 In fact, a grave difficulty seems to come upon the scene here, i^d\r\nyet this difficulty is not so grave as it might seem at the first glance.\r\nFor the reading Ego might behave lilve a detective in a \u201c shocker\r\nCertainly the engrammata are all present at once. But might they\r\nnot possess a different degree of freshness, just as foot-prints in\r\nsand may show a corresponding difference 1 Then this degree of\r\nfreshness of the impressions would be a symbol of their relative\r\n8 Professor Hans Driesch [partage. And the \u201c detective \u201d, i.e. the Ego, would be able to inferthe relative age from the relative freshness.\r\nThe simultaneous presence of all mental engrammata in the brain,therefore, would not be a fundamental difficulty for the officialtheories.\r\nAnd yet the official theories of the genesis of remembrances arenot only fantastic, as we have said before, but insufficient, for theygive no account of our second and third t}^)es of relations betweenremembering and something else, namely, the dependence ofremembering on states of the brain and on states of the 'mind.\r\nLet us, then, in the first place, enter into a more detailedanalysis of the relations between remembrance and conditionsof the brain.\r\nThe disturbances of the faculty of remembering by lesions ofthe brain are of a very peculiar type. They do not allow us to saythat the content of every particular former experience is representedby a specially localised impression or \u201c engram \u201d in the brain.For facts do not prove that particular former experiences areeliminated from the sphere of possible reproduction in consequenceof a lesion of the brain ; the defects of memory consequent oncertain lesions are of a very different type : personal names are thefirst thing that can no longer be remembered, and then come nounsin general, and finally verbs, i.e. all words related with events.This rule was first formulated by Ribot. His statements are mostdecidedly opposed to the view that there is something like a particularseat of each particular former experience.\r\nAnd further : In very many cases the possibility of rememberingis restored after a certain time, even if the loss of brain-substancehas been very considerable. This fact also tells very clearly againstthe theory of engrammata as far as these are regarded as specifically\r\nlocalised material structures.\r\nRut, on the other hand, whenever we accept the concept ofengrammata or material vestiges at all, these engrammata must belocalised in one form or the other. It is impossible to assume thatthey are not, as long as they are taken as particular material states or conditions. For every state or condition which is material is also localised in some way.\r\nWhat shall we do in the face of these facts ? Let me repeat : The defects of memory in consequence of alesion of the brain are, firstly, of a very j^eculiar type, as describedby Ribot and others, and are, secondly, iii very many cases\r\nrestorable, even if the loss of bram substances has been veryconsiderable.\r\n139] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 9\r\nFor these reasons engrammata cannot be localised ; but if they\r\nare not localised, they cannot be material states and conditions in\r\nthe proper sense. And yet lesions of the brain do affect memory.\r\nWhat, then, may this role of the brain turn out to be ?\r\nIt is at this point of our discussion that our hypothetic considerations will enter the field of psychical research. Let me state\r\nthe hypothesis at once. It seems to me possible to assume hypothetically that, with regard to remembering, the brain plays the\r\nrole of a so-called fsyclmnetrised object of rapport.\r\nAll my readers know what the word \u201c psychometry \u201d means, and\r\nall, I am convinced, are also aware that this word is not approjiriate\r\nwhen taken literally. For nothing is \u201c measured \u201d. But it is of no use, as it seems to me, to introduce new technical terms if the\r\nold ones are universally understood. The words \u201c physics \u201d and\r\n\u201c physiology \u201d are likewise names which theoretically might be\r\nabolished, for both of them mean the same literally, though they\r\nare used for very different sciences. Let us, then, use the word\r\n\u201c psychometry \u201d. The centre of the concept of psychometry is the psychometrised\r\nobject of rapport. This is any object whatever which has belonged\r\nto a human person, present or absent, living or deceased, and which,\r\nwhen touched or merely seen by a sensitive, enables him or her to\r\ntell us something about the former proprietor of the object. The\r\npsychometrical object, then, reveals the past, reveals history.\r\nBut not, at least most probably not, the history of the object as\r\nsuch, but the history of the former proprietor of the object. All\r\ncases we know tend in this direction, and there are very many very\r\ngood cases in various volumes of our Proceedings as well as in the\r\nworks of Wasielewski, Pagenstecher, Osty and others.\r\nThat which seems to be at work here, I should like to call retrospective mind reading. I should not like to call it \u201c clairvoyance \u201d,\r\nthough certain writers have done so. For \u201c clairvoyance \u201d in the\r\nproper sense of the word means the paranormal awareness of an\r\nobjective situation within the sphere of Reality. Now all the facts\r\nthe sensitive is aware of in the case of psychometry relate to the\r\npast. But past situations qua objective situations do not exist\r\nany more in the present. Past contents of consciousness, however,\r\ndo exist in the present, in the form of contents of memory of certain\r\npersons, or may at least be assumed to exist in this form hypothetically\u2014either in the memory of deceased persons, if you are\r\ninclined to accept spiritualism, or in the world-consciousziess as advocated by James and Osty. I might even say that the hypotheses of spiritualism and of the \u201c conscience universelle \u201d have\r\n10 Professor Hans Driesch [part\r\nbeen invented in order to avoid such a strange thing as real retro- spective clairvoyance.\r\nThere exists, as you know, also the hypothesis of so-called \u201c mind\r\ntravel \u201d or \u201c excursus This has been put forward in order to\r\ngive a siifficient reason for clairvoyance proper, as it is so often\r\nconnected with a telepathic stimulus. But this hypothesis can only\r\nexplain a clairvoyant awareness of a 'present objective situation, never a paranormal experience of a situation in the past. For\r\nyou cannot \u201c travel \u201d in the past.\r\nBut let us now go back to our problems of remembrance. Mytheory, then, is that the brain is a psychometrical object of rapport,\r\nand that the Ego of the bearer or proprietor of the brain is the one who used this rapport object, namely, his own brain, in order to\r\nget information about his own past history : this would be just\r\nwhat we call \u201c remembrance \u201d. You may object here that it seems very strange to explain\r\nphenomena which are so common and normal, as remembrance is, by suljstituting this very strange phenomenon, psychometry.\r\nAnd you may tell me that I myself on another occasion have\r\ncalled psychometry the most enigmatic of all j^arapsychical\r\nphenomena.^\r\nAdmittedly it is ; and yet a certain theoretical simplification\r\nmay be gained l)y introducing this concept, for there are certain\r\nfacts in connection with the phenomenon of remembrance which\r\nwill now become understandable, at least to a certain degree. These\r\nfacts, moreover, are just those which have made it impossible for us\r\nto accept any of the current and \u201c official \u201d theories of memory.\r\nThinlv of what I have said about certain kinds of relations in\r\nwhich the phenomenon of remembering stands with regard to other\r\nwell-established facts. The first of these relations was concerned with the body, the\r\nbrain in particular. The effects of lesions of the brain-matter were\r\nfoimd to be of such a kind that the hypothetic assumption of\r\nmaterial engrammata qua \u201c material \u201d impressions appeared to\r\nbe impossible : the so-called engrammata cannot be localised, and,\r\nbesides, the effects of a lesion, of a very grave lesion, disappear\r\nafter a certain time in very many cases. The second kind of a relation to something else in which the\r\nphenomenon of remembrance stands is its relation to what wehave called \u201c states of the mind \u201d : the faculty of remembering is enormously increased duruig the hypnotic state.\r\n1 Compare my \u201c Parapsychologie \u201d, 1932 : English translation by Th.\r\nBesterman, Psychical Research, 1933.\r\n139] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 11\r\nNow it is just these two kinds of relations wliich we should expect\r\nto exist in the foundation of our psychometrical hypothesis ! As\r\nto the dependence of remembermg on the brain, we know that the\r\nsomething which a psychometrical object of rapport has \u201c on\r\n\u201d\r\nitself, so to say, is certainly not a material modification qua material\r\n;\r\nfor this reason it must not necessarily be regarded as being specifically localised and may easily be taken as restorable after disturbances. And secondly : in the state of trance the psychometrical\r\nfaculty of a sensitive is generally very much increased. Now the\r\nhypnotic state is very similar to the state of trance, and thus we\r\nare able to understand the great increase of the faculty of remembering in the hypnotic.\r\nWe may also add still another feature that is common both to\r\npsychometrical experience and remembering : it is a well-known\r\nfact that we remember past events of our life with particular\r\nclearness whenever they carry an emotional accent. Now emotion\r\nseems to play a corresponding part in psychometry. In most\r\ncases, at least, the sensitive who is in touch with an object of rapport\r\nis especially aware of those past events relating to the former owner\r\nof the object in which emotion has played a predominant role. So we have acquired at least a certain understanding of thi'ee\r\npeculiarities of the phenomenon of remembrance, which without\r\nour hypothesis would remain completely imintelligible.\r\nI am well aware that this kind of understanding is very preliminary and very defective. And yet it seems to me that the\r\npsychometrical hypothesis, as applied to the fact of remembering,\r\nmeans a little more than merely the substitution of a \u201c y\r\n\u201d for an \u201c X\r\nIn any case there is a certain feature that is common to both : to the psychometrical object in the ordinary sense and to the\r\nbrain in its relation to remembering. This feature or character is luiknown in detail at present, no doubt. We only know of it, that\r\nit consists in the necessity of the actual presence of a particular\r\nmaterial object with a particular history, the peculiarity of which,\r\nhowever, does not refer to material particulars qun \u201c material \u201d\r\nones. Some such\u2019 object must exist, in ordinary psychometry as\r\nwell as with regard to the brain in its relation to remembering.\r\nAnd this statement implies in any case a theoretical simplification.\r\nIt is hardly necessary to emphasise that the hypothesis of the\r\npsychometrical role of the brain does not by any means imply that\r\nthis role is the only part played by the cerebrum. Such an assumption would be very far from truth.\r\nWe know that the brain has a structure of enormous complexity.\r\n12 Professor Hans Driesch [partIn this respect it serves the purpose of the realisation of correlated\r\nmovement, i.e. \u201c action \u201d, connecting almost every part of theorganism with almost every other. Here it is the brain\u2019s particular\r\nmaterial structures, taken qua \u201c material \u201d ones, that are of importance ; the brain in this respect is an apparatus of enormouscomplexity, used by the mind for its purposes.\r\nAs far, however, as its psychometrical role is in question, thebrain counts only as one Unity with a particular history, just as any inanimate psychometrical object does, say a watch given into\r\nthe hands of a sensitive person. The watch too does not counthere as a particular material structure serving the indication oftime, but as one Unity with a particular history. And so doesthe brain.\r\n1 do not, of course, at all believe that my psychometrical hypothesis ex])lains the conscious life in its totality. It does not evenex|dain everything that is connected with remembering, thoughit may explain certain characteristics of this fact. If we call \u201c memory \u201d a certain faculty of the mind which enables the mindto preserve, so to speak, past experiences, we are forced to attribute\r\nto the mind the faculty of pure preserving : i.e. niemory as anelemental faculty apart from the psychometrical faculty which weattribute to it. In other words, nmnory as an elemental faculty\r\nbecomes by no means superfluous in the face of our hyjDothesis.\r\nBut we burden the mind with the faculty of preserving mereideas, i.e. mere contents of former experiences exclusively, not,\r\nhowever, with the faculty of preserving particular \u201c remembrances \u201d. And this means that we attribute to the mind, under the name of\u201c memory \u201d, nothing but the faculty of preserving the past in the\r\nform of a mere material for its working, whether this be thinking,\r\nwilling or whatever else. To give an example ; The image of\r\nW estminster Abbey is preserved by the mind in the general memorialform. Not, however, the fact that I have experienced W'^estminster\r\nAbbey before, that is to say, not the content \u201c Westminster Al^bey \u201d\r\nwith the accent \u201c before \u201d. Remembrance proper, i.e. my consciously possessing a something ivitlt that accent, be it dated or not dated,\r\nis that feature of conscious life which calls our psychometrical\r\nhypothesis upon the scene. With regard to remembrance proper,\r\nthe general preserving faculty of the mind, which is called memory,does not, in my opinion, suffice. For this very reason I rejected the\r\n\u201c official \u201d theories of memory in the beginning of this paper.\r\nI thus made a sharjo distinction between the conscious possession\r\nof mere ideas or contents, which of course also come from past\r\nexperiences, and the possession of the past as such, be it dated or not.\r\n139] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 13\r\nIt might be possible, perhaps, to draw the sharp line of distinction,\r\nnot between mere ideas and remembrances proper, but between\r\ndated and undated remembrances. In that case, memory would\r\nbe the mind\u2019s faculty for preserving mere ideas and non-dated\r\nremembrances, whilst only with regard to dated remembrances\r\nwould the psychometrical faculty of the mind be at work. Memory\r\nwould be concerned not merely with my possessing mere contents\r\nof former experiences without any 6e\/ore-accent, but also with my\r\npossessing \u201c before \u201d accents in general, though not particularly\r\ndated ones. But ^lersonally I should prefer the other alternative.\r\nThe problem we have just now discussed is not without importance for those who are inclined to accept the so-called spiritualistic hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis of personal survival. If the\r\npresence of the bram is necessary only for dated remembrances,\r\nthe disembodied spirit would not be able to possess such remembrances after death, though he might possess all mere contents\r\nthat were acquired by him during his embodied life, and also the\r\ngeneral \u201c before \u201d accent. This means to say that he might be able\r\nto remember : \u201cI have experienced this or that, when I was\r\nliving \u201d, but not \u201c this was earlier than that \u201d. On the hy|3othesis\r\nthat all remembering, dated and non-dated, depends on the brain\r\ntaken as a psychometrical object, the deceased spirit would, of\r\ncourse, be only in possession of mere ideas or contents without\r\nremembering any kind of \u201c before \u201d. A few words may, finally, still be devoted to the concept of the\r\npsychometrical rapport object in general, with particular reference,\r\nhowever, to the brain.\r\nWhilst speakmg from the platform of some of the usual and,\r\nso to say, \u201c official \u201d theories of memory, i.e. of those hypotheses\r\nwhich though rejectuig parallelism are not concerned with the\r\nresults of psychical research, we regarded the brain as if it were\r\na book in which engrammata of a symbolic kind were inscribed,\r\nand we attributed to the Ego the faculty of \u201c reading \u201d m this\r\nbook and of interpreting what it has read. The engrammata were\r\ntaken here as being of a strictly material, i.e. of a physico-chemical,\r\nnature in the narrow sense of this word. But it then turned out\r\nthat, for various reasons, the engrammata cannot be localised\r\nmaterial states or conditions of the brain. And yet the brain does\r\nplay a role in remembering. Thus we were led to our psychometrical\r\nh}^q)othesis, no other theoretical possibility being left. But what does it ultimately mean to regard the brain as an\r\nobject of rapport, revealing to its bearer his own past history ? An object of rapport carries on itself the complete past at once,\r\n14 Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research, [part 139though not in the form of material localised impressions, as the\u201c official \u201d theories of remembering were forced to assume. How,then, may particulars with regard to the past be revealed here,\r\nhow may it be inferred that one past event has been earlier orlater than the other ? You will be aware that we are here in face of the great problemof psychometry in general : What does the object of rapport have \u201c on \u201d itself ? Certainlynothing of a material nature. But what ? May we say, perhaps,that it has nothing \u201c on \u201d itself in the proper sense of the word,but that it stands \u201c in relation to \u201d something else ? This, then,\r\nis in fact the view of those workers who have deeply thought aboutthe problem of psychometry\u2014let me only mention Mattiesen andBozzano. And it did appear inevitable to these thinkers to introduce here the hy|3othesis of an universal world consciousness, evenif you are inclined to accejjt the spiritualistic hyj^othesis. Forthe two great parapsychical hypotheses do not necessarily contradictone another ; both of them may be true. But it is not my task here to discuss problems of psychicalresearch in general. My theme has been a limited one : memoryin relation to psychical research.\r\nWithin this limited field I have tried to develop before you a hypothesis which is probably a new one\u2014I, at least, do not knowof a predecessor here. I dehver this hypothesis to criticism, fully aware that it is a hyj3othesis. But hypotheses\u2014so it seems to mein spite of the great Nevdon\u2019s \u201c hypotheses non fingo \u201d\u2014hypotheses do not do any damage to science, as long as they are regardedas hypotheses.\r\nNOTES ON \u201c WALTEK \u201d THUMBPRINTS OF THE\r\n\u201c MARGERY \u201d SEANCES\r\nBy Harold Cummins\r\nIntroductory Note by W. H. Salter\r\nAs many of our members may not have followed closely the con- troversy regarding the genuineness of the \u201c Walter\u201d thumbprints,\r\nproduced at seances given by \u201c Margery \u201d (Mrs Crandon), they may\r\nbe glad to have a brief explanation of the nature of Professor\r\nCummins\u2019s subjoined report and of how he came to make it. Those\r\nwho wish to follow the controversy in detail may do so in the\r\npublications of the American Society for Psychical Research and\r\nof the Boston Society for Psychic Research ; {See in particular\r\nProceedings, vol. xxii, of the former Society and Bulletins XVIII\r\nand XXII of the latter Society). It is well known that the publications of the American Society for Psychical Research have, since\r\nthe issue in 1928 of the first number of Psychic Research, been\r\nlargely devoted to accoimts of sittings with \u201c Margery \u201d at which\r\nher Control \u201c Walter \u201d is said to have produced impressions of his\r\nthumbs in \u201c Kerr \u201d dental wax, and that numerous photographs\r\nof the impressions said to have been so produced illustrated the\r\narticles describing the sittmgs. A member of the American Society\r\nfor Psychical Research, Mr Dudley, took a prominent part, both\r\nin supervising the sittings and in presenting the reports of them to\r\nthe public.\r\nThe controversy began when, in Bulletin XVIII of the Boston\r\nSociety, Mr Dudley made statements which may be summarised\r\nas follows ;\r\n(1) Shortly before the first sitting (30 July 1926) when \u201c Walter \u201d\r\nthumbprints were produced, Mrs Crandon visited her dentist\r\n(\u201c Kerwin \u201d, pseudonym) who made for her impressions of his own\r\nthumbs in \u201c Kerr \u201d wax, and gave these impressions to her, together\r\nwith spare pieces of wax.\r\n(2) In 1932 he (Mr Dudley) was obtaining for purposes of record\r\nfinger-prints of all who had attended \u201c Margery \u201d sittings ; and\r\nas \u201c Kerwin \u201d had attended some of the earher sittings, he asked\r\nto be allowed to obtain his prints ; \u201c Kerwin \u201d consented, and on\r\n15\r\n294977\r\n16 \" Harold' {JvMimins : Notes on [partcomparison it. was eyir\u2019ent that liis thumbprints corresponded soclosely with txi any thumb impressions reproduced in Psychic Researchas \u201c Walter's \u201d as to make it certain that the impressions derived(directly or indirectly) from the same pair of thumbs.\r\nThe reply to Mr Dudley is to be found in vol. xxii of the Proceedings of the American Society. In this volume the statementsset out in the last paragraph are not challenged but further state-ments are made, which suggest inferences different from those thatmight naturally be drawn from Mr Dudley\u2019s statements. Thesefurther statements, so far as they relate to impressions of theright thumb (which is all that Professor Cummins\u2019s report dealswith) are as follows :\r\n(1) \u201c Kerwin \u201d made his impressions on the afternoon beforethe sitting of 30 July 1926 ; they were shown by \u201c Margery \u201d toMr Dudley that evening and taken away by him.\r\n(2) While the \u201c Kerwin \u201d prints and the impressions illustratedin Psychic Research, exactly correspond, the real \u201c Walter \u201d impressions do not ; there is a resemblance in some respects, but,among other differences, the true \u201c Walter \u201d thumbprints show a\u201c staple core \u201d, while the \u201c Kerwin \u201d jnints and the impressionstallying with them show a\r\n\u201c rod core \u201d. For an explanation ofthese terms, see Professor Cummins\u2019s report.\r\nMr Dudley\u2019s rejoinder (Boston Bulletin XXII) is a flat denialof having ever seen the \u201c Kerwin \u201d impressions in 1926, as alleged.\r\nWhile various points in the controversy almost irresistibly invitecomment, there is only one point with which the S.P.K. is concernedand to that point I shall confine my observations.\r\nIn Deceml)er 1929 the Council of the S.P.R. lent the Society\u2019sseance room to Dr Crandon who wished to give demonstrations ofsittings with \u201c Margery \u201d. Dr Woolley, then Hon. ResearchOfficer, and Mrs Brackenbury, his Assistant, were present asobservers. xWter one of these sittings a piece of wax was foundbearing an impression of one of \u201c Margery\u2019s \u201d fingers. This incidentis reported and commented on by Dr Woolley and Mrs Brackenburyin vol. xxxix of S.P.R. Proceedings (pp. 358-368). At the sittingof the 7 December 1929 \u201c Walter \u201d produced two impressions ofhis right thumb, one of these was presented by \u201c Walter \u201d to DrWoolley and the other to Mr Harry Price {See Psychic Research,vol. xxiv). Dr Woolley put the impression given to him in a cardboard box inscribed (in Mrs Brackenbury\u2019s writing), \u201c \u2018 Walter \u2019\r\nimpression obtained at seance held at S.P.R. 7 December 1929.\r\nMedium. Margery Crandon.\u201d The box was placed in a lockedcabinet, the only key of which was in Dr Woolley\u2019s custody.\r\n139] \u201c Walter \u201d Tlmmbprints of the \u201c Margery \u201d Seances 17\r\nOn Dr Woolley\u2019s resignation in December 1931, the cabinet and\r\nkey came under the control of Miss Newton. The box remained\r\nthere untouched until the 31 January 1934, when Miss Newton\r\nfound it and opened it in the presence of Mr Besterman and myself.\r\nShe then initialled and dated the wax, and also the liox, for the\r\npurposes of identification. As this impression had been produced\r\nbefore the present controversy began, and had been in the Society\u2019s\r\npossession under lock and key ever since, the question whether it conformed to the \u201c Kerwin \u201d type with a\r\n\u201c rod core \u201d or to the\r\n\u201c staple core \u201d type was obviously of the first importance to any\r\none wishing to form an opinion as to the merits of the dispute.\r\nIn August 1934 Professor Harold Cummins of the Department\r\nof Anatomy, Tulane University of Louisiana, was visiting London\r\nto attend a Congress. Professor Cummins is a recognised authority on \u201c dermatoglyphics \u201d, and in that capacity had in December\r\n1932 been invited by the American Society to report as to whether\r\ntwo sets of prints sent him were identical. He was a quite independent expert, not having previously been connected in any way\r\nwith the \u201c Margery \u201d mediumship. When he made his reports\r\n(printed on pp. 201-208 of vol. xxii of the American S.P.E.\r\nProceedings) he knew nothing about the origin of the two sets of\r\nprints submitted to him.\r\nProfessor Cummins wished to take the opjjortunity of his visit\r\nto England to inspect the impression in the possession of the S.P.R.,\r\nand any other impressions in England that might be open to inspection. He met Miss Newton and myself at the Society\u2019s Rooms on\r\nthe 1st August 1934. There was also present Mr Stanley de Brath,\r\nwho brought with him a \u201c Walter \u201d impression belonging to the\r\nBritish College of Psychic Science. Professor Cummins, in the\r\npresence of Miss Newton, Mr de Brath and myself, carefully exa- mined four impressions : (1) the impression given to Dr Woolley\r\non the 7 December 1929, (2) two impressions given by \u201cWalter\u201d\r\nto Lord Charles Hope, and by him sent to the S.P.R. for the pur|)ose\r\nof Professor Cummins\u2019s inspection, and (3) the impression brought\r\nby Mr de Brath. He kindly promised to give me a written report,\r\nand this is the report printed below.\r\nNo good photographs of the impression in the possession of the\r\nS.P.R. existed so far as I knew ; a not very satisfactory photograph\r\nsent by Dr Woolley to the American Society is reproduced as Fig. 7\r\nto the Boston Bulletin XXII. Accordingly it seemed to me desirable\r\nthat the S.P.R. should have good photographs taken of the impression. Major Rampling Rose, a photographic expert, who is a member of the Society, kindly gave me an introduction to an\r\n18 Harold Cummins : Notes on [partimportant firm of photographic manufacturers, to whom I tookthe impression for reproduction. A negative was taken and developed in my presence, and a print is here reproduced (Fig. A, p. 20).\r\nUnfortunately when a second exposure was being taken, the waxdid not prove hard enough to stand the heat of the projectorswhile the focus and illumination were being adjusted, and theimpression became distorted in consequence.\r\nW. H. S.\r\nForeword\r\nThose who have followed the history of the \u201c Margery \u201d mediumship are akeady familiar with the controversy centring about thethumb-print phenomena. The present note concerns the results\r\nof a recent examination of eight \u201c Walter \u201d thumb-prints (negativeimpressions in a dental compound) produced under this mediumship, the examples being severally in the possession of individualsand societies in England.^ The findings have an important bearingon two crucial issues of the controversy : (1) Is the right thumbprint ascribed to \u201c Walter \u201d identical with that of the living man,\u201c Kerwin \u201d?\r\n(2) Is it justified to maintain, as do writers in vol. xxii of theProc. A.S.P.R., that impressions displaying such identity aresubstitutions, and not authentic seance prints ? The jResent note aims to deal with these prints purely objectively, as evidences pointing the answers to the two questions. A full presentation of finger-print evidence is necessarily technical, butsince this account is merely a supplement to the writer\u2019s previoustechnical contributions,^ its subject matter may be presented quitebriefly and simply. It is desirable, however, to provide a resumeof pertinent developments which have been previously recorded,\r\nin so far as these concern the isolated question of identification.\r\n1. Thumb-prints were first produced 30 July 1926 ; these andnumerous prints of a right thumb made thereafter, over a period^ It is a pleasure to mention here the generous and helpful spirit with which\r\npossessors or custodians of the tablets have so freely placed the specimens\r\nat my disposal for insjjcction. I wish, therefore, to acknowledge the co- operation of the following : S.P.R., L.S.A., Mr W. H. Salter, Mr Stanley\r\nDe Brath, Mr Harry Price, Lord Charles Hope, Sir Ernest Bennett, and Prof. F. C. S. Schiller.\r\n2 (o) Proc. A.S.P.R., vol. xxii. pp. 201-208, 1933 (embodying two reports on\r\nprints and photographs submitted by Thorogood for technical examination, with\r\ntestimony that the right thumbs of \u201c Walter \u201d and \u201c Kerwin \u201d are identical).\r\n{b) Bull., B.S.P.R., xxii. pp. 1-26, 1934 (contesting Thorogood\u2019s alleged\r\nevidences of the non-identity of the \u201c Walter \u201d and \u201c Kerwin \u201d thumbs).\r\n139] \u201c Walter \u201d Thumbprints of the \u201c Ma;rgery \u201d Seances 19\r\nof several years, proved to be identical, and were considered to be\r\nthe thumb of \u201c Walter Four prints of a left thumb, also regarded\r\nby the investigating group as that of \u201c Walter \u201d, were rendered in\r\n1927. It is important to note that this attribution of identity was\r\nnot based on comparison 'with known prints of \u201c Walter \u201d, such\r\nrecords not being available. The \u201c only evidence is the declaration\r\nof the \u2018 Walter \u2019 voice \u201d {Proc. A.S.P.R., xxii, p. 4). 2. Dudley reported in 1932 (Bull. XVIII, B.S.P.K.) that these\r\nright and left thumbs, impressions of which had been accepted since\r\n1926 as physical manifestations of the dead \u201c Walter \u201d, are identical\r\nwith the corresponding digits of the medium\u2019s dentist, \u201c Kerwin \u201d.\r\n3. An entire volume of Proc. A.S.P.R. (xxii, 1933) is professedly devoted to a reply to Dudley\u2019s identification. With regard\r\nto the right thumb, which is the only item considered here, it is contended by Thorogood in this volume that the thumbs of \u201c Walter \u201d and \u201c Kerwin \u201d are not identical. The present writer\u2019s findings\r\nto the contrary (see 1(a), p. 2) are cast aside, though published in\r\nthe report, while Dudley\u2019s identification is dismissed with the claim\r\nthat the examples considered by him may be substituted prints\r\nof \u201c Kerwin \u201d. Thorogood discusses at length the recently produced\r\n(1932) whole hand prints of \u201c Walter \u201d. These right hand impressions, curiously enough, have the \u201c Walter \u201d = \u201c Kerwin \u201d thumb,\r\nthough they are unlike the right hand of \u201c Kerwin \u201d in other\r\nparticulars. (The left hand prints bear a thumb quite unlilve the\r\nearher independent left thumbprints, and here again the explanation is advanced that the specimens used by Dudley are not authentic seance productions.)\r\n4. In Bull. XXII, B.S.P.R., the present writer reviews the\r\nidentification, proving point by point that the items detailed by\r\nThorogood as supposed evidences of non-identity of these right\r\nthumbs (allegedly representing \u201c Walter \u201d as opposed to \u201c Kerwin \u201d) are as a matter of fact only mechanical differences in the impressions,\r\nor in some instances frank errors of determination. He discusses\r\ncertain patent evidences of artificiality in some of the \u201c Walter \u201d\r\nprints and emphasizes : \u201c It is a simple process to make with dies\r\nimpressions such as these attributed to \u2018 Walter \u2019, and any critical\r\nevaluation of the finger-print and hand-print evidences must weigh\r\nthe possibilities of this operation agamst seance records offered in\r\nproof of supernormal production of the prints \u201d. In August 1934, a visit in England afforded the writer an opportumty to examine the \u201c Walter \u201d prints which are here reported.\r\nOf particular importance are the two examples made in 1929 at a\r\nseance held in London, and these will be first discussed.\r\n20 Harold Cummins : Notes on [partThe London Sitting of 7 December 1929 ^\r\nThe tablet from this seance first to be presented, in the possessionof Mr Harry Price, was examined on 3 August 1934, in the presenceof Mr Price and his secretary. At a later conference (7 August1934) Mr Price very generously permitted me to retain the wax ona long-time loan, so that I have been able since to make furtherexaminations with the facilities of my own laboratory, as well asto photograph it. Mr Price attests to the authenticity of the waxas the specimen which he obtained at the sitting, and the writeris confident that he will vouch further for the fact that the specimenas returned to him is the unaltered original and that the accom-panymg photographs are of this specimen, which is now again inhis own hands. The wax originally bore no inscription, being onlymarked at the seance by cutting notches at opposite edges ; at myrequest Mr Price made a notation (Plarry Price 7\/8\/\u201934) on thereverse surface, so that he might the more readily validate thespecimen on its return.\r\nFigure 1 illustrates the obverse of the wax tablet, a whole slabof the Kerr impression compound with a single negative imprintof \u201c Walter\u2019s \u201d right thumb ; the identifying notches are on theupper and lower edges, toward the right. Figures 2 and 3 are moreenlarged views of the imprint, photographed with different illuminations so as to bring out the delicate reliefs in contrasting appearances.Figure 2 rej)resents the more favourable view in depicting the truereliefs of this negative impression, while in Figure 3 the effects ofa different illumination are such as to lend a likeness to the reliefs of a positive. Because of this appearance Figure 3 is the moreinstructive for comparison with published reference prints of \u201c Kerwin \u201d.

It bears a typical \u201c Kerwin \u201d\r\nprint with a rod core. The second specimen, marked 10-3-29 3, bears two prints, a larger impression which is a typical \u201c Kerwin \u201d print with a\r\nrod core, and a smaller which is smoothed and defaced in the central\r\npattern area (this one not being subjected to a critical analysis in\r\nthe absence of requisite technical aids).\r\nThe Baggallay Tablet ^\r\nThis impression, now in the custody of L.S.A., was brought to\r\nthe S.P.R. rooms by Mr De Brath, where it was examined on\r\n1 August 1934, in his presence and that of Mr Salter.

The tablet is fracturedacross the thumb impression, but the whole tablet is represented in\r\nthe two pieces mounted in the frame. The obverse of the tablet\r\nis inscribed : 5-11-29. It bears a single \u201c Kerwin \u201d print with arod core.\r\nThe Schiller Tablets ^\r\nThree tablets in the possession of Prof. F. C. S. Schiller wereexamined at his home in Surrey, and in his presence, on 5 August1934:. Prof. Schiller recognises the identifying marks which hehad placed on the slabs prior to the sittmgs.\r\nOne tablet bears the incised marks : 9-9-29 4. It carries\r\ntwo imprints. One imprint is a clearly defined \u201c Kerwin \u201d right\r\nthumb, with a rod core. The second is an irregular impression,\r\nbeset with upraisings as if there had been sticking of the digit or\r\ndie in imprinting ; this pattern was not analysed in detail, thoughit is evidently a\r\n\u201c Kerwin \u201d print.\r\nA second tablet, inscribed 9-10-29, also carries two impressions.\r\nOne is a\r\n\u201c Kerwin \u201d right thumb, its core showing the \u201c routing \u201d\r\ndefect which characterises the \u201c standard \u201d of Thorogood (for\r\nexplanation of this point see summary). The second impression\r\nis of a juvenile digit (a loop), made, according to Schiller, after his\r\nrequest (voiced at the previous sitting of 9-9-29) for the print of a child.\r\nThe thh'd tablet is marked : 9-11-29 7. This slab again\r\ncarries two prints. One prmt is a \u201c Kerwin \u201d right thumb. Its core is a rod and the impression shows no artifact characteristic\r\nof Thorogood\u2019s \u201c standard \u201d. The other imprint is that of a child, a loop which is definitely a different pattern from that of the\r\njuvenile print of the preceding slab.\r\nSummary\r\n1. The eight \u201c Walter \u201d prints listed above, like other right\r\nthumb prints ascribed to \u201c Walter \u201d, are identical with \u201c Kerwin\u2019s \u201d\r\nright thumb.\r\n2. Examples obtained in the London sitting are of further\r\nsignificance in showing that this identity cannot be explained awayon the theory (of Thorogood and others) that Dudley had confused\r\nmaterials in his charge, madvertently or wilfully substituting knownSee Psychic Research, December 1929, and Psychic Science, April 1930.\r\n139] \u201c Walter \u201d Thumbprints of the \u201c Margery \u201d Seances 23\r\n\u201c Kerwiii \u201d prints for the seance productions. Mr Dudley did not\r\nattend the London sitting, nor has he even seen the impressions\r\nthere produced ; these London prints are of authenticated seance\r\norigin\u2014and as noted, the prints are identical with the equally\r\nauthentic reference prints of \u201c Kerwin\r\n3. Thorogood places much emphasis on the core structure of\r\nwhat he terms the \u201c standard \u201d right thumb of \u201c Walter \u201d\r\n; he\r\nasserts that it is not a rod, the rod core being a feature of the\r\n\u201c Kerwin \u201d right thumb. Among the eight \u201c Walter \u201d prints now\r\nreported seven display this rod structure clearly and unquestionably,\r\nwhile the exception (Schiller\u2019s second tablet) bears a core corres- ponding to the \u201c standard \u201d of Thorogood. The distinction of\r\nthis \u201c standard \u201d, however, is merely a mechanical defect in the\r\nprint (as earher shown independently by Dudley and the present\r\nwriter) ; when the core in these impressions does not appear as a definite rod the area at the core head presents a depression in\r\nthe negative imprint, as from the effect of routing. Prof. Schiller\u2019s\r\nthree tablets may be further mentioned in this connection. The\r\nseance origin of these impressions being seemingly clearly established,\r\nit is interesting to note that on three successive days \u201c Walter \u201d\r\nproduced prints m this order ; rod core\u2014core with \u201c routing\r\ndefect \u201d\u2014rod core. The occurrence of a single imprint with such\r\na\r\n\u201c routing defect \u201d might be interpreted as due to some technical\r\nmischance in printing, but since Schiller\u2019s example is but one of\r\nmany \u201c Walter \u201d prints displaying precisely the same defect there seems to be just ground for suspecting the use of artificial dies (see\r\nBull. B.S.P.R., XXII). A die marked by such a defect would\r\nobviously reproduce its imperfection in each printing, just as a\r\nperfect die with an intact rod core would uniformly imprint that\r\nfeature.\r\n4. It is not within the j^rovince of this account to discuss imphcations of the identity of the \u201c Walter \u201d prints. Dingwall ^ has\r\nrecently stated the situation ; \u201c The present controversy is not\r\nso much on the supernormahty of the thumbprints as on then\r\nnature. The material is ah-eady in existence. The prints are here \u201d. The prints speak for themselves in establishing the identification ; a sober view of the case must grant that this is a simple, concrete\r\nissue, and one that cannot be evaded or obscured by fatuous\r\nargument.\r\n^ Light, 29 June 1934.\r\nREVIEW\r\nDR RHINE\u2019S RECENT EXPERIMENTS ON TELEPATHYAND CLAIRVOYANCE AND A RECONSIDERATION OFJ. E. COOVER\u2019S CONCLUSIONS ON TELEPATHY i\r\nBy Robert H. Thouless, Dept, of Psychology, Glasgow\r\nUniversity\r\nDr Rhine\u2019s investigation on telepathy and clairvoyance possesses\r\nseveral distinctive features.^ One of the most startling of his results\r\nis the very large number of successes he had amongst his subjects.\r\nMost of those who believed in the possibility of extra-sensory perception had supjrosed that it was rather a rare capacity. Byretesting his most successful cases, Dr Rhine has obtained so manypositive results that he has comjiletely got rid of the difficulty whichhas often been the bugbear of this kind of investigation, the possibility that a small preponderance of successful results might be\r\ndue to chance. He has evolved new experimental techniques for\r\nthe separate measurement of clairvoyance and telepathy. Mostimportant of all is the fact that his methods are so simple andhis results so clear that his experiments can easily be repeated,\r\nand it will be possible without difficulty for other experimentalists to convince themselves whether Rhine\u2019s conclusions are\r\nvalid or whether they are due to some flaw m his experimental\r\nmethods.\r\nDr Rhine himself is inclined to protest against the idea that\r\nevery new investigator in this field must set himself afresh the task\r\nof proving the reality of extra-sensory perception, instead of being\r\nallowed to consider that the matter has already been proved bypast researches. It must be remembered, however, that even\r\nif the possibility of extra-sensory perception has already been\r\ndemonstrated, (which, whether rightly or wrongly, is by no\r\n1 Read at a private Meeting of the Society, 30 January 1935.\r\n1 Extra-Sensory Perception, J. B. Rhine, Boston Society for Psychic Research,\r\n1934, 169 pp. 24\r\n[part 139] Review 25\r\nmeans universally admitted) yet past experimentation seems to\r\nindicate that the capacity is rather rare, so that any particular case of extra-sensory perception is still improbable and must\r\nbe examined very critically before it is admitted. This is particularly the case when we bear in mind how often flaws of\r\nexperimental technique have led to mistakes in this field in\r\nthe past. In any case, such a novel claim as that of measurable\r\ntelepathic and clairvoyant capacity in as many as one in three\r\nor four persons must be regarded as intrmsically very improbable, by no means to be rejected if it is scientifically proved,\r\nbut as making necessary a very critical examination of the\r\nprocedure by which it is claimed to be proved and its careful\r\nverification by other workers. If Dr Rhine\u2019s results were established, it would make a revolutionary change in our attitude\r\ntowards this subject, bringing us near to S. G. Hall\u2019s ideal\r\nthat telepathic phenomena should be reproducible at will at any\r\ntime in any laboratory.\r\nDr Rhine gives a summary of previous work in supjDort of his\r\ncontention that extra-sensory perception has been already proved.\r\nAmongst other investigations he quotes that of Coover ^ as providing\r\npositive evidence of extra-sensory perception. Since it is a common\r\nopinion that Coover\u2019s results were entirely negative and show\r\nnothing but chance distribution, I have thought it worth while to\r\nre-examine Coover\u2019s figures and will discuss these before proceedmg\r\nwith Rhine\u2019s own work.\r\nRhine is undoubtedly right in saying that Coover\u2019s results\r\nactually show strong evidence against chance. There seem to have\r\nbeen two reasons why Coover himself drew the opposite conclusion :\r\nfirst, he adopted an absurdly high limit for the deviation from\r\nmean expectation which might be attributed to chance, and,\r\nsecondly, he did not consider the possibility that clairvoyance\r\nmight be active where telepathy was impossible.\r\nIn what follows I am considering only the results that he obtained\r\nwith 10,000 guesses by 100 students of 40 playing cards (a pack\r\nwithout court cards) in wRich alone there w^ere sufficient observations for statistically valid conclusions to be drawn. These were\r\ndivided into two approximately equal groups : one in which the\r\ncard drawn had not been seen by the experimenter when the subject\r\nguessed, and one in which it had. Coover, looking only for effects\r\nof telepathy and not for those of clairvoyance, treated the first group as a control group in which the effect looked for was not\r\n^Experiments in Psychic Research, J.

Monog. no. 1, 1917, pp. xiv -1-641.\r\n26 Revieiv [part\r\npresent and in which, therefore, chance factors alone were operating.\r\nThe following are Coover\u2019s results :\r\nCard. Colour. Number. Suit. Card not seen Observed 141 2,491 488 1,252\r\nTotal 4,865 Expected 12U 2,4321 4861 1,216\r\nDifference + 19| + 581 + U + 36\r\nCard seen Observed 153 2,556 538 1,344\r\nTotal 5,135 Expected 1281 2,5671 5131 1,284\r\nDifference + 241 -iH + 241 + 60\r\nThe general tendency of both of these series is clearly to exceed\r\nmean chance expectation, and in approximately equal amormts.\r\nCoover concludes that since the factor of telepathy cannot be\r\npresent in the first series, the approximate equality of the two\r\ngroups is due to the fact that the deviations of both are due to\r\nchance. A safer conclusion would seem to be that if any factors are present causing deviation from expectation, these are operating in\r\napproximately equal amounts in the two conditions of experimentation. At any rate, we shall be justified in lumping the two\r\ngroups together for statistical consideration. For the remainder\r\nof the discussion of these results, I shall do this since it will give us\r\nthe advantage of the higher significance to be obtained by larger\r\nnumbers.\r\nThe result of throwing the two groups together is as follows :\r\nCard. Colour. Number. Suit. Total 10,000 Observed 294 5,047 1,026 2,596\r\nExpected 250 5,000 1,000 2,500\r\nDifference + 44 + 47 + 26 + 96\r\nProbability of chance occur- rence of difference \u2022005 \u20224 \u20224 \u2022025\r\nIn statistical enquiry, chance is generally regarded as sufficiently\r\nexcluded if the odds against the chance occurrence of a result are\r\nfifty to one. If the odds against chance are greater than this we\r\ncan conclude that the residt is indicated with sufficient probability\r\nfor rational acceptance, although of course our degree of conviction\r\nwill be greater if the odds against chance are heavier. If, however,\r\nthe conclusion to be established is a negative one, we shall not\r\nconsider the absence of an effect sufficiently indicated unless the\r\nobserved result would follow from chance alone at least once in\r\nten times. If the odds against chance lie between 10 to 1 and\r\n50 to 1, the results are to be regarded as inconclusive and must be\r\nrepeated until there is a definite indication one way or the other.\r\n139] Revmv 27\r\nThe difference between observation and mean chance expectation\r\nof the number of cards guessed altogether right by Coover\u2019s subjects\r\nshows a probability of chance occurrence very much below this\r\nlimit, being 200 to 1 agaiust. The existence of some factor favouring\r\ncorrect guessing of the cards is strongly indicated. It might be\r\nobjected that any form of extra-sensory cognition is a priori so improbable that we shall be right to insist on a much more severe\r\ncriterion of significance than we should need, let us say, if we were\r\ntryiug to investigate the difference in fertihty of manured and\r\nunmanured fields. To this objection, there are two replies. First,\r\nthe question at issue is not, at the moment, whether or not extrasensory cognition occurred amongst Coover\u2019s subjects but whether\r\nthere was a factor in his experiments favouring correct guessing\r\n(such a factor might be some unnoticed error of method). There seem to be no grounds for regarding the presence of such a factor as very improbable. A much more important consideration,\r\nhowever, is that if we are convinced of the a priori improbability\r\nof extra-sensory cognition, that will be a sound reason for accepting\r\nthe indications of a 200 to 1 odds against chance with less conviction\r\nthan we should otherwise feel ; it is no reason at all for regardmg\r\nheavy odds against chance as evidence in favour of the operation\r\nof chance.\r\nCoover\u2019s conclusion is, however, not a verdict of \u201c not proven \u201d. His conclusions are definitely negative : \u201c That various statistical\r\ntreatments of the data fail to reveal any cause beyond chance\r\noperating for R cases (p. 123). . . . That no trace of an objective\r\nthought-transference is foimd either as a capacity shared in a low\r\ndegree by our normal reagents ... or as a capacity enjoyed in\r\nperceptible measure by any of the individual normal reagents\r\n(p. 124).\u201d These uncompromisingly negative conclusions are most\r\ncertainly not warranted by Coover\u2019s data. It is true that he considered only the evidence from the cards seen by the experimenter since\r\nthese alone provided evidence for telepathy, but the odds against\r\nchance for correct guessing of the whole card in these experiments\r\nalone was about 30 to 1, which also cannot reasonably be regarded\r\nas evidence in favour of the chance explanation.\r\nCoover does, however, also submit his result to statistical analysis\r\nbut makes the excessive requirement that a result shall only be\r\ndeemed valid if the probabihty of it not occurrmg by chance exceeds\r\n0-9999779, i.e. the odds against chance are about 50,000 to 1. For this, as Coover calculates, it would have been necessary to\r\nhave had 316 successes in the 100,000 trials instead of the 294\r\nactually observed. If the same ratio of success had been main-\r\n28 Review [part\r\ntained, the required level of significance would have been reached\r\nif the number of tests had been rather more than doubled. Coover\u2019s\r\nfailure to go on is remarkable ; particularly his failure to make\r\nfurther tests with those subjects scoring most highly above chance\r\nexpectation. His negative conclusion is indefensible on his own\r\nevidence. How can one conclude from a probability of 200 to 1 against a chance explanation of the observed deviations that \u201c no\r\ntrace of an objective thought-transference is found \u201d ?\r\nI have dealt only with those guesses in Cfiover\u2019s results which\r\nwere completely right\u2014in colour, number and suit\u2014since these\r\nalone show a high significance. That there is a lower degree of\r\nsignificance discernible in the results calculated separately for colour,\r\nnumber and suit is of no importance since we find that this is simply\r\ndue to the fact that if we eliminate those cases in which the card\r\nwas guessed completely right, the remaining cases for colour,\r\nnumber and suit, show only chance distribution.^ That is, whatever\r\ncapacity the subjects had for guessing right, when it operated at\r\nall, led to complete knowledge of the card and at other times all characters of the card were merely guessed at random. This is what the modern ex]3erimental psychologist would expect. Wedo not supj^ose that the recognition of a card involves separate\r\nacts of perception involving colour, number and suit whose simultaneous activity gives comjjlete knowledge of the card, but rather\r\nthat total recognition of the card is a unitary process.\r\nThis leads to a principle of experimentation which it is well to\r\nbear in mind. The general prmciple suggested is that whatever\r\ncharacter is used in this sort of experimentation, should have a mean chance expectation not so large that the exj:)ected chance\r\ndeviations from it will be big enough to swamp the deviations due\r\n^ Proof. Let us suppose that the 294 cards guessed completely right are made uj) of some number x known (by E. S. P. or otherwise) to the subject\r\nand 1\/40 of the remainder guessed right by chance ; x will then be 45, the mean chance expectation from the remaining 9,955 being 249 (to the nearest whole number). The 45 known altogether correctly wiU, of course, be right\r\nin colour, number and suit. Of the remaining 9,955, the following are the\r\nnumber of right guesses of these characters observed and expected :\r\nColour. Number. Suit. No. expected - - 1,977^ 9954 2,489\r\nNo. observed - 5,002 981 2,551\r\nDeviation - + 244 -144 + 62\r\nProb. of dev. - \u20226 \u20226 \u202215\r\nIn no case is the jjrobability of the deviation occurring by chance less than\r\none-tenth, so the results are consistent with all the observed successes (other\r\nthan the 45 completely right) being due to chance.\r\n139] Revietv 29\r\nto the cause under investigation. 50 successes above expectation\r\nin 10,000 would, for example, be clearly significant in a character\r\nwhose mean chance expectation was 250, b\\it would be quite\r\ninsignificant in one whose mean chance expectation was 50,000.\r\nThis means also that it is inadvisable to try to calculate a single\r\nindex (as has sometimes been done) taking into account successes\r\nin different characters with different mean chance expectation, since\r\nthis may result in the swamping of real successes by chance deviations.\r\nRhine mentions that those subjects of Coover\u2019s who did well in\r\nthe telepathy experiments also did well in the others (clairvoyance\r\nconditions). If there were a significant relationship, this certainly\r\nwould be an important finding. It does not appear, however, that\r\nthe relationshi]) is any greater than might result from chance.\r\nIt is true that the one individual who did best in one set of experiments also did best in the other set, but if we work out a correlation\r\nfor the whole group or for the best eleven subjects, the correlation\r\nis found to be -1 in both cases, and is quite insignificant.\r\nRhine says that most of the correct guesses in Coover\u2019s experiments were made by a small number of people and that, if the answers of this small number are considered separately, they\r\nbecome enormously significant. It is, however, clearly illegitimate\r\nto select the best answers and then treat them by a method of\r\ncalculation appropriate to an imselected sample. We can, however,\r\ncompare the individual sets of guesses in which 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., are\r\nright and compare it with the frequencies with which these would\r\nbe expected on the hy]3othesis of chance distribution. This will\r\nbe a more sensitive method of detecting a tendency to guess right\r\nwhich is found in only a few individuals, than will be the method\r\nwhich uses the mean obtained from the whole group.\r\nThe expected di.stribution on the chance hypothesis is that\r\ngiven by the terms of the expansion of 100 x (39\/40-1- 1\/40)^\u201c\u00b0.

Also it is to be noticed\r\nthat the improbability of a chance explanation is seen to be greater\r\nby this method of examining the results. One individual, for\r\nexample, has 11 right and the odds against this one case alone\r\noccurring by chance amongst 200 subjects are more than 200\r\nto 1. This table of frequencies suggests that about six of Coover\u2019s\r\nhundred subjects had measurable power of exceeding chance\r\nexf^ectation in the guessing of playing cards. If extra-sensory\r\ncognition is at work here, the number is greater, I think, than would\r\nbe commonly supposed although much below the number indicated\r\nin Rhine\u2019s exj:>eriments. There is some indication that whatever\r\npower is measured may be widely diffused to a small extent, since\r\nit is to be noticed that not only are there individuals guessing far\r\nmore right than is to be expected on the hypothesis of chance, but\r\nalso that the number guessing none right and one right is considerably less than to be expected from chance. The observed distribution is below expectation at the low end as well as above expectation at the high end. This is not merely the result of the fact that\r\nthe total number distributed on the curve of chance is decreased by\r\nthe few that have the power of guessing right to a marked degree,\r\nsince this number appears to be about six, and if the chance distribution were calculated for the remainder, it would mean only\r\nthat each of the \u201c expected \u201d values was reduced by 6 per cent,\r\nwhich would still leave the zero end of the observed curve below\r\nexpectation. Unfortunately, however, the number of cases is not\r\nlarge enough for it to be certain that this lowering of the zero end\r\nis significant. We can only say that the curve as it stands suggests\r\na fairly wide distribution of a tendency to guess correctly in addition\r\nto a well marked tendency in a small number of subjects.\r\nThe observed distribution is definitely not consistent with an\r\napproximate equality of the tendency amongst all subjects, since\r\nif we calculate the expected distribution about the observed mean\r\nof 2-94, there are still significantly more high values than would\r\nbe ex]3ected (the odds against the occurrence of the one case of 11\r\nwould, for example, stiU be fifty to one on this assumption).\r\nWhat is definitely proved, therefore, is that some subjects are guessing more often right than is to be expected on the hypothesis\r\nof chance. The indication is that the number possessing to a marked\r\ndegree this ability (whatever it may be) is about six. There is also a possibility that the same ability may be present to a smaller\r\ndegree amongst a larger number of the subjects.\r\n130] Eeview 31\r\nCoover\u2019s results, then, do not show chance distribution. Do they\r\ncontribute positive evidence for extra-sensory cognition ? The\r\nresults may be due to this or to some uncontrolled error in Coover\u2019s\r\nexperimental conditions. If he had not been misled by the use of a too severe criterion of significance, he would presumably have\r\nscrutinised and stiffened up his conditions to see whether the\r\neffect would disappear. Presumably also he would have gone on\r\nwith the experiment imtil the probability against chance was\r\neven greater than it is. If we think that the existence of extrasensory perception is probable on other grounds, we may regard\r\nthis as the most likely explanation of Coover\u2019s results ; as independent evidence they are not of much value. Certainly they leave the\r\nfield open for a reinvestigation of the possibility of demonstrating\r\ntelepathy amongst normal people by card-guessing experiments.\r\nOne of the most important changes that Ehine makes in method\r\nis the abandonment of playing cards as material and the substitution\r\nof a set of five kinds of cards suggested by Dr Zener showing respectively a star, a circle, a rectangle, a cross and two parallel wavy\r\nlines. A pack is composed of five of each of these, 25 cards altogether. There is a possibility that the greater ease with which he\r\ngot positive results than other experimenters using playing cards\r\nis due to the superiority of these cards for this purpose. They are, for example, much more easily imaged than playing cards. Also,\r\ninstead of relyhig on average results for the large group of miselected\r\nsubjects, he selected those subjects for further investigation who\r\ndid well in preliminary tests. This method would, I think, be used\r\nby any reasonable investigator who wanted to give extra-sensory\r\nperception the best opportunity of demonstrating its existence.\r\nAlso he has devised methods for demonstrating telepathy and\r\nclairvoyance either together or separately. If the experimenter\r\nlooks at a card, the subject may be guessing it correctly either by\r\nclairvoyance or telepathy. If neither experimenter nor subject looks\r\nat the face of the card, the subject is presumed to be getting it by\r\nclairvoyance. If the experimenter thinks of a card and the subject\r\nguesses it, it is presumed to be guessed by telepathy. The only\r\ndoubtful point here seems to be the demonstration of pure clair- voyance. If a card can be guessed correctly without either experimenter or subject having seen its face, obviously somebody must\r\nbe clairvoyant, but why the subject ? Is it not possible that the\r\nexperimenter knows it by clairvoyance and the subject gets it from him by telepathy ? This is a serious consideration when the\r\nattempt is made to demonstrate pure clairvoyance at a great\r\ndistance. It seems more probable that the sidjject will be able to\r\n32 Review [part\r\nestablish the necessary rapport with a mind many miles away than\r\nwith a pack of cards, and if the experimenter is present with the pack\r\nof cards, his clairvoyance seems more likely than the subject\u2019s.\r\nWe can best illustrate the kind of results obtained by taking a few typical results. The following are the results obtained with\r\nthe subject Pearce up to\r\nClairvoyance (removing\r\ncards) - - -\r\nthrough \u201d the pack) - Pure telepathy -\r\n1 August 1933 (p. 85) :\r\nTrials. Correct.

The last column shows the ratio of the deviation from\r\nmean chance expectation to its own probable error, and is thus a measure of significance. The smallest of these ratios (9-5) means\r\nodds against chance of over 1,000,000,000 to 1 ; the others even\r\nhigher. Chance, at any rate, is effectively eliminated.\r\nDr Rhine used an amusing variant of the usual method of experimenting when he asked his subjects to give the cards wrongly\r\ninstead of correctly. Extra-sensory perception was then of course\r\nindicated by a score below instead of above mean chance expectation. An interesting point not noticed by Dr Rhhie is that an\r\nexamination of the results obtained by this method indicates a\r\nfalling below mean chance expectation greater than might be\r\nexpected from the positive scores of the same subject.\r\nLet us suppose that the subject is able by some means (such as E.S.P.) to know 5 of the 25 cards. These he will name correctly,\r\nand of the remaining 20 he will get 4 right by chance, so that his\r\ntotal number right will be 9. Now suppose that he is trying to\r\nname the cards wrongly. On the assumption that he will only be\r\ncertain of naming wrongly the same number of cards as he was\r\npreviously certain of getting right, and that his other answers will\r\nbe right or wrong l)y chance, the number he now gets right will be\r\nfour. Expressing this generally, if he knows m cards and his other answers are random, he will get m-}-(25 \u2014 m)\/5 correct when he is trying to guess right and (25-m)\/5 correct when he is trying to\r\nguess wrong.\r\nNow Pearce is said (p. 40) to have averaged about 10 correct\r\n139] Review 33\r\nwhen trying to guess right and about 2 when trying to guess wrong.\r\nThis gives a much higher value for m in the guessing wrong series\r\nthan hi the guessing right, 15 when guessing wrong and only a little over 6 when guessing right. We must conclude that whereas some\r\ncards are well enough cognised to be correctly named, a much\r\nlarger number are less completely cognised and although the subject\r\ncannot name them correctly, he can perform the easier task of\r\nnaming one of the four kinds that they are not. This is an interesting\r\npoint although, of course, it has no bearing on the main question\r\nof the mode of cognition.\r\nA curious result reported by Rhine is that forcing a subject to\r\ngo on when discouraged by failure seemed to make him score\r\nsignificantly below mean chance expectation. This is odd since\r\nit is, of course, necessary that the subject should have knowledge\r\nof the cards in order to guess below mean chance expectation as\r\nit is to guess above. He is no doubt right to speak of an inhibition\r\nhere. The first experiments reported on p. 62 are not conclusive\r\nsince Rhine made the curious mistake of not cutting the cards\r\nbetween trials, apparently supposing that this would favour correct\r\nscoring. Actually it would favour repetition of previous scores whether high or low,^ and makes the estimate of significance entirely\r\nimreliable. Apparently, however, the later evidence was obtained\r\nimder satisfactory conditions.\r\nOn page 86, a distance experiment is reported with Pearce in\r\nanother building over 100 yards away. In a clairvoyance, experiment with the cards removed from the pack for each guess the\r\nfollowing results were obtained in 12 runs : 3, 8, 5, 9, 10, 12, 11, 12,\r\n11, 13, 13, 12. An average of 9-9 per 25. Dev.\/P.E. is here 12-1\r\nand the odds are many billions against chance. There is also\r\nreported a successful experiment over a distance of 250 miles by\r\ntwo of Rhine\u2019s collaborators. It is not clear, however, whether\r\nthis was properly checked by independent witnesses. Other very\r\nlong distance experiments were unsuccessful.\r\nOne last result may be mentioned. Pearce on one occasion had\r\n25 successive right guesses in pure clairvoyance. The odds against\r\nthis occurring by chance are about 600 billion to 1 . This of course\r\nis no better evidence than what has gone l)efore, but to some it may appear more impressive. Several other subjects gave results\r\nwhich do not quite come up to Pearce\u2019s standard but are also entirely\r\ninexplicable on any chance hypothesis.\r\n^ That is, on the hypothesis that there is a correlation between successive\r\nseries of calls by the same subject. In my own experiments I have found\r\nthat this is not uncommonly the case, c\r\n34 Review [part\r\nWe need say no more abont the possibility of these results being\r\ndue to chance than that it is altogether excluded. Odds of a billion\r\nto one against chance are really no better than odds of a million\r\nto one. This is generally recognised by Rhine himself, although he\r\noccasionally uses phrases which might lead to misinterpretation by\r\nthose not familiar with the limited purpose of statistical tests for\r\nsignificance. For example, on page 67 he says : \u201c This makes the\r\nodds in favour of the E.S.P. factor and against chance away up\r\nbeyond the trillions again and well into the zone of entire safety.\u201d\r\nIt must be remembered that all that a statistical calculation of\r\nsignificance can do is to measure the importance of one and only one\r\nsource of error\u2014the possibility of wrongly concluding that a genuine\r\neffect is ]jresent from a numerical deviation which is merely due\r\nto the chances of samphng. The number of experiments must be\r\nincreased until this source of error is negligibly small compared\r\nwith all other possible sources of error. Beyond that point there\r\nis no further gain in increasing results under identical conditions.\r\nIt would be a very optimistic view of any set of scientific experiments\r\nto suppose that when the chance of being misled by a sampling\r\nerror was reduced to, let us say, 1 in 1,000, it was not negligibly\r\nsmall compared with other sources of error. Yet Dr Rhine went\r\non accumulating results under identical conditions when this source of error was below one in billions. This unfortunate concentration on fantastic anti-chance ])robabilities seems to have\r\nled him into paying quite insufficient attention to reporting the\r\nprecautions taken against other possible sources of error. When we ask whether the experimental conditions were suffi- ciently carefully controlled, we are met with the difficulty that it\r\nis generally quite impossible to discover for any particular experiment what the experimental conditions were. Very commonlythe subject\u2019s guesses were checked after each five guesses. Apparently this means that the subject was told what the correct figure\r\nwas on each of the previous five cards.\r\nThis procedure is oj^en to the objection that the subject\u2019s knowledge of what cards have already been drawn gives him information\r\nas to the changed probabilities of future drawings. Rhine makesthe curious mistake of supposing that this would only be effective\r\nfor the last five and only if they were all of the same suit. Actually\r\nit coidd be effective any time after the first five were checked,\r\nhlxcept in the very improbable case of all of the first five cards\r\nl)eing different (the odds against which are about 15 to 1), it is theoretically ])ossible for the subject to raise his expectation of\r\nchance success by being guided l>y what has already turned up.\r\n139] Review 35\r\nLet us suppose, for example, that one or two diagrams have not\r\nappeared in the first five. If he consistently guesses these dining\r\nthe next twenty, his exjiectation of success during that twenty\r\nwill be five ; this added to the one chance success to be exjiected\r\nduring the first five exposure brings the total number to be expected\r\nliy chance up to six. This, however, is on the supjiosition that\r\nthe suliject is guided by the first hve cards only. In fact, with this\r\nmethod of experimenting, he has additional information from each\r\nsulisequent five, and his expectation of chance success is increased\r\nabove six if he is guided in this way to an amount that is not known.\r\nDr Rhine has other replies to this possible criticism besides the\r\nmistaken one already given. In grajih No. 3 (p. 137), the ratio of\r\nsuccesses by Pearce is shown separately for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.,\r\ncard in the whole series of 25 taken from a total of 1,375 trials by\r\nthis method. This graph shows clearly that even for the first five\r\ncards, no less significant positive results were obtained than for\r\nthe others. Similar curves are shown for some of the other subjects.\r\nThis shows that this factor was not imjjortant for these subjects.\r\nThere remains the possibility that it may have been present for\r\nothers. Unfortunately it is not clearly indicated what series were\r\ngiven by this method, so that for a considerable pro^iortion of the\r\nsubjects tested, there may have been an uncontrolled factor present\r\nwhich might give a spurious indication of E.S.P. It is no doubt\r\nnecessary to keep subjects informed of their success, but it would seem to be a less objectionable way of doing this, simply to tell them when they have made right guesses without informing them\r\nof what the cards were when they guessed wrong.\r\nThis, however, is a less serious objection to the method of checking\r\nby fives than the fact that this seems to be an ideal way of teaching\r\nsubjects to recognise some of the cards from their liacks. This\r\nlast possibility is probably the most serious source of error in Dr\r\nRhine\u2019s experiments. It might lie overcome by having a sufficiently\r\nlarge number of packs and making successive tests of the same\r\nsubject with different packs. Dr Rhine apparently did have more\r\nthan one pack, Init it is not clear how often he took the precaution\r\nof making successive tests of any one subject with different packs.\r\nIt is no answer to this criticism that successful results were obtained\r\nwith some subjects under conditions in which knowledge of their\r\nbacks would have been of no service to them (as, for example,\r\nPearce in the D.T. experiments). This proves that, at lea.st, a few\r\nof his subjects were not succes.sful by this method. Indeed, there seems no reasonable doubt that if the D.T. experiments were\r\ncarried out exactly as described, with adequately shuttled cards\r\n36 Review [partno other explanation than that of clairvoyance is possible. Wehave, however, plenty of other evidence in favour of the view that\r\nextra-sensory perce])tion is to be found as a very exceptional\r\nmental power. The novelty of Dr Rhine\u2019s results lies in his apparent\r\ndemonstration that this power is not uncommon and it is here\r\nunfortunately that his evidence is quite inadequately stated.\r\nThe conclusions as to frequency of the capacity from the data\r\nreported in the present book are summed up as follows in a later\r\narticle.^ \u201c The best results are contributed by eight major subjects\r\nwho showed both clairvoyant and telepathic alhlity, at approximately similar rates of scoring for the two conditions. In addition\r\nto these eight major subjects there were at least ten more minor\r\nsubjects who scored signihcantly high in clairvoyance or tele])athy.\r\nThen there were others, (a majority) among the remaining fifty-nine\r\nsubjects tested who scored at a good rate, but over far too short a\r\nseries to be evaluated. There were only seven failures among those\r\nwho were tried out to the extent of 1,000 trials. ... It is safe to\r\nconclude that extra-sensory perception is not so rare as has been\r\nsupposed, and on the basis of the proportions mentioned above\r\nought clearly to be found in at least one in every four persons, with\r\na higher ratio most probable.\u201d\r\nThis is an extremely important conclusion. It is a pity that the\r\nevidence for it is so inadequately reported that it is quite impossible\r\nto get any idea as to whether the experiments on all of these subjects were carried out under critical conditions. If all or any\r\nconsiderable ju\u2019oportion of them were carried out with packs of\r\nwhich the same suljjects had had previous experience by the method\r\nof checking after each five, the conclusion would rest on a very\r\nuncertain basis.\r\nIf Dr Rhine is to carry general conviction of the truth of his\r\nfinding as to the commonness of extra-sensory perception, it is absolutely necessary that he should state clearly how many of his\r\n18 subjects showing extra-sensory capacity were tested under\r\ncritical experimental conditions. The minimum requirement for a critical experiment would seem to be : (A) that an experiment\r\nin which the card is visible to the subject should never be carried\r\nout by means of a ])ack of which the subject has previously seen the back of each card and been informed as to what was on its face ; (B) the sidqect should not be informed as to what cards have\r\n))een drawn until the whole ])ack is completed ; and (C) the back\r\nof the cards should not be visible to the subject at all unless it is\r\n^ \u201c Telepathy and Clairvoyance in the normal and trance states of a\r\n\u2018 Medium \u2019 \u201d, J.

It is quite impossible to\r\ndiscover from Dr Rhine\u2019s book how much of his evidence is derived\r\nfrom experiments of this kind and it is entirely possible that even though one or two of his subjects had genuine extra-sensory power,\r\nthe others were getting successes through inadequate control of\r\nthe experimental conditions.\r\nAnother important conclusion is that the subjects who are good\r\nat telepathy are also good at clanwoyance to about the same amount.\r\nThe evidence is shown in Table XLI on p. 148. Unfortunately the\r\nevidence is not very good. The table shows results for seven\r\nsubjects (one of the major subjects being omitted) with a correlation\r\nof -75 (calculated by the rank-difference method). Plainly no\r\nconclusion can be drawn from a correlation between 7 subjects.\r\nThe data presented are no more than an indication of a conclusion\r\nwhich may be established by examining a larger number of subjects.\r\nIt will be gathered that Dr Rhine\u2019s procedure is by no means\r\nfree from objection, and that his presentation is open to the much\r\ngraver objection that the experimental methods are quite inadequately reported. This is a pity, since a little more care in reporting\r\nand more careful discrimination between experiments obtained\r\nunder perfect and under imperfect conditions would have made\r\nthis work very much more convincing. It may be that all that\r\nDr Rhine reports is true, but much of his report will not carry much\r\nconviction to those inchned to be sceptical. At least we may say\r\nthat Dr Rhine has shifted the burden of proof on to those who\r\ndeny that extra-sensory perception is a fairly common capacity.\r\nIf his results are to be tested it can only be by repetition of his\r\nexperiments. He has developed an easily applied technique, and\r\nthose who are not convinced may try the matter out for themselves.\r\nIt is to be hoped that there will be many carefully planned repetitions\r\nof these experiments and that the results (positive or negative) will\r\nbe published.\r\nAN APPEAL FOU CO-OPERATION IN FURTHER\r\nILXPERIMENTS IN EXTRA-8EN80RY PERCEPTION\r\nA (iLANCE at Plianlasnis of the Living or tlie earlier Volumes ofProceedings will shew that the Society in its early clays devotedmuch attentioji to experiments in telepathy both wdth assessablematerial, such as hgures and ])laying cards, and with \u201c free \u201dmaterial, in which the relation of success to chance probabilitycould not be exactly evaluated. During the greater part, however,of the Society's existence it seems to have been considered that theC[ualitative analysis applicable in experiments with \u201c free \u201d materialhad advantages outweighing the lack of quantitative precision. Infact the bulk of the experiments recorded between the early daysand the B.B.C. experiment of 1927 (Proc., vol. xxxviii) were with\u201c free \u201d material, as the B. B.C. experiment itself in part was. The results of these \u201c free \u201d experiments were interesting andinstructive, but there are undoid)tedly many persons who are not\r\nimpressed by ex])eriments unless the results are both measurable,\r\nand also obtained under strict test conditions. A return, therefore,\r\nto experiments with assessable material became desirable, andbetween October 1927 and July 1928 Mr S. G. Soal conducted a\r\ncarefully planned series of experiments with a large number of\r\npercipients : see his pa])er on \u201c Experiments in (Supernormal Perception at a Distance \u201d in Proc., vol. xl. About the same time Miss\r\nJephson was conducting experiments in clairvoyance with playing\r\ncards.\r\nThe results in both cases were mainly, if not wholly, negative, and\r\nsuggested a choice between three possible inferences : (1) supernormal ])erce])tion does not occur ; (2) it occurs, but percipients are\r\nso rare that even Mr Soaks widely cast net failed to secure a specimen ; (3) it occurs, but is not amenable to the technique of assessal)le experiments under stilct conditions. The high percentage of success ol)tained by !)] Rhine in the exjxu'iments on which DrThouless comments, suggests that these three possil)le inferences maynot perhaps cover the whole field, and the results obtained in London\r\n[part 139] An Appmlfor Co-operation in Further Experiments 39\r\nby Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell, an experienced investigator, and recorded\r\nin the Society\u2019s Journal for April 1935, point in the same direction.\r\nThe CoTincil consider it im])ortant that there should be further\r\nexperiments (\u00ab) with assessal)le material, [b] under strict conditions,\r\nand (c) in such a form as to distingui.sh between the different types\r\nof extra-sensory perception. The Council have requested Mr Tyrrell\r\nto conduct the new experiments, in which specially designed\r\napparatus will be employed.

I need only refer\r\nhere to the important papers by Sir Ohver Lodge and Mrs\r\nVerrall in volume xxv. of the Proceedings on Mrs Willett\u2019s\r\n\u201c Lethe Scripts \u201d, and to two papers of my own in volumes\r\nxxvii. and xxix. respectively entitled, \u201c Some Recent Scripts\r\naffording Evidence of Personal Survival \u201d, and \u201c The Ear of\r\nDionysius \u201d. The bulk of Mrs Willett\u2019s automatic output is too private for pubhcation. The four papers above mentioned\r\nrelate, how\u2019ever, to matters in the natm\u2019e of episodes, separable\r\nfrom the main themes of the scripts. To a very considerable\r\nextent tliis also apphes to the subject of the present paper,\r\nthough there must still remain withheld from publicity a good\r\nmany passages which I would willingly have quoted by way of\r\nillustration had it been open to me to do so. The materials for the account here presented of the jisychological aspects of IMi-s Willett\u2019s mediumship have been derived\r\nfrom three different sources of information.

The third will occupy our attention later.\r\nThe material here collected is not put forward either to provethe possession of supernormal powers by Mrs Willett or as\r\nevidence of survival and of spirit communication. The possession of supernormal powers I take for granted, nor do I think\r\nanyone will care to dispute it who has read the papers relating\r\nto her scripts that have been already published in our Proceedings. Survival and the possibility and reality of spirit\r\ncommunication are far more debatable questions. My personalbelief, arrived at after much study and reflection, leans strongly\r\nin favoui' of an affirmative answer, and I have argued in this\r\nsense in both the above-mentioned contributions to Proceedings\r\n.\r\nBut 1 wish to make it clear from the outset that to establish\r\nthe reality of such communication is not the object of the present paper. All I ask is that its possibility should for the timebeing be treated as an open question.\r\nIt may be charged against me that in the pages which follow\r\nthe language used is not always consistent with leaving the\r\nquestion open. No doubt for purposes of exposition and theljulk of what I have to say will be descriptive and expository\r\nit is difficult to avoid adopting the dramatic standpoint ofscripts themselves, and speaking of tlie communicators as if they really were the departed sjjirits they profess to be. Sofar as the narrative is concerned, it would be impossible in anyother way to present a faithful picture of the observed andrecorded facts. If elsewhere the language employed seemssometimes to pi'ejudge the issue and undidy to favour thespiritistic interpretation, I can onlj^ say that this was notdone with intention. Convenience and simplicity of expressionmust be my excuse, and I must leave it to the reader to supplywhatever qualifications and reservations he may deem to benecessary.\r\nIt must be remembered that I am not undertaking to produce\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship 45\r\na treatise on mediumship in general, but only a study of the\r\npsychological aspects of mediumship as exemplified in one\r\nparticular case. It would be impossible to do justice to the\r\nargument in favour of spirit communication on the basis of\r\nthe Willett phenomena without violating confidences which\r\nI am bound to respect. That is one consideration that weighs\r\nwith me in leaving this controversy on one side so far as may\r\nbe practicable, but it is not the only one. It seems to me that\r\nan inquiry into the evidence for spirit communication must of\r\nnecessity carry one beyond the province of psychology proper ; and further I hold the view that our ideas concerning \u201c process\r\n\u201d\r\nand the modus operandi of communication need not be seriously\r\nmodified howsoever the controversy be decided. What I mean\r\nby this will be made clearer presently.\r\nFrom the psychological standpoint it is now very generally\r\nadmitted that some sort of mental cleavage exists even in the\r\nnormal individual. In the phenomena of mediumship this\r\ncleavage becomes pronounced. \u201c Supraliminal \u201d and \u201c subliminal \u201d, the conscious and the subconscious self, are terms\r\nwhich have now passed into ordinary usage. They are generally\r\nconceived of as being different levels, or strata, or phases, of one and the same personality. I do not think such descriptions\r\ncarry us very far. What these different elements of personality\r\nreally are, either in themselves or in their relation to each other,\r\nremains a problem as obscure as it is deeply interesting. The\r\nstudy of mediumistic phenomena is no less important for the\r\nelucidation of the problem than is the study of dreams, hypnosis,\r\nhysteria, hallucination, and multiple personality.\r\nThe type of mediumship which has attracted most attention\r\nis that of which Mrs Piper is the most conspicuous example.\r\nThe medium lapses into a state of unconsciousness in which\r\nall sense of her own personality is apparently lost, and her\r\nconscious self is replaced by what claims to be an invading\r\npersonahty from the world of spu\u2019it. Mrs WiUett is perhaps the\r\nmost remarkable instance on record of a difierent type, which,\r\nalthough it has been on the whole less studied, seems to me to\r\nbe of at least equal or even greater interest. The characteristic\r\nfeature in her case is that, unlike Mrs Piper, the automatist\r\nretains a consciousness of self during the whole process of\r\nautomatic production. Orthodox psychology may dismiss her\r\n46 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship [partalleged \u201c communications \u201d as merely subjective in the sense that all the factors producing them are to be found within thepersonality of the medium. To dismiss them as subjective in\r\nany other sense than this is to leave altogether unexplainedthe kind of objectivity that belongs to them by virtue of their\r\nappearing to the medium as communications\u2014i.e. as having their\r\norigin in something not herself. Any hypothesis that providesan adecpiate explanation of the sense of objectivity thataccompanies these communications must, I think, go at least so far as to ascribe them to the activity of some intelligence\r\nsulficiently dissociated from the self that receives them to\r\nproduce in that self the impression that an alien agency is at\r\nwork, even though the two \u201c selves \u201d may normally be unitedto form a single personality.\r\nI believe that interaction between dissociated selves belongingto the same bodily organism does, in fact, go a considerable waytowards explaining the phenomena of Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumship. In some cases it may be the whole explanation. Observe,however, that it does not exclude, but is quite compatible with,\r\nthe rival explanation which regards the communicators as\r\ndistinct individual minds, ^ wholly independent of the mediumand unconnected with her bochly organism, but interactingwith her mind telepathically.\r\nMy own view is that there is truth in both explanations,\r\nthat communications may be received in some cases from adissociated self, in other cases from an external agent, in others,\r\nagain, from both agencies acting in co-operation.\r\nThe distinction between independent minds and temporarilydissociated intelligences or \u201c selves \u201d must, of course, be ofgreat importance from many points of view, and of vast andvital importance if the independent minds are held to be dis-\r\n' Tlie expression \u201c distinct individual minds \u201d covers both incarnate anddiscarnate minds. But so far as Mrs Willett\u2019s automatic jiroductions are concerned it is to all intents and purposes the discarnate that I have here in view. Instances in which it is reasonable to conjecture that her scripts oweanything to information supemormally imparted by or acquired from either the sitter or any other mcamate mind are in my opinion so rare as to be\r\npractically negligible. I believe, however, that they do occasionally occiu- ; and the possibility should never be lost sight of. The existence of telepathic\r\ncommunication between Mrs Willett and Miss Alice Johnson is the subject of the tranco-.script of May 11, 1912, parts of which are quoted on 102 below.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumshiji 47\r\ncarnate spirits. But must distinctions which hold good between\r\nchfferent classes of communicators necessarily imply corre- sponchng chlferences in the modus operandi of communication ? Let A and B be chssociated selves connected with the same\r\nphysical organism, and let C be an independent mind, whether\r\nincarnate or chscarnate. If A or B receive a message from G\r\notherwise than through the recognised channels of sense we call\r\nthe communication telepathic. If A receive a communication\r\nfrom B otherwise than through the recognised channels of sense which appears to A to come from a source other than himself,\r\nby what process is the communication conveyed ? I do not\r\nthink Myers ever sufficiently faced this question. My answer\r\nwould be that here also the process is telepathic ; and that if telepathy be, as I believe it to be, a direct interaction of mind\r\nwith mind, it matters little qua process, whether the communicator be an independent external mind or a dissociated self of the\r\nmechuni. It is this conception of \u201c process \u201d that constitutes\r\nmy justification for suggesting that, as regards the psychological aspects of mediumistic phenomena, at all events in Mrs\r\nWillett\u2019s case,i the question of the reality of spirit communication may, without detriment to the inquiry, be left an open one. In my Presidential Address to the S.P.R. for the year 1906 ^\r\nI put forward the idea that the human individual is an ordered\r\nassociation of psychic units, or centres of consciousness, telepathically interconnected. I cannot pretend that the idea has\r\nmet with any general acceptance. It has, however, received\r\nthe powerful support of Professor William McDougall, who\r\nadopted it in his Presidential Address to the Society for the\r\nyear 1920,^ and has once more emphatically maintained it in\r\nhis Outline of Abnormcd Psychology\r\n\r\nI still look upon it as a\r\n^ The case of Mrs Piper and other mediums of a similar tyjDe raises considerations of a somewhat different order, although here also I see no reason to suppose that there is any essential distinction, so far as process is concerned,\r\nbetween \u201c possession \u201d of the organism by an invading spirit\u2014if such a thing can really take place\u2014and \u201c possession \u201d by a dissociated self ; or that in either case the modus operandi is different from that of the familiar but wholly\r\nmysterious control exercised over the organism by the normal self.\r\n^ See Proceedings, vol. xix ; also an article which I contributed to the\r\nHibbert Jouryial of April, 1913.\r\n^ See Proceedings of the S.P.R. , vol. xxxi.\r\n^ An Outline of Abnormal Psychology, by William McDougall, F.R.S.

To what extent it is either confirmed or invalidated by the accoimt of Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumship given\r\nin the following pages it will be for the reader to judge.\r\nF'or the rest the Willett scripts will be found to provide a\r\nfidler and more ambitious attempt to explain the modusoperandi of communication in her own case than any automatic\r\nproductions with which I am acquainted. Whatever view wetake of the \u201c communicators \u201d, and whatever value we mayattach to their statements, I shall be disappointed if students\r\nof the subject fail to find in some part of the matter now for the\r\nfirst time submitted to them much that is both ilhiminating and\r\nsuggestive.\r\nIn concludiiTig these introductory remarks, let me say that\r\n1 make no attempt in what follows to approach the subject of\r\nmy j)aper from any other than the purely mental standpoint.\r\nFor this 1 offer no apology. I do not contend that the interaction of mind and body has no bearing upon the questions to\r\nbe discussed. But the phenomena with which I am specially\r\nconcerned relate not to the interaction of mind with body, but\r\nto that of mind with mind, and I do not believe that much light\r\nis likely to be thrown upon them by attempts to correlate\r\nthought with brain function. The doctrine of psycho-physical\r\nparallelism 1 am unable to accept in any form.\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nSTAGES OF DEVELOPMENT\r\nIn her early girlhood Mrs. Willett discovered that she possessed\r\nthe power of automatic writing, but, having no one to guide or advise her, she soon gave up the practice of it. In the second\r\nhalf of 1908 circumstances into which I need not enter led to a renewal of her interest in the subject. A correspondence with\r\nMrs Verrall ensued, and in August and September of that year\r\nshe read the then recently published Report by Miss Johnson\r\non Mrs Holland\u2019s script, and felt an impulse to try for scri]A\r\nherself. Of her first essays she gives an interesting account in a\r\nletter to Mrs Verrall dated October 8, 1908 ;\r\nAfter a few feeble attempts [she writes] the script seemed to\r\ncome very rapidly, but it is too definite, and therefore I distru.st\r\nits being from an external source. There are, however, one or two curious points in it (I have torn it all up). What worried\r\nme was the words seemed to form in my brain before the pen set them down, just before, as if tripping on the written word\u2014\r\na\r\nsort of hair\u2019s-breadth beforeness.^ Most are signed Myers or\r\nF. W. H. M., but I can\u2019t say I think them of value. . . .\r\nThe first recorded script dates from October 9, and from that\r\ntime records were regularly kept. We may therefore say that in\r\nthe case of Mrs Willett, as in that of Mrs Verrall, Mrs \u201c Holland \u201d,\r\nMrs Salter, Mrs Wilson and Mrs \u2018 \u2018 King \u2019\r\n\u2019 (Dame Edith Lyttelton)\r\n,\r\nwe have a practically complete history of her mediumship from\r\nits inception onwards. The history of Mrs Willett\u2019s automatic\r\nactivities has, however, a peculiar interest arising from the fact\r\nthat it exhibits a marked course of development not found, or at\r\nleast not found in equal degree, in the scripts of the other five\r\nI have mentioned. The different stages of this development I\r\nwill now try to describe.\r\n^ Compare the experience of a friend of Henry Sidgwick, recorded in Human\r\nrersonality, v'ol. ii., p. 123. 49\r\n50 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'\u2019 s Mediumship [partDuring the first stage the communications reach the automatist when she is alone, and in a condition normal or hardlyto be distinguished from the normal. They take the form ofautomatic script in a hand different from Mrs Willett\u2019s ordinaryhand-writing.^ Biit it does not appear that the act of writingis fully automatic in the sense that the hand seems to be movedfor her by some external influence and without her co-operation\u2014though something of the kind did apparently occur on oneunique occasion (see pp. 123-4 below). According to her ownaccount the words seem to form in her brain \u201c a hair\u2019s-breadth \u201dbefore she sets them down ; biit this does not mean that hermind anticipates the sense of what is coming, but only eachindividual word as it comes. As to her recollection, when thescript is finished, of what she has written, it is not easy to formany ])recise estimate, and probably the extent of it varies considerably. I have no doubt, however, that she remembersmuch more than Mrs Verrall was able to do of her own script(see p. 68 below).\r\nThe second stage begins early in January 1909. Mrs Willetthad been anxious about her son\u2019s health.\r\nI was at dinner, she records, when I felt strong impression ofF. W. H. M. scolding me. I can\u2019t explain\u2014but I felt disapprobation and felt it coming from him, and that he was wishing me toknow that there was no need for any anxiety. I had the impression that he was conveying to me that if I doubted the impression I was receiving I was to try for script after dinner. I wasquite normal. I was silent, I suppose, for a few minutes, but I continued my dinner and later\u20148.40\u2014did try for script, whenthe following came ; \u201c Myers yes write now no cause for any anxiety noneyes let him go back to school no anxiety.\u201d\r\nIn this incident rve have the first attempt to convey a message otherwise than by automatic writing. A more deliberateattempt followed a few weeks later :\r\nJan. 29, 1909 {Script).\r\n. . . Gurney ...

The silent D.I.\r\ndoubtless served to prepare the way for the spoken D.I., but\r\n^ Compare with this the First Holland Report, Proc., vol. xxi., pp. 186, 232,\r\nwhich Mrs Willett had seen.

The reader will understand that I am not thereby\r\nassuming the rightfulness of the claim.\r\n52 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mednimship [pabt\r\nthe spoken D.I. belongs, as we shall see, to a later stage of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe term silent D.I. might be used to cover every kind of\r\nimpression presumably telepathic but not contemporaneously\r\nexternalised either in automatic writing or in automatic speech.\r\nIn practice, however, I shall confine it to definitely worded\r\nmessages, or at least to cases where such messages form part of\r\nthe experience. Impressions of a vaguer character, of which\r\nthere are many varieties ranging from the sense of a \u201c presence\r\n\u201d down to a mere unexplained impulse to action of some kind, are not included under this heading.\r\nMrs Willett\u2019s own account of her experience in two instances\r\nmakes clear the nature of the phenomenon :\r\n{Extract from a letter to Mrs Verrall dated February 18, 1909)\r\nLast night ... I was sitting idly wondering at it all . . . when\r\nI became aware so suddenly and strangely of F. W. H. M.\u2019s\r\npresence that I said \u201c Oh ! \u201d as if I had run into someone\r\nunexpectedly. During what followed I was absolutely normal.\r\nI heard nothing with my ears, but the words came from outside\r\ninto my mind as they do when one is reading a book to oneself.\r\nI do not remember exact words, but the first sentence was \u201c Can\r\nyou hear what I am saying ? \u201d\u2014I replied in my mind \u201c Yes\r\nAgain in a letter received by Mi-s Verrall on September 27, 1909,\r\nwith reference to a previous silent D.I. Mrs Willett writes :\r\nI got no impression of appearance, only character, and in\r\nsome way voice or pronunciation (though this doesn\u2019t mean\r\nthat my ears hear, you know !). That is always so in D.I.\r\n[i.e. in silent D.I.]. I don\u2019t feel a sense of \u201c seeing \u201d, but an\r\nintense sense of personality, like a blind person perhaps might\r\nhave\u2014and of inflections, such as amusement or emotion on the\r\npart of the speaker. If you asked me how I know when E. G.\r\nis speaking and not F. W. H. M., I can\u2019t exactly define, except\r\nthat to me it would be impossible to be in doubt one instant\r\nand with E. G. I often know he is there a second or two before\r\nhe sj:)eaks. ... I then sometimes speak first. ... To me, by\r\nnow, there isn\u2019t anything strange in D.I.s except when I try\r\nto explain anything about them ; then I realise suddenly they\r\nare unusual ! But otherwise it gives me no more sense of odd-\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 53\r\nness to be talking to these invisible people than it does to be\r\ntalking to my son for instance. But I don\u2019t think I mentally\r\nvisualise any sort of \u201c appearance \u201d with regard to them\u2014it\r\nis as \u201c minds \u201d and \u201c characters \u201d that they are to me, and yet\r\nnot at all intangible or not-solid realities. . . .\r\nIt should be noted that these early methods of communication, namely by means of lone scripts or silent D.I.s, have never\r\nfallen into disuse. The further development which we have to\r\ntrace consists in the addition of other and supplementary\r\nmethods.\r\nThe next new departure dates from the time when Mrs\r\nWillett, at the special request of the communicators, consented\r\nto \u201c sit \u201d with another person present\u2014in the first instance with\r\nMrs VerraU, and a little later with Sir Oliver Lodge. At these\r\nsittings both script and D.I.s were produced, but from the nature\r\nof the case spoken D.I.s took the place of silent D.I.s, the\r\nautomatist repeating the message out loud and the sitter either\r\ntaking notes or recording verbatim. As a rule a short introductory script preceded speech, but this ride was not observed on\r\nthe occasion of the first \u201c sitter-sitting \u201d and has been departed\r\nfrom once or twice since. During the period of which I am now\r\nspeaking script written in the presence of a sitter and not\r\nfollowed by a D.I. was also rare, though at a later time it became fairly common.\r\nThroughout the remainder of this paper the term \u201c D.I.\u201d\r\nunaccompanied by an adjective is to be taken as meaning\r\nspoken D.I. Where silent D.I. is meant it will always be\r\nexpressly so described. The use of the term \u201c script \u201d to apply\r\nboth to \u201c lone script \u201d and to script produced in the jmesence\r\nof a sitter is not likely to give rise to confusion. But I must\r\nbespeak the indulgence of my readers if I often employ the con- venient phrase \u201c the scripts \u201d to cover the whole automatic\r\noutput, and not merely that part of it which takes the form of\r\nwriting.\r\nEven more important than the introduction of a sitter, and\r\nclosely connected with it, was a gradually increasing tendency\r\non the part of the sensitive to pass into a condition of \u201c daze \u201d\r\nor partial unconsciousness.^ She had sometinies experienced\r\n^ The comiruinieators claim to have power to induce varying degrees of daze\r\nin the automatist.\r\n54 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part\r\na feeling of daze even when alone and had, with an effort, pulled\r\nherself together in order to avoid \u201c going off.\u201d Failure to\r\nretain normal consciousness would probably make the continu- ance even of script impossible for any length of time, unless\r\nsomeone were there to look after the supply and disposition of\r\nWTiting materials. For the recording of a spoken D.I. the\r\npresence of a sitter is obviously indispensable. I do not suppose\r\nthat Ml\u2019S Willett sitting entirely alone could ever have become a\r\ntrance -medium. This consideration was, 1 believe, the motive\r\nof the communicators in lU\u2019ging her to agree to sittings with an\r\n\u201c experimenter in charge \u201d. At all events, whatever the\r\ninfluences which led to the new departure, they certainly did\r\nnot have their source in Mrs Willett\u2019s normal inchnations. She\r\nwas far from welcoming the experiment of sitting even with a\r\nfriend like Mrs Verrall, still less with Sir Oliver Lodge, whomshe met for the first time on May 17, 1909. Any idea that she\r\nmight lose consciousness in the process would have made her\r\nstill more reluctant.\r\nThe first suggestion of a D.I. in the presence of a sitter (Sir\r\nO. J. L. was mentioned by name) came in a script from Myers\r\nof April 13, 1909, and the exj^eriment was first actually tried\r\non May 21, about five weeks later. The sitter was Mrs Verrall,\r\nand this is her contemporary record of the ?nise en scene : On May 19, 1909, I called on Mrs Willett . . . and had some\r\ngeneral talk. It was arranged that I should see her again on\r\nthe morning of May 21. When I arrived on May 21, she said\r\nalmost at once that F. W. H. M. wanted to speak to me, and\r\nthereupon I was witness of the first \u201c D.I.\u201d in which Mrs Willett\r\nrepeated aloud the impression she received. I had made no\r\npreparations and could only take very brief notes. . . . Mrs\r\nWillett sat at some little distance from me near a table. . . . She\r\nrested her elbows on the table and her face in her hands for a few moments ; then lifted her head, keeping her eyes shut, and\r\nspoke as if in answer to someone, saying that she could hear\r\nand would repeat. She then spoke slowly aloud, without the\r\n\u201c He says \u201d which is characteristic hr later developments, and\r\nwith very much less freedom than I have observed since.\r\nThere is nothing either in this account or in the record of the\r\nD.I. itself to suggest that Mi\u2019s Willett was in anything approach-\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'' s Mediumshi]} 55\r\ning a state of trance, though some abnormality may fairly be\r\nsuspected.\r\nNext day a message came in script from Myers to say that he\r\nwas satisfied with the results obtained, but did not intend to\r\nrepeat the experiment for some time to come. Accordingly no\r\nfurther attempt at a spoken D.I. was made until January 1910.\r\nOn the 27th and 28th of that month, and again on April the 5th,\r\nsittings took place with Mrs Verrall as recorder. No loss of\r\nnormal consciousness is noted by the sitter on any of these\r\noccasions, but towards the end of the first sitting the communicator, addressing the sensitive, says to her, \u201c You are getting\r\ndazed. Don\u2019t be agitated.\u201d Some of the phrases used in the\r\ncourse of the sitting were remembered by Mrs Willett after it was over\u2014a sure indication, in my opinion, that the \u201c dazed \u201d\r\ncondition still fell far short of anything hke deep trance.\r\nThe communicators had several times indicated a desire for a\r\nD.I. with Sir Ohver Lodge. Opportunity was found to satisfy\r\nthe desire in May 1910, when a series of three sittings took place\r\nin his presence (May 1, 6, and 21). In the second and third of\r\nthese an undoubted departure from normality occurred, and\r\nprobably this was the case in the first also, though to a less\r\ndegree. In the second of the series the D.I. is opened by\r\nGurney saying, \u201c Tell Lodge I don\u2019t want tins to develop into\r\ntrance. You have got that, we are doing something new. Then\r\nhe says telepathy \u201d ; and the sitting closes with the following\r\nexphcit statement : \u201cYou can tell Lodge that you are not\r\nunconscious or too dazed to know who you are, what you are, and, as each word comes, what you say. That\u2019s aU. Good-bye.\u201d\r\nI beheve this remark of Gurney\u2019s, though it has only the\r\nauthority of the communicator to vouch for its truth, does\r\nfairly represent the mental condition of the automatist at the\r\ntime. It was a condition of partial trance. And this is con- firmed by what follows. The recorder notes that after the word\r\n\u201c Good-bye \u201d was spoken, \u201c for about a minute Mrs Willett\r\ncontinued wfith her eyes shut. Presently she said, speaking to\r\nherself, \u2018 Pull yourself together and open your eyes and wake\r\nyourself up \u2019. She then came to, and looked about her.\u201d Sir\r\nOhver apparently took this injunction as having been addressed\r\nby the automatist to herself. I think she is only repeating the\r\nwords of Gurney, who retmns, as it were, for a moment in order\r\n5() Psychological Aspects of Airs Willetfs Alediumship [partto bring her back to normal consciousness. Probably we maysee in this incident the rudiments of a waking stage.\r\nTrance is, of course, a difficult term to define, nor is it easy inany given case to determine the point at which partial hasmerged into deep trance. When, however, the communicatorstell us that they do not desire trance in Mrs Willett\u2019s case, wemust recognise that they are using the term in a very narrowand restricted sense. By \u201c trance \u201d they mean trance d laPiper ; and, as vdll appear in the sequel, they are emphatic indistinguishing between Willett phenomena and Piper phenomena. The distinction, as they see it, is so carefully observedthat I doubt whether in the whole of the scripts it would bepossible to find more than one example of the use of the wordtrance to describe the Willett phenomena. I am bound to saythat such a limitation of the term seems to me both inconvenient and misleading. From 1911 onwards I have witnessedmany D.I.s, and I certainly should not hesitate to accept themas belonging to the order of genuine trance.\r\nW\u2019liat 1 have described as the third stage in Mrs Willett\u2019smediumistic development is essentially a period of transition.It begins with the first introduction of a sitter, in May 1909.Its course is a progress towards deeper and deeper trance. It is perhaps rash to try to determine with precision the point atwhich really deep trance makes its first appearance. But ifI were pressed to fix a date I should be inclined to nameSeptember 25, 1910. There had been two long sittings forscript followed by D.I., one on September 22 and another onSeptember 24, with Sir Oliver in charge, at both of which theautoniatist had been in a state far removed from normal. Itwas contrary to the rule laid down by the communicators toattempt D.I. on two days in succession, and the original intention seems to have been that the sitting on the 25th should, inspite of the presence of a recorder, be for script only\u2014probablyfor script unattended by any change of consciousness. At theoutset the autoniatist appeared to be quite normal, but thescript had not proceeded far when signs of trance began to benoticeable. The sitter\u2019s attention was called to what washappening by the communicator himself\u2014in this instance\r\nUO] PsychohyicaJ Aspect\u2019'^ of Mrs Willett's Mediumship o7\r\nGurney. The account of what ensued I quote from Sir Oliver\u2019s\r\nrecord :\r\n[Script]. She is very dazed Look (0. J. L. looked and saw her\r\napparently slightly entranced, so he said, \u201c Ought I to wake her\r\nup ? \u201d)\r\n^\r\n[Script]. I will I don\u2019t want her to develop into a second\r\nPiper\r\n{The way in which the hand imndered over the paper was no^v\r\nreminiscent of Piper conditions. O. J.

New.\r\n{Then Mrs W. ivoke up, or rather went through a quite brief \u201c linking stage \u201d, saying, \u201c He said that\u2019s all now, I\u2019ve\r\narranged it all with Lodge \u201d {waking up more). \u201c Have you\r\nhad a D.I. ? \u201d)\r\n{O.J.L. No, only script.)\r\nWhy do I feel as if I had had a D.I. ?\r\n{0. J. L. I suppose because you were a little more dazed than\r\nusual ; you have done quite a fair amount of script.)\r\n{Mrs W. was now normal. On te.sting her slightly it appeared\r\nthat she remembered none of the script after the early portion.)\r\nIt will be observed that this contemporary record uses language implying that the automatist was only \u201c slightly\r\nentranced \u201d, \u201c a little more dazed than usual \u201d. I suspect that\r\nSir Oliver was misled by his knowledge that the communicators\r\ndid not want \u201c trance Failing\u2014as I think all the investigators at that time failed\u2014to realise that the \u201c trance \u201d which\r\nthey deprecated was hmited to the strictly Piperian variety, he\r\nwould naturally be slow to recognise that, in the wider and more\r\nusual sense of the term, the automatist was deeply entranced\r\nalready. \u201c Slightly entranced \u201d seems a very inadequate\r\ndescription of a sensitive who wakes up in the belief that she\r\nhad had a D.I. when nothing of the kind had happened.\r\nI give for what it is worth the conclusion to which a close\r\nstudy of the Willett scripts has led me. The communicators\r\nmore than once claim that they are putting Mxs Willett through\r\na systematic training in mediumship. I believe that, far from\r\nnot desiring trance in the wider acceptation of the term, they\r\nE\r\n58 Psychological Aspects of 3Irs Willett\u2019s Alediumship [part\r\nwere bent from the outset on ediicating her to become a trancemedium, but a trance-medium of a new kind. The training\r\nprocess had to be gradual, and the word trance was avoided,\r\npai'tly perhaps from fear of alarming her and provoking a\r\nresistance which might frustrate their plans, but also to markthe im])ortance which the communicators attached to the\r\ncontrast between Piper phenomena and the new variety of\r\nmediumship which they aimed at developing.\r\nLet me at this point briefly recapitiilate. In the first period\r\nof Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumship lone scripts were the sole methodof communication. The second period is marked by the introduction of the silent D.I. As a ride no obvious disturbance of\r\nnormal consciousness accomj^anied either of these processes.\r\nIn the third period silent D.I.s and lone scripts continue as before ; but a combination of script and spoken D.I. with a\r\nrecorder XR\u2019esent comes into prominence as something new. In\r\nthe course of these sittings the autoniatist develops a tendency\r\ntowards trance, liardly noticeable at first but becoming progressively more and more marked as time went on. As we have seen, a conchtion of deeji trance was jDrobably\r\nreached for the first time on Sejitember 25, 1910, but only\r\ntowards the end of the scrijit, and no D.I. followed. Betweenthat date and May 24, 1911, only one \u201c sitter -sitting \u201d took\r\n])lace. It resulted in the usual type of combined script and D.I.;\r\nbut so far as can be judged the automatist was not deeply\r\nentranced and there was no waking stage. A condition of deep\r\ntrance maintained tlu\u2019ough both stages of a sitting was not, in\r\nmy opinion, reached until May 24, 1911.\r\nWith the jiossibility of trance communication now firmly\r\nestablished the fourth and final period is entered. After nearly\r\nthree years of training Mi-s Willett\u2019s mediumship has reached\r\nmatui'ity so far as form is concerned. From now onwards no\r\nnew dejiarture of primary imjiortance remains to be noted,\r\nthough there was considerable variety of practice in the emjiloyment of the different forms of communication at chfferent times.\r\nThe combination of trance-script followed by D.I. as initial andsecondary stages of the same sitting is freely resorted to up to\r\nJuly 1912. An interval of u])wards of eighteen months ensued\r\nduring wliich no spoken D.I. was attemjDted. Regard for the\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Medivmship 59\r\nhealth of the medium was probably the determinmg consideration ; for the greater strain on the vitality of the medium\r\ninvolved in spoken D.I. as compared with script is fully recognised by the communicators. To compensate for the temporary\r\nloss of spoken D.I., scripts written in the presence of a sitter\r\nbecome comparatively common. The condition of the automatist during some of these sitter-sittings tends to pass into\r\ntrance of varying depth. The writing is sometimes interrupted,\r\nand the sitter requested to take down a passage from dictation.\r\nA return was made to the regular combination of script and\r\nD.I. (but with occasional interpolation of written passages in\r\nthe D.I.) in February 1914, and use continued to lie made of\r\nthis type of sitting up to August 19, 1915. Since that date there\r\nhas been only one example of it, and its place seems to have\r\nbeen taken by trance -scripts in the presence of a sitter not\r\nfollowed by D.I. I do not think that this change carries with it any important significance. Probably the D.I. condition\r\nimplies, on the whole, a deeper trance than is often reached in the\r\ntrance-script ; but the same ends are served in both, namely (1)\r\nto get rid of the checks and inliibitions of the normal consciousness, and (2) to enable messages to be conveyed to the sitter of\r\nwhich the automatist is to be kept ignorant. I may here add\r\nthat, where these objects are not in view, communications\r\nmade by way of lone scripts do not seem in quality and interest\r\nto fall short of those conveyed in trance.\r\nSome Compaeisons\r\nNo account even of the external characteristics of Mrs\r\nWillett\u2019s mediumship would be complete which failed to note\r\ncertain features that differentiate it from that of mediums of\r\nthe type of Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard. Some of these will\r\nengage our attention more closely when I come to deal with the\r\nphenomena in the light of statements made by the communicators themselves. For the present our concern is rather with\r\nsuch contrasts as are apparent to the observer from outside.\r\nOne obvious point of difference is that Mrs Piper and Mrs\r\nLeonard are essentially trance-mediums, whereas Mi\u2019s Willett\u2019s\r\nautomatic faculty is active in every phase of consciousness\r\nfrom normahty to deep trance. But the most striking\r\nfiO P.si\/chological Aspects of Mrs WiUetf's Mediuniship [part\r\npoint of difference is the absence in Mrs Willett\u2019s case of\r\nanything corresponding to the Phinuii, or the Rector, of MrsPiper, to Ml\u2019S Thompson\u2019s Nelly, or to the Feda of Mrs Leonard.\r\nMrs Willett always appears to be in direct touch with her trancepersonalities, though occasionally one of them may be found\r\nhelping or speaking for another who is represented as less\r\nexjierienced or as having less aptitude for communication. It is true that certain of the trance-personalities of Mrs Piper or Mrs\r\nLeonard, like \u201c G. P.\u201d or \u201c A. V. B.\u201d, or the father and the sister\r\nof Mr Drayton Thomas, also purport to communicate directly\r\nwithout the intervention of a Phinuit or a Feda respectively.\r\nBut here again there is an important distinction. It is Mrs\r\nWillett herself, in propria persona, who is in touch with the\r\ncommunicator. Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard when in trance\r\nseem to lose all sense of their personal identity, whereas, so far as the observer can judge, this is never the case with Mrs\r\nWillett. Her trance sittings abound with remarks describing\r\nher own experiences at the moment, and occasionally she will\r\nmake comments, not always complimentary, on the messages\r\nshe is asked to transmit. The communicator often addresses\r\nher directly, and she him. Even when the communicator,\r\nspeaking in the first person, refers to the automatist as \u201c she \u201d\r\nor \u201c her \u201d, interspersed phrases like \u201c He says \u201d reveal that she\r\nis all the time conscious of herself and of her part as a reporter.\r\niSid^tle questions may no doubt be raised concerning the exact\r\nrelation of the \u201c I \u201d of the Willett scripts to the normal \u201c I \u201d of\r\nthe sensitive ; but any distinction between the two \u201c I\u2019s \u201d\r\ndiscernible to the observer leaves them still both identified with\r\nthe same personality. IVL\u2019s Willett\u2019s trance sittings generally\r\nend in a \u201c waking stage \u201d like Mrs Piper\u2019s. In the waking\r\nstage Mrs Piper regains her consciousness of self, and this, even\r\napart from any change from writing to speech, clearly marks\r\nit off from the stage which precedes it. Mrs Willett, on the other\r\nhand, retains a sense of personality throughout, and in the case\r\nof trance D.I.s, where no change from writing to speech helps to\r\nmark the transition, it is sometimes hard to say just where the\r\nD.I. ends and the waldng stage begins.\r\nAnother point of contrast between Mi\u2019s Willett and professional mediums like Mrs Piper and IVIrs Leonard lies in the\r\nwidely different conditions under which they work. Sitters\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 61\r\nwith Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard have been, from the nature of\r\nthe case, many and miscellaneous ; and the comnnmicators,\r\npurporting for the most part to be deceased relations and\r\nfriends of the sitters, have been correspondingly many and\r\nmiscellaneous. Mrs Willett\u2019s scripts\u2014using that term in its widest meaning to include all her automatic records\u2014have been\r\nproduced in a wholly dissimilar atmosphere. Those who have\r\nactually had sittings with her are very few in number\u2014some half\r\ndozen or so\u2014and, speaking generally, their object has been a\r\npurely disinterested study of what the scripts have to say. In\r\nthis they have been assisted by another and equally small grouj)\r\nof investigators to whom the scripts have been shown. All of\r\nthese are intimately known to the automatist and pledged to\r\nrespect her anonymity, and to treat the records as private and\r\nconfidential except so far as she may decide otherwise. A considerable proportion of her automatic output she has never seen\r\nherself, for records of her trance sittings have been in the past\r\nsystematically withheld from her. Her consent was, of course,\r\nrequired for the publication of the present paper, and many of\r\nthe passages from the scripts quoted or referred to in it have\r\nnever until now come within her conscious knowledge.\r\nAs the number of sitters with Mrs WiUett has been strictly\r\nlimited, so also the personahties professing to communicate\r\nthrough her form a very smaU group. Myers and Gurney were\r\nthe earliest, and for a considerable time the only communicators,\r\nbut certain others have been added since, including Henry\r\nSidgwick, S. H. Butcher, A. W. Verrall, and one whose real\r\nname is concealed from her but whom she knows as the Dark\r\nYoung Man. Some at least of my readers will have no difiiculty\r\nin identifying him. Indeed I should be surprised if ]\\Irs\r\nWiUett herself, to whom the first draft of my paper was shown,\r\nhas not now realized who he is, though she has not volunteered\r\nany statement to me on the subject. Another important figure\r\namong the dramatis personae is that of a lady who died in early\r\nyouth more than fifty years ago. She will be referred to in this\r\npaper as \u201c the young lady in the old-fashioned dress \u201d. Her\r\nfamily name never appears in the scripts, and the normal Mrs\r\nWillett has probably never heard of her existence. These all play their part, not as isolated individuals but as members of a band working together with a common pm\u2019pose. Theii\u2019 co-\r\n02 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'\u2019 s Mediumship [partoperation gives to the Willett scripts a unity which it would beidle to look for in the automatic utterances of Mrs Piper andMl\u2019S Leonard, but which, we are not without ground for behoving, embraces also the scripts of Mrs Verrall, Mrs \u201c Holland \u201d,\r\nMrs Salter, the \u201c Macs \u201d, Mrs \u201c King \u201d and Mrs Wilsond\r\nCombination of Script and D.I. in the same Sitting\r\nThe combination in which D.I. is regularly preceded byscript in the same sitting is pecuhar, so far as I am aware, to\r\nMrs Willett. The presence of a recorder or \u201c experimenter in\r\ncharge \u201d is, of course, a necessary conchtion of the spoken D.I.\r\nBut why should the spoken D.I. be so constantly preceded byscript, and script, when a recorder is present, have been\u2014at\r\nleast during several years\u2014so constantly followed by D.I. ? The combination is not, indeed, absolutely invariable. Thevery first \u201c sitter-sitting \u201d, of May 21, 1909 (see ante, p. 54),\r\nproduced a D.I. without preliminary script ; and there havebeen one or two instances of the same thing since. Of scripts in\r\nthe presence of an investigator in charge and not followed byD.I. there were three cases, and only three, ^ up to dime 1913.\r\nThe first of these was the script written in the presence of 0. J. L.\r\nand quoted on p. 57 above ; in the second case D.I. was not\r\nattempted because on that occasion the medium was judged to\r\nbe physically unequal to the strain ; the tliird case was a\r\ndeliberate experiment in which the automatist was expressly\r\ninstructed to try for a script in my presence without going into\r\ntrance.^ It is true that from June 1913 onwards the rule was so\r\nfar relaxed as to admit of sitter-sittings, which resulted in script\r\nwithout D.I., although mixed, it might be, with occasional\r\npassages of dictation. But why was the combination of script\r\nfirst and then D.I. so long and, on the whole, so consistently\r\nmaintained ? What purpose, if any, did it serve ? That the communicators attached some importance to the\r\n^ To this list may be added Mr and Mrs Kenneth Richmond, from whom\r\nscripts have been received from time to tune since 1919.\r\n^ I do not here include two earlier scripts written in the presence of the\r\nautomatist\u2019s jnother, and one wi\u2019itten in the presence of her husbaml on December 24, 1911. For this last see below, p. 75.\r\n\u00ae See below, p. 75.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019\u2019 s Alediumship 68\r\nrule during the earlier years of Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumship is proved not merely by the strictness with which it was observed,\r\nbut by sundry passages in the scripts themselves. Thus on\r\nMarch 10, 1910, Gurney writes : \u201c Tell Mi\u2019s Verrall I want her\r\nto try another D.I. with me some day via you of course to open\r\nwith script Again on May 1, 1910, at a sitting with Sir\r\n0. J. L. present, Myers writes : \u201c Try for a D.I. and come back\r\nto Sc if I tell you \u201d. But the most explicit statement on the\r\nsubject is contained in a lone script of July 22, 1911 :\r\nTell Gerald I want to experiment upon one pomt I want to\r\nfind the proper balance between Sc. and D.I. proper what I mean is I want to find out the connection\u2014not the word I want\r\nbut let it stand between the state [sic] of Sc\u2014 I am speaking\r\nof the Sc which is the initial stage of I) I proper\u2014and by D I proper I mean the spoken words\u2014the stage of Sc and the stage\r\nof D I It may be said that in one case the impression externalises itself by the hand and in the other case by the voice\r\nBut that is not the way it looks to me from here I want to\r\nspeak of this later My present point is to note that I must\r\nexperiment to find the balance What amount of Sc facilitates\r\nthe emerging into the secondary stage viz D I\u2014and what\r\namount of Sc\u2014at what point does the continuance of Sc make\r\nthat emerging difficult or delayed the relation which the\r\nproportion of Sc bears to the secondary stage Say that that is nearer it Without experiment nothing can be learnt I want\r\nto experiment in several directions and this is one of them.\r\nIt is evident from this extract that the experiments in which\r\nthe communicators were engaged were experiments relating to\r\nmethod. No doubt is cast on the utility of the combination.\r\nBut the initial step, that of script, is treated as subordinate to\r\nthe second stage, that of D.I. The centre of interest is the D.I.\r\nas an instrument of communication. From the point of view of\r\nmethod the chief use of preliminary script is to lead up to D.I.\r\n\r\nto \u201c facilitate its emergence \u201d. The thing of real value is the\r\nD.I. itself. That this was the view actually held by the communicators\r\nup to the date of the extract is confirmed by an examination of\r\nthe previous sitter-sittings, whether we consider the relative\r\nlength of the two stages or the matter contained in them. In\r\n()4 Psychological Aspects of Airs Willett's Alediumship [part\r\nevery case save one the scrij)t-stage had hitherto been relatively\r\nshort and the D.l. stage relatively long\u2014often as much as ten\r\ntimes as long as the other. In the one exceptional case (of\r\nFebruary 9, 1911) when the sittings opened with a fairly long\r\nand interesting script, the D.l. seems to have suffered, for it was short and comparatively unimportant.\r\nSimilarly as regards content ; the short preliminary scripts\r\nhad in almost every case been concerned with matters of secon- dary importance\u2014brief conversations with the sitters, instructions with respect to future sittings, the dates at which they were to be held, the length of time which they were to last, and\r\nso forth. Communications of sidistance were for the most part\r\nreserved for D.L, and with the change from writing to speech\r\nthere iisually came a change of subject also.\r\nI think the evidence leads to the conclusion that so long as the trance condition even in the D.L was imperfect, in the\r\npreliminary script it was lighter still. 1 suggest two possibilities : ( 1 ) that the lighter stage may have been used in order to\r\ninduce the deeper stage ; (2) that it may have been intended to serve the further purjDose of helping to keep Mrs Willett\u2019s\r\ntrance within the limits aimed at by the communicators, and\r\nsecure it from any danger of passing into the Piperian variety\r\nin which the normal consciousness is entirely submerged and its place taken by what purports to be a wholly different personality.\r\nIf these conjectures are well founded, the utility of the\r\nmethod may have continued even after the achievement of\r\ndeep trance in both stages, of which I count the sitting of May\r\n24, 1911, to be the first example. But not long after that date,\r\nand possibly as a result of the experiments referred to in the\r\nextract quoted above, the stage of jDreliminary script began to\r\nassume greater importance and extend to greater length. It is more and more used for the conveyance of messages of a kind\r\nformerly reserved for the D.l. stage, and the distinction of\r\nsubject-matter as between the two stages becomes less frequent.\r\nUltimately, as we have already remarked, this general\r\ntendency developed into a real change of practice. The rule of\r\n\u201c No D.L without preliminary script \u201d continued to be observed,\r\n(hi the other hand sitter-sittings at which script alone, or a mixture of script and dictation, was produced became common.\r\n140] Psychological As^jects of Mrs Willett's Alediimiship 65\r\nIn some of these sittings the autoniatist was practically normal\r\nthroughout, in others she seemed to pass gradually into trance ; in others again the trance, so far as one can judge, was fully\r\nestablished from the outset. Nevertheless the combination\r\nof script and D.I. has never been definitely abandoned,\r\nthough it became very rare as the years went on. It represents,\r\nI believe, for the communicators the high-water mark of\r\nsuccessful method in communication. Throughout what I have\r\ncalled the fourth period of Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumship a deep\r\nform of trance is its invariable characteristic.^ There are indications that it was the method preferred by the communicators for all messages which it was desired to withhold from the\r\nnormal consciousness of the autoniatist. On the other hand\r\nthe strain imposed upon the autoniatist by D.I. in the presence\r\nof a sitter is admittedly greater than that involved in other\r\nprocesses. 2 It was this consideration, I suspect, coupled with\r\na growing experience of trance-script not followed by D.I., and\r\nthe realisation by the group on the other side that it might be\r\nmade to serve their purposes almost as well as D.I. itself, that\r\nled in the end to the nearly complete disuse of the combination.\r\n^ In making this statement 1 do not count the sitting of December 17,\r\na.s falling imder the description of combined script and D.I. The long dictated\r\npassage in that case is altogether sui generia. It does not seem to have been\r\nregarded as a D.I. by the communicators themselves. See below, j:). 69.\r\n- There was a wide gap in the production of D.l.s, extending from July 6, 1912, to February 28, 1914, which is probably to be accounted for by reasons connected with the health of the medium at the time. It was certainly not\r\ncaused by lack of ojjportunities, for there were seven or eight sitter-present\r\nsittings held during the same interval.\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nCPvITERIA OF THE DIFFEPvENT STATES OF\r\nCONSCIOUSNESS\r\n( a) Memory of Message received\r\n( b ) Indications from HANDMMtiTiNG\r\n(c) Externalisation of Presences\r\n( d) Indications from the Waking Stage\r\nMy paper on The Ear of Dionysius contains a brief statement\r\nconcerning the different psychical conditions in which the\r\nWillett scripts are produced. This statement is not exactly\r\nwhat I should make to-day in the light of fuller experience and\r\nfurther study of the subject. I then wrote : \u201c Many of these\r\n[scripts] are written when the antoniatist is alone, awake, and\r\nfully aware of her surroundings. The remainder, produced in\r\nthe presence of a \u2018 sitter \u2019, fall mainly into two classes. Either\r\nthe antoniatist is in a normal or nearly normal state of consciousness, much as when she writes scripts by herself, or else\r\nshe is in a condition of trance. There have been a few intermediate cases, when it is hard to say whether the sensitive is in\r\ntrance or not. But these are a very small number : in general\r\nthere is no difficulty whatever in distinguishing.\u201d\r\nApart from the fact that in this statement I do not distinguish between script proper and D.I.\u2014the distinction being\r\nirrelevant to my purpose at the moment\r\n\r\nI should not now say\r\nthat the intermediate cases are very few in number, or that in\r\ngeneral there is no difficulty in determining how any given\r\nscript should be classified. The modifications of consciousness\r\nexemplified in Mi\u2019s Willett\u2019s jihenomena range over the whole\r\nscale from practical normality through partial trance to deep\r\ntrance. Her automatic productions may be conveniently\r\narranged into classes corresponding to these three descriptions\r\nof mental conchtion. But it must be reahsed that no clear line\r\nof demarcation separates them : the first shades into the second\r\n66\r\n[part 140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019 s Mediumship 67\r\nand the second into the third. Extreme cases at either end of\r\nthe scale can, of course, be readily classified. Silent D.I.s and\r\nlone scripts may all be placed in the nearly normal class.\r\nSimilarly it is, in my opinion, safe to say that all D.I. sittings\r\nsubsequent to that of May 24, 1911, are of the deep trance\r\norder. On the other hand D.I. sittings before that date, and\r\nsitter-sittings without D.I. of a subsequent period, are often\r\nnot easy to place, and even in the course of the same sitting\r\nthere may be changes from one state to another. The line is often hard to draw, and I have to confess that in several cases\r\nI have felt constrained to draw it differently at different times.\r\nWhere the question is of just a little more or a little less, clearcut conclusions are best avoided. One has to be content with\r\ngeneral impressions and a considerable margin of uncertainty.\r\nGood indications may be gathered from the external demeanour\r\nand appearance of the medium when at work, especially by noting\r\nthe expression of her face, whether she keeps her eyes open or\r\nshut, and how far she requires assistance from the sitter in the\r\nmanagement of pencil and paper. But there are other signs and\r\ntokens which have a psychological interest of their own ; and\r\nin what follows I propose to examine certain of these at some\r\nlength, choosing my illustrations as far as possible from records\r\nwhich may at the same time help to give an idea of the more\r\nstriking characteristics of Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumistic activities.\r\n(a) Memory of the Message received\r\nSilent D.I.s, unless they are written down at the actual\r\nmoment of reception, which hardly ever occurs in Mrs Willett\u2019s\r\ncase, can, hke ordinary dreams, only be recorded from memory.\r\nIn scripts and spoken D.I.s, on the other hand, we have a con- temporaneous record which can afterwards be compared with\r\nthe recollections, if any, of the content of the messages con- veyed. Power to recall such content, or any part of it, after the\r\nsitting is over is an important test of the state of consciousness\r\nof the automatist during the sitting. It definitely rules out the\r\ncondition of deep trance. But even complete amnesia of the\r\ncontent of messages caimot, in my opinion, be taken as proof\r\npositive of deep trance. In Mrs Willett\u2019s case it probably\r\nalways imphes some degree of trance, but this is not true of ail\r\n68 Psychological As'pects of Mrs Willett's MediumsMp [part\r\nautomatists. IVIrs VerraU\u2019s automatic writing, for instance,\r\nclearly belongs to the nearly normal type. Yet so far as her\r\nexperience in script-production is concerned this is how she\r\ndescribes her first successful attemifis : ^ \u201cI was writing in the\r\ndark and could not see what I wrote ; the words came to me as\r\nsingle things, and I was so much occupied in recording each as\r\nit came that I had not any general notion of what the meaning\r\nwas. I could never remember the last word ; it seemed to\r\nvanish completely as soon as 1 had written it.\u201d And again : \u201c After the first two or three times of writing I never read what\r\nhad been written till the end, and though I continued to be\r\naware of the particular word, or perhaps two words, that I was\r\nwriting, I still retained no recollection of what I had just\r\nwritten and no general notion as to the meaning of the whole.\u201d\r\nObviously IVIrs Verrall, when she sat for script, was aware\r\nthat she was writing, was aware of her sensations during the\r\nprocess, and conscious of what was happening round her. All\r\nthis she remembered. The failure of memory applies only to\r\nthe content of her script. Even this degree of amnesia, limited\r\nas it is, does not seem to be experienced to anything like the\r\nsame extent by Mrs Willett in the production of her lone\r\nscripts, though I would not go so far as to say that it never\r\noccurs. But in her sitter-sittings the case is rfifferent. Thus in\r\nan early D.I. (May 6, 1910) we have the assurance of Gurney,\r\nalready cpioted, to the effect that the medium is not unconscious, nor too dazed to know who she is, and, as each word\r\ncomes, what she says. The same assurance is repeated in a D.I.\r\nof August 10, 1910, where we are told that she \u201c is not unconscious\u2014she is fuUy conscious of each word as it comes, but the\r\nlast word is effaced, wiped away \u201d. In the light of Mrs Verrall\u2019s\r\nexperience we need not hesitate to accept this as a true\r\naccount of the facts\u2014so far, at least, as the normal self is concerned.\r\nBoth these early D.I.s I count as examples of partial trance ; for though the amnesia, so far as regards the content of the\r\nmessage, is similar to that experienced bj^ Mi'S Verrall, I judge\r\nfrom other indications that in these sittings Mrs Willett\u2019s state\r\nwas very decidedly fui\u2019ther removed from the normal than was\r\never the case with IVIi's Verrall herself.\r\n^ Froceedinys, vol. xx., pp. y, iO.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WiJleAfs MeAinmship 69\r\nI now proceed to quote in extenso the record of a sitter-sitting\r\nof considerably later date (December 17, 1913). I do so not\r\nbecause it was a typical sitting\u2014on the contrary it was in some\r\nrespects singular if not unique\u2014but because it illustrates in an\r\ninteresting way some of the topics dealt with in the present\r\nchapter. If we regard this record from the jDoint of view of form\r\nalone, we might suppose that we had before us an example of the\r\nfamihar combination of preliminary script and following D.I.,\r\nexcept that the sitting ends with a reversion to script after an\r\nuntimely interruption caused by noise outside the room. But\r\nin character the clictated portion is wholly unlike any D.I. in the\r\nentire collection. I have never regarded it, nor do I now regard\r\nit, as a D.I. proper. There is good evidence to show that\r\nneither did the communicators themselves reckon it as such.^\r\nThe allusions in the short prehminary script are obscure even\r\nto the investigators. I do not advise the reader to trouble\r\nhimself with tr\\dng to understand them, but he should note the\r\nabrupt change of style which marks the transition from writing\r\nto dictation.\r\nScript, followed by dictation, of December 17, 1913. {Present,\r\nG.W.B.)\r\nGurney\u2014yes, say this\r\nPrometheus and the divine fire, the gift of gods to men\r\nBearing aloft in folded hands of prayer\r\nSafe through the windy world the fire divine\r\nThe ground flame of the crocus\r\nfiamentia liliacque The lilies of flame a flame floats above\r\nthe lily a Pillar of fire, beacon and guiding Daemon\r\nSocrates\r\n{At this point Mrs W. began dictating to me :)\r\nIt\u2019s a picture\u2014a picture that I love and often see.\r\n^ If we exclude the sitting in question, no D.I.s are recorded between July U, 1912, and Febiuary 28, 1914, an interval of over eighteen months.

W.B.\r\n.During the greater jjart of this sitting Mrs Willett, althoughnot in a condition of trance, was certainly further removed thanusual from a normal state of consciousness. On my showingher, about an hour later, the part which I had taken down fromdictation, she said, \u201c I haven\u2019t the faintest recollection of all this, nor do I know what it means \u201d. I then told her that it described a famous scene in Plato\u2019s Symposium, to whichallusion had already been made in another script of hers, nearlythree years ago (January 3, 1911). The word Syfnposium.,however, seemed to convey no meaning to her, though I re- minded her that she must have seen it in Mrs Verrall\u2019s account(in vol. XX. of the Proceedings) of the attempt to reproduce* Burke, Speech at Bristol : \u201c What shadows we are and what shadows wepursue \u201d : quoted in a Holland script of February 9, 1910, which Mrs Willett\r\nhad seen.\r\n\u201d Henrij V., Act TV., Scene Hi.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Medmmship 73\r\nMyers\u2019s posthumous message. She has certainly read this, and\r\nshe remembered something about Diotima. The name of\r\nAlcibiades amused her, but recalled no memories. I think we\r\nmust assume that her conscious knowledge of the Symposium\r\nand its contents was in all probability greater at one time than\r\nat the date of this sitting.\r\nIt will be seen that in spite of her complete faihu\u2019e to recall\r\nthe content of the script,^ my contemporaneous judgment was\r\nthat Mrs Willett was \u201c not in a condition of trance \u201d, although\r\n\u201c certainly further removed than usual from a normal state of\r\nconsciousness \u201d. No doubt I formed this judgment largely on\r\nwhat I noticed of the external behaviour of the automatist, as contrasted with what I was familiar with in undoubted cases of\r\ndeep trance. I believe I was right in not taking the failure of\r\nmemory as a proof of deep trance ; but I should not now hesitate to describe the sitting as one of partial trance.\r\nIncidentally, I may call attention to three other points of\r\ninterest\r\n:\r\n(1) The change of style when dictation begins seems to\r\nindicate a new communicator. Who is this new communicator ? No hint is given in any part of the dictated passage that it is a message conveyed by any member of the communicating group.\r\nThe automatist mentions both Myers and Gurney, but refers to\r\nthem, as it were, independently and on her own account.\r\n(2) When, on my asking that the dictation should be a little slower, she rephes, \u201c Oh, I wish I could say it quickly because\r\nit\u2019s all floating past me \u201d ; and again when she says, \u201c There\u2019s a deeper faculty, deriving its\u2014something or other\u2014I missed\r\nthat\u2014^through a more central zone \u201d, the \u201c I\r\n\u201d seems to be the\r\nself to whom the description is given and who at times has a\r\ndifficulty in giving it out. The exclamation \u201c Oh, is it Bacchus\r\nand his crew? \u201d uttered \u201c ecstatically \u201d should also, I think, be\r\nattributed to the recording \u201c I \u201d. The \u201c I \u201d who is responsible\r\nfor the description, and seems to be relating its own experiences,\r\nmust, on this interpretation, be an \u201c I \u201d different from, or at\r\nleast distinguishable from, the first. If it is not one of the communicating group this second \u201cI\u201d would seem to be a dis-\r\n^ It is possible that the failure might have been less complete had the\r\nautomatist been interrogated as soon as the sitting was ended, instead of after an hour\u2019s interval.

The question here raisedwill call for consideration more at length hereafter.\r\n(.4) If that portion of the script which follows the interruption by noise had been spoken instead of being written, it mighteasily be mistaken for a waking stage, since the first fewsentences have a curious resemblance to a waking stage inpoint of style. But apart from the fact that a written wakingstage woidd be of extreme rarity, if not altogether unique, thesu])position is further negatived by the change, to which attention is called in the record, from the autoniatist\u2019s \u201c script hand \u201dto her natural wiiting. For that change, as we are about to see, denotes not an awakening or progress towards normality, buta movement in the reverse direction to something nearer acondition of trance.\r\n[h) Indication.s from Handwriting\r\nVery little, if any, attempt is made in Willett script toimitate the known handwriting of the several communicators.It is true that in the notes which the autoniatist is in the habitof appending to her lone scripts, when forwarding them to thecare of the investigators, she occasionally uses language implying a distinction between the Myers script and the Gurneyscript ; but this seems to refer to the rajiidity and vigour of thewriting, and to the size of the letters, rather than to anycharacteristic form of the writing itself. On the other hand herscripts exhibit two well-marked styles of handwriting which,though they bear no relation to any jiarticular communicator,do appear to have a direct connection with her state of consciousness at the time of writing. An examjile of the transition fromone to the other has already been noticed in the iumiechatelypreceding paragraph.\r\nMrs Willett herself became aware, for the first time, of thesetwo distinct styles of handwriting in circumstances recorded byherself when sending me the script which brought the distinction to her notice. It must be remembered that she had neverbeen shown the scripts written by her when in a condition ofdeep trance. Her account is as follows:\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'\u2019s Mediumship 75\r\nScript of December 24, 1911, icith Mr Willett present.\r\nNote by Mrs W\r\n.\r\nMr Willett having frequently expressed a wish\r\nto see script coming, I had for some time been making up m_y\r\nmind to try for script in his presence. ... I had not expected his\r\npresence to make any difference in script, if any came. I did\r\nthink it might probably prevent any script coming. But what\r\ndid happen was this : after the first two sheets of script I found\r\nI was going off into unconsciousness, was, in fact, going into\r\nD.I. The writing ... is for some sheets not in my script hand,\r\nbut in something which is almost my ordinary handwriting,\r\nexcept that the f\u2019s are not crossed nor the i\u2019s dotted. There\r\nare also punctuation marks in the script, which my script never has. My eyes were shut, and it was only by a great and\r\ncontinued effort that I got out of the D.I.ey state. I succeeded,\r\nbut I felt dazed and heavy.\r\nI may supplement this account by some observations of my\r\nown, recorded immediately after the sitting of April 18, 1912,\r\nto w'hich they relate. It was in February 1911 that my acquaintance with Mrs Willett began. My first sitting with her was on\r\nJune 4 of the same year, and from that date onwards it had\r\nfallen to me to be the principal \u201c experimenter in charge \u201d. Between June 4, 1911, and April 18, 1912, I had witnessed a good many sittings of the combined script and D.I. type, in all of which the automatist had been deeply entranced, but I had\r\nnot until the latter date seen her produce a script in a normal\r\nor quasi -normal state of consciousness.\r\nNote ivritten by G. IT. B. immediately after the Sitting of\r\nApril 18, 1912 ; ^\r\nThe day before this script was produced Mrs Willett had\r\narranged for a sitting with me, at whicli it was proposed to try\r\nfor script and D.I. in the usual trance conditions. Next day,\r\nhowever, she told me she had had a \u201c flash D.I.\u201d [silent D.I.]\r\ninstructing her to try for script in my presence, but without\r\ngoing into trance. The instruction was duly followed, and the\r\npresent script re.sulted.\r\nI was glad to have this new experience, never having seen the\r\nmodus operand! of Mrs Willett\u2019s automatic writing except in\r\n1 This was one of the three exceptional sittings with an investigator in charge, mentioned on p. 62 above, that were not followed by D.I.\r\n7T) Psychological Aspects of 3Irs Willett's 31erUu7nshij) [parttrance conditions. It will be remembered that she once tried\r\nfor script in Mr Willett\u2019s presence, and on that occasion had thegreatest difficulty in resisting a disposition to pass over into\r\nunconsciousness. No such difficulty was observable on thepresent occasion. She sat with the block on her knee, holdingtwo or three primroses in her left hand (taken from a bowKulwhich had been sent us from Whittinghame), and managed theturning over of the leaves without assistance from me. Sometimes she looked at the page as she wrote, biit for the most partseemed to be gazing out vacantly into space. Occasionally sheclosed her eyes altogether. Pauses were not infrequent, butthe writing when it came was usually rapid, and sometimesextremely rapid. The character of the handwriting varied.\r\nMrs Willett\u2019s \u201c trance-script \u201d is always, I think, written in herown natural hand, and often punctuated. The script whichshe gets when she is alone, so far as I have seen it, is very differ- ent\u2014the letters longer and more regular, the words runnmgmore continuously into each other, and stops conspicuous bytheir absence. When she wrote in Mr Willett\u2019s presence andhad to struggle to retain consciousness, she noticed a tendencyto pass over into the trance style of handwriting, i.e. into\r\nsomething more like her own natural hand with stops inserted.\r\nThere are few or no stops in the present script, but the handwriting changes a good deal ; and I am inchned to think that\r\nthe more closely it resembles her normal style, the further\r\nremoved she has become from the completely normal consciousness.\r\nSince the above note was written I have had many opportunities of observing the correspondence between the handwriting of the automatist in script and her psychical condition.\r\nThere can be no doubt that, broadly speaking, the nearer she is to dee]) trance the more closely does her script approximate to\r\nher ordinary handwriting. Punctuation marks are also a sign,\r\nthough not an infallible one, that she is deeply \u201c under\r\nAnother distinguisliing mark of script written in trance or\r\npartial trance is the use of erasure to correct errors in writing.\r\nIn ordinary lone script any faulty or superfluous words whichit is desired to alter or omit are left standing. The script just\r\nflows on and provides a corrected version without crossing out\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediiimship 77\r\nwhat has been wrongly written. I do not think a single erasure\r\nis to be found in the scripts, numbering two hundred or more,\r\nwritten before May 24, 1911, the date of the first deep-trance\r\ncombination of script and D.I. This is the more curious inasmuch as the underhning of particular words in order to\r\nemphasise them is freely resorted to. After that date erasures become fairly common, but they are almost entirely confined to\r\nsitter-present scripts in which, on other grounds, a conchtion of\r\nat least partial trance may be reasonably inferred.\r\nAn interesting example of erasure which occurred on May 1 1\r\n,\r\n1912, may be cited here because it fimnshes at the same time\r\nan ilhxstration of the distinctions in handwriting.

Possibly the communicator did not wish to proceed\r\nuntil he was satisfied that the automatist was fully entranced.\r\nThe return to the natural way of writing in proportion as the\r\nnormal condition of consciousness gives place to trance is not\r\nwhat one might have expected a priori, but is, I think, capable\r\nof explanation. Mrs Willett sits for script with the point of the\r\npencil resting on the paper, and lifts it as little as possible.\r\nHence the continuity of line which is the most characteristic\r\nfeature of the writing. Tins is the method recommended by the\r\ncommunicators themselves, presumably as that best suited for\r\nautomatic expression through the hand. Why is it abandoned\r\nwhen the medium is presumably not less but more under their\r\ncontrol ? The explanation I suggest is that the artificial\r\n78 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Medmmsliip [part\r\ncharacter of the handwriting when the automatist is quite\r\nconscious of what she is doing depends upon her giving attention to this rule of practice, and that, when the normal consciousness is lulled, attention to the rule is weakened andordinary habit reasserts irself. Save in a single exceptional\r\ncase I do not think Mi\u2019s Willett has ever experienced the feeling\r\nthat her hand was being moved for her by some influence\r\nexternal to herself. Her script-writing is not automatic in that\r\nsense.\r\n(c) Extjernalisation of Presences\r\nMrs Willett\u2019s perception of her communicators (I use the\r\nword perception deliberately) ranges fi'om bare awareness of a\r\n\u201c presence \u201d void of all sensory content to complete sensory\r\nhallucination. There is an intermediate form in which whatmay be called a psycho-sensory element is involved, and in\r\nwhich bare awareness merges into less or more vivid visualisation. But both the bare awareness and the awareness re- inforced by mental visualisation dift'er from ordinary ideas,\r\nmemory images, and fancy pictures, in being independent of\r\nthe percipient\u2019s volition. They are, as it were, inqjosed uponher from something not herself, and create a sense of the\r\nobjectivity and reality of that which is perceived, not indeed\r\nidentical with, yet not wholly unlike, that which is associated\r\nwith ordinary sense perception of external objects.\r\nTo this intermediate form of externalisation the term\u201c pseudo-hallucination \u201d has been applied. The term may notbe altogether free from ol^jection ; but I shall continue to use\r\nit as a convenient class name enij)hasising the essentially\r\nconij)elling and involuntary character which the phenomenonshares with true sensory hallucination.\r\n\r\n^ Conijiare William James, Principles of Psychology, vol. ii., jjjj. 115 ff., and Proc. S.P.R., vol. x., pp. 86-87. The imjjortance of pseiulo-hallucination was not suffleiently recognised when\r\nGurney wrote his chapter on hallucination in Phantasms of the Living.\r\nThe sense of objectivity which characterises both bare imjjressions of presences\r\nand so-called pseudo-hallucinations raises cjuestions of the greatest theoretical\r\ninterest. These will occupy oin attention later on. In the present chapter\r\nI am inore concerned to describe the experiences themselves than to suggest\r\nany theory in explanation of them.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Aledmmship 79\r\nSome connection undoubtedly exists in Mrs Willett\u2019s case between the ascencbng scale of externalisation and the different\r\nstates of consciousness\u2014ranging from all-but-normality to deep\r\ntrance\u2014which characterise her mediumistic experiences. 1 should hesitate to affirm that the correlation is regular and\r\ninvariable, but it is sufficiently marked to be of some psychological interest.\r\nI have already quoted (pp. 52-53 above) two descriptions\r\ngiven by Mrs Willett herself in the early days of her mediumship\r\nof the way in which, in silent D.I., she becomes aware of the\r\npresence of a communicator and of the message which he wishes\r\nto convey to her. My object then was to give a general idea of\r\nthe characteristics of these silent D.I.s. It will be convenient\r\nto repeat the descriptions here with a somewhat different\r\npuiq^ose in view.\r\nExtract from a letter to Mrs Verrall dated February 18, 1909.\r\nLast night ... I was sitting idly wondering at it all . . . when\r\nI became aware so suddenly and strangely of F.\u2019s presence that\r\nI said \u201c Oh ! \u201d as if I had run into someone unexpectedly.\r\nDuring what followed I was absolutely normal. I heard nothing\r\nwith my ears, but the words came from outside into my mind\r\nas they do when one is reading a book to oneself. I do not\r\nremember exact words but the first sentence was \u201c Can you\r\nhear what I am saying ? \u201d\u2014I replied in my mind \u201c Yes \u201d...\r\nExtract from a letter received by Mrs Verrall on September '21,\r\n1909.\r\nI got no impression of appearance, only character, and in some\r\nway voice or pronunciation (though this doesn\u2019t mean that my\r\nears hear, you know !). That is always so in D.I. [i.e. w silent\r\nD.I.f I don\u2019t feel a sense of \u201c seeing \u201d, but an intense sense\r\nof personality, like a blind person perhaps might have\u2014and of\r\ninflection, such as amusement or emotion on the part of the\r\nspeaker. If you asked me how I know when E. G. is speakmg\r\nand not F., I can\u2019t exactly define, except that to me it would\r\nbe impossible to be in doubt one instant\u2014and with E. G. I often\r\nknow he is there a second or two before he speaks. ... I then\r\nsometimes speak first. ... To me, by now, there isn\u2019t anything even strange in D.I.s except when I try to explain anything\r\n80 Fdychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Alediumship [partabout them ; then I realise snddenly they are unusual ! Butotherwise h gives me no more sense of oddness to be talking tothese invisible people than it does to be talking to my son forinstance. lint I don\u2019t think I mentally visualise any sort of\u201c appearance \u201d with regard to them\u2014it is as \u201c minds \u201d and\u201c characters \u201d that they are to me, and yet not at all intangibleOf not-solid realities.\r\nThe first sentence in this extract refers to a silent D.I. ofsome months earlier (May 8, 1909), one of the very rare occasions when the \u201c presence \u201d was that of an unrecognisedstranger. Mi\u2019s Willett\u2019s contemporaneous record was as follows : Got impression of a young man, fashionable, conventional,sporting, very nice, a thorough gentleman, cheerful \u201d. At alater date Mrs Verrall, having formed a guess as to the possibleidentity of the stranger, asked Mi\u2019s Willett for further particulars.The letter quoted al)ove was written in answer to this inquiry.\r\nSuch experiences are no doubt difficult to define and expressin langiiage, and one may be in danger of attributing to MrsWillett\u2019s statements on the subject a precision beyond what it woidd be fair to look for in them. The two accounts I havequoted relate to different occasions. Both may be accurate.But some interest attaches to a jjoint of difference betweenthem respecting the way in which the words of the communicator reach the automatist. No hearing with the ears is admittedin either case. But whereas the first account compares thecoming of the words from outside into her mind to the experi-ence of reading a book to oneself, the second account suggests amental impression not only of meaning, but of the peculiaritiesof voice and pronunciation. If to this kind of mental hearingthere was a corresponding mental seeing, there should byanalogy residt some kind of image or rei:>resentation of externalappearance. IVli\u2019s Mdllett, however, denies having any suchrepresentation in the typical silent D.I. \u201cI don\u2019t thinkI mentally visualise any sort of \u2018 appearance \u2019 with regard to[the communicators]\u2014it is as \u2018 minds \u2019 and \u2018 characters \u2019 thatthey are to me, and yet not at all intangible or not-solid realities.\u201dThis last phrase I take to be an attempt to express the senseof objectivity which the experience brings with it. To thepercipient the communicator is an iiidependent reality\u2014\u201c a\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Alediumskip 81\r\npresence not to be put by It is possible that some faint and\r\nvague idea of appearance is not so wholly absent from her mind\r\nas her description seems to imply. But this much, at all events,\r\nis clear, that no distinctly visualised picture forms part of the\r\nphenomenon, much less any such full-blooded phantasms as most of us are famihar with in our dreams.\r\nThe bare awareness of presence may be regarded as the\r\nminimum degree in the scale of externalisation. But there is evidently a tendency to develop a higher degree in the scale by\r\nthe addition of what I have called a psycho-sensory element.\r\nEven in the early days of Mi\u2019s Willett\u2019s mediumship she records a case of silent D.I. in which she was conscious of a presence\r\ncommg toivards her, though she was unable to describe how.\r\nThis at least implies definite localisation in space, which seems\r\nto be a first approach to mental visualisation.\r\nDefinite localisation in space ajDparently without visualisation is well illustrated in the following case :\r\nWriting from the Lake of Geneva on September 17, 1922,\r\nMrs Willett records\r\n\r\nI had a strange experience to-day\u2014seemingly meaningless,\r\nand yet it made such a deep impression on me that I send it on\r\nto you. I was so tired this morning . . . that I decided to go\r\nby the early boat to Thonon and back\u2014fresh air and rest. It was a radiant morning\u2014haze on the mountains\u2014but coming\r\nback, as I was leaving Nyon, I saw a great white mass\u2014so high\r\nI took it at first to be cloud. As we steamed towards Geneva\r\nit came more fully into view, and I suddenly realised it must be\r\nMont Blanc\u2014longed for but not seen by me since my arrival.\r\nSeen across the intense blue of the lake, and over a range of\r\nlower mountains, it was wonderfully beautiful.\r\nI sat down and gazed\u2014then suddenly I heard the words\r\n\u201c the Dark Young Man \u2019\u2019\u2014not with my ears but inside my\r\nmind\u2014as if someone had said it to me in a world where thoughts\r\npass without speech\u2014I hadn\u2019t thought of the Dark Young Man\r\nfor more than a year I am sure\u2014and have been thinking and\r\nreading about nothing likely to revive the thought of him.\r\nSomeone said, \u201c He\u2019s helping you \u201d, and quite suddenly\r\nI seemed to tumble into a pool of knowledge\u2014\u201c Of course he\u2019s\r\nbeen helping you all the time \u201d.\r\n82 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part\r\nI got no sense of who was the speaker, but the Dark Young\r\nMan in the flash of a moment was there\u2014quite close to me. . . . We stood there side by side looking at Mont Blanc and the lake\r\nand the colour of it all\u2014but especially at the great tower of\r\nsnow\u2014All sorts of things kept passing through my mind too\r\nquickly to seize\u2014a\r\nprecious moment of human companionship \u2014I don\u2019t know how long it lasted\u2014It was like a day-dream yet\r\nmore real than any reality of waking life. Why he came or how or where he went I know not.\r\nWhen cross-examined by me at a later date concerning this\r\nincident Mrs Willett assured me in the most positive way that\r\nvisualisation, or seeing with the mind\u2019s eye, formed no part of\r\nthe experience. Yet her habitual description of this particular\r\ncommunicator as \u201c the Dark Young Man \u201d suggests that at\r\ntimes she must have visualised his presence in a pseudohallucinatory form.\r\nIn the silent D.I. next to be quoted something of visualised\r\nappearance seems to be implied in the descriptive phrase \u201c a\r\npiercing glance \u201d. But there is an ambiguity even about this\r\nas if somehow it were possible to be aware of appearance\r\nwithout \u201c seeing \u201d even with the eye of the mind. For the rest\r\nthe impression of personality is for the most jjart of things\r\nimpalpable.\r\nJanuary 21, 1911. {Silent D.I. recorded on the following day.)\r\nLast night after I had blown out my candle and was just\r\ngoing to sleep I became aware of the presence of a man, a\r\nstranger, and\u2014almost at the same moment\u2014knew it was Henry\r\nButcher. I felt his personality, very living, clear, strong,\r\nsweetness and strength combined. A piercing glance. He made\r\nno introduction but said nothing. So I said to him, \u201c Are you\r\nHenry Butcher ? \u201d He said, \u201c No, I am Henry Butcher\u2019s\r\nghost \u201d. I was rather shocked at his saying this, and said, \u201c Oh, very well, I am not at all afraid of ghosts or of the dead \u201d. He said, \u201cAsk Verrall (or A. W., or Dr Verrall, I can\u2019t remember which, but I think it was \u2018 Verrall \u2019 tout court) if he remembers\r\nour last conversation (or meeting) and say the word to him.\r\nEk e tee.\u201d\r\nHe said it several times. I said \u201c Very well \u201d. He seemed\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 83\r\nonly to want to give that message and then he went in a hurry.\r\nI never heard tlie word Ek e tee in my life and don\u2019t know what\r\nit means, but record this. He was alone, to the best of my knowledge. I never felt a greater sense of vitality and strength than\r\nthat which seemed to flow from him.\r\nP.S.\u2014I hadn\u2019t been thinking about him at all.\r\nConcerning this experience Mrs Willett, on January 23, 1911,\r\nwrote to Mrs Verrall as follows :\r\n\u201c Will you let me know whether the following word (if it be one !) has any meaning or associations for your husband.^\r\nI only heard it spoken (D.I.), so don\u2019t know how to write it, but the sound is Ek e tee.

In this, of course, she may have been mistaken.\r\nNot improbably there was some departure from normality, just\r\nas there seem to have been in both cases signs of a transition\r\nfrom the bare awareness of a presence to the stage of pseudohallucination.\r\nIn the next examples the departure from normality is more\r\nclearly evidenced, and is recognised by the automatist herself.\r\nShe is in a state approaching trance, but not so far entranced as\r\nto be unable to recall the experience which she describes. In\r\nthese experiences the psycho-sensory element has become more\r\npronounced. They are, in fact, typical visual pseudo-hallucinations.\r\nScript of Sep)tem,ber 8, 1913. . {Present, Mrs Verrall)\r\nMrs Willett notes : \u201c When this script was ended, I felt I did\r\nnot want to open my eyes and quite \u2018 come back \u2019.

[Present, G. W. B. and another.)\r\nThe circumstances of this case were peculiar, and in some\r\nrespects unique. I have called it a \u201c sitting \u201d, but there had\r\nbeen no idea or intention of obtaining a script or communication of any kind. Mrs Willett and I were seated side by side,\r\nhstening to the great Beethoven trio in B flat, which was being\r\nplayed on the gramophone outside the open door. Another\r\nperson was in the room, lying on a couch, also hstening to the\r\nmusic and paying no attention to us. He was the same who\r\nhad sat with Mrs Willett on the occasion last mentioned, when\r\nthe script of October 1, 1926, was obtained. Presently, to my\r\nsiu\u2019prise, ]\\Irs Willett shut her eyes and wliispered to me, \u201c This\r\nroom is full of presences \u201d. She proceeded to describe to me,\r\nstill in whispers, what she was seeing, or, rather, mentally\r\nsensing\u2014for though she spoke as if she was seeing a phantasm,\r\nshe explained that it was with her mind\u2019s eye only that she saw. Her whole attention was concentrated on a single flgure\u2014that\r\nof a lady in an old-fashioned chess, young, and with thick and\r\nbeautiful hair. She was standing beside the couch, a brilliant\r\nlight streaming round or from her whole figure. . . . Towards the end of the slow movement of the trio Mrs Willett\r\nremarked that she had been almost in trance, and only with\r\nmuch effort had succeeded in retaining consciousness.\r\nIt was impossible to make an absolutely contemporaneous\r\nrecord, but the above account is taken from a statement\r\nwritten down by me on the following morning. I can vouch for\r\nits substantial accuracy, and it was independently corroborated\r\nby Mrs Willett\u2019s own recollections of what happened.\r\nThe experiences described in these cases go beyond bare awareness of a presence, and beyond the definite localisation of\r\na jjresence in space. The element of visuahsation is so prominent that one might be tempted to class them as fully developed\r\nhallucinatory phantasms. But that is not how they appear to\r\nthe automatist herself. In the course of preparing this paper\r\nI have endeavoured to elicit her views on this question, and find\r\nthat she draws an absolute distinction between sensory phantasms (apparitions) and mentally visuahsed personalities. Every\r\none of the five cases I have just cited she unhesitatingly assigned\r\nto the second of these categories. In fact it is possible to say\r\n8(1 Psychological Aspects of M7'S Willett's Mednimship [partthat in the whole coiirse of her mediiimistic experience MrsWillett has never had a genuine visual hallucination which sheurns afterivards able to re^\u00bb,e?\u00ab6er a7id describe.\r\nMrs Willett assures me that in her normal state she is a very])oor visualise!\u2019. It seems probal)le that her powers in thisdirection are markedly increased as she passes towards a stateof trance. But any visions which she can recall on returning tonormal consciousness have invariably for her the character ofmental pictures. They are pseudodiallucinations, not hallucinations. And the difference is of kind, not merely of degree.Like presences these visions have an objectivity of their own,but not exactly the objectivity associated with sense perception.It is qiiite jjossible that when in partial trance Mrs Willettmay have visions of her communicators which she does notremember, and that these also may take a pseudo-hallucinatoryform. In forming a judgment upon this point, however, wehave to fall back u])on the records themselves, since theautomatist cannot afterwards comment on, or be cross-examined on, experiences of which she has no recollection.\r\nIn forming a judgment on the nature of her experiences indeep trance we are under a yet greater disability in this respect\r\n;\r\nfor whereas the visions of her light trance are occasionallyrecalled, of what has hapjjened in deep trance she never seemsto remember anything. I think, however, that there can belittle doubt that when in deep trance she is in a kind of dreamland, and that the personalities of her trance have the genuinehallucinatory character of the personages in vivid dreams.^\r\nIt may be difficidt to furnish conclusive proof of this fromthe records ; but certainly that is the impression which thestudy of them produces, and which is forced even more clearlyupon the experienced sitter. When she is in deep trance MrsWillett seems to lose all consciousness of her actual surroundings\u2014always with the very important exception that she remainsin touch with the sitter\u2014and to live for the time being in aworld of her own in which her communicators appear to her aspalpable and life-like human beings, of whose features and dressshe can take note, whose touch she can perceive, and in whosepresence she feels \u201c at home \u201d, as in a company of friends.Something has been added to mere mental visualisation\u2014some1 Mrs Willett tells me that her owti dreams are of this realistic character.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mecliuw,ship 87\r\nthing different in kind. No doubt this difference is physiologically conditioned ; but into this region of inquiry I am not\r\ncompetent to adventure.\r\nIn support of the view here taken of the apparently sensory\r\nobjectivity of the personalities of her deep trance I refer the\r\nreader to the D.I.s quoted in \u201cThe Ear of Dionysius \u201d, and generally to the many other passages from D.I.s cited in this paper.\r\nThe following example of a waking stage is also not without\r\ninterest as bearing on the question : Waking Stage folloiving Trance-script of September 8, 1918.\r\nPresent, 0. J. L.\r\nI see a young man I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s standing near a very\r\ntall man, with a moustache, the man has. The tall man has\r\ngot his hand on his shoulder. I\u2019ve seen that tall man before in a dream. He\u2019s got gloves with gauntlets and fur inside them.\r\nThe other young man said to me, \u201c I haven\u2019t worn my brass\r\nhat lately \u201d. He hasn\u2019t got much voice, he doesn\u2019t seem to\r\nknow how to speak very well\r\n\r\n[Pause).\r\nThey\u2019re so icily cold. As I look at them I feel as if my forehead were resting on a solid block of ice. It\u2019s like a freezing\r\nwind blowing from them to me. [Pause.)\r\nThis room\u2019s full of ghosts. There are three there, two there,\r\nand one over there. Men, all of them. Three of them are young.\r\nI can\u2019t see them, but I know they are there. I can even tell the places where they are. One of them seems to have been\r\nmixed up with rivers. . . . My power is getting dimmer. One\r\nof them seems connected with a band, a military band. I don\u2019t\r\nmean that he played in it, but in his mind just at present is that\r\nthought. I don\u2019t know what music it is I hear, loud and\r\ndelicious. He seemed to think about it a propos of nothing very\r\nmuch\r\n.\r\nThe waking stage is, as the term implies, a transition from\r\ntrance to normal consciousness. In the above example we find a corresponding transition from what I take to be hallucinatory\r\nphantasms to presences located in the room in which the sitting\r\ntook place, but apparently not otherwise externalised. It is not absolutely clear that the one transition is causally connected\r\nwith the other. But I think some connection between them\r\nmay be inferred with a high degree of probability.\r\n88 Psycliologicnl Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [partA striking passage occurs in the Avaking stage following theD.I. of March 5, 1912. {Present, G. W. B.)\r\n. . . Good bye : thank you\r\nOh ! what a heavenly thing a world of souls is. Oh ! They\u2019regoing\u2014They\u2019ve gone\u2014Seem[ed] like minds only, just as theywere going. Tliey were solid before ; then they got transparent\r\n;\r\nthen they got dim, and I got so heavy . . .\r\nThe transition in this case also may correspond to a transitionfrom trance to comparative normality, but as the waking stagecontinued for a short time after the utterance quoted, the morenatAiral interpretation may be that the change represents theeffect of a diminution of rapport between the communicatorsand the medium. It is not so much that her condition alters, asthat the communicators are, so to speak, taking their departure.Enough has perhaps now been said to justify the statement,made at the beginning of this section, that a correlation canbe traced in Mrs Willett\u2019s case between the different states ofconsciousness in which her mediumistic phenomena are produced and the different degrees in which her communicatorsappear to her to be externalised. That her psychical conditionis an important element in determining the degree of externalisation seems to me fairly well established. Probably it is the most important, though not the only one.\r\n{d) Indications from Waking Stage\r\nAll trance-sittings must end in a return to normal consciousness. It is only when the transition is accompanied by acontinuance of utterances bearing some affinity to tranceutterances, yet distinguishable from them, that we apply to it the term \u201c waking stage \u201d. A study of the Willett scripts leads to the conclusion thatsittings during which, judging from other indications, themeflium has been practically entranced are sometimes followedby a waking stage, and sometimes not. Hence while theoccurrence of a waking stage necessarily implies some degreeof trance in the preceding part of the sitting, absence of awaking stage cannot be taken as proof of normahty. Again,while deep trance is jirobably always followed by a waking\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of 3Irs Willeff\\s 3Ierlimnship SO\r\nstage, the occurrence of a waking stage is not of itself sulhcient\r\nto distinguish deep trance from partial trance.\r\nIn these circumstances it is impossible to attach high importance to the waking stage taken by itself as an indication\r\nof the psychic state of the medium during the i^receding part\r\nof the sitting. Nevertheless it would be a mistake to ignore it altogether. Both the fact of its occurrence, and the length to\r\nwhich it extends in any given case, may be of real help in forming\r\nan opinion when considered in conjunction with other criteria.\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS\r\n( ) Impressions of \u201c Presences \u201d, and the more or\r\nLESS VIVID EXTERNALISATION OF THESE\r\n() Mental Images\r\n(c) Feelings and Emotions\r\n(d) Impulses and Inhibitions\r\n(e) Verbally conveyed Messages\r\nThe characteristic form of the communications exemplified in\r\nthe Willett phenomena is that of mental impressions that\r\na]ipear to the sensitive to have their origin in an agency whichshe distinguishes from her conscious self. The communicatorsdeclare that these impressions are telepathically conveyed, andthis account of them I think we are entitled to accept, unless\r\nanother and a better can be found.\r\nThe impressions in Mrs Willett\u2019s case may he conveniently\r\ndivided into the classes enumerated below :\r\n(a) Impressions of \u201c presences \u201d, together with the more or\r\nless vivid externalisations of these.\r\n(h) Mental images.\r\n(c) Feelings and emotions.\r\n(d) Impidses and inhibitions.\r\n(e) Verlially conveyed messages.\r\n(a) Impressions of \u201c Presences \u201d, and the more\r\nOR less vivid EXTERNALISATION OF THESE\r\nThe subject of \u201c presences \u201d and their externalisation has\r\nbeen dealt with at some length in the preceding chapter, but\r\nthere are one or two further observations which it may be\r\nworth while to make.\r\nA presence pure and simple represents, as we have seen, the\r\nlowest grade of externalisation ; and the impression of such a\r\n90\r\n\\vAB,T ^\u2018^(^']Psycholor|icnl Aspects of j\\Irs Willetfs MedinmsMp D1\r\npresence may l>e described, for tlie purpose of this chapter, as a mental percept of an individual intelligence or self, more or\r\nless defiiiitely located in space relatively to the percipient, but\r\notherwise void of all sensory or psycho-sensory element.\r\nHere it may be well to repeat the warning already given in the\r\nintroduction to this paper. Where I use language appropriate\r\nto the standpoint of the scripts, and write as if I assumed the\r\nimpressions of the autoniatist to Ire due, in accordance with their\r\nface claim, to the agency of independent discarnate minds, I have\r\nneither the intention nor the desire, whatever my own views\r\nmay be, to exclude any other hypothesis which can adequately\r\naccount for the sense of objectivity which the impressions carry\r\nwith them. In particular the possible effects of interaction\r\nbetween chssociated and independent, or quasi-independent,\r\n\u201c selves \u201d within the personality of the medium slioidd never be\r\nlost sight of. Objection may perhaps be taken, even from the standpoint\r\nof the scripts, to applying the word comnvimication in connection with the bare awareness of a presence. A presence may\r\nsuggest a potential communicator, but can the mere fact of its being perceived entitle us to treat the impression as an actual\r\ncommunication ? \u201c Communication \u201d would seem to imply\r\npurjDOsive agency ; can the bare awareness of a presence carry\r\nwith it the impression of a pm-posive agency\u2014or, indeed, of\r\nagency of any kind beyond that which a material object may\r\nbe supposed to exercise as a factor in producing the perception\r\nof which it is the object ? It is true that in IVIi\u2019s Willett\u2019s case the impression is seldom,\r\nif ever, that of a perfectly indeterminate entity in some sense external to herself. It is as \u201c minds and characters \u201d that\r\npresences are apprehended by her. Yet even so a doubt\r\nremains concerning the parts respectively played in the experi- ence by what we usually call agent and percipient. Are these\r\nimpressions of \u201c mind and character \u201d to be regarded as communications intentionally conveyed by the personality concerned, or is the activity really on the side of the percipient\r\nalone ? Or is the phenomenon in some way a l)lend of both ?\r\n^\r\n1 The question here propounded is of more importance tlian miglit at first sight appear. For it cannot be confined to the mere perception of \u201c jDresenees \u201d. Similar doubts may be raised in coimection with more developed forms of\r\n92 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's 31ediumsJiip [part\r\nAnother point to be noticed is this : Mrs Willett claims to\r\nbe able to distinguish between one communicator and another\r\nwithout any kind of visualisation, and sometimes independently\r\nof the reception of any verbal message. Writing to MrsVerrall on Sej)tember 27, 1909 (see p. 52 above), she says, \u201c I don\u2019t feel a sense of \u2018 seeing but an intense sense of personality like a blind person perhaps might have\u2014and of inflections, such as amusement or emotion on the part of the\r\nspeaker. If you ask me lioio I know that E. G. is speaking andnot F., I can\u2019t exactly define, except that to me it would be\r\nimpossible to doubt one instant\u2014and with E. G. I often knowhe is there a second or two before he speaks.\u201d\r\nNow if the means of identifying the communicator is already\r\ngiven in the mental apprehension of a \u201c presence \u201d, the question\r\nat once suggests itself whether its externalisation either as a mental picture {i.e. a pseudo-hallucination) or as a sensory\r\nphantasm really adds an3rthing that is at once new and objective. Is the externalised form a something contributed bythe communicator, or is it due to the subjective activity of the\r\npercipient building by association of ideas on the objective\r\nfoundation provided by the mental percept, much as, in the\r\ncase of ordinary perception, we build subjectively on the data\r\nimmediately provided by sensation ? Readers of Phantasms of the Living will recollect the elaborate\r\ndiscussion which Giirney devotes to this question in connection\r\nwith veridical apparitions. The conclusion he arrives at is that\r\na veridical apparition is the hallucinatory shape in which a\r\ntelepathic impulse from the mind of a distant person is embodied for the percipient. As such it is subjective. All that is veridical in it is packed into the telepathic impulse in the form\r\nof \u201c a nucleus of a transferred impression \u201d ; the embodimenttelepathy\u2014doubts involving the distinction between what may be described\r\nas active thought-communication by one mind to another, and active thoughtacquisition by one mind from another. We shall find, when v\/e come to deal\r\nin Part II of this paper with statements made by the commimicators themselves, that great emphasis is laid upon the distinction in tlie Willett scripts.\r\nA fuller consideration of the subject will then be called for. In the meantime\r\nI shall assume that the commimications, of which typical examjjles are given\r\nin the jiresent chapter, are communications in the strict sense of the term\u2014that\r\nis to say, mental impressions felt by the sensitive to proceed from an intelligent\r\nagency disthiet from herself.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 93\r\nis the percipient\u2019s own creation. In the main I do not dissent\r\nfrom this view. It is obvious, however, that in cases where the\r\napparition is recognised the telepatliic nucleus must at least\r\ncontain some element that makes for identification. And this\r\nelement must be psychical.\r\nI suggest that the \u201c telepathic nucleus \u201d is something analog- ous to the impression received by JVIi\u2019S WiUett of \u201c mind,\r\ncharacter, and personahty \u201d in connection with her impressions\r\nof \u201c presences \u201d. This would not, I think, be incompatible with Gurney\u2019s view,\r\nthough I do not say it was the view he would actually have\r\naccepted had he been acquainted with the Willett phenomena.\r\nConcerning the nature of the \u201c telepathic impulse \u201d and the\r\n\u201c nucleus of a transferred impression \u201d he is studiously indefinite. But he is obviously unwilling to admit that it can be\r\nanything hke an idea or mental picture of the living agent\r\nformed in the consciousness of that agent, and transmitted\r\nfrom his mind to that of the percipient. He points out that\r\nin experimental telepathy the image transferred resembles the\r\nprecise object thought of, and not anything not consciously\r\noccupyhig the agent\u2019s mind, whereas his own personal appear- ance is certainly not what we shoidd expect to be consciously\r\noccupying the agent\u2019s mind in moments of crisis or of death.\r\nThere is force in Gurney\u2019s argument, though less, I think,\r\nwhen apphed to what we are assuming to be disembodied\r\nspirits than when apphed to telepathy from the hving. For\r\ndisembodied spuits, if such exist and can communicate, are presumably free to choose their own times and seasons, and\r\nmay have good reasons for consciously and deliberately using a recollection of their personal appearance when in the body\r\nas a means of identification by the percipient. I do not think\r\nwe can exclude this possibihty, although, for my own part,\r\nI inchne to the view that all visualisations of communicators,\r\nand a fortiori all fully developed hallucinatory phantasms, are to be regarded as siibjective constructions\u2014symbolic, it may be,\r\nof some objective reahty, but stiU subjective constructions\r\n\r\nexcept in so far as there is evidence for attributing to a communicator a definite intention to transmit a pictorial image of himselfd\r\n^ It must be admitted, however, that some spontaneous cases, especially of apparitions about the time of death, in which veridical details of personal\r\n94 Psychological Asiiccts of Mrs Willeffs Mediumshij) [partIt must he remembered that the communicators who form the\r\nelective dramatis personce of Mi\u2019s Willett\u2019s automatic experi- ences are very few in nunibei', that of these few she had knownMyers and A. W. Verrall while still living, and that she had seen photographs of Edmund Gurney, Henry Sidgwick, and also ofthe Dark Young Man and of the \u201c lady in an old-fashioned\r\nth-ess \u201d, though in the case of these last two she has neveridentified them as persons of whose existence and history she\r\nhad any normal knowledge. The material for a subjective\r\nexternalisation was thus ready at hand for her to draw upon.\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that in the case of the DarkYoung Man the externalisation did not slavishly follow the\r\nautomatist\u2019s recollection of the photograph of him which she\r\nhad seen. More than once in trance-sittings has she commentedupon the photograph as being in certain details an incorrect\r\ncopy of the original as known to her from direct observation.\r\nIt is open to us to conjecture that something more than jjurely\r\nsubjective construction was here at work.\r\n(6) Mental Images\r\nCases in which the scripts give evidence of a deliberate\r\nattempt on the part of a communicator to recall his ownpersonal appearance when in the body, and to transmit animpression of it to the medium, are very rare ; but there are at\r\nleast two instances of it. The record of the earlier and morestriking of these is worth reproducing at some length. Thepassage in cpiestion is taken from a sitting with Sir Oliver Lodgeon September 24, 1910, which combined script with D.I. in the\r\nmanner usual at that date. I judge the autoniatist to havebeen in a state of light trance.\r\nThe preliminary script ends with an intimation from Myersthat \u201c Gurney wants to give some data bearing on the telepathic\r\nimpact \u201d. D.I. follows, and the passage I am about to quote\r\ntakes the form of a conversation d trois, Mrs Willett repeating\r\nout loud what Gurney says to her and interposmg her ownobservations.

The impression is without doubtmeant to be understood as a deliberately communicated imju\u2019ession involving not only intention on the part of the agentbut effort. The case seems to stand on a widely different footingfrom the more ordinary examples of visualisation of a jjresence\r\nwhich it is possible to attribute to the jiurely subjective activity\r\nof the percipient.\r\nI pass to what pui'port to be transferred mental pictures otherthan visions of the communicators themselves. Such pictures occur much more sparingly in Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumisticexperience than, for instance, in that of Mis King or MrsWilson, and rarely except when she is in trance. This may bedue to her comparative lack of visualising jiower when in a state\r\nof waking consciousness, for neither Mrs King nor Mrs Wilson,with whom this method of communication is abundantlyemployed, is a trance -medium. Sometimes the pictures are accompanied by explanatory verbal comments ; sometimes it\r\nis left to the unaided ingenuity of the investigators to discovera signiffcance in them. Significance of some kind I thin k theyalways possess\u2014that is to say, they are invariably symbolic ofsomething beyond the scenes immediately reiiresented. Forthe most part this inner meaning is hidden from the autoniatist,\r\nand intended to be so. Indeed it is- probably with this veryintention that the symbolic form is adopted.\r\nThe following may be cited as examjiles ; Extract from the IJ.I. of May 15, 1912. {G. W.

They are quite intelligible to the investigating group.\r\nA very special form of significant mental pictures is provided\r\nby cases in which the automatist apjDcars to \u201c see \u201d something,\r\nand ch\u2019aws a copy of what she is \u201c seeing I do not say that\r\nwherever a drawing occurs in her scripts we are to infer that the\r\nthought of the communicator has been impressed upon her in\r\npictorial form. But there is good evidence that this sometimes\r\nhappens, and it is of specially frequent occurrence when the\r\nobject drawn is a symbol approjjriate to one of the communicating group and is used for the piu\u2019pose of identification.\r\nThere is an interesting variant of this type in which the\r\ncommunicator, endeavouring to transmit a difficult word, seems\r\nto the automatist to spell it out letter by letter to her in visible\r\nform. Thus in the D.I. of October 8, 1911, of which I was in\r\ncharge, after a reference to the \u201ctranscendental self\u201d, the\r\nrecord continues as follows :\r\nOh, he says, back of that again Ues somethuig I dimly reach\r\nafter and you [i.e. the sitter'] would call, he says, the Absalom\r\n\r\nnot Absalom\u2014I\u2019ll spell it you, he says : A B S 0 L and he says\r\nO M and rubs O M ovit and puts instead U T E . . .\r\nIn this case the medium apparently sees the letters written\r\niqj, as it were, on a black board.\r\nThe next example is taken from a trance-sitting of June 19,\r\n1916. It was a sitting for script, not for D.I., but in the extract\r\nhere given spoken remarks are interpolated by the automatist\r\non her own account, or else as repeating what the communicator\r\nsays to her.\r\n[Spoken] A man holds up before me letters ... I have never known him, but I call him the Dark Yomig Man.\r\n(Sitter) What sort of letters ? [Spoken] Big square letters\u2014would you like me to copy\r\nwhat he showed me ?

W. B. will explain. . . .\r\nThe \u201c I \u201d in the last spoken words I take to be the DarkYoung Man, whose remark is repeated in the first person. Indrawing a candle the automatist is probably copying what shesees, just as in the case of the letters. Candle and candlestickare among the identification symbols referred to above.\r\nThe extract next to be quoted combines the characteristicsboth of drawings and of letter-spellings in the form of a monogram. It is further noteworthy as affording an instance of adistinctly visualised mental picture \u201c seen \u201d by the automatistwhile in a state of normal or nearly normal consciousness. Forthe script from which it is taken is a lone script, and the recordshows conclusively that Mrs Willett was throughout awake amiaware of her surroundings.\r\nFrom the Lone Script of Segdember 26, 1922.\r\nThere are two who are m all this Both young a man & awoman and hers the influence you feel Hers is the influence\r\nof which you feel the pressure A young and very gracious\r\nlady ... I hear the word Perseus & she draws for me thelettei's\r\nthat is a J , not a T.\r\nThis is only foi' the jmrjjose of identifying her . . .\r\nMl'S Willett jii'obably recognises that the allusion in this\r\npassage is to Bmne Jones and the Perseus series of picturespainted by him, but she does not know, supraliminally at least,\r\nwho the lady is, or how the allusion can serve \u201c the purpose ofidentifying her \u201d. The identification is not for her benefit, butfor that of the interpreters. The foregoing are examples ofvisuahsed pictures which, when the medium is in deep trance,\r\nprobably tend to take for her the form of fully developedsensory hallucinations.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 101\r\nCommunications which are primarily dependent for their\r\nsignificance on impressions of sounds (other than verbal sounds,\r\nwhich form a class apart), of scents, and of physical pain are\r\nrarely found in Willett script, but do occasionally occur. In\r\nthese cases also the impressions may take a hallucinatory form\r\nin deep-trance sittings.\r\nThe subjoined passages, relating to the sense of sound and\r\nthe sense of smell respectively, are of some interest. They are both taken from the deep-trance D.I. of February 28, 1914, and\r\nhave ah-eady been published in my paper on \u201cThe Ear of\r\nDionysius \u201d, together with other extracts from the same sitting\r\nbelonging to the literary puzzle there described. This puzzle,\r\nas my readers may remember, purports to have been devised\r\nby Henry Butcher and A. W. Verrall in the spirit world, and\r\nconsists in bringing together by gradual instalments a number\r\nof apparently disconnected topics whose inner connection is only revealed when the final instalment provides the key to the\r\nwhole. Among the various topics is the siege of Syracuse by\r\nthe Athenians, and the fate of the unfortunate captives imprisoned and set to work in the stone quarries after the defeat\r\nof the besiegers. The normal ]\\Irs Willett, be it noted, was\r\nentirely ignorant of any part of the story.\r\n. . . Lots of wars\u2014A siege I hear the sound of chijjping\r\n(Strikes the fiyigers of one hand repeatedly against the palm of the\r\nother) It\u2019s on stone.\r\nThe sound in this case is not an unmeaning noise. It possesses a distinctive quality which the automatist proceeds to associate\r\nwith the chipping on stone by hammer and chisel. No doubt\r\nthe interpretation of the sound, as well as the idea of the sound\r\nitself, must have been in the mind of the communicator, and\r\nmay have formed an integral part of the message he wished to\r\ntransmit. But the record as it stands suggests to me that for\r\nthe automatist the sound is primarjq and the interpretation of it an immediate inference ch'awn by herself.\r\nHaving regard to the fact that Mrs Willett was deeply\r\nentranced throughout the sitting, I think it probable that the\r\ncase was one of genuine auditory hallucination. She hears the\r\nsound as with her bodily ears, and not merely as with the\r\n\u201c inward ear \u201d of the mind. But it does not follow that the\r\n102 Psj\/cJwloffiral Aspects of 3Tr,<t Willeff's Medivmship [partmessage was received by the percipient in the first instance in\r\nthe form of a sensation of sound\u2014still less, of course, that it wasin the form of a sensation of sound that it existed in the mindof the communicator. Rather, I think, should we conceive it as both sent and received in the form of an idea of sound, thoughat once transmuted, in the case of the percipient, into sensationby a psycho-physical process such as operates in dreams.\r\nMuch the same observations apply also to the second of thetwo passages referred to, which concerns the sense of smell.\r\n. . . Somebody said something about Father Cam walkingarm in arm with the Canongate. What does that mean ? Oh !\r\n(sniffs) What a delicious scent ! No rosebud yet by dewempeaiied . . .\r\n\u201c Father Cam \u201d and \u201c the Canongate \u201d walking arm in armsymbolises the co-operation of the two friends Verrall andButcher. 1 The automatist is wondering what the meaning canpossibly be, when suddenly she stops and sniffs. She is smellingsomething, declares it to be \u201c delicious \u201d, and finally recognisesit as the scent of roses.\r\n\r\nThe case follows in every way the analogy of the previousone. In the mind of the commimicatior the idea of roses musthave accompanied the idea of the smell. But for the automatistthe smell appears to be prior to the interpretation of it. It is recognised as \u201c delicious \u201d before it is recognised as the smellof roses. Again, the experience seems to be clearly one ofsensation\u2014hallucinatory, doubtless, but still of sensation andnot of imagined sensation. The \u201c sniffing \u201d alone makes it difficult to draw any other conclusion. One does not sniff anidea. But this does not compel us to suppose that the messageof the communicator started with, or even inclnded, an actualsensation experienced by himself.\r\nI know of no cases in the Willett records in which a definite\r\nclaim is made to the sympathetic transference from the communicator to the percipient of a sensation, or rather of the idea1 For explanation see my jjaper on \u201c I'lie Ear of Dionysius \u201d (Proceedings,\r\nvol. xxix., p. 211).\r\n^ The rose and the scent of roses m Willett scri2Dt are symbols of S.

If I am right in my interpretation the same incident\r\nis referred to on both occasions, namely the accident by which\r\nthe Dark Young Man lost his life when climbing in the high\r\nAlps.\r\nWaking Stage of D.I. of May 11, 1912. {Present, G. W. B.)\r\nOH, oh, if I could only rememljer you when you\u2019re gone\r\naway. I always forget you. I can\u2019t make out how I ever came\r\nto know you, and why you will never tell me your name, and\r\nwhy you\u2019re so kind to me. That\u2019s the man\u2014that\u2019s my new\r\nfriend.

My contemporary note is as follows : \u201c All this was so dramatically uttered that for the moment I thought Mrs W.\r\nhad really hurt her head. Apparently, however, it is only the\r\nidea of the Dark Young Man\u2019s fall, and consequent injury,\r\npassing into a sympathetic feeling so strong that the automatist\r\nimagines it to have happened to herself.\u201d\r\nWhat I take to be a second reference to the same incident\r\noccurred in the D.T. of February 28, 1914, from which I have\r\nalready had several occasions to quote. The D.I. had been\r\noccupied with the \u201c Dionysius puzzle \u201d when the subject was\r\nabruptly broken off, and the automatist burst out on her own\r\naccount ;\r\nOh, oh, it\u2019s like frightful explosions going on all round me.\r\n[There was no sound otdside to account for this exclamation.)\r\nOh, you\u2019ve come back. I was frightened for a minute.\r\n{Pause) Why didn\u2019t you ever speak ?\r\n^ The phenomenon is often met with in Piper and Thomjjson records.\r\nCf. also H.P., vol. ii., p. 220, where Myers speaks of it as suggesting \u201c incipient\r\npossession \u201d. It is interesting therefore to note that Mrs Willett\u2019s communicators absolutely deny possession in her case. See Part II., Chapter I., p. 169\r\nbelow.\r\n104 PsyrhoJoqical A fipects of Mrs Willett's Mejlhmishvp [partOh dear ! oh, my head, oh, my head [same words repeated five or six times). Stamp, stamp, thump, thump\u2014Oh, it makes meshudder.\r\nWhy didn\u2019t you ever speak to me through all those long hourswhen you stood there taking care of me ? .\r\nIt is to be observed ( 1 ) that on neither of these two occasionsis any explicit suggestion made that the pain in the head had atelepathic origin of any kind, still less that it had its source in\r\nthe mind of the Dark Young Man ; (2) that on the first occasionMrs Willett had already in the course of the sitting complainedof her head being \u201c fidl to painfidness \u201d, and again, just beforethe end of the waking stage, exclaimed that she wished \u201c herhead would get empty Similarly on the second occasion,\r\nafter the sitting was over, and she had returned to normality,she comjjlained of an uncomfortable feeling in her head \u201c as if the inside of it had been knocked about\r\nIn these circumstances it is impossible to be quite sure thatthe experiences described had not a purely physical origin.\r\nNevertheless I have a strong conviction that underlying themthere was a telepathic communication of some sort, althoughit must be admitted that the automatist gives no sign ofrealising it as such. The peculiar nature of the pain, the association of it with a \u201c fall \u201d or a \u201c thump \u201d, the introduction into\r\nboth contexts of the Dark Young Man, and the completeabsence of any external disturbing cause certainly make for\r\nthis conclusion.\r\nIf the interpretation I have put upon the above incidents is correct, the Dark Young Man\u2019s contribution to the experiencemust have been the idea of pain as it presented itself in con- nection with the mental picture of the accident. It waspresumably received as idea in the mind of the percipient andat once transmuted into actual sensation. If this be so, nothing could more clearly illustrate the nature of sensoryhallucination. The pain felt by the automatist was real enough.We call it hallucinatory solely with reference to its origin. It\r\nwas mentally initiated, instead of having as its starting point the\r\ncondition of the bodily part apparently affected. If and in so\r\n' Tliis refer.? to a time when Mrs Willett was seriously ill and was conscious\r\nof the presence of the Dark Young Man watching over her.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Medvumshvp 105\r\nfar as it reproduced an idea in the mind of the communicator\r\nit was a veridical hallucination.\r\n(c) Feelings and Emotions\r\nMrs Willett, as we have already seen, claims that her impressions of presences commonly include not only a sense of\r\npersonality and character, but also of \u201c inflections such as amusement or emotion on the part of the speaker Waiving\r\nthe question raised a while back (p. 91) of the parts respectively\r\nplayed in these experiences by the communicator and the\r\nautomatist, I proceed under the 2iresent heading to give a few'\r\nspeciflc instances in illustration of the claim.\r\nHer first experience of the kind (of date January 7, 1909) has\r\nalready been quoted (p. 50) as the earliest example of a silent\r\nD.I. Mrs Willett had been anxious about her son\u2019s health.\r\nI was at dinner, she records, when I felt a strong impression\r\nof F. W. H. M. scolding me. I can\u2019t explain\u2014but I felt disapprobation and felt it coming from him, and that he was wishing\r\nme to know that there was no need for any anxiety. I had the\r\nimpression that he was conveying to me that if I doubted the\r\nimpression I was receiving I was to try for script after dinner.\r\nI was quite normal. I was silent, I suppose, for a few minutes,\r\nbut I continued my diimer and later\u20148.40\u2014did try for script ; when the following came : Myers yes write now no cause for any anxiety none yes\r\nlet him go back to school no anxiety.\r\nThe above record is of additional interest as furnishing an\r\nexample of a thought conveyed without the assistance of verbal\r\nor pictorial exjiression. It is not until the automatist tries for\r\nscript that the message takes a definitely verbal form.\r\nSilent D.I . of February 18, 1909. (E.vtract from Mrs WilletFs\r\nrecord.)\r\nAbout 11.30 to-day (February 18) I began to feel that very\r\nrestless feeling ...

E.rtract from Note byMrs Willett, written after the Script was finished :\r\nI reached the house about 11.40 and was taken to the\r\nRoom, where jomed me. After a few muiutes conversation she left me alone in the room. I wandered about it at first and looked at the pictures, and then I seemed to pass beyond\r\n140] Psychological As\u2019pecfs of Mrs Willeft's Medivmship 107\r\nthem, as it were, into the spirit of the room\u2014full of remembered\r\npeace and happiness and rest\u2014a strange sense of familiarity\r\nand homelikeness.\r\nThe room seemed full of unseen presences and of their blessing ; it was as if barriers were swept away and I and they\r\nbecame one. I had no sense of personality in the unseen\r\nelement\u2014it was jiist there and utterly satisfying . . .\r\nI can\u2019t explain at all why the place moves me so deeply with,\r\nas I have said, that feeling of coming back after long absence\r\nto loved and remembered surroundings. I have only been in\r\nthe room once before when I tried for script some time in April\r\nor May.\r\nAll the above examples of communication of feelings and\r\nemotions rest upon statements made by the automatist when\r\nawake and normal, and are concerned with impressions ex- perienced by her when in a state of practically normal consciousness. In the case of her unreniembered trance-experiences, we\r\nno longer have her waking comments to help us and have to\r\nfall back on the records themselves. It is worthy of note that\r\nI can find only one example in the trance -records that is at all closely comparable with the examples ah\u2019eady given. The\r\nemotion in this case is that aroused in a husband when re- calling the grief into which he had been plunged by the early\r\nloss of a much-loved wife. The husband himself had by this\r\ntime passed over, and the grief had become a far off memory,\r\nbut a memory vivid enough, it would seem, to act telepathically on the automatist.\r\nExtract from D.I. of April 12, 1914. {Present, G.

I cannot remember a single occasion on which 1\r\nhave had Sc. at such a time, viz. whilst I was still in bed.\u201d\r\nA iiote appended to her lone scrij^t of June 12, 1913, is of\r\nsome interest from other points of view as well.\r\n[The script] was quite unexpected by me. I was just going\r\nto begin to dress for dinner, but thought I had time to write my\r\ndiary . . . As 1 was closing my diary, I suddenly felt an over- whelming rush of script coming. 1 looked at the watch lying on the table in front of me and thouglit there was no time ; but\r\nI had to sit there and let it come. It just poured out, and was what I call a very \u201c happy \u201d script, coming easily and without\r\neffort. It conveys nothing to me, but in one part it interested\r\nme, as an exciting incident in a book one is reading interests one. I had that sense of lookmg on at somebody else\u2019s experi- ences and of reading rather than writing the words. I have\r\nmarked the passage with two asterisks. ... I did not read the\r\nscript (at the moment) and had only a vague idea of what was\r\nin it.\r\nOne of the strongest expressions of urgency occurs in a statement accompanying the lone script of February 6, 1920 : Heavy with Sc. all day\u2014 & finding no uninterrupted time\r\n(because of letters, workmen & so on) until 9.30 p.m. when\r\nI felt an absolute rush as if someone were hterally dragging me\r\n. . . my bad arm making writing a trial . . .

The following incident, however, provides a casein point, besides being in other ways instructive. The autoniatist\u2019s account of what happened is contained in a letterwritten on March 23, 1910, to Sir Oliver Lodge, part of whichhas already been published in Mrs Verrall\u2019s paper entitled\u201c Notes on Mrs Willett\u2019s Scripts \u201d, in Proceedings, vol. xxv.,pp. 215-16. I reprodiice it here in full :\r\nThis is not a case of Sc. or D.I. I was sitting quietly afterdinner, alone, when I realised that I was beginning to feel dizzy\u2014rather light-headed and generally \u201c queer \u201d\u2014somewhat thesensation that the first few breaths of laughing-gas give one.I could not iniderstand it, for I was quite well.

I tried to throw it off\r\n;\r\nthen my hands seemed to feel rather odd, and I suddenlyremembered I had felt like that when the \u201c Dorr \u201d Sc. waswritten. Hoping I might get rid of the feeling I at once triedfor Sc. The words were instantly written. \u201c Myers no scriptto-mght do not be alarmed.\u201d Having read the Sc. I tore itup, there seeming to me to be no reason for keepmg such ameamngless sentence.\r\nI then began to somehow \u201c feel \u201d that it was something elsewanted of me, though I did not know what.\r\nI felt an impulse to get Mrs V.\u2019s Oct.\/06 \u201c Report \u201d [Proceedings, vol. XX.] and I turned over the leaves \u201c trymg \u201d variousplaces, but felt I had not got \u201c it \u201d, whatever \u201c it \u201d might be, andyet I felt I was on the right track. At last the word \u201c Syringa \u201dstruck me (p. 310). I read the page ; it conveyed nothing muchto me, though the word \u201c Asphodel \u201d which occurs on the samepage did ; but I somehow felt satished that I didn\u2019t need to lookanywhere : the word was Syringa. Then I felt there was more,but not in that book. After a little time I fetched Mr Piddington\u2019s \u201c Report \u201d (Oct. 1908) [Proceedings, vol. xxii.]. It is agood long time (months) since I had looked at it. I keep it ina drawer where I also keep Miss Johnson\u2019s \u201c Report \u201d (June,1908)\u2014I took both books out and went and sat down.\r\nSomething in me rejected Miss Johnson\u2019s, so I took up MrPiddington\u2019s. I wondered if more about Syringa was to befound there ; I looked the word up in the index ; it was not\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 111\r\nthere. I then thought I had better turn the pages carelessly\r\nand see if I\r\n\u201c felt \u201d, as I did over Syringa, that I had got \u201c it\r\nIt was some minutes before I lit on what 1 knew (though how\r\nI can\u2019t explam) was wanted ; \u2014p. 268 in big print,\u2014\u201c The\r\nRiver of Lethe The words preceding are : \u201c Dante enters the Terrestrial Paradise and reaches \u201d (the\r\nRiver of Lethe).\r\nTo sum up : my two\u2014I don\u2019t know what to call them\r\n\r\nimpressions or round-about given words (for I seemed led to\r\nthe words) were\r\nLethe\u2014with Dante.\r\nSyringa.\r\n(Note : The combination of Dante's Lethe with Syringa has\r\na meaning for the interpreters, though it had none for the\r\nautomatist.)\r\nThe above account suggests to me that Myers was here\r\nmaking an experiment in a special type of telepathic communication in order to see whether a sensitive could be impelled to\r\nlook up a particular passage in a particular book without being\r\ndirected thereto by definite verbal instructions. The experiment seems to have been successful, but, so far as I am aware,\r\nwas never repeated. On the several other occasions when the\r\nautomatist was \u201c sent \u201d to a literary passage, the volume containing the passage and sometimes even the page on which it occms were previously indicated in silent D.I.\r\nHer instinctive recognition that the wanted jjassage had been\r\nfound may very well rest on a feeling of satisfied assent transmitted to her from the communicator. \u201cI \u2018 knew \u2019 she\r\nwrites on one of these occasions, \u201c at once\u2014like a divining rod\r\nover the water ; something in me gave the unmistakable sign\r\nthat \u2018 it \u2019 had been reached \u201d.\r\nInhibition, in the sphere of action, may be regarded as a\r\nnegative impulse.

The\r\nWillett records contain a striking experience in which this kind\r\nof negative push (not, however, in the form of a voice) was\r\npresently followed by a positive pixsh acting\u2014so it seemed to her\r\n112 Psychological Aspects of Mrs WUleiVs Mediumship [part \u2014not through the mind but directly upon the physical organism.\r\nThe case throws so much light upon certain aspects of Mrs\r\nWillett\u2019s medinmship, as well as upon her own attitude with\r\nregard to the whole inquiry, that I make no apology for reproducing in full the long letter of October 30, 1913, to Sir Oliver\r\nLodge, in which she describes the incident :\r\nOctober 30, 1913 {Impression).

The housemaid placed my letters on a table in my bedroom ; and a few minutes later I got up. I did not look at my letters\r\nthen, as I had only just time to do that part of my dressing\r\nwhich 1 do before my breakfast if 1 was to be ready for it at\r\n8.30, at which time it is brought to my bedroom.\r\nIt was only after my breakfast had been brought and I had\r\neaten a few mouthfuls that 1 began to open my letters. I opened\r\none or two which I found contained receipted bills and letters\r\nfrom shops. 1 then saw a larger envelope beneath the little\r\n])ile and, taking it up, saw it was addressed to me in Mr Briscoe\u2019s^\r\nhandwriting and had \u201c Birmingham \u201d postmark. I at once opened it, as I had been correspoufling with Sir 0. J. L. about\r\nhis coming or not coming to .\r\nI found the envelope contained some largish papers and a\r\nletter. I took out only the letter, which was smaller than the\r\npapers and dropped out on the tray.\r\nAfter reading it through (I did this rather hurriedly, and amnot able to say what the whole of its contents were about),\r\nI picked up the envelope to take out the enclosures when\r\nI suddenly felt a thundering sort of knock-down-blow conviction\r\nthat I must not do so.\r\nI looked at Sir O. J. L.\u2019s letter again, and I now (2 p.m.)\r\nremember of it this much : that he sent me a copy of a script\r\nof mine (I believe August 13), having been directed by Mr G. W.\r\nBalfour to do so. I think he said I was to compare it with the\r\noriginal.\r\nBut still I felt that not to be conquered \u201c push \u201d not to take\r\nout of the envelope the enclo.sures.\r\nThen an odd thing happened. I did not know clearly what\r\n' Mr Hriscoo was Sir Oliver Lodge\u2019s Seeretaiy.\r\n140 ] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WiJlett^s AleeUumship 113\r\nI was going to do and iny mind seemed not to work\u2014or rather\r\ntivo minds seemed to be at work and not to be acting together.\r\nMind No. 1 got my body up and walked it across the room to\r\nthe door and put me outside (I only use this wording to indicate\r\nthat I seemed to be acting like a machine), but Mind No. 2\r\n(which was \u201c me \u201d as I know myself) couldn\u2019t make out why\r\nit was that I was there. I stood a few seconds and then looked\r\ndown at my hands, and saw I had Sir O. J. L.\u2019s envelope in one and his letter in the other.\r\nMind No. 1 took my hand and put the letter back into the\r\nenvelope and walked me tlown a flight of stairs and up another\r\nflight. Mind No. 2 looked on and wondered. But when\r\nI reached the outside of Mr Willett\u2019s door the two minds flashed\r\ntogether, and I at once knew, somehow, what I was to do.\r\n1 went in and handed him the envelope, made him fetch a\r\npencil and write down the time and date and what 1 told him\r\n\r\nviz. : that I had read a letter it, the envelope, contained but\r\nnot the enclosures.\r\nHe asked me why I did this, f said, after a pause, that\r\nI didn\u2019t feel I was to read the enclosures. I then in silence\r\nhunted about in my mind to find a reason, and then I got hold\r\nof it ; \u2014I thought that accidentally Mr G. W. B.\u2019s notes on my\r\nscript might have been included by Sir 0. J. L., and that they\r\nmight not be intended for my perusal.\r\nSo I told Mr Willett this. He said, \u201c Your giving me this\r\nenvelope and my writing this on it proves nothing\u2014it does not\r\nprove you have not read all the enclosures \u201d.\r\nI saw the force of this, but I said, \u201c I can\u2019t help that. Keep\r\nthe envelope and I will tell you later what to do with it.\u2019\u2019\r\nI then went back to my own room and fimshed my breakfast.\r\nThe impulse not to read the enclosures in Sir 0. J. L.\u2019s\r\nenvelope got stronger as the morning wore away, and I have\r\nnow decided to ask Mr WiUett to send the envelope with its contents to Mrs Sidgwick in order that she may see whether\r\nthere is any of Mr G. W. Balfour\u2019s notes included in the copy\r\nof the script. I very much hope that it may prove this is not so, because\r\nI see that there is no evidence, other than my word, that the\r\ncontents of the envelope were not read l)y me during the 10\r\nminutes it remained in my bedroom.\r\n114 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partI expect I am making a fuss about nothing, because MissJohnson definitely arranged with Sir O. J. L. by letter that all copies of S.P.R. papers or scripts intended for me were to goto her in the first instance, that she might go over them before\r\nsending them on to me.\r\nI remember she asked that Mr Briscoe might receive definite\r\ninstructions to this effect, and I wrote to Mrs Sidgwick aboutthis point only a short time ago.\r\nIn any case, to avoid a repetition of these kinds of \u201c pushes \u201d\r\nor impulses, I should like in future that the arrangement abovereferred to should be carried out. I am sending this to MrsSidgwick, on the same day as Mr Willett sends her Sir 0. J. L.\u2019s\r\nletter.\r\nI lately (the latter part of September) had an exactly similar\r\nfeeling of having two minds, one of which moved my body aboutwhilst \u201c I \u201d looked on, and in that case very grave results\r\nwould have happened if I had not acted on the impulse, as\r\nI was thereby saved a serious danger. This makes me feel that I am right in not asking Mr Willett for the return of Sir\r\nO. J. L.\u2019s letter, though I quite see that I cannot prove that I havenot read the enclosures it contains.\r\nI do not like to ask Mr Willett to look and see if Mr Balfour\u2019s\r\nnotes are there, so that it seems best to have the things sent byhim direct to Mrs Sidgwick.\r\nNote by Mrs Sidgwick.

J. L. to E. M. 8.\r\nThe incident of inhibition is certainly interesting, and if by\r\nhypothesis we attribute it to \u201c them \u201d I should like more clearly\r\nto understand their reasons. It might be (a) that the bargain\r\nabout sending through A. J. had not been adhered to ; but in\r\nthat case it would be probably Mrs W. herself, not even her\r\nsubliminal ; or it might be (6) that \u201c they \u201d feared that something connected with * * had been put in and wanted to make\r\nsure ; or (c) that \u201c they \u201d were somehow aware of my note and\r\nperceived some reason why it shoidd not be read.\r\nThe last hypothesis is the most interesting, because it would\r\nshow a curious amount of knowledge about things done quite\r\napart from and oiit of the neighbourhood of Mrs W.\u2014things\r\nwith no particular feeling or emotion behind them. But I confess I incline to hypothesis (a), which is practically a normal one.\r\nI cannot altogether agree with Sir Oliver\u2019s diagnosis. It seems to me that we have here a clear case of dissociation, and\r\nthat the immediate \u201c inhibitor \u201d was a dissociated self which\r\nnormally would form a subconscious factor of the medium\u2019s\r\npersonality. Quite possibly it may have been acting entirely\r\non its own account. But while there does not appear to be any\r\nnecessity to invoke the intervention of the group on the other\r\nside, and no claim of the kind is made, there does seem to be\r\nsome ground for supposing the motive of the inhibition to have\r\nbeen a knowledge supernornially acquired of the contents of\r\nthe envelope. The question would then arise. By whom, or through whom, was this knowledge obtained ? Was it obtained\r\ndirectly by the dissociated self, or was the dissociated self\r\nprompted by some external agency ? There is no doubt that\r\nSir Oliver\u2019s notes did convey information which, from the\r\npoint of view of the investigators, should not have been allowed\r\nto reach the automatist.\r\n(e) Verbally conveyed Messages\r\nIt is held by some that thought and language are inseparable.\r\nI do not think so extreme a view is tenable. So far as I am able\r\nto examine my own experience I seem to be clear that thought\r\nis possible not only without the assistance of verbal or other\r\nconventional symbohsm, but without even that of mental\r\nimagery. No doubt all such thought is vague, shadowy, ill\r\nno Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019 s Medimnshi2\r\n) [part 140]\r\ndetermined, and elusive : any attempt to hold it fast and fix\r\nit tends to convert it at once into words.\r\nOf course if thought without language or mental images were\r\nimpossible the telepathic transmission of such thought wouldbe more impossible still. I do not believe it to be impossible.\r\nFlashes of meaning may reach the automatist unclothed in\r\nsymbols of any kind. Probable examples of an experience of\r\nthis natiire will be found on ]>p. 105 and 100 above. But in all cases the meaning mnst be given verlial expression if it is to be\r\ncondensed into a specific message. Whatever the theoretical\r\ninterest of this type of communication may be, its practical\r\nimportance in our records is almost Jiil.\r\n( )ji the other hand verbally expressed messages far exceed in\r\nbulk and importance all other ty])es of communication puttogether. In Mrs Willett\u2019s case, as in that of other mediums,they constitute the characteristic form of the phenomena,whether uttered through script-writing or speech or apprehended l)y the inner ear and subsequently recorded. Thedifferences referred to are ])robably connected with differences\r\nin the process of communication, but language is the essential\r\ninstrument of communication in all. Moreover as it is in verbal\r\nform that the messages are given out, so it is fair, I think, to\r\nassume that it is in verbal form that they are sent, unless there\r\nis evidence to the contrary. The assumption may not in every\r\ncase be justified. We can imagine, for instance, a communication sent in the form of a mental picture being automatically\r\ntranslated by the recipient into a verbally expressed meaning ; and there are actually one or two cases in which the communicator complains that a \u201c sound \u201d, i.e. a word or a collocation of\r\nwords, has emerged as a \u201c form-symbol \u201d. But the evident\r\nsurprise and interest which he exhibits on noting the change\r\nshow that he regards it as something quite exceptional in his\r\nexperience. I need not say that, besides the possibility of a\r\nradical transformation of this kind, allowance must be made for\r\nwhat the communicators call \u201c sophistication \u201d of the message\r\nby misunderstandings, confusions, omissions, additions, andeven rejections on the part of the automatist. The numerousrecords quoted in this pajaer will, I hope, illustrate these andother shortcomings sufficiently to render their further elaboration in the present chapter unnecessary.\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE DOUBLE TASK OF GRASPING AND GIVING\r\nOUT MESSAGES\r\n(a) General Conditions oe Seccessfdl Transmission\r\n( b ) Difficulties of Reception\r\n(c) Difficulties of Emission\r\n(a) General Conditions of Successful Transmission\r\nThe gift of mecliumship is a natural endowment possessed in a\r\nnoticeable degree by comparatively few persons. It is capable\r\nof improvement by practice, and likely, in the opinion at\r\nleast of the communicators, to become more wide-spread and\r\nmore developed as time goes on. Successful communication,\r\nhowever, would seem to depend as much upon the communicator as upon the recipient of the message. Among the hmited\r\nnumber of personahties who play a part on the Willett stage\r\nthere are some who appear unable to communicate without help\r\nfrom others, or only able to do so with the greatest difficulty.\r\nIndeed if we are to accept a hint given in one of the sittings,\r\nthere is a mediumistic faculty on the other side analogous to\r\nthat of mediums here. The passage is somewhat cryptic, but\r\nit clearly imphes that there are inequalities of natural aptitude\r\non the communicating side as well as on the receiving.\r\nGiven natural aptitude there are certain conditions favourable to communication which are probably common to all sensitives of Mrs Willett\u2019s type, and which are repeatedly\r\ninsisted upon in her scripts. The chief of them seem to be\r\nabsence of disturbing noise, a sense of security from interruption, a good state of health, serenity of mind, and freedom from\r\nfatigue and worry. Apart from these general conditions, and\r\nfrom faith in the reality of the communicators, the mental\r\nattitude requisite in Mrs WiUett\u2019s case for the successful discharge of the double task of grasping and giving out seems to\r\n117\r\nIIS Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetth Mediuniship [partvary with tlie style and subject-matter of the communicationitself. Sometimes a concentrated effort of attention on herpart is called for ; at other times she is instructed deliberately\r\nto relax and \u201c let the pen run free The minimixm of effort\r\nis apparently required in scripts of an allusive and disjointed\r\ntype, which are not intended to convey any connected meaningto her, and which largely consist of fragmentary material lying\r\nready in the mind of the sensitive, and brought, as it were, to the\r\nsurface by telepathic action from the comnnmicators.^ Inother scripts, and especially in spoken D.I.s, the degree of effort\r\nrequired seems to depend very much on the difficulty of the\r\nsubject-matter, and to reach a maximum when the subjectmatter is highly abstract and beyond the automatist\u2019s ordinarypowers of comprehension.\r\nIn a sitting of June 4, 1911\u2014the first of a series of sittings\r\nwith me largely occupied with expositions of \u201c process \u201d\u2014the\r\nseverity of the effort demanded of her, and of the strain resulting\r\nfrom it, becomes almost pathetically apparent. A passage\r\ntowards the end of this record may be taken as a characteristic\r\nthough perhaps extreme illustration. The communicator is Gurney.\r\nOh he says, now say this for me. He says you want to foster\r\nill sensitives a sort of dual attitude\u2014belief in their capacity\r\nOh ! say it slowly\u2014I\u2019m so tired, I\u2019m so tired\u2014oh I\u2019m climbing.\r\nOh ! I\u2019m climbing\u2014belief. Oh I will say it, I will say it\u2014behef\r\nin their capacity to have access to the mind of the communicator, together with a wholesome sense of discrimination in regard\r\nto the expressions\u2014not right\u2014regard to something to which\r\nthat access leads\u2014productions.\r\nOh, he says, you mayn\u2019t know it, there\u2019s a natural bent to\r\nextreme scepticism heie. Oh he says, there are such a lot of\r\nthings I want to tell you, and there's the longing to know whenone has struggled how far one has succeeded in making oneself \u2014Oh he says, I mustn\u2019t go much further now. Oh he says, don\u2019t give me up, Gerald\u2014help me\u2014and help her.\r\nOh I can\u2019t go on, I\u2019m so tired.\r\nOh he says, only one more thing\u2014only one more thing for\r\nhim. He says it over and over. I\u2019m tiymg (almost sobs)\r\n\u2019 See further concerning this type of script in Part II., Chapter III.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019 s Mediumship 119\r\nBeing is antecedent to\u2014Oh he says, You\u2019ve not got the word\r\nI want, but say it\u2014it\u2019ll suggest\u2014Yes, that\u2019s it, action.\r\nOh ! that\u2019s done. (^4 pause, after which the waking stage\r\nfollows.) ^\r\nTn this sitting the automatist exhausts herself in the effort\r\nto repeat words conveying a consecutive train of ideas. She\r\nfeels they have a meaning, and though she has no interest in the\r\nsubject on her own account, she strains her attention in an\r\nendeavour to understand what nevertheless continually escapes\r\nher. Effort of this kind may end in defeating its own object ; and it is worth noting that on a later occasion the communicator,\r\nafter a thoroughly mystifying discourse, advises her to try\r\n\u201c going bhndly which I take to imply that she will do better\r\nif she ignores the meaning and concentrates upon the mechanical repetition of each word as it comes. If the reader will\r\ntake the trouble to refer to the very striking passage which\r\nthereupon follows (see p. 298 below), I think he will agree that\r\nthe advice was on that occasion justified by results.\r\nThe specific difficulties of mediumship with which I propose\r\nto deal in the present chapter fall, as the title of the chapter\r\nimplies, under two headings\u2014difficulties of reception and\r\ndifficulties of emission.\r\nLet us consider these in the order named.\r\n(b) Difficulties of Reception\r\nIt has often been noticed that mediums find it hard to grasp\r\nproper names. In language the sign and its meaning tend to\r\nmerge into a unity so complete that we no longer think of them\r\nseparately. But this ceases to be true of an unfamiliar sign in\r\nproportion to its unfamiliarity. Words sjioken in an unknown\r\ntongue convey no meaning whatever. They are mere sounds,\r\nnot signs. Single unlmown words in a sentence may, of course,\r\ngain a kind of significance from their context. Thus even an\r\nunfamiliar proper name occm\u2019ring in a sentence will probably\r\nbe immechately recognised for what it is, namely a proper name.\r\nBut in distinguishing one unfamiliar proper name from another\r\n^ The D.l. from which this passage is taken is given in full on pp. 232-235\r\nbelow.\r\n2 See p. 245 below.\r\n120 Psychological Aspects of 3Irs Willett's Mediumship [partwe have ultimately only the sound (or the corresponding writtensymbol) to fall back upon. In verbally expressed messagesfrom a communicator to the medium it must, I think, be as-sumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that it is asound-image, apprehended by the \u201c inner ear \u201d, that reachesher. If, as seems probable in Mrs Willett\u2019s case, the soundimage gets transmuted when she is in deep trance into somethingindistinguishable by her from sound heard, this must be setdown (according to my view) as a subjective psycho-physicalefPect. Most people experience a similar effect in vividdreams. They seem to hear as they would hear with their earswhen awake. But I see no reason to suppose that the difficultyof catching a sound-image telepathically conveyed differs in anyessential respect from the difficulty of catching a sound heardin the course of orchnary speech or dictation. In fact thefailures experienced by Mrs Willett in catching unfamiharwords such as strange proper names, Latin or Greek phrases,^and technical terms are just such as the analogy of dictationwould suggest.\r\nThe subjoined illustrations of methods employed by thecommunicators to get over the difficulties thus caused presentvarious points of interest. A lone script of August 25, 1912,ends with the following passage : Now another thought\r\nNo no try again\r\nDoocalon\r\nDewacorn\r\n{this umd ended in a scribble)\r\nDewacorn\r\nNO DEUCALION\r\nthe sound is DEW\r\nK\r\nLION not Lion\r\nWrite it slowly\r\nDeucalion\r\nI want that said It has a meaning\r\nThe stones of the Earth shall praise thee\r\nMrs Willett is hardly ever able to reproduce Greek or Latin words correctly.\r\n140] PsycJiologkal Aspects of Mrs Willett's ^ledimnsh ip 121\r\nthat is what I want said it is I who say it and the word is\r\nDencalion\r\ntliat was well caught\r\nGood Child\r\nThat sort of thing makes one feel ont of breath doesnt it on both sides\r\n\r\nI am going Say too this word He set his bow in {illegible)\r\nin the clonds ^\r\nIn a note appended to this script Mrs Willett writes :\r\nThis part of the script was very odd. Though there was\r\na great deal of effort about it, it was extremely interesting in\r\nthe same sort of way that it is interesting to get a Patience\r\nout. It was written rather like this, as near as words can\r\ndescribe it : After \u201c now I want another thought \u201d there was a pause, then \u201c Doocalon \u201d written slowly and very\r\ndeliberately, then \u201c No no \u201d written impatiently but goodtemperedly. This leads me to suppo.se that it was not Fred\r\nwho was writing, because I get a sense of irritability and\r\ngrumpiness when I am trying to catch a word in this sort of\r\nway and he is writing. \u201c Try again \u201d\u2014this seemed to me\r\nencouragingly written. \u201c Dewacorn \", this word started off quite gaily up to about the c, when the next three letters\r\n:iemed to be beginning to go into scrawls. It ended in a\r\nscrawl and a complete stop. Underneath was written again\r\nquite plainly \" Dewacorn \u201d, but whether meant to be in two\r\nwords or one is not clear to me. I have never heard the ex- pression \u201c dew acorn \u201d. After this, on a new line, was wi'itten an emphatic NO : then a word was written in very big letters\r\nwhich appear to me to be DEUCALION ; however, I send\r\na tracing of it in case it may be anything else. [Not reproduced here, as it is clearly Deucalion\u2014m large letters, though\r\nnot in capitals.'] The script then went on about the sound\r\nof the word. \u201c DEW \u201d I read as rhyming with pew ; \u201c K\r\n\u201d\r\nas rhyming with pay ; \u201c LION \u201d as the animal. That did\r\nnot seem right, as the script wrote \u201c not Lion \u201d.\r\n^ Deucalion is the Noah of Greek Mythology. There is probably an allusion to the legend of Deucalion and Pyrrha in the words \u201c the stones of the\r\nearth shall praise thee^\u201d\r\n122 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part\r\nMrs Willett further states that the word \u201c Deucalion \u201d is unknown to her, though she supposes it to be Greek or Latin.\r\nShe appears not even to recognise it as a proper name\u2014the\r\ncontext in this instance giving no indication one way or the\r\nother. In order to ensure the correct recording of the word the\r\ncommunicator adopts the expedient of stressing the pronunciation syllable by syllable, though whether this is done\r\ndirectly through sound-images, or indirectly by means of\r\nvisualised words whose pronunciation is known to the automatist\u2014Dew, K (the letter) and Lion\u2014or by an indeterminate\r\ncombination of both methods, is perhaps open to question.\r\nThat recourse is sometimes had to the visual representation\r\nof a word of which the automatist has failed to catch the soundis beyond doubt. A good example of this has already been\r\ngiven on p. 99 above, where the word \u201c Absolute \u201d is heard in a spoken D.I. as \u201c Absalom \u201d, and the communicator corrects\r\nthe mistake by writing up ABSOLOM letter by letter, as it were, upon a black board, then rubbing out the last two letters\r\nand substituting for them the letters UTE.\r\nA somewhat similar example is provided by a passage in the\r\nD.I. of June 4, 1911. The communicator is explaining that a message may lie dormant in the mind of the automatist for\r\nsome time before it emerges in script.\r\nOften there is a fairly long period of\u2014don\u2019t get that word\r\nit contains a g and an s and a t and an a [G. IT. B. suggests\r\n\u201c gestation \u201d, hut no notice is taken of this) Say incubation he\r\nsays\u2014and then comes the uprush.\r\n\u201c Don\u2019t get that word\u2014it contains a g and an s and a t andan a \u201d is clearly a remark made by the automatist on her ownaccount. The word in the mind of the communicator wasevidently \u201c.gestation \u201d. As it conveys no meaning to the automatist, he siipplements the thought of it as pronounced bythe thought of the characters as written. When even this\r\nfails he substitutes another word of similar import in its place.\r\nIn another case, which I quote from the D.I. of January 21,\r\n1912, the wanted word is supplemented by a mental representation of the thing signified. The waking stage had begun, andhad proceeded for some minutes in the usual way, when the\r\n140] PsychoJogicnl Aspects of Mrs Wilhites Medivrnship 123\r\ncommunicator seemed to return, and the following was uttered : He says to me, Write : only that. The shield, the mother.\r\nOh, he says, on the shield there were different scenes, but there was one scene round the centre\u2014and he says, say the word\r\nKnob, if you like, it\u2019s not the proper word\u2014that\u2019s what I want\r\nan allusion to\u2014round the extreme centre. Oh, he says, what\r\nan expression, extreme ! He says, Please remember, my\r\nthought of the central pomt comes out through her as the\r\nextreme centre !\r\n\u201c The shield, the mother \u201d is almost certainly a reference to\r\nthe description in the Aeneid {Aen. viii., 607 seq.) of the shield\r\nforged by Vulcan for Aeneas at the request of his mother, Venus.\r\nOn the shield was represented a series of scenes from famous\r\nepisodes in Roman history, with the battle of Actium as a\r\ncentre-piece. The word wanted is apparently \u201c Boss \u201d : but\r\neither the communicator failed to get hold of the right word\r\nhimself or he failed to impress it on the autoinatist. Faute de\r\nmieux he offers \u201c Knob \u201d instead ; but (if I understand the\r\npassage rightly) supplements it with a mental picture of the\r\ncentral point of the shield. \u201c The extreme centre \u201d is the\r\nautomatist\u2019s interpretation of the mental picture, and does not\r\nrepresent words spoken by the communicator, who indeed\r\ndisavows the expression with some indignation.\r\nPerhaps the most suiq^rising expedient resorted to by the\r\ncommunicators in order to get a proper name recorded was the\r\nproduction in script of the name Dorr by operating on the automatist telergically instead of telepathically.^ At least that is the\r\naccount of their procedure given subsequently by themselves,\r\nas is shown by the following extracts : From the D.I. of May 6, 1910. {Present, 0.

The Dorr scried followed on the next day.\r\nMl'S Willett\u2019s own description of her experiences on theoccasion of the j^roduction of the Dorr script will be found inProceedings, vol. xxv., p. 125. It is not inconsistent with theaccount given by Gurney and Myers, though naturally it doesnot use the same terms. There can be no doubt that the wordDorr is written in a hand utterly unlike either the ordinaryscript-hand or Mrs Willett\u2019s normal handwriting. The experi-ence was a unique one up to the time of its occurrence, andI lielieve it has never been repeated.\r\n1 remarked above that the expedient employed by the communicators on this occasion was a surprising one. How sur-prising will be more fully realised when we come to deal inPart II with their own explanations of the modus operandi usedby them in communicating through Mrs Willett, and with thesharj) distinction, founded on this very difference of telepathy^ 7.e.

The communicator is S. H. Butcher. He is not named, but his identity is indicated at the outset by allusions to Demosthenes and to\r\nIreland. (Butcher was an Irishman, and he was engaged uponan edition of Demosthenes at the time of his death.) Thescript proceeds with its \u201c message of remembrance and hope \u201d,\r\nand concludes with further allusions to Demosthenes\u2014this time\r\nto his death in the temple of Poseidon on the island of Calauria,\r\nwhere he had taken sanctuary.

As regards \u201c the wearing o\u2019 the green \u201d the rough drawing\r\nrepresenting a shamrock leaf is probably the reproduction of a\r\npicture impressed on the mental vision of the automatist. The\r\ncommunicator may have tried to give the word shamrock\r\nwithout success, and afterwards attempted to convey the\r\nmeaning by the help of a visual image of the thing signified\r\nand the description of it as \u201ca small green plant \u201d. The\r\ntransition to \u201c the wearing o\u2019 the green \u201d is then effected by an\r\nassociation of ideas ready provided in the mind of the automatist.\r\nAssociation of ideas is again made use of to enable her by a roundabout way to arrive at the quotation from Psalm cxxi \u2014\u201c He watching over Israel slumbereth not nor sleepeth\r\nWhy there should have been so much difficulty in getting \u201c the\r\nwearing o\u2019 the green \u201d or the biblical quotation is something of a puzzle, especially as both one and the other had appeared in\r\nearlier Willett script.

I'here was no difiiculty about its reception on\r\nthat occasion. But the actual communicator was then Gurney,\r\nwho gives the message on Butcher\u2019s behalf. On the present\r\noccasion Butcher was himself the communicator, and some\r\nallowance should perhaps be made for his comparative inex-\r\n])crience. It is also possible that quotations, as such, really are hard to get through ; and it is certainly noteworthy that\r\nneither in Mrs Willett\u2019s script (which abounds in quotations)\r\nnor, I believe, in that of any other automatist of our group, can any quotation\u2014as apart from a literary reference\u2014be found\r\nwhich there is good reason to think had never been known to\r\ntheir normal selves. Nevertheless such explanations seem\r\nunconvincing where, as in the present case, not only was the\r\nquotation a very familiar one, but no less than four other\r\nquotations\u2014\u201c When God of old \u201d, Our fathers have told us \u201d, \u201c the Syrian blue \u201d, and \u201c Israel [Abraham] and his seed\r\nfor ever\r\n\u201d \u2014are pressed into the service before the required one\r\nis achieved.\r\nThere remains the difficidty of getting the words \u201c Prologue \u201d, \u201c Epilogue \u201d, and \u201d Sanctuary \u201d. \u201c I can see the thoughts \u201d,\r\nMrs Willett says, \u201c but it is so difficult to get the words \u201d. The\r\nexperience of feeling after a word which seems just out of reaeh\r\nis familiar to everyone. It is not a case of thought without\r\nlanguage, Imt a failure to recall a particular conventional sign\r\nthe recovery of which does not add to the thought or make it really clearer than before. Is the aidmnatist\u2019s difficulty in this case simply that of which we all have experience ? If so, in\r\nwhat form had the thought come to her, if it truly conveyed a message from the communicator ? Had the communicator\r\nhimself failed to find the appro] )riate Avord, and had he transmitted his thought by means of a periphrasis, leaving it to the\r\nautomatist to lill in the blank ? Or had he used the correct\r\nword but failed to inqjress it on the mental hearing of the\r\nautomatist ? I leave these questions unanswered, but it seems\r\nto me they are not withoAit bearing on the process of communication.\r\nThe difficulties we have been considering so far are such as\r\narise from the unfamiliarity of jjarticular words and phrases.\r\nAnother, and, from the ]\u00bboint of Anew of the perfection or imperfection of the records, probably more important souree of\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Airs Willett's Meiliuviship I2i)\r\ntrouble and confusion, is inability on the part of the autoniatist\r\nto follow and grasp the too-rapid flow of the communicators\u2019\r\nthoughts.\r\nHere are a few passages which indicate the nature of the\r\ndifficulty :\r\nLone Script of November 13, 1910. {Alyers communicating.)\r\nLet thoughts flit past you.

Sometimes the automatist begs the communicator tospeak more slowly. But it seems that this is not always easyfor him to do. Myers would appear to he the greatest sinnerin this respect. On one occasion (in the D.I. of March 15, 1912)he is represented as saying that he cannot get a series ofquotations through \u201c because they jostle each another, andI stand speechless and impotent from the very force of mylonging to utter \u201d. On this Gurney comments, \u201c Myers doesn\u2019tmanage things as well as I do. He takes more out of her. Hedoesn\u2019t shield off from her sufficiently ; he let\u2019s the whole blazecome out in his impatience \u201d.\r\n(c) Difficulties of Emission\r\nA message must be grasped before it can be given out, andtherefore in a sense every impediment to effective reception is also an impediment to effective emission. It would seem,however, {a) that the power to receive does not, in the view ofthe communicators, carry with it the power to give out, unlesscertain conditions are fulfilled ; and (6) that even where thepower to give out is actually in operation, special causes maybe at work to hinder or prevent particular parts of a messagefrom duly emerging.\r\nThe clearest exposition furnished by the communicators ofthe general conditions to which the giving-out power is subjectis contained in a lone script of April 16, 1911 :\r\n[Myers communicating^ . . . The point we have to study is to find the line where the incarn^e spirit is sufficiently over theBorder to be m a state to receive and yet sufficiently controUmgby its own power its own supraliminal and therefore able totransmit We don\u2019t therefore desire the kind of trance that is of Piper essence though we could and sometimes have inducedmuch the same thing ^ Get this clear We want the operatorto be so linked with its mechanism as to control that mechanismherself We want her also to be so linked with us as to be ableto receive definite telepathic write the word radiation Thereis one glory of the sun and another of the stars there is themediumistic gift of emitting and the other gift of receiving . . .\r\n\u2018 This can hardly refer to the Dorr sc ript (see ji. 1 24 above), since the mediuniwas not in trance on that occasion.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 131\r\nAccording to this statement the twofold gift of mediumship\r\ndepends for its successful exercise in Mrs Willett\u2019s case upon a maintenance of rapport on the one hand between the communicators and \u201c the incarnate spirit \u201d, on the other hand between\r\n\u201c the incarnate spirit \u201d and \u201c its own supraliminal It is through control of its suprahminal that the spirit of the medium\r\nis linked with its mechanism of utterance, whether by speech\r\nor by writing. To lose that control is to lose the power to record.\r\nThe above account of one aspect of \u201c process \u201d rests, from\r\nthe nature of the case, almost wholly on the authority of the\r\ncommunicators, and the fixller treatment of the subject of which\r\nit forms part must be reserved for Part II., to which it properly\r\nbelongs. But it could not well be passed over without mention\r\nin the present chapter.\r\nThe most striking instance of an alleged failure to record,\r\nascribed by the communicators to a break-down of the conditions affirmed by them to be essential to success, occurs in a\r\nD.I. of March 13, 1912, when Sir Oliver Lodge was \u201c in charge \u201d. Somewhat earher in the sitting Myers had worked himself up\r\ninto a state of passionate eagerness. \u201c He\u2019s trembhng \u201d, says\r\nthe automatist, \u201c I see him trembling \u201d. A pause follows, and\r\nthen an interval during which other communicators take their\r\nshare of speaking. Presently Gurney says :\r\nLodge, did you notice just now she was so completely over\r\nthe border [that] though in those instants things swept into\r\nher consciousness, she couldn\u2019t pass them back ; he says I want\r\nGerald to be fully told of this because he says it throws hght\r\nupon the method.\r\n{0. J. L. All will be told him.)\r\nShe projected herself in a rush of sjrmpathy.\r\n(O. J. L. I saw her do it.) And I must use symbols, he says, m describing what occurred,\r\nbut the blaze of light and the revelation was so tremendous in\r\nits force and effect that the lesser thing, the power to commimicate thought, lessens the\u2014the power of acquiring it.^ Thought\r\n^ There is obvious confusion here. What is meant is that the lesser thing,\r\nthe power to communicate the knowledge acquired, suffers from the very fact that the power of acquiiing it has been increased. Tlie word \u201c communicate \u201d\r\nin this passage is employed in the unusual sense of \" utter \u201d or \" pass on foi' the benefit of the sitter \u201d.\r\n132 Psycholo(jic(d As'pects of Mrs Willetfs Medi'umsJdp [part\r\nis not tile right word, but you can let it stand ; put the Primacy\r\nof the knowing faculty, and the secondariness of the transmitting, the communicating, faculty ; the soul\u2019s instinctive\r\nrecognition of truth far out-leaping the possibility of the\r\ncondensation of it to that point where it can be grasped and\r\nframed in language. That\u2019s what happened then. We have\r\nto keep her at the point where both sides can be touched, but\r\nthen she let go on your side and by the power of, not to be\r\nmeasured in words, of (to frame a clumsy expression) recognitive\r\nsympathy she broke away and passed, and knew, but could not\r\nutter.\r\nIn the main the explanation here given by Gmney accords\r\nwith the more general exposition quoted above from the script\r\nof April 16, 1911.1 An overwhelming rush of sympathy has\r\nswept the incarnate spirit so completely \u201c over the border \u201d,\r\nand into such close rapport with the communicator, that for\r\nthe time being it loses its control over the supraliminal. Withthat loss goes also loss of the faculty of emission, while the\r\nfacidty of acquiring knowledge is actually enhanced. Compare\r\nalso the opening passage of the\r\n1 I say that the explanation accords in the main with that previously quoted,\r\nbecause the words \u201c Thought is not the right word \u201d and the statement that\r\n\u201c the soul\u2019s instinctive recognition of truth far outleaps the possibility of the\r\ncondensation of it to that point where it can be grasped and framed in language \u201d show that what is here in question is not the reception of a telepathic\r\nmessage, but the acquisition of knowledge by telcesthesia in the very peculiar sense of that term adopted in the Willett scripts. Compare the statement in the D.I. of October 8, 1911 : \u201c Oh, he says, telepathy\u2019s one thing\u2014that\u2019s thought communication : telsesthesia is knowledge, not thought, acquired by\r\nthe subliminal when operating normally in the metetherial \u201d. For a full discussion of this important subject I refer the reader to chapter 3 of Part II. I may fm'ther note that faihu\u2019e to record tlmough inability to control the\r\nmechanism of utterance is one tiling ; failure to record because the knowledge\r\nacquired camiot be condensed into language is another. Are we to understand\r\nthat in tliis instance there were two groimds of failure, the second being\r\nadditional to the fii'st and independent of it ? A third explanation differing from both the others is given by Ginney in a\r\nscript of October 26, 1926. \u201c The real truth \u201d, he says, \u201c is that the intense\r\nemotion of the communicator blends witli the intense emotion in a sensitive receiver\u2014so that notliing is done but the setting up of a violent vibration\r\nin which concrete ideas disappear \u201d,\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of My's Willett's Medmmship 133\r\nScript of Jnly 22, 1917. {Present, G.

The first one recurred more than once, the other I only\r\nreceived\u2014or half-caught\u2014once. A conversation with Mrs Willett which took place on September 22, 192.5, and was recorded by Mr Piddington from\r\nnotes taken while she was speaking, bears upon the same\r\nquestion.\r\n* Browning, In Three Days : \u201c Feel where my life broke off from thine,\r\nHow fresh the splinters keep and fine,\r\n\r\nOnly one touch and we combine ! \u201d\r\n^ Oscar Wilde, The Burden of Itys : \u201c O Memory, cast down thy wreathed shell \u201d.\r\n134 PsycJiologiral Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [partIn the course of conversation [writes Mr P.] I referred to the\r\nfact (already known to Mrs Willett) that Mrs Salter for a year\r\nor two past goes into trance ; and I said that her trance\r\nphenomena show how many of the impressions she receives\r\nfail to get expressed. Mrs Willett asked if Mrs Salter rejected\r\nmuch of what she received ; and after I had made a brief reply\r\nto this question, she went on to say that she herself often\r\nrejected impressions that came to her as useless or uninteresting.\r\nShe gave as an example an impression she had had at some time\r\nbetween 3 and 6 p.m. on the preceding day, September 21, 1925,\r\nand which she described to me in more or less the following\r\nterms : \u201c The first sentence was \u2018 The Sanctuary \u2019. The next sent- ence was a reference to the Lamp hanging in the Sanctuary ; and the third sentence was a reference to the Flame in the\r\nLamp hanging in the Sanctuary \u201d. (Here she said something about the thing being rather hkethe House that Jack built.) \u201c And then I saw this lovely Flame. My conscious instinct\r\nwas to reject as useless ; but the impression conveyed to mewas that it came to me from someone who thought it good.\r\nIf anyone had said \u2018 You\u2019re quite wrong, and the person con- veying this message is right \u2019, I should have got oceans of\r\nscript\r\nConscious and deliberate rejection of impressions dulyreceived may, one can well believe, be the cause of a good manygaps and incoherences in the scripts. But there is a class of\r\ncases which it will not cover, namely where there is an obvious\r\ndesire and even effort to give out, accompanied by a strange\r\nand almost mysterious inability to do so. Such expressions as \u201c I can hear the words, but I can\u2019t makemy lips say them\u2014they won\u2019t say them \u201d (D.T. of July 16, 1911)\r\nimply an inhibition which mere selective preference of one itemof a communication over another is insufficient to account for.\r\n^ The impression here recorded seems to have been an experience on the\r\nborder-line between a silent D.I. and a lone script. I do not gather that\r\nMrs Willett was sitting for script at the time, but had she proceeded to do so\r\nI have little doubt that a script would have resulted. As a matter of fact, the\r\nmain ideas conveyed in the imjjression did actually emerge in a script produced\r\non the following day (September 23, 1926) in my presence.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumsli ip 135\r\nThe following D.I. illustrates the point, and has besides an\r\ninterest of its own which I trust may be held to excuse my\r\nquoting it at considerable length.\r\nI should explain that the evening before this sitting I had\r\nbeen reading a paper to the Cambridge Branch of the S.P.R.\r\non Parallelism and. Telepathy. \u201c Epiphenomenalism \u201d was also\r\ntouched on incidentally, and, of course, in any discussion of\r\nthese two doctrines, the third psycho-physical doctrine\u2014that\r\nof \u201c Interactionism \u2014must be implicitly referred to, though\r\nI do not think the word was actually used. I had, however,\r\ndealt with all three in a paper contributed to the Hibbert Journal\r\n(April, 1910) ; and it is possible that Mrs Willett may have\r\nseen this paper, though I do not think she had.

It i.s seldom given in the scripts,and only when the automatist is in deep trance.\r\n140] Psychological Aspecf-<^ of Mrs Willetths Medinmship 139\r\nI have no obvious explanation to offer of the difficulty of\r\nemission exemplified in this D.I., hut I suspect it to be connected\r\nin some way or other with a lack of harmonious co-operation\r\nbetween the different elements in the personality of the medium,\r\nwhether we call these elements the subliminal and the siipraliminal or regard them as distinct centres of consciousness\r\nwhose relation to each other varies from all but complete\r\nindependence to at least an appearance of complete unity.\r\nThe communicators declare that a general suspension of the\r\ngiving-out power results from the \u201c incarnate spirit \u201d losing\r\ncontrol of \u201c its own supraliminal \u201d, and therewith the control\r\nof the medium\u2019s mechanism of utterance. The supraliminal\r\nceases to record because it ceases to receive from the subliminal.\r\nI suggest as one possible explanation of the incapacity to give\r\nout particular parts of a message that it may be due to active\r\nresistance on the part of the supraliminal. It receives, but is unwilhng to transmit. Why it should be unwilhng in any given\r\ninstance may be difficult to say. In the case before us the\r\nreluctance might arise from sheer irritation and disgust at being\r\ncalled upon to play a part in the exposition of a subject in winch\r\nit takes no interest, and the technical terms of which it does\r\nnot understand. Readers of \u201c The Ear of Dionysius \u201d will re- member the passage in which the automatist gives vent to her\r\nannoyance at the task imposed upon her ; \u201cOh, Edmund says\r\npowder first and jam afterwards. You see it seems a long time\r\nsince I was here with them\u2014and I want to talk and enjoy\r\nmyself {spoken querulously). And I\u2019ve all the time to keep on\r\nworking, and seeing and listening to siich boring old\u2014Oh ' Ugh ! \u201d A more frequent cause (it may fairly be conjectured) of\r\nunwillingness to record is the fear whicli often, especially in\r\nthe early days of her medinmship, used to assail the automatist,\r\nthat the message which reaches her comes not from the ostensible communicators but from something in herself. The communicators are, in fact, well aware of this sceptical attitude,\r\nand more than once complain of the obstacles which it places\r\nin their way.\r\nAnother possible explanation would be to suppose that the\r\nrapport between the subliminal and the suprahminal, though\r\nnot wholly destroyed as in the case of the complete suspension\r\n140 Psycliolnriical Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Medinmship [part 140]\r\nof the giving-out power, is nevertheless at times too imperfectto permit of the subliminal effectively impressing iipon thesupraliminal those j;)arts of a message the reception of whichmight in any case have been expected to prove difficult. Someapprehension of the general sense might be imparted, but notthe expression of it in precise terms. The remedy would thenbe to make the rapp)ort more perfect ; and the intervention ofL , described in the D.I. we have been considering, wouldbe directed to this end, just as, on the other supposition, its object would be to overcome the reluctance of the supraliminal.Perplexing doid^ts may easily be raised with respect to bothexplanations ; but these are of a kind that are bound toconfront us so soon as we try to face the fundamental questionthat has been haunting the background of our inquiry all thetime\u2014Who or what is the \u201c I \u201d of the scripts ?\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nDISSOCIATION\r\nWhen describing the coniiiiuiiications characteristic of Willett\r\nphenomena as mental impressions which ajjpear to the autoniatist to have their origin in an agency w'hich she distinguishes\r\nfrom her conscious self, I was careful to leave room for the\r\nhypothesis which would ascribe such impressions to the action\r\nof one dissociated element of the personality upon another.\r\nThat this hypothesis will suffice to cover the whole of the\r\nphenomena of mediumship I do not believe. But if by dissociation we mean no more than that in certain circumstances\r\na plurality of conscioiisnesses manifests itself where previously\r\nthere had been at least an appearance of unity, the evidence\r\nfor it is overwhelming ^\r\n; and I am far from denying that interaction of the dissociated elements may be the complete explanation of some mediumistic experiences, and may enter as a\r\nfactor into many more. There is undoubtedly something of a paradox in describing\r\ncommunications as impressions which appear to the aiitomatist\r\nto have their origin in an agency other than herself, and then\r\nincluding in the scope of the term impressions which have their\r\norigin in a part of herself. Can there be a part of herself which\r\nis not her very self, yet may in some sense claim to be herself\r\nin virtue of being a co-conscious element in the make iip of her\r\ntotal personality ? Two consciousnesses, each with the attri-\r\n^ \u201c Di.ssociation \u201d natui'ally suggests a precedent condition of association ; but it would be unsafe to assume as certain tliat Ijefore dissociatioir (or after\r\nit) the dissociated elements of a j^ersonality are in closer relation than during\r\ndissociation. During dissociation, and while commimication is going on, they\r\nat least interact. It is conceivable\u2014though this is not my own view\u2014that in the normal state preceding and following dissociation their relation may be\r\nthat of mutual indifference and latency, and the sole bond of connection the\r\nfact of their being asssociatod witli the same bodily organism. It is jjossible to question even the very existence of secondary selves when not in process\r\nof manifestation.\r\n141\r\n142 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship [partbutes of a self, are manifested during dissociation. Has oneof them a better title than the other to be regarded as the trueself of the automatist ? If so, is the true self of the automatistthe consciousness which impresses, or the consciousness whichreceives the impression, the agent or the percipient ? Or shouldwe reserve the name of true self to the unduplicated normalconsciousness which the ordinary man habitually identifieswith himself ? What, in any case, is the relation of the dissociated selves to the normal consciousness before and afterdissociation ? These are difticidt questions, and to ask themis to start other questions no less difficult. The whole subjectbelongs to a region of mystery, and any attempt to unravel its\r\ncomplexities must probably be for a long time to come provisional and speculative. I am fully aware that any suggestions1 may be able to offer are necessarily of this character ; butI am not without hope that a careful study of Willett phenomenamay at least add a few stones to the foundations on which asatisfactory theory of human personality may eventually bebuilt.\r\nIn the Willett records the great majority of communicationspurport to come from the spirit world. There are a few cases,however, in winch no claim of this kind is made, and which wemay prima facie assume to be cases of impressions produced inone dissociated element of the personality by the agency of another. The lengthy passages cited on pp. 69-74 and pp. 112 ff. are instances in point. I am afraid I must ask the reader to re-read these with some care with a view to their bearing on thesubject of the present chapter. Let us designate the passagesin question by the letters A and B respectively.\r\nIn A, if my interpretation is right, which I admit is by nomeans certain, two \u201c I\u2019s \u201d are in evidence, an \u201c I \u201d that communicates certain of its experiences past and present, and an\u201c I \u201d that receives the communication and is responsible forreproducing it vocally. To the receiving \u201cI \u201d it would appearthat the communication was being conveyed to it by an agencyother than itself. Yet the experiences described seem certainlyto be presented in a form which suggests that they are to betaken as experiences of the automatist herself, while we havealso to identify with the automatist herself the \u201c I \u201d whichreceives and utters.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willettis Meclmmship 143\r\nOn the whole I am inclined to regard the \u201c I \u201d who tells the\r\ntale of her vision in this script as a secondary self whose communication is repeated verbatim in the first person by the\r\nreceiving and recording self. Repetition in the first person of\r\nthe remarks of a communicator is a frequent occurrence in the\r\ncase of messages purporting to come from Gurney or Myers ; and if my interpretation is right it would tend to confirm my\r\nidea that the modus op>erandi is the same whether the communicator be a secondary self or an independent spirit. I should add that throughout the spoken portion of the\r\nsitting I judge Mrs Willett to have been in a state of partial,\r\nbut not profound, trance.\r\nDuring the experience described in B she was clearly wide\r\nawake and fully aware of her surroundings. The drama so vividly related by Mrs Willett begins with the self in what\r\nI suppose we may assume to be its normal nndnplicated condition. Dissociation first shows itself in a \u201c knock-down \u201d\r\nconviction that an action contemplated by the norznal self\r\nmust not be carried out. This inhibitory impression we are\r\nentitled to treat as a form of \u201ccommunication \u201d. In the next phase the dissociation is carried a step further.\r\nTwo contrasted \u201c minds \u201d appear on the stage together. (3ne\r\nof these (called by Mrs W. Mind No. 1), which I take to be the\r\nsource of the inhibition, proceeds to cause certain movements\r\nof the body and limbs which, from its own point of view, are evidently purposeful. Mind No. 2 (described by Mrs Willett as \u201c me as I know myself \u201d) plays no part in the production of the\r\nmovements, does not understand their object, and looks on at\r\nthem with wonder and incomprehension. Finally, the two\r\nminds seem to \u201c flash together \u201d ; normality is restored, and\r\n\u201c I at once knew \u201d, says Mrs Willett, \u201c what I was to do \u201d. This very remarkable experience contains several points of\r\nspecial interest.\r\nOne of the questions which I mooted at the beginning of the\r\npresent chapter was whether the true self of the automatist was\r\nto be identified (1) with the consciousness which impresses, or\r\n(2) with the consciousness that receives the impression, or (3)\r\nwith the unduplicated normal consciousness which precedes\r\nand follows dissociation. Mi\u2019s Willett\u2019s experience described\r\nabove suggests a part answer to this question by identifying the\r\n144 Psychological Aspecis of Mrs Willetfs Alediimiship [partmind receiving the impression (Mind No. 2) with \u201c me as I knowmyself \u201d\u2014that is to say, with the normal consciousness. Forher these two I\u2019s are one and the same self. If that view beaccepted\u2014and for my part I am ready to accept and to adoptit as my own\u2014the position is considerably simplified. Thethree selves with which we started as possible competitors in\r\nthe claim to be regarded as the true self of the automatist havebeen reduced to two. It is possible, no doubt, to draw a distinction between the normal self in normal conchtions and thesame self as modified during dissociation. There may even besome convenience in using the term \u201c primary self\u201d to signify\r\nthe normal self as thus modified\u2014provided always we are onour guard against the mistake of treating the normal and theprimary self as distinct jisychical entities. They are the sameself\u2014the same Ego or centre of consciousness\u2014only withdifferent environment and a changed content of consciousness.\r\nThey are not two Egos, but successive states of one. Mrs Willett\u2019s identification of Mind No. 2 with her normalself stands in strong contrast with the sharp distinction whichshe draws between Mind No. 2 and Mind No. 1. Note that shedoes not actually use the expression \u201c me \u201d or \u201c I \u201d of MindNo. 1 at all. It might even be contended that Mind No. 1 is not really a dissociated self, but an independent entity outside\r\nthe personality altogether. Nevertheless this was clearly notthe view of it held by Mrs Willett, nor do I believe it to be thetrue view. Her own instinctive conception is implied in the\r\nwords \u201c The two minds flashed together, and I at once knewwhat I was to do \u201d. She pictures to herself the two mindsjoining together so as to form one mind. But the one mind is\r\nstill Mind No. 2. It is Mind No. 1 that has ceased to be in\r\nevidence. This account of the phenomenon may not be its\r\ncorrect interpretation ; but it is clear evidence that she\r\nregarded Mind No. 1 as part other own personality, and not as an intrxider from outside.\r\nAnother point of interest is provided by the automaticphysical movements caused by Mind No. 1. If Mind No. 1 andMind No. 2 are to be regarded as roughly equivalent to thesubliminal and the supraliminal of the scripts it would seem to\r\nfollow that the subliminal is able to produce intelligent movements of the body quite independently of the su|)raliminal,\r\n140] Psychological Asjjects of Mrs WillettA Mediumship 145\r\nand perhaps even against its will. On the other hand, in the\r\npassage quoted on p. 130 above we are given by the communicators to understand that the externalisation of messages\r\nthrough voice or hand is only possible in Mrs Willett\u2019s case to\r\nthe subliminal acting through the supraliminal. Are the two\r\nviews consistent with each other ? They do not seem easy to\r\nreconcile. But the action of the mental on the physical is so mysterious, and so little light is really thrown upon it by the\r\nWillett phenomena or by the statements of the communicators\r\nrespecting \u201c process \u201d, that I prefer to leave the question\r\nunanswered.^ So far as I recollect, the only other automatic\r\nmovements recorded among Willett phenomena which the\r\nautomatist is not only not conscious of producing, but is conscious of not producing\u2014are those which occurred in connection with the Dorr script.- But in that case the movements\r\nwere claimed by the communicators as a telergic effect brought\r\nabout by themselves. It is very difficult to get from automatists\r\nany precise account of the sense in which they feel their scripts\r\nto be automatic ; but I believe the cases in which they appear\r\nto themselves to be looking on while the hand is being moved\r\nby an apparently independent agency are rare. In the Willett\r\nrecords the Dorr script seems to be the only clear example.\r\nBut an experience of December 8, 1908, may be w'orth noting,\r\nwhen the automatist tried for script in obedience to a strong\r\nimpulse, and records that \u201c writing began almost before pen\r\ntouched paper \u201d.\r\nI have next to call attention, but rather by way of contrast\r\nthan of resemblance, to another Willett record, as remarkable\r\nin its way as either of those which we have just been considering.\r\nThe incident described occmrred towards the end of the waking\r\nstage following the trance D.I. of May 13, 1912.\r\nThe automatist had already remarked that the communicators were \u201c aU gone \u201d, and after a pause had opened her eyes\r\nand looked round her, though she failed at first to recognise the\r\nroom in which we were sitting. She was still in a condition of\r\n^ In the D.I. of May 11, 1912, quoted on pp. 135-1.38 above, the epiphenomenal and parallelistic h5rpotheses concerning the relations of mind and body\r\nare rejected in favour of interactionism.

The account of what ensued is taken from a note ch\u2019awnup by me within two days of the sitting. I had supposed thewaking stage to be coming to an end when\r\n\r\nMrs Willett proceeded to talk m what might, save for twopecuharities, have been taken to be a cpiite normal manner.The two peculiarities were : (1) that, instead of looking at me,she seemed to be for the most part deliberately looking in\r\nanother direction, or, when she did occasionally turn her eyes\r\nstraight towards me, to be focussing them on somethingbeyond and not on me at all ; (2) that, although the conversation was carried on between us in the ordinary way, and lasted\r\nat least ten minutes, she never during that time seemed to\r\nrealise who 1 was, oi\u2019 to take any trouble to do so. At onemoment I asked her point-blank to look at me and say if sheknew me. Upon that she turned towards me and answeredthat she did not, but thought she might be able to make outwho I was, if she tried sufficiently hard ; adding that she did\r\nnot wish to try just then, becau.se she wanted to go on talking\r\nabout Henry Sidgwick. In effect, the conversation was chiefly\r\nupon H. S., though in the course of it she remarked that sheseemed to see me between two others, and thereupon took upthe pencil and drew the figure given below.\r\no~l o\u2014o\r\nI The middle circle, she said, was me, and the two outer onesthe others with whom I was connected. I asked whether either or both of \u201c the others \u201d had already \u201c passed over \u201d. \u201c I make the division there \u201d, she said, drawing the vertical\r\nline. \u201c This one \u201d (pointing to the circle on the left), \u201c is onthe other side ; you and the other are still here \u201d. Her remarks about H. S. were qiiite interesting, but I madeno attempt to take thenr down in writing, as the conversationbetween us was too rapid. She described the impression whichshe had gathered from her suiDernormal experience of him.Among other things she said she thought he was rather deficient\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumshi'p 147\r\nin a feeling for things of beauty in his surromidings ; and\r\npointing to the tiles of the fireplace of the drawing-room at\r\nGrange Terrace, Cambridge, where we were sitting, she said \u201c For instance, he would not mind those, whereas they would\r\nbe impossible for me She called the house Hemy Sidgwick\u2019s\r\nhouse, and on my saying it was Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s house, insisted\r\nthat it was his, not hers, that his books were there and that he\r\nfrequently came and looked at them ! She said H. S. often put questions to her on philosophical\r\nsubjects expressed in simple language in order to find ont how\r\na particular view was likely to strilm the ordinary commonsense mind. His attitude as a thinker when in the body had\r\nbeen much misunderstood. He believed it woidd be many\r\nages before humanity reached anj'thing like a basis of certainty,\r\nand in the mean time vast assumptions must be made. But\r\nhe did not Idte making assumptions, and often objected to the\r\nassumptions made by Myers.\r\nA good deal more was said, which I do not remember with\r\nsufficient clearness to record. But the point is, that it was all quite coherent, and that, apart from the peculiarities I have\r\nmentioned, there was nothing to make one suspect that she\r\nw\u2019as not in a perfectly normal condition. No waking stage\r\nwithin my experience has at all closely resemided this one ; but some of its features appear in those of March 13th and 15th,\r\n1912, when 0. J. L. was in charge. These cases show a similar\r\ncoherence of thought, so much so that when I first read O. J. L.\u2019s\r\naccount I wondered whether he had not set down a good deal\r\nthat Avas uttered after Mrs Willett had become completely\r\nnormal again. In the light of what I have now myself AAutnessed,\r\nI am more doubtful about this. It is worth noting that during\r\nthe waking stage of March 13th, 1912, Mrs Willett, although\r\nshe does recognise 0. J. L., hesitates a little, and seems not\r\nquite confident that she is right.\r\nThe case here recorded (let us designate it by the letter C)\r\nhas one marked featime in common with both A and B. It is not suggested in any of the three that a communicator from\r\noutside is taking any active part in the proceedings. On the\r\nother hand, whereas in both A and B two dissociated selves\r\nmanifest themselves simultaneously, we have apparently one\r\n148 Psychological Asjjects of Mrs WilleWs Medium,shvp [partspeaker, and one speaker only, on the stage in C. In otherwords A and B are cases of co-conscious intelligences interacting\r\nwith each other, whereas C presents the appearance of a single\r\nintelligence chscoursing upon its own past and present experiences. Does the intelligence manifesting itself in C correspondto Mind No. 2 in B, i.e. to \u201c me as I know myself \u201d, or to MindNo. 1 from which Mind No. 2 expressly distinguishes itself ? Myown view is that it corresponds to Mind No. 2, but to Mind No. 2\r\nin a state of gradual transition to normality. The communicators\u2014in this case claiming to be the spirits of deceased persons\r\nare said to have \u201c gone \u201d. If, instead of being what they claimedto be, they were in reality dissociated secondary selves belongingto the personality of the automatist, we might describe thesituation by saying that, dissociation having come to an end,the secondary selves have vanished from ken, leaving the})ercipient or \u201c primary \u201d self in solitary j^ossession. But this\r\npercipient or primary self is none other than the normal self\r\nin an abnormal phase. The identity of the \u201c I \u201d is maintainedthroughout the waking stage, at the end of which it is unmistakably Mrs Willett\u2019s normal self. In the transition tonormality a change has undoubtedly taken place. I hold thatthis must be regarded as a change in the content of conscious-ness of a single self, not a change from one self to another.Probably the present case is but an outstanding example ofsomething that occurs in a more or less pronounced form in\r\nevery waking stage, especially when the automatist has beendeeply entranced. Even after dissociation has completelyceased the single self may still retain some memory of its experiences during dissociation\u2014a memory which tends to fadeaway like a dream as consciousness of its normal surroundingsreturns.\r\nTo return to A and B : up to this point we have treateddissociation as being a division of the personality into twocomponents, roughly corresponding to the supraliminal and thesubliminal of Myers. What warrant have we for limiting thenumber of components to two ? Myers himself^ regardedhuman personality as in some sense \u201c polypsychic \u201d, andconsidered it \u201c permissible and convenient \u201d to treat \u201c asiddiminal self\u201d and \u201c siddiminal selves \u201d as interchangeable' Human Personulilt\/, vol. i., sect. 112.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WiJletfs Alediumship 149\r\nterms. His conception of the different \u201c selves \u201d as so many\r\nlayers or strata of a single psychical entity is, as I have said, one which I cannot accept. Bnt on the question of multiplicity versus duality I think he was right. Certain passages\r\nfrom Willett records, in which the antomatist, speaking in the\r\nfirst person, describes her experiences at the moment, either\r\nduring trance or in the course of emerging from trance, may be\r\nquoted in support of this view ; and we shall come across it again\r\nlater in statements attributed to the communicators themselves.\r\nD.I. of January 21, 1912. {Present, G.

Theconception, to which they clearly point, is that of a personality\r\nconsisting of a multiplicity of selves normally co-operating so as to ])roduce the appearance of a single self, but capable of\r\ndissociation into more or less independently-acting psychic\r\nelements. To some such conception I think we are almost\r\ndriven ; but the nature of the selves and of their mutualrelations remains a very obscure proldem.\r\nA chain of mo's is represented in the first extract as connecting\r\nwith another apparently analogous chain of spirit communicators ; and in the second extract a message from the communicators is said to be handed on from one me to another with\r\npossible loss in the process of transmission.\r\nThe idea of a chain of me's may not be fundamentally incompatible with Myers\u2019s conception of a unitary soul differentiated\r\ninto distinguishable strata, but nevertheless essentially one. This is the doctrine expounded, though not, I think, withperfect consistency, in Human Personality ; and it is also, as we shall see in Part II., the doctrine expounded by the groupwho piu\u2019port to communicate through Mi\u2019S Willett\u2019s medium\r\nship. It does not, however, appear to me to be the mostnatural interpretation of Mrs Willett\u2019s own experiences as described by her in the passages I have quoted. Such phrasesas \u201c a number of me\u2019s whirling round and joining to make oneme \u201d seem to apply much more aptly to individual psychic\r\nunits than to \u201c strata \u201d of a unitary consciousness. Moreover,the description of a chain of me\u2019s continuous with a chain ofspirit communicators surely points to a relation between theme\u2019s similar to the relation assumed to exist between the spirit\r\ncommunicators and the medium, and between the spirit\r\ncommunicators themselves\u2014in other words, to a relation\r\nbetween distinct psychic entities. The validity of this inference\r\ndoes not depend on the assumption that the communicatorsreally are the spirits they purport to be, but rests on theundoubted fact that that is what they are taken to be by the\r\nauto7natist. The argument would still hold good even if wechoose to regard tfie communicators as so many adchtional me\u2019smasquerading as spirits.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs WIedimnship 151\r\nIncidentally I may remark that if the relation between the\r\nunits in any place in the combined chain is telepathic, there is good reason for supposing that it is telepathic throughout.\r\nWhatever may he the method of communication between\r\nthe different me'\r\ns\r\nwhich form links in the chain, the chain itself\r\nis represented as terminating in a me which observes the other\r\nm,e's, and is the ultimate recipient of the message that is being\r\nconveyed through them. It continues to observe the other\r\nme's on the breaking up of the chain in the early stages of a\r\nreturn to normality ; and when the automatist uses the first person to describe her own experiences it is always the observing\r\nme that speaks. I have no hesitation in treating it as a phase\r\nof the automatist\u2019s normal self\u2014in fact as the me to which, in\r\ndiscussing the experience described in B, I have applied the\r\nterm \u201c primary self \u201d. The primary seif, I once more repeat, is the same self as the normal self ; but by reason of dissociation\r\nthe environment is different, and therewith the mental content\r\nlikewise.\r\nThe reader wiU not be surprised when I add that for me this\r\nsame self is also the automatist\u2019s true self. Myers, however,\r\nthought otherwise, holchng that the true self is to be found in\r\nthe subhminal ; a doctrine that appears to be accepted by the\r\ncommunicators in Willett scripts. The subject is one that calls\r\nfor further examination, but I prefer to leave it alone for the\r\npresent with the intention of retmaiing to it in a later chapter.\r\nThe question may be asked, Does the control of the bodily\r\norganism during chssociation remain throughout with the\r\nprimary me, or does it on occasion pass either to a secondary me\r\nor to a genuinely external communicator ? Whatever may be\r\nthe case with sensitives of the Piper type, my impression about\r\nMrs Willett is that even in trance her primary self is never\r\ncUsplaced from general command of the organism, though some\r\npartial chsplacement appears to have occurred in the exceptional instances described on p. 145 above. It is to be noted\r\nthat in both of these exceptional instances the automatist was\r\nawake and aware of her surrounchngs.\r\nThe degree of departure from normality exhibited by the\r\nprimary self during dissociation varies widely in different cases. Broadly speaking, it is greatest when the automatist is deeply\r\nentranced. It is reduced almost to the vanishing point in\r\n1\")2 Psychological Aspects of Mrs WillefPs Medimnship [partsilent D.I.s and lone scripts. Here an interesting questionarises. If communications are accepted as coming from a sourcewithin the sensitive some degree of dissociation must needs bepresumed in order to account for the fact that they appear toreach her from an independent agency. But now let us supposethat the communications are really what they purport to be,\r\nnamely, messages from a genuinely external source. In thatcase I see no absolute necessity for postulating any degree ofdissociation however slight. An external communicator impressing his message on the normal self should be at least as\r\neffective in creating a sense of alien origin as a secondary self\r\ncommunicating with a primary self. Myers, indeed, took it for\r\ngranted that a telepathic message from an external source canonly reach the supraliminal through the subhminal as intermediary. This would make dissociation an invariable factor in\r\nthe process of communication from whatever source. I canwell believe that it is a frequent factor in the process, but wherethe possibility of an external communicator is admitted I see no reason for sxipposing that it is a necessary one.^\r\nThat the passage from normality through dissociation to\r\nrestored normality is a passage from at least apparent unity to\r\nduality or plurahty and so back again is not likely to be disputed. But the nature of the unity, and the relation of the\r\ndissociated elements to the normal self before and after dissociation, offer a wide field for doubt and speculation. If myidentification of the primary self with the normal self is accepted,\r\nthe problem is really concerned only with the secondary self\r\n(or selves). When Mrs Willett in Extract B describes the\r\n\u201c flashing together \u201d of the two minds, and in the D.I. ofJanuary 21, 1912, speaks of a number of mPs whirling roundand joining to make one me, what is the true interpretation of\r\nher experience ? Is it that, when combined, the various me\u2019s\r\nwill have lost their individual identity and collapsed into a\r\nsingle unitary self ? Or are we to suppose that, although theycontinue to exist as individual psychic units and to interact\r\nwith the primary self, consciousness of that interaction has\r\nceased at least so far as the primary self is concerned ? Or,\r\nagain, should we carry tliis idea still further, and suppose that,\r\nwhen the sensitive.retmms to a normal condition, the interaction\r\n1 See pp. 276 ff. below.\r\n140] Psi\/rJinlofiiral Aspects of Mr-'f Willett's MeAiumship 153\r\nbetween the primary and the secondary me's conies to an end al\r\ntogether, leaving the primary me in sole occupation of the field ? I doubt whether we are yet in a position definitely to answer\r\nthese questions, or to feel confident that even the formulation\r\nof them is not inadequate and misleading. All three hypotheses\r\nmay be wide of the mark. But if we are to choose between them,\r\nmy own view, for what it is worth, inclines strongly to the\r\nsecond as at least likely to be nearer the truth than either of\r\nthe others.\r\nIf we consider the various types of mediumistic communications as distinguished from the content in any given case, are we driven to regard any of them as beyond the competence of a\r\ndissociated self to produce by its own unassisted agency ? I do\r\nnot think we are. The wide range of phenomena extending from\r\nsimple dream experiences and ordinary automatic writing to\r\nthe hallucinations imposed on iVIiss Beauchamp by \u201c Sally \u201d in\r\nthe famous case described by Dr Morton Prince, seems to point\r\nto the activity of a dissociated self as the sufficient explanation\r\nof every type of message. True, we have still to account for the\r\ncuriously persistent claim\u2014on that sup]3osition, fraudulent\u2014-of communicators to be discarnate spirits. But it is the supernormal element in the cotitent of communications,^ coupled with\r\nthe general evidence in favour of telepathy, that chiefly throws\r\ndoubt on the all-sufficiency of the explanation.\r\nIts insufficiency would be partly remedied if it were legitimate\r\nto assume the existence of dissociated selves endowed with\r\npowers of \u201c independent clairvoyance \u201d. An entity so endowed\r\nmight, out of its own resources, and without the co-operation\r\nof any other mind, become a communicator of knowledge\r\nsupernormally acquired. I would not venture to pronounce an\r\nexplanation on these lines of certain mediumistic phenomena to\r\nbe impossible, though it could not be stretched to cover the\r\nwhole ground. But it involves an incursion into the marvellous\r\nat least as great as the hypothesis of telepathy. The evidence\r\nfor it is insufficient in quantity and quality : in Mrs Willett\u2019s\r\n1 Cf. H.P., vol. ii., pp. 198-9.\r\n- Written before I had seen Professor Rhine\u2019s work on Extra-sensorij\r\nPerception, which certainly establishes a prima facie case in favour of \u201c pure\r\n\u201d\r\nclairvoyance.\r\n154 Psychological Aspects of Mrs WilletPs Mediumshig) [partcase it is, in my opinion, wholly wanting. Certainly there is nomanifestation in her records of knowledge supernormallyobtained that could not be more easily and simply accountedfor by telepathic interaction with another mind.\r\nShort of crediting a dissociated self with the faculty ofclairvoyantly acquiring knowledge on its own account, it is possible to sxippose that in certain cases and in certain directionsit may possess exceptional capacities exceeding those exhibitedby the normal self. Much automatic utterance is of so feeble acharacter as to suggest that the intelligence responsible for it\r\nis inferior in capacity to the normal self. If we could be surethat this inferiority is invariable, we should have to seek elsewhere for the source of any automatic product that clearlysurpassed the limits of the automatist\u2019s normal capacity. Theredoes not seem, however, to be any good reason for assumingthat dissociated selves are necessarily either inferior or superior,mentally or morally, to the normal self. As Myers says, \u201c Hidden in the depths of our being is a rubbish-heap as well as atreasure-house \u201d. The most notable instance that I know of in the history ofpsychical research, not even excepting the famous case ofHelene Smith, of a mediuniistic product exceeding what weshould expect from the known intellectixal abilities and mentalequipment of the axitomatist, is that presented by the case ofMrs Curran, now' Mrs Rogers, an American lady who, withoutgoing into trance, dictates in rapid and apparently unpremeditated flow long novels and pieces of poetry of literary merit veryfar beyond the recognised capacities of the normal self. In thecase of Helene Smith, Myers himself attributes the automaticproduct to the activity of a secondary self.^ In the case of MrsCurran, the ostensible communicator is a discarnate spirit\r\ncalling itself Patience Worth, and claiming to have lived its\r\nearthly life in England in the latter half of the seventeenthcentury. Here also an exjxlanation has been sought in purelysubliminal insjxiration ; and though in this particular instancethe explanation bristles with difficulties, the question of origin\r\nmxist still be regarded as an open one. I express no opinion oneway or the other and am content to follow Dr Walter Prince,\r\nwho has devoted a whole volume to the case, and who sums up1 HeeH.P., vol. ii., p. ].33.\r\n140] Psychological Aspecffi of M7's Willeffs Medivmship 155\r\nhis conclusions as follows : \u201c Either our concept of what we\r\ncall the subconscious must be radically altered, so as to inelude\r\npotencies of which we have hitherto had no knowledge, or else\r\nsome cause operating through but not originating in the subconsciousness of Mi\u2019S Curran must be aeknowledged If we\r\nreject the second alternative it only remains to accept Mrs\r\nCurran as a truly remarkable example of \u201c genius \u201d assuming\r\nthe most pronouncedly mediumistic form.\r\nI have cited the Patience Worth case here because it seems\r\nto me that we shall have just the same alternatives to ehoose\r\nbetween when we eome to deal in the second part of this paper\r\nwith statements made in Willett scripts respecting the modus\r\noperandi and the processes of communication. These statements, and also certain philosophical disquisitions, of which a specimen will be found in the Appendix to tliis paper, whatever\r\nelse we may think of them, show a power of thought on difficult\r\nand abstruse subjects which, knowing Mi\u2019s Willett as intimately\r\nas I do, I eertainly should not have expected from her normal\r\nself. The contrast between product and normal capacity is not\r\nso striking in Mds Willett\u2019s case as in that of Mrs Curran, for\r\nMrs Willett is a well-read and exceptionally intelligent lady,\r\nand if she gave her mind to the subjects in question eould\r\ndoiibtless sueceed in gaining a more or less adequate grasp of\r\nthem. But, as a matter of fact, though she possesses a copy of\r\nthe abridged edition of Human Personality, and must be presumed to have read it, and is besides aequainted with the\r\ncontributions made by Mrs Verrall, Mr Piddington, Miss\r\nJohnson, and Sir Oliver Lodge to vols. xx., xxi., xxii., xxiv., and\r\nXXV. of the Proceedings of the S.P.R., the psychological aspects\r\nof psychical research have singularly little interest for her.\r\nThey have seldom been mentioned between us ; and judging\r\nfrom remarks that have fallen from her from time to time,\r\nI should say that her normal understanding of them is very\r\nmuch below the level reached in the treatment of them in her\r\nscripts. If I had before me only those Willett scripts to which\r\nI have been referring, I franldy admit that I should have been\r\nat a loss whether to attribute them to subliminal activity or to a source entirely outside the personality of the medium.\r\nProbably, like Dr Walter Prince, I should be content to suspend\r\njudgment. But having before me the whole of the Willett\r\n156 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willeft's Mecliumship [partscripts, and being in a ]iositinn to com]iare them with the scripts\r\nof other antomatists of onr gronj) and with facts known to meInxt not known to Mrs Willett herself, I am personally of opinionthat they contain evidence of supernornially acquired knowledgewhich no mere subliminal mentation will suffice to account for.\r\nMy readers are not in this position, and for reasons stated in theintroduction to this paper T cannot put them in possession ofthe considerations that have chiefly weighed with me. All theyhave to go upon in the way of evidence of supernormal communications is that provided by the papers already publishedin the Proceedings of the Society and mentioned in the introduction. I cannot complain if they do what I should probablydo in their place, and suspend Judgment. And that, indeed, is\r\nall I ask them to do.\r\nI conclude this chapter with some brief reflections arising outof a comparison of mediumship with genius\u2014the latter termbeing here used in the sense given to it by Myers, which makesits essential characteristic to consist in the interaction of supraliminal with svdiliminal mentation.^ Myers\u2019s definition deliberately excludes from the scope of genius inspiration directly\r\nproceeding from a spiritual source ^\r\n; and in this respect it is\r\n])lain that mediumship extends to a wider field than genius,\r\nfor it includes all communications that seem to the automatistto proceed from some independent source, irrespective of thequestion whether that source be genuinely external or whatMyers calls subliminal.\r\nFrom my point of view\u2014that is to say, in relation to thenature of the process\u2014this limitation of the field of genius seemsarbitrary, and even irrelevant. 1 am unwilling to regardinspiration proceeding from a mental source within the personality as essentially different in kind from inspiration proceeding from a mind external to it. Biit apart from thelimitation in question, what, if any, is the distinction betweengenius as understood by Myers and mediumship ? There are cases on record where genius takes a purely mediumistic form.1 Of. H.P., vol. i., 25. 71.\r\n2 Incidentally I may remark that it also involves a refusal to admit that\r\nthe sui^raiiminal consciousness is ca23able on its own account of producing a work of genius\u2014a Ihnitation which I cannot but regard as arbitrary andunsupported by evidence.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's MediumsTiip 167\r\n\u201c On ne travaille pas \u201d, wi\u2019ites De Musset, \u201c on ecoute, c\u2019est\r\ncomme un inconnu qui vous parle a I\u2019oreille ^ The very\r\nwords might have been used by Mrs Willett in describing her\r\nsilent D.I.s. The experience of Helene Smith and JVIrs Cmran,\r\nto which I have already referred, however interpreted, seem to\r\nbe phenomena of the same order. A distinction between genius\r\nand mediumship is evidently not to be looked for where dissociation is as clearly manifested as it was in the case of De\r\nMusset. It is where there is no manifest evidence of dissociation\r\nthat genius, conceived as successful co-operation of subliminal\r\nwith supraliminal elements, parts company with mediumshij).\r\nWhen a medium\u2019s apprehension of a\r\n\u201c message \u201d as proceeding\r\nfrom an agency other than herself comes to an end the niediuniistic activity as such ceases with it. It is otherwise with the\r\nactivity of genius. If genius consists, as Myers holds, in the\r\ninteraction of subhminal with supraliminal mentation, we must\r\nrecognise that in the majority of cases that interaction goes on\r\nsubconsciously so far as the normal self is concerned. The\r\nthoughts resulting from it in the conscious mind wiU then\r\nappear to that mind to be its own thoughts, not thoughts\r\nimpressed on it from elsewhere. I am far from denying that\r\nthere may be truth in this conception. But it is obvious that\r\nit must be a matter of inference. I do not see how we can have\r\ndirect evidence of it.\r\n^ Quoted in H.P., vol. i., p. 89.\r\nPART II\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\nIn Part I. of this paj)er I have considered the phenomena ofMrs Willett\u2019s inediumship mainly in the light thi\u2019own uponthem by the observation of the investigators, and by thecomments and descriptions of her experiences provided by thesensitive herself either in retrospect or during the actual courseof the sittings. My next task will be to extract from the recordsand set forth as clearly as I can the statements pm\u2019porting tocome from the communicators, and to express their views uponthe psychology of inediumship and the methods and processesof communication.\r\nThese statements, as might have been anticipated, fromwhatever som\u2019ce they really proceed, show general conformitywith the opinions held by Myers and expounded in his greatwork on Human Personality. But the conformity is by no meanscomplete ; the differences wiU, I think, be foimd of no less\r\ninterest than the resemblances. Moreover, in the descriptionof the modus operandi in certain cases the scripts present uswith an elaboration of detail to which nothing in HumanPersonality, or, so far as I know, an3rwhere else in the hteratureof the subject can fairly be said to correspond.\r\nThough the communicators usually speak as with theauthority of an insight claiming to be superior to ours, it is interesting to note how repeatedly and emphatically they insist\r\nupon the hmitations of them knowledge, and on the need for\r\ncontinued research and experiment on their own side as well as on ours.

Whatever may be its truenature, the control represents itself as the surviving spirit ofsomebody once in the flesh, which for the time being supplantsthe spirit of the medium in the use of the physical organism,whether to express its own ideas or to transmit messages fromother spirits. In the latter case it is these other spirits who arespoken of as \u201c communicators \u201d, and the process by which theycommunicate with the control is jJi'esuniably assumed to betelepathic, though I do not think this is always made clear.\r\nSometimes, however, the control itself gives place to a communicator, who is then said to be in \u201c direct communication \u201d\r\n; i.e. the relation of the direct communicator to the medium is in noessential respect different from that of the regular control whenthe regular control is expressing its own ideas and not transmitting messages from others. Direct communication is, in fact,\r\nequivalent to control ; and certain of Mrs Piper\u2019s trancepersonalities, who began as communicators, ended by themselves taking on the j)art of regular controls, transmittingmessages from other spirits and generally assuming charge ofthe organism of the medium. In control and direct communication so conceived there does not seem to be any room fortelepathy in the commonly accepted apjflication of the term,which limits it to interaction between one mind and another.The process is telergical, not telepathic. The self of the mediumis off the stage altogether, and what we are left with is thecontrolling spirit using the physical organism of the medium toconvey its message to the sitter.\r\nIn communications of the Willett type, on the other hand,the self of the medium is never oil the stage, and telepathy104\r\n[part 140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumsh ip 165\r\nwould seem to be of the essence of the process.

This is not pos.session Lodge not in the senseof a direct control the element of telepathy is greater than thatof the ordinary direct control . . .\r\nThese pronouncements leave no donbt concerning the viewsof the communicators on the essentially mental character ofMrs Willett\u2019s mediumship. According to them not only is themessage tele])athically conveyed to the subliminal of thesensitive, but in certain cases, if not in all, it passes from hersubliminal to her suynaliniinal by what can only be conceivedas a mental process before it is externalised in the form ofspeech or writing. The actual externalisation seems to berepresented as the work of the snj)raliminal. As we shall seelater the communicators do not admit the passage of thoughtfrom s\\d)liminal to supraliminal to be telepathic. But if it is not telc])athic, what is it ? To this point we shall have occasionto return hereafter.\r\nThe extracts collected above raise another question to whichno clear answer seems to be provided in the scripts themselves.The communicators more than once deprecate trance in MrsWillett\u2019s case, yet the course of development of her mediumshipis clearly in the direction of trance. Her earUer communicationscame to her when she was in a state practically indistinguishable from normality\u2014when, indeed, any suspicion of abnormality rested entirely on the mere fact of communications being\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's 31ediumship 171\r\nreceived.^ Nor has the method of communication by lone\r\nscripts and silent D.I.s ceased at any period to be employed,\r\nthough it has been supplemented by automatic writing and\r\nutterance obtained in the presence of a sitter and showing a continuous progress through light trance to deeper trance,\r\nultimately culminating in a state in which the sensitive loses all consciousness of her surroundings except of the presence of the\r\nsitter, and on awaking retains no memory of what has happened\r\nduring the sitting.\r\nHow is this consistent with the distinct statements made by\r\nthe communicators that they \u201c do not want this to develop\r\ninto trance \u201d, or with the instruction given to Mrs Verrall at\r\nthe sitting of August 25, 1910, to check any appearance of\r\ntrance ? I have already given in Chapter I. of Part I. what I hope may\r\nbe accepted as a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty (see\r\np. 56 above). The communicators were putting Mrs Willett\r\nthrough a course of gradual training in mediumship. They were\r\naiming at something new, and by something new they meant\r\nsomething different from the Piper trance\u2014namely a condition\r\nin which, though the sensitive lost consciousness of her sur- roundings and memory of what happened during the sitting, she\r\nnevertheless, unlike IVIi\u2019s Piper, retained consciousness of her\r\nown personality throughout. To refuse to apply the term\r\n\u201c trance \u201d to such a condition seems to me misleading, and\r\nI have not thought it desirable in this matter to follow the\r\nexample of the communicators and depart from established\r\nusage. In the early days of her mediumship the idea of passing\r\ninto trance was repugnant to Mrs Willett. The communicators\r\nmay have avoided the word partly from fear of alarming her,\r\nbut chiefly, I think, they did so in order to emphasise the\r\nnovelty of the type of mediumsliip at which they were aiming.\r\nThey certainly have avoided the word most successfully. In\r\nthe whole series of scripts I can only And one clear instance of\r\nits being used to describe Willett conditions. Elsewhere it always means trance d la Piper.\r\n^ The mere fact of communications being received would not of itself be a valid ground for inferring abnormabty if we could be sme that they were\r\nderived from an extraneous source and not from a dissociated self. See on\r\nthis point my remarks on p. 152 above.\r\n172 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Medimnship [partThe novelty, then, consists in this, that even in deep tranceMrs Willett retains a consciousness of self, whereas Mrs Piperloses all sense of her own personality^\r\nWhy is so much importance attached to this difference ? Itis because it involves the whole difference that separatestelepathy from telergy, and telepathic communication from\u201c possession So long as the self of the medium is in evidencethe natural presumption is that any commimication from outside must be between mind and mind ; but if the self is whollyeliminated the externalisation of the message must be effectedby direct action on the physical organism of the medium bythe outside agency itself. Concerning the phenomena of the Piper trance the viewsexpressed or implied in Willett script are, broadly speaking, thesame that we find in Human Personality. The Myers of thescripts and the author of Human Personality are at one intreating the essential feature in Mrs Piper\u2019s case to be \u201c possession \u201d, by which is meant that the spirit of the mediumquits the body and that its place is taken by an invadingextraneous spirit. No attempt is made either in HumanPersonality or in the scripts to elucidate the process by whichthe invading spirit controls the physical organism, but it is practically taken for granted\u2014and I do not see what otherhypothesis is open to us\u2014that \u201c the extraneous spirit acts on aman\u2019s organism in very much the same way as the man\u2019s ownspirit habitually acts upon it Possession, in short, in the wider sense of the term, is simplythat relation of a mind to a body which enables it to interactwith and control the body. From the point of view of processit does not seem to matter whether the control be exercised byan invachng spirit or by the mind normally associated with thebody.^ Of comse, the question remains whether such invasion^ Whether t]ie coinmiinicators are justified iu describing tiie peculiarityas new I cannot say with confidence, though I do not think any case quitelike Mrs Willett\u2019s is to be found in Human Personality. Of late years Mrs Salter(Miss Helen Verrall), sitting with her husband as recorder, passes into trancewithout losing consciousness of self ; but her trance is a light one.\r\n\u201cH.P., vol. ii., jD. 197.\r\n^ Possession of the organism by a dissociated fragment of the medium\u2019spersonality is abundantly recognised by Myers, though he prefers to describe\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship 173\r\never actually takes place, and in particular whether the\r\n\u201c regular controls \u201d\u2014Phinuit and the Imperator Band\u2014are\r\nentitled to be regarded as extraneous spirits.\r\nThe Myers of Human Persoyiality ended by accepting as independent excarnate spirits not only the communicators\r\n\r\nsome of whom purport to take on occasion the place of the\r\nregular controls and \u201c possess \u201d the vacated body of the\r\nmedium\u2014but also the regular controls themselves, in spite of\r\nthe very strong arguments for regarding these, at least, as dissociated elements of the mechum\u2019s own personality. The\r\nindependent status of the regular controls is not disputed in\r\nWillett script, but neither is it so unambiguously affirmed as to\r\nconstitute a definite pronoimcement. Phinuit is never referred\r\nto in the scripts, the Imperator Band only once, and that in\r\nreply to a direct question put by Sir 0. J. L. The answer then\r\ngiven was so vague and evasive\u2014a thing rare in Willett script \u2014that one is tempted to read into it a desire to avoid any\r\nexpression of opinion on the subject.\r\nThe contrast drawn in Willett scripts between the WiUett\r\nphenomena and those of the Piper trance rests, as I have said,\r\nupon the distinction between telepathy and telergy, telergical\r\naction being the modus operandi of a spirit in possession of the\r\nmedium\u2019s physical orgamsm.\r\nOnce, and apparently only once, in the case of IVIrs WiUett\r\nare we given to understand that telergical methods were employed in place of telepathic. This was when the name Dorr\r\nwas telergicaUy written, after attemjDts to get it written by\r\ntelepathic communication had failed. Yet even on this occasion\r\nwe have to note a fundamental divergence from the Piper type\r\nof possession. In the Piper trance, we are told, there is \u201c complete or all but complete withdrawal of the spirit \u201d, and an\r\nextraneous invading spirit takes its place. When the name\r\nDorr was written, on the other hand, there was not even an\r\napproach to trance : the automatist was awake and aware of\r\nit by the term control, and to reserve the term possession for possession by\r\nan extraneous spirit. He admits, however, that to discriminate one from the\r\nother may be a very difficult task, and that in forming a judgment we have\r\nto fall back on the content of the commrmications received\u2014that is to say, on inferences drawn from other than psychological considerations. (See\r\nH.P., vol. ii., p. 198 ; also p. 153 above.)\r\n174 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'' s Mediumship [pabtwhat was going on. If the Dorr incident was really a case of\u201c possession \u201d, it was a case of possession shared between theinvading spirit and the spirit of the medium. Instances of theshared possession of the organs of speech and of voice by twodistinct controls have occurred in the history of Mrs Piper\u2019smediumship, but the controls in such cases have alwayspurported to be invading spirits. A closer parallel is providedby the experience of Mrs Willett recorded on pp. 112-113 above,when Mind No. 1 seemed to control the body while Mind No. 2looked on and wondered ; but there was no question there ofeither \u201c mind \u201d being other than a dissociated element of thesensitive\u2019s own personality.\r\nThe Myers of the Willett scripts and the Myers of HumanPersonality agree, as we have seen, in the descriptions whichthey give of the nature of the Piper trance -phenomena. Butas soon as we pass from mere description to consider the comparative significance to be attached to the two methods ofcommunication\u2014the telergic and the telepathic\u2014the agreement ceases. To the Myers of Human Personality \u201c possession \u201dI\u2019epresented the culminating point of perfection in the methodsof communication with the spirit world. ^ He also reached theparadoxical conclusion that tele2Dathy, carried to its highest1 Cf. H.P., vol. ii., j3p. 189-90. \u201c On the whole, I did not then [he. in 1888]\r\nanticipate that the theory of possession could be presented as more than aplausible .speculation, or as a supplement to other lines of proof of man\u2019ssurvival of death. The position of things, as the reader of the S.P.R. Proceedings knows, has in the last decade undergone a complete change. Thetrance j^henomena of Mrs Piper\u2014so long and so carefully watched by DrHodgson and others\u2014formed, I think, by far the most remarkable mass of psychical evidence till then adduced in any quarter. And more recentlyother series of trance phenomena with other \u2018 mediums \u2019 \u2014though still incomplete\u2014have added materially to the evidence obtained tlrrough MrsPiper. The result broadly is that these phenomena of possession are nowthe most amply attested, as well as intrinsically the most advanced, in ourwhole repertory. \u201c Nor again is the mere increment of direct evidence, important though thatis, the sole factor m the changed situation. Not only has direct evidencegrown, but indirect evidence, so to say, has moved to meet it. The notionof personality\u2014of the control of organism by spirit\u2014has gradually been so modified that possession, which passed till the other day as a mere survival\r\nof savage thought, is now seen to be the consummation, the furthest development, of many lines of exi^eriment, observation, reflection, which the precedingchapters have opened to our view,\u201d\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'' s Mediumship 175\r\ndegree, passes into possession. \u201c In the incursion of the\r\npossessing spirit \u201d, he writes, \u201c we have telepathic invasion\r\nachieving its completest victory In other words telepathy\r\nfrom an extraneous spirit achieves its completest victory when\r\nit ceases to be telepathy and becomes telergy.\r\nIt is from a similar standpoint that, in his \u201c Scheme of Vital\r\nFaculty \u201d f he places \u201c possession \u201d higher in the scale than\r\n\u201c ideation inspired by spirits Mrs Willett is an example of\r\nthe latter, Mrs Piper of the former.\r\nThe Willett scripts, on the contrary, seem to assign a higher\r\nplace to telepathy than to possession. See especially the lone\r\nscript of June 10, 1909, quoted in the above collection of\r\nextracts : The response to some extent\u2014how large an extent I do not\r\nyet exactly know\u2014the response conditions the power of\r\ntransmission. All telergic phenomena is clumsy and creaking\r\nin comparison with telepathic medium. It is to telepathy that\r\nI look for the nearest approach to perfect intercommunication\r\nbetween Met Etherial and terrene Strata and I sum up one aspect\r\nin those words Thought leaps out to wed with thought.\r\nIf the Myers of Humayi Personality and the Myers of the\r\nscripts are one and the same, this statement reads like a retractation of the opinion expressed in his book.\r\nIs it possible to effect a rapprochement between the two\r\ntypes of phenomena ? What seems to be required for this\r\npurpose is some kind of \u201c telepathic possession \u201d. Suggestions\r\nof this are to be found in Human Personality, and something more than suggestions in the Willett scripts. When\r\nMyers tells us that \u201c in the incursion of the possessing spirit we\r\nhave telepathic invasion achieving its completest victory \u201d, his\r\nidea seems to be that the telepathic invader actively displaces\r\nthe spirit of the sensitive, and only when that displacement is complete, or all but complete, does true possession\r\n\r\ni.e. telergic\r\npossession\u2014ensue. \u201cIf \u201d, he writes, \u201c we analyse our observations of possession, we find two main factors\u2014the central\r\noperation, which is the control by a spirit of the sensitive\u2019s\r\norganism ; and the indispensable pre-requisite, which is the\r\npartial and temporary desertion of that organism by the\r\n^ H.P., vol. ii., pp. 203-4.

It is still a relationbetweeji two minds, even if the telepathic interaction betweenthem is such that they almost seem to fuse together and mergeinto one. Even in so extreme a case the spirit of the sensitivehas not been eliminated, and may continue to be that elementin the blended whole which acts iipon the physical organism.'I\"his does not amount to saying that there is no such thing astclergic control by an invading spirit. On that point I amexpressing no opinion. But what passes for true possessionmay sometimes\u2014perhaps always\u2014be what I have called tele-])athic possession ; and, in any case, it can hardly be correctto regard telergic control as the final term in a telepathic series.We have next to consider certain passages in Willett scriptwhich bear upon the same subject. One of these in particular,from a trance -sitting of February 7, 1915, will, I think, be foundof such real interest as to be worth reproducing at some length.On the night of September 29-30, 1914, Mi\u2019s Willett had avery vivid cheam which she had a strong impulse to record,though it had no special meaning for her. The opening incidentsof the dream were recalled later on in the trance-sitting justreferred to. 1 give them liere in her own words.\r\nIn my dream I found myself standing on the crest of amountain (alp) with a high wall of snow before me whichprevented me from seeing the view which I somehow knew wasspread out beyond.

Then he\r\nput his foot in the wall of snow & beat down a place about\r\nhalf way up it into which I could place my feet. When it was\r\nfirm (from the down-trodden snow which he had stamped into a sort of flat pigeon-hole) I put one foot up & dug my nails\r\ninto the snow trying to heave myself up, but I could not. Then\r\nhe lifted me in his arms & somehow hfted me right over the\r\ntop of the wall of snow & held me over the edge. . . . The dream-record continues with much detail of description\r\nthat does not concern us here. More than four months passed\r\nwithout any reference to the dream in the scripts. But on\r\nFebruary 7, 1915, in a D.I. with myself as recorder, the communicator\u2014evidently the Dark Young Man, although he is not mentioned by that name\u2014returned to the subject as follows :\r\nD.I. of February 7, 1915. {Present, G.

No notice was taken : presently the\r\nautomatist opened her eyes, and the waking stage began. After\r\nit had proceeded for a short while, Mrs Wfillett noted the\r\ndeparture of the communicator, and a curious episode ensued :\r\nI\u2019ve seen this room before, but I can\u2019t remember where it is. {Points to a water-colour picture representing the Firth of Forth,\r\nand the coast of East Lothiayi, seen from, some pomt in Fife.)

That\u2019s where I used to stand\u2014just about thered\r\n(Points withfinger to the spot.)\r\nI leave tliis striking D.I. to speak for itself, only adding, with\r\nregard to the passage quoted from the waking stage, that\r\nwhereas the words \u201c I\u2019ve seen this room before, but I can\u2019t\r\nremember where it is \u201d seem to be uttered by the automatist on\r\nher own account, what follows is probably to be understood as spoken by the Dark Young Man. He may have returned after\r\nit was stated that he had gone away, and the automatist maybe merely repeating, as so often happens in D.I., the ipsissima\r\nverba of an orchnary telepathic communication. Nevertheless,\r\nthe incident is so peculiar that I am inclined to see in it something more than this. The personality of the automatist\r\nappears to merge so completely into that of the communicator\r\nas to lead one to suspect the latter of a desire to give a practical\r\nillustration of that reciprocal interweaving of two minds which\r\nhe had described earlier in the D.I., and which, without being\r\n\u201c possession \u201d in the full sense of the term, may yet reproduce\r\nsome of the characteristics of \u201c possession \u201d. I regard it, in\r\nfact, as an illustration of what I call telepathic possession.\r\nExamples of telepathic communication approaching, or passing into, telepathic possession are not very common in Mrs\r\nWillett\u2019s experiences. I am tempted, however, to count as such\r\nthe two instances of a transferred idea of pain described in\r\nChapter III. of Part I. (pp. 103-4 above). There also, if myinterpretation is right, the communicator is the Dark YoungMan. In the case of the second of the two incidents there\r\nseemed to be a brief recurrence, in the waking stage, of the pain\r\nin the head which had been felt in the trance itself ; and this\r\nwas followed by words implying that the automatist was\r\npuzzled about her own identity.\r\nOh, I feel so giddy. I\u2019m tumbling down. (Bests her head on\r\nthe table.) I can\u2019t remember who I am. I know I\u2019m somebody ; and I\u2019m coming together, you know, and the bits don\u2019t fit.

I can only\r\ndescribe it by saying I felt myself so blendmg with him as almost to seem to be becommg him.\u2019^\r\nIn addition to the above I may refer to another note by Mrs\r\nWillett (already cited on pp. 106-107 above), in which she\r\ndescribes her experiences on being left alone to try for script in a room at . The room seemed full of unseen presences and of their\r\nblessing ; it was as if barriers were swept away and I and they\r\nbecame one. I had no sense of personality in the imseen\r\nelement\u2014it was just there and utterly satisfying.\r\nFurther illustrations of the way in which at times the sensitive seems partially to identify herself with the communicator\r\nwill be found in Part I., Chapter III, section (c). But perhaps\r\nthe most striking example is provided by the waking stage of a\r\ntrance-script written in the presence of Sir Ohver Lodge, April\r\n19, 1918. The script had ended with the signature F., and the\r\nrecord continues :\r\n{The instant \u201c F \u201d had been written 3Irs W. raised her head\r\nand dropped the pencil.

Helene,\r\nindeed, has sometimes the impression of becoming Leopold for a moment.\r\nProfessor Flournoy compares this sensation with the experience of IVIr Hill Tout {Proceedings, S.P.R., vol. xi., p. 309), who feels hhnself becoming Ids own father, who is manifestmg through lum.\u201d\r\nMyers Idmself does not dispute the jii'obability that these are cases of incipient possession by secondary personalities. As the reader is aware,\r\nI draw no distinction\u2014nor indeed did Myers (see H.P., vol. ii., p. 197)\u2014so\r\nfar as process is concerned, between possession by a dissociated self and\r\npossession by an extraneous spirit. And the same would, of course, hold\r\ngood of telepathic possession, of wldch I coimt the experiences both of Helene\r\nand of Mr Tout to be examples.\r\n182 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willettis Mediumship [part\r\nsloivly, and after a long pause, entered the wakmg stage) : Oh !

I know I\u2019m real through her\r\nrecognition of my reahty.^ . . .\r\nThe German word beginning with Welt is evidently Weltgeist,\r\nand the general substance of the extract is strongly reminiscent\r\nof a well-known passage from the Preface to Hegel\u2019s Phdnomenologie des Geistes. Speaking of the various forms in which\r\nindividuals have been organised into communities, Hegel says : \u201c The world spirit had the patience to traverse these forms, and\r\nto undertake the tremendous labour of world-history . . . and\r\nhe did so because by no less a labour could he attain to a\r\nconsciousness of his own nature \u201d. The passage has often been\r\nquoted or at least phrases from it : the version here given is taken from Seth\u2019s Hegelianism and Perso7iality. The script does\r\nnot reproduce it with verbal exactness ; but the underlying idea\r\nis clearly the same, and it is difficult to believe that the passage\r\nitself was unknown to whatever intelligence was responsible for\r\nthe communication.\r\n2\r\n^ According to the view here expressed, the Weltgeist, or Absolute Sjairit, attains to self-realisation only in relation to the multiplicity of finite spirits. \u201c Turn this round \u201d, says the communicator, i.e. look at the question from\r\nthe point of view of the finite spirit. May it not be that the attainment\r\nof self-consciousness by a finite spirit A requires not only A\u2019s consciousness\r\nof B\u2019s reality, but also B\u2019s recognition of A\u2019s reality, and similarly with B ?\r\n^ The last sentence in Chapter IX of Human Personality may also be compared : \u201c Our struggle is the stmggle of the Universe itself ; and the very\r\nGodhead finds fulfilment through our upward -striving souls.\u201d\r\n184 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett' s Medimnship [part 140]\r\nThe extract has obvious points of affinity with the D.I. ofFebruary 7, 1915. It is not difficult to understand that reciprocity may be a condition of all successful communication, andan essential factor in any approach to telepathic possession.\r\nBut taken by itself it hardly seems sufficient to account for\r\nthe special characteristics suggestive of possession, even of thetelepathic order\u2014characteristics which must certainly include\r\nsome kind of ascendancy or domination of the possessing mindover the possessed. Something beyond reciprocity seems to beinvolved ; but what that something is, and what are the conditions favourable to its coming into play, are questions to whichI do not think any clear answer has been furnished by thescripts.\r\nI hazard the conjecture that normal mentality in the individual may involve an element of telepathic possession by theprimary self of the other psychical units in the group that enterinto the constitution of the personality as a whole.\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTELEPATHY, TELA^STHESIA, EXCURSUS\r\nI PREFACE this chapter and the two that follow it with an\r\nadmission of the difficulties I have found at times in trying to\r\ngive clear and coherent expression to the statements of the\r\ncommunicators concerning the siibject-matter with which they\r\ndeal. I have done my best to throw light on obscurities, to\r\nfill up gaps in exposition and to reconcile or explain aj^parent, or perhaps real, inconsistencies ; but I must crave the indulgence of the reader if I occasionally content myself with putting\r\ntogether the relevant passages, leaving him to draw his own\r\nconclusions.\r\nTelepathy, we are repeatedly told, is an interaction between\r\nmind and mind. It is fully recognised that it may, and does,\r\ntake place between one incarnate mind and another incarnate\r\nmind ; ^ but the telepathy with which the scripts deal has\r\nspecial reference to interaction between the incarnate mind of\r\nthe sensitive and what purport to be discarnate minds belonging\r\nto the world of spirits. The process is sometimes described as a\r\n\u201c blending \u201d of the minds concerned\u2014a neutral term which\r\ndoes not of itself raise any questions regarding the nature or importance of the respective contribixtion which each makes to\r\nthe total result.\r\nIt is with questions of this kind that the present chapter will\r\nbe mainly occupied. Granted the probability of some degree of\r\nreciprocity in the transaction, is it yet correct to speak of the\r\nrelation as if it were always one of active communicator to\r\ncomparatively passive recipient, or may it also happen that\r\nthe activity is rather on the side of the perceiving mind, which\r\nreads, as it were, and appropriates the content of the other\r\nmind with little, if any, co-operation on the part of the latter ?\r\n^ See p. 162 above. Interaction between supraliminal and subliminal in the same individual is also fully accepted as fact, although (wrongly, I think)\r\nit is not allowed by the communicators to count as telepathic.\r\nN 1S.5\r\nISO Psychological Aspects oj Mrs Willett\u2019s MedninisJiip [partThe distinction here drawn is not merely the familiar oneIjetween agent and percipient. It is also, as we shall see, adistinction between two kinds of activity\u2014the activity whichimpresses thought upon another mind, and the activity whichmakes the content of another mind its own. Both processesare in ordinary parlance included in the term telepathy. Bothappear, from explanations furnished by the communicators, toI)e used at one stage or another of the more complicatedmethods of communication Avhich we shall have to consider ina later chapter. I see no difficulty in supposing that bothactivities may be, perhaps iji some degree always are, concurrently operative without either of them losing its distinctivecharacter. Be that as it may, in the Willett scripts they areshar])ly contrasted, and in the important joassage I am about toquote the distinction is stressed to the point of confining theterm telepathy to the communicating actiAuty alone.\r\nIf the reader Avill refer back to the long extract given on pp.95-lK) above, he Avill note that the communicator (in thisinstance Gurney) is there deliberately trying to illustrate thenature of telepathy by impressing on the automatist a mentalimage of Avhat he remembered himself to be like when in thebody. What he Avishes to shoAV by this example is that telepathy implies vohmtary action on the part of a communicatingagent. The subjoined extract, taken from a little later on inthe same sitting, carries the subject on someAvhat further.\r\nFrom the D.I. of September 24, 1910. (0. J. L. recording.)\r\n. . .

Wait a bit, let Lodge think, and then let him speak and you rest. (To Lodge) Now you speak.\r\n[0. J. L.] I gather that you have been trying to explain, or rather illustrate the process of telepathy to me.\r\n[E. Q.] Yes.\r\n[0. J. L.] And that you got William James through, and\r\nthen a word that perhaps she does not know, Hyslop. Does\r\nshe know it ?\r\n[E. G.] Oh yes, she\u2019s read it, but she doesn\u2019t know why I say\r\nit, nor do you, in that juxtaposition. Let me know when the\r\nmeaning that is there is seen by you. There may be a little time to pass first, but when the meaning is plain, say so.\r\n[0. J. L.] About telepathy, you mean it has to be purposed,\r\nthat the thought cannot be picked up from stray people, that\r\nit has to be injected ?\r\n[E. G.] What you say about telepathy isn\u2019t altogether right.\r\nIt\u2019s not one thing and one process, but there are degrees of it, and it depends on the instrument partly and upon the familiarity of the agent. There must be practice on both sides.\r\nHere\u2019s what appears to be a complete contradiction of what\r\nI\u2019ve said, and yet both are facts. Through my carelessness she\r\nwill sometimes see telepathically ^ what I hadn\u2019t intended her\r\nto know. There are three more - things that I can speak of. [Understood by 0. J. L. to mean three processes of telepathy.)\r\nThere\u2019s the direct\u2014directing\u2014conscious\u2014intended\u2014what\u2019s\r\nthe word ?\r\n[0. J. L.) Impact ?\r\n[E. G.) No, no, that\u2019s the other end\u2014propulsion.\r\nmore particularly, to the effort involved in summoning iqo, and impressing on the sensitive, the memory-image of himself when in the body. Cf.

But possibly the phrase\r\n\u201c see telepathically \u201d is loosely used where \u201c receive as a telejjathically\r\ntransmitted message \u201d would have more accurately represented what the\r\ncommunicator wished to convey.\r\n^ The word \u201c more \u201d here seems to be a mistake.

If I am what you would call very \u201c close \u201d toher, I could shut oft' certain impressions and then I can switchthem on.\r\n[0. J. L.] Is it like removing a screen I [E. O.] Ah (he says), screen. Do you remember about ascreen long ago ? ^ [Did not wait for an answer but contmued]A third thing may happen ; \u2014when the shutter is down theremay be a leak, without deliberate switching,\u2014a\r\ngeneral asagainst a specialised impact may take place.

G.] In my record there\u2019s a case in point, that Mrs Verrallhas, of a leak which called out corresponding thought in themind which was the very last I would have desired to stimulate . . .\r\nThe three kinds of telej^athic communication here enumeratedhave this iu common, that they imply voluntary action on thepart of the communicator. Where they differ is in the mannerand degree in which voluntary action plays a part in the result.The first kind, metaphorically comparable to the deliberateaiming of a jn\u2019ojectile at a particular object, may be taken asthe most direct and typical form. The second and third kindsare not very clearly defined, and it is possible that errors have^ See Proceedings, vol. ii., p. 201 ff., for an accomrt of experiments byE. G. where the \u201c subject \u201d was placed behurd a screen.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's 31ecliumship 189\r\ncrept into the record of what the speaker is represented as\r\nsaying. He compares the process to the letting down {i.e. the\r\nopening) of a shutter, whereby his thoughts are able telepathically to affect another mind. When the shutter is let down one\r\nof two things may happen :\r\n(a) When the communicator is very \u201c close \u201d to the sensitive\r\nhe can \u201c shut off certain impressions and then switch them on \u201d.\r\nI understand the suggestion to be that the effect of the shutting\r\noff and switching on is to break the continiiity of the message,\r\nand so give rise to \u201c the theory of unconscious mentality in the\r\ndiscarnate\u2014the coma business, ch\u2019eam business \u201d. But I do\r\nnot feel confident that this explanation is the true one. Or, {b) \u201c there may be a leak without deliberate switching\u2014\r\na\r\ngeneral as against a specialised impact may take place \u201d.\r\nThe difference between the two cases I take to be this. In\r\nboth the mind of the communicator is consciously active, biit\r\nin {a) a particular impression is dehberately \u201c switched on\r\n\u201d and specially directed to the percipient ; whereas in (6) it reaches her independently of the commimicator\u2019s will, and even,\r\nit may be, contrary to his intention.\r\nIt is to this third kind that Gurney had already alluded when\r\nhe says, \u201c Through my carelessness she will sometimes see telepathically what I hadn\u2019t intended her to know \u201d. He\r\nadmits that such a case may appear to be \u201c a complete contracbction \u201d of his previous statement that \u201c telepathy isn\u2019t\r\ninvoluntary \u201d, but he in no way withdraws or qualifies the\r\nstatement. It is evident, however, that there may be great\r\ndifficulty in deciding whether such a case is primarily one of\r\nthought-communication or thought-perception.\r\nIf a definition of telepathy which excludes thought-perception\r\nas opposed to thought-communication is to be accepted as representing the considered doctrine of the Willett scripts, what\r\nterm, if any, is employed in them to describe the spirit activity\r\nof the perceiving mind ? The answer to this question is not so simple as might be supposed. The expression mind-reading\r\ndoes not, I think, occur in the scripts. The nearest equivalent\r\nappears to be telcesthesia, employed in a sense strangely different\r\nfrom that which it bears in Human Personality.\r\nThe relation between telepathy and telsesthesia as it was\r\nunderstood by Myers on the one hand, and as it seems to be\r\n190 Psychologiml Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019 s Mediumship [partconceived in the Willett scripts on the other hand, furnishespoints of much interest.\r\nIn the Glossary prefixed to Human Personality Myers hasprovided us with what is evidently a carefully thought-outdefinition of the two terms, comparing them in respect both ofresemblance and of difference. I quote it here in extenso.\r\nTelepathy and Telcesthesia.\u2014It has become possible, I think,to discriminate between these two words somewhat moresharply than when I first suggested them in 1882. Telepathymay still be defined as \u201c the communication of impressions ofany kind from one mind to another independently of therecognised channels of sense \u201d. The distaiice between agent andpercipient which the derivation of tlie word\u2014\u201c feeling at adistance \u201d\u2014 implies, need, in fact, only be such as to preventthe operation of whatever known modes of perception are notexcluded by the other conditions of the case. Telepathy maythus exist between two men in the same room as truly asbetween one man in England and another in Australia, orl)etween one man still living on earth and another man longsince departed. Telcesthesia\u2014perception at a distance\u2014mayconveniently be interpreted in a similar way, as implying anydirect sensation or perception of objects or conditions indepemlently of the recogmsed channels of sense, and also undersuch circumstances that no known mind external to thepercipient\u2019s can be suggested as the source of the knowledgethus gained.\r\nThe above may be usefully supplemented by fiu\u2019ther remarkswhich I quote from the Glossary under the heading of Clairvoyance. Clairvoyance Myers defines as \u201c the faculty or act ofperceiving, as though visually, with some coincidental truth,some distant scene \u201d ; and he goes on to say :\r\n\u201c I have preferred to use the term telcesthesia for distantpei'ception. For the faculty has seldom any close analogy withan extension of sight ; the perception of distant scenes beingoften more or less symbolical and in other ways out of accordmth what actual sight would show in the locality of the vision.\r\nOn the other hand, telcesthesia merges into telepathy, sincewe caimot say how far the perception of a distant scene may\r\n140] PsycJiologiad Aspects of Mrs WiUettA Mecliumship 191\r\nin essential be the perception of the content of a distant\r\nmirul \u201dd\r\nThe characteristic marks of telsesthesia in Myers\u2019s sense of\r\nthe term (apart from the quality of supernormality which it has in common with telepathy) may be re-stated thus :\r\n(1) The knowledge acquired by it is a knowledge of \u201c objects\r\nand conditions \u201d, whereas telepathy extends to \u201c the transference of impressions of any kind from one mind to another \u201d ;\r\n(2) The knowledge must come to the percipient independently of telepathy from any other mind that can be suggested\r\nas its source. Clairvoyance that can plausil)ly be referred\r\nto thought transference is not telaesthesia in the Myersian\r\nsense. The first of these characteristics I leave over for comment\r\nlater on. As regards the second, the condition laid down \u201c that\r\nno mind external to the percipient\u2019s can be suggested as the sonrce of the knowledge gained \u201d, may serve a useful purpose in\r\nassisting the provisional classification of individual cases, but\r\nis, I think, open to criticism from the scientific point of view.\r\nIt embodies no definite principle, but only a rule of convenience\r\nfounded on the ignorance of the investigator. He may b(^ unable to suggest any known mind as a source of the supernormally acquired knowledge. But his ignorance does not\r\ncontradict the possibility of there being a mind unknown to\r\nhim, yet capable of providing such a source, nor alter the fact if\r\nit be a fact. The statement quoted above from the Glossary to\r\nHuman Personality under the heading of Clairvoyance, that we\r\ncannot say how far the perception of a distant scene may in\r\nessential be the perception of the contents of a distant mind,\r\nlends additional force to this criticism. It would have been\r\nmore logical, in my view, to have provided a definition of\r\ntelfesthesia that would have identified it outright with independent clairvoyance, leaving open the question whether such a\r\nfaculty is really found in man, or whether every form of\r\nclairvoyance should not rather be explained as a variety <jf\r\ntelepathy. Of course, the effect would be to relegate to the\r\nhmbo of doubt cases that Myers would have classified as telsesthetic. There is also the possibility to be considered that l)otli\r\n^ For fm\u2019ther discussion of the whole subject see H.F., vol. i., pp. 275 seq.\r\n192 Psychological Aspects oj Mrs Willett's Alediumship [partprocesses might be in operation concurrently without being\u201c merged \u201d in the sense of l^ecoming indistinguishable.\r\nI pass to the consideration of the very dift'erent significance\r\nattached to the word telcesthesia in Willett script.\r\nIt is clear from what precedes that, in comparing telepathywith telaesthesia, Myers takes little or no note of the distinctionbetween the activity of thoiight-communication and theactivity of thought-perception. Telepathy for him includesboth. In the Willett scripts, on the other hand, this distinction\r\nassumes capital importance. Telepathy is defined so as toexclude mind-reading ; and telaesthesia is treated as incluchngmind-reading, if not actually identified with it.\r\nI believe the distinction to be an important one, and aminclined to think that it has been unduly neglected in HumanPersonality. But this novel use of familiar terms is aj)t to leadto confusion, and in the ensuing discussion, in order to conduceto clearness and at the same time to avoid clumsy periphrases,\r\nI propose to use the syndjol \u201c telaesthesia (M) \u201d and \u201c telepathy(M) \u201d in contradistinction to \u201c telaesthesia (W) \u201d and \u201c telepathy (W) \u201d to denote the different meanings which the wordsbear in Human Personality and in the Willett scripts respectively. I further projiose to retain the word clairvoycmce as aterm of general significance (not, of course, confined to the senseof vision), and to employ it, contrary to modern usage, to coverboth the \u201c independent clairvoyance \u201d which corresponds mostnearly to Myers\u2019s definition of telaesthesia, and the \u201c telepathic\r\nclairvoyance \u201d which that definition if carried to its logical\r\nconclusion would exclude.\r\nIn order to make intelligible what follows I must begin byexplaining the meaning of a term which, so far as I know, is peculiar to Mrs Willett, namely Mutual Selection. \u201c Mutualselection \u201d is described as part of a process preliminary to theproduction of certain kinds of scripts. Success in the productionof these scripts requires (we are told) on the part of the sensitive \u201c a capacity for Excursus allied to a capacity for definite\r\nselection \u201d ; and by \u201c excursus \u201d is meant the passing, as it were, outside herself and entering into communion with thespiritual world. The communicator and the sensitive arerepresented as \u201c mutually selecting \u201d from each other\u2019s minds\r\n\r\nI40j Psychological Aspecis of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship 193\r\nthe communicator from the contents of \u201c the conscious and\r\nimconscious self\u201d of the sensitive, the sensitive from \u201csuch\r\npart of the mind of the communicating spirit as she can have\r\naccess to The part of the communicator\u2019s mind to which\r\nshe can have access is limited (we are told) to that which can\r\nnaturally link on to human incarnate thought, but, subject to\r\nthat limitation, includes the \u201c potential \u201d as well as the\r\n\u201c actual \u201d content of his mind.^\r\nAs the result of this mutual selection there now lies in the\r\n\u201c whole self \u201d of the automatist the original matter from which\r\nthe communicator\u2019s selection is made plus the matter she has\r\nacquired by selection from him. The material so provided may\r\nremain unused and dormant in the mind of the automatist\r\nuntil the moment comes for it to emerge under the guiding\r\ninfluence of telepathy from the communicator.\r\nThe foregoing explanation will, I hope, assist the reader to\r\nfollow the line of thought contained in the extract from the\r\nD.I. of October 8, 1911, to which I have next to call attention.^\r\nD.I. of October 8, 1911.

For the\r\npresent I am concerned mainly with its bearing upon the sense\r\nin which the term telcesthesia is used in Willett scripts.\r\nThe statements that telmstliesia is \u201ca power of acquiring\r\nknowledge dii\u2019ect without the intervention of discarnate mind \u201d,\r\nand that the knowledge so gained has to do with \u201c objects \u201d,\r\nnot with \u201c thoughts \u201d, may seem, at first sight, to suggest the\r\ncharacteristic features of telaesthesia as defined in Human\r\nPersonalityd But a brief consideration shows that tins would\r\nbe an entirely wrong conclusion. The whole tenor of the extract and the intimate connection which it establishes between\r\ntelaesthesia and mutual selection prove decisively that what the\r\ncommunicator is thinking of is not a relation between a mind\r\nand \u201c things \u201d, but betw^een one mind and another. When he\r\nspeaks of knowledge acquired direct \u201c without the intervention\r\nof discarnate mind \u201d, I cannot doubt that he means \u201c without\r\nthe active intervention of discarnate mind \u201d. The language\r\nemployed might with advantage have been more ]\r\n3recise, but\r\nany other interpretation would make utter havoc of the entire\r\npassage. The phrase \u201c without the intervention of discarnate\r\nmind \u201d is misleading in another respect also. \u201c Without the\r\nactive intervention of a mind external to the percijiient\u2019s,\r\nwhether incarnate or discarnate \u201d, would, I think, have more\r\nacciuately represented the commiuucator\u2019s conception of\r\ntelaesthesia in general, although what he has immediately in\r\nview is the relation of the sensitive with disembodied spii\u2019its.\r\n1 kSee H.P., vol. i., p. 136, where the phrase \u201cwithout another mind\u2019s\r\nintervention \u2019\u2019 is used.\r\n196 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s 31edinmship [part\r\nTelaesthesia (M) and telaesthesia (W) have this in common,\r\nthat both are activities of a perceiving mind. Indeed the\r\ndefinition given by Myers, if carried to its logical conclusion,\r\nwould eliminate the idea of an agent altogether, and for agent\r\nand percipient would substitute percipient and object perceived.\r\nThis would not be equally true of telsesthesia (W), but activity\r\non the part of the percipient still remains its most essential\r\ncharacteristic. \u201c I take her into a room [says Gurney],\r\n\u201c and I screen off any action of my own mind on hers : her\r\nsubliminal with its useful cojiious pinch of the salt of Eve\u2019s\r\ncuriosity takes stock of the contents of the room. Normal\r\nconsciousness is later regained, and lying in the subliminal is knowledge of certain objects perceived, not as the result of the\r\naction of any mind, but as the result of telaesthetic faculty.\u201d\r\nWe start, then, from this, that both teleesthesia (M) and\r\nteleesthesia (W) are essentially activities of perception. The\r\ndifference between them becomes apparent when we ask the\r\nquestion. What do these activities enable vis to perceive ? or, to put the same thing in another form. What is at once the\r\nsource and the subject-matter of the knowledge acquired by\r\ntheir exercise 1 Consider first the case of telaesthesia (M). It is defined as \u201c a direct sensation or percejvtion of objects or conditions \u201d\r\nindependently of the recognised channels of sense, and independently also of \u201c any known mind that can be suggested as the source of the knowledge gained \u201d. Perception of objects or\r\nconditio7is is a somewhat vague phrase, but I take it to meanmuch the same as the more precise expression employed by\r\nMrs Sidgwick in her paper on \u201c The Evidence for Clairvoyance \u201d\r\nin vol. vii. of Proceedings\u2014\u201d Knowledge of facts such as we\r\nnormally acquire by the use of our senses \u201d. More explicitly\r\nstill, telaesthesia (M) may be described as immediate knowledge,\r\nsupernormally acquired, of facts relating to the world of\r\nphysical reality.\r\nTelaesthesia (W), on the other hand, even if it were possible\r\nto find a formula for it which would include immediate knowledge of this kind, is represented as having a different field of\r\n\u2019 By the words \u201c I take her into a room \u201d Gurney means \u201c T pre.sent material\r\nto her to select from whicli is aj>propriate to a theme or topic chosen by me \u201d. See below, pp. 240 li.\r\n140] Psychological Asjiecls of Mrs Willett's Mecliumship 197\r\noperation, namely the content of another ?nind. This claim\r\nit is that constitutes the true centre of interest and novelty in\r\nthe position taken up in the Willett scripts, and that we must\r\ntry, if possible, to understand.\r\nIn so far as telaesthesia (W) is the perception of the contents\r\nof another mind, it clearly cannot be\u2014hke teleesthesia (M)\r\ndirect perception of facts relating to external reality. It may,\r\nhowever, be indirect perception of such facts, or what is known\r\nas telepathic clairvoyance. Such cases are rare in the records of\r\nMrs Willett\u2019s experiences ; but there is at least one example\r\nwhich may properly come under this heading. She had on\r\nvarious occasions spoken to me of an oft-recurring dream in\r\nwhich she seemed to herself to visit a certain house, and to take\r\ndelight in wandering through its rooms and passages. She\r\ncalled it her dream house, but always identified it in her mind\r\nwith a real house, of the existence of which she was aware,\r\nthough she had never been there. When, at a later time, she\r\nactually visited the real house, and was able to compare the\r\ndetails she was familiar with in her dream, with what she now\r\nsaw with her eyes, it was found that in many respects the dream\r\nhouse corresponded much more closely with the internal arrangements of the house as it was fifty or sixty years ago than with\r\ncontemporary fact. When asked to explain this she replied\r\nthat she could not exactly say, but that she connected her dream\r\nhouse in some way with children who had lived in it. Her own\r\nimpression was that her experience was in some sense dependent\r\non the recollections of other minds. If not due to telepathic\r\nimpact from those minds, which would bring it under the\r\nhead of telepathy (W), this would be a case of telaesthesia (W).\r\nProbably Myers himself would have classed it as a case of\r\ntelaesthesia (M).\r\nClairvoyance of the kind illustrated by Mi-s Willett\u2019s dream\r\nhouse experience is what would be most reathly suggested by\r\nthe general description given of telaesthesia (Wj in the D.I. of\r\nOctober 8, 1911\u2014\u201cKnowledge, not thought, acquired by the\r\nsubliminal when operating normally in the metetherial \u2019\u2019. It\r\nwould, moreover, be knowledge open to verification by comparison with what the senses can tell us, in the same way as knowledge gained by independent clairvoyance, dift'ering from\r\nthe latter only in respect of its having been indirectly acquired\r\n198 Psychological Aspects of M7's Willett's Mediimship [paktthrough the mediation of other minds, instead of by directsupernormal perception.\r\nBut in order to understand what the scripts are reallydi'iving at we have to consider not merely general descriptions,but the actual examples of tlie process which are provided forour enlightenment. When we do this it becomes clear thattelaesthesia (W) goes far beyond the scope even of telepathicclairvoyance itself. Let us now go back to the passage in the D.I. of October 8,\r\n1911 (p. 194 above), beginning with the words \u201c Say I wroteof horses \u201d. I paraphrase it according to my notion of its purport, though, of course, my interpretation is to be taken forwhat it is worth. The communicator is evidently referring tothe production of cross -correspondences between two or moreautomatists. He sripposes himself to have taken as the centraltheme of a cross-corresjrondence the subject of horses. Bytelepathic impact he gets in a Verrall script allusions, say, toPegasus and to chariot races. (Note that both these topics arespoken of as ideas.) He \u201c trumps \u201d them, so to speak, in\r\nWillett script with two \u201c cards \u201d, or \u201c objects \u201d, alreadytelsestlietically acquired l)y her by selection from the content ofhis own mind\r\n\r\nhorse-shoe, let us say, or the Steeds of Dawn : in\r\nother words he in his turn selects these from the content of thesensitive\u2019s mind to which they now belong, anrl by active\r\ntelepatliic influence causes them to emerge in their appropriatecontext.\r\nWhatever the ground or justification may be for treating thetelepathically impressed Pegasus as an idea, and the telsesthetically acquired Steeds of Daivn as an \u201c object \u201d, it is evidentthat both one and the other might be housed in the same\u201c mythical room \u201d, and that neither has any title to be re- garded as pertaining to the world of external reality.^ It is clear also that any \u201c evidential \u201d value they may possess in a\r\nresulting script must be tested, if it can be tested at all, bymethods quite other than an appeal to the evidence of the\r\nsenses. We have passed clean away from the province of telepathic clairvoyance.\r\n' On a later occasion tlie \u201c objects \u201d or \u201c elements \u201d which are exjDres.sly\r\nsingled out as having been \u201c mutually selected \u201d are ajjjjosite literary\r\nquotations.

The following are the passages on which we have mainly to rely, apart, of cour.se, from the two extracts already quoted.\r\nFrom the D.I. of June 4, 1911. {G. IT.

A distinction is made\r\nbetween the field for selection open to the discarnate communi - cator and that open to the sensitive. The commimicator is said\r\n^ I.e. \u201c as the subliminal \u201d is to be substituted for \u201c by terming it the\r\nsubliminal \u201d.\r\nO\r\n202 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partto have access to the \u201c whole self \u201d of the sensitive\u2014that is tosay, to her conscious and unconscious self ; and her consciousand unconscious self are identilied with her siipraliminal andsubliminal self. The sensitive, on the other hand, has access to that part onlyof the discarnate communicator\u2019s mind the content of whichcan link on to human incarnate thought. Between that partof his mind and the part to which she has no access the relationis, roughly speaking, similar to that between the supraliminaland the subliminal of the incarnate\u2014using the term subliminalhere to denote what is highest and best in the human mind.The suggestion seems to be that the subliminal of the discarnateuses categories which are beyond the reach of incarnate mind,much as the categories employed by the human mind areIjeyond the comprehension of the mind of animals. Thus whilethe field of selection open to the discarnate communicator is the\u201c whole self \u201d of the sensitive, the field open to the sensitive is confined to what may be described, with some approximation totruth, as the supraliminal of the discarnate.\r\nThere is no great chflficulty in following the thought up to thispoint, whatever vahie we may be disposed to attach to it. Buta further (hstinction is made between the actual and thepotential content of that part of the discarnate mind to whichthe sensitive has access. The words potential and actual,applied to the content of a mind, must mean potential or actualin relation to that mind, not in relation to another mind.\u201c Potential \u201d, therefore, cannot be interpreted to mean \u201c possible of apprehension by the sensitive \u201d. It must signifysomething which is now latent but in certain conditions canbecome actual in one and the same mind. What is this something ? In the D.I. of June 4, 1911, Gurney expresses the wish thathe \u201c could get that word potential rightly used \u201d. It is themore strange that his own statements on the subject should nothave been more explicit. The potential content, we are told,lies beyond the actual, and the sensitive has access to both inher selection from the mind of the discarnate. But for furtherinformation we have to be content for the most part withnegatives. Actual and potential thoughts are not the same asconscious and unconscious thoughts ; the distinction between\r\n140] Psychological As'pecfs of Mrs Willeifs Mediumship 203\r\nthe conscious and unconscious mind of the sensitive does not\r\ncorrespond to the distinction between the actual and potential\r\ncontent of the discarnate mind ; \u201c unconscious \u201d is not an\r\nequivalent for \u201cpotential\u201d. There is the further statement\r\nthat \u201c potential \u201d means \u201c possible to be apprehended of mind\r\nas it exists in the parts\u2014using the word \u2018 parts \u2019 in contradistinction to the word \u2018 whole \u2019 \u201d : but this, I must confess,\r\nappears to me to be a case of obscurum per obscurius. In the\r\nend the student of the scripts is thrown back upon his own\r\nresources for an interpretation of the term. Does it relate to\r\nsomething characteristic of the discarnate mind as such 1 or does it apply to incarnate mind as well ? We are not definitely\r\ntold that in mutual selection the mind of the sensitive to which\r\nthe communicator has access comprises a potential as well as an\r\nactual element. Assuming, however, as I think we reasonably\r\nmay, that the distinction between potential and actual content\r\nis to be understood as applying to nfinds in general, whether\r\nincarnate or discarnate, I suggest that by \u201c potential content \u201d\r\nis meant the store of past impressions which have become and\r\nremain latent unless called up into present consciousness and\r\nmade actual by an exercise of memory. It is something like the\r\n\u201c preconscious \u201d of Freud.\r\nThis is not the place to consider the problems presented by\r\nthe phenomena of memory, or to discuss on its merits the claim\r\nthat one mind may be able to approjiriate the latent memorycontent of another, not indeed as memories of its own, but as so many more or less detached ideas and images. All I am\r\nconcerned with at present is to interpret to the best of my ability\r\nthe statements made in the scripts respecting telsesthesia and\r\ntelepathy and their relations to each other.\r\nLet us return once more to the statement in the D.I. of\r\nOctober 8, 1911, that telepathy is communication of thought,\r\ntelaesthesia the acquisition of knowledge. The distinction\r\nbetween an activity of commumcation and an activity of\r\nacquisition is clear enough. The distinction between thought\r\nand knowledge is less easy to grasp. By \u201c thought \u201d in this\r\nconnection I understand every kind of idea, image, emotion,\r\netc., forming the conscious content of the mind of the communicator at the moment of commiufication. It is, in fact, that\r\n\u201c actual content \u201d of his mind, to which, we are told, as well as\r\n204 Psychological As])ecis of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [partto the potential content, the sensitive has telsesthetic access in\r\nmutual selection.\r\nWhat, then, is the nature of the \u201c knowledge \u201d wliich is to be| distinguished from \u201c thought \u201d ? My answer would be that the knowledge differs from the\r\nthought only in being knowledge actively acquired by one mindof the thought in another mind. What is \u201c thought \u201d from the\r\nstandpoint of the thinker becomes an object of knowledge fromthe standpoint of the percipient. The thought is what it is has an objectivity of its own\u2014irrespective of the questionwhether it is correctly apprehended.\r\nSimilarly with respect to potential content. Let us supposewe are right in assuming that by the potential content of a mindis meant its latent memories. Then, so far as telaesthesia is perception of the latent memories of another person, the know-|ledge thus acquired must be determined by the nature of the[memory-content of the mind from which the percipient mind'ch-aws its information. The latent memories of that mind (say,\r\nfor example, \u201c horse-shoe \u201d or \u201c the steeds of dawn \u201d) havebecome, when telsesthetically apprehended, so many \u201c objectsperceived \u201d\u2014mental objects, no doubt, but still \u201c objects \u201d\r\nindependent of the percipient, the real significance of whichremains the same even if it has been misapprehended or distorted in the process.\r\nIt is important to notice that no attempt is made in thescripts to bring independent clairvoyance within the scope of:telaesthesia (W). Indeed, it is possible to go further, and saythat the very existence of such a faculty is ignored by thecommunicators. They neither affirtn nor reject it, but simplyipass the subject over in silence. Considering the prominence.given to it in Human Personality, this strikes me as not a little\r\nremarkable. Whether it was an attitude deliberately adopted,or whether the omission was accidental, I am unable to say.No example of independent clairvoyance can, in my opinion,be found in the records of the Willett phenomena.\r\n^ j1 The experience of her dream house might probably have been reckonedby Myers as a case of telsesthesia (M) on the groimd tliat \u201c no known mindexternal to the percipient\u2019s can be suggested as tlie source of the Imowledgegained \u201d. But Mrs Willett herself, as we have seen, was inclined to attributeit to the recollections of persons who had lived there as children in days gone\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Medmmship 205\r\nIn any case, if there be such a thing as independent clairvoyance, so deep a chasm separates it from mind-reading that\r\nto apply the same class-name to both seems to me more likely\r\nto mislead than to enhghten.\r\nThe discussion of the subject in the present paper has been\r\ncomphcated, first by the ambiguity in Myers\u2019s definition of\r\ntelaesthesia to which I have aheady called attention, and\r\nsecondly by the absence of any pronouncement in the scripts\r\nfor or against telaesthetic apjirehension of external reality\r\nwithout the intervention of another mind. The result has been\r\nthat teleesthesia (M) has seemed to leave a loophole for the\r\nadmission of telepathic clairvoyance, and telaesthesia (W) to\r\nleave a loophole for the admission of independent clairvoyance.\r\nIf we make up our minds to get rid of these loopholes, and\r\nboldly identify telsesthesia (M) with independent clairvoyance,\r\nand telsesthesia (W) with mind-reading, I do not consider that\r\nwe shall have departed from the spirit of Human Personality\r\nin the one case, or from that of the scripts in the other, and I am\r\nsure we shall have made a useful contribution to the cause of\r\nclear thinking.\r\nAn ideahstic theory of the universe may resolve matter into\r\nthe content of some cosmic mind. There is a passage in Human\r\nPersonality in which Myers toys with this Berkeleian doctrine.^\r\nBut as long as we treat the distinction between matter and mind\r\nby, and to me, at least, tins explanation is far preferable to that of inde- pendent clairvoyance. There is an element of retro-cognition in the dream\r\nhouse experience ; and I find it hard to believe that retro-cognitive telsesthesia could ever be independent of the memories of some mind or other.\r\n1 \u201c It was needful [in connection with the meaning of so-called \u2018 travelling\r\nclairvoyance \u2019] to consider how far there was a continuous transition between\r\nthese excursions and director transferences between mind and mind,\r\n\r\nbetween telsesthesia and telepathy. It now seems to me that such a contmuous\r\ntransition may well exist, and that there is no absolute gulf between the\r\nsupernormal percejation of ideas as existmg in other minds, and the super- normal perception of what we know as matter. All matter may, for aught we\r\nknow, exist as an idea in some cosmic mind, with which mind each individual\r\nspirit may be in relation, as fully as with individual minds. The difference perhaps lies rather in the fact that there may be generally a summons from\r\na cognate mind which starts the so-called agent\u2019s mind into action ; his invasion may be in some way invited ; while a spiritual excursion among\r\ninanimate objects only may often lack an impulse to start it \u201d. {H.P.,\r\nvol. i., p. 278.)\r\n206 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship [partas fundamental\u2014and we can hardly do otherwise withoutdeserting the jjrovince of psychology for that of metaphysics\r\nso long shall we be under the necessity of treating the distinctionbetween telsesthesia (M) ( = independent clairvoyance) andteliesthesia (W) ( = thought-perception) as fundamental also.The idealistic hypothesis would not even provide, as Myersseems to think, a continuous transition between the two. Itseffect would rather he to do away with the conception of independent clairvoyance altogether, and leave teleesthesia (W)alone in possession of the field. Occasional hints are to be found in Human Personality of adisposition to extend teleesthesia (M) so as to include intuitionsof the spiritual world. Consider, for instance, the followingI^assages : A vague but genuine consciousness of the spiritual environment ; that (it seems) is the degree of revelation which artisticor philosophic genius is capable of conferring. Subliminaluprushes, in other words, so far as they are intellectual, tendto become telcesthetic. They bring with them indefinite intimations of what I hold to be the great truth that the human spiritis essentially capable of a deeper than sensorial perception, ofa direct knowledge of facts of the universe outside the range ofany specialised organ or any planetary view {H.P. , vol. i., p. 111).We are already familiar with \u201c travelling clairvoyance \u201d, aspirit\u2019s change of centre of perception among the scenes of thematerial world. May there not be an extension of travellingclairvoyance to the spiritual world ? a spontaneous transfer ofthe centi\u2019e of perception into that region from whence discarnatespirits seem now able, on their side, to communicate withgrowing freedom ? (H.P., vol. ii., p. 259.)\r\nGenius, as has been already said, is a kind of exalted butundeveloped clairvoyance. The subliminal uprush whichinspires the poet or the musician, presents to him a deep butvague perception of that world unseen, through which the seeror the sensitive projects a narrower but exacter gaze. {H.P.,vol. ii., p. 282.)\r\nSuch suggestions are really incompatible with Myers\u2019sdefinition of telsesthesia, and they seem to he rather halfheartedly advanced. Had they been definitely accepted and\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 207\r\nconsistently thought out, I think they would have led Myers to\r\nrevise his definition, perhaps on lines more in accord with the\r\nviews expressed in the Willett scripts.\r\nThe reader who has had the perseverance to accompany me\r\nthus far through the somewhat wearisome chsquisitions of the\r\npresent chapter may, I fear, in the end lose patience and begin\r\nto ask whether any useful purpose is served by lengthy discussion of points of difference possibly verbal rather than real.\r\nGranted, he may say, that the terms telepathy and telsesthesia are used in a sense other than that which they bear in Human\r\nPersonality, do the new meanings give a juster insight into\r\nthe facts, or merely rearrange and rename them ? Much is obviously lost by giving new meanings to terms of art already\r\nfamiliar. Has any compensating advantage been gained in the\r\npresent case ?\r\nI do not consider these doubts wholly unjustified. The\r\nlimitation of the word telepathy to the active transmission of\r\nthought by one mind to another, although it has hitherto been\r\ngenerally employed to include mind-reachng as well, is not an\r\ninnovation to be welcomed. A word is wanted to cover both\r\nactivities of mental interaction. Telepathy had hitherto served\r\nthis purpose well, and the terminology of the scripts provides no\r\nconvenient substitute. It would simely have been better to have\r\nretained telepathy as a generic term to include thought-commmiication and thought-perception as suborchnate species.\r\nThe new meaning given to teleesthesia has more to justify it, because in this case the effect is to extend the scope of the tei-m,\r\nnot to restrict it. Moreover, mind-reading, as an activity of\r\nperception, has an etymological claim to the title, and the\r\ncommunicators might fairly argue that this aspect of it would\r\nnot be sufficiently emphasised except by giving it a name which\r\nwould clearly indicate affinity with the other fortn of supernormal perception. If the scripts had employed telaesthesia as a generic term to include, as suborchnate species, (1) independent clairvoyance, or supernormal perception of physical\r\nobjects, and (2) mind-reading, or supernormal perception of\r\nmental objects, something could be urged in favour of such a\r\nclassification. But actually they have so treated the subject as to ignore independent clairvoyance, and to all intents and\r\n208 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship [pabtpurposes appropriate the word telsesthesia to describe whatMyers\u2019s definition was certainly meant to exclude. This hasnot tended to clearness, and it has greatly increased the\r\ndifficulties of exposition. I am not satisfied with the definition\r\nof telaesthesia in Human Personality. It does not unambiguously exclude telepathic clairvoyance, as, in my view, it logically\r\nshould do. But here again I think it woxdd have been better to\r\nlet the old term stand as practically equivalent to independentclairvoyance, and leave the supernormal perception of mentalobjects to rank as a form of telepathy.\r\nWhen, however, we truai from questions of terminology to\r\nquestions of substance, the sharp division of what is ordinarily\r\ncalled telepathy into two contrasted activities, an activity ofcommunication and an activity of perception, possesses, in myopinion, a high degree of interest. The chstinction itself is, ofcourse, not strictly speaking new. It has always been recognisedthat the terms agent and percipient might, in certain cases,\r\nconvey a misleachng idea of the true nature of the relation, andthat when a thought in A\u2019s mind becomes telepatIdeally sharedby B, the dynamic factor in the process may be on the side of Brather than of A. But, so far as I am aware, very little attempthad been made, up to the time when the Willett scripts quotedin this section were produced, to follow up the idea whether in\r\nits general implication or in its bearing on particular cases.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the positive assertion in the scripts\r\nthat one mind may be able to perceive and apprehend the\r\ncontents, actual and potential, of another mind without thatother\u2019s active intervention does, in effect, open up new avenuesfor thought, and if true, represents a real advance in ourknowledge of the subject. It no doubt suggests as manydifficult questions as it answers. But to expect from a single\r\nautomatist anything in the nature of a complete exposition ofthe methods and processes of communication would hardly bereasonable.\r\nOne question inevitably forced on our attention by the\r\n1 Since writing tliis chajjter I notice that Professor Driesch, in his book on\r\nPsychical Research (translated by Th. Besternian, 1933) lays great stress on\r\nthe distinction between thought-coininmiication and thought-reading, and,\r\nlike the coinniunieators in the Willett scripts, confines the term telepathy\r\nexclusively to the former.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett' s AIediumship 209\r\nWillett scripts is this : What is the relation to each other of the\r\ntwo kinds of activity ? Are they in any circumstances mutually\r\nindependent, or does the exercise of the one activity necessarily\r\ncall the other into operation ?\r\nI find it difficult to believe that the activity of communication (telepathy (W)) can ever be effective without some re- sponding activity of apprehension (telaesthesia (W)). Conscious\r\nreception must imply activity. It is easier to conceive the\r\nactivity of apprehension as being effective without calling into\r\nplay a responding activity of communication, at all events if the object apprehended is, as the scripts affirm it may be, the\r\npotential content of another mind. But without going so far as to deny the possibility of extreme cases in which one activity\r\nmay be in operation to the complete exclusion of the other,\r\nI can scarcely doubt that in general both factors contribute in\r\nvarying measme to the total result. From this point of view,\r\ninstead of asking which of the parties concerned is the agent and\r\nwhich is the percipient, we should rather inquire which of the\r\ntwo activities forms the starting-point of the process, and use\r\nthis test as a basis for classifying any given case as an example\r\nof communication (telepathic emission), or as an example of\r\nmind-reading (telepathic perception).\r\nIt may not always be easy, or even possible, to answer this\r\nquestion. In experimental telepathy, for instance, can we say\r\nwith confidence which of the two activities is the initiating\r\nfactor in the result of the experiment ? Both agent and percipient are consciously exerting themselves, the agent to impress an idea on the mind of the percipient and the percipient\r\nto read the mind of the agent. In such a case the two activities\r\nmay well be independent and concurrent factors in the process.\r\nConsider, on the other hand, those automatic productions of\r\na sensitive like Mrs Willett which take the form of lengthy\r\nverbal messages appearing to her to proceed from a source other\r\nthan herself. Whatever that soiu\u2019ce may be, whether a discarnate spirit or a dissociated self, it would surely be paradoxical\r\nto regard these as anything else than communications in respect\r\nof which the apprehending activity plays the secondary part\r\nof a listener in relation to a speaker.\r\nYet I certainly should not be prepared to say that all mediumistic phenomena belong to this class. We have it on\r\n210 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [parttlie authority of the Willett scripts themselves that the sensitivecan, and does, draw upon the content of another mind withoutthe active intervention of the latter. I refrain from dogmatising on the subject, but I suspect that the remarkable supernormal insight of many professional mediums into the privateaffairs of their sitters originates rather in mind-reading than inany activity of comnnmication either from the subliminal of thesitter or from some independent mind whether incarnate ordiscarnate. Here, as elsewhere, however, the problem is comphcated by the possibility of interaction between thesubliminal and the supraliminal of the medium herself. It maybe that her subliminal acts in a double capacity, as a mindreader in relation to the sitter, and as a communicator to that])art of herself which records whether by speech or in writing.\r\nVery interesting are the reciprocal cases described in the last\r\nchapter (pp. 177 ff.). In these telepathy (W) and telaesthesia(W) are both in operation together, but the agent becomes thepercipient and the percipient the agent in rapid alternation.\u201c Thought leaps out to wed with thought \u201d, and \u201c Responseconditions the power of transmission \u201d in such wise that theprocess may be conceived as continuing ad infinitum \u201c\r\nuntil wetwain be one \u201d. If complete oneness were ever actuallyachieved, this would presumably mean not that the twoactivities had ceased to be distinguishable, but that they hadceased as such to exist.\r\nIf the reader will take the trouble to glance back at ChapterIII. of Part I. on Types of Comrmmications he will probablycome to the conclusion that some of the experiences theretreated as communications might with almost equal plausibilitybe classed as cases of thought-perception. Indeed I raised thisvery question myself with regard to the awareness of \u201c pre-sences \u201d unattended by any impression of a more definitecharacter. Should bare awareness of a \u201c presence \u201d count asa communication in the technical sense of the term ? Theformal answer according to my view would be, Yes, if it arisesfrom a telepathic impact directed by another mind ; No, if it originates in the exercise of an independent perceptive activityby the sensitive. But I do not pretend that this answer wouldcarry us much further.\r\nHow are we to determine which of the two activities is\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Alediumship 211\r\nprimary and which is secondary ? Might not both be operative\r\nsimultaneously and in equal measure ? A passage in the D.I.\r\nof March 13, 1912 (see p. 215 below), refers to \u201c the unseen\r\ncompanions, the presences known by that unexplored facidty,\r\nintuition Intuition is associated in the scripts with activity\r\nof perception, but it is not necessary to accept this statement\r\nas definitely settling the question.\r\nThe more elaborate and comphcated processes of communication (described in the extracts quoted on pji. 192-195\r\nabove), in wiaich the material utihsed in the scripts is said to be\r\nderived from the products of \u201c mutual selection \u201d supplemented and guided by direct telepathic impulse, must be\r\nreserved for separate treatment in the next chapter.\r\nI have still, however, something to say in the present chapter\r\nupon the psychical experience, to which the scripts apj:)ly the\r\nterm \u201c excursus \u201d. The reader will remember that in the D.I. of June 4, 1911,\r\nwhich was mainly devoted to the tojiic of \u201c mutual selection \u201d, a capacity for excmsus on the part of the sensitive was laid\r\ndown by Gurney as one of the conditions of successful production of a certain type of script. Capacity for excursus I interpreted to mean a power of going in some sense outside oneself\r\nin order to enter into communion with the spiritual world.\r\nThis brief description sufficed for the moment, but the subject\r\ndeserves more detailed examination.\r\nLet me begin by putting together in chronological order the\r\nmore important passages ^ that relate to it, only ju\u2019emising that\r\nin WiUett scripts excursus and ecstasy are used as practically\r\nsynonymous terms.\r\nExtract fro7)i Lone Script of Ajyril 16, 1911.\r\n. . .

Excursus is the going out to meet something else.\r\nIt\u2019s the opposite to invasion.)\r\nWell, that\u2019s the way I do these things.\r\nA^ote.\u2014The sitting had opened with a comnumication inwriting from an unidentified source\u2014perhaps the Dark YoungMan. This was followed by a dictated passage, in which theautomatist described, as if on her own account and from herown present observation, a scene in which certain members ofthe group on the other side, including the Dark Young Man,were taking jDart. She was evidently visualising them in theform in which they might have appeared during life. After apause the record proceeded as above.\r\nITie foregoing extracts make it clear that the term excursusis used in Willett scripts to denote an act by which the incarnatespirit seeks to place itself in conscious relation with a spiritualenvironment. Tliis spiritual environment\u2014the metetherial asit is often called\u2014is declared to be the soul\u2019s true nativeelement. The passing into it, which is the effect of excursus, is variously described as \u201c the crossing of a border \u201d, \u201c thefreeing of that wliicli is capable of intuitional visions of fardistant worlds \u201c the falling of barriers \u201c the delocahsationof the soul testifying to the existence of a whole \u201c the escape^ \u201c Either you\u2019re loosed or they\u2019re entered \u201d I take to mean that the case\r\nis one either of excursus or of incursion, and that the bewildered sensitive hardly knows which. \u201c To be somebody else \u201d and to \u201c feel somebody else\u2019s mmd inside yorn- mind \u201d points to incursion, and what I have called \u201ctele- pathic possession \u201d (see pp. 175 ff. above) : on the other hand the sense\r\nof tunelessness and of omniscience suggest excursus and communion withthe \u201c Central Unity linking all experience \u201d.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'\u2019 s Medium,ship 221\r\nfrom the limits of self \u201d, \u201c the escape of the smaller into the\r\nlarger\r\nThe occasional footnotes appended to the several extracts\r\nmay be usefully supplemented by a few observations of a more\r\ngeneral character intended to throw light on some doubtful and\r\ndifficult points, though I fear others will remain of which I cannot hope to give a thoroughly satisfactory explanation.\r\nI have interpreted excursus as involving an \u201c act \u201d on the\r\npart of the sensitive ; and by \u201c act \u201d I mean something that\r\nimplies conscious purpose and effort. In liis chapter on \u201c Trance,\r\nPossession and Ecstasy,\u201d Myers remarks : \u201c Die Geisterwelt ist nicht verschlossen : these sensitives [i.e. the favoured individuals\r\npossessing the natural capacity] have but to sink into a deep\r\nrecueillement, a guarded slumber, and that gate stands manifestly ajar. It is rather on the other side of the gidf that\r\ndifficulties and perplexities come thick and fast \u201d.^ Excursus,\r\nhowever, in the Willett scripts, means more than mere passivity.\r\nThe Myers of the scripts teUs us (in the script of May 11, 1911,\r\nquoted below) that, \u201c Ecstasy springs from meditation \u201d ; and\r\nhe draws an emphatic distinction between meditation and\r\nlethargy or torpor. The very term \u201c excursus \u201d suggests an\r\nactive process ; and the language employed by the sensitive\r\nherself, in such phrases as \u201c I want to get out of myself, I\u2019m so\r\ntired of myself, I want to be enlarged \u201d, carries a similar\r\nimplication. Compare also the striking statement in the waking\r\nstage of the sitting of June 8, 1930, in which she informs us that excursus is \u201c the way I do these things \u201d, meaning that it is by\r\nexcursus that she acquires knowledge of happenings in the\r\nworld of spirits.\r\nNevertheless, I do not think the act of excursus constitutes\r\nin itself an achieved communion with the spiritual world. From\r\nthe side of the sensitive it is rather a kind of reaching out\r\ntowards the unseen\u2014\u201c a hstening in silence, knowing that the\r\nsilence is an unforgoable prelude to the spoken word \u201d, to\r\nborrow an expression from a script not included in the collection\r\nof extracts.2 The attitude of expectation favours telepathic\r\ninteraction, but another factor is indispensable. Not until the\r\nmind of the sensitive has passed into a relation more or less\r\ndefinite with discarnate mind does excursus actually become in\r\n^ H.P., vol. ii., p. 251. ^ From the script of May 20, 1915.\r\n222 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [partthe full sense co-operation and communion between the living\r\nand the dead, though \u201c the vague but genuine consciousness ofthe spiritual environment \u201d, which Myers claims in certain casesfor artistic or philosophic genius, is recognised as a kind ofrudimentary communion with the spiritual world d\r\nCommunion led up to by excursus may (I conceive) takeeither of the two forms the consideration of which has occupiedso much of our attention in the present section, ft may takethe form in which telepathic communication is the primaryactivity and telepathic perception plays only a secondary part ; or it may take the form in which the primary activity is thetelepathic perception of the contents of another mind, anyactive response of that mind being of secondary significance, if not entirely absent. There seems to be no reason to supposethat the sensitive cannot telepathically impress discarnateminds : in fact, something of the kind would seem to occur in\r\nthose reciprocal cases of which the D.I. of February 7, 1915(see pp. 177 If. above), furnishes so interesting an example.But on the whole it may be said that, so far as the Willettrecords are concerned, activity of communication is almostentirely on the side of the discarnate, whereas the power, insome measiu\u2019e, of reading each other\u2019s mind is claimed for bothsides as an important factor in the production of a certain typeof scripts. Indeed, this power in the sensitive is repeatedlydeclared to be the prerogative of the subliminal acting normallyin the metetherial ; knowledge thereby acquired is supernormally acquired only from the point of view of the supraliminal.In the script of November 10, 1912, \u201c the excursive power ofthe mind \u201d is opposed to \u201c the invasion into the sphere of timeof those elements which, erstwhile bound in its shackles, nowhave passed into a state of emancipation \u201d. And again in thescript of December 14, 1913, we read : \u201c I will build mytabernacle in the hearts of men, the altar not of stone, but ofthe tablets of the heart. That gives the idea of incursion, theforce which seeks to penetrate. Now give the other\u2014to enterinto the great calm, the waveless heights. So shall that whichis in appearance twain be onei), and these are God and thouthyself ai\u2019t they \u201d.\r\nCI. H . l \u2019., vol. i., pp. 11 1 and 218.\r\n140] Psychological As-pects of Mrs Willett's 31eclimnship 223\r\nIf these passages stood alone one might be tempted to\r\ninterpret them as identifying \u201c invasion \u201d or \u201c incursion \u201d with\r\nthe activity of communication, and excursus with the activity\r\nof perception. I do not think this would be entirely correct.\r\nI prefer to regard excursus as a kind of preparatory stage,\r\nfacilitating the exercise of either activity whether by the\r\nsensitive or by a chscarnate spirit. But that excursus is in a\r\nspecial degree associated in the scripts with telepathic perception by the sensitive, and particularly with telepathic perception\r\nindependent of the active intervention of the mind whose\r\ncontent is perceived, seems to me beyond doubt. This independent activity of perception, constituting what 1 may call\r\nthe most characteristic form of telsesthesia (W), is sometimes\r\ndescribed in the scripts by the term intuition.\r\nIn this connection the record of the sitting of December 17,\r\n1913, quoted in full on pp. 69 If., and again referred to on p.\r\n218 above, is, I venture to think, very instructive. If my\r\nunderstanchng of the dictated part of the record is correct, the\r\ncommunicator is not one of the group on the other side, but the\r\n\u201c subhminal self \u201d of the sensitive dictating to her supraliminal.\r\nSpeaking apparently in projyria persona, she describes in considerable detail, and almost as if it were a contemporaneons\r\nexperience of her own, the scene immortalised in the Symposium\r\nof Plato. It presents itself to her first as a picture\u2014\r\na\r\npicture\r\nthat I often love and see. Marble pillars everywhere\u2014a most\r\nheavenly scene. A company of men\u2014small company discussing everything in heaven and earth. . . . There was such intercoui\u2019se of the human mind going on in that room, and I know it so well I almost fancy I must have been there, tliongh it happened a long time ago \u201d. In the sequel \u201c my picture that I like\r\nto look at \u201d becomes \u201c my room where I choose to walk \u201d, and\r\nvarious incidents in the story, including the irruption of Alcibiades and his riotous friends, are described as if they were\r\nbeing enacted before her very eyes. Finally, she ends up (see\r\np. 219 above) by saying, \u201c You know I\u2019ve not got to be tied np\r\nalways to myself. I can get up and walk aboxit in other worlds ; and I very often like to walk through the room where that scene took place \u201d.\r\nIt is possible that we have here an ordinary case of ci\u20183q)toninesia. But it is also possible that the scene thus vividly\r\n224 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partdescribed may be intended as an illustration of excnrsus leading\r\nup to independent telepathic perception of the memory contentof some other mind or minds. If that be a true account of the\r\nexperience, the next question will he, From what other mind or minds was the knowledge acquired ? The answer that mostreachly suggests itself is. The mind or minds of one or more ofthe group on the other side, whom the sensitive describes as having been present and recognised by her, although not as actually communicating. Nevertheless, I cannot help suspecting that this is not what we are meant to understand. I invite\r\ncarefid attention to the remark at the end of the sitting ; \u201c Hownothing time is ! All human experience is one \u201d\r\n; and beg the\r\nreader to compare it with the waking stage of the immediatelypreceding sitting of December 14, 1913, especially with its concluding sentences : \u201c Don\u2019t you ever walk out of yourself ? Aren\u2019t you tired of being always yourself ? It\u2019s so heavenly to\r\nbe out of myself, when I\u2019m everything, you know, and everything else is me \u201d. Compare again a jjassage from the script ofMarch 22, 1913 : \u201c Oh how superficial has been the grasp ofman iq)on the truths of the sohdarity of the human race, theinconceivable oneness of Souls. . . What links is the eternalseqiience of human emotions, hopes and fears, and joys andsorrows. There is a great centre into which is gathered up all the indivichial experiences \u201d. From these passages ^ it is perhaps not overbold to conjectiu'c\r\nthat the mind from whose memories we are to understand thevision of the Sy7nposiuin to be derived is this same great centre,\r\nconceived as in some sense a unity in multiplicity, or collective\r\nunity, of all individual souls, in which time vanishes into aneternal now.^ At this point, however, we enter upon a region\r\n\u2018 The extract from the sitting of April 19, 1918 (p. 219 above) should also be considered, although i\/rima facie the exjjeriences described in it by the\r\nsensitive would apjjear to be a ease of \u201c telepathic possession \u201d by another\r\nindividual consciousness, mtlier tlian of communion with universal mind.\r\n1 susjject thei\u2019e is confusion in the j^assage.\r\n\u201c Compare H.P., vol. i., p. 31 . \u201c The Imowledge of the past which automatic\r\ncommunications manifest is in most cases apparently referable to the actual\r\nmemory of persons still existing beyond the tomb. It reaches us telepathically, as from a mind in which remote scenes are still imprinted. But there are\r\ncertain scenes which are not easily assigned to the individual memory of any\r\ngiven spiiit. And if it be jiossible for us to learn of present facts by telsesthesia\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mecliumship 225\r\nof speculative mysticism into which I will not attempt to\r\npenetrate further.\r\nThe extracts relating to the subject of excursus contain a good many allusions to opinions expressed in Human Personality,\r\nand even to particular passages in that work. References to\r\nsome of these have been given in footnotes to the extracts\r\nthemselves. Speaking generally, I should say that the meaning\r\nof excursus and ecstasy in the Willett scripts does not differ\r\nwidely from that of the corresponding terms ^ in Human\r\nPersonality\r\n.\r\nNevertheless there are differences, and not unimportant ones ; and to these I must now advert.\r\nThe definition of ecstasy given in the Glossary to Human\r\nPersonality runs as follows :\r\nEcstasy.\u2014A trance during which the spirit of the automatist\r\npartially quits his body, entering into a state in which the\r\nspiritual world is more or less open to its perception, and in\r\nwhich it so far ceases to occupy its organism as to leave room\r\nfor an invading spirit to use it in somewhat the same fashion\r\nas its owner is accustomed to use it.\r\nIf my interpretation of ecstasy as understood by the Willett\r\ncommunicators is correct, they would accept that part of this\r\ndefinition which describes ecstasy as a state in which the\r\nspiritual world is more or less oi^en to the perception of the\r\nas well as by telepathy ; \u2014by some dii-eet supernormal percipieiice without\r\nthe intervention of any other mind to which the facts are already known,\r\n\r\nmay there not be also a retro-cognitive telaesthesia by which we may attain a direct knowledge of facts in the past ? \u201c Some conception of tliis kmd may possibly come nearest to the truth. It may even be that some World Soul is perennially conscious of all its past ; and that individual souls, as they enter into deeper consciousness, enter\r\ninto something which is at once reminiscence and actuality \u201d. . . . Cf. also H.P., vol. ii., p. 76.\r\n1 The corresponding terms in Human Personality are ecstasy and exciu'sioii. For excursion the scripts substitute excursus ; but I do not think there is any\r\nsignificance in the changed form of the word. Ecstasy and excui-sus are synonymous terms in the scripts. Between ecstasy and excursion in H.P.\r\nthe difference is hardly one of substance. Cf. H.P., vol. ii., p. 210, \u201cNo\r\nline of absolute separation can be drawn between the brief psycliical excursions\r\npreviously described, and those more prolonged excursions of the spirit which\r\nI would group under the name of ecstasy\r\n226 Psychological As2)ects of Mrs Willett's Medinmshij) [partspirit of the automatist, but would not accept, as conditions ofits entei'ing that state, either that the automatist must beentranced, or that his spirit should j^artially quit the body ; nor would they admit any necessary connection betweenecstasy and possession. To admit the latter would indeed beeqixivalent to denying that Mrs Willett was ever in a state ofecstasy, for they emphatically deny that in her case possessionever takes place.\r\nIt is right to add that when, in his chapter on Trance,Possession, and Ecstasy, Myers comes to treat of the subject in\r\ndetail, the terms of the definition of ecstasy given in theGlossary are not rigidly insisted on. The subjoined passagefrom that chapter ^ may be taken, 1 think, as expressing his\r\nmore considered views : Among the cases of trance [he writes] discussed in this\r\nchapter Ave have found intimately interwoven with the phenomena of possession many instances of its correlative,\u2014ecstasy.\r\nMrs Piper\u2019s fragmentary utterances and visions during herpassage from trance to waking life,\u2014utterances and visions thatfade away and leave no remembrance in lier wakmg self ; Moses\u2019 occasional visions, his journeys in the \u201c spirit world \u201d\r\nwhich he recorded on returning to his ordmary consciousness ; Home\u2019s entrancement and converse with the various controls\r\nwhose messages he gave ; \u2014all these suggest actual excursionsof the incarnate spiiit from its organism. The theoretical\r\nimportance of these spiritual excursions is, of course, very great.\r\nIt is, indeed, so great that most men will hesitate to accept athesis which carries us straight into the inmost sanctuary of\r\nmysticism ; which preaches \u201c a precursory entrance into themost holy place, as by divine transportation \u201d. Yet I think that this belief, although extreme, is not, at the\r\npoint to which our evidence has carried us, in any real wayimprobable. To put the matter luiefly, if a spirit from outside can enter the organism, the spirit from inside can go out, canchange its centre of perception and action, in a way less complete and irrevocable than the change of death. Ecstasy wouldthus be simply the complementary or correlative aspect of\r\nspirit-control. Such a change need not be a S'patial change,\r\nU.F., vol. ii., p. 269.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019 s 31ecKumship 227\r\nany more than there need be any spatial change for the spirit\r\nwhich invades the deserted organism. Nay, further, if the\r\nincarnate spirit can in this manner change its centre of perception in response (so to say) to a discarnate spirit\u2019s invasion of\r\nthe organism, there is no obvious reason why it should not do so on other occasions as well. We are already familiar with\r\n\u201c travelling clairvoyance \u201d, a spirit\u2019s change of centre of perception among the scenes of the material world. May there\r\nnot be an extension of travelling clairvoyance to the spiritual\r\nworld ? a spontaneous transfer of the centre of perception into\r\nthat region from whence discarnate spirits seem now to be able, on their side, to communicate with growing freedom ?\r\nI gather from this passage :\r\n(1) That complete trance, in which the spirit of the automatist so far ceases to occupy its organism as to leave room for\r\nan invading sj)irit to use that organism telergically, is no longer\r\nregarded as a necessary condition of ecstasy, inasmuch as ecstasy\r\nas not denied to Mrs Piper\u2019s waking stage, when she is represented as having \u201c retmiied to her body \u201d, and as sj)eaking ozi her own account in the first person.\r\n(2) That though the jihenomena recorded of IMi\u2019s Piper, of\r\nStainton Moses, and of Home, \u201c suggest actual excursions of\r\nthe incarnate spirit from its organism \u201d, this \u201c change in its centre of perception \u201d, \u201c need not be a spatial change any more\r\nthan there need be any spatial change for the spirit which\r\ninvades the deserted organism \u201d.\r\n(3) That even if ecstasy be a condition of possession, possession is not necessarily a conchtion of ecstasy. If the incarnate\r\nspirit can \u201c change its centre of perception in response (so to\r\nsay) to a discarnate spirit\u2019s invasion of the organism \u201d, there\r\nis no obvious reason why it should not do so on other occasions\r\nas well \u201d.\r\nI do not think it will be disputed that the important passages\r\nwhich I have quoted show signs of a movement of thought in a\r\nchrection favourable to the conception of exciu\u2019sus or ecstasy\r\npresented in the Willett scripts.\r\nNevertheless I find it difficult to resist the impression that\r\nfor the Myers of Human Personality ecstasy implied actual\r\nlocomotion in space, and that any more subtle interpretation\r\n228 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part 140]\r\nof the phenomena did not really commend itself to him.^ On\r\nthe other hand I know of nothing in Willett script leading us\r\nto suppose that her descriptions of excursus in terms of motion\r\nin space are meant to be literally interpreted. When she speaks\r\nof \u2018\r\n\u2018 walking out of herself \u201d\r\n, of \u201c walking about in other worlds \u2019 \u2019\r\n,\r\nof becoming \u201c enlarged \u201d, it is manifest that these expressions\r\nare metaphorical and figurative, or, at most, are to be taken as representing the dreamlike construction subjectively superimposed by the sensitive upon the experience of a change of\r\nenvironment from the \u201c etherial \u201d to the \u201c metetherial\r\nHere as elsewhere, in so far as the Willett scripts indicate a departure from the teachings of Hximan Personality, the\r\ntendency appears to be towards a more consistently idealistic\r\nstandpoint.^\r\n^ See especially H.F., vol. ii., p. 194.\r\n^ Cf. lone script of June 19, 1910, (Myers communicating) : \u201cAll I touch\r\nshows me this the Real is the Ideal the transcendental view of material\r\nphenomena is the truest \u201d.\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nHOW SOME SCRIPTS ARE PRODUCED\r\nMrs Willett\u2019s automatic productions are of two well-marked\r\ntypes. To one type belong those which are consecutive,\r\ncoherent, and for the most part readily intelligible ; to the\r\nother those which are scrappy, disjointed, allusive, and often\r\ndifficult of interpretation. A similar distinction apphes also to\r\nthe scripts of other members of the group\u2014Mrs Verrall, Mrs\r\nSalter, Mrs \u201c Holland \u201d, Dame Edith Lyttelton (Mrs \u201c King\u201d),\r\nMrs Wilson, Mr and Mrs Kenneth Richmond\u2014but in their case the disjointed scripts greatly outnumber the continuous\r\nones, and, so far as I am able to judge, also outweigh them in\r\nimportance. The Willett scripts, on the other hand, contain\r\nabundance of noteworthy examples of both types ; and the\r\nmain advantage to the communicators in resorting to the disjointed and allusive type seems to be, in her case (and probably\r\nin that of other members of the group), a resulting obscurity\r\nwhich conceals from the automatist the inner meaning of what\r\nshe is writing or speaking, and is therefore well adapted for the\r\nproduction of cross-correspondences. The work of interpretation is deliberately reserved to the investigators. Thus in the\r\nlone script of dime 10, 1910, we read ; \u201c Myers to-day I want\r\nonly allusions which others will sift ... let the pen run let the\r\nhand he limp so shall the word come that is not understanded\r\nof many what I say now you understand not but you shall\r\nknow hereafter \u201d. And again on November 13, 1910 : \u201c Let\r\nthoughts flit past you cease [seize] what you can make\r\nrecords that others may delve . . . Let the words come to you\r\na blank but of others understandable \u201d. Doubtless much the\r\nsame purpose is served by the employment of trance conditions\r\nfor messages which the communicators do not wish the sensitive\r\nto remember after the sitting is over. In the early days of IVIrs WiUett\u2019s mediumship the scripts were practically all of the consecutive type, and were largely\r\n229\r\n230 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumsliip [part\r\noccupied with messages personal to herself. The disjointed andallusive type first appears in the so-called \u201c Lethe scripts \u201d of\r\nFebruary 4 and February 10, 1910, for which see Proceedings\r\n,\r\nvol. XXV., pp. 122-4, and pp. 148-50.\r\nAfter this disjointed scripts become fairly common, andoccasionally passages with the characteristics of each type\r\nsucceed one another in the same script. When the communicator means to embark on chsjointed script he frequently begins\r\nwith the words, \u201c Let the pen run \u201d, or some equivalent phrase.\r\nThis I take to be an injunction to let production be as effortless\r\nand as automatic as possible.\r\nThe strong contrast between the two types of script naturally\r\nbegan to attract the attention of the investigators, and its significance to be a subject of discussion among us. Finally, onFebruary 9, 1911, Sir Oliver Lodge j)ut a direct question to\r\nGurney.\r\nExtract from the Script of Felmiary 9, 1911. {Present, 0. J. L.)\r\n(0. J. L. ... There is another question I want to ask. Wehave had lately long lists of quotations, so many and so widely\r\nsupplied that it would appear as if cross-correspondence mustoccasionally occur by accident. Some of the group feel that.\r\nThey want to know whether you are sending these of set purpose.)\r\nYes, who says so ?\r\n(0. J. L. Well, we have been talking it over lately with\r\nG. W. B. and J. G. P. and Mrs S.)\r\nDo they suggest shorter scripts ?\r\n{O. J. L. No, they do not want to suggest anything definite,\r\nonly to find out whether the scripts which are arriving are considered on your side quite wise and satisfactory.)\r\nDo you mean the M. V. case or W. ?\r\n(0. J. L. Oh, I do not mean W. only ; I mean Verrall andHolland also. We think that sceptics will claim that the cross- correspondences are accidental ; also that the meaning is so obscure that we may miss it, for we assume that besides cross- correspondence you wish to convey a definite meaning too.)\r\nThey were allusive. You must get through a good bulk of\r\nmatter to get in what you want said from our standpoint. Theyare not without threads of comiexion. But hsten. Those\r\n140] Psychological Asjjects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumslivp 231\r\nthreads extend also in subliminal of antomatist. Thus if I would say fire I Gurney might make allusion to Phoel^us or to\r\nZoroaster Her subliminal may conceivably go one better and\r\nshove in Salamander\r\n(0. J. L. Yes, well, that is what we rather suspected, that\r\nsubliminal activity was mixed with your intention.)\r\nWhat ?\r\n{0. J. L. repeated.)\r\nWho ? Woven strands Pick out the gold thread . . . The above passage gave the first clear hint that there was\r\nsomething peculiar about the process by which disjointed\r\nscripts were produced. It was not until some months later that\r\nthe subject was resumed. In the interval Gurney had been\r\nexpressing a strong desire to be placed in direct communication\r\nwith me ; but Mxs Willett herself, whom I had met for the first time only a few days before the date of the script just quoted,\r\nhad felt a very natural reluctance to add a comparative stranger\r\nto the number of her \u201c sitters \u201d, hitherto confined to Mrs\r\nVerrall and Sir Oliver Lodge. Gurney, however, insisted (he\r\nand I had been close friends in days gone by), and it was\r\nultimately arranged that I should have a sitting on June 4,\r\n1911. It is evident from the subjoined script that Gurney was\r\nanxious to explain to me certain aspects of the jjrocess of\r\ncommunication.\r\nLone Scrigjt of May 21, 1911.\r\nGurney I wish I could get you to understand why I wanted\r\nto speak to Gerald What I wanted to say was for his information and not yours that is why I refused to put it into script.\r\nYou don\u2019t understand his point of view But it is completely\r\nintelligible to me He is interested in the process as distinct\r\nfrom the product. And it was about the process that I wanted\r\nto speak And the less you know of the process the better . . . because the recipient is best left in ignorance of the method.\r\nBut it does not follow that the investigator need be . . .\r\nI now come to the sitting of June 4, 1911, the first at which\r\nI was present. After a short prehminary script, D.I. followed\r\nin accordance with the customary routine already described.\r\nThe sensitive was fully entranced. I have already had occasion\r\nto quote more than one passage from this D.I. in connection\r\n232 Psychological Aspects of Airs Willett's Mediumship [partwith telcesthesia and excursus ; but in view of the light which it throws upon \u201c process \u201d I here reproduce it in full, adding suchfootnotes as may be useful for the elucidation of minor points.\r\nD.I. of June 4, 1911. {Preserit, G.

Oh he says, Gerald\u2014Oh he says like that. He\u2019s calling someone. Nobody answers\u2014he keeps on calling someone. He says\r\nGerald. Oh he keeps on calling.

There\u2019s another field for selection\u2014and it\u2019s such part of my\r\nmmd, I, Gurney, as she can have access to. Oh he says. What\r\npart ? Why ? Oh, I\u2019ve missed a word\u2014something something\r\nlimited to\u2014then I\u2019ve skipped something, but I hear him say\r\nthoughts potentially.\r\nOh he says, put it another way.

Gurney is referring to the class of scripts that I have described as \u201c chsjointed \u201d. He tells us expressly that what he is going to say\r\nis not to be taken as applying to D.I. \u201c when the communication is more cUrect and simpler \u201d, nor as applying \u201c to all sensitives, or even to all phenomena of any given sensitive \u201d,\r\nand that all he is attempting is to show \u201c how in some cases some scripts are produced \u201d. On the part of the communicator\r\nthe production of this special class of scripts involves, in addition\r\nto the use of telepathy and inspiration (later on explained as a\r\nvariety of telepathic action), a third activity, namely selection\r\nfrom the contents, subliminal and suprahminal, of the mind of\r\nthe sensitive. On the part of the medium there is required\u2014(1)\r\nthe faculty of excursus, (2) the capacity for definite selection\r\nfrom the contents of the mind of the communicator, and (3) the\r\npower of externalising by writing or otherwise the knowledge\r\n^ Cf. \u201c the capacity for definite selection \u201d which is included in the\r\n\u201c partial definition of what constitutes mediumship \u201d given in the earlier part of the sitting.\r\n^ This remark is an anticipation of statements made in later scripts, but\r\nI do not understand its relevance here. Cf. the lone script of August 20,\r\n1911, given in the a^jpendix to this paper. Action and Truth which is dependant which is primary.\u201d\r\n236 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [pabt\r\nthereby acquired. The power of externalisation is, of course,\r\nan indispensahle condition of mediumship in any form ; and\r\nthis may also be true in some measure of the faculty of excursus. The role played by telepathy and inspiration in the production of disjointed scripts is left over for later consideration ; and similarly, on the side of the sensitive, nothing more is said\r\nabout excursus or about the faculty of mediumistic \u201c emission \u201d.\r\nInstead the script concentrates upon selection, and especially\r\non the fact of its mutual exercise by both the parties concerned.\r\nIt is hardly necessary to dwell here on those passages in the\r\nD.I. that relate to the somrces of information upon which, in\r\nmutual selection, the selectors are said respectively to draw\r\nnamely the conscious and unconscious mind of the sensitive,\r\nand the content, actual and potential, of the mind of the\r\ncommunicator. This aspect of the subject has already been\r\nsufficiently dealt with in the preceding section. What I am nowconcerned with is the process employed in the production of\r\nscripts of the special class which the communicator has in view,\r\nand the part which mutual selection is said to play in it. The class in question I have assumed to be that of disjointed\r\nscripts ; and one purpose of these scripts\u2014already suspected\r\nby the investigators\u2014is clearly brought out in the words \u201c Saythat after deliberation a certain theme is selected. ^ Then he\r\nsays something in German\r\n\r\nynotif\u2014to be got through various\r\nchannels.\u201d Evidently the object aimed at is a cross-corres- pondence with other automatists of the group, which shall\r\ncentre upon and serve to develop the chosen theme. What is wanted is not a mere simple and superficial correspondence of\r\ndetached words or phrases appearing in the scripts of chfferent\r\nautomatists. In order to achieve the purpose of the communicator the correspondences must be relevant to some non- obvious whole to which the automatists are contributing without\r\nbeing aware of the inner meaning of what they write. AsGurney explains on another occasion, \u201c The reason, for selection\r\n' Note that tlie selection of a theme or subject of a C.G. is not to be confused\r\nwitli tlie \u201c mutual selection \u201d which is the main topic of the D.I. The use\r\nof the same word in both connections is perhaps unfortvmate, but should\r\nnot give rise to any misunderstanding.\r\nGurney does not say who \u201c deliberates \u201d, or who decides upon the theme\r\nto be chosen. On this point see p. 243 below.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetts Mediumship 237\r\nof subjects of C.C. is then demonstrated when the thread the\r\ncentral thread is picked out.\u201d ^\r\nIt would seem that for the production of disjointed scripts\r\nthe accumulation beforehand of suitable material is, if not\r\nnecessary, at least advantageous, and that herein lies the special\r\nfunction of the selection which the sensitive makes from the\r\ncontents of the mind of the communicator. That selection is clearly preparatory : it is not made at the time of the production of the script. Is the selection by the communicator\r\npreparatory like that of the sensitive, or does it come into\r\noperation only at the very end of the process, when the moment\r\nhas come for actual externalisation ? Selection by the communicator must certainly be supposed\r\nto occm: in the final stage of the process, but may it not operate\r\nat an earlier stage also ? The very phrase \u201c mutual selection \u201d\r\nseems rather to suggest that selection by the sensitive and at\r\nleast some selection by the communicator belong to the same\r\nstage in the process. That this is so, and that the stage in\r\nquestion is a preparatory one, is a natural inference from the\r\nform of words used by Gmaiey when he says : \u201c Now then\r\n\\i.e. apparently after mutual selection has taken place] you have\r\npresent in the whole self the matter from which I selected plus\r\nthe matter supernormally acquired from me. Now comes the\r\nweaving.\u201d\r\nWithout attempting to pass a final judgment on this point,\r\nwe may summarise the process described in the D.I. of June 4,\r\n1911, as including four successive stages :\r\n(1) the choice of a theme ;\r\n(2) the selection of material relevant to the theme, by the\r\nsensitive from the mind of the communicator, and\r\nprobably also by the communicator from the mind of\r\nthe sensitive ;\r\n(3) a period of \u201c incubation \u201d, often a long one, during which\r\nthere comes into play an operation described as \u201c weaving \u201d, and consisting in some kind of subliminal activity;\r\n(4) actual production of script, involving selection by the\r\ncommunicator from the \u201c available factors \u201d in the\r\nmind of the sensitive, and the bringing in of telepathy\r\nas a \u201c guiding influence \u201d.\r\n^ Trance-script preceding D.I. of September 10, 1911.

B.)\r\n238 Psychological Aspecis of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumshij) [part\r\nTlie first, third, and fourth stages are l)ut briefly indicated\r\nin the D.I. we are now considering, but further light is thrownupon tliem in later sittings, to which I shall presently have to\r\ncall attention.\r\nThe D.I. of June 4, 1911, may fairly be said to mark a fresh\r\ndeparture in the Willett communications relating to process.\r\nIt is the first of a series of deliverances of an essentially dogmatic character, containing statements which, if accepted at\r\naU, must be accepted on the authority of the communicators.The deliberate choice of a theme, and the partial dependence of\r\nthe communicator nj)on selection from material already in the\r\nminds of the antomatists, might indeed be plausibly inferred\r\nfrom observed facts ; but selection by the sensitive from the\r\nmind of the communicator and detailed descriptions of anypart of the process are matters which must be taken on trust.\r\n1 am far from dismissing them on that account as void of\r\ninterest. But my part in dealing with them will be that of\r\ninterpreter rather than critic, except so far as I may find it impossible to reconcile one statement in the scripts with another.\r\nNext in the series in order of date, to the D.I. of June 4, 1911,\r\nconies a long ami important passage from the D.I. of October 8\r\nof the same year. It has already been quoted in. extenso in the\r\npreceding chapter (jip. 193-5). My purpose on that occasion\r\nwas to throw light on the meaning of the term telcesthesia in\r\nWillett scrijits. But the passage has an equally importantbearing on the subject of the present chapter and I am afraid\r\nI must troulile the reader to look back and study it from this\r\nnew point of view.\r\nIt begins with a question I had already asked, and to whicha partial answer had been returned, in the preliminary stage ofthe sitting. I now, at the request of the communicator, re- jieated the question : \u201c In mutual selection you say that the\r\nsensitive can select from such jiart of your mind as she can haveaccess to. What part is this ? \u201d Instead of attempting to\r\nanqilify his former reply the communicator says he would like\r\nto suggest something which will \u201c open another window \u201d. Dropping all reference to the source\u2014the actual and potential\r\ncontent of his mind- from which the sensitive is said to acquire\r\ninformation, he lays stress iq)on the nature of the activity by\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediiimship 239\r\nwhich the acquisition is made. To this activity he applies the\r\nterm telcesthesia\u2014the first appearance of the term in Willett\r\nscript\u2014and expressly distinguishes it from telepathy. \u201c Telepathy \u201d, he says, \u201c is one thing\u2014that\u2019s thought communication ; telsesthesia is knowledge, not thought, acquired by the\r\nsubliminal when operating normally in the metetherial Of\r\ncourse \u201c mind-reading \u201d ( = telaesthesia (W)) had always been\r\nassumed as the basis and presupposition of \u201c selection \u201d\r\n; but\r\nnever, I think, so emphatically as now, or in such sharp distinction from telepathy. I have already gone so fully in the\r\npreceding chapter into the peculiar meaning attached to the\r\nterms telepathy and telaesthesia in Willett scrijits that it would\r\nbe waste of time to travel over the same ground again. The\r\nimplication, however, that telsesthesia is a normal activity of\r\nthe subliminal \u201c when operating in the metetherial \u201d i calls for a passing comment. In the D.I. of June 4 Gurney had spoken\r\nof the knowledge present in the \u201d whole self \u201d of the sensitive as including matter supernormally acquired from his own mind.\r\nThe apparent inconsistency is probably to be explained on the\r\nview that knowledge normally acquired by the subliminal may\r\nproperly be regarded as supernormally acquired by the supraliminal when passed on to the latter by the subliminal. In any\r\ncase the exercise of telaesthetic faculty by the subliminal when\r\noperating \u201c in the metetherial \u201d is not once only, but repeatedly\r\naffirmed to be normal and natural to it. The communicator now returns^to the risk he had previously\r\nhinted at in the D.I. on June 4, of a false infei\u2019ence being drawn\r\nfrom what he is about to say. If the materials out of which\r\ncross-correspondences are produced are provided ready-made\r\nin the minds of the automatists, is it necessary to postulate an\r\nexternal intelligence, and that a discarnate one, to account for\r\nthem ? The D.I. of October 8, 1911, suggests a triple answer to\r\nthis question. In the first place paid of the material from which\r\nthe final product is selected has been previously acquired (as\r\nexplained in the D.I. of June 4) from the mind of the communicator himself, and to that extent must be regarded as fresh\r\nmaterial not already contained in the mind of the automatist.\r\nIn the second place, it must not be forgotten that the message\r\n1 \u201c Wlien operating normally in the metetherial \u201d is equivalent, 1 think,\r\nto \" during excursus \u201d.\r\n240 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship [partas finally externalised may include \u201c elements received bydirect telepathic impact Lastly, and this is the most important consideration of all, evidence of spiritistic intervention\r\nis to be sought in the choice of topics resulting from the selection\r\nitself and their relation to a central idea known to the communicators, but not known to the antomatists concerned in a\r\ncross-correspondence.\r\nOh, he says, What I\u2019m saying may be used to cut at the\r\nspiritistic hypothesis, but it doesn\u2019t. Again, who selects whatof the total of telsesthetically acquired knowledge shall externalise itself\u2014shall blend itself with those elements received bydirect telepathic impact ? . . . Who applies the stimulus under\r\nwhich certain ideas\u2014use that word, not what I wanted\u2014-\r\nemerge, blended, which upon study will be found to be relevant\r\nto the total aim of that particular piece of automatism ? By \u201c relevant to the total aim of that particular piece ofautomatism \u201d Gurney means relevant to what in the D.I. of\r\ndune 4 he had spoken of as a\r\n\u201c theme \u201d or \u201c motif \u201d, commonto a number of cryptic allusions scattered among various\r\nantomatists.\r\nThe rest of the paragraph, of which I have just quoted the\r\nfirst and last sentences, provides an imaginary account of whatmay be supposed to happen in the second of the four stages, into\r\nwhich the process as a whole may be divided :\r\nOh, he says, Supposing T take her into a room, and I screen\r\noff any action of my own mind on hers ; her subliminal with\r\nits useful copious pinch of the salt of Eve\u2019s curiosity takes\r\nstock of the contents of the room. Normal consciousness is later regained, and lying in the subliminal is knowledge of\r\ncertain objects perceived, not as the residt of the action of mymind, but as the result of telsesthetic faculty. Oh, he says,\r\nHere come I on script intent. Here be arrows for my quiver.\r\nThere are several points in this passage that call for notice.\r\nFirst of all, what is meant by a \u201c room \u201d ? It cannot be\r\nidentified outright with the \u201c theme \u201d\r\n: yet it is obviously\r\nconnected with the theme. We shall not go far wrong if in this\r\nplace we take it to signify a collection of materials appropriate\r\nto the theme.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willettis Alediumship 241\r\nNext, observe that Gurney claims to be the agent in the\r\ntaking of the sensitive into the \u201c room This would seem to\r\nimply that he brings telepathic influence to bear on her,\r\nwhereby she is made acquainted with the general character of\r\nthe contents of the room ; and not till after that is done does\r\nhe screen off any action of his own mind on her and leave her\r\nto acquire \u201c telsesthetically \u201d a knowledge of the individual\r\n\u201c objects \u201d contained in it. This account will have to be considered in the light of later statements.\r\nFinally, it is made quite clear that this second stage is one\r\nof preparation, during which materials are being accumulated\r\nfor future use. It is followed by the third stage, described in\r\nthe D.I. of June 4 as a period of \u201c incubation \u201d. I think it is to this third stage that the next paragraph of the extract refers ; though it is difficult to say whether \u201c the loss \u201d of which it speaks is represented as occurring before the process of externalisation or during it :\r\nOh, he says, of all the contents of that mythical room say\r\nshe carries back a rough and partial knowledge\u2014not partial\r\nto the subliminal but reaching the point of externalisation\r\nmuch as Browning\u2019s London moon did\u2014in the process of\r\nexternalisation, there it is where the loss occurs. Oh, he says,\r\nof those ten say two emerge\u2014to me how interesting. I see the work of my hand, the double process.\r\nAccording to the D.I. of June 4 there occurs in the third stage\r\nwhat the communicator calls a \u201c weaving \u201d. It is in the weaving, he tells us, that \u201c subliminal activity comes in. Oh, he\r\nsays, it\u2019s a dangerous weapon, yet we cannot do without it.\u201d\r\nThe \u201c danger \u201d referred to I take to be, in part at least, that of\r\nthe loss incurred in the passing of the more perfect knowledge\r\nacquired by the subhminal into the rough and partial knowledge\r\nwhich is all that survives by the time the \u201c point of externalisation \u201d is reached. Thus of the ten ^ original items perhaps\r\nonly two ultimately emerge. Further discussion of the third\r\nstage must await my comments on the next script.\r\nThe \u201c double process \u201d I understand to mean the process of\r\nmutual selection.\r\nThe last paragraph of the extract undoubtedly relates to the\r\n* There liacl been no previous mention of te?i items.\r\n242 Psychological As'pccts of Mrs Willett's Mediumsldj) [partfourth and tinal stage of the process\u2014that of actual production,in which selection is on the side of the communicator and \u201c thespiritistic agency decides what element appropriate to its ownactivity shall emerge alongside and intertwined with matterplaced in position by direct telepathic impact\r\nBy way of illustration the communicator supposes the production of a cross-correspondence to be in progress, with horsesas its central theme. He has already telepathically impressedon Mrs Verrall ideas appropriate to the theme\u2014as, for instance,that of Pegasus ; and he follows this up by selecting andpushing up where they will be grasped and externalised two\u201c trump cards \u201d telsesthetically acquired by Mrs Willett\u2014sayhorse-shoe or the Steeds of Daivn. The appearance in Verrallscript of Pegasus and kindred ideas, and in Willett script ofhorse-shoe and Steeds of Dawn, would constitute a cross-corres-})ondence, doubtless of a very crude and elementary kind, butclaimed as illustrating the use of different methods in commimication\u2014one of them employing telepathy pure and simple andthe other telepathy as a stimulating and guiding influenceoperating oir material acquired by telsesthesia. Nothing is saidabout material already existing independently in the mind ofthe sensitive, but for the emergence of this also it is clear thattelepathic stimulation and guidance might be effectivelyemployed.\r\nThe next extract to be cited is from the D.I. of January 21,1912. It is in many respects a remai'kable and impressivepassage, but it is also a difficult one both in itself and in relationto previous statements. I think I shall best consult the con-venience of the reader by following up the text of the recordwith a paraphrase which will convey my own interpretationof it.\r\nExtract from D.I. of January 21, 1912. {Present, G. W. B.){G. Ik. B. You referred at a former sitting to telaesthesia asa process by which the mind of the sensitive acquired knowledgeon its own account. The subject came up in connection withwhat you call mutual selection. You spoke of taking thesensitive into a \u201c room \u201d and screening off any action of yourown mind on hers ; whereupon her subliminal proceeds to takestock of the contents of the room. Do you rneaii a real room,or only a room existing in your mind ?)\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s 31ediumship 243\r\nI\u2019ll throw something at you, and you must make what you\r\ncan of it.\r\nI\u2019ll take that portion of her which can emerge in uprush,\r\nand I, as it were, link it on with that deeper subliminal which\r\ncan be in touch with what I want to get known ; so that there\r\nis that portion of her which can normally accpiire telfesthetically\r\nin its own deep profound plane passing on the knowledge to\r\nthat plane from which an uprush can come. Oh, he says, what\r\nI\u2019m going to say to you now makes Sidgwick tear his hair,\r\nbecause it\u2019s meaning the Ocean in a child\u2019s bucket.\r\nI\u2019m going to call that deepest portion, nearer to the transcendental self\u2014I\u2019m going to call it\u2014anything you like, any\r\nsymbol, say H. Well, the H-self and I agree on what we want \u2014what I want\u2014to get transmitted, and which the H-self\r\nnormally, in its own H-ness, through its own cognitive faculties, can know. And here is the \u201c bucket \u201d process, it\u2019s here where\r\njust because it\u2019s the most difficult I shall fail worst in trying to\r\nget near the thought. The H-self will touch the uprushable\r\nself just the grade below the uprushable, and the uprushable\r\nand the grade below will receive the knowledge from the H.\r\nBut in putting it into the uprushable focus, as it were, it will know that a sort of crystallisation, often through symbolism,\r\nmust be arrived at ; and we will imagine, if you like, that that\r\nhaving been foreseen both by me and the H-self, we determined\r\nupon what sort of crystals to aim at, so that the uprushable\r\nself has, as it were, presented to it what I called a \u201c room \u201d,\r\nthe knowledge which the H-self is informing to the point where\r\nit becomes uprushable. Just below that uprushable point\r\nthere\u2019s a sort of dim moment where both modes enter into\r\ncognition\u2014I mean, where a knowledge of the thing as it is in\r\nthe H-stage is united to a knowledge of the crystals which,\r\nthe emblem which, can best express that which in its H-ness\r\ncannot, or rarely, uprush\u2014for all these states are variable and\r\nthe success variable. Then comes that moment of binding\r\nwhen the self that lies in juxtaposition to the uprushable\r\nabsorbs the knowledge from H, and passes it on to the uprushable point in such a state as makes uprush possible. It then\r\nrushes out as word spoken or written, or dreams, or never-tobe-denied moments of prescience, precognition of supernormal\r\nknowledge. But that supernorinal will contain within it the\r\n244 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship [part\r\nnormally acquired knowledge of H\u2014that element of normality\r\nwill be there. Oh, he says, that isn\u2019t the invariable method,\r\nonly one of them ; and he says. The telepathic impact is another . . .\r\nParaphrase of the above.\r\nIn answer to my question about the \u201c room \u201d Gurney distinguishes between different grades of the subliminal self. There is a deeper self which can telsesthetically acquire knowledge chrect from the communicating spirit of that which hewants to get known. There is another self on a less profoundplane to which the knowledge so acquired can be passed on, andthrough whose action it can emerge in uprusli\r\n.\r\nThere is also aself\u2014\u201c the self in juxtaposition to the uprushable \u201d\u2014which is intermediate between the other two. Let H stand for thedeeper self ; for the intermediate self ; and H2 for the selfwhich is immediately responsible for the emergence of themessage in written or spoken word. The communicator and Hagree upon what they want to get transmitted, H havingacquired knowledge of this through the faculty of telsesthetic\r\ncognition which is native to it in virtue of its H-ness. Whathappens next is admittedly difficult to explain, but it is something of this kind. Contact is effected in the first place betweenH and Hj, and later, through the mediation of Hi, between Hand Hj. The knowledge which H has acquired from the communicator is thus passed on to both and Ho, but not in theform in which it has been acquired by H. In that form it would be all but impossible for it to emerge. Some change musttake place analogous to crystallisation out of a state of fluidity.The individual crystals should be symbolic or emblematic of theknowledge acquired by H, but they are not the chrect expressionof that knowledge. Now it is possible for the necessary crystallisation to be brought about by concerted action between thecommunicator and H. They can decide what type of \u201c crystals \u201d are appropriate in the particular case. The crystallisation itself is effected in Hi,i with the result that H2 has presentedto it what had been called a \u201c room \u201d\u2014that is to say, a collection1 The paraphrase somewliat outruns the text at this point ; but what1 have added seemS to me a not unfair inference from other statements in\r\nthe record.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetf\u2019s Mediumship 245\r\nof \u201c crystals \u201d of a kind best fitted to express the knowledge\r\nacquired by H in a form in which it can he externalised. There\r\nis a dim moment when the original knowledge and its crystalhsed expression both enter into cognition together.\r\n\r\nFinally comes the \u201c binding \u201d, when, under the influence of\r\nthe communicator,^ H, H^, and H^ are linked up one with another.\r\nHi absorbs the knowledge from H and passes it on to Hg in\r\ncrystaUised form. It is then automatically externalised, and\r\nmay convey veridical messages, supernormal from the standpoint of the suprahminal self but embodying knowledge\r\nnormally acquired by H through the exercise of its teleesthetic\r\nfaculty.\r\nThis is only one among several methods ; chrect telepathic\r\nemission is another.\r\nBefore commenting on the substance of the statements in the\r\nextract quoted and paraphrased above, I should like to call\r\nattention to a pecuharity of style in it which I do not think can\r\nbe matched in any didactic pronouncement of similar length\r\nuttered through the voice in the whole of Mrs Willett\u2019s automatic productions. The writing stage that preceded the D.T.\r\nhad been comparatively short, but the sitting as a whole was\r\nan unusually long one, lasting nearly two hours. The passage\r\nwe are now considering came at the very end of it, and was\r\npreceded by discussions of a decidedly abstruse character which\r\nseem to have bewildered the sensitive and put a severe strain\r\nupon her attention. The record of these discussions abounds in\r\nthe familiar interjected phrases \u201c He says \u201c Oh he says \u201d,\r\nwhereas the long answer to my question aboiit the \u201c room \u201d is uniquely free from them. Just before I asked it Gurney had\r\naddressed a word of encouragement to the sensitive : \u201c He says,\r\nyou\u2019ve got it now, and he says. No bones broken\u2014and he says\r\nto me. You know, dear, I feel sometimes I must appear to you\r\nlike the Devil when he said Cast thyself down, but he says if only you\u2019ll go bhndly there\u2019ll be no pieces to pick up \u201d. I suggest that the advice to \u201cgo blindly \u201d was acted upon by the\r\nsensitive, and that the almost complete absence of the usual\r\ninterjections was due to her simply repeating each word as it came and not attempting to grasp the meaning sentence by\r\nsentence.\r\n^ Presumably in - See note 1 on opposite page.\r\n246 Psyclwlofjiral Aspects of Airs Willett's ATediumship [part\r\nAs regards the substance of the extract, the first question to\r\nbe asked is, Does it describe the same process as that to whichthe D.I.s of June 4 and October 8 refer, or a different one ? Theoccasion of Gurney\u2019s statement was my request to him to\r\nexplain the meaning of the term \u201c room \u201d, which he had used\r\nin the D. I . of October 8. His reply, couched in carefully chosen\r\nlangiiage, acknowledged his previous use of the term (\u201c what I called a room \u201d) ; and one would naturally suppose that in\r\nexplaining it he would have in mind the same process as that in\r\nconnection with which it had originally been employed. And in\r\nsome respects the process which he goes on to expound does\r\npresent the same family features which the two earlier descriptions of \u201c how some scripts are ])roduced \u201d had already madefamiliar. There is the choice of a theme, the telaesthetic acquisition of knowledge by the sensitive from the mind of the communicator, the period of incid^ation and subliminal activity, andfinally the automatic outpouring by writing or by voice. Butcloser examination reveals points of chft'erence which cannot be\r\nregarded either as unessential details or as mere elaboration of\r\nsomething previously indicated in outline.\r\n4\u2019he greater complexity of the process as a whole, arising\r\nfrom the recognition of tlii\u2019ee distinct \u201c grades \u201d in the subliminal of the antomatist and of the interaction between them,\r\nmight, indeed, be brought under the latter head ; for it may be\r\nplausibly contended that this very interaction constitutes the\r\n\u201c weaving \u201d spoken of in the D.I. of June 4 as a dangerous but\r\nnecessary operation. Similarly with respect to the so-called\r\n\u201c room \u201d common to both accounts : so long as we confine our\r\nattention to what is in the room there does not seem to be anyreal distinction between the appropriate \u201c objects \u201d of the\r\nearlier description and the a|)propriate \u201c symbols \u201d or \u201c emblems \u201d of the later. Gurney might with reason claim that in\r\nthe later account my question about the nature of the room wassufficiently answered. It is when we consider not the nature of\r\nthe room but (1) its relation to the actors concerned, and (2) the\r\nfaculty Ijy which its contents are apprehended, that we begin\r\nto realise how im])ossible it is to reconcile the two accounts\r\nexcept by treating them as applying to processes which, thoughkin to one another, are not identical.\r\nIn the D.I. of October 8 we are told that the communicator\r\n140] Psychological Asgjects of Mrs Willeffs Mediumship 247\r\ntakes the sensitive into the \u201c room \u201d and screens off tlie action\r\nof his own mind iipon hers. Her telsesthetic faculty thereupon\r\ncomes into play ; she takes stock of the room on her own\r\naccount, and makes her selection from the \u201c objects \u201d she\r\nperceives in it. Briefly, the room exists in the mind of the\r\ncommunicator and the sensitive acquires knowledge of its contents by telsesthesia.\r\nAccording to the D.I. of January 21, 1912, the general\r\ncharacter of the symbolic contents of the room is determined\r\nby agreement between the communicator and H, the deepest\r\nsubliminal self of the sensitive. But the room itself and the\r\nitems it contains come into existence in a second subliminal\r\nself (H^), and through it are \u201c j^resented \u201d to a third (H,). By\r\nwhat process the knowledge possessed by one self passes to\r\nanother we are not told ; but other passages in the scripts leave\r\nno doubt that the process is not to be understood as either\r\ntelaesthetic or telepathic. The part played by telsesthesia is confined to the initial stage of the whole operation, and in a\r\nlater script (see p. 253 below) the suggestion of telepathy\r\nbetween the supraliminal and subliminal selves is emphatically\r\nnegatived. In the view of the communicators telepathy\u2014and\r\nwe may safely assume telaesthesia also\u2014is confined to interaction between minds of individuals external to each other.\r\nBut this is a subject which will engage our attention in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\nOn the whole I am forced to the conclusion that in the D.I.\r\nof January 21, 1912, Giumey is expounding a variant of the\r\nprocess previously described, and doing this deliberately. Why\r\nne should have omitted to make this clear I cannot say ; but\r\nit is only fair to remember that in the D.I. of June 4 he warns\r\nus that the process he is there describing is only one of a great\r\nvariety, and that he himself has much to learn. \u201c We must\r\nexperiment, he says ; so much is unmapped.\u201d\r\nAmong other noteworthy points in the D.I. of January 21 is Gurney\u2019s frank confession of probable failure in his attempt to\r\nexplain how the telresthetically acquired knowledge of the\r\nH-self becomes transmuted into a form in which it can be\r\nexternalised. Whether the difficulty arises from a sense of\r\nimperfect understanding on his own part, or from an inherent\r\ninadequacy of language to express recondite psychic operations.\r\n24.S Psychological Asi'>ecfs of Mrs Willett's Meduimship [parthe does not say. The interpreter is, of course, bound to give asclear cut a rendering as he can of dark sayings in the scripts ; but it should not be forgotten that in attempting precision ofstatement he may end by being further from the real intentionof the communicator than if he had been content to observe ajudicious vagueness.\r\nIn the previous expositions of \u201c how some scripts are produced \u201d Gurney spoke of the subliminal as if it were a singleunsubdivided self, while chstinguishing it from the suprahminalor normal consciousness of the sensitive. It would be wrong tosay that different \u201c levels \u201d or \u201c strata \u201d of the subhminalitself were recognised for the first time in the present passage.Indeed the difficulty of conceiving the self as at once one andmany had afieady been raised by me, and had been a subject ofdiscussion in the earlier portion of this very sitting. To thatquestion I shall have to return in the next chapter. But toascribe the process of \u201c crystalhsation \u201d to the interaction ofthe different grades of the subliminal is, I think, new. Possibly,however, it is not so much new as now for the first time clearlystated.\r\nI have suggested above that the interaction of the differentgrades of the subhminal corresponds to the third stage in theprocess described in the D.I. of June 4\u2014namely that of \u201c weaving \u201d and \u201c sidjliminal activity \u201d. It is arguable that \u201c weaving \u201d and \u201c subliminal activity \u201d in that passage refer to interaction of the different grades within the subliminal, though it is also possible that the communicator is thinking of interactionbetween the subliminal as one whole and the supraliminal.The distinction is a real, but hardly a fundamental one. Weare elsewhere told that the supraliminal is, \u201c as it were, theupper crust of the subliminal \u201d, and that \u201c the interactionbetween the two is continuous \u201d, though \u201c the supraliminalconsciousness of the interaction varies \u201d.^ If the symbols H,Hj^, and be taken as representing three grades of the subliminal no very serious objection would seem to lie againstadding H3 to the series to represent the supraliminal, andextending the interpretation of \u201c weaving \u201d and \u201c subliminalactivity \u201d so as to include the interaction of all four grades ofthe self. This way of looking at the matter may helj3 to har-\u2018 See pp. 291-2 below.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 249\r\nmonise the accounts of the third stage in the process (that which\r\nimmechately precedes the uprush) given in the two D.I.s\r\nrespectively, though it would not remove the difficulties presented by the problem of the \u201c room\r\nIf the two accounts of this stage are really in essentials at one\r\nwith each other it follows that the result of the \u201c weaving \u201d,\r\nlike that of the crystallisation, must be to reduce to symbols\r\nand allusions the knowledge teleesthetically acquired by the\r\ndeeper subliminal self. Confirmation of this is furnished by a\r\nhint casually dropped in the sitting of May 24, 1911. \u201c T wish \u201d, says the commiuiicator, \u201c I could get you to understand\r\nthe thought that underlies the word \u2018 weaving \u2019. Symbolism is a dangerous weapon \u201d. Compare this with the statement in\r\nthe D.I. of June 4, about a fortnight later : \u201c He says, That\u2019s\r\nwhere the gamble comes in. How will it be used, the knowledge\r\nsupernormally gained ? Now then you have present in the\r\nwhole self the matter from which I selected plus the matter\r\nsupernormally acquired from me. Now comes the weaving.\r\nOh, he says, that\u2019s where subliminal activity conies in. Oh, he\r\nsays. It\u2019s a dangerous weapon, yet we can\u2019t do without it \u201d. The inevitable conclusion from a comparison of these two\r\npassages is that weaving results in symbolism, and that the\r\noperation is at once necessary and dangerous.\r\nWhy necessary, and why dangerous ? The answer to the\r\nfirst question is supplied by the D.I. of January 21, 1912.\r\nSymbolism is necessary because otherwise the message \u201c cannot \u2014or but rarely\u2014uprush \u201d and be externalised. The obstacle\r\npresumably lies in the supraliminal, which, if it understood the\r\ninner meaning of the message, might refuse to transmit it. But\r\nthis is one of many points on which more light would be wel- come. I think we have good ground for believing that in\r\ncertain cases the communicators themselves do not desire the\r\ninner meaning to be understood save by the investigators, who\r\nhave all the scripts before them and can piece the mosaic\r\ntogether\r\n.\r\nOn the other hand one can hardly donbt that conversion into\r\nsymbolic form is declared to be dangerous because it threatens\r\nthe integrity of the message. If a message received by direct\r\ntelepathic impact is liable to \u201c sophistication \u201d, how much\r\ngreater will be the risk in the case of a message which can only\r\n250 Psychological Aspects of 31rs Willetfs Mediumship [part\r\nemerge and reach its ultimate destination broken up into\r\nisolated parts and disguised as a collection of symbols andallusions. The necessity for symbolism we have to take on\r\ntrust ; its dangers are obvious.\r\nIf the process with which we have been lately deahng shows\r\nsome divergences from the type originally described, it is to\r\nthis earlier type that the statements contained in the twoscripts next to be considered seem more properly to apply. Thescri])ts in qiiestion are both trance-productions, consecutive in\r\npoint of date, and linked together by interesting connections\r\nof matter. What is new in them relates mainly to the final\r\nstage of the process\u2014that of externalisation. But both scripts\r\nhave something to say on the sid^ject of mutual selection, and\r\nthe second of the two gives illustrations of \u201c selected \u201d items\r\nl)y means of actual examples drawn from a recent lone script of\r\nthe disjointed type.

Oh, he says, Book I. i., of which only one line has been preserved\r\nto us. He says. In telepathy there is the mind that makes the\r\nemission of the idea, and the mind which receives the impact\r\nof it ; and it\u2019s often very definite, he says. And he says it\u2019s not the whole truth to say that inspiration is more general,\r\nbut it\u2019s the half truth to say that inspiration is the stimulation\r\nof something already contained in the subhminal which, under\r\npressure of inspiration, forces its way to the threshold. Oh,\r\nhe says. Inspiration may be from within as well as from without.\r\nBut he says you can\u2019t speak of telepathy between the supraliminal and the subhminal\r\n\r\n(G. W. B. Ah ! I was going to ask that very question.)\r\nbut you can speak of inspiration by the subliminal ; you\r\ncan also speak of inspiration by the subhminal of matter\u2014\r\nOh, he says to me.

L.]\r\n* * =!: For purposes of general comment it will be convenient to\r\ntake the two expository extracts (of March 5 and 13) as forminga single whole. My C\u00a3uestion about telepathy, insjDiration, andmutual selection refers back to the D.I. of June 4, 1911, in\r\nwhich telepathy, inspiration, and selection were described as a\r\n\u201c descending chain \u201d in the production of scripts of a certain\r\nclass. As the D.I. proceeded, the \u201c thoughts suggested bytelepathy and inspiration \u201d were deliberately \u201c ruled out \u201d for\r\nthe time being, though telepathy was later on briefly aUuded to\r\nas a \u201c guiding influence \u201d in the final stage of the process. The1 Conteinjiorary note by O. J. L. : \u201c \u2018 is \u2019 is underlined in the script, but\r\ntlie intention evidently was to erase it \u201d.\r\n- For comments on this passage see jip. 309-10.\r\n^ \u201c by sub 1 \u201d is probably equivalent to \u201cby which I mean the subliminal\u201d.\r\n' Possibly this may refer to the 2iassage \u201c Fears may be liars FEARSnot tears \u201d ; for here also Fears has been correctly written, and \u201c FEARSnot tears \u201d may be represented as addressed by the subliminal to a doubt\r\narising in the suju'aliminal.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship 257\r\nbulk of the D.I. was devoted to the subject of selection, with\r\nspecial insistence on its mutual character\u2014the communicator\r\nselecting from the mind of the sensitive, and the sensitive from\r\nthe mind of the communicator.\r\nThe extracts now before us are cliiefly concerned with the\r\ntopics passed over in the D.I. of June 4. Comparatively little\r\nis said in them about mutual selection, thoiigh the script of\r\nMarch 1 3 purports to contain actual examples both of selection\r\nby the communicator and of selection by the sensitive.\r\nGm-ney opens his exposition by teUing us that telepathy\r\nshades off into inspiration, and inspiration into mutual selection.\r\nBut he immediately qualifies this statement by describing it as a piece of bosh which he commends to the attention of Miss\r\nJohnson. I suppose he means by tliis that the statement,\r\nthough containing a measure of truth, is not reaUy illuminating.\r\nWhy he drags Miss Johnson in there is nothing to show, but\r\nI vaguely suspect that there is a reference here to her \u201c Third\r\nReport on Mrs HoUancTs Script \u201d, in Proceedings, vol. xxv.,\r\nwhich contained a section on \u201c The Principle of Selection in the\r\nProduction of Scripts \u201d. This paper had been sent to Mrs\r\nWillett on July 1, 1911.\r\nGurney had been challenged by my question to say what he\r\nmeant by a \u201c descending chain \u201d. Telepathy shading off into\r\ninspiration, and inspiration shading off into mutual selection, is,\r\nI tliink, intended as his answer\u2014but it is an answer which he\r\ndoes not press, and to which he seems to attach no particular\r\nimportance.\r\nThe statements that follow are somewhat confusing. When\r\nGurney lays it down that \u201c in telepathy there is the mind that\r\nmakes the emission of the idea, and the mind which receives\r\nthe impact of it, and it\u2019s often very definite \u201d, he is clearly\r\nthinking of a chrect telepathic communication from an emitting\r\nmind to a receiving mind of something that was not in the\r\nreceiving mind before. The appearance of the word Flaccus in\r\nthe disjointed script of February 16, 1912, is later on cited as an\r\nillustration of telepathy in this sense. On the other hand the\r\ncharacteristic note of inspiration is said to be that it operates\r\non material already contained in the subliminal and forces it to\r\nemerge. It becomes evident, however, as we proceed, that\r\ncertain forms of inspiration involve telepathy as an essential\r\n258 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partfactor in the process. One of these forms Gurney actuallydesignates as a \u201c process of telepathy \u201d, adding, however, that\u201c that particular process of telepathy I should designate asinspirational telepathy, because it\u2019s affecting what is akeady inthe mind The same process he refers to in another passageas \u201c inspiration\r\n\r\ni.e. stimulation by telepathic means of thatalready normally contained in the mind of the sensitive\r\nAt first reading there may seem to be a serious inconsistencyin these various statements, telepathy being at one momentsharply distinguished from inspiration, while at another thetwo are so far identified that it appears to be a matter ofindifference whether we speak of inspirational telepathy ortelepathic inspiration. But I doubt whether the inconsistencyis more than superficial. It must be remembered that Gurneyhad begun by remarking that there are as many varieties oftelepathy as there are of Imman beings. The variety oftelepathy which consists in the emission of a definite idea byone mind, and its reception by another which had not previouslycontained it, may be regarded as the most chstinctive andcharacteristic form of telepathy, hut it is not the only form.The telepathy which stimulates an idea already pre-existing inanother mind to emerge and externalise itself is a differentvariety ; and when the process takes this form it may be properly classed as inspiration. In passing from telepathy pureand simple to inspiration, we may be said to pass from a highervariety of telepathy to a lower. In passing from inspiration tomutual selection, we leave telepathy altogether and enter theprovince of telaesthesia\u2014using both of these terms in thepeculiar sense given to them in Willett scripts. It is thisaspect of the case, I think, that Gurney has in view when hetalks of telepathy shading off into inspiration, and inspirationshading off into mutual selection.\r\nLet us now consider somewhat more closely the statementsmade concerning inspiration.\r\nInspiration, it ai^pears, may either proceed from without,or, in other words, have its ultimate source in the communicator ; or it may proceed from within, in which case theinspiring agent is either the STibliminal operating on the supraliminal or one grade of the subliminal operating on another.Whether it proceed from without or from within, the material\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 259\r\non wliich it works may be the normally existing content of the\r\nmind of the sensitive, or such additional knowledge as she may\r\nhave acquired by selection.^\r\nI take first the case of inspiration from without. Two forms\r\nof this are specified, and it may be convenient that I should\r\nquote once more the important passage which describes and\r\ndistinguishes them : He says. Inspiration may be from within, but it may be\r\nfrom without. Oh he says. Every moment I gave to the study\r\nof hypnotic states and post-hypnotic states I feel was among\r\nthe best spent of all my time. Oh, he says. It\u2019s not only what\r\nI learnt then, but what I\u2019ve been able to apply here. For\r\ninstance ; Say, using the words in their rough way, that a mutual selection is made\u2014mutually from her mind and mine.\r\nIt\u2019s possible for me to suggest to her subliminal that at a given\r\ntime such and such an idea shall, as it were, be recovered\u2014one might almost say, recovered out of the sediment and come to\r\nthe top. Or I may use another process. I may hit a particular\r\natom in the sediment that I want by telepathic impact or\r\nstimulation, and make it come to the surface that way. But\r\nthat pai\u2019ticular process of telepathy I should designate as\r\ninspirational telepathy, because it\u2019s affectmg that which is already within the mind.\r\nThe first of the two forms of \u201c inspiration from without \u201d\r\nhere described possesses a special interest, because no mention\r\nof it\u2014certainly no explicit mention of it\u2014has been made before,\r\nand the account now given of it may help to explain a difficulty\r\nto which I called attention earlier in this chapter. When\r\ndiscussing the subject of mutual selection in my comments on\r\nthe D.I. of June 4, 1911, 1 raised a question respecting the stage\r\nat which selection by the commimicator from the mind of the\r\n^ In the extract from the trance-sitting of March 5, 1912, two examples\r\nare cited of selection by the communicator from the mind of the sensitive\r\n(\u201c Who shall praise thee the grave, etc.\u201d, and \u201d Blair, drawing by Blake \u201d)\r\nand three examples of selection by the sensitive from the mind of the communicator (\u201c Pleasant is the sim, etc.\u201d, \u201c put on immortality \u201d, and \u201c Light\r\nthat never was, etc.\u201d). These examples must be accepted for what he repre- sents them to be : at all events we are hardly in a position to criticise. But\r\nall five are at the same time examples of hispii'ation, the fu'st two of ins23U'a- tion from without and the last three presumably of inspiration from witliin.\r\n260 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship [paetsensitive comes into play. \u201c Selection by the communicator \u201d,\r\nI wrote, \u201c must certainly be supposed to occur in the final stageof the process, but may it not operate at an earher stage also ? \u201d ^ This seemed a natural inference from the language of the D.I.,\r\nbut it was not easy to see what effective purpose selection bythe commimicator could serve at a preparatory stage, unless, insome way left unexplained, the eventual emergence of theselected items was thereby promoted.\r\nThe passage I have just quoted appears to provide an answerto this difficulty. Selection by the communicator at a preparatory stage may be something more than selection. It may beselection plus the kind of suggestion which the hypnotisermakes to the hypnotised subject, and which the subject, afterwaking, automatically carries out. The two cases are not quiteon aU fours, for the hypnotiser uses normal methods of con-veying his suggestion whereas we must suppose the communicator to convey his suggestion telepathically. But in eithercase an appeal is made to the subhminal by an external agencyto bring about a certain effect not at the moment but after anagreed interval. Inspiration of this type belongs to what I havecalled the second stage of the process. We might describe it assuggestive inspiration.\r\nThe other form of inspiration from without is that for whichprevious scripts have already prepared us. The D.I. of June 4,\r\n1911, calls it \u201c telepathy as a guiding influence \u201d ; the D.I. ofOctober 8, 1911, speaks of it as a \u201c stimulus \u201d apphed by thecommmiicator whereby knowledge telaesthetically acquired bythe sensitive can be \u201c shepherded and guided up to the threshold of normal consciousness \u201d. These descriptions areobviously anticipations of the inspirational telepathy and telepathic inspiration of the trance -sittings of March 5 and March13, 1911.\r\nInspiration from without of this second type belongs to thefourth or final stage of the process\u2014that which immediatelyleads to externalisation. It should be clearly understood,however, that both types involve the employment of telepathyas an operative influence, though the mode of applying it\r\ndiffers in the two cases. Indeed the very phrase \u201c inspiration^ See p. 237 above.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WilleWs Mediumship 2G1\r\nfrom ivithout \u201d seems hardly consistent with any other interpretation.\r\nIs telepathy equally involved in inspiration from within ? Inspiration from within is inspiration by the subhminal, or by\r\nsome stratum of the subhminal, which plays the part corres- ponding to that of the commimicator in inspiration from\r\nwithout. Analogy suggests that here also telepathy enters as an essential element in the process. I was about to ask a\r\nquestion on the subject, which is one that has long had an\r\ninterest for me, when I was anticipated by Giumey. \u201c You\r\ncan\u2019t speak \u201d, he says, \u201c of telepathy between the suprahminal\r\nand the subliminal \u201d. This peremptory statement raises\r\nissues of great interest, about which I shall have more to say in\r\nthe next chapter. But the reader will readily see that it has an\r\nintimate connection vdth a fundamental difference of view\r\nbetween the communicators and myself respecting the nature\r\nof the subliminal and suprahminal selves and their relations to\r\neach other, to which he makes a humorous allusion towards the\r\nend of the trance-script of March 13 :\r\n. . . The telepathic impact has given to the larger self the\r\ncorrect soutid Flaccus\u2014the conscious self half cognises it and\r\ndreamily sees Tlaccus, but not until after it has been externalised, and externalised correctly. \u201c Tlaccus \u201d dreams the smaller\r\nself No that is wrong replies the larger self (yet they are not\r\n2 but 1 \u2014, put in for G.\u2019s benefit this He tried to get me on\r\nto the horns of a duality which would amount almost amount\r\nto a conception of the selves as separated in such a way as to\r\namount to 2 entities But I was not to be impaled)\r\n.\r\nHere also further discussion must be postjDoned until the next\r\nchapter. What we have immediately to consider is not the\r\nnatirre of the subhminal and suprahminal selves, but the part\r\nplayed by inspiration from within in the process of automatic\r\nproduction. Inspiration from within, whatever interpretation\r\nbe placed upon it, is at aU events a form of subliminal activity.\r\nIt is not, however, to be identified ^vith the subliminal activity\r\nassociated with the third stage of the process described in the\r\nD.I. of June 4, 1911. That activity, if I have understood the\r\nscripts rightly, was of a preparatory character, resulting in the\r\n\u201c weaving \u201d of material to be used in the fourth and final stage\r\n262 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part 140] \u2014the stage of externalisation. It is to this final stage that the\r\nactivity manifested in inspiration from within belongs. Weare forbidden to call it telepathic\u2014that term being held to be\r\napplicable only to inspiration from without. But if we look\r\nmerely to effects, and to the part played in automatic production\r\nby the two activities respectively, it is likely to be difficult, or even impossible, for the investigator to distinguish one from\r\nthe other.\r\nI may here refer back to a passage from the script of February9, 1911, already quoted on pp. 230-1 above.\r\nTliey [be. the scripts in question] were allusive. You must\r\nget through a good bulk of matter to get in what you want\r\nsaid from our standpoint. They are not witlioiit threads of\r\nconnection. But listen. Those threads extend also in subliminal of autornatist. Thus if I would say fire I Gurney\r\nmight make an allusion to Phoebus or Zoroaster Her subliminal\r\nmay conceivably go one better and shove in Salamander\r\n(0. J. L. Yes, well, that is what we rather expected, that\r\nsubliminal activity was mixed with your intention.)\r\n. . . Woven strands Pick out the gold thread.\r\nIn the supposed case \u201c Salamander \u201d would be a contribution\r\ninspired from within, though a harmless one and in consonance\r\nwith the general tenor of the message inspired from without, or conveyed by direct telepathic impact from tlie communicator.But the injunction to \u201c pick out the gold thread \u201d is an admission that the subliminal activity which inspires from withiii\r\nmay on occasion be not harmless but misleachng. I am afraid\r\nwe must go even further and frankly concede that the wholeof any given production may be the work of subliminal activity,\r\nunless the contents of the message are sitch as to afford satisfactory evidence of an external origin. But on this subject\r\nI have already said enough in Chapter V. of Part I. (see p. 153\r\nabove).\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nSUPRALIMINAL AND SUBLIMINAL, AND MYERS\u2019S\r\nDOCTRINE OF THE SOUL\r\nThe supraliminal \u201d and \u201c the subliminal \u201d are terms so engrained in the literature of psychical research that it would\r\nbe impossible to dispense with them in any discussion of\r\nmediumistic productions. Most of all would this be impossible\r\nin the case of a study of communications professing to come\r\nfrom Myers and Gurney, and rejoroducing\u2014though, as we have\r\nseen, with considerable modifications\u2014the teachings of Human\r\nPersonality\r\n.\r\nAt the same time, as the reader is aware, I am not\r\nsatisfied with the doctrine of the subliminal and supraliminal\r\nselves set forth in that monumental work and cannot but feel\r\nthat Myers\u2019s treatment of the subject has tended to make a\r\nperplexing problem more perplexing still. He extends the\r\nmeaning of the term \u201c subliminal \u201d, which was originally\r\npurely adjectival, to denote a substantive psychic entity\r\ncapable of interacting with the supraliminal ; and yet this same\r\nsupraliminal (man\u2019s normal consciousness) he ends by treating\r\nas notlung more than a \u201c phase \u201d of the subliminal, or even a\r\nfaculty exercised by it. I do not hide from myself that the\r\nconstant use of Myers\u2019s terminology throughout this paper,\r\nwhile aU the time my conception of the structure of human\r\npersonality differed from his, has greatly increased the difficulties\r\nof exposition, and also, I fear, the difficulties of the reader in\r\nfollowing the argument.\r\nIf ten intelligent persons were severally set to give an account\r\nof the doctrines of Human Personality concerning \u201c the supraliminal \u201d, \u201c the subliminal \u201d. and the \u201c soul \u201d, which Myers\r\nheld to be the persisting and immortal element in man, I doubt\r\nwhether any two of them would be found to agree in all their\r\nconclusions. But as part of my present task is to compare the\r\nteaching of Human Personality regarding these subjects with\r\nthe statements contained in Willett scripts, I must do my best\r\n263\r\n264 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Alediumship [partto provide a version of Myers\u2019s views adequate for my purpose,and expressed, as far as possible, in his own words. This will beaccompanied by a running commentary designed to mark thedivergence between what I understand to be Myers\u2019s ideas andmy own.\r\nI regard each man, [writes Myers ^], as at once profoundlyunitary and almost infinitely composite, as inheriting fromearthly ancestors a multiplex and \u201c colonial \u201d organism\u2014polyzoic and perhaps polypsychic in an extreme degree ; but also as ruling and unifying that organism by a soul or spirit absolutelybeyond our present analysis\u2014a soul which has originated in a spiritual or metetherial environment, which even whileembodied subsists in that environment ; and which will still subsist therein after the body\u2019s decay.\r\nApart from the somewhat hesitating phrase \u201c polyzoic andperhaps polypsychic \u201d this passage might be regarded as beingconcerned wholly with the problem of the relation of mind tobody. So conceived Myers treats the problem as unsolved andperhaps insoluble.\r\nIt is, of course, impossible for us, [he continues], to picture\r\nto ourselves the way in which the individual life of each cell of the body is reconciled with the unity of the central life which controls the body as a whole. But this difficulty is notcreated or intensified by the hypothesis of a separate andpersistent soul. On no hypothesis can we really understandthe collaboration and the subordination of the cell-lives of anymulticellular animal. It is as mysterious in the star-fish as\r\nit is in Plato.\r\nConsistently with these views the problem of mind and bodyoccupies in Human Personality a comparatively subordinateplace. Myers\u2019s doctrine is, indeed, essentially interactional,leaving no room for the rival doctrines of parallelism andepiphenomenaUsm ; and this is also the standpoint of theWillett scripts, explicitly maintained in the D.I. of May 11,\r\n1912\u2014the one and only sitting devoted to the subject\u2014alreadyquoted in an earlier chapter.- But this was not the questionthat mainly interested him, and to the problem of mind and^ 4\/.P., vol. i., p. 34. ^ See p. 135 above.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Meduimship 265\r\nbody I shall not need, save incidentally, to refer again. The\r\nreal centre of interest, alike in Human Personality and in the\r\nWillett scripts, lies in the domain of mind.\r\nNo writer has insisted more strongly than Myers on the co- existence of diverse apparently independent streams of consciousness in the make-up of each man\u2019s personality. It was\r\nwith reference to these independent streams of consciousness,\r\nand not to the relation of mind to body, that he gave a new\r\nsignificance to the term subliminal. The passage in which this\r\nnew significance is explained is so important that I feel hound\r\nto quote it in fulfil\r\nThe idea of a threshold {limen, Schwelle) of consciousness ;\r\n\r\nof a level above which sensation or thought must rise before\r\nit can enter into our conscious life ; \u2014is a simple and familiar\r\none. The word subliminal, \u2014meamng \u201c beneath that threshold \u201d, has already been used to define those sensations which\r\nare too feeble to be individually recognised. I propose to\r\nextend the meaning of the term, so as to make it cover all that\r\ntakes place beneath the ordinary threshold, or say, if preferred,\r\noutside the ordinary margin of consciousness ; \u2014not only those\r\nfaint stimulations whose very faintness keeps them submerged,\r\nbut much else which psychology as yet scarcely recognises ; sensations, thoughts, emotions, which may be strong, definite,\r\nand independent, but which, by the original constitution of our being, seldom emerge into that supraliminal current of\r\nconsciousness which we habitually identify with ourselves.\r\nPerceiving (as this book will try to show) that these submerged\r\nthoughts and emotions possess the characteristics which we\r\nassociate with conscious life, I feel bound to speak of a subliminal\r\nor ultra-marginal consciousness,\u2014a consciousness which we\r\nshall see, for instance, uttering or writing sentences quite as complex and coherent as the supraliminal consciousness could\r\nmake them. Perceiving further that this conscious life beneath\r\nthe threshold or beyond the margin seems to be no discontinuous\r\nor intermittent thhig ; that not only are these isolated subliminal processes comparable with isolated supraliminal processes\r\n(as when a problem is solved by some unknown procedure in a dream), but that there also is a continuous subliminal chain\r\ns\r\n1 H.P., vol. i., p. 14.\r\n260 Psychological Aspects of Airs Willetts Alediimiship [partof inemoiy (or inore chains than one) involving just that kindof individual and ]iersistent revival of old impressions, andresponse to new ones, which we commonly call a self,\u2014I findit permissible and convenient to speak of subliminal selves, ormore briefly of a subliminal self. I do not indeed by using thisterm assume that there are two correlative and parallel selvesexisting always within each of us. Rather I mean by thesubliminal self that part of the self which is commonly subliminal ; and I conceive that there may be,\u2014not only co-operations between these quasi- independent trains of thought,\r\nhut also upli^avals and alternations of personality of manykinds, so that what was once l)elow the surface may for a time,or permanently, rise above it. And I conceive also that noself of which we can here have cognisance is in reahty morethan a fi'agment of a larger self,\u2014revealed in a fashion at onceshifting and limited through an organism not so framed as toafford it full manifestation.\r\nThe idea of a number of selves associated simultaneouslywith the same organism, appears at first sight so difficult toreconcile with any unitary view of the nature of personality,that I can well believe that Myers must have hesitated longbefore definitely committing himself to it. In the end heaccepted it whole-heartedly as one of the foundation-stones ofhis sjiecrdation. The ])ossibility of sejjarate and independentInit contem])oraneous streams of memory and perception in oneand the same individual became with him a\r\n\u201c root-conception\r\nwhich he has pculiaps done more than any other man to makefamiliar. The series of masterly chapters in which he worksout the application of the conception to the phenomena ofgenius, slee]), hypnosis, sensory and motor automatism, andmediumship, will be for ever memorable in the history of thesidpect.\r\nBut another fundamental conviction to which Myers tenaciously clings is that man\u2019s personality not only appears to be,but truly is, in some sense, unitary. The question is, In whatsense ? The two extreme views concerning the nature of the selfMyers illustrates by cpiotations from the writings of Reid andof Ribot respectively.^ According to Reid \u201cit is impossible1 H.P., vol. i., p. 249. 2 H.P., vol. i., p. 10.\r\n140] Pftycholoqical Asi^ects of Mrs WiJletfsMecU'imisJdp 267\r\nthat a person should be in part the same and in part different,\r\nbecause a person is a monad and is not divisible into parts\r\n\u201d\r\nAccording to Ribot \u201c the self is a co-ordination. It oscillates\r\nbetween two extremes, at each of which it ceases to exist ; absolute unity and absolute incoherence\r\nThe problem which Myers set himself is \u201c the reconcilement\r\nof the two opposing systems in a profounder synthesis It\r\nwas a notable attempt. But to me, at least, the solution he\r\noffers us is untenable, and cannot be made to cover all the\r\nphenomena which he sets out to explain and harmonise.\r\nOur psychical unity [he tells us is federative and unstable ;\r\nit has arisen from irregular accretions in the remote past ; it consists even now only in the hmited collaboration of multiple\r\ngroups. These discontinuities and incoherences in the ego the\r\nolder psychologists managed to ignore. Yet infancy, idiocy,\r\nsleep, insanity, decay\u2014these breaks and stagnancies in the\r\nconscious stream were always present to show us, even more\r\nforcibly than delicate analyses show us now, that the first obvious conception of man\u2019s continuous and unitary personality was wholly insecure ; and that if indeed a soul inspired the\r\nbody, that soul must be sought for far beneath those bodily\r\nconditions by which its self-manifestation was clouded and\r\nobscured.\r\nI venture to think that the \u201c breaks and stagnancies in the\r\nconscious stream \u201d were no less obvious to \u201c the older psychologists \u201d than to Myers liimself. They would have regarded\r\nthem as successive changes in the content of the ego ; and so long as the sense of identity was maintained notwithstanding\r\nthe changes, they would have found no insuperable difficulty in\r\nfitting them into their conception of the ego as a \u201c monad\r\nThey would also have recognised that these changes were\r\nintimately connected with bodily conditions ; and so far as the\r\nrelations of mind and body were concerned, some of them, at\r\nleast, might have been ready to accept Myers\u2019s conception of\r\nan immortal soul ruling and unifying the organism with which\r\nit is associated.\r\nWhat never occurred to these earlier thinkers was the\r\npossibility that there might be co-existent and contemporaneous\r\n- H.P., vol. i., p. 16.\r\n268 Psychological Aspects of Mrs WiUettis Mediumship [partstreams of consciousness in the same person, each with thecharacteristics of a \u201cself\u201d, and so far independent of eachother as to he xmconscious of each other\u2019s action, or even toengage in a conflict of wills and in acts of mutual hostility. Hadthey become convinced by evidence that this state of thingswas not merely a possibility but a fact, it would still have beenopen to them to cling to their conception of a monadic ego, evenwhile driven to admit that there might be more than one egoassociated with the same organism. Myers recognises theexistence of co -conscious selves associated with the sameorganism, but does not deem this incompatible with a truepsychical unity, of which these selves are aspects or phases.\r\nTo those passages in the extracts ah\u2019eady quoted which bearupon this question I will add yet one inore : ^\r\nIn favour of the partisans of the unity of the ego, the effectof the new evidence is to raise their claim to a far higherground, and to substantiate it for the first time with thestrongest presixmptive proof which can be imagined for it ;\r\na jxroof, namely, that the ego can and does survive\u2014not onlythe minor disintegrations which affect it during earth-life\u2014butthe crowning disintegration of bodily death. In view of thisimhoped-for ratification of their highest dream, they may bemore than content to surrender as untenable the far narrowerconception of the unitary self which was all that \u201c commonsense philosophies \u201d had ventured to claim. The \u201c consciousself \u201d of each of us, as we call it,\u2014the empirical, the supraliminal self, as I should prefer to say\u2014does not comprise thewhole of the consciousness or of the faculty within us. Thereexists a yet more comprehensive consciousness, a profounderfaculty, which for the most part remains potential only so faras regards the life of earth, but from which the consciousnessand the faculty of earth-life are mere selections, and whichreasserts itself in its plenitude after the liberating change ofdeath.\r\nLet me now try to sum up in a series of propositions thevarious statements concerning the nature of the soul made inthe foregoing passages.\r\n(1) The soul is a spiritual entity which existed before its' H.F., vo\\. i., pp. 11, 12.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Medimnship 269\r\nassociation with the body, and will continue to exist\r\nafter that association has been dissolved by bodily\r\ndeath.\r\n(2) In its hberated condition the soul is unanalysable by us,\r\nbut is in communion with the spiritual or metetherial\r\nworld. Even in its embodied life commimion with the\r\nspiritual world, though hampered and limited, is not\r\nwholly lost.\r\n(3) The soul is essentially distinct from the bodily organism\r\nwhich it rules and unifies. How it rules and unifies the\r\nbodily organism is wholly unknown to us.\r\n(4) As regards the diverse streams of consciousness sufficiently\r\nindependent of each other to merit the description of\r\n\u201c selves \u201d, which experience shows can exist contemporaneoUsly in the individual man, the soul is not a mere agent of unification of these lesser selves, but is\r\nitself their unity. It is the whole of which they are\r\nparts.\r\nIf we seek to place a definite meaning upon the last of these\r\npropositions, it is evidently essential to come to a clear understanding of what we mean by a\r\n\u201c self \u201d. Strange to say, Myers\r\nnever seems to have undertaken a systematic examination into\r\nthe question here raised. When he speaks of the soul as a\r\nself, and when he applies the same term to \u201c the continuous\r\nsubhminal chain of memory (or more chains than one) involving\r\njust that persistent revival of old impressions, and response to\r\nnew ones, which we commonly call a \u2018 self\u2019 \u201d, is he using the\r\nterm in the same sense in both cases ? If he is, then he ought\r\nto regard the independent streams of consciousness as self- conscious egos, aware of their continuing identity, and of their\r\ndistinction from other self-conscious egos, and from the bodily\r\norganism with which they are associated. If, on the other hand,\r\nhe is using the term self in different senses in the two cases, this\r\nshould have been made abundantly clear and the nature of the\r\ndifferenee carefully defined. As a matter of fact he seems to me\r\nto waver between two incompatible points of view. Sometimes\r\nhe appears to regard the independent currents of consciousness\r\nas genuine psychic entities with all the attribirtes of a self- conseious being ; at other times as merely different activities or states of such a being. The two conceptions remain unre-\r\n270 Psycliological Asjyects of Mrs WUleti's Mecliumship [partconciled ; and 1 doubt whether Myers ever sufficiently recognised the incongruity between them. Yet the distinction is surely fundamental. Except in a metaphorical sense the different activities of a self-conscious being have no more right to thetitle of \u201c selves \u201d than have the unattended \u201c thoughts withouta thinker \u201d of a very different school of psychologists.\r\nIf the \u201c selves \u201d referred to in proposition (4) are to be takenas real psychical entities or egos, the doctrine of the soldenunciated in it would bear a strong family resemblance toFechner\u2019s theory of the compounding of consciousness. In theform of the theory maintained by Fechner the unity resultingfrom the comjiounding of consciousness is nothing but thecomponents themselves, although nevertheless each componentretains its separate individuality inside the unity. The theoryof the compounding of consciousnesses presents formidablelogical difficulties ; for how can co-conscious egos be at thesame time one and the same ego ? Notwithstanding thesedifficulties Fechner\u2019s idea had a strong attraction for no less athinker than William James ; and it is interesting to note thatJames himself has called attention to the connection betweenthe Fechnerian doctrine and the phenomena studied bypsychical research.^ But if at any time Myers\u2019s speculations onthe structure of human ])ersonality lieckoned him in the direction of a mystic interpretation on the lines of a comjiounchng ofconsciousnesses, such an interpretation certainly did not represent his fully considered views.\r\nI do not think any of the statements concerning the soul madein the introductory chapter to Human Personality carry usmuch beyond the four propositions enumerated above. Butin Chapter VI. a new development of the doctrine introducesus to that part of it which is most characteristic of its author.\u201c The subliminal \u201d, which hitherto has been treated as only apart or fragment of a larger whole, is now identihed with thatwhole itself ; in other words, with the soul.\r\nMyers himself is fully alive to the signilicance of the steji thustaken, as the opening words of Chapter VI. bear witness ; ^\r\nWe have now reached [he writes] a central node in ourcomplex argument. Several lines of evidence, already pursued,^ Lectures on a Pluralistic Universe, p. 315. ^ H.F., vol. i., p. 220.\r\n140 ] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WillettA Medmmship 271\r\nconverge liere to form the starting-point for a new departure.\r\nOur view of the subliminal self must pass in this chapter\r\nthrough a profound transition. The glimpses which we have\r\ntill now obtained of it have shown it as something incidental,\r\nsubordinate, fragmentary. But henceforth it will gradually assume the character of something persistent, principal,\r\nunitary ; appearing at last as the deepest and most permanent\r\nrepresentative of man\u2019s true being.\r\nTo the forir previous propositions, therefoi\u2019e, we can now add\r\na fifth :\r\n(5) The soul and the subliminal are one.\u2019^ Again, a couple of pages later we read : By ordinary psychology, supraliminal life is accepted as representing the normal or substantive personahty, of which\r\nsubliminal life is the semi-conscious substratum, or halfilluminated fringe, or the morbid excrescence. I, on the other\r\nhand, regard supraliminal life merely as a privileged case of\r\npersonality ; a special phase of our personality, which is easiest\r\nfor us to study, because it is simplified for us by our ready\r\nconsciousness of what is going on in it ; yet which is by no means necessarily either central or prepotent, could we see our whole being in comprehensive view.\r\nNow if we regard the whole supraliminal personality as a\r\nspecial case of something much more extensive, it follows that\r\nwe must similarly regard all human faculty, and each sense\r\nseverally, as mere special or privileged cases of some more\r\ngeneral power.\r\nAll human terrene faculty will be in this view simply a\r\nselection from faculty existing in the metetherial world ; such\r\npart of that antecedent, even if not individualised, faculty as may be expressible through each several human organism.\r\n1 If all the five propositions be read together it would seem to result that\r\nthe subliminal is at once a part of the whole, and also the whole itself. I cannot\r\nrecall that Myers has anywhere given a clear and authoritative explanation\r\nof this apparent paradox. ]More than one exjilanation might perhaps be\r\nattempted. Nevertheless I suspect there is confusion of thought here. The\r\ndifficulty is, I think, only the old one of conceiving how co-conscious selves can at the same time be one and the same self. Fechner\u2019s solution I can\r\nonly describe as frankly mystical. Myers seems to me to end V)y ignoring\r\nthe problem, and to be hardly aware that any difficulty exists.\r\n272 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumshi'p [partThese passages seem definitely to negative the idea of personality as comprising independent co-conscious streams ofmentality, each with the characteristic of a true self. The\u201c selves \u201d, although still called selves, have become \u201c phases \u201dof a single self. In coming down so distinctly on the Unitarianside of the controversy, it was more than ever incumbent onMyers to explain how the independent currents of consciousnesscan appear to have the characteristics of selves without beingtrue selves. This he has not done. I cannot but hold that inneglecting to deal with this difficulty he has failed to give usthat \u201c profounder synthesis \u201d of conflicting views which he set\r\nout to provide. The problem of reconciling unity and pluralityis not solved by practically denying plurality, or by disguisingit in the form of layers or strata of a single unitary self. Whatis more, the conception of a plurality of selves within the personality persistently refuses to be suppressed or ignored. It\r\ncontinues to assert itself all through the book, and is, I believe,\r\nforced upon us by much of the very evidence which Myershimself has so laboriously collected. Let me cite one passageout of the many that would equally serve to illustrate the jDoint ; ^\r\nThese splits of personality seem occasionally to destroy all sympathy between the normal individual and a divergent\r\nfraction. No great sympathy was felt by Leonie II. for Leonie I. And Dr Morton Prince\u2019s case shows us in the deepest and ablest\r\nof the personalities of his \u201c Miss Beauchamp \u201d positively spiteful\r\nin its relation to her main identity.\r\nBizarre though a house thus divided against itself may seem,\r\nthe moral dissidence is merely an exaggeration of the moral\r\ndiscontinuity already observable in the typical case of MrsNewnham. There the secondary intelligence was merely tricky,\r\nnot malevolent. But its trickiness was wholly alien from MrsNewnham\u2019s character,\u2014was something, indeed, which she\r\nwould have energetically repudiated.\r\nIt seems, therefore,\u2014and the analogy of dreams points in\r\nthis direction also,\u2014that our moral nature is as easily split\r\nup as our intellectual nature, and that we camiot be any moi'e\r\ncertain that the minor current of personality which is diverted\r\ninto some new channel will retain inoral than that it will retain\r\nintellectual coherence.\r\n' See H.P., vol. ii., p. l\u2018J9.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willeff's Medimnship 273\r\nIn spite of the disparaging remarks which Myers in this\r\npassage bestows on the secondary personahties in the cases of\r\nMiss Beauchamp and of Mrs Newnham, it is nevertheless of the\r\nessence of the \u201c new departime \u201d to exalt the sidjliminal at the\r\nexpense of the supraliminal consciousness.\r\nThere are times when the doctrine which identifies the true\r\nself of a man with the subliminal seems in Myers\u2019s hands to\r\nimply no more than a broad claim that the capacity of the\r\nhuman mind is manifested at its highest and best in communion\r\nwith the spiritual world. But at other times his language goes\r\nfar beyond this, and presents us with the picture of a mind\r\ndivided, as it were, into compartments each with a distinct\r\nconsciousness and memory of its own. Intercourse with the\r\nworld of the senses is assigned to the supraliminal compartment,\r\nintercourse with the metetherial to the subliminal. Based upon\r\na conception of this kind the identification of man\u2019s true self\r\nwith his subliminal self appears to me as a paradox which even\r\nMyers\u2019s literary skill and fervour of conviction have failed to\r\nmake plausible. It coidd not for a moment be maintained if the separate currents of mentality were interpreted as being\r\ngenuinely distinct selves. The true self of a man could not in\r\nthat case be other than the self of which he has direct and\r\nimmediate knowledge. But even when I do my best to place\r\nmyself at Myers\u2019s point of view, and try to conceive co-conscious\r\nintelligences as \u201c phases \u201d of a single self-conscious ego, I altogether fail to see why this single self-conscious ego is to be\r\nidentified with the subliminal self (or selves) rather than with\r\nthe supraliminal self which both common sense and orthodox\r\npsychology treat as the true self of a man. We are asked to\r\nbelieve that our true self is a self the very existence of which the\r\nvast majority of mankind have never even suspected. The\r\nmain evidence for its existence is derived from the phenomena\r\nof abnormal psychology, and in particular from the comparatively rare occasions when the subliminal ceases to be subliminal,\r\nand \u201c messages \u201d pass from it, in some way which we shall\r\npresently have to consider, into supraliminal consciousness.\r\nWhen this happens what takes place ? If the subliminal\r\n\u201c phase \u201d of a man\u2019s consciousness represented his true self, we\r\nmight actually expect that, on ceasing to be subliminal, it would absorb into itself the supralimina] phase, and the two\r\n274 Psychological Aspects of M7's Willett's Mediumship [partjjhases would be as one self. But the facts point quite the otherway.\r\nWhen the subliminal ceases to be subliminal and manifestsitself to the supraliminal, we have what is called dissociation ofthe personality. Dissociation implies at least duality wherepreviously there has been every appearance of unity. Whatmay be the relation of the dissociated elements before and afterdissociation is a very obsciire problem which offers a wide field\r\nto conjecture and speculation. The continued existence of thesidjliminal, at times when it is subliminal, may be a plausibleinference from the observed phenomena, but ex vi termini thesupraliminal can have no direct experience of it. All we canaffirm with certainty is that at such times the supraliminalconsciousness appears to itself to be in solitary possession.Dining dissociation, on the other hand, the supraliminalrecognises the presence of an agency which it distinguishes fromitself ; but it does not lose its sense of personal identity overand against that agency. The sense of personal identity persists alike through the normal and the abnormal state. ^ It is true that in extreme cases of alternations of personality thenormal consciousness may seem to be dispossessed altogether.But this is not, in my view at least, to be interpreted as amerging into unity of one phase of consciousness in another, butrather as the temporary replacement in control of the organismof one self by another self. In an earlier chapter ^ on dissociation of the personahty I have given an account of an interesting experience that befelMrs Willett in which her normal self seemed to develop into aduality of independent selves, or \u201c minds \u201d as she calls them,\r\none of the two minds being \u201c me as I know myself\u201d, and theother a mind which she somehow connects with herself, but at^ Tlie jihenomenon of cli.ssociation may also be considered from tlie other\r\n.side, that is to say, from the side of tlie hitherto subliminal self which has\r\nnow, by reason of dissociation, ceased to be subliminal in the adjectival sense, and is ajiprehendcd by the supraliminal as an independent communicatingagency. Does the subliminal self, when thus made manifest to the supraliminal consciousness, claim identity with that consciousness ? On the contrary, we find the secondary self insisting on its separate individuality, evento the j)oint of claiming\u2014falsely, if it is in truth only a secondary self\u2014to\r\nl)e a genuinely external communicator.\r\n^ See pp. 143 If.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediimisliip 275\r\nthe same time distinguishes from the \u201c me as I know myself\r\nPresently the two minds seemed to \u201c hash into one, and I at once knew what I was to do \u201d, The meaning of this I take to\r\nbe that what the other mind willed her to do had now become\r\npart of her own will. But whatever interpretation we place\r\nupon the two minds \u201c flashing into one \u201d, it is clear that in the\r\nresult it is the supraliminal that remains in possession of the\r\nfleld, while the subliminal subsides into subliminality.\r\nMy own instinctive conviction is that my true self is the\r\n\u201c me as I know myself \u201d, and that it will be as this me, with its formed character and stored memories, that I shall survive, if survival there be. Other selves co-conscious with \u201c me as I know myself\u201d may also survive. If so, it is permissible to\r\nhazard a guess that as they have ajjparently co-operated when\r\nin the body, so they, or some of them, may continue to co- operate when no longer in the body, and that each of us may\r\nAnd himself in the \u201c metetherial \u201d world the member of a group\r\nof selves with which he has already, when in the body, been\r\nassociated in closer relation than with the rest of his environment. But here we enter a region where no verification is possible.\r\nI do not propose to dwell at length on the objections that may\r\nbe urged against Myers\u2019s theory in connection with the separate\r\nmemories of the minor selves (or self-like elements) within the\r\npersonahty ^\r\n; nor, again, on the difficulties inevitably suggested\r\nby his frank admission that the subliminal is a rubbish heap as\r\n1 To overcome the difficulties arising out of the separateness of tlie memory\r\nchains of the minor selves it would be necessary to assume that the subliminal,\r\nas identified with the soul, not merely has access to the memories of the\r\nsupraliminal, but appropriates them as memories of its own : otherwise it would not be the \u201c I as I know myself \u201d that sui'vives, but another personality\r\naltogether. This is hard to reconcile with Myers\u2019s \u201c root-conception \u201d (see\r\np. 266 above) of the dissociability of the self as \u201c the possibility that different fractions of the personality can act so far independently of each other that\r\nthe one is not conscious of the other\u2019s action \u201d. It is also, I think, inconsistent\r\nwith the observed facts in certain cases of multiple personality. See on this subject McDougall\u2019s Outline of Abnormal Psychology, p. .542 : \u201c We find repeatedly that, when one iDersonality obtains command of the memoi'ies of another, he distinguishes between his own memories and those of that other. And when a co-consoious personality is aware of the thoughts and feelings\r\nof the other, it is not that for the time being the two personalities become\r\nmerged in one common stream of thinking. Rather the co-conscious per-\r\n276 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediiimship [partwell as a treasure house. ^ These objections and difficulties I do,\r\nindeed, regard as fatal to his peculiar conception of the subliminal as representing the true unitary self in man, and the\r\npersisting element in him which survives the dissolution of the\r\nbody. But I pass them by and proceed to enquire why, in the\r\nface of so many obvious considerations, Myers still adheres to\r\nthat conception, and makes it in fact the central feature of his\r\nwhole system.\r\nThe explanation is not, I think, far to seek. It lies in Myers\u2019s\r\nfirm conviction, ah\u2019eady referred to, that direct (i.e. telepathic)\r\ncommunion between individual minds represents the highest\r\nactivity of which the soul is capable, and that the exercise of\r\nthat activity is strictly the prerogative of the subhminal. I maysay at once that I should hold the latter view to be unproved,\r\neven on his own hypothesis of a unitary soul divided into\r\nsupraliminal and subliminal compartments. Yet it is notaltogether surprising that Myers should have been attracted to\r\nit. There could be no doubt that many of the most remarkablecases of supernormal phenomena recorded in Proceedings of the\r\nS.P.R. have been accompanied by dissociation. Might not\r\ndissociation, and the subliminal activity implied in dissociation,\r\nbe the indispensable condition of such phenomena, and not\r\nmerely incidental concomitants of their occurrence ? It is true that supernormal manifestations occur also when the\r\npercipient is to all appearance in a perfectly normal condition.\r\nBut it is always possible to suppose that in these cases too there\r\nhas been some measure of dissociation, even though so slight as to pass unnoticed. On that assumption may we not further\r\nsuppose that the actual recipient of the telepathic message is the subliminal self, and that it is through the subliminal self,\r\nand not directly, that the supraliminal self becomes aware of\r\nit ? One step farther and we reach the position definitely taken\r\nup by Myers that supernormal powers are the exclusive prerogative of the subliminal, and that the subliminal alone is\r\nsonality reports the exjDeriences of the other as something of whicli he becomes\r\naware as experiences foreign to himself ; he knows wliat the other thinks\r\nand feels, but he has also his own thoughts and feelings about the same\r\nobject or topic \u201d.\r\n1 H.P., vol. i., p. 72i It was to this feature in Myers\u2019s conception of the\r\nsubliminal that William .Tames took the strongest exception. See his review\r\nof Human Personality in Proceedings, vol. xviii., p. 32.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Alediumship 277\r\nequipped to share in the free eommunion with a spiritual world\r\nwhich awaits the surviving soul.\r\nI cannot, of course, say that it was iJrecisely by these steps\r\nthat Myers arrived at his conclusion. But he ended by formulating it quite exphcitly. In the Scheme of Vital Faculty,\r\nwhich forms an Appendix to Chapter IX. in vol. ii. of Human\r\nPersonality, he distinguishes between\r\nI. The supraliminal, or empirical, consciousness ; aware only\r\nof the material world through sensory impressions ; II. The subliminal consciousness ; obscurely aware of the\r\ntranscendental world through telepatliic and telsesthetic impressions ; III. The subliminal consciousness, discerning and influenced\r\nby disembodied spirits in a spiritual world.\r\nThe distinction between II. and III. is unimportant in the\r\npresent connection : the really important dividing hne is between the supraliminal and the subliminal\u2014that is to say,\r\nbetween I. on the one side and II. and III. taken together on\r\nthe other. It is to be noted that the principle on which the\r\nchviding line is here drawn rests upon the possession or nonpossession of supernormal powers. Where, however, the\r\npossession or non-possession of such powers by the supraliminal\r\nis the very point at issue, it is clear that a deflnition of this kind\r\ngives no help towards deciding the question of fact. A disputed\r\ndefinition is not an argument.\r\nI do not suppose that Myers himself would claim to have\r\nproduced proof that the suprahminal, the \u2018\u2018 I as I know myself \u201d\r\nis incapable of acting or being acted on telepathically. He\r\nseems to take this for granted, as something almost self- evident. ^ Self-evident it certainly is not. I can discover no\r\n^ See, however, H.P., vol. i., p. 97 : \u201c One characteristic of the subliminal\r\nin my view is that it is in closer relation than the supraliminal to the spiritual\r\nworld \u201d. This would seem to be a tacit admission that the supraliminal may\r\nbe to some extent in relation with the spiritual world. Cf. also vol. ii., p. 237,\r\nwhere, in comparing the case of Mrs Piper with that of Stainton Moses or Hiune he represents one of the points of difference as consisting in the fact that her supraliminal self shows no traces of any supernormal faculty whatever . Tills ought to mean that some trace of supernormal faculty was\r\ndiscernible in the case of the other two. But this was not his usual attitude. Thus in vol. ii., p. 124, he speaks of \u201c that region of supernormal knowledge\r\nwhich for the supraliminal is so definitely closed \u201d,\r\n27<S Psychological Asjiecfs of Mrs Willeff's Mediumship [parta 2\r\n)i'iori connection between subliniinality and supranormalfaculty, (iiven the fact of telepathic intercourse between onemind and another, 1 shmdd have thought it simpler and saferto start by assuming that whatever partakes of the nature ofmind is likely to ])artake in some degree, however slight, oftele])athic sensibility. If any difference in this respect is foundin practice between the two selves, it would seem easy toascribe it to the greater freedom from sensory impressions whichthe subliminal may in general be supposed to enjoy in comparison with the supraliminal.^\r\nDirect proof of the capacity of the supraliminal to receivetelepathic impressions is, I admit, not easy, perhaps notpossible, to secure. The successful results which have beenobtained in telepathic experiments with subjects apparently in a normal condition, though not without weight as prima facieevidence, are not conclusive, because the alternative explanation, which attributes them to subliminal receptivity in thefirst instance, cannot be summarily dismissed. The messagesreceived by Mrs Willett in her silent D.I.s and lone scripts, evenif we acce])t them as coming from sources outside herself, fall short of proof for the same reason. Yet it may fairly be contended, and is indeed obvious, thatthis alternative explanation itself affords presinnptive evidencethat the supraliminal is at least not restricted to sensoryimpressions, but can receive mental impressions also, albeit\r\nonly through the mediation of the siibliminal.^ Nay, more :\r\n^ Note, liowever, that Myers does not liesitate on occasion to ascribe keener\r\nsensory percejjtion to the subliminal than to the supraliminal. See, for instance, H.F., vol. ii., p. 10.5.-\r\n- Cf. H.P., vol. ii., p. 5.50. \" Even as the .subliminal self can present visual\r\nor auditory phantasms for supraliminal observation ; even as the humanagent, acting telepathically, can present\u2014still tlmough subliminal agency\r\nhis own ])hantasmal aj)2)earance for the jjercijjient to recognise, so can the\r\n.sjjirit \u201d. . . . \u201c The .spirit is here acting concui\u2019rently with the suju'aliminal\r\nintelligence, just as the subliminal intelligence has already done \u201d. The\r\nlast sentence might seem to imjjly that the departed sjjirit, when producing\r\na jihantasmal aj^jjearauce of itself, acts directly on the supraliminal. If so,\r\nit must be taken as an unguarded statement, which does not represent Myers\u2019s\r\nreal view. What I imagine he meant is that, in the case sujjjjosed, two\r\nconsciousnesses are concurrently active, that of the spirit and that of the\r\nsupraliminal self which continues to be aware of its normal environment.\r\nHis theory requhes, in order to account for the ijhenomenon, the addition\r\n140] Psijchological Aspects of Airs Willett's Mediumship 279\r\nhave we any good ground for placing the process of coinnninication between the subliminal and the supraliminal on a\r\ndifferent footing, qua process, from that which in admitted cases of supernormal communication between individuals we describe as telepathic ? Both jirocesses are mental ; can we make\r\nany valid distinction between them so far as the modus operandi\r\nis concerned 1 Whatever answer be given to this question, it is common\r\nground to both sides of the controversy that \u201c messages \u201d can\r\npass from one mental element of the personality\u2014whatever\r\ninterpretation we give to the term \u201c element \u201d\u2014to another.\r\nFurther, it is common ground that it is often exceedingly\r\ndifficult, in fact impossible, to distinguish between messages\r\npassing from a subliminal to a supraliminal mental element and\r\nmessages passing supernormally from the mind of one man to\r\nthat of another, or from a discarnate to an incarnate mind.^\r\nWhere the effects are indistinguishable there is a presumption, though of course no certainty, that the causes also are\r\nsimilar in other words, that if the process is telepathic in one\r\ncase, it is also telepathic in the other.\r\nThis, as the reader knows, is the view that commends itself\r\nof a third consciousness, namely tliat of the subliminal self, which receives\r\nthe message from the spirit telepathically, and passes it on to the supraliminal by some process which is assumed to be ?iot telepathic, although\r\nits nature is otherwise very obscurely indicated.\r\n1 Cf. H.P., vol. 11 ., p. 88, where, with references to the automatisms which\r\nhe classes together as \u201c message-bearing or nunciative automatisms \u201d, Myers\r\nremarks, \u201c I do not, of course, mean that they all of them bring messages\r\nfrom sources external to the automatist\u2019s o^vn mind. In some eases they\r\nprobably do this ; but as a rule the so-called messages seem more probably\r\nto originate within the automatist\u2019s own personality. Why, then, it may be\r\nasked, do I call them messages ? We do not usually speak of a man as sending\r\na message to himself. The answer to tliis question involves, as we shah\r\npresently see, the profoundest conception of these automatisms to which we can as yet attain. They present themselves to us as messages communicated from one stratum to another stratum of the same jiersonality \u201d. Compare also the important statement in H.P., vol. ii., p. 198, which,\r\nalthough primarily applying to possession, must be held to be no less applicable\r\nto the case of \u201c nunciative \u201d automatisms. It must be borne in mind that,\r\nin Myers\u2019s view, an organism can be \u201c possessed \u201d by its own subliminah\r\nand that he regards possession by an external spirit to be telepathy carried\r\nto the pomt where it ceases to be telepathy and becomes direct control of the organism. See pp. 174-5 above.\r\n280 Psychological Aspects of Airs Willett's Alediumship [partto me. Once, at least, in Human Personality Myers himselfseems to come near it. In vol. ii., pp. 5-6, he writes :\r\nWherever there is hallucination, whether delusive or veridical,\r\nI hold that a message of some sort is forcing its way upwardsfrom one stratum of personality to another,\u2014a message whichmay be merely dreamlike and incoherent, or which may symbohse a fact otherwise unreachalile by the percipient personality.\r\nAnd the mechanism seems much the same whether the message\u2019s\r\npath be continued withhi one individual or pass between two ; whether A\u2019s owm submerged self be signalling to his emergentself, or B be telepathically stimulating the hidden fountains of\r\nperception in A.\r\nWhen quoting this passage in my presidential address in\r\n1906 I expressed some surprise that the hint contained in it oftelepathic action between the two selves within one individualwas not further followed up by Myers. Closer study of thewhole subject has, however, convinced me that, without thesurrender of some of liis most cherished doctrines, it would havebeen impossible for him to accept telepathy as a true accountof the process by which messages are conveyed from one mentalelement within the personality to another.\r\nIn order to avoid the use of clumsy periphrases let us describe\r\ncommunication which passes from one mental element withinthe personality to another by the term interior, and communication which passes supernormally from one individual to\r\nanother by the term exterior. \u201c Exterior \u201d communication bycommon consent we describe as telepathic. Is \u201c interior \u201d communication also telepathic, and if not, what is the natureof the process by which it takes place ? Interior telepathy, if accepted as a fact, would, of comse, be\r\nin flat contradiction to the doctrine that telepatliic faculty is confined to the subliminal. But its implications do not endthere. Telepathy is so clearly identified in Human Personality\r\nwith the process of communication between distinct psychicalentities that to accept the idea of interior telepathy would bein effect equivalent to recognising the mental elements associated together in the individual man as being such distinct\r\npsychical entities. We are thus once more brought up before\r\nthe old question concerning the selfhood of the independent\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Merliutnship 2Sl\r\nciirrents of consciousness that are somehow combined in one and the same individual human being. Are these independent\r\ncurrents true selves, or are they phases, fragments, layers, strata,\r\nof one and the same unitary self ? Interior telepathy interpreted as a process of communication\r\nbetween distinct psychical entities or true selves is incompatible\r\nwith Myers\u2019s doctrine of the soul as the all-embracing unity of\r\nthe mental elements of the personality. It is incompatible with\r\nthe conception of the mental elements themselves as merely\r\ndifferent manifestations or aspects of the soul\u2019s activity. It is equally incompatible, I think, with the doctrine that identifies\r\nman\u2019s true self with his subliminal self. The idea of interior\r\ntelepathy must surely have occurred to Myers. I have little doubt that his rejection of it was deliberate, and that he himself\r\nmust have felt it to be inconsistent vdth other parts of his\r\nteaching.\r\nMyers recognises interior communication as a mental process,\r\nbut treats it as a mental process of a different kind from telepathy. This is clearly brought out in a footnote to a passage\r\nimmediately following the one just quoted :\r\nSome word is much needed to express communication\r\nbetween one state and another, e.g. between the somnambulic\r\nand the waking .state, or, in hypnotism, the cataleptic and the\r\nsomnambulic, etc. The word \u201c methectic \u201d (\/\/ede\/cr(\/fo?) seems\r\nto me the mo.st suitable, especially since nede^i<; happens to\r\nbe the word u.sed by Plato {Farm., 132 b) for participation\r\nbetween ideas and concrete objects. Or the word \u201c inter-state \u201d\r\nmight be pressed into this new duty.\r\nIn this footnote Myers proposes the term methexis for what\r\nI have called above interior communication. Interior communication is, in his view, always methectic, never telepathic. If\r\nI am asked whether, in my view, interior communication is always telepathic, my answer must be, Yes, if the selves between,\r\nivhom communication takes place are true selves. But at this\r\npoint the controversy once more resolves itself into the original\r\ndifference of opinion concerning the nature of the mental\r\nelements between which the interaction takes place. Those\r\nwho hold the mental elements to be true selves will inevitably\r\ntake the further step and treat communication between them as\r\n282 PsychoJogiral Asjoecfs of Mrs Willett's Medmmship [parttelepathic. Those who hold them to be phases, strata, or\r\n\u201c states \u201d of a single unitary self will naturally and rightly seek\r\nfor some other term to describe the passage of thought fromone to the other. But if thus stripped of the attributes of true\r\nselfhood, can the mental elements continue to furnish the key to\r\nthe obscure phenomena of abnormal psychology which Myersbelieved himself to possess in his conception of supraliminal andsidjliminal selves ? My own reply to this qiiestion can only bein the negative.\r\nThere is one further observation which I should like to add.\r\nAccepting the reality both of interior and of exterior communication, I have noted the practical difficulty\u2014fully admitted byMyers himself\u2014of deciding to which of the two classes a givencase should properly be assigned. Assume now, for the sake ofargument, what I believe is still the doctrine of \u201c orthodox \u201d\r\npsychology, that there is no such thing as exterior communication ; that is to say that there is no telepathic communication either between living individuals or between incarnate anddiscarnate spirits, and that the jihenomena which have led to\r\nthe hv])othesis of such communication are in fact to be explaineil as cases of interior communication. With this assumption we shall have altogether banished telepathy in the sense in\r\nwhich Myers uses the term. But the problem of the apparentlyindependent origin of the \u201c messages \u201d has thereby become notless blit more insistent than before. For the readiest explanation of some, at all events, of these messages is to attribute\r\nthem to the activity of external agents incarnate or discarnate.\r\nIf this explanation is summarily excluded\u2014if all \u201c nunciativeautomatisms \u201d are, in Myers\u2019s phrase, messages \u201c sent by a man to himself \u201d\u2014the hypothesis that would ascribe them to\r\ninteraction between different phases or states of a imitary soul\r\nwould surely be strained to the breaking point. From this\r\n])oint of view I think the idea of a plurality of selves or centres\r\nof conscio\\isness associated together in the same body, cajDable\r\nof interacting with each other in such a way as to constitute the\r\nreahty and not merely the appearance of indej^endent agency,\r\nis one which should lie seriously considered even by orthodoxpsychology. It is right, however, to point out that, with this\r\nnew conception, telepathy, or something barely to be distinguished from it, would be reinstated in the form of interior\r\n140] Psychological Asjiecfs of 3Irs Willeti' s Medmmsliip 283\r\ncommunication although rejected in the form of exterior\r\ncommunication\r\n.\r\nAlthough there is a good deal in my presidential address of\r\n1906 which I should wish to modify, or at least to express in\r\nother words, if I were writing to-day, I nevertheless venture to\r\nquote one passage from it that gives an outline sketch of the\r\nstructure of human personality as I conceive it, which, in spite\r\nof gaps left unfilled and problems left unsolved, I stiU prefer\r\nto the picture drawn by Myers ; On the view which I have tentatively outhned it is possible,\r\nI think, to frame a more definite conception of the different\r\nfactors that unite to form the individual human being, and of\r\nthe relations between them, than I, at all events, have been\r\nable to derive from Myers\u2019s account of the supraliminal and\r\nsubliminal selves.\r\nEvery psychical centre associated with the organism would,\r\nin accordance with this view, have to be regarded as \u201c subliminal \u201d ^ to every other, though indeed it might be better to\r\ndrop that term altogether in describing the relation as I conceive\r\nit. The self of which we are each of us conscious is neither the\r\norganism as a whole nor any grouping of psychical centres\r\nwithin the organism. It is a single mind or soul whose conscious\r\nstates at any given moment are the expression of its reaction\r\nagainst its entire environment. What is its environment ? In the larger sense (and this must not be forgotten in considering the question of siirvival after the dissolution of the\r\norganism), its environment is nothing less than the whole umverse other than itself. In the narrower sense its environment is the physical orgamsm and every psychical centre\r\nassociated therewith. The presupposition of a plurality of real\r\nexistences, coupled with the observed facts as to the concurrent\r\nactivity of different streams of consciousness withm a single\r\norganism, has thus inevitably brought us in sight of the idea\r\nfirst put forward by Leibnitz, that the living creature is a kind\r\nof hierarchy of monads arranged in orderly and systematic\r\nrelations with each other, each reflecting in its own way the\r\n' I.e. in the sense in which Myers uses the word when he tells us that by\r\nthe subliminal self he means \u201c that part of the self which is commonly\r\nsubliminal See the passage from H.P., quoted on p. 266 above.\r\n284 Psycholofiical As'pecfs of Mrs Willett' s Meclinmship [partstates of consciousness of all the rest. Only whereas Leibnitzdenied all real interaction between the monads and sought to\r\naccoimt for the apparent interaction by his famous doctrine of\r\npre-established harmony, we have assumed throughout thatthe interaction is real, and conjectured that in part at least it might be of essentially the same character as that which, as between distinct living organisms, we call telepathic.\r\nAny further observations I have to make concerning theinteraction of the mental elements which contribute to thepersonahty of the individual man may with advantage bedeferred until the reader has been placed in a position to compare the statements in Willett scripts relating to the subjectsdealt with in the present chapter with the summary I haveattempted to give of Myers\u2019s teaching on the same subject in\r\nHuman Personality.\r\nA good many of the extracts which follow have ah\u2019eady beenquoted in various preceding chapters. Here, as elsewhere, for reasons already explained on p. 211 above, I have not hesitatedto repeat quotations where it seemed to me that the convenienceof the reader would best be consulted by doing so. The extractsin the present case have been arranged with due regard tochronological order, but not too rigidly to permit of departurefrom that order for the sake of bringing related passages intojuxtaposition, or for other good cause.\r\nI will begin with two passages which conform closely toMyers\u2019s doctrine of the soul, representing it as a spiritual entitythat existed before its association with the body, and will\r\nsurvive bochly destruction, but which, even during its embodiedlife, can be in touch with its original native element, namely themetetherial world as ojDjiosed to the world of matter. Statedthus broadly, the doctrine is reproduced, and, I think, consistently adhered to throughout the Willett scripts.\r\nCompare the following passages :\r\nExtract from, Lone Scrij)t of Apf'il 9, 1909.\r\nDescent into generation primarily the response of mind to\r\nmind\u2014add the thought of Myers mind precipitated as it wereinto mattei' through matter to manifestation l)eginning in tiie almost pure material material form the gradual dawning or\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Medinmslii'p 285\r\nrecollection of its native element mind all being but a means\r\nto this end the return enriched and enhanced to the metetherial\r\nMyers mind to mind descent through matter liberation by\r\ndegrees from the mere material form of earhest days gradual\r\nrepenetration into the realm of mind and eventual self projection into that realm.\r\nExtract from.

Nevertheless this distinction\r\nis quite exphcit in Willett script from the very beginning, as the\r\nfollowing extracts show :\r\nExtract from Lone Script of January 31, 1909.\r\nThe reason why you get messages at times upon subjects that\r\nyou have been pondering on is that you have so pondered by\r\ntelepathic impulse and it is the identical impulse that leads to\r\nthese scripts this often leads to things being attributed to the\r\nsubhminal but I have so far not devised anything to remedy this.\r\nExtract from Lone Script of February 14, 1909.\r\nI am trying experiments with you to make you hear without\r\nwriting therefore as it is I Myers who do this dehberately do\r\nnot fear or wince when words enter your consciousness or subsequently when such words are in the script.

The latter, as we have seen, is the doctrine ofHuman Personality ; and I think it must also be accepted asthe doctrine of the Willett scripts.\r\nIn Mrs Willett\u2019s case the two stages in the process by whichmessages from an independent mind are received and externahsed are represented as being either gradual and extendingover a period of time, or practically simultaneous and issuingin an immediate effect.\r\nExtract frotn the Lone Script of A ugust 14, 1910.\r\n. . . realise continually that impressions are as it weresoaking in at times when you are unaware of any receptiveimpulse the uprush from the threshold of one strata [sic] tothe other is the moment of conscious reception but the impressions have been accumulating on the other strata unknownto you.\r\nExtract from the D.I. of SepAember 24, 1910. {Present, 0.

If the jrrocess consists\r\nin \u201c submerging the supraliminal \u201d, how is this effected ? If by direct tele- patliie action, telejiathie sensitivity on the jrart of tlie supraliminal wouldseem to be conceded, though elsewhere denied. Are we to understand that\r\nhere also the communicatoi' only acts on the supraliminal indirectly, i.e. mediately througli the agency of the subliminal ?\r\n140] Psyclioloyical Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediurnship 289\r\n1911, that the sensitive \u201c remains the totality of herself I impress her by thoughts It is she who uses the nerve \u201d, should\r\nbe carefully noted. Hitherto the structure of the self as at once\r\nunitary and composite had been quietly assumed, and no suggestion had been made that this conception presents any kind\r\nof difficulty or problem. The emphatic assurance now given\r\nthat throughout the process the sensitive remains the totahty\r\nof herself, and that \u201c herself \u201d includes both subliminal and\r\nsupraliminal, gives perhaps for the first time in the scripts, a\r\nhint of the possibility that this assumption is open to question.\r\nUp to this point the statements made by the communicators\r\ncall for little general comment. They suggest no substantial\r\ndeviations from the teachings contained in Human Personality.\r\nIn the important series of trance -scripts and D.I.s starting from\r\nthe sitting of June 4, 1911, and mainly devoted to the subject\r\nof process, the question of the structure of the personality is brought more explicitly to the front and several new ideas are introduced which seem to be something more than mere amphfications of Myers\u2019s teaching, and even, at least in the use of\r\ncertain technical terms, to be inconsistent with it. In the two preceding chapters I have dealt with the topic of\r\ntelepathy, interpreted as the active communication of thought ; with teleesthesia, interpreted as mind-reacUng ; with \u201c mutual\r\nselection \u201d, presupposing a kind of reciprocal teleesthesia ; with\r\nsubhminal \u201c weaving \u201d, involving, at least in certain cases, the\r\ndividing up of the subliminal into a plurality of \u201c selves \u201d\r\ninteracting with each other and with the supraliminal. All\r\nthese topics have some connection, and the last of them a very\r\ndirect connection, with the subject-matter of the present\r\nchapter. I shall, however, take it for granted that the reader\r\nis acquainted with the general contents of Chapters II. and III.\r\nand for my present purpose will concentrate upon the three\r\ntrance-sittings of October 8, 1911, January 21, 1912, and\r\nMarch 5, 1912\u2014the only sittings at which the more controversial points at issue are brought into conspicuous prominence.\r\nAt all these sittings I was present as investigator in charge.\r\nThe relevant passages in them are here quoted practically in\r\nextenso. This will entail the inclusion of several more or less\r\nlengthy extracts, with which the reader has already been made\r\nacquainted ; but I think he will agree with me that in the\r\n290 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [paetpresent instance, at all events, the advantages of repetitionoutweigh the drawbacks.\r\nFrom, the Trance-sitting of October 8, 1911, beginning withScript and passing on to D.I. {Present G.

When the communicator identifies the miconscious mind of the sensitive witli her subliminal, it is presumably\r\nin this sense that he uses the word. But the adjective \u201c imconseious \u201d in this connection is apt to be misleading. It is not the subliminal which is unconscious, but the supraliminal in regard to tlie subliminal. The subliminal\r\nis conceived as comprising all mental process which does not reach the level\r\nof consciousness in the supraliyninal. Neither the Myers of Human Personality nor the communicators in the Willett scripts mean to represent the subliminal\r\nself as unconscious on its own account. On the contrary it is common ground\r\nfor both that in the subliminal the highest manifestation of mind is to be\r\nfound.\r\nThe interpretation of the passage which follows, down to \u201c tentacles of the star-fish \u201d, is far from clear. By \u201c centres of consciousness \u201d I had meant\r\n\u201cselves \u201d ; but Gurney\u2019s answer seems to refer to the relation between mind\r\nand body, and even to identify \u201c centres of consciousness \u201d with the organs\r\nof sense. Are the centres of consciousness which are described as \u201c grouped\r\nround one nucleus \u201d, from which they are distmguishable, the same as the\r\n\u201c centres of cognition \u201d wliich are compared to the tentacles of a star-fish,\r\nand also the same as the centres of sub-conscious7iess which are said, a little lower dowm, to inform a central whole ?

Yes, Gurney, those were splemlid papers of yours.)\r\nOh he says. It\u2019s not only what I learnt then, but what I\u2019ve\r\nbeen able to apply here. For instance : Say, using the words\r\nin their rough way, that a mutual selection is made\u2014mutually\r\nfrom her mind and mine. It\u2019s possible for me to suggest to\r\nher sidjliminal that at a given time such and such an idea shall as it were be recovered\u2014one might almost say, recovered out\r\nof the sediment\u2014and come to the top. Or I may use another\r\nprocess. I may hit a particular atom in the sediment that I\r\nwant by telepathic impact or stimulation, and make it cometo the surface that way. But that particular process of tele- pathy I should designate as \u201c inspirational \u201d telepathy, because\r\nit\u2019s affecting that which is already within the mind.\r\nOh, he says, I think I have done enough for to-day.\r\nThough in parts obscure and occasionally (I suspect) confused, the scripts just quoted\u2014to whatever source w^e attribute\r\nthem\u2014must surely count among the most remarkable automatic utterances on abstract questions that we possess. On this\r\naspect of the sidjject I r efer back to what I have already said in\r\nChapter V. of Part 1. (see p. 155 above). If the scripts in\r\nquestion are the product, not of inspiration from an external\r\ninteUigence, but of subliminal mentation, I am driven to the\r\nconclusion that the subliminal in this instance has exhibited a\r\nsubtlety of speculative thought very decidedly beyond anything I believe the Mr-s Willett with whom I am intimately\r\nacquainted to be capable of. Mrs Willett herself, to whoirr the\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumsliip 301\r\ntrance-productions have now been shown for the first time,\r\nassures me that they are \u201c so much Greek to her, and leave\r\nher utterly bewildered and bored.\r\nIt is not, however, with the source of these scripts that I am\r\nhere concerned, but with their content. The statements made\r\nin them, so far as they relate to the sid^ject matter of the\r\npresent chapter, can be usefully disentangled so as to fall under\r\ntwo headings :\r\n( 1 ) Statements regarchng the supraliminal and the subliminal\r\nin the incarnate ;\r\n(2) Statements regarding the transcendental self, and the\r\nrelation of the soul to the Absolute.\r\nThe matters treated of under the second heachng may be\r\nconveniently taken first. They are really of an order so purely\r\nspeciilative as hardly to come within the scope of the present\r\npaper. Nevertheless, a brief reference to them is desirable here,\r\npartly because comparison with corresponcUng ideas in Human\r\nPersonality has an interest for us ; partly because the account\r\ngiven of the soul in its relation to the Absolute throws some\r\nlight on the cpiestion which more propeily concerns us, namely\r\nthe conception to be found in the scripts of the relation of\r\nsupraliminal and subliminal in the incarnate personality.\r\nThe term \u201c transcendental \u201d is repeatedly used in the fragments pieced together by the editors of Human Personality ^ to\r\nform the concluding portion of Chapter IX. of that work, and,\r\nso far as my observation goes, nowhere else in the body of the\r\nbook. The use of the term in Willett automatic productions is practically confined to the scripts of October 8, 1911, and\r\nJanuary 21, 1912, and even there it occurs only in the combination, \u201c The transcendental self This phrase is common both\r\nto the scripts in question and to the concluding portion of\r\nChapter IX., and provides a link between them which is perhaps\r\nnot without significance.\r\nIf Mrs Willett had read the concluding portion of Chapter\r\nIX., it would be reasonable to infer that her scripts of October 1,\r\n1911, and January 21, 1912, owe something of their content to\r\nthat eircumstance. But her acquaintanee with Human Per-\r\n* See Editorial Note to the Preface in H.P., vol. i., p. x.

She assures me that to the best of her\r\nknowledge she has never so much as held a copy of the larger\r\nwork in her hand. Now in the abridged version the concludingportion of Chapter IX. is so severely cut down that the seven- teen or eighteen pages which it occupies in the original are reduced to less than three, and in those three pages the word\u201c transcendental \u201d does not once appear. It does, however,once occur in the Syriopsis of a Scheme of Vital Faculty,\r\nwhich forms Appendix A to Chapter IX., and which is includedin the abridged version. Even there there is no mention of the\u201ctranscendental self\u201d, only of the \u201ctranscendental world\u201d.On the other hand, it is just in the concluding sections of Chapter IX. that Myers gives the freest rein to his speculation, andthey must certainly be held to express his most fully developedideas on the subject with which they deal. If the Willett\r\nscripts are messages from an external somce, and that sourceMyers himself (or Gurney speaking for the pair there wouldbe nothing surprising in his employment, when communicating,of a term which he had already begun to use in his latest\r\nwritings.\r\nIn Human Personality \u201c the transcendental self \u201d is contrastedwith \u201cthe empirical self\u201d ; and this conjunction recalls thedistinction between the transcendental ego and the empiricalego, with which we are famihar in Kantian phraseology. Thesimilarity, however, is only verbal. For Kant the transcendental ego has a significance purely epistemological. It is theidentical self as the necessary conchtion of experience, whereasthe empirical self is the self with its serial content or successionof mental states.\r\nIn Human Personality, on the other hand, the adjective\u201c transcendental \u201d is synonymous with \u201c spiritual \u201d or \u201c metetherial \u201d, as in the phrase, \u201c transcendental world \u201d, \u201c transcendental mode of perception \u201d, \u201c transcendental faculty \u201d,\r\n^ Cf. lone script of January 5, 1911, \u201c This is all one message from 2 men.Sometimes the signature is F that means that I am here But rarely without\r\nhim \u201d {i.e. Gurney.) Whether the actual communicator is Gurney or Myersseems to depend mainly on the sitter. With O. J. L. as sitter, it is usually\r\nMyers ; with me as sitter, it is almost invariably Gurney.

One\u2019s first impression is that something of the same kind has happened in the case of the transcendental self ; and in a measure this is true.\r\nThe transcendental self of the scripts is not the same as the\r\ntranscendental self of Human Personality. The latter, as I have\r\nsaid, is the subliminal as opposed to the suprahminal in the\r\nincarnate. The former \u201c is the ulterior pre-existing pre-subhminal in something of the same sense as the subhminal is presupraliminal \u201d. As such it may fairly be described as the\r\nsubhminal in the discarnate, and \u201c the subliminal of the subhminal \u201d in the incarnate.\r\nIt is clear that what we are offered in the scripts is an analysis\r\nof the soul into grades or degrees of spirituahty.\r\nIn the incarnate these grades are\r\n(1) the suprahminal ;\r\n(2) the subhminal ;\r\n(3) the transcendental self.\r\nIn the discarnate all three grades are stiU present, but some\r\nelements characteristic of the suprahminal consciousness in the\r\nincarnate have, if my interpretation is correct, disappeared,\r\nwhile the remainder have become \u201c blended \u201d with what was\r\nthe incarnate subhminal to form what we may, if we please,\r\nregard as a discarnate suprahminal. The transcendental self\r\nwill then, by analogy, represent the discarnate subhminal.\r\nThis account of the transcendental self cannot be whohy\r\nreconciled with the use of the term in Human Personality, but\r\nthe discrepancy does not appear to me to be fundamental. It\r\n* A \u201c vital percentage \u201d of supraliminal elements (see D.I. of October 8th,\r\n1911) is presumably held to be retained by the discarnate spirit in order to accoimt for the memories which it continues to possess of its earthly life, and\r\nalso, perhaps, for some power of perceiving material tilings. But there is no\r\ndistinct statement to this effect in the scripts.\r\n304 Psychologiml Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship [pahtmust be remem})erecl that Myers himself treats the subliminalas consisting of strata, or layers, of chfferent depths, and in this\r\nhe is followed by the scripts. \u201c Ranges of different depths \u201d is the description of it in the D.I., January 21, 1912, and in thesame D.I. Ginney refers to \u201c the profundities of the subliminalwhich grade right up and merge into what I\u2019ve spoken of as thetranscendental self\u201d. It might be plausibly contended thatthe transcendental self of the scripts is merely a special namefor the deepest of a number of strata in the subliminal, and thatthe transcendental self of Human Personality includes thisstratum as j^art of itself. I think, however, that the differencebetween the two goes somewhat beyond this. In distinguishingthe transcendental self from the subliminal the scripts certainlymean to imply a difference of degree that has passed into adifference of kind, analogous to the difference between subliminal and supraliminal.^ In what does the chfference of kindconsist ? No clear answer is provided in the scripts. Butmaterial for an answer is, I think, to be found in the Synopsisprefixed to the \u201c Scheme of Vital Faculty \u201d (H.P., vol. ii.,\r\np. 505), to which I have already had occasion to refer earlier inthe present chapter (see p. 277 above). We are there presentedwith a threefold division of consciousness into (1) the supraliminal or empirical consciousness aware only of the materialworld through sensory impressions ; (2) the subliminal consciousness obscurely aware of the transcendental world throughtelepathic and teleesthetic impressions ; and (3) the subliminalconsciousness discerning and influenced by disembodied spiritsin a spiritual world. When I had this triple division previouslyunder consideration I passed over the distinction (2) and (3) asiinimportant in connection with the subject under discussion atthe moment. What I have now to suggest is that the \u201c s\\ibliminal consciousness discerning and influenced by disembodiedspirits in a spiritual world \u201d at once corresponds to and explainsthe transcendental self of the scripts. It is the name that is new rather than the distinction. But this new name, or, to bemore accurate, this specialised application of a name alreadyused by Myers in a looser and more general sense, is quite in1 Note that in the D.I. of January 21, 1912, the \u201c H-self \u201d is representedas that portion of the subliminal which is nearest to the transcendental self, but is at the same time distinguished from it. See p. 298 above.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's MecUumship 305\r\nconsonance with his teaching, and might well have been\r\naccepted by him as an improvement in terminology.\r\nThe synopsis of the \u201c Scheme of Vital Faculty \u201d, though not\r\nthe scheme itself in detail, is included, as we have seen, in Mr\r\nLeopold Myers\u2019s abridged version of Human Personality, and\r\nMrs Willett must be presumed to have read it.\r\nThe account given in the D.I. of January 21, 1912, of the\r\nrelation between the soul and \u201cthe Absolute \u201d raises questions\r\nwhich one could not even begin to discuss without jilunging into\r\nmetaphysics. Noteworthy among these is the remarkable\r\ndoctrine which attributes the origin of the individual soul to the\r\nprocess of the Absolute \u201c on its way to self-consciousness\r\nSo far as I can recollect nothing quite like this is to be found in\r\nHuman Personality? It seems to me to bear the mark of derivation from post-Kantian ideahstic speculation, of which,\r\ncuriously enough, a good many traces crop up in the scripts.\r\n\r\nHere, again, if the scripts are the work of the automatist\u2019s\r\nsubliminal self, from what source were the ideas expressed in\r\nthem obtained ? The normal IVIrs ^Villett is unable to throw\r\nany light upon this question.\r\nOf greater interest, because it has some bearing on the main\r\nsubject of the present chapter, is the ascending scale which is represented as extending beyond the transcendental self and\r\nreaching towards the Absolute. No attempt is made to define\r\nthe further stages in the scale. The communicator himself\r\nadrmts that even to the emancipated spirit the region that lies beyond the transcendental self is a region of conjecture. \u201c There\r\nare seas to be explored \u201d, says Gurney, \u201c and I can only sail a\r\nlittle way out and come back with a report that the sea stretches\r\ninfinitely vast beyond them \u201d. What he has in mind seems to be\r\na progress by stages through w'hich the individual ego passes in\r\nEarlier in the same D.I. statements are made which seem to imply that\r\nthe transcendental self, like the Absolute, achieves self-consciousness by hemming off , i.e. by self-limitation. But the script is so obscure at this point that I feel very rmcertain of the true interpretation.\r\n^ See, however, the last sentence in chapter ix. of Human Personality,\r\nquoted in the footnote (2) on p. 183.\r\nSee, for instance, the reference to Hegel\u2019s Phdnomenologie des Geistes in the D.I. of May 24, 1911 (p. 183 above).\r\n306 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [part\r\nits upward course, the relation between the stages being conceived as analogous to the relation between the suprahminal\r\nand subliminal \u201c selves\r\nWe have now to revert to the first of our two headings, and\r\nexamine the account given in the scripts of the nature of this\r\nrelation in the incarnate human being.\r\nLet us begin by noting the important admission that while\r\n\u201c the supraliminal and the subliminal are parts of one whole,\r\nthey may act apparently so disconnectedly as to lead one from\r\nthe incarnate standpoint to think of them as separate\r\nHow is this possible ? I do not think it would be unfair to Myers to say that he\r\naccepted the paradox as a true description of the nature of the\r\nsoul. The soul is at once a unitary self, or ego, and a self\r\ndistinguishable into parts sufficiently independent of each other\r\nto deserve on their own account to be described as \u201c selves\r\nIn essentials this is also the doctrine of the scripts. At the\r\nsame time I think I see signs that the communicators realised\r\nmore fully than the Myers of Human Personality appears to\r\nhave done the difficulties inherent in his solution of the problem.\r\nOn two points there is a noticeable change of attitude. On the\r\none hand there is a tendency to emphasise the unity by blmring\r\nthe lines of division between the \u2018\r\n\u2018 selves \u201d so as to resolve them\r\ninto a continuous whole. On the other hand, there seems to be\r\na disposition to soften the paradox of the independence of the\r\nparts by setting aside as irrelevant certain observed phenomena\r\nwhich are on the face of them hard to reconcile with the\r\ndoctrine.\r\nThe question I put to Gurney in the sitting of October 8, 1911,\r\nwas this : \u201c Myers in his book speaks of the suprahminal and\r\nthe subliminal sometimes as if they were separate though\r\nclosely associated selves, but more commonly as if they were\r\ndifferent strata of one and the same individual consciousness.\r\nHow are these two views to be reconciled ? \u201d\r\nIn reply Gurney says that in the individual consciousness\r\nthere are many gradations, and he compares it to an ascending\r\nchain, i.e. a chain of which the successive links represent ascending degrees of spirituality. He proceeds to tell us something of\r\nthe nature of the relation of the links with special reference to\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WilleWs Mediumship 307\r\nthe case of the supraliminal and the subliminal. \u201c Normal\r\nsuprahminal consciousness \u201d, we are informed, \u201c varies in\r\ndepth, and is, as it were, the upper crust of the subliminal. . . . The interaction between the two is continuous ^ . . . but the\r\nsupraliminal consciousness of that interaction varies \u201d. We\r\nhave here two statements, each of them interesting, though\r\nI am doubtful how far they are consistent. The natural\r\nmeaning of the first would seem to be that the suprahminal\r\nvaries in content, and at times includes a content which is usually confined to the subliminal. This would imply an\r\nenlarged range of supraliminal activity, and supraliminal and\r\nsubhminal, regarded as parts of our whole, would appear to be\r\neither overlapping each other or advancing and receding\r\nrespectively as the case may be. On the other hand, the\r\nsecond of the two statements rather suggests that the additional\r\ncontent is derived from the subliminal by a process of interaction\u2014we are not allowed to call it telepathic interaction\u2014and\r\nthat the \u201c variation in depth \u201d attributed to the supraliminal\r\nmay be merely a variation in its threshold of consciousness.\r\nAnother possible intei\u2019pretation would be that a kind of\r\nblending of the parts may take place so as to produce a\r\n\u201c blended consciousness \u201d similar to that which the communicator describes as forming the supraliminal of the discarnate.\r\nWhatever interpretation we adopt it is evident the \u201c chain of\r\nfinks \u201d is a very inadequate symbol to express the kind of unity\r\nin difference of which we are in search.\r\nIn the D.I. of January 21, 1912, the subject is resumed.\r\nFollowing upon a difficult passage which I take to be concerned\r\nwith another subject altogether, namely the relation between\r\nmind and body, the statements made in the earlier sitting are\r\nin effect repeated.\r\nInteraction, he says, is right. The supraliminal and the\r\nsubliminal ebb and flow. . . . But if you\u2019re going to confuse\r\nany of this with the whole question of secondary and tertiary\r\npersonalities and their respective memories of each other, you\u2019ll\r\nbe making a mistake. Those are cases of dislocation, imperfect\r\nand often pathological. Oh ! he says, it\u2019s the creaking of the\r\nmachine that . . . But, he says, when the thing works properly\r\n* \u201c Continuous \u201d here = unceasing, perpetual.\r\n308 Psychological AsjJects of Mrs Willett's Medmmship [partall the links are continuous, he says, and the point where thetranscendental merges with the subliminal\r\n\r\nmerges may bringa number of associations for you which may not be in the least\r\napplicable\u2014he says, between that point and the point whichhas been mapped out with the word supraliminal there\u2019s nocomplete break : it\u2019s like number.\r\nHere I intervened with a remark that was intended to bringthe discussion to a definite issue : \u201c Yoia speak of a continuousinteraction between the transcendental, the subbminal and thesupraliminal. Does not interaction imply duality or multiplicity ? In a sense individual human beings are parts of onewhole\u2014that is, they are all rooted, as it were, in the absolute.Are supraliminal and s\\d)liminal separate in a manner analogousto the separation of different human beings ? \u201d The real drift of my previous qiiestions seems now to flash\r\ninto Gurney\u2019s mind for the first time. The effect was dramatic.\u201c BOSH \u201d, he almost shouted\u2014at least the word was utteredby the automatist in a tone of voice so loud and startling thatfor the moment 1 was fairly taken aback. \u201c Bosh ! differentaspects of the same thing\r\nNo doidit it is to this incident that Gurney is referring when,in a later script (quoted on p. 256 above), he charges me withhaving tried to get him \u201c on the horns of a duality which woiildalmost amount to a concei)tion of the selves as separated in sucha way as to amount to 2 entities \u201d. Yet even now it is clearthat he has not fully grasped the nature of the cblemma as it presents itself to me. If supraliminal and subliminal are to beregarded as aspects of a unitary self, 1 should have nothing tosay in deprecation of his contemptuous outburst. That aspectsof a self cannot be selves on their own account is, in fact, one ofthe very points for which 1 have been contending throughoutthe present chapter. If they are aspects of a self they cannot beseparate selves : if they are not separate selves, how can theybe used in satisfactory explanation of those phenomena ofabnormal psychology for the imderstanding of which separateselves seem to be imperatively demanded\u2014such, for instance, as secondary personalities of the Sally Beauchamp type, or those \u201c nunciative automatisms \u201d which Myers himself admitsto be indistinguishable in form and circumstance from tele-\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 309\r\npathic messages accepted by him as proceeding from independent entities whether spirits of the dead or other human beings ? Neither in Human Personality nor in the Willett scripts do I find\r\nany plausible answer to this question. Indeed, one might go\r\nfurther and suggest that the sci\u2019ipts now under consideration\r\nshow a distinct disposition to shirk it. We are expressly\r\nwarned not to confuse the relation of suimaliminal to subliminal\r\n\u201c with the whole question of secondary and tertiary personalities and their respective memories of each other. . . . Those\r\nare cases of dislocation, imperfect and often pathological, the\r\ncreak of the machine \u201d. In other words, explanation of them\r\nis to be sought in organic disturbances. That they are often\r\nconnected with organic disturbances may readily be conceded ; but the Myers of Human Personality would have frankly\r\nadmitted, and indeed strenuously contended, that the splitting\r\nof the personality into at least quasi -independent selves occurs\r\nin persons to all appearance perfectly healthy, and calls for\r\nexplanation in terms of mind.\r\nOf course, if you sweep on one side all phenomena that seem\r\nhard to reconcile with your theory, you simplify the problem ; but you do so at the expense of leaving it unsolved.\r\nThe same tendency to avoid facing crucial cases is discernible,\r\nI think, in what I may call the Flaccus-Tlaccus incident. This\r\nincident provides the only case claimed by the scripts as a\r\ndefinite example of a \u201c message \u201d sent by the subliminal selfon its own account, and not merely as transmitter of messages\r\nfrom a communicating spirit\u2014to the supraliminal.\r\nThe automatist, who was not in trance, records a name\r\nreceived by her as \u201c Flaccus \u201d. This was correct ; but it was\r\nfollowed by the remark, \u201c No, that is wrong \u201d. In a note,\r\nwritten after the sitting was over, she adds\u2014evidently with\r\nreference to the correcting words\u2014that what she had recorded\r\nas \u201c Flaccus \u201d might have been \u201c Tlaccus \u201d. In a later script\r\n(see pp. 255-6 above) Gurney interprets the words, \u201c No, that is wrong \u201d, not as forming part of the communicator\u2019s message,\r\nbut as being a remark addressed by the automatist\u2019s subliminal\r\nself to her supraliminal, and as applying, not to the correctly\r\nrecorded Flaccus , but to an erroneous impression on the\r\npart of the suprahminal that perhaps what should have been\r\nwritten was \u201c Tlaccus \u201d.\r\n310 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partLeft to my own resources I should have supposed that theautomatist herself took the words \u201cno, that is wrong \u201d, to\r\ncome from the communicator ; and that afterwards, on readingover the script, had applied them to the name \u201c Flaccus \u201d, andremembered that she had doubted at the time whether this\r\nmight not have been \u201c Tlaccus \u201d. The interpretation of thewords as addressed by the subliminal to the supraliminal, andreferring to an unexpressed thought, rests upon the authorityof Gurney alone. Let us assume he was right, at least to this\r\nextent, that the words were no part of the communicator\u2019smessage, but represent the emergence of a doubt in IVIrs Willett\u2019s\r\nown mind. It seems quite unnecessary to invoke the machinery of a supraliminal ami a subliminal self in order to explain so familiar a psychic experience. It would certainly never haveoccurred to me to regard it as evidence of an interaction betweentwo independent entities associated together in the sameorganism.\r\nThere are, of course, plenty of mental experiences which arecapable of being described in figurative language that impliessome sort of diipfication of mind ; as, for instance, when someone, hesitating what course of action he shall adopt, says, \u201c I was in two minds about it \u201d. In such a case nobody wouldseriously suggest that an interaction between two distinct\r\nselves is involved. The duality is in the thought, not in thethinker, who holds the alternatives together and comparesthem. I should imhesitatingly assign the Flaccus-Tlaccusincident to this type of experience, if, with Gurney, we ascribethe correcting words to the automatist herself. But the question remains, is it possible to reduce to this type the cases inwhich, to quote Gurney\u2019s own words, the selves \u201c act apparently so disconnectedly as to lead one to think of them asseparate \u201d ? Here the Flaccus-Tlaccus incident is not illuminating.\r\nIt is important to make as clear as possible the distinction, as I see it, between phases of a self and separate selves. Forme phases of a self are successive states of ego ; they signifychanges in the contents of consciousness of an ego. Separateselves, on the other hand, are co-conscious egos ; that is to say,\r\negos which bear the characteristic marks of self-hood contem-\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship 311\r\nporaneouslyd Successive states of an ego may, I am quite ready\r\nto grant, present such contrasts as to produce marked alterations of personality. 2 I am further ready to grant that even in cases where memory of experience in state A seems to be completely lost in state B, nevertheless fragmentary recollection of\r\nthose experiences may occasionally rise to the surface and\r\nmingle in a puzzHng manner with the contents of state B\u2014though I certainly should not describe the intrusive memories as messages from an A self to a B self. What I am not prepared to believe is that successive states\r\nof an ego can ever be equivalent to a plurality of co-conscious\r\negos capable of interaction with each other. To speak of\r\nsuccessive states of an ego as \u201c selves \u201d in any sense is, in my\r\nview, misleading : to confuse them with co-conscious selves is to commit a serious error. I cannot but think that Myers was guilty of this error when\r\nhe tried to make his theory of the subliminal and the supraliminal do double duty, and provide him with an account of the\r\nstructure of human personality which satisfied the claims at once of unity and of plurality. Both the unity and the plurality\r\nhave suffered in the process. When he wishes to emphasise the\r\nunity, the element of plurality is whittled down to a difference\r\nof aspects, or phases, or even faculties of a unitary self. When\r\nthe claim of plurahty is uppermost he does not hesitate to use language the natural meaning of which is that the self as such\r\nis divisible into fragmentary parts.\r\nMy own ideas I will once more try to sum up in baldest\r\noutline.\r\nThe self which we all habitually recognise as being ourself is one and indivisible, but it is associated in the personality as a\r\nwhole, not only with an organism, but with a number of\r\ncentres of consciousness each of which is to be regarded as similarly one and indivisible, that is to say, as a self or monad.\r\nAmong these other selves it occupies a position of primacy, and m normal conditions is in supreme control of the organism.\r\n^ For illustrations in Mrs Willett\u2019s case of the distinction between co- conscious egos and successive states of the same ego, see pp. 147-8 above.\r\n2 1 doubt, however, whether extreme cases of alternating personalities are to be explamed in this way. I refer the reader to my remarks on this subject on p. 274.\r\n312 Psychological Asjjects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [part\r\nThis conception of human personality is avowedly based on\r\nthe observed phenomena of abnormal psychology. We have\r\nno direct evidence of the existence of these other, or secondary,\r\nselves, except when they reveal themselves as dissociated\r\nintelligences capable of acting on the primary self and being\r\nacted on by it. Nevertheless the continuing existence of the\r\ndissociated selves after and before dissociation is at least a\r\nplausible assumption ; and, if they continue to exist, it is a\r\nfurther plausible assumption that they may continue to interact\r\nwith the primary self and influence its conscious or subconscious\r\ncontent, even though the influence is no longer recognised by\r\nthe primary self as proceeding from an independent source.\r\nFinally, in order to complete my hypothesis, I have to\r\ngeneralise, and to assume that this composite psychical constitution, of which there is evidence in exceptional cases (and\r\nperhaps in dreaming), is not conflned to such cases, but is a common characteristic of all human personality. If this be so, interaction with the subordinate selves may be continually at\r\nwork modifying the thought-content of the primary self of all of us ; but unless the modification appears to the primary self\r\nto be impressed upon it from without by something other than\r\nitself, its thoiights will be \/or it its own thoughts, and will carry\r\nwith them no objective ^ significance.\r\nInteraction within the group of selves I conceive to be telepathic ; and I by no means exclude the possibility\u2014or even\r\nthe probability\u2014of a similar interaction between them and a\r\nspiritual environment external to them.\r\nI make no attempt to carry my analysis further or to try to\r\nimagine in detail how the cbfferent factors in human personality\r\nwork together to produce unity and order. Any such attempt\r\nwould involve an enqiiiry not only into the relation of mind to\r\nmind, but of mind to body, with the metaphysical problem of\r\nthe relation of mind and matter looming in the background.\r\nIn this paper I have conflned myself all but entirely to the\r\ndirect relation of mind to mind, a subject the systematic\r\ninvestigation of which may almost be said to date from the\r\nfoundation of the Society for Psychical Research. Even nowI suppose the majority of psychologists worfld deny that there\r\nwas any direct relation between individual minds, as such, other\r\n' See p. 46 above.\r\n140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship :U:3\r\nthan the negative one of inutiia] exclnsiveness and iinpenetiahility.

Although\r\nin the present chapter prominence has inevitably lieen given to\r\npoints on which 1 differ from him rather than to points of\r\nagreement, it is far from my wish to stress the dift\u2019erences\r\nunduly. 1 do not indeed look upon them as unimportant from\r\nthe theoretical standpoint. But if regard be had to the conclusion at which Myers arrived on the matters wiiich lie had\r\nmost at heart, I do not think the acceptance of my view's need\r\nsubstantially affect his position one way or the other. Myers\r\nconsidered that he had proved three things ^\r\n; in the first place,\r\nthat survival is a reality ; in the second place, that betw'een the\r\nspiritual and the material w'orlds an avenue of communication\r\ndoes, in fact, exist ; in the third place, that the surviving sjiirit\r\nretains, at least in some measure, the memories and loves of\r\nearth. With these conclusions 1 am in S3'mpathy, though\r\nMyers was surely oversanguine in holding them to lie proved.\r\nEvidence is slowlv accumulating, but even to-dav, more than a generation after his death, I cannot sax\u2019 that it amounts to\r\nproof.\r\nOn the other hand the case for survival does not rest on\r\nMyers s anal^'sis of lunnan personality, and would in no wav\r\nsuffer by a change in our conception of it that would substitute a group of suliorrlinate selves interacting with a dominant self,\r\nand in normal conditions subliminal thereto, for a single self\r\nmysteriously divisible into layers or strata that interact with\r\neach other as if thev were independent co-conscious selves.\r\nThe difference between the two conceptions may affect om-\r\n^ See H.P., vol. ii., pp. 2.56-7.

Salter, the RevdW. S. Irving, Mr llesterman and Mr Gatty. I have also applied [ap])ropriate methods of computation to a large proportion of the\r\n'\r\ndata published by Mr Hereward Carringtond\r\nBroadly speaking, the upshot is, first, that difference in reaction\r\ntime or reproduction is not, as I had originally supposed, in itself evidence that the personalities concerned are independent ; second,\r\nthat Controls (\u201c Feda,\u201d \u201c Uvani \u201d) are related to the normal personalities of their mediums in an inverse fashion, which seems explicable only by supposing them to be secondary personalities, probably formed round a nucleus of repressed material. Communicators (\u201c John,\u201d \u201c Etta,\u201d \u201c Dora \u201d) are not so related, and there is some reason for supposing that in the formation of the first and last\r\nof these two different factors are at work, while the second showssigns of a more developed autonomy.\r\nReferences to the mathematical treatment are inevitable in the\r\ncourse of the discussion ; but readers who are distressed by these imay conveniently omit sections 2 and 12 to 16 inclusive.\r\n2 '\r\n'Thanks to the continued kindness of Professor Fisher, to whom I am again heavily indebted throughout, the original method of\r\nanalysis has been improved and extended in the following respects :\r\n{a) The difficulties arising from the occasional occurrence of (excessively and meaninglessly long reaction times (or, mutatis \\m.utandis, psycho-galvanic reflexes have been dealt with by a |process of \u201c scaling \u201d the raw material to a standard form. This\r\nconsists in re])lacing the actual observed time (or deflexion) by oneJof the numbers 1 to 10, according to whether it is (1) less than 25%iof the median of the aggregate (sitting) to which it belongs, or 1(2) not less than 25% Init less than 50%, or (3) not less than 50%,'il)ut less than 75% . . . etc. up to (10) not less than 225% of the\r\n|median.^\r\nThis procedure prevents the results being unduly influenced by a few freakish values and greatly lightens the arithmetic. On this score alone it amply repays the not very serious labour involved in\r\nthe process of scaling.\r\n^ American Psychical Institute, Bulletin I.\r\n\u201c Cf.

This is a measure of the extent\r\nto which the personalities concerned vary together from occasion to\r\noccasion in respect of the various words ; it is relevant to such questions as whether the effect of a hot day, for example, would be to\r\nmake both react more quickly to ice, say, than to fire.\r\nUsing the the notation of Q.S.T.P., I, this quantity is given by\r\n2=1 log, (OW\/OWP)\r\nwhere the letters stand for the mean squares. The value of is\r\n1 \/ 7(w-l) (\u00bb'-l)\r\nwhere n is the number of words in the list and n' the number of\r\nsittings.\r\nThe term Covariance seems appropriate as suggesting the property\r\nof varying together under changing influences and is not hkely, in\r\nthis context, to conflict with existing usage. The tendency to co- vary seems, however, to be slight, so that the quantity has not proved\r\nparticularly informative.\r\n(d) For each personality considered I have also calculated a\r\nquantity which I am calling Individuality (I) for short, though some\r\nsuch term as \u201c differentiational consistency \u201d might be more exact.\r\nIt is a measure of the extent to which the reactions to different words\r\nare consistently different for the personality concerned ; it is relevant\r\nto the question of whether, and to what extent, the personality\r\nalways gives a longer time to goat, say, than to pig and to pig than\r\nto CAT, during the jieriod covered by the tests. It is given by\r\nJ\r\nl\u201eg, (W\/OW)\r\nwhere W and OW are given the obvious interpretations ajipropriate\r\nto a single personality.

In the circiimstances I have thought it best to concentrate somewhat arbitrarily on certain\r\nmajor features of the results and the conclusions which it seems\r\nlegitimate to draw from them, and to relegate a number of minor\r\nissues to the discursive notes of sections 34 to 40 in Part IV.\r\nJ^ART II The Resterman-Gatty Experiment\r\n8\r\nDuring the period covered by this paper, the first noteworthy\r\nevent in point of time, and one of the most important in its implications, was the Besterman-Gatty experiment of June 1934.\r\nThis was undertaken in order to test the view originally held by\r\nme and expounded in Q.S.T.P., I, to the effect that if two personalities possess a common subconscious they could not, apart from\r\ndeliberate cheating, produce significantly different sets of reaction\r\ntimes or disturbances in reproduction ; with the corollary that\r\nwhere such differences are observed they constitute strong evidence\r\nof the autonomy of the personalities concerned.\r\nMr Gatty, who acted as subject, had led, for a considerable part of\r\nhis career, a kind of double life\u2014in the entirely innocent sense that\r\nhis activities had alternated between scientific research work at\r\nOxford and the ordinary sporting and similar avocations of a country\r\ngentleman in Hampshire. These two contexts, as I may call them,\r\nformed the bases of the two \u201c poses \u201d or \u201c orientations of mind \u201d\r\nwhich he assumed alternately in the two conditions\u2014known as Gatty(O) and Gatty(H) respectively\u2014in which he was tested.\r\nIn addition he adopted attitudes and volitions as indicated by the\r\nfollowing extracts from a letter to myself : Pose (0) : \u201cI merely visualised myself in the Balliol Quad, looked\r\nfor scientific associations, and imagined an uneventful life with a somewhat auditory memory. I supposed myself bashful aliout an\r\nunsuccessful love-affair, tried to be slow in my responses and flat in\r\nreflexes. Being at lower tone I managed to mishear some words and\r\n32(j Whately Carmgton, 31.A., M.Sc. [partconfused pond and bond, bread and red deliberately. Aimed atbeing a complex ]ierson who faiUd at his reproduction test.\u201d\r\nPose (H) : \u201c Here I merely lived in Hampshire and Scotland.Was fond of games, travel, shooting and hunting. Quite spontaneous about a great girl friend (fictitious) . . . aimed at quick responses,and big refiexes by conjuring up vivid pictures in my mind, and avisual memory.\u201d\r\nHe adds, \u201c beyond trying for bigger reflexes in personality (H) Idid not try for detailed faking.\u201d By this is meant that there was nopreliminary planning as regards trying to give specially long (orshort) times or specially large (or small) reflexes in response to particidar words. But he continues, \u201c I believe I could do this \u201d (fakein detail) \u201c in another set of experiments, but not to a great extent.\u201dThe necessity, however, does not arise, for Mr Hatty\u2019s generalisedefforts were attended by a large measure of success and effectivelyanswer the question which the work was designed to investigate.\r\n9\r\nIn the first place the reaction times are unmistakably longer, asmtended, in the 0 state than the H ; and the reflexes bigger as Hthan as 0. Details are given m Table C below, which shows themean RT in fifths of a second and mean scale deflexion corrected forsensitivity, for 0 and H personalities, at the six sittmgs employed.Table C\r\n8ITTINCJ 0 H\r\nPGR RT PGR RT\r\n1 87 13-4 119 9-3\r\n2 149 15-5 171 8-2\r\n3 96 15-8 227 7-5\r\n4 56 15-1 168 7-4\r\n5 92 14-8 232 7-1 6 53 13-3 200 7-8\r\nThe means for the two states (all sittings) are Hatty (0) : Mean reaction time 14-7 sec\/5 166T\u201e (H) : \u201e \u201e \u201e 7-8 \u201e 166-2,, (0) : Mean scale deflexion 87 divisions 166-3\u201e (H): \u201e \u201e \u201e 185 \u201e 166-4The difference is evklently significant in each case.\r\n141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 327\r\nAs regards IIT it is remarkal)le, first, that in the whole 1,200\r\nreactions not one was more than doul)le the median of the sitting\r\nto which it belonged ; second, that despite this relatively low variahility the Individualisation in each pose (RN 146, 147) was significantly high. But note how the deliberate slowing of response has\r\nproduced a much lower value of I in the 0 state (RN 146) than in\r\nthe H (RN 147).\r\nThe effect on the reflexes is very curioiis. In each case (RN 139,\r\n140) an insignificant (negative) value of I is obtained ; that is to say,\r\nthe deflexions behave as if they were no more than chance determined,\r\nand this is confirmed by the comparisons for S and D (RN 158\u20181,\r\n158'2). In other words, the nett outcome of Mr Gatty\u2019s efforts in\r\nthis resj)ect has merely been to confuse the issue and render the\r\nresults nnintelligihle.\r\nAs regards reproduction, the difference t)etween 0 and H is well\r\nmarked, as might be expected from the expressed intention cpioted\r\nabove. The figures for successful attempts in 600 trials are\r\nGatty (0) - - 448 167-1 \u201e (H) - - 505 167-2\r\nThus we have\r\nRight Wrong\r\nGatty (0) - - 448 152\r\n\u201e (H) - - 505 95\r\nApplying the usual method of Contingency ^ we obtain\r\ny2 = l6-56. P=<-000,1 167-3\r\nThe difference is clearly significant, though irrelevant to our enquiry, since it is not on the absolute number of failures in reproduction, but on the distribution of these among the words, that our judgments are based.\r\n10\r\nWhen we turn to the comparisons between 0 and H we find results\r\nof the utmost interest and importance.\r\nThe reflexes, it is true, speak with a quite uncertain voice, but\r\nboth reaction times (RN 161-2) and reproductions (RN 163\u20182) show\r\na significant difference between the two states. Since there can be no doubt that Gatty (0) and Gatty (H) equally\r\nare Gatty, and possess a common subconscious, these results effec- tively knock the bottom out of my original view that such differences\r\ncannot be produced by a single individual and therefore indicate,\r\n^ C'f.

[partwhen ol)served, that the personalities concerned are autonomous andindependent.\r\nFor this erroneous opinion there was, I think, some justificationat the time that it was formed. The work of Prince and Petersenstrongly indicated that secondary personalities of pathological typecould be relied upon to give the same reflexes as their primaries,while my earlier work ^ had shown a strong connection between reflex and reaction time, for the correlation between the two observables taken over an average of fifty subjects on a list of 100 words isr=-4fi 168which is highly significant. The argument from these facts that theconclusion that the same woiild obtain for reaction times (and re-])roductions) as obtained for reflexes was evidently in the nature ofan illegitimate transference, aided by the emphasis that Jung andHleuler had laid on the unconscious or subconscious determinationof reaction time and disturbance in reproduction.\r\nTo these factors must be added the effect of my own prepossessionsin favour of coming to a \u201c positive \u201d conclusion. Any man whodeclares that he is without bias in this subject occupies, it seems tome, the position of a watchmaker who declares that he has made aclock of perfect accuracy which neither gains nor loses ; that is tosay, he is either a wilful deceiver or he does not know his job. Themost one can do is to determuie the sense and if possible the approximate virulence of one\u2019s jjrejudices and discoiuit one\u2019s less rigid arguments accordingly, just as the watchmaker determines the \u201c rate\r\n\u201dof his chronometer and applies an appropriate correction.\r\n11\r\nlie this as it may, I wish to make it perfectly clear that myoriginal view was quite evidently wrong and that this experimentshows clearly that significant differences in RT and RPN can be produced by a generalised, non-fraudulent \u201c pose \u201d or change in mentalorientation having nothing to do with any deliberate picking andchoosuig among the words of the list. It follows that the discoveryof such differences between a normal and a trance personality offersno justification at all (except in a purely permissive sense) for supposmg that the latter is independent of the former and does notshare a common subconscious with it. Additional experiments on these lines are, of course, highly desirable, but more for the purpose of investigating the scope andlimitations of such ])Oses than of confirmiug the scarcely dubitableconclusion drawn.\r\n^ Cf.

Facts are holy and sacred, but no\r\nright-minded man should resent his interpretations being overset.\r\nOn the contrary, if every experiment yields results conforming to\r\nexpectation, the prudent investigator will suspect that there is something amiss somewhere ; but if he succeeds in showing that he was\r\nwrong, he may be tolerably certain that real progress is bemg made.\r\nPart III\r\n\u201c Controls \u201d v. \u201c Communicators \u201d\r\n12\r\nThe conclusions reached hi this part are best approached somewhat\r\ncircuitously by way of a general survey of certain features of the\r\nresults as a whole.\r\nWe may first note that, so far as the mathematics of the analysis\r\nare concerned, there is no a priori reason why any value of z for\r\nI. S. D or C should be positive rather than negative. In fact, if we\r\nwere to obtain our data by drawing numbers out of a hat we should\r\nexpect to find positive and negative results occurrmg with equal\r\nfrequency.\r\nOn the other hand, inasmuch as we are dealmg throughout with\r\nhuman beings in one guise or another, we should expect them, m the\r\nabsence of error, to exhibit some measure of consistency {ptace the\r\ncynics) m their response to words, some measure of resemblance to\r\neach other, some difference, and some tendency to react alike to\r\ndifferences between the occasions on which they are tested. On this\r\nscore, we should expect all results to be positive.\r\nBut error is by no means absent, and while it will tend to inflate some results it will dimmish others, to the point perhaps, if there lie no more than this \u201c common humanity \u201d at work, of pushing some\r\nof them over the borderfine into negativity. Error alone, however,\r\ncannot be expected to do this to any significant extent.\r\nThe comparative plenitude of results available enables us to deal\r\nin what might be termed statistics of the second degree\u2014that is, in\r\nstatistics of statistics\u2014and we may begin by examining the actual\r\ndistribution of positive and negative results as displayed in\r\nTable D.^\r\n^ In Tables I, II and III, negative results arc marked, I'or ease oI reference,\r\nwith a suffixed asterisk.\r\n330 Wkatdy Carinylon, M.A., M.Sc.

The totals do not all agree with those of Tables A and Bbecause certain pairs of resnlts, viz. B,N 1 and 2, 5 and G, 19 and 20,deal with the same material by different methods, as indicated inthe Notes on Eesults ; they can accordingly only be connted as oneeach here.)\r\nWe may note at once that onr expectation of a heavy preponder-ance of positive resnlts, based on the \u201c common humanity \u201d factor,is, on the whole, well fulfilled. If the data were chance determinedthroughout, we should expect 14G positive and 146 negative results ; we actually obtain 233 and 59 respectively.

No good ])urpose is served by evaluatmg P beyond thisvalue, which is the lowest given in Fisher\u2019s Tables.)\r\nWe conclude that potent factors other than chance are at workand are producing on the whole the kind of results we should expect.As agahist this the number of negative results actually obtained,namely 59, or 21%, is far from negligible, and it will be instructive toenquire whether these are to be attributed solely to error, or whetherthere are causes definitely tending to give negative values. If so, we shall want to know where these are located, how they operate, andhow they are to be interpreted.\r\n14\r\nWe may next remark that the highest ])ercentage of negative re- sults (36%) is found among the figures for Covariance. This 1 thiidv\r\nis to be expected, since to ask })ersonalities to co-vary Irom occasion\r\n141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 331\r\nto occasion is trying the linkage between them a good deal higher,\r\nso to s])eak, than is required for a general similarity for which all\r\noccasions are pooled and minor variations averaged out.\r\nIf we apply to these figures the same process that we used for the\r\ntotals, we have\r\nx2 = 3-92. P = -05v.n 170\r\nso that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether Covariance is, in\r\ngeneral, a genuine phenomenon at all. On the other hand, it is re- markable that the two states of both Mr Gatty and Mrs Salter co- vary significantly (RN 163-3, 164-3) on RPN, although the former\r\nare negligibly similar (RN 163-1). This very curious result must, I\r\nthink, be put into cold storage for the time being, though I shall\r\nallude to its possible significance below.\r\nIn any event we may safely ascribe the negative results in the Covariance figures to chance ; for apart from the antecedent likelihood\r\nof this, more detailed examination shows that they are not distributed among personalities, or otherwise, in any significant or even\r\nsuggestive fashion.\r\nI conclude that the tendency to co-vary is so feeble, as a general\r\nrule, that the effect of error is almost as likely as not to produce a\r\nnegative as a positive result.\r\n15\r\nWe may also summarily dismiss as of no importance those negative results which appear among the figures for I and D. In the first\r\nplace, there are very few of them ; in the second, it would, I think,\r\nbe almost impossible to assign any mtelligible interpretation to them\r\nif there were not\u2014certainly we need not strain our ingenuity in such\r\na way before we are required to do so.

Not a smgle negative value appears among thefigures for I or for S and only one among those for D.\r\nIf we compare the figures for RPN (93 positive, 8 negative) withthose for all the other results taken together (140 positive, 51 negative) we obtain\r\nX\u201c= 14-45. P = -001 v.n 173-2\r\nThe reproduction test is, in other words, significantly less liable\r\nthan the others (RT or PGR) to yield negative results.\r\n17\r\nBy this slightly unsystematic process of examination we havenarrowed our study of the incidence of negative results down to the\r\npoint at which it is clear that their interesting occurrence, if any, is chiefly among Similarities for RT and PGR.\r\nExtracting the appropriate figures from the Table and rewriting\r\nfor the sake of clearness, we have\r\nPGR RT Total\r\nPositive - - 11 28 39\r\nNegative - 5 20 25\r\nTotal - - 16 48 64\r\nAt first sight this looks as if the tendency to give negative results were apjneciably greater for RT than for PGR ; but this is not the\r\ncase, for on testing we obtain only\r\nx2 = 0-55. P = -23v.n 174\r\nwhich is quite insignificant.\r\nIf we compare the figures for PGR and RT (39 positive, 25 negative) with all others taken together, we have\r\nx2-\u201c 18-08.

P= <-000,1 175-3\r\nIt is clear the RT Similarities are especially liable to yield negative\r\nresults, while there is a reasonably strong suspicion that this applies\r\nto PGR Similarities also.\r\n141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 333\r\nThus even this most general treatment of the data provides us with coercive evidence to tlie effect that there exists between the\r\nmembers of many pairs of })ersonalities a strange and almost sinister\r\nrelationship\u2014a relationship of inverse likeness ; as it might be of a shadow\u2014but reversed ; of a doppelgdnyer\u2014but facing backwards !\r\n18\r\nIt is very important to realise that a negative similarity, or a negative correlation, implies just as close a connection between the\r\ntwo entities compared as does a positive result of the same statistical significance. The two ends of a see-saw are not the less parts\r\nof a single mechanism because one goes up when the other goes\r\ndown.\r\nMy own feeling, indeed, though I should be sorry to have to justify\r\nit rigidly, is that a negative result gives a greater assurance of inti- mate connection than a positive. I can more or less understand two\r\nsets of reactions being similar, despite the true independence\u2014in the\r\nordinary psychological sense\u2014of the personalities concerned ; but I really cannot imagine their being countersimd&v (to adopt a convenient term) except by supposing that one is really m some sense the\r\ncounterpart of the other, as it might be the inside and the outside of\r\na repomse plaque.\r\nAgain, we may think of a projecting lantern in which two slides are\r\ninserted together. It is easy to imagine that the slide with the\r\nstronger pattern may obscure the image of the other, by superposition, to the point of extinction ; but however far this may be carried,\r\nimagination boggles at the idea that the stronger should superimpose\r\nits own image reversed !\r\n19\r\nReverting to the main thread of the discussion, we may enquire\r\nwhether this tendency to \u201c countersimilarity,\u201d as I shall henceforward term it, is to be found equally among all personalities, or types\r\nof personality, or whether it is appreciably localised in this respect.\r\nOnly a slight inspection of the Tables, in which negative results are additionally distinguished by the sirffixing of an asterisk, will be\r\nneeded to show that the former hypothesis is incorrect.\r\nIn Table II, particularly, it will be seen that RT Similarities in- volving Feda have almost a monopoly of negative values. These are formd in RN 72, 79, 101, 104, 105, 114, 116 and 118, while only those\r\nfor 75 and 78 are positive.\r\nOn the other hand, among comparisons not involving Feda, we\r\n334 Wlmtely Oai'ingfon, 31. A., 71\/.*%. [partfind a negative Similarity only at RN 103, while RN 71, 73, 74, 76,77, 80, 102, lOG, 1 13, 1 15 and 117 are positive.^\r\nTabulating in the ordinary 2x2 Contmgency Table, as before, wehave\r\nPositive Negative Total\r\n\u201c Fcda \u201d comparisons - - 2 8 10 ' Other \u201e\r\n- - 11 1 12 JTotals - - 13 9 22\r\nIn order to asccrtaiii the chajrce of this inequality of distribution4being accidental, we work as usual and obtam\r\n_X\u201c = ll-59. P= <-000,5 176In other words, the odds are more than two thousand to one injfavour of the supposition that countersimilarity is associated with|| Feda rather than with other personalities.^\r\n||I think there can be no reasonable doubt whatever about the| genuineness of this effect. Not only does Feda show countersimi-I larity in eight cases out of ten, but she does so m respect of five different personalities (at one time or another), with two different;experimenters, and with three different lists of words. Moreover,| one of her countersimilarities (RN 116) is intrinsically significant,whereas her highest positive similarity (RN 75) is no more than71417 with -10 chance of being accidental.^\r\n;\r\n|20\r\nIf we turn to the Garrett Group (Table I) we find the same kindtof tendency in Uvani as we have just studied in Feda, though herethe effect is not nearly so marked.^\r\n* For the purposes of this discussion, I do not include RN 81 to 85 or 119I to 122, which are comparisons of Mr Drayton Thomas and Mr Irving respec- i tively, with the personalities of the Leonard group. The question of whether| these gentlemen are secondary personalities or discarnate entities has happily; not yet arisen, while it would be fantastic to suggest that either of them is at mere modification of Mrs Leonard. !\r\n^ Strictly, we should say that the odds are more than two thousand to one] against the hypothesis that countersimilarity is no more likely to occur in\r\n[ comparisons which involve Feda than in those which do not.\r\nj ^ It is interesting to note that of the three anomahes, or exceptions to the'\r\nrule that Feda is countersimilar in comparison while other personalities are not, i two (RN 75 and 103) are comparisons with P (Prepared Leonard). This per- sonahty is extremely erratic, as is indicated by the very low values which she; (gives for I. This relative imreliability may also contribute to the abnormalI (value of RN 116. ! ,^ In what follows I uniformly exclude the personality known as \u201c Abdulatif \u201d\r\n(A) from consideration.

Application of the usual\r\ntreatment gives\r\nX^ = 2-72. P = -05v.n 177\r\nThis result as it stands is far from coercive, but it is m the same\r\nsense as that obtamed for Feda, and the difference m significance\r\ncorresponds well with that in the quantity of data used (c\/. Table\r\nB)d\r\nI think there is very little doubt that what is true here for Feda is true for Uvani also ; at any rate there seems nothing to be gained by\r\ndisputing the indications.\r\nIf we care to regard Feda and Uvani as constituting a class of\r\nControls\u2014using the word, as is more or less customary in psychical\r\nresearch, to denote personalities specifically associated with the\r\nmedium, as opposed to Communicators associated with particular\r\nsitters\u2014and to combine the figures, we have\r\nPositive Negative Total\r\nF and U Similarities - 3 12 15\r\nOther >> 14 2 16\r\nTotals 17 14 31\r\nwhence\r\ny2= 14-24. P = -000,1 v.n\r\nThe results obtained in this and the preceding section may he taken as establishing beyond any reasonable doubt the fact that it is [except by\r\nrare accident) uniquely characteristic of Controls, as represent^ by\r\nFeda and Uvani, to be countersimilar to the other personalities of\r\nthe psychological manifold to which they belong. Conversely, it is only\r\nto Controls that other hinds of personality are [except by rare accident)\r\ncountersimilar. More mtelligibly, if less accurately, countersimilarity is a property of Controls but not of normal personalities or of\r\nCommunicators.\r\n21\r\nIt will be worth while digressing briefly to reconsider the nature\r\nof the test for Similarity, in order that we may be clear in our minds\r\nGarrett, but it is not clear whether he should be regarded as a Control or as a Communicator, in the sense in which I use the terms [vide infra), and, in either event, he behaves inconsistently.\r\n\u2018More accurately than the Table indicates, the results just obtained for Feda are based on about 5,000 observations and those for Uvani on about 1 ,800.\r\n330 Whafely Caringfon, M.A., M.8c. [partas to what is actually involved. Mathematically speaking, a negative similaTity is precisely equivalent to a negative correlation (indeed, intra-class correlation is only a particular example of theAnalysis of Variance. Cf. Fisher, loc. cit., section 40).\r\nIn ordinary language, it indicates a tendency for one of the pair ofpersonalities compared to give relatively long reaction times (orlarge reflexes) in responding to words on which the other gives relatively short times (or small reflexes) ; and ime versa. The figures employed are the totals ^ for the various words, for allsittings, the data being \u201c scaled \u201d and corrected for fatigue, as in-dicated above. Thus day-to-day variations are to a great extentaveraged out and the result refers to the effect of the words on thewhole.\r\nIt is not suggested, of course, that every word giving a total (oraverage) time, say, greater than the mean in the case of one person-jality, will give a time less than the mean in the case of the other\u2014' many words will, in general, agree in being above or below the mean1for both ; but the obtaining of a negative result for the whole list'\r\ndoes imply that the words which are dissimilar in this sense outweigh*those that are alike. I22\r\nThe question of the psychological interpretation to be placed on, this jflienomenon of the countersimilarity of Controls is naturallyone of the very greatest importance, and I may say at once that inmy judgment the facts are only to be understood by supposing thatFeda and Uvani are secondary personalities of Mrs Leonard and Mrs' Garrett respectively, probably formed, round nuclei of repressedmaterial.^\r\n| On this hypothesis, the curious phenomenon of countersimilaritybecomes instantly intelligible.\r\nWe will suppose that a quantity of psychological material has be-; come repressed, in the ordinary psychoanalytic sense, with respectf|to the normal consciousness. This material, consi.sting of \u201cideas,\u201dj\u201c tendencies,\u201d etc., not j)roperly integrated into the personality, willidseek relief with a vigour depending on their extent and the intensityof their repression. It is entirely concordant with establishedJ]>sychological knowledge to suppose that this rehef may take thej^ Tlie use of totals is merely to economise arithmetical labour ; precisely the\r\n\" same results would be obtained by using mean (average) times or reflexes.\r\n^ Various indications, not yet fully studied, suggest that the antithesis which countersimilarity reveals may be more generalised than is suggested byItlie word \u201c nucleus.\u201d\r\n141] The QvantitaUve Sfnrh\/ of Trance Perffovalitieff 337\r\nform of the intermittent apjiearance of a .secondary [)er.sonality,\r\nwhich represent,s in a dramatised ami S3anbolic form the tendencies,\r\netc., repressed.\r\nNow suppose that a, stimulus word is given to the normal personality such that the most natural association to it is in turn connected\r\nwith the repressed material. To reply with this naturally associated\r\nword would have the effect of bringing nearer to the forefront of\r\nconsciousness, so to speak, just those thoughts which, ex hypofhesi, are least accejitable to it. The threatened conflict can only be avoided\r\nby rejecting this first word and substitutmg another which, while still associated with the first, is relatively innocent of eridogenic (conflictproducing) connotations.\r\nThis process, which may equally well be described in terms of\r\nneurological blockage,\u201d etc., will involve a certain delay ; so that\r\nwords of this kind will tend to show longer reaction times than those\r\nwhose comrection with the repressed material is negligible.\r\nBut if the same word be given to the secondary personality, the\r\nvery core of whose being is constituted by the repressed matter, the\r\nforegoing considerations will not apply. The immediately suggested\r\nword will be accepted without demur and the reaction time will be\r\ncorrespondingly short.\r\nIt is easy to see that this process affords a basis for the countersimilarity observed, particularly if we suppose it to be reversible,\r\nso that certam words associated with unrepressed material give\r\nrelatively long times for the secondary personality and relatively\r\nshort for the normal. This seems reasonable because the relation of\r\nincompatibility assumed to exist between the repre.ssed and unrepressed elements is clearly symmetrical.\r\nIn any event, of course, the observed phenomenon stands as a fact on its merits and necessarily implies that certain words having long\r\ntimes for one personality have short for the other, and vice versa}\r\n23\r\nIt .should be noted that the conclusion reached is in no way\r\ninvalidated liy the fact that countensimilarity is not observed in the\r\nreproduction test. There is admittedly a .strong association, in most\r\ncases, between prolongation of RT and disturbance in RPN ; but, on\r\nthe other hand, it is clear that there must be considerable difference.s\r\n^ Potential critics should note that the procedure of computation is precisely\r\nthe same for all comparisons, so that fortuitous errors, if any, would operate\r\nin pairs not involving Peda in just the same way as on those of which she orms a member, and would be as likely to affect one type of comparison as he other.\r\n33S Whatphj Carington, M.A., M.Se. [partIjetween tlie process of finding a word in tlie first instance and that ofsubsequently remembering what word was found.\r\nIn any event, no amount of failure to find an effect by one methodcan offset the fact that it is actually found by another.\r\n24\r\nI must here anticipate a criticism which might reasonably beraised in somewhat the following form : \u201c Conceding that Countersimilarity between A and B indicates that one is a secondary personality of the other, why should Feda, who is coimtersimilar toJohn, Etta and Dora, as well as to the two Leonard forms, be re- garded as essentially a secondary of Normal Leonard ? \u201d\r\nThe answer, I think, lies in the fact that there are only two alternatives open to us (apart from rejecting the evidence altogether), ofwhich we must select the less improbable.\r\nWe might, of course, suppose that Feda is \u201c really \u201d the primaryor normal personality of which N, P, J, E and D are secondaries.This seems to me altogether fantastic, but some people might notthink the worse of it on that account. The other alternative is tosuppose that Normal Leonard is the primary personality, Feda thesecoirdary\u2014countersimilar thereto\u2014and that the countersimilaritybetween Feda and the others arises, by reflection, as it were, fromthe resemblance of these to Normal Leonard.\r\nIf this second view be correct, it is clear, I think, that the com-mon countersimilarity to Feda of N, P, J, E and U must arise fromreactions to words with respect to which these agree, rather thanfrom those with respect to which they differ. In other words, it must arise from what I have termed the \u201c common humanity\r\nfactor. If this is true, and l)earing in mind the account of the process propounded in section 22 above, we should expect to And acertain tendency for words which yield short times when applied toFeda to give, regularly, long times when applied to the other personalities concerned. That is to say, if we make a list of the wordswhich give the shortest times for Feda and note opposite eachwhether it gives a long or a short time for N, P, J and E, say, weshould expect to And a tendency for the \u201c longs \u201d to group themselvesinto rows, rather than to be randomly distributed.\r\nUnfortunately, it is very difficult to apply this test. Three different lists of words are involved, and two of these (Irving experiment and first Thomas experiment) were carefully chosen so as tocontain a minimum of words of universal interest. {Cf. Q.S.f.P., I,\r\nP- 184.)\r\nIn the case of the second Thomas experiment, where a stronger\r\nItI'BftI(1II' *(illIifjlllllfJIti|{|\u00bbtoEliiiItlitfi;'klllioiAll'Kp('If\r\n141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 339\r\nlist was intentionally used (to which fact may presumably be\r\nattributed the well-marked coimtersimilarities observed despite the\r\nrelatively small number of observations) the personality P is evidently unreliable as regards reaction time (KN 45), while no data were collected from Normal Leonard. We are accordingly left with\r\nJ and E, constituting a somewhat slender foundation for a test. I\r\nfind, however, a tendency to grouping in the expected sense rej^resented by the figure\r\n2= -5027. P=:-03 179\r\nwhich may be regarded, in the circumstances, as tolerably good\r\nevidence in support of the hypothesis adopted,\r\nI need hardly say that I should not care to press the pomt, although\r\nthe fact here noted seemed just worth mentioning as a kind of makeweight. There seems, however, no particular difficulty m the way of\r\nsupposhig that the countersimilarity of Feda to personalities other\r\nthan Normal Leonard arises in the manner suggested.\r\n25\r\nI must also add a few lines on the subject of the response words\r\ngiven by Feda and Uvani.\r\nMr Drayton Thomas, who has made a special study of this aspect\r\nof all the personalities concerned in the experiments which he conI ducted, contends that Feda\u2019s replies have \u201c a strong Oriental\r\n( flavour.\u201d This is true enough, though I find nothing that cannot\r\nI reasonably be attributed to the vague knowledge of Indian life and\r\ncustoms that any tolerably well read person can hardly fail to\r\n; acquire ; I find nothing, in fact, that cannot plausibly be ascribed\r\nI to Mrs Leonard\u2019s own conscious or subconscious knowledge.\r\nI On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the very few nonI Enghsh words appearing among Feda\u2019s replies include Samisen,\r\nI which is Japanese ; Amah, which is Chinese, and Yashmak, which is\r\n. Arabic.\r\nIn fact, so far as her Orientahsms are concerned, Feda appears to\r\n* desert the trite oidy to achieve the inappropriate.\r\n! Similar considerations apply to Uvani, who can produce nothing\r\n, better than Burnous, Mosque, Mirage, Karma (not a Moslem concep-\r\n.i tion, I think). Shekel and Papyri among the data collected for myI self, to which may be added Akaska (? Akasha ?) and Mazurka (in\r\nreply to Woman and Bride ! !) from Mr Hereward Carrington\u2019s\r\nexperiments.\r\nAnyone who finds these convincing may be regarded as beyond\r\nhope, while, on the other hand, there is a strong tendency to a stilted\r\n340 Whately Garington, M.A., M.Sc. [partpretentiousness of response (exemplified by such words as Affirmation, Beneficence, Jeojxmlise. Endeavour, Introspective, Exhilaration,etc.) which seem to me singularly out of character for an Arab whopurports to know no English.\r\nIn short, no attempt to sujjport the autonomy of either Feda orUvani by an appeal to the Indian or Arabian character of theirreplies would appear to have a chance of standhig for a momentagainst intelhgent criticism.\r\n26\r\nThe question naturally arises as to whether what is true of reac-tion time is true also of the psycho-galvanic reflex. The available evidence, which will be found m Table I, is far fromconclusive, but, so far as it goes, it uidicates that this is the case. Inthis (Garrett) group we hnd ^ for PGR Similarities\r\nPositive Negative Total\r\nUvani Comparisons - - 2 3 5\r\nOther ,,\r\n- - 3 1 4\r\nTotals - - 5 4 9\r\nwhence we have\r\nX\u201c = M0. P = -15 180a result which is in the same sense as those for RT, but a long wayfrom significance.\r\nAs against this, it should be noted that one result (RN 19-1) showsa dehnitely significant comitersimilarity. It is true that the materialis poor (H. C.\u2019s data for 1932) and contams a large number of negative deflexions, but there is no reason why this should affect the issueone way rather than the other. Moreover, the effect is greater(RN 19T) when the more reasonable of the two methods of treatmentis apphed (see Notes on Results).\r\nOn the whole the evidence may be said to be pretty strongly inIhvour of countersimilarity in PGR on the part of Uvani.\r\nThe obstacles in the way of accepting these indications at thenface value are, first, the work of Prince and Petersen cited m Q.S.T.P.,I, p. 176, and, second, the diliiculty of supposing that so very \u201cphysiological \u201d a phenomenon as the reflex can undergo so curious aninversion or reversal as the result of an essentially \u201c psychological \u201dchange.\r\nThe latter difficulty seems to me more apparent than real, and toproceed mainly from an illegitimate and somewhat question-begging^Neglecting \u201cAbdulatif\u201d as before and remembering that RN 19'1 and2(J'l can only count as one negative result.\r\n141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Tersonalitieis 341\r\nassumption to the effect that a verbal response is in some sense more\r\n\u201c mental \u201d and less neurological than a p-g reflex. This is probably\r\nnonsensical, while in any event we know\u2014as Professor Fisher has\r\nkindly remmded me\u2014that in the expression of emotional attitudes,\r\netc., of opposite kinds very extensive reversals of imiervation take\r\nplace. Thus, as Darwin pomted out in his Expression of the Emotions\r\nin Man and Anhnals, muscles which are contracted in aggressive\r\nmoods are relaxed in friendly, and vice versa ; and it does not seem\r\naltogether irrational to suppose either that this \u201c principle of antithesis \u201d may extend to the hmervational mechanisms of the p-g\r\nreflex, or that the normal and secondary personalities are antithetic\r\nin a relevant sense. As regards the results obtained by Prince and Petersen, I see no\r\nreason for attempting to discount these and can only offer at present\r\nthe very tentative conjecture that countersimilarity may be a re- latively superflcial phenomenon observable m respect of material\r\nat levels above that down to which the process of dissociation has\r\nbeen carried, but not ajjplicable to elements of so profound an emotional significance as to be located, so to speak, m the subconscious\r\ncommon to both. It seems likely also that countersimilarity would\r\nnot occur in respect of very superficial material of small affective\r\nimport, so that I would not be surprised if a thorough investigation were not to reveal it as appearmg for words producmg a moderate\r\neffect, but not so those of which the effect is either very slight or very great.\r\nBut for our immediate purpose the point is one of academic\r\nhiterest only, and I am well content to leave it in abeyance, pending\r\nfurther evidence, and to base my judgment that Feda and Uvani are secondary personalities on the coimtersimilarity of the reaction\r\ntimes alone.\r\n27\r\nThat this judgment is correct receives strong collateral support\r\nfrom an experiment by Dr T. W. Mitchell, which he kindly allows me\r\nto describe.\r\nIn the course of a sitting with Mrs Leonard, Dr Mitchell instructed\r\nFeda that whenever during the immediately subsequent conversation, etc., Mrs Leonard being then in her normal condition, he should\r\nlay special stress on the word you hi addressing her (Mrs Leonard) \u2014as by askmg \u201c What do you think about it \u201d or the like\u2014she (Feda) was to acknowledge the signal by touching {i.e. causing Mrs Leonard\r\nto touch) a brooch she was wearing at the time. This duly occurred\r\nand the formal identity of the procedure with that of the familiar\r\ntype of \u201c post-hypnotic \u201d experiment is evident enough. It is clear\r\n342 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [partthat there is an intimate connection between Feda and NormalLeonartl which is not dissolved by the cessation of trance ; further,this connection is such that Feda may be aware of what happens toMrs Leonard hr her normal state and may participate importantlyin her actions.\r\nThis constitutes a weighty confirmation of the conclusion inferredfrom Countersimilarity, and the two taken together must, in myjudgment, be considered as settling the question of Feda\u2019s status as asecondary personality beyond any possibility of reasonable doubt.\r\n28\r\nThis conclusion, in the formation of which the quahtative indications of one method are supplemented by the quantitative results ofanother, constitutes, I venture to believe, an important advancein positive knowledge.\r\nIhit not less important is the fact that the evidence from Countersimilarity, which unmistakably proclaims that Feda and Uvani aresecondary personalities, assures us with equal emphasis that John,Etta and Dora are not\u2014or at least that these, if secondaries at all,are of a demonstrably different type.\r\nControls, as the term is used hi psychical research\u2014those \u201c slavesof the lam]),\u201d as it were, who habitually take charge as the medium\u2019snormal consciousness is superseded by the trance state\u2014are characterised by the property of coimtersirnilarity ; Communicators,jjurporthig to be discarnate entities particularly associated withindividual sitters, are not so characterised. Moreover, shice thephenomenon of countersimilarity seems to be the natural consequenceof that process of repression to which the formation of secondaryjjersonalities may confidently be ascribed, its absence m the case ofCommunicators leads us to suppose that some other mechanism is responsible for their development.\r\nThis again is in accordance with general psychological considerations ; for it would be straining the psycho-analytic conception ofre])ression very far to postulate for every Communicator purportingto manifest through Mrs Leonard a nucleus of repressed material notonly different from the others but a])pro])riate to the impersonationrequired.\r\n1 accortlingly conclude that Communicators, if and in so far as theyare not what they purport to be, are more in the nature of \u201c histrionic po.ses \u201d than secondary personalities in the ordinary sense oftliiit term.\r\n141 ] 1'he Q'uanlilative Study uf Trance Personalities 343\r\n29\r\nUnfortunately our only knowledge of \u201c poses \u201d is that derived\r\nfrom the Besterman-Gatty experiment, and this affords too narrow\r\na basis for any assured generahsation.\r\nThe following considerations, on the other hand, do seem to indicate fairly strongly that Communicators constitute a class of personality sui generis, possessiug properties which it is difficult to re- concile with their representing any plausible modification of the\r\nmedium\u2019s consciousness.\r\nThe tendency for disturbance hi reproduction to be associated with\r\nprolongation of reaction time was first noticed, I believe, by Jung\r\nin his early work on the word-association test. This was confirmed\r\nby my own experiments of 1920-21 ; for example, a group of 518\r\nwords gave the followmg distribution as regards long and short RT\r\nand success and failure hi RPN :\r\nLong Short Total\r\nSuccesses - - 149 221 370\r\nFailures 74 74 148\r\nTotals - 223 295 518\r\nwhence we have\r\nX\u201c = 4-08. B = -02 181\r\nwhich may be regarded as significant.\r\nIn the present instance I have comjiuted the degree of association\r\nbetween prolongation of reaction time and disturbance hi reproduction for each of the twenty personalities, or varieties thereof, for which\r\nappropriate data were available.

P--01 .\r\nfor the chance that this bias in the distribution is accidental.\r\n30\r\nThe matter is, however, rather more complicated than this suggests.\r\nWe may reasonably attribute the three exceptions (RN 190, 193,\r\n194) to the rule among non-commmiicators to chance. P is unre- hable at the best of times and in this case (First Thomas experiment)\r\nneither her reaction times nor her reproductions are properly\r\norganised (RN 44, 59). The same is true of Feda m the second\r\nThomas experiment (RN 48, 63), which yet contrives to give a value\r\nof P = -02 ; but RN 193 must, I thinli:, be attributed to the fortune of\r\nwar.But we cannot take this line with Etta\u2019s result from the first Thomas experiment and must regard her as m some way genuinely\r\ndifferent from John and Dora. I will discuss this when I have dealt\r\nwith these two.\r\nThe point I wish to make in this connection is this : Whenever we\r\nfind a significant association between RT and RPN\u2014as is usually\r\nthe case\u2014we must conclude that a smgle mind, or undivided part\r\nthereof, is at work ; i.e. that both reaction times and reproductions\r\nare, as it were, drawn from the same source. But if no significant\r\nassociation is found and yet the two sets of data are well individualised, we camiot ignore\u2014even if we are not prepared unreservedly\r\nto accept\u2014the strong imphcation that they come from different sources and are derived from two different minds.\r\nIn the light of these remarks, consider the contributions which go\r\nto make up RN 197. The reaction times are fairly well individualised\r\n(RN 50) ; but they are significantly similar to those of Normal\r\nLeonard (RN 73), and we must conclude that they are, in effect.\r\n346 Whaiely Carington, M.A., 31. 8c. [PABTcontributed by her. The reproductions are signihcaiitly well\r\norganised (RN 65), but it is titty to one agamst their being those of\r\nNormal Leonard (RN 88-2), and the strong suggestion is that theyare not contributed by her.\r\nAgain, consider the results given hi this context by Dora. Bothher reaction times (RN 54) and her reproductions (RN 69) are verysignificantly organised and cannot possibly be regarded as randomlydistributed. Her reproductions are mdubitably those of NormalLeonard (RN 125T) ; but even more emphatically (RN 115-2) her\r\nreaction times are not. We camiot possibly attribute these latter to\r\nchance and I find it very difficult to resist the conclusion that, hi this\r\ncase, two different minds are at work in the same prima facie personality, one of them being Mrs Leonard and the other someoneelse\u2014jiossibly the late Mrs W. S. Irving.\r\nThe same, of course, ap])lies to John with a slightly lesser emphasiscorresponduig to the relative weakness, numerically speaking, of the\r\nThomas as compared with the Irvhig results.\r\n31\r\nIn order to fit Etta (RN 199) into the scheme of things, wc must, I think, make one of two suppositions : we must either say that Ettais not a true Communicator within the meanuig of the act, and oughtto be placed in the other group ; or we must suppose that she hasbrought the art of communication, or whatever corresponds to this\r\nin non-spiritistic terms, to an appreciably higher pitch of perfection\r\nthan has either John or Dora, with the result that whereas each ofthese last is significantly infiuenced by the medium hi respect ofeither RT or RPN, she (Etta) is uidependent in respect of both.\r\nThe first of these alternatives seems to me to be frankly preposterous ; the second involves only a slight straining of the figures.\r\nThere is no question of Etta\u2019s reproductions being identical withthose of Leonard (RN 89-1)\u2014they are, on the contrary, very significantly different (RN 89-2)\u2014so that on the \u201c two contributors\r\n\u201d\r\ntheory advanced in the cases of John and Dora, we should expect to\r\nfind her reaction times significantly similar to Normal Leonard\u2019s,which they are not (RN 74-1), and this is also contrary to RN 199.\r\nOn the theory that Etta is emancipated hi both respects, we shouldexpect to find her reaction times significantly different from those ofNormal Leonard, but agaui (RN 74-2) this is not true. We must con-clude that one part or other of RN 74 is in error, in the sense thatchance cttcumstances have conspned to conceal either a similarity or a difference. But the strong association found between RT andRPN (RN 197 already cited) practically compels the supposition that\r\n14]] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 847\r\na single mind is at work, so that the minimum of distortion is in- volved in sup2)osing that RN 74-2 \u201c ought \u201d to show a significant\r\ndifference.\r\nThe view that Etta is somewhat more skilled at controlling the\r\nmedium than either John or Dora is also concordant with the history\r\nother development, the amount of practice she has had and (so far as the former is concerned) with various indications derived by Mr\r\nDrayton Thomas from a study of the responses given. I accordingly\r\nadopt it provisionally pending further evidence.\r\n32\r\nWe may summarise the outcome of the work to date as follows :\r\n1 . The Besterman-Gatty experiment shows clearly that significant\r\ndifference between two personalities in respect of either RT or RPN,\r\nor both, is not of itself\u2014as I had first supposed\u2014any evidence of their\r\nautonomy.\r\n2. The phenomenon of Countersimilarity is significantly associated\r\nwith Controls, but not with Communicators or with other types of\r\npersonality ; it implies a connection between the Controls and such\r\nelements as are common to the personalities with which they are compared, which can most reasonably be explained by supposing that\r\nthe former are secondary ])ersonalities of the mediums with whom\r\nthey are associated.\r\n3. As a general and very extensive rule, whenever we are dealing\r\nwith an evidently single ])ersonality, whether primary, secondary or a pose, we find a significant association between prolongation of\r\nreaction time and disturbance in reproduction. In the cases of John\r\nand Dora this is not found, although neither contribution can be\r\nregarded as randomly determined. In each case one of the contributions is clearly made by the medium\u2019s normal mind ; there is accordingly a strong suggestion that the other contribution comes from some extraneous source.\r\n33\r\nSo small a list of conclusions drawn so laboriously from so great a mass of work suggests the extraction of radium from pitch-blende,\r\nwhere some ten tons or so of material must l)e treated to produce a\r\nmilligram of the pure salt ; but it is to be hoped that they may be\r\ncorrespondmgly efiicacious in strilving a few sparks of light from the\r\ndull screen of our ignorance.\r\nI have said that I regard the establishment (for so I consider it) of the status of Feda and Uvani as secondary personalities as a notable advance in positive knowledge. I will add that I think it an\r\n348 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [partiin]>orta.iit ste]> toward sliowing (if it be a fact) that Coraimmicators\u00abuch as John, Etta and Dora are, in some respect at least, what theypurport to be. It is never any use saying \u201c That was not a monkey because it hadnot got a tail,\u201d unless you have established the possession of tails as a characteristic pro])erty of monkeys, and it is no use arguing thata Communicator is not a secondary personality, because it does notbehave like one, until yo\\i have found out how secondary personalities do in fact behave.\r\nI think we are now in a position to say firmly, \u201c John, Etta andDora are not secondary personahties because they do not show theproperty of countersimilarity to the other members of their group.\u201dWe could not do this before, because we knew of no property characteristic of secondary personalities by which to judge them. Thusthe decision that Feda and Uvani are secondaries is an essential preliminary to reasoned contention on these lines that John, Etta andDora are not. Spiritists will please note.\r\nAnd in response to the very proper suggestion that the commmiicators are histrionic poses, we may plausibly enquire why it is thatthey do not in general show the association of reaction time and re- ]:>roduction which seems to Ije\u2014as indeed we should expect\u2014thehall-mark of a single and undivided personality, and is actuallyshown by the two Gatty poses ? ^ The last thing I wish is to be dogmatic here, for if there is onething that is quite certain it is that the whole story is enormouslymore complicated than I at first imagined. Still, I feel strongly thatthe facts just referred to deserve to be taken very seriously indeed byall who have not hopelessly prejudged the issues involved by decidmgthat discarnate influence is \u201c impossible.\u201d\r\nMy own attitude is best indicated by continuing the quotationwith which this paper began : \u201c I have added a lot more, hut it was sea, not shy ; there\u2019s a boat\r\nfloativg on the top of it.\u201d Perhajos next time it will have turned out to he a parasol u'pside down. . . .

Those who look over his shoidder and iise the present partially developed pichirefor purposes outside science, do so at their own risk.\r\n^ Possibly, also, the strong covariance shown by these (RN 16.3\u2018.3) may prove an additional distinguishing criterion.\r\n141] The QmMifative Shtdy of Trance Persovalifies 349\r\nPakt IV\r\nVarious Observations and Comments\r\n34\r\nBccnmjyufation of the Thomm Exj)erim,ents.

Additional material was later obtained with a view to making good this\r\ndeficiency ; but in the interests of strict comparability I have\r\nthought it best to use the data from sittings I and III to VI only for\r\ncomputing S, D and C in all cases, though I have utilised\u2014rather\r\narbitrarily perhaps\u2014the additional material in working I for reaction\r\ntime throughout and for N, P and F in the case of reproductions.\r\nComparison with the figures given in Q.S.T.P., 1, which are now\r\nsuperseded, will reveal various discrepancies. These are mainly due\r\nto the modifications of treatment described in section 2 above, but a few actual errors were detected and remedied. These, however, do\r\nnot mvolve any reinterpretation and accordingly need not be further\r\nparticularised.\r\n35\r\nThe Irving Experiment. This consisted of five sittings conducted\r\nby Mr Irving on September 13, 15, 17, 18 and 20, 1934, at which data were collected from \u201cPrepared Leonard,\u201d \u201cFeda,\u201dand \u201cDora.\u201d Mrs\r\nLeonard in her fully normal state had previously been tested on August 13, 18, 20, 23 and 27 by Mr W. H. Wilson, to whom I am\r\nagain much indebted for his help in this matter.\r\nA list of 100 words was used throughout. In this list no word was\r\nused which appeared in the original list used for the Garrett and first Thomas Experiments, but it was derived from this by substituting\r\nfor each word some other which seemed likely to lie fairly closely\r\nassociated with it.

I rather expected to find a fair measure of similarity between thereactions to the two lists for the same personality ; but in this I wasdisappomted, as reference to RN 129 to 134 will show. The point,however, is of academic interest only and not relevant to the mamissues which interest us here.\r\nThe results obtained were extraorduiarily good\u2014far superior inprecision and \u201c clear-cutness \u201d to those of the first Thomas experiment, with which they may most fairly be compared.\r\nThis is evident by inspection of the relevant portions of Table II,but it is interesting to note that significant results (takmg P = -01 asthe criterion) are significantly more frequent in the Irving than in thefirst Thomas experiment.

In Q.S.T.P., I, p. 189, 1 commented some-what unfavourably onRudi\u2019s tendency to react with words apparentlydetermined not by the stimulus word j ust given but by that immediately preceding it or removed by only one or two places in the hst.I think I ought in fairness to say that the same tendency is to beobserved in Prepared Leonard (a fact which I had not previouslyremarked), while Rudi\u2019s very low values of I for reaction time(RN 1 43, 144 and compare 44, 45, 46) support the view that althoughostensibly normal he was actually in the lightly dissociated statewhich seems to be characteristic of P,\r\nOn the other hand, I see no reason for supposing and much fordoubting that Olga is even a Control, still less a Communicator, hi thesense in which the terms are used here. On the whole, it seems to meprobable that Olga represents a kind of semi-dream state of which\r\n141] The. Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 351\r\nRudi may retain vague and fragmentary memories. This view,\r\nwhich would more or less imply a condition of doubt on Rudi\u2019s part\r\nas to what happened in the trance state and who was resj)onsible for\r\nit, would account for his evident apprehensiveness on the subject of\r\nfraud and exposure without requiring us to postulate deliberate nmla\r\nfdes in the ordinary sense.\r\n37\r\nThe Psycho-galvanic Reflex. This phenomenon, of which, on the\r\nbasis of earlier experience, I expected great things when I started\r\nthis work, has proved definitely disappointing as an instrument of\r\nresearch. It has been found almost impossible to obtain from any\r\nsubject (except Rudi and Olga) a compact and gapless block of\r\nreadings of reasonable size such as is required for statistical analysis.\r\nThis involves resorting to a variety of expedients and artifices, such\r\nas the use of \u201c 1 or 0 \u201d methods, which seriously reduce the value of\r\nthe results obtained.\r\nAt first I thought that physico-physiological causes, such as\r\npolarisation at the electrodes, were to blame, but it now seems fairly\r\nclear that purely psychological factors\u2014notably boredxnn\u2014are\r\nchiefly responsible. Mr Glatty came to substantially this conclusion \u2014largely, I gather, on introspective grounds ; while it is shared, I understand, by Mr J. C. Maby, who has done much work with the\r\nreflex under a variety of conditions.\r\nThe view is perhaps a trifle difficult to reconcile with the almost\r\nuniform success of my experiments in 1920-21, though the differ- ences in the type of person examined may be an important factor\r\nhere ; on the other hand, it receives a certain support from the behaviour of Rudi and Olga, whose relatively high performance may be\r\nattributed to their being kept well keyed up, as it were, by the\r\nperiodical stimulation of the \u201c suspicion words.\u201d\r\nFurther work on the reflex is clearly desirable, with special refer- ence to the question of whether countersimilarity is shown by it, and\r\nit seems likely that this can better be studied by using short lists of\r\nwords on numerous occasions and at short intervals rather than by a few experiments with long lists.\r\n38\r\nInfluence of the Sitter. We hear so much m the literature of\r\npsychical research about \u201c telepathy from the sitter \u201d that it seemed worth while attempting to ascertain whether there was any\r\nappreciable similarity between the reactions given by Mr Drayton\r\n2a\r\n352 Whatehj Garhigton, M.A., M.Sc. [pabtTliomas ami Mr Irving and those obtained from the personalitieswhom they tested.\r\nThis did not occur to me till after the first series of experimentshad been completed ; consequently Mr Drayton Thomas\u2019s reactionswere not collected until he himself had repeated the lists ad nauseamin the course of collecting data. Mr Irving, on the other hand, wastested not only Ijefore he conducted his experiments, but before hehad seen the test words at all. This was done by Mr J. W. Harrison,of Newent, to whom I am greatly obliged for the trouble taken inthe matter.\r\nIt will be seen by reference to Table II (RN 81 to 85 ; 96 to 100 ; 119 to 122), that there is no appreciable similarity whatever betweenMr Irving and Dora, or between Mr Drayton Thomas and John andEtta.\r\nI do not know what effects telepathy (assuming this to be a factat all) may produce in other contexts, but there is certainly no excusefor attributing to it the phenomena described in this paper ; whileone cannot help feelmg that, if it were so potent a cause as is oftenclaimed in other connections, some reasonable measure of similaritywould have been found here.\r\nBut ardent spiritists should note that any construing of this re-mark into the sense of \u201c telepathy hypothesis disproved,\u201d or the lilm,would constitute a gross and unwarrantable perversion of what Ihave said.\r\n39\r\nComputation of Mr Hereward Carrington\u2019s Data. It seemed to meunfortunate that the nvimerous flowers of fact so laboriously gatheredby Mr and Mrs Carrmgton should Ije allowed to waste their sweetnesson the desert air when a little instructed distillation would ensuretheir jjerfume being preserved for posterity. I accordingly decidedto a])ply ap])ropriate methods to as much as possible of the publishedmaterial.\r\nAs it ha])pens, Mr Carrington\u2019s data proved, in a way, pecidiarlysuitable for this purpose, because, although they were of so fragmentary a character that few yielded an intrinsically reliable result,yet the net had Ijeen so widely spread that a relatively large numberof results (54 in all) could be calculated of which the sign was observable. From these, as explauied in section 20 above, it is possible toconclude with reasonable assurance that countersimilarity occurswith Uvani as well as with Feda.\r\nMr Carrington\u2019s observations have thus provided an invaluablecontribution to the material available for analysis.\r\n141 ] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 353\r\n40\r\nExperiment with Mrs Salter. This constitutes a kind of digression\r\nfrom the main course of the work, and was imdertaken mainly be- cause it was felt that it would be interesting, on general grounds, to\r\nsee whether the method was capable of showing appreciable differences between the normal state and that in which automatic\r\nwriting, as opposed to full-blooded mediumship, occurs. The results obtained (Table III, RN 141, 142, 148, 149, 159, 162) are chiefly remarkable for the fact that they are unique among those\r\nhitherto collected in showing significant similarity and significant\r\ndifference in respect of both reaction time and reproduction. This,\r\nof course, is what \u201c ought \u201d to be observed in every case in which any\r\nconsiderable change takes place yet leaves the roots of the mdividual\r\nimimpaired. Usually, however, instabihty and restlessness introduce\r\nso much error that the effects are obscured ; whereas Mrs Salter is so constant in either state as to constitute a veritable model of statistical\r\npropriety.\r\nThe psychological status of the \u201c automatic \u201d condition is not easy\r\nto assess precisely in the existing state of our knowledge. It shows\r\nno trace of countersimilarity, and there is a strong association between reaction time and reproduction (RN 187), while generally\r\nspeaking\u2014and especially in the strong covariance in reproduction\r\n\r\nthe relationship between the two states seems to resemble that between the two Gatty poses more closely than anything else available\r\nfor comparison.\r\nVery tentatively, I should regard it as a kind of \u201c fantasy \u201d condition\u2014midway, perhaps, between a pose and a dream\u2014rather than as a Control or Communicator m embryo.\r\nPart V\r\nInterim Note : Apparent Autonomy of John and Etta\r\nSince writing the above, I have had the opportunity of comparing\r\ncertain data obtained by Mr Drayton Thomas in sittings with Mrs\r\nSharplin with the figures of the original Leonard sittings.\r\nAt these Sharphn sittmgs, John and Etta purported to take\r\ncontrol and were tested on three occasions each with the first fifty\r\nwords of my first list. Mrs Sharplin herself was similarly tested on two occasions only. The experiment is accordingly on a small scale\r\nand not to be regarded as more than exploratory. None the less the\r\nresults are very remarkable.\r\n354 Whately Caringtnn, M.A., M.Se. [PAETThe vital question here, of course, is whether the J and E manifesting through Mrs Shar])lin show any signs of a non-chancercsemhlance to tlie J and manifesting through Mrs Leonard.\r\nThe actual similarities are :\r\nReaction Times Reproductions\r\nz P ?\u2022 JJ - -0845 -275 -0843\r\nEE - -1892 -095 -1832\r\nz P r \u20220965 -250 -0962\r\n\u20221997 -080 -1973\r\nHere z is the familiar \u201c similarity z \u201d and P, as usual, the probability of obtaining a value of this magnitude and sign by chancealone, while r is the corresponding correlation coefficient obtainedfrom z by Professor Fisher\u2019s transformation\r\nr = (e23_ l)\/(e2\u00ab +1).\r\nThere is naturally no reason, a priori, why the two J\u2019s or the twoE\u2019s should show a positive rather than a negative correlation in\r\nrespect of either RT or RPN and the fact that all four coefficientsare positive indicates fairly strongly that a non-chance cause is atwork.\r\nWe naturally suspect similarity between the mediums, sincepersonalities similar to similar personalities would be likely to besimilar to each other.\r\nThe similarity between Normal Leonard and Sharplin is, in fact,\r\ndistinctly high, for we have\r\nReaction Times Reproductions\r\nz P )\u2022 z P r LS - -2972 -020 -2888 -2262 -055 -2225\r\nI think we can eliminate the effect of this similarity by the methodof partial correlation. Writing, in each case, 1 for the Leonardversion of the communicator concerned, 2 for the Sharplin version,\r\n3 for Leonard and 4 for Sharplin, we apply the usual formula\r\n^ ab ^ac^bc\r\n' ab-C\r\nin which stands for \u201c the coefficient of correlation between aand 1) after eliminating the influence of c \u201d and calculate successivelyrj 2\r\n- 4 , and r,3\r\n. 4\r\n. From these, by again using the same formula,we obtain rj 2\r\n. 34 , namely the coefficient of correlation between theLeonard and Sharplin versions of the communicator concerned after\r\neliminating the influence of the similarity between Leonard andSharplin.\r\n141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 355\r\nWe thus obtain (the whole process being four times repeated)\r\nReaction Times Reproouctions\r\nr' P\r\nJJ - -09290 -261\r\nBE - -22276 -060\r\n\/ P\r\n-03026 -418\r\n-11649 -214\r\nthe P\u2019s being calculated from the correspondmg values of z' with\r\ntwo fewer degrees of freedom to allow for the two variables eliminated.\r\nAs is to be expected, all these values of r' are somewhat less than\r\nthe original values of r ; but all are positive and, from the statistical\r\npoint of view, the personalities and tests appear to be independent.\r\nIt accordmgly seems legitimate to take the continued product of the\r\nvalues of P as giving the overall chance of the observed similarities\r\nof J with J and E with E in the two tests being fortuitous.\r\nThis product is -0014, so that the chance of fortuitous occurrence\r\nis no more than about one in 714.\r\nIt is interesting to note that Etta is again distinctly the better\r\nperformer (cf. section 31 above).\r\nIf the procedure be admitted valid, I see no escape (or, strictly,\r\nonly one in 714) from the conclusion that non-chance, non-Leonard,\r\nnon-Sharplin factors are at work behind the scene, and from this it\r\nis but a trifling step to supposing that these factors are what they\r\nclaim to be\u2014namely \u201c John \u201d m the one case and \u201c Etta \u201d in the\r\nother\u2014or just possibly a kind of joint personality combining the two.\r\nThe only alternative would be to suppose that Mrs Sharplin has\r\ncontrived to impersonate the Leonard Communicators, not as regards words and behaviour (where the resemblance, I understand,\r\nwas definitely poor) but in hesitations on particular words and\r\nfailures to reproduce particular replies. Personally, I should regard\r\nthis as far more fantastic than the straight paranormal interpretation, and I have httle doubt that most others would do so too. On the other hand, while I pubhsh these results as a matter of the\r\nutmost general uiterest, I do so with very great reserve. I must\r\nconfess to some surprise at obtaining so well-marked an mdication\r\nso easily, and although I can detect no flaw in the argument at\r\npresent, I should not be too surprised if one were to be discovered,\r\nor if the more extended experiments now planned were to fail to\r\nconfirm the result.\r\nSo I venture to uisist that nothing I have said here is to be used\r\nin evidence agamst me later, pending confirmation or the reverse. At the same time, if there is no hidden pitfall in the work, it would\r\nappear to constitute the strongest objective evidence in favour of\r\nthe autonomy of communicators that has yet been obtained.\r\n356 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc.

Cecil Maby, B.Sc., A.E.C.S.\r\nHaving studied with the greatest interest Mr Whately Carington\u2019stwo papers on the Quantitative Analysis of Trance Personalities, aswell as having been so fortunate as to correspond with Mr Caringtonand Mr Drayton Thomas (as chief observer in the Leonard sittings),and to be permitted to examine some of the word-response and re-action-time sheets, I should like to make a few friendly queries andsuggestions regarding the actual data and experimental techniqueemployed in this work. Nor am I, it appears, alone in this matter,judging from discussions that I have had with several other gentlemen in a position fairly to evaluate the experimental aspect of theinvestigation.\r\nIt was at once evident that such an enquiry would both attractgeneral psychological attention and carry considerable weight. Itwas equally evident, however, that, no matter how infalhbly andscrupulously the data were manipulated mathematically, there werebound to exist certain problematical issues, upon both the psychoanalytical and experimental sides, that would require very carefulconsideration before final deductions might quite safely be made byquantitative analyses. Such a consideration is the aim of the presentnote.\r\nIt so ha|)pened that I, myself, had for several years been engagedin psychoanalytical problems and experimental methods nearlycoincident with those here in question, but employing \u201c normal \u201deveryday subjects, picked at random\u2014of various ages and both sexes\u2014rather than trance personalities. On the publication of Mr Carington\u2019s first paper, therefore, I decided at once to repeat his wordassociation tests, with reaction times and psychogalvanic reflexes,on several suph normal subjects. The results of these experimentscannot\u2014as space is limited\u2014be given here, but I may say that theysufficed to confirm certain doubts that I felt already as to the possiblevalue of the emphical data used by Mr Carington in his analyses ofthe trance personalities. His reassurance on these heads wouldtherefore be welcome.\r\n(1) In order to exclude telepathy\u2014a highly probable affair underthe circumstances\u2014between the operator and the subject, thestimulus words should preferably be printed on white cards,362\r\n[part 141 ] Note on Mr Carinrjtov's Investigation 363\r\nshuffled (face down) by the operator, and presented one at a time to\r\nthe view of the subject, in a standardised manner, so that the operator\r\nhimself is unaware of the word under presentation d The subject\u2019s\r\nreply would then be unbiased by any idea in the operator\u2019s mind, unless, indeed, the operator were also a good clairvoyant\u2014which, I believe, he was not in the present case, especially under the foreconscious preoccupation of the tests. In the present instance the subject\u2019s eyes were closed, so that some\r\nother mechanical method would have to be adopted. Nevertheless,\r\nthe point is a most important one.\r\n(2) Mr Carington was not, I gather, himself present or acting as operator at the various sittings ; the actual observations having\r\nbeen made by Messrs Besterman, Drayton Thomas, and others.\r\nWhatever the reason for this procedure, and no matter how expert\r\nand scrupulous the actual operators may have been, one feels that\r\nMr Carington would have further benefited, as regards detailed\r\nknowledge of the circumstances attending each sitting and the\r\nindividual reactions, by himself being present at the tests. Experience with far less complex cases has long taught me this vital\r\nnecessity.\r\n(3) The psychogalvanic reflex is fraught with great difficulties ; and, granted -a smoothly working apparatus, a steady and also re- sponsive ^ subject, an experienced operator (who must also interpret\r\nand sift the data as they accumulate), this reflex still remains insufficiently understood in all its complex significance to be employed\r\nin any routine tests, and upon such difficult psychological subjects.\r\nI say this with all deference to Mr Carington\u2019s own long experience\r\nof the psychogalvanic reflex, in view of general and personal experi- ence of the reaction. Mr Carington himself has also admitted, in\r\ncorrespondence, that this approach is a difficult and unreliable one. Even the most responsive subjects rapidly become \u201c bored,\u201d emotionally speaking, so that their reflexes tend to fall off progressively,\r\nboth throughout a single recitation of a word Ust (or other series of\r\nmonotonous stimuli) and also from sitting to sitting\u2014even if separated by days or weeks. ^ The effect is greatest at first and\r\n^ It is easy to make a mechaiiical device for doing this, which can be clamped\r\non the front edge of the operator\u2019s table or desk. Stop-watch timing is done as\r\nusual.\r\n^ As a rule, the more responsive the less steady the subject is, and conversely.\r\nHence the practical impossibility of rehable routine observations on a suitably\r\nsensitive subject.\r\n\u00ae By taking the mean galvanic reflex or mean reaction time in verbal re- sponse for a given word list, a very perfect \u201c mental facilitation \u201d curve may\r\nbe obtained. The writer hopes, shortly, to pubUsh an account of such tests in a psychologicalj ournal\r\n.\r\n364 J. Cecil Maby, B.Sc., A.R.C.S. [partrapidly declines in a given sitting. Wechsler and Jones (see pp. 223-4of W. W. C.\u2019s first paper) appear to be justified in their statement,that position in a serial list is of considerable importance. There isno cut and dried \u201c starting effect.\u201d Thus, sooner or later, one is leftwith no reflexes at all, or, if present, they can be shown to be theresult almost entirely of the mere neuro-muscular effort of articulated word response, and are hence quite small, and all almostequal in magnitude ; while all emotional or \u201c meaning \u201d content islacking, except in connection with one or two words only from sucha list. The few values for p.g. reflexes given by Mr Carington for MrsGarrett and Herr Rudi Schneider strongly suggest, by theirsmallness, that such reflexes were mainly due to articulationand not to emotional significance. If the former, they wouldhave occurred some 2 secs, after the spoken response (not thestimulus word), and would have ceased if the spoken response weresuppressed.\r\nPersonally I always mistrust and discount such small reflexeswhen working at high instrumental sensitivity.\r\n(4) A change of mood in the operator, a change of operator, oreven an accidental change of tone, clarity or sharpness in theenunciation of a given stimulus word would (I find from actual tests)considerably modify the resultant reaction times or p.g. reflexes.Since all these variable factors clearly entered into the presenttests, the numerical values obtained will undoubtedly be disturbedaccordingly, and hence rendered of questionable value. Such a stateof affairs is suggested by the variability of the actual values in con-nection with any given word. {See below.)\r\nIn so far as these changes are apt to modify the reaction valuessteadily in one direction or the other (in normal subjects), statisticalanalysis of the data should not mask the effects ; it can also minimise errors about a mean. But although such a method permits usto draw such conclusions as are quantitatively possible, systematicerror will not be evaded. As I suggested with regard to the possibletelepathic factor, it would be desirable to make such valuableinvestigations as criticism-proof as possible : \u2014and it is only for suchreasons that the present Note has been submitted, I need hardlyremark.\r\n(5) Brief study of the word reaction times for the Leonard groupof personalities showed the followmg important points, to which Ido not recollect Mr Carington having called attention :\r\n(a) The trance personalities gave reaction times too high fornormality or reliability, as compared with any of my ordinary subjects, tested on the same word list.\r\n365 141] Note on Mr CaringtoNs Investigation\r\nE.g. these approx, values : Ln - l\"-2\u20142\"-8 (mean l\"-75)\r\nLp - 2\"-l\u20147\"-l (mean 3\"-95)\r\nF - 2\"-5\u20147\"-8 (mean 4\"-20)\r\nCf. my normal subjects, who gave between 0\"-5 and 3\"-0 (mean\r\nl\"-2). Note the resemblance between Lp and F, and great difference\r\nfrom Ln\u2014as also indicated by my actual word analyses [see below)\r\nand Mr Carington\u2019s quantitative investigation. Note also that Ln\r\ngave the most normal reaction times, and most normally distrilmted.\r\n{b) The reaction times in connection with any particular stimulus\r\nword were extremely variable\u2014far too much so for normal straightforward response, which is generally under 3\" at hmit\u2014or else no\r\nanswer at all\u2014and relatively constant from sitting to sitting with\r\nrespect to each given word.\r\nEither (1) Special retardation owing to the trance state,\r\n(2) Wandering of thought from the natural reflex replies, or\r\n(3) Conscious dehberation of a suitable answer is here implied, I think.\r\n(c) The mean reaction time (for all words) on any given occasion\r\noften varied markedly frotn one personality to another, but was\r\nreasonably consistent for each personality individually, it seemed.\r\nThese divergences were far greater than for any normal subject\r\nin a variety of moods, states and conditions, and often varied m a\r\nrather extreme manner as compared with 20-30% changes under\r\nextreme circumstances for a normal subject, according to my data.\r\nThis mutually distinctive character (as to mean time) between the\r\nvarious personalities ^ would appear to be a signiflcant point\r\nphysiologically incomprehensible, unless the whole organism of the\r\nmedium be supposed to change with each assumed personality.\r\nMr Carington, in the process of his statistical method, by taking\r\nthe mean of the lot for each personality, and then subtracting each\r\nindividual word-value from that mean, etc., would surely eliminate\r\nsuch detailed inter-personal distinction\u2014reducing them all to a common basic level. This is one of the points that Mr Dra}don\r\nThomas wished, I believe, to make after the reading of Mr Carington\u2019s second paper, but which was not quite clearly understood at\r\nthe time. Perhaps Mr Carington will kindly elucidate the point.\r\nSuch are the chief points upon which I personally\u2014and I believe\r\nothers amongst his readers\u2014would value a further explanation from\r\n^ The resemblance as to mean time between Lp and F, noted above, is due\r\nto averaging out the values for all sittings, en masse, and does not controvert\r\nthe distmction here noted.\r\n366 J. Cecil Mahy, B.Sc., A.R.G.S. [part 141 ]\r\n!\r\nMr Carington, and which I do not doubt that he will be in a positionto supply. ' For the rest, I shoidd add that an unbiased examination of theactual word responses and reaction times of the Leonard groupisuggested to me, as to Mr Drayton Thomas, that the several per-\\sonalities behaved in a remarkably self-distinctive manner. But a; |psychoanalysis of the reaction words (results and figures held over\u2018\r\nfor the time) certainly hinted\u2014as Mr Carington now concludes\r\nthat Feda might be a secondary sub-personality of Mrs Leonardherself. Otherwise, Messrs Carington\u2019s and Drayton Thomas\u2019smitial results were, in general, confirmed, so far as I could arrive atany fair conclusions by that rather micertam method.\r\nREPLY TO MR MARY\u2019S NOTE\r\nMr Maby does not indicate a single numerical result or interpretative\r\nconclusion with which he disagrees, so I take it that he just wants\r\nto tell us how much better it would have been if I had done it all differently.\r\nThe only thing he seems sure about is that my data are of imperfect relrabihty. He is perfectly right ; but he does not seem to\r\nrealise that the whole purpose of statistical treatment is to enable one to draw, if and in so far as it is possible, reliable conclusions\r\nfrom data which are individually susceptible to error ; while the\r\ntests of significance freely used ui this work, without which statistics are practically worthless, tell us precisely how far we have succeeded\r\nand just how reliable our result is. I have given, I think, three hundred and thirty-six numerical\r\nresults of one kind and another in the Tables and text of Q.S.T.P. II and every single one of these has a probability attached to it, telling\r\nthe reader just what the chance is of its being due to the unreliability {alias \u201c\r\nerror \u201d) which Mr Maby postulates. I can do no\r\nmore. That is my total answer to the whole \u201c unreliability \u201d story ; and\r\nif it is considerably my misfortmie, it is in no degree my fault, if Mr Maby (or others) are insufficiently acquainted with modern\r\nstatistical theory and practice to appreciate it. But I shall always\r\nbe most willing to learn from those who know the subject.\r\nAs regards specific points :\r\n1. Telepathy\r\n:\r\nWho is supposed to have telepathed what to\r\nwhom ? What feature of which result is due to this, and how did the\r\ntelepathing cause it ? Until I am told this, I cannot reply ; meanwhile, the available\r\nevidence {Q.S.T.P. II 38) suggests that telepathy was absent.\r\n2. My own absence from sittitigs : I do not agree. The experiments are behaviouristic, not psycho-analytical, and one of their\r\nchief aims has been to secure objectivity by eliminating personal\r\njudgments.\r\nIs it suggested {a) that if I had been present I would have recorded\r\ntimes, words or reproductions other than those actually given, or\r\n(b) that Mr Drayton Thomas, Mr Besterman or Mr Irving did so, or (c) that I would have faked the calculations into conformity\r\nwith my impressions ? 2 B 367\r\n368 Whaiely Carington, 31.A., 31. Sc. [part3. Psycho-galvanic reflex : Tliis has admittedly been disappointing{Q.S.T.P. II, 37) so I have dejjended on it very little. Mr Maby ignores totally the figures given by me in my commenton Wechsler and Jones {loc. cit.) and is necessarily unaware that I have applied a correction in all cases to deal with the effect hementions. (Q.S.T.P. II, \"lb.) In the case of Rudi and Olga, statistically significant similarities were obtained (RN 154, 155) which shows that the data were prettygood\u2014as inspection indicated. (Cf. Q.S.T.P. I, 15.)\r\nMy only other conclusion, namely that countersimilarity probablyextends to the reflex, is quite tentative. (Q.S.T.P. II, 26.)\r\nWith which of these conclusions does Mr Maby disagree ? Ifwith the first, how does he explain the significant residt, in spite ofthe correction for \u201c fatigue \u201d ? If with the second, would he ratherdraw a tentative conclusion opposed to the evidence than one in\r\naccordance with it, as I do ?\r\n4. Variability of operator, etc., etc. : The beauty of the techniqueknown as the Analysis of Variance, which I used in this work, lies in\r\nthe fact that\u2014as its name implies\u2014it permits one to analyse thetotal variability of the data into its component parts and to ascribeto each of the headings under which the material is classified its proper share of this. Whatever is not so ascribable constitutesError\u2014which may, indeed, be defined, for statistical purposes, asthe results of all causes which we cannot identify or in which we arenot interested.\r\nThus, in so far as the factors mentioned by Mr Maby are constantfor a given word, personality or occasion, they enter (as is proper)into the calculated quantities concerned with these ; but in so faras they are not constant they enter into the quantity OWP (see myfirst paper. Appendix II) which constitutes Error and is used as a\u201c yard stick \u201d to test whether observed differences are significant ornot. The obtaining of a significant difference is automatically aguarantee that the error (howsoever occasioned) is statistically smallcompared with the difference observed. 3Iutatis mutandis, similarconsiderations apply to similarities, etc. The latter part of this section (\u201c In so far as . . . not be evaded.\u201d)almost completely defeats me, but I think it is covered by what I have just said. In so far as \u201c these changes . . . modify the . . . values . . . steadily \u201d they will be sorted out by the analysis undertheir proper headings and eliminated ; in so far as they do sounsteadily they will automatically appear as Error\u2014which is justwhat one wants.\r\nThe technique employed is, I fear, a little more advanced thanminimising \u201c errors about a mean \u201d\r\n; but the drawing of \u201c such\r\n141 ] Beply to Mr Mahy\u2019\u2019f< Note 3cn\r\nconclusions as are quantitatively possible \u201d is, of course, exactly\r\nwhat it claims to do- -neither more nor less\u2014except for adding a statement of their value.\r\nAs regards the \u201c systematic error \u201d : Does Mr Maby suggest that\r\nthe experimenter has contrived to vary his \u201c tone, clarity or sharpness,\u201d etc., systematically with respect to a combination of personality and word ; and, if so, what reason has he for supposing\r\nthis ? If not, I fear I must baldly assert that every other sort of\r\nsystematic error ivill be eliminated ; those who doubt this must\r\nstudy the technique for themselves.\r\nSimilar considerations apply to most of Mr Maby\u2019s section 6,\r\nthroughout which\u2014as in the last\u2014he seeks to override calculation\r\nby inspection.\r\nI am only too pleased, of course, to concede the obvious point that\r\ntrance personalities and Prepared Leonard are much slower in re- sponse than normal persons (or even Normal Leonard\u2014herself,\r\nperhaps, a trifle slow). This is of some general interest but irrele- vant to the question of identity. But to say that the times are too\r\nlong \u201c for reliability \u201d is demonstrably false. I must repeat\r\n\r\nad\r\nnauseam, I fear\u2014that if the data were \u201c unreliable \u201d thev could not\r\nyield significant results, except by the inclusion of freak values which\r\nthe process of \u201c scaling \u201d removes. (Q.S.T.P. II, 2a.) Direct evidence on the point is added by the figures for \u201c Individuality \u201d in my\r\nsecond paper (notably RN 42 to 70), which are obtained by comparing\r\nthe inter-word differences for the various personalities with their\r\nsitting-to-sitting variations. These flatly refute Mr Maby\u2019s contention.\r\n{N.B. Prepared Leonard is admittedly not reliable\u2014as noted in\r\nthe text\u2014but the other personalities are satisfactory, with rare exceptions.)\r\nAs regards 5a : It would be mildly interesting if it could be shown\r\nthat Etta, say, gave consistently (to a non-chance extent) longer\r\ntimes than Feda or John, and that this could not be ascribed to\r\nfatigue {cf. my first paper, p. 236, note 37). Unfortunately, we are not so situated, and a whole new series of experiments would be\r\nnecessary to clear up the point. At best, however, it would be rather\r\nlike trying to identify individuals by their weight alone to the\r\nexclusion of all other anthropometrical data. The possible existence\r\nof detailed inter-personal distinctions is, of course, the whole motive\r\nfor analysing with respect to the different words. I strongly suspect\r\nthat Mr Maby has not merely missed this point, but completely\r\nfailed to understand the nature of the quantities calculated.\r\nAs a matter of interest, I have just made an ad hoc test to see whether there is any indication that the mean time for Feda is\r\n370 Wha.tely Carington, M.A., M.Se. [part 141]\r\nsignificantly greater than tliat for Etta, using the figures given in\r\nthe above-cited note. The chance of these figures differing fortuitously to the extent they do, having regard to the observed variation\r\nfrom occasion to occasion, is about -275. In other words, the dif- ference is very far from significant, even if we ignore the effect offatigue, which the figures so strongly suggest.\r\nThere is accordingly no justification (since this difference is thelargest observed between trance personalities in this experiment)for claiming that the overall mean time is in any way distinctively\r\ncharacteristic of the (trance) personality, though slow response is clearly a characteristic of the trance state as such.\r\nIn conclusion : There is any amomit of error in the data ; thatis the reason, and the only reason, why we use statistical methodsat all. These would be altogether unnecessary if the errors ofmeasurement were known to be small compared with the quantities\r\nin which we are interested\u2014as, usually, in weighing cheese for\r\nmouse-traps. But statistical methods may be worse than useless\r\nunless they not only give us the best estimate obtainable from thedata of the quantities which concern us but also tell us what theseestimates are worth, i.e. what is the chance that they have beenspuriously generated by the error in question.\r\nThanks to the ingenuity of professional statisticians, this is exactly what is done by the methods here employed ; they give usthe best available estimate and add a measure of its reliability basedon the amount of error actually found in the data used. Anyone whoimagines that any process whatsoever, statistical or otherwise, cando more than this cherishes an illusion ; in fact, any process oftreating measurements which does not include a test of significance\r\nnecessarily does less. The matter is one on which the enquirer may reasonably bereferred to text-books on statistics rather than to the Proceedings ofthis Society, and I certainly do not feel called upon to demonstrateit stej) by step\u2014apart from the fact that I am very doubtfullycapable of doing so. But as regards the validity of the results I have])ublished the position is very simple : To the question \u201c Are your data reliable ? \u201d I reply \u201cNot altogether,\u201d and if asked, \u201c To what extent does the unreliability vitiate\r\nyour results ? \u201d I answer \u201c Precisely to the extent indicated by thevalue of P which I have carefully attached to each of them. Idcirco\r\ngenueram.\u201d\r\nWlIATKLY CaRTNGTON.\r\nBottrbdam,\r\nJune, 1935.\r\nTHE WOKD ASSOCIATION EXPERIMENT WITH\r\nMRS OSBORNE LEONARD\r\nBy C. Drayton Thomas\r\nThe Response Words, showing characteristic reactions of Feda,\r\nJohn, Etta, Leonard.\r\nThe Responses Considered Numerically : Similarities and Differences.\r\nWhat the Figures Indicate.\r\nIn a recent paper entitled The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities {Proc. S.P.R., July 1934) and in a second paper printed above,\r\nMr Whately Carington describes and discusses a series of experiments in the association of words, some of which I conducted under\r\nhis guidance and at his suggestion with Mrs Osborne Leonard in the\r\nwinter of 1933-34.\r\nThose papers deal with figures. I am about to discuss the actual\r\nreply words given by the various personalities.\r\nThe course of the experiment was as follows : A list of 75 words prepared by Mr Carington was used at each of\r\nsix sittings. At each sitting I first read the list to Mrs Leonard before\r\nshe went into trance and wrote down her response to each successive\r\nword. When the fist was ended I immediately went through it again,\r\nmaking a note whenever Mrs Leonard gave a reply identical with\r\nthat given previously. I ignored all other replies that she made.\r\nThis second reading of the fist is termed the Reproduction Test.\r\nMrs Leonard\u2019s replies at this stage are shown as the responses of\r\nLp (Leonard prepared), because Mrs Leonard\u2019s mind may have been\r\nin some manner affected by her preparations for the sittuig.\r\nHaving completed this, I waited until Mrs Leonard was in trance\r\nand then repeated the above procedure with Feda. On finishing\r\nwith Feda I did the same with John and then with Etta as they in\r\nturn took personal control. The exact time for each reaction was\r\ntaken by stop-watch. Those reaction times do not affect the questions here to be considered and they are fully dealt with by Mr\r\nCarington.\r\nWhen the above six sittings were over I arranged with Mrs\r\nLeonard that she should allow me to go through the 76 words with\r\nher at a time removed by hours, or by days, from my sittings. This was for the purpose of ascertaining whether there would be any\r\n371\r\n372 C. Drayton Thomas [partmarked difference between her reactions when she was about to give a sitting and those taken when she was in the midst of householdoccupations and therefore, presumably, in a state of mind entirely\r\nnormal. Her replies on these six later occasions are shown as the\r\nresponses of Ln (Leonard normal). In addition to the 75 wordssix times repeated, we tried a short list of 50 further words and the\r\npresent study of reaction words is based on replies to both lists. When later in this paper I come to the counting of similarities anddifferences the longer list alone will be used.\r\nA long experience with Mrs Leonard led me to expect results of\r\nvalue and I was curious to see how far the personalities would retain\r\ntheir individual characteristics when bombarded with stimulus\r\nwords, each of which was virtually an inquiry into their experience,\r\nmemory and predilections. It had long been my wish to discover\r\nsome means of ascertaining the extent to which a communicator\u2019s\r\nconversation was influenced by its passage through the medium\u2019smind, or, to express it differently, to ascertain what proportion of a medium\u2019s mentality mingled with that of the communicator during\r\na sitting. It had always seemed to me that while the communicator supplied\r\nthe thought, the form of its expression depended largely upon the\r\nverbal furnishing of the medium\u2019s mind. Was the result two-thirds\r\ncommunicator and one-third medium, or, if the proportion varied\r\naccording to circumstances, what was the average infiltration from\r\n3Irs Leonard while my communicators were sjieaking ? The j3roposed experiment might perhaps show statistically to\r\nwhat extent communicators are able to remain isolated from the\r\nmedium, and, conversely, what degree of mental osmosis takes place\r\nduring a sitting. It will be observed that I assume the reality of communication\r\nwith departed friends.

It doesn\u2019t interest Feda.\r\nGladys is always thinking of it. You see, I doesn\u2019t like land,\r\nmuch land isn\u2019t interesting.\u201d\r\n376 G. Drayton Thomas [partMrs Leonard had lately bought land at Tankerton and wasbuilding there.\r\nDoor-Curtain : \u201c Nicer than a door.\u201d\r\nBring-kSalver : Not understanding this owing to unusual pronunciation, I asked Feda to repeat. She gave the same word. I thenasked what it meant. She replied thus, \u201cWe brings it ; beatencopper or brass or silver. Beaten silver is nicest. We hadbeaten brass most. When a slave brings you a letter he bringsit on a salver.\u201d\r\nWicked- Gaekwar ; Not being sure I heard aright, I asked its meaning.Feda said, \u201c A man. He was a naughty man.\u201d\r\nYellow-Roof : \u201c Near where I lived there was one with a bright goldroof.\u201d\r\nNoise-Drums ; \u201cYou would never forget them if you had heardthem as Feda has.\u201d\r\nBroud-Warrior : \u201c He is proud, yes he is very proud.\u201d\r\nFray-Mat ; \u201c That is what you always have to pray on, a nice little mat.\u201d\r\nBath-Jade ; \u201c Princes has them.\u201d\r\nHill-Himalaya : \u201c The only hill I ever knew.\u201d\r\nTown-Simla : \u201c Yes, I was born there, when I was young I heard alot about it. I don\u2019t know the town but a place near there.\u201d\r\nCall-Eunuch : (Claps hands) \u201c You clap and they have got to come.\u201dKiss-Noses : (Why do yon say that, Feda ?) \u201c Because I have heardof somebody that does it. Black people does it, we do not do it, we aren\u2019t coloured people, we are only brown.\u201d\r\nPool-Drown : \u201c That\u2019s better than drowning people in the wells ! \u201dVeil-Yashmak : \u201c It is what you puts in front of your face.\u201d\r\nSing-Samisen : \u201cIt is what you sings to. When you sings you playsa samisen, and yon go tinka, tinlva, tink\u2014like that.\u201d\r\nDead-Pyre : \u201c We should not be put on it now. It was stupid.Some of the widows that was put on the pyre was nicer than theman who died. But they didn\u2019t want to go\u2014some of themdidn\u2019t.\u201d\r\nBook-Tablet ; \u201c They used to make books of tablets. We used tohave some kind of stuff like ivory.\u201d\r\nBmy-Serf : \u201c You buries them and not bother about them much.\u201dWicked-Hyderabad : \u201c He was a very nasty man. Poisoned.\u201d\r\nAs I was uncertain about some things implied in the foregoing, I questioned an Indian student and also an Fnglishman long residentin India. Their replies are hero given.\r\nEunuch. \u201c In wealthy Mohamedan houses eunuchs used to beemployed about a hundred years ago. I have seen some of them\r\n141 ] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 377\r\ngoing about, but do not know wbat they do. They are generally\r\nconsidered by the average man as objects of pity.\u201d\r\nSlaves. \u201c The idea of slaves came to India with the Mohaniedan\r\ninvasion. Even when slaves were being used, only the rich Mohaniedans used to have them. Slaves were never common in India.\u201d\r\nDrums. \u201c Drums are played on practically every occasion among\r\nthe lower middle class people, in marriages or special festivities and\r\nsometimes before a funeral procession.\u201d\r\nTablets for writing. \u201c I do not know if, or when, paper superseded\r\ntablets. Bark was used in early centuries, and palm leaves are still written upon in the villages.\u201d\r\nMud buildings. \u201c Even now a good many houses in small villages are built of mud ; a brick house with tiles is a luxury except in fairly\r\nlarge towns.\u201d\r\nPrayer Mats. \u201c Among Mohamedans the mat consists of an ordinary cloth. The Hindus use either a mat or sometimes a skin.\u201d\r\nBlessing water. \u201c Yes, there is a custom of blessing water.\u201d\r\nMule. \u201c The mule is used for carrying loads only and so is kept in\r\nthe stables of rich people. I have rarely seen it. Ordinary people\r\nemploy horses or bullocks.\u201d\r\nPainting fingers and toes. \u201c This is a common custom in India\r\nand has been for ages.\u201d\r\nSalver. \u201c A tray, not necessarily large, is commonly used in great\r\nhouses by servants to bring letters or visiting cards. But this\r\ncustom is observed only in very rich houses, especially among the\r\nMohamedans.\u201d\r\nI asked whether there was in India anything corresponding to the\r\nAfrican Witch Doctor, and if so, whether the terms would be interchangeable among country folk. \u201cYes, but in very remote parts and smallest villages. He is not\r\nso important as in Africa. The Witch Doctor and Black Magician\r\nare almost interchangeable terms among the country folks.\u201d\r\nSamisen. The meaning of this word is unknown to me. Feda ex- plained that it was an instrument to which one sang. According to\r\nthe dictionary is seems to have one, two or three strings, a sort of\r\nprimitive banjo used in the East, especially Japan and China. Long\r\nafter the experiment I introduced the word in conversation with\r\nMrs Leonard. She appeared to be unfamiliar with it and said that it suggested nothing but the title of some old song.\r\nGaekwar. This is the family name of the rulers of Baroda, and has,\r\nby the English, been converted into a dynastic title. Since Baroda\r\nis some five hundred miles from Simla, which Feda claims as her\r\nnative district, it might be asked whether she would be likely to have\r\n378 C. Drayton Thomas [partheard the term in her lifetime. One cannot say, yet it is not improbable ; for the dynasty was foimded by a succession of warriors duringthe first half of the eighteenth century, and news of such an eventwould spread throughout northern India. Here I may quote fromthe Enc. Brit. : \u201c The princes of Baroda were one of the chiefbranches of the Mahratta confederacy, which in the eighteenthcentury spread devastation and terror over India. . . . During thelast thirty-two years of the century the house fell a prey to one ofthose bitter and unappeasable family feuds which are the ruin ofgreat Indian families.\u201d\r\nThese events happened shortly before the period which Fedaindicates as that of her earth life, and may possibly explaiu why shenow associates Gaekwar and the Prince with the stimulus word\u201c wicked.\u201d\r\nIt is true that the title Gaekwar is familiar to English people, butFeda used it in an entirely appropriate connection. It is to be notedthat she did not use the word Maharajah, which is equally well knownand which is particularly familiar to Mrs Leonard because a Maharajah and his wife were at one time regular visitors.\r\n2. John\r\nMy father, John Drayton Thomas, was a Methodist minister forforty years before he retired from active work, but he continued totake services up to the day before his death in 1903. When I beganto study mediumship in 1917, the most regular and skilled of thecommunicators identified himself with my father and proceeded togive evidence which I consider to be logically compelling. Duringthe mtervenmg seventeen years he has continued to speak with me,principally through Mrs Leonard, both by using her control, Feda,and by taking personal control himself.\r\nHe expressed the utmost willingness to take part in the wordassociation experiment and I now give a selection of his reactions.\r\nA glance at the fist of reaction words shows a number which relateto the work of the ministry, among them the following :\r\nBible. Scripture. Testament. Ministry. Missionary. Mission.Chapel. Vestry. Aisle. Choir. Sermon. Preach. Visits. Class.Preaching. Truth. Evil. Hymn. Psalm. Communion. Collection.\r\nBuild : CHAPEL, mission. Mission.\r\nYoung : class, minister, assistant, missionary.\r\nSpeak : Sermon, carefully, audibly, carry.\r\nTo the last he added that he always felt the importance ofmaking the voice carry.\r\n141\r\n] Word AssociaMon Experiment with, Mrs 0. Leonard. 379\r\nBlack : suit. suit. coat. coat.\r\nMy father dressed in black throughout the whole of his\r\nministerial life, and was very jiarticular about it. Wine : Supper. Bread. Communion.\r\nBook : Bible. Bible, scriptures, moppat.\r\nMy father admired the outstanding missionaries, and especially Moffat. He once gave me a book on Moffat\u2019s work.\r\nSing : Hymn. Psalm, mission. Choir.\r\nWindow ; Chapel, vestry.\r\nRead ; Testament, testament.\r\nTravel : Circuit. Circuit.\r\nGo : Circuit. Circuit. Circuit.\r\nEach Methodist minister is sent to work in a locality which\r\nis termed his Circuit. At the expiration of a few years he must\r\ngo to a different Circuit. Ministers who thus move aliout are termed \u201c travelling preachers,\u201d and the term \u201c to travel \u201d is used in that sense. A minister is said to have \u201c travelled\r\n\u201d\r\nsuch-and-such a number of years, i.e. the period dtuing which\r\nhe has been in the ministry.\r\nWalk : Long. long. Long.\r\nLong : Walk. Sermon.\r\nAlthough such associations as these are too trite to be evidential, it is worth noting how jieculiarly they ap]dy to my\r\nfather. He certainly preached long sermons and he delighted\r\nin long walks. For many years he constantly walked long\r\ndistances to fulfil preaching appointments ; he was jiroud of\r\nhis speed and endurance. After his death I found a detailed\r\nrecord of the miles he had walked in the forty years of his\r\nministry.\r\nThe following are strongly reminiscent of my father\u2019s character,\r\nteaching and practices :\r\nBet ; Silly, never. Say : truth, sermon. Preach. Truth.\r\nLove : obey. Teaching, honour, neighbour.\r\nLife : bright, busy. Habits, routine.\r\nSilly : Foolish.\r\nHe then added, \u201c Foolish \u201d was more my word than \u201c silly.\u201d\r\nThis I remember was so. Beer : Bad. Stupid.\r\nMy father was a strongly convinced total abstainer.\r\n3 so C. Drayton Thomas [partThe following I>il)lical associations are too well known to require(\u2018luciclation : Lamp : Wise.\r\nBread : Stone.\r\nRich : NEEPLE. Needle. Camel.\r\nTree : Bay.\r\nWe now come to reactions suggestive of particular memories.\r\nTown : bath. Newport, taunton. bath.\r\nMy father was educated at Bath. He married from Newportand I was born at Taunton.\r\nStreet : Newport, row. Our residence in my early childhood was at Yarmouth, whereour house was close to some of the famous Rows. These arenarrow alleys connecting wider streets. Village : Island.\r\nOnly once in his forty years\u2019 ministry did my father reside in avillage, and that was in the Isle of Wight. At all other timeshe was in towns or cities.\r\nGirl : HETTFE. ETTA. ETTA.\r\nMy sister\u2019s name was Henrietta ; she was always called eitherHettie or Etta.\r\nBrother : Alfred. John. Alfred.\r\nAlfred was my father\u2019s favourite l)rother. John was an elderbrother who died in infancy and, as my father was the nextmale child, he was also called .lohn.\r\nBrown : circuit.\r\nThe Rev B. Browne worked with my father in the same cir- cuit, and there was an unusually close intimacy between them.Cook : COPPY.\r\nColloquial name for Co])p, a cook who was in our family forsome thirty years.\r\nFriend : Johnson.\r\nA common name and therefore likely to fit several friendshipsin the course of a long life ; this cannot therefore weigh asevidence. Yet it is peculiarly apposite here, for the Johnsonfamily were among our closest friends, Mrs Johnson presidingat my sister\u2019s birth. It is a name which would live in myfather\u2019s memory.\r\nPay : Stipend. Tin. quarter.\r\nMany stipends besides those of Methodist ministers are paidquarterly and the above reactions would have been without\r\n14-1] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 381\r\nsignificance had it not l)een for the inclusion of \u201c tin.\u201d I am\r\naware that the word is vulgarly used as synonymous with\r\nmoney, but that does not deter me from giving a much more\r\nsatisfying explanation. My father once invested a considerable\r\nsum of money in tin mines and the money was finally lost. The\r\nincident made a great impression upon my father and he often\r\nspoke of it ; while \u201c tin mines \u201d became a family term for ri.sky\r\nspeculation.\r\nMonth : January. January. January. January. January.\r\nHis aside was, \u201c An anniversary, you know.\u201d \u201c January\r\n\r\nthere is an anniversary\u2014Mother\u2019s.\u201d My mother\u2019s birthday is in January.\r\nNeedle : Bag.\r\nCarry : Bag.\r\nI place these together for convenience of comment. After\r\nmaking the latter reaction John asked me, \u201c You remember my\r\ncoat with the cape ? \u201d I replied that I did. He continued, \u201c I carried a bag and wore a coat with a cape. Cannot you see me\r\nso now ? \u201d I remember that coat with its Inverness cape, and I\r\nstill have the bag which my father always carried when leaving\r\nhome for week-end appointments. In that bag he took needle\r\nand thread, explaining that he might have occasion to sew on\r\nloose buttons.\r\nBox : Tools, long.\r\nNo one familiar with our home in my father\u2019s time could fail to be struck with this combination of words. His tools, as far\r\nback as I can remember, were always kept in a very long narrow box and he rather prided himself upon his skill with its contents.\r\nTool-box is obviously a commonplace association, but it is doubtful if the word \u201c long \u201d woidd be ordinarily associated with\r\n\u201c tool-box.\u201d\r\nWindow : Plants.\r\nHe added, \u201c You remember ? \u201d I certainly do remember that\r\nmy father for many years always had a stand of plants in his\r\nstudy window, as well as hanging plants in the windows of the\r\ndining room. Paper : Methodist. Methodist.\r\nMy father\u2019s favourite church paper was The Methodist\r\nRecorder.\r\nChair : red. Reading. Red.\r\nOn giving the first reaction John added, \u201c You remember it, don\u2019t you, Charlie ? \u201d But for that cpiestion I should have\r\nnoticed nothing relevant in this association of \u201c red \u201d with\r\n382 C. Drayton Thomas [part\u201c chair.\u201d Biit I then recollected that, when furni shing hisstudy on retirement from the itinerancy, he bought at a sale aneasy chair. It was specifically his in a sense applying to no otherchair in the house.\r\nFor years this chair has been covered and I had to make aninspection after this sitting in order to ascertain its originalcolour. I found it was red morocco ! I had never thought of it as a\r\n\u201c readiirg chair,\u201d but always asan \u201c easy chair \u201d ; nor was I aware that its colour had originallybeen red. The red is still visible where the leather has beenprotected from fading.\r\nFinger : numb.\r\nHe added, \u201c You remember ? \u201d On repetition the medium\u2019sfingers gave a snap as the word was spoken.\r\nThis is peculiarly interesting. My father\u2019s fingers, when hewashed in cold weather, would often turn whitish and feel numb.My mother used to remark upon the change of colour. Thequestion, \u201c You remember ? \u201d together with the snapping offingers during repetition of the word \u201c numb,\u201d was eloquentof a personal recollection.\r\n3. Etta\r\nMy sister Etta was an ideal mother and housewife. Her chiefrecreation was painting. For long years she suffered ill health andpain, and her passing followed upon a severe operation which wassuddenly found to be necessary.\r\nAmong the reactions of E we find the following ; Get well. Strong. 111. lUness. Anxiety. Ambulance. Operation. Instruments. Nurses. Dressing. Nursing. Anaesthetics.Sick. Surgeon. Pain. Hospital. Medicine. Suffering.\r\nInterest in sketching and painting is indicated in other reactions :\r\nPainting. Sketching. Paints. Ochre. Lines. Sky. Picture.Drawing. Canvas. Distance.\r\nHousehold associations are common to many women, but theyare strongest in the mind of a good mother and house manager, suchas was my sister. In the reactions of Etta we find many such : Accounts. Meals. Child. Dinner. Work. Beds. Order.Garden. Lawn. Tidy. Home. Darn. School. Fireside. Jam.Meal. Eggs. Carpet. Pudding. Sheets. Linen. Table. Apron.Breakfast. Economy. Firewood. Chimney. Babies. Mother.\r\n141] Word Association Experiment tvith 3Irs 0. Leonard 383\r\nFamily. Christening. Grate. Rug. Slippers. Houses. Sash.\r\nFlannel. Daughter. Bathroom. Tub.\r\nThe following suggest my sister\u2019s personal memories and characteristics :\r\nNasty ; pain, medicine. Pain. Medicine, medicine, medicine.\r\nDoctor : Sudden, operation, hurry.\r\nBed : Nursing. Anaesthetic.\r\nKnife : operation. Table, operation.\r\nProud : mother, family.\r\nName : Joy. christening. (Joy is the name of Etta\u2019s only\r\ndaughter.)\r\nLove : CHILDREN. Stuart. Family. (Stuart is Etta\u2019s younger son.)\r\nKiss : CHILD. Stuart, children, children.\r\nGirl : JOA\u2019. Daughter.\r\nPain : operation. (Etta\u2019s operation was preceded by a period of\r\nintense pain.)\r\nChild : JOY. joy.\r\nDead : arisen. Operation. Arise.\r\nEtta\u2019s asides. Comments upon reaction words\r\nFinger : sore. sore.\r\n^\\^len giving the reaction \u201c sore \u201d Etta added, \u201c Clara\u2019s\r\nfinger.\u201d This conclusively showed knowledge of the following fact : my wife, Clara, while strugghng to draw reluctant\r\ncurtains, rasped her index finger so severely that the skin was\r\ndeeply wounded beneath the second joint. In this position the\r\nwound was slow to heal and caused much inconvenience. During the first few days I fixed the bandage, but afterwards scarcely\r\ngave the incident any further thought. The finger was hurt\r\nnine days before this sitting, and was still sore and stiff, as I ascertained by inquiry on reaching home. My wife was not at\r\nthe sitting and the medium could not have been aware of the\r\nincident.\r\nThe allusion can scarcely be attributed to chance coincidence.\r\nI do not recollect my wife having ever hurt a finger before. If\r\nEtta noticed on this occasion a small happening in our home, it was no more than she had done scores of times before. Many of\r\nher allusions to home events I can recognise at once, but others\r\nhave not been within my knowledge and were only verified by\r\ninquiry of others in the house.\r\nMountain : Island.\r\nThe only mountain Etta climbed was one in the Isle of Man.\r\n384 C. Drayton Thomas [past\r\nGreen : Carpet.\r\nEtta bought a green carpet when furnishing her first home. She was rather proud of the selection, and it was in use\r\nduring all her married life. Ked : Grimm\u2019s.\r\nEtta added, \u201c For the children, dear.\u201d I learn on inqmrythat her children had Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales. This may be com-mon enough to-day, but we never read them in our childhood.\r\nFoot : ARCH.\r\nShe added, \u201c I was thinking of something that happenedlong ago. It was an important matter and I am glad we put it\r\nright at the time.\u201d This looks like a recollection of what was agreat trouble to her during the childhood of her younger boy ; he developed flat-feet and was pronounced incurable by severaldoctors. Finally a bonesetter put him right and there was norecurrence of the weakness.\r\nHill: ROCHESTER.\r\nEtta lived at Star Hill, Kochester, for three years. It wason a steep rise.\r\nBall : TENNIS. TENNIS. TENNIS.\r\nEtta was very fond of lawn tennis and apart from cycling it was her only sport.\r\nBox : Trunk.\r\nShe added, \u201c Do you remember I had a box which Iused instead of a trunk and sometimes people used to laugh ? \u201dYes, she had a rather out-sized box which we jocularly termed\u201c The Ark.\u201d\r\nHead : Sunbonnet. sunbonnet.\r\nHat: SUNBONNET. sunbonnet. sunbonnet. sunbonnet. sun-bonnet. SUNBONNET.\r\nThis reaction was evidently a clear-cut association. I gaveEtta a sunbonnet under exceptional circumstances during aholiday shortly before the war, and she often alluded to it.\r\nCook : HANNAH. HANNAH. ^ The name of a maid who lived with us during Etta s childhood.\r\nTown : leek. Newport, leek. Newport.\r\nEtta was born at Leek and later stayed there with friends.Newport was regularly visited, as grandparents resided thereand we regarded it as our second home.\r\nBil'd: HURT. HURT.

Her\r\nonly brother-in-law was Albert.\r\nKnife: operation. Table, operation.\r\nDoctor : Sudden, operation, hurry.\r\nBoth the above are reminiscent of the circumstances attending Etta\u2019s death.\r\nThe above reactions were peculiar to E alone, but the following\r\nthree were also given by J : Blue : J. Ribbon.\r\nE. Ribbon. Identical reactions but given on different days.\r\nDog : J. SOMETIMES. BLACK. COLLIE.\r\nE. COLLIE. COLLIE. Both give \u201c Collie \u201d but on different\r\ndays.\r\nTown : J. Newport.\r\nE. NEWPORT. NEWPORT. Identical reactions but Oil different\r\ndays.\r\nThe reaction \u201c ribbon \u201d may be reminiscent of the time when both\r\nmy father and my sister wore \u201c the blue ribbon,\u201d at that period a popular badge of total abstinence. In an aside following the reac- tion \u201c sometimes,\u201d J said it meant that he kept a dog sometimes but\r\nnot always. That was the case in my father\u2019s household ; his first dog was \u201c black,\u201d but this was before my sister\u2019s birth and I doulit\r\n386 C. Drayton Thomas [partif she ever heard of it. In later years they kept a\r\n\u201c collie,\u201d as Ettawould well remember. Their only other dog had belonged to Ettaand she took it away when she married. Newport has many associations for our family. Thus all reactions were consistent with the\r\nmemories of my father and sister. With the above exceptions no personally evidential reaction wasshared by two personalities.\r\nAs to conmionplace duplications, it was inevitable that these shouldoccur in response to lists containing so many words having conventional associations ; but every such duplication will be counted in\r\nthe second part of this paper.\r\nAlthough it has no bearing upon our examination of the reactionwords, it may be of interest to quote Feda\u2019s remark upon her condition during these tests.\r\n[Feda. Do you know what I does ? C.D.T. No.\r\nFeda. I have not got to get messages or evidence, so I bees myself.|It is very nice. Look, when I ordinary give sittings I doesinot be myself, because if I did the sitters and communicatorswould think me a nuisance. So I have to be a kind of machineifor taking messages from communicators, mostly from Eng-|lish people which are very dense. So I have to keep sayingwhat they say and think.\r\nBut now I can be myself, and I can think myself back as Iwas on earth. It is beautiful.\r\nEtta and Mr John say that they become very personal andIthink just only of the words and what they suggest. The above, given in Feda\u2019s own pecuhar grammar, harmonises withwhat may be termed the watertightness of the several commuiiicators. Feda gives words indicating an interest in the East, quiteconsistent with her claim to be a native of India. John s repliescontain many Scriptural, ministerial and personal allusions, whileEtta\u2019s list is rich in references to home life, family interests, sketchingand illness. From any point of view it is noteworthy that these several interestsdid not overlap, but were strictly confined to the personalities towhom they were appropriate. Feda shows no interest in ministerial life or in family matters, while neither John nor Etta revealsany acquaintance with the East.\r\n4. Mrs Leonard\r\nWe have three sets of Mrs Leonard\u2019s reactions\u2014two (of which oneis for Lp, the other for Ln) of seventy-five words on each of six\r\n141] Word Association Experiment ivith 3Irs 0. Leonard 387\r\noccasions, and one (for Ln) of fifty words on each of four occasions.\r\nThis gives a total of 1,100 stimulus words. The reactions may be described as commonplace and non-identifying. I have known Mrs\r\nLeonard for seventeen years and am famihar with her interests and\r\nhistory. Yet a survey of her reactions rarely shows anything distinctive of either. They might be given by anybody or by everybody ; there is nothing to indicate Mrs Leonard\u2014or almost nothing.\r\nThe following are the only exceptions I can find ; Lamp : shade, glass, shade, glass, shade, shade.\r\nBuild : HALL. Hall. hall. hall.\r\nDuring the period in which these experiments were proceeding Mrs Leonard was building a hall suitable for meetings. She was having the hall fitted for electric fighting and discussed with\r\nme the best kind of glass shade to select. Land ; Lease, price, price.\r\nPrevious to building the hall she had built her present house.\r\nNaturally the question of lease or freehold and of price had been\r\nprominent in her mind on both occasions.\r\nBall : PLAY. Play.\r\nFor some years Mrs Leonard took exercise m a game which\r\nconsisted in keeping a ball on the bounce as long as possible.\r\nBook : TEST. TEST. TEST.\r\nAs Mrs Leonard will have been aware, her sittings have produced a remarkable number of highly interesting book tests which were once made the subject of a paper by Mrs Sidgwick\r\nin Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxxi, p. 241.\r\nBeat : time. time. time. time.\r\nThis might possibly be a memory of the period during which\r\niirs Leonard was training for the concert platform before an\r\nattack of diphtheria impaired her singing voice.\r\nDoctor ; hector.\r\nHector is the Christian name of Mrs Leonard\u2019s doctor.\r\nHome : Haven.\r\nMrs Leonard\u2019s present house is named The Haven.\r\nWild : Alcohol.\r\nWicked : cruel. Trap.\r\nThese reactions might relate to Mrs Leonard\u2019s interest in total\r\nabstinence, and in the prevention of cruelty to animals.\r\nThe above fist includes everything indicative of Mrs Leonard\u2019s\r\nidentity. Had she been a communicator, instead of the visible\r\nmedium, I should have had grave doubts about the performance,\r\nand should certainly have refused to accept it as emanating from the\r\n388 C. Drayton Thomas [part\r\n]Mrs Leonard I had known ! And this notwithstanding the advan-\r\n|tage she had in giving 450 more reactions than either of the others.\r\nTHE RESPONSES CONSIDERED NUMERICALLY\r\nPrimary Associations and Reproduction Test\r\nLet ns now deal with all reactions to the seventy-five Stimulus\r\nWords used at six sittings. I first examined the responses for any similarities to be formd between them. We need to know how many reactions of each pair of\r\nPersonalities were identical. The result was as follows ; JE 38\r\nLnE 37\r\nLpE 37\r\nLnLp 36\r\nLnJ 24\r\nLpJ 19\r\nFJ 18\r\nFE 17\r\nLnF 15\r\nLpF 12\r\nThese figures represent identical reactions to the same StimulusWord. Each occasionally responded with some word which anotherpersonality gave in answer to a different Stimulus Word, but that canbe disregarded ; for our interest is with identical responses to oneand the same Stimulus Word.\r\nPerhaps allowance should be made for the fact that Mrs Leonardmust have grown familiar with the list of seventy-five StimulusWords before the Ln reactions were taken. She had responded six\r\ntimes to the list as Lp ; and while in trance she may have had someconsciousness of the list being called over to F, J and E, six timeseach ; there had been also the Reproduction Test. The list hadactually been called over forty-seven times before the first Lnreactions were taken.\r\nFrom personal experience I know that it becomes easier to respondwith identical words the more frequently one hears the list ofStimulus Words, whether it be called over for one\u2019s own reactions orfor those of another. This may be the explanation of the fact thatLn gave more identical reactions with J and F than did Lp.\r\nWhy did LnE, LpE, JE, LnLp give more identical replies thanany of the other pairs ? That Ln and Lp, being aspects of the sameindividual, should show a likeness needs no explanation. As to theothers, I hazard the opinion that E exerted some degree of influenceover Ln and Lp and that the likeness between J and E is due to theirearth-life relationship. It is of course possible that this supposedinfluence was exerted by Ln and Lp upon E, rather than vice versa\r\ny\r\nbut we shall, I think, find reasons for concluding that it was not so.Be that as it may, we note that Leonard and Etta show some\r\n141] Word Association Experiment with Mrs O. Leonard 389\r\nsimilarity, as also do John and Etta ; while Feda is markedly less like the others.\r\nI have been asked whether the similarity between J and E, and in a\r\nlesser degree between them and L, might not have been produced by\r\ntelepathy from me. It is difficult to see why, if that had been the\r\ncase, the same telepathy did not act with F also.\r\n^ It is to be noted that L, J and E might be expected to show some\r\nsimilarity in view of their sharing English birth and education, while\r\nF s asserted Indian origin would explain the preference for words of\r\nanother type.\r\nIt has been suggested that Feda elected to play the part of an\r\nIndian and chose her reactions accordingly ; in support of this\r\nhypothesis reference is made to the facility with which some\r\nhypnotised subjects can sustain the part they are commanded to\r\nplay. As against this I would point to the highly persistent and\r\nimpressive way in which Feda repeated her Eastern responses at\r\nsittings separated from each other by intervals of weeks.\r\nThe Eeproduction Test\r\nAfter taking the reactions to the seventy-five words I immediately\r\nwent through the list a second time with the same personality, asking\r\nthat rephes should be as quick as possible. A reproduction of the\r\npreviously given reaction word indicates perhaps a retentive\r\nmemory, but more probably a definite mental association. Especially is it likely to be the latter when the identical word is reproduced\r\nat a sitting or sittings several weeks after the first. For example,\r\nEtta gave \u201c Sunbonnet \u201d as her reaction to the word \u201c Hat,\u201d and\r\nrepeated it at every sitting and at every Eeproduction Test, while no other personality even mentioned the word.\r\nSimilarity\r\nIdentical reactions, and identical Eeprodiictions, to the same\r\nstimulus word by two personalities ;\r\n^^\u2019'ORDS Reproductioxs Total\r\nLnE 37 19 56\r\nJE 38 17 55\r\nLnLp 36 16 52\r\nLpE 37 12 49\r\nLnJ 24 10 34\r\nLpJ 19 14 33\r\nFJ 18 5 23\r\nLnF 15 5 20\r\nFE 17 2 19\r\nLpF 12 3 15\r\n390 C. Drayton Thomas [partAs we are inquiring whether the responses were given by severalminds or by one, it is pertinent to notice which of the personalitieswas first to give the response which was later duplicated by another.In ascertaining this I have to omit figures of the second sitting, asthe trance on that occasion terminated before E had taken part andbefore J had completed the Reproduction Test.\r\nFirsts Firsts\r\nLpE E 21 Lp 15\r\nJE J 23 E 11\r\nFJ J 7 F 4\r\nLpJ J 10 Lp 5\r\nFE F 5 E 3\r\nLpF Lp 7 F 2\r\nLn cannot be classed, as her whole set was done after the conclusionof the first experiment. It should be noted that Lp always had firstturn, Feda always the second ; E came before J in four sittings.\r\nDespite the disadvantage of following the other two, E and J headthe list\r\n:\r\nJ 40 L 27\r\nE 35 F 11\r\nJ heads his pair three times, whereas the others head their pairs butonce each.\r\nThese results seem to indicate the predominating influence of Jand E over L.\r\nThis is undoubtedly significant. Mr Carington found that J had ahigh average likeness to the other personalities, and it therefore became of interest to inquire whether this was due to his bemg in-fluenced by the others or vice versa. In the above figures we get anindication that J exerted the dominating influence. That this shouldbe so is entirely in accord with his mentality as known to me duringhis lifetime. He was accustomed to positions of authority in whichhe had to take the lead ; moreover he was naturally strong mindedand held his opinions with great firmness.\r\nThe figures indicate a close connection between J and E, and re-veal the dominance of the JE combination. This agrees with whatone would have expected ; for my sister Etta shared, to some degree,my father\u2019s strength of character. They inevitably had much incommon, for they were living in the same environment and mentalatmosphere up to the time of my sister\u2019s marriage.\r\nDifference\r\nWe may here inquire whether our estimate of similarity can be supported by a consideration of differences. We wiU try to ascertain\r\n141] Word Association Experiment ivith Mrs 0. Leonard 391\r\nwhether the observable unlikeness does, or does not, suggest the\r\naction of varying aspects of the same mind.\r\nResponses peculiar to one personality and not given by any other :\r\nReproductions and\r\nRepetitions of\r\nWords alone THOSE Words Totals\r\nF 377 142 F 519\r\nE 315 153 E 46S\r\n.J 328 90 J 418\r\nLp 334 37 Lp 371\r\nLn 252 91 Ln 343\r\nF is seen to be markedly distinct from the others.\r\nJ and E keep together.\r\nMrs Leonard is least distinguished of any.\r\nIn the following tables we shall take no account of reproductions\r\nor repetitions. By comparing the responses of Lp with those of Ln\r\nwe find that the former used 396 words not found in the responses of\r\nthe latter ; also that Ln used 273 words not used by Lp. The dif- ference between Lp and Ln is found by adding those figures,, viz. 669.\r\nThe following figures will enable us to treat each pair m tliis way.\r\nThe difference between : Lp and Ln is 396\r\nLp 3 3 F \u201e 421\r\nLp 3 3 J \u201e 411\r\nLp 33 E \u201e 394\r\nLn 33 Lp \u201e 273\r\nLn 33 F \u201e 295\r\nLn 33 J \u201e 286\r\nLn 3 3 E \u201e 271\r\nF 33 Lp \u201e 367\r\nF 33 Ln \u201e 363\r\nF 33 J \u201e 362\r\nF 3 3 E \u201e 369\r\nJ > i Lp \u201e 384\r\n.J 33 Ln \u201e 379\r\nJ 33 F \u201e 389\r\nJ 33 E \u201e 368\r\nE 33 Lp ,, 353\r\nE 33 Ln \u201e 344\r\nE 33 F \u201e 376\r\nE 33 J ,, 350\r\n392 C.

This may well have familiarised her mind, conscious and subconscious, not only with the Stimulus\r\nWords but with many of the reactions given by the other personalities. This lessens the value of all Ln computations in this paper.\r\nThey are included for the sake of completeness, but no strong argument can be based upon them.\r\nThe following remarks were given some years ago, but would seem\r\n141] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 393\r\nto bear upon our experiment and the attempt to apportion the in- fluence on each other of medium and the controlling personality.\r\nFeda : Your father says that he refrains from saying many things\r\nwhich he wishes to give lest they should come through in a\r\ndistorted form. Feda feels that also ; for she does not\r\nalways make the Medium\u2019s voice speak as intended. Feda\r\ntouches something which wakes the Medium\u2019s mind and\r\nthen it goes off on its own account.\r\nC.D.T. : Feda, can you hear the words spoken by the Medium ? Feda : Yes, but cannot stop her speakmg if what she says is wrong.\r\nOften Feda camiot get the power to check the words.\r\nYour father says that over-pressure taps the subconscious\r\nmind of the Medium and then something escapes before\r\nFeda can stop it. Even after hearing those escapes and\r\ninaccuracies Feda cannot always so control the Medium\u2019s\r\nmind as to put things right. As each thought is given it is fixed on the co-operative mind which is created partly by\r\nthe Medium and partly by Feda. Once it is registered there\r\na counter-suggestion is not easily put through. Your\r\nfather says that Feda thinks she works directly on the\r\nMedium\u2019s brain, but he does not consider that this is entirely accurate. He says that Feda really works upon the\r\nMedium\u2019s mind-essence, which, in its turn, works the brain.\r\nThis mind-essence belongs to the Medium\u2019s organism.\r\nThe above explanation of a composite mmd, created partly by the\r\ncontrolling personality and partly by the medium, is of special\r\ninterest hi view of the varying degrees of similarity which we find\r\nbetween the medium and the personalities.\r\nWe have seen that any similarity existhig between the reactions of\r\nthe personalities and those of the medium varied with the personality\r\ncontrolling. We also found these variations appearuig in the character of the words peculiar to each, and in the degree of divergence\r\nfrom the reactions of the medium. Indeed, all that we found seems\r\nto favour the supposition that with change of control there comes\r\ninto operation a differently composed mind and memory.\r\nWHAT THE FIGURES INDICATE\r\nThe figures indicate a small common element in the reactions of\r\nL with both J and E, and very much less so with F.\r\nDoes the common element indicate that L influenced J and E, or was their influence exerted upon L ? Evidently it is the influence of\r\n394 C. Drayton Thomas [part\r\nJ and E which is the stronger ; for they are more frequent than L in\r\nfirst giving the word which one or other of them duplicates with L.\r\nE first 21 times and Lp 15\r\nJ \u201e 10 \u201e \u201e Lp 5\r\nInquiring whether it is J or E who most influences L, we find that\r\nE has most influence ; not only was E first 21 times as shown above,\r\nbut EL stand only second to EJ for identical reactions.\r\nThis result is supplemented by calculation of difference. LpJhave 795 words different from each other, LpE have 747. This\r\nindicates a closer affinity between L and E than between L and J. Continuing the examination of \u201c difference,\u201d we find that F (519)\r\nis again isolated from the other personalities by a wide margin.\r\nNext in order comes E (468), and L is la.st (Lp 371, Ln 343).\r\nIt is noteworthy that F should be at one extreme and L at the\r\nother. One might have expected a rather close likeness between\r\niMedium and Control, but Feda\u2019s isolation reveals itself in various\r\nways throughout the whole experiment.\r\nWritten plain over all the figures is the close connection of J and\r\nE. The figures for F isolate themselves, almost as much as did\r\nFeda\u2019s reaction words, with their strong Oriental flavour, which none\r\nelse shared. It is surprising, considering the long years in which\r\nthey have been associated as Control and Medium, that no strong\r\nsimilarity should have grown up between her and I\\Irs Leonard.\r\nThe influence of both J and E over L is much greater than that of\r\nF over L. This is the more surprising seeing that J and E are only\r\noccasional Controls, while F is controlling at every sittmg. Taking\r\nthis fact m conjimction with the general colourlessness of the L re- actions, and the almost entire absence of personally characteristic or evidential responses by L, we may conclude that Mrs Leonard is peculiarly happy in being able to keep her mind in the \u201c clean slate \u201d\r\ncondition. I am av>-are that she has practised this for many years,\r\nfearing that if she thinks of anything particularly interesting just\r\nbefore a sitting it will interfere with its success. Doubtless this habit\r\nhas had much to do with her success in mediumship, and accounts for\r\nthe influence she exerts upon Communicators being almost nil. Yet it does not follow from this that the Communicators are able\r\nto express all they wish ; the medium\u2019s influence may be, and I think is, a strongly limiting one. I constantly notice this limiting\r\ninfluence in my sittings, although rarely, if ever, can I detect anything to suggest that the L influence is overriding that of my communicators. The passage of thought through the L organism seems\r\nsubject to some degree of check, but not to any serious distortion.\r\nMr Carington\u2019s examination, being based on reaction times andw\r\n141] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 395\r\nreproduction tests, might be expected to show relationships or dif- ferences of a character other than those based on examination of\r\nresponse words. Nevertheless there are similarities in our conclusions which strongly support each other. Prominent among these\r\nstand out\r\n:\r\n(i) The close relationship of John and Etta.\r\n(ii) Their tendency to dominate the medium.\r\nHad time permitted my communicators to expand their replies\r\nthey would probably have explained several response words of which\r\nI failed to see the significance. As it was they explained some which\r\nI should not otherwise have understood.\r\nThis leads me to remark that the method of free association might\r\nbe used with advantage when communicators find difficulty in ex- pressing their ideas, a difficulty which seems to be increased when\r\none puts direct questions. Direct questions seem to create a condition of strain which defeats their object. My father explains it thus : \u201c To put anything m a specific form is most difficult of all. I have\r\nto dodge a machine. You see, there is the medium\u2019s brain, and Feda\r\nmanipulating that brain, and I have to dodge both. I find I can get\r\nthmgs through most easily when I take Feda off her guard, when she\r\nis not looking for a word or name. MJien there is a great effort, and\r\nFeda is aware that I am trying, she holds the brain m a strained\r\ncondition. Suppose you are about to play a game, or something of\r\nthat kind, say to shoot at a target ; if you know you must hit the\r\nbull\u2019s-eye or not make the attempt, you will have less chance of\r\nsuccess than if you think it does not matter whether you do it or not.\r\nAnyone anxiously w^aiting to see you hit the bull\u2019s-eye makes for\r\nyou a shghtly strained condition ; this strained condition is not with\r\nme but with Feda.\u201d\r\nMTien, as in these experiments, the communicator is in personal\r\ncontrol of the medium, the above-mentioned strain would, of course,\r\nbe felt by himself. This strained condition is evaded by the method\r\nof free association. Skilfully used, it might be effective in eliciting\r\ninformation which direct interrogation would have blocked.\r\nWe have discussed differences and similarities between personalities\r\nmaking use of the same physical body. WTiether four ordinary\r\npeople thus tested might prove less alike in their reactions than do\r\nthe personalities under inspection in this paper I do not know, for I have not made a control experiment.\r\nWe have, however, discovered something significant in the fact\r\nthat these four maintain certain relationships consistently, always\r\nshowing the same or similar relations whether we consider their\r\nreaction words, their likenesses or their dissimilarities in response.\r\n396 C. Drayton Thomas [part 141]\r\nThe two closest are J and E ; the most widely separated are F andL. It remains for others to interpret these facts.\r\nJlefore commencing this experiment at Mr Carington\u2019s suggestion\r\nI had no idea as to its probable result. MTiether my Communicatorswould be able to respond at will without being confused by the action\r\nof the medium\u2019s mind, I could not guess. During the progress of the\r\nexperiment I refrained from any attempt to study the accumulatingmaterial. By previous arrangement the word lists were not retained\r\nin my possession.\r\nWhen this material was finally returned to me for examination its character afforded some surprises. I had, of course, noticed someindications of personal memory in the responses of my communicators, but had not realised that this method of free association wasproviding data by which various degrees of reciprocal influence between the different personalities wonld be indicated. Mr Caringtonis to be congratulated upon the insight and enterprise to which so illuminating an experiment is entirely due.\r\nPROCEEDINGS\r\nOF THE\r\nSociety for Psychical Research\r\nPART 142\r\nNORMAL COGNITION, CLAIRVOYANCE, AND TELEPATHY ^\r\nBy Peofessor C. D. Broad, Litt.D.\r\nIntroduction\r\nWhen the Society did me the honour of making me their President\r\nthey chose, presumably with their eyes open, a professional philosopher with very little first-hand experience of Psychical Research.\r\nI think I shall be most likely to be of use to the Society in my presidential address if I stick to my last and speak as a philosopher.\r\nAll of us are aware that our subject differs from most others in\r\nthe following important respect. It is much harder for us than for\r\nworkers in other experimental fields to get any empirical facts or\r\nfirst-order generahsations estabhshed and universally admitted.\r\nNo one doubts, e.g., that hght is sometimes reflected and sometimes\r\nrefracted ; so the physicist can go on at once to seek for the laws of\r\nreflexion and refraction and the conditions under which such events\r\ntake place. But contrast our position in respect of supernormal\r\ncognition. For my own part I have no doubt that telepathy among\r\nnormal human bemgs happens from time to time. And it is quite\r\nclear to me that, in order to account for the information which is sometimes conveyed by good trance-mediums and automatic\r\nwriters, a very extensive and peculiar telepathy among the living\r\nis the very least that must be postulated. Probably most, if not\r\nall, of those here would agree with me. But we know quite well that\r\nmost scientists and the bulk of the general public would not admit\r\nthis for an instant. And we know that this is not because they have\r\n^ Presidential Address, delivered at a General Meeting of the Society on\r\n1st May, 1935.\r\n2 D 397\r\n398 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partloolced into the evidence and found it faulty or have suggested'\r\nplausible alternative exj)lanations. They would no more thinlv oflooking into the evidence for telepathy than a pious Christian thinksof looking into the evidence for Mahometanism, or a pious Mahome-j tan of looking into the evidence for Christianity. When we leavetele])athy and pass to other forms of supernormal cognition thereis no agi-eement even among ourselves. Many of us would say that'\r\nnon-inferential foreknowledge of an event is plainly impossible,and that no evidence could convince us of it. And many of usi would feel that the modus ojoerandi of pure clairvoyance or of non-i inferential cognition of past events by a person who never witnessedthem is so difficult to conceive that we could hardly be persuaded ofthe occurrence of such cognition.\r\nOf course each of us is influenced to some extent by psychologicalcauses, which are logically irrelevant, when he accepts or rejects analleged fact or a suggested theory on the strength of evidence submitted to him. But an important logical principle is involved too.The degree of belief which it is reasonable to attach to an alleged]fact or a proposed theory depends jointly on two factors, viz. : (a) its antecedent probability or improbability, and (b) the trustj worthiness of the evidence and the extent to which it seems toIexclude all alternatives except the one suggested. On preciselysimilar evidence it would be reasonalde to believe much more stronglythat an accused man had cheated at cards if one knew him to be aibookmaker than it would be if one knew him to be an Anglicanlbishoji, l)ecause the antecedent probability of the alleged event is i'much greater in the former case than in the latter. Now antecedentprobability depends very largely on analogy or coherence of thesuggested proposition with what is already known or reasonablybelieved about the sul>ject-matter with which it is concerned.Antecedent improbalulity depends very largely on lack of analogyor jiositive discordance with what is already known or reasonablybelieved.\r\nThe application of this to our sid)ject is obvious. People have atthe back of their minds a certain system of knowledge and beliefabout the nature and conditions of normal cognition. They suspectthat the various kinds of supernormal cognition which have beenalleged to happen would be utterly different in nature and wouldpresu])])ose an entirely different kind of causation. They thereforeregard the occurrence of supernormal cognition as antecedentlyvery unlikely, and they demand for it evidence of such amount andsuch quality as they would not think of requiring for alleged facts ofa normal kind. This attitude is, up to a point, perfectly reasonable,and it is impossible to say just where it ceases to be so. It seems to\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 399\r\nme that the whole situation would be very much clarified if the\r\ntwo following requests coidd be fulfilled. Tu the first place, we should\r\nlike to have a clear and explicit statement of what may reasonably\r\nbe regarded as well-established facts about the nature and conditions\r\n' of normal cognition. Secondly, we should like to get from psychical\r\nresearchers a moderately clear statement of what they understand\r\nby \u201c clairvoyance,\u201d \u201c telepathy,\u201d \u201c pre-cognition,\u201d etc., and some\r\nsuggestions about the possible modus operandi of these forms of\r\ncognition if they do occur. If such statements were forthcoming, we\r\nmight be able to see where precisely there is analogy or lack of\r\nanalogy, coherence or discordance, between alleged supernormal\r\ncognition and admitted normal cognition. This would be a great\r\nadvance on the present vague impression of oddity and upsettingness. Now a professional philosopher, interested in Psychical Research,\r\nought to be of some use in this connexion. He ought at least to be\r\nable to make a moderately coherent answer to the first request, and\r\nhe might be able to make a few suggestions towards answering the\r\nsecond. I propose to devote the rest of my address to these topics.\r\nThe forms of supernormal cognition which have been alleged to\r\n1 occur may be roughly classified as follows. We may divide them\r\nfirst into supernormal cognitions of contemporary events or of\r\nthe contemporary states of things or persons, and supernormal cognitions of past or futiire events or the past or future states of things\r\nor persons. Under the first headmg would come Clairvoyance and\r\nTelepathy. Under the second heading woidd come such knowledge\r\nof the past as was claimed by Miss Jourdain and Miss Moberley in\r\ntheir book An Adventure, and such foreknowledge as is claimed by\r\nMr Dunne in his book An Experiment with Time. We will call these\r\n\u201c Supernormal Postcognition \u201d and \u201c Supernormal Precognition \u201d\r\nrespectively. Smce Clairvoyance, if it happened, would involve no\r\ncomplications about other minds than that of the cogniser or other\r\ntimes than that at which he has his cognition, I shall begin with it. I shall then consider Telepathy. I shall not attempt to deal with\r\nSupernormal Postcognition or Precognition in this paper.\r\nClairvoyance\r\nSuppose that a person correctly guesses the number and suit of a\r\ncard in a new pack which he has never touched, and which has been\r\nmechanically shuffled so that no one else has the information in his\r\nmind at the time. If this were to happen often under test conditions, there would be a jwinia facie case for postulating pure clair- voyance. It would then be reasonable to raise the following ques-\r\n400 Professor G. D. Broad, Litt.D. [parttion : \u201c Supposing that pure clairvoyance does occur, how far, if atj all, is it analogous to ordinary sense-perception ? \u201d This is thec|uestion which I am now going to discuss. I\r\nNormal Sense-perception\r\nPlainly we cannot hope to answer this question until we havestated clearly what happens in normal sense-perception. I shalltherefore begin by giving what seems to me to be, on the whole, themost reasonable account of this in view of all the known facts. Weshall have to consider it in its psychological, its physiological, andits physical aspects. The subject is very complex and highly controversial, and I shall have to be rather dogmatic in order to bereasonably brief.\r\n} I think that the first point to be made is that there are severalforms of sense-perception which are, prima facie, fundamentallydifferent in nature. Philosophers have too often confined themselves|to a certain one of them, viz., visual perception, in discussing thesubject. It is essential that we should not make this mistake if we!are seeking for analogies between clairvoyance and normal sense-1perception. I begin, therefore, by dividing sense-perception intoi \u201c extra-somatic \u201d and \u201c intra-somatic.\u201d In the former the percijpient seems to himself to be perceiving foreign bodies and events ;\r\n: in the latter he seems to himself to be perceiving the inside of his\u2019own body and processes going on in it. Now there are at least threeimportant forms of extra-somatic sense-perception, viz., hearing,sight, and touch, which seem, primafacie, to be unlike each other incertain fundamental respects.\r\nSight and hearing agree with each other and differ from touch inthat they seem to reveal to us things and events which are located|at various distances out from our bodies. But hearing differs from(sight in the following important way. When I say that I hear ajbell I should admit that this is an elliptical expression. Strictly( speaking, I hear a noise of a rhythmic booming kind which seems tobe emanating from a distant place and coming to me in a certainidirection. I take it that this place contains a bell, and that a certainjrhythmic process in it is causing it to make the noise. On this point;there would be no difference in principle between the account whichian unscientific percipient would give of the experience as it seems tohim and the account which a scientist would give of it from thestandpomt of physics. But, when I say that I see a bell, I do not!readily admit that I am using an elliptical expression, as I shouldjadmit that \u201c I hear a bell \u201d is short for \u201c I hear a bell tolling.\u201d I\r\njseem to myself to be directly and intuitively apprehending a remote\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 401\r\ncoloured area which I take to be part of the surface of an independent\r\nforeign body. I may learn from the scientists that the situation,\r\nin its physical aspect, is very much like that which exists when I\r\nhear the bell. I may learn that certain rhythmic processes are\r\ngoing on in the place where the bell is, that these cause a disturbance\r\nto be emitted in all directions from this centre, and that this disturbance eventually travels to my body and produces a visual sensation. But, even if I accept this as proved, it remains a fact that the\r\nsituation does not present itself to me in that way when I am having\r\nthe experience. I continue to seem to myself to be directly apprehending the surface of a remote extended object and to be actively\r\nexploring it with my eyes. In this respect visual perception resembles tactual perception, except that the objects are perceived\r\nas remote from the percipient\u2019s body in the one case and in contact\r\nwith it in the other.\r\nWe may sum up these likenesses and unlikenesses as follows. VV e may say that hearing is projective in its epistemological aspect, and\r\nis emanative in its physical aspect. We may say that sight is ostensibly prehensive and not projective in its epistemological aspect, but\r\nis emanative in its physical aspect. And we may say that touch is\r\nostensibly prehensive in its epistemological aspect, and is nonemanative in its physical aspect.\r\nNow the question at once arises whether sight and touch are really\r\n,\r\nas well as ostensibly, prehensive. We will now consider the two\r\nkinds of perception in turn. The mere fact that sight is physically\r\nemanative does not, as some people have thought, suffice to prove\r\nthat it cannot be epistemologically prehensive. It is logically\r\npossible that the function of the light-waves which emanate from a\r\ndistant object, strike the percipient\u2019s eye, and thus eventually\r\naffect his visual brain-centres, should be purely that of evoking and\r\ndirecting a cognitive act and not in the least that of producing or\r\nmodifying a cognisable object. In fact the disturbance hi the percipient\u2019s brain, produced by the light-waves, might simply cause his\r\nmind to apprehend dhectly the coloured surface of the remote\r\nobject from which the waves emanated. If so, visual perception\r\nwould really be prehensive. But, although this is logically possible,\r\nI think it may quite safely be dismissed as inconsistent with the\r\nfacts taken as a whole. The argument for this conclusion is cumulative. Each kind of fact which seems to conflict with the view that\r\nvisual perception is prehensive can, perhaps, be squared with it if we choose to make a complicated and ingenious enough supplementary ad hoc hypothesis. But these various supplementary h}qiotheses are logically independent of each other ; and, when one takes\r\nthem all together, the prehensive view becomes as complex and\r\n402 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partartificial and incredible as the Ptolemaic system of astronomy hadbecome just before it expired.\r\nI shall content myself with mentioning one jiarticularly obviousdifficulty. Light travels with a finite velocity. It is thereforepossible that, when the light which started from a distant starreaches my eye, the star should have moved away from its originalposition, changed its original colour, or blown up completely. Ifsight were really prehensive the result of the light now striking myeye and affecting my brain would be that I now directly apprehendthe surface of the star as it was when the light left it perhaps athousand years ago. My act of direct acquaintance would thus haveto bridge a temporal gap of a thousand years between the date of its own occurrence and the date of existence of its own immediateobject. Yet the object which I see is most certainly perceived byme as simultaneous with my act of seeing it. I conclude that visual percejition, though ostoisihly prehensive ofexternal objects, is not really so. All the facts conspire to support thefollowing conclusion. W hen I have a visual j^ercejition I seem to myself to be directly apprehending an area of a certain size and shape,coloured in a certain way, and forming part of the surface of a certain\r\nmaterial thing at a certain position outside my body. Put the shapeand size and position which I perceive it as having, and the colourwhich I perceive as pervading it, are completely and finally determined, on the physical side, by certain jirocesses which are going onat the time m a certain part of my brain. Provided that these\r\nprocesses are going on in this jiart of my brain, and that my mindis functioning normally, I shall have exactly this kind of visual\r\nexperience no matter how the brain-process may have been set iqi,\r\nand no matter whether there is or is not an external body such as I seem to myself to lie directly apprehending. If the brain-process\r\nhas been set iqi by light which has travelled fi\u2019om an external source through a homogeneous medium to my eye, the visual perception\r\nwill be as nearly veridical as it is ])ossil)le for a visual perception to\r\nbe. If it has been set up by light which has travelled from anexternal source but has undergone reflexions or refractions before\r\nreaching my eye, the visual perception may be highly misleading\r\nhi many respects, Imt it will not be utterly delusive. If it has been\r\nset up liy events in my own body, as in dreams or delirium, or bysuch abnormal causes as the suggestions of a hy|jnotist, the visual\r\nperception will be utterly delusive. Thus, even in the most favourable case, where there is or has been an external source and where\r\nthe visual perception gives the ])crcipient correct inlbrmation aliout\r\nits shape, jiosition, and physical state, the connexion between the\r\nact of perceiving and the external source is extremely remote. Even\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 403\r\nin this case the source and the processes going on in it are at most a\r\nremote causal ancestor of the visual perception and are never the immediate object of it. Thus there is always a certain element of\r\ndelusiveness in even the most normal and veridical visual perception.\r\nFor the percipient always seems to himself to be directly a'pjnehending the surface of a remote object as it now is, whilst at best he is only cognising very indirectly certain facts about an emitting source\r\nas it forfnerly was. Owing to the very great velocity of light the\r\ntime-error is practically unimportant except when the source is at an astronomical distance from the observer. But ostensible prehensiveness, like original sm, is a taint which equally and systematically\r\ninfects all visual perceptions, good, bad, or indifferent.\r\nOne important consequence of this is the following. Consider\r\nthe statement ; \u201c You and I are seeing the same part of the surface\r\nof the table.\u201d There is no reason to doubt that such statements\r\noften record facts, and that they do this quite efficiently for most of\r\nthe practical purposes of daily life. Nevertheless there is a suygestio\r\nfalsi about them. They suggest that there is a certain part of the\r\nsurface of a certain external body which you and I are both directly\r\napprehending. But the fact which they record, when they ilo record\r\na fact, is much more complex and of a very different kind. It would\r\nbe more accurately expressed by the statement : \u201c This visual\r\nex]ierience of mine and that visual experience of yours, though they\r\nare not prehensions of a common object, have a common causal\r\nancestor in an emittmg source outside our bodies.\u201d\r\nWe can now turn our attention to tactual perception. As I have\r\nsaid, this is ostensibly prehensive in its epistemological aspect, and\r\nis non-emanative in its physical aspect. In tactual perception we\r\nmust distinguish three factors, (i) Awareness of various sensible\r\nqualities, such as hotness and coldness, roughness and smoothness,\r\netc. This may be compared with awareness of auditory qualities in\r\nhearing and of colours in seeing, (ii) Awareness of shape and extent.\r\nThis may be compared with the corresponding factor in visual ])erception. There is, I think, nothing like it in hearing, (iii) The\r\nexperience of actively pulling and pushing foreign bodies which are\r\nin contact with one\u2019s own and making them move in spite of their\r\nvarying degrees of resistance to one\u2019s efforts ; the experience of\r\ntrying to move them and failing because the resistance which they\r\noffer is too great ; and the experience of being forcetl to move, in\r\nspite of resisting to one\u2019s utmost, by the thrust and pressure of other\r\nbodies on one\u2019s own. I will call this dynamic experience. I know of\r\nnothing analogous to it in any other form of perception.\r\nIt is this dynamical factor in tactual perception, and the systematic way in which variations in it are correlated with variations in\r\n404 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partthe non-dynamical factors, which makes it difficult even for the mostsceptical to doidjt that tactual perception is really prehensive of external objects. We may admit at once that there is not here, as in thecase of visual ])erception, a large coherent mass of facts which it isdilHcult or impossil)le to reconcile with the prehensive view. It mighteven be argued with some plausibility that, unless we realhj are di-rectly acquainted with foreign bodies in the experience of active manipulation, we should never have seemed to ourselves to be dhectly ac-quainted with them in visual perception. But we must not let ourselves be rushed into accepting the prehensive view of tactual perception until we have noted one important fact which may bear inthe opposite direction.\r\nTactual perception shares with sight and hearing a characteristicwhich we have not yet mentioned. It is transmissive m its physiological aspect, i.e., it depends on the existence and functioning ofnerves which connect the periphery of the body to the bram andconvey disturbances at a finite rate hiwards and outwards. Now it IS certain that the occurrence of a characteristic kind of disturbancein my brain is a necessary condition without which I shall not havea perception of myself as touching and interacting with a foreignbody. The question is whether the occurrence of such a process inmy brain is also the sufficient physical condition of my having suchan experience. If it is sufficient I should have exactly the sametactual experience, provided that this process in my brain were tooccur and that my mind were workmg properly, even if there wereno foreign body in contact with my skin. If this were so, my tactualperceptions could not be jirehensive. It is difficult to settle this\r\nquestion conclusively, because it is doubtful whether precisely thatkind of brain-state which occurs when I am actually manipulatingand struggling wfith a foreign body ever does arise from purelyinternal causes. But the fact that I can dream that I am strugglingwith a foreign body, though I am in fact doing nothing of the kind,\r\ncertainly suggests that even the experience of active tactual manipulation may not be really prehensive.\r\nMy own tentative view is that tactual perception is probably notprehensive of external objects, but that, in spite of this, it justifies us\r\nin being practically certain that there are foreign bodies and that theydo interact with our own bodies. It seems to me just conceivable,\r\nthough extremely uidilmly, that I might have had the kinds of ex- perience which I describe as \u201c seeing \u201d or \u201c hearing \u201d foreign bodies even if there had been no foreign bodies or if they had never emitted\r\nlight-waves or sound-waves to my body. But I find it almost impossible to believe that I could ever have had the kind of experience\r\nwhich I describe as \u201c pushing \u201d or \u201c pulling \u201d or \u201c struggling with\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 405\r\n\u201d foreign bodies unless there bad been foreign bodies and they had\r\nquite often interacted dynamically with my own body through contact. Granted that this has quite often happened, it is not hard to\r\nexplain how occasionally, m dreams or delirium, I may have a close\r\nimitation of this experience although no foreign body is then interacting dynamically \\vith mhie.\r\nThere is one important point on which I want to insist before\r\nleaving the topic of extra-somatic perception. I have argued that,\r\nwhen we have the experience of hearing, seeing, or touching something, we are not in fact apprehendmg directly the foreign body, if\r\nsuch there be, which we say we are hearing, seeing, or touching.\r\nNow at this stage there is a risk of making a serious mistake. It might be thought that, because hearing, seeing, and touching are\r\nindirect and mediate, in the sense of being non-prehensive, they\r\nmust be indhect and mediate m the sense that they involve inference. This would be a profound mistake. Even in the case of hearing I do not argue, from the fact that I am hearing a booming recurrent noise and from certain general principles of physical causation, that there is probably a bell tolling in a certam place outside\r\nmy body. The fact is that my auditory experiences have been\r\nclosely correlated with certain of my visual and tactual experiences\r\nin the past, and this correlation has established a persistent system\r\nof traces and dispositions in my mind. When I now hear a booming\r\nrecurrent noise a certain part of this dispositional system is excited,\r\nand the auditory sensation is at once invested with an aura of\r\nacquired meaning in terms of a remote visible and tangible source.\r\nIt is still more obvious that there is no element of inference in the\r\nexperience which I call \u201c seeing this \u201d or touching that. I doubt whether we can account psychologically for the ostensible\r\nprehensiveness of visual and tactual perception by any process of\r\nacquirement of meaning through association in our early years. I think we must assume that visual and tactual experiences are taken\r\nby us, from the very first, as revelations of an external material\r\nworld. No donbt all the later detailed development of this primitive\r\nvague conviction depends on the actual course of our experience\r\nand on the particular associations which are established m our early\r\nyears.\r\nSo much for the purely psychological pomt. There is a logical\r\npoint closely connected with it. Behefs which were not reached by\r\ninference may be capable of being supported or refuted by inference.\r\nNow, in my opinion, something like the commonsense behef in a world of extended movable interacting bodies can be shown to be\r\nhighly probable, on the basis of our auditory, visual, and tactual\r\nperceptions and their correlations, if and only if the following premise\r\n406 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part.\r\n'is granted. Our primitive uncritical conviction that our visual and'\r\ntactual perceptions are manifestations of an external material world,i ,and that distinctions and variations in them are signs of distinctionsand variations in it, must be allowed to have an appreciable ante-! cedent probability. There is no way of proving this indispensablepremise. Some people may find it self-evident and count it as an! axiom. I am content to take it as a postulate. We will call it thePostulate of Perceptual Transcendence.\r\nFinally we must consider intra-somatic perception, i.e., the perce})tion which each of us has of his own body, and of no other body,| by means of organic sensations. Each of us is almost always awarei of a general somatic background or field, which is vaguely extended' and fairly homogeneous in quality throughout its extent. It is fairly constant in general character, though its specific tone variesfrom time to time. Such variations are recorded by expressions like :\r\n| \u201c I am feeling tired,\u201d \u201c I am feeling well,\u201d \u201c I am feeling sick,\u201d andso on. No doubt the general character changes very slowly as weget older, and it may undergo profound and fairly sudden modifications in illness or at certain periods of normal life such as puberty. ; Against this fixirly homogeneous and constant background therehappen from time to time outstanding localised feelings which are i independent of one\u2019s volition, e.g., a sudden twinge of toothache, a prolonged and voluminous stomach-ache, and so on. We might compare the general somatic field to the visual field ofwhich one would be aware if one lay on one\u2019s back and looked up at\r\nthe sky when there is not much movement among the clouds. Andwe might compare the occasional localised outstanding toothaches,\r\nstomach-aches, etc., to the visual sensa which we should sense if there were occasional flashes of lightning, dark masses of cloud, andso on, in the sky.\r\nLastly, we must notice that, whenever we deliberately act uponor react against a foreign body, there are characteristic localised\r\nchanges in the somatic field, connected with the pressures, tensions,\r\nand movements of our muscles and joints.\r\nThe following points are of special importance for us to notice.\r\n(i) Intra-somatic perception, like all other normal perception, is transmissive in its physiological as])ect. If I am to have the kind\r\nof ex])erience which I record by saying \u201c I am feeling a pain in mytoe,\u201d it is not sufficmit that there should be a process of a certain\r\nkind going on in my toe. It is necessary that a certain process should\r\nl)e going on in my brain. Moreover, we are told on good authority\r\nthat persons who have had a limb amputated may yet have experi- ences of the kind which they would record by saying \u201c I have a pain\r\nwhere my amputated limb used to be.\u201d It therefore looks as if the\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 407\r\noccurrence of a certain process in the brain were the final and sufficient physical condition of the occurrence of this kind of experience. If so, intra-somatic perception cannot be really prehensive of one\u2019s own\r\nbody, however much it may seem to be so to the percipient, (ii) There\r\nis, however, no reason to doubt that the brain-process, which is the\r\nfinal and sufficient physical condition of an intra-somatic perception,\r\ngenerally arises from and corresponds in structure with a certain\r\nprocess in a certain other part of the percipient\u2019s body, such as his\r\nstomach or a tooth or a toe. Thus, although intra-somatic perception is probably not prehensive, there is no reason to doubt that it\r\nis generally veridical in outline if not in detail, (iii) One\u2019s awareness of one\u2019s somatic field as extended, and one\u2019s awareness of this or that outstanding bodily feeling as happening in this or that part\r\nof it, are, I think, psychologically quite primitive experiences. But\r\nthe identification of this extended somatic field with the region\r\noccupied by one\u2019s body as a visible and tangible object, and the\r\ncorrelation of each part of the former with a certain part of the latter, are, I am sure, products of early experience and association.\r\nBefore I leave the topic of normal perception I want to point out\r\na certain analogy between sight and intra-somatic perception which\r\nseems to me interesting and important. So long as it is light and\r\none\u2019s eyes are open, one really is directly apprehending something,\r\nthough it is not what one uncritically takes it to be. This something\r\nis an extended, spatially continuous, variously coloured and shaded\r\nfield, which is presented as a finite but unljoiinded whole. Outstanding coloured patches are presented as differentiations of this\r\nwhole, not as independent elements, like bricks, out of which it is built. The mistake which each of us makes is to identify this\r\ndirectly apprehended field and its differentiations with something\r\npublic, neutral, and independent of him, viz., the ground, the sky,\r\nthe surfaces of houses and trees, and so on. There really is a con- nexion between the two, but it is much more remote than we uncritically take it to be. 1 am going to sum up these facts about\r\nvisual perception by calling it synojyic and macrocosmic. Now\r\nintra-somatic perception may be described as synoptic and microcosmic. It is synoptic because the somatic field is presented as a whole,\r\nand the outstanding bodily feelings are presented as localised differ- entiations of this whole. It is microcosmic because, in apprehending\r\nit, one does not seem to oneself to be apprehendmg a public neutral\r\nworld of independent objects. On the contrary, one seems to\r\noneself to be ap])rehending in a uniquely intimate way a certain\r\nparticular object which is uniquely associated with oneself.\r\nTouch, in contrast with sight and intra-somatic perception, gives us information piecemeal about foreign bodies and the surfaces of\r\n408 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partour own bodies. And, as we have seen, it makes us aware of bodies\u2019\r\nas dynamically interacting substances. Thus sight, touch, and intrasomatic jjerception severally supply their own characteristic con-' tributions to our knowledge of ourselves and of foreign bodies. And,\r\nit is only through their co-existence and their intimate co-operationthat w'e acquire the general world-schema which is the commonbackground of daily life and of natural science.\r\nClairvoyance and Sense-Perception\r\nLet us now turn from normal perception and consider an allegedcase of clairvoyance. It is essential to take something quite concreteand not to talk vaguely. I will suppose that a special pack of cardshas been made on the following plan. Every card has for its face awhite background on which are either squares or circles, but notboth. Every card has black pips or red pips, but no card has amixture of both. There are thus four suits, which we can call RedSquares, Black Squares, Red Circles, and Black Circles. Lastly, in\r\neach suit there are ten cards in sequence from ace to ten. Thebacks of all the cards are uniformly brown. Let us suppose that thepercipient correctly guesses that the sixth card from the top of anew and mechanically shuffled pack of this kmd is the eight of redsquares. And let us suppose that such guesses of his have so oftenbeen right that we cannot ascribe his success to chance. Could wesuppose that anything analogous to normal sense-perception is taking place ? To assert that a certaui card is the eight of red squares is to assertthree independent propositions, viz., that there are eight outstandingpatches on the surface, that these are square in outline, and that theyare red in colour. Now all these propositions could be known bysight to a person who could look directly at the front of the card inwhite light. This implies that there are eight square patches onthe card, which differ physically from the background in such a waythat they selectively reflect the red-stimulating light-waves whilstthe background reflects equally hght of all wave-lengths in theordinary spectrum. Let us try to suppose that the clairvoyantgets his information by some mode of perception analogous to sightor hearing.\r\nWe shall have to suppose that the percipient\u2019s body is beingstimulated by some kind of emanation from the front of the sixthcard in the pack, although the back of the card is towards him.We shall have to suppose that the five cards which are on top of theselected one are transparent to this emanation, though they are nottransparent to light. We shall presumably have to suppose that\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 409\r\nthe five cards which are on top of this one and the thirty-four which\r\nare beneath it are all equally emitting radiation of this kind.\r\n^ Thus\r\nthe emanation from the selected card will reach the percipient\u2019s body\r\nmixed up with the emanations from all the other cards in the pack.\r\nNext we shall have to assume that, although the emanation is not\r\nlight, yet there is a characteristic difference between the emanation\r\nfrom the pips and the emanation from the background, correlated\r\nwith the difference between red-stimulating and white-stimulating\r\nlight-waves. Without this there is no hope of explaining how the\r\nclairvoyant can tell that there are pips and a background and judge\r\nthe number of pips. Still less could we explain how he can tell the\r\ncolour of the pips on the selected card. When we look more carefully into the last mentioned assumption we find that it is equivalent\r\nto the following supposition. We are, in effect, supposmg that the\r\nphysical difference between the pips and the background, which\r\nmakes the former selectively refiect red-stimulating light-waves and\r\nthe latter indifferently refiect a whole mixture of light-waves, is\r\ncorrelated with another physical difference which is concerned with\r\nanother and unknown kind of emanation. This is certainly not\r\nvery plausible. ^ We have not yet attempted to deal with the clairvoyant s knowledge that the pips on the sixth card from the top are square in\r\noutline. No assumption that we have so far made will account for\r\nthis. If the face of the card were being looked at directly in white\r\nlight, the light reflected from its surface would travel in straight\r\nlines to the percipient\u2019s eye. There it would pass through the pupil\r\nand be focussed by the lens on the retina. There it would excite\r\ndifferent parts of a certam area in various ways. The area as a\r\nwhole, and the distribution of the excitement over it, would be geometrically a projection of the surface from which the light came. From this excited area, through the optic nerve, a corresponding\r\npattern of excitement would be transmitted to the brain. At this\r\nstage the percipient would directly apprehend an outstanding oblong\r\npatch in his visual field, with a white background and eight red\r\nsquares scattered about it. This he would automatically and uncritically, but erroneously, take to be the surface of the card. In\r\norder to have any analogy with all this we should have to assume\r\nthat the emanation travels in straight lines through the medium\r\nbetween the card and the percipient\u2019s body, and that there is in his\r\nbody some organ for collecting it and focussing it on a sensitive\r\nsurface. I need hardly say that we know of no part of our bodies\r\nwhich could plausibly be regarded as such an organ. Moreover, the\r\nfact that we have had to assume that ordinary matter is transparent\r\nto this emanation makes it difficult to see how a material organ\r\n410 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partcould collect and focus it. It is like being asked to construct acamera, or a telescope, or a microscope when the only materialprovided is clear transparent glass.\r\nI have now dealt with the physical and physiological assumjDtionswhich would be involved in supposing that clairvoyant cognition is analogous to sight or hearing. It remains to consider the psychological as]\u2018)ects of this supposition. In the first place, we should haveto assume that the ultimate result of this emanation being receivedby the appropriate organs, and of the disturbance being transmittedto the appropriate part of the Ijrain, is that the clairvoyant directly\r\napprehends a total sense-field of a characteristic kind. This experi- ence must be analogous to the normal man\u2019s apprehension of his\r\nvisual or his auditory field. So far as I know, there is no introspective evidence for the occurrence of any such experience in personswho claim to be clairvoyant. We should therefore have to assumethat this peculiar kmd of sensory experience belongs to a part oftheir mind which they cannot introspect in normal waking life. Next we must assume that this peculiar sense-field is differentiated, and differentiated in a very special way. There must be in\r\nit an outstanding sensum which in fact corresponds to the sixth\r\ncard from the top of the ])ack, and there must be in this sensumeight outstanding differentiations which in fact correspond to the\r\neight pips on the face of this card. Moreover, there must be acertain determinate sensible quality in these eight outstanding differ- entiations which in fact corresponds to the visible squareness of thepips as they would appear to sight. There must also be a certain\r\nother determinate sensible quality in these eight outstanding differ- entiations which in fact corresponds to the visible redness of the pips\r\nas they would appear to sight. Although emanations are coming in on top of each other from all the cards in the pack, and presumablyfrom the table and the walls too, we must assume that the sensumspecially connected with the emanation from any particular card is distinct enough to be discriminated from the rest of the sense-field\r\nI)y the percipient if he pays enough attention. We must also assumethat such a sensum has enough discriminable detail to display those\r\nfeatures in the card which would appear to sight as a certain numberof pips of a certain shape and a certain colour.\r\nIt must be admitted that this involves a very heavy draft on the\r\nI)ank of possibility. I think that the nearest known analogy is provided I)y hearing. The waves from a number of simultaneously\r\nsounding sources, such as the instruments in an orchestra, do comein on top of each other. Yet it is possible with practice and attention\r\nto discriminate the noise which in fact comes from one instrument\r\nfrom the noise which in fact comes from another. It is also possible\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 411\r\nto distinguish overtones, if one has an acute ear, in the noise which\r\nconies from a certain instrument. This analogy, thougli it is not\r\nto be despised, does not carry us very far. The noise which in fact comes from a certahi mstrument has no auditory quality which is invariably correlated with the shape or the colour which that instrument manifests to sight. The analogy would be a little closer if, when we looked at the various instruments, they appeared to be\r\nvisibly vibrating at various rates and with various amplitudes.\r\nThen there really would be a systematic correlation between the\r\nauditory qualities of the noise which comes from a certain instrument\r\nand certain visible characteristics in the appearance which that in- strument would present to sight.\r\nWe are not yet at the end of the psychological assumptions which\r\nwe should have to make. It is not enough that there should be in\r\nthe clahvoyant\u2019s peculiar sense-field a certahi discriminable sensum\r\nwhich in fact corresponds to the sixth card from the top of the pack.\r\nIf he is to answer our question : \u201c What is the sixth card from the\r\ntop ? \u201d he must knoiv or have reason to believe, with regard to a\r\ncertahi discriminable sensum in his field, that it corresponds to the\r\nsixth card from the top. Again, it is not enough that this sensum\r\nshould have eight ditferentiations which in fact correspond to the\r\neight differentiated areas on the card which ajipear to sight as\r\neight red squares. If he is to answer our question, he must hmtv or have reason to believe that the eight differentiations in this sensum\r\ncorrespond to eight differentiated areas on the card which would\r\nappear to sight as eight red squares. He must therefore know or have reason to believe, with regard to a certain sensible quality of\r\nthese differentiations in this sensum, that it corresponds to visible\r\nsquareness. And he must know or have reason to believe, with\r\nregard to a certain other sensible quality of these differentiations,\r\nthat it corresponds to visible redness. Unless the clairvoyant knew\r\nthese facts he would be in much the same ])osition as a man born\r\nblind who had acquired plenty of tactual experience and was then\r\nsuddenly enabled to see. In the visual field of such a man there\r\nwould be outstanding coloured patches which are in fact visual\r\nappearances of various things from which he has already received\r\ntactual sensations. And the visible shape of these visual sensa would in fact correspond to the tangible shape of the corresponding\r\ntactual sensa. But the newly cured blind man would not know these\r\nfacts or have any reason to suspect them. So, if we were to ask him\r\na question about an object which he has touched in the past and\r\nis no longer touching but is seeing for the first time, his visual\r\nexperience would not help him in the least to answer it. It is not\r\nuntil his experiences of sight and touch have become correlated and\r\n412 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partassociated, so that a certain kind of visual appearance has come torepresent for him a certain kind of tactual apjiearance, that his newly'acquired power of visual perception will enable him to answer ourquestions about external objects.\r\nHow could the clairvoyant acquire such knowledge or belief aswe have had to assign to him ? The extremely intimate associationbetween sight and touch, which is established in infancy in all normalpeople, seems to provide the only helpful analogy. Here we mustsubstitute for it an intimate association between sight and thepeculiar kind of sense-experience which we have assumed the clair- voyant to possess. We shall have to suppose that all or most thingswhich are visible also emit the peculiar emanation which gives rise\r\nto this peculiar kuid of sense-experience when it reaches the clair- voyant\u2019s body. And we mxist suppose that every variation in thelight reflected from bodies is correlated with a corresponding variation in this emanation. On this assumption, the clairvoyant will\r\nfrom infancy have been apprehending two co-existing and intimatelycorrelated sense-flelds, viz., the normal visual held and the peculiarsense-field connected with the emanation. This may be comparedwith the case of the plain man who apprehends from infancy avisual and a tactual field which are intimately correlated with eachother. The difference is that the normal man is constantly awareof apprehending both the visual and the tactual field, whilst theclairvoyant in ordinary waking life is not aware of apprehending thepecuhar sense-field connected with the emanation. In consequenceof this constant and detailed correlation between the contents ofthe visual sense-field and those of the peculiar sense-field, in theclairvoyant\u2019s case, an intimate association will be established in his\r\nmind between the two, just as an intimate association is established\r\nin the case of the normal man between his visual and his tactual\r\nsense-fields.\r\nWhen a normal man in the dark has a tactual sensation of a certamfamiliar kind, which has become associated through frequent past\r\nex]:)erience in the light with a certain kind of visual appearance, heis able to describe in visual terms the object which he is at present\r\nonly touching and not seeing. Similarly, when the clairvoyant hasa familiar sensation of his own peculiar kind, which has becomeassociated through frequent past experience with a certam kind of\r\nvisual appearance, he will be able to describe in visual terms the object which is evoking this sensation by its emanation but is at present hidden from his view.\r\nIt seems at first sight most unplausible to postulate in the clair- voyant\u2019s mind a whole special group of sensations of which he is totally unaware, and then to postulate that they are intimately\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 413\r\ncorrelated with, his ordinary visual sensations and eventnally become\r\nassociated with the latter. Yet it must, I thinlc, be confessed that\r\na very similar postulate is unblushmgly made by the most orthodox\r\npsychologists in trying to explain normal visual perception of\r\ndistance and solidity. We are told a great deal by these scientists\r\nin this connexion about sensations of accommodation and sensations\r\nof convergence. We are told that these become so intimately associated with purely visual sensations that the minutest variation in\r\nthe one represents to the percipient a corresponding variation in the\r\nother. But the fact remams that most of us at most times are quite unaware of these constantly occurring and continually varying\r\nsensations of accommodation and convergence. If we focus our\r\neyes for a long time on a very small and very near object, we may\r\nbegin to notice sensations of accommodation. If we indulge in\r\nelaborate and deliberate squinting, we may notice sensations of\r\nconvergence. But it is only in these exceptional circumstances that\r\nsuch sensations are noticed or noticeable by the person who, presumably, is in fact never free from them. So orthodox psychologists\r\nare not in a position to cast stones at the postulates which would\r\nhave to be made about the clairvoyant\u2019s special sense-field.\r\nI have now enumerated and explained the various assumptions,\r\nphysical, physiological, and psychological, which would have to be\r\nmade if clairvoyance is to be regarded as a peculiar kind of senseperception, emissive ui its physical aspect, like sight or hearing. It must be confessed that they make a formidable list. But it is better\r\nto set them out fully and to face them squarely than to talk vaguely\r\nof analogies to wireless and television and \u201c the marvels of\r\nmodern science.\u201d Many people will be mclined, when faced with\r\nthis hst of necessary assumptions, to conclude that the attempt\r\nto make clairvoyance analogous to sight or hearing must be\r\ndropped.\r\nNow, unless clairvoyance be analogous to a physically emissive\r\nform of sense-perception, like sight or hearing, it can hardly be\r\nanalogous to any form of normal sense-perception. If we tried to\r\ncompare it with touch, we should have to suppose that the clair- voyant\u2019s body is provided with invisible and intangible organs,\r\nsupplied with sensitive spots on their surface and with conducting\r\nnerves. W^e should have to suppose that he can tlmust these out\r\nand poke them between two cards which are, and remain throughout\r\nthe experiment, visibly in continuous contact with each other. And\r\nwe should have to suppose that the square areas ou the card which\r\ndiffer from the background by selectively reflecting red-stimulating\r\nlight-waves also differ from the background by giving a special kind\r\nof stimulus to the sensitive spots on this quasi-tactile organ. It 2e\r\n414 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partscorns liardly woi tli wliile to linger over these fantastic sii])positions,or to consider wliat others might lie needed in addition to them.\r\nPerha])S some ]isychical researchers will welcome these conclusions.They will remind us that they have always insisted that clairvoyancecannot he analogous to any form of sense-perception, and they willfeel that I have only lieen underlining the obvious. I cannot sharetheir satisfaction. Have those who believe that clairvoyance occurs,and deny that it is analogous to any form of sense-perce})tion, anypositive notion of its ])sychological nature or its modus ojjerandi ? If they have, it is most desirable that they should expound it. Ifthey have not, they are just postulating what Locke would havecalled \u201c a something, I know not what.\u201d Since their postulate willthen have no discernible analogy or connexion with anything thatis already known and admitted to be a fact, it will be impossible toassign a degree of antecedent probability or improbability to it. In that case we shall be unable to come to any rationally justifieddegree of belief or dislielief when they produce their empiricalevidence, however impressive it may be.\r\nCdairvoyance as Non-sensuous Prehension of Physical Objects\r\nThe only intelligible positive interjiretation which I can put onthis view of clairvoyance is the following. Those who deny thatclairvoyance is analogous to any form of sense-perception mightsu])pose that the clairvoyant really does directly apprehend remote])hysical objects, as the ordinary man seems to Inmself to do in sightand touch. This supposition is, I think, prima facie intelligible. AsI have said in discussing normal sense-jierception, each of us reallydoes directly ajiprchend something when he is seeing, hearing, etc. In seeing, e.g., one is directly apprehending an extended continuousvariegated coloured field ; though one uncritically mistakes it forsomething else, of a rpiite different nature, which one does not directlyap])rehend. So we can understand, in general outline at any rate,what we are being asked to suppose in the case of the clairvoyant.But, as soon as we begin to consider the suggestion in detail, it becomes less and less intelligible. The card called the \u201c eight of redsquares \u201d is a physical object which, when suitably illuminated, reflects light-waves. If these reach the eye of a normal human observer, they stimulate it in a characteristic way, and at a certainstage in the jiroccss a characteristic kind of disturbance is set up in\r\nhis optic centres. If and only if all this should happen, the card will\r\n1 )e represented in the observer\u2019s visual field by an outstanding whiteoblong sensum with eight outstanding square spots on it. There is not the faintest reason to believe that the card itself, which is the\r\n142] Normal Cognition,, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 415\r\nlocus of a remote causal ancestor in this long and variegated chain\r\nof events, has literally and intrinsically any colour whatever. That\r\nwhich corresponds in a physical object to the colour which it is perceived as having is presumably some special configuration or some rhythmic motion of its minute constituents, which causes it to reflect certain kinds of light-waves and to absorb others. If, then,\r\nthe clairvoyant directly apjirehends the card, as it intrinsically and\r\nindependently is, he will not apprehend it as a thing with a white\r\ncontinuous surface on which there are eight square red spots ; for\r\nit is almost certainly nothing of the kind. He might, perhaps, apprehend it as a swarm of very small colourless electric charges in very\r\nrapid rhythmic motion ; for, according to the best information\r\navailable at present to those of us who are not clairvoyants, this or something like this is what the card most probably is. Now, if clairvoyants do directly ajtprehend physical objects as having those characteristics which scientists laboriously infer that\r\nthey must have, they show no sign of being aware of their own\r\nknowledge. If they were, they could presumably put it, at least\r\nroughly and in outline, into words. They would then be invaluable\r\nhelpers in all physical laboratories ; for their information, artlessly\r\nexpressed but \u201c straight from the horse\u2019s mouth,\u201d would suffice to\r\nhead scientists off from plausible but false theories and to suggest\r\nfruitful lines of experiment and speculation. We shall have to\r\nassume, then, that the clairvoyant\u2019s direct apprehension of physical\r\nobjects, as they intrinsically are, occurs in a part of his mind which\r\nis cut off from his ordinary waking experience.\r\nThe clairvoyant describes the unseen card in terms of colours,\r\nvisible shapes, etc., and not in terms of electric charges, waves, and\r\nrhythmic motions. We shall therefore have to explain how he\r\ntranslates his direct apprehension of the unseen card, as it intrinsically is, into the colours, visible sha])es, etc., which it would appear\r\nto have if it were being seen by a normal human being in daylight.\r\nIt will be renrembered that there is a rather similar problem for\r\nthose who regard clairvoyance as a peculiar form of sense-x^erception.\r\nThe suggestion which I made in that connexion might, qjerhaxjs, be\r\nmodified to deal with the present problem. We shall have to suppose\r\nthat the clairvoyant has, from infancy, been continuously though\r\nunconsciously apx)rehending directly all those objects which he has\r\nalso been cognising indirectly through sight and touch. Then we\r\ncan suppose that an association woidd be set up between, e.g., the\r\nconscious exj^erience of seeing an object as red and the unconscious\r\nexperience of directly apprehending it as having that intrinsic\r\ncharacteristic which makes it selectively reflect red-stimulating\r\nlight-waves. Suppose that, on some future occasion, such an object.\r\n416 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partthough no lo]iger visible, is still being directly Init unconsciouslya])j)rehended by the clairvoyant. He will still apjjrehend it ashaving that intrinsic characteristic, whatever it may be, which hasnow become associated in his mind with the visual appearance ofredness. Consecpiently the idea of it as a red-looking object willarise automatically in his mind, and he will announce that the \\mseen object is red.\r\nI have now stated and tried to work out in some detail two alternative views of what clairvoyance would be if it took place. Neitherof them is in the least attractive or plausible, but I know of no otheralternative that is even intelligible. I hope that some of those whothink that there is adequate evidence for clairvoyance will be ins])ired to suggest some other view of it which will be equally intelligil)le and much more ]ilausible. Though I can offer no hint of asolution, I may possildy have given them some help by setting outelements of the ])robleni in a clear and orderly way.\r\nTelepathy\r\nTeleqxithic Interaction\r\nIt is comnronly assumed that one embodied mind can affectanother only in an extremely roundabout way. It must first affectits own body ; then this change in its own body must set iip a seriesof physical changes which eventually affect another ensouled body; and, finally, this change in the other ensouled body must produce achange in the mind which animates it. Thus the process involves apsycho] )hysiological transaction at one end, a physiologico-psychicaltransaction at the other end, and a purely physical causal seriesbetween the two. A further restriction is commonly imposed on thisgeneral scheme. It is usually assumed that the process set up withinthe one ensouled body must issue in some overt macroscopic changeof it, such as emitting a sound, making a gesture, or assuming a newfacial expression ; and it is assumed that this must affect the otherensouled body by sight, hearing, touch, or some such form of normalsensory stimulus. The wider assumption may be summed up in thefollowing general principle : \u201c The only thing, other than itself,\r\nwith which an embodied mind can directly interact is the brain andnervous system of the body which it animates.\u201d If this be granted,the rest follows.\r\nWe can now imagine various stages in which the commonsenseassum])tion might be given up. (i) We might keep the general principle, but drop the further restriction which is commonly put on it. We might supj)Ose that, in certain cases, the disturbance set up inA\u2019s brain by an event in his mind mitiates a physical process of an\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 417\r\nemanative kind whick travels out in all directions ; that this may\r\nset up a disturbance in B\u2019s brain, if it reaches the latter ; and that\r\nthis disturbance in B\u2019s brain may affect his mind. On this view\r\nthere need be no overt macroscopic change in A\u2019s body, such as emitting a noise, makmg a gesture, etc. And B\u2019s brain need not be\r\nstimulated through any of the ordinary sense-organs by what is happening in A\u2019s body. Yet the general prmcij)le about interaction\r\nwill remain intact.\r\n(ii) The next stage would be to drop one half of the general principle and to keep the other half. This would give two possible alter- natives. (a) We might continue to assmne that A\u2019s mind can directly\r\naffect only A\u2019s bram, and that B\u2019s mind can directly affect only\r\nB\u2019s bram. But we might now suppose that A\u2019s mind can, in some\r\ncases, be directly affected by disturbances in B\u2019s brain ; and that\r\nB\u2019s mind can, m some cases, be directly affected by disturbances in\r\nA\u2019s bram. (6) We might contmue to assume that A\u2019s mind can be\r\ndirectly affected only by A\u2019s bram, and that B\u2019s mmd can be\r\ndirectly affected only by B\u2019s brain. But we might now suppose that\r\nA\u2019s mind can, in some cases, directly produce disturbances in B\u2019s\r\nbrain ; and that B\u2019s mmd can, in some cases, directly produce disturbances in A\u2019s brain.\r\n(in) Lastly, we might drop the general jninciple altogether. We\r\nmight suppose that, in certain cases, one embodied mind can affect or be affected by another embodied mmd directly, without any\r\nphysiological or physical mediation. I propose to call the first alternative the \u201c Brain-wave Theory,\u201d and the third alternative the\r\n\u201c Theory of Direct Intermental Transaction.\u201d Theories of the\r\nsecond kind might be called \u201c Theories of Extended Psychophysiological Interaction.\u201d I camiot pretend that this is a \u201csnappy \u201d\r\ntitle, but I think it is accurately descriptive.\r\nIf either of these three suppositions were ever reahsed in j>ractice\r\nwe should say that there had been a case of \u201c Telepathic Interaction.\u201d If it were an instance of the Brain-wave Theory it would\r\ninvolve no supernormal interaction between mind and matter or between mind and mhid. It would involve nothing but an miusual\r\ntransaction between two brams and an intervening physical medium.\r\nIf it were an mstance of either form of the Theory of Extended\r\nPsycho-physiological Interaction it would mvolve supernormal\r\ninteraction between mind and matter, but no direct interaction\r\nbetween mind and mind. The supernormality of the transaction\r\nwould consist in the fact that an event in one man\u2019s mind directly\r\naffects or is directly affected by an event m another man\u2019s brain. If\r\nit were an instance of the Theory of Direct Intermental Transaction\r\nit would involve supernormal interaction between two embodied\r\n418 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part1\r\nminds, but it would not necessarily involve any supernormal interaction between mind and matter. *\r\nIf the Brain-wave Theory would fit the empirical facts, it wouldjbe preferable to the other two in respect of antecedent probability.IBut the general opinion of those who have studied the facts seemsto be definitely adverse to this theory. ;In favour of the Theory of Extended Psycho-physiological Interaction it may be said that we do know that each embodied minddirectly affects and is directly affected by at least one brain and ner-vous system, though this kind of transaction has to be accepted as acompletely mysterious brute fact. This one brain and nervoussystem is, of course, that of the one material system to which thismind stands in the peculiar relation of \u201c animating.\u201d Now thetheory under discussion is that this direct interaction between mindsand brains, which is admitted to occur, is not necessarily or iavariably restricted within these limits. Either the range within whichdirect interaction between a mind and a body is possible extendsbeyond the limits marked out by the relation of animation, or therelation of animation extends more widely than commonsenserecognises. The latter suggestion amounts to supposing that anembodied human mind may animate a material system whichincludes, in addition to one human body, parts of another humanbody which is animated by another human mind. This relationmight be mutual as between two human individuals A and B. A\u2019smind might animate a material system which includes, beside whatwe call \u201c A\u2019s body,\u201d a part of what we call \u201c B\u2019s body \u201d\r\n; and B\u2019smind might animate a material system which includes, beside whatwe call \u201c B\u2019s body,\u201d a part of what we eall \u201c A\u2019s body.\u201d In somecases of multiple personality it looks as if there were two mindssimidtaneously animating either the whole of a eommon brain andnervous system, or, at any rate, animating two parts of it whichoverlap each other. This at least supplies empirical support forthe general conclusion that the relation of animation between mindsand bodies is not always one-to-one. If two minds can animateone body, it may not be unreasonable to contemplate the possibilitythat one mind may animate one body and a bit of another body.\r\nThese speculations are, I know, very wild ; but I make no apologyfor them on that account. The admitted relation of animationbetween the mind and the body of a normal human individual, andthe admitted interactions between the two, are so mysterious thatwe are left with a wide field for legitimate conjectures. The situationis very different from that which faced us when we were consideringnormal sense-perception and alleged clairvoyance. We have a greatdeal of positive knowledge about normal sense-perception, in its\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 419\r\nphysical, its physiological, and its epistemological aspects ; so the\r\nfield for legitimate conjecture is there much narrower. Passing finally to the Theory of Direct Intermental Transaction,\r\nwe must, I think , assign to it the lowest antecedent probability of\r\nthe three typical theories. So far as I am aware, it is supported by\r\nno known analog}\u2019 with admitted facts. We should, therefore,\r\nhesitate to resort to it unless the evidence rules out all theories of\r\nthe other two types.\r\nTelepathic Cognition\r\nWe have so far considered the possible causal relations between\r\ntwo embodied minds ; we must now turn our attention to what\r\nprimarily concerns us in this paper, viz., the possible cognitive relations between them. It is important to be quite clear that these are\r\ndifferent problems, for the word \u201c Telepathy \u201d seems often to be\r\ncarelessly used to cover both supernormal causal influence of one embodied mind on another and supernormal cognition of one embodied mind by another. We have given the name \u201c Telepathic\r\nInteraction \u201d to the former, and we will call the latter \u201c Telepathic\r\nCognition.\u201d Probably telepathic cognition would be impossible\r\nwithout telepathic interaction, but there is not the least reason why there should not be telepathic interaction without telepathic\r\ncognition. Cognising or being cognised, on the one hand, and\r\naffecting causally or being affected causally, on the other, are utterly\r\ndifferent relations. If either of them can be analysed, which is\r\ndoubtful, it is certain that neither of them forms any part of the\r\nanalysis of the other. So there can be no logical impossibility in\r\ntwo terms being related by one of them and not by the other. And,\r\nif it be granted that two minds could influence each other telepathically at all, it is quite easy to imagme that two minds which\r\nremained completely ignorant of each other might yet be ui fact\r\ninfluencing each other frequently and profoundly by telepathic\r\ninteraction.\r\nHaving made this distinction clear, we can now turn our attention\r\nto the cognition by one mind of another mmd and its experiences.\r\nI shall begin by stating and explaining two principles which are commonly, if tacitly, assumed to apply to embodied human minds\r\nand their normal cognitions. The first is that one and the same\r\nexperience cannot be owned by more than one mind. I do not think\r\nthat anyone would question this. It is true that we sometimes use\r\nexpressions which, if hterally interpreted, would imply that one and the same experience is owned by several minds. \\\\ e might, e.g., say of two people who both beheve that Francis wrote the Letters of\r\nJunius that they both have the same behef about the authorship of\r\n420 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partthe Junius letters. But we all recognise at once that such state-ments are not to be taken hterally. One belief that Francis wrotethese letters occurs in A\u2019s mind and not in B\u2019s ; another belief thatFrancis wrote these letters occurs in B\u2019s mind and not in A\u2019s. Whenwe tall-: of the same behef occurring in two minds we mean that twobeliefs, which stand in a common relation to one and the same fact,viz., the actual but unknown authorship of the Junius letters, areoccurring, and that one belongs to one mind and the other belongsto the other mind. A similar interpretation would have to be puton any statement that seemed to conflict wfth our jjrinciple. Wewill call this the \u201c Principle of Unique Ownership of Experiences.\u201dW e come now to the second principle. It may be stated as follows.Any particular existent which can be directly apprehended by anembodied mind can be dii\u2019ectly apprehended only by one such mind.Let us consider what kinds of jjarticular existents a given embodiedmind M can directly apprehend. They are (i) M itself, perhaps ; (ii) some, if not all, of M\u2019s experiences ; (iii) certain mental images ; (iv) somatic sensa connected with the jJi\u2019Ocesses in M\u2019s body ; and(v) certain visual, tactual, auditory, and other kinds of extrasomatic sensa. Of course the plain man would have included m thislist something which we have not included, viz., the surfaces ofcertain foreign bodies and of his own body, and certain kinds ofevents happening from time to time in such bodies. And he wouldnot have mentioned certani items which W\u2019e have included, viz.,\r\nvarious kinds of sensa. The cause of both these differences is thesame, viz., the fact that the plain man mistakes what he directlyapprehends in sense-perception for parts of physical objects andevents in such objects. We have seen that he does not directlyapprehend such particidar existents, and so we have had to excludethem from our list. But we have also seen that he really is apprehending particular existents of some kind in sense-perception, andso we have had to introduce them into our list under the technicalname of \u201c sensa.\u201d\r\nNow let us go through the list, and we shall see that, if it is ex- haustive, it proves our principle, (i) Everyone would agree thatnormally no embodied mmd but M could directly apprehend M.(ii) Everyone would agree that normally no embodied mind butM could directly apprehend any of M\u2019s experiences, (iii) Everyonewould agree that normally no embodied mind but M could directly\r\naj)prehend any mental image that M can directly apprehend,(iv) Everyone would agree that normally no embodied mind but Mcould directly apprehend the aches and pains and pressure-data andso on which arise in connexion with processes in M\u2019s body, (v) Asregards extra-somatic sensa a difference of opinion might arise, but\r\n142 ] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 421\r\nit would certainly be due to verbal confusion. A person might say : \u201c A noise is an extra-somatic sensum. Now we all know that M and\r\nN may both hear the same noise. So N can directly apprehend an\r\nextra-somatic sensum which is also being directly apprehended by\r\nM.\u201d There is nothing in this argument. When M and N are\r\ncorrectly said to be \u201c hearmg the same noise \u201d each is directly apprehenduig a different auditory sensum. But these two auditory sensa\r\nare related in a certain characteristic way to each other, and they\r\nare manifestations of a common physical event at a remote common\r\nsource. When the fact that normal sense-perception is not really\r\nprehensive ofexternal obj ects is clearly understood and firmly grasped,\r\nand when the various verbal confusions which have arisen from its\r\nbeing ostensibly prehensive have been removed, we see that there is\r\nnot the least reason to believe that, in normal life, N can ever directly\r\napprehend any sensum which M can directly apprehend, or vice versa. Now I thhik that, with the explanations which I have just given,\r\nit will be admitted that the above list includes all the various kinds\r\nof particular existents which any embodied muid, under normal\r\nconditions, could directly apprehend. And we have now seen, with\r\nregard to each of these classes of particulars, that any member of it which can be directly apprehended by any one embodied mind\r\nM cannot, under normal conditions, be directly apprehended by any\r\nother embodied mind. And so we reach our second general principle .\r\n\u201c Any particular existent which can be directly apprehended by an\r\nembodied mind can be directly apprehended only by one such mmd.\u201d\r\nI will call this the \u201c Principle of the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars.\u201d\r\nBefore gomg further I will make some remarks on these two principles. (i) The Unique Ownership of Experiences is ui a much\r\nstronger position than the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars. Many\r\npeople would say that it is self-evidently impossible that one and\r\nthe same experience should literally be an experience of two mmds,\r\nno matter whether the minds were embodied or disembodied, in a normal or an abnormal condition, or what not. Without committing myself to this view, I must admit that it is highly plausible.\r\nNow the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars, as a general principle,\r\nis not in the least self-evident. We reached it simply by a process of\r\nenumeration and inspection, and there is no apparent absurdity in\r\nsupposing that there might be exceptions to it. As we have seen commonsense does unhesitatingly take for granted that, in normal\r\nvisual perception, one and the same particular can be, and often is,\r\ndirectly apprehended by several embodied minds. We rejected this,\r\nnot m the least because it seemed intrinsically absurd or impossible,\r\nbut because it was impossible to reconcile it with the relevant em-\r\n422 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partpirical facts taken as a whole. The outcome of this comparisonbetween the two principles is that an alleged exception to the Privacyof Prehensible Particulars has an appreciable antecedent probability, whilst an alleged exception to the Unique Ownership ofExperiences has far less, if any at all.\r\n(ii) Some people have held that images and sensa are themselvesexperiences. Many others, who have not gone so far as this, havetaken a view which may be roughly expressed as follows. Theyhave held that a mental image can exist only as a logically inseparable factor in someone\u2019s experience of imaging it, and that a sensumcan exist only as a logically inseparable factor in someone\u2019s experi-ence of sensing it. If either of these views were accepted, we couldreplace the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars by the followingprinciple ; \u201cNo embodied mind can directly apprehend anythingbut itself, its own experiences, and objects which are logically in-separable factors in its own experiences.\u201d This principle does notseem to me to have any better claim to l)e self-evident than thePrivacy of Prehensible Particulars. And I am not convinced thateither of these two views about sensa and images is true. So 1prefer to keep the second principle in the form in which I originallystated it.\r\n(iii) Some people have held that, whenever a mind has an experience, it directly apprehends that experience. Others have held that,whenever a mind has had. an experience, it could have directly apprehendcd that experience if it had attended, though it may not in facthave done so. If we accept either of these views, and combine it with the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars, the Unique Ownershipof Experiences follows as a logical consequence. For suppose, ifjmssible, that two minds, M and N, both owned a certain experienceE. According to the view under discussion M could or would directlyapprehend E, since E is an experience of M\u2019s. Similarly, on theview under discussion, N coidd or would directly apprehend E,since E is also an experience of N\u2019s. Therefore E could be directlyapprehended by two different minds, which is contrary to the Privacy of Prehensible particulars. So the supposition that E couldbe owned by two minds must be rejected if the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars is to be retamed and the view under discussion is to be accepted.\r\nThis result seems to me to be of logical interest rather than ofpractical importance. In the first place, the view that, whenever amind has an experience, it directly apprehends that experience, seems to me obviously false. And the view that, whenever a mmdhas had an experience, it could have directly apprehended thatexperience if it had attended, seems to me quite imcertain. Put,\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 423\r\neven if one or other of these doctrines were indubitable, it would\r\nstill be a logical perversion to base the Unique Ownership of Experiences on it and the Privacy of Prehensible Objects. For, as we have\r\nseen, the Unique Ownership of Experiences has some claim to be\r\nself-evident, whilst the Privacy of Prehensible Objects has no such\r\nclaim. We should therefore be basing the stronger of two propositions on the weaker. I conclude then that the two principles are\r\nbest regarded as independent propositions.\r\n(a) Telepathic Prehension\r\nWe have now stated, explained, and commented on the two principles which are assumed by commonsense to govern the region with\r\nwhich we are at present concerned. We can look upon telepathic\r\ncognition as mvolving a real or apparent breach of one or other of\r\nthese principles. Any breach of the Privacy of Prehensible Objects\r\nwould, ipso facto, be an instance of telepathic cognition. To be more\r\nprecise, it would be an mstance of what I will call \u201c Telepathic Prehension.\u201d Under this heading would come the followmg five\r\npossible cases, (i) One mind directly apprehendmg another mirid\r\nas a unit, (ii) One mind directly apprehending an experience which\r\nis occurring in another mind, (iii) One mind directly apprehending\r\na mental image which is being imaged by another mhid. (iv) One\r\nmind directly apprehending a somatic sensum which is being sensed\r\nby another mind and is the manifestation of a process going on in\r\nthe body which that other mmd animates, (v) One mind directly\r\napprehendmg a visual, tactual, or auditory sensum which is being\r\nsensed by another mind in seeing, touching, or hearing an external\r\nobject. Telepathic prehension of the first kind seems to be clahned\r\nfor Mrs. Willett (see Lord Balfour\u2019s paper, Proc. S.P.R., Part 140,\r\npp. 90-94). There are plenty of cases which look, prinia facie, as if they were instances of the four remaming kinds. Are they really so ? In considering this question the first point to notice is the following. A breach of the Unique Ownership of Experiences would not\r\nbe ipso facto an instance of telepathic prehension, for in itself it would not be an instance of cognition at all. It would best be\r\ndescribed as an instance of \u201c Intermental Confluence.\u201d But, it intermental confluence were to take place, telepathic prehension\r\nwould almost certainly follow as an immediate consequence of it. Suppose, e.g., that, through mental confluence, N\u2019s experience of\r\nsensing a certain sensum or of imaging a certaui mental image were\r\nalso an experience of M\u2019s. Then M woidd be sensing or imaging the\r\nvery same sensum or image which N is sensmg or imaging. Now\r\nsensing and imagmg are instances of directly apprehendmg. So\r\nM would be directly apprehending a sensum which N is sensing or\r\n424 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partan image which N is imaging. And, of course, the converse wouldalso be true. So, if there were hitermental confluence of this kindbetween M and N, there would necessarily be telepathic prehensionof sensa or images by both M and N. This particular example canat once be generalised. If any experience which is a direct apprehension of a jiarticular were, through mental confluence, owned byboth M and N, M would be directly apprehending something whichN is directly ap>prehending, and conversely.\r\nWe have seen, however, that intermental confluence would beruled out by many people as self-evidently impossible. So we maynow put the following question. Supposing that we rule out intermental confluence, is there any need to assume that telepathic prehension occurs 1 It seems to me quite unnecessary to assume this inorder to account for successful experimental results in which oneperson conveys supernormally to another figures which he sees ordraws, images which he calls up and fixes, or bodily feelings whichhe is experiencing. All that we need to suppose here is a particularform of telepathic interaction. It is enough to suppose that theoccurrence ol a certain sensation or unagination or bodily feeling in\r\nM s mind causally determines in N\u2019s mind the occurrence of a sensation with a similar sensum, or of an imagination with a similarimage, or of a bodily feeling with a similar quahty and feeling-tone.\r\nIn experiments it may generally be assumed that N knows that it\r\nis M, and no one else, who is trying to convey an impression to him.And it may generally be assumed that he knows roughly at what timeM is going to try the experiment. Suppose that, at about the agreedtime, N suddenly has a sensation or bodily feeling or becomes awareof an image. Suppose that there is no noticeable feature in N\u2019ssurroundhigs at the time, or in his immediately previous train ofthought, which would supply an obvious normal explanation for theoccurrence of just this experience at just this moment. Then hewill naturally suspect that the experience is caused by M, whomhe knows to be experimenting at the time. So there is no needwhatever to assume that N has any telepathic prehension of\r\nM or of M\u2019s experiences, however successful such experimentsmay be.\r\nSo far as I can see, it is quite possible that each of us may be\r\noften, or even continuously, influenced telepathically by other\r\nminds, and yet this fact might always have escaped notice. Supposethat an event in M\u2019s mind does in fact determine telepathically anevent in N\u2019s mmd. N will have no reason to regard this as aninstance of telepathic interaction unless all the followmg conditions\r\nare tulfilled. (i) The effect on N must take the form of an experience\r\nwhich he can and does notice. Now the effect might equally well\r\n142 ] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 425\r\nbe a change in his mental dispositions, or be an experience which\r\nhe does not or cannot notice.\r\n(ii) Tills experience must be so discontinuous with his other con- temporary and immediately past experiences and with his usual\r\ntrains of association that he is surprised by it and is led to suspect\r\nthat it is not caused normally. Now this condition would seldom\r\nbe fulfilled. Very often I suddenly image an image, visual or auditory, which seems quite disconnected with my other contemporary\r\nand immediately past experiences and with my usual trains of\r\nassociation. But even I, who am professionally interested in such\r\nthings, tend to dismiss it as just one more unexplained oddity in\r\nthe workings of my mind. Most people are occupied for most of\r\ntheir lives in practical dealings with other people and things ; so an experience of theirs would have to be very odd indeed before they\r\nwould seriously raise the question whether it was or was not caused\r\nnormally. Moreover, if an experience in N\u2019s mind be telepathically\r\ncaused by an event in M\u2019s mind, the event in M\u2019s mind would never be the complete immediate cause of it. It would at most be one of the\r\nimmediate necessary conditions. Another, and equally necessary,\r\nfactor in the total immediate cause of this experience of N\u2019s would\r\nbe the permanent dispositions, the acquired associations, and the\r\ncontemporary or immediately past experiences of N himself. There\r\nis therefore no reason to beheve that most telepathically caused\r\nexperiences would be so outstanding and discontinuous as to attract\r\nthe special attention of the experient.\r\n(iii) Even if N notices this experience with surprise, and is led\r\nto wonder whether it may not be telepathically caused, he can get no further unless he can discover that, at about the same time, a\r\ncertain other person was having an experience which was specially\r\nclosely related to his own. Now this condition could not be fulfilled\r\nunless all the followmg conditions were also fulfilled, (a) M, the\r\nperson who is in fact the telepathic agent in this transaction, would\r\nneed to be known to N, the telepathic patient, or they would need\r\nto have common friends. Now it is obvious that M and N might be\r\ncomplete strangers. (6) The event in M\u2019s mind which telepathically\r\ndetermined this exjjerience in N\u2019s mind would have to be an experi- ence which M noticed and could describe to N or to their mutual\r\nfriends. Now the event might not have been an experience at all\r\n;\r\nit might have been a change in the dispositional structure of M s mind. Or the event might have been an experience which M did not\r\nor could not notice, (c) There would have to be some specially inti- mate observable relation between M\u2019s experience and N\u2019s experience,\r\nwhich would make it reasonable to single out the former as a factor\r\nin the total cause of the latter. The only two relations that I can\r\n426 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partthink of in this connexion are likeness and the relation of fulfilmentto intention. The first would hold if the two experiences were alikein quality or if they were jirehensions of similar objects. Thesecond would hold if M\u2019s experience were that of intending to produce in N an experience of a certain kind, and if N\u2019s contemporaryexjierience were in fact of the kind intended. Plainly there is notthe least reason to su])pose that either of these very sjjecial relationswould hold as a rule between the telepathic cause-factor and theexperience which it co-operates in producing. An effect may beextremely unlike every one of the factors in its immediate totalcause. And most telepathic interaction may be entirely unintentional.\r\nThe upshot of the above discussion is this. If telepathic interaction takes place at all, it may well be a very common occurrence.Put it will be noticeable only when a large number of independentand rather special conditions are simultaneously fulfilled. And,when these conditions are fulfilled, so that it does become noticeable,the experience which is telepathically produced in N will be veryliable to be mistaken for a telepathic prehension by N of that experi-ence of M\u2019s which is its telepathic causal determinant. It is easy tofind analogies in the physical sciences to the situation which I havejust shown to be possible about telepathy. Consider, e.g., ordinarymagnetic forces, and the history of our knowledge of them. Suchforces occur whenever electric charges are moving or electric forcesare varying, and they pervade all space at all times and are profoundly important factors in the physical world. Yet they wouldhardly have been discovered had it not been for the happy accidentsthat the earth contains a good deal of the one element, viz., iron,\r\nwhich is very strongly siisceptible to magnetic forces ; that it contains natural magnets, viz., lodestones ; and that it is itself a naturalmagnet. For centuries magnetism seemed to be a freak of naturewhich occurred exclusively in connexion with certain very specialkinds of matter. Yet in fact it was all the time operating everywhere. And the very sj^ecial characteristics which it displays inconnexion with iron and with permanent magnets, masked its realnature almost as much as they revealed it. I have now said all that seems necessary in support of my contention that experiments in telepathy, however successful they may be,would prove only telepathic interaction, of one or other of the threekinds which we distinguished as theoretically possible. They wouldnot force us to abandon the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars andto ])ostulate telepathic prehension. It remains to consider two otherkinds of ostensibly telejjathic phenomena, for which there is ampleevidence, some of which is of excellent quality. The first is spon-\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 427\r\nI taneous telepathy, such as is reported iu Phantasms of the Living.\r\nI The second is the supernormal knowledge which mediums often\r\ndisplay with regard to facts known to the sitter or to some other\r\n: living person.\r\nA good many cases of spontaneous telepathy can be regarded\r\nas similar in princijrle to the cases of experimental telepathy which\r\nI we have already considered. Suppose that M, sitting in his diningroom in a mood of intense depression, eventually takes poison,\r\nsuffers great bodily pain, and dies. Suppose that there arise in N\u2019s\r\nij mind, through telepathic interaction, visual sensations or visual\r\n|| imaginations very much like those which M is experiencing through\r\nli normal visual perception of his surroundings. If N is familiar with\r\nI M\u2019s dining-room, his telepathically induced visual experiences will\r\n!' naturally make him think of that room and of M. Suppose next\r\nthat there arises in N\u2019s mind, through telepathic interaction, a\r\nfeeling of intense depression very much like that which M is experiencing because of illness, financial trouble, or some other normal\r\ncause. It will be natural for N to connect together these two simultaneous abnormal experiences, and to suspect that there is some-\r\n: thing seriously wrong with M. Suppose finally that there arises in N\u2019s\r\nmmd, through telepathic interaction, a sensation of intense bodily\r\npain very much like that which M is experiencing in consequence of\r\ni the action of the poison on his body. It will be natural for N to\r\ni assume that M must be very ill and perhaps dying. If N shoidd be\r\nasleep or in a dreamy state when the telepathic interaction takes\r\nplace, it is extremely likely that the data supplied, and the normal\r\nassociations which they excite, will be supplemented by a great\r\ndeal of imagery. The whole thing may then be worked iip into a\r\nvivid dream or waking hallucination, with the gaps filled in and the\r\ninconsistencies smoothed out correctly or incorrectly. No kind of\r\ntelepathic prehension needs to be postulated here. Nothing need\r\nbe assumed except the special kind of telepathic interaction, which\r\nwe postulated to explain the experimental results, together with\r\nthe normal workings of pre-formed associations in N\u2019s mind.\r\n(6) Telepathic Discursive Cognition\r\n1 It is doubtful whether all well-attested cases of spontaneous tele-\r\n! pathy can be dealt with on these lines. And it is fairly certain that\r\nthis cannot be a right explanation of the supernormal knowledge\r\nwhich mediums often display with regard to facts known only to\r\nthe sitter or to some other living person. We may best approach\r\nthe subject in the following way. There are at least two fundamentally different, though intimately connected, kinds of normal cognition, viz., prehensive and discursive. So far we have considered\r\n428 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partonly the possibility of telepathic prehension, and we have found nodirect evidence for it. Now it looks as if the mediuniistic cases, andsome of the spontaneous telepathy cases, might involve telepathicdiscursive cognition. I will now explain these statements and consider whether there is reason to postulate such cognition.\r\nThe distinction between prehensive and discursive cognition is roughly identical with the familiar distinction between \u201c directlyapprehending \u201d and \u201c thinking about.\u201d It is illustrated, e.g., by thedifference between actually hearing a set of noises which form a tuneand knowing or believing that this tune consists of a series of noisesof certain pitches and durations following each other in a certainorder. We may, of course, have discursive cognition about a particular which we are also directly apprehending ; and the ground ofour discursive cognition about it may be what is manifested to usin our prehension of it. But we can have discursive cognition aboutobjects which we are not at the time prehending, aboxit objectswhich we never have prehended, and about objects which we nevercould prehend. We can also have an experience which woidd properly be described as \u201c thinking of an x,\u201d e.g., a dragon, or \u201c thinking of the y,\u201d e.g., the King of the Fairies, although there may be nothing answering to the description \u201can x \u201d or the description \u201c they.\u201d But it would be impossible to have an experience which wouldproperly be described as \u201c directly apprehending an x \u201d or \u201c directlya])prehending the y\r\n\u201d unless there were something answering to thedescription \u201c an x \u201d or to the description \u201c the y,\u201d respectively.\r\nDiscursive cognition consists in either hnowing a fact or taking upone of a number of alternative cognitive attitudes towards a proposition which may be either true or false. Among these cognitive atti- tudes are included believing, disbelieving, opining, uncriticallyaccepting, supposing, and probably many others. All such cognitive attitudes towards a proposition equally presiippose a more fundamental cognitive experience which may be called \u201c entertaining \u201dthe proposition. One and the same person may entertain the sameproposition on many different occasions, and he may take towardsit the same or different cognitive attitudes on different occasions.At one time he may doubt it, at another he may believe it, and so on.Again, several ])eople may entertain one and the same propositionon the same occasion, and they may take various cognitive attitudestowards it. Smith and Jones may both believe it, whilst Browndoubts it and Robinson disbelieves it. (In saying these things I donot mean to imply that there is a ])eculiar class of entities called\u201c propositions.\u201d I thiidv it most likely that all the statements whichI have just been making could be restated without introducing theword \u201cproposition\u201d or any synonym for it. But the translations\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 429\r\nwould be extremely complicated and verbose. Tbe use of the word\r\n\u201c proposition \u201d enables me to express in a reasonably simple verbal\r\nform what everyone admits to be facts about discursive cognition.\r\nNo further excuse is needed for continuing to use it.) There is one other general fact of very great importance which we\r\nmust mention before we can profitably consider telepathic discursive\r\ncognition. At any moment far the greater part of any man\u2019s\r\n\u201c knowledge \u201d or \u201c beliefs \u201d or \u201c opmions \u201d certainly does not take\r\nthe form of experiences of knowmg such and such facts or believing\r\nor opining such and such propositions. The truth about him is that\r\nhe would have these experiences if he chose to direct his attention in a certain way, or if he were to be suitably stimulated. We may\r\nexpress this by saying that, at every moment of our lives, much\r\nthe greater part of our knowledge, beliefs, and opinions consists of\r\nrelatively permanent dispositions to know certain facts or to believe\r\nor opine certain propositions. It is always assumed that, to every\r\nsuch relatively permanent cognitive disposition, there must corre- spond some relatively permanent actual existent. This is generally\r\nsupposed to be some actual modification of the structure of our minds or our brains, or to be some actual persistent unobservable\r\nprocess in our minds or our brams.\r\nIt is as well to recognise that we know nothing at all about the\r\nintrinsic nature of the actual existents which are supposed to corre- spond to our cognitive dispositions. We do not kiiow whether they\r\nare persistent structural features or persistent Tinobservable processes. And we do not know whether they are modifications of our minds or our brains or of both or of neither. All that we know of\r\nthem is that they are produced and modified by our actual experiences, and that they are important factors in producing and modifying our experiences. There is very good reason to believe that the\r\nactual existents which correspond to the various dispositions of\r\nvarious kinds of nmiter are special peculiarities in the spatial arrangement and the motions of the ultra-microscopic particles of which\r\nbodies are composed. But, unless we assume that the actual existents\r\nwhich correspond to mental dispositions are themselves purely material, we cannot suppose that they are spatial arrangements or modes of\r\nmotion of ultra-microscopic particles. Now it is extremely difficult\r\nto form any positive conception of purely mental structures or of nonintrospectible mental processes which could plausibly be supposed\r\nto correspond to our mental dispositions. So we are between the\r\nhorns of the following dilemma. If we put the correlates of all mental dispositions into the bram, we get a theory which is famihar\r\nand intelligible m outline but incredible when we come to consider\r\ndetail. If, on the other hand, we postulate mental structures and\r\n430 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\r\nnon-introspectible mental processes as the actual correlates of our mental dispositions, we have no clear idea of what we are postulating\r\nand we run the risk of paying ourselves with words.\r\nWe are now in readiness to consider telepathic discursive cognition.\r\nSuppose that M knows the fact F or entertains the proposition P.\r\nThe only normal way in which M\u2019s knowledge of F or his entertaining\r\nof P can cause another mind N to think of this fact or to entertain\r\nthis proposition is the following. ]\\1 must express the fact or the\r\npropiosition by uttering or writing a sentence which expresses it in\r\naccordance with some conventional system of symbolisation. Nmust hear or see or in some other way perceive with his senses\r\neither this spoken or vnitten sentence itself or some reproduction\r\nof it, e.g., on a gramophone-record or in a book. Of course profound\r\nphysical transformations may take ])lace during the process which\r\nintervenes between M\u2019s utterance and the occurrence of the reproduction of it which N perceives ; but a fundamental identity of\r\nstructure must l)e preserved throughout, though it may be realised\r\nin verv different media at different stages. This is well illustrated\r\nby telephonic or wireless transmission of speech. Next, the sentence\r\nwhich N eventually perceives must mean for him, in accordance\r\nwith some system of conventional symbolisation with which he is familiar, the same fact or proposition which M expressed by his\r\noriginal sentence. If N perceives M\u2019s sentence itself, it is essential\r\nthat he should lie familiar with the system of symbolic conventions\r\nwhich M uses. If N perceives only a reproduction of M\u2019s original\r\nsentence, this condition need not be fulfilled, but another will have\r\nto be substituted for it. M might express himself in French ; andN, who knows no French, might still l)e caused to entertain the proposition which M was entertaining provided that N perceives a\r\nsentence which is an English translation of M\u2019s sentence. But, in\r\nthat case, it is essential that there should have been a third person\r\nT, familiar with both M\u2019s and N\u2019s systems of conventional symbolisation, who made a translation from one set of symbols to the other.\r\nThe following remarks are worth making at this stage, (i) M\u2019s\r\nknowledge of F or his entertainment of P may be an essential factor\r\nhi causing N to think of F or to entertain P ; and yet N may have\r\nno knowledge or thought of M or of M\u2019s cognitions. If N perceives\r\nand understands a sentence, and if he cares to reflect on the matter,\r\nhe will indeed recognise that some mind or other must have entertained the proposition which this sentence means and must have\r\nexpressed it in a sentence. And he will recognise that this event in\r\nanother mind must be a causal ancestor of his own entertainment\r\nof this proposition. But N need not know or believe anything moredefinite about this other mind, (ii) Suppose that N perceives and\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 431\r\nunderstands a certain sentence, and also knows that it was uttered\r\nby M or is a reproduction of one of M\u2019s utterances. N will then know,\r\nor have very strong reason to believe, that the proposition which\r\nhe has been led to entertain has also been entertained by M. But\r\nhe may know nothing about M\u2019s cognitive attitude towards this\r\nproposition. If N has any beliefs on this subject, they may well be\r\nmistaken ; as is abundantly proved by the occurrence of successful\r\nlies and political propaganda, which are taken by the duped hearer\r\nto express the knowledge or the beliefs of the lying speaker.\r\nIt is now easy to dehne the phrase \u201c Telepathically Induced\r\nDiscursive Cognition.\u201d Suppose that a certain mind N thinks of a\r\nfact F or entertains a proposition P at a certain moment. Suppose\r\nthat N would not have done this unless a certain other contemporary\r\nmind M were knowing this fact or entertaining this proposition.\r\nLastly, suppose that M\u2019s knowledge of F or his entertainmg of P\r\ndoes not bring about N\u2019s thought of F or his entertainment of P\r\nby the normal process which we have just described Either M\r\nnever expresses the fact or the proposition in a sentence, or N never\r\nperceives the sentence or any reproduction of it, or N cannot understand the sentence or the reproduction of it which he perceives. If\r\nthese conditions, positive and negative, were fulfilled, we should\r\nsay that N was having telepathically induced discursive cognition\r\nof this fact or this proposition. And we should say that he was deriving this cognition telepathically from M\u2019s mind. Now it looks\r\nas if telepathically induced discursive cognition, m the sense just\r\ndefined, were involved in some cases of spontaneous telepathy between normal people and in many cases of trance-mediumship. Can\r\nwe say anything further about it ?\r\n(i) I suspect that some people have at the back of their minds a\r\ncertain tacit assumption about the modus operandi of telepathically\r\ninduced discursive cognition. It may be stated as follows. Suppose\r\nthat N is cognismg a fact or a proposition, and that this cognition of\r\nN\u2019s is derived telepathically from M\u2019s mind. Then, it is assumed,\r\nN must be telepathically j^rehending M\u2019s cognition of this fact or proposition. And in so doing, it is further assumed, N will ipso facto\r\nbe himself cognismg the fact or ^proposition which M is cogmsmg.\r\nTo sum up the theory in a sentence : \u201c N\u2019s telepathically induced\r\ncognition of what M discursively cognises depends upon N\u2019s telepathic prehension of M\u2019s experience of cognising.\u201d\r\nI should very much hesitate to accept this theory. In the first place, we have so far foimd no reason to admit the occurrence of\r\nprehensive cognition by one mmd of exjperiences belonging to another\r\nmind. Secondly, I would question the assumption that, if N\r\ndirectly apprehended M\u2019s experience of knowing the fact F or\r\n432 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partcognising the proposition P, he would ipso facto be himself cognisingF or P. It is, no doubt, true that a person could not directly apprehend his own experience of knowing a fact F or cognising a proposition P unless he were knowing F or cognising P. For, unless hewere knowing F or cognising P, there would be nothing answeringto the descri]hion \u201c his experience of knowing F or cognising P.\u201dAnd, unless there were an experience answering to this description,he could not directly apprehend such an experience. But this argument will not lead to the desired conclusion if we apply it to N\u2019sprehension of M\u2019s cognitive ex])eriences. The only conclusion towhich it leads in this case is quite trivial. The conclusion is merelythat, if N directly apprehends M\u2019s experience of knowing F orcognising P, then M must be knowing F or cognising P. The desiredconclusion is that N must be thinking of F or entertaining P. Andthis certainly does not follow.\r\nNow, if the fallacy which I have just indicated is avoided, thereseems to be no reason to accept the assumption under discussion.\r\nWhy should not N directly apprehend an event, which is in factM\u2019s experience of knowing F or cognising P, wdthout realising thatthe event which he is apprehending answers to this description ? And, if this is possible, why should N ipso facto think of F or entertain P ? It might be plausible to maintain that N could not directly apprehend an experience of M\u2019s without ipso facto being aware of its psychological quality, e.g., without apprehending it as an experienceof knowing or as one of believing or as one of doubting, as the case might be. But it is not plausible to maintain that N could notdirectly apprehend an experience of M\u2019s without ipso facto beingaware of its epistemological object, i.e., of the fact of which it is aknowing or of the proposition of which it is a believing or a doubting.\r\nYet, when telepathy takes place from M to N, the result is usually\r\nthat N cognises a fact or proposition which M is cognising, butremains unaware of the psychological quality of M\u2019s cognitive\r\nexperience. So there seems to be very little to be said in favour of\r\nthe theory which we have been discussing.\r\nBefore we leave this theory there is one more remark to be madeabout it. If it were acceptable on other grounds, it could be applied\r\nto explain the apparently telepathic prehension by N of images\r\nwhich M is imaging or of sensa which M is sensing. The explanation\r\nwould, of course, take the following form. N, it would be said, tele- pathically prebends M\u2019s experience of imaging the image I or sensing the sensum S. In doing this, it would be assumed, Nipso facto prebends the image I or the sensum S which is the object\r\nof M\u2019s experience. The general principle assumed is that, in pre-\r\n142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 433\r\nhending any experience which is itself a prehension of an object, one w\u2019ould be ipso facto prehending its object. I see no reason to\r\naccept this principle ; and I have already tried to show that the\r\nresults of experimental telepathy can be interpreted in quite a\r\ndifferent way, which involves telepathic interaction but does not\r\ninvolve telepathic cognition.\r\n(ii) I think that certain cases of telepathically induced discursive\r\ncognition could be explained on the same lines as the simple cases of\r\nexperimental telepathy. Suppose that M knows the fact F or\r\ncognises the proposition P. Although he does not utter or w'rite a\r\nsentence which would express F or P in his own language, he may\r\nimage a series of auditory or visual images corresponding to such\r\na sentence. Certainly when I am thinking I often find myself doing\r\nthis. Suppose now that a series of visual or auditory images, similar\r\nto these, were produced by telepathic interaction and imaged by\r\nanother mind N. If N knew\u2019 the language in which these imagesentences are composed, he would automatically entertain the proposition or think of the fact which they express in that language.\r\nHe w\u2019ould thus have been telepathically induced to entertain the\r\nproposition which M is cognising or to think of the fact which M is knowing.\r\nIt must be noticed that this theory presupposes that N know\u2019s the\r\nlanguage in which M would express himself if he were to speak\r\nor to write. It therefore could not explain how an Englishman could\r\ntelepathically induce in a Frenchman, who knew no English, a\r\ncognition of a fact w\u2019hich the Englishman knows or a proposition\r\nwhich he cognises. I do not know whether there is good evidence of\r\ntelepathically induced discursive cognition in such cases. It would\r\nbe a very important subject for experimental investigation.\r\n(iii) Even if the explanation just proposed should be true of some\r\ncases of telepathically induced discursive cognition, I do not thuik\r\nthat it could possibly cover all or most of them. In most cases it seems certain that the person from whom the cognition was tele- pathically derived was not thinking at the time of the fact or proposition concerned. And, if he was not thinkhig of it, he w\u2019as a\r\nfortiori not imaging a set of spoken or written words which would\r\nexpress it in his ow\u2019ii language. When N derives telepathically from\r\n]\\I a cognition of a fact w\u2019hich i\\I knows or a proposition which M\r\nbelieves, it is not usually the case that M is actually having an\r\nexperience of knowing the fact or believing the proposition. Usually\r\nIM\u2019s knowledge or belief is at the time purely dispositional, as most\r\nof our knowdedge and our beliefs are at every moment. It is possible,\r\nof course, to evade this contention by saying that M must have been\r\n\u201c unconsciously having an actual experience of know\u2019ing the fact\r\n434 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. PARTor of believing the proposition at the time when the cognition is telepathically induced in N. This, however, would be a whollygratuitous assumption, for which there is no independent evidence,and I shall ignore it. The position, then, seems to be this. Suppose that N telepathically derives from M a cognition of a fact F, which M knows, or of aproposition P, which M believes. Then the operative factor on M\u2019sside will not as a nde be any actual cognitive experience which Mis having at the time. The operative factor on M\u2019s side will usuallybe what we may call his \u201c potentiality of knowing F \u201d or his \u201c potentiality of believing P.\u201d By M\u2019s \u201c potentiality of knowing F \u201d I mean that persistent modification of structure or process, whateverit may be, which ensures that, whenever M is suitably stimulated bya reminder, he will have an actual experience of knowing F. ByM\u2019s \u201c potentiality of believing P \u201d I mean that persistent modification of structure or process, whatever it may be, which ensures that,\r\nwhenever M is suitably stimulated by a reminder, he 'ftfill have anactual experience of believing P. I have already said that wn knownothing whatever about the intrinsic nature or location of these\r\nassumed persistent modifications. We know them only as relatively\r\npermanent after-effects of actual experiences, and as relatively\r\npermanent cause-factors in producing and modifying subsequent\r\nexperiences. Let us call them \u201c Experientially Initiated Potentialities of Experience.\u201d\r\nNow the normal rule is this. Any such potentiality which is a\r\ncause-factor in producing or modifying M\u2019s later experiences has been\r\nacquired from 31\u2019s earlier experiences. I wish to point out that this\r\nis merely an empirical ride based on normal experience. Since weknow nothing about the intrinsic nature or location of experientially\r\ninitiated potentialities of experience, we cannot possibly see any kind\r\nof necessity in this or any other rule about them. It is logically\r\npossible that a potentiality which is an after-effect of M\u2019s past\r\nexperiences should be a cause-factor in producing or modifying, not\r\nonly M\u2019s future exjieriences, but also those of N. Many cases of\r\ntelepathically induced discursive cognition seem to suggest that this\r\nlogical jjossilulity is in fact sometimes realised.\r\nLet us begin by considering normal thinking. Here, as we have\r\nsaid, the only experientially initiated potentialities which affect a\r\nperson's later experiences are those which were initiated by his oivn\r\nearlier experiences. In low-grade thinking, such as day-dreaming,\r\nit would seem that some one potentiality is activated by some very\r\ncontingent experience of the thinker, and that this then activates\r\nanother, and this in turn another, and so on, in an almost automatic\r\nway dependent on association by contiguity, similarity, etc. The\r\n142] Normal Cognitio7i, Clairvoyaiice, and Telepathy 435\r\nresult is a series of thoughts or images which have very little logical\r\ninterconnexion ; though the thinker himself, if he reflected on them,\r\nor a psychologist, if he performed a psycho-analysis, might be able\r\nto conjecture why the experiences had followed each other in this\r\nparticular order. If, on the other hand, the person is actively pursuing a directed train of thought on some deflnite problem, those\r\npotentialities which would give rise to experiences relevant to the\r\nproblem will tend to be stimulated and those which would give rise\r\nto experiences irrelevant to the problem will tend to be kept quiet.\r\nEven here the potentiality which would give rise to an experience\r\nhighly relevant at a certain stage m the process often fails to be\r\nactivated at the appropriate moment. And potentialities which\r\ngive rise to irrelevant or misleading experiences often do get activated. Even when a process of thinking, directed to solving a certain\r\nproblem, is eventually successful, the thoughts which are the stages\r\nin this process seldom arise in their proper logical order. The right\r\nlogical order usually comes as a result of retrospective reflexion on\r\nthe process by the thinker, followed by an act of rearrangement.\r\nThe point which I want to emphasise now is the followmg. W hen\r\nnormal directed thinking is contrasted with normal low-grade thinking, it may fairly be called a\r\n\u201c volmitary \u201d process. And it may\r\nfairly be said that the thinker \u201c deliberately selects,\u201d out of the mass\r\nof potentialities of experience w'hich his past experiences have\r\ninitiated, those which would give rise to relevant exjieriences if they were stimulated. But it is most important not to be deceived\r\nby such phrases. W e must not imagine that the thinker pierceives the\r\nvarious potentialities of experience, as a man might perceive a lot of\r\nties and socks and shoes and pullovers in his bedroom, and then deliberately activates a certam selection fro7n them, as a man might deliberately put on a certain tie, a certain pair of socks, a certain pair of\r\nshoes, and a certain pullover, in order to produce a certain colour\r\nscheme. The following analog may make the fallacy quite plain.\r\nWhen the process of constructing a machine wdth one s hands is contrasted with bluiking or jerking one\u2019s knee, it may fairly be called a\r\n\u201c volimtary \u201d process. And it may fairly be said that the agent\r\n\u201c deliberately selects,\u201d out of a mass of potentialities of movement\r\nderived from his past bodily actions, those which would give rise\r\nto the relevant overt movements if stimulated. But he certainly\r\ndoes not perceive his own motor-nerves and muscles, select certain\r\nof the former, and decide to send such and such nervous impulses\r\ndown the former in order to activate the latter in such a way as to\r\nmake his Angers move as he wants them to do. He is perceiving\r\nand thinkmg of nothing but his hands and the materials with which\r\nhe is working. He is desiring nothing but to make certain compli-\r\n436 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part:\r\ncated movements with his hands against the resistance of the materials. This autoniutically\r\n,\r\nand m ways utterly unknown to him,| sets up unfelt processes in unperceived nerves. And, in the main,these are in fact the appropriate processes in the appropriate nerves ; since, in the main, the expected and desired overt movements result.To imagine that a thinker literally selects and deliberately activatesthose potentialities of experience which are relevant to the problemthat he is trying to solve is like imagining that a manual workerliterally contemplates his own brain and nervous system as if it were a complicated switch-board and deliberately presses such andsuch buttons. The thinker or the manual worker wills that a certainprocess of thought or bodily action shall take place ; and automatically, in ways unknown to him, his volition initiates and sustains, among unobservable entities, unobservable processes whichdo ill fact tend to bring about the desired process of thought orbodily action.\r\nI have insisted upon this point about normal thinking because it has an important bearing upon telepathically induced thinking. Itseems to me that there are two ways in which we are liable to makeneedless difficulties for ourselves in connexion with this subject.(i) W e tacitly assume that potentialities of experience initiated byM\u2019s experiences must be located in M\u2019s brain or in M\u2019s mind ; andsimilaily, mutatis mutandis, for A and for each other individual.(ii) M e tacitly assume that, wffieii a certain set of co-existent potentialities of experience are activated in such an order as to give rise\r\nto a certain coherent train of thought in M s mind, M must have con-templated a whole mass of co-existent potentialities and must havedeliberately selected and activated this particular sub-group. Thenwe are faced with telepathically intluced discursive cognition. Wethereupon raise such rpiestions as these. How can N contemplate potentialities of experience which are located in M\u2019s brain or in M\u2019smind ? How can N select from these just that sub-group which is relevant to his own problem at the moment ? How can N activatethis sub-group located in M\u2019s mind or brain ? And, if N does this,\r\nwhy are the corresponding exjieriences produced in N\u2019s mind andnot in M\u2019s ? Now these difficulties are at least lightened by the two followingconsiderations, (i) Even it the potentialities of exjierience which areinitiateil by M\u2019s experiences are located in M\u2019s mind or M\u2019s brain,there is not the least reason to suppose that N would have to con-template them and deliberately activate a certain selection of them.For we have seen that this is certainly not the way in wffiich the set of potentialities which are relevant to a normal train of thought areactivated by the mind in which that train of thought occurs.\r\n142] Norynal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 437\r\n(ii) We have very little ground for assuming that the potentialities\r\nof exjjerience which are initiated by Ws experiences are located in\r\nM\u2019s mind or in M\u2019s brain. If I say that an actual experience is located in M\u2019s mind, I know what I mean. I mean that it is one of\r\nM\u2019s experiences, and I know perfectly well what it is for a certain\r\nexperience to belong to, or occur in, a certain mind. But experientially initiated potentialities of experience, whatever they may be, are certainly not themselves experiences. MTien I say that a certain\r\nacquired potentiality of experience is located in M\u2019s mind this can\r\nonly be an abbreviated way of sapng that it was produced by a past\r\nexperience of M's and that it is a cause-factor in producing or modifying later experiences of M\u2019s. If the statement means anything more than this, I have no idea what it means. If, on the\r\nother hand, I say that it is located in M's brain, I must mean that it\r\nis a more or less persistent modification in the spatial arrangement\r\nor the movements of the ultra-microscopic particles in some part of\r\nM\u2019s brain. Xow there are well-kno^\\m empirical facts about the\r\nloss of a person\u2019s normal memories through injuries to his brain and\r\nhis subsequent recovery of these memories which make it very\r\ndifficult to accept this view of experientially initiated potentialities of\r\nexperience. So the statement that potentialities of experience in- itiated by M\u2019s experiences are located in M\u2019s mind seems to be either\r\nmetaphorical or meaningless ; and the statement that they are located in his brain, if taken as the whole truth, seems to be difficult\r\nto reconcile with admitted facts about the effects of brain-injuries on normal experience.\r\nWe must therefore consider seriously the possibility that each\r\nperson\u2019s experiences initiate more or less permanent modifications\r\nof structure or process in something which is neither his mind nor his\r\nbrain. There is no reason to suppose that this Substratum would\r\nbe ami:hing to which possessive adjectives, such as \u201c mine \u201d and\r\n\u201c yours \u201d and his \u201d could properly be applied, as they can be to\r\nminds and to animated bodies. The situation would be this. The\r\nmodifications which are produced in this common Substratum by\r\nM\u2019s experiences normally affect only the subsequent experiences of\r\nM ; those which are produced in it by X's experiences normally\r\naffect only the subsequent experiences of X. But in certain cases\r\nthis normal camsal \u201d self-confinement,\u201d as we might call it, breaks\r\ndown. l\\lodifications which have been produced in the Substratum by\r\ncertain of M\u2019s past experiences are activated by X's present experi- ences or interests, and they become cause-factors in producing or modifying X\u2019s later experiences.\r\nAs we know nothing about the intrinsic nature of experientially\r\ninitiated potentialities of experience, we cannot say an}d;hing definite\r\n438 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part 142]about the intrinsic nature of the common Substratum of which wehave assumed them to be modifications. As there is no reason whatever to think that such potentialities of experience are, or could be,themselves experiences, there is no reason whatever to supposethat the Substratum is a mind. On the other hand, it could hardlybe any particular finite body. It does not seem impossible that it should be some kmd of extended pervasive medium, capable ofreceiving and retaining modifications of local structure or internalmotion. But I do not thinlv that we have at present any adequatedata for further speculations about its nature.\r\nPROCEEDINGS\r\nOF THE\r\nSociety for Psychical Research\r\nPART 143\r\nA PROXY CASE EXTENDING OVER ELEVEN SITTINGS\r\nWITH MRS OSBORNE LEONARD\r\nBy C. Drayton Thoma,s\r\nFOREWORD\r\nThe following letter by Mr H. Hatch vouches for the accuracy of\r\nstatements made in this narrative.\r\nThornton House,\r\n58 Hibson Road,\r\nNelson, Lancs. March 11, 1935.\r\nPerhaps some matters in this book will be clearer if I explain my\r\nconnexion with Bobbie. I am his mother\u2019s stepfather, but he lived in my home all his short life. His own father only knew him when a baby\r\nand I looked upon Bobbie as my son, and he thought of me as his father.\r\nI ought to say also that I have no connexion with Spiritualism, that\r\nI have taken an Honours degree in Science, and that I have spent most\r\nof my life in teaching science and in writing text-books.\r\nI am perfectly certain that the evidence proves that knowledge of\r\nfacts and places was obtained in some abnormal way\u2014how, it is for\r\npsychic researchers to say.\r\nFraud is quite out of the question. As explained in the book, none\r\nof the facts, places or people were known to either the sitter or the\r\nmedium. I was most careful in my letters to make no statements other\r\nthan comments on evidence already given.\r\nChance coincidence is an equally absurd theory. Consider some of\r\nthe names given. \u201c Bentley \u201d (96) was given as a place name\u2014a clue to the \u201c pipes \u201d ; actually Bentley Street is one minute\u2019s walk from my\r\nhome in that direction. \u201c Catelnow \u201d (140) is given as a place near by ; actually Catlow is a hamlet some two miles away to which Bobbie and\r\nI walked on the last occasion he left the house before his death. Are not\r\n2g 439\r\n440 C. Drayton Thomas [partthe chances against correct guessing in each case thousands to one, andtherefore millions to one in combination ?\r\nI would direct particular attention to the statements about the photograph of Bobbie with \u201c a board in front \u201d and \u201c a round thing withouta peak \u201d on his head (34 and 35). The chances against correct guessinghere seem to me to be so high as to make the theory absurd.\r\nTelepathy can only be an explanation if by that vague term one heremeans the power of the medium to read the subconscious thoughts of]ieople (1) whom she did not know, (2) of whose locality in Britain shehad no idea, (3) who did not know when the sittings were in progress,(4) who were actually over 200 miles distant. I suggest that this hypothesis is too far-fetched.\r\nI wish to say that all the statements of fact made by Mr DraytonThomas are absolutely true. I shall be glad to answer any questionsrelating to them.\r\n(Signed) Herbert Hatch.\r\n143] ^4 Proxy Case 441\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nIn the Proceedings of our Society for May 1933 there is an account\r\nof some proxy sittings with Mrs Osborne Leonard which I took on\r\nbehalf of various applicants. Two or three sittings were given to\r\nmost of these cases, but in the experiment now to be described there were eleven sittings and the series extended over many months.\r\nThe longer opportunity for accumulation of material may in some\r\nmeasure account for its better quality. It is possible that, had I given more sittings to each of the cases above mentioned, the results\r\nwould have been better.\r\nAlthough the present case concerns a young boy it was said that\r\nhe was helped by others : it may have been owing to their ex])crience\r\nand suggestion that the child was able to select so much appropriate\r\nmaterial. The subject of chief interest in this study was not originated by the boy, but by my regular communicators. The ojiinion\r\nexpressed by them as to the cause of the boy\u2019s death is highly important ; firstly because it had been suspected by no one on earth,\r\nand secondly because we were unable, for several months after the\r\nclues were given, to trace any connexion between the boy\u2019s illness\r\nand its asserted origin.\r\nThis therefore merits special consideration and will form the\r\nsubject matter of Part II, for which all relevant material is reserved.\r\nI shall, however, indicate in Part I the place in each sitting where\r\nreference was made to this topic.\r\nThe first sitting introduces the baffling subject of psychometry.\r\nIt is rarely that I have tried this with Mrs Leonard, but I haj)pened\r\nto do so on this occasion. The psychometrising was of doubtful\r\nassistance ; for although Feda (Mrs Leonard\u2019s Control) seemed to\r\nbegin with pure psychometry this quickly changed into the familiar\r\ntype of message. Feda meanwhile was apparently uncertain\r\nwhether the information came to her by means of the article, or\r\ndirect from some imseen communicator.\r\nThe series affords illustration of problems connected with trance\r\nmediumship which still await final solution. Prominent among\r\nthese is the question of wodws operandi and the fact that information\r\nwhich one could express in a few sentences will often emerge in\r\ndiffused and extended form. Whether the cause is to be sought in\r\ntelepathy, imjjerfect clairaudience, the medium\u2019s inhibitions, or the\r\ncommunicator\u2019s difficulty with memory\u2014or various combinations\r\nof these\u2014one would much like to ascertain. It is my ho].>e that the\r\nmaterial here provided may be useful to those studying such\r\nquestions, and may directly or indirectly help toward a solution.\r\n442 C. Drayton Thomas [partI am grateful to Mr Hatch and Mrs Newlove for allowing me togive their names and postal address. This will enable anyonewishing to make further enquiries to go to headquarters, and it disposes of the objection which might otherwise arise that the wholeof this story would seem to depend upon my unsupported word. Ithappened that Mr Besterman and Mr Gerald Heard were presentat Sitting No. 6, and heard Feda give the remarkably correctdescription of a route which would lead towards the locality wherethe mysterious \u201c pipes \u201d were said to be.\r\nPart I consists of a slightly abbreviated record of the twelvesittings, with verifications and an analysis of results.\r\nPart II gives a complete story of the \u201c pipes \u201d problem.\r\nPart HI is a numerical analysis of successes and failures.\r\nPart IV is an inquiry into Telepathy and the modus operandi oftrance messages.\r\nFeda is the name of Mrs Leonard\u2019s Control.\r\nJohn my father, and Etta my sister are my regular communicators.\r\nC. D. T. are my initials and will indicate my part in dialogue withFeda.\r\nReaders will be able to place theh own valuation upon the evidential material of these sittings, but in the table appended to eachsitting will be found the mark given by me. The name of the child from whom I was seeking information wasBobbie Newlove ; he will be called Bobbie in these records. Hismessages of affection and all personal matter which has no definitely\r\nevidential value will be omitted, as also his descriptions of the life heis living in the Beyond. We shall confine ourselves strictly to evidence which can be tested.\r\nMuch of the material connects with the boy\u2019s memories, whilesome of it relates to his opinions, or to things he was said to haveobserved since his passing. These items I distinguish by M. formemories, and by 0. for opinions or observations. Feda, John andEtta occasionally offered opinions.\r\n.4 Proxy Case 443\r\nPART I\r\nBOBBIE NEAVLOVE\r\nIx September 1932 I received a letter from a stranger, a l\\Ir Hatch.\r\nHe wrote from Nelson, a town 200 miles distant, of which I had no\r\nknowledge other than the fragmentary memories of having once\r\nlectured there ten years before.\r\nHere are relevant portions of the letter.\r\nFor ten years my stepdaughter has lived with me and my wife, and\r\nher little boy has been the life and centre of our lives. He was particularly intelligent and extraordinarily loving and lovable. A few weeks\r\nago he died suddenly of diphtheria, aged ten. The loss is so dreadful that\r\nwe feel we must ask if you can in any way obtain comfort similar to that\r\nrecounted in your book. Life Beyond Death.\r\nI discouraged expectation of receiving messages ; it seemed to me\r\nthat this boy would be too young to make a successful communicator. Meanwhile the family remained unaware, until receiving\r\nextracts from the first sitting, that I was attempting (by methods\r\npreviously successful in similar cases) to make contact with the child.\r\nIt was in these circumstances that I took the letter to my sitting of\r\nNovember 4, 1932.\r\nAt an appropriate moment during the sitting I said to Feda, \u201c I have a very earnest request for news of a little boy, Bobbie Truelove \u201d. (By a slip of memory I gave the surname wrongly, it should\r\nhave been Newlove. It will be noticed that I corrected this at the\r\nbegiiming of the third sitting.) I then suggested that Feda should\r\nhold the letter. She accepted the idea. Needless to say I had folded\r\nit in such a way that no uiforniation could be ascertamed by glancing\r\nat it. Added to this I watched carefully during the few minutes it was in the medium\u2019s hands, and observed that her eyes did not open.\r\nI will now set out Feda\u2019s remarks consecutively, adding the\r\ncomments received from the family.\r\nFirst Sitting, November 4, 1932.\r\n(1) Feda : Isn\u2019t there a name connected with them beginning with\r\na\r\n\u2018 T \u2019 1 When I said that I did not know, Feda added that it was an\r\n\u201c important name \u201d. The family\u2019s comment on this was that Bobbie\r\nloved his mother to call him by a pet name beginning with the\r\nletter \u2018 T \u2019.\r\nIt is mifortunate that in so many cases Feda gives only the initial letter instead of the full name. In the present case there is nothing\r\n444 f\\ iJrai\/to)) Thomas I'PAIIT\r\nto make one sure tliat Bobbie\u2019s pet name was lacing attempted ; ontlie. otlrer hand, an attemj^t to announce this name would be quite\r\nnatural in the circumstances. As we shall shortly see, Feda had theimpression that the child was actually present.\r\n(2) Feda ; Will you find out whether this l)oy had had a pain in his\r\nhand. I felt such a funny pain in the hand while touching this\r\nletter. As the medium was holding the letter I assumed that psychometrywas in progress. If so, then the pain in the hand would presumablyrefer to the writer and not to Bobbie himself. I learned on enquiryhowever, that the writer, Mr Hatch, did not recognise this as applying to himself, but that Bobbie, who had always been a delicate\r\nchild, occasionally lost the use of the right hand after a bout of\r\nexcessive laughter ; at such times he did not complain of pain, buthe was unable to use the hand for writing while the condition lasted.\r\n(3) Feda ; I am also getting a name beginning with \u2018 M \u2019, it sounds\r\nlike Mar\u2014 something, connected with this letter too ... Is there a name in or on this letter starting with \u2018 M \u2019 ? One is left in doubt as to what may have l)een intended by this\r\nreference to Mar\u2014. The first comment I received was as follows ; \u201c Yes, Bobbie\u2019s godmother, whom he loved, I think, more than\r\nanyone outside the family circle, is named Marie.\u201d\r\nThere is, however, no doubt that Bobbie\u2019s thoughts had often\r\nreverted to a child named Marjorie, whom he had frequently metand who had made a great impression on him. There will be several\r\nreferences to this on later pages. Neither this name, nor any other\r\ncommencing with \u2018 M \u2019, was mentioned in the letter I had received.\r\nFeda was not sure of the source of these ideas ; for, in relation to\r\nthis name, she added : \u201c I think I am getting that from the letter, or it may be in the thought of the person who wrote the letter to\r\nyou.\u201d The phrase, \u201c It sounds like Mar\u2014 \u201d, certainly seems to\r\nsuggest clairaudience and not psychometry.\r\n(4) Feda ; The little boy has been trying to get in touch with them\r\nbefore.\r\n[His people wrote : \u201c We have had very vague messages from local mediums.\u201d] ^\r\n(5) Feda : You said a few weeks since he j)assed over, Feda feels it would be several months now.\r\n^ Short comments interspersed between quotations from the record of the\r\nsittings are in square brackets. These comments, unless there is some state- ment to the contrary, are based upon information received from Mr Hatch or Mrs Newlove, either in letters or verbally when I made their acquaintance\r\nduring my visits to Nelson in June and July 1933.\r\n143 ] J Pro.rti Case 44.\")\r\n[1 was iul'omied that the child had died some three months before this\r\nsitting, i.e. on August 12, 1932.]\r\n(6) Feda ; Glands ; ask if he had anything the matter with his glands.\r\nWhen I get anything like that it helps to find out if I am getting\r\nthe right one. [Mr Hatch replied : \u201c I do not know whether the glands are affected\r\nin diphtheria, but it is probable.\u201d\r\nI was equally ignorant, but on referring to books, discovered, as did\r\nMr Hatch, that the glands are affected by diphtheria. So this point,\r\nwhich had been neither in my mind nor in Mr Hatch\u2019s, was correct.]\r\n(7) Feda : All boys are fond of cakes and things, but a little while\r\nbefore he passed over I get such a feeling of a lot of cakes and\r\ncooking going on as if for some special occasion.\r\n[This is vague. The only fact at all relevant is that, at some time\r\nwithin six months of passing, Bobbie and a friend, after having studied\r\na cookery book, had a grand toffee-making.]\r\n(8) Feda : Do you know if he was connected with a town, not London\r\nbut a town, not one of the biggest in the provinces ? [This was, as I knew, correct for Nelson where Bobbie had lived.]\r\n(9) Feda : Is there something to do with a place\u2014does anybody go\r\nthere to do some special study, not like Oxford or Cambridge,\r\nEton or Harrow.\r\nC. D. T. : No, it is a manufacturing town.\r\nFeda : The studying they are doing is not so much of a scholastic\r\nkind. It is more as if they are learning to do something in a\r\npractical way.\r\nC. D. T. ; And who is this that is studying ? Feda : Somebody connected with the boy, like making a study of\r\nhow to make something, like specialising in the making of something, not just making it and turning it out with a machine, but\r\na kind of study of it. [After a short break this subject was continued, see below.]\r\n(10) Feda : It is a busy place, but not one of the very biggest of those\r\ntowns. I don\u2019t think you would call it the biggest of those towns,\r\nand yet it is a largish place where they are concentrating on\r\nimportant things.\r\nC. D. T. : I should say that is correct, so far as I know.\r\n[Mr Hatch wrote : \u201c This is unquestionably an accurate description\r\nof Nelson.\u201d]\r\n(11) Feda : Do you know if some manufacturing places are on the banks\r\nof a canal or river there ? It does not feel pretty enough to call a river because of the buildings and the things on the side of it. [There is a river and a canal, and there are factories on the banks of\r\nthe river. Bobbie knew both river and canal.]\r\nFeda : (Resuming previous theme 9). Oh, are they partly making\r\nsome stuff, there in this place, is it earthenware or pottery, some-\r\n44(5 ('. Drayton IVioma.s [part\r\ni\r\nt hing like stone '! I think they are making more than one tiling\r\nthere, but I do get a feeling of something being made of a hard | nature, something like stone, something is being put together,\r\nI get a feeling of it lieing put together very closely in lumps ; it i\r\nis not steel or iron or metal, it is more like things being made,\r\nand I think it is rather a new industry.\r\n[i\\lr Hatch replied : \u201c Bobbie had a great friend who is a working\r\nman engaged usually in making mortar and cement. He took a great\r\ninterest in the boy and was most distressed when he died. Later he\r\nsuggested that he should make a concrete cross for the grave. Wethankfully agreed, feeling that work with real love behind it was better\r\nthan anything bought from a monumental mason. This friend has never made one before and had to \u2018 make a study of how to make something.\u2019 \u201d]\r\nReaders will feel that this is not convincing. When, however,\r\nafter the conclusion of these sittings, I visited Nelson and met the\r\nperson above alluded to, Mr Burrows, and saw the grave\u2014the cross not yet erected, but blocks of concrete making a curb with a concrete\r\nplatform round the grave, and noticing that the concrete was madein small portions fitted together,\u2014I realised how apposite had been\r\nthe above description. Mr Burrows will be mentioned hereafter.\r\nBobbie greatly admired him ; for, in addition to teaching Bobbie\r\ngymnastics and boxing, Mr Burrows was the professional at the\r\nskating rink, and Captain of the Rink Hockey Club.\r\nIt is only my fear that readers will not be in a position, at this\r\npoint, to share my opinion that Feda\u2019s remarks actually apply to\r\nthe concrete-and-cement work around Bobbie\u2019s grave, that restrains\r\nme from pointing out in detail how clear it is that Feda did not knowwhat it was she was describing. But it is unwise to build uponinadequate foundations, and there wdll be other opportunities, as we])roceed, for illustrating this fact, namely, that the mind originating\r\nthe message is not Feda\u2019s and that Feda is frequently unable to\r\nrealise what it is that she is describing. There is abundant evidence\r\nindicating that Feda\u2019s part is simply to transmit from one who knowsthe facts, and w'ho is trying amid difficulties to convey information\r\nwhich can be recognised by those for whom it is intended.\r\n(12) Feda : These people are not very poor and not very rich, sort of\r\nbetween people ; I think they have a comfortable home and nice\r\nsurroundings\u2014the family of the boy.\r\n[This remark was accepted by Mr Hatch as a correct description.]\r\n(13) Feda : Ask them if the boy\u2019s neck or throat was affected. I keep on getting something about that.\r\n[The diphtheria affected the boy\u2019s neck and throat, but he hadpreviously been troubled with enlarged tonsils which would have lieen operated upon had Bobbie been less delicate.]\r\n143 ] 447\r\nMr Hatch\u2019s reaction to this first sittmg may be judged from the\r\nfollowing passages which I extract from his letter of comments.\r\n\u201c There certainly seems more in the above than coincidence would\r\nexplain. Yet do you not think that psychometry, while showing that the\r\nmind of the medium has certain unknown powers, is yet no evidence of\r\nsurvival ? If Bobbie were trying to communicate I cannot believe that\r\nhe would refer to any of the matters mentioned. Still, as you say, it is a foundation, and if you will be good enough to try again we shall indeed\r\nbe grateful. \u201c I have heard it said that those who are desperately anxious for\r\nevidence are very credulous. I do not think it is so with me. My fear\r\nis lest I should be deceived by evidence that can be explained by some\r\nother faculty of the mind, perhaps one that has not been investigated\r\nas yet.\u201d\r\nFirst Sitting.\r\nAbbreviations used.\r\nM ; Memory.\r\n0 : Opinion or Observation.\r\nE, ; Eight.\r\nG : Good.\r\nF ; Fair.\r\nP : Poor.\r\nD : Doubtful.\r\nClassed as\r\n\r\n0 : F.

[Mr Hatch says that Bobby had not a good constitution but was;always frail.]\r\n(16) Feda : He seemed rather a lively boy and he was not what Etta\r\njwould call a naughty boy in temperament, he was a boy who waswhat you would call \u201c all there \u201d. He had a very nice nature,\r\nand though he was quite a boy he could be, and was, very affectionate too ; she says, I think his mother would say \u201c yes \u201d\r\nto that. Many boys are so undemonstrative, but this boy wouldjbe very affectionate. ji[It should be noted that it is Etta who says, \u201c I think that he had a jgood constitution as children go.\u201d This seems to have been an inference 'of hers and therefore the mistake is less important than would have been\r\na misstatement made by Bobbie himself. The rest of the paragraph is correct. Bobbie was very lively, very good, and particularly affectionate.] i(17) Feda : He was very appreciative of his mother and his relations |and his home life. [Mr Hatch writes ; \u201c This is all true.\u201d]\r\n(18) Feda : There was a little girl that this boy was very fond of.\r\n(19) Does the girl\u2019s name begin with \u2018 J \u2019 ? I keep seeing a\r\n\u2018 J \u2019.\r\nJ.

One is a proper name and the other is a little made-up name, a pet name.[\u201c A little girl he was fond of \u201d : Yes, Marjorie, a child of twelve whowas a semi-professional at the skating rink. There will be several\r\nfurther allusions to her, usually by the letter \u2018 M \u2019. Feda here seems to have assumed that because the letter \u2018 J\r\n\u2019 cameafter the reference to a girl it was therefore the girl\u2019s name ; andsimilarly with the name \u2018 G \u2019. The initials are all quite relevant, however.\r\n\u2018 J\r\n\u2019 and \u2018 P \u2019\r\n: Jack and Peter were two of Bobbie\u2019s special friends.\r\nThe two names \u2018 G \u2019 may refer to his mother, whose name is Gwendoline,\r\nbut often called in the family Gennie.]\r\nI4:i] ,4 Proxy Case 441)\r\n(21) Feda : There is a rather elderly gentleman he is very iVmd of. Etta\r\nthinks it is someone he regarded as a relation, I am sure too old\r\nto be the father.\r\n[Mr Hatch says that this may refer to himself. Mr Hatch is older than\r\nBobbie\u2019s father and is step-father to Bobbie\u2019s mother.]\r\n(22) Feda : I understand he had given him something the boy was very\r\npleased about only shortly before he passed over. [Mr Hatch frequently gave things to Bobbie, but remembers nothing\r\nto which this would specially aqiply.]\r\n(23) Feda : Had this gentleman taken out something in the boy\u2019s name\r\nthat would be of monetary advantage to him later on, putting\r\nsomething on one side for him that would have been useful to him later. [Not understood. They gave Bobbie money for his Savings Certificate at school, but cannot think of anything further to which this would\r\napply.]\r\n(24) Feda : There was something that Bobbie was very interested in,\r\nbut I don\u2019t quite understand. He had been allowed to build\r\nsomething. I think he was not doing it alone, he was going to do\r\nit with another young person ; it seems as if he was going to build something. It felt to me like building an outhouse, but he\r\nseemed too young for such an interest. There was something of\r\nthat kind being done in which he was very interested and going\r\nto take his part. It is one of the things he would have wanted\r\nto talk about if he had been on the earth.\r\n[With a boy friend, Bobbie had planned to build a glider\u2014an impracticable scheme, but one upon which, for a time, he had worked with\r\nmuch enthusiasm. His mother allowed the boys to do this in the\r\nscullery. Note : Etta says, \u201c It felt to me like building an outhouse,\r\nsomething of that kind \u201d. Did she confuse the scullery with the object\r\nunder construction there ?]\r\n(25) Feda ; He was fond of someone who was attached to a school.\r\n[This might refer either to one of Bobbie\u2019s teachers, or to Mr Hatch,\r\nto whom he was much attached ; Mr Hatch teaches in a school.]\r\n(26) Feda : And he sent his love to someone whose initial was \u2018 M \u2019,\r\nI don\u2019t mean his mother. It is a woman, that is to say, it is a female name.\r\n[This is highly appropriate for his godmother, of whom he was very\r\nfond and with whom he had stayed in London. She was always alluded\r\nto as \u201c Auntie Marie \u201d. Alternatively, it might mean the little girl\r\nMarjorie, above mentioned, to whom Bobbie was much attached.]\r\n(27) Feda : Someone called Joyce he liked. [Two years back Bobbie had known a Joyce, but the family do not\r\nthink it likely he would name her in this connection. There were others\r\n4r)(j C. J)r(ii\/lo)i Thovuifi (partof that name whom he knew' at his co-education school, also others\r\namong the Brownies ^ with whom he was acquainted.]\r\n(28) Feda : He was very pleased at winning something not very long\r\nbefore he passed over. [Not long before he died Bobbie was pleased at being top of his formfor the half-year\u2019s examination, as well as for the term\u2019s marks.\r\nNine weeks before his death Bobbie won, in a competition, a salt- sifter shaped like a dog. This article gave him much pleasure. Hecalled it his \u201c bow-wow \u201d. (See Fig. II.) It will be referred to later : see Nos. 54, 56, 61.]\r\n(29) Feua ; Etta says he was very fond of something which he did notdo by himself ; and it seemed to do with numbers, as if he playedwith something with numbers on, and he used to take turns withit. Whatever this was with numbers he used to like to do something with curved lines, grooves and curved lines and numbers : he used to do this after tea, it occupied some time after tea. [At a recent Fair he was particularly successful w'ith one of the automatic machines from which he won pennies by shooting into numberedcircles. \u201cNot by himself\u201d; he was always accompanied there byothers and of course would take his turn at the machine and not monopolise it. \u201c After tea \u201d : he did this several times during eveningsafter tea.]\r\n(30) Feda : He played indoors with coloured marbles, it was somethingthey did on a table. [Yes, he played a game with coloured marbles and a card pattern onthe table.]\r\n(31) Feda : They had been trying to make something\u2014this is nothingto do with what I said about building\u2014they had been doingsomething intricate in the house that Bobbie was interested in,\r\nthey got a lot of parts for it, like fixing them all up together.\r\nThey were wanting some other 2>arts for it not long before Bobbie2)assed over. [Mr Burrows was fitting up a gymnasium for Bobbie and it was notyet finished. They still required a horizontal ladder and other items.\r\nIt was being made in an upstairs room and Mr Burrows added to it each\r\ntime he called.

T. : I made a mistake, the name is Newlove. Let us call himBobbie. Have they brought him ?\r\n(34) Feda : Yes, and they thought about passing over a few messages.What is that you are showing me ? Will you ask is there aphotograph of Bobbie in a rather peculiar position 1 I see himfull faced, or very nearly full faced, but with something in frontof him, as if there is a board in front of him. It is as if he hadbeen photographed sitting at the back of something, like at theback of a board or a tray or something. In the position heseemed to be leaning a bit forward towards the tray or board orwhatever it is, I get a feeling of a crouching position.\r\n[Mr Hatch writes : \u201c This is certainly remarkable. The last photograph we have of Bobbie is in fancy dress. He is the Jack of Heartswith boards back and front like a sandwich-man. On his head is acrown as in a pack of cards. It is wrong that he was sitting or crouching,he was standing erect (see Fig. I.).\u201d\r\nOne is uncertain whether Feda was given a visual impression of thisparticular photograph or whether she received Bobbie\u2019s generalisedimpression of his various attitudes while wearing the fancy dress.]\r\n(35) Feda : Will you ask also if he had been given\u2014I think it musthave been a joke\u2014something new that he was fond of using orwearing on his head, something round ; if it was a cap it had nopeak to it. He used to put it on his head and I think he liked it. Mr John is trying to draw just like a ring, like something he hadput on. It has no peak to it at all. You had better say something round that was new, to wear on his head, that he waspleased at having. It was as if he thought it was rather important putting this round thing on his head.\r\n[This apparently refers to the crown. He was so fond of putting it on that his mother had to check him lest it should be worn out. (SeeFig. II.)]\r\n(36) Feda : What does Bobbie want to say about his nose, his nose hurt ? (hand rubs nose).\r\nHe is making me feel as if something had hurt his nose on theside towards the end of his earthly life. Oh, he doesn\u2019t think it caused his passing or anything of that kind.\r\n[Mr Hatch writes : \u201c Bobbie was learning to box, and on the last lesson his instructor, usually very gentle with him, gave him a blow onthe nose which brought tears to his eyes.

She seemed as if very kind to him,\r\nlike giving up things to him and being very nice to him, and this\r\ngirl has been\u2014I can\u2019t get this quite\u2014but it is something to do\r\nwith a ball that belonged to Bobbie. I don\u2019t think this is much\r\ngood\u2014you see I am not getting this from Mr John now, I am\r\ngetting it from Bobbie. Something this girl has been doing about\r\na ball that Bobbie was fond of \"when he was here, the girl has\r\nbeen doing something with it. [The child Marjorie at the Rink had a special part which she played\r\nat the commencement of hockey matches. The team termed her their\r\nmascot, and she began their competitions by an exhibition of skating in\r\nwhich she finally drove a ball into the goal. Bobbie enjoyed watching\r\nthis. She was twelve years old and they were great friends. While\r\nMarjorie was away on a visit Bobbie said to his mother, \u201c If I don\u2019t see Marjorie soon I shall go mad \u201d. This was only a month before his death.\r\nThe sittings allude to her several times. The ball did not, of course, belong to Bobbie although he may at times have joined in playing with\r\nit ; for he often skated with Marjorie.]\r\n(40) Feda : And will you ask them if he went to a j^lace where there was\r\na broken stile ? At least it may not have been the stile itself that\r\nyou put your foot on was broken, but a part of the construction\r\nthrough which the stile was made was broken.\r\n(41) And there was a long footpath there too, part of it seems to go\r\nbetween something, like as if you were going between something\r\nrather high, I get like a high wall on one side. There is not\r\nusually building near stiles now, but I get the feeling of something close to the path and the stile.\r\n(42) When you get over the stile it is more open.\r\n(43) Then I think there is a church with a group of trees round it.\r\n(44) I feel you have only got to go a little way over the stile, and\r\nthere is something that would be dangerous near to this stile,\r\nsomething you can fall down, as if you would say to children, \u201c Now, don\u2019t go that way.\u201d It is something you could fall down\r\ninto. And it is wet too ; I can\u2019t see the water\u2014I think they want me\r\nto say that\u2014and yet it feels sticky and wet there.\r\n( 45 )\r\n454 C. Drayton Thmnas [PAET(46) This is a place that Bobbie would know very well, would havereason to know. He has been thinking of it lately when he hasbeen with his people on the earth. He must have been near thisplace with them and it made him think about it again, whereashe would have forgotten it.\r\n]\\ir Hatch writes ; \u201c This is very good. A favourite walk was bya stile. Whether it is damaged I do not know, but I will find out.And beyond it is a church with trees. His body is buried in thechurchyard. Past the stile the path leads to a quarry, at the foot ofwhich is water. (See Fig. Ill, p 488.) Bobbie wanted to go there toplay, but we forbade it.\u201d Mr Hatch wrote later ; \u201c I have been thewalk described in your last notes, but cannot find any damagedstile ; however, these last messages are the best we have had.\u201d\r\nMr Hatch enclosed a plan of his walk, which is here reproduced(Plan 1 ). The stile, which had been there in Bobbie\u2019s time, and wasPlan ].\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 455\r\nbroken, had now been completely removed. Beyond the site of this\r\nstile a footpath runs along the precipitous edge of a quarry. Bobbie\u2019s\r\nmother tells me that she used to regard this unprotected path as dangerous. It is now made safe by a fence. There is no high wall on the side opposite the quarry but a row of houses ; these houses\r\nmight be described as \u201c something rather high \u201d and \u201c like a high\r\nwall on one side \u201d. \u201c When you get over the stile it is more open \u201d ; yes, there is an extensive view over the quarry on the left. \u201c Church\r\nwith a group of trees round it \u201d\r\n; this is a few minutes\u2019 walk from\r\nthe quarry, not connected with it, but part of a walk which the\r\nfamily often took. \u201c He must have been near this place with them,\r\netc. \u201d ; Mr Hatch adds, \u201c Yes, almost every time we have gone out\r\nsince his passing we have been either to the grave or to a friend who\r\nlives near.\u201d\r\nOn re-reading the above, while preparing this paper, I mistakenly\r\nassumed that the walk which the family often took included the\r\npath by the stile. It therefore seemed inexplicable that, if passing\r\nthe site of the stile \u201c almost every time we have been out since his\r\npassing \u201d\u2014a\r\nj^eriod of several weeks\u2014they should have been un- aware of the stde and its subsequent removal.\r\nTo my letter of enquiry about this Mr Hatch replied on February\r\n24, 1935, \u201c You are mistaken in thinking that we had often taken\r\nthe walk by the stile after Bobbie\u2019s death. The walk we did take was up the road to the grave. Gwen {i.e. Mrs Hewlove) went the\r\nwalk after your sitting and could not find the stde, though she had\r\nthought there was one. We then vuote you that the description of\r\nthe walk was correct except that there was no broken stile. Some\r\nweeks afterwards I found from a friend that a broken stde had been\r\nthere but had been removed shortly before Bobbie\u2019s death.\u201d\r\nThird Sitting {Continued).\r\n(47) Feda : A place near there beginning with Sw\u2014 It is near the\r\nplace they have been describing.

Why it has collapsed Mr John does not\r\nknow, and he doesn\u2019t think Bobbie does either, but it is left there\r\nin heaps, partly standing and partly a heap of debris.\r\n[Sw . . . L \u201d ; These letters present an unsolved puzzle.\r\nAs to the ruined building, Mr Hatch wuote : \u201c Nearer our house than\r\nthe quarry is an old barn, partly standing and partly a heap of debris.\u201d]\r\n2h\r\n456 C. Drayton Thomas [part(49) Feda : What was it Bobbie used to do with that ? Bobbie wantsto tell me about a very wonderful strap he had got, it went roundsomething. He was always fitting it on and taking it ofi, makingit a bit longer and a bit shorter, as if he was trying to pull it like that. (Medium\u2019s hands here acted as if pulling up to the shoulder.)\r\nAs if it was made of rubber or elastic. He was always pulling it, and his mother did not like it much, she used to say, \u201c Now becareful, mind what you do with that \u201d.\r\n[His mother remembers that he would pull out an elastic band orsomething similar, and she warned him, being afraid that it would fly in her face or his.]\r\n(50) Feda : Did he tell you anything about a man relative who hadpassed over not long before he did ? Mr John says it is almostimpossible for us to be correct in calculating time, but he wouldhave thought it would be about two years. He was connectedwith the family ; and there is a letter \u2018 A \u2019 in connection withthis. [His father\u2019s brother-in-law, named Arthur, died suddenly about twoyears before this.]\r\n(51) Feda : Bobbie was funny about his food, some foods that boys likehe was rather strange about, as if he did not like a certain food,he was very difficult about it, and there was something that hewas being given only a little while before he passed over that hedid not like at all. It was one of his pet aversions. It was a food,quite an ordinary food that many boys would like but he happened not to. He was given it towards the end of his earth life. [Quite correct. He was funny about food ; for instance, he wouldnever touch jam, not even a cake that had a little jam in it. He dislikedmilk too. Bobbie\u2019s mother wrote : \u201c The food which Bobbie was beinggiven towards the end of his earth life, his pet aversion, was the whiteof egg. He hated it and always left it, but I was beginning to insist thathe should try to eat it.\u201d]\r\n(52) Feda : Did Mr John tell you that for a boy he would think Bobbiewas rather affectionate, sensitive to people\u2019s words and actionsand even thoughts, a particularly understanding kind of boy.Thinks there would be a very strong link between himself andhis family. He was not quite the casual off-hand boy. He wasa boy with a good deal of deep feeling and understanding.\r\n(53) He was rather fond of flowers, which not many boys are. MrJohn says, T think he means some particular plants that perhapshe took an interest in and would notice more than many boys.\r\n[Mr Hatch wrote : \u201c The first part is correct, but I do not think hewas very fond of flowers \u201d. During my visit I was talking with Bobbie\u2019s friend Mr Burrows, the\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 457\r\nboxing instructor, who told me that Bobbie liked to come with him to\r\nhis garden. While there he showed much interest in potato plants,\r\nwhich he had never previously seen. He had not understood that\r\nseveral potatoes grew on a single root. Mr Burrow's therefore gave him\r\none to plant, and Bobbie was excited about its growth and over zealous\r\nin watering it. He often inquired when he might dig it up, and fre- quently spoke of it at home. He lived to see it flower only.]\r\n(54) Feda : You must not take it off the shelf, you must leave it on the\r\nshelf near the corner. Leave it on the shelf where the others\r\ncould see it and have it. He used to take it sometimes\u2014I think\r\nI have got this right\u2014there was something that used to be on the corner of the shelf, and sometimes Bobbie wanted it, and they\r\nused to say, \u201c Leave it on the shelf in case the others want it \u201d, \u2014something round and smooth and polished.\r\nC. D. T. : I wonder w'hat he did with it when he took it in his\r\nhands ? Feda : Was it a watch ? C. D. T. : Are you guessing, Feda ? Feda : I was only asking him, because it looked like a watch he was holding in the palm of his hand.\r\nC. D. T. : What does he say ? Feda : He seems to be twisting something like you do a watch or\r\na clock.\r\nC. D. T. : Winding it ? Feda : Yes, winding something.\r\nC. D. T. : Is it Bobbie showing this ? Feda : It is Bobbie giving it to me. It feels something like a watch.\r\nC. D. T. : It looks like a selected bit of evidence, but it just lacks\r\nthe definite indication. I could think of at least four things.\r\nFeda : You had better not guess. He rolls it or winds it. It was\r\nnot a watch. They still have it. It is not in that place, it has\r\nbeen put somewhere else, but they have still got it. Bobbie\r\nthinks it has been put in a drawer instead of on the shelf. Is it on a plate ? He is giving me the idea of a plate being near it. [Mr Hatch writes : \u201c Bobbie was very fond of a little salt-sifter which\r\nhe won at Morecambe. It was kept at the corner of a shelf and he used\r\nto twist the cork at the bottom and to roll it along the dinner table. It has been moved, but not into a drawer. It is of glazed earthenware,\r\nshaped like a dog. \u2018 Round, smooth and polished \u2019 is correct. It is now\r\nkept on a shelf just below the dinner plates.\u201d (See Fig. II.)]\r\n458 C.

If they were answered correctly it would bewell-nigh overwhelming proof of survival. I leave it to you, ofcourse, but to save time I append the questions :\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 459\r\n1. What (lifl P)ohbie keep in the bathroom cuplioard i\r\n2. Where did he like to go with his Mummie last winter in the\r\nevenings and was looking forward to going again this winter ?\r\n3. What did he do in the attic besides boxing ?\r\nI put these questions, and it will be observed as we proceed that\r\ntwo of them were answered with some detail. It is as well to\r\nmention here that I thought it would be interesting to compare the\r\nresult with my own guesses. I therefore wrote to Mr Hatch that\r\nI guessed ;\r\n(1) Boat, (2) the Pictures, or Ice Skating-rink, (3) playing with\r\ntrains. It became clear after the next few sittings that my alter- native guess for number (2), Skating-rink, was partly correct. I did\r\nnot learn mitil the sittings were completed that my guess for (1) \u201c Boat \u201d was also correct. But it is, perhaps, of some significance\r\nin view of the telepathic hypothesis, that this never emerged in\r\nreplies to these questions, nor did my third guess, which proved\r\ncompletely wrong.\r\nFeda ; Etta says that she has brought the boy ; you know, Bobbie\r\nNewlove, and that he wanted to say one or two things before they\r\nwent on to anything else.\r\nC. D. T. : Bobbie, I can\u2019t think what it was you used to do in the attic\r\nbesides boxing. I have been trying to guess.\r\n(55) Feda : Had he been given by his people something that was in a box, and he used to take it out and it seemed to be in an awful lot of pieces? I think he had two boxes to do with it, he used to take\r\nthings out of the boxes as if he was fastening them together.\r\nWhat he is building seems as if it comes up to a 2Joint, or there is a high something sticking iqi on top of it. I feel there is a pokingup j3art on top ; and I think there is a picture to do with it too, as if he was trying to build something from the picture, or to look\r\nlike it. [Mr Hatch : \u201c This might be his Meccano. Bobbie was fond of\r\nmaking cranes with it which certainly come uj) to a jJoint. He also had\r\na Meccano aerojdane in two boxes. Both have j^ictures as a guide.\u201d]\r\n(56) Feda : Had Bobbie a duck ? I will tell you what he is showing\r\nme ; it looks something like a duck. Will you ask if he had a toy\r\nduck ? I think that is right. I see it in his hand like as if he is pushing it towards me. I don\u2019t think its legs is very long, or else he is holding his legs up a bit, but ducks have not got very long\r\nlegs. I think it must be a duck because of its legs.\r\n[Possibly this was an attempt to refer again to the dog salt-sifter which Bobbie had won at Morecambe (see Third Sitting, No. 54). If so, the subject is resumed later in this sitting, No. 61. The dog stands on\r\nshort hind legs with fore legs inconspicuous.]\r\n460 C. Drayton Thomas [part(57) Feda ; He keeps on saying \u201c mice He was interested in something to do with mice and 1 think someone else is mixed n]) withthis, l.iecause I get a feeling of another child, or young person, whowas interested in and had as much to do with the mice as Bobbiehad\r\n.\r\n[Bobbie\u2019s mother wrote ; \u201c 1 have at last been able to make inquirieswith regard to the mice. Bobbie, it appears, was interested in somemice which a friend of his had. Apparently he brought some to showus, but was shooed off again because I am frightened of them. I have onlya very vague remembrance of this, but the boy friend is quite certain.\u201d](58) Feua : What are you showing me ? Did you pull a string out ofthe wall ? Bobbie did some funny things for a boy, now look, hei s going to the wall and he seems as if he is untwisting somethingand he is pulling something from the wall, either thick string orrope, and on the end he seems to be fixing something carefully.That is important, what he is doing with it. It is the pulling it out that seems to be the important thing. It is something aboutdrawing it out as far as is possible and then letting it go back tothe wall again. It is something that he seemed to do ratherregularly.\r\n[Mr. Hatch : \u201c This is good ; in the attic he had, among other things,an arrangement for strengthening the muscles. The drawing appendedwill show you the idea. Drawing it out was the important thing, and hedid it rather regularly.\u201d (See drawing.)\r\nThis is evidently the answer to question No. 3, which was, \u201c What didhe do in the attic besides boxing ? \u201d]\r\n(59)\r\nFeda : Ask if he was going to have something done to his teeth alittle while before he passed over, something that was delayed a\r\n143j 461\r\nlittle. That was before he got very ill. He remembers having\r\nhis teeth looked at, and that something was to be done.\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c Yes, we knew he would have to visit the dentist soon,\r\nand we were rather worried about it.\u201d]\r\n(60) Feda : His mother had a rather important engagement before he\r\npassed over, he thinks it was a Saturday, and he thinks that his\r\nbeing ill would have in some way interfered with it. He thinks\r\nit was something for the Saturday afternoon.\r\n[Mrs Newlove tells me that she had such an engagement fixed for the\r\nSaturday, it was with the Brownies of which she was an official. Bobbie was taken ill on the previous Sunday. Directly his illness became\r\nserious, Mrs Newlove wrote to postpone the engagement. Bobbie died\r\nthe following Thursday night. Bobbie knew that his mother was to have spent that Saturday with the Brownies.]\r\n(61) Feda : Not the name Bobbie, but another name beginning with\r\n\u2018 B \u2019 that was rather important in their house. I mustn\u2019t say\r\nsound because I am getting this by feeling. He gives \u2018 B \u2019 by\r\nsound, but now I get the feeliiig that this would seem to be more\r\nlike an animal\u2019s name, or the name of a toy. It is something in\r\ntheir house that he was very fond of, and he calls it a funny name\r\nbeginning with \u2018 B \u2019, not a long name. Wait a bit\u2014Ber, Bunkey,\r\nBussey. The name he is giving me sounds as if it began Bus\r\nor Bos.\r\n[This is possibly a further reference to the salt-sifter mentioned\r\npreviously (see No. 56). It is shaped like a dog in sitting posture.\r\nBobbie was very fond of it and called it his \u201c bow-wmw \u201d. Cf. Like an\r\nanimal\u2019s or toy\u2019s name. A funny name beginning with \u2018 B \u2019.]\r\n(62) Feda : There is someone he liked and was interested in whose\r\nname began with \u2018 W \u2019 and it sounds like Wenda, or Wendy, that\r\nis the nearest I can get to it. [Mr Hatch : \u201c We can only think of a Winnie in whom he was\r\ninterested.\u201d]\r\n(63) Feda : Bobbie wants to say something about handwriting. He\r\nwas told to do something which would help, and he had been\r\ntrying to do it. He wanted to improve it, and he tried to before\r\nhe passed over.\r\n(64) The reason he is mentioning this is because it has been spoken\r\nof lately, and he wanted to say, \u201c Yes, I was trying to do it a\r\nlittle while before I passed over.\u201d\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c We begged him to try with his writing as it was keeping him back at school. We had mentioned his bad writing when trying\r\nto read his diary\r\n\r\nafter his passing.\u201d]\r\n(65) Feda : His people have been talking about going to a place that was much connected with Bobbie when he was here, and they\r\nknow that they ought to go some time. It may make them a bit\r\n4f)2 C. Drayton Thomas [part\r\nsad lifcause of the connections with Bol)l)ie when he was on the\r\nearth. There is an initial \u2018 H \u2019 connected with where they are\r\ngoing. I get Ha- They have been thinking of going to this\r\nplace. He feels as if something is making them go to this place.\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201cWe have thought of visiting friends near Halifax. The\r\njdace has no associations with Bobbie, but the \u2019bus journey there would\r\nremind us vividly of him, as we have been most of the way there with\r\nhim.\u201d\r\nIf this Ha\u2014 was an endeavour to transmit the name Halifax, it is an\r\ninstance of Feda\u2019s imperfect clairaudience, similar to the preceding B,\r\nBer, Bunkey for bow-wow, and the Wenda for Winnie.]\r\n(66) Feda ; Will you ask his mother if she has been thinking or doing\r\nanything about Rosemary ; will you say that ? He means it as a little message for her. He wanted it to be symbolical. Hefelt it was in her mind.\r\n[Boldue was interested in the Guides and the Brownies and his\r\nmother\u2019s work with them. After Bobbie\u2019s death she began to receive\r\nletters in connexion with this work from Lady Rosemary Stopford.\r\nThe name Rosemary might be considered symbolical of this work, but\r\nit did not strike Mrs Newlove until some time after she had written to inform me that the name was not recognised.]\r\n(67) Fepa : He keeps on saying he has seen Arthur there.\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c In a previous sitting (see ])aragraph 50) it was correctly\r\nstated that a connexion, actually his father\u2019s brother-in-law, died\r\nsuddenly about two years ago. The initial \u2018 A \u2019 was given ; now the full name is correctly given.\u201d]\r\n(68) Feda : And there is a funny name he is remembering, sounding\r\nrather like Euan. It is a name that Bobbie remembers, some- body he used to be interested in, and the name does sound very\r\nmuch like Euan.\r\n(This is not recognised.]\r\n((i!J) Feda : l)o you know if there was some discussion about havinganother doctor, if another doctor had to be got to look at him,\r\nsuddenly, late ; Ijecause I keep getting a mix-up between twodoctors.\r\n[Mr Hatch ; \u201c Correct.

(2) What did you do in the attic besides boxing ? and (3) Where did you go last winter evenings with your motherand were hoping to go again this winter ? It may be that youhave given the answers already.\r\n143 468 ] A Proxy Case\r\n(71) Feda : When he went with his mother didn\u2019t he carry something\r\nfor her 1 feel it is ratlier imjxirtant that he carried something\r\nfor her, not sometliing that he put under his arm, hut something\r\nswinging a bit. [Mr Hatch : \u201c Bobbie was keenly interested in roller-skating and it is curious that you guessed correctly this answer to the question about\r\nwhat he did on winter evenings. Bobbie used to carry his skates\r\nswinging. His mother sometimes olfered to carry them but he would\r\nnever allow her to do so. Possibly he feels that he carried them to save\r\nher trouble.\u201d]\r\n(72) Feda : And when they walked did he hold her arm ? I don\u2019t know\r\nif he always did this, but I get a very strong feeling of holding her arm. Boys don\u2019t usually do that, but I seem to get him doing\r\nthis when they went out at night.\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c Yes, correct.\u201d]\r\n(73) Feda ; Tliey had spoken and thought about buying something new for this winter that was going to be rather expensive in connexion with where they were going together. It was a bit\r\nexpensive, but it would be rather an improvement on what they\r\nhad. He enjoyed going to tliis place, and lie would talk about\r\nit a lot afterwards, and about the progress they had made.\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c There was some talk of a pair of skates for his mother.\r\nShe had none, but used a pair from the rink. It is true that he enjoyed\r\ngoing and would talk about the progress they had made.\u201d]\r\n(74) Feda : What a funny place it is, there did not seem much furniture\r\nthere. Will you ask if it was rather a bare place, because I am\r\ngetting a feeling of a place that is rather bare, perhajis it is purposely bare ? It feels as if it was a ]ilace where they cleared\r\nthe furniture ; it feels as if there were a lot of other people there\r\ntoo. I keep hearing voices. That has to do with where they went\r\non winter evenings, and t hey hojied to go again, only after buying\r\nsomething special.\r\nC. D. T. : He has not told you what it is ? Feda : No, I can\u2019t get what it is. [Mr Hatch : \u201c A correct description of the rink.\u201d]\r\n(75) Feda : There was someone they used to expect to see there, a youngish man, someone they knew particularly well, someone much older than Bobbie. Now I am seeing an \u2018 M \u2019, I think that\r\nwould be the man\u2019s name. And getting warm there.\r\n[Mr Burrows, a great friend of Bobbie\u2019s, was a prominent person at\r\nthe rink. The little girl, Marjorie, previously mentioned in these notes, was there also as a semi-professional.\r\nNote Feda\u2019s wrong inference : \u201c M\u2014I think that would be the man\u2019s\r\nname.\u201d \u201c Getting warm there \u201d ; one certainly does in roller skating.]\r\n(76) Feda ; Did she ask him to get new boots for it ? I get a discussion\r\n464 C. Drayfoii Thomas [partabout boobs or shoes to do with it, which he knows she will remember. He is losing it a bit, he is going back a bit. [Mr Hatch : \u201c Bolibie wanted new lioots for the rink.\u201d]\r\n(77) 0. D. T. ; Bobbie, what did you keep in the bathroom cupboard ? Show a jhcture of it, think about it and let Feda see. Feda ; No, Bobbie, I amseeing that wrong, what is it ? not a balloon,\r\nBobbie, it would go bang ! I don\u2019t know what he means now, he\r\nshows me a picture which looks like a balloon, and it came whenyou asked him. I feel it is light and round, like something that\r\nfloats in the air. Will you ask them if he did keep one in the\r\nbathroom cupboard ? [There is no known connexion between this reply and the bathroom.\r\nI suspect that we have here an example of the confusion which inevitably follows when the sitter\u2019s question is ignored and the communicator continues his previous train of thought. Bobbie had just beenspeaking about the rink\u2014carrying skates, buying new skates, the rink,\r\npersons he knew there, new boots for skating. What more natural\r\nthan that he should think of the Festal Nights at the rink in which heusually captured several of the coloured balloons ? On those nights a bunch of balloons was dropped to be scrambled for by the children. I have repeatedly noticed that, for reasons which we can guess, a communicator either does not catch one\u2019s question, or prefers to completewhat he has in mind to say.]\r\nC. D. T. : Can you show Feda what you did in the attic ?\r\n(78) Feda : He is lying on the floor. I suppose you are lying on the\r\nfloor ? He is showing me something like stretched on the floor.\r\nI think he wants me to go flat on the floor or something. It feels as if I have got to lie on the floor and move something. I wantto waggle altogether, sort of squirm about. I think my handsand feet and head is going. That is all I can get about it. [Mr Hatch : \u201c Lying on the floor is correct. Bobbie was given drills there ; raising legs while on his back, raising the body from the handsand toes, and various tricks.\u201d]\r\nC. D. T. : I was very interested when they sent me a photographof Bobbie showing the board that Feda seemed to see him lookingover, and the round thing on his head without a brim that Fedadescribed. It was all perfectly shown in the photograph. Theonly discrepancy was that he was not crouching. It was a fancydress occasion, and he was representing someone, and he had thelarge card half as big as himself slung in front of him to illustrate the character he portrayed.\r\n(79) Feda : No, Etta, no, what do you mean about a book ? Somethingis coming back to my mind about that, but I am not in a positionnow to ask Bobbie to verify this, but you know we have told youthat when we are bringing a would-be communicator to you\r\nU3] A Proxy Case 4(i5\r\nwe often know something ahout it Ix'forehand, we know tlie synopsis of what they are going to give. Well, to my mind now\r\nthere comes l)ack the recollection about a book. Will you find\r\nout, did he get it from a book, had he been interested in a book\r\nthat is in some way connected with what he pretended to be ?\r\nI do remember that he was going to speak about a book.\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c The boards had been used before, not by Bobbie, but\r\nhe knew about it ; they were used in a play by Brownies taken from\r\nAlice in Wonderland.

They shut up one lot of doors and opened the others, went in by\r\na different set of doors to what there were first. There was a\r\ndifferent arrangement of the doors afterwards. He only just\r\nremembered about that.\r\n[Mr Hatch ; \u201c This is incorrect. No change has been made regarding\r\nthe doors of the skating rink.\u201d]\r\n(91) Feda : And did he use something made of celluloid, something that\r\nhe used and they wanted him to stop using it ? They thought it might make a flame or explosion.\r\n[Mr Hatch ; \u201c Yes, he had bought a second-hand cinematograph\r\nlantern, and we were a little nervous about the celluloid films.\u201d]\r\n(92) Feda ; Will you ask his mother whether she had the bathroom\r\ndone after he passed over, the walls, because he remembers she\r\nwanted to have them done ? there was something that she was\r\ntalking about having done before he passed over, about the bath- room ; talking about the bathroom reminded him.\r\n[The family say that parts of the bathroom wall and ceiling needed\r\nattention where the lincrusta was loose. This had been put right since\r\nBobbie\u2019s passing.]\r\n143] A Proxy Case 467\r\n(93) Feda ; Wait a bit, Bobbie. I nearly got what you are trying to give me. He saw that his mother had folded up a coloured paper\r\nthing that he had used. It was something he wore. You know,\r\ntissue paper ? Well, he is showing me that and in several colours,\r\nand as if they were folded up into conical shape and triangular\r\nshapes ; but she has had to fold them very carefully, because they\r\nhave been folded up before, and there seems to be several of them,\r\nbecause they seem to make a big lump. It was something that\r\nshe had an idea might come in useful again, and it was something\r\nBobbie had helped her with. Part of it was a puce pink, and also\r\nthere was a bright green and blue ; there seemed to be several\r\ncolours, white as well, and he thinks his mother folded them and\r\nput them all in a box together ; but he did not use them again,\r\nbecause he passed over. There has been an occasion since he\r\npassed over in which, and for which, they could have used them,\r\nbut they did not, and he rather thought they would, but yet was\r\nnot surprised when they did not. [Mr Hatch writes : \u201c This might be the caps out of Christmas crackers\r\nwhich were folded up, and which would have been used again if Bobbie\r\nhad lived.\u201d\r\nIn answer to my further inquiry I was assured that these caps amswered\r\nto the description, including the \u201c puce colour \u201d.]\r\n(94) C. D. T. : They did not know what you meant about the month of\r\nApril. They don\u2019t think anything happened in April ; was it your birthday, Bobbie ? [In a previous sitting Feda had mentioned April but failed to catch\r\nBobbie\u2019s meaning. Finally she had said, \u201c He keeps on saying April.\r\nI think they will recognise it.\u201d]\r\nFeda : Xo, it was not, nor his passing.\r\nC. D. T. : Was it connected with your school, Bobbie ? Feda : A\"es, in a way. Sir. You are getting very near it. C. D. T. : Did you win something then ? Feda : Xo, but he tried something.\r\nC. D. T. : Work or play 1 Feda : It was a bit of both. It was something that he tried to do,\r\nthere was a kind of meeting about it, which he was rather important in, and which he thought a lot of and looked forward to. (Long pause.) And Atkins, there is a name he is giving me sounding like Atkins. It is either Atkins or Atkinson. I get At\u2014\r\n,\r\nAtk\u2014, and that is all mixed up with the April thing.\r\n[This may refer to the following facts wFich were given me by the\r\nfamily on my visit to them. Bobbie had wished to enter for his school\r\nsports. He asked permission, and the matter was discussed by the family.\r\nAlthough the sports were held in the summer the competitors\u2019 names\r\nwere taken in April. There was a similar family discussion as to his entering for the fancy dress parade of the Hospital, at which he wore\r\nthe Jack of Hearts costume. The name is not recognised.]\r\n468 C.

Feda ; I think it is something to do with bow-wow, he seemed to come forward and somehow open to me about that.\r\nC. D. T. : The little girl they thought was Winnie, whom Bobbieknew so well. You said Wendy.\r\nFeda : That is the right one, but that was Feda\u2019s fault. [My object in reporting on these items was partly to give encouragement, and partly in the hope of eliciting further confirmatory descriptions. I attach little value to a mere assent when I ask if such-and-suchis the right solution.]\r\nCJ. D. T. ; And what else did you do in the attic besides exercisesto strengthen the muscles ? You boxed, but you did other thingsthere too ?\r\n(95) Feda : What is he pretending to l)e ? Is he being silly ? He is jumping about, putting his hands like that\u2014(here medium\u2019s armswere thrown upward), bowing and like that. He is pretendingto be acting, like clowns or something ; it is something like thathe did, because he made me feel he wanted to be something like posing and all that.\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c I think this is good.

I think that would bemarked in him as a boy, because boys are very careless in manythings, and Bobbie was not. He was a normal boy, but he hadstrong powers of perception and observation. '\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c Very true. Bobbie certainly had powers of observationabove the average.\u201d]\r\n(102) Feda ; Another thing about him, he would have had a rather[ scientific mind.\r\n| [Mr Hatch ; \u201c I think that, as far as one can judge a boy of ten, this , is correct. He used to pore over some books of mine on palaeontology.He mastered the names of certain extinct monsters. He loved chemicalor electrical toys.\u201d]\r\n(103) Feda : He also had a strongly artistic side which I think he gets1 from his mother. She says he is not telling you this, it is Etta.Bobbie gets some artistic power through his mother\u2019s side ofthe family.\r\nWill you ask his mother whether someone rather closely con-nected with her became rather well known and esteemed forsome special artistic work that I think was connected withdrawing or designing ? Bobbie has inherited that, not in theexact form that his relative had it, but the same gift in a ratherdifferent form. (See 104.)\r\n[Mr Hatch : \u201c We do not think he was artistic. He could not drawat all well, but he had good taste. His mother is not artistic either, butan uncle of hers is well known in the east of England as an architect.\u201d](104) Feda : Bobbie has an exceptionally good idea of form, outline,shape, proportion, perspective\u2014I gather that his people haveconcrete evidence of it. [Mr Hatch : \u201c No, Bobbie had not good ideas of form, perspective,etc., and we have nothing concrete of artistic value of his.\u201d\r\nOn my vi.sit to Nelson 1 was shown some of Bobbie\u2019s artistic effortswith paints ; they are crude, and scarcely equal to the average for boysof his age. Etta\u2019s impression of his abilities in this direction seemsmistaken.]\r\n(105) Feda : A little thing that Bobbie mentioned to her ; an oblongwooden box with a flat lid that just comes down on top of thething. Inside this seems to be a collection of, well\u2014metal things ; Etta says, I can\u2019t remember what he said it was now\u20141 thinksome kind of tools. But they are special things.\r\nI gather he had had a set given him as a present not very longbefore he passed over, and something about them had to bechanged, exchanged. 1 don\u2019t know whether he meant the boxhad to be exchanged, but something in it had to be exchanged.\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 471\r\nIt was not quite right for what he wanted. Somewhere on the\r\nbox is a round stamp or label. I think Bobbie said it was near\r\nthe edge or corner. [Mr Hatch : \u201c We do not know what this means. He had no wooden\r\nbox as is described, and he had not had a set of tools for a long time. At\r\nthe last Christmas he was given a Meccano aeroplane construction set,\r\nbut it was in a cardboard box. It had a large number in a circle like a\r\nlabel in the corner.\u201d\r\nI incline to think that two boxes are here confused, either in Etta's\r\nmemory or in the transmission through Feda : (1)1 was shown the one\r\ngiven to Bobbie more recently, and its lid answers to the description.\r\n(2) The aeroplane set, which he had two years before, was beyond his power to 2)iece together, and so was taken back to the shop to be built\r\nup.]\r\n(106) Feda : Are Bobbie\u2019s jreople hel^ring a very old j^erson ?

I don\u2019t think it is a chemist\u2019sshop, really, but it is a place with bottles and weighing things,and like instruments and things of that kind. I have a feelingthat he had been in such a place, and was very interested in it, and liked going, too. I get a feeling of a clean, white place, all nice and clean and white. Clean tajrs and bottles and measuringthings. He went there for some reason. [Mr Hatch : \u201c This is very good. I had a good deal to do with alaboratory in the town, and Bobbie liked to go there with me. Thereference to taps, bottles and weighing things is quite correct.\u201d\r\nI gathered later, when discussing this with Mr Hatch, that Feda\u2019semphasis upon the cleanliness of the place was a trifle overdone.]\r\nTenth Sitting, May 19, 1933.\r\nC.

[Mr Hatch : \u201c Yes, he was certainly polite.\u201d]\r\nIll) Feda: His mother has been thinking something about a cap,thinking something rather special of it lately. It is only a little thing, but he just wanted her to know it.\r\n[Mr Hatch writes : \u201c Yes, she has been thinking about his cap.\u201d]\r\n(112) Feda : She came across something with a special badge on it. It is not a heart e.xactly, but the lower part is rather shaped like aheart, at the bottom it is heart-shaped. It is something like astraight line goes through the top of it, and a little upstandingpiece comes out of the top.\r\nMr Hatch replied that they knew no badge of this shape. On myvisit to Nelson I asked whether Bobbie had a badge on his schoolsports jacket, or other kind of badge. They knew of none. I therefore marked this as a failure. Later in the day I was shown theboards and cap which had been spoken of in an earlier sitting, and ofwhich I wished to take a photograph. On seeing the Jack of Heartsi\r\n143 ] ^4 Proxy Case 473\r\ncap I recognised it as answering exactly to this description. Cf. photograph (35) and notice the heart on the front of the crown or\r\ncap, with the line going each side the top of the heart, and the\r\n\u201c little upstanding piece at the top The one inaccuracy was the\r\nstatement that \u201c it is not a heart exactly \u201d, unless one takes this to\r\nrefer to the cap itself, upon which the heart is fixed. Referring to\r\nmy notes I saw the words, \u201c she came across something with a\r\nspecial badge on it \u201d. A question elicited the reply that Bobbie\u2019s\r\nmother had turned out this paper crown while spring cleaning. The\r\ndate of this sitting agrees closely with the time when it had come\r\nunder her notice.\r\nSitting continued.\r\n(113) Feda : Wait a bit, don\u2019t be in a hurry.

I think the right-hand\r\nside of the church as you face it. I think it is somewhere his\r\nmother has been lately. Not going into the church, but going\r\ndown into the churchyard to the right, and I think the ground\r\nslopes down a bit just there too.

We have discovered\r\nsince you asked us about this that on one occasion only Bobbie wished\r\nto take another boy with him into this garden. The owner, however, did\r\nnot allow him to do so, as she felt, quite naturally, that if she allowed one\r\nshe might be expected to allow more, and the garden would be overrun. This other boy did not go into the garden, but only to the gate, while\r\nBobbie tried to obtain permission to have him in.

This is prefaced by an abbreviated outline of the course of events from the first mention of the\r\npipes to their final discovery.\r\nBOBBIE NEWLOVE\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF THE PIPES\r\n[Abbreviated outline.)\r\nThe story opens with a letter of appeal from Mr Hatch in which he\r\ninformed me of the recent loss of a boy aged ten. The cause of\r\ndeath was diphtheria. In a further letter the boy\u2019s name, Bobbie\r\nNewlove, was given. Beyond this, and the address of the boy\u2019s\r\nhome, I knew nothing of the facts which subsequently emerged at\r\nmy sittings with Mrs Leonard.\r\nOn the 2nd December, 1932, my father, while speaking about\r\nBobbie, expressed the opinion that there had been some cause which\r\nfacilitated his taking diphtheria.\r\nHe then added that this predisposition might be traced to something which happened nine tveehs before the boy\u2019s death, and he asked\r\nmy special attention to this fact. I quote one of his sentences\r\nverbatim : \u201c If it had happened to anyone coimected with you, you\r\nwould have immediately connected up the two happenings, nine\r\nweeks before his passing and his actual passing.\u201d\r\nIt may be that I saw in this some challenge to my intelligence ; for I resolved to discover what was imjDlied in those remarks.\r\nWhen I asked to be told exactly what it was which the above\r\nassertion hinted, the reply came, \u201c pipes\u2014pipes, he just says this\r\npipes. That word should be sufficient.\u201d This seemed to suggest\r\ninfection from defective drainage, and I expected that the family\r\nwould acquiesce in this. But they refused to accej;)t any suggestion\r\nof the kind, and replied that they could not trace the matter at all. The word \u201c pipes \u201d conveyed nothmg to them.\r\nWe must now' trace the indications given in successive sittings\r\nwhich finally led us to discover w'hat w'as meant by \u201cthe pipes \u201d.\r\nIt was not until three months after this first mention of pipes that\r\nthe family learnt of the exact place where Bobbie and his friend had\r\nplayed ; but even this left them without any clue as to why pipes\r\n482 C. Drayion Thomas [part\r\nhad been mentioned, and it was not until my visit on July 1, 1933,\r\nthat one pipe was discovered there. The second pipe, which justified\r\nthe use of the plural word, was not found until later. At the sitting m January 1933 Bobbie repeated the assertion that\r\nhis trouble was traceable to the pipes, and when I replied that his\r\npeople failed to find any connection between his illness and pipes\r\nFeda merely remarked that she considered Bobbie a very clearminded and intelligent boy. I therefore asked the family if they\r\nthought it probable that Bobbie might have heard diphtheria\r\nspoken of in connection with bad drains. The reply was : \u201c Wedo not know. It is very unlikely that Bobbie had heard of anyone\r\ncatching the disease from pipes.\u201d\r\nThe subject was resumed at a sitting later, in January 1933, and\r\nthe further information was then given that the pipes were not in a\r\nplace to which he went regularly, nor to which he went direct from\r\nhome, but that he had gone to them when in a second place. Clues\r\nto this second place were then given, and included a reference to\r\nanimals, which my father asked me to note particularly because,\r\n\u201c his j^eople may say w'hen they first read it that Bobbie never went\r\nto a place where there were such things. But he did.\u201d Among\r\nfurther descriptions of the j^lace was reference to a barn, having one\r\nside nearly or entirely open, more like a place of shelter, and containing bundles of straw. Another boy was said to have been there\r\nwith Bobbie and to have been the reason for Bobbie\u2019s going. Although these clues eventually led us to the right spot they were of no help at this early stage because the family were not familiar with\r\nthe locality in question.\r\nDuring a sitting in February 1933 I expressed a wish that some\r\ndefinite name might be given in order to assist the search. Feda\r\nthen said that she was being given a name like \u201c Bentley \u201d, and then,\r\nafter some struggles and uncertainty as to the word intended, she\r\npronounced \u201c Stock \u201d and proceeded to describe a town and certain\r\nstreets. In fact, a route was described and, as I learnt afterwards,\r\nquite correctly, which started from Bobbie\u2019s home, taking a loop\r\nround the railway station near by, and then going up hill past\r\nBentley Street (in which Bobbie\u2019s school was situated) and leading\r\nonward towards the old Stocks. The latter stand at the entrance to\r\nthe Churchyard. Now that we know where the pipes are, it is easy\r\nto see that Bobbie\u2019s description led us three-quarters of the way to\r\nthe place. These descriptions make it 'p&'>'f(^tly clear that the intelli- gence giving them ivas intimately acquainted with Bobbie\u2019s home and\r\nits surroundings. I should add here that I knew nothing whatever\r\nabout it, and that Mrs Leonard was never told that the town hi\r\nquestion had become of interest to me. In subsequent sittmgs\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 483\r\nadditional touches were given which, while they gave us no help at\r\nthe time, are significant because ultimately found to be correct. At a sitting in the middle of May 1933 a further description was\r\ngiven which eventually led us to the place itself,\u2014\u201c A place with an address on \u2018 B \u2019\r\n. . . he went to this \u2018 B \u2019 place at certain times.\u201d\r\nI say it led us eventually to the place itself. It is easy to see this now\r\nthat one knows the facts, but at the time it only puzzled us. It was not unnatural that \u2018 B \u2019 should suggest the Baths, and I inquired whether the family had heard of any infection in connexion\r\nwith pipes at the Baths. This, however, was a false scent, and led\r\nto nothing. In the same sitting the actual locality was mdicated by\r\nthe letter \u2018 H \u2019, but this, like the previous letter \u2018 B \u2019, failed to convey\r\nanything to us at the time.\r\nIt is now obvious that \u2018 H \u2019 meant \u201c the Heights \u201d, and \u2018 B \u2019 the\r\nname of Brierfield, the locality in which the Heights are situated.\r\nGuided by the clues given in reply to my inquiries the pipes were\r\nfinally discovered. Water issued from the ground through iron\r\npipes ! It was there that Bobbie had so often played during the\r\nweeks preceding his death. Infection from the water may have\r\ncaused a condition of blood w^hich weakened the boy\u2019s system before\r\nthe oncoming of diphtheria. Justification for the Communicator\u2019s\r\nopmion that the boy\u2019s death might be attributed to his playing there\r\nis found in a statement by the Medical Officer of Health for the\r\ndistrict. His letter will be quoted in full. Let us now take the sittings seriatim.\r\nTHE PEOBLEM OF THE PIPES.\r\nSecond Sitting, November 18, 1932.\r\nFeda : Did you tell Bobbie\u2019s people anything 1 felt about him\r\nhere ?

T. : Yes, that was right, throat trouble, he died from diphtheria.\r\nFeda : 1 got it very strongly, that feeling, it is the same one that\r\nGladys had {i.e. Mrs Leonard, who once had diphtheria). Etta\r\nsays everything was done for him that could be done, he evidently\r\ncouldn\u2019t be kept here.\r\nC. D. T. : So sad for them.\r\nFeda ; Oh, what does she mean ? She says he passed over with it. Explain that, Etta, will you ? Oh, all right\u2014Etta says, yes, she\r\n(14) feels he had diphtheria, but was his heart not strong ? Because\r\nit seemed to her that it was not just the throat trouble that killed\r\nhim, it seemed to her there was something which affected his\r\nheart apart from the diphtheria.\r\nC. D. T. : I have an idea that the two things sometimes go together.\r\n484 C. Drayton Thomas [part\r\nFeda ; Etta says, I don\u2019t think it was quite that. I wonder if he\r\nhad had something apart from the diphtheria, perhaps before the\r\ndiphtheria, that had been rather a strain on his heart, weakened\r\nhis heart in some way, so that the diphtheria was too much for it. Perhaps you can find that out. If it had not been for this condition of heart the diphtheria would not have been too much for\r\nhim. There was something that weakened his system before ; she\r\ngot a very strong feeling about that.\r\n[Mr Hatch writes : \u201c Yes, the illness started with tonsilitis, turned to quinsy, and no doubt these weakened the heart.\u201d\r\nApparently Etta meant more than this.]\r\nThird Sitting, December 2, 1932.\r\n(37) Feda ; Mr John says again he knows he is right about what he said,\r\nthat the people on earth might have put down about Bobbie\u2019s\r\nthroat and the diphtheria causing his passing, but there was\r\nsomething behind that, and, Mr John says, he feels certain he is right. There was something behind that condition ; he would\r\nnot have passed over with that condition alone, there was something before that.\r\n[Mr Hatch writes : \u201cWe know of nothing except the tonsilitis and\r\nquinsy which I have mentioned before \u201d. Note. In later sittings this elusive cause of a predisposition to infection is insisted upon and becomes an intriguing problem. Its final solution was reached during my visit to the house in the summer of 1933,\r\nas will be seen when we come to my account of that visit.]\r\n(38) Feda : Will you ask if there is anything they can trace to nine\r\nweeks before, something that at the time might not have seemed\r\nimportant ? Now, must be careful about this, nine weeks before\r\nBobbie passed over there was something that ought to have been\r\nvery significant in the face of his passing, something that, in a\r\nsense, led up to his passing, but not the weakening process that\r\nthey spoke of before ; it was not the something that weakened\r\nhim, but nine weeks before Bobbie passed over there was something happening, something very significant that had a link with\r\nhis passing. Well, if it had happened to anyone connected with\r\nyou, you would have immediately linked up the two happenings \u2014nine weeks before his passing and his actual passing.\r\nC!. D. T. : I suppose you could not put in one word what this is ? Feda : I will see if I can put in a nutshell what I feel about it. Wait a bit, \u201c pipes, pipes \u201d ; well, he says just this\u2014\u201c pipes \u201d. That word should be sufficient. Leave it like that.\r\nC. D. T. : Was it Bobbie who was telling you about this incident\r\nto do with pipes ? Feda : No, Mr John. He says, 1 asked Bobbie a few questions\r\nbefore the sitting that I thought might have a bearing on his\r\nearth life, and this was one of them.\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 485\r\n[Mr Hatch writes : \u201c We cannot trace this at all. Nine weeks before\r\nhis passing I took him to Morecambe for a very short holiday, but\r\nnothing of importance happened that I know of. The word \u2018 pipes\r\n\u2019\r\nconveys nothing to us.\u201d]\r\nIn subsequent sittings this subject is repeatedly touched upon, and\r\nthe word \u201c pipes \u201d became our term for it. Not until my visit to\r\nNelson, in June 1933, did we find any justification for the word. It was then, on learning that Bobbie had kept a diary, that I asked to\r\nsee it, and at once turned to the date nine weeks before his death in\r\norder to discover whether there might be anything relevant to the\r\nabove. My search was successful. The date, June 13, 1932, con- tained the statement, \u201c Had two ice creams \u201d\r\n; and at June 15 were the words, \u201c joined gang \u201d. The mention of ice creams suggested possible infection, and the second entry aroused curiosity.\r\nNine weeks before the boy\u2019s death on August 12 would be June 10,\r\nwhich is but a few days from the date on which he joined the gang.\r\nI inquired what was meant by the \u201c gang \u201d, and learnt that it was\r\na secret society formed by Bobbie and one or two of his boy friends ; they used to play at having adventures, and chose for the place a\r\nspot in the locality which I shall describe when giving an account of\r\nmy visit to Nelson. It is called The Heights. This spot was decided\r\nupon in March and used for play during the summer. The visit to\r\nMorecambe, which was for three days at the end of June, would seem\r\nto have no bearing on our quest.\r\nFourth Sitting, January 13, 1933.\r\n(70) Feda : Bobbie thinks all the time that there was something that\r\nwould be wrong with him first, that caused him to take it. C. D. T. : I don\u2019t think his family know of that.\r\nFeda : There was.\r\nC. D. T. : Is that what he thinks now ? Feda ; He does : he had been told there was something in his case which was making it easy not only for him to get it, but not to be\r\nable to throw it off when he did get it. [Mr Hatch : \u201c His tonsils were unhealthy : this may have caused\r\nhim to take it.\u201d]\r\nFeda ; 1 don\u2019t know what you mean, Bobbie, you say you got yours\r\nfrom the pipes.\r\nC. D. T. : That is curious, because my father said that previously\r\nand Bobbie\u2019s people can\u2019t find any connection with pipes.\r\nFeda : 1 think Bobbie is a very clear-minded boy, he seems very\r\nintelligent.\r\n[Mr Hatch replied to this : \u201c We don\u2019t know. 1 think it is very\r\nunlikely that Bobbie had heard of anyone catching the disease from\r\npipes.\u201d]\r\n486 C. Drayton Thomas [partFifth Sitting, January \"21\r\n,\r\n1933.\r\nC. D. T. : Etta, about the \u201c pipes Bobbie\u2019s people still can\u2019t\r\ntrace them. If Bobbie could tell them anything about the pipes it would be very interesting.\r\n(80) Feda : It was not in his home. It was not in a place where he wasregularly. There was a place that he went to, notfrom his home,but while he was in a second place he went to a third one, andthrough these\u2014what he calls pipes\u2014he picked up the condition\r\nwhich was not the cause of the trouble in the first place, but it introduced a destructive element which resulted in diphtheria.\r\n(81) Feda : You know I told you, didn\u2019t I, that there had been a wrongphysical condition of Bobbie\u2019s for some time before, not a goodcondition at all ; but he went somewhere, you see, not straight\r\nfrom his home, to this other place ; while he was at the second\r\nplace, outside his home, he went to a third place where the pipes were wrong, where he introduced into his system this poisonouscondition\u2014where he infected his system.\r\n[Here I must anticipate by giving the interpretation which was only\r\narrived at eight months later than the date of this sitting.\r\nMr Hatch wrote me on September 27, 1933, after we had discovered\r\nthe first pipe : \u201c He would go from the ruined hut, where we believe he\r\nplayed in the Delf, to the pipe which, as you will remember, was quite\r\napart in the open space beyond the Delf.\u201d The Delf would be the secondplace from which he went to the pipes.]\r\nC. D. T. : I wonder where they will be able to trace that place.\r\nFeda : He is trying to think. I think Bobbie is there. (Handpoints.)\r\nC. D. T. : There ? Oh, good, perhaps he can tell father.\r\n(82) Feda : He is getting this from him. I get a feeling wherever this\r\nplace was, of there being animals you call cattle. Mr John says,\r\nmake a point of this. I am quite sure of this ; yet his people maysay when they first read it that he never went to a place wherethere were such things. But he did. We know we are right in this\r\nmatter, and that if inquiries are quietly persisted in, it mayeventually come to light. Bobbie himself is wishful that this\r\nmight be so, and two or three friends of his who have passed over\r\nare also helping, so that, sooner or later, the matter will be brought\r\nto light in what will appear to be an accidental and yet natural manner.\r\n(83) Either before or after Bobbie caught it there\u2014we think after\r\nthere was something done to apparently improve matters with\r\nregard to those \u201c pipes There was something altered that\r\nprobably now has improved the condition, made it safer ; it wascertainly unsafe before.\r\n143] A Proxy Case 4S7\r\n\u201c A 2)lace he went to . . . pipes.\u201d As I have found it necessary to\r\nintroduce a reference to our final solution of the \u201c pipes \u201d problem,\r\nit may be well to give the complete story here. This was for long a\r\npuzzle to the family, as they knew of no place answering to this description. \u201c Cattle . . . his people may say ... he never went to a\r\nplace where there were such things.\u201d \u201c Before or after . . . there was something done to improve matters with regard to these pipes.\u201d\r\n\u201c The matter will be brought to light in what will appear to be an\r\naccidental and yet natural manner.\u201d\r\nNote how the above remarks fall into line with the following facts. On July 1, 1933, I visited \u201cthe Heights\u201d in company with the\r\nfamily. First we inspected the lower portions of the ground, and\r\nthen explored the disused and overgrown quarry, locally termed\r\n\u201c the Delf \u201d. On leaving this I noticed a shed somewhat higher up\r\nthe hill and near the road which bounds the area on its topmost side. On nearing this shed the ground showed marks of animals, and hay\r\nwas visible in the shed. We therefore examined this shed and found\r\nthat one end of it was used as a stable, and the other end had stores\r\nof hay and straw for bedding. One end was open, and this fact\r\nexcited interest, since one of the clues was \u201c an open end \u201d. Indeed,\r\nthis shed answered in several particulars to descriptions given in the\r\nsittings, as also did the surroundings. (All these points will be found\r\nin later sittings.) While we stood there a woman approached. I made some remark about the fine view ; she responded suitably, and\r\nwe entered into conversation. With the puzzle of the \u201c pipes \u201d still revolving in my mind I inquired whether she knew if children came\r\nto play in the quarry. She replied that they did, and that they sometimes made mischief, that among other misdeeds they had \u201c broken\r\nthe pipe \u201d. The mention of a pipe in connexion with this spot to\r\nwhich Bobbie\u2019s descriptions had led us, and wdiich we already knew\r\nanswered in several ways to those descriptions, inspired hope that\r\nwe were on the right track. Further inquiries elicited the information that there was a spring part-way down the hill, where water\r\nissued from a pipe. She added that they now had the town water\r\nlaid on, and so were not dependent upon the pipe. 1 gathered that\r\nthis alteration had been made some years before.\r\nWe then walked down the slope to see the spring. Water issued\r\nfrom the hillside by the side of the displaced pipe, an iron pipe\r\nseveral feet in length. Past this pipe the water trickled down the\r\nslope in a small channel of its own making.\r\nWe had discovered one pipe, and it was in the place to which the\r\nclues given in the sittings had led us. We saw no second pipe, and\r\nwhy the word was used in the plural we failed to guess. Our discovery of this pipe was entirely due to the meeting with our infor2 k\r\n488 C. Drayton Thomas [part2 nant. It is unlikely that we should have seen the spring and its pipebut for her remark ; for we had visited the same locality a few daysliefore and had not suspected its existence. The pipe is inconspicuously placed, and not visible until one goes quite near, being hiddenby the formation of the ground.\r\nA letter from Mr Hatch dated September 27, 1933, says : \u201c Sinceyour visit last June I have been to the Heights several times, andon one occasion I came across water running from another pipe in\r\nquite another direction from the first one, but nearly as close to theDelf\u2014it was about three minutes\u2019 walk from it. This pipe protrudesover a kind of trough filled with water, and is tucked away at theend of a footpath. Mr Burrows and I made the discovery.\u201d\r\nThus was the term \u201c the pipes \u201d, used by the communicators eversince December 2, 1932, found, in the following September, to bejustified by the discovery of two pipes situated in the immediatevicinity of the place frequented by Bobbie and his friend.\r\nHaving thus glanced at the end of the story, let us continue theJanuary 1933 sitting.\r\n(84) Feda : The animals will be the best clue. He understands fromBobbie\u2014 he says Bobbie seems to suggest to him that his parentswere not so familiar with this place, or did not go to it to the sameextent that he did.\r\n[\u201c Animals the best clue.\u201d Yes, it was the sight of animal trackswhich led us to examine the shed. \u201c Parents not familiar with this\r\nplace \u201d ; they had not seen it. Bobbie once brought his mother to viewthe Heights from the lower road, but, finding it would be some distance,\r\nand the weather being inclement, they returned home.]\r\n(85) Feda ; There was another boy mixed up in this, who went to this\r\nplace and seemed to be the reason for Bobbie going.\r\n[\u201d Another boy.\u201d Yes, \u201c the gang \u201d comprised Bobbie and his friendJack, and they had decided upon this place as their field of operations.\r\nA letter dated November 8, 1933, from Mr Hatch says : \u201c Did I tell you that I questioned Jack about the pipe that we first found on theHeights and he admitted that he and Bobbie played with the water ?\u201d]\r\nC. D. T. : I wonder what sort of a place it was and where ?\r\n(86) Feda : Wait a minute, I am getting a feeling of it not being quitea country place.\r\n[This is accurate.]\r\nC. D. T. : I wonder what Bobbie did when he was there ?\r\n(87) Feda : They are showing me places like stables now ; you knowwhat barns are, well, like barns and stables. I am getting strawin big bundles, I have got to call it a barn, with one side nearly, or all, open more like a shelter place.\r\nI-'k!. Ill, \u20141,\u2019atli to the Ukl t^uarry. now jiroteeted liy a railing.\r\nFlo. \u2014One of the Pipes.\r\nIt<\\,1\r\n143] ^4 Proxy Case 48!)\r\n(88) I don\u2019t seem to be quite in the country, there is so much\r\nbuilding round that it hides what country there may be.\r\nThe shed is a stable at one end and a store, or small barn, at the\r\nother. \u201c One side nearly or all open, more like a shelter place \u201d : an\r\nexact description. (See Fig. IV.) \u201c Building round hides what\r\ncountry there may be \u201d : there are buildings near which hide the\r\nview in two directions, yet there is an extensive view over Nelson\r\nand the country from the front of the barn. So the description is not strictly correct. One may hazard the guess, however, that\r\nBobbie was giving his recollection of the prospect as seen from\r\nwithin the Delf. From that position one sees nothing of the sur- rounding country, because the sides of the quarry and the building\r\nbomid the view all round.\r\nSitting\r\nco ntinued\r\n.\r\n(89) Feda : I must not say this is anything to do with it, but I hear\r\nwater running, as if big taps were turned on, and water trickling, as if it is running into a kind of gutter or drain. Like a swilling,\r\nthey are trying to make me say the word \u201c swdlling \u201d. [Mr Hatch did not understand this, but, assuming that it related in some way to the pipes, replied, \u201c We still cannot trace this matter of\r\nthe pipes. We will make further inquiries.\u201d]\r\nThese further inquiries were, how^ever, fruitless. It was not until three months after this sitting of January 13,\r\ni.e. in March 1933, that the family accidentally learnt the \"whereabouts of the gang\u2019s playground ; but only on July 1, 1933, was\r\nthe mystery solved by our discovering the first of the two pipes. It was then fine weather and the water was only \u201c trickling \u201d, but after\r\nheavy rains the sound would certainly convey the idea of \u201c swilling\r\nfor then the water comes out with a rush. It falls into a pool, which\r\noverflows into a kind of gutter which runs down the steep slope of\r\nthe hill.\r\nSixth Sitting, February 16, 1933.\r\nFeda : Bobbie says he is very pleased with the result of his messages, but there has been something that rather puzzled him.\r\nHe was puzzled because they could not make it out.\r\nC. D. T. : Woidd he like to make it easier for them by giving\r\nclues ? Feda : It was to do with what he calls \u201c the pipes \u201d.\r\nC. D. T. : I thought so. That is the most important point of all, and the one that has puzzled them most.\r\n490 C. Drayton Thomas [paetFeda ; He says, I know I am right about it ; and did he tell youbefore that the pipes were not at home ? [Mr Hatch replied to this : \u201c We are still very puzzled about the\r\nreferences to \u2018 the pipes\r\nC. D. T. : Isn\u2019t it a pity, Feda, that we can't get the name of the\r\nplace ? (Feda\u2019s f>art of the following dialogue is reproduced in her characteristic diction.)\r\n(96) Feda : I am getting a funny name, it sounds to Feda like Bentley.\r\nThis is what he calls a clue to it.\r\n(97) Bentley and Stoo, something. Stock, Stop, begins Stoo.\r\n(98) Feda : He is trying to show me\u2014make me feel\u2014a town, not a pretty town, it is full of streets, you know, streets full of ugly\r\njreople that does not know anything about Feda.\r\nC. D. T. : You mean ugly streets and houses, not people.\r\nFeda : No, ugly people, not the streets ; you see they doesn\u2019t knowanything about Feda, or about this subject.\r\nG. D. T. : \u201c But knowledge to their eyes her ample page.\r\nRich with the spoils of time did ne\u2019er unroll.\r\nChill penury repressed their nobler rage.\r\nAnd froze the genial current of their soul.\u201d\r\nFeda ; 1 should like to learn poetry. I don\u2019t think they have got\r\nmany \u201c spoils \u201d of anything, and they all goes miserable andlooking on the ground, and coughing and sneezing and being\r\nawful unhappy.\r\nC. D. T. : Did Bobbie tell you this ? Feda : Yes, and they are going down hill where shops is andhouses and they goes down this hill and they come to a cross road ; and I think there is a big station fhere ; because there is a bridge just down that turning.\r\nOne of the cross roads leads to a dark bridge where trains goes\r\nwhat you say \u201c expectorating \u201d like that, ch\u2014ch\u2014ch\u2014 andblowing out sparks and stuff. That is what a lady told me is right \u201c spectorating \u201d. And then if you does not turn down to where the trams is you go straight up a hill opposite you, and I see Bol)bie going up that hill, and 1 am following him up it, andhe is getting a little bit away from the town part, he is getting more towards houses and less shops and cleaner and less of the\r\npoor miserable people. It feels a bit brighter, you see, there.\r\nOh, now I am getting the name again that sounds like Ben or Bentley.\r\nMr Hatch\u2019s comments are given below. Enclosed with them wasa rough sketch which I have embodied in the lower part of the onehere shown (Plan 2).\r\n491 143] .4 Proxy Crise\r\n\u201c You will see l)y the enclosed sketch-niai) that the description ot the\r\ntown is quite a good one. The name Bentley is particularly good, as you\r\nwill notice that there is a Bentley Street near our house and adjoining\r\nFeb. 16th 1933 -\r\nBentley and Stock\r\ngiven as clues\r\n.\r\nDownhill and cross roads,\r\none of which leads to\r\na bridge.\r\nRailway and Station there\r\nAvoiding road to trains\r\nSo uphill to Bentley.\r\nQuarry\r\nFrom which the described route\r\nstarts. The line of dots shows the route round the railway station and uphill past Bentley\r\nStreet towards the Stocks and the Heights\r\n.\r\nBobbie\u2019s School. In the Churchyard higher up, mentioned before in the\r\nsittings, are the Stocks used long ago for ill-doers. But we can see no\r\nconnexion between these and the \u2018 pipes \u2019. It is true that it is cleaner\r\nand brighter as you go up the hill. \u201c It seems from this sitting, and from a previous one, that Bobbie went\r\nfrom School to the place where the pipes were. But, so far as our knowledge goes, the only place answering to this description is the Baths, and\r\nthis does not fit in with the account of a barn-like place, with hay, etc.\u201d\r\nThe solution was reached at a much later date, namely, on July 1,\r\n1933.\r\n492 C. Draylon Thomas [partThe effort for a name, Stoo, Stop, etc., once achieved \u201c Stock \u201d,\r\nwhich is almost Stocks. The Stocks are just inside the entrance ofthe Churchyard previously mentioned.\r\nI have marked the described route by a dotted line in the map.The description seems to start from Bobbie\u2019s home and, going downhill, takes left-hand turn to railway station and railway bridge ; turning back from the tram lines, which would be reached if oneshould proceed some yards further, it goes uphill past his home againin the direction of the Church, passing one end of Bentley Street,\r\nwhich Bobbie would specially remember, as his School was there.\r\nMr Hatch wrote on March 17, 1933, \u201c First with regard to theroute which you have traced on the map : It certainly does agreewith the description, and I agree that it seems to reveal an ultimateknowledge of the locality. It is somewhat puzzling to understandwhy this particular route should have been described.\u201d\r\nSixth Sitting continued.\r\n(99) Feda ; There is somebody there called \u201c Phil \u201d, it sounds to Pedalike Phil. Will you tell them that the name Phil is a clue ? (100) Feda : There was a boy called Peter who knew this place too. Bobbie is not quite sure whether his real name was Peter, butthey called him Peter. And, wait a bit, and another boy whosename sounds like Eric or Alec.\r\nMr Hatch, in referring to the above, wrote, \u201c We are trying to\r\ntrace the names Peter, Alec or Eric, but have not succeeded yet,\r\nalso Phil.\u201d\r\nBobbie often talked of his school companions, but the names of\r\nmany of these are not remembered by the family.\r\nIn the above-quoted letter of March 17, 1933, Mr Hatch said : \u201c With regard to references to the \u2018 pipes \u2019 I may say that we seemat last to be on the track of what has been insisted upon so fre- quently. The references seem to point to a place which had beenvisited by Bobbie and a boy friend, and by them only. Neither his\r\nmother nor I had ever been there. Perhaps I had better not say\r\nmore at present as some more information may come through. Wecannot trace the names of his friends that were given. Do you think\r\nit will be possible to get any further information about Bobbie\u2019s\r\nvisits to the place where the \u2018 pipes \u2019 were ? \u201d The family tell me that, in view of this possibility, they thought\r\nit better not to question Bobbie\u2019s friend Jack, but to see if Bobbie\r\ncould solve the mystery himself.\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 493\r\nEighth Sitting, March 24, 1933.\r\n(107) Feda ; Etta says 1 am perfectly certain that they will verify the\r\nevidence about the pipes.\r\nC. D. T. ; 1 would like you to give them all the help you can\r\nbecause it would be such a good point.\r\nFeda : She says, a very good evidential point indeed. And,\r\nbearing that in mind, will you write and ask them not to tell you anything they discover until we have given you a little more about it ? in case they should write and tell you something\r\nthat we might be just waiting to give you.\r\nNinth Sitting, April 10, 1933.\r\n(Early in the sitting came the following dialogue :) C. D. T. ; I want to ask about little Bobbie, have they heard anything more about him ? Feda : Would you like them to get any more about him ? C. D. T. : Well, it was all very interesting, and I think it would be\r\nworth while getting more. 1 am eager that his people should\r\nfind out about those pipes ; if 1 could help them to do that we\r\nmight finish the case, but we can\u2019t really finish the case until\r\nthey have found out about the pipes.\r\nFeda ; Mr John thinks they are on the track.\r\n(Later in this sitting the subject was continued thus :)\r\n(108) Feda : Something has just come to Mr John\u2019s mind about Bobbie,\r\nhe wondered whether he had given it before. Has Bobbie ever\r\nsaid anything at the sittings about a brook or inland water ? It seems to be some special piece of water, and he would often go\r\nto a place situated close to this water, it almost feels like swampy\r\nto Feda.\r\nC. D. T. : That was mentioned once, but not a brook, merely a\r\nlittle place near a stile where water was. (See No. 45.)\r\nFeda ; No, it is not to do with that either, another place alto- gether. It is rather important to him, as if he did something\r\nrather special there.\r\nMr Hatch replied to this, \u201c The reference to a brook or inland\r\nwater might mean a boating pool which he liked to visit, but the\r\nswampy condition is incorrect.\u201d\r\nOn my visit to Nelson in June 1933 it was explained that on this\r\nboating pool in Thompson\u2019s Park Bobbie used to row in the canoes. On July 1 I paid my second visit, during which we found the first of the pipes on Marsden Heights. It was w\u2019hen reconsidering this\r\nparagraph (108) after that visit that I noticed how perfectly it applied to the place where w*e saw water issuing from the pipe.\r\n(See Fig. V.) The water made a small pool and swampy area around\r\n494 C. Drayton Thomas [partthe spot where it issued from the hill. If this w^as a reference to the\r\n\u201c pipe \u201d place it would be specially relevant in view of my request\r\nearly in this sitting, and conversation about Bobbie\u2019s people being on the track of the place. I incline, therefore, to think that this\r\nalludes to the place where \u201c the gang \u201d used to play and where welater discovered the pipe.\r\nTenth Sitting, May 19, 1933.\r\n(115) Feda : Now, look, he wanted to say that he thought that they were\r\non the track of what he spoke about, the trouble he spoke about,\r\nthat had a connexion with his passing.\r\n0. D. T. : Can you help them any more about it ? I have notheard whether they have found it or not. Feda : Well, now, he says this, that they were on the right track,\r\nbut there has been a difficulty, they have been held up in their\r\ninvestigations. Bobbie has been expecting this, and he is not\r\ndisappointed about it, because he felt it was going to be difficult,\r\nhe felt there would be obstacles in the way of proving it, or bringing it to light. You see, there are two different bodies of\r\npeople to contend with. He says they know what I am talking\r\nabout, two different bodies, and neither of them would make it easy, but one might make it easier than the other.\r\n[Mr Hatch wrote : \u201c PerhajDS we had better leave this till we can talk\r\nit over with you ; there is a strange confusion with parts very correct. The mystery might have been already solved by this time, for anything I knew to the contrary ; but Bobbie seems to have been aware ofthe progress of events.\r\n\u201c Two ... to contend with \u201d, the family interpret this as meaningthat they were divided as to the places meant, which was indeed the fact at the date of this sitting.]\r\n(116) Feda : \u201c Underground \u201d, something to do with taking up ground,underground. I don\u2019t know what he means, but this is what hesays ; he can\u2019t hel]) them very much more about this just now.[This is vague, but may possibly have been an endeavour to indicate\r\nthe spot where we eventually found the pipe and a small stream issuing\r\nfrom the ground.]\r\n(117) C. D. T. : Bobbie, I am going there in about a month\u2019s time ; if\r\nI wanted to go to the place where the pipes are, and wished to\r\nstart from the Railway Station\u2014 do you know what I shoulddo ? I should walk up the hill past your house ; and when pastyour house and a little uphill, what ought I to do then ? Is thatthe right direction ? Feda : Yes, and there is another way to it, past the school. Hesays, I should think past the house and keep straight on.\r\nC. D. T. ; Yes, and what am I to look out for ? Would the placebe on the main road or should I have to turn somewhere ?\r\n143] ^4 Proxy Case 4it5\r\n(118) l^EDA : It seems to i)e on the right. I don\u2019t think it is very far\r\nfrom the main road, I think it is on it. [My question was based upon the sketch map sent by Mr Hatch to\r\nillustrate a previous sitting. I aimed to provide Bobbie with a starting\r\npoint from which he might describe the route to the pipes. It so happened that my suggested route was c[uite in order, for that is one way\r\nto Marsden Heights.\r\n\u201c Another way past the school \u201d ; this is correct. \u201c Turn right \u201d ; correct.

Drayton Thomas [part(119) Ff:i)A : On that main road he shows me it goes uphill, all the wayalmost, not just a little bit of a hill. Now for a good distanceis it more open on the left than right 1 You see a main road,and yet I feel spaces. It is not all built on, there are lots ofbuildings, but lots of spaces as well. He says there are still some sjraces. The whole of that main road is rather a mixture.This main road at one time was not much built on, and it hasbeen much built on lately, like a mixture of space and newbuildings.\r\nC. D.

D. T. : Don\u2019t you mean the Baths, Bobbie ? Feda : He does, it was connected with and mixed up with the bathssomehow.\r\nC. D. T. : Is it within the same walls, under the same roof ?\r\n(121) Feda : Isn\u2019t it a nuisance I can\u2019t quite get that ? Don\u2019t ask himthat, I think there is something he is trying to get. I have gotto be awful sure about this\u2014the place that he would go in thedoorway\u2014because it is on the corner of the side road, and I getthe feeling that often he would go a bit down the side road toget to the j)lace where he went.\r\nIt seems clear now that, at this point, I introduced much confusionby assuming that the letter \u2018 B \u2019 stood for the Baths ; for Fedaaccepted my idea and referred to it as the Baths under the impressionthat Baths was the correct name. My second question about being under a roof evidently puzzledand confused, and f|uite naturally so, if I am right in my surmisethat the boy w'as describing an out-of-door place. \u201c Doorway at corner of side road \u201d\r\n; the gateway into the Heightsis at the left corner at the top of the short, blind road. Bobbie wouldgo through it to get to the gang\u2019s playing spot near the water pipe inthe hill side.\r\nSitting continued.\r\nC. D. T. : I want to ask him if he had been drinking the water atthe Baths.\r\n143] .4 Proxy Case 497\r\n(122)\r\nFeda : He knows what he had been told it is. He has been told\r\nthat this was the cause of it. You know what he would call the\r\nbaths\u2014I am letting him say what he wants to, because you can\r\nsee if he is accurate\u2014He says he thinks what he remembers is that a part of this building is not quite the same. You puzzled\r\nhim a bit asking whether it was near the building, because it was not all built at the same time, there was something that\r\nhad to be built on afterwards. When it was thought to be all complete there was something added to it, quite a good big\r\nportion.\r\n\u201c You know what he would call the baths \u201d\r\n; here Feda accepts\r\nmy term for the place in question and alludes to it as \u201c the baths \u201d. We must, however, keep in mind the probability that what Feda and\r\nI are terming \u201c the Baths \u201d is really the place which Bobbie and my\r\ncommunicators call \u201c the pipes \u201d or \u201c B \u201d. Let us see if what follows\r\nwill apply to the latter place ; for it certainly does not apply to the\r\nBaths.\r\n\u201c You puzzled him . . . something built on afterwards.\u201d This\r\naddition to a building correctly describes the shed or barn by the\r\nDelf : this erection shows clear evidence of having been added to\r\nfrom time to time. It is a home-made structure of wood and corru- gated iron put together as need arose. It is quite likely that an\r\nobservant boy would have noticed these additions.\r\nSitting continued.\r\n(123) Feda : Is there a district there that begins with the letter \u2018 H\r\n\u2019\r\nnear the baths, a longish name ? He calls it the district. C. D. T. ; I\u2019ll inquire.\r\n(124) Feda : You see, he knew somebody living in the \u2018 H \u2019 part that\r\nused to go to the same place.\r\n[The Marsden Heights were always called by Bobbie \u201c The Heights \u201d. Who is meant by \u201c somebody \u201d is uncertain. There are alternative\r\nexplanations.]\r\n(125) Feda : Look, you have been going up hill, haven\u2019t you ; suppose\r\nyou were to go down to the right, like a side way, when you have\r\ngone up a hill, you wouldn\u2019t go very far to the right before you come to a place that was\u2014There are no cliffs there, are there ?\r\n\r\nhe is trying to make me feel such a peculiar place, it feels to me\r\nalmost like a drop, a kind of abrupt drop down, not an ordinary\r\nhill. And as if there is still some evidence of it being there, but\r\nnot quite as it was.\r\nThe above correctly describes a road to the right, after one has\r\ncome uphill from Bobbie\u2019s house, and a walk by the quarry alluded\r\nto in a previous sitting (Cf. Nos. 41-44). \u201c Not c^uite as it was \u201d\r\n;\r\n498 C\\ Drayton Tkonuis [partin Bobbie\u2019s time a stile separated this walk by the quarry from theside road. The stile has since been removed, and jjrotective railings\r\nnow separate the path from the abrupt edge of the quarry. The sidesof the quarry are like cliffs.\r\nSitting eontimied.\r\n(126) Feda : And you can get to that place by walking up the hill andturning to the right near the baths ; not, perhaps, the best way,but you could get so.

Drayton Thom,as [partPART III\r\nBefore proceeding to discuss the significance of the foregoingmessages it may be convenient to notice in brief summary how theevidence accumulated month by month from November 1932 to\r\nMay 1933.\r\nIn November, December and January we find Etta, John, andfinally Bobbie himself expressing the opinion that Bobbie\u2019s illness could be traced to something connected with pi]>es. (14, 37, 38, 70.)\r\nAn event nine weeks before death will be a clue. (38.)\r\nIn January my request for further clues brought the informationthat these pipes were not at the boy\u2019s home ; that animals woidd bea guide to their position ; that Bobbie\u2019s people did not know of the])lace, but that he went there with another boy. As a further clue\r\nthere was described a barn or stables. (80, 82, 84, 85, 87.)\r\nIn February the route leading to these pipes was described in\r\npart. (96, 98.)\r\nIn March Etta expressed certainty that the pipes would betliscovexed. (107.)\r\nIn May Bobbie gave directions pointing to the exact locality\r\nwhere the pipes were eventually found. (117, 118, 119, 120, 123,\r\n126.)\r\nIn Jidy the first of the two pipes was discovered and the secondin September.\r\nNo maps of Nelson were to be had, either in guide-book or local\r\ndirectory, and it was not until these sittings were over and the pipesfound that I ins|)ected ordnance survey maps, both the large scale\r\nand the small. I found springs indicated, but no mention of pipes.\r\nMy knowledge of Nelson was restricted to the fact of its being a manufacturing town, united with others in a valley, and that thesurrounding country was hilly. Mrs Leonard was told nothingwhatever aljout the subject of these sittings, nor did I mention thej)lace to Feda.\r\nWe have seen that the information given about the existence andwhereabouts of these pipes was correct. Let us now consider whetherthere was justification for the opinion, so confidently expressed, thatBobbie\u2019s death might be attributed to the pipes.\r\nThe water issuing from the hillside is pure, but it falls into pools, one of which is on the open hillside where it would be visited by wildbirds, poultry and animals.\r\nAt my request the Brierfield Medical Ofticer of Health, Dr J.\r\n143] A Proxy Case 501\r\nStrachan Wilson, M.B., C.M., visited the place. He afterwards sent\r\nme the following report ; Town Brierfield,\r\nLancashire, February 21, 1934.\r\nDear Sir,\r\nYour letter of the 10th instant, re springs on Marsden Heights,\r\nto hand.\r\nMr Haigh, the Sanitary Ins]jector, and myself visited the two springs\r\nyou mention. The water in both pools is obviously liable to contamination from surface water and is not fit for drinking purposes. Any\r\nperson, child or adult, might develop a low or even an acute infection\r\nfrom the drinking of such water.\r\nWe have had samjiles of the water issuing from the hillside, in both\r\ncases, analysed, and the analysis shows that the water from both sources\r\nis suitable for drinking.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nJ. S. Wilson,\r\nMedical Officer of Health.\r\nThat verdict about the pools into which the pipe water falls is decisive. We are certain that Bobbie frequently played by this water\r\nduring several weeks ; then came an illness which, beginning with\r\ntonsilitis, turned to quinsy and then to the diphtheria which over- came him.\r\nThe accompanying photograph of the pipe and pool nearest to the\r\nDelf shows how close is the surface of the water to the mouth of the\r\npipe. The fall is only two inches. Bobbie\u2019s friend, Jack, says that\r\nthey \u201c played with the water \u201d. A boy who was playing with water\r\nas it issued from the jiipe could scarcely avoid wetting his hands in\r\nthe contaminated pool below. Those wet hands might easily convey\r\ninfection to the mouth, either by wiping on handkerchief or by\r\ncupping them for a mouthful of water from the pipe. Bobbie lived\r\nin a healthy part of Nelson and there were, as I am informed by the\r\nlocal Medical Officers of Health, only two other cases of diphtheria in\r\nNelson at that time, and four in the Brierfield area. There our definite information ends.\r\nThe communicators may or may not have been correct in con- cluding that Bobbie\u2019s death was caused directly or indirectly by his\r\nplaying with this water. We cannot be certain, nor would the proved\r\ntruth or error of their opinion affect the evidence that they were in\r\npossession of facts on which such a conjecture might reasonably be\r\nbased. These facts were : the existence and locality of the pipes, the\r\npool into which the water discharged, the frequenting of this place\r\nby the boys and their playing with the water. Anyone acquainted\r\nwith these facts might have suspected that the throat affection\r\nC. Drayton Thmnas [partwliich followed was traceable to tbe contaminated water. But no oneon earth had the least suspicion of this until it was stated in the courseof these sittings.\r\nWhat makes the incident really remarkable from the evidential\r\npoint of view is that the members of Bobbie\u2019s family were entirely\r\nignorant of the facts, and that the only person acquainted with them,be,sides Bobbie himself, was his companion Jack\u2014certainly a mostunpromising and unlikely source of telepathic information on thesubject. Yet the existence of this water was asserted and reassertedduring a period of six months, and the pipes were finally discoveredby our following up the clues given.\r\nWhence, then, came the knowledge so clearly displayed ? Was it from minds on earth ? Doubtless many persons were aware of those])ipes on the Heights ; yet it is certain that not one among them eversuspected that I was taking .sittings on behalf of Bobbie\u2019s family.\r\nThat fact was private to the few persons in Bobbie\u2019s group. Theonly others who knew, namely, my stenographer, my wife and I, were unaware of the exi.stence of the Heights. No one person knewboth facts, viz. that the pipes existed, and that I was inquiringabout Bobbie. Whence, then, came the information ? It is a])roblem which I commend to the attention of those who may hesitate to share my conviction that Bobbie Newlove and his friends in\r\nthe Beyond gave the mes,sages.\r\nTelepathy from minds on earth is regarded by some as an alternative hypothesis to communication from the departed.\r\nThere is little to be said for it. We have no record of long andfletailed messages being conveyed from one person to another bytelepathy. Whether spontaneous or experimental, telepathy is always fragmentary.\r\nConsider our .story of the pipes. There were no people on earthwho knew the two facts which are so emjrhatically and continuouslyinterwoven in the sittings, viz. (1 ) that Bobbie played with the wateron the Heights, and (2) that I was trying to get from him messagesfor his people. These two facts were, however, known to some veryacute intelligence somewhere, who made use of them during a period\r\nof six months in face of incredulity by Bobbie\u2019s people and ourfailure to understand.\r\nThis knowledge about the ])ipes\u2014which proved to be accurate\r\ncould not have come by telej^athy from Bobbie\u2019s home circle, becauseno one there was aware of the existence of the pipes. Members ofthe \u201c gang \u201d, on the other hand, would have no idea that Bobbiehurt himself by playing with the water, nor of the fact that I wasseeking to obtain messages from him.\r\nCritics who wash to apply the telepathic hypothesis to this case\r\n1431 A Proxy Case 503\r\nwill need to assume, without any justification for such an assumption,\r\nthat thoughts pass between people who have not heard of each other\r\nand between whom there is no link save that they were interested\r\nin a person who died. And further, the selection must be assumed\r\nto act with unerring discretion, so that no facts are allowed to pass\r\nwhich do not relate to the inquiry in hand. In short, everything vnust happen exactly as if an intelligent supervisor were obtaining information from the deceased for the purposes of the inquiry.\r\nExamination of Bobbie\u2019s Failures.\r\nAbbreviations used.\r\nN.

Steep and awkward place about which complaints made.\r\nPlace near the above with name like Cattle.\r\nThe proportion of success banishes any doubt based upon the\r\npossibility of chance coincidence. Fraud or collusion is quite out of\r\nthe question.\r\nMuch of the evidence given was exactly such as we should expect\r\nfrom a little boy ; it relates to his treasured possessions, his special\r\ninterests in the home or elsewhere, his games, the local Gala and the\r\nannual Fair with its swings and racing track. It includes correct\r\ndescriptions of streets and roads around his home, even mentioning\r\nthe street which must have been specially familiar to him because\r\nhis school was there.\r\nThe replies to questions sent by Bobbie\u2019s people show intimate\r\nknowledge of the boy\u2019s interests both within the house and else- where.\r\nIn response to my persistent inquiry as to the whereabouts of the\r\npipes, there was given a mass of information which was finally found\r\nto be correct, although much of it was entirely imknown to Bobbie\u2019s\r\nrelatives. Above all, there emerged in the course of the sittings a\r\nsuggestion which had never occurred to anyone, and which related to\r\nthe probable cause of the child\u2019s death. Investigations following up\r\nthe clues given have shown the extreme probability that the communicators were right in their surmise, and that the boy\u2019s system was injuriously affected through his playing with contaminated\r\nwater in a place of which his people knew nothing\u2014and of the\r\nexistence of which they remained sceptical for a period of six months.\r\nThis is conclusive evidence that the messages did not emanate from\r\nminds on earth ; for no one who knew of those pipes had the least\r\nsuspicion that I was receiving messages relating to Bobbie Newlove,\r\nor, indeed, of my existence. On the other hand, I had not the least\r\nknowledge of the Marsden Heights or that Bobbie had played at any\r\nplace where there was contaminated water. My knowledge of\r\nBobbie and his home was hmited to what his people wrote in com-\r\n508 C. Drayton Thomas [part\r\nmeriting upon each sitting as the records reached them. What they\r\nwrote has been stated under its respective dates, and it will be\r\nobserved that I was told nothing which could have enabled me to\r\nelaborate the messages, even had I been sufficiently unprincipled to\r\nwish to do so. We have, therefore, a feature which is probably unique in the\r\nrecords of psychical research. It is this surprising expression,\r\ndefinite, emphatic and repeated, of an opinion which had no exist- ence in the thought of any person on earth previous to its emergence\r\nat these sittings. No clairvoyant inspection of the Marsden Heights\r\nwould afford the medium information as to the reason why the boy\u2019s\r\nillness should have ended fatally ; leakage from human minds andthe supernormal acquisition of information by the medium\u2019s unaided\r\nfaculty are both ruled out by the circumstances of the case.\r\nIs there any alternative but to recognise the activity of extramundane intelligence, one which knew facts which were unknown to\r\nthe family at Nelson, and which based on those facts a conclusion\r\nwhich is highly probable if not demonstrably correct ?\r\n143 ] A Proxy Ca^se 50!>\r\nPART IV\r\nTHE MODUS OPERANDI AND INSIGHT INTO\r\nTELEPATHY\r\nIn the foregoing series of trance messages we have found varying\r\ndegrees of success and failure. We may profitably study a few of\r\nthese with the hope of learning something about telepathic reception.\r\nThe immediate receiver is the Leonard-Feda combination, and my\r\nview is that Feda first receives and then causes it to be voiced by\r\nMrs Leonard\u2019s mind-brain-nerve-muscle mechanism. It is not\r\nnecessary to hold that hypothesis ; others may serve our immediate\r\npurposes, which is simply to note how the receiver \u201c feels \u201d when the\r\ninformation comes into consciousness. Some may like to think that\r\nthe information has first arrived telejjathically in the sitter\u2019s subconscious mind, and that Feda perceives it there ; but, even so, Feda\r\nmust receive or obtain it from the sitter. We want to know how\r\ninformation arrives.\r\nThose who deem that a Control is but a secondary personality of\r\nthe medium have the same problem to solve. How does the idea\r\nreach the medium\u2019s consciousness, whether the primary or the\r\nsecondary consciousness ? How is the thought received ? When Feda said, \u201c Is there a place with an address on \u2018 B \u2019 ? He\r\nis trying to write it up on a board \u201d (see 120), what was actually\r\nhappening ? It may be guessed that someone changed the method,\r\nas if hoping thereby to convey the required idea ; if the sense of\r\nsoimd did not respond, the sense of sight might do so. But how is that switching from sound to sight accomplished ? Is it by effort of\r\nthe communicator ? or does Feda shift the mechanism of reception?\r\nWe find her, at times, saying that they are mahitig her feel so-andso, or that what is being described gives her the feeling thus and thus : often she will seem to quote verbatim, then presently to fall back on\r\nparaphrase. Do these variations indicate different forms which the\r\nidea takes on reaching Feda\u2019s consciousness, or do they denote\r\ndifferences in the manner by which thought is sent to her ? Is it Feda or the communicator who decides the form ? Naturally, I have asked Feda, and the reply is, in essence, that she\r\ntries one method and then another, but cannot use them simultaneously. That looks as if she can to some extent choose the form\r\nin which the ideas reach her consciousness, but I doubt if that is the\r\nwhole secret. The following dialogue with Feda bears upon this question.\r\n510 C. Drayton Thomas [part\r\nC. D. T. : Sometimes for minutes on end you seem to get their very\r\nwords. I wonder what it is that makes that possible.\r\nFeda : Mr John says, \u201c We find at one sitting that we can go on the\r\ndictation method, and at another we have to make pictures\r\nwithout dictation, and these we transfer, or we assist Feda in\r\ntransferring, to the brain of the medium. Whether we shall do\r\nthe first method or the second method it is not in our power to determine. We have to accommodate ourselves to your conditions. I am inclined to think\u2014and I have exchanged ideas\r\nwith many serious investigators and we are all agreed\u2014that it\r\nis nothing whatever to do with our ability to communicate ; except, as I once remarked to you, some of us have a temperament\r\nthat fits us for communicating more than others.\u201d\r\nC. D. T. : That I can understand.\r\nFeda : Mr John says, \u201c On many occasions I have come here prepared\r\nto dictate to Feda ; and I have thought, \u2018 Now the material\r\nI have in hand to-day needs the dictation method \u2019, but I find\r\nmyself unable to dictate. I find a condition which makes it advisable to switch over to some other topic, unless the material\r\nI have in hand could be shown pictorially. It is limiting\u2014it holds us up.\u201d\r\nC. D. T. ; Have you noticed, Feda, what previous condition is best for a sitting that is to have much dictation in it ? Feda : Yes, I have noticed. If Gladys (Mrs Leonard\u2019s name) has not\r\nbeen writing letters, or thinking about letters, or reading letters that the postman brought, and she has been just thinking of\r\nnothing at all that morning\u2014especially to do with words\u2014then\r\nI get the dictation well. But if she does letters she thinks all the\r\ntime, \u201c This person needs to know so-so, and even if I don\u2019t write\r\nnow this person wants me to say so-so \u201d. Now that isn\u2019t good\r\nfor the conditions. She has worn herself out a bit about words,\r\nyou see. C. D. T. ; Is it that you don\u2019t, then, hear the words plainly ? Feda : Well, I think it is that I can\u2019t get them, can\u2019t catch them in her\r\nmind because her mind is tired of them, her mind has already hadenough of words.\r\nC. D. T. : You don\u2019t find the dictated sentences are there for you ? Feda : No. Etta says I am convinced that an area of the conscious\r\nmind, or that part of the brain in which the conscious mind works,\r\nhas over it a kind of sensitised material like\u2014let us say\u2014wax,\r\nand if it has been used for one thing it won\u2019t take another impression.\r\nC. D. T. : Like the sensitised gelatine of a photographic plate ? Feda : Yes, but at the same time you can\u2019t very well make that into an\r\nanalogy, because we sometimes can get something else on that is very good. The \u201c wax \u201d will take something else, but it won\u2019t\r\ntake what it has already been used for. Now that is what Etta\r\nsays, and she is right. If you take Gladys of a morning when she\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 51 1\r\nhasn\u2019t been worried or done letters but is just ready for a trance,\r\nthat\u2019s a very good dictation time.\r\nThe reference to a broken stile, see No. 40, is peculiarly interesting\r\nbecause, although the broken stile was there during Bobbie\u2019s lifetime,\r\nit had been removed before the date of this sitting.\r\nClearly, then, the description was given from the memory of one who had known the place in Bobbie\u2019s lifetime, and not from any\r\nclairvoyance of medium or Control : the latter hypothesis would\r\ninvolve the difficulty of having to suggest how clairvoyance could\r\nbe directed to the right town, and then be able to trace, amidst its many scores of streets and paths, the particular route which had\r\nbeen a favourite walk of the family.\r\nThere have been many occasions when proper names were pronounced easily and correctly. The conditions of which Feda has\r\nbeen speaking were then, presumably, at their best ; but I find that\r\nnames usually present a difficulty.\r\nAn attempt to give the name Callow Bottoms illustrates this. It was at the end of a description of the neighbourhood in which he had\r\nlived that Feda, speaking for Bobbie, said :\r\n(140) Feda : \u201c There is a place \u2018 C \u2019 close by, a long name sounding like Catelnow, Castlenow. There seemed to be two or three syllables,\r\nlike a Ca sound, cattle or castle something.\u201d\r\nThe family comment was : \u201c The name given is like Catlow, a hamlet near here. Bobbie and I went there the day he was taken\r\nill, the last occasion that he left the house.\u201d Wdien studying Bobbie\u2019s\r\ndiary I noticed that almost the very last entry read\u2014\u201c Went to\r\nCatlow Bottoms. Sore throat. Went to bed.\u201d\r\nRemove two letters from Catelnow and we have Catlow.\r\nFeda can sometimes give a name without difficulty, but should\r\nthere be any hitch, necessitating a second or third try, it is rarely\r\nshe achieves success. Her explanation is that, even when she hears\r\nthe name clearly, anxiety to get it voiced affects the medium\u2019s brain,\r\ncausing a tension which hinders expression of the required word.\r\nBut often Feda cannot hear the name distinctly.\r\nOn referring to section 19-20 we find three initials given in lieu of\r\nthe full names. These initials were entirely appropriate to the\r\ncontext, but Feda\u2019s ignorance of the names which they represented\r\nmay be inferred from the remark, \u201c Does the girl\u2019s name begin with\r\n\u2018 J\r\n\u2019 ? \u201d Now the name was Jack ; as Feda was unaware of the sex\r\nit is evident that she had not heard the name clearly. This error remmds one of her remark, \u201c Some of the thmgs I have got for them\r\n512 C. Drayton Thomas [partI don\u2019t understand, and just a little bit of a twist would give them awrong meaning.\u201d\r\nIn this connexion we may refer to section 75, where Feda re- marked \u201c \u2018 M \u2019 I think that would be the man\u2019s name Whetherthat was a guess or an inference, it was wrong ? Feda apparentlydid not catch the name itself, but only the initial. Yet there havebeen occasions when it was quite evident that the actual name wasknown, whether to Feda or to the communicator, and yet could notbe pronounced by the medium.\r\nLet us pass to a further point. It would appear that Feda is sometimes unaware that reference is being made to an objectpreviously described. The following seem to be illustrations of this : A few weeks before Bobbie\u2019s death he had a short holiday atMorecambe, where, at some children\u2019s sports, he won a salt-sifter ofglazed earthenware shaped like a dog. It was usually kept on thecorner of a shelf in the dining-room, and at dinner Bobbie had ahabit of rolhng it along the table and twisting and untwisting thecork at the bottom. In general appearance it is round, smooth andpolished. Note how curiously the reference to this article is introduced.\r\n(54) Feda : \u201c You must not take it off the shelf, you must leave it onthe shelf near the corner.\u201d Leave it on the shelf where the otherscould see it and have it. He used to take it sometimes\u2014I thinkI have got this right\u2014there was something that used to be on thecorner of the shelf, and sometimes Bobbie wanted it, and theyused to say, \u201c Leave it on the shelf in case the others want it \u2014Something round and smooth and polished.\r\nC. D. T. ; I wonder what he did with it when he took it in hishands.\r\nFeda ; Was it a watch ? C. D. T. : Are you guessing, Feda ? Feda : I was only asking him, because it looked like a watch hewas holding in the palm of his hand.\r\nC. D. T. : What does he say ? Feda : He seems to be twisting something like you do a watch ora clock.\r\nC. D. T. : Winding it 1 Feda : Yes, winding something.\r\nC. D. T. : Is it Bobbie showing this ? Feda : It is Bobbie giving it to me. It feels something like a watch.C. D. T. : It looks like a selected bit of evidence, but it just lacksthe definite indication. I could think of at least four things.\r\nFeda : You had better not guess. He rolls it or winds it. It wasnot a watch. They still have it. It is not in that place, it hasbeen put somewhere else. Bobbie thinks it has been put in a\r\n143 ] J Proxy Case 513\r\ndrawer instead of on the shelf. Is it on a plate ? He is giving me\r\nthe idea of a plate being near it.\r\nThe family recognised this as referring to the salt-sifter and in- formed me that it had been moved, but not into a di-awer, and that\r\nit was now kept on a shelf just below the dinner plates.\r\nAt a later sitting this salt-sifter (if my supposition is correct) was\r\nagam indicated.\r\n(56) Feda : Had Bobbie a duck ? I will tell you what he is showing\r\nme ; it looks something hke a duck. Will you ask if he had a toy duck ? I think that is right. I see it in his hand like as if he is pushing it towards me. I don\u2019t think its legs is very long, or else he is holding his legs up a bit, but ducks have not got very\r\nlong legs. I think it must be a duck because of its legs.\r\nThen Feda dropped the subject and, after some minutes of talk on\r\nother matters, suddenly commenced to speak again about what I believe to be the same object, although it is very doubtful whether\r\nFeda was aware that this was an attempt to make up for the previous\r\nfailure.\r\n(61) Feda : Not the name Bobbie, but another name beginning with\r\n\u2018 B \u2019 that was rather important in their house. I mustn\u2019t say\r\nsound because I am getting this by feeling. He gives \u2018 B \u2019 by\r\nsound, but now I get the feeling that this would seem to be more\r\nlike an animal\u2019s name, or the name of a toy. It is something in\r\ntheir house that he was very fond of, and he calls it a funny name\r\nbeginning with \u2018 B \u2019, not a long name. Wait a bit\u2014Ber, Bunkey,\r\nBussey. The name he is giving me sounds as if it began Bus or Bos.\r\nSince it is said to be an animal\u2019s or toy\u2019s name which begins with\r\n\u2018 B \u2019 it seems highly probable that Bobbie was tr}dng to describe the\r\nsalt-sifter which he won at Morecambe so shortly before his death\r\nand which he greatly prized, always calhng it his Bow-wow. The\r\nname Bow-wow agrees with the description, \u201c begmning with \u2018 B\r\n\u2019 and not long \u201d. If this assumption be correct it further illustrates\r\nhow imrehable Feda\u2019s clairaudience can be, for she said it sounded\r\nto her like Ber, or Bunkey, or Bussey, a name begmning Bus or Bos.\r\nBobbie had spoken of his mother and a cap of which she had been\r\nthinking, and went on to say (through Feda) :\r\n(112) \u201c She came across something with a special badge on it. It is not\r\na heart exactly, but the lower part is shaped rather like a heart,\r\nat the bottom it is heart-shaped. It is something like a straight\r\nline goes through the top of it and a little upstanding piece comes\r\nout of the top.\u201d\r\n514 C. Drayton Thomas [partThe reference to a cap may have been intended to lead up to a|;mention of his Jack of Hearts crown (Cf. 35), or it may perhaps havejsuddenly brought the latter to Bobbie\u2019s mind, but the phrasing con-|fuses the heart with the crown op which it is fixed. \u201c Not a heartfexactly \u201d would be true of the crown. The rest of the description is i|accurate as apphed to the heart itself, but misleading on account ofibeing preceded by the words, \u201c the lower part is shaped rather likeija heart.\u201d It is not surprising that the family reported they knew of!lno such badge.\r\nOn my visit to the house I asked if Bobbie had any badge on his\\sports jacket, or other kind of badge. They knew of none, and wemarked this down as a failure. Later in the day I asked to see the;Jack of Hearts boards and cap, as I washed to photograph them.^When they were placed in position before the camera I noticed thatthe heart corresponded with the description of the badge. \u201c Something like a straight line goes through the top of it, and a little upstanding piece comes out of the top.\u201d\r\nThis crown was part of Bobbie\u2019s Jack of Hearts\u2019 outfit, and if westudy the way m which this had been first given (see 34 and 35), wemay suppose that Feda was \u201c shown \u201d the boards, but that the capwas described to her in words. If that were so, it need not surprise usthat, when this cap w^as again described, after an interval of fivemonths, Feda did not recognise it. If we read sections 24 and 31, comparing the messages with theirverifications, we get the impression that Feda received the descriptions in so vague a form that she was unable to form a clear pictureof the objects intended. The idea \u201c building in a scullery \u201d reachedFeda\u2019s consciousness as \u201c like building an outhouse.\u201d The seconditem, which referred to fitting up a gymnasiimi, was spoken in a waywhich suggests that it came in fragments. It is evident that re-ception was not pictorial, but rather a succession of nebulous ideas.And is not this exactly how telepathic impressions are usuallyreceived by experimenters, and often, also, in cases of spontaneoustelepathic impressions ? How often we find that a recipient becomes\u201c aware of something wrong at home \u201d, yet is quite unable to saywhat the trouble may be.\r\nThe following illustration merits being given in full, even if in-volving some repetition of what has been said previously. Note thevague and partially inaccurate way in which the ideas are expressed.I state the facts first, and then give Feda\u2019s wording.\r\nOne of Bobbie\u2019s special interests was roller skating. Among thepeople he met at the rink was a child named Marjorie, who held asemi-professional post there. She was an accomplished skater andfrequently gave an exhibition before the commencement of the\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 515\r\nhockey matches. Indeed, the home team termed her their Mascot\r\nand she would begin their competitions by an exhibition of skating,\r\nin which she finally drove a ball into the goal. She was a year or two older than Bobbie and they were great friends, as can be\r\ngathered from the fact elsewhere stated that once, while she was away on a visit, Bobbie said to his mother, \u201c If I don\u2019t see Marjorie soon I shall go mad \u201d. This was but a month before his death. He\r\noften skated with Marjorie, and was familiar with this exhibition in\r\nwhich she played with the ball\u2014indeed, it is probable that he sometimes joined her in playing with it. And now, notice how this emerges in the sitting (39) :\r\nFeda : Did I tell you last time about a girl, a little older than Bobbie,\r\nthat he was fond of. She seemed as if very kind to him, like giving up things to him and being very nice to him, and this girl\r\nhas been\u2014I can\u2019t get this quite\u2014but it is something to do with\r\nthis girl and doing something with a ball that belonged to Bobbie.\r\nI don\u2019t think this is much good\u2014you see I am not getting this\r\nfrom Mr John now, I am getting it from Bobbie.\u2014Something this\r\ngirl has been doing about a ball that Bobbie was fond of when he was here, the girl has been doing something with it.\r\nI think there is no doubt that this refers to Marjorie and her\r\nexhibition with the ball, but how vaguely expressed ! Does it not\r\ngive the impression that Feda only heard a few words here and there,\r\nmuch as a deaf person catches the general trend of a discourse ? Or\r\nshall we say that, while receiving the ideas, there were breaks in the\r\nreception, and that in voicing the message Feda fills each break with\r\nthe word \u2018 something \u2019 ? One notices that she says, \u201c It is something\r\nto do with this girl \u201d, and \u201c doing something with a ball\r\nOn another occasion, after Bobbie had been giving a considerable\r\namount of information relating to the skating rink, I gathered that\r\nthe subject was concluded, because Feda said, \u201c He is losing it a bit,\r\nhe is going back a bit\r\nI therefore sought to introduce a new subject by putting a question\r\nsent by the family. I said, \u201c Bobbie, what did you keep in the bathroom cupboard ? Show a picture of it, think about it and let Feda\r\nsee.\u201d (77.)\r\nThis is what followed. No reference was made to the bathroom\r\ncupboard ; but instead came what appears to be a further reference\r\nto the rink. It would seem that Bobbie either did not notice my\r\nquestion or that he chose to ignore it because, in the interval, he had\r\nrecollected something further which he wished to say about the\r\nskating rink.\r\nConfusion not infrequently follows the putting of a question, for\r\n516 C. Drayton Thomas [partthe communicator may disregard it and continue his previous line ofthought. Feda naturally assumes that it is the question which is being answered, and the sitter may fail to reahse that the communicator is calmly continuing just as if no question had been asked.\r\nWe have seen that the method of reception by the Feda-Leonardconsciousness is not, as a rule, clairvoyance. I gather that Feda\u201c sees \u201d, or \u201c is shown \u201d, when the objects in question are such as canbe easily pictured. An outstanding case of this clairvoyance formental pictures is found in section 34. The description of the boylooking over his sandwich board is most striking when comparedwith its verification. It seems as if Feda \u201c saw \u201d what her wordsdescribed. But apparently something went wrong with the latterhalf of the description, which contains the inaccuracies \u201csitting\u201d,\u201c leaning a bit forward \u201d, \u201c crouching position \u201d. Were these latertouches due to Feda\u2019s imperfect perception of a mental picture ? This seems probable. On the other hand, the inaccurate pointsadded to the description may have been given by my father, who,after all, would have only received his idea of the picture at secondhand from Bobbie. There is, however, an alternative siggestionwhich is not without interest. It may have been an instance of acomposite picture resulting from the commmiicator\u2019s marginalthought mingling with the main idea which he was trying to project.For it is known that a second photograph was taken by a Pressphotographer, and in it Bobbie with his boards was among otherfancy-dress companions. Unfortunately, that negative was not used,and is lost or destroyed. Possibly Bobbie himself was adding towhat had been said by my father and unintentionally gave Feda ageneralised impression of his various attitudes while in the fancydress.\r\nClairvoyance was certainly not used in item 91, where one mighthave expected that it would have been a simpler method of transmitting the idea. Reference is made to an article of celluloid whichmight flame or explode. The verification of this object is sufficientlycertain. Why was it not \u201c shown \u201d ? The verbal method failed toget through so difficult a word as cinematograph, whereas clairvoy-ance would, one supposes, have produced a visual impression of thetoy which, if described to the sitter, could have been easily recognisedfor what it was. True, it would not have been sufficient, for clair-voyance could not have imparted the information that they \u201c wantedhim to stop using it ; they thought it might make a flame or ex-plosion \u201d. For that statement a definite thought had to be transmitted ; a \u201c feeling \u201d or a picture would not have conveyed the idea.And here it may be remarked that Feda uses the words \u201c see \u201dand \u201c feel \u201d with a certain amount of careful distinction, and will\r\n143 ] A Proxy Case 517\r\nalways give me her exact impressions when I inquire by what means\r\nshe is getting such and such a fact. In these sittings we find numerous clearly-expressed and even long\r\nand intricate descriptions. This is never achieved telepathically,\r\napart from mediumistic utterance. Telepathy, as we know it from\r\nspontaneous occurrence and from experiment, is chiefly feeling,\r\nrarely a transmission of clear-cut thought. Now we may ask, are the numerous clear-cut and accurate thoughts, which were ex- pressed in the course of these sittings, sent by persons at Nelson or not ? If they came from Nelson they would represent a triumph\r\nwhich places them in a class of telepathy about which psychical\r\nresearch knows nothing. But we have seen that the most outstanding feature of these sittings\u2014the pipes problem\u2014did not come from\r\npeople at Nelson. Telepathy from earth was ruled out. Consequently, we may, m my opinion, confidently assume that the information, so copiously and so accurately given, came from Bobbie\r\nNewlove\u2019s mind and was transmitted to Leonard-Feda. In other\r\nwords, it was not due to the telepathy which is familiar to psychical\r\nresearch, whether in experiment or observation, but is an instance\r\nof information imparted by one who had left the physical body\r\nbehind at death. Let the reader turn to section 130 and note the\r\nboy\u2019s description of his attitude towards his mother. Much of it would be far from true of most boys, yet it is recognised as being\r\n\u201c remarkably correct \u201d. Now that I have met Mrs Newlove I can vouch for its perfect relevancy. Notice, also, that it rings true to the\r\nboy\u2019s viewpoint, and is not the kind of description which would have\r\nbeen derived from his mother\u2019s thought about him. Such a message\r\nas this exceeds, in extent and in detail, anything known to have\r\npassed from mind to mind on earth by extra-sensory channels. When\r\nit is remembered that my only fink with the family consisted of\r\nletters sent in acknowledgment of my report of sittings, that I knew\r\nnothing but what these told me, and that the family were most\r\ncareful to give me no information likely to lessen the evidential value\r\nof subsequent messages\u2014remembering all this, it would be difficult to maintain the supposition that the medium was reading my mind,\r\nor tapping the thought of unknown persons two hundred miles\r\ndistant in an unnamed town.\r\nIt may be asked why telepathy in the presence of a medium\r\nshould produce results so much better than does telepathy between\r\nagent and subject under non-mediumistic conditions. Is it that those\r\nbetween whom thought-transmission takes place during a mediumistic sitting are within a field of influence created by the medium ? Such a field of influence might render possible a community or interpenetration of sensation and thoiight. (The hypnotic experi-\r\n518 C. Drayton Thomas [partments of M. Emile Boirac suggest this. See his Psychic Science,iRider 1918.) !I do not press this hypothesis, but offer it for consideration in|view of the fact that mediumistic messages are incomparably superior[in extent and accuracy to non-mediumistic telepathic messages.\r\nThe most puzzling question connected with the problem of the;Pipes relates to the difficulty experienced by the communicators intelling what they knew. It is evident that they knew the factsduring the six months which elapsed between their first hint andour final discovery. And there is no reason to doubt their wish tomake it plain.\r\nWhy, then, could not the facts have been stated in one shortsentence, such as, \u201c Bobbie played by the pipes where springs issueon the Heights \u201d 1 That is the question which I asked my fatherafter the mystery had been solved. His reply, which opens up thewhole subject of modus operandi, was, in substance, this\u2014The diffi-culty lay in the necessity of fitting-in the information, of being ableat the opportime moment to fit it upon the medium\u2019s brain, eitherpersonally or through Feda. The several parts of any messagewhich we desire to give may be likened to the separate pieces of apuzzle. \u201c I should wish \u201d, said he, \u201c to start with that piece whichwill enable me to proceed methodically, but I may find that I cannotconvey it to Feda, or that she cannot convey it to the medium. SoI have to give just whatever happens to fit at the moment. Then,suddenly, while the medium\u2019s mental activity is running like amachine, I notice it bringing up something which harmonises with adifferent piece of the puzzle, and I hurriedly cast about to find thepiece that will fit. Even when the opportime moment comes, I maybe further embarrassed by failure to recall my prepared material.Hence it is necessary that I should provide clues, or associationlinks, with my own material, in order that I may recollect it iustantlywhen it is required. That which I hope to give must harmonise, orassociate with, what is uppermost in the medium\u2019s brain, or I shallfail to attach it and to fit it in so that it will be taken. All happensin accordance with the laws of association. The brain does not takethat which is at the moment unsuited to it. I frequently wish tospeak on a particular subject, but cannot. I may try to lead up tomy desired topic, but that leading up to it is, in effect, \u2018 padding \u2019. Much of a sitting may consist of that, and while the communicatorkeeps the brain-machine revolving in the hope that it will bringround something suitable to his purpose, the chances are that thesitter, being unaware of this, grows listless and weary because,although words are being spoken, they do not convey anything thathe wishes to hear. Did he fully realise what is going on he might\r\nl43j ^4 Proxy Case 519\r\nassist in giving us the opportunity for which we are waiting.\r\n\u2019\r\n\u2019 Finally\r\nhe added : \u201c Much depends upon the medium\u2019s condition at the time, but the\r\nsitter\u2019s attitude also exerts its influence : keen interest freed from\r\nanxiety is a great assistance, and although we dislike leading\r\nquestions, yet suitable questions will sometimes help.\u201d That was\r\nthe pith of the reply.\r\nWe are, I think, better able to perceive his meaning if we recall\r\nthe difficulty sometimes felt by ourselves in speaking to others of\r\nthings we deeply feel. Very sensitive persons become keenly aware\r\nof that difficulty : they feel, without realising how, that it is useless\r\nto mention some particular subject, because it would be incompatible with the other person\u2019s present state of mind. So we decide to\r\nwait a more suitable opportunity lest the seed fall upon ground too\r\nstony to receive it. It is the highly sensitive minds which feel this\r\nmost strongly, and it is, I think, beyond question that the mind of a medium in trance is super-sensitive. I imagine that the mind of\r\nthe communicator is vastly more so. VTien psychology achieves a more complete understanding of the\r\nworking of the average mind, and shows us the meaning of those\r\npuzzling differences which we often notice in ourselves between one\r\ntime and another, it may help us to fathom the precise difficulties\r\nof those \"who, from life\u2019s further side, strive to express their thoughts\r\nto us by means of a stranger\u2019s brain.\r\nO M\r\nA FURTHER NOTE ON MR WHATELY CARINGTON\u2019S\r\nINVESTIGATION ^\r\nBy J. Cecil Maby\r\nMr Whately Carington\u2019s reply to my Note in Proc. S.P.R. vol. xliii. (see p]). 362-70) would appear to justify some further remarks onmy side. Incidentally, I would also like to avail myself of thisopportunity to discuss certain general aspects of this class of investigation that were implicit, but not explicit in my earlier remarks ; my chief aim being not to oppose, but, if possible, to complement]\\Ir Carington\u2019s own attitude.\r\nFirst, however, a few words regarding Mr Carington\u2019s reply to myNote.\r\nI am, of course, only too willing to admit that I am no professionalstatistician, and hence was compelled to rely, to some extent, onMr Carington\u2019s own interpretation of his long and involved calculations. I hasten, therefore, to acknowledge his elucidation of one ortwo issues that may not have been altogether clear to some of thosewho had not been through the actual computations, nor employedthe analytical procedures advocated. I should, however, haveappreciated a little more lenity with respect to such misunderstandings, in view of the facts, first, that it is obviously impossiblefor anyone to be a master of every branch of science in these days,and second, that Mr Carington has, to some extent, misinterpretedmy remarks. Thus, when I speak of general reliability of theoriginal data I use the word reliable in its common connotation, notin any special statistical sense. Lastly, I fear that Mr Carington was a trifle perturbed by whatmay have appeared to him to be unjust criticisms of his admirablework. As, however, I have since reassured him privately that nosuch injustice was intended, there will be no need for me to commentfurther here on the somewhat terse tone of his reply to my previousNote, which, no doubt, was the result of mutual misunderstandingnow happily past.\r\nQuantitative Analytical Methods\r\ni\\Ir Caringt.on has been at considerable pains to impress us withthe value of statistical analysis in connection with Psychical Re-^ The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities, Proc. S.P.R., vols. xlii.\r\n(p. 173) and xliii. (p. 320).\r\n520\r\n[part 143] A Furthe?' Note on Mr Carington's Investigation 521\r\nsearch, and I gather that he erroneously beheves my Note to have\r\nbeen aimed at questioning it. Far from it. For though mathematical work does not happen to be my own metier, I have often\r\nhad occasion to carry out many laborious sheets of numerical correlations and probable errors, and other estimates of like nature ; and I know well that graphical or other less rigid methods of analysis\r\nof the data would not have yielded such conclusive or reliable\r\nresults. Moreover, I was careful, in my Note, not in any way to\r\nquestion the value or excellence of Mr Carington\u2019s analyses, as such.\r\nTo my mind, no question can well arise as to the merits of statistical\r\nanalysis : its value has long been proved in other fields, and, to- gether with our author, I regard it as an extremely powerful instrument\u2014however incomprehensible and boring to the non-mathematical mind !\r\n]\\Ir Carington pomted out in his first paper that his chief aim was\r\nto demonstrate a method, rather than to make any startling deductions with regard to the nature and constitution of human personality. Well and good ; but such deductions cannot thereafter fail to be drawn from so much careful work on the reactions of mediums\r\nsuch as Mrs Leonard, Mrs Garrett and Herr Rudi Schneider, and\r\npublished withal in the Proceedings of this Society. Indeed, Mr\r\nCarington himself has not failed to draw them. Incidentally, he\r\nalso tends to cast rather a gloomy shadow upon logical and non- mathematical methods of analysis and interpretation of psychological data, which, however, have long and well (if somewhat painfully and tardily) shed light on many obscure psychological problems.\r\nNow, without pretending to make an irrefutable point, but simply\r\nin order to help preserve a balance at this juncture, I would like\r\nto suggest that, since our minds express themselves in words\r\n\r\ni.e., non-numerical symbols of metaphysical ideas, thoughts and sensations\u2014Human Psychology ^ must, therefore, also primarily concern\r\nitself with words. That being so, numerical analyses would appear\r\nto represent a secondary and, in a sense, highly artificial mode of\r\napproach to the psychological life and structure of the mind ; though\r\nnot so, of course, as regards the physiological problems and quantities of the body and its nervous system.\r\nIt may, perhaps, be noted in passing, that abstract number in\r\n^ N.B. that I am not speaking here simply of animal behaviourism. Since\r\nthey lack any clear and comprehensive language of self-expression, we cannot\r\nrightly pretend to know anything whatever of the thoughts and feehngs of\r\ndumb beasts, except by highly fallible analogy. So-called animal psychology\r\nis a purely behaviouristic and physiological science into which true psychoanalysis can scarcely be said to enter. This point has an important bearing on the present enquiry. (See below.)\r\n522 J. Cecil Maby [partitself has no reality, even in the mind of a mathematician. Forexample, what does the number 3, say, convey to the mind ? Either\r\nit suggests three physical objects or sources of sensorial stimulus\r\nof some sort, or else it is imagined as a graphic symbol on a piece\r\nof paper, or, again, as the spoken sound \u201c three.\u201d In the beast andilliterate savage, all psychological ideas may be said to refer to\r\n])hysical objects or sensations ; in the more cultured and literate\r\nmind they also possess a verbal symbology. Numerical symbology,indeed, also arises from cultural development and the progress of\r\ncivilized intercourse and barter ; yet I believe that one is justified\r\nin assuming a science of numbers to represent a later developmentthan one of words. One may say, therefore, that the sentient mindis occupied primarily by purely sensorial ideas ; while, subsequently,\r\nthe idea and its word symbol become more or less inseparably inter- woven. In attempting to analyse the ideational content of a person\u2019s\r\nmind, therefore, we cannot well avoid devoting ourselves primarilyto verbal symbology and verbal inter-associations. Unhappily, suchassociations do not appear conveniently to offer themselves for\r\nmathematical analysis, except, perhaps, of a very simple kind.\r\nPhysiological reactions, on the other hand, are evidently measurable,\r\nquantitatively in ordinary space-time units. Such quantities, however, must ever remain purely secondary to the thoughts and feelings\r\nthemselves, which they cannot even be said to represent in symbolical form. At least, physiological quantities are no more or less than an indirect expression of the relative intensity and duration ofa given emotion ; whereas the concomitant (resultant or causative)\r\nthoughts or feelings remain absolutely inviolable and unplumbedby such behaviouristic analyses.\r\nFortunately, however, since Mr Carington has interested himselfin behaviouristic response, the above facts do not affect his numericalcalculations. For the psycho-galvanic reflex is essentially a physiological reaction (though sometimes psychologically actuated), andword reaction times are, likewise, physiological concomitants ofpsychological processes. Numerical data are, therefore, here primarily in question. We have no more reason, however, for assumingthat such physiological reaction values are direct and proportionate\r\nindices of concomitant psychological states ^ than we have for\r\nassuming that the violence of an earth-worm\u2019s struggles, whentrodden upon, are an index of its pain\r\n\r\nseemingly so certain.\r\nWe have seen that Mr Carington, on his own admission, makes use^ As I hope shortly to show in a paper to be pubhshed on the subject, the\r\npsycho-galvanic reflex, for example, is deplorably unreliable as an index even\r\nto simple emotions (though useful in a general way) ; much more so in relation\r\nto non-emotional psychological states, for intelligence tests, etc.\r\n143] A Further Note on Mr Carington\u2019s Investigation 523\r\nof behaviouristic responses in his endeavour to analyse human\r\npersonalities. The reactions which he employs are not only primarily physiological, but they are also\u2014or should be, if things are to go\r\nsmoothly of a reflex type. One may fau'ly state, therefore, that\r\nMr Carington has based his deductions, respecting the various\r\nsupposed personalities in question, upon behaviouristic reactions in\r\nthe bodily organisms of his three mediums, which are strictly of a mechanico-physical nature. The important question then arises : Precisely what do we mean by the expression human persoyiality I I beheve that the great majority of people use the term personality\r\nwith reference to psychological make-up ; that is to say, the term\r\nrefers to mental structures and attributes rather than to bodily ones. Hence, when Mr Carington employs behaviouristic tests and physiological data in his analyses, there can be very little doubt that what\r\nhe is investigating is the physiological organisms rather than the\r\npsychological personalities of the supposed communicators and\r\ncontrols. That being so, the further and yet more important\r\nquestion now arises : Can the control of the medium\u2019s organism, in\r\nthe trance state, by the invading personality be supposed to be so complete as to influence not only the medium\u2019s mind (and hence\r\ngovern the organs of articulate speech via the appropriate nervous mechanism), but also the entire physiological mechanism, to the\r\nextent of influencing reaction times, electrical skin resistance, etc. ? Of course, I do not wish to deny the ultimate possibility of such\r\ncomplete control, amounting to actual possession of the bodily\r\norganism (in the old sense) by the invading spirit, but it is undeniably a tremendous assumption, which, if proved, would settle\r\nAnally the main problem of Psychology, namely : Do the spirit and\r\nmind possess a discrete existence and autonomy outside of the bodily\r\norganism, or are they not rather expressions, in another mode, of the\r\ncomplex of physico-chemical activities that constitute a living\r\norganism and may be of certain activities of the nervous system\r\nin particular.\r\nIt appears clearly to me that the assumption of comj)lete bodily\r\nand mental possession is imphcit in l\\Ir Carington\u2019s method ; and\r\nhe may be right in permitting himself that assumption. If, however, such an assumption were finally shown to be imjustified, and\r\nyet such physiological changes of state in the medium were still found to occur under the given conditions, then we might see m that a sure proof of the fact that the soi-disant personalities were no more\r\nnor less than alternative controlling personahties inherent in the one\r\noriginal organism ; a proof of multiple personality, in fact. What a pity it is that the results of such a quantitative investigation cannot, in the nature of things, give us a decisive answer to the\r\n524 -\/. Cecil Maby [partquestion : Are these cases of true spiritual invasion and possessionfrom without, or have we merely a sub-division of an unitary psychophysical organism \/rom within ? And it is just here that the additional value of verbal responses and ideational mental contents areof paramount importance ; since the completely foreign nature ofthe latter alone would be likely to prove (or else strongly to suggest)a real inspiration from without\u2014all the more so, however, if theyare found to be associated with distinctive physiological reactionsin connection with the supposed personalities.\r\nHere we come up against the question of possible telepathy. Inso far as the different word responses might chance to arise out oftelepathy or mind-reading between the medium and an operatorsuch as Mr C. Drayton Thomas (see below), one might expect either() a general and fairly consistent (?) lengthening of reactiontimes for all trance \u201c communicators \u201d : but which mightalso be due merely to the trance state as such, and henceinvolve the \u201c controls \u201d as much as the \u201c communicators.\u201d() sporadic and inconsistent variation of the individual reactiontimes of the \u201c communicators \u201d owing to variable delay in\r\ngetting the answers telepathically.\r\nUnfortunately, I have not details of the reaction data now beforeme ; but I recollect, and some graphs for the Leonard personalities\u2019\r\nreaction times seem to indicate, that the responses in trance wereconsistently much slower than those of normal Leonard. Moreover,when the times coimected with individual words were discounted andsimply reaction-time distribution curves drawn for the severalpersonalities, those for all the trance personalities fell pretty muchtogether, while that of Ln (normal Leonard) was most conspicuously distmct. From this it would appear that the trance state\r\nitself increased reaction times as a whole\u2014trance inter-personaldistinctions being comparatively slight as compared with thedistinction of Ln already noted.\r\nAs for personal reaction times to the individual words, Mr Carington would be able to tell us how far he found them to be consistent ; but my general impression was, I recollect, that they wereextraordinarily variable and sporadic as compared with the sort ofreactions one gets from normal subjects. If that, indeed, was so, maynot the actual reaction times on any single occasion (in trance) havebeen simply an expression of the medium\u2019s varying delay either\r\n(ffl) in reading her sitter\u2019s mmd, telepathically, or\r\n(6) in receiving and comprehending the \u201c message \u201d of a real\r\nspirit communicator ?\r\nI43j A Further Note on Mr Carington s Investigation 525\r\nSpiritistic Possession\r\nTo return to the problem of spirit communicators, and their\r\npossible possession of the medium\u2019s organism. If the body be re- garded merely as an elaborate physical instrument built by the\r\nspirit for the achievement of certain psychic experiences and purposes, and guided by the psychic organisation that exists spiritually\r\nand develops mentally (as a captain directs and steers his shijj),\r\nthen it seems practically inevitable that the specific qualities of\r\nsuch an instrument should \u201c colour \u201d every idea or communication\r\nexpressed through it\u2014no matter whose the personality that lay\r\nbehind it. In other words, one would expect that although the\r\nactual thoughts expressed by a\r\n\u201c communicator \u201d should be foreign\r\nand patently \u201c inspired,\u201d yet the physiological properties and re- actions of the medium\u2019s body {qua physical instrument) would\r\nremain unchanged by the state of possession. This \u201c local colour \u201d\r\nmight even extend so far as to limi t the verbal vocabulary of the\r\n\u201c communicator \u201d to that inherent in the medium\u2019s normal mind.\r\nIndeed, so much one would rather expect, if the idea of the physical\r\ninstrument is correct ; just as an organist is limited in his j^laying\r\nby the number of keys, manuals and stops on the instrument before\r\nhim. So that if it can ultimately be shown that spiritistic possession can go so far (supposing that it happens at all) as to modify the\r\nnormal physiological reactions of the medium\u2019s body, as good as proof will have been evinced of the reality of such an invasion from\r\nwithout. The present great difficulty, however, is that it is impossible to say just where the normal personality\u2019s, or else personalities\u2019,\r\nfaculty for modifying psychological and physiological responses ends.\r\nIf only we knew that at all certainly, we might then state where\r\nspiritistic mvasion (if any) begins ! Add to this protean power of the\r\norganism the ability also to receive telepathic impulses, to mindread and sense paragnostically, etc., and the complexity of the\r\nproblem is only too apparent.^ One way or another, however, Mr\r\nCarington appears to me, personally, to be making an uncommonly\r\npenetrating and persistent attack on that problem, for which he\r\nmerits our praise and admiration.\r\nOne last word upon the possibility of an mvading psyche not only\r\ndirecting the thoughts (and speech), but also modifying, to some\r\nextent, the normal physiological reactions of a medium\u2019s organism.\r\nIt should not be thought that the analogy of the organist playing\r\nupon a given instrument is altogether a fair one, for it omits the\r\nimportant fact that in the human organism (as instrument) there is\r\n1 1 am glad to see that, in liis second paper, Mr Carington admits that \u201c the\r\nwhole story is enormously more complicated than (he) at first imagined.\u201d\r\n526 J. Cecil Maby [part\r\na certain amount of undoubted plasticity, so far as the protoplasm\r\nand the nervous connections are concerned. It appears to be a fact\r\nthat nervous connections can be quite readily built up and destroyed\r\nin tbe adult organism, as well as s}maptic thresholds raised and\r\nlowered appreciably at will. Hence our persistent ability to learn\r\nnew facts and habits, as well as to remember and forget. It would\r\nappear, therefore, that an invading psyche might actually get more,\r\nor even different, things out of a given bodily organism than did\r\nthe normal controlling personahty ; whereas an organist is ulti- mately limited by the special physical construction of his instrument,\r\nwhich lacks such plasticity of response.\r\nIf, then, Mr Carington actually finds specific and detailed behaviourisms corresponding to each soi-disant personahty, we need\r\nnot be immeasurably surprised ; and we can at least deduce therefrom that such personalities are autonomous, whether they originate\r\nwithin the medium her- or himself, or whether they represent true\r\nspiritistic invasions from without. And if I may be allowed to\r\nexpress a personal sentiment, based upon common, though notrigidly \u201c scientific,\u201d observation, it is that we are ah of us subject\r\nto occasional possession ( = invasion ?) by spiritistic impulses {N.B.\r\nI do not venture to say complex personalities) of a kind apparently\r\ndistinct from the mere emergence of a dissociated, or subconscious,\r\npart of our o-rni personalities. Such possessions, if real, mayrepresent either\r\n(a) the release of certain physiological genetic elements in ourcomplete organic make-up, or possibly\r\n{b) a true spiritistic impulse received from without our ownphysical organism, from another personality, whether alive or \u201c dead,\u201d and permitted to play its own melodies uponthe instrument of our body.^\r\nIn their simpler and more generally recognised form, the latter\r\nconstitute what we term telepathic impulses, in which the percipientappears sometimes to play a passive role, but at others (conjointlyvdth the agent) an active one. In their fuller and less generally admitted form, such psychicinvasions are exemphfied by the feeling that many of us sometimeshave of the spirit of another (near relation, such as a deceasedfather, or a powerful friend), working through us pro tern. While,in their completest form, we see such apparent invasions in thephenomena of the trance medium or the somnambulist.\r\n^ Re vital impulses in general, see von Uexkiill\u2019s excellent work, \u201c Theoretical Biology,\" Kegan Paul, Trubner, Trench & Co., 1926.\r\n143] ^4 F^irfher Note on Mr Carington's Investigation 527\r\nExperimental Procedure\r\nAs we have seen, Mr Carington originally stated that he was\r\nchiefly interested to demonstrate a statistical method ; which he\r\nappears very ably to have done. Nor have I ventured to question\r\nthe validity of that method or of his actual calculations and deductions. In my Note {vide supra) I did venture, however, to raise\r\ncertain questions regardmg the method of collection and intrinsic\r\nreliability of the actual data employed ; and that not, I must\r\nreassure Mr Carington, with any idea of mere fault-finding or impertinence, but with an honest desire to further the interests of\r\nsuch work. I cannot but think it a pity, therefore, that he took\r\nrather less pains, in his reply, to answer my comments upon experimental procedure than to justify his calculations, which, presumably,\r\nneed no justification.\r\nMr Carington commences his rejoinder by admitting that his\r\ndata were more or less mireliable, and does not exactly deny that\r\nthe experimental conditions might have been improved, one way\r\nor another. Here, then, is my first point : that it was a mistake to\r\nhave expended so great an amount of time and energy on these\r\nlengthy tests and computations, including the risk of exhausting\r\nthree good mediums\u2019 interest and reactive-capacity,^ without having\r\nfirst experimented in extenso with the proposed technique on several\r\nordmary subjects. As it is, any such minor sources of confusion or\r\nerror as may have existed will have detracted from the maximal\r\nvalue of the data obtamed from the main investigation itself. Again, though it would be unreasonable to expect that every\r\ndifficulty or problem should be foreseen, it would have been to\r\nadvantage to have tested IMrs Leonard in her normal (imprepared)\r\nstate between and m parallel wdth the main (trance) sittmgs, instead\r\nof as an afterthought ; and the whole question of histrionic poses\r\nand secondary personalities {vide the Besterman-Gatty and Salter\r\ntests) might have been gone into as a preliminary. The important\r\nquestions of possible telepathy between medium and operator (see\r\nbelow), cmmfiative mental facihtation,- on the one hand, and\r\npsychological boredom, on the other, might have been first studied\r\n^ Such an inference appears to follow from actual tests of many normal\r\nand neurotic subjects, that I have made, employing the word-association test and psycho-galvanic reflex : \u2014a subject\u2019s spontaneous reactivity to a given\r\nclass of test progressively flags. Subjects that have become famihar with\r\nsuch psycho- analytical methods also grow \u201c sophisticated \u201d. Preliminary\r\nexperiments are, therefore, better made on unimportant subjects.\r\n\u201c I.e., increasing reflexivity and \u201c sophistication \u201d of the responses con- comitant with repetitive reaction, tending to reduce reaction times, lessen\r\np.g. reflexes, and standardise word responses.\r\n528 .\/. Cecil Maby [partin detail. The effects\u2014which are undoubtedly important\u2014of such\r\nfactors as change of operator, method of presenting the stimuli,\r\nchoice of suitable stimulus words, irregular time intervals betweensittings, etc. might also have been made the subject of preliminary\r\ninvestigations and discussions. Finally, I believe that Mr Carington\r\nwould have benefited and saved much calculation by the use of\r\nsome other form of p.g. reflexometer apparatus [e.g. Mr G. G.\r\nBlake\u2019s device ') ; while I have previously pointed out the fact that\r\nsmall p.g. reflexes to spoken replies often appear to be merely anindication of the degree of psycho-physical disturbance, resulting\r\nfrom the mere effort of articulation, rather than of personal psychological significance, and that when no verbal response is mademany reactions fall to zero\u2014especially with a familiar subject.\r\nActually, Mr Carington reassures us (and I am glad to hear it)\r\nthat \u201cin so far as the factors mentioned are constant for a given\r\nword, personality or occasion,\u201d and also \u201c in so far as they are not\r\nconstant \u201d, they are duly accounted for in his calculations and\/or\r\nby the quantity that he calls OWP, representing Error.\r\nAll that I need add, therefore, is the query ; Would not the data\r\nhave been rendered more secure and valuable, and the calculations\r\nsimpler, if some of these sources of error could have been ehminated,\r\nor reduced, by preliminary experiments and more attention to the\r\nempirical side ? I beheve, personally, that they would. Possibly,\r\nhowever, Mr Carington made such preliminary experiments as are usual m such a case, but did not happen to refer to them in his\r\npapers.\r\nInjluence of the Sitter\u2014Telepathy\r\nIn answer to my suggestion that telepathy between subject andoperator \u2019 was not only possible, but highly probable under such\r\ncircumstances, Mr Carington affects not to understand quite whatI mean.\r\nI mean, of course, that thought transference in the broad sense waspossible, no matter whether the operator might be termed an active\r\nagent or merely a jMSsive source of information. These two processes,\r\nnamely, active telepathy by some sort of energetic emission of\r\nthought from agent to a passive (?) percipient, and telaesthesic\r\n1 Vide G. G. Blake, M.I.E.E., in Journ.

The distinction, however, has often been intimated, and the Earl of Balfour recently\r\ndiscussed the matter in his important paper {Proc. S.P.R. Vol. xliii.) on Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumship ; so that I can scarcely believe that\r\nMr Carington should have failed to appreciate my meaning.\r\nFor example, take the case of Mrs Leonard, with Mr Drayton\r\nThomas as operator.\r\nAm I not right in supposing :\r\n() that Mrs Leonard, in trance, is perfectly capable of reading\r\nher sitter\u2019s mind (especially one so familiar as C.D.T.\u2019s)\r\nalmost like a book ? Certainly, she thus read my mother\u2019s\r\na complete stranger\u2019s.\r\n() that all the words and ideas actually given in response by\r\nMrs Leonard\u2019s communicators, \u201c John \u201d and \u201c Etta,\u201d were\r\nfamiliar to Mr C. Drayton Thomas himself\u2014no matter\r\nwhether they happened to be supraliminal or subliminal\r\nat the time of the tests ?\r\n(c) that the replies of \u201c John \u201d and \u201c Etta \u201d (in so far as they were specific, and did not show confusion with ideas in the\r\nmedium\u2019s own mind, or that of her control, \u201c Feda \u201d) might\r\nbe supposed to be fairly well segregated in C.D.T.\u2019s own\r\nmind as memories relating to his father and his sister\r\nrespectively ? Add to this the facts that the operator himself called out the\r\nstimulus words, and cannot but have entertained appropriate answers (whether supraliminally or subliminally is not the point),\r\nand it will be apparent for all to see that mind-reading and\/or\r\nactive telepathy from person to person were practically inevitable.^\r\nEven though Mr Drayton Thomas was tested separately with the\r\nsame word list, and found to give foreconscious rephes in non- agreement with those by \u201c John \u201d and \u201c Etta,\u201d - it is no proof\r\nthat the medium did not read the subliminal \u00ae part of the operator\u2019s\r\nWhether such telepathic action should have at all influenced the reaction\r\ntimes and p.g. reflexes, as apart from the response words, is another matter\r\nupon which it would be interesting to hear Mr Carington\u2019s opinion. But if\r\nso, one would be all the more surprised, since it is scarcely to be expected that a telepathic percipient or active mind reader should borrow another\u2019s physiological, as well as his mental reactions and dispositions.\r\n^ Vide pp. 349-352 of Mr Carington\u2019s second paper, loc. cit.\r\n\u00ae General evidence appears to point to the abihty of metagnomic subjects\r\nto read the subhminal as well as, or better than, the supraliminal mind of a\r\nsitter\u2014or even that of a person distant in space or time. {E.g. see Osty\u2019s\r\n\u2018 Supernormal Faculties in Man.\u201d)\r\n530 J. Cecil Mabry [part\r\nmind. In any case, Mrs Leonard is, I understand, so familiar with\r\nMr Drayton Thomas as a sitter, and hence also {ex hyjrothesi) with\r\nthe \u201c John \u201d and \u201c Etta \u201d components of his mind, that the appropriate answers would be ready prepared, even when some other\r\noperator such as Mr Irving took his place.^ And if anyone should\r\ndoubt the possibility, nay probabihty, of such mental interaction,\r\nthen I can only suggest that he must either be ignorant of, or have\r\npurposely blinded himself to, the facts of Psychic Science.\r\nThe case of \u201c Feda \u201d is simpler, and has already been discussed\r\nby Mr Carington. For \u201c Feda \u201d, hke Mrs Garrett\u2019s \u201c Uvani \u201d, maynot irrationally be supposed ^ to constitute a secondary personality\r\nof the medium\u2019s own mind ; and one would not be at all surprised\r\nto find that the mental content of such a more or less dissociated\r\npersonality was fairly discrete from that of the primary personality.\r\nConcomitantly, however, some degree of similarity and overlapping\r\nmight be observed ; and that Mr Carington actually found, I gather,\r\nin the cases of both \u201c Feda \u201d and \u201c Uvani \u201d, as well as in the interesting and important experiment with Mrs Salter upon her normal\r\nand \u201c automatic \u201d selves.\r\nBut in the last instance, one should remember that, on the hypothesis which supposes a certain amount of real spiritistic inspiration\r\noverlaid and somewhat confused by the automatist\u2019s own mental\r\ncontent,^ both significant similarity and significant difference would\r\nbe exjDected to be found between the normal and automatic reactions.^\r\nMr Carington here suggests a resemblance to the two Gatty poses,\u00ae\r\nwhich, elsewhere, he refers to as \u201c generalised, non-fraudulent poses, or changes in mental orientation \u201d. Of course, the question arises as to whether any conscious pose is not fraudulent in such psychoanalytical tests. Let that pass, however. The more important\r\npoint is, I think, as follows. Might it not easily appear from quantitative analyses that the sort of relationship existing between two\r\nhistrionic poses, say, of a smgle individual was similar to that\r\nbetween another individual\u2019s primary and secondary personalities, or even that between a medium\u2019s normal personality and a veritable\r\nspirit communicator, whose reactions had been somewhat confused\r\nand overlaid by the medium\u2019s own personality. Yet, au fond,\r\nmight not all these really represent absolutely different and unrelated cases, bearing only a numerical resemblance to one another ?\r\n^ Vide pp. 349-352 of Mr Carington\u2019s second paper, loc. cit.\r\n^ Vide pp. 329-43, loc. cit.\r\n3 E.g. see Mr Drayton Thomas\u2019 paper in Proc.

If not, it would obviously be dangerous and misleading to\r\nhint at resemblances between the Gatty and Salter pairs of\r\npersonalities.\r\nThe Verbal Responses\r\nFinally, I suggested in my previous Note that Mr Carington might\r\nhave benefited from being personally present at the tests. He\r\nrephes to this :\r\n\r\n\u201c I do not agree. The experiments are behaviouristic, not psychoanalytical,^ and one of their chief aims has been to secure objectivity\r\nby eliminating personal judgements.\u201d Well and good. So much I appreciate ; nor need I trouble to answer the insinuations contained\r\nin the second paragraph of Mr Carington\u2019s reply, since these are patently unjustified by my suggestion. Given Mr Carington\u2019s ex- planation {supra), all that I now wish to add is that, granted such\r\ngood opportunities, it seems a pity to have missed making the investigation psycho-analytical as well as behaviouristic ; though I appreciate that that would have been over-much for a single investigator,\r\nand would have necessitated a separate treatment from the quantitative analyses.\r\nWord analyses of the kind here in question would undoubtedly\r\nbe coloured by the subjective attitude, experience and intuition of\r\nthe individual analyst ; but, given some detailed experience of word\r\nassociation tests and of the reactions of a number of average minds\r\nof various types and grades, it should not be difficult for an impartial\r\nthird-party analyst to glean further interesting information from a\r\ncareful study of the actual word responses of the various personalities. Mr Drayton Thomas has, in fact, already given us an interesting summary of the words from the Leonard sittings, together\r\nwith his personal interpretation of them. But when Mr Drayton\r\nThomas very kindly lent me the word response sheets for two or three weeks, I fomid that it was possible yet further to analyse the\r\nresponses upon a number of lines apparently additional to those\r\nalready followed by Mr Carington and himself ; resulting in further\r\nsimple numerical comparisons between the various personalities.\r\nSince this was merely a private pioneer and subsidiary experiment on my part, the results of this analysis have not been published, but\r\nsome of them were, I think, sufficiently in agreement with Messrs.\r\nCarington\u2019s and Drayton Thomas\u2019s own findings to intimate that\r\n' Mr Carington here seems to use the term psycho-analytical in a curiously\r\nlimited and special sense.\r\n532 J. Cecil Maby [part 143]\r\nthe method employed was at least worth further consideratioh.\r\nA good deal of personal \u201c intuition \u201d (really crystallised subjective\r\nexperience of word association tests, etc.) certainly enters into the\r\nprocess, and I fully admit the soundness of Mr Carington\u2019s sentiment,\r\nthat such analyses are necessarily less conclusive and objective than\r\nnumerico-statistical estimates. At the same time, it is evident that\r\nthey can be made, and that they may 'lend additional support to\r\ndeductions drawn from quantitative analyses of the physiological\r\ndata. The results of such verbal analyses may be expressed in\r\nsimple numerical form. They are also complementary to analyses\r\nsuch as Mr Carington has himself carried out so successfully, in that\r\nthey deal with the words and ideas themselves, which his physiological data can scarcely be said to do.\r\nTo conclude then, may I sum up the gist of this argument as\r\nfollows ? In everyday affairs we usually rely as much upon the\r\npersonal judgment and expert opinions of individuals of experience\r\nand acumen (in any given field) as we do upon the impressive figures,\r\npercentages, probabilities, etc. provided by statistical science. All\r\nI wish to suggest, therefore, is that we should continue to do likewise in Psychology and Psychical Research, wherein, as in Art,\r\nReligion and Philosophy, all cannot be determined by the balance,\r\nthe foot-ride and the pendulum. Qualities are quite as important\r\nas, and sometimes more important than, quantities. Thus\r\nmomentarily taking leave of physical science, but not of psychology \u2014one may remark that had the ancient Greeks valued statistics as highly as they valued patriotism and military discipline, the Persian\r\nhost would never have been so valiantly opposed at Thermopylaeand ultimately routed at Marathon.\r\nI leave Mr Carmgton to disport himself at showing the ineptness\r\nof this analogy. There may, however, be others who will appreciate\r\nthe broad idea that lies behind it. Throughout this Note my aim has been to discuss matters in a\r\ngeneral and, I hope, constructive way, rather than to insinuate\r\nvarious vague criticisms. But should Mr Carington decide\u2014as I expect he may do\u2014that I have still \u201c failed to indicate a single\r\nnumerical result with which (I) disagree,\u201d then there can remain\r\nvery little for us to quarrel over ! At the same time, I shall have hadthe opportunity to remark upon one or two principles which appear\r\nto be connected with the general conduct and subsequent evaluation\r\nof an exceptionally important investigation, and one that I, personally, have found highly interesting and stimulating.\r\nOxford, August 1935.\r\nSOME COMMENTS\r\nON MR MARY\u2019S \u201c FURTHER NOTE \u201d\r\nBy Whately Carington\r\nIt is now clear to me that my reply to Mr Maby\u2019s first Note was\r\nbased on an extensive misunderstanding of his mtentions\u2014a circumstance which I trust may be held to extenuate any undue acerbity\r\nin my remarks.\r\nI know that Mr Maby will not take it amiss if I refrain from dealmg\r\nwith all the points of interest which he raises, but confine myself to a few of the more specific and important. I should like first, however,\r\nto make it clear in the most general way possible that I have no\r\ndesire to claim that the quantitative methods I have introduced are the only methods, or even the most fruitful, that can be applied in\r\npsychical research. They are, I believe, capable of yielding results\r\nnot otherwise obtainable, and perhaps of giving us a degree of assurance on certain points to which the qualitative approach cannot\r\nlead ; as such they are likely to prove indispensable, but they must\r\nalways be supplemented by, and themselves at best be complementary to, less specialised studies. Generally speaking, we must\r\nrely on these latter to tell us what to look for, and on the quantitative methods to tell us whether it is there.\r\nThe following comments occur to me in reply to particular points\r\nraised in Mr Maby\u2019s Note.\r\n1. I am afraid I cannot agree with the suggested artificiality of\r\nnumerical analysis. It is true that, for the most part, we think m\r\nwords rather than in numbers ; similarly we also eat bread and\r\nbutter rather than economic statistics, are the figures of agricultural\r\nproduction therefore to be stigmatised as \u201c artificial \u201d 1\r\n2. I fail to see that my methods in any way assume \u201c complete\r\nbodily and mental possession \u201d. They are, primarily, means of\r\nobtaining comparative data regarding the reactions of mediums in\r\ntheir various conditions of trance and otherwise, but these data re- quire interpretation in the light of our knowledge at any given\r\nmoment ; e.g., when I started, I supposed that significantly different\r\nsets of reactions could not be produced by a single personality, but\r\nthe Besterman-Gatty exqDeriment showed that this is not so. It may\r\nbe that future work will yield results which will demand something\r\nin the nature of a \u201c possessive \u201d explanation, but the theory must\r\nfollow the facts. The only way, it seems to me, in which the method\r\nmay fairly be said to \u201c assume \u201d possession is that it does seem\r\n533\r\n534 WJmfely Caringfon [part\r\ncapable, in principle, of producing data which might virtually force\r\nsuch an explanation upon us.\r\n3. I agree that there is a tendency for all trance reaction times to\r\nbe slower than the normal, but it seems to me scarcely practicable\r\nto decide whether this is due to a process of communication, to\r\ntelepathic delays, or to \u201c the trance state as such The question\r\nof identity is all important, and I think that if ever we were to\r\nobtain from a communicator a set of reactions significantly different\r\nfrom those of the medium and significantly similar to those obtained\r\nfrom that communicator ante mortem (themselves also differing\r\nfrom the medium) it would be difficult to support Mr Maby\u2019s contention that the method \u201c cannot, in the nature of things, give us a\r\ndefinite answer to the question ; Are these cases of spirit invasion\r\n. . . from without, or ... a sub-division . . . from within ? \u201d\r\n4. As regards the consistency of differences between reaction\r\ntimes for different words : This is covered by the quantity I have\r\ncalled \u201c I \u201d (RN 1-18, 42-70, 135-153). Reference to these results\r\nwill show that the consistency is significantly large compared with\r\nthe error present, in nearly all cases. Prepared Leonard is the most\r\nimportant exception.\r\n5. Experimental Procedure : (a) Reliability is never absolute,\r\nthough in buying pounds of butter we do not usually worry about the\r\nprobable error of the weighings. Where error is liable to be serious, as here, we can do no more than use the best methods we know,\r\nestimate how great the error is, and compute the chance of the\r\nobserved results being due to it. This I have done.\r\n(b) In 1920 and thereabouts I observed a matter of some 10,000\r\nreactions with nearly a hundred different (normal) subjects using\r\nthe same technique as in this work. The results (cf. my Measurement of Emotion) seemed to me to justify the belief that the procedure was good enough for all practical purposes, although, of\r\ncourse, one can always go on refining any method\u2014and methods for\r\ntesting the refinement of the method\u2014indefinitely. I do not think\r\nI can, in these circumstances, fairly be accused of neglecting the\r\npreliminary testing of my tools.\r\n6. Exhaustion of mediums : If a subject were to become ex- hausted by re]3eated tests, the result could only be, I think, that\r\nall words would sink to a common dead level of uninterestingness,\r\nso that the differences between them would no longer be significant\r\ncompared with the day to day errors involved. This would be\r\nrefiected in the quantity \u201c I \u201d. But the relevant figures for the\r\nIrving sittings show more significant values here than for the earlier\r\nThomas experiment. It is true that somewhat different words were\r\nused, and that the improvement is probably due to the smaller\r\n143] Some Comments on Mr Maby's \u201c Further Note \u201d 535\r\nintervals between sittings ; but \u201c exhaustion \u201d is certainly contraindicated.\r\n7. Telepathy : I naturally cannot deny that telepathy in a broad\r\nsense was taking place, though I have no reason to suppose that it was, and I should certainly challenge at least the first of Mr Maby\u2019s\r\nsuppositions. I am not sure whether telepathy ever takes place at\r\naU ; if it does, and if in these cases it has done so very freely (so that\r\nMrs Leonard may be regarded as sharing, as it were, in the mental\r\ncontent of Mr Thomas and Mr Irving), surely we would expect that\r\nshe would feel the effect, so to speak, of the ideas which determine\r\nthe lengths of their reaction times and produce somewhat similar\r\nresults ; which she does not. If she did, it would constitute positive\r\nand very remarkable evidence of telepathic intercourse ; her failure\r\nto do so does not prove that nothing of the kind took place, but it does seem to me to render very much more difficult the task of those\r\nwho seek to attribute the effects observed to telepathic action.\r\nAccording to IVIr Maby, as I understand him, we must suppose that\r\nMr Thomas and Mr Irving have something in the nature of secondary\r\npersonahties of their own tucked away in their minds (\u201c segregated \u201d)\r\nand that these supply Mrs Leonard telepathically not only with\r\nresponses but with hesitations and failures in reproduction other\r\nthan those characterising the main personalities. I do not say it is impossible, but it does seem rather far-fetched, and quite mmecessary.\r\n8. If it \u201c appears \u201d from quantitative analysis that the three cases mentioned by Mr Maby are identical, then evidently the method in\r\nquestion is incapable of distinguishing between them, and if we have\r\nindependent reason for beheving them to be distinct this will be\r\nto the discredit of the method concerned. But perhaps I have misunderstood the point. If it be asked whether I think that quantitative methods of some kind would be capable of making the distinction required, then surely the answer is that, if they cannot, the\r\ndistinction is without validity. A quantitative element of some kind\r\nmust, I think, enter mto any method capable of yielding valid\r\nresults, if only to the extent of telhng us the likelihood of the\r\ndifferences between our various observations being due to chance.\r\nBut if it be asked whether the particular methods I have hitherto\r\nemployed will be capable of doing this, I can only say that I cannot\r\ntell at the present stage ; broadly speaking, I should expect them\r\nto do so, provided we include such extensions as those used in\r\nsections 29 to 32 of Q.S.T.P. II. Elaboration is likely to be necessary,\r\nif only because an experiment which can only yield one of two an- swers {e.g., \u201c same \u201d or \u201c different \u201d) cannot distinguish between\r\nthree or more possibihties.\r\n9. Verbal responses : The fact that I have hitherto published\r\n2n\r\n536 Whately Carington [part 143]\r\nnothing much about these should not be taken as indicating that I underestimate their importance. Actually I have spent scores of\r\nhours work on them, but have repeatedly been driven back by myinability to find a system of classification which satisfies me on the\r\ntwo counts of being both unambiguous and informative. I have\r\nbeen trying to penetrate to the kind of way in which the mind re- sponsible for the reactions works\u2014the relational thought-structure, as it were, underlying them ; if I could do this, I feel I noight be\r\nable to determine whether the responses of Leonard and John, say, were produced by the same type of mind, and that this would be\r\nimportant ; but it is very difficult. One or two points of interest have emerged, of which the most\r\nremarkable perhaps is the very strong tendency of Normal Leonard\r\nto react with words evidently determined by stock phrases, chches,\r\nand compound words. This suggests to me the raising of a kind\r\nof shield or barrier from which the stimuli glance off without penetrating at all deeply, and behind which the true psychic life goes on\r\nundisturbed. Feda, again, seems noteworthy for the sharpness of\r\nher imagery\u2014a kind of pictorial attitude, so to speak ; one can\r\nalmost, to put it colloquially, see her visualising the scene which the\r\nword suggests.\r\nIt seems possible that further work on these lines, if I can hit on\r\nthe right plan for conducting it, may throw much light on the\r\nessential nature of the personalities concerned ; but the requisite\r\ninspiration is hard to come by.\r\nIn conclusion : Mr Maby is undoubtedly right in insisting on the\r\nvalue of other-than-quantitative methods ; certainly we need all the weapons in our armoury to deal with the problems before us, and I am only too delighted that he, or others, should bring every\r\ndevice that ingenuity can suggest or virtuosity command to bear on the interpretation of the facts I have obtained. But as regards\r\nthese facts themselves, and the methods used to gain them, I do\r\nnot think there is much room for doubt. It is perfectly true, of\r\ncourse, that if I were to plan the whole experiment over again I might do slightly better as a result of past experience ; but I do not\r\nthink that the results would be appreciably different, except perhaps\r\nfor being of the same kind but rather more emphatic. At the sametime I cannot fail to appreciate the great amount of trouble taken\r\nby Mr Maby in elaborating the various points which he has raised, even though I am not at all persuaded that any conclusion I have\r\nreached is adversely affected by them.\r\nON \u201c THE QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF TRANCE\r\nPERSONALITIES \u201d\r\nBy Hereward Carrington\r\nThe two contributions by Mr Wbately Carington, dealing with this\r\nsubject, are doubtless of first-rate importance. His doctrine of \u201c countersinularity \u201d between medium and control is psychologically\r\nvaluable\u2014though clearly predicted by Professor Flournoy,^ and to\r\nsome extent by Mr Whately Carington himself in his original paper\r\nupon the subject {Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxxi., pp. 401-16). His\r\nfindings would seem to indicate that his original theory was to some\r\nextent erroneous, and that (partly in consequence of this) our own\r\nfindings were erroneous also\u2014as set forth in Bulletin I. of the A.P.I.\r\nIt is in this connection that I venture a few words of comment upon\r\nMr Whately Carington\u2019s conclusions.\r\nWhile it is now contended that the regular Controls (Feda, Uvani,\r\netc.) are probably subconscious personifications, it is freely admitted\r\nthat other alleged Communicators do not appear to be so. My own\r\nconclusions hi this connection were surely tentative enough. I said : \u201c As to the ultimate nature of \u2018 Uvani \u2019 I do not pretend to\r\nspeak. I can only say that our experiments seem to indicate . . . the mental independence of a so-called \u2018 spirit control \u2019\r\n. . .\u201d etc. Elsewhere I said : \u201cIn mediumistic cases we seem to deal with\r\na perhaps fictitious personality which is nevertheless in touch or contact, in some mysterious way, with another (spiritual) world,\r\nfrom which it derives information, and through which genuine\r\nmessages often come \u201d (pp. 72-73).\r\nIt can hardly be contended, therefore, that the main conclusions\r\nof our Report have been invalidated by these newer findings : on\r\nthe contrary, they seem to have been confirmed by them. Our own\r\nopinion was that the responses from the Communicators were far\r\nmore striking and conclusive than those from the regular Controls.\r\nIt is to be noted that Mr Carington, in his last Report, based his\r\nconclusions almost entirely upon reaction times\u2014leaving out of\r\naccoimt the galvanic deflections on the one hand and the words\r\nthemselves on the other.\r\nBut does this procedure give us a fair picture of the whole case ? Take the Gatty experiment, e.g., to which Mr Carington (very\r\nrightly) attaches great importance. Gatty (0) and Gatty (H) were\r\n1 In his Spiritism and Psychology (Trans, by H. C.), 1911, pp. 193-94. 537\r\n538 Hereward Carrington [part\r\nfound to differ from one another as greatly as two individuals would.\r\nVery good. But did either Gatty (0) or Gatty (H) furnish any\r\ndefinitely supernormal information ? They certainly did not. They\r\nfurnished memories and associations quite in keeping with their\r\nown past lives. One can quite understand how a medium\u2019s subconscious mind could concoct hypothetical reactions from some\r\nfictitious personality (such as Mr Pickwick, for example), or even from some historic character\u2014assuming he knew even the smatterings of history. But how could it accurately concoct and supply us\r\nwith a series of typical and personal reactions, seemingly emanating\r\nfrom some person who actually existed (but whom the medium had\r\nnever seen), which were afterwards checked by members of the family\r\nand found by them to be strikingly appropriate and eminently\r\ncharacteristic ? There is the crux ! It might be contended that this material was in the sitter\u2019s mind,\r\nand hence obtained from it by means of telepathy. (I understand\r\nthat this is Dr Rhine\u2019s contention.) But Mr Carington\u2019s experiments\r\nin this direction seem to indicate very clearly that telepathy played no part in them, and he so stated.\r\nWe may be willing to grant any amount of play-acting ability on\r\nthe part of the subconscious mind of the medium. But that does\r\nnot alter our main problem, viz.. Why are the responses invariably\r\ntypical of the right person ? Or, as the Rev. Drayton Thomas put it\r\n:\r\n\u201c ... all that we have found seems to favour the supposition that\r\nwith change of control there comes into operation a differently\r\ncomposed mind and menioryC (Italics mine.)\r\nThe association words we received seemed quite characteristic\r\nand typical of the personalities involved in life, as subsequently\r\nverified by friends and relatives known to them when living. All\r\nthis is very different from the Gatty (H) = Gatty (0) material,\r\ninteresting as this is from the psychological point of view.\r\nIn short, as I stated in our Report\r\n;\r\n\u201c It would thus seem that the reaction words are, in a sense, a\r\nfar better indicator of the actual state of affairs than are the\r\ngalvanic reflexes [or reaction times] which were treated statistically.\u201d\r\nThis conclusion seems to have been amply borne out by Mr\r\nThomas\u2019s results, in which some highly characteristic reactions were\r\nalso obtamed, judged by the words alone.\r\nThis personal and identifying material seems to me to have been\r\nunduly slighted by Mr Carmgton, in both his original Reports, and\r\nalso in his review of our Bulletin, as I have already indicated in the\r\nJournal.\r\nA final word in conclusion. Certam critics of jisychical research\r\nare constantly contending that psychiatrists are the only persons\r\n143] On \u201c The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities \u201d 539\r\ncapable of judging our results adequately, and that from tbeir work\r\nalone may really frrdtful results ever be obtained.\r\nI ask one question, in reply. Do sucb critics believe that genuinely\r\nsupernormal phenomena have ever really been obtained 1 And\r\ndo they beheve that the theoretical possibility of \u201c communication \u201d\r\nshould at least be left an open question ? If not, then there is of course no use for further discussion. But if so, then it is my opinion\r\nthat a man like, e.g., Dr Hodgson knew more about psychical and\r\ntrance phenomena than all the psychiatrists in the world\u2014inasmrich\r\nas their whole theory is based upon the non-existence of these supernormal phenomena. I can see no reason, therefore, to kow-tow to\r\ntheir opinions in the shghtest degree, or to beheve that their esti- mates of psychic phenomena are any more valuable than those of\r\nother men. Indeed, if genuine supernormal phenomena exist, they\r\nare usually less so. Therefore, while it is doubtless true that both psychical researchers\r\nand psychiatrists might benefit greatly from a mutual knowledge of\r\neach other\u2019s work, it is not logical to contend that either of them\r\nis entitled to pass final judgment upon the results of the researches\r\nin the other\u2019s field. No one branch or science may hope to solve the problems of\r\npsychical research\u2014though every branch has its contributions to\r\nmake, once its exponents accept the reahty of psychic phenomena !\r\nEEPLY TO MR HEREWARD CARRINGTON\u2019S NOTE\r\nBy Whately Carington\r\nThere is so little that is controversial between Mr Hereward Carrington and myself that httle is called for beyond a friendly acknowledgment of his remarks.\r\nThe only major exception seems to be that whereas, in his Bulletin,\r\nhe concluded pretty definitely, albeit cautiously, that \u201c Uvani \u201d was an mdependent entity (unless I quite misunderstood the general\r\ntenor of his remarks), I am equally confident that the personality\r\nconcerned is a countersimilar secondary. But he would almost\r\ncertainly have come to the same conclusion as I did, on the basis of\r\nhis own material (Cf. my RN 19.1), if he had been able to subject\r\nit to the same statistical tests. On the other hand, it is not quite correct to suggest that \u201c while\r\nthe regular Controls (Feda, Uvani, etc.) are probably subconscious\r\npersonalities, it is freely admitted \u201d (by me) \u201c that the other alleged\r\nCommunicators do not appear to be so \u201d. I am by no means satisfied that John, Etta, Dora and Mr Hereward Carrmgton\u2019s Communicators are not \u201c subconscious personafities \u201d\r\nof some sort. What I said was that they do not appear to be countersimilar secondaries ; but I went on to remark that \u201c . . . Communicators, if and\r\nin so far as they are not what they purport to be, are more in the\r\nnature of histrionic poses than secondary personafities in the\r\nordinary sense of that term \u201d (Q.S.T.P. II., p. 342). This is reasonably non-committal, but a long way from contendiag or admittmg that the personafities concerned are not\r\n\u201c subconscious\r\npersonafities \u201d with the implication that they are what they claim\r\nto be.\r\nAs regards the points raised by Mr Carrington with respect to\r\nsupernormal information and the character of the response words : Broadly speaking I agree with all that he says, but the first takes\r\nus clean outside the field in which I have been working and into that\r\nof psychical research generally ; while the second involves diffi- culties from the point of view of quantitative treatment which I have\r\nmentioned in my Comments on Mr Maby\u2019s Note. But, although in\r\nmy review I drew attention to the striking nature of some of the\r\nresponses obtained by Mr and Mrs Carrington, I must confess that\r\nin my concentration on the instrumental and quantitative aspects\r\nof the case I was inclined to do them less than justice. I do not\r\nthink it sensible to dismiss such responses with a vague appeal to\r\n540\r\n[part 143 541\r\n] Reply to Mr Hereward Carrington\u2019\u2019 s Note\r\n\u201c telepathy \u201d\r\n; for, if telepathy occurs at all, it seems to me to open\r\nthe door to the praeter-physical generally so wide that our chief concern should be not with deciding between the terms of the\r\nantithesis \u201c Telepathy-Communicator \u201d, but with epistemological\r\nconsiderations as to whether there is any real distinction between\r\nthem other than that created by our traditional habits of thought.\r\nBut in self-defence, I think I may fairly claim that, so far as my\r\nown work is concerned, I have expressly and specifically been dealmg\r\nwith the quantitative study of trance personalities, whereas this\r\nwhole question of responses remains, so far, almost wholly in\r\nquahtative field.\r\nNOTE ON PROFESSOR THOULESS\u2019S REVIEW OF\r\nEXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION\r\nBy Dr J. B. Rhine\r\nWhile deeply appreciative of the attention and criticism Professor\r\nThouless has given my volume, I find it necessary to correct the\r\ngeneral impression which his review (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. xliii., p. 24)\r\ngives as to the principal contribution of the work, and to consider a few other points of the review.\r\nProfessor Thouless states ; \u201c The novelty of Dr Rhine\u2019s results\r\nlies in his apparent demonstration that this power is not uncommon\r\nand it is here that his evidence is quite inadequately stated.\u201d I call especial attention to the fact that this emphasis on frequency is the\r\nreviewer\u2019s point of view, not that of the book reviewed. Nowhere,\r\nI think, is this to be found m the book. Certainly its list of conclusions and suggestions are silent on the point. It is therefore\r\nhardly to be held accountable for the failure to present detailed\r\ndescriptions essential only to such a point of view.\r\nAfter reporting in detail on the first three of the eight principal\r\nsubjects, I expressly excused myself (page 88) from further repetition, and thereafter omitted description of conditions except where\r\nnew experiments were involved. The frequency question was never an outstanding one to us, and, furthermore, the report had to be\r\nlimited in length.\r\nIt was plain to me that those left unconvinced by the work of\r\nLinzmayer, Stuart and Pearce, for which details were relatively fully\r\ngiven, would not be convinced by mere repetition of similar details\r\nof the other work. And, so far as the other subjects go, most of\r\nthem worked in special experiments, the conditions of which are given in the book, and which go considerably beyond the minima\r\nrequired by Professor Thouless. For example, three of the five\r\nremaining were successful subjects in distance telepathy tests, a\r\nfourth in DT. Both of these conditions exceed limits laid down by\r\nProfessor Thouless. This leaves only one whose capacity for extrasensory perception may be regarded as not fully accounted for by\r\nthe report of conditions. But as stated, it was not intended that\r\nevery subject should be given an independent case. We were working for bigger stakes than frequency of distribution of E.S.P. ability.\r\nOur objective was to try to explain it as far as possible.\r\nIn the judgment of most critics the \u201c novelty \u201d of the Duke work\r\nlies in its experimental separation for the first time of telepathy and\r\n542\r\n[part 143] Note on Professor Thoiiless\u2019s Review 543\r\nclairvoyance, and of their independent demonstration. It is much\r\nmore novel than the number of subjects foimd. Estabrooks and\r\nCoover both used college students for subjects as was done at Duke,\r\nand in both these cases too the positive deviations were contributed\r\nby many individuals. The only novel feature m the Duke work in\r\nrelation to the number of subjects was the fact that the better\r\nscoring subjects were followed up further.\r\nProfessor Thouless rejects one of the most important points of the\r\nbook because he uses, I think, an inadequate method for evaluating\r\nthe significance of the results. I refer here to the remarkable fact\r\nthat all our eight major subjects showed both clairvoyant and\r\ntelepathic ability, and reached under comparable conditions approximately similar score-levels. These facts along with others\r\npresented in the book suggest strongly that there is some basic\r\nrelation between the two phenomena. This would be a most\r\nimportant relation if true. I had not regarded the case as doubtful\r\nenough to require statistical support, but Professor Thouless apparently does. First he unfortunately overlooked a footnote (page 148)\r\nentered to show that the eighth subject at last showed both abilities. Second, the method he uses is not capable of efficient evaluation of\r\nthe probability of the coincidences.\r\nIf a mathematical basis is needed for judgment of this relationship\r\nthe treatment should be applied to all the facts available. First,\r\nwhat is the probability that, assuming no known relationship between telepathy and clairvoyance, eight ^ principal subjects found\r\npossessing the one capacity will all have measurable capacity for the\r\nother as well ? To compute this it is necessary to estimate how rare good subjects really are, a very difficult matter. If one takes the\r\nhighest possible estimate yet made of such frequency, reflected from\r\nour own experimental study, he might approach the figure that one\r\nin every two persons is telepathic or clairvoyant. Surely, no one will\r\ninsist on a greater frequency. But even with one half as the probability estimate, the eight cases give odds of 255 to 1 , against a chance\r\ntheory of the coincidence of telepathic and clairvoyant capacities\r\nbeing found in the same individuals. This is itself a significant\r\nrelationship. If now a more conservative estimate of the frequency of\r\ngood subjects is taken, the signiflcance soars into huge figures at once.\r\nIf we wish to concern ourselves fmther with the closeness for\r\neach subject of the averages for the two test conditions, the fact\r\nthat in five out of the eight subjects the average scores per rmi for\r\nboth telepathy and clairvoyance fell upon the same unit, and in\r\nonly two cases was there more than a unit\u2019s difference, offers further\r\n^ The facts in the eighth case arrived late and were inserted as footnotes,\r\npp. 92 and 148. (In the Enghsh Edition, Faber and Faber, pp. 124 and 202.)\r\n544 Dr J. B. Rhine [part 143]\r\nsupport to the finding stated above. If the differences between the\r\naverages for P.C. and P.T. are treated by finding the ratios of the\r\ndifferences to the standard error of the difference of the average\r\ndeviations from the theoretical mean, the result is that six of the\r\neight show insignificant differences, and the totals for the eight\r\nsubjects make another, or seven in nine examples. It is also noteworthy that the two cases in which the differences are significant\r\nbelong to the three examples in which the data for both P.C. and\r\nP.T. could not be limited to the same period.\r\nFinally, it should be added that, for the two subjects in which\r\ncomparable daily fluctuations were available, in all but four in\r\nfourteen fluctuations the scores rose and fell in both the P.C. and\r\nP.T. together.\r\nIn the chapter devoted to this comparison other evidences are given which support the view that there is close fundamental\r\nrelationship between P.C. and P.T., such as similar effects with\r\ncertain drugs taken by the subjects, with distance intervening\r\nbetween percipient and the perceived, and others.\r\nPerhaps it may be pardonable to re-state here what the objectives\r\nof the Duke work actually are. The chief aim is, beyond the\r\nseparating out and clarifying of the basic phenomena of extrasensory perception, to find out their relations to each other, to the\r\nrest of the mental, organic, and physical universe. As such it is a\r\npart of a broad scheme (too broad for an individual, of course) to\r\nfind the boundaries and the powers of human personality as a natural\r\nsystem, for what they may be worth to human life. In the book here discussed, it was myhope not so much to estabhsh\r\nits points with absolute finahty, by one stroke, in so difiicult a field,\r\nbut to effect some approaches which may warrant the help of others\r\nin the independent repetition which must precede wide acceptance.\r\nIf these reports can but stimulate repetition with a moderately sympathetic attitude I shall be content. I have to thank Mr Tyrrell\r\nfor so ably helping toward that end with his ingenious technique.\r\nI take this opportunity to endorse heartily Mr Tyrrell\u2019s view of\r\nthe importance of \u201c atmosphere \u201d. Favourable mental attitude is essential to success in many delicate human activities ; precautions,\r\nof course, are essential to safe conclusions. With patience they can\r\nbe brought into mutual harmony. But not all of us have the\r\npatience and others of us have personahties which through suggestion create unfavourable mental states in their subjects. Such\r\ninhibiting effects are not hmited to the parapsychical field but are matters of common observation.\r\nFor the review as a whole and the excellent analysis of Coover\u2019s\r\nwork I am much indebted to Professor Thouless and the Proceedings.\r\nPKOFESSOR CUMMINS\u2019S \u201c NOTES ON \u2018 WALTER \u2019 THUMBPRINTS \u201d\r\nSome confusion appears to have arisen among persons not familiar\r\nwith the technique of finger-print investigation by the use by\r\nProfessor Harold Cummins, the author of \u201c Notes on \u2018 Walter \u2019 Thumbprints of the \u2018 Margery \u2019 Seances \u201d in Part 139 of our Proceedings, of the term \u201c rod core \u201d as apphed to the negative wax\r\nimpressions inspected by him on his visit to England in August 1934.\r\nIt appears to have been thought that, as a negative impression\r\nreproduces the features of the original in reverse, converting ridges\r\ninto furrows and vice versa, a negative described as having a rod\r\ncore must derive from an original having the opposite type of core known as a \u201c staple core To dispel this confusion Professor Cummins has contributed a supplementary note explaining in detail the way in which negative\r\nimpressions are described by experts ; this note is preserved at the\r\nSociety\u2019s Rooms. The gist of Professor Cummins\u2019s note may be\r\nbriefly summarised in his own words, as follows : \u201c Finger-print science follows the practice of describing pattern\r\ndetails in terms of ridges of the actual skin (registered by furrows in\r\nthe plastic negative)\u201d, and again, \u201c Recognised practice consistently\r\ndescribes core structures (and all other minutiae as well, such as endings, forks, inclosures, islands) in terms of the actual skin,\r\nirrespective of the type of impression mider examination. ... I say\r\nagain that the \u2018 Walter \u2019 prints in question have rod cores, and that\r\nin this feature as well as other jDattern details they are identical with\r\nthe \u2018 Kerwin \u2019 (Dr \u2018 X \u2019) right thumb.\u201d\r\n545\r\nREVIEW\r\nJ. C. Flugel, a Hundred Years of Psychology. London : Duckworth,1933, pp. 384. 15s. net. Knowledge of any science is incomplete unless the story of its origin and development is also known. At the present day, wheninterest in psychology is so widespread, a book such as Professor\r\nFlugel has here given us should be welcomed by all who desire to\r\nknow what the problems of psychology are and how they have beendealt with in the past and in our own times. The origins of the\r\nscience of psychology are to be found further back than a himdredyears ago, and Dr Flugel approaches his task by describing briefly\r\nthe kind of knowledge of the mind that might have been attained bya student at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Havingindicated the state of psychology in 1833, he goes on to describe its development up to 1933 when this book was first published, and in\r\ndoing so he gives an admirable account of the influences that havebeen at work in the formation and growth of the various schools\r\nof psychological thought which exist at the present time.\r\nAmong these influences are to be found the physiological re- searches concerning the relations of mind and body, the attempts\r\nto correlate mental and nervous functioning from the days of the\r\nphrenologists up to the most recent work on cerebral localisation,\r\nthe physiological psychology of sensation and the sense organs, and\r\nthe data derived from the study of abnormal mental states. In the course of this exposition more or less detailed reference is made to some of the topics which have been investigated by our\r\nSociety, such as hypnotism and the psychology of subliminal states,\r\nbut only once is there any mention of Psychical Research. In his\r\ndescription of the part played by Phrenology in directing men\u2019s\r\nminds to a search for some specific form of psycho-physical correlation Dr Flugel says that in the first half of the nineteenth century\r\n\u201c phrenology w\u2019-as, as some of the historians of psychology have well\r\nsuggested, somewhat in the position of psychical research to-day.\r\nIts claims seemed, on general scientific grounds, unlikely to be true,\r\nbut had aroused great popular interest and belief and had not as yet\r\n546\r\n[PAET 143] Review 547\r\nbeen confronted with any evidence that could be said to amount to\r\ndefinite disproof. It was, moreover, frowned on by the principal\r\nauthorities, both in psychology and physiology, and therefore never became in any sense one of the recognized teachings of academic\r\nscience.\u201d\r\nAlthough it is admitted that \u201c phrenology has been psychology\u2019s\r\ngreat faux fas \u201d, yet a chapter is devoted to an account of its doctrines, because they undoubtedly influenced indirectly the development of psychological investigation. It may be a want of foresight on the part of Dr Flugel that he does not recognize the possible\r\ninfluence of psychical research on the future of psychology, but there seems no reason for his neglect of the part it has already played in\r\nthe investigation of certain unusual phenomena of the human muid.\r\nBut criticism of Dr Flugel\u2019s sins of omission is forestalled by his\r\ndisarming admission in the opening words of his preface : \u201c Such a book as this is almost inevitably bad ; in the sense at least that\r\nwhat the reader will find will not correspond to what he hopes for or expects.\u201d On the contrary Dr Flugel may rest assured that his\r\nreaders, whether they find what they expect or not, far from considering it a bad book, cannot fail to recognize how good it is. To\r\nthe student it will prove an invaluable guide to the many \u201c schools\r\n\u201d\r\nthat exist at the present time, and he will share Dr Flugel\u2019s hope\r\nthat some day \u201c there may come into being one \u2018 psychology \u2019 with\r\nmany methods, in place of the several \u2018 psychologies \u2019 that exist\r\nto-day.\u201d\r\nT.
