Hindmaifh's ~ellers\nto Dr. Prieflley, p. 2 81, &c. what is there\nadvanced on this fubjc&. \u00b7 \u00b7\n\"CorrefpondLnCe in general may be de-\nfined, the relation fuhfifling between the\netr~nce of a thing and it's form, or be-\ntween the caufe and it\u2022s .elfett ; thus the\nwhole natural world correfponds to the ..\nfpiritual world; the .body of a man, with\nall it's parts, correfponds to his foul ; and\nthe literal fenfe ofthe Word correfponds to\nit's fpiritual fenfe. So that wherever there\nis a correfpondence, there is neceffarily\nimplied fuch an union between two things,\nas only takes place when the one is derived\nfrom the other, in the fame manner as an\neffecl is derived from it's efficient caufe, or\nas fpeech is derived from thought, and the\ngdtures of the body from the atfcchons of\nthe mind; in all which cafes the exterior\nforms can no more be feparated from the\ninterior efft:nces, without lofing their exift-\nence, than the body of a man can be fepa-\nrated from his foul without death. Such\nis the nature and power of correfpondences.\nLet us now fee whether the fame may be\nfaid of mere figure and metaphor.\n\u00b7 \"A mere\n\"' ,o,,Googk\n\fPREFACE. v\n\"A mere figure or metaphor is the Te-\nfemblance, in fome certain way, which one\nthing bears to another, not according to\nthe true nature and. firnefs of things, fo\nmuch as by the arbitrary choice ofa fpeaker\nor writer, who is \u00b7defirous ofilluflrating his\nfubjeCl:, ,and rendering it familiar to the\ncomprehenfion. Confequemly there is no\nneceffary union between the fubjed and the\nfigure, nor is the one an effeet of the other,\n. or in any wife dependent on it for it's\nexi!lence and fubfiftence, as is the cafe in\nall correfpondences. An example will il-\nluftrate the truth ofmy obfervation. Virgil;\nin his lEneid, lib. ii. likens the deftrutl:ion\nof Troy, with her lofty fpires, to the\u00b7fall of\nan aged oak, on being hewn down by the\nwoodman's hatchet. This is a fimile, or\nfigure, but not a correfpondence; for there\nis no neceffary conneccion between the city\nof Troy and a mountain oak, nor between\nher lofty fplres and the wide extending\nbranches of a tree. The 011e is not \u2022within\n\u00b7 the other, as it's life and foul; n~r can the\nrclationfhip fubfifting between. them be\nconfidered like that of caufe and effeCl:, ef..\nfence and form, prior and pofieriol'; foul\nand body, which neverthelefs, as before\u00b7\nobferved, is the cafc with all true corre-\nfpondenccs,\n\"The\no,.,,.ob,Googk\n\fvi PREFACE.\ncc The difference between a mere figure\nandacorrefpondence mayagainappt\"arfrom\nthe following confideration. A mere figure\n'Or fimile is the refemblance which one na'-\ntural objed: or circumftance is fuppofed to\nbear to another natural object or circum-\nftance; whereas a correfpondence is the\nadual relation fubfifting between a natural\nobjcd: arid afpirit11al fubjetl:, or a natural\nform and a fpiritu11\/ effence ; that is, be-\ntween 011\/er and inner, lower and higher, na-\nture andfpiril, and not between nature and\nnature, or.fpirit and.fpirit. This di.ftinc-\ntidh fuould be well attended to. The lan-\nguage of correfpondences is the language\nof God himfelf, being that in which he .\nalways fpeaks, both in his Word and in his\nworks: but figure and metaphor, together\nwith the language of fable, are the mere\ninventions of man, which took thdr rife\nwhen the divine fcience ofcorrefpondences\nbegan to be loft in the world.,''-See th~\nPreface to the Hieroglyphic Key.\nThis being the firft DIE1io11ary of Cor-\nrefpondenret publifhed in the Englifh lan-\nguage, the reader muft not expect to find it\na complete or perfect work; for it is only\nintended as a fmall portable affiftant to\n. thofe who arc defirous of improving them-\nfelves in the fcience of correfpondences.\nJt,is ttue, indeed, that in the Magazine of\nKnowledge\no,.,,.ob,Googk\n\fPREFACE. vii:\nKnwledg1 coneerning H1aw11 antl Hell, &c.\na work of this kind was firft undertaken\nby R.
