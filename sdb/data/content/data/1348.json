The parts of this inge-\nnious art, are principally four.\nFirft, In conveyance of balls.\nSecondly, In conveyance of money,\nThirdly, In cards,\nFourthly, In confederacy.\nA Defcription of the Operator.\ni. He mull be one of a bold and undaunt-\ned refolution, fo as to fet a good face upon\nthe matter.\n2.\nHe muft have ftrange terms, and empha-\ntical words, to grace and adorn his actions\n;\nand the more to amaze and aftonifli the be-\nholders.\n3.\nAnd laftly, He muft ufe fuch geftures\nof body, as may take off the fpedlators eyes\nfrom\n\f8 The Art of Legerdemain;\nfrom a ftrict and diligent beholding his man-\nner of performance.\nHow to pafs the Balls through the Cups.\nYou muft place yourfelf at the farther end\nof the table, and then you muft provide your-\nfelf three cups made of tin, and then you\nmuft have your black fticks of magic to fhew\nyour wonders withal : then you muft provide\nfour fmall cork balls to play with ;\nbut do not\nlet more than three of them be feen upon\nthe table.\nNote, Always conceal one ball in the right\nhand, between your middle finger and ring\nfinger : and be fure make yourfelf perfect to\nhold it there, for by this means all the tricks\nof the cups are done.\nThen fay as followeth.\nGentlemen,\nthree cups Pis true,\nThey are but tin,\nthe reafon why,\nSilver is fomething dear,\nTil turn them in gold, if I live, &c.\nNo equivocation at all\n:\nBut ifyour eyes are not as quick as my hands\nIJhall deceive you all.\nView them within,\nView them all round about,\nWhere there is nothing in.\nThere's nothing can come out.\nThen\n\fOr, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 9\nThen take your four balls privately be-\ntween your fingers, and fo fling one of them\nupon the table, and fay thus,\nThe firfl trick that e'er I learn'd to do,\nWas, ont of one ball to make it into two :\nAhl fince it cannot better be,\nOne of thefe two, I'll divide them into three,\nWhich is call'd the firft trick of dexterity.\nSo then you have three balls on the table\nto play with, and one left between the fin-\ngers of your right hand.\nThe Operation of the Cups is this.\nLay your three balls on the table, then\nfay, Gentlemen, you fee here are three balls,\nand here are three cups, that is, a cup for\neach ball, and a ball for each cup. Then tak-\ning that ball that you had in your right hand,,\n(which you are always to keep private) and\nclapping it under the firft cup, then taking up\none of the three balls, with your right hand,,\nfeeming to put it into your left hand, but re-\ntain it ftill in your right, fhutting your left\nhand\n\fio The Art of Legerdemain;\nhand in due time, then fay, Prefio be gone.\nThen taking the fecond cup up, fay, Gen-\ntlemen, you fee there is nothing under my\ncup; fo clap the ball that you have in your\nright hand under it, and then take the fecond\nball up with your right hand, and feem to put\nit into your left, but retain it in your right\nhand, fhutting your left hand in due time, as\nbefore, faying, Verda,\nbe gone.\nmm\nH i\nwf \u2022\nThen take the third cup, faying, Gentle-\nmen, you fee there is nothing under my laft\ncup; then clapping the ball you have in your\nright hand under it, then take the third ball\nup with your right hand, and feeming to put it\ninto your left hand, but retain it in your right;\nfhutting your left hand in due time, as be-\nfore, faying, Prefio,\nmake hafte\n;\nfo you have\nyour three balls come under your three cups,\nas thus; and fo lay your three cups down on\nthe table.\nThen\n\fOr, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. u\nThen with your right hand take up the firft\ncup, and there clap that ball under, that you\nhave in your right hand; then faying, Gen-\ntlemen, this being the firft ball, I will put it\ninto my pocket; but that you muft ftill keep\nin your hand to play withal.\nSo take up the fecond cup with your right\nhand, and clap that ball you have concealed\nunder it, and then take up the fecond ball\nwith your right hand, and fay, this likewife,\nI take and put into my pocket.\nLikewife, take up the third cup, and clap-\nping the cup down again, convey that ball\nyou have in your right hand under the cup,\nthen taking the third ball, fay, Gentlemen,\nthis being the laft ball, I take and put this\ninto my pocket. Afterwards fay to the com-\npany, Gentlemen, by a little of my fine pow-\nder of experience, I will command thefe balls\nunder the cups again.\nAs\n\f12 The Art of Legerdemain ;\nAs thus,\nSo lay them all along upon the table to the\nadmiration of all the beholders.\nThen take up the firft cup, and clap the\nball you have in your right hand under it,\nthen taking the firft ball up with your right\nhand, feem to put the fame into your left\nhand, but retain it ftill in your right, then\nfay, Vade, quick be gone when I bid you,\nand\nrun under the cup.\nThen taking that cup up again, and fling-\ning that you have in your right hand under\nit, you muft take up the fecond ball, and feem\nto put it into your left hand, but retain it in\nyour right hand, faying, Gentlemen, fee how\nthe ball runs on the table.\nSo feemingly fling it away, and it will ap-\npear as thus.\n\fOr, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 13\nSo taking the fame cup again, then clap-\nping the ball under again as before, then tak-\ning the third ball in your right hand, and feem\nto put it under your left, but ftill retain it in\nyour right, then with your left hand feem to\nfling it in the cup, and it will appear thus; all\nthe three balls to be under one cup.\nAnd if you can perform thefe adlions with\nthe cups, you may change thefe balls into ap-\nples, pears, or plumbs, or to living birds, to\nwhat your fancy leads you to. I would have\ngiven you more examples, but I think thefe\nare fufficient for the ingenious, fo that by\nthefe means you may perform all manner of\naflions with the cups.\nNote, The artificial cups cannot well be\ndefcribed by words but you may have them\nof me, for they are accounted the greateft\nfecrets in this art : therefore I advice you to\nkeep them as fuch, for this was never known\nto the world before.\nHow to fliew the wonderful Magic Lanthorn.\nThis is the magic lanthorn that has made\nfo much wonder in the world, and that which\nFriar Bacon ufed to fhew all his magical won-\nders withal.\nB This\n\f14 The Art of Legerdemain ;\nThis lanthorn is called magic, with refpedt\nto the formidable apparitions that by virtue of\nlight it fhews upon the white wall of a dark\nroom. The body of it is generally made of\ntin, and of the fhape of a lamp; towards the\nback part, is a concave looking glafs of metal,\nwhich may either be fpherical or parabolical,\nand which by a grove made in the bottom of\nthe lanthorn, may either be advanced nearer\nor put farther back from the lamp, in which\nis oil or fpirit of wine, and the match ought\nto be a little thick, that when it is lighted, it\nmay caft a good light that may eafily reflect\nfrom the glafs to the fore part of the lanthorn,\nwhere there is an aperture with the perfpefiive\nin it, compofed of two glaffes that make the\nrays converge and magnify the objeft.\nWhen you mean to make ufe of this admi-\nrable machine, light the lamp, the light of\nwhich will be much augmented by the look-\ning glafs at a reafonable diftance. Between\nthe fore part of the lanthorn, and the perfpec-\ntive glafs, you have a trough made on pur-\npofe, in which you are to run a long flat thin\nframe with feveral different figures, painted\nwith tranfparent colours upon glafs; then all\nthefe little figures paffing fucceflively before\nthe perfpe\u00a3tive glafs through which paffes the\nlight of the lamp, will be painted, and repre-\nfented with the fame colours upon the wall\nof a dark room, in a gigantic and monftrous\nmanner.\nBy\n\fOr, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 15\nBy this Lanthorn you may fhew what man,\nor woman, or birds, or beafts, and all forts of\nfifh that are in the fea : fo if any gentleman\nhas a defire to furnifh themfelves with one of\nthefe lanthorns, I have the beft that can be\nmade.\nThe figitre is as follows.\nTo feem to fwallow a long pudding made of tin.\nThis pudding muft be made of tin, confift-\ning of twelve or thirteen little hoops made as\nin the figure following, fo as they may almoft\nfeem to fall one through another, having little\nholes made at the biggeft end thereof, that it\nmay not hurt your mouth, hold this pudding\nB 2 for\n\f1 6 The Art 0\/ Legerdemain ;\n(for fo it is called) privately in 3\/our left hand,\nwith the hole end uppermoft, and with your\nright hand take a ball out of your pocket,\nand fay, \u2018\nIf here is ever a maid, that has loft\nher maiden head, or an old woman that is out\nof conceit with herfelf, becaufe her neigh-\nbours deem her not fo young as fhe would\nbe, let them come to me, for this ball is a\nprefent remedy:\u2019 then feem to put the ball\ninto your left hand, but let it flip into your\nlap, and clap your pudding into your mouth,\nwhich will be thought to be the ball that you\nfhewed them; then decline your head, and\nopen your mouth, and the pudding will flip\ndown at its full length, which with your right\nhand you may ftrike it into your mouth again,\ndoing this three or four times, then you may\ndifcharge it into your hand, and clap it into\nyour pocket without any fufpicion, by mak-\nin three or four wry faces after it, as tho\u2019\nit ftuck in your throat, and if you pradtife\nfmiting eafily upon your throat with your fift\non each fide, the pudding will feem to chink;\nas if it were lying there ;\nthen fay, \u2018\nThus the)\/\neat puddings in High Germany, they fling it\ndown their throats before their teeth can take\npoffeffion of it.\nme\nTo\n\fOr, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 17\nTo feem to eat knifes andforks.\nDefire any one of the fpe&ators to lend you\na knife, which when you get hold of, fo\nthat you may cover the whole with both\nhands, the end of the haft excepted, and fet-\nting the point to your eye, faying, \u201cSome\nbody ftrike it with your fift,\u201d but nobody\nwill, becaufe it is fo dangerous a thing; then\nfetting your hand on'the fide of the table and\nlooking about you, afk, \u201c What, will nobody\nftrike it in ?\n\u201d in which time let the knife flip\ninto your lap, then make as if you chop it\nhaftily into your mouth, or to hold it with\none hand, and to ftrike it in with the other\nnimbly, making three or four wry faces, fay-\ning, \u201cSome drink, fome drink,\u201d or elfe,\n\u201c Now let fomebody put his finger into my\nmouth, and pull it out again,\u201d fome will cry,\n\u201cYou will bite me,\u201d fay, I will affure you\nI will not :\u201d then when he hath put his finger\nin, he will pull it out and cry, There is no-\nthing ;\nthis is time fufficient to convey the\nknife into your pocket ;\nthen fay, Why, you\nhave your finger again : So by this means you\nmay fwallow knives and forks.\nTo put a lock upon a man's mouth.\nYou muft have a lock made for this pur-\npofe, according to the figure ;\none fide of its\nbow muft be immoveable, as that marked\nB 3 with\n\f18 The Art of Legerdemain;\nwith A, the other fide is noted with B, and\nmuft be pinned to the body of the lock, as\nappears at E, I fay it muft be fo pinned that\nit may play to and fro with eafe ;\nthis fide of\nthe bow muft have a leg as at C, and then\nturn it into the lock ;\nthis leg muft have two\nnotches filled in the inner fide, which muft be\nfo ordered, that one may lock or hold the\ntwo Tides of the bow as clofe together as may\nbe, and the other notch to hold the faid part\nof the bow a proportionable diftance afunder,\nthat being locked upon the cheek, it may nei-\nther pinch too hard, nor yet hold it fo flight\nthat it may be drawn off ;\nlet there be a key\nfixed to it, to unlock it, as you fee at D, and\nlaftly, let the bow have divers notches filled\nin it, fo that the place of the partition when\nthe lock is fhut home, will the leaft of all be\nfufpedled in the ufe of the lock ;\nyou muft get\none to hold a teller edge long between his\nteeth, then take another teller, and with your\nleft hand proffer to fet it edge-ways between\na fecond man\u2019s teeth, pretending that your\nintent is to turn both into which of their\nmouths they fhall defire, by virtue of your\nwords : which he fhall no fooner confent to\ndo, but you by holding your lock privately\nin your right hand, with your fore-finger may\nflip it over his cheek, and lock it by prefling\nyour fore-finger a little down, after fome flore\nof words, and the lock having hung on a\nwhile, feem to pull the key out of his nofe.\nYou\n\fOr, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 19\nYou may have thefe locks neatly made, at\nmy houfe, near the watch-houfe, on little\nTower-hill, Poftern-row, a bookfeller\u2019s fhop.\nHow to Jliew the magic hell and bufhel.\nThis feat may well be called magical, for\nreally it is very amazing, if it be well handled.\nThis device was never known to the public\nbefore.\nThis bufhel muft be turned neatly like\nunto the egg-boxes, fo that they cannot find\nout where it opens, and you muft have a falfe\nlid to clap on and off, and upon that falfe lid\nglew fome bird-feed, and then you muft have\na\n\f20 The Art of Legerdemain ;\na true lid made to clap neatly upon the falfe\none, now you muft have your artificial bell to\nJfhew with your bufhel.\nYou may make your bell with wood, or\nbrafs, your bell muft be made to unfcrew at\nthe top, that it may hold as much feed as\nyour bufhel will when it is filled, and you\nmuft have the handle of your bell made with\na fpring, fo as to let the feed fall down at\nyour word of command.\nThe manner how to ufe them is as follow-\neth : Note you muft be fure to fill the top\nof your bell with feed before you begin to\nfhew, then faying, Gentlemen, you fee I have\nnothing in my bell (which they cannot, if you\nhold it by the handle) nor have I any thing\nin my bufhel, therefore I will fill my bufhel\nwith feed,) and in filling it clap on the falfe\nlid, and no man can tell the contrary.\nThen afk any body in the company to hold\nthat feed in their hands and you will command\nit all under the magical bell, fo clap the true\nlid on, and then ring your bell, and the feed\nwill be gone out of your bufhel into your bell,\nto the admiration of all the beholders.\nIf you cannot rightly conceive this by words\nyou may have them of neweft fafhions, ready\nmade, at my houfe.\nHow\n\fOr, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 21\nHow to put a ring through ones cheek.\nYou muft have two rings made of filver or\nbrafs, or what you pleafe, of one bignefs,\ncolour, and likenefs, faving that one muft have\na notch through, and the other muft be\nwhole, without a notch ;\nfhew the whole ring,\nand conceal that which hath the notch, and\nfay, Now I will put this ring through my\ncheek, and privately flip the notch over one\nfide of your mouth,\nf\nthen take a fmall ftick\nwhich you muft have in readinefs, and flip\nthe whole ring upon it, holding your hand o-\nver it about the middle of the ftick;

This is a merry device.\nTo feem to kill a horfe, and to cure him again.\nTake the feed of henbane, and give it the\nhorfe in his provender, and it will caft him\ninto fuch a deep fleep that he will feem dead;\nand if you will recover him again, rub his\nnoftrils with vinegar and he will be revived a-\ngain.\nA very Jlrange trick,\nwhereby you may feem to\ncut a piece of tape into four parts,\nand make\nit zvhole again with words.\nTake a piece of narrow white tape, about\ntwo or three yards long, firft prefent it to view\nto any that may defire it; then tie both the\nends of it together, and take one fide of it in\none\n\f104 The Art 0\/ Legerdemain ;\none hand, and the other in the other hand fo\nthat the knot may be about the midft of one\nfide, and ufing fome circumftantial words to\nbeguile your fpedtators, turn one hand about\ntoward yourfelf, and the other from you, fo\nfhall you twift the tape once; then clap the\nends together, and then if you flip your fore-\nfinger and thumb of each hand between the\ntape, almoft as one would hold a fkane of\nthread to be wound, this will make one fold\nor twift, as appears where A fignifieth the\ntwift or fold; B the knot; then in like man-\nner\n\fOr,\nHocus Pocus in Perfection. 105\nner make a fecond fold, about the line D. C.\nas you may fee by the fecond figure, where\nB. fignifieth the knot, C. the firft fold, A. the\nfecond fold : hold then the fore-finger and\nthumb of your left hand upon the fecond twift\nand upon the knot alfo, and the fore-finger\nand thumb of your right hand upon the firft\nfold C, and defire fome one of your fpedtators\n\u2022\nto cut all afunder with a fharp knife, at the\ncrofs line E. D. when it is cut, hold ftill your\nleft hand, and let all your ends fall, that you\nhold in your right hand, for there will be a\nfhew of eight ends, four above and four be-\nlow, and fo the firings will be thought to be\ncut into four parts, as may be feen by the\nthird figure; then gather up the ends that\nyou let fall into your left-hand, and deliver\ntwo of the ends, (feeming to take them at\nrandom) unto two feveral perfons, bidding\nthem to hold them fall, ftill keeping your left\nhand fingers upon the twifls or folds; then\nwith your right hand and left hand feem to\ntumble all the ends together that you had in\nyour left-hand, twift out the flips or pieces,\nwhich are three, as you may fee at A. and\nB. in the third figure, twift them all I fay, in-\nto a little ball, and conceal it between fome\nof the fingers of your left-hand, and crum-\nble thereon another confufed heap, and after\nfome words faid, with your right hand deliver\nthis confufed heap unto any one of the com-\npany, bidding him hold it faft, Hulla Paffa,\nthen\n\fio6 The Art of Legerdemain;\nthen bid them look on it, who while they are\ngreedily looking after the event, you with eafe\nconvey the ball or roll of ends into your poc-\nket; fo it will be thought that you have made\nit whole by virtue of your words. An excel-\nlent trick if it be gracefully handled; and a\ntrick that coft me trouble to find.\nA device to multiply one face and make it feem\nto be a hundred or a thoufand.\nThis feat muft be performed by a looking-\nglafs made on purpofe, the figure whereof I\nhave fully defcribed, with the manner of ma-\nking it, which is this ;\nfirft make a hoop, or\nfillet of wood, horn, or fuch like, about the\nwidth of a half crown piece in the circumfe-\nrence; the thicknefs of this hoop, or fillet,\nlet it be about a quarter of an inch; in the\nmiddle of this hoop fatten a bottom of wood\nor brafs, and bore, in a decent order, diverfe\nfmall holes, about the bignefs of fmall peafe,\nthen open the one fide of this bottom, let in a\npiece\n\fOr, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 107\npiece of cryftal-glafs, and faften it in the hoop\nclofe to the bottom, then take a quantity of\nquick-filver, and put fo much into the hoop as\nwill cover the bottom ;\nthen let into the hoop\nanother piece of cryftal-glafs fitted thereto\nand cement the fides, that the quick-filver may\nnot run out, and it is done; the figure where-\nof I have before fet. A. prefenteth the one\nfide that giveth the form of one face to the\nbeholders ? B the other fide that multiplieth\nthe beholders face fo oft as there are holes in\nthe middle bottom. The ufe whereof I fhall\nnot infift upon, fince he that is verfed in the\nformer feats will better conceive of himfelf to\nufe it, than my words can either diredt or af-\nfift him.\nTo make thefulminating or thunderingpowder.\nTake three parts of falt-petre, two parts of\nfait of tartar, and one part of fulphur, pound-\ned and mixed together, heat in a fpoon fix-\nty grains of this compofition, and it will fly a-\nway with a fearful noife, like thunder, as loud\nas a cannon, breaking through the fpoon\nand every thing underneath it, for it exerts\nitfelf downwards, contrary to the nature of\ngun-powder.\nI have here fet down, KIND READER,\nnot only all ufual feats, that either myfelf\nhave feen or heard of, but divers others alfo,\nwhich\n\fio8 The Art of Legerdemain ;\nwhich I am fure were never in print, nor as\nyet performed by any I could ever hear of ex-\ncept myfelf, and all to give thee thy full con-\ntent; and note this from me, if thou rightly\nunderhand this, there is not a trick that any\njuggler in the world can fliew thee, but thou\nfhalt be able to conceive after what manner it\nis performed.\nFINIS.\n\f","_id":1348}
