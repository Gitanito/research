He moved to the UK in 1899 and gained a bachelor\u2019s degree and PhD from the University of Glasgow. He lectured in mechanical engineering at Queen\u2019s University, Belfast from 1912 and published works in that subject.\n\nShortly after he arrived in Belfast, he began a four-year investigation of psychokinetic phenomena reported to occur in a Spiritualist circle. He described these in articles in the Spiritualist periodical Light and in three books: The Reality of Psychic Phenomena (1916), Experiments in Psychical Science (1919), and&nbsp;&nbsp;The Psychic Structures in the Goligher Circle (1921).  Psychical Research\n\nIn 1914, Crawford attended a sitting with Marthe Beraud (also known as \u2018Eva C\u2019), a materialization medium who had been extensively studied in Germany by Albert Schrenck-N\u00f6tzing.1&nbsp; This sitting was unsuccessful. However, later that year Crawford began to work with a Belfast spiritualist circle and reported having witnessed strong physical phenomena.  Death\n\nCrawford committed suicide on July 30 1920 at the age of thirty-nine. His body was found on Pickie Rocks, Bangor; a coronor's report stated that he died by cyanide poisoning.2 Before he died, Crawford sent a letter&nbsp;to David Gow, the editor of the periodical Light, which had published some of his reports, explaining that his collapse was due entirely to overwork:&nbsp;  \n\nMy psychic work was all done before the collapse, and is the most perfect work I have done in my life. Everything connected with it is absolutely correct, and will bear every scrutiny. It was done when my brain was working perfectly, and it could not be responsible for what has occurred\u2026 &nbsp;I wish to reaffirm my belief that the grave does not finish all.3   Goligher Circle\n\nThe Goligher Circle, as it became known, consisted of seven members of the Goligher family in Belfast, all dedicated Spiritualists.4 The famuily held s\u00e9ances in the family home and in Crawford\u2019s own rooms, sitting around a table with red light for illumination. Kathleen Goligher, aged sixteen, appeared to be the main focus of the phenomena, which was shared to a lesser extent by her four sisters. The phenomena reported by Crawford included raps and levitations of the table and household objects.\n\nCrawford attended eighty-seven sittings over two-and-a-half years with the family, convinced that the occurrences were not caused by normal means by any of the people present.5 &nbsp;The author of a later assessment of his work wrote:&nbsp;  \n\nHe had satisfied himself that none of the sitters were physically responsible for the levitations. That is to say, none of them were touching the table. They sat in a circle round it, holding hands or with their hands on their knees. The light was sufficiently good for Crawford not only to be able to verify this, but also to verify that their feet did not touch the table, with one exception. It was difficult to see the feet of the medium which were in shadow, but it seemed impossible that any movement of her feet could be responsible for the remarkable movements of the table; and many subsequent experiments showed this to be the truth.6\n\nVisitors to the sittings testified emphatically both to the strength of the phenomena and to the impossibility that these were caused by fraudulent activity (see here).\n\nExperiments convinced Crawford of the existence of protuberances or \u2018rods\u2019, which were made of some psychic stuff that emanated from Kathleen Goligher\u2019s body and extended to different parts of the room.7 &nbsp;He elaborated on this in his second and third books, of which the latter includes diagrams and photographs.\n\nHe wrote:&nbsp;  \n\nI hold strongly to the opinion that if the processes resulting in the application of psychic force are once really discovered, then the rest of psychic phenomena will rapidly fall into place and be understandable. Psychic energy \u2014as evidenced in good physical s\u00e9ances\u2014is at the root of the whole thing, and it is useless to expect any great advance until its laws have been unravelled.8   EE Fournier d\u2019Albe\n\nIn the year following Crawford\u2019s death, an investigation carried out by EE Fournier d\u2019Albe attempted to verify his findings. After twenty sittings Fournier d\u2019Albe concluded that the levitations had been accomplished by the use of the medium\u2019s legs and that other manifestations were fraudulently produced.9\n\nThese negative findings, combined with the extravagant nature of Crawford\u2019s claims, led to rejection of his books by sceptic commentators.10 Some writers have linked his death to his research, insinuating \u2013 against Crawford\u2019s own statements and other indications \u2013 that he killed himself because he feared the Golighers would be exposed as frauds.11\n\nIn the ensuring controversy, some psychical researchers accepted Fournier d\u2019Albe\u2019s findings while others criticized him for providing insufficient information and for failing to take measures which would have decided the matter more clearly.12\n\nMore details about the Goligher Circle and Crawford\u2019s investigations can be found here.
