I presented some of the\nfacts of this report last spring (June 4th, 1899) before the Cambridge Conferences\n(Massachusetts, U.S.A.)- Though 1 was extremely careful in that address not to\nmake any final choice, any more than I do now, between the alternative theories\nwhich I stated, the facts aroused the usual newspaper interest. I was interviewed\nby reporters to whom I absolutely refused to tell my facts or any settled opinions.\nBut it was immediately published and quoted in the newspapers all over the United\nStates, and in some parts of the United Kingdom, that I proposed to \"scientifically\ndemonstrate the immortality of the soul within a year.\" There is no foundation for\nthe attribution of such a claim to myself. The facts are these : I was seen by only\nfonr or five reporters. I refused absolutely to tell them a single fact in my sittings,\nbut referred them to previous Reports and talked only of the frauds and illusions\nconnected with the subject. In response to the question whether I proposed to\nscientifically demonstrate immortality, I was extremely careful to say, \"No, I do\nnot,\" and stated the alternative theories between which we have to choose. I knew\ntoo well the a priori, standards which characterise the conceptions of those who think\nthey know what a \" scientific demonstration n is, and not only did not claim any such\nt-mciency for my facts, but was emphatic in disclaiming any such pretensions. But\nknowing what impressions widely-circulated statements produce, and that even men\nwho claim to possess scientific intelligence either accept newspaper reports as true or\nsnatch a\u00a3 them for the sake of using a standard for heaping ridicule upon those\nagainst whom they have no facts to produce, I. have also been careful to statu to the\nscientific public in two of its most important publications in America (Science,\nNovember 10th, 1899, Vol. X., p. 695 ; The Ptpcholopical Berietr, January, 1900,\nVol. VII., p. 84) just what I have indicated above. I make no claims to \"scien\ntifically demonstrating\" anything, not even my facts. I have given a preference for\nthe spiritistic theory in explanation of my alleged facts, in ordei to force the issue on\nan important investigation and in order to devolve upon those who have not accepted\nany supernormal phenomena at all the dutv of rescuing me from illusion.\nJ. H. Hvslop.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena, 5\naspects arc not a part of the problem at issue in these experiments.\nWhat '\u25a0 spiritualism \" is in its general aspects I need not care, as there\nare not data in my record to throw any light upon its complexities as\nusually conceived. The issue that is presented here is simply whether\nspiritism or telepathy from living persons exclusivelyi, is the more\nrational hypothesis to account for the facts. Nor need I enter into\nany specific definition as to what shall be meant by spiritism. It is\nfirst only a name for some other hypothesis than telepathy and intended\nto account for the unity and intelligence of the phenomena concerned.\nIt is next only a name for the continuity of the stream of conscious\nness which once passed for a person. Consequently I use the term\nconsistently with either pantheistic monism, or atomistic or monadic\nmonism. Whatever theory we entertain regarding the individuality of\nman, the alternative hypothesis to telepathy, which is here called\nspiritism, must be independent of the question whether the stream of\nconsciousness recognised as personal identity shall be either a mode of\nthe absolute or an individual persistent centre of its own activity.\nConsequently, I shall have in mind, when using the term, the concep\ntion of a surviving consciousness and personal identity which is\nabsolutelv necessary for . the establishment of anything like a true\nspiritism, and thus whollv eliminate all conceptions that are associated\nwith the idea of phenomena originating from some cause merely\ndifferent from the normal and voluntary self. The latter idea\njroes no further than secondary personality, as it is so well known.\nThe former excludes all intrinsic connection between the subject\nthrough which the phenomena are apparently obtained and that which\nis their alleged source. Whether the real source is a surviving soul or\nnot may be discussed without any preconceived theory of what a soul\nmust be. Spiritism, therefore, as an alternative explanation to\ntelepathy, is nothing more than the question whether the brain of the\nmedium is adequate to account for the facts. All other problems may\nbe postponed until we know more than we do now regarding such\nphenomena.\nIn fixing these alternatives, however, 1 am told that I should\ninclude the possibility of fraud, which is simpler than either of the\nothers. My reply is that I shall not discuss that hypothesis at\nlength. I consider it as having been excluded from view as much\nas ten years ago, a'ld no'one except those who have resolutely remained\nignorant of the Society's work in general, and who have not taken\nthe pains to acquaint themselves with the very special precautions\nin regard to this matter in the Piper case, would compromise his\ni I shall throughout this Report use the term \"telepathy\" to denote a process\nbetween living persons only. (See footnote, p. 124.)\n\fb [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nintelligence with that accusation without giving specific proofs of it.\nFor the special benefit of that class, 1 shall refer it to the record which\nshows what means were taken to eliminate this resource for explana\ntion. (Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 437-440, 444-447, 558-560, 615 ;\net al. Vol. VIII., pp. 1-9 ; Vol. XIII., pp. 284-5, and Vol. XIV.,\npp. 7 and 50-78.) Nor is it necessary to resent any insinuations that\nwe are duped, until those who are possessed of so much intelligence\nwithout any previous study of this special instance can produce specific\nevidence that the subject of our investigation exhibits the qualities and\nengages in the kind of work that must be supposed in order to meet the\ncase. It is easy to say \"fraud \" and suggest any number of imaginable\nmethods of deception, as it is known and practised in most that passes\nfor spiritualism. But it is quite a different thing to indicate the exact\nkind of \" fraud \" necessary to reduce the character of a given case.\nThose who are at all acquainted with the conditions and nature of the\nPiper phenomena, and who are not willing to excuse their indolence by\nan appeal to an explanation for which they have no evidence, will very\nquickly discover that there is only one kind of fraud even conceivable\nin the case, and that is the employment of detectives for obtaining infor\nmation. This method will undoubtedly account for the cases with\nwhich the public is usually entertained, but any attempt to applv it to\nthe present instance in detail, taking adequate consideration of the\ncontent of it, will be confronted with assumptions that are about as\nenormous as the spiritistic theory itself. I am not questioning the\nvalue of scepticism in this direction, but only insisting that it lx>\nintelligent and ready to accept the logical consequences of the supposi\ntion that it makes. The accuser does not stop to think of the\nmagnitude of his hypothesis when applied to both the quality and\nquantity of the facts under the conditions involved.\nHut it is not this alone that eviscerates that suspicion of its perti\nnence. We might well admit that both quality and quantity would be\nvitiated by the existence of detective fraud, if that suspicion could be\nlegitimatelv directed against the subject of our experiments. But in\nspite of the care with which the Society's publications have stated the\nconditions under which all arrangements are made for experiments,\nexempting Mrs. Piper from all responsibility for security against sus\npicion, not even the scientific public has yet been intelligent enough\nto discover that it is on an entirely wrong scent. It ought to be\nclear to even the most dull person, who must bear the suspicion of\nfraud, when Dr. Hodgson interposes between the experimenter and\nMrs. Piper, and when he, with the rest of us, subordinates the\nevidential value of any experiments otherwise conducted. The situation\nis such, as the most cursory examination shows, that the notion of\nfraud cannot be entertained without implying the complicity of Dr.\n\fXLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 7\nHodgson. Now Dr. Hodgson is not under the slightest obligation to\nprove his own honesty, or that he is not a fraud himself. Hence it is\nthe duty of the sceptic to prove that there is collusion and dishonesty\non Dr. Hodgson's part when any charge is made against Mrs. Piper.\nMembers of the Society assumed the duty to examine into her relation\nto the phenomena, and having satisfied themselves of her innocence. Dr.\nHodgson has chosen to shelter her behind his own responsibility, so that\nthe man who wishes to cliny to the suspicion of fraud must accept without\nwincing this responsibility for proving his suspicion. The time is past\nwhen we can indulge in the cheap accusation against Mrs. Piper, which\ntries to throw the burden of proof upon us who announce the value of\nour results. But when it is Dr. Hodgson who is the starting point of\nthe experiments, critics must accept the challenge to investigate him, or\nturn their objections to his conclusions in another direction. They\ncannot stand idly by and demand proof for honesty when it is their\nduty to prove dishonesty. If we were dealing only with Mrs. Piper,\nthe case might be different, but, as it is, we can safely leave to critics to\nmake good against Dr. Hodgson the alternative to the hypotheses of\ntelepathy and spiritism.\nIn regard to Dr. Hodgson's relation to the sittings generallv, it will\nbe important for the reader to know that he is not always present at\nthe sittings that he has arranged for, and that some of the best com\nmunications have come to persons who, at the former period when the\ncontrol of Mrs. Piper was not stringent, arranged for themselves and\nwent to her without the knowledge of Dr. Hodgson at all, and reported\nto him afterward (Of. Professor Nichols' case, Proceedings, Vol. XII] .\npp. 374 and 534). At present, in spite of his control of all arrange\nments for sittings, he is often absent from whole series of them, and\nthe fact makes no difference in the content of the communications. In\nmine I insisted on his presence, because I was not familiar with the\nautomatic writing and did not wish to waste time in learning to read\nit. Dr. Hodgson acted as stenographer, so to speak, copying at the\ntime much of the automatic writing, and noting all that was said, or\nflone by both of us and by Mrs. Piper's hand. Any attempt on my\npart to do this without experience would have resulted in much loss of\ntime and increase of confusion in the \"communications,\" owing to the\nnecessity of repeating until I could decipher the writing. But even\nthen Dr. Hodgson was several times sent out of the room by the trance\npersonalities, and his absence showed no effect on the contents of the\n\" communications,\" except perhaps to improve that feature of them\naffecting their relevance, though it took more time for me to read\nthe writing and to obtain a given quantity of material. For\nthe occasions on which Dr. Hodgson was sent out of the room\nand was not present the reader can consult the following references\n\f.\/. \/\/. Hyslop, Ph.D. [part\nto the Appendices and detailed records. (Appendix I., pp. 1$05-306,\n306-308, 309-310. All the lx?st part of this sitting, in so far\nas content is concerned, came while Dr. . Hodgson was out of the\nroom. Appendix III., pp. 420-421). The reader can see for himself\nthat in all the instances the \" communications \" were not interrupted\neither in manner or matter, except so far as I was the cause and so far\nas supersensible causes are assumed, so that no affirmation of their\nentire dependence upon his presence can be made. This is, of course,\nfar truer of others than myself, as he was so often not present even in\nthe house, and the sitter was unknown to Mrs. Piper.\nNor is this all, taking the whole case into account. Professor\nWilliam Jame-s, of Harvard University, exercised more or less super\nvision over Mrs. Piper's trances and introduced unknown sitters as\nearlv as 1885, two years before Dr. Hodgson ever saw the shores of\nAmerica. And, in fact, it was Professor James that made the appoint\nment for Dr. Hodgson's own first sitting. Professor James says of\nthis year, 1885, \"I visited her (Mrs. Piper) a dozen times that winter,\nsometimes alone, sometimes with my wife, once in company with the\nRev. M. J. Savage. I sent a large number of persons to her, wishing\nto get the results of as many first sittings as possible. I made appoint\nments myself for most of these people, whose names were in no instance\nannounced to the medium.\" (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 652.) A favour\nable report of these experiments by Professor James was published in\nthe spring of 1886 (Proceedings of the American S.P.R. pp. 102-\n106) one year before Dr. Hodgson came to this country.\nFurther, Mrs. Piper saw a large number of sitters during her visit\nto England in 1889-90, while Professor James and Dr. Hodgson were\nboth in this country, and several English gentlemen were responsible\nfor the appointments there, especially Professor Oliver J. Lodge,\nF.R.S., Dr. Walter Leaf, and Mr. F. W. H. Myers. (Proceedings,\nVol. VI., pp. 436-447, 558-568).\nAll this implies that we cannot assume fraud without supposing\nthat there has been a conspiracy of it in the Piper case, involving not\nonly the above-named persons, but also many others that could as\neasily be mentioned. This insinuation must be made good by any\nman who suggests the possibility of fraud on the part of anyone con\nnected with the case. I am myself not exempt from this accusation if\na man chooses to make it, and one of my \"scientific\" colleagues\nfrankly says that he reserves the right to believe, and that he would\nbelieve, as an alternative to fraud by Mrs. Piper, that I have lied\nabout the facts. I am not competent to disprove such a theory, but I\nhave shaped this report with the distinct purpose of inviting this\ncharge. Nor does all this imply that I admit the possibility of fraud\non the part of any of the persons named. On the contrary, I do not\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 9\nadmit that any such thing is possible in the case, because I consider that\nit. was thrmvn out of court as much as ten years ago for nil intelligent\nmen. But I allude to it here, first, to show that I have been alert to\nall the issues likely to be raised in this problem, and, second\u2014accept\ning a man's right to raise the question where his conviction is involved\n\u2014to emphasize the fact that the present situation devolves upon him\nwho entertains such a hypothesis the duty to furnish specific and\nadequate evidence for it. Professor James says on this point (Psycho\nlogical Review, Vol. V., p. 421) : \"The 'scientist,' who is confident of\n' fraud ' here, must remember that in science, as much as in common\nlife, a hypothesis must receive some positive specification and determi\nnation before it can be profitably discussed ; and a fraud which is no\nassigned kind of fraud, but simply ' fraud ' at large, fraud in abstracto,\ncan hardly be regarded as a specifically scientific explanation of\nspecific concrete facts.\"\nIn addition to this, when it comes to accusing Mrs. Piper of fraud\nwithout specific proofs, Professor James also says in the same refer\nence : \" Dr. Hodgson considers that the hypothesis of fraud cannot be\nseriously entertained. I agree with him absolutely. The medium has\nbeen under observation, much of the time under close observation, as\nto most of the conditions of her life, by a large number of persons,\noager many of them to pounce upon any suspicious circumstance for\nfifteen years. During that time not only has there, not been one single\nsuspicious circumstance, remarked, but not, one suggestion has ever been\nmadefrom any quarter which might tend positively to explain how the\nmedium, living the apparent life she leads, could possibly collect infor\nmation about so many sitters by natural means.\" (Cf. Professor\nXewbold, Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 7, and Mr. Andrew Lang,\nVoL XV., p. 45.)\nThis statement of the situation will make clear why I absolutely\nrefuse to discuss the theory of fraud. I say only so much as will force\nthe public to face the issue and to understand why I accept no obliga\ntions whatever to treat the suspicion of fraud seriously. If the reader\nof this report will take the pains, he will discover that the care which\nI observed to keep all knowledge of my sittings out of the acquaintance\nof every one except Dr. Hodgson alone was undertaken distinctly with\nthe purpose of showing clearly that every accusation or suspicion of\nfraud must accept the implied complicity of Dr. Hodgson, and make\nthis good, or treat the problem of these experiments with proper\nrespect. I also ignore the question regarding the genuineness of the\ntrance, as that has been adequately attested by the proper persons,\nthough I was careful to satisfy myself of this fact, not from any\nscepticism on that point, but because my duty as an observer required\nthat I be able to give a reason for the belief. I can also say that\n\f10 [PAKT\nJ. H. Hyslop. Fh.D.\nwhatever suspicions existed in the Phinuiti days regarding this question,\nthey are no longer applicable to the condition which I observed. I am\nwilling to add also that, assuming that fraud is eliminated from Mrs.\nPiper's part in the acquisition of the facts in the record, I should not\nfind it necessary to lav much stress upon the genuineness of the trance,\nas even the supraliminal communication of such facts as I have in my\nrecord would not lose in spiritistic suggestiveness by that circumstance.\nThe only value in establishing the genuineness of the trance after\nremoving the supposition of fraud is the fact that we simply make it\nmore difficult for the common mind to explain the incidents on any\nnormal grounds. This advantage, however, is more than offset by the\nfact that the genuineness of the trance opens the door wide to all the\npossibilities of the subliminal, which may include unconscious fraud to\nany extent without implicating the primary personality in any\nresponsibility whatever for it. Consequently I do not treat the\nissue of the trance as the most important one, or as in any way crucial,\nbut us valuable only in limiting the number of factors to be considered\nin the problem. The only reason for investigating the trance at all, in\nthis or other cases, is that it was alleged and the test of honesty partly\ndepends on it ; but where no pretence of a trance is made, there is no\nreason for demanding that it shall occur, unless we find that it is\nactually necessary for desired results. The question of fraud is prior\nto this in its importance, and having shown adequate reasons for\ndismissing it from consideration, I pass directly to the main problem.\nIt will be necessary to explain briefly the conditions under which\nthe experiments were performed, as this will serve the double purpose\nof making the results more intelligible to the reader who cannot witness\nthe performance and of indicating the precautions taken, which will\ndispose of ordinary objections and show the proper incidence of respon\nsibility for the value of the record. The arrangements for my sittings\nwere made only through Dr. Hodgson, and with special care regarding\nsecrecy. The following statements will make the whole case clear.\n(1) No one except Dr. Hodgson and my wife was to know that I\nwas to have sittings, and only Dr. Hodgson was to know of\nthe arrangements. This plan was carried out in entire\nsecrecy.\n(2) The arrangements for the sittings were not made with Mrs.\nPiper in her normal state, but with the trance personalities\nin her trance state.\n(3) The arrangements for my sittings were not made in my name,\ni Until the beginning of 1 i7 Mrs. Piper's chief trance personality, so to speak,\nwas known under the name of Phinuit. See ProctediniJn, Vol. VI., pp. 440, 448-450,\nei al. ; Vol. VIII., pp. 50-54 it al.\n\fxi.i.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. II\nbut in the pseudonym of \" Four times friend,\" so that neither\nthe supraliminal nor the subliminal of Mrs. Piper could have\nany clue to my identity (see Note 1, p. 344).\n(4) When I went to conduct the experiments and before reaching\nthe house of II rs. Piper, about two hundred feet from the\nhouse and while in a closed coach, I put on a mask covering\nthe whole of my face, and entered the house wearing the\nmask, met Mrs. Piper, and went on with the sitting in this\ncondition.\n(5) When introduced to Mrs. Piper it was under the name of Mr.\nSmith, which is the usual name by which Dr. Hodgson intro\nduces strangers. I bowed to her without uttering a sound, the\nobject being to conceal my voice equally as well as my face.\n(6) In the whole series of my sittings Mrs. Piper never heard my\nvoice in her normal state, except twice when I changed it\ninto an unnatural tone to utter a sentence, in one case only\nfour words, as explained in my notes.\n(7) In the whole course of the sittings, also, I was careful not to\ntouch Mrs. Piper, and I never came into any contact with her\nto render any muscular suggestion possible, except perhaps\nhalf-a-dozen times when I seized the hand while writing to\nplace it on the writing-pad which it was escaping. Once, as in\ndicated in the notes, I held her head while she was straightened\nin the chair in which she was sitting (p. 467). But at all\nother times I avoided every form of contact that could even\nmake muscular suggestion conceivable.\n(8) The record shows that the facts obtained were either without\nany questions at all, or without questions calculated to suggest\nthe answers given. I was extremely careful to avoid verbal\nsuggestion. I have tried to draw attention to any special\nexceptions.\n(9) During the writing I stood behind and to the right of Mrs.\nPiper, in a position which concealed any view of me and my\nmovements absolutely from any visual knowledge of Mrs.\nPiper, whether supraliminal or subliminal, even had her eyes\nbeen open instead of closed in the trance. It was necessary\nto take this position in order to be able to read the writing\nas it went on.\n. The fourth, fifth, and sixth precautions were taken, because in\n1892 I met Mrs. Piper twice for a short time and had a portion\nof a sitting (see p. 297). I had been brought into the room\nand introduced to her under a false name while she was in the\ntrance, but introduced to her after recovery from it under my\n\f12 [part\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nright name. Hence the mask and concealment of my voice were\nmeasures against any possible identification, but were taken much\nmore because I wished to be able to say so than hecause I felt any\nimperative necessity for doing it after my study of the case. The mask\nI kept on until the third sitting, when I felt it unnecessary to wear it\nany longer, for the reason that at the end of the second sitting the\nname and relationship of my father was given as Mrs. Piper came out\nof the trance. I had to assume from that point that her subliminal\nwas aware of who I was, and further concealment from it was no longer\nnecessary. But I still preserved my precautions against any identifica\ntion by voice and muscular suggestion. I could rather safely rely upon\nthe fact that the lapse of six years and that I was now wearing a\nbeard would prevent visual identification, because I had a smooth face\nin 1892 when I sat. I can attach no special value to the concealment\nof my voice in the case after removing the mask, except as an indica\ntion of the general cautiousness with which I wished to conduct the\nexperiments. In spite of the assumption, however, that Mrs. Piper's\nsubliminal had gotten my name, I have no doubt that her normal state\nnever obtained any knowledge of my identity until after the news\npapers had published what I had been doing, and this was after the\nclose of my sittings. She displayed absolutely no curiosity regarding\nme during the sittings, not even noticing me after the introduction on\nthe first morning, and only the necessity of assuming that her sub\nliminal knew my identity made further wearing of the mask useless for\nevidential purposes.\nAs regards the seventh, eighth, and ninth statements, one of the\nobjects in my experiments was to test the influence of suggestion\nby the sitters. I had felt myself so hard pushed for arguments\nagainst the spiritistic theory that I tolerated in myself and others\nthe appeal to illusions of interpretation and suggestion, as a resource\nagainst conviction until I could witness the phenomena at close\nhand. In reading the Reports I feared that possibly some inci\ndents, or even a large number of them, quoted as evidence of spirit\ncommunication, might have their force impaired by this suspicion.\nMy view at that time was based to some extent upon preconceptions\nformed by my idea of earlier sittings with Mrs. Piper and imperfections\nof the record. But both more careful reading and personal inquiry\nshowed that my preconceptions of imperfection were grossly exag\ngerated, and that my doubts had to rest upon another basis altogether,\nnamely, the confusions and errors. But, nevertheless, I wished to\nstudy the phenomena at close range, and the result of the sittings was\nto convince me that the hypothesis of suggestion was inadequate. I\nhave tried by the fulness of the present record to give all others the\nsame opportunity as mvself to understand this feature of the problem.\n\fxu.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena.\nIt is not so easy to eliminate illusions of interpretation. We are\nnever free from their possibility until we secure such definiteness in\nthe facts that even a prejudiced reader cannot mistake their pertinence.\nEven in my first sitting some of the facts stated were specific enough\nfor me to decide at once the question of .their pertinence or impertinence,\nand hence illusions of interpretation had their limits fairly well defined,\nto say nothing of the mass of material in later sittings.\nAs this report will probably be read by some who are not familiar\nwith either the whole record of the case or the difference between Mrs.\nPiper's mediumship and the modics operandi of other alleged ''mediums,\"\nI shall briefly characterise the conditions under which the results are\nobtained, so that there shall be absolutely no excuse for the reader to\nstudy the present account with any erroneous preconceptions of what\nis meant by Mrs. Piper's mediumistic performances. The first important\nstep in the study of her case is a definite conception of the exact way\nthe facts are secured, and a recognition of points of important\ndift'erence between this case and those which have determined the\npopular idea of mediumship.\n(1) Mrs. Piper goes into the trance in the following manner. She\nseats herself in a chair in front of a table, upon which are\nplaced two pillows for a head-rest when the trance comes on.\nShe mav or may not engage in conversation while the trance\napproaches. In my case she general!y talked to Dr. Hodgson\nabout various domestic matters, the weather, etc. The\napproach of the trance is characterised by various indications\nas described in my notes at the beginning of each sitting.\nFinally when the head falls upon the pillows, it is arranged\nby Dr. Hodgson, or other sitter, so that the right side of the\nhead lies on the palm of the left hand and looking oft' and\naway from the table upon which the writing is done. This\nsecond table is at the right hand, and upon it is placed the\nwriting pad. In a few minutes after the trance occurs, the\nright hand shows signs of animation and slowlv moves toward\nthis table for the writing, when a pencil is placed between\nthe two fore-fingers and the writing begins.\n(2) Mrs. Piper's normal consciousness, as the past evidence goes to\nshow, knows nothing of what she has done or communicated\nin the trance. She also remains ignorant of the communica-\ncations until they are published in some form, except, of\ncourse, when a sitter chooses to tell her something, which I\nneed hardly say in my case was nothing. Hence we do not\nhave to reckon with anv views of Mrs. Piper's in estimating\n\f\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D. [part\nthe nature and value of the results, so that the facts have to\nbe studied from the standpoint of the sitter or investigator.\n(3) There is no mechanical apparatus whatsoever in the experi\nments, except the writing-pad and pencil which you furnish\nyourself. Hence there is no excuse for comparing the case to\nslate-writing and cabinet performances generally. Absolutelv\nnothing of this sort is connected with the sittings and experi\nments. They are conducted in open daylight, in a room\nwithout any special arrangements for them, except the\ntables as indicated, and this room, in so far as living persons\nare concerned, might be any one that the sceptical inquirer\nmight wish to choose in any locality whatsoever, and not\nconfined to Mrs. Piper's home.\n(4) In all cases of so-called independent slate-writing, that 1\never witnessed (which were clearly fraudulent), I was either\nin the darkness or the phenomena were produced out of\nmy sight ; the slate-writing was done nominally by a spirit\ndirectly and not by the hand of the \"medium,\" and I\nwas not an eye-witness of the writing. But in Mrs. Piper's\ncase, in addition to the daylight and absence of mechanical\napparatus like slates or cabinets, the writing is done visibly\nwith her own hand, and on paper and with a pencil of your\nown furnishing. That is to say, we can actually see as\nmuch of the modus operandi of the \" communications \" as\nwe can see of any normal human act. Nothing is concealed\nfrom our view, except the physiological processes that are\nequally concealed from us in our own writing as well as all\nother human affairs.\n(5) The whole scientific and evidential importance of the results\nthus gets its credentials and value solely from the content of\nthe \" communications,\" and not in any special way from the\nmanner of obtaining them, except as detective frauds are\nexcluded from the matter.\n(6) I should also indicate briefly the manner of making the record.\nDr. Hodgson sat near the table on my right where he could\nsee the writing as it proceeded. This he copied, reading it in\na low voice as an indication to the trance personality that it\nwas intelligible, or sometimes with a tone of interrogation and\ndoubt which would be followed either by the word \"Yes \"\nsometimes written out, or assent by the hand, or by the repe\ntition of a word or phrase not rightly read at first.i He was\ni After I became more familiar with the writing I often made attempts to read\naloud portions of it instead of Dr. Hodgson.\n\fxLi.] Observationa of Certain Trance Phenomena. 15\nunable to copy the whole of the automatic writing at the time,\nas it was necessary for him to record his own or my questions\nand statements made at the time and to describe certain\nmechanical features of the process not expressed in the writing,\nleaving room for the insertion of the omitted portions of the\nwriting afterward. When a question was to be asked or a\nstatement made to the \" communicator,\" Mrs. Piper's hand\nwas spontaneously raised toward the mouth of the sitter who\naddressed the hand, and it then immediately proceeded either\nto present the message to the \" communicator,\" often extend\ning itself out toward some \" invisible presence,\" or to write out\na reply. After the sitting was over, usually in the afternoon\nof the same day, Dr. Hodgson and myself went over the record\ntogether, completing the copy of the automatic writing. From\nthis record type-written copies were made and sent to the\nprinter. The printed proofs have been compared first with\nDr. Hodgson's copy, and then, once more with the original\nautomatic writing, so as to secure the utmost possible\naccuracy.\nThese facts will leave no excuse for any further misunderstanding\nof the Piper phenomena, and ought to remove such misconceptions\nof them as have been derived from the popular notion concerning\nmediumship.\nThere is one other feature of the sittings which it is necessary to\ndescribe in order to obtain a clear idea of their complexity outside our\npositive knowledge. I have described above what we actually know\nabout the modus operandi of the case. But beyond this there appears\nto be a consistent rigime in the process, for whose validity no one can\nvouch until the spiritistic theory is sufficiently proved to make it\ninherently probable. This rigime is the action of the \"controls,\" and\nthe little alleged coterie of spirits that are trying to communicate from a\ndiscarnate world with the incarnate. We can describe this appearance\nwithout vouching for its reality. But there appear to be several\npersons or spirits having Mrs. Piper in charge for the same purpose\nthat animates our experiments. The chief of these are called by them\nselves \" Imperator \" and \" Rector,\" and are assisted sometimes appa\nrently by George Pelham and two or three others (Cf. Proceedingt,\nVol. XIII. pp. 407-412). Rector usually acts as amanuensis in the\nwriting. George Pelham acted as chief amanuensis at my first sitting.\nImperator seldom writes with Mrs. Piper's hand, but generally employs\nRector through whom to communicate. Usually also the communi\ncations that purport to come from other discarnate spirits are made\nthrough the amanuensis, or even through one or more other \" spirits \"\n\f16 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nbefore the amanuensis obtains them for writing. All this, however, can\nonly be a help to the imagination in understanding the dramatic play\nof personality in the record, and hence can have no direct value in the\nestimation of the facts in relation to the problems of personal identity.\nIn describing the details of my sittings it seems to me admissible\nto use the language conforming to the spiritistic hypothesis, and this\nentirely independent of our final interpretation. The main justification\nfor this course lies in the fact that it is under the form of spiritistic\ncommunication that the phenomena occur, and we should state the\ncase in terms of its own purport. Notwithstanding this, however, I\nmight have dealt with the facts in detail by adopting the hypothesis\nof a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper, masquerading as \" spirits,\"\nand fishing and guessing and filching telepathieally from the minds of\nmyself and other persons the necessary data for this purpose. But\nthis hypothesis has not appeared to me at all probable as a satisfactorv\nexplanation of the phenomena before us, especially as I neither see\nthe a priori necessity for assuming it nor admit the adequacy of the\nempirical evidence apart from this case for its application and extension\nto the degree required. I have been driven to the favorable considera\ntion of the spiritistic hypothesis, and instead of evading it as long as\npossible throughout my report and resorting in a pedantic way to\ncircumlocutions for the purpose of preserving the impression of\ncautiousness which I tried to maintain in forming my convictions,\nI have decided to treat the sittings in general from the point of view\nwhich I finally reached. But I intend to apply the spiritistic theory\nthroughout, not merelv because it recommends itself to me as the best\none, but also because it seems to me of more importance to see how far\nthe application of this conception would throw light on the numerous\ndetails to which many persons might be inclined to apply such\nhypotheses as fishing and guessing on the part of the supposed\nsubliminal of Mrs. Piper. After all, however, I do not wish the\nreader to lose sight of the fact that the consideration essential for him\nto note is rather the possibility of the application of the spiritistic\nhypothesis as a rational one, a position that I shall reiterate from time\nto time in the discussion. lie must not suppose that I am h;\\ e offer\ning any demonstrable proof of its necessity for the explanation of my\nown sittings. The evidence drawn from those indeed appears to\nbe objectively inferior in many ways to much that has already been\npublished in these Proceeditujs, especiallv in Part XXXIII., but in the\nprevious reports on the Piper case the records have not been dealt\nwith in detail from the spiritistic point of view, and the reader has\nscarcely been able to judge how far that view appears to cover the\nvarious minutias of facts, errors and confusions. Instead, therefore, of\nseeking to point out what incidents might be explained on the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 17\nhypothesis of fishing, what on the hypothesis of guessing, what on the\nhypothesis of telepathy, ete., I have tried to take the reader behind\nthe scenes, as it were, and to show what relations the different incidents\nmay suggest with the habits and experiences of the supposed real com\nmunicators. But while I shall here discuss only the results of my own\nseries of sittings, let me warn the reader once more that my conclusions\ndo not depend on those results alone. It is far otherwise. The)' are\nthe outcome of the study of my own record added to the evidence\noffered by Professor James, Professor Lodge, Mr. Walter Leaf, Mr.\nMyers, and Dr. Hodgson, superadded to the large number of various\nand spontaneous experiences recorded in the volumes of our Proceedings.\nThe spiritistic hypothesis simply gives unity to a far larger class of\nphenomena than that of the Piper records, and this additional class\nremains inexplicable by the assumptions which we often indulge in\nthe Piper case. I offer, therefore, my analysis, not as proof, but as\nlegitimate interpretation of the record and the results of psychical\nresearch generally. I am willing even to be generous to critics, and\nto admit, for the sake of argument, that the spiritistic theory cannot be\nproved in the sense that some appear to demand of a demonstration. I\nam dealing here only with the probabilities which favour simple as\nopposed to complex hypotheses, and hence am testing the consistency\nof the former in a case which is but an additional specimen of our\nwork, and which is not treated as sufficient proof of itself.\nIn pursuance of the purpose just announced, I shall here enumerate\nthe communicators by name that figure in my series of sittings. There\nis my father, Robert Hyslop, who is the chief communicator throughout\nand who died on the 29th of August in 1896. Frequent communicators\nwere my brother Charles, who died a young boy at four and a half\nyears in 1864, and my sister Anna, who died at three years of age,\ntwelve days later. Also in several sittings apparently my uncle,\nJames B. Carruthers, communicated or made unsuccessful attempts\nat times. He died on December 2nd, 1898, from an accident on\nthe railway. In the five sittings held for me by Dr. Hodgson while\nI remained in New York my father was the only communicator, with\nthe exception that my sister Anna seemed to be present once. In\nthe next eight sittings, at which I was present myself, my father was\nthe chief communicator ; but in the course of them, in addition to all\nthat have been mentioned, my mother, twice by name, Martha Ann\nHyslop, who died in October, 1869, my cousin, Robert II. McClellan,\nwho died in 1897, and his father, my uncle, James McClellan, who\ndied about the beginning of 1876, were communicators.\nThere were no other communicators in my personal sittings except\nthe trance personalities, with an occasional message from the George\nPelham of Dr. Hodgson's Report, and one from a person whom we call\nc\n\f18 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nMr. M. (p. 458) and who is not connected with me at all, but with one\nof the other sitters. In Dr. Hodgson's sittings held in my behalf there\nwere several other communicators, but the communications regard\ning them were not relevant to myself, and some of them were too\nprivate for incorporation. The latter and some of the former are\nexcluded from the detailed record.\nI shall now indicate the general method of procedure which has\nbeen adopted and which is as follows. The Appendices I.-III. contain\ncomplete records with explanatory notes of all the sittings, both those\nat which I was personally present and also those which Dr. Hodgson held\nin my behalf. Each Appendix is followed by further explanatory notes\nembodying the results of later inquiries concerning statements made at\nthe sittings. Appendices IV. and V. contain accounts of experiments,\nimitative in their character and made for the purpose of obtaining\nlight on certain questions involved in the Piper phenomena. Appendix\nIV. deals with two of these questions, namely, the triviality of the\nincidents which people naturally choose for the purpose of identi\nfication, and the quantity of evidence sufficient to establish the same\nresult. Appendix V. deals with the mistakes made in the trans\nmission of messages through an imperfect channel. Appendix VI. is\nan account of a case which I think may serve to illustrate the state of\nmind in which I believe the communicators find themselves when in the\nact of communicating. Appendix VII. consists of quotations.\nIn Chapter II. of my Report I give a somewhat detailed account\nof the facts in the record, together with such comments by way of\ncorroboration or otherwise as my latest inquiries enable me to make,\nand after dealing with the group of incidents connected with each com\nmunicator in the record, I summarise briefly the results (pp. 28-123).\nHut although this lengthy account of the facts is intended to show the\nunity of the case in a way that perhaps many readers of the Appendices\nalone would not detect, it is not intended to be a substitute for the\ndetailed records. It seems to me impossible to obtain a proper concep\ntion of the issues involved without a most painstaking stud}- of the\nAppendices themselves, containing the detailed records. On this point\nI make no concessions to the popular demand for a merely readable story,\nbut expect from those who claim to be intelligent a minute and patient\nstudy of the phenomena, such as we demand in all scientific and philo\nsophic problems. We spend years, even generations, in the critical\nstudy of Plato and Aristotle, Kant and Hegel, etc., and we think\nourselves repaid, though we fail to arrive at any dogmatically definite\nconception of their doctrines. And this study is given to them without\nregard to the question whether we agree with them or not. It suffices\nto understand them. But in no case do we permit a man to approve\nor criticise what he has not studied. Again, there is scarcely any limit\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 19\nto resources, intellectual and financial, which have been expended in\nthe most patient study of Darwinism, which involves the gradual\nevolution of human life. It ought not to be less legitimate, it ought\nnot to be less imperative, to study at least as thoroughly those phe\nnomena that purport to throw light upon the destiny of that life.\nI therefore venture to think that our inquiry has reached such a\nstage that no brief summaries of facts or conclusions can at all meet\nthe importance of the case. The problem is not one which the \" man\nin the street \" who reads as he runs can be expected to solve either for\nhimself or for others. What the sources are of the statements made\nat my sittings and in other analogous ways through other persons is a\nquestion that certainly demands the most searching investigation into\ntheir minutest details. With this in view I gave Dr. Hodgson's Report,\nin conjunction with its detailed records, four very careful and critical\nreadings, yet I found that there were many points which I failed to\nappreciate fully until after I had finished and studied my own series of\nsittings. Hence I have included in this Report and Appendices an\nexceptionally large amount of detail involving description and comment,\nwith the hope of enabling the reader to realise to some extent the\nsignificance of the sittings, which cannot be appreciated as fully as is\ndesirable without direct personal experience. Even my own mental\nattitude at the time I have endeavoured to show by retaining in the\nAppendices all (except three or four not affecting this issue) my original\nnotes which further investigation has shown to be erroneous, including\nillusions of memory and interpretation that occurred to myself, and\nespecially the changes of opinion which fuller knowledge of the case\nor clearer and later communications forced upon me. I have done this\nalso with a view to certain difficulties connected with the main problem,\nas my own mistakes on various points appear to me to suggest a very\nsignificant bearing upon what we should expect to find in the state\nments by the communicators. I do not, of course, repeat these changes\nof opinion in my general account of the sittings in Chapter II., except\nwhen reference to them seems necessary to explain the proper signifi\ncance of the most important incidents.\nSo important, therefore, do I regard the detailed records that I\nsuggest to the student the propriety of turning to them immediately\nafter reading my general account in Chapter II., and before going on\nto my discussion of the case in Chapters III.-IV., where I examine\nthe application of the telepathic hypothesis (Chapter III.) ; of the\nspiritistic theory (Chapter IV.) ; and after considering some special\ndifficulties that may be entertained in regard to the spiritistic theory\n(Chapter V.), I express, in conclusion, my adoption, for the present at\nleast, of the spiritistic theory as the most satisfactory (Chapter VI.)\nI now pass to my general account of the facts.\nc 2\n\f20 J. H. Hyslop, Ph.D. [part\nCHAPTER II.\nGenerai. Account of the Facts.i\nIn summarising the facts in the record, I shall group them, as far\nas this is possible, according to their subjects, treating together those\nthat occur in different sittings but pertain to the same incident. In\nthis manner we shall better be able to comprehend the collective force\nof the evidence as it is represented in complex wholes. The first\nsitting, however, I shall treat rather by itself, as it is evidentially\nunimportant, and such value as it obtains comes chiefly from the\nlight that later incidents throw upon it.\nAnother reason for this isolation of the first sitting from the\nsummary of the others and for the mode of treating its contents is the\nfact that my notes in the Appendices give no adequate account of its\npossibilities. Until I had formed a better understanding of the\nphenomena generally and of my later sittings in particular, I not only\nassumed that this first one was evidentially unfit to interest the reader,\nbut also that the confusion was so great that I could not make any\nuse of it except for its dramatic play. In fact I treated it and would\ntreat it alone as absolutely worthless, and it will doubtless remain so\nfor the leader. But careful study of all the phenomena convinced\nme that this judgment might be too harsh and that it could be made\nquite intelligible, if not slightlv evidential, by disentangling its threads\nof suggestive possibilities. Instead, therefore, of producing an elaborate\nsystem of notes explaining these possibilities in connection with the\ndetailed record, I have preferred to indicate here the results of my\nlatest study of the sitting, while permitting the reader any judgment\nthat he may be pleased to form regarding either my opinion of its\npossible value or the suggestive import of its incidents. Hence I\nseparate the account from the summary of other sittings in order to\nmake clear the distinction that a critic may wish observed, though I\nJim at great pains to indicate its intelligible possibilities, its unity with\nlater sittings and the interest of its dramatic play.\nBut I must utter a special warning against misunderstanding the\nmethod I have employed in studying the record. I have often\nrecognised the relevance of certain names and incidents, apparently\ni In this chapter I frequently quote passages from the detailed records, but in\ndoing so I have not thought it necessary to reproduce in all cases the repetitions of\nwords, etc., precisely as they are given in the Appendices. In the same way I have\nabridged the extracts where such changes would effect greater clearness for the\ngeneral student and aid in discussing the questions at issue. The reader, of course,\ncan always compaie the extracts with the more complete statements of the detailed\nrecord.\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 21\nmaking a determined effort to find significance where there is no\nevidential value. I was induced to do this partly by the discovery\nthat many of the statements which have to pass as literally false are\nso near the exact truth that they could not be construed as telling\nagainst personal identity and partly by the desire to show such a\npsychological analysis of the various situations and possibilities in\nspecial cases, that even many technical errors might appear consistent\nwith the evidential matter, thus offering a possible alternative to\nguessing and suggestion. In other words, I have endeavoured to supply\nsuch information to the reader as will enable him to see for himself\nhow far errors may be due to imperfect conditions for communication.\nCompare Maltine incident (p. 418), and Munyon's Germicide (p. 391).\nAnai.vsis of the First Sitting, December U3rd, 1898.\nThe chief interest of the first sitting, then, from the point of view\nabove indicated, is the dramatic feature representing the process of\nascertaining either my identity or the proper communicator. After\nthe usual preliminaries at the beginning of the trance, such as\ngreetings, arrangements for future sittings, etc., the function of\namanuensis was turned over to G. P. in this instance, and Dr.\nHodgson was sent out of the room just as a lady claimed to be\npresent to communicate with me. Several pages of writing follow,\nin connection with this attempt to \" reach \" me, that are full of con\nfusion so far as evidential matter is concerned, though intelligible as\ndramatic play in the trying conditions for selecting the proper com\nmunicators. In the midst of this confusion the names Margaret,\nLillie, and Henry [?] were given, evidently by the lady who claimed to\n\"belong\" to me as my mother (p. 306). Careful investigation shows\nthat there is no Henry, near or remote, among the direct family\nconnections. There is an interesting piece of contingency in the first\ntwo names, as I had a sister by the name of Margaret, the oldest in the\nfamilv, who died when I was two years old, and another, my twin\nsister, by the name of Sarah Luella (Cf. p. 331), at which Lillie might be\nan attempt. But I cannot be sure of any relevance in either of them,\nand the contingency deserves to be mentioned only as one of those\nthings that so easily mislead the ordinary inquirer into the recesses\nof this subject. Whatever the theory to account for these phenomena,\nit is evident that these names belong to the connections of the lady\nclaiming to be related to me. Assuming from the spiritistic point of\nview that a number of persons were trying to \"reach\" me by shouting\nall at once into the telephone, so to speak, we might interpret these\nnames as significant, excepting the name \" Henry.\"\nThe communications that follow show confusion, though capable of\nbeing disentangled by legitimate interpretation. The name \" Alice \"\n\f22 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ncomes closely upon \" Henry,\" but is immediately corrected to \" Annie,\"\nwhich is the diminutive name of a deceased sister, though this relation\nship is not here asserted by the communicator. In fact, it is not\npossible to assume with any assurance who the communicator might be,\nthough it is probably the person who claims to be my mother. On\nthis assumption she is trying to give the names of the members\nof the family with her, and the correction of the mistake of \" Alice \"\nfor \" Annie \" is possibly made by the latter herself. Immediately\nfollowing this I am asked if I remember anything about my\nbrother. I ask who he is, meaning that I want his name, and the\nreply is . \"I say, brother. I am your ... I know I am and\n. . \" which might be either from this brother or the person\nclaiming to be my mother. I then asked : \" When did you pass out? \"\nand got the answer : \" Only a long time ago.\" This would be true of\nboth my brother and mother, while the \"only \"might be interpreted as\na word from the message \"only a short time ago\" of someone else,\npossibly my father. This is apparent from the answer to my next\nquestion, which was : \" Any other member of the family ? \" The reply\nwas : \" Yes, two. I have seen Annie and mother and Charles and\nHenry.\" Whoever the communicator was in the previous equivocal\nmessages, it is apparent, on the surface at least of this last answer, that\nit was neither my brother nor my mother. Hence seeing in the\nsentence thus naming the members of the family that the communicator\nwas not my brother Charles, and, as I knew there was no Henry in the\nfamily, I tried the dodge of pretending to believe that it was Charles\nHenry, and asked if it was. The answer : \" Ao, Charles,\" was very\npertinent and correct, as it excluded the Henry from consideration.\nThinking that I was not dealing with my brother, but with my father,\nI asked the question : \" Did he [Charles] pass out before you 1 \" and the\nanswer: \" No, I did not hear, did you say before,\" was followed by,\n\" Yes, he did, some time before.\" The latter was correct, assuming that\nit was my father. The allusions that follow to the trouble with the\nhead and heart would apply, as far as they go, to my father, and the\npassage comes to an end with the odd statement : \" I say, give me my\nhat.\" I learned later that this expression was characteristic of my\nfather (Cf. p. 313). I here presented an accordion for the hand to\ntouch (for reasons that the reader will find explained in the history of\nthe Piper case. See footnote, p. 307), but it did not prevent the confu\nsion, so that the communicator was supplanted by my brother Charles\napparently, though there is no positive assurance of this until the\ncommunication is stated in the first person of the one claiming to be\nmy brother. But he in turn is almost immediatelv supplanted by a\nlady. The statements about the ownership of the accordion depend\nfor their relevancy altogether upon the question who is communicating,\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 23\nand this is not made clear. Apparently it was my father who had\nreferred just before to his suddenly passing out at last, to the trouble\nwith his head and heart, and said, \" I say, give me my hat,\" and hence\nassuming that it was he that said, referring to the accordion,\u2014\" this\nwas not mine but his. It belonged to George \" (Cf. guitar incident,\np. 461),\u2014we have two statements that are false, though it is interesting\nto see that they are apparently corrected immediately and spontaneously.\nBut if my brother Charles said it, as he was evidently communicating\nin the next sentence, the first statement would be true, supposing that\nthe pronoun \" his \" referred to the previous communicator assumed to\nbe my father. My brother's next and very definite statement, suppos\ning that the original is rightly read as \" my father,\" was exactly true\nin all its details, namely, the ownership of the accordion, the implied\ndeath of the owner, and the name of my brother. My statement that\n\" it belonged to someone else \" is not suggestive of the facts, though it\nmight appear suspiciously near it. The strongest fact in the passage is\nthe statement or implication that Charles is the name of my brother.\nAnnie, or Anna, was the name of my sister, but I am not distinctly\ntold this, while I am left altogether to the contents of later sittings to\ninfer the possibility that the allusion to the trouble with the head and\nheart, and to the want of a hat comes from my father. No indepen\ndent evidential value belongs to the passage. There is simply in it the\napparent groping about of inexperienced communicators to make their\npresence known.\nFollowing this episode G. P. wrote : \" You will have to have\npatience with me, friend, for there are three persons who are all\nspeaking to me at once. One is calling mother, and the other is\ncalling Charles, and the other is calling for you \" (p. 308). The\ncommunication from the lady that apparently came from the person\n\" calling mother \" is clear-cut and definite. But not a name or a fact in\nit has any relevancy to me or to my family connections. Dr. Hodgson\nis then sent out of the room and G. P. writes : \" I cannot keep the lady\nfrom talking, neither can I keep the young man who claims to be\nyour brother.'' The reference to Edwards which follows, and which\nhas no significance to me, might be connected with the communicators\nclaiming to be my mother and brother and who disappear. At this\npoint the communication became relevant, and suggested my brother\nCharles : \" I had a fever, and they said it was typhoid. My throat,\nI had a very bad throat, and it took me over here. And I did not\nknow any one before I left my body.\" It was true that Charles died\nof a fever, but it was not typhoid. It was scarlet fever. I found also\u2014\nwhat I did not know at the time of the sitting, though I may have\nheard it mentioned when I was a child\u2014that he suffered with a very\nputrid sore throat during his illness. I learn that this is characteristic\n\f24 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nof scarlet fever, but I did not know the fact at the time of the\nmessage. The statement that he did not know any one before he left\nthe body will depend for its truth upon its interpretation. If it means\nthat he did not know any one \"in spirit\" before his death, it is\nperfectly true, as my sisters Margaret and Sarah died before he was\nborn. If it means that he did not know any of us or any person \"on\nearth \" it is equivocal. If it means that he does not remember any one,\nthis might be true, as he was only four and a-half years old when he\ndied thirty-four years ago ; but if it means that he never saw or knew\nany one, it would bo false.\nMy brother continues : \" I think I have been here a good many\nyears, and I do not know all of my which if it had\nended with \" brothers and sisters \" would have completed the truth,\nas two brothers and a half-sister were born after his death. But I\ninterrupted with the question, \" Have you seen mother 1 \" He\nsaid, \" She is here with me. She is all right. She came here after\nI did.\" It is true that my mother died after this brother. I then\nasked if he had seen anyone else besides mother, having in mind\nmy father, and the reply was, \" Yes, I have. Do you remember\nshe had a sister who was in the body when I passed out 7\nBut she came here, too, and she came after mother.\" Every word of\nthis is true, both as to the facts and as to the time relations of their\noccurrence ; but it was not reading my thoughts at the time. Only\none of my mother's sisters has died since she did in 1869. No answer\ncame to my request for the name of this sister. But he continued :\n\" Then there is another one who is here, and she is nearer to you than\nall the rest of us, and she will soon be able to tell you all you would\ncare to know.\" This either means nothing or it might be a possible\nreference to my twin sister, who died when she was four months old.\nBut she never comes to communicate, neither does my sister Margaret,\nwho died wrhen she was two years old, and when I was onlv one\nmonth old.\nThen immediatelv follows : \" Where is Will ? \" This is the name\nof one of my brothers still living, and was brought out in a most\nunhesitating manner. The message, however, in which he states that\nhe is bringing someone here to communicate, and that she was the last\nto \" come here,\" is perfectly unintelligible.\nAt this point my brother is apparently interrupted, though I did\nnot suspect it at the time, by an attempt of my uncle to communicate,\nwho had died about a month before the sitting (p. 310). I surmise\nthis because of the two references \"El . . . \" (which becomes\nEliza, the name of this uncle's wife at a later sitting, p. 314) and\n\" Robertson,\" which was apparently intended for \" Robert's son \"\n(p. 317). These two points came out later in connection with incidents\n\fXLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 25\nwhich obviously pointed to this uncle. I was also as much confused\nhere as the communicator.\nBut my brother resumes his messages where he left off for my\nuncle (?), and I interrupted him with the question: \"Time of year\npassed out ! \" The answer was : \" I think it was winter, because I\nremember seeing it snow.\" As a fact, it snowed the day before and I\nthink on the morning of his death. I further asked where I was at\nthe time, and the reply was : \" I think you were not with me. I do\nnot think I saw you at all before I came here.\" I was absent\non an errand when he died. The statement, however, can hardly\nbe interpreted as recognising this absence, but rather indicates\nthat he did not remember me, which is possible enough (see above,\np. 24). But why should telepathy put the matter in that form ? If it\nbe the answer that I wanted it might be called telepathic, and the first\npart of the statement bears that interpretation. But the later part\nputs another meaning on it, showing the natural point of view and\npossibly the fact for the communicator, while this was contrary to\nwhat was actually in both my supraliminal consciousness and my\nmemory ! I knew him well enough, but it would be natural for him\nnot to know me or to remember me.\nAfter a second unimportant reference to my mother again in\nresponse to my question about her, he suddenly asked me : \" Well,\nwhat did you mean by asking for George 1 \" Earlier in the\nsitting I asked: \"Have you seen George?\" (p. 307), the name of\na brother still living, though I did not say he was living, but was\ntrying to make the communicator think that this person was on the\n\" other side.\" After my saying that I wanted merely to know if\nhe remembered him, he said : \" Yes, but George is here. I say George\nis not here.\" As G. P. (real name George) was the amanuensis, there\nmight have been some misunderstanding at first, on his part. When I\nrepeated the question : \" Do you say George is not here 1 \" in order\nto see which statement was meant, the answer came : \"I say he is\nnot, and I could not understand why you asked me if he was here.\nNeither is he coming for awhile yet. He is well and doing well and\nso be it.\" This was an interesting and pertinent statement, though it\nis suggestive to see it in the mouth of my brother, when, if the\ninterpretation of the passage in which I asked the question first about\nthis brother George be correct, my father and brother were both\npresent (p. 308).\nThe name Corrie, which I was asked if I remembered, has no\npertinence; but if it had been Cora (6\/. p. 452) it would have been more\nimportant, as the name either of my aunt Cora or of my oldest sister\nMargaret Cornelia, who was named after this aunt. (Cf. p. 350 and\nNote 61, p. 514.) I asked, \" Is it Mary,\" and the reply came : \" I say\n\f2G [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nit is, and she is father's sister.\" My father's oldest sister, who died\nbefore I ever knew her, was called Mary Amanda. I never heard the\nname Mary applied to her, but always heard her called Amanda, and\nthis not often. The reference to Elizabeth, possibly as my mother's\nsister (though the statement can as well refer to the Mary repeated\nhere, in which case it would he false), contains only this approximation\nto the truth, namely, that the sister of my mother, who died either\nbefore my mother was born, or when she was very young, was called\nEliza. The sitting at this point began to come to an end.\nThe sitting as a whole left a bad impression upon me at the time,\nas it seemed so full of confusion. To an outsider it must still seem\nutterly unintelligible, and would be the same to myself but for the\nsubsequent sittings and the light which a study of them throws upon\nthis one. There was not at any time evidential matter enough in it\nto incline me toward the spiritistic hypothesis, nor did I suspect at all\neven any supernormal phenomena. But in the light of the facts\nwhich I now know and of a clear understanding of the represented\nmachinery of communication, I can make a clear and intelligible story\nout of the sitting, excepting the statements associated with the lady\nwho was not a relative of mine. But it would not have the slightest\nvalue as evidence for the spiritistic theory, unless we considered the\nactual coincidences in it as favourable to that doctrine and not account\nable to telepathy.\nI now proceed to deal with the remaining sittings and to give the\nchief incidents connected with the different communicators. These\nare my father Robert Hyslop, my uncle James Carruthers, my cousin\nRobert McClellan, my brother Charles Hyslop, my sister Anna Hyslop,\nand my uncle James McClellan. My mother is not prominent enough\nas a communicator to give her any place in this summary.\nAs an important help to the reader it may he useful to have a\nrunning account of the chief \" communicator's \" life and its relation to\nthe other persons mentioned in the record. I shall not, however,\nmention any other events than are necessary for the right comprehen\nsion of the record and its unity. I shall group the incidents in a\nchronological order as far as possible.\nMy father, Robert Hyslop, was born in 1821 and lived on a farm\nin Ohio until 18K9, when he moved West into a neighboring State. He\nsuddenly returned to his old home, dangerously ill with something like\ncancer of the larynx, in August, 1896, and died on the 29th of that\nmonth at the home of his brother-in-law, James Carruthers. Some\nwhere about 1860 he injured his spine by a day's overwork and a few\nyears afterward became affected with locomotor ataxy and gradually\nlost the use of one of his legs so that he had to use a crutch for a\n\frjLLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 27\nwhile, and finally a cane after some improvement. In 1876 he had a\nslight stroke of apoplexy, or something like it. After it his hearing\nliecame affected, one ear being quite deaf. About three years before\nhis death he lost the use of his voice from what was probably paralysis\nof the larynx. Finally a year or so before his death he took what he\nthought was catarrh, but which was more probably cancer of the\nlarynx, and it was accompanied with frequent spasms which threatened\nto end his life.\nMy father had three sisters, Mary Amanda, Nancy, and Eliza.\nThe first of the three married James McClellan, who figures as one of\nthe \"communicators \" in this record (pp. 108-111). She died in 1849,\nfive years before I was born. The other two are still living, but lost\ntheir husbands a short time before my first set of experiments. Eliza\nmarried James Carruthers, the \" communicator \" who appears now as\n\" uncle Charles \" and now as \" uncle Clarke \" in this record. The\nname of the other uncle was not even hinted at in the \" com\nmunications,\" though one allusion implies his death (p. 316). My\nmother died in 1869 and my father was married a second time in\n1872.\nThe names of my brothers and sisters are Margaret Cornelia,\nwho died at two years of age in 1 854 ; Sarah Luella, my twin sister,\nwho died four months old in 1854; Charles, who died at four and\na half years in 1864 ; and Anna Laura, who died nearly three years\nold in 1864. Of those living are myself, James H., George, Lida\n(Eliza), William, Robert, Frank (Francis), and Henrietta, my half-\nsister, spoken of as Hettie in this record.\nMy father belonged to a very orthodox sect. It was the small body of\nAssociate Presbyterians who refused to join in the union of that denomi\nnation with the Associate Reformed Presbyterians to form the United\nPresbyterian Church in 1858. He took an active but not official part\nin the controversies that went on about this union at the time. It was\nthis fact that brought him into acquaintance and friendship with the\nDr. Cooper mentioned in the record, the latter finally going into the\nunion. My father remained in the small body that refused to modify\nits doctrines and practices. This body held out against every form of\ninstrumental worship in religious services, and also against the singing\nof hymns of human composition. There were many other points of\ndistinction which are not important for this record. But in his life\nmy father adhered strictly to the covenants of his profession, and knew\nnothing of science and philosophy, except what I discussed with him,\nthough he read deeply and thoroughly in the theology of his church\nand was in that a very intelligent man. He had keen and quick\nperceptions, and understood any question clearly when put to him in\nthe right way.\n\f28 J. H. Hyslop, PhD.\nWhen ho gave me an education he rather hoped I would study for\nthe ministry, but he never undertook either to persuade or compel me\nto do so. He left the whole matter to my free choice. But when he\nascertained from my confession in 1882 that I had to modify my religious\nbeliefs he felt the apostasy very keenly and it was long before he could\nin any way reconcile himself to it. My \"ideas\" were a perpetual\npuzzle to him and his own orthodoxy too fixed to list-en to the wiles of\nscepticism. He was not known to the public in any way, and was\nwhat would be called a very obscure man. His name never appeared\nin print except in an occasional article of his own in the denominational\nperiodical with a small and obscure circulation, or in connection with\nsome matter of county or township interest.\nStatements of my Father, Robert Hyslop.\nThe seqond sitting opened with a very marked difference between\nit and the first. The situation seemed to have completely changed.\nThe same apparent causes for confusion were not manifest. The trance\npersonalities seemed to have the situation perfectly at command. The\nfirst sitting had closed with the expressed indication by G. P. that the\nlady who had claimed me for her son should be made clear again. But\nin the meantime it was as if the trance personalities had consulted over\nthe situation and the evidence, and had become assured of the right\ncommunicators. The opening of the second sitting after the usual\npreliminaries with the confident address to me in my own name in the\nvery first words is evidence of the appearance as I have described it.\nI was addressed : \"James. James. Speak. James. James, speak\nto me. James. James,\" the name by which my father always called\nme after 1877. But there was no such apparent fishing and hesitation\nin regard to the rightful communications that had marked the dubious\nsituation in the first sitting. The way was now perfectly clear for\nsettled communications.\nIn a few minutes after addressing me as indicated above I was\nasked \" Where is Willie I \" This was a repetition of the name of my\nbrother and the question regarding him of the previous day. Some\nnon-evidential statements followed, and my father's place was taken by\nmy brother Charles, who gave both his name and relationship to me,\nand intimated that the previous communicator was my father. No\nimportant fact was stated by my brother, and he was followed by a\nlong communication purporting to come from my uncle. But I pass\nthis by for the present to summarise those from my father, leading to\nhis own identity and suggestive of that of others. After my uncle\nleft my father returns to take up his communications. I quote the\nrecord (p. 316).\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 29\nWill you let me return again and help to free my mind ? Do you know\nUncle Charles? (S. : What Uncle Charles ?) He is here. (S. : I don't\nknow any Uncle Charles.) And * * No, I am thinking ... let\nme see. I think it is not a real uncle. You must remember what I mean.\nHe used to be so nervous. i\nIt all at once dawned on me that \" uncle Charles \" was a mistake\nfor \" uncle Carruthers,\" who had died about a month previouslv. He\nwas the husband of my father's sister. The relevance of the passage\nis therefore evident. Almost immediately my father says, evidently\nwith reference to this sister and another, both of whom had just lost\ntheir husbands within a month of each other : \" I wish you would tell\nthe girls I am with them in sorrow or pleas ... or joy, it matters\nnot. What is their loss is our gain.\" The name (Eliza) of one of\nthese \" girls,\" his sister and the wife of the communicator to whom\nhe had just referred, was given in my uncle's communication. The\nsentence, \" what is their loss is our gain,\" was both pertinent and\na common expression of father's in situations of this kind. The\nrecord then proceeds as follows :\u2014\n(S. : Free your mind, father.) I will, indeed, but have you seen the\nchildren yet ? (S. : I have not seen them for two years.) They are\nwonderfully good, I think. I know, James, that my thoughts are muddled,\nbut if you can only hear what I am saying, you will not mind it. Do you\nknow where George is ? (S. : Yes, I know where he is.) Are you troubled\nabout him . . .he is all right and will be, James. (S. : Yes, all right.)\nWorry not. (S. : No, I will not worry.) But you do. (S. : Yes. I have\nworried some, but I will not any more.) Thank God. James, if you will\nonly stick to this . . . stick to the promise not to worry, you will in\ntime be contented and happy while still in the body (p. 316).\nThis is a very pertinent passage. How much so is brought out\nmore fully in my notes (pp. 317, 352). But the name of my brother is\ncorrect, and the advice not to worry about him was characteristic of\nmy father in the matters connected with this brother. The mental\nattitude of apology toward him is that of my father toward him while\nliving. The expression \"stick to this\" was also characteristic.\ni Atterixkt mean that a word or words are omitted which were actually written or\nspoken at the sitting, but which were undecipherable. Dots mean that there has been\napparently some interruption in the speech or writing, but not that any words written\nor spoken have been omitted.\u2014J. H. H.\ni In the accounts of the sittings, the sitter's remarks and questions are through\nout given in round brackets, and the explanatory notes in square brackets. The\nletter \"S\" stands for \"Sitter,\" in this case myself, and \"R. H.\" for Dr. Hodgson.\nIn the sittings for February 7th, 8th, Kith, 20th, and 22nd, which were conducted by\nDr. Hodgson alone while I was in New York, all the remarks, of course, were made\nby him.-J. H. H.\n\f30 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nAt this point I placed the accordion on the table, and after a short\ninterruption by my uncle my father continues (p. 318) :\u2014\nDo you recall your lectures, and, if so, to whom [do you] recite them\nnow ? I often hear them in my own mind. Give me some [thing] for the\npurpose of helping me remain here longer. (S. : Yes, here it is.) [giving\naccordion] My toy. I remember it so well. I left all so suddenly, yet\nI knew I was coming. (S. : Yes. Yes, I think so too.) Do you remember\nwhat my feeling was about this life 1 (S. : Yes, I do.) Well, I was not so\nfar wrong after all. I felt sure that there would be some knowledge of this\nlife, but you were doubtful, remember. (S.. : Yes. Yes, I remember.) You\nhad your own ideas, which were only yours, James.\nMy father was of the orthodox belief and, of course, accepted a\nfuture life. I was sceptical on this, as on other subjects connected\nwith orthodoxy, and I was the only one in the family, as indicated\nhere, that was so affected, so far as my father's knowledge went.\nThe passage is therefore quite correct in its details, as well as\nthe phrase ''you had your own ideas,\" as I would say \"opinions.\"\nBut the subject and allusion to my scepticism introduces a topic\nto which my father returns again and again during my experi\nments, and always with new facts of our experience in connection\nwith it. 1 shall therefore state in this connection all that was given\nin his communications regarding it. It relates to the materials of a\nconversation that we had on this very subject on my last visit to him\nin January or February, 1895. There appears in the communications\nmore sympathy with \"spiritualism\" than most persons would recognise\nin him from his orthodox affiliations. But the fact was that he knew\nabsolutely nothing about that doctrine in its fraudulent aspects as it is\nusuallv known. He never saw anything of it personally, and knew it\nonly as stated in one of his Biblical commentaries. Hence he did not\nknow enough about it to despise it. But in this conversation with\nhim, which occurred several times on the two or three days I stayed\nwith him, he showed a surprisingly receptive attitude toward it. I\nhad been lecturing on psychical research in Indianapolis a few days\nbefore, and the conversation came about in thus explaining the nature\nof my suilden and unexpected visit to him. His receptive attitude,\nhowever, at that time will explain why I am not surprised at the tone\nof his speech in the present allusions to be considered immediately. It\nis, of course, the later communications that give me the right to\ninterpret the above passage as referring to the subject in view.\nIn the sitting of December 26th he returned to this subject as\nfollows : \" I see clearly now, and oh, if I could only tell you all that\nis in my mind. It was not an hallucination but a reality, but I felt it\nwould be possible to reach you \" (p. 325). At this point I interrupted\nwith a question, but after a little interval he resumed the same thread.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 31\n\"James, are you here still? If so, I want very much to know if you\nremember what I promised you. (S : Yes. I hope you will tell me what\nyou promised.) I told you if it would be possible for me to return to you\nI would (S. : Yes, I remember), and try and convince you that I lived. I\ntold you more than this, and I will remember it all. I told you I would come\nback if possible, and ... let you know that I was not annihilated. I\nremember well our talks about this life and its conditions, and there was a\ngreat question of doubt as to the possibility of communication, that if I\nremember rightly was the one question which we talked over. Will\nreturn soon. Wait for me\" (p. 325). A little later in the same sitting he\nsaid :\u2014\"I have been calling for you ever since I left my body\" (p. 327).\nLater still in the same sitting, speaking of trying to prove his identity, he\nagain alludes to keeping his promise (p. 332).\nIn the sitting of December 27th (p. 341), he asks: -\"What do you\nremember, James, of our talks about Swedenborg ? (S. : I remember only\nthat we talked about him.) Do you remember of our talking one evening\nin the library about his description of the Bible ? (S : No.) Several years\nago? (S. : No, I do not remember it.) His opinion of its spiritual sense?\n(S. : No. I do not remember that but perhaps some one else in the family\ndoes.) I am sure of our talks on the subject. It may have been with one\nof the others, to be sure. In any case I shall soon be able to remember all\nabout it.\"\nOn February 7th following, Dr. Hodgson began his series of sittings\nan my behalf, and near the beginning of the first one, father alludes to\nthe Swedenborg incident spontaneously (p.370), as might be natural from\nthe attitude that I had taken toward it in my last sitting previous, and\nexpressed his satisfaction with my understanding of it, as told him in\nJanuary by Dr. Hodgson, the message having been sent him through\nRector. A little later in the sitting he says : \" I often think of the\nlong talks we used to have during my last years in earth life of the\npossibilities of communication with each other\" (p. 372).\nIn my own sitting of May 29th the subject is resumed in the\nfollowing brief manner :\u2014\n\" Yes, I am here and I am thinking over the things I said when I was\nconfused. Do you remember of my telling you I thought it possible that we\nmight live elsewhere ? But to speak was doubtful very \" (p. 420). Near the\nbeginning of the sitting for May 31st, another remarkable passage on this\nsubject occurs. In response to my good morning to him, he began : \" I\nheard every word and I am coming nearer to you. There is no dream here.\nAnd shut out the thought theory and do not let it trouble you. I went on\ntheorising all my earthly life and what did I gain by it V My thoughts only\nbecame more subtle and unsatisfactory. There is a (rod, an all wise and\nomnipotent God Who is our Guide and if we follow the best within ourselves\nwe will know more of Him. Now speaking of Swedenborg, what does it\nmatter whether his teachings were right or wrong so long as we are\nindividually ourselves here \" (p. 438).\n\f32 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nIn the sitting for June 6th there is a longer and more interesting\npassage on this subject. In reply to a statement of explanation indi\ncating that I had looked up a certain matter to which he referred, he\nbegan (p. 474) :\u2014\nWell, now I feel satisfied to feel that you are at least pulling with my\npush, and that is all I can ask of you. I remember perfectly well\nwhat my own theories were concerning this life, and my too often\nexpressing doubts about it. I do indeed, but I think I was moved\nwith the thought that I should live somewhere and not die as a\nvegetable. Do you remember our conversations on this subject ! (S. :\nYes, I do. Can you tell when it was. Yes, I do remember the\n. . . ) Yes, do you remember of my last visit . . . your last\nvisit (S. : Yes.) with me? (S. : Yes, I remember it well.) It was more\nparticularly on this occasion than before. (S. : Yes, that is right. Do you\nknow what I was doing just before I made the visit !) Yes, I believe you\nhad been experimenting on the subject, and I remember of your telling me\nsomething about hypnotism. (S. : Yes, I remember that well.) And what\ndid you tell me about some kind of manifestation which you wero in doubt\nabout ? (S. : It was about apparitions near the point of death.) [Excite\nment in hand.] Oh, yes, indeed, I recall it very well, and you told me\n[about] a young woman who had had some experiments and dreams (S. :\nYes, that is right.) which interested me very much, but yet you were\ndoubtful about life after so-called death. Remember the long talks we had\ntogether on this, James.\nIn the sitting of June 7th the subject recurs again (pp. 484-485):\u2014\nDo you remember what I said when you told me about the dreams and\nwhat answer I gave you in regard to it ? (S. : No, I have forgotten that,\nbut I think some one else may remember it who was present.)\nI said there were doubtless a great number of these cases, when summed\nup they would be of great importance in trying to explain a life elsewhere,\nbut they seemed to indicate it. Don't you remember it now ? And one\nof our own family had an experience some years ago. Do you remember\nanything about this either ? (S. : Yes, I remember that. Can you say\nwhich one had that experience ?)\nI intended to, and I wanted to remind you of it before, but I was too\nfar off to say it before I came here. I have often thought about it : in fact\nwe have spoken of it together since I came here. I mean since I passed out.\nIt was Charles who came and took my place before I had time to finish it.\nI will try and finish it before I go. And he saw the light, and spoke of it\nbefore he came here, James.\nOh, dear, I want to say a great deal more, and cannot they give us more\nlight ? [Hand bows in prayer.] The light is not so good this day as we\nwould have it be, yet we will help give it.\nI am still here, James, and I am thinking about the experience your uncle\nhad before he came here. It was your uncle who had it, and we have often\nspoken of it together here, James. (S. : Yes. That is the uncle who\nmarried your sister Eliza.) [Hand assents.] Yes, Clarke. And it was a\nnotification of his coming suddenly. He often refers to it.\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 33\nIs this clear to James, friend? [Rector's question to Dr. Hodgson.]\n(S. : Yes, that is clear.) [I had the legibility of the writing in mind. See\nNote, p. 485.]\nI did wish to say this when I was referring to it last time, but I was too\nfar off. I remember very well the facts and you must.\nNow for the facts as I recall them. The}- are substantially as\nindicated in the communications with the exception of two or three. I\ndid hold those long conversations with my father on my last visit, as\nstated here. I was exceedingly sceptical about the subject and about a\nlife hereafter. I made this very clear in my treatment both of appa\nritions and of the first two reports on Mrs. Piper, which I explained\naway by telepathy, \" the thought theory,\" as stated here in the com\nmunication. My attitude toward apparitions is intimated in the state\nment of the communicator that he did not think it would be a\n\" hallucination, but a reality.\" I was confident, however, that we had\nnot talked about Swedenborg, and did not believe that father knew\nanything about him. But investigation showed that we did talk\nabout him, and that my memory and judgment were wrong on this\npoint. (See Note 17, p. 361.) We did also talk about hypnotism.\nFather brought this up for explanation, mentioning some striking\npublic performances reported in the town. I discussed the matter\nfully and tried to hypnotise my brother several times and failed, much\nto my father's disappointment. Most interesting also is the fact that I\ntold him in that conversation of Mrs. D.'s dream and the experiment\nwhich I performed in connection with it. (Proceedings, Vol. XII.,\npp. 272-27+.)\nIn regard to the promise made to me that he would return and if\npossible let me know that he still lived, I can only say that I wrote to\nhim on his deathbed \"to come to me after it was all over,\" my inten\ntion being to try the experiment of which we hear so much. But in\nthe reply to this letter, which he dictated to my stepmother, no such\npromise is made, and I do not recall ever broaching it at any other\ntime, or any such promise being made. But from the reply that he\nmade to my stepmother when she asked him what I meant by this\nlast request in the last sentence of my last letter to him, it is reason\nable to suppose that he had this return in his mind, as he evidently\nunderstood the request, but would not reveal his thoughts. (See Note 9,\np. 356.) As to his remark about the effect of a large number of\napparitions on the evidence for a future life, I do not recall it. I was\nmore likely the person to hold this view of them, and have no doubt\nthat I expressed it as the suggestion of such experiences, though I was\nnot prepared to accept them as satisfactory proof. His perspicacity\nand his interest in the subject at the time qualified him to either make\nor appreciate the remark, but I do not recall that he made it. The\nii\n\f34 [I'AKT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nexperience of my uncle cannot be verified, as it is described here. He\ndid have a vision at one time, to which he gave some religions import\nance in his life as a monition to decide which path he should choose ;\nbut, in addition to the fact that it occurred under a dose of morphine\nin a serious illness, its character would not appear to a scientific mind\nas in any respect premonitory\u2014even after premonition was prove<l\u2014\nand I could not find any traces among the members of his family of\nany other experience in their knowledge that would justify the inter\npretation here given. But in all other respects the coincidences in the\ncommunications speak for themselves, both as regards the matter of\npersonal identity and that of an independent memory exhibiting itself\nthroughout every condition of the experiments.\nTo return to the point (p. 318) at which I began this long incident\nabout the present subject\u2014after an interesting interruption of the\ncommunications with some conversation by Rector with Dr. Hodgson\nabout a \"little girl trying to find her mother,\" the incident having no\nreference to me (p. 319)\u2014my father returns to say that he \" was the\nlast to come here,\" and asked if I recalled his being frank, and said,\n\" I recall the struggles you had over your work well, very well.\nEverything in life should be done with sincerity of purpose. I know well\nall the difficulties which you encounter\" (p. 321). The first statement\nwas a correct fact, his frankness with me was a marked characteristic,\nand the reference to sincerity of purpose contained the exact phraseology\nwhich represented his constant advice in any trying intellectual,\nmoral, or religious difficulty. The sitting then came to a close.\nNear the beginning of the third sitting, after addressing me as\n\" James,\" etc., my father asked me if I remembered the story he used\nto tell me of a fire when he was quite young. I asked what story, and\nthe message was repeated, and I thought of a certain fire of which\nI knew when I, not he, was young (p. 324). In the effort to have it\ncleared up the subject was changed. But I brought him back to it by\na question regarding it, and the reply was, \" Oh, yes, the fire. Strange\nI was forgetting to go on. I was nearly forgetting to go on with\nit. The fire did great damage and I used to think I never would care\nto sec the like again.\" I was unable to conjecture to what he referred\nwith any assurance, especially as there were both exaggeration and\ndiscrepancies in it, so far as my memory of fires was concerned.\nNothing more was volunteered on the subject in this series of sittings.\nBut in the sitting by Dr. Hodgson on February 7th, Kector indicates\nthat father is thinking of a fire about which he wishes to be clear\n(p. 372). Then on May 30th at my sitting (p. 430), father asks, \" And\ndo you recall the fire I spoke to you about V I replied that I\nremembered a fire, but was not certain what fire he meant. The reply\ncame, \" We lived near, and although it did not interfere, it gave me a\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 35\nfright. My thoughts are quite clear on this point. I think there can\nbe no mistaking it.\" Singularly enough, this is followed by the spon\ntaneous remark that some things which he has tried to say may seem\nmuddled, as the first allusion to the fire evidently was, according to\nthe sequel, in the following facts\nInvestigation at first discovered no probabilities in the first mention\nof the fire. Later my aunt recalled a fire when my father was young,\nwhich probably instigated the concern he felt about fire throughout\nhis life. But on reading the passage in the sitting of May 30th to\nmy stepmother (p. 430), she and my sister at once recalled a fire that gave\nmy father quite a fright. It was not when he was young, but a short\ntime before he moved West. He was always anxious about his barn\nand house, as he could never be induced to insure them until late in\nlife. The occasion that fits the later message is described fully in my\nnote (p. 364). It brings out the exaggeration and possible truth in\nthe first message, as well as the certain truth in the second, so that a\nsingular interest attaches to the statement that indicates an apparent\nconsciousness of confusion in this incident.\nThe next allusion after the fire in this sitting of December 26th was\nto our conversation on spirit communication, which has been discussed\nalready. At the end of it I took the opportunity to ask the question,\n\" Do you know what the trouble was when you passed out I \" and there\nfollowed one of the most remarkable, though confused messages in\nthe record. I asked the question in order to test his identity most\nthoroughly, and had in mind the disease from which he thought he\nsuffered, namely, catarrh, while I knew it was probably cancer of the\nlarynx. I knew that if cancer of the larynx was mentioned, the\ntheory of telepathy would have a strong, if not conclusive, point in its\nfavour. But the following communications came in answer (p. 327) :--\nNo, I did not realise that we had any trouble, James, ever. I thought\nwe were always most congenial to each other. I do not remember any\ntrouble, tell me what was it about ? You do not mean with me, do you\n. . . (S. : Father, you misunderstand me. I mean with the sickness.) Oh,\nyes, I hear. I hear you. Yes, I know now. Yes, my stomach. (S. : Yes,\nwas there anything else the matter ?) Yes ; stomach, liver, and head.\n: Very well. Tell all about it.) He has taken off this condition, but\ntells me he could not see clearly. What was meant by his eyes. His\nstomach and . . . speak plainly ... [to invisible] I do not get\nit. Sounds like Bone (?) Bone (?) Bone (?) he is telling me. Wait.\nHe places his hand over his . . . heart beat (!) (S. : Heart?) Yes,\nlet me reach thee, friend. [Hand moves over R. H.'s head.] Think I am\nfinding it hard to breathe ... my heart, James . . . my heart,\nJames. . . . difficult to breathe. Do you not remember how I used to\nbreathe ? (S. : Yes, father, you are on the right line now.) Yes, I think it,\nwas my heart which troubled me most, and my lung. Stomach and heart.\nD 2\n\f36 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nI felt a * * * [undeciphered] and tightness of my chest . . . and\nmy heart failed mc. He says distressed in the region of the heart, but at\nlast I went to sleep. Was it not congestion, Jaines ? (S.: Not that I know\nof.) [I hud the catarrh in mind in saying this when I should have had the\ndeath scene.] I will try and remember all about it, ho says, yet I remember\nheart and head well\nA little later he apparently returns to the recollections of his\nlast moments and says : \" Do you know the last thing I recall is your\nspeaking to me. (S. : Yes, right.) And you were the last to do so.\n(S. : Very well. Was any one else at the bedside 1) I remember\nseeing your face, but I was too weak to answer\" (p. 332).\nI did not discover in this remarkable passage until I was reading the\nsitting over at Dr. Hodgson's office, that it was an attempt to describe\nthe incidents of his death. I was prevented from seeing this l\u00bbcause the\nspasms of the larynx from which he frequently suffered were accom\npanied by great difficulty in breathing, and I disregarded the other\nallusions as automatisms ; until it all at once came upon me, from the\nrecollection indicated in the term \" congestion,\" that he had interpreted\nmy question in another, and in fact, more correct sense, to refer to his\ndeath. At once every one of the incidents indicated assumed a\nperfectly definite meaning, as my note shows very clearly (p. 328).\nThe trouble with his stomach was especially noticed in the morning\nabout seven o'clock. The heart action began to decline about half-past\nnine, and this was followed by increasing difficulty in getting his\nbreath until the struggle for this became one of the most painful\nthings I ever witnessed. Just after the last effort his eyes closed as if\ngoing to sleep, and in a moment the jaw fell and the end came. The\nallusion to the \" congestion \" appeared to suggest telepathy to account\nfor it, as soon as I saw the meaning of the question, as I knew from\nthe doctor's statement that he suffered from congestion in his spasms,\nand I thought that my father knew nothing about it. But the doctor's\ntestimony shows that my father did know the fact (p. 356). It is not\nknown whether he suffered with his eyes during his last moments,\nthough it is probable. The references to his liver and to what was\ninterpreted as \" Bone \" are unintelligible.\nThe allusion to my being the last to speak to him is a remarkable\nincident. When his eyelids fell, as I said, I exclaimed, \" He's gone,\"\nand I was the last to speak. Father had been unable to speak for\nmore than an hour. All these incidents, including the physical\nsymptoms of his dying, are a confirmation of my inference regarding\nthe \" consciousness of dying \" in this very case, though I did not\nmention any names, in the account of it published in the Journal of\nthe S.P.R. (Vol. VIII, pp. 250-255). That inference was that he was\nconscious of dying. The statement, however, that \" at last I went to\n\fxLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 37\nsleep \" might throw some doubt on the implication that I attached to\nthe \"consciousness of dying\" in this case. But it is interesting to\ntrace a perfectly clear consciousness up to the closing of the eyes and\nfalling of the jaw after the motor system refused to allow any expression\nof consciousness.\nThe statement at the close of the message referring to his last\nmoments and illness that he would try and remember it, gave me an\nopportunity to ask him if he remembered what medicine I had gotten for\nhim in New York, this medicine having been obtained for his catarrh.\nI thought that this question might help him out in the answer. He\nsaid :- -\nYes, I do faintly. (S. : Never mind. Tell me about it later, when you\nfeel clear.) James, it was my heart, and I remember it well, and my eyes\ntroubled me also. Do you remember this ? (S. : No, I do not remember\nthis.) Do you not remember what the swelling meant? ^1 remember taking\nhold of my own hands and holding them together over my chest, but strange\nI cannot think of the word I want. I know it so well ton. (S. : Do I know\nit also ?) Oh yes, very well. (S. : Did I ever have the (same sickness ?)\nYes, long ago. (S. : Yes, that is right. What did I do for it ?) This is\nwhat I cannot think, and it troubles me a little, James, because I know it\nso well (p. 330).\nThe first part of the answer to my question seems to be a reversion\nto his sickness after telling him not to worry about the medicine. The\ndifficulty with his eyes I knew nothing about at the time, but learned\nfrom my stepmother, since the sitting, that during the last year of his\nlife he was troubled with his left eye in particular, as well as with his\nlarynx. The reference to the swelling was pertinent, as he often\nexpressed wonder that the outside of his throat should be swollen from\nthe effects of catarrh. He probably held his hands over his breast\nwhen taking the inhaler to bed with him, but this is not verifiable.\nThe answer that I had the same sickness long ago is correct. I had\nthe catarrh very badly between fourteen and twenty-one.\nAfter an interval (occupied by other communicators) my father at\nonce began to try giving the name of the medicine, and apparently\ntried to say quinine (quien), but on being asked if this was what he\nmeant, the hand dissented (p. 332), and after saying that \" it begins\nwith D,\" gave it up with the statement, \" Oh, I know it so well, yet\nI cannot say it when I wish to.\" I repeated the request not to worry\nabout it, saying that it would come again.\nNear the beginning of the sitting of the next clay, December 27th,\nhe undertook to answer the question about the medicine and succeeded.\nHe said : \" I remember Himi [or Hime] S (R. H. : Is that Hume ?)\n(S. : Yes, that is right.) Yes. S. * * * is (?) Hume [?] [not\nclear intermediate letters] hme (?) (S. : Yes, that is right. Now one\n\f:3>S [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nor two words after that.) S nut [?] Serris [?] doings ['!] I cannot\ncatch all now . . . life. . . . You know what is on my mind\nperfectly, James. I used to speak of it often \" (p. 336).\nThe medicine that I got for him was Hyoruei (accented on first\nsyllable) and he came near enough this in \"Himi\" for me not to press\nthe struggle farther. What the \" S \" and \" Serris \" meant was not clear.\nA few minutes later, he resumed the attempt, as follows :\u2014\nI am thinking of Streine (?) Str .... stri .... strycn ... .\nSpeak, speak. (S. : Well, father, ia this Stryo 0 Yea. (S. : Well, what is\nthe next letter ?) Nia .... E . . . . E . . . . Str. Slower, sir, do\nnot speak so fast. I will help you. Now slower\u2014[to spirit.] StR . . .\nStrycnine.\" (S. : Good, father, that is right.) Do you hear me, my son ?\n(S. : Yes, father, I hear you perfectly.) I remember you went and got it for\nme. God bless you, James, he says. And a numerous amount of other\nmedicines [?] which I cannot * * * [undec.] (p. 337).\nI remembered nothing about bis taking strychnine, and ascertained\nfrom my stepmother, my brother, and my sister that he was taking it\nwith the Hyomei. Later I found that my father had mentioned both\narsenic and strychnine in one of his letters to me written about three\nmonths before his death, so that I had forgotten the fact. The\n\" ,S nut \" and \" Serris \" may have been attempts to give one or both of\nthese names. But the Hyomei was the only medicine that I myself\nobtained for him. The strychnine was prescribed for him by the\nphysician where he was living. I learned that my father had taken a\ngreat many different medicines.\nIn getting the confirmation of the strychnine incident, my step\nmother mentioned incidentally another medicine that he had taken in\nconsiderable quantities, and, as a further test, when Dr. Hodgson held\nhis sittings for me, I sent on the question to know whether he remem\nbered any other medicines that he had taken besides the Hyomei and\nthe strychnine, and at about the same time. Dr. Hodgson asked the\nquestion near the close of the sitting on February 8th. On February\nKith Rector stated that it was morphine, and immediatelv afterward\nDr. Hodgson repeated the question to father and he confirmed Rector's\nstatement (p. 384). A little later he spontaneously apologised for\ntaking morphine : \" Do not gather the idea that I was a subject to\nmorphia because I was not, only as a medicine \" (p. 385).\nInquiry showed that he had never taken any morphine and that he\nwas always very strongly opposed to using it. At the opening of\nthe sitting for February 20th, after Dr. Hodgson explained to him\nthat I did not know about the morphine, but was thinking about some\n\" patent medicine,\" be requested Dr. Hodgson to ask me \" if he does\nnot recall the fact of my taking several grains of morphia before I took\n\fXL!.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 3i)\nthe Hyomei!\" (p. 391). This would have been correct if he had said\narsenic. Rector then says :\u2014\n\" I think he will recall it yet,\" and father at once takes up the thread and\nsays : \"It was, if I remomber rightly, I think some months before when I\nhad a bad or ill turn.\" It is true that my father had a specially ill turn\nsome months before he sent for the Hyomei. He then apparently recurs\nto the inquiry about the \"patent medicine,\" and says: \"I will try and\nrecall the name of that preparation\" (p. 391).\nIn a few minutes, and after a respite, he began : \"Yes, I took . . .\nyes, I took HU HUN Yes, I took Munion\n. . . . M U N Y O N sounds like . . . and he repeats again\nand again Gerniside (Gerniside ?) Yes, Germisid e.\" In a few\nminutes again, in response to the question of Dr. Hodgson about any other\nmedicines, he said: \"I took at one time some preparation of oil, but the\nname has gone from my memory. I know everything so well when I am\nnot speaking to you \" (p. 391).\nInquiry discovered that father had never taken any of Munyon's\nCatarrh Remedy, which would be the only one of Munyon's medicines\nthat he would be disposed to get, nor did he take any other of that\nsystem of medicines. But I ascertained that he had often talked of\ngetting this very medicine, having seen it advertised, according to the\ntestimony of my brother, in a circular, and it is widely known as a\ngermicide. The \"preparation of oil\" he did use. It was called\nJapanese Oil, and was sent to him by a friend. . This incident was not\nknown to me.\nOn February 22nd, near the beginning of the sitting, he spon\ntaneously referred (p. 397) to \" taking this vapor preparation to\nwhich I have previously given mention.\" The Hyomei is a vapour.\nThen on the first of my last series of sittings, May 29th, I was at once\naccosted with the question : \" Was it malt you wished me to think\nabout . . . Maltinc you . . .\" (p. 418).\nIf this has any pertinence at all it is an incident like \" Munyon's\nGermiside.\" He never took any Maltine. But when my stepmother\nwrote to my brother that father was losing flesh, my brother, seeing\nthat he was not rightly nourished, at once wrote to father to get some\nMaltine and take it. It is probable that he talked about it, but my\nstepmother does not recall whether he did or not. It thus appears, so\nfar as inquiry goes, that morphine was never taken by my father at\nall ; that Maltine and the Munyon Remedy had both been specially in\nhis mind at one time (though I was never aware of the fact) ; that\nstrychnine was taken by him in connection with the Hyomei ( a fact\nwholly forgotten by me), although I did not obtain it for him ; that\nHyomei, a \"vapor preparation,\" was the special medicine that I did\nget for him, and that I remembered well, and that a \" preparation of\noil \" was taken by him, as was entirely unknown to me.\n\f40 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nA few communications, of little ev idential value, except the allusion\nto my voice being the last he heard when dying, followed the\nattempt to give the medicine in my sitting of December 26th (p. 332),\nand then my uncle interrupted. But his place was very soon taken by\nmy father again with the singular remark (p. 332) : \" Yes, Hyslop. I\nknow who I am. And Annie too,\" as if amused at the confusion of\nmy uncle, which was very evident. He then proceeded with the com\nmunications to me (p. 333).\nAnd long before the sun shall set for you I will give you a full and\ncomplete account of your old father, James. Keep quiet, do not worry\nabout anything, as I used to say. It does not pay. Remember this ? (S. :\nYes, father, I remember that well.) That, James, was my advice always and\nit is still the same. You are not the strongest man you know and health is\nimportant for you. Cheer up now and be quite yourself. (S. : Yes, father,\nI shall. I am glad to hear this advice.) Remember it does not pay and life\nis too short there for you to spend it in worrying. You will come out all safe\nand well and will one day be reunited with us, and we shall meet face to\nface and you will know me well. What you cannot have be content without,\nhealth or anything else, but do not worry, and not for me. This is going\nto be my life, and you will know all that it is possible fur any one to know.\n(S. : Yes, father, I am glad of that. It will be my life here too.) Yes, I\nknow it, and as we lived there so we will also live here. Devoted you were\nto me always, and I have nothing to complain of except your uneasy\ntemperament and that I will certainly help. Only trust in all that is good,\nJames, and be contented whilst you stay and I will certainly be near you. I\nam a little weary, James, but I will return and recall if possible my\nmedicine.\nThe evidences of personal identity are very strong in this whole\npassage, though they will not appear so to the general reader, until he\nis told the fact that one phrase after another of it is exactly what\nmy father constantly used to me in life. \" Do not worry,\" \" it does\nnot pay,\" \" life is too short,\" that we shall be reunited beyond the\ngrave, are all as natural as life to me. Hundreds of times he has\nwarned me that I am not so strong as some men. Of course, the\nincidents are not so striking as most of those upon which I have\ncommented, but they reflect a tone of mind toward me that is exactly\nas I knew my father, and are suggestive of identity on any theory of\nthe phenomena whatsoever. It is clear and intelligible, almost too\nmuch so to escape suspicion. But it has too many psychological\npoints of identity in it to be treated as in any way the prod\u00abct of\nchance.\nThe sitting for December 27th was opened with some general and\nunevidential remarks from my father regarding his condition for com\nmunicating and indications that he had been told by the \" control \"\nthat he would have an opportunity to return and communicate with\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 41\nDr. Hodgson in my absence. The dramatic play in this has its\ninterest, as it involves a question directed to Dr. Hodgson, which was\nclosely enough associated with me for the communicator to expect that\nI would ultimately get the messages. After being assured that he need\n\"not feel troubled because he could have no further talk\" with me at\nthis time, he began at once to ask about his things that he had taken\nwith him when he moved from his old home in Ohio :\u2014\nJames, do you remember what . . . the things I took out West.\n(S. : Yes, father.) Well, are they not for you . . . (S. : Some of them\nI think are. What ones are for me ?) I wish all the books, every one,\nand photos (R. H . : Photos) (S. : Pictures) painting Pictures . . . yes,\nevery one of those of mine. I took them out West you remember. (8. :\nYes, I remember.) I should have said that I wished I would have had you\nhave them before now. [Rector explains.] He speaks too rapidly, fearing\nhe may forget something . . . had said all I wished. Cannot you\nsend for them. I am sure . . . will give them up. (S. : Do you want\none of the books to touch ?) Yes, very much . My diary, anything, diary\n. . . yes, or anything, any one of them. Give me one, James, if\npossible. I have something on my mind (p. 335).\nThere is a curious combination of evidential matter and of appre\nciative reference to the use of the things to which he refers. The first\nevidential fact is the allusion to his moving out West. He did this in\n1889, and, of course, took all his household goods with him, including\nhis books and pictures. He had some photos and two or three chromos\nwhich in his parlance might be safely called \"paintings.\" The mention\nof his diary is also somewhat pertinent, as he had a day-book in which\nhe kept both his accounts and various matters usually put down in a\ndiary, some of the things being directions which I found applying\nto the management of the estate after his death. But, in mentioning\nthe articles here, there is the evident desire that they shall be produced\nto \" hold him \" in the communications. This is a curious recognition\non the \"other side\" of the conditions for satisfactory communication\nwhich we have learned empirically on this side. Why and how they\naffect the results we do not know, but they apparently do as a fact,\nabsurd as it may seem to us. A little later in the same sitting he\nrepeats : \" Get the pictures ; do you not want them, James ? \" (p. 337).\nOn February 8th he alluded to his habit of \"poring over the pages\nof his books and writing out little extracts from them in his diary \"\n(p. 380). This is true except that the extracts which he was accustomed\nto make were not written in his account book. He might have kept\nthem in the diary, but this is now unverifiable. On May 30th he again\nasked me if I remembered his library and books, and inquired what had\nbecome of them, saying, \" I am sure they are all right wherever they\nare, but there are some things on my mind which I must get oft\n\f42 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\n(p. 434). On June 6th he again asked me about the books, and wanted\nto know what I had done with those he had given me (p. 473). Also\non June 8th (p. 490). This will como up later in another connection.\nBut it is referred to at present in order to exhibit the action of\nmemory from sitting to sitting.\nIn the interval between two attempts, December 27th, to give the\nstrychnine (p. 336) he mentioned a knife which has considerable\nevidential importance. He said, \" Do you remember the little knife I\nused to pick out my nails with . . A -(S. : I am not sure, father.)\nThe little brown handle one. I had it in my vest and then in coat\npocket. You certainly must remember it. (S. : Was this after you\nwent out West ?) Yes, I seem to lose part of my recollections between\nmy absence and return, just before I had this change, and the cap I\nused to wear\u2014the cap . . . the cap I used to wear. And this\nI have lost too\" (p. 336).\nI knew nothing of this knife, but wrote to my stepmother,\nbrother, and sister, without telling them what I was doing, to know\nif father ever had such a knife, and received word from all three of\nthem that he did and that they had it yet. I then wrote to know\nwhat he used it for, and received the answer that he used it for paring\nhis nails and various purposes about the house. But it seems that he\ndid not carry it in either his vest or coat pocket, but in his trousers\npocket. It is interesting, however, in this connection to remark his\nown spontaneous intimation of a defective memory.\nA little later, in this same sitting, he recurred to the knife in the\nfollowing manner. \" Ask Willie about the knife. (S. : Yes, father, I will\nask Willie about it, but there is one other boy who will know better than\nhe.) I do not . . . George. (S. : No, not George.) Rob. Did you\nask me to tell the other . . . Roberts (?) Robert. (S. : That is good,\nfather, but not the one. Yes, Robert is the right name, but the one that\nwill remtmber the knife is a younger boy.) \" Rector then added to me :\n\" He [referring to IinperatorJ will explain it to him, and I will get his\nanswer soon \" (p. 337.) A few minutes later father returned to the matter\nas follows: \"Do you mean F James? (S. : Yes, father, I mean\nF.,if you can tell the rest.) Yes, I can remember very well. F R A D ('i) \"\n(p. 337).\nThe names of my brothers, Willie, George, and Robert, alwars-\ncalled Rob., were correct, and the \" D \" in the original automatic\nwriting might justifiably be read as a combination of N and K, which\nwould make the name of the younger brother, Frank, correct and also the\nanswer to my implied question. But we decided to treat the writing\nas a confused letter D with the doubt against instead of for us. The\nright attempt, however, was evidently made, and came nearly enough\nsucceeding to indicate what was intended. The name of Willie had\nbeen spontaneously given in the first sitting (p. 309) and I had tried to\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 43\ndeceive the communicator in the same sitting (p. 307), but the names of\nRob. and Frank were given here for the first time.\nOn February 8th in Dr. Hodgson's sitting for me, after alluding to\nhis pen and paper cutter (Cf. pp. 379, 380), which were contemporary\narticles with the knife, he asked Dr. Hodgson : \" Perhaps you will\nrecall my asking for my knife\" (p. 378). This is a very pretty\nillustration of the unity of consciousness and association with con\ntemporary articles, and a memory of what had been mentioned before,\nDr. Hodgson knowing nothing of the relation between the knife and\nthe articles with which it was associated. The most important points\nin connection with the knife were that my father specifically mentions\nit, that he called it a brown handled one, that he mentioned its special\nuse, and that all the facts were unknown to me.\nIn regard to the cap incident, I said in a short note at the time\nthat I knew nothing about it, and I could have added that I did not\ncare, as I regarded it as absurd\u2014a mere automatism. It was only\nafter it had been mentioned a second time that I made inquiries about\nit. It turned out such an important incident that I must narrate the\nfacts very fully.\nOn February 16th my father sent to me through Dr. Hodgson the\nquestion: \"Do you recall a little black skull-cap I used to wear, and\n\u25a0what has become of it. I have looked and looked for it, but do not\nsee it anywhere about. Answer this for me, James, when you come\nagain \" (p. 387).\nI made inquiries of my aunt whether father ever wore such a cap\nin his early life, and receiving a negative reply (p. 387), dropped\nthe matter. But on February 22nd he said to Dr. Hodgson : \" Did\nyou remind James of my cap ! \" and Dr. Hodgson replied : \" Yes. He\ndoes not remember it.\" My father then said : \" Not remember it 1 Ask\nNannie. You see I was in the West, far from him for some time, and\nmy habits of dress and my doings may not be known to him, but\nthe rest may remember, if he does not \" (p. 406).\nThis is a very remarkable passage, every word of it being true,\nexcept the name Nannie, which the context led me to suspect might\nbe a mistake for Maggie, the name of my stepmother. It led to careful\ninquiries about the cap. I found that my stepmother had made him a\nblack skull-cap to wear at night because he had complained of a cold\nhead on cold nights, having been very bald for many years. But he did\nnot wear the cap more than a few times. It could not be found as no one\nknows what becauie of it. It was at this point that it suddenlv occurred\nto me that the \" Nannie \" was a mistake for my stepmother, as I had\nfound some truth in the incident and observed that the word \"aunt,\"\nwhich had been used for my aunt of that name, had been omitted.\nThere had been some earlier references to the name \" Nannie \" without\n\f44 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthe prefix \" aunt \" (p. 388). I therefore suspected that we had here a\ndistinction between the aunt and my stepmother, and it became a later\nproblem to settle this matter, which I postponed as long as possible\nwith the hope that her name would ultimately be given correctly with\nout suggestion from me. On May 29th he alluded to the cap again\nwithout mentioning my stepmother, and he referred to my brother as\nthe one with whom he had left it \" Do you remember a small\ncap I used to wear occasionally, and I left it, I think, with Francis.\n(R. H. : Francis?) [Hand dissents.] Fred, F R E. I mean\nFredrick (?) [S. shakes his head negatively.] No, not that, but\nwith F.\" (p. 425). My brother Francis, always called Frank in\nnickname for Francis, his correct name, was at home when the cap\nwas made, but there is no reason to suppose that it was left with him\nany more than with my stepmother or any one else. The chief interest\nin this incident is the mention of it a-s if it had not been spoken of\nbefore. The assumption is all along made that I ought to know\nabout the cap, when as a fact I knew nothing whatsoever regarding\nit, so far as I can ascertain, until told after the mention of it in this\nrecord. Some features of this case will come up again when considering\nthe name of my stepmother (p. 69). It is important here only as repre\nsenting an incident of which I knew or remembered nothing, and was\napparently given for the main purpose of identifying himself very\nclearly ; but it only happened in the end to supply any service for this\nobject, though\u2014in the first passage in which it aroused my attention,\nnamely, that in which he alluded to my ignorance of his habits after\nmoving West (p. 406),\u2014it was connected with so much truth that I\nneeded only to know the facts and to confirm my conjecture regarding\nthe intended meaning of the name \" Nannie \" in order to find in this\npassage a strong incident for personal identity.\nReturning to December 27th, just after alluding to the name of\nmy brother George in the knife incident (p. 337) my father took him\nup for some further very pertinent communications. He began :\u2014\n\" Do you hear me . . . what I told you about George ? (S. : Yes, you\nmean before.) Yes, I . . . (S. : Yes, I remember.) I had a great deal to\nthink of there, James. (S. : Yes, father, you did.) And the least said the\nsooner mended. Hear? (S. : Yes, father, I hear.) Do you understand?\n(S. : Yes, father, I understand.) I will work now, and unceasingly as I can\nfor him \" (p. 337). The pertinent parts of this message are the reference\nto the \" much to think of there \" and the phrase \" the least said the sooner\nmended.\" My notes explain both of them (p. 348). Then after he had\nattempted to give the name of Frank in response to my desire for it, he\nmade a number of relevant observations, generally very pertinent though\nnot specifically evidential, such as the wish to \"step in and hear me at tl*e\ncollege,\" an explanation of why he had done so much for me, and finally his\nproposal to \"right matters to his own liking, especially with the boys\"\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena.\n(p. 338). My father did have much anxiety in connection with my brother\nGeorge, and as I learned later from my aunt, the phrase, \" the least said the\nsooner mended,\" was a common expression before my time in the family,\nand used to describe situations of the kind indicated here, and which was\nfully exemplified in the prudential method that father always employed in\nhis correspondence with me about my brother (p. 349).\nAt this point in the communications we interfered to read to my\nfather some statements that I had prepared beforehand for the\npurpose. The arrangements for this had to be made with Rector, so\nthat he would understand what I wanted. I had prepared some\nexplanation of my reticence as influenced by the desire to avoid making\nsuggestions, and some items indicating my general object in the experi\nments and its relations to the general beliefs of my father, in order\npartly to reveal my identity more clearly than I had done, and partly\nto call out some expression from him that would indicate what I knew\nof his religious life, as none of it up to this point had revealed itself.\nWhen the proposition was made to Rector, he explained at once that\nmy father could get the messages only in fragments now, and that we\nshould have to repeat it later (p. 338). As soon as this was under\nstood we placed the accordion on the table to \" hold him,\" and I began\nto read my message slowly to the hand. I first explained why I had\nnot asked him many questions, saying that I had desired to\navoid making suggestions, when I received the very appreciative\nanswer : \" Ah, yes, I remember the difficulties.\" In my conversation\nwith him on this subject and the early Piper reports, I had explained\nto him fully the danger of suggesting our answers by our questions,\nwhen experimenting with mediums. I then proceeded, and in refer\nring to the ultimate significance of work likely to prove a future life,\nsaid, with the purpose of exciting his religious consciousness, \"You\nknow it is the work of Christ and you will remember that I always\nsaid that I wished to live the life of Christ, even if I was not a\nbeliever.\" As soon as this sentence was finished, and before I could go\non with the next sentence, Rector took the hand away, and, as if\nhaving said to the communicator, \" do you hear that 1 \" quickly wrote :\n\" Perfectly. Yes, that is surely James.\" My statement, of course,\ncould suggest the reply, but it is interesting as having been said to\nRector and not to me, and comes through, either as an automatism, or\nas a message whose value Rector could appreciate and deliver for our\npurpose. I went on and closed with the desire that he should work on\nthe \" other side,\" as I should on this, to do the work of Christ. He\nsaid : \" Yes. \/ mil and unceasingly. You know my thoughts well,\nand you also know what my desires were before entering this life\nAnd you also know whom I longed to meet and what I longed to\ndo for you . . whom I longed to meet he says. (S. : Yes, father,\n\f4G [part\n.\/. \/\/. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nI know well.) Good. Keep it in mind, James, and I will push from\nthis side while you call from yours, and we will sooner or later come\nto a more complete understanding \" (p. 340).\nThe pertinence of this is the fact that father had always believed\nhe would meet Christ face to face after death, and was very much hurt\nwhen he found that I could no longer accept the beliefs and hopes of\northodoxy. Presently I asked him directly whether he remembered\nmuch of his religious life (p. 310), and he replied: \"Yes, I think I do\nnearly everything, and my views whereas they were not just correct in\neverything, yet they were more or less correct, and I have found a\ngreat many things as I had pictured them in my own earthly mind.\n.Since Christ came to the earthly world there has been an almost\nconstant revelation of God and His power over all\" (p. 341). He\nthen asked me if I remembered our conversation about Swedenborg,\nwhich I have already mentioned, and to which I refer again for the\nsake of the pertinence of its connection. The passage just quoted,\nwhile it contains no incident that is evidential, has a tone about\nit that is not telepathic, as it reflects alleged facts neither in my\nmind nor in his terrestrial experience, but which would be quite natural\nif the spiritistic theory be correct. It is perhaps not beyond the\npower of a secondary consciousness to produce the like, and I refer\nto the incidents only for the psychological unity of purpose in them and\ntheir appreciation of the situation, with occasional touches of identity\nin them, too slight to be marked by any one but myself. But compare\nwith this the whole passage in which the reference to the hymn,\n\" Nearer My God to Thee \" occurs, where also there is marked the\nsame apparent change of opinions held in life (p. 389). For a peculiar\ninterest attaching to the words \" push \" and \" call \" the reader may\nconsult the notes on page 340.\nAfter the allusion to Swedenborg, he immediately reverted to the\nsubject of my reticence, and said very pertinentlv : \" I am glad you have\nnot given me any suggestions for your sake, but it has perplexed me a\nlittle, and at times seemed unlike yourself. I faintly recall the trouble\non the subject of spirit return.\" After what I said above, the pertinence\nof this needs no explanation. Immediately following this, I asked him\nwho was with us on that occasion, and he replied that he did not\nunderstand my question. I repeated it, and he said it was in New\nYork, evidently still misunderstanding my query. I was living in New\nYork at the time. I dropped the matter, as I saw there was some\nconfusion about it, and in the attempt to mention a few moments later\nthose whom he had not yet mentioned, he said : \" No, I think 1 have\nsent all except sister. (S. : Yes, I think perhaps you are right. One\nthing I had not understood. Now which sister is this?) I mean\nNan. R [P ?] Mannie, and after my acknowledgment added \"Give my\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 47\nlove to her, of course.\" Then, after a sentence or two to myself,\nsaid : \" Tell Eliza too ; both. And tell them to believe and trust in\nGod always, and I will often bring comfort to Eliza in her sorrow \"\n(p. 342). My father's sister Eliza had lost her husband very suddenly\nby an accident just a month previous to the sittings, and he had been a\ncommunicator in the second sitting (p. 314). The other sister, Nannie,\nhad also lost her husband almost as suddenly just two months before.\nBut I received absolutely no communications from him. But there is\nsome reason to suppose that the \" Nan \" immediately changed to\n\"Mannie\" was an attempt to say \"Maggie'' (Cf. pp. 312, 365), which\nwas the name of my stepmother, and which would have been the\ncorrect answer to my question. It is equally possible that both my\naunt Nannie and my stepmother were intended, though the use of\n\" both \" and the reference to his sister Eliza a little later is against\nthis and perhaps in favour of the reference to his sister Nannie alone.\nImmediately after the allusion to my two aunts the record proceeds :\n\" Bo you remember the glasses (S. : What glasses ?) and where they\nare? She has them, I think. (S. : Yes. Who has them?) Nani.\n(S. : No, not Nannie.) Ani. (S. : What glasses did you ask about 1)\nM . . . Mnni. (S. : Whom did you leave them with ?) I am thinking.\nIt was Eliza. I do not think I said just right.\" The sitting had\nthen to come to a close before anything more could be said (p. 343).\nMy father died in the house of my aunt Eliza, and he did leave\nhis spectacles there. Myself and stepmother Maggie took them from\nthere after his death, but in saying that he did not \" think he said\njust right,\" he evidently had in mind the mention of my stepmother\nas the person with whom he left them, which would also have been\ncorrect. Had the statement been : \" I left them with Maggie at\nEliza's,\" it would have been exactly the truth, which is only vaguely\nhinted at here. The possible meaning of \" Nani,\" \" Ani,\" and \" Mnni \"\nin their connection with Maggie is indicated later (p. 365-6).\nIt may be a matter of some interest to the reader that at the close\nof this sitting, as Mrs. Piper came out of the trance, she uttered the\nfull name of my father, \" Robert Hyslop.\"\nOn February 7th Br. Hodgson opened his series of sittings on my\nbehalf. They are full of an interest additional to the evidential one\nfor personal identity. The dramatic play of personality, which I shall\ndiscuss later, is a most striking characteristic of them. The first\nfour of then are not so plentiful in specific evidence for identity, but\nstill have sufficient to show that we were dealing with the same con\nsciousness. Two or three very important matters occurred in them,\nand the last had as significant incidents as any of the sittings which\nI attended personally.\n\f4N [part\nJ. H. Byslop, Ph.D.\nAfter the usual preliminaries in the first sitting of this series,\nRector remarked that if Dr. Hodgson had no more questions, he would\nbring my father to him at once. A singular piece of dramatic play\nfollowed, in which a colloquy occurred on the \"other side,\" indicating\na misunderstanding on my father's part as to the person to whom he\nwas to communicate. He appears to have thought he was to communi\ncate to me as before, and the matter had to be explained to him, the\ndetails of the \" transcendental \" conversation appearing in the record (p.\n370). As soon as he understood the situation, he began with a refer\nence to the Swedenborg incident to say that he was glad that I under\nstood him, Dr. Hodgson some time before having sent my word to him\nthrough Rector that he was right about it (pp.370, 341). Then he\nwent on with a message for me. The first was : \" I am thinking of\nthe time some years ago when I went into the mountains for a change\nwith him, and the trip we had to the lake after we left the camp, and\nI have often thought of this.\" There follows immediately a long\naccount of an accident to the train and engine on one trip out West in\nwhich he said \" we or I was caught.\" The description of the accident\nis very detailed. But father never took any trip with me to the\nmountains, and the allusion to such a trip has to be set down as false,\nthough my note shows how slightly the statement would have to be\naltered to be true (Note 26, p. 408). But no accident occurred on any\ntrip that I or any one else can remember, though I do remember a\ndelay on the trip in 1861.\nIt was necessary after the long account of the accident to give him\nthe spectacle case to \" hold him.\" He recognised it, though this fact\nhad no evidential value. But there was a very pretty piece of dramatic\nplay connected with it. Rector saw the effect of the effort to describe\nthe accident and asked for a book. Dr. Hodgson gave the tin spectacle\ncase, saying that this was all he had with him. Through Rector the\nrecognition was made and the case called a \"spectacle case,\" instead of\n\" glasses case,\" in correction of the latter, the former being his usual\nname for it. This, however, is a slight matter, but when he said\ndirectly : \" I am quite sure of what I am saying to you, my friend. I\nthink Nannie will remember this also very well. You might speak to\nher about it or ask James to do so,\" he indicated a correct appreciation\nof the situation, and was correct as to the source for confirmation\nof his statements about the existence of the case for years in the\nfamily\u2014supposing that this was the usual name intended for my\nstepmother (Cf. pp. 69,366). The rest of the sitting was taken up with\nan explanation by Dr. Hodgson of the nature of the experiment and\nits object, so that my father could better understand it. He expressed\nhis appreciation of my desire and promised to satisfy it. The sitting\nthen came to an end.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 49\nThe sitting of February 8th opens with communications from\nImperator, Rector, and Doctor, before Rector takes his place as\namanuensis in the intended communications from my father. The\nreason for this is not explained on this occasion, but it is sometimes\nalleged that Imperator \" comes in,\" or writes for the purpose of\n\"restoring the light,\" as the agency by which they communicate is\ncalled. In this connection a curious statement is made by Imperator,\njust before the communications of my father begin. Through Rector\nhe said that it would be impossible to answer for Mr. W. on that day,\nas it would necessitate using too much light, and they must give this\nfor \"this kind gentleman, viz., Mr. Hyslop.\" The messages from my\nfather then began, as follows :\u2014\nGood morning, James. I am glad to be here again. I am your father\nstill who is trying to help you find me. I recall quite vividly some few\nrecollections which I think will interest you somewhat. I remember some\nyears ago of sending George some of the photos taken of the library, and\nhe said he would return copies after he had finished them. I also recall\nthe disturbance and trouble I had with one of my eyes, the left one. Do\nyou not remember this and the little so-called . . . what . . .\nP . . . A . . . yes I hear. Pad. Pad. I had a peculiar mark which you\nwill recall, at the back of the ears [ear ?] (p. 377).\nThe first matter of interest in this passage is the evident supposition\nof my father that he is communicating with me directly, and he does\nnot discover until later (p. 379) that he is talking to Dr. Hodgson.\nBut he shows a memory of the conversation with Dr. Hodgson in the\nprevious sitting, where the object of the sittings was explained, and\nthe incidents here mentioned are a clear effort to fulfil the promise\nthere made. But the first one has little truth in it. Father had no\n\" library \" proper. He kept his books and did his reading in what\nhe called, with everybody in his neighbourhood, the sitting-room. I\nfind in these sittings, however, that \" library \" is uniformly employed\nfor just this room in his house. But he never had any photographs\nof it taken. He had sent my brother, on the occasion of the latter's\nmarriage, photos of himself and our mother, which hung in a room\nupstairs, and my brother has them yet. But there was nothing said\nor expected about getting copies of them returned. This was in 1884.\nIt is worth remarking in this connection that a younger brother about\nthis time was engaged in canvassing for the reproduction of photo\ngraphs, and secured many such from various persons to be returned\nafter finishing them. I cannot ascertain whether he had any of father's\nfor the purpose. There is nothing in the message, however, that would\nlead me to suppose that this was meant. We can only conjecture its\npossibility from what we know of the general sources of confusion.\nThe disturbance with the left eye and the spot near the left\near were more pertinent. In response to my inquiry about the\nE\n\f50 [part\nJ. H, Ilyslop, Ph.D.\ntrouble with his eyes, which I had connected with what was said about\nthe death scene, and about any marks behind the ears, as indicated\nhere, I received from my stepmother a negative answer. But when I\nread the record over to her this summer she noticed that the statement\nwas with reference to the left eye and at once and decidedly confirmed it,\nstating that he often took his spectacles off and complained of trouble\nwith the left eye. She still said, however, that there was no mark\nbehind his ears, but incidentally remarked that there was a spot or\nmole in front of the left ear and concealed by his side whiskers. Of\nthe existence of this I never knew, as I had never known my father\nwithout whiskers. One incident may then be taken as wholly correct\nand the other as nearly so.\nDr. Hodgson had asked him to tell what was in the tin box or\nspectacle case, and he remarked after a pause that he used to put his\npen in it, but immediately corrected the statement, which was false,\nand said that it was where he kept his \" paper cutter,\" which was also\nfalse. I had supposed that the allusion to a \" paper cutter \" was absurd\nin any case, as I knew that father's reading never required such an\nimplement. He had not bought a book for forty years and none of his\npapers required cutting, so I rejected the allusion as false. But on\ninquiry I found that my brother Frank had made him a small paper\ncutter for opening his letters and that he usually carried it in his vest\npocket. But his pen was actually in this tin box at the sitting and\nthe box had not yet been opened. He then made an allusion to his\nknife, which has already been quoted, and asked to go away for a\nminute and return (p. 378).\nAs soon as he returned, which was in a few moments evidently, as\nlittle writing had been done in the meantime, he at once seemed\nclearer, and recognised that it was not I to whom he was communica\nting : \" Here I am. Yes, I see, you are not really James, but his\nfriend. Glad I am to know you. (R. H. : I am very glad). Yes, I\nremember I used to have this little case on my desk a great deal.\nYes. And I am sure I used to place my spectacles in it. Yes,\nand some time my paper cutter \" (p. 379). It was probably not\nthis but the leather spectacle case that he kept on his desk at\ntimes. But he kept his gold spectacles in this tin case, and the\ncase in his trousers pocket, I believe the trousers that he wore\n\u25a0on special occasions such as going to church, etc. But he never\nput his paper cutter in the case, at least, according to the memory\nof any one living. A moment later Dr. Hodgson asked him again to\nsay what was in the box and the reply was, \"Looks like my glasses.\"\nHis gold glasses were in it, but the statement, though correct, is not\nimportant, as it might be guessed from the nature of the case. No\nclairvoyance is indicated by the experiment.\n\fXLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 51\nHis favourite book, Anderson's \"Lectures on Theology,\" was shortly\nafterwards presented, and before the title of it was mentioned to him\nthere was a confused attempt at giving it in the word Ferdinand.\nThen Dr. Hodgson asked him the question which I had sent about\nother medicines than those already mentioned. He was then given\nuntil the next sitting to think it over, and after some communications\nfrom Prudens and Rector, the sitting came to a close with but a few\nevidential incidents from my father. But the dramatic play through\nout was a most interesting feature of the sitting, as it marked a\nsingular contrast between the intelligent and clear conversation of the\ntrance personalities and the difficulties and confusions attending the\nefforts of my father;\u2014a fact of some importance as showing that we\ncannot attribute the difficulties of intelligent communication to the\n-subjective condition of the medium, for in this case we should have to\nexpect the confusion of a communicator coinciding with that of the\ntrance personalities, which seems never to occur in any way reflecting\non the spiritistic theory.\nThe next sitting was on February 16th. It opened correctly\nenough with an attempt to mention the medicine to which the\nprevious day's question had reference, and which he had taken in\nadoption to what I had been told ; but the medicine named, morphine,\nwas a mistake. Some further attempt followed to name the contents\nof the spectacle case, the spectacles being named, but nothing else.\nWhile doing this, he recalled the fact that he had often heard of Dr.\nHodgson while he was \" in the body,\" a fact that was true, as I had\nmentioned Dr. Hodgson in the conversations discussed (p. 385). Some\nfurther conversation followed with Dr. Hodgson, but it is of too little\nevidential value to be repeated here. It is intelligible and consistent\nwith the communications generally, but has no weight. Just as Rector\nremarked that he seemed \" quite clear just now \" and expressed the\ndesire to have him asked another question that I had sent on, Dr.\nHodgson put it :\u2014\" Do you remember Samuel Cooper, and can you say\nanything about him 1 \" There had been some difficulty between the\ntwo men and an alienation for years followed, and I hoped to bring my\nfather's mind back to his old home in Ohio by it. The answer was\nabsurd and false with reference to Samuel Cooper. But the sequel\nshowed that there were some facts in the answer that were relevant\nto a Joseph Cooper. As the incidents connected with the name finally\nhave very considerable importance I shall group together all that\npertain to this question. The answer began and was repeated later :\u2014\nHe refers to the old friend of mine in the West. I remember the visits\nwe used to make to each other well, and the long talks we had concerning\nphilosophical topics. Let me think this over, James, and I will answer it\ncompletely and tell you all about him (p. 386).\nb 2\n\f52 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nNot a word of this was true with reference to Samuel Cooper.\nBut at the next sitting, February 20th, the question was repeated to\nRector to take to him (p. 394). At the opening of the next sitting,\nwhich was on February 22nd, he said (p. 397) :\u2014\nAnd the name Cooper is very clear to me also as I had a friend by the\nname who was of philosophical turn of mind, and for whom I had great\nrespect, with whom I had some friendly discussion and correspon\ndence. I had also several tokens [?] which I recollect well. One was\na photo, to which I referred when James was present, and in my collec\ntion, among my collection. Do you recall, James, the one to which I refer ?\nI know this clearly, and I have met him here. He is, if you recall, on this\nside of life with me, and came some years before I did. I liked much his\nphilanthropic views, and as you will remember, a close companionship with\nhim. I am too weak to remain, will return in a moment.\nAmong my collection of letters you will also find several of his which I\npreserved. I remember a discussion on the subject of religion with him\nsome years ago. Doubtless you are thinking of this also. There are many\nthings I can recall concerning him later. Look for my letters, also the photo\nto which I refer, James.\nAt the sitting of May 29th, which was the first of my last series\nof personal experiments, the several questions left over from Dr.\nHodgson's sittings were approached spontaneously, and after Dr.\nHodgson was sent out of the room father began :\u2014\n1 am here again. I am trying to think of the Cooper school and his\ninterest there. Do you remember how my throat troubled me. (S. : Yes.>\nI am not troubled about it, only thinking. (S. : I am glad to hear that.) I\nremember my old friend Cooper very well and his interests, and he is witli\nme now. (S. : Yes, I am glad to hear it. Tell about him.) He is with me\nnow. He maintained the same ideas throughout. And perhaps you will\nrecall a journey U D we took together (p. 420).\nOn May 30th again he said : \" I have talked it over with my old\nfriend Cooper, and we both agree that we will very clearly speak our\nminds here. We are the same friends to-day that we always were, and\nJames also \" (p. 427). This statement only made confusion worse con\nfounded from my standpoint. The James mentioned I could not\nidentify, but Rector went on : \" Let me speak, R. There is a gentleman\non our side named James also. Kindly do not get the one here confused\nwith the one in the body \" (p. 427). This is an interesting piece of\ndramatic play. I thought of my uncle James Carruthers, but, as\nmy uncle James McClellan communicated later, it might refer to him,\nthough there is no evidence here for this, and, so far as pertinence is\nconcerned, might be James anybody (Cf. p.' 445). It is appropriate\nto add, however, that I ascertained from his living daughters that my\nuncle James McClellan was a warm admirer and most probably a\npersonal friend of this Dr. Cooper (Cf. p. 427). In the sitting of\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 53\nMay 31st, near the close (p. 445), he said again, coming to the subject\nspontaneously :\u2014\nI want to tell you all . . . Samuel Cooper. You remember you asked\nme what I knew of him. Did you think I was no longer friend of his ? I had\nseveral letters which he wrote to me concerning our difference of opinion,\nand I think they were with you. Have you got thein 1 (S. : I shall look\nthem up. Do you remember any other differences with him ?) I think I do\non the subject of this very question, his religious views.\nImmediately following, father begins to ask about his family, and\nthen remarks that he is getting confused and leaves (p. 445). On\nJune 1st (p. 452), just after my sister Annie gave a long communica\ntion, my father suddenly broke in :\u2014\nYea, I am back again now. I heard you say it was strange I could not\ntell you more about Cooper. What did you mean by that ? (S. : I wanted\nto know if you remembered anything about the dogs killing sheep ?)\n[Excitement in hand.] Oh, I should think I did. Yes, I do very well, but I\nhave forgotten all about it. This was what we had the discussion about, and\nI made it unpleas[ant] for him. Yes, very well, James, but just what you\nasked me this for I could not quite make out as he was no relation of mine. I\nremember it all very well and if I could have recalled what you were getting\nat I would have tried to tell you, but I see him seldom, and I referred to\nhim only because you asked me about him. (S. : Yes. All right, father, I\nwanted it for my scientific purpose.) Oh yes. Why did you not just remind\nme of it? Well, I will work for you and to remind you of other things\nquite as good. But don't hurry me, and in time I can talk to you just as I\nused to.\nThe excitement in the hand and the reference to the unpleasantness\nwere perfectly pertinent, though it left all else that had been connected\nwith the name of Cooper in its original obscurity. This Samuel Cooper's\ndog had taken part in killing some of father's sheep, and some un\npleasantness arose in connection with the shooting of the dog, and\nthe two remained unfriendly for years, when they were finally recon\nciled in a beautiful manner a short time before Mr. Cooper's death.\nBut it is strange that this incident in their lives was not recalled at\nonce by my father.\nWhen I went West to look up some incidents in these sittings, I\nwas explaining the confusion and error in these messages about Mr.\nCooper, and my mother remarked that father was well acquainted with\nDr. Joseph Cooper, of Alleghany Theological Seminary, and that he had\nprobably corresponded with him at one time. She added that father\nalways spoke of him in the highest terms, and made it a point to see him\nwhen he could at the synodical meetings of the United Presbyterian\nChurch. I probably have heard of the man, but I certainly knew nothing\nof father's interest in him, and still less of certain incidents in the\n\f54 [part\n\/. H. Hyslup, Ph.D.\ncommunications of great pertinence. The allusion to his being a friend\nout West is not strictly true ; but father knew of the Cooper Memorial\nSchool at Sterling, Kansas, which was built in memory of this Dr.\nCooper (Note 39, p. 499). Father's trip to Kansas with my stepmother\nwas a few years before the building of this Memorial School.i All the\nlanguage applied to his being of a philosophical turn of mind is strictly\ncorrect, and from what I learn of his opinions and character he was\njust the man for father to correspond with about the time of the for\nmation of the U. P. Church in 1858. What had therefore appeared\noriginally as nonsense and false turns out to have a pertinence that\nwas wholly unexpected, especially as a means for examining the claims\nof telepathy. The reference to \" tokens \" is very interesting. They\nwere little coin-like pieces of metal that were used at the communion\nservices of the church of which my father was a member. This was a\nname by which they were always called. My father was the ruling\nelder, and it was his duty to keep these tokens in security. When the\ncongregation at his old home was dissolved he put the tokens away in\na chamois skin bag, and after his death they came into my possession.\nI kept them as a memento. The connection in which they are men\ntioned is the most interesting part of the message (See Note 29, p.410).\nTo return to Dr. Hodgson's sitting of February 16th, this first\nallusion to the Cooper incidents was followed by the second mention of\nhis skull-cap and then by an inquiry sent through Rector for \"a special\npen or quill, as he calls it, with which he used to write \" (p. 387). In\na moment he said : \" I recall a thin black coat or dressing gown affair\nI used to wear mornings, I can see myself sitting in my old armchair\nbefore the open fire in the library reading over the paper. Look at me\nthere, James, and see me in the gown I refer to and answer me.\"\nAfter some allusions to me he said : \" As I grew older, we grew together,\ni.e., companionable, as we were much together, and Nannie I often\nthink of her and her faithfulness to me. Did you realise that my\nbronchial trouble disturbed me much?\" (p. 387).\nMy father used a quill pen constantly in earlier life, and before he\ngot the gold pen which was in the spectacle case, I remember his\nmaking quill pens for me. My stepmother says he did have a thin\nblack coat for morning wear in the house, and I remember him well in\nhis armchair before the open fire reading his paper. In fact, he did\ni The statement made in the New York Independent (Vol. LIL, p. 750), that my\nfather had visited the Cooper Memorial School with my stepmother in 1884 is incor\nrect. My stepmother knew of this institution, and in my conversation with her\nabout the Cooper incidents I misunderstood an oral statement about the visit to\nKansas in 1884 with father to be that they had visited this school. She corrected my\nerror soon after reading the article. The \" Cooper School \" was not built until several\nyears later (Cf. p. 500).\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 5 5\nall his reading in it. But I knew nothing of a \" thin black coat \" con\nnected with his habits. I find from my stepmother that he did use such\na coat as here described during the last year or two of his life when I\nknew little or nothing of his personal habits. We did grow more com\npanionable as he grew older, and were much together when we were\ntogether at all. My visits were not frequent after 1889. He became\nmore reconciled with my free-thought, as he found that there were\npoints of agreement between us that he had hardly expected. The\nallusion to the faithfulness of Nannie is very pertinent, assuming that\nthe name is a mistake for my stepmother, as later developments\nunequivocally indicate is the case. He was an object of her special\ncare for the last six or seven years, and more or less for twenty\nyears of his life. The allusion to bronchial trouble explains itself\nafter my statement regarding his cancer of the larynx. It is interest\ning also to remark that the black coat, the reading of his paper in the\narmchair and the open fire, the bronchial trouble and the black skull\ncup were contemporaneous with the time when he had special reason\nto think of my stepmother in the manner indicated here.\nShortly afterwards he put a question regarding my sister Annie, and\nthere followed some very remarkable passages between him and Dr.\nHodgson, that I must give in full :\u2014\nDo you remember your sister Annie ? (Did James have a sister Annie ?)\nYes. (All right. I will tell him.) She is here with me, and she is calling\nto you. (Mr. Hyslop.) Yes, I hear you. What do you wish 'i\n(It is curious. I know your son James very well, and we tire interested\ntogether in this work. I have a sister Annie also, and she is still in the\nbody, and I think your views in the body were probably not unlike my own\nfather's, and you might be interested to meet my father over there, and you\ncan talk to him about James, and perhaps he will tell you something about\nme. I think you and my father would get along very well.)\nWell, I am glad to know this, and I will surely look him up [Cf. p. 389.]\nbut you will remember one thing, and that is that my Annie is not yours.\n(Yes, I understand. She's with you.) Yes, and I will surely find your father\nand know him. These kind friends will help me to find him. (Yes, they will :\nthey will introduce you to him. I shall be very pleased if they will.)\nWas he very orthodox do you think 1 (Fairly so.) Well, there is no need\nfor it here. However, we won't discuss that until later, when we know\neach other better. (He was a Wesleyan Methodist.) Well this, of course,\nwas more or less orthodox. (Yes. Oh yes, indeed.) Exactly, well we will\nget on finely soon. I know this perfectly well. But I must get accustomed\nto this method of speech, and see how I can best express my thoughts to\nyou. (Yes.) I am now thinking of my own things and concerns. I can\npreach myself very mil. Ask my son if this is not so. [Cf. p. 432.] I\nrecall many things which I would gladly have changed if it had been as clear\nto me as it is now. I wish I could take my knife a moment, as it will .\n[Knife from parcel C, given to hand.] It will help me when I return to you.\n\f56 \/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nI do not think I can say more to you now. (Well, I am very pleased to\nhave had this talk with you, and I am sure that James will be glad to read\nwhat you told me about the medicine and gown and reading the paper and\nso on.) Well, I have so many things to say of much greater importance\nin a way later, when I can fully and clearly express myself. I am anxious\nto do much for him. (Yes.) Will you excuse me. I must go. (Yes,\ncertainly. Good-bye for the present. Thank you very much.) [Excite\nment.] There is one tune going through my mind. Listen. Nearer my\nGod to Tlue. Hyslop.\" The sitting then came to an end (pp. 389-390).\nThe mention of my sister Annie was pertinent, and the conversa\ntion with Dr. Hodgson perfectly appreciative and intelligible, as every\none acquainted with Calvinism and Wesleyanism will recognise. My\nfather was a Calvinist. It was a curious episode to ask if Dr.\nHodgson's father was orthodox, after Dr. Hodgson expressed the\nprobability that his father and mine would agree in their views, and\nthe statement, in reply to Dr. Hodgson's characterisation of his father\nas a Wesleyan, that this was \"more or less orthodox\" could be treated\nas a mediumistic echo of Dr. Hodgson's \" fairly so \" in reply to father's\nquestion. Hence, when I read the quotation from the hymn \" Nearer\nmy God to Thee,\" which will appear so pertinent to readers generally, it\ncan be imagined how opposed to personal identity it was, if I say that\nmy father was always strictly opposed to hymn-singing in any form of\nworship. He belonged to a denomination which would not tolerate it.\nThe quotation thus appeared to me to be a fine case of mediumistic\ninterpretation from the secondary consciousness, which we might\nsuppose familiar enough with Wesleyanism to venture on some hymn\nafter allusion to that creed. There was the lone allusion by father to\nhis \" preaching\" himself which suggested identity and which was true of\nhim, but not as a lay preacher, for he would not accept any right to\npreach as that term is usually understood, until the \" laying on of the\nhands \" was performed on some one specially prepared for the work.\nBut the church which he attended could not have services all the year\nround, and as he would not allow us to attend any other church service\nfor many years, and until his own church was dissolved, he would read\na sermon to us or comment on a chapter in the Bible on Sundays when\nwe had no preaching, and he called this a substitute for the sermon.\nBut when calling my stepmother's attention to the terrible way in\nwhich the allusion to this hymn told against my father's personal\nidentity, she decidedly agreed with my judgment, but innocently\nremarked, without seeing the point, that father had a special dislikefor\nthis very hymn, and used often to express his sur1rrise that orthodox\npeople could siny a Unitarian hymn ! The discovery of this fact,\nabsolutely unknown to me, completely changes the whole colouring of\nthe conversation. This, together with the allusion to his preaching,\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 57\nexplains the reference to what he \" would have gladly changed if it\nhad been as clear as it is now,\" and also the expression that there\nwas .\" no need of orthodoxy \" there. There is thus a distinct under\ncurrent of changed and consistent conviction throughout it all, with\nthe two evidential facts of his \" preaching \" and of the reference to the\nhymn that ought naturally to be suggested in this connection, and\nwhen his aversion to it is known in connection with this evident\nchange of feeling, it turns into one of the most remarkable passages\nin the record (Of. pp. 340, 424).\nIts importance and cogency are very much strengthened by father's\nspontaneous statement at the opening of his communications at my\nlast sitting, June 8th (p. 490). He addressed Dr. Hodgson as follows :\n\" I know your father very well. (R. H. : I am very pleased that you have\nmade his acquaintance.) I find our minds were not quite the same\nwhen on earth, but our ideas of God were.\" This is undoubtedly\ncorrect in its import, and shows an interesting memory adjusted\nto the situation. But it contradicts the impression that Dr.\nHodgson's language on that occasion was calculated to make in expres\nsing the likelihood that their views would agree. I could have said at\nthe time, had I been present, that they would not agree.\nAt Dr. Hodgson's sitting of February 20th, following the one that\nI have been discussing, the first incident regarded the Munyon's\nGermicide which I have already mentioned. Then a long conversation\ntook place between Rector and Dr. Hodgson regarding the best way to\nconduct the experiments with my father. When this was over, the\nquestions about Samuel Cooper and the strychnine were repeated, and\nthe spectacle case was put into the hand again. Some of the same\nreferences to paper-cutter, etc., that were made before were given again,\nand mention made of a writing pad, some \" number rests,\" and two\nbottles that used to stand on his desk, one of them round and the other\nsquare. My mother did not recall all of these at first, owing probably\nto the nature of my questions, but did afterwards, and my brother\nremembers the bottles, one an ink and the other a mucilage bottle\ndistinctly. The writing pad was correct and the \" number [of] rests \" if\nthey refer to the shelves on his desk, used as rests, is correct. But\nnothing more of importance occurred in this sitting.\nThe next sitting by Dr. Hodgson was held on February 22nd. The\nfirst references were to the medicine, a photo and the Cooper incident,\nalready discussed. After closing this he began telling about a cane,\nwhich, though the story seems much confused, issues in such an impor\ntant incident that it must be given at length.\nNow what can I do for you ? Do you remember the stick I used to carry,\nwith the turn in the end, on which I carved my initials ? If so, what\nhave you done with it ? They are in the end. (Yes, I understand.) I used\n\f58 [part\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nto use it for emphasising expression occasionally. [Hand strikes pencil on\nbook several times.] (Thumping down 1 ) [Hand keeps repeating a turning\nmotion.] Yes, he turns it about and then carelessly drops it . . . the\nend of it. Understand ? (Yes. I think so. ) If not, speak now before he\nbecomes in any way confused. [This was Rector's statement to Dr. Hodgson,\nbut father proceeds] James. [The hand was apparently listening to spirit\nand I turned to arrange some sheets of paper on the floor.] Look, friend\n[said Rector] . . . Do you wish to go to the college this A. M. ? If so\nI will remain here . . . understand ? [The hand between each word of\nthe first sentence above stopped writing and made a turn, somewhat like the\nmotion that the hand would make in wiping once round the bottom of a\nbasin ending palm up.] (Rector, now, in this way ?) Wait [?] [Hand turns\nto spirit, then to me] (Rector, that way ?) [I read the sentence over,\nimitating the movements of the hand] Yes (with a twirl of the stick ?)\nnervously. This is almost identical with his gestures. He is amused at our\ndescription, friend, and seems to vaguely understand our imitation. Draws\nit across his so-called knee, lets it fall by his side, still holding on to the\nturned end. Hears sounds of music, to which he listens attentively, with\nthe exception of keeping time with the smaller end of his stick (p. 397).\nWhen I first read this, I recalled a cane with a \" turn\" in it, which\nI had given father myself at the request of my aunt Nannie, who\nfurnished the money and wished her name concealed in the affair,\ntelling me that the one he used was broken, as she reminded me since\nthis sitting. But I never knew father to carve his initials on anything.\nI wrote to my stepmother to know if he had carved his initials on his\ncane, and received an emphatic negative for reply. No one seems to\nhave recalled another cane, a gold-headed ebony one on which his\ninitials were carved on the end as indicated in the message, which\nhad been given him by us children years before, and which had been\nlost on the cars on one of his trips. It was lost by his brother-in-law,\nwho gave him another stout plain cane with a curved end. I had\ncompletely forgotten this fact of the other cane at the time of the\nsitting and was reminded of it on my inquiry in the West. I treated\nthe incidents here narrated as a confusion of the gold-headed cane\nwith the one that I had sent him myself. The dramatic representation\nof the communicator's actions in describing something in connection\nwith the cane I treated as mere secondary personality. Careful inves\ntigation, however, showed that father was in the habit of thumping\nthis curved handled cane down on the floor or against the door, when\nhe could reach it, to call my stepmother, as he could not speak above\na whisper. Also the circular motion described by Dr. Hodgson might\nbe an attempt to reproduce an action which was very frequent with\nmy father, according to the statement of my stepmother, when he\nwas in a playful mood. He would reach out and catch her by the\narm or neck with the hook of the cane and enjoy himself at her\n\fXLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 59\nexpense watching her try to extricate herself. My brother and sister\nas well as my step-mother testify that he often drew or rolled his cane\nacross his knees, as he was hardly ever without it in his hands, and\nthat there were two occasions in which he was in the habit of keeping\ntime with this cane. First, when he was listening to music, and\nsecondly, when he was in meditation upon some subject. All these\nfacts were wholly unknown to me (Cf. Note 36, p. 416). But at the\ntime the confusion was too great for me to consider the incidents as\ninteresting in their present shape. I resolved, however, to test my\nconjecture as to the possible reference to the two canes that I had in\nmind at the first opportunity that offered. I did this at my last sitting\nin June.\nI had given a cane with a curved handle to my father shortly\nbefore the presidential election. On it was a representation of a \" gold\nbug.\" Some years previously father had changed his political party.\nWhen he came to his old home in Xenia, Ohio, to die, my cousin,\nRobert McClellan, the one who is a communicator in this record, came\nwith his wife to call on father and in the conversation expressed his\ncuriosity about father's politics in the question : \" Well, uncle Robert,\nhow are you in politics now?\" My father replied simply by picking up this\n\"gold bug\" cane and shook it at my cousin, and all had a hearty laugh\nabout it. This incident I had from the parties present at the time\nafter I arrived to see my father. I found my father very much\ninterested in the issues of that campaign. Hence, with this incident\nin mind, I resolved to kill two birds with one stone by referring to this\noccasion and the cane to see if any light might be thrown on my con\njecture already stated.\nIn the sitting of June 8th I had alluded to the presidential election\nand the passing of hard times as an explanation of a certain incident\n(p. 494), and as soon as the allusion was understood I asked :\u2014\" Do )-ou\nremember how you shook a walking-stick at Robert McClellan about\nthat time ? \" Great excitement followed in the hand, and as soon as it\ncalmed down it wrote :\u2014\n\"Well I do. I never was more excited in my life. I think I was right\ntoo. (S. : Well, who gave you that walking stick ?) \" The forefinger of the\nhand which had been listening to my question began tapping me on the left\ntemple for fully half a minute and then wrote : \" You did, and I told him\nabout it. [Pointing to Dr. Hodgson.] (S. : Yes, 1 thought so. What was\non it ?) What was on it ? I think I know that it had the little top [?] I\n\u2022 . . I think it had the little ring? Ring. [See cut, p. 495J on it.\" (S. :\nI think I know what you mean by that. That is near enough. Do not\nworry. You recall it well) [p. 494.]\nThe lines here might fairly represent an imperfect attempt to draw\nthe beetle or \"gold bug\" on the cane I gave him, or the mode of\n\f60 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nmending the other cane by the tin ring. The allusion to the \" top \"\nand \" ring \" had no meaning for me at the time except as mistakes.\nHe had referred to a cane in Dr. Hodgson's sitting on February 22nd,\nwhich I afterwards found was probably not the one that I here\nhad in mind. But on my personal inquiries in the West, I ascertained\na fact of some importance that I did not know. I found that father had\nmended the cane with a tin ring about four inches long. The cane is\nstill with my stepmother. But there is no trace in this February\nsitting that father had in mind the \" gold bug \" cane. It was far more\nnatural to mention the older one that he had used for over twenty\nyears, and as it was his brother-in-law's substitute for the gold-headed\ncane, it was natural to associate it with that on which his initials were\ncarved, and we can interpret the confusion as an incomplete message.\nThere was probably some confusion also in his own mind regarding the\nmatter, until he finally drew the representation of the \" gold bug,\"\nunless we treat it as an attempt to draw the \" ring \" and not the\n\" gold bug \" at all, as I had also been a party to the present of the gold-\nheaded cane. But, however this may be, the allusion to \" the little\ntop \" and to the \" ring,\" before correcting the statement to the repre\nsentation of the beetle, fits the first two canes and not the one that I\ngave him. But the incidents fit in one way or another all three\ncanes, and the liability to confusion from defective association is well\nillustrated by similar illusions of my own, mentioned later (p. 228).\nThe second fact resulting from my inquiries, and which I did not\nknow at the time, refers to the excitement which father confessed on\nthe occasion to which my question referred. The wife of my cousin,\nRobert McClellan, told me that she and her husband had to leave\nthe room sooner than they intended, because my father, who could\nnot talk above a whisper, showed so much excitement on the issues of\nthe campaign that they were afraid a spasm of the larynx would\ncome on in which he was likely to suffocate. I knew that he was\nintensely interested in the campaign, but I was not told of the special\nincidents of his talk with my cousin.\nTo summarise the case, father had three canes ; the gold-headed\ncane on which his initials were carved, the stout one with the curved\nhandle, which had been broken and mended with a tin ring, and\nthe \" gold bug \" cane that I gave him which also had a curved handle.\nThe communications nominally purport to refer to but one of them.\nTheir fitness, however, depends on distributing the incidents among all\nthree canes. The initials on the end, as mentioned in the recoRl, fit-\nthe gold-hcadod cane ; the ring, curved handle, and habits of using\nit in various ways fit the second ; the recognition in answer to\nmy question and the statement that I gave it to the communicator\nfit the \" gold bug \" cane. The drawing is equivocal, and may fit the\n\fXLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 61\nsecond and last. Consequently, on the assumption that confusion is\ncertain to be an incident of communication, the statements may have\nevidential value. Otherwise they obtain little or no importance.\nImmediately after the cane incident in the sitting of February\n22nd, Dr. Hodgson read a letter that I had sent for the purpose of\ntrying to improve the communications and of starting associations\nbelonging to my father's life in Ohio. We were both dissatisfied with\nthe results of the previous sittings. I shall not repeat the letter\nhere, nor shall I quote all that he said in reply, as part of it, though\naccurate enough, is not evidential. In the letter I referred to the time\nthat I started to college, and because my father had showed consider\nable emotion on the occasion, I asked, \" Do you remember how you\nfelt then 1 \" The reply contained at first the sentiment and thought of\nwhat he said to me on that occasion, but is wholly non-evidential,\nthough it is literally true that he told me he did not wish me to want\nfor anything. But after the end of the letter he said to Dr. Hodgson,\n\" God bless you, my son. Do you remember this expression 1 I wish\nyou to know that to me James was all I could ask for a son, and\nwhen I left him or he left me I was heart-broken in one sense, but I\nfelt that I had much to look forward to.\" The pertinence of this\nstatement is apparent when I say that on the morning that he put me\non the train for college, the first time I had ever been left to my own\nresponsibility, he being conscious of the temptations to which I would\nbe exposed out of his sight and myself unacquainted with the world,\nafter giving me the advice mentioned, he bade me good-bye and\nbroke down crying, the only time that I ever saw him shed tears in\nmy life. In important partings like this father always bade me good\nbye with \"God bless you.\"\nIn the letter I also alluded to my Aunt Nannie's care for us,\nand said : \" I remember, too, how we used to go to church.\" Mrs.\nPiper's hand bowed in prayer for a few moments, and then the reply\ncame :\u2014\n\" I remember the coach very well, and the roughness of the roads\nand country. I also remember Aunt Nannie and her motherly advice to you\nall, and I look back to her with a great gratitude for her kindness to us all.\nDo you remember Ohio, James, OHIO . . . and anything about\nBartlett. I have not seen him yet, but hope to in time. I am trying\nto think of the principal of your school and what he said to me about George.\nI am still troubled about him, and if you can help me in any way by\nsending me anything encouraging about him I shall feel better I know.\"\nAfter some further conversation with Dr. Hodgson about his concern for my\nbrother, he added: \" You see I left with this on my mind, and I cannot\ndispose of it until I have learned from James that he will not feel troubled\nin this regard. We had our own thoughts and anxieties together regarding\nthis and Aunt Nannie also \" (p. 401).\n\f62 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nThis is also a remarkable passage. Every incident of it is true and\npertinent, except the reference to Bartlett, which I cannot explain,\nexcept as a possible reference to Bartlett pears, of which father was\nvery fond and to whose culture he had devoted some unsuccessful\nefforts, or to BartZott', the name of the township in Ohio, in which my\nbrother George lives. The mention of the \" rough roads and country \"\nwas very pertinent, for they were very rough at the time in mind,\nwhen my aunt was keeping house for father after the death of my\nmother (cf. p. 402). \" Carriage \" is the word father would use,\nbut probably Rector is more familiar with \"coach.\" Ohio was\nhis old home. The school incident was this. My brother George\nwished to go to college, but had become interested in society while at\nthe High School, and on this account father hesitated to send him.\nIn the summer of 1876 I was riding out of town with my father in a\nspring wagon, and we talked the question over about my brother, and\nI urged father to try him. He then told me that he had talked the\nmatter over with the principal of the High School, and thought he\ncould not undertake it. There were several principals during the time\nof my brother's attendance at the High School. One of them is dead.\nThe one who most probably talked with my father is named Bonner,\nand is still living. On inquiry I find that I am the only person living\nthat knows or remembers the incident. A year or so later my brother\nleft home to take charge of father's land in the northern part of Ohio,\nand in the years that followed the management of land there for father,\nmy aunt Nannie and myself\u2014my aunt Eliza leaving her small interest in\nit to my father's care\u2014my brother's loss of money and dilatory methods\nof doing business were a source of much worry and trouble to all three\nof us.\nThe special pertinence of all this is too apparent for further proof\nor comment. Rector followed it, while father was resting, with some\nadvice that I should send something in the way of a message to get the\nanxiety expressed off my father's mind, and when father returned he\nalluded to the cap again in connection with the name \" Nannie \"\n(p. 406). Nothing more of importance was said at this sitting, which\nsoon after came to a close. There were some interesting explanations\nof father's state of mind, and the prospect that he would in time be as\ngood a communicator as another person named (p. 407).\nThe next series of sittings were personal, and were eight in number.\nIn the first of these, on May 29th, the first allusion was to the\nMaltine incident already discussed (p. 418), which was an attempt to\nanswer the question asked by me through Dr. Hodgson at an earlier\nsitting. One curious allusion here, apparently to what I was doing in\nthe experiments on the identification of personality, is interesting\n(p. 537), though it is not clear enough to make it evidential (p. 268).\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 63\nHe said (p. 419) : \" Do not go more to that place. I am not there, and\nyou cannot find me if you go. (S. : What place is that, father ?) With\nthe younger men trying to find me. They are not light, and I cannot\nreach you there.\" Soon after my first four sittings in December I had\nbeen conducting with my students the experiments in Appendix V.,\nand this was the first sitting at which I was present since those\nexperiments. He then asked to know what \" Nani \" said about the\npaper, having reference to his own injunction at one of Dr. Hodgson's\n-sittings to ask her about it (p. 419). He showed himself anxious all\nalong to have his reading the paper in his armchair identified. An\nallusion to my mother and sister Annie followed, and after this a\nshort passage connected with our conversations on spirit communica\ntions. He then asked me if I remembered what he told me on my\ndeparture for school, and I repeated my desire to know the name of\nthe school. But my attempt failed and later another institution to\nwhich I went afterward was hinted at very clearly (p. 449). Shortly\nafter, and during Dr. Hodgson's absence from the room, I was asked :\n\" And do you remember John 1 He has just come to greet you. And\ndo you remember anything about Lucy. I say Lucy. She was Nannie's\n[?] cousin \" (p. 421). This was nothing but confusion to me at the time.\nBut later events show the connection that enables me to put an intelligible\nmeaning on the passage. Lucy is the name of Robert McClellan's\nwife, and she is still living, her husband having died a year later\nthan my father. She was evidently intended in the next commu\nnication from my father. John was the name of Robert McClellan's\ngrandfather. But the statement that this Lucy is \" Nannie's cousin \"\nis wholly false. The doubt about the reading of the word for\n\" Nannie \" enables us to suggest that possibly it was a mistake for\n\" Annie,\" my sister, in which case the statement is correct. It is\nnot impossible to put this interpretation on the original writing.\nBut I do not claim this conjectural reading as evidential.\nA confused message about my \" brother F . .\"terminated father's\ncommunications, and my sister took his place and said a few words\n(p. 421). She correctly stated two facts, that she had died before\nfather and that it was long ago. On father's return he made some\nallusion to a church, and a moment afterwards said, \" And perhaps\nyou will recall an old friend of mine who was a doctor, and\nwho was a little peculiar in regard to the subject of religion,\nand with whom I had many long talks. A man small of stature\nand more or less of mind. It has gone from me\u2014i.e., his name, but it\nwill come back to me\" (p. 421.) This suggested a doctor, Harvey\nMcClellan, with whom I knew father had had long talks on religion,\nand a little later in the same sitting (p. 425) an apparent attempt to\ngive the name as father left was made in the name Henry [!] McAllam\n\f64 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\n[1]. On June 6th (p. 473) father asked me : \" What was the name of\nthat Dr. I cannot think of his name.\" This occurred soon after my\nuncle James McClellan had communicated. Then on June 8th (p. 491)\nmy father said, without any pertinent connections that are traceable :\n\" There was a Henry [?] McClellan also. I think you may know this.\nHe was, I think, an uncle of the McClellan boys.\" The statements\nregarding stature and religious views would be equally or more\napplicable to father's dentist, who was always called Doctor, and whose\nname, however, was never mentioned at all at the sittings. It is,\nunfortunately, not made clear whether the doubtful \" Henry McClellan \"\nwas intended by the person described or not.\nImmediately following this allusion to a doctor on May 29th\n(p. 422) father began a communication having much interest in spite\nof its confusion.\nDo you remember McCollum [?] (S. : McAUum.) (R.H. : McCollum.)\n(S. : No, know what it is.) (S. : Spell it again.) McAllum. (S. : How\nwas he related to you ?) He was McAllan [?] (S. : Yes, that's it.) Don't\nyou U D. who I mean ? He came over some time ago. (Yes, I remember.\nTell.) What about your uncle? (S. : Which uncle do you mean?) I\nmean ... let me hear once more ... I mean Charles. (S.\nto It. H. : That's not quite right. Shall I make him spell it out ?) (R. H. :\nYes.) You must remember him. (S. : Yes, I remember him. But please\nspell out the name in full.) In full. (S. : The name of Charles is not right.)\nIn full did you say ? (S. : Yes.) C 1 a R 1 . . . [Hand signifies dissent.]\nSpeak it more loudly. C 1 or R . . . C. [pause] (S. : That's Clark.)\nC Ira R a k E. Clark (S. : That's right.) E (S. : Not quite) son [?]\n. there are some more which I will ... I say. He is here\nhimself speaking it for me. Clarke. Clarance. Speak it louder friend.\nWell he is uncle C lauc [?] C 1 a r a k e. I will wait for it. It sounds\nvery like it. Clarke. Charles [?] Well, never mind. Don't try. Wait a\nmoment and do not hurry . . . yes and McAllan. Well you must\nknow him. I had a cousin by that name. Don't you remember it.\nI saw in the \" McCollum \" and \" McAllan \" an attempt to give the\nname McClellan, and it was confirmed both by the previous name\nLucy, which was that of his wife, still living, and by the statement\nthat \" he came over some time ago.\" The inference, however, is\nconfirmed by later events. He was not my father's cousin, but his\nnephew, and my cousin. The confusion and error thus have an\ninterest, and no less is this the fact with the attempt to give the name\nof my uncle, which never succeeded. They never got nearer his name,\nwhich was Carruthers, than Clarke or Charles. [Cf. Footnote p. 423.)\nThe next question that I was asked was : \" Where is George ? I\noften think of him, but I do not worry any more about him,\" both the\nname and the implication in the term \"worry \" being correct, and in a\nmoment came the quick communication : \" Do you remember Thorn\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 65\n. . Tom . . and what has he done w.ith him. I feel quite\n. . . yes . . . yes, all right . . . I mean the horse \" (p. 423).\nWe had an old faithful horse by the name of Tom, that used to\nget excited and work too hard if fretted in any way, and father always\ncautioned us against using the whip on him, and when the horse became\ntoo old to work, pensioned him, so to speak, and allowed him to die on\nthe farm. I find by correspondence with the brother named here that\nhe buried the horse after its death. This was after I had finally left\nhome, and was somewhere about 1880 or later. The last part of the\nmessage has a most important interest. After the confusion with the\nnames of my uncle and cousin, Rector evidently wanted this name to\nbe completed, supposing apparently that father was trying to give the\nname of some person, and seems to have asked him if he was clear.\nFather's answer shows that he felt clear about it, and the sudden\nexplanation of what he meant by saying that he meant the horse\nboth determined the evidential value of the incident, and satisfied\nRector as to the situation.\nHe then expressed wonder as to what my sister meant by referring\nto a sled, which she had done a little earlier, and then came : \" James,\nare you waiting for me 1 I used to read the paper in my chair, but\nstrange they none of them remember it. Did you write to Nannie\nabout it, James1 . . . And the little tool I used for my feet.\nHe says no. Stool. Yes, I had for my feet. Cannot you remem\nber ? (8. : When was this V) Just before I came here \" (p. 424.)\nFather had a stool for his feet, but always refused to use it.\nWhen my stepmother would offer it to him for propping his feet up\nnear the stove, he would put it aside and thrust his feet direct into\nthe oven to warm them. This was very frequent during the last\nyear of his life. The chair incident and reading his paper explain\nthemselves and represent the facts already mentioned (p. 387).\nAfter my father's confessing a change of views about the Bible,\nwhich might be construed as an objection to identity, a few brief\ncommunications from my sister Annie concluded the sitting.\nAt the sitting of May 30th, the first allusion was to the Cooper\nincident, and then there came a long and confused series of communi\ncations apparently from my cousin Robert McClellan (p. 427). The\nevidence that he was the real communicator comes later. The fact to\nbe noted here is his appearance personally after my father's allusion to\nhim in the previous sitting (p. 423).\nMy father followed my cousin, and first made an allusion to the\nfatal nature of his illness, and said that nothing would have done him\nany good\u2014which was undoubtedly true\u2014referred to my being tired,\nand repeated the advice which he had been accustomed to give me,\nsaying : \" You know how I used to talk to you about overdoing\np\n\f66 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nanything, and you will remember your tireless energy.\" Pertinently in\nthis connection, as he always pointed to his own condition as an\nillustration of overwork, he asked : \" Do you remember when I got\nhurt ? \" and made a clear and correct statement about the fire incident\n(p. 430). After explaining his own confusion in these communica\ntions, he began the following complicated message :\u2014\nCharles. (S. : Is this brother Charles ?) Yes, and John. I just called\nthem. (S. : What John is this?) Brother John. (S. : Is this brother\nCharles speaking ?) Yes, and father. We are both speaking. Chester [?]\nClarke [?] and Charles [?] Yes. Oh speak, James. Help me to keep my\nthoughts clear. (S. : Yes, I think you are uncle, are you not ?) No, it is I,\nyour father, who is speaking, and I am telling you about Charles and John.\n(S. : What John is that 1 I remember Charles, but not John, unless it is\nJohn some one else.) McJohn. There are two of the Mclellen over here.\n(S. : Yes.) And this one is John. (S. : Yes. Do you remember where\nhe lived on earth V) I do. What . . . (S. : Do you remember where\nhe lived on earth 1 I remember John McClellan.) I don't believe I under\nstand just what you said, James. (S. : Do you remember where he lived on\nearth?) Ohio. Was it that you meant? (S. : That is right.) I told it I\nthought before (p. 431).\nExcept for later developments and inquiries I could give no\nmeaning whatever to this passage. I suspected who was meant by the\n\" Chester,\" etc., but father had no brother John or brother of any\nkind. This, however, was cleared up by the evident intention to speak\nof John McClellan, who was named spontaneously a minute later. I\nknew but one John McClellan, and that was the treasurer of the\ninstitution in Ohio to which my father sent me. So much then ap\npeared true in the message ; but it implied, as an earlier use of the\nname John with the statement that he had come to greet me, that he\nwas not living. Here was a good test, and I inquired only to find\nthat the John McClellan that I had in mind was still living. But this\nmistake was spontaneously corrected by my uncle, James McClellan later\n(p. 470), giving John as the name of his father who had died many\nyears ago, and saying that his brother John, whom I had had in mind,\nwas coming soon (p. 471). He also lived in Ohio. The \"Chester,\"\n\" Clark,\" \" Charles,\" etc., were, as I think, attempts at my uncle\nCarruthers, and the first Charles was the name of my brother.\nAfter a pertinent allusion to setting an \" example for his sons,\"\nwhich expressed the main moral purpose and characteristic of his life,\nuttered here from a misunderstanding of a statement of mine, he\napologises for his mistakes and said, \" There was another one here\nwhom you must have forgotten. Do you remember Mary Ann Anne ?\n(S. : Well, the rest of it.) Do you remember Mary Anne Hyslop 1\n(S. : Yes I do. What relation was she to me 1 ) Have you forgotten\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 67\nyour mother? (S. : No, no, father. I have not forgotten, but I\nwanted to see it written out here.) Well, speak to her, my boy \"\n(p. 432). Some non-evidential communications at once came from her,\nand her initials were signed at the close of them. The message had her\nreligious nature in it, but no interesting facts. Her correct name was\nMartha Ann Hyslop. \" Mary \" was, I suppose, Rector's mistake for\n\"Martha \" (Cf. p. 481 and mistake of \"Nannie\" for \"Maggie,\" pp. 69,\n342, 365).\nFollowing my mother and her religious tone of thought my father\ncontinued, \" James, do you remember my preaching 1 (S. : I re\nmember you used to talk and read to us about the sermons) and\nSunday . . . mornings ... at home 1 (S. : Yes,\nI remember that well.) Do you remember the dining-room and\nprayers 1 \" (p. 432). I have already explained (pp. 432-433) how father\nused to spend the Sundays, or Sabbaths as he would invariably say\nhimself, on which we had no preaching, and morning prayers were\nsaid invariably in the \" dining \" room if that term be given the flexi\nbility necessary to fit the case. But we had two rooms that could be\ngiven that name. We dined usually in the kitchen except when com\npany was present, when we took what we sometimes called a dining\nand sometimes a sitting-room. Prayers were held as often in one as in\nthe other of these rooms. But the use of \" Sunday \" is interesting, as\nit is against identity. The hesitation, however, and the fact that G. P.\nis assisting, as indicated a few minutes later (p. 434), are curiously\nsuggestive. The Imperator group of personalities always use the word\n\" Sabbath.\" Rector was the amanuensis here. Hence it is interesting\nto see the word \" Sunday,\" which G. P. would always use, written\nout when he is assisting. Immediately following this passage is\nan interesting one regarding my brother, and it has a most intimate\ninternal connection with the allusion to the morning prayers. The\nevidences of this are too personal to publish, except that I shall say\nthat this brother was a special object of father's prayers and life-long\nreligious solicitude. He said here, \" Think there is one of the boys I\nhave not yet mentioned. Isn't there 1 (S. : Yes. I think so. Yes, I\nthink you have not mentioned him very clearly.) [I had my brother\nFrank in mind, whose name had not been given in this form, but in\nthe form that was not generally used, that of Francis (p. 433).] Well,\nI was not sure, but I would like to reach to brother Robert myself\n. . . Robert cousin \" (p. 433). The pertinence of this is its recog\nnition of what my cousin had said about this brother (p. 427). He had\nalways shown the same interest in him as my father. This cousin's\nname, already given, was Robert McClellan, and hence we have both\nthe correct names given here and the recognition that one of the\npersons mentioned had mentioned the other.\nf 2\n\f68 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nImmediately following this was an allusion to his library and\nbooks, and then a confused attempt to give the name of my half-sister,\nin which G. P. figures confessedly (p. 434). After my deliberate assist\nance in recognising one letter of it, it is not necessary to lay any stress\nupon the virtual success in getting it. Following some of Rector's\nremarks about my father's memory, father continued : \" James, do you\nremember a little bridge we used to cross in going up to the church 1\n(S. : Yes, I remember the bridge and the creek.) Yes, I do very\nwell. I do also. Mother just called my mind to it \" (p. 434). This is\na little equivocal, as I cannot tell whether he refers to his own mother\nor to mine. The reference to \" mother \" would apply to both of them,\nthough it is hardly specific enough to give it evidential value.\nFather then returns to my sister : \" Hettie. Tell me about her. Does\nshe ever speak of me. I don't suppose you can tell because you are not\nwith her often. James, I am * * [undec.] I am glad he [?] is . .\nhe is . . here comes John again, we will' be obliged to let him go for\nthe present.\" \"And if you will speak to me, James, I will tell you that\ncousin Annie is very anxious to send her love to H. H. Hettie. (S. : I\nwill give her love to her.) And do you remember anything of Ruth? I\noften hear her speak of her, and . . . she is only a friend I think.\"\nThe sitting then came to an end (p. 435).\nMy father shows a perfectly correct appreciation of the facts when\nhe said that I do not often see my sister, as the statement implies the\nsituation consciously recognised and stated elsewhere (p. 375), that\nI was in New York and my sister not. I seldom see her.\nThere are two possible interpretations of the references to \" cousin\nAnnie,\" \" Hettie \" and \" Ruth.\" Both of them have the same\npertinence. My notes will explain them (p. 505).\nAt the next sitting, May 31st, father first referred to \" the thought\ntheory \" and Swedenborg (p. 438), and then this was followed by a\nlong communication, apparently from my cousin, as the latter part of the\nmessage indicates, but ostensibly from the \"John \" of earlier communi\ncations. This must be noticed under the head of my cousin. He was\nfollowed by my brother Charles. Father tried again and failed. It\nwas explained that my father was \" a little dazed,\" and G. P. broke\nin with the statement, \" I am coming H. to help out,\" and inquired\nof Dr. Hodgson about a Dr. Meredith. In a minute or two father\nbegan : \" I wish you would hear me out, James, my son. I am going\nto try and keep my thoughts straight. Yes, I will do my best for you.\nHow is Franks'! (S. : Frank is much better.) I thought he might\ncome to us for awhile, but we have not seen him yet\" (p. 441). My\nbrother Frank was an invalid at the time of father's death, and was\nunable even to be present at the funeral. My father thought he would\nnot recover. I had learned a short time before the sitting that his health\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 69\nhad been recovered. The pertinence of the remark about him would\nhave been spoiled by my statement here, had it not been that father's\nquestion about him first implied the situation before I had said anything.\nThen followed a pertinent question from him, showing that he had\nreferred to this brother in order to make sure that he had mentioned all\nthe members of the family, and my answer to it opened up the most\ninteresting incident of the whole record. I saw my opportunity to\nsuggest the giving of the name of my stepmother, which I had only\nconjectured from the incidents before mentioned.\nBut I must summarise here the allusions that stimulated a careful\ninquiry into the mistake connected with the name of my stepmother.\nA curious confusion had persisted in regard to this until I directly\nasked for the name. The name \" Nannie\" with the prefix \"aunt\" was\nseveral times used for my aunt by that name, and where the incidents\nand connections fitted this aunt. But it was also often used without\nthat prefix where the incidents and connections fitted only my step\nmother, whose name was Maggie.\nI did not suspect the confusion of \" Nannie \" with \" Maggie \" on\nDecember 27th in the use of \" Nani \" and \"Mnni \" (p. 343), as father\nhad a little before referred, as I supposed, to his sister, and gave what\nwe read at the time as \"Nannie,\" but later as \"Mannie.\" Besides\nmost that was said, except the reference to the glasses, would apply to\nthis sister, though more pertinently to my stepmother (Cf. Note 25,\np. 365). But in Dr. Hodgson's sitting of February 7th, father, speak\ning of his spectacle case, said, \" I think Nannie will remember this\nalso.\" February 16th my father mentioned the cap incident, his dress\ning gown and his bronchial trouble (p. 387-8) in connection with the\nname \" Nannie \" without the prefix \" aunt \" and he also remarked,\n\"I often think of her faithfulness to me.\" All this applied to\nmy stepmother and not to my aunt. Again on February 22nd, in\nthe last sitting by Dr. Hodgson, the cap was mentioned a second time,\nand connected with the name \" Nannie \" without the prefix \" aunt,\"\nand all the other incidents in the same connection fitted my stepmother\nand not my aunt. Then at the sitting of May 29th, when I was\npresent, father asked, \" What was it Nani said about the paper ? \"\n(p. 419), referring to the incident of reading his paper in the chair,\nmentioned in Dr. Hodgson's earlier sitting (p. 387). There was no\nreason whatever thus to refer to my aunt, as only my step\nmother, brother, and sister knew the facts. Later in the sitting of\nthe 29th, father recurs to the same incident and asks, \" Did you write\nto Nannie about it, James 1 papers. . . \" (p. 424). After mentioning\nmy brother Frank for the purpose indicated, the record proceeds :\u2014\n\"Have I overlooked any one, James? I will not . . . (S. : Yes,\nyou have overlooked one, and then the name of another, my present mother,\n\f70 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nwas not given rightly. Yes, you overlooked one of your children.) [I had\nin mind the sister mentioned in a remarkable way later (p. 460).] Have\nI ? Have I ? Well I will think about it and see whether I have forgotten\nthem. I know I never forget anything, but when I can tell it all to you is\na different matter. Did you say anything about mother, James ? (S. :\nYes, you did not give rightly the name of my mother on earth now.) But\nthe one with mo? (S. : Yes.) I was speaking about . . . I thought.\nI intended to bring her and keep her clear. (S. : Yes, that was right. I\nremember my mother on your side, but there is one on this side, you\nknow) \" (p. 441). This was May 31st.\nThe source of the confusion here is perfectly evident. I ought to\nhave said stepmother, as was finally done later (p. 483), but she was\nalways spoken of as \"mother,\" and I thought that the addition\n\" on this side \" would make this clear. But evidently my conception\nof the situation was not clear to my father, as his answer showed that\nhe had my own mother in mind, who was with him at a previous\nsitting (p. 432).\nThe sitting of June 7th was almost wholly occupied with the\nattempt to get my stepmother's name. I had resolved, after talking\nthe matter over with Dr. Hodgson on the way to the sitting, to start\nthe subject, and the opportunity offered itself near the outset. \" (Who\nmade that cap you referred to so often 1) Mother. (S. : Well, which\nmother 1 The one on your side or on this side 1 Which mother, the\none on your side or the one on my side ?) on my side \" (p. 478).\nUnderstanding this last statement to be an answer to my question,\nand not being sure what it meant, I said : \" Do you mean in the\nearthly life or in the spirit life 1 \" The answer came : \" Oh, I see\nwhat you mean. Your mother, James, is with me, but Hettie's mother\nis in the body \" (p. 478).\nThis last answer was correct in every detail, and satisfied me that\nthe name \" Nannie,\" so often given where I had thought my step\nmother was really meant, was probably a mistake for Maggie, especially\nas \"Nannie\" had been given in connection with the cap and other\nincidents applicable only to my stepmother (p. 406). I then started\nthe next question with a double object, namely, to get incidents that\nI did not know, but which were connected with her, and that might\nelicit her name by accident. Father had taken a trip West with her\nbefore moving West himself, and the incidents of that trip were\nunknown to me.\n(S. : Yes, that is right. Do you remember any trip with her out West ?)\nCertainly, I told you about it before some time ago, did you not understand\nit 1 (S. : No, I was not quite sure what you meant. When you can I\nwould be glad to have you tell some things about that trip, but don't\nhurry.) Yes, but it was she who made my cap and you had better ask\nher about it. Sarah. SARA H.\" Dr. Hodgson was about to speak\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 71\nwhen father went on, ending in confusion. \"Let me see. What is it I\nwish to say. Ellen. Help me, Oh help me to [R.H. puts leather spectacle\ncase and brown knife on table next to hand. Hand moves back the knife\nand retains the spectacle case.] recall what I so longed to say. My own\nmother Nannie. I . . . wait I will go for a moment. Wait for me,\nJames.\" I said I would wait and G.P. appeared, asking Dr. Hodgson if he\nhad been sent for. Father proceeded : \"I think, James, you mean when\nwe met with the accident, do you not 1 (S. : No, not the accident. You\ntook a trip with Hettie's mother just before you went out West. It was\nthat to which I referred.) Well I am sure I have told you of this before.\nThink it over and you will recall it. I am not sure I mentioned her, but\nI had it on my mind when I referred to the trip I took just before going out\nWest, do you not recall it ? \" (p. 479).\nThe fact is that I was in as much confusion as my father, as I\nhad not recognised the trip to which he had referred before (p. 421),\nbecause it was connected with the Cooper incident, which had appeared\nas nonsense to me until I verified it from my stepmother after the sittings\nwere over. Hence I was thinking of the tiip that he had mentioned in\nmy first series of sittings, which was taken with my own mother and\naunt Sarah in 1861. The expression, \"my own mother Nannie,\" is\na very significant one, especially as a little later (p. 481) the same\nreferences come out still clearer. His own mother's name was Mar\ngaret, the same as that of my stepmother, which I wanted. Nannie\nwas the name of his sister, and was used in connections where Maggie,\nmy stepmother's name, should have been given. Ellen has no special\nsignificance in this connection.\nAt this point Dr. Hodgson, who did not know that I was quite\nsatisfied with results, since he did not understand the facts as I did,\ncalled G. P. and explained the situation, and asked for my stepmother's\nreal name. I explained to G. P. (p. 480) the mental situation of\nmyself in regard to the two trips and what was wanted. G. P. said :\n\" I see. Well, I will assist him ; do not hurry.\" Then followed an\ninteresting colloquy begun by father, after G. P. had explained to him\nthe source of my confusion in not knowing which trip he referred to\nbefore, whether it was the one with me or the one with my stepmother.\nHe said : \"Yes, this is . . . the one he referred to was the one\nwith yourself . . . yes which interrupted his thought somewhat.\"\nThough this is a correct acknowledgment of the case and interesting\nas explaining the interruption, it contains much confusion still. It seems\nin the first part to imply that the trip he took with my stepmother\ninvolved my presence with them, when this was not the fact, except\nthat they visited me in Chicago on their way home (p. 440). The\nlatter part seems to indicate only that my allusion to the trip was the\nsource of the confusion. But in what follows there is a clear\nattempt to straighten the matter out. After some altercation with\n\f72 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nRector, who had advised him to wait, but who finally gave way, father\nbegan :\u2014\n' ' It was Aunt Nannie (R.H. : ' About Nannie ') about Aunt Nannie. I\nthought it all over about the cap when I spoke of her. I say I . . . \" (S. :\nThe cap was not made by aunt Nannie. You told me rightly a moment\nago.) You are not understanding me, James, let me explain. I thought\nof H. ... H A It ... H ... no go on. I thought of\nmy mother and aunt my sister both at the same time and I wanted to say\nthat both of their names came into my mind as you spoke of Mary here,\nand I got a little confused about it. I am all right now. I wanted to say\nsomething about our visit to her also.\" Dr. Hodgson was about to interfere\nwhen I remarked that I understood the matter, and the communications\nwent on. \"And between the visit to the boys and aunt Nannie I got\nconfused a little. (S. : Yes, I understand perfectly.) Well we saw George.\nWe saw George and Will. Now what did I ... oh yes, I then arranged\nto go out there to live. I . . .\" [Pause]. At this father disappeared\n(p. 481).\nThe answer to my correction of his apparent allegation that\naunt Nannie had made the cap is a perfect piece of interpretation\nof my actual misinterpretation of his meaning. My statement was\ncalculated to produce worse confusion and I should have remained\nquiet ; but fortunately he saw, as he states, my misunderstanding\nof his meaning, and quickly explains that he had not intended\nto connect the cap with aunt Nannie, though the previous sentence,\nperhaps incomplete, is capable of that interpretation. Possibly\nthe \" HAR \" is the result of an attempt to say Margaret, and\nonlv the syllable \"Mar\" comes as \"Har.\" The next sentence\ngives the same explanation of his confusion that I have previously\nmentioned (p. 481), and indicates very clearly my correct interpreta\ntion of the former. There he had said, \" my own mother Nannie,\"\nwhich would imply that his mother's name was Nannie to any outside\nreader ; but I knew the facts well enough to discover that the unity\nwas in the interpretation that I gave, and it is confirmed by the\nrecognition of the distinction here between his mother's and sister's\nnames. Recognising that his own mother's name was the same as the\none that I had asked for and perhaps wondering why he had succeeded\nonly in sending that of his sister, he explains that he had thought of\nboth of them at once, as I spoke of \" Mary here.\" Now I had not\nspoken of any \" Mary \" by name, and I could never make out until\nthis writing what this \"Mary\" could mean. In the request to have\nmy stepmother mentioned (p. 441), I had referred to my own mother\nin the phrase \"my mother on your side,\" without giving the name.\nNow in the sitting of May 30th (p. 432) my own mother's name came\nout as Mary Ann Hyslop instead of Martha Ann Hyslop. Most\nprobably, therefore, the name Mary in the present allusions of\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 73\nJune 7th is the same mistake as on May 30th, and so is intended for\nmy mother. Consequently, with the allusion to his mother whose name,\nMargaret, was the same as my stepmother's, and to his sister, whose\nname, Nannie, was the same as that which was mistaken for that of my\nstepmother (pp. 69, 343), and with the reference to my mention of my\nown mother before, we have a clear indication of what was in my father's\nmind and intentions. Who was meant by the message becomes clearer\nstill in the statement about seeing my two brothers George and Will and\nthen arranging to go out West. For he did see both these brothers after\nthe return from that Western trip and then made his plans to move.\nThough he has not yet given the name, the incidents make it impossible\nfor me to mistake who is meant.\nMy sister Annie took father's place for a few moments, and on his\nreturn he resumed the attempt to name my stepmother and said :\u2014\n\" I am here once more and I am thinking about the trip I took with\nHAT... [Hand dissents.] H A R ... No. [S. shakes his head\nnegatively.] I want to speak of other things. Will you try and tell me\nexactly what you want \" (p. 482). Then began the most interesting part\nof the whole drama. Dr. Hodgson explained our understanding of the\nsituation as some confusion still about my stepmother, but Rector indicated\nvery emphatically that it had \"nothing to do with mothers of any sort, but\nwith trips,\" and asks us not to worry him but to refer to something else.\nDr. Hodgson then explained that the name of my stepmother had never\nbeen given correctly, saying, \"mother in the body,\" however, until I\nsuggested \"stepmother.\" Rector to my astonishment at once asked : \"Has\nit been asked for ? \" Dr. Hodgson's reply was : ' ' The stepmother has been\nreferred to in various ways ; for example, as Hettie's mother. She has also\nbeen called Nannie, but her name is not Nannie.\" \"Well\" [continued Rector]\n\" there would, certainly be a mistake in that because they all know better\nhere than that, because Nannie in the body only acted as a mother to\nthem after the mother of these children here came here and that must be\nwhy, if they referred to her as mother Nannie \" (p. 483).\nNow this was a perfectly correct statement on the part of Rector,\nbut Dr. Hodgson, not understanding the facts as I did, replied, \" No,\nRector,\" and Rector in despair gave the game up, and saying, \" I\ncannot understand it,\" yielded his place to G. P. It was too late for\nme to correct Dr. Hodgson's statement. But he went on to explain\nthe situation to G. P., saying what the mistake had been, and G. P.\nreplied sharply, \" Well, why do you not come out and say, give me my\nstepmother's name, and not confuse him about anything except what\nyou really want 1 (R. H. : I think that it has been asked for directly,\nbut cannot be sure.) (S. : Yes.) Has it, very well, if she has a name\nyou shall have it. G. P. understand 1 \" (p. 483). Dr. Hodgson ex\nplained that there seemed to be some peculiar difficulty about her\nname. G. P. replied, \" I do not think so, H., but I do think he would\n\f74 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nrefer to it in his own way if let alone. I know how you confused me,\nby Jove, and I don't want any more of it. I am going to help him,\nand he is going to tell all he knows from A to Z. No doubt about it,\nH. No one could be more desirous of doing so than he is. Is that\nclear to you 1 Well, when he gets ready out it will come, and there is\nno use wondering about it. I see him now, and he is anxious to say\nsomething \" (p. 484).\nG. P.'s blunt, sharp answer to Dr. Hodgson's explanation is beyond\nall praise for its appreciation of the situation as he understood it, and\nhis way of advising us how to simplify the problem would be accepted\nby every reader as a most rational rebuke for our confusion and mixing\nup of demands ; but it was based upon an entire misunderstanding of\nthe fact that we had asked for the name of my stepmother, and he\nseems not to have known that the question of trips entered into it, as\nRector did. It is true, nevertheless, that, had it not been for our\nhabit of letting the communicator take his own way we should, in all\nprobability, have simplified the request, as G. P. put it in his conception\nof the situation.\nBefore my father's return my uncle asked me an absurd question\nand disappeared, and then my father appeared and went on to our\nconversations about this subject before he died (p. 484). Finally at\nthe close of the sitting G. P. suddenly appeared and wrote :\u2014\nI will speak for a moment and say I do not see any reason for anxiety\nabout Margaret. (R. H. : Who says this ?) George. He said, I suppose\nI might just as well tell you first as last and have done with it, or James\nmay think I do not really know. Go tell him this for me. You see I got\nit out of him for you, H., but you no need to get nervous about it, old chap\n(p. 486).\nMargaret of course, was the correct name, and if it could be finally\ngotten so easily by telepathy, why all this fuss ? The character and\nmanner of G. P., with his intelligent appreciation of the whole situa\ntion, make one of the most interesting features of the case, and display\nevery evidence of independent intelligence.\nThis episode regarding my stepmother's name began in the sitting\nof May 31st, near the close, and ended on June 8th. I return now to\nthat of May 31st.\nAfter father's allusion to my mother (p. 441), he was followed pos\nsibly by an attempt of my Uncle Carruthers, if the letters \" E . .\nE . . El . .\" are any indication of it (Cf. pp. 310, 314, where\na similar beginning ended with the completion of the name Eliza). But\nmy vincle failed, and then came a long communication from my cousin\nRobert McClellan. When my father returned he apparently referred\nto the Lucy just mentioned before at the close of my cousin's effort,\nand accompanied the reference with a group of names quite pertinent\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 75\nto the McClellan family (See Note, p. 433). Some confusion followed,\nand, after an automatism regarding his often hearing my sister Hettie\nplaying, meaning the organ, perhaps, which she used to play, he pro\nceeded to \" speak of the foot which got injured in the accident,\" the\nincident being applicable to my \" uncle Charles,\" as it was the cause of\nhis death, but the name was not mentioned. He ran off into a dazed\ncondition and started possibly by the letter F to say Frank, but\nsaid \"it was 'Will's,\" and added, \"He got it injured and so did I.\nDid you know he was on if!\" (p. 444). My father did injure his leg\n(cf. p. 430), but my brother Will did not, as I had to ascertain later.\nMy brother Frank injured his leg by a fall, and was threatened with\nlocomotor ataxy. The confusion is apparent, and thinking that it\nmight be true without my knowledge, I said I would ask about it, and\nthe communications went on :\u2014\nThe boys were so unlike you. I do not think you often asked anything\nof them, you never used to do so. (S. : That's right.) You remember\nwhat she used to say, if they were like James I would not have anything to\nthink about, but . . . how is Helen. I am really too weak to think\nmore for you, James (p. 444)\nThis is a very pertinent reference to my brothers, as it reflects\nfather's exact opinions. I seldom asked him about them, as I corre\nsponded with them, and I also seldom or never asked any favours of\nthem. What is attributed to \" she \" in this case is exactly true of my\nstepmother, as she states it over her own signature (p. 512). The\n\" Helen \" is meaningless unless it is an attempt at Henrietta or Hettie\nagain. The sitting came to a close after some communications from my\ntwo uncles, before father had an opportunity to return.\nAt the sitting of June 1st, as soon as it was opened, father began to\nanswer an earlier question to tell me where he had sent me to college.\n\" I intended to refer to uncle John, but I was somewhat dazed, James.\nDo you understand me 1 \" I said that I understood, and he stated\nthat he had referred to this for clearing matters up, and added, \" And\nthere is another thing to which I would refer, and that is the univer\nsity. It was there, James, that I had you go, and the others I will\nrefer to soon.\" Now, assuming that this \" uncle John \" refers to the\nJohn McClellan whom I know, the statement about sending me there\nto the university is perfectly true and pertinent. But this John\nMcClellan was neither mine nor my father's uncle. He was my\ncousin's uncle, and, according to my uncle James McClellan's later\nstatement (p. 472), this John referred to by my father was my uncle's\nfather, and would be no relative of my father or myself. Besides,\nthough it is correct that father sent me to the university here indi\ncated, it was not the college that I had in mind when asking my\nquestion, and it was not the college connected with the answer to my\n\f76 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nquestion about how he felt when he started me away from home\n(p. 401). Also the institution to which my original question related\nwas not called a university ; the institution to which my father referred\nin connection with John McClellan was called a university.\nThe next passage has some remarkable features in it, and as an\nexplanation of his difficulties, it is accompanied by a reference to his\nprevious intention to mention \" the Mclellen family one by one and\nto keep all of their names quite clear,\" and he then added :\u2014-\n\"Do you remember our old home in the little town of C. and where I\nwith aunt Nannie lived after your mother left us and we brought you up.\"\nAnother statement followed, evidently explaining to Rector that he was not\nconfused, and asserting \"the names of your mother's family are all known\nto me.\" He continued : \" I intended to clear up about James and John\nMclellen before I left.\" [See previous sitting, p. 445 ] \" Speak, James, if\nyou . . . (S. : Yes, father, I hear clearly and remember the old home\nand aunt Nannie bringing us up.) And the special core I had with one of\nthe boys. It is all right in my mind now. I only refer to it that you may\nknow it is I, your father, and no one else who is speaking, and .\n(S. : Yes.) I also wanted Clarke for a mere recollection, not because I\nhad any special interest otherwise. (S. : Yes, I know, and\u2014 did he\nhave anything to do with your sister ?) Oh yes, only by marriage. (S. :\nYes, that is right, and is he on this side or not ?) Yes he is, and has been\nfor some time. (R. H. : That's not clear.) I often see him. (S. : Yes, do\nyou mean that he is on your side?) He is here. (S.: Yes, what brought\nhim there, to your side ?) Why do you not remember of his coming here\nsuddenly, James? (S. : Yes.) It was pneumonia. (S. : Yes, I remember\nhis sudden coming, but I wanted to see if something said about him before\nwas what you meant.) What it was, due to it, and if I mistake not you\nremember it very well. (S. : Yes, I remember it, but do not worry about it\nnow. It will come again. You can go on.) I only was disturbed because\nof the accident that I could not make clear, and Charles interrupted me\nsomewhat because he had a ferer, and yet we are not suffering with anything,\ndon't think that, James, will you. (S. : No, I shall not. It is all right.)\"\nA confused reference was then made to my aunt, and in a moment his place\nwas taken by my sister Annie (pp. 449-450).\nThe incidents about my aunt helping bring us up after the death\nof my mother are all true. I had mentioned her name and my memory\nof her care for us when we were young in my letter read to the\nhand on February 22nd (p. 400). The time and place relations in the\nstatement are exactly correct, except that there is an error in the\nletter for the town indicated. It should have been X. (for Xenia).\nMy aunt did not remain as long with us as the language here might\nimply. She remained with us three years. The reference to the special\ncare, with the italics, has a very definite pertinence for all the\nmembers of the family who know the facts, and the story cannot\nbe told here, as it is too personal. The name Clarke is not correct,\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 77\nthough it is the same as has usually heen given for the uncle\nmeant, and the answer, that he was related by marriage only,\nstates the case rightly, as no indication in the name here or in the\nquestion I put occurs to suggest this answer. That he is on \" that\nside \" is also correct, also the time relation in our parlance, this being\nseven months previous to these sittings. He also died suddenly, but it\nwas not from pneumonia. It was by an accident on a railway. This\nis apparently indicated in the allusion here to an accident. But it\nwill be interesting to note in this confusion that the uncle, James\nMcClellan, who had been mentioned a few minutes before, had died\nfrom pneumonia, and the allusion to Charles, my brother, saying that he\n\" had a fever \" was also correct, he having died of scarlet fever. My\nnotes deal with this confusion at length (p. 513). It is also interesting\nto see how much truth lies in the background of the confusion, especi\nally when we remember that the name of my brother has often appeared\nas that of my uncle. The confusion consequently seems to show\nindications that the communicator was conscious of it, or uncertain\nwhether I had gotten his message rightly.\nAfter my sister's long communication, father returned and referred\nto certain habits of my brother. \" Do you remember where George\nused to go, and it did not please me very well. You see the hours I\nspent over him and with him, the advice I gave him, and very little\ngood at times. I remember Frank, and I also recall the time he caught\nthe fish. Do you remember that Sunday 1 \" I asked if he meant Frank,\nand the reply came : \" Yes ; I refer to him as he knew about it and\nthe trouble it gave me.\" After some interlocution regarding my going\nhome and the communicator's desire that I ask Frank about it, he\ncontinued, \" And there was a place he used to go evenings, and both\nhis aunt and myself did our best to keep him out of temptation.\" I\nrepeated my query to know if Frank was meant, and the reply was,\n\" Yes, I do mean Frank \" (p. 454).\nMy father did deprecate the social habits of my brother George,\nthough his reason for it did not reflect on this brother. The fishing\nincident I knew nothing about, but inquiry developed that the only\nfishing experience that gave Frank any trouble with father was on a\nSaturday and not on Sunday, and that the escapade also involved my\nbrother Robert. The same inquiry also showed that neither father nor\naunt ever complained of Frank's social habits. Now it was the social\nlife of my brother Robert that should be deprecated in the messages\nhere, while those of my brother George were never rebuked by my\nfather for moral reasons. In fact, the whole passage is definitely\napplicable to my brother Robert, and not to the others, except that\nFrank was connected with the trouble about fishing, and that father\ndid object to George's going to a certain place. The mistake here is\n\f78 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nsomewhat like that of the guitar (p. 461). Consequently there would\nbe absolutely no clue to any possible truth in these messages, except for\nthe incident in which this brother Robert was involved with Frank,\nnamely, the fishing. My notes make this incident clear (p. 516).\nFollowing the above and in the same sentence came : \" But do you\nremember anything about War 1 (S. : Yes, I do. Go on.) and the\nmental anxiety I passed through at that time 1 (S. : Yes, I remember\nit very well indeed.) and my leg ? I am getting tired, James. Will rest\na moment and return \" (p. 454). Father did pass through a very anxious\ntime during the Civil War, as he was much interested in the abolition\nof slavery. He would probably have volunteered but for the injury to\nhis back and leg which had incapacitated him for the duties of a\nsoldier.\nMy brother Charles followed with some communications, and when\nfather returned he made a number of statements of minor importance,\nand the sitting closed with a reproduction of what might close a letter\nfrom him. \" I must leave you soon, they say, so accept my little helps\nand remember me as your * * [undec.] father, R. H. Hyslop.\"\nThere was no intermediate H in his name, which was simply Robert\nHyslop. It is not impossible that the surname is an expansion of the\ninitial \" H \" (p. 456).\nThe first communicator in the next sitting, that of June 5th, was\nmy mother. The only evidential incident in her communication was\nthe question whether I had any more headaches ; I often suffered with\nthem when she was living and she gave me soda for them. After\nfourteen or thereabouts I had no trouble with them. My father\nfollowed with some short unevidential messages, though alluding to\npast communications and difficulties in sending them (p. 458). His\nplace was then taken by my \" uncle Clarke,\" who gave the clearest set\nof messages he had given since the sitting of December 24th.\nThe most striking feature of it was the coming on of confusion just as\nhe mentioned the name of my sister Lida, and my father's taking up\nthe thread at once in a relative clause, saying : \" which is the one I\nfailed to mention . . . and I had to come to straighten out uncle\nClarke's mind, James \" (p. 460). This was correct. Lida was the one I\nhad in mind a previous sitting (p. 441) when I said that one beside\nmy stepmother had not been mentioned. Alluding to my sister Lida,\nstill, my father went on with the communications :\u2014\nI wanted to speak of her myself, James (S. : Yes, that is right) and I\nwanted to hear her sing. Do you hear me clearly ? (S. : Yes.) I know you\nwill remember the organ (S. : I remember it.), and I was just thinking of\nour Sunday evenings at home. (S. : Yes.) Yes, although time has changed\nthose days they are still lingering in my memory (S. : Yes, I remember\nthem. Please go on.), and I remember our little family circle very well.\n\fxLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 79\nYou see I go back some time ago for the purpose of recalling incidents which\ntook place when you were one of them. I am not dreaming, my son, but I\nam quite clear and near. I had no idea at first what you really wished of\nme, then it all came to me when you said : [hand indicates R. H.] Well, how\nwould you have James know it was you ? [Hand moves towards R. H.]\n(R. H. : Yes, I said that.) Yes, you said that. I remember the organ and\nour singing the . . . Oh, what was that hymn, James, we used to sing\nso often 1 (Keep calm. It will come all right.) N . . . Well, I will\nthink of it presently and ... is it all clear to you, or are you con\nfused 1 \" (p. 460).\nWe did have an organ, and father wanted my sister Lida to learn\nto play and sing with it. The close proximity of the allusion to\n\" Sunday evenings at home \" to that about the organ seems to imply\nthe habit of spending those evenings about the organ. But this was\nnot the fact. It was positively forbidden, as father was opposed to all\nsuch music on Sundays, and also to its use in any form of worship.\nThe Sunday evenings were spent in a far more prosaic manner, though in\nan appropriate religious way. All the singing about the organ was done\non week days. The statement that the events here mentioned belonged\nto the time when I was a member of the family circle was exactly correct.\nThe reason specified for his giving these incidents in connection with\nthe allusion to Dr. Hodgson's explanation of what I wanted in the\nproof of identity is an interesting bit of intelligence, as this explanation\nwas made on February 7th previous (p. 374), and father was not before\nsufficiently acquainted with either this problem or scientific questions\nto appreciate the matter without direction. The resumption of the\norgan and hymn singing contains the implication that this special hymn\nwas accompanied by the use of the organ, but this was never done\nwith the \"hymn\" that I would expect him to speak of here. In fact,\n\"psalm\" is the word that I ought to have gotten. There was a\nspecial psalm that was frequently sung at family worship. But as the\nsame mistake in the use of \" Sunday \" is made as before (cf. p. 432),\nwe can understand on the supposition of an intermediary, G. P.,\nhow the terms would not be father's. G. P. stated on June 6th,\nthe next sitting (p. 468), that he was present at this sitting for a few\nmoments at least. But the association of the organ and the singing\nof this \" hymn \" could be accounted for only on the supposition that\nhe had changed his views on the matter of instrumental music\n(cf., allusion to hymn, p. 389), and was too confused to state what he\nhad in mind. It is possible that we children sang some of Moody's\nand Sankey's hymns with an organ accompaniment on week-days, but\nas no one attempted to play the organ but myself, and I only chords,\nit is not a fact that makes the incident here any clearer.\nThe next incident is one of very considerable interest. I shall give\nit in full. It follows the one just given and without interruption.\n\f80 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nIt is most interesting also to remark that it concerns a musical\ninstrument, probably suggested by the reference to the organ, and\nbelongs to the same period of the \" family circle \" alluded to above.\nYes. Oh . . . what has Will done with the flute . . . not\nflute, I ... oh dear I know so well what I mean . . fid . . .\nfiddle . . . fiddle. (S. : I do not know, but I think you are\nthinking of another brother and another musical instrument.) Yes, I think\nI am thinking of George (S. : That is right. ) and his C . . . Vial\n. . . it is my fault . . . [R. H. puts knife on table.] I am thinking\nof George and his . . . the instrument he used to play . . . but\nthe name has gone. [Hand sways in the air and moves fingers suggesting\nplaying a guitar. J. H. H.] (S. to R. H. : Look at that hand. Do not\nbother about the name now. I know exactly what you mean.) Yes, all\nright. After I go out I will return and recall it. I feel I must go for a\nmoment (p. 461).\nThis is sufficiently explained by the simple fact that my brother\nGeorge had a guitar on which he learned to play, and father\nhad known nothing about it for seventeen years before his death.\nThe dramatic play of imitating the use of the instrument, together\nwith the confusion of names for it, was exceedingly interesting, and is\none of those complex incidents which are difficult of explication by\ntelepathy.\nA long communication from my brother Charles followed, and the\nsitting came to a close.\nIn the next sitting, June 6th, after the usual preliminaries, G. P.\nspoke a few words with Dr. Hodgson, saying that he had helped \" a\nman by the name of Charles \" the last time, but did not have time to\nsay \" How de do, H.\" He alluded to his intention to aid an elderly\ngentleman, and my father appeared ready to communicate, when I\nasked for the communication of incidents that occurred before I was\nborn, and which my two aunts would know. TJ'he matter was further\nexplained to Rector and G. P., who made it clear to my father, to\nwhom I had used the expression that this plan would \" shut out the\nthought theory,\" to which he had alluded in the Swedenborg incident\n(p. 438). He expressed his understanding of my object, and left to\n\" think it over.\" His place was taken for a few minutes by my cousin,\nRobert McClellan.\nWhen father returned, he at once said:\u2014\" Will you kindly ask Aunt\nEliza if she remembers a young man named Baker, and if she recall\ngoing to a prayer meeting one evening with him, and if she remembers\nwho teased her about him, and ask them both if they remember Jeriy.\n<R. H. : Jerry 1 ) Yes. (S. to R. H. : That's right.) Perhaps\nyou may know this. If you do, say so, James, and I will think of\nsomething else which you do not know \" (p. 469). Interested in the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 81\nmention of this name, I asked for its completion, when I was told,\u2014\nevidently by Rector, as the interjection is his,- -\" Ah, but it is no use\nif you know it. . . . \"\u2014a fine rebuke for my own disregard of the\ndemand that I had made, as I did know of this person having been in\nthe family. Father then continued and said : \"But ask her,\" referring\nevidently to the same aunt as before, \" if she remembers who put the\nshoes in her bed and a sock on the post. No one on earth can know\nthis, as mother is here and she and the Rogers girl only will testify to\nit. [Excitement in hand.] I have something better. Ask her if\nshe recalls the evening when we broke the wheel to our ivagon . .\nand who tried to cover it up, so it would not leak out so to speak. I\nremember it as if it happened yesterday, and she will remember it too.\nI cannot tell you any more just now, but I will think over what is on\nmy mind about our school days and of my trying to preach to the boys\nin the barn and more about it. Be sure and ask about Baker, Jerry\nand the broken wheel.\" He then left and was followed by my uncle\nJames McClellan (p. 470).\nNeither of my two aunts could remember anything of these incidents,\nexcept the pertinence of the reference to Jerry and that father did\ntease his sister Eliza about walking home from a prayer meeting,\nthough the name Baker is not right. This Jerry was an orphan\nboy taken into the family when I was a very young child and I have\nno personal recollection of him, as he left the family before I was old\nenough to remember him. But I have heard father and my two aunts\nmention him often, as there were special reasons in his innocent\nstupidity for remembering him. It is also natural that my two aunts\nshould not recall the other incidents here mentioned, as one of them is\nseven and the other thirteen years younger than father, the latter,\nEliza, being the one that figures in all but one of the above incidents.\nWhen father returned at the close of my uncle's communications he\nalluded to a box of minerals that he said he had when a boy. After some\nbrief allusions to a box of books (p. 473) he gave the long and remark\nable incidents about our conversation on spirit communication alluded\nto earlier (p. 474), and as the sitting was coming to an end, referred\nto the difficulties of expressing himself, with the remark that he hoped\nhis thought in fragments would at least comfort me a little, apparently\naccepting the work as a matter of personal interest and consolation to\nme. I saw this and expressed the hope that it would help me in the\ngreat cause for the world, and the pertinent reply came : \" Yes, and\nhumanity at large, I trust.\" He then bade me good-bye, saying :\n\" Good-bye, Robert Hyslop, your old father \" (p. 475).\nI could not verify the statement about the \" box of minerals,\" so\ncalled, but I found that he was once interested in Indian relics, and\nknew myself that he once had a small collection of Indian stone relics.\nn\n\f82 [l,AKT\nJ. H. Hytlop, Ph.D.\nThe sitting for June 8th was opened by some advice and prescrip\ntions from the trance personalities in behalf of both my physical and\nspiritual welfare, in which there are evident traces of a serious purpose,\nhoweverwe interpretthem (p. 488). When fatherappeared, he firstreferred\nto his having made the acquaintance of Dr. Hodgson's father, and\nmentioned their agreement and differences in belief when living (Cf. p.\n389). He then said that he had learned from \"them,\" the trance\npersonalities, that I was going away, and that he wanted Dr. Hodgson\nto take his messages sometimes. He then asked if I was going home\nsoon, and I replied in the affirmative. He promised to be there and to\nwatch for anything we said, and report it to Dr. Hodgson. Nothing\ncame of this. He repeated some questions about incidents that he had\ntold me, and expressing his satisfaction with my reply and getting\nthese things off his mind, asked, \" Do you remember that Eliza's name\nwas really Elizabeth 1 She was named Elizabeth as a child, and as\ntime went on we began to call her Eliza \" (p. 491).\nAunt Nannie denied that there was any truth in this. Aunt Eliza\nherself said that she was called Lizzie when a child, and was afterward\ncalled Eliza, by which latter name I had always known her.\nShortly afterwards father asked me to talk to him as I used to do,\nand as I had kept him all these sittings telling his own story, I at once\ntook up the request, and there began as clear a conversation, with\npertinent answers and incidents, as ever came through a telephone.\nI began the conversation with the statement : \" I bought the\nhouse in which you lived out West in order to avoid expenses with the\ncourts.\" The reply and conversation came as follows : \" Oh, I under\nstand well. I&mglad. (S. : George is still on the northern land.) And\nwill be, I fear\"(p. 491 ). Both these answers are to the point, and the first\none properly appreciative. My father had wanted for years to have his\nnorthern land sold and my brother to leave that locality. Then\nfollowed a very remarkable incident. I asked : \" You will remember\nHarper Crawford, I think 1 \" This man was one of father's old\nneighbours, and his daughter married my brother. As soon as the\nquestion was put the hand showed considerable excitement, and the\nanswer began :\u2014\nYes, I do very well. What about him ? I have tried and tried and tried to\nspell his name for you, but I could not seem to articulate for their understand\ning. (S. : Yes, I understand perfectly. I shall mention another too. Do you\nremember Robert Cooper ?) Certainly I do very well indeed, and I have\nintended to speak his name for you also, but tell me about the mortgage.\n(S. : I have not heard about it, but shall learn this summer.) And then let\nme know about HARPERS. (S. : Harper Crawford, you mean.)\n[Hand assents.] (S. : All right. I shall do so.) I want to know this one\nthing only. Are they doing anything about the church 1 (S. : What\nchurch do you refer to, the church in your old Ohio home ?) [Assent.] (S. : I\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 83\nhave not heard, but shall inquire.) They have put in an organ\u2014Organ.\nThey have put in an organ, James. (S. : Very well, I shall look this up.\nDo you mean the first U. P. Church ?) I cannot seem to get that, James.\n[Hand listens again.] (S. : Do you mean the First United Presbyterian\nChurch ?) I cannot get that, can you say it for me slowly ? (S. : Do you\nmean the First United Presbyterian Church ?) Say the two last slowly\u2014\ngot it all but that. (S. : U-ni-ted.) Yes. (S. : Pres-by-te-ri-an.) Yes, 1\ndo. (S. : Very well, I understand. You say they have an organ now.) I\nsay yes. (S. : Very well. I shall be glad to find out about it.) Yes, but I\nam telling you. (S. : I understand perfectly, that will be a good test.)\nWell, it is so, James (p. 491).\nI interrupted the conversation with my father about Harper\nCrawford by a reference to Robert Cooper, as the reader will observe.\nThe allusion to the mortgage has this interest. My cousin Robert\nCooper was burdened with a mortgage on his property at the time of\nmy father's death, and my cousin Robert McClellan had helped him\nout of embarrassment. My father never knew these facts, but the\ndeath of Robert McClellan a year later and the fact that he is one of\nthe communicators in this record enables us to suppose that my father\nmight have obtained his information on the \" other side.\"\nI learned also when in the West that an organ had been put into\nthe Sunday-school and later into the body of the First United\nPresbyterian Church to which Harper Crawford belonged, and also\nthat this Harper Crawford was one of the two or three persons that\nleft that church on account of this very fact. The other persons who\nleft this church for the same reason were my uncle Carruthers\n(\" Clarke \" of these communications) and his wife. On the examina\ntion of my father's correspondence, which I had kept, I found that one\nletter, about two months before his death, had mentioned the fact that\nMr. Crawford had left this church, but the letter does not say why, so\nthat I was in all probability ignorant of the organ incident, while\nonly my subliminal can be said to have known the fact of the man's\nleaving the church. But in any case, to start this remarkable incident\nbelonging to a memory a thousand miles distant, and selected from\nthe whole universe of living consciousness, just by mentioning a name,\nis an achievement in telepathy, if that is the explanation, that makes\none wonder why the name of my stepmother was not gotten more\neasily.\nThis incident was immediately followed by another which has less\nevidential value, perhaps, to an outsider, but which abounds with\nindications of personal knowledge regarding facts commonly known to\nboth of us in connection with my brother :\u2014\nTell me something more about George. He always did look out for number\none. (S. : Yes, I cannot tell very much about George, because, as you\nknow, he very seldom writes letters. You understand.) Yes, 1 think I do,\na 2\n\f84 J. H. Byslop, PhD.\nperfectly well. (S. : When I come back here again I think I can tell you\nmany things about him.) Yes, but, James, I know a great deal myself\nand did worry as you must know. (S. : Yes, I understand, and you know I\nworried much also.) Yes. Who could know better than I do. Remember\nwhat we talked over when you came out there. (S. : Yes.) Well. 1 can\nsay only one thing. Do not worry any more about him or anything else\n(p. 492).\nThe pertinence of this is sufficiently indicated when I say that\nevery word of it is true. Father had worried a great deal about my\nbrother George, and I with him. But as my statements suggest the\nother facts, there is only the appreciation expressed in the words\nitalicised, thus marked in the original, and here, as having an interest\nfor the emotional element in this study of the unity of consciousness.\nBut the narrative goes on with an interesting return to the mental\nstate just indicated. I said : \u2014\n(S. : No, I will try not to worry.) And about the fence. I am thinking\nabout the tax I left. (S. : The tax has been paid. I settled that all right.\nNearly all the debts have been cleared off. We owe only aunt Nannie a\nlittle.) Oh, what a relief to my mind. I have thought and thought and\nthought what would Frank or George do if they had a hand in it. Do you\nremember what you did for me once (S. : I am not sure just now, but if\nyou will remind me.) in rogard to a tax one year? It was what I wrote you\nabout and you actively helped. (S. : I do not remember it, but you must\nnot be surprised, because I helped you so often with money, you remember.)\nYes, but about . . . dear James, do you not remember just before I\ncame here I was not well at the time and I wrote to you about the tax ?\nI should never forget it. (S. : I do not exactly recall it, but I think it most\nprobable, because I know just what the situation was). Well, it will come\nback to you I hope as it will live with me forever. What about the fence ?\nDo you know what I mean ? (S. : I think I do. I know that we have\nrepaired the fence.) All right. I intended to have it done before I left,\nand I also had this on my mind (p. 493).\nThis is a most interesting passage. His taxes at the time of his\ndeath were unpaid, because of the total failure of the wheat crop, and\nno man that I ever knew hated more to be unable to pay his taxes.\nHis finances were in a sad condition for the reason mentioned, and he\nhad concealed this fact absolutely from me. It was his intention to\nprovide for this and the repair of his farm fences by borrowing. But\nthere is a wonderful pertinence in the allusion to my two brothers.\nFrank was an invalid at the time (cf. p. 441) and unable even to attend\nthe funeral, with no expectation of ever recovering his health, and was\nnamed as one of the executors of the estate in father's will. Frank\nthen was in no condition to settle up the confusion incident to all\naffairs of this sort. I learned also in the West, after the sittings,\nwhat I did not know before, that my brother George had been named\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 85\nin the will as one of the executors ; but some years before his death,\nfor the reasons implied in the appreciative conversation above and\ndissatisfaction with this brother's business methods, my father removed\nhis name from the will, and two or three days before his death sub\nstituted mine for that of my stepmother. The next incident about\nanother tax I did not remember, but thought it referred to the one that\nI paid just after his death. But I found in his letters that it was just\nas said here, except that it was not just before his death. It was in\n1892. He wrote me about his tax, and instead of asking me to lend\nhim money for it, requested me to write to my brother Will and\nurge him to settle the matter. I do not remember doing so, but my\nhabit of always meeting such requests would justify my saying that I\nprobably did so. My brother Will finds on his books that he had paid\nthe tax after the date of my father's letter.\nSoon after I remarked regarding the cane that it was connected\nwith the campaign, asking if he remembered it, and father replied :\n\" Yes, well, and I remember the talk with R. about the president.\"\nThis referred to the talk with my cousin Robert McClellan on politics,\nas mentioned (p. 494). He then mentioned a chest, which he said he\nhad bought at an auction years ago, and had kept on an attic floor.\nI remarked, using my stepmother's name, Maggie, purposely, that she\nwould probably know, and he asked if she had not put the stick (cane)\nin it. This incident is not exactly true as it is stated, but it is possible\nthat there are some confused facts in it (p. 495). As the sitting\nclosed he said, assuming that I was going home as promised him,\n\" You will give my love to Maggie, Nannie, Eliza. Oh, she is not\nthere, but take it to her,\" apparently discovering that one of them, I\ncannot tell which, could not be seen at the old home. This would\nbe true of my stepmother. Mrs. Piper then began to come out of the\ntrance (p. 496).\nRecapitulation.\nThe reader who has followed the preceding account through all its\ndetails will, perhaps, be as much impressed by the apparent confusion in\nmany of the incidents as by the definitely correct statements. But I\nhave tried to suggest that even the confusions and errors are accom\npanied usually by true statements and have such associations with the\ncourse of thought on the part of the communicator that they continually\nindicate groups of memories pertaining to my father's mind. It is,\nof course, difficult to estimate the value of all this material. It is, so\nto speak, like a fitful and incoherent dream, or series of dreams, or\nbetter still, like the wandering mental condition of a hypnotic patient\nwith the ordinary inhibitions cut off and yet aware of a definite\npurpose to be executed, with interludes of close approximation to the\n\f86 [part\nJ. H. Hijslop, Ph.D.\nordinary waking consciousness. One of the questions, therefore, that\nwe have to determine is, how far the facts are actual manifestations of\na particular personality.\nTo enable the reader to appreciate my answer to this question more\nfully I here summarise briefly the chief types of references made by\nmy father from which I think it will be evident, without any doubt\nwhatever, that the communicating intelligence claiming to be my\nfather is either actually this person (with his mind at times somewhat\nconfused and labouring under difficulties in expressing himself to me),\nor a very extraordinary personation of him that has acquired a know\nledge of his experience ranging from an early period to his death, and\nincluding not only a proper appreciation of the matters in which he\nwas most interested, but specific recollections of little possessions and\npeculiarities, some of which were entirely unknown to myself.\nHis own name and mine were correctly given and it was he who\nfirst mentioned Robert and eventually Frank and Hettie as among his\nchildren. I mentioned George myself first (with the intention of\nmisleading the communicator), and other communicators mentioned the\nrest of the children, Margaret, Sarah, Annie, Charles, Will and Lida\nbefore my father did so. The distinction was correctly indicated in all\nof these names between the living and the dead. The names Ellen\nand Helen occurred in my father's communications without an}* state\nments that showed what relevance was intended, though in the case of\nHelen the connection suggests that it might be a mistake for Henrietta,\nthe name of my half-sister. They are not the names of any members\nof his immediate family.\nThe most notable cases of names which were either not obtained at\nall or obtained only after much difficulty were Maggie, McClellan,\nHenrietta, Martha, and Carruthers. Some effort was made to get the\nname Carruthers, but after I was apparently satisfied with Clarke no\nfurther attempts were made. Martha was given as Mary and I did\nnot press for its correction, as it was obvious, both from the context\nand the correctness of the other two parts of the name, who was\nmeant. McClellan was finally given in practically correct form by\nG. P., who gave also Margaret for Maggie and Hettie for Henrietta,\nrather curious variations from what were dominant in my mind.\nWhatever detailed references my father made to the members of his\nfamily concerning his personal relations with them and his appreciation\nof the points in their character were pertinent throughout, except in\nthe one instance in which the language he used fitted Robert and was\nnot applicable to Frank to whom it was applied. The most important\ninstances of these were connected with myself (his opinion of me and\nwhat he used to say to my stepmother) and with George and the worry\nabout him. Also the special care of one of them in connection with the\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 87\nreference to our bringing up in the old home, and the mention of my\nsister Lida and the organ. We might also include the reference to his\nfrankness in expressing his personal feelings towards us when he broke\nhis usual reservation.\nThe quiet manner of father's life for twenty years before his death\nleft him little with which to occupy himself except his personal interest\nin the members of his family, the management of his finances which\ngave him a great deal of vexation, and the events of the day in politics\nand religion. Our correspondence was almost exclusively on the\nsubject of politics and his financial affairs, never on religion after 1885.\nNot a word came from him spontaneously on the subject of politics.\nBut his allusion to the taxes, the fence and his worry about my brother\nGeorge were entirely appropriate to the reasons for the financial concern\nhe felt in life. His immediate reference to the mortgage when I\nmentioned Robert Cooper was relevant in this connection.\nMy father's habits of religious thought come out in various places\nin the record, as in the consolatory messages to his sisters for their\nrecent bereavement, the reference to his \" Sunday preaching \" and\nprayers, incidental references to his moral and religious solicitude for\nmyself, and in the special incidents which apparently indicate a\nchange of conviction in matters in which he had been extremely con\nservative, as in his conversation with Dr. Hodgson ending with the\nsignificant allusion to the hymn, \"Nearer my God to Thee.\" Closely\nassociated with the same were his repeated references to the important\ntalks with myself on this whole question of psychical research and a\nfuture life, when he reminded me of \" the thought theory,\" hallucina\ntion, my doubts, hypnotism, \" manifestations \" recognised as apparitions,\nmy experiment with the young woman in connection with her dream,\nand Swedenborg's opinions, all of which formed the subject of those\nconversations.\nAlso certain facts associated with his sickness and all the main\nsymptoms and incidents accompanying the last hours of his life, though\nconnected with more than the usual confusion and difficulty, and\nthe clear allusion to my voice being the last that he heard. Similarly\nhis remembrances about the medicines which he took were in most\ncases less clear than is desirable, as he specified some which he had\nonly thought of taking (Maltine and Munyon's), and at least one of\nwhich there is no evidence that he had taken it at all (morphine). He\nmentioned one of which I was ignorant (the preparation of oil), and\none which I had casually heard of in a letter and had forgotten\n(strychnine). His chief success was in specifying correctly in reply to\nmy question the medicine which I had obtained for him (Hyoinei).\nThe incidents of his early life, given in response to my demand for\nsomething that occurred before I was born, were very clear. They\n\f88 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nwere the Baker incident, Jerry, the broken wheel, the shoes in the bed,\nand the preaching to the boys in the barn. The meaning of the name\nJerry I happened to know, and the incident of walking home with a\nyoung man from prayer meeting is true, except the name Baker, but\nthe others were unverifiable.\nTwo automatisms appeared to have some significance. They were\nthe reference to my sister Hettie's playing, and the phrase, \" Give me\nmy hat,\" both indicating actual facts in my father's life and know\nledge.\nAnother series of references which I may here group together con\ncern my father's personal experiences, appearances, and little personal\nhabits and articles that he possessed. Curiously enough his recollec\ntions about these were the most confused, possibly in some cases\npositively erroneous, where my own memory was most clear, and, in\nfact, nearly all his most specific references concerned articles the very\nexistence of which was not known to me at all. That he was a little\nelderly gentleman, that he could only whisper, that he had no teeth,\nand that he could not sing were correct statements made about him as\nMrs. Piper returned to consciousness. The reference to his books,\npictures, etc., had some pertinence, but they were confused and of no\nevidential value, though I was familiar with the circumstances connected\nwith them. But the references to the trouble with the left eye, the\nmark near the ear, the thin coat or dressing-gown he wore mornings,\nthe black skull cap, the tokens, the stool, the writing pad, the rests, and\nthe round and square bottles on his desk, the paper-cutter, his diary,\nthe brown handled knife and the nail paring, and the horse Tom in\nconnection with George were mentioned with almost precise correctness,\nand were all but the tokens, the diary, and the last incident wholly\nunknown to me. The visit to George and Will before moving West was\nalso probably unknown to me. The references to the place in which he\nsaid he kept his tin spectacle case and the paper knife were not true,\nand the box of minerals was either a false or an indeterminate incident.\nThe most important instances of error in my father's communica\ntions, and which will be regarded by many persons as telling against\nhis identity, although I myself explain them, as the reader understands,\non the assumption of temporary confusion in the act of communicating,\nor possibly as due to an error of memory, are as follow : That he sent\nme books, a box with two books, that Will had his foot injured appar\nently on the railroad, that there was trouble with Frank's fishing on\n\" Sunday \" (instead of Saturday), that it was Frank (instead of Robert)\nwho was exposed to social temptations, that Will played the flute or\nfiddle (instead of George and the guitar), Ferdinand (for Anderson),\npneumonia for accident, the misapplication of \" cousin \" to his nephew,\napparently a visit to Frank, apparently also the intimation that Jennie\n\fXLi.] Obso-vations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 89\nwas the name of a relative of my step-mother, and the other mistakes\nin connection with the names of persons and medicines mentioned\nabove.\nFinally, there are various more or less complex groups of incidents\nmentioned by my father which it is difficult to estimate evidentially\nfrom the objective point of view, owing to the error or confusion with\nwhich most of them are complicated, or to the impassibility of verifica\ntion. And yet, on the whole, they appear to strengthen distinctly the\nevidence that my father was actually communicating. They are the\ntrip to the lake, the railroad accident, in which he was concerned, the\ncanes, the fire and his fright, the Cooper incidents, the church and the\norgan in connection with Harper Crawford, the \"coach \" and the rough\nroads and country in Ohio, and the talk with the principal of the\nschool about George, etc. From my point of view, neither successes\nnor failures in recollection by the communicator in regard to individual\nfacts, like names or isolated references and events, are at all comparable\nin evidential value with groups of facts constituting an organic and\ncomplex whole, and associated together, as they would be, in my father's\nmind, even if these groups of references are accompanied by some\nincoherence, confusion, and error. Even if we supposed that the first\nthree of the above groups of incidents were to be estimated as entirely\nfalse (two of which I have so classed in the statistical summary for the\nsake of avoiding inaccuracy on the other side), and the fourth as\nwithout value one way or the other, there would remain three striking\npages, or chapters, so to speak, of the actual personal experiences in\nmy father's life which were reproduced with almost absolute correct\nness. An interesting feature about them is that in two out of three\ncases the main points were entirely unknown to myself.\nThere was nothing in my father's general mental habits, except his\nreligious affiliations, that would give him any peculiarities of phrase\nby which his personality might be easily and distinctly recognisable.\nOccasional words and phrases which I have noted in their place are\ndecidedly not characteristic of him, and may be attributed to the\ntrance personalities or to G.P., as the use of \"Sunday\" for Sabbath,\n\" coach \" for carriage, \" library \" for sitting-room, etc. But such as\nwere characteristic, though individually frequent perhaps in the use of\nother people, may collectively have some interest as possibly evidential\nto that extent, The most distinctly recognisable instances, some of\nthem unknown to me, were : \" You had your own ideas,\" \" stick to\nthis,\" \" well I was not so far wrong after all,\" \" my sincerity of purpose,\"\n\"do not worry, it does not pay,\" \"meeting face to face,\" and being\n\" reunited \" after death, \" what is their loss is our gain,\" \" the least\nsaid the sooner mended,\" \"you are not the strongest man,\" \"remember\nit as if it happened yesterday,\" etc.\n\f90 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nThere will, of course, be various opinions regarding the strictly\nevidential value of the communications alleging their sources from my\nfather, whether taken individually or collectively. But I think that\nthe reader will no doubt agree, after examining my experiments on the\nidentification of personality which are given in Appendix V., and\nnoting the slight evidence necessary for establishing identity, that, if\nordinary agencies are inadequate to account for the phenomena of\nthis record, I am either actually communicating with the independent\nintelligence of my father, or that we have a most extraordinary\nimpersonation of him, involving a combination of telepathic powers\nand secondary personality with its dramatic play that should as much\ntry our scepticism as the belief in spirits.\n\" Uiicle Charles \" (Carruthers).\nThe name of my uncle, James Carruthers, who died December 2nd,\n1898, was never obtained directly from him nor in any clearly recog\nnised form. But the name of his wife (my aunt), his relationship to\nvarious persons in the family, some incidents in his life, and an indica\ntion of the accident by which he lost his life, unmistakably suggested\nwho was meant by \" Uncle Charles \" and \" Uncle Clarke.\" Most of\nhis own attempts at communication were exceedingly confused, though\nnot worse than many instances of my cousin to be considered next. In\nsome cases he was apparently unable to complete a sentence, so that if\nwe had not better data upon which to form a judgment than his mes\nsages, we should have to treat the record more sceptically ; but taken in\nconnection with clearer communicators, we can detect an intelligible\nmeaning in this instance, while we remark that the confusion in it is\nincompatible with any rational application of the telepathic hypothesis.\nThe first indication of his presence is in the first sitting on\nDecember 23rd, 1898, but it is so slight that I should never have sus\npected it but for the evidence of its connection with later develop\nments. In this sitting the short communication occurred : \" Do you\nremember who you used to call Ell . . . el ( 1 ) . . . not\ndistinct. . . . Where is Robertson 1 \" (p. 310). I took this as a\nconfused attempt to get the name of my brother Robert, but later\npassages in which it occurs (Cf. pp. 317, 332) rather indicate that it is for\n\" Robert's son \" and an inquiry for me, as he always called father by\nthe name of Robert. The \"Ell ...\" and \"el . . . \" are\nbroken attempts at the name of his wife, as we shall learn from the\nnext message (p. 314).\nIn the second sitting, December 24th, the following occurred : \" What ia\nit ? E * * [undec.] Elsie El . . . is . . . Elsie. (S. : 1 don't know\nthat name.) Eliza . . . Eliza (S. : Are you calling Eliza ?) Yes. (S. :\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 91\nYes, I understand.) I am, James. (S. : Yes. What do you wish to\nsay to her?) Give my love (S. : Yes, I will.) and tell her not to get\ndiscouraged. She will be better soon. Understand ? (S. : Yes, I under\nstand.) I often see her despairing. Where is she now, James ? I will go\nthere soon. (S. : She is at home. Do you know why she grieves ?)\n[Hand points towards invisible.] Yes, because I left her. But I really did\nnot leave her. I wish I could tell you all I would like, you would not\nthink I had left entirely. I feel much better now. She thought she saw\nme in her sleep. I was there. Father, father, father . . . going . . .\ngoing . . . going . . . be back soon.\" [Dr. Hodgson made a remark\nto me explaining the meaning of this last, and the communication began\nagain.] : ' Oh if you only knew how glad I am to see you, you would be glad,\nbecause it will be a help to me to go on in my life and keep her from\nfeeling any pain. (S. : Yes, tell all you can.) Will you comfort her?\nShe ought not to be lonely. I am trusting to Him [Imperator] to help me to\nspeak plainly. (S. : Yes, I will comfort her.) I am glad, so glad. Are\nyou still here ? I will look and see. I have not been here very long, and\nyet I would not return for all I ever owned, music, flowers, walks,\ndrives, pleasures of all kinds books and everything. I do remember\nall here so well. What can I do to help you all to know I live still. (S. :\nTell me all you can of your life here on earth.) Oh I should have much to\ndo. Where there is light I will always be. Mother, mother, going, going.\"\nHere my father returned to take my uncle's place, and asked me\nif I knew \" uncle Charles,\" saying, \" He is here.\" When I said that\nI did not know any such uncle, he replied that he was not a real uncle,\nand that I must remember what he meant (p. 316). James Carruthers\nmarried my father's sister, and it occurred to me that the \" uncle\nCharles \" was an attempt to give his name. This, with the pertinent\nindications of his identity in his own communications, gave me a\na definite clue upon which to depend in the future. He succeeded\nthis time in the name of his wife Eliza, and it is interesting to note\nthat it started with nearly the same form whose meaning I did not\nsuspect in the first sitting (p. 310 and above). The allusion to her\ndespair had, as a fact, more pertinence than I knew, and than such\na general and expected observation would usually imply, though I\ncannot treat it as evidential. (See Note 7, p. 353.) I found also on\ninquiry of my aunt that the mention of music, flowers, etc., contained\nvery pertinent indications of some of his pleasures and habits in life,\nabout which I knew nothing.\nApparently there is an interpolation by my father during my\nuncle's communications. At least the language : \" I feel much better\nnow. She thought she saw me in her sleep. I was there, father,\nfather,\" connecting the passage with his disappearance a few minutes\nbefore, and the fact that my aunt Eliza, who is referred to here, did\nhave a vivid dream in which she saw my father a short time after my\nuncle's death (Cf. p. 355), favour this interpretation. Possibly also the\n\f92 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nresemblance of the words \" mother, mother,\" etc., in the original to\n\" brother,\" as the two are very often written much alike, may suggest\nthe same conclusion, as my father was my uncle's brother-in-law.\nA little later in the same sitting he reappeared, and a remarkable\ncolloquy took place, upon which I shall comment in the discussion of\nthe dramatic play of personality, but there was little evidential matter\nin it. Following father's departure from the \"machine,\" he said :\u2014\nWhat can I do to help Eliza feel that I am not dead ? (S. : Tell us who\nare with you, and that will help Eliza.) Yes, all you shall know each one\nin her. . . You are not Robertson (?) are you? (R. H. : Is that\nRuber!sou ?) You are not George, are you? (S. : No, I am not George.)\n(R. H. : I am not . . .) No, James, I know you very well, but this\nother one. . . did you know the boys ... do you know me ?\n(p. 317).\nThe interest in this lies in the query whether Dr. Hodgson was\n\" Robertson,\" possibly Rector's mistake for \" Robert's son,\" (Robert\nHyslop's son.) I supposed in the query \"you are not George,\" the\nname of my brother, that he was asking this of me and I said I was\nnot, so that the next remark was very pertinent, while the ignorance\nabout Dr. Hodgson is a curious reflection upon the telepathic hypothesis\nafter his many years' acquaintance with Mrs. Piper's trance\npersonalities.\nIn the sitting of December 26th (p. 332), apparently my uncle again\ncommunicated. He asked : \" Where is Eliza?\" and said, \"I remember\nher and Robertson.\" W7ith some further incoherent statements bearing\ntraces of the temporary loss of the sense of personal identity, he\ndisappeared as father broke in with the curious remark : \" Yes, Hyslop.\nI know who I am and Annie too,\" at least apparently indicating\nvery clearly a consciousness of the situation and of the disturbed\nconsciousness of identity in my uncle.\nMy uncle did not appear again personally in this series of sittings,\nnor in those of Dr. Hcxlgson. But my father, in the sitting of\nDecember 24th, evidently alluded to the event of his death, as well as\nthat of another uncle, in his message of consolation to his two sisters\nfor their sorrow, saying : \" What is their loss is our gain,\" a very\ncharacteristic phrase of his in alluding to the incidence of death (p.316).\nIn the sitting of May 29th my father mentioned this uncle and tried\nto give his name, as already quoted, but got no nearer than\" Clarke,\"\nor \" Charles,\" (p. 422). These names were also repeated by him on\nMay 30th, and \"Chester \" added (p. 431). On May 31st (p. 442) the\nletters \" E. E. El . . . .\" came and nothing more, until later in the\nsitting (p. 445) when Rector wrote: \"Clarke is here again.\" I was\nimmediately asked: \" Do you know me 1 Do you remember James ? \"\nThis was the Christian name of my uncle, and I asked for the rest,\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 93\n,and evidently Rector replied : \" And it is Clarke. Both are here\n. are speaking to you.\" I asked : \"Is it James that speaks to\nme 1 \" and the reply was : \" Yes, there were two James, and do you\nremember an uncle. (S. : Yes, I remember, and uncle James what 1 )\nWell, it is he. (S. : Which uncle James ?) H . . . James Mc.\"\nHere I recognised James McClellan by saying, \"Yes, that is right \"\n(p. 445). But the sitting came to an end before anything more could\nbe made clear. On June 1st father referred to him again as \"Clarke,\"\nand said, in response to my question whether he had anything to do\nwith his sister, that it was \"only by marriage,\" and that he was on his\nside, both of which were correct and suggested his identity (p. 450).\nWhen I asked what brought him to his side, the answer came\n\" Why do you not remember of his coming here suddenly, James 1\n(S. : Yes.) It was pneumonia.\" The answer \" pneumonia \" was false\nfor the uncle Carruthers just mentioned, but true for the uncle James\nMcClellan, spoken of a few minutes earlier (p. 450), and then followed\nan allusion to \" the accident that I could not make clear \" which\nnearly answers my question as to the cause of my \" uncle Clarke's \"\ndeath (p. 450). My uncle Carruthers died suddenly from the effects\nof a railroad accident.\nOn June 5th he appeared personally, announced by Rector in the\nsentence, \" Here is Clarke.\" Uncle follows.\n\" Give my love to N. [Hand tightens in excitement, and pencil is\nnearly forced out from fingers. R. H. lays his hand gently over it.] Give\n. . . Give my love to Nan. And let me think a moment. I am a little\nanxious to tell you first about yourself. I left so suddenly I had no\ntime for anything. I am all right now, only my head troubles me\nwhen speaking. Wait for me. And do you remember Rice \" (?) (R.H. :\nRice?) [Assent.] [Then hand dissents violently.] (R.H. : No.) \"Yes\n. . . Piece (?) Pierce. I say Pierce . . . D.\" (S. to R.H. :\nI don't remember him.) (R.H. : Say so.) (S. : No, I do not remember\nhim, but you may say something about him and I shall inquire.) \"DR.\nPierce. Lidia. Lida... LI... Lid a.\" (S. : Yes, I\nremember Lida. What relation is she to me ?) \" Annie and she are cousins.\nLida. Aunt.\" (S. : Yes, which Annie is cousin of her 1) \" There is a sister\nAnnie and a cousin Annie and Aunt Lida. She was an aunt to James\nHyslopif I remember rightly and there is a sister in the body by that name,\"\nand there followed the remarkable relative clause in the person of my\nfather: \" Which is the one I failed to mention . . . and I had to come\nto straighten out uncle Clark's mind, James. I am your father. I had to\ncome and help uncle Clarke straighten out his thoughts.\" (p. 459.)\nThe whole passage is a remarkable one, and has many features of\nidentity in it. For reference to \" Nan \" see p. 536. The name\n\"Dr. Pierce,\" first \"Rice,\" is an apparent attempt to give the\nname of Dr. J. P. Dice, who was my father's physician, a friend of\n\f94 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthe Carruthers family, and who waited on father in my uncle's\nhouse during father's last illness. The letter D is significant for\nthis interpretation. My uncle would know, of course, that I would\nrecognise this doctor, and it was a good device for identifying himself\nin the absence of the ability to get his own name clearly. The name\n\" Lida \" was that of my sister, and she was so called in order to\ndistinguish her from this aunt Eliza for whom she was also named.\nMy uncle always called his wife \" Liza \" in familiar address. Coming\nin close connection with \" Lida \" the mistake is a natural one. The\nmention of my sister Annie was right, and if my conjecture (p. 536)\nis right, namely, that this \" cousin Annie \" is Rector's mistake for\ncousin Nannie, the relationship between her and my sister \" Lida \" is\nrightly named. It was also correct that this sister \" Lida \" was the\none that my father had not yet mentioned, for whom I had asked\npreviously without hinting at whom I wanted (p. 460).\nIn the same sitting a little later, my brother Charles alluded to\nthis \" Dr. Pierce,\" and said : \" He was a friend of uncle Clarke's, and\nhe is still over there \" (p. 463). Both statements are true of this Dr.\nJ. P. Dice, whom I interpret this \" Dr. Pierce \" to mean. No further\ncommunications came either from my uncle or about him, except in\nthe sitting of June 7th, when my father again alluded to him (p. 485),\nin connection with the incidents of our conversations in February,\n1895, regarding this subject of spiritism. Father referred in this com\nmunication to an alleged experience of my \"uncle Clarke,\" which I\ncould not verify, and which was said to be a \" notification of his\nsudden coming.\" His death was a very sudden one, from a railway\naccident, as already indicated.\nThe most interesting feature of the communications from my uncle\npersonally, and concerning him by others, is the difficulty that they\noffer to the telepathic hypothesis. They are by no means so clear as\nthose from my father. But the names, incidents, and relations involved\nare just as clear or unclear in my own mind and memory as the facts\nabout anybody else. There is absolutely no intelligible reason, from\nthe standpoint of telepathy, why there should be any more confusion\nin his case than in that of others, but we have in the actual messages\nexactly the personal equation and differences that we ought to expect\non the spiritistic theory in dealing with different communicators.\nThere is not very much of special significance that apparently came\ndirectly from this uncle. There is much confusion and the most\nimportant name attempted, that of Dr. J. P. Dice, was only given\npartially. In fact the statements made about my uncle by my father,\nthat he was my uncle ; that he was related to my father only by\nmarriage ; that his death was very sudden ; and the attempts to give\nhis name Carruthers, were perhaps as suggestive of his identity as any\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 95\nthat came directly from this uncle himself. On the other hand, the\nname of his wife, Eliza ; the reference to her despair and loneliness,\nthe special character of which I did not know ; the mention of the\n\" talks, walks, drives, flowers, music and pleasures of all kinds,\" which\nrepresented actual facts in his life of which I was not aware ; the\nstatement that he had not been long deceased ; the name and relation\nship to me of my sister Lida in conjunction with the name of my aunt\nEliza, his wife, form together, in spite of the confusion in his attempts\nto communicate, a group of statements which cannot be entirely\nignored.\nRobert Harvey McClellan.\nIt will be found that the communications of my cousin bear the\nsame characteristics of confusion in most cases as those of the uncle just\nconsidered. He died in 1897, about a year after my father, but was\nneither mentioned nor admitted as a communicator until my last series\nof sittings. In the sitting of May 29th my father evidently alluded\nto this cousin when he gave the name \" McCollum,\" saying that \" he\ncame over some time ago \" (p. 422), and later \" McAllan,\" when he\nspoke of him as \" cousin \" (p. 423). Early in the sitting for May 30th, my\ncousin appeared personally, and began an interesting communication\nas follows, opening it with a remark that apparently indicates that he\nhad been present some time before.\nI ain still here. I have been wondering if you remembered anything\nabout me. I am your cousin H. H. McAllen. Dont ... do you not\nhear me ? (S. : Yes, I hear you. I shall be glad for you to go on.) I am\nwith you still you see. Do you remember Wallace . . and Williams,\nthe Williams boys, I mean. I am at the moment trying to think what\nbecame of Robert. Speak to me for God's sake and help me to reach . . .\n(S. : Yes, I remember Robert, but which Robert is it ?) I think you say\nwhich Bob is it : well Hyslop. (S. : That's right.) I mean Rob Hyslop\nof course. Which other could I mean 1 (S. : Yes, I remember him. He is\nin Cincinnati.) Give him my greetings. I am a little dazed for the moment,\nbut have patience and I will be clear presently (p. 427).\nThe reference to Wallace and Williams is unintelligible. My\ncousin's initials should be \"R. H.\" instead of \"H. H.\" My cousin\nwas very much interested in my brother Robert Hyslop, for reasons\nthat are too personal to explain, and which are connected with this\nbrother's conduct. He gave his name as Robert rightly, and then\nrefers to him as he was usually called in the family, namely, as Rob.\nAfter an allusion to his being dazed he referred to a foot that was\ninjured on the railroad, and connected it with my brother Robert\n(p. 428). This was false, and I intimated as much. A little later he\nconnected the same accident with the name \" Will,\" which is the name\n\f9G [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nof another brother of mine. This was false again, but I did not\nintimate the fact. But at this point G. P. suddenly appeared and said\nthat Imperator had sent him. I was then asked a question by my\ncousin that might imply from the context preceding that the accident\nwas connected with George, the name of my brother again, though it is\nalso the name of his own son. But the reference of the accident to\neither of them would be false. It would apply to my \" uncle Charles \"\n(Carruthers). The narrative continues :\u2014\n\" James, was it George I have been trying to think . . . where\nis . . . and do you remember Peter who was ... or belonged to\nNanie. (S. : I do not recall Peter now, but I remember some one by that\nname) here. (S : I do not know whether he is there or not. Is he on your\nside ?) Yes, we say yes. I am W. H. McAJlen [?]. The name does not\nsound right to us friend. It is he says Mc .... sounds like Mclellen.\nG. P. : Yes, I am he.\" (S. : Yes, I am very glad to hear from you. What\nrelation are you to me ?) Your cousin. (S. : That's right.) \" After another\nremark or two my next question was : \" Do you remember what I was doing\nwhen you saw me last 1 \" And the reply was : \" Yes, you were writing,\nteaching, I believe. (S. : Don't you remember a meeting in which ] spoke ?)\n[Much excitement.] \" Oh yes, oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. But I could not\nexactly remember just what it was. (R. H. calm) but I could not exactly\nremember juatwhat it was. And have you any knowledge of Merritt.\" He\nthen disappeared (p. 428).\nHis name was not quite right, but it finally comes very nearly right ;\nG. P.'s statement was correct enough for all evidential purposes. He was\nalso right in general as to what I was doing when I last saw him, which\nwas at the time of my father's death. He it was that arranged for a\nmeeting which I addressed on the issues of the last presidential campaign,\nand though the recollection of it was not suggested by my question,\nhis recognition of it when I mentioned it was very characteristic. He\nalways expressed himself in precisely this manner and language\nwhen something was recalled to his memory that he had forgotten.\nHis wife remarked the fact to me spontaneously when she saw the\nrecord. But the name Peter, and its connection with \" Nanie \" and\nits possible connection with George had no meaning to me. In the\nsitting for June 1st, however, my sister Annie communicated for\nthis cousin as an intermediary and asked : \" What is meant by\nPeter? Was it the dog George had?\" I saw by this that the\nGeorge evidently referred to his own son, the older, and whose\nname is George. When West, I inquired first of the younger son,\nJamie, whether his brother George ever had a dog by the name of\nPeter, and was answered in the negative, and on his expressing\ncuriosity to his mother behind my back as to what I could mean by\nasking such a question, my cousin overheard his motlu r seriously say\nthat it was true. She told me the next day that it was a little ugly\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 97\nblack dog that George had when he was between two and four. George\nhimself did not remember it when I asked him some days afterward in\nanother city, but he did recall another dog that he had when he was\nbetween five and six. Further correspondence with the mother showed\nthat they were both right, as he had had the two dogs. I knew\nnothing of the fact, and my note shows (p. 515) that there is nothing\nto make this judgment improbable. My sister can be supposed to\nhave gotten the information about the dog from my cousin Robert\nMcClellan. My cousin has a living sister Nannie, but she remembers\nnothing of the dog, and the reference to \" Nanie \" remains unin\ntelligible. I could also find no meaning among my connections in the\nreference to Merritt.\nLater in the same sitting my father (p. 433) alluded to him as\n\" Robert cousin,\" and as having mentioned my brother Robert, and\nfoiled my father's desire to do that himself. On May 31st (p. 438)\nthere was a communication, apparently about a John McClellan whom\nI never knew, and it terminated with a communication apparently\nfrom my cousin Robert McClellan, who asked the pertinent question ;\n\"Do you know where Frank Hyslop is?\" as he was interested in my\nbrother on account of the latter's bad health. Supposing, as I did,\nat the outset, that I was communicating with this John McClellan,\na stranger to me, I asked where he knew Frank Hyslop, and got\nthe correct answer\u2014for my cousin : \" Well, of course I know him and\nall of my cousins. Why shouldn't I, James.\" The pertinence of the\nnames Hathaway and Williams is explained in my notes (see Note 94,\np. 535). All that he said about my brother, namely, that he was going\nto be a doctor was false. He was correct in saying that his own wife\nwas on this side (p. 440). Later he gave a clearer message. He tried\nto continue for a moment, but had to be told (p. 442) by Rector\nto \"go out and come in again with the message.\" Rector then\nsaid that he had said something about \" Lucy,\" which was in fact\nthe name of his wife still living (cf. pp. 421, 452). A very complex\npassage followed, which I shall unravel in the more elaborate discus\nsion of mistakes and confusion. (Cf. pp. 231-235.) He gave the\nChristian names and relationships of several persons, though in so\nconfused a manner that I shall not duplicate the later explanation\nof it.\nAfter this my cousin did not appear again personally until the\nsitting of June 6th. But in the sitting for June 1st my sister Annie\ngave the names \" Jennie and Lucy \" together, and said that this\nLucy was on this side, which was true (p. 442). I knew nothing\nwhatsoever of \" Jennie,\" but found by inquiry in the West that she\nwas the sister of my cousin's wife Lucy. I had never known her. She\nis still living. In the sitting for June 5th my brother tried to give\nH\n\f98 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph D.\na name which was in reality that of this cousin's wife, and came nearly\ndoing it. The message was :\u2014\u25a0\nBut he [father] often speaks of Lucy. (S. : Yes, can you finish that\nname Lucy? L U C I N ... LUCY .. . who ** [undec.] Mother,\nmother ...

Annie .... will help me for\na moment. I do not think it is wise, will return again when I can speak\nlouder. 1 am not confused, am I ? (S. : I think not, but what relation was\nshe to me ?) Well, I got it all but the Hyslop. (S. : Was she very close to\nme ?) [Hand shakes slightly to indicate not understanding.] Say that again.\n(S. : Was she very close to me when she was living ?) [My question was put\nin this form (c\/. p. 309) to see if he had in mind my twin sister, Luella,\nthough I felt it was intended for my cousin's wife.] Yes, very, and would\nhave remained so, but not a sister, nor a cousin, nor an aunt, James, but it\nis on my mind, and I would like to tell you all I can about her, but I am a\nlittle weaker just now (p. 464.).\nBut as Mrs. Piper was coming out of the trance she gave the name\nin full. \"Tell Hyslop. Lucy . . . Lucy . . . McClellan\"\n(p. 466).\nI, of course, knew what the name meant as soon as it was mentioned\nthe first time (p. 421), but I wanted to see it completed, especially as\nmy cousin himself was so confused in his messages. The believer in\ntelepathy may note the interesting mistake of Rector in thinking that\nmy brother Charles ought to have said Lucy Hyslop. There was no\nLucy Hyslop and I was thinking all the while of Lucy McClellan\nuntil Hector said \" Hyslop.\" There was some confusion after this\npossibly due to my question about my twin sister, as the reply shows,\napparently implying that this Lucy is on the \" other side,\" which\nis not the fact. The first part of the answer, \"Yes, very, and would\nhave remained so\" can apply to my twin sister Luella that I had\nin mind, but the latter part fits Lucy McClellan, who was neither a\nsister nor aunt, and was a cousin only by marriage. It is possible,\nthat, because of this confusion and Rector's discovery of his mistake,\na special effort was made to give the name as Mrs. Piper returned\nto consciousness, and the effort succeeded. (For similar cases of\nsuccess as Mrs. Piper returns to consciousness compare Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., pp. 305-6, 310 and 372). At the next sitting, June\n6th, my cousin appeared near the beginning of it, and gave me the\nfollowing message which was unintelligible to me at the time, except\nthe allusion to Lucy.\n\" Is James Hyslop here ; if so, give him my love and say it is as I would\nhave it, and I shall always feel as I did before ho went away. I want very\nmuch to say something to him, but how can I ? [Pause.] I want to return\nas soon as possible and free my mind. I have much to talk over with him.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 99\nMy name I gave to Mr. Clarke, and told him to say I was here. LU C Y (?)\n(S. to R. H. : What's that?) LUCY. Where is the book of poems?\nAsk him if he knows what I am thinking about ? \" His place was then\ntaken by my father (p. 469).\nI found on investigation in the West that my cousin's sister Nannie\nhad given him, and read to him very frequently during his last illness,\na lxiok entitled, \" Morning Thoughts,\" every chapter of which closed\nwith a poem, usually of some length. Taken altogether, his communi\ncations are neither clear nor rich in evidential material. Without the\nmass of evidence in the messages of my father, these of my cousin\nwould perhaps not carry much weight alone, though my experiments on\nthe Identification of Personality (pp. 537-623) show that we are\nentitled to give them some value, even independently of the better\nresults of my father. For we saw in those imitative experiments how\nlittle evidence is necessary to correct identification of a communicator.\nIf telepathy he once excluded, therefore, the spiritistic theory could\neasily triumph. The evidence for identity may remain the same on the\ntelepathic hypothesis. Some of the best incidents eliminating acquisi\ntion from my memory are found in the messages pertaining to my\ncousin. They are the dog Peter, the connection of Jennie with Lucy,\npossibly the book of poems, and more remotely the \" aunt Nannie,\"\napplicable to his sister. Had he been as good as my father, the\nrecord would in all probability have been full of incidents transcend\ning my mind. As it is, the confusion which he shows illustrates again\nthe remark made of my uncle's messages, that on the telepathic hypo\nthesis there ought to be no such differences between communicators\nwhen the data of my mind are the same for all, and were plentiful\nenough regarding my cousin to have expected, on that theory, many\nmore and clearer communications.\nRecapitulation.\nSomewhat as in the case of my uncle Carruthers, the statements\nthat came directly from this cousin gain much of their significance\nfrom the information offered by other communicators. Thus he prac\ntically succeeded in telling me he was my cousin McClellan, but\nhis first name, Robert, was supplied later by my father. Again he\nmentioned Lucy, but the name McClellan in connection with it was\ngiven by Mrs. Piper's returning consciousness as the trance was over.\nSo also it was my sister's inquiry about the dog Peter that gave\nsignificance to his vague expressions on this point. It is worth\nnoticing that only in the group of associations likely to be immediately\nand primarily stimulated by my presence were the facts approximately\nclear. These were his name and relationship to myself, the \" Hyslop\nboys \" and my father, calling him \" uncle Hyslop,\" and his particular\n\f100 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ninquiries after my brothers Rob Hyslop and Frank Hyslop. Attempts\nto get beyond this apparently resulted only in vague or erroneous\nstatements, as when he said that my brother Frank or one of my\nother brothers intended to be a doctor, and that my brother Robert or\nWill had met with an accident on the railway. Although the small\ngroup of facts which I have mentioned indicates clearly enough what\nperson is concerned as communicator, there is perhaps scarcely anything\ncharacteristic of him except the repeated phrase, \" Oh yes, Oh yes.\"\nStatements oj my brother Charles.\nThis brother died, as already remarked, in 1864, when he was but\nfour and a half years old. I have mentioned above the incidents which\nhe gave in the first sitting to indicate his identity, and shall repeat\nthem briefly. But the chief interest that attaches to them generally\nis also the same as that of my sister's, namely, their power to suggest\ndifficulties in the theory of telepathy. Many of them do not profess\nto be personal experiences of his own, but were avowedly those of the\npersons for whom he acted as an intermediary. They show inexpugn-\nably, in all ordinary conceptions of the process, an internal contra\ndiction in the telepathic hypothesis. It is essentially absurd to say\nthat telepathy could not get access to my memory or other living\nconsciousness in terms of association with the person whose identity\nthey are to prove, but can be effected under another name which is\nthat of a pertinent person who never knew the facts. It is simply to\nsay that telepathy can do with one name what it cannot do with\nanother and the right name.\nIt will be recalled that in the first sitting my brother gave his\nname and relationship to ine, and stated that he had had a fever, saving\nimmediately afterward that it was typhoid, which was false ; that\nhe had had a very bad throat, which took him out ; that it was in the\nwinter and that he remembered seeing it snow (p. 310). He also\nreferred in this sitting to my mother's sister, saying that she was\nliving before he passed out and that she had died after my mother.\nThis was true. He said that Mary was the name of my father's sister,\nand Elizabeth that of my mother's. The former was correct, the latter\nshould have been Eliza, as I had to ascertain bv inquiry. But it was\nnot the name of the sister referred to as having passed out after my\nmother. I did not know that my father's sister was named Mary. I,\nheard of her only as Amanda. She died before I was born. In the third\nsitting he responded to my question asked in the first that he had had\nscarlet fever (p. 330). All these incidents were true with the one\nexception mentioned. In the sittings of December 24th and 26th\nthere were some brief and non-evidential communications except one\nincident from this brother (pp. 313-3H, 330).\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trange Phenomena. 101\nOn May 31st, when I was present myself and just after my cousin\nliobert McClellan had been communicating in the first half of the\nsitting, Charles followed with a most interesting set of messages. He\nsaid :\u2014\nJames, I am your brother Charles and I am well and happy. Give my\nlove to the new sister Hettie and tell her I will know her some time. Father\nis . . . often speaks of her. (S. : Father often speaks of her ?) Yes.\nDo you hear? (S. : Yes I hear.) Well, it was Frank who had the pictures\nand father would like you to have them if you are still in the body, James.\nSpeak to me. (S. : Yes, I shall have the pictures, Charles.) He asked me\nto say this for him. His voice troubles him a little when trying to speak.\n(S. : Yes, I understand.) But if you could only see his delight when he\nhears you, I am sure, my dear brother, you would never doubt that he\nstill clings to you. It is his one desire to comfort and help you, but he\nwants you to go home and rest there (p. 440.)\nThe chief interest in this passage is the manner in which he\nspeaks of my sister Hettie. He died in 1864, and she was born in\n1874. He alludes to her, therefore, in precisely the proper way, and\nthe remark that \"father often speaks of her\" is exactly what he should\nsay consistently with the statement about her as a \" new sister.\"\nFather's pictures, which it is said I should have, were left with Frank\nin the sense that he was living with father at the time of his death,\nthough spending the summer at my brother's. It would have been\ntruer, however, to have said that he left them with my stepmother.\nThe hypothetical clause, \" if you are still in the body,\" is very\ncurious. It seems to imply the existence of conditions intermediate\nbetween the present life and the one claimed for himself (Cf. p. 332).\nThe last sentence of my brother's message concerning my father's\n\"desire to comfort and help me\" as a subject of common con\nsciousness beyond, was as characteristic of father in life as it is in\nthese sittings.\nThe next appearance was on June 1st, toward the close of the\nsitting.\nWhat about aunt LUCY? (S. : Aunt Lucy who ?) Charles is\nspeaking this, and he came here quite young. She was related to the other\nmother, wasn't she ? (S. : Do you mean the mother on this side ?) Yes, I\ndo. (S. : Well, can you tell what her other name is ?) John can as he\nknows her very well. Ask him when he gets here, if that is you James.\n(S. : Very well. That is all right ) And what happened to the chimney\nafter I left? Do you not remember? (S. : Yes, I remember it.) And\nwasn't it taken down? (S. : Yes, I think so.) I heard father talking\nabout it to mother some time ago ... I mean the chimney, James.\n(S. : Yes, I remember it well.) Well, all right, 1 am not worrying about it.\nOnly I remember how cold it was before I left (p. 455).\nThe \" aunt Lucy \" is either meaningless or a mistake for my cousin,\nLucy McClellan, and she is not related to my stepmother at all, as she\n\f102 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, PhD.\nis only my cousin by marriage. I can make nothing of the reference to\nJohn, unless it be the John McClellan of previous communications\n(p. 438). He was either the grandfather of Robert McClellan, Lucy\nMcClellan's husband, or the John McClellan of earlier communica\ntions (p. 111).\nBut the allusion to the chimney is very pertinent. There was\na tall unseemly chimney on the kitchen, which was built in 1861.\nIt was blown down in a cyclone in 1884, ami just such an object\nas my father and mother would pick out for my brother to mention\nto me. But we can hardly assume that my brother would recollect\nit, although my mother might well mention it to him, as it was\nbuilt when he was about a year old, and he was four and a half\nwhen he died. This assumption that he might remember it is not\nnecessary, as he here creates an additional complication for telepathy\nby virtually disavowing the fact as one of personal knowledge in\nlife, and represents it as acquired on the \" other side.\" The incident\nitself is well calculated to suggest family connections at least.\nOn June 5th, following father's communication about my brother\nGeorge's guitar, he began a most interesting set of messages :\u2014\nWhat is it . . .

And he has some trouble with his\neye . . . one . . . eyes. Yes, eyes. (S. : Yes, I think that is\nright.) Yes, it surely is right, and I am going to see what I can do to help\nhim. I will do better for you bye and bye. James. Do not get impatient\nwith me. I was all right, and I tried to do right always. Don't you think\nso. (S. : Yes, I do think so.) I want very much to help you to find us all. I\ncould not stay away. We had one other sister, didn't we, or you did.\n(S. : Yes.) I mean you did. (S. : Yes, that is right. Can you tell her\nname ?) Yes, Lida . . . (S. : Yes.) was her name, (S. : Yes, that is\nright.) and father knows more about her than I do, but often tells me\nabout them, and of another one named like her. Li L i z z\nLizzie Li no not exactly,\nbut Eliza . . . . beth . . . Eliza ... I am not not quite sure of\nthis, James \" (p. 462).\nFollowing this came the passage about Lucy which I have quoted\nabove (p. 101).\nThis long communication is full of interesting and evidential points,\nthough not for the communicator himself, except perhaps in one detail,\nthat of the reference to his half-sister. The message starts with an evident\nword on the \"other side,\" as if trying to be sure what he was to say.\nThat he could not remember Hettie is apparent from what I have\nalready said above (p. 101). The correction from stepsister to half-\nsister is interesting, as the latter is the correct form. The names of\nmy brother Frank and uncle James McClellan are correct, and it is also\ncorrect that this brother is still living. He was born three years after\nthe death of my brother Charles. Assuming the \"Dr. Pierce\"\nmentioned to be intended for Dr. J. P. Dice, the statement about his\nbeing a friend of \" uncle Clarke's \" is also true. The allusion to his\nown illness and death cannot be verified, as only father and mother\nwere present when the end came. The reference to father's war\nstories and his leg is very pertinent (Cf. p. 454). My brother died just\nat the close of the civil war in 1864, and, as said above, father was\nprevented from taking part in that strife by an injured spine and leg.\nThe \" ship \" incident cannot be verified, and probably refers to a toy,\nif we allow ourselves any conjectures in this connection. It might be\nsupposed to have reference to some accident, \" turning over \" of a boat,\nin connection with my brothers. But there was no stream of water\nnear us for any enjoyments or accidents of this kind. The name of\nmy brother Robert was correct, but he was not suffering from sore\neyes. My brother Will was suffering from some difficulty with his eyes\nat the time, having gotten poisoned, as supposed, some time previously.\nThe allusion to children, however, is explained by Rector to be an\ninterruption. As my sister Hettie and brothers Frank and Robert were\n\f104 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nmentioned in order, it is possible that during the interruption indicated\nmy brother Charles passed in thought to my brother Will. The state\nment about my other sister and the giving of her name as Lida is\ncorrect. She was six and Charles four and a-half years old when he\ndied, so that father would know more about her than my brother.\nThe other \" named like her \" is evidently my aunt Eliza, the name here\nbeing correct, and subject of frequent mention in this record. My\nsister Lida (Eliza) was named for this aunt.\nThe chief value of this communication lies in the fact that it com\npletely breaks up every principle upon which telepathy can claim a\npoint de repere and method for its acquisitions. There is no principle\nof association in my memory, or that of any living person, by which\nthese incidents could be telepathically obtained in the personality of\nmy brother Charles. The communication is a piece of constructive\nintelligence which gets its unity wholly from the standpoint of real\nspirits. There is every mark of an independent intelligence in the\ntelling of the facts, and an intelligence that never knew some of them\npersonally while living, but has to get them on the \" other side \" in the\nsame way that we should in actual life, namely, by conversation of\nsome kind, as it is actually stated in the messages.\nRecapitulation.\nThe statements coming from this communicator that are apparently\npresented as conscious recollections of his own are, as we might expect\nfrom a boy who died thirty-four years previously at the age of four\nand a-half years, very few. The sorrect statements are that he was\nmy brother Charles, that he had died with a very bad throat of a fever\n(first wrongly described as typhoid, and afterward rightly as scarlet\nfever), that it was winter, and that he rememliered seeing it snow,\nsnow having fallen as a fact at the time of his illness and death, and\nthat he died before his mother. Another statement possibly implied\nthat he had never known me personally, or at least had no remembrance\nof me, yet I was at home with him during his short lifetime (p. 309).\nThe other statements made by Charles apparently depend on infor\nmation received by him on the \"other side.\" Some of them betray an\nobscure and imperfect knowledge of relationships and facts, such as\nmight not improbably arise under the circumstances supposed on the\nspiritistic hypothesis; the reference to aunt Lucy, to Frank and the\npictures, the confusion between my brothers Robert and Will, are\ninstances of this. Beyond his personal remembrances of his earthly\nlife and some facts either indicated before or given by him as an inter\nmediary, perhaps the only significant fresh statements concerned what\nhappened to the chimney, and his reference to his new sister Hettie,\nfirst calling her step-sister, and then immediately and more correctly,\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 105\nhalf-sister, and his statement made at my first sitting that my mother\nhad a sister who was living when he died, and that this sister died\nafter my mother.\nStatements ofmy sister Annie (Anna).\nMy sister Anna died twelve days after my brother Charles, in 1864,\nwith scarlet fever, when nearly three years old. She was commonly\ncalled Annie by the members of the family since my mother's death,\nand possibly often before that event. Only her name appears in my\nsitting of December 23rd, and without the relationship to me. In the\nsitting for December 26th (p. 331) my brother Charles was apparently\nfollowed by my sister Annie, who seems also to have acted as inter\nmediary for one or two statements from my mother. I quote the\npassage where I suppose that her communications begin. \"Mother\n[? brother] ... is here also. (S. : Mother, is that you ?) Yes, we\nare all here. Do you know who Sarah is 1 Anne [Anna ?] (S. : Yes,\nI know who Annie is.) She wants to see you. (S. : Well, I hope we\ncan some day.) She says you dream while she lives, and she sends\nher love to you.\"\nSarah, or Sarah Luella, was the name of my twin sister who died\nwhen she was only a few months old, and who was possibly meant by\nthe \"one who is nearer to you than all the rest of us,\" as mentioned in\nthe sitting of Decemter 23rd (p. 309). The record continues :\u2014\nWhere is brother James? (S. : I am brother James.) How you\nhave changed since I came here. [Cf. fioceedings Vol. XIII., p. 324] Do\nyou remember anything about my hair ? There is something I wish you to\nknow. Do you, if you are my dear brother, recall anything about my hair ?\n(S. : I am not quite certain.) They took a piece of it away. Did you know\nthis ? (S. : I think you are right.) I know I am. I know it well, James.\nAnd I remember a little picture of me taken when I was very young. Who\nhas it now ? I cannot find it and I have thought about it so much. (S. : I\nthink I remember now. Do you remember Aunt Nannie ?) [Excitement in\nhand.] Well, I think I do very well. I was named for her. Has she it ?\n(S. : Yes, she has it.) Give her my love and tell sister Annie tells her . . .\nAnna not Anna but Annie . . . And I am your sister. (S. : Yes, I\nremember you well.) Do you not have anything to say to me. I came here\njust after Charles. (S. : Yes, that is right. I am glad to hear from you.)\nI tried years ago to reach you. I tried years ago through father. Did you\nknow this ? (S. : No, I did not know this.) I did. And if auntie is still\nin the body she will remember this. Here comes father (p. 331).\nThe incident of the lock of hair here implied is correct, though such\nincidents are too common to be evidential. The allusion to the picture\nis also correct, but liable to the same objection as the lock of hair,\nthough the statement that it was \" taken when I was very young \" is\ninteresting for its pertinence as well as its truth. She was not named\n\f106 [part\n.\/. H. Uyslop, Ph.D.\nfor my aunt Nannie. The correction to Anna here is interesting,\nthough re-corrected, especially as it was indicated previously that my\nmother was present, who,- -I learned from my aunt Nannie,\u2014always\nrefused to call her \" Annie,\" as she did not like the Scotch \" Annie\nLaurie,\" the full name of my sister being \"Anna Laura.\" My mother\ninsisted on saying \" Anna.\" The statement that she \" came here,\"\u2014\ndied,\u2014\"just after Charles \" is correct. The rest is unverifiable. No\nexperiences such as are implied in the statement of trying to reach me\nthrough father are remembered in the family.\nOn December 26th my father spoke of my sister Annie (p. 3:52),\nand also on February 16th, in the sitting with Dr. Hodgson (p. 388),\nbut she did not appear again personally until May 29th in my last series.\nOn that date she took father's place for a few moments and said :\u2014\nAnnie ... I want to help father to remember everything because I\nc;ime here first and long ago. Do you hear me, James ? Do you remember\nthe large sled .... the large sled '! (S. : I am not sure.) Sled Sled.\n(S. : Yes, I understand.) Do you know the one I mean. I remember you\nand the Allen boys had it when I was in the body. Do you remember it i\n(S. : No, I do not remember.) Here is father and he is alone again now and\nI will go for a moment (p. 421).\nIt is correct that she \"came here first and long ago.\" But while it\nis true that we had a large sled in the country, there were no Allen\nboys in the neighbourhood. If the \" Allen \" be a mistake for\n\" McClellan \" (pp. 122, 123) it is a possible incident, but it is unverified,\nto say nothing of the surprise it must awaken in our minds when we\nnote that my sister was just two years and ten months old when she\ndied.\nOn May 29th, just at the close of the sitting (p. 425), she asked :\n*' Do you remember how I looked, and the little pansie flowers I pressed\nin one of my books.\" She referred to this again on June 7th, see\nbelow (p. 108).\nOn June 1st she followed father in a most interesting communication.\n\"I see you, James. Iam your sister Annie . . . and I am very glad\nto meet you here. Pa is better now. (S. : Yes, I am vory glad to see you.)\nDo you remember when I came to this life, James? (S. : Yes, I remember\nvery well.) and did you know I did not see you ?

She is on my mind at this moment and I\nwant to send a message to her. (S. : Very well, send.) Do you remember\ngrandmother? (S. : Yes, I remember her well.) Lucy is there and I am\njust thinking of her. Father knows about her better than I do. Yes, I\nhave waited all these years to find you and I helped father when he came\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 107\nhere. I feel it because I do not remember more for you, James, but you\nhave changed also. I had a sister-in-law, so I am trying to think of her.\nWhat is it you call her, James? Tell : do you better not. I will tell you\npretty soon . . . very soon. I am sorry 1 cannot say moro, but I hope\nto some day. What is meant by Peter ? Was it the dog George had !\n(S. : I do not remember.) Can't you ask him ? (S. : Yes, I shall ask him\nabout it.) [Hand indicates fresh arrival] (p. 451).\nThe reference to pressing pansies is probably true. (Cf. p. 425.)\nThe expression \" Pa is better now \" is very pertinent. Every one\nof us without exception always called him \"Pa\" until after 1877, when\nI began to call him \"father,\" as he then lx'gan calling me \"James,\"\ninstead of \" Jimmie.\" Three of the others have always called him,\nand still call him \" Pa,\" and the sister Annie here mentioned never\nknew him by any other expression, though she has in all but this\ninstance used \" father \" in these communications. It would be natural\nthat she should not remember me (if this be what she meant by the\nstatement \" I did not see you \"), as she was a little less than three\nyears old when she died. But she ought to recall me as easily as the\n\"Sled\"! (p. 421). But perhaps the reference more obviously means\nthat she did not see me a't the actual time of her death, though I\nwitnessed it. She very gradually lapsed into unconsciousness. Her\nasking me if I remembered it, her statement that she thought of me a\ngreat deal, and her remark to me afterward that I had changed also\nbear out this interpretation. The broken words \" Corrn,\" etc., are\npossibly an attempt to name my aunt Cornelia, or \"aunt Cora\" as we\nalways called her. She was my mother's sister and my mother was very\naffectionately attached to her. The name Jennie had no meaning to\nme, but I found on investigation that it is the name of the sister of\nthis Lucy McClellan. I never heard of this Jennie before. My sister\nAnnie never knew her, neither did she know Lucy, so that the state\nment that \" father knows about her better than I do \" is true enough.\nThe reference to a \" sister-in-law \" is true, but there are three sisters-in-\nlaw, and this may be a mistake for the half-sister Henrietta or Hettie.\nThe incident of the dog Peter I have already explained as referring to\nthe pet of my cousin George McClellan (p. 515).\nThe same remarks apply to some of the statements that I made in\nreference to the last message of my brother (p. 104). They are the\nwork of an intermediary.\nOn June 7th my sister again appears just after father had tried so\nhard to get the name of my stepmother. She said :\u2014\nHow are you, J*mes ? + [Imperator] sent me to speak a moment while\nfather goes out and returns. I am very glad to be here again. It is I, sister\nAnnie. (S. : Good morning. I am glad to hear you again.) I perhaps can\nhelp you a little, James. I shall be glad if I can. Do you remember\n\f10S [PAUT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nanything about birds ! (S. : Very little.) about anything I did. (S. : Yes,\nI remember only one thing that you did ) Yes, but I remember the birds\nvery well. (S. : I am glad to hear it.) Will you ask auntie if she remem\nbers the one I caught (S. : I shall ask her), and the flowers I pressed.\nWill you ask her for me. (S. : Yes, I shall ask her.) I think it was yellow\nin color . . . Yes, and I had a little pin-holder I made when I was\nin the body. I think she has it now. (S. : I shall ask her.) I hope so.\nHere comes father and I am going now (p. 482).\nNeither the bird nor the pin-holder incident is verifiable, nor have\nthey to me any internal probabilities, considering her age when she\ndied. No one knows anything about the pressing of flowers, though it\nhas some possibilities. (Cf. Note p. 425).\nRecapitulation.\nIn this instance as in the case of in3' brother Charles, there is little\nof the earthly life that we could expect to be remembered by one who\ndied thirty-four years ago when she was less than three years old, and\nit is not very clear which incidents are to be regarded as her own\nconscious recollections and which as related to her by others. Her\ncorrect statements were that she was my sister Annie, giving also the\nname Anna (perhaps an interpolation by my mother), that she died\nlong ago just after Charles, that a piece of her hair was taken away,\nthat a little picture of her was taken when she was very young, and\nher reference to Sarah. Her use of the word Pa, the only instance in\nthe record, was characteristic and is specially noteworthy. But the\nstatement that she was named after aunt Nannie was a mistake. Her\nreference tj the Allen boys, the pressing of flowers, the pinholder, the\nbirds and her catching of one, her not seeing me when she died, and\nthe attempt through father to \" reach me \" after her death cannot be\nverified. Other statements from her and perhaps some of the incidents\njust mentioned apparently depend on information obtained on the\n\" other side.\" The most important of them were the name Jennie in\nconnection with Lucy and the specific reference to Peter as the dog\nwhich George had.\nStatements of my uncle, James McClellan.\nJames McClellan was my uncle; he married my father's sister for\nhis first wife, and my mother's sister for his second wife. He died in\n1^70 during the winter. His own direct communications were very\nclear, but he appeared only twice. His son Robert tried more\nfrequently, but, as we have seen, was not a good communicator. Just\nat the close of the sitting on May 31st (p. 445), James McClellan and\nJames Carruthers apparently were both present. There was some\nconfusion at first, at least in my mind, as to who was speaking:\u2014\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 109\n\"Yes, and . . . yes there were two James and do you remember an\nuncle? (S. : Yes, I remember, and uncle James . what?) Well, it\nis he. (S. : Which uncle James ?) H James Mc.\" I saw who\nwas meant by this and did not press for any clearer statement. I simply\nreplied, \" Yes, that is right.\" He continued : \" and a cousin John. Don't\nyou remember us both ? (S. : I am not sure of cousin John.) Well, I will\ntell you more about myself later, and we will perhaps understand each other\n, . . my sister Ann is here with . . . yes [?] Ann. Going.\"\nI found on inquiry that he had a sister Mary Ann, and then\ndiscovered that while at college I had known this sister as Mrs. Mary\nMitchell. It was new to me that her name had Ann in it. My first\ninformation of her death, so far as I am aware, was received in the\n,above statements. (Cf. group of names p. 443 and Note 56, p. 510).\nOn June 1st father remarked on returning from a respite, \" I in\ntended to clear up about James and John Mclellen before I left\" (p.\n450). On June 5th my brother Charles asked ine if I remembered my\nuncle James McClellan (p. 463). At the sitting of June 6th, imme\ndiately after my father had answered my request to tell me something\nthat had occurred before I was born, this uncle appeared personally,\nand gave one of the finest set of pertinent and evidential incidents in\nthe record.\nI am here once more. I am James McLellan, if you wish to know and\nyou are my namesake. (S. : Yes, I remember you and that I am your\nnamesake.) Yes, all right. We cannot quarrel about that, can we,\nJames, but I despised the name of Jim. (S. : Very well, I understand.)\nWhat is it you want to know about Frank, or was it John who wanted to\nknow ? (S. : There was some confusion when Frank was mentioned, and\nalso when John was mentioned. Who is this cousin John that was mentioned\nbefore ? ) It was not cousin, that was a mistake. (S. : Yes. Is he in the\nbody or is he in the spirit ? ) He is here, and [Hand dissents violently.] 1\nintend to straighten this out, but the light went out and I could not remain\nthere. He is a brother . . . yes, all right . . . and he will be\nhere soon. But it is still not straight. Wait and I will explain. You\nremember brother John very well, you must if you are James. (S. : Yes,\nI remember him well.) He was the one who went to war. (S. : Very\nwell. Go on.) Let me see. Well perhaps you remember father, do you\nnot ? (S. : Do you mean your father ?) Yes. (S. : Is this my uncle James\nMcClellan?) Yes. (S. : No, I do not remember your father.) Well, he\nwas John. (S. : Very well.) John James McClellan. [James written first.\nJohn written in front of James, then McClellan written after.] (R. H. :\nJames John McClellan ?) No. John James McClellan. (S. : Very well. 1\nunderstand, and shall inquire about it.) Well, go ahead and inquire. I\nthink I know. (S. : Well, all right. Please tell me anything you wish to\ntell.) I wanted to tell you about his going to the war, and about one of his\nfingers being gone before he came here. (S. : Very well, go on, please. I\nunderstand.) And he had a brother David, who had a S U N stroke. (S. :\nI understand. That is perfectly new to me. I never heard it before, and it\n\f110 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\npleases me very much to learn this fact.) Well, he never was well after he\nreceived it until he came here. Then one more I wanted to speak of was-\nNANCY, but I cannot tell you any more now. (S. : Very good. Thank\nyou very much. Rest now.) Be brave, upright, honourable, do the best\nyou can and don't forget your uncle James Mc. Good-bye. (S. : Good-bye,\nuncle, for the present.) * * * [undec. James or yourt.] James\nMcLellan (pp. 470-472).\nNow the facts as I have verified them are these : I was his name\nsake. I suspected from the statement about his despising \" the name\n\u25a0Hin\" that this might be the reason we alwavs called him \"uncle\nMack.\" I asked his two remaining daughters if the statement was\ntrue, and one did not rememlx-r it, but the other did recall it at once,\nand told me of several instances in which both he and his wife had\ncomplained of his being called Jim. His father's name was John. If\nthe James was intended as a part of the father's name it is an error.\nI never knew or heard of him, so far as I can recall, though I was\nthirteen years old when he died in 1867, and I may, therefore,\nonce have known something about him. Also the name of my\nuncle's brother is John, and him I know well. He is still\nliving, and in his ninetieth year, so that the prediction that he\nwill die soon must evidently turn out true. (Gf. Fix)tnote, p. 471).\nIt was a very pertinent statement to make that I must remember\nthis John well, as I was at the college of which he was the treasurer,\nand my uncle James died while I was in my junior year. It\nis interesting to remark the mistake, and what appears to be the\nimmediate spontaneous correction of it, in the statement about the\nwar. First he said it was his brother, and then altered this to his\nfather. It is important to note that the other references in the passage\nwhich I have quoted specially concern this father, and it may be\npossible that my uncle James McClellan picked out the incidents\nreferred to for the express purpose of giving me tests upon matters\nunknown to me. I found, as a matter of fact, that James McClellan's\nbrother John had not been in any war, neither had bis father. But\nanother John McClellan was commissioned as an ensign on July 15th\nin 1810 for the war of 1812.i I found the corroboration of the\nstatement in the history of Greene County, Ohio, where this other\nJohn McClellan lived. It is only stated that he was commissioned as\nan ensign as stated above. No further facts are given. I could get\nno confirmation about the lost finger in reference to my uncle's\nfather, but it was true, it appears, of the other John McClellan\ni My latest notes on the incident of John McClellan's part in the war of 1812\ninvolve a correction of some things said in Harper's Mayazinc (Vol. CI., p. i'7), and\nin the New York Independent (Vol. LII., p. 750). Note !)4 (p. 535) explains this fully.\n\fxLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. Ill\n(p. 113). I found also that he had no brother David, but he had a\nbrother-in-law, David Elder, who had a slight sunstroke just after the\nCivil War, somewhere about 1867, according to the testimony of one of\nMr. Elder's living sons, though the other does not recall it. I had very\ngreat difficulty in finding the persons to confirm this fact.i\nNancy was the name of the sister of this David Elder and of the\nwife of old John McClellan. It is to be noted that she was mentioned\nin immediate proximity to the name of her brother David. She was,\nof course, the mother of my uncle James McClellan, the communicator.\nI have no more conscious recollection of her than of old John\nMcClellan.\nAbout half of the incidents mentioned by this communicator were\nunknown to me. His correct statements on matters known to me\nwere that he was my uncle James McClellan, and that I was his name\nsake. Mistakes or confusions were illustrated in an earlier reference to\nJohn as a cousin instead of a brother (p. 445), though this was\ncorrected later (p. 471) ; in saying that this brother had been in the\nwar and correcting it to his father, both being false ; in saying that\nhis father had lost a finger ; and perhaps in giving this father's name\nas John James instead of merely John. The other John McClellan\nhad been in the war and had lost a finger (Note 94, p. 534). The other\nstatements, all substantially correct, concerned his sister Ann and the\nfact that she was dead, his despising the name Jim, his father's brother\n(for brother-in-law) David, and the sunstroke, and the reference to\nNancy, the name of his mother.\nJohn McClellan.\nOn May 29th (p. 421), and in close connection with the allusion\nto the Cooper incident, father said : \" And do you remember John ?\ni It was only after the most prolonged inquiry that I obtained the verification\nof the most important incidents. I think it is worth while to indicate to the reader\nthe difficulties that I found in ascertaining the facta about David Elder's sunstroke.\nTwo of the living sons denied that their father had any brother David. This was\nstrictly correct, but it was interesting to observe that they did not recall an uncle by\nthat name who was their father's brother-in-laiv. The third son at first denied it,\nand then suddenly recalled his uncle David, naming him as Elder. But he did not\nknow where he had lived and could not aid me in finding out anything more than the\nname. I wrote to the younger brother telling him that I had found an uncle David\nElder, and be then recalled him, but did not know what had become of him, nor\nwhere he had lived. He referred me, however, to his cousin, the daughter of this\nDavid Elder, giving her name and address. I wrote to her and received a reply from\nher daughter, saying that her mother had been dead two years\u2014a fact not known or\nremembered apparently by her cousin to whom I wrote. Through this daughter of\nDavid Elder's sister I obtained the names and addresses of two of her uncles, sons of\nDavid Elder. They were living in the State of Iowa, and from them I ascertained\nthat David Elder, their father, had lived many years in that State and had died there\nin 1885.\n\f112 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop,Ph.D.\nHe has just come to greet you for a moment.\" The connection of this\nname with that of Cooper, as a note shows, led me to mistake the\nimport of this \" John.\" I can even now only conjecture from later\nmessages its possibilities. On May 30th (p. 427), my cousin, Robert\nMcClellan alluded to the \"Williams boys,\" about whom I knew\nnothing. But on May 31st (p. 438), at the close of father's first\ncommunication, he said : \" Here comes John and Hathaway, and he\nis with him here.\" Immediately following this is a communication\npurporting apparently to come from this John, followed by communi\ncations from my cousin Robert McClellan. Later incidents indicate'\nthat this John was meant for John McClellan, who was not a relative\nof my cousin. But the communication was : \u2014\n\" Yes, is James here ? Ask him what can I do for yim, my boy. I am\nback, and I feel much freer than I have before. I just waited to clear the\nway, and there is a young man here who is very kind to me. Do you\nremember yet about Williams ? (S. : What Williams is it ?) He is Frank.\nHere apparently my father interrupts with the statement : John is anxious\nto know. Speak, James.\" The communications continue. \"(S. : I do not\nremember Frank Williams, but tell me more about him, and I may recall\nhim.) He had two or three boys, sons, they were Arthur, Fred, and Irvin.\nYou must remember it seems. I am not quite sure that you hear all I say,\nbut take out as much as you hear. (S. : Yes, I hear it all clearly.) You\nmay have to find out about them if you do not remember them. (S. : Yes.\nI shall try if you tell me where they lived on earth.) They lived not far\nfrom me in Ohio, and I remember Frank very well. (S. : Did Nannie know\nthem ?) She must have heard about them. (S. : What kind of work did\nthey do ?) Frank was at the library, and sent the books over to me just\nbefore I left.\" At this point my cousin, began his communications with\nthe question: \"Do you know where Frank Hyslop is?\" apparently\ninstigated thereto by the name \"Frank\" (p. 438).\nNo further personal communications came from this John McClellan\nso far as I can determine. But on May 30th (p. 445) the name\n\"John\" and then \" Mc John\" were connected with a confused\nmessage apparently from my brother Charles, who was followed by father.\nThat a John McClellan was meant by the name was immediately\nindicated by the statement that \" there are two of the Mclellen over\nhere.\" Then on June 1st father said (p. 448) : \"I intended to refer\nto uncle John, but I was somewhat dazed, James.\" (Cf. Footnote\npp. 472-473.) A little later father said again : \"I intended to clear\nup about James and John McClellan before I left \" (p. 450).\nThere seems to have been some consciousness of confusion which it\nwas desired to clear up in connection with the name of John McClellan,\nas if I was in danger of misunderstanding the relevance of the com\nmunications. And we have seen above (p. 110) in the communication\nof James McClellan that there was some confusion between his own\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 113\nfather and the other John McClellan, who had been in the war of 1812\nand had lost a finger. The sequel showed that the apprehension of the\ncommunicators was justified. For the identification of this old John\nMcClellan and the discovery of the pertinence of the names and\nincidents in connection with him gave me much trouble (See Note 94,\np. 535). I found that the facts did not fit the father of my uncle\nJames McClellan. But having ascertained that there was another\nJohn McClellan who also lived in Ohio within a few miles of my uncle's\nfather, I set to work to learn whether the names and incidents in\nthese communications in any respect applied to him, and I found that\nhe had been in the war of 1812, that he had lost a finger, probably\nin that war, that Hathaway was his son-in-law's cousin, and that he\nwas himself probably connected with a Williams family, though this\nwas possibly as far back as 1825 or earlier. He was familiarly called\n\" old uncle John.\" This is of dubious importance (Footnote p. 472).\nNothing could be learned about the sons of Frank Williams, Fred,\nArthur, and Irvin. The reader may compare this with Professor Lodge's\nincident. (Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 527, 555-557).\nStatements of other Communicators.\nI may here add a few words concerning the trance personalities and\nGeorge Pelham (G.P.), who was the chief subject of Dr. Hodgson's last\nreport. G.P., as we have seen, acted sometimes as an intermediary for\nmy relatives, but sent a few messages pertinent to Dr. Hodgson. One\nincident in connection with myself I have already mentioned elsewhere.\nThis was the giving of the name of his brother Charles on June 7th\n(p. 486) in response to my statement that I knew his brother in\nColumbia University.\nBy the \" trance personalities \" I mean Imperator, Rector, Doctor\nand Prudens. Their own communications are\u2014the bulk of them\u2014at\nthe beginning and the end of the sittings, and consist mostly of\nconversation with Dr. Hodgson about arrangements for sittings, and\nof advice and prayers for ourselves. They have no evidential value for\npersonal identity, the main problem of my report, whatever they may\nbe supposed to have for independent intelligence. Hence they can be\nstudied by the reader himself without comment from me. Once we\nwere reproved by Rector for eating too fast, and the rebuke seems to\nhave been merited (p. 437). At the last sitting, June 8th, they under\ntook to give me a physical diagnosis, which was correct, and specially so\nin regard to the weak point in my constitution, saying that it was my\nstomach. They also gave me a course of diet which is unquestionably\ngood, and they showed by their absolute prohibition of all alcoholic\ndrinks that they would make good teetotalers or Prohibitionists. Their\nmoral and religious maxims of advice were all that could be expected\nof their type, and are exceptionally lofty.\nI\n\f114 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nIn fact the religious type of character exhibited by them is a most\ninteresting feature of the whole regime, and it seems to me quite\nappropriate to collect here some of the prayers and benedictions that\nwere offered at the sittings by these trance personalities in the form of\nautomatic writing. I hardly need remind the reader of the moral and\nspiritual character of these personalities that claim to supervise the\ncommunications, but it forms one element, if only a small one, in my\nestimate of the problem. In quoting the prayers I shall not include\nthe repetitions due to our inability to decipher, etc. It appears that\nthe prayers are probably offered by Imperator, but he does not always\nact as the amanuensis in the writing of them. Rector often directs\nthe writing as the amanuensis, the indication that both are parties to\nit being found in the sign of the cross or Imperator's name and the\nsignature of Rector.\nAt the close of the sitting of December 27th a sort of admonitory\nprayer, followed by a benediction, was offered. It was :\u2014\n\" Fear not. God is ever Thy guide, and He will never fail thee. We\ncease now, and may His blessings rest on thee \" (p. 344).\nOn February 7th, at Dr. Hodgson's sitting in my behalf, at the\nend there came :\u2014\n\" May God in His tenderest Mercy lead thee into light and joy, and may\nHis blessings rest on thee \" (p. 375).\nOn February 8th also at Dr. Hodgson's sitting in my behalf, and\nnear the beginning, Imperator acted as his own amanuensis and\nwrote :\u2014\u25a0\n\" Holy Father, we are with Thee in all Thy ways, and to Thee we come\nin all things. We ask Thee to give us Thy tender love and care. Bestow\nThy blessings upon this Thy fellow creature, and help him to be all that\nthou dost ask. Teach him to walk in the paths of righteousness and truth.\nHe needs Thy loving care in all things. Teach him to do Thy holy will, and\nwe leave all else in Thy hands. Without Thy care we are indeed bereft.\nWatch over and guide his footsteps and lead him into truth and light.\nFather we beseech Thee to so open the blinded eyes of mortals that they\nmay know more of Thee and Thy tender love and care \" (p. 375).\nAt the sitting of June 5th at which I was present, and near the\nend, there came :\u2014\n\"Oh, God, thou allwise Father, give us more light on the returning of\nthe light, and ere we return to earth * * * [undec.] we may be able to\nhear distinctly and clearly the voices of Thy Messengers and all returning\nfriends. We beseech Thee, Oh Father, to render us thy help in all our\nundertakings. Faileth Thy help we are indeed bereft. Merciful Father,\nOh Thou Allwise Merciful God, give us help and light \" (p. 466).\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 115\nThen on June 7th near the beginning came :\u2014\n\" Oh, Holy Father, Thou Divine Being, maker of heaven and earth, we\nbeseech Thee this day to send light unto Thy fellow beings. Keep them,\noh Father, in the paths of righteousness and virtue. Lead them to know\nmore of Thee and Thy wondrous workings for the redemption of their own\nsouls. We ask for no more, but leave all else to Thee \" (p. 477).\nStatistical Summary.1\nIt will aid in a clear conception of the facts in the communications\nif we give such a statistical summary of them as is possible. This\ncannot be done in the same manner that facts and events of the same\nkind usually can be classified, but they can be grouped in a way\nsuitable to a rough comparison, that will supply the relative number of\ntrue and false incidents with which we have to reckon in making up\nour conclusions in the case.\n. The basis of classification that has been adopted rests upon the\ndistinction between the true, the false, the indeterminate, and the\nmixed incidents. An incident in the classification does not mean\nmerely some name or isolated fact, but may include a number of facts\ncapable of being independent of each other in the course of events.\nHence I have distinguished between an incident and the number of\nfactors that may constitute it. An incident may be any name, con\nception, or combination of conceptions making a single possible and\nindependent fact, or it may be any combination of possibly independent\nfacts constituting some fact that was a single whole in the mind of the\ncommunicator. I shall illustrate what I mean by both applications of\nthe term. A single proper name may be called an \" incident \" of one\nfactor ; so may any proposition indicating some single fact. Or an\n\" incident \" may be such a statement as that \" my Aunt Susan visited\nmy brother.\" Here there are four factors in the single \" incident,\" that\nare not necessarily connected with each other. There is nothing in the\nuse of the name \" aunt \" to suggest the name \" Susan.\" nor in both of\nthem to suggest ta any one either the idea of a visit or that the visit\nwas paid to a brother. There are any number of possibilities in the\ncombination of ideas with either the concepts \" aunt \" or \" Susan.\"\nHence this can be treated as one of the synthetic incidents, as I call\nsuch cases in the discussion of certain problems. Or, again, to say\ni Further inquiries made after this statistical summary was drawn up resulted in\nshowing that some incidents which I had set down as true were false ; that some\nincidents which I had set down as false were true ; and that some incidents which I\nhad set down as indeterminate were true. As the work of tabulating the incidents\nwas a very laborious one, and as the result of further inquiry had improved the\nevidence on the whole, I have not revised the summary, but have preferred to leave\nit in the form most unfavourable to the spiritistic theory.\nI 2\n\f116 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthat \" my uncle hurt his foot on the railway \" would be to give one\nincident with three factors in it. But I have also chosen to charac\nterise by the same term a class of communications which, though they\ndid not represent a synthetic and single whole in the actual life of the\ncommunicator, yet seem to have that kind of mental unity in the\ncommunicator's mind which allows them to be spoken of as a whole\nwith a number of factors. The line is not easily drawn between the\nsynthetic event which was an actual fact in the life of the com\nmunicator and one that is the creation of his mind at the time of the\nmessage. For certain purposes in the argument it does not make any\ndifference whether we distinguish between them or not, while also the\nfactors retain all their value whether so connected or not. I have also\noften classified as \"incidents\" a series of communications which,\nthough they do not represent any single event in life when taken\ntogether, yet represent a natural group of facts in one continued\nmessage. The main line distinguishing between the facts classed in\none incident and those in another will be either the distinctly synthetic\ncharacter of one as compared with another, or sufficient interruption\nand separation in the messages to justify speaking of two incidents\ninstead of one. But the factors represent, as indicated, those facts,\nnames, actions, or events that do not necessarily suggest each other, or\nare not necessarily suggested by any given name or fact. This analysis\nof a communication enables us to see more clearly how difficult it is\nto explain any complex circumstances by an easy theory. It is an\nimportant question in the consideration of chance, where we have to\nsuppose that the brain of the medium has no clue to follow, either\nbefore any correct start has been obtained, or after it. It will be an\nimportant problem to determine how the unity of consciousness\ninvolved in such cases can be produced without some resort to intelli\ngence, whether supernormal or not.\nThe table in which the facts are summarised does not classify them\nwith reference to their value, evidential or otherwise, but only with\nreference to their truth or falsity. Facts, names, or events, with\nout any evidential value, may be classed with those having this quality\nin a very high degree. This must be kept in mind when examining the\ntable, as I do not mean to make the case appear any stronger from the\nmere force of figures, though in estimating the relation of the pheno\nmena to chance we may safely rely upon this circumstance. I have\noften been asked what proportion of truth to error is found in the\nrecord, and I could not answer this query any other way than by\nmaking the comparison which the table gives, but this must not be\ninterpreted as implying that all the facts have the same evidential\nvalue. The truth is that there are many true incidents that are far\nfrom evidential at all, but they are nevertheless true and capable of\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 117\ngeneral comparison with the false. Also I should add that the\nclassification does not include mere repetitions.\nThe rules which have governed this classification should be indi\ncated. I have classed as false one incident with seven factors because\nit is wholly inapplicable to my family, and so false in that relation,\nthough it might represent a true set of facts capable of proving identity\nto the parties concerned. It has been the same with some other cases\nclassed as false. For instance, certain incidents that might be attributed\nto mistakes of memory, such as those to which we are all liable, have\nbeen classed as false, and thus appear to have the negative value that\nsuggests difficulties, but as false incidents they are very different in\ntype from those that even suggest the truth that they fail to state.\nSimilarly I might have treated certain incidents due to confusion of\nthe communicator at the time. In this it will be apparent that the\nnumber of wholly false incidents might be considerably reduced, but I\nhave not allowed myself any rights in this matter, but have judged\nof the case strictly, leaving to explanations of this kind the modifica\ntion which is due the incidents. The false thus obtains, when it does\nnot represent a mistake, some of the possible characteristics of the\nindeterminate, but the true cases have their whole meaning determined\nby their relation to the sitter. Whatever apology, however, is possible\nfor the false as here represented, nevertheless it must have all the\nnegative force of total error when measured against the true.\nThe class of indeterminate incident contains two types. First,\nthere is that class which represents facts purporting to be events in the\nearthly life of the communicator, which I could not verify, though they\nare possible or even probable ; for example, my father's reference to the\nbroken wheel. The second class contains alleged incidents in the\ntranscendental world which it is impossible to verify, but which repre\nsent statements on the same level as the verifiable ; for instance, my\nbrother Charles' reference to his hearing father and mother talking\nabout the chimney. If rejected altogether they diminish the number\nof indeterminate incidents.\nThe above general explanation will enable the reader to understand\nthe tabular review which follows. For example, to take the second\nsitting out of my first four it is seen, on consulting Table I., that of the\ntrue incidents there were three with one factor each ; one with two\nfactors ; one with three ; three with four each ; one with six, and one\nwith eleven ; no incidents that were false ; one that was indeterminate\nwith three factors, and one mixed incident with nine factors, of which\neight factors were true and one false. The Roman numerals indicate\nthe number of the sitting in each set.\nI must warn the reader that I attach no intrinsic value to this\nstatistical review, but present it only as a concession to the statistically\n\f118 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ninclined person. Its fundamental fault is that it both puts the most\ncomplex incident on the level of the simplest, and conceals the\nevidential importance of all of them in respect of their quality, which\nis far more important than mere quantity alone. The review is a con\nvenient ad hominem argument against those who might wish to appeal\nto chance on the basis of mere number, if we once accept the correct\nness of the classification of the incidents, but it cannot affect any\njudgment that is not enamoured of figures. Perhaps it has the merit\nof affording a sort of bird's-eye view of the number of incidents that\nare synthetic as distinguished from those that are simple, and also some\nconception of the degree of complexity involved. But all this depends\non the criterion for determining the \" single \" incident and the amount\nof complexity, and hence the table must be treated as merely a rough\nattempt to suggest the comparison between the true and false at large\nin the record. This one numerical result may have some value.\nTabi.e I.\u2014First Four Sittings.\nTrue Fai.se INDETEIIM. Mixed\nInc. Fac. Inc. Fac. Inc. Fac. Inc. Fac. True. False.

I have also shown how misleading the class called false is\nfrom the admission of incidents and factors that might be classed with\nthe indeterminate. Similarly the indeterminate could be reduced by\nomitting the incidents having an alleged transcendental occurrence.\nThis would greatly diminish the ratios between them and the true.\nBut it is certainly very interesting to find so small a proportion of\nerrors even when straining the case in their favour. In anything\ngenuine the indeterminate ought to occur, and it is no less interesting\nto find their small ratio in the case. And it is to be specially noted\nthat the indeterminate incidents increase precisely where we should\nexpect the living human memory to be defective. Compare my father's\ncommunications respecting his boyhood (pp. 469-470).\nThe best place to study these classes of incidents is in the\nindividual sittings where the relations between the true, the false,\nand the indeterminate can be seen in their proper proportions. The\ntotal summary has no other value than the comparison of simple and\ncomplex incidents. Thus we find that throughout the whole series of\n\f122 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nexperiments, there are forty-four incidents with but one factor in them.\nSuch cases are more amenable to all sorts of objections than those\nwhich represent a combination of two or more independent factors that\nhave no necessary connection with each other. Hence the summary\nshows the comparative importance of the incidents in so far as the mere\nnumber of factors composing them is concerned. But it does nothing\nmore, while the individual sittings bring us into a clearer comprehension\nof such incidents in detail, and the individual incident when complex\nis still better than groups of them for evidential study, except when\ntaken collectively. But the statistical account affords both a bird's-eye\nview of the numerical relations in the whole and an interesting com\nparison of the separate series of sittings with each other.\nIn looking at them, the most striking fact that meets the attention\nat once is the great number of mixed cases, as compared with the\nwholly false and the indeterminate. Perhaps still more noticeable is\nthe smaller number of factors that are indeterminate in the mixed\nthan those that are false. The whole matter, however, must depend\nupon the criterion used in the classification of incidents as mixed. If\nthe line were drawn differently in some cases, we should increase the\nnumber of wholly true incidents and also the number in the false and\nthe indeterminate. It would not alter the ratio between the true and\nthe false on the whole, but it would alter the appearance of the table.\nBut I tried to define the mixed class as strictly as possible.\nA very interesting fact also is the difference between Dr. Hodgson's\nsittings and my own in respect of incidents of any sort. His fourth\nsitting appears to be absolutely worthless evidentially. I thought the\nfirst three should be included in this judgment until my investigations\nin the West discovered facts that I had previously supposed were false\nor worthless. His last sitting, however, as remarked already, is about\nas good as any of those at which I was present. One is tempted to ask\nthe question whether the presence of someone as sitter who is an inti\nmate friend or relative of the communicator may not qualify the latter\nfor better work, just as some relic is supposed to do this. The question,\nof course, cannot be answered positively. But if the communicator's\npersonal interest in the sitter can improve the messages by influencing\nthe attention, this view is borne out by my last sitting, in which not a\nsingle mixed incident occurs, and also no false ones. Does not this\ncircumstance confirm my supposition as to the source of the difficulty\nin Dr. Hodgson's sittings 1 The affirmative answer to this must be\npurely speculative, and I do not urge it, though it is worth while to\ncall attention to a coincidence which agrees with the fact that in all\nspiritistic phenomena, so-called at least, this peculiar connection between\nthe sitter and the communicator seems to prevail and to affect the\nmessages in the way remarked. But whatever explanation be probable,\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 123\nit is evident that my last sitting, when I deliberately conversed with\nthe communicator in a way that I had refrained from doing before,\ncommanded the communicator's interest and attention, so that I elicited\na clearness in communications which I had not effected before (Cf.\npp. 489-496). Many of the most important and evidential facts in\nthe experiments were obtained at this sitting.\nThere is another most interesting fact to be noticed. As the\nincidents increase in the number of factors composing them, they\ndecrease in their own number. This would be natural perhaps, but\nit coincides in these experiments with the fact that the communicator\ncannot usually remain long in contact with the \"machine,\" and with\nthe fact that the intervals of respite interrupt the narrative in favour\nof beginning new incidents. Hence the most complex incidents seem\nto exhaust a period of communication, while a number of simple ones\ncan be given in the same period. The apparent result would be\naltered, however, if some cases classed as single incidents were broken\nup into several, though their value would not be changed.\nMany of the most important features of the record cannot be\nexpressed at all in this tabular account. They are statements which\nshow the proper appreciation of questions, remarks, or other aspects of\na situation, and also incidents of emotional tone. All that the table\ncan recognise is the number of objective facts stated as such, chiefly,\nof course, concerning the earthly experiences of the communicator.\nMuch other pertinent matter cannot be included, even though it is not\nwithout influence on one's convictions in estimating the whole.\n\f124 [PAKT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nCHAPTER III.\nThe Tei.epathic Hvpothesis.i\nIn taking up the attempts to explain such phenomena, the tele\npathic hypothesis is the first naturally to come under review. This is\nthe case, of course, for all psychical researchers who suppose that other\nobjections to spiritism have been non-suited. The reader will have\nalready learned (p. 16) that I do not intend to consider how far\nsubliminal fraud, fishing and guessing are applicable to this and other\nPiper records. The reasons for adopting this course are various. Some\nof them are implied in later discussions. But the chief reason is that I\ndo not think that such suppositions can be either consistently or\nrationally carried out, even if we make them adjuncts to telepathy. I\nleave to the ingenuity of a priori speculation the combination of\nassumptions necessary to meet the simple hypothesis which I have\npreferred to defend as satisfactory for the present. Hence, with the\nrefusal to consider these, telepathy is the only real or apparent difficulty\nin its connection with secondary personality that I shall consider. But\ni It is important in considering the telepathic theory to examine two things about\nit before measuring its application to the facts here recorded. The first is or concerns\nwhat telepathy really means, ~and the second is the reason for invoking it in the\nexplanation of such facts in any case.\nIn taking up the first of these topics, the nature of telepathy, it will be important\nto recognise a current distinction of some value. This is the difference between\ntelepathy at a distance, as the word etymologically imports, and direct thought-\ntransference from the mind of the sitter, or experimenter, immediately present. Some\nhave supposed that if you only exclude thought-transference from the sitter, and also\nthat of the actually existing states of consciousness in the person at a distance, you have\nproved the spiritistic hypothesis once for all. This may be true as a matter of fact, but\nit is not the assumption upon which the psychical researcher has to work. For him\nsubliminal telepathy present and at a distance has to be eliminated in some way before\nsurrendering. Hence, for the purpose which we have in view here, the technical dis\ntinction between the two conceptions will notsubserve any important end evidentially,\nthough it would help in understanding both the complexity of the problem and the addi\ntional difficulties involved in telepathy at a distance over and above those in thought-\ntransference at hand. This analysis I shall give of the matter for occasional use in this\ndiscussion where I mayfind it necessary toeconomise time and space. But for the general\ncomprehension of the problem and of the meaning which I shall usually attach to the\nterm, I shall only remark that I do not intend to recognise any qualitative difference\nbetween telepathy at a distance and thought-transference at hand, simply because we\nhave to produce evidence that both are insufficient to account for the phenomena\nbefore resorting to spiritism. This is evident. But I shall analyse the case fully,\nthough briefly, for the sake of clearness in comprehending it. If I could safely\nsubstitute a general term for telepathy I should do it, and employ this latter for its\ntechnical meaning as often understood, but I fear that it would only lead to\nconfusion.\nIn transcending sensory perception we may conceive all acquisition of ideas as\nTranspercoption, or Transcognition, and thus have a term for a few minutes to\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 125\nin the discussion of the subject I wish to keep the conceptions of\ntelepathy and secondary personality distinct from each other as\nfunctional processes of the brain or mind as the case may be.\nI wish, therefore, to examine first the strength of the telepathic\nhypothesis, as against spiritism, before approaching the objections to\nit. This procedure will enable the reader to observe what I have\ntaken into account in rejecting it in favour of its alternative. First, I\nsimply assume it as a fact sufficiently attested by evidence outside\nthe Piper case, as well as by the phenomena in that case which make\nthe supposition necessary for all attempts to escape spiritism. The\nonly problem that remains is to see if the supposition will stand the\n\u25a0strain that must be put upon it to meet the emergency. That is, can\nwe push its implications so far that spiritism becomes preferable by\nvirtue of the very magnitude of our suppositions to escape it.\nNow a priori its strength lies in the assumption that it has no\nproved limitations in space and temporal coincidence with present\nactive consciousness. We may have no right to this assumption, but\nin the absence of any demonstrable limits to transperception, after\nsensory experience has been transcended, we must be prepared for any\nsuppositions whatever, especially when we add to this extension of\nrepresent every possible conception for which telepathy has had to stand. I might\neven coin a more technical term, namely, Noopathy, which I should actually like to\nsee come into use, as convenient for indicating the process that has to be eliminated\nin order to finally establish the spiritistic theory. This Noopathy, or Transperception\ncould be subdivided into Telepathy, or thought-transference at a distance, and\nParapathy, or thought-transference at hand, limiting the term, of course, to a process\nbetween the living. I also coin the latter term for its technical purpose. Each of\nthese can be subdivided into two distinct problems, namely, transperception from the\nsupraliminal, and transperception from the subliminal of the agent. But the present\nproblem will not require any special use of this distinction, as the record shows how\nlittle supraliminal transperception has to do with the theories necessary to explain\nthe phenomena. But the tabular analysis, representing the various possible problems\nthat have to be ultimately considered in making up one's mind on the hypothesis to\nbe adopted, will stand as follows :\u2014\nThe superficial distinction between telepathy and parapathy in this table is\nmerely spacial. But it is in fact far more profound. Telepathy under all physical\nanalogies has to contend with the laws of distribution of energy, which represent its\nvariation inversely with the distance. Of course it may be wholly different with\nmental phenomena, but once concede this difference and physical explanations are\nthrown out of consideration, and the presumptions are in favour of a mind or soul\n(\nNoopathy <\nv.\nParapathy\n\f126 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\npossibilities that of disregarding the distinction between present and\npast states of consciousness in the telepathic acquisitions. The very\nconception with which we start, therefore, involves enormous difficulties\nto be overcome, whether they be of arbitrary making or not. The\nsecond consideration in favour of accepting telepathy as an important\nalternative in the case, is the fact that an immense mass of evidence on\nhand bears no indications of personal identity, whereas evidence of\nthis is indispensable to the spiritistic theory, and hence suggests the\nexplanation of the more complex by the more simple. In all our cases\nof experimental telepathy there are no traces of coincidences that\nwould suggest spirits as the cause (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. I., pp. 13-64,\n70-98, 161-216, and 263-282 ; Vol. II., pp. 1-12, 24-42, 189-200,\n207-216, 239-264; Vol. III., pp. 424-452; Vol. IV., pp. 111-126,\n127-188, 324-337 ; Vol. V., pp. 18-168, 169-207, 355-359 ; Vol. VI.,\npp. 128-170, 358-397; Vol. VII., pp. 3-22, 374-382; Vol. VIII.,\npp. 422-435, 536-596; Vol. XL, pp. 2-17; also Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. I., pp. 10-85 ; Apparitions and Thought Transference, by\nFrank Podmore, pp. 18-143). Nor do we find any definable limits\nto it from space and temporal coincidence except in some instances by\nMrs. Sidgwick and Miss Johnson, where distance seemed to affect the\nnumber of successes (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 536-596). There\nwhich, under physical conceptions, is still tubjudicc. But besides having to contend\nwith the known laws of distribution of energy, telepathy also represents a much\nwider selective power in its acquisition than parapathy, and for this reason the\ntechnical distinction would be useful in certain discussions. But as we have to over\ncome every possible form of transperception, or transcendental cognition either\nevidentially or in conceivability, we need not confuse the present discussion with any\nother use of the term telepathy than is customary in psychical research. This will be\napparent from the following delimitation of the problem.\nIf the alternatives were between spiritism and either parapathy or telepathy from\nthe supraliminal of the agents, the case would be demonstrated in favour of spiritism,\nas every one would admit. But as the psychical researcher has to assume that this\nalternative is at least between spiritism and parapathy from the subliminal of the\nagents, the problem is complicated with the whole field of memory and so made much\nlarger, though it is already clear in the Piper phenomena that on that conception of\nthe choice the case would be unequivocally in favour of spiritism. But if we have\nto take telepathy into account, as defined in the table, the alternatives are very\ndifferent, and the problem evidentially very much larger. The question would then be\nbetween Ncopathy and Spiritism, as perhaps it is for the lack of any definable limits\nto mental acquisitions transcending sensory methods.\nBut valuable as such a complete analysis and the more technical use of new and\nold terms may be, I shall not complicate the present discussion by imposing any new\ndifficulties upon the student in reading this report. I give the analysis in order to\nindicate what conception of the problem is before me, and permit the reader to apply\nthe necessary meaning of the term telepathy as the exigency of the special case\nrequires. Hence I shall use it as convertible with transperception, or noopathy.\nBut there is still another fact in regard to the meaning of the term telepathy,\nconceived as either noopathy or parapathy. Before assuming that it represents a\nview that necessarily displaces spiritism, we require to recognise that its meaning\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 127\nis in all of these no suggestion of personal identity, and hence if we\nonce assume a non-spiritistic supernormal power sufficient to account\nfor the coincidences, experimental and spontaneous, that are found in\nour Proceedings, we have a serious task to set aside that assumption.\nBut it must be strained beyond acceptance before its alternative,\nspiritism, can be tolerated. That, I think, is a truism for the psychical\nresearcher, and requires re-statement here only for those who are not\nfamiliar with our reports, and who may not otherwise understand the\ndifficulties which I have been forced to consider before reaching my\npresent convictions on the Piper phenomena.\nNow in estimating the application of telepathy to the facts adduced\nin the record of my experiments the task of refuting that hypothesis\nwould be an exceedingly easy one, if I had only to compare the results\nwith my consciousness at the time. There is scarcely a single spon\ntaneous incident, if any at all, in the whole twelve personal sittings, to\nsay nothing of Dr. Hodgson'sJive held while I was absent in New York,\nthat represented a present state of my active consciousness until the com\nmunication made it such after the writing. I watched very care\nfully for the influence of present states on the content of the messages\nand found not the slightest trace of a causal nexus. This is a circum\nstance, however, that only the sitter can fully appreciate, as the record\ndefinitely implies the modus operandi of the process that excludes spiritism. As\na fact, the term is not necessarily antagonistic to spiritism. There is one con\nception of it, possible at least, which does not contravene the theory which is\nhere represented as its alternative, bat which may allow us actually to invoke\nspiritism as an explanation of the coincidences and assumed transmission of thought\nthat has induced us to consider telepathy as a fact at all. That is to say, tele\npathy might be the modus operandi of spiritistic agency in producing the\ncoincidences which we are trying to explain away by the term. Not that I\nshould advocate that conception of the process, but that our ignorance of the nature\nof the process permits us to assume that possibility a priori. Thus, if telepathy\nbe a mere name for the transmission of ideas from one mind to another, or the coin\ncidences that go under that name, we have no other conception of it than that offacts\nthat require a causal explanation. Nothing is implied as to the intermediaries in the\ncase. That must remain an open question. Assuming then that telepathy is nothing\nbut a name for coincidences that demand a cause independent of sensory mediation,\nwe could also assume with tolerable impunity that spirits are the media for effecting\nthe phenomena, if we have any other grounds for supposing them to exist. But it is\nthe want of evidence for the latter hypothesis that necessitates making the causal\nnexus one of immediate transmission between incarnate minds. Hence, though our\nignorance of the real process is great enough to admit spiritistic agency as possible in\nmediating the coincidences, yet such a supposition serves no useful purpose in the\npremises, and only begs the question at issue, until we know moreabout it. That the\nspiritistic theory can be used to cover phenomena accredited to telepathy pure and\nsimple is indicated both by the incidents in Dr. Hodgson's experiments with G. P. (cf.\nProceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 304-308, 313-315), and by the attempt to decide whether\nthe facts indicated a preference for the spiritistic nature of Dr. Phinuit, as a pre\ncondition of simpler explanation of his doings than the secondary personality of Mrs.\nPiper (cf. Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 28-46, 54-56). But this discounts the evidential\n\f128 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ndoes not show what he was thinking about prior to the communica\ntions. All that I can do, therefore, is to indicate that this difficulty\nhas been adequately considered and met by an absolute disparity\nbetween the two sets of phenomena, in so far as the causal influence of\nthe present states is concerned. I took special occasion to test this\nmatter and found all grounds for such hypotheses wanting. For\ninstance, if the present state affected either the manner or content of\nthe messages, the mental perturbation or confusion as to what was\nmeant by certain messages should have reflected itself in a correspond\ning confusion in the communication. Of course, there were occasions\nwhen my own confusion was coincident with the confusion in the record,\nbut this was due primarily to the confusion in the communication and\nnot to myself. It was too often my ignorance of the facts communi\ncated that produced my confusion to suppose any influence from my\nstate of mind upon the results. Besides, inquiry developed the fact that\nsome of the best incidents which were wholly unintelligible to me at\nthe time, but verified afterward, were coincident with mental confusion\non my part. Dr. Hodgson's five sittings while I was absent are a fatal\nobjection to any supposition of this kind. To psychical researchers\nthis goes without saying. (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 453, 564-5,\nand Vol. VIII., p. 10.)\nIn line with the same thought it is interesting to remark that I had\nnot dreamed of hearing from several of the communicators, and several\nproblem which,many suppose, requires that in some way we transcend telepathyofevery\nsort as a condition of making any other hypothesis that will subordinate it in the end.\nHence with scientific method to satisfy, which keeps us within the field ofadirect process\nfor the mediation of telepathic coincidences, we have to assume this in all our\nexplanations and thus conceive it as antagonistic to spiritism, at least in its evidential\naspects, if not in its process. Consequently, though I see nothing in the mere fact\nof thought transmission, conceived as a coincidence requiring a causal explanation, to\nmilitate against spiritism either as a general theory, or as the agency for effecting the\ncoincidence (cf. Proceeding\/!, Vol. XV., p. 18), nevertheless the circumstance that\nmany of the coincidences do not furnish any evidence of personal identity makes it\nimperative to assume the possibility that the process is a direct one between incarnate\nminds, and thus conceive it as antagonistic to spiritism until it is shown to be either\nan independent or a sulwrdinate agency in such phenomena.\nThe result of these two considerations, therefore, is that I shall treat the term\ntelepathy as a name for a causal coincidence whose modus operandi is wholly unknown\n(cf. Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 160), and indifferent to the limitations of space\n(cf. Proceedings, Vol. XII., p. 174) and of temporal coincidence with present mental\nstates thus making it preferable to assume the possibility of a direct process between\nliving minds, as long, at least, as it does not attempt to produce the personal identity\nof the dead. It is important to remark for the benefit of the scientific Philistine that\nunless this view of the case be admitted there is absolutely no escape from the\nspiritistic theory. That theory would then have nothing but fraud as its alternative,\nand the task of the psychical researcher would be a very easy one. Hence if I do not\ntreat telepathy, conceived in the sense defined for the purpose here, as an alternative\nto spiritism, I should not find it necessary to discuss the question beyond the state\nment of the facts in my notes to the communications.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena, 120\npersons that I had expected on the telepathic theory made no appear\nance whatever. I had expected to hear from three on every imaginable\ntheory of such phenomena, but one of these and a fourth who was\ndesired show not a trace of themselves. Besides, although I got traces\nof two sisters long since deceased, and although there was much in my\nsupraliminal and subliminal about them neither telepathy nor the\ndramatic personations of secondary personality presented them as\npersonal communicators. It would have been useless to do so in any\nattempt to establish identity, since what I knew about them was\nmerely told me after their deaths. On the telepathic theory I should\nhave heard from them as well as from Charles and Anna. But\ndoes telepathy limit itself to common experiences between the\nsitter and the alleged communicator, excluding other derived know\nledge associated with the persons, or are Imperator and Rector wise\nenough not to undertake communications that have no chance of\nproving personal identity, as they could not have done in the case of\nthe two sisters indicated 1\nThis is a very important conclusion, not only because it excludes\nthe whole theory of telepathy from the case, if that doctrine is made\nconvertible with the transperception of existing states of conscious\nness, but also because it represents a fact quite at variance with the\nwhole record of experimental telepathy as referred to above, where\ntelepathy obtained access to the intended ideas of the agent, even\nthough this is sometimes, if not always, postponed for a short time. If\nexperimental telepathy indicates some connection, though slightly\ndeferred, between present consciousness and the fact obtained by the\npercipient, we ought not to find such uniform variance with the sitter's\nconsciousness in the Piper case and the incidents communicated.\nA conclusion based upon this circumstance would throw telepathy\nout of consideration. But, unfortunately for spiritism (I am willing\nto say fortunately for both this theory and the interests of civilisation)\nthe problem is not so simple. We have to assume a far larger possi\nbility in the case, and this is the acquisition of facts from the subliminal\nof the agent. Whether it is absolutely imperative or not to assume\ntelepathic access to subliminal knowledge I shall not decide. There is\nsome evidence that it is a fact. The circumstance that the telepathic\nacquisition seems never to be instantaneous upon the inception of the\nagent's thought rather suggests the assumption. Especial evidence for\nthis is noticeable in certain interesting cases (Cf. Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII., pp. 14, 548, 561). Consequently our duty is clear in such\npremises, and the problem becomes correspondingly difficult, as it is all\nbut impossible to assert with absolute assurance that certain things\nhave never been in one's knowledge. There will be evidences of this\nin my own record. (See pp. 337, 341, 440.)\nK\n\f130 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nAssuming then that telepathy may have access to the whole range\nof the individual's experience, supraliminal or subliminal, there is first\nthe significant remark to be made, in suspicion of its capacity to meet\nthe phenomena of this record, that both in my own experiments and\napparently those of all others in the Piper case, there is no perceptible\ndistinction drawn by that process between ideas present and ideas\npast but recognised, and so present after recognition, or between either\nof these and ideas wholly forgotten and unrecognisable on suggestion.\nThe indifference of the process to absolute distinctions for our concep\ntion of knowledge is most amazing, and has no analogies or support in\nphilosophy of any sort. This indifference also extends still farther.\nThe access may be to facts not known to the sitter at all, and obtain\nable only at a distance from some unknown person. Of this again. I\nam now merely indicating the fact which shows that we cannot assert\nor suppose that any condition of an idea in the sitter's mind or memory,\nwhether supraliminal or subliminal, recognisable or unrecognisable, has\nany determining influence one way or the other on telepathic acquisi\ntion. This is a suspicious fact for the theory. I do not say that it is\nan objection, for the present state of our knowledge does not justify so\npositive a statement until we have tried implications of the theory\nmuch farther. But I do say that, when the phenomena of the Piper\ncase represent so clearly the character of personal identity of one that\nwe once knew, and all in contrast to the ordinary results of experi\nmental telepathy, this indifference to the distinctions which are so\nnatural to our usual psychology is more consistent with the spiritistic\ntheory, where we can assume the known mental laws, than with\ntelepathy which at least appears to contravene them, and which, if it\ndoes not contravene them, seems to demand a wholly new law of\nmental action quite as unrecognised in psychology and physics as is\nspiritism.\nThere is a peculiarity about this indifference to ordinary psycho\nlogical laws and distinctions which indicates that on the telepathic theory\nthe process is hardly consistent with itself. The manner in which it\ndefies our recollections, and the wonderful range of its power over\nimportant and trivial matters alike rather indicate that confusions and\nmistakes ought not to occur at all. When the most difficult and complex\nincidents are rattled off at a breakneck pace, and with apparent ease at\ntimes, it is absurd for a process which is wholly indifferent, presumably,\nto psychological laws as we know them, to falter and show confusion at\nsome simple fact involving no necessary complications. The variations\nof facility and difficulty in the communications bear no determinate\nrelation either to the nature and complexities of the incidents given or\nto the mental condition of the sitter. On the contrary, the free\nmixture of the known and the forgotten, or of the known and unknown\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 131\nin the mind of the sitter, with absolute disregard of space and time\nlimitations, all in the same sentence, makes the mistakes and confusions\nseem absurd in most, if not in all cases, on the theory of telepathic\naccess. They would appear quite conceivable on the spiritistic hypo\nthesis, as we should expect from known laws of mental action both\nconfusion in such circumstances and a selection of incidents with\nreference to an interest and a unity wholly outside the experience of\nthe sitter.\nThis last statement is illustrated, and telepathy at short range\ndismissed from view, by the large number of facts in the Piper record\nthat show their origin beyond the mind of the sitter altogether. But\nI shall confine my instances to my own record where they are suffi\nciently numerous and complicated not to be discredited.\nI shall enumerate the incidents bearing upon this argument in\nseveral classes, which may be indicated by Roman numerals. Class I.\nwill contain those which I thought at the time they were given that I\nhad never known, or that they were false, but which inquiry proved\nto have been at one time in my consciousness. Class II. will contain\nthose which in all probability I never knew, but which, owing to the\ncircumstances, I cannot prove were unknown. Class III., if the\nincidents can be admitted as evidential on the ground of my inter\npretation of them, will contain those which were unknown to me.\nClass IV. will contain those which I knew which Dr. Hodgson did not\nknow, and which were given at the sittings that he held in my behalf.\nClass V. will contain the incidents which were given in the sittings at\nwhich I was present, and which I most certainly, that is without\nreasonable doubt, did not know until verified.\nThe reader may wish to know that the only fact which had been\ntold Dr. Hodgson about my father was that my father was deceased.\nI mentioned no name and no incident in his life, except that I had\ntold my father on his death bed to come to me after it was all over.\nThis was a year or more before my sittings. Also I might say in\nregard to the mere question of the sitter's relation to the facts com\nmunicated I could have included Class IV. in Class V. This would\nincrease that number considerably for the purposes of theoretical\ndiscussion.\nClass I.\u2014These are the Swedenborg incident (p. 31), the\nstrychnine in connection with the Hyomei (p. 38), my father's visit\nto me in Chicago (p. 440), the curved handled cane which was repaired\nwith a tin ring (p. 58).\nClass II.\u2014The organ incident in connection with Harper Crawford\nand the church (p. 82), the black skull cap (p. 43), and the visit\nto George and Will before going West (p. 72).\nk 2\n\f132 [part\nJ.

In all they constitute a numerous and important set of\nincidents bearing upon the tenability of the telepathic hypothesis.\nClass I V.\u2014-Of these there are my father's inquiry about his pen or\nspecial quill (p. 54), the fact that we grew more companionable as we\ngrew older (p. 387), the reference to his preaching (p. 55), the advice\ngiven to me when I started to college (non-evidential) with its phrase\n\"Want for nothing\" (p. 61), his feelings at the time (p. 61), the allu\nsion to the rough roads and country, the name of Ohio as connected\nwith my father, the talk with the principal of the school, and the\nanxieties of my father, Aunt Nannie, and myself in connection with\nmy brother George (p. 61), my father's moving West and separation\nfrom me with my ignorance of his habits and dress (p. 43), the initials\ncarved on the end of the cane (p. 57), the reference to Hyomei as a\n\" vapor \" (p. 39), the mention of the tokens (p. 54).\nClans V.\u2014I shall enumerate these as briefly as possible with the\nreferences. The Cooper case with its reference to discussions, friend\nship, correspondence, and especially the Cooper school (pp. 51-54),\nthe paper cutter (p 50), the writing pad (p. 49), the dog Peter which\nGeorge had (p. 96), the name of Jennie in connection with Lucy\n(p. 106), the change in the name of my aunt Eliza (p. 82), my uncle\nJames McClellan's dislike of the name Jim (p. 109), his friendship\nfor Dr. Cooper (p. 52), and the name of his mother Nancy (p. 110),\nthe name of my uncle's father, John (p. 110), the fact that a John\nMcClellan was in the war (p. 1 1 3), the name Hathaway and its con\nnection with this John McClellan (p 112), that this John McClellan\nwas familiarly called \" Uncle John,\" being no relative and not known\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 133\nto me (p. 113), the incident of his lost finger (p. 113), the sun\nstroke incident and its connection with the name David, the name of\nthe brother-in-law (p.

We may well halt before asserting or assuming such an\nomniscient power.\nBut if any one chooses to advance it rather than spiritism we\nshould find it very difficult to displace such a doctrine, as it is always\ndifficult or impossible to compete with appeals to the infinite. We may\nwell ask in reply whether such a conception is not convertible with\npantheism, or that form of monism that conceives all phenomena what\nsoever, present, past, and future, as modes of the absolute, a conception\nwhich I must consider as equivalent to spiritism, because we can as\nwell postulate the continuance of each set of facts in that way as in\n\f134 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthe form of individualisation usually imagined in the \"spiritual body\"\nor immaterial soul. The real question is whether any given stream of\nconsciousness can continue or not, and the issue is not its relation, once\nexisting, to the absolute ; its persistence is just as possible under the\nconception of pantheism with its reduction of everything to modes, as\nit is under the conception of atomic monism or pluralism which\nendeavours to individualise the stream of consciousness in forms of\ntime and space. But, in so far as the problem of psychical research is\nconcerned, the metaphysics of survival after death is not a matter of\npresent interest, but only whether the evidence justifies the supposition\nthat an individual stream of consciousness once known continues to\npersist in other conditions. We need not call it \" spirit \" at all, if that\nterm leads to an illusion regarding the facts. We may simply conceive\nthe present stream as a mode of the infinite, and suppose that mediumistic\nphenomena enable us to communicate with a transcendental stream, as\nour ordinary intercourse is a communication with a terrestrial stream.\nIn both cases we are dealing with modes of the infinite. With\nthis premise, it should certainly be possible to insist that the facts\nacquired by such supposed telepathy involving the defiance of time and\nspace, and imitating the selectiveness of the infinite, could be most\neasily conceived as implying the survival of the absolute's modes under\nchanged conditions, just as memory represents our present command\nof the past.\nThe best analogy, however, is the one above where we compared\nthe case to two streams of the same subject, representing the con\ntinuance of both with difficulties in the way of communication between\nthe transcendental and the terrestrial that do not affect the intercourse\nbetween the two streams in the present life ; that is between two\nterrestrial streams in different subjects or persons. The analogy can\nbe further carried out in the chasm that we often find separating com\nmunication between the primary and the secondary personality. Now\nthis infinite telepathy must either be reduced to this conception, or we\nhave to suppose that Mrs. Piper's brain is the centre and origin of the\nwhole affair. The latter is an hypothesis which I imagine the physio\nlogist is hardly prepared to accept. But the possibility of making the\ntelepathy required to meet the case convertible with spiritism, in the\nonly meaning of the term that the facts support, or that has any\npractical interest for either science or morals, is a reductio ad abxurdum\nof his theory for w hich the telepathist is probably not prepared. If,\nhowever, it does not mean the substantial identity of spiritism and\nomniscient telepathy by their unity in pantheistic monism, it certainly\nconceives a representation of the case which pits spiritism against\nomniscience. Whatever objections are to be made to such a supposi\ntion, if science has the audacity to make it, they must rise from the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 135\nmagnitude of the hypothesis and both its difficulties for the ordinary\nscientific imagination and its return to something like first causes for\nexplanation after preaching for centuries against this procedure.\nWere it not for the exceptional character of the coincidences that\nsuggest telepathy as an explanation of them we might ask a question\nthat is now forbidden us because the facts are exceptional. Its first\nmeaning is that of a connection between certain mental states that\ndemands a causal explanation. If it meant nothing more than the\nadmission of a causal nexus beyond sensory agency, we might ask for\nthe evidence of the hypothesis that it is a direct process between the\ntwo brains. Usually even in new theories we only extend some old\nhypothesis to cover new phenomena whose relation to the old conception\nhad not been suspected. Newton's theory of gravitation is an illus\ntration of this. He only extended the assumed gravity that accounted\nfor the fall of an apple to the celestial bodies from which it had been\nexcluded before. Hypotheses non Jingo was the maxim of science and\nis still, and new forces are not admissible except in the application of the\nMethod of Difference. (Mill, Logic, Book III., Chap. VIII., \u00a7\u00a72 and\n3; Whewell, Philosophy of Inductive Science, Vol. II., pp. 409-12;\nSigwart, Logic, English Translation, Vol. II., pp. 339, 419-20.) It\nhappens, of course, in the phenomena under survey here that the\nevidence for spiritistic claims is the same that has to be adduced for\nthe enormous extension of telepathy demanded to meet the emergency.\nWe might then ask for additional evidence for a definite conception\nof the telepathic process which is assumed to account for the coin\ncidences suggesting it. This is tantamount to demanding the pre\nexisting conception which is extended in covering such phenomena,\nand so to asking for evidence of the process assumed as well as for\nthe coincidences requiring an explanation. But unfortunately we\ncannot hastily take this recourse for weakening the claims of\ntelepathy, as the absolutely exceptional nature of the phenomena\nconforms to the requirement of exceptional theories, and both the\ngeneral presumptions of physiological science and the exemption of\nexperimental telepathy from traces of personal identity demand that\nwe first assume the subject or the percipient as the cause, and\nso extend the simpler hypothesis involved in non-spiritistic phenomena\nto the wider class, if the extension does not exact more than the\nsupposition can support. Hence, though it is possible to explain\ntelepathy either by spiritism or in subordination to it after the existence\nof a soul is established, we are reduced by the conception indicated to\nanother resource for disputing its adequacy. The problem is such that\nthe very existence of a soul goes with the proof of its survival. That\nis to say, we cannot assume that there is any other subject of conscious\nness than the brain until we have applied the Method of Difference\n\f136 [part\nH. Hyslop,Ph.D.\nand isolated consciousness or personal identity as a fact, from which to\ninfer the existence of a subject for it other than the brain. Conse\nquently, no presuppositions can be entertained for suggesting a priori\npossibilities in the direction of spiritism of some sort, as that theory\nwould be practically proved by the admission that there is a mental\nsubject other than the brain. The existence of such a subject once\ngranted, whether simple or complex, the law of the conservation of\nenergy would render survival of substance or energy in some form\ncertain, even if it did not carry the continuity of our personal con\nsciousness with it. But as the proof of this last is the first condition\nof assuming the existence of a soul, we are forced to remain by the\nfunctions of the brain until we have to gasp at the magnitude of the\ntheories that are invented to sustain the case against spiritism.\nThe most important limitation upon telepathy as a theory is the\nquestion which every scientific man should ask himself, and that is\nwhether he fully appreciates what it demands of his comprehension. It\nis a very easy thing to say \" telepathy \" when we find a mental coinci\ndence between two persons that cannot be explained by chance or normal\npsychological laws. This is not only legitimate, but the only sane\ncourse to take if the premises demand such. But when the facts\naccumulate and extend their character until our first supposition begins\nto arrogate the attributes of omniscience it becomes suspicious. As a\nprecaution against hasty conclusions involving matters so important as\na future life, it is as imperative as it is useful. I have always used it,\nand shall continue to use it, where the facts imply a supernormal nexus\nbetween the mental states of two different persons but do not reflect\nany traces of the personal identity that suggests spiritism. It is the\nonly safe criterion of the evidence that does not supply spiritistic\nimplications. But in all cases, and especially when our facts enlarge\nthe range of the theories we are in the habit of adducing for their\nexplanation, we are responsible for the logical consequences that attend\nthose theories. Experimental telepathy has a most decided limitation\nto its action. It appears to be confined to the intended fact in the com\nmunication, even if the fact be slightly deferred. Spontaneous telepathy\ninvolves the present activity of consciousness. But when we find the\nenormously complicated phenomena of personal identity involved, and\nevery imaginable limitation of space and temporal coincidence tran\nscended with the greatest ease, we must stop to ask what is involved\nin our telepathic hypothesis. Scientific method demands this procedure.\nNo man can escape the necessary deductions from his theories, or the\nfull interpretation of their meaning in the light of the facts they are\nmade to cover. (Cf. Jevons, Principles of Science, Chap. XXIII ;\nMill, Logic, Book III., Chap. XIV.) This demand is designed to deter\nmine the range of their power, and it stands or falls with its ability or\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 137\ninability to meet the situation. Hence it is much easier to say tele\npathy, and thus to create some confusion for spiritism than it is to\nsupply evidence outside a priori possibilities and the privileges of\nscepticism for pretensions of such magnitude as a quasi omniscient\ntelepathy supposes. But, once postulated, the hypothesis must stand\nthe test of the following considerations, and be accepted against the\n^suspicions that they arouse.i\nS (1) There is not one single verifiable incident in the whole seventeen\n\\^ sittings that belongs to my own personal memory or knowledge alone.\nI cannot even except the Maltine incident (p. 418). The incidents\naffecting identity are either all common to the memories of myself\nand the alleged communicators, or to their memories and that of some\nother living person, the latter facts not being known to me at the\ntime.\nI had thought at one time that there was one incident which repre\nsented a decided exception to this assertion, though it appeared to\ncontain no truth from the standpoint of my knowledge. This was the\nincident that I had in mind when I said in an article in the New World\n(Vol. VIII., pp. 255-272) that the discrimination in the selection of\nincidents \" is so perfect that only a few isolated words, not incidents,\ncan even be suspected of being filched from my personal habits of\nthought.\" I had reference to the \" philosophical discussions \" connected\nwith the Cooper case in Dr. Hodgson's sittings for me, which, we must\nremember, involved my absence two hundred and fifty miles away. But\nthe discovery afterward, that this Cooper referred to had a wholly distinct\npertinence from that which I imagined it was intended for, completely\nremoves this suspicion and puts the case in the category of the others.\nSuch a conception makes the telepathic discrimination and selection\n\u25a0v of verifiable incidents one of incredible proportions. The whole\nmass of my personal experiences, exclusive of those connected with the\ncommunication, is absolutely ignored, and only those which are common\nto the living and the dead are chosen. Still farther, this selective\ncapacity extends to the discrimination between my memories regarding\nmany deceased persons that I knew and who do not appear at all, and\nmemories of a certain group of family acquaintances near and remote.\nEven here it omits some that I should have expected, and did expect,\nto \" communicate.\" The fact that justified this expectation was actually\nintimated in a few instances, but no definite communications ever came\nto satisfy it. Still further yet, the discrimination and selection were\ni Nothing in the discussion of the telepathic hypothesis must be interpreted as\nreflecting upon the supposition that the communications are telepathically dispatched\nfrom discarnate spirits. It is only the hypothesis of telepathy between the living\nthat is here controverted, not as a fact, sporadic or otherwise, but as an adequate\naccount of such facts as are found in this and other records of the Piper phenomena.\n\f138 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ninvariable between my own thoughts associated with my memory of the\ncommunicators and the real experiences common with theirs in life. That\nis to say, the process has infallible command over the distinction between\nthe associated connection of my mere thoughts about the communicators\nand the same connection of my real experience in common with theirs '\nThis is a fact that ought to embarrass the believer in telepathy, because\nthat process in the experimental efforts to test it shows no selectiveness\nat all of an independent sort. It is definitely correlated with the\narbitrary selection of the agent. But here we have an intelligent\nselectiveness with reference to the illustration of personal identity that\narrogates every function of omniscience within the time allotted to its\naction. But now right in contradiction with this infinite discrimina\ntive power occurs the perfectly finite capacity for confusion, error, and\ndifficulty in getting right these memories about the actual communi\ncators which have been infallibly separated from my own personal\nexperience associated and unassociated with the communicators ! This\nis a kind of discrepancy or weakness that ought not to occur with so\nunfailing a power to discriminate between pertinent and impertinent\nincidents bearing upon personal identity. Assuming the application of\ntelepathy, therefore, we have here a capacity absolutely free from\nillusion and mnemonic error in discriminating between the individual\nand the common incidents and selecting its field of operation, but full\nof contradictions, confusions and indistinctness within the limits of the\nfield chosen for the acquisition of the facts. Why should this infallible\ndistinction between the right and wrong groups of facts consist with so-\nfinite and fallible a capacity to give the right ones thus circumscribed.\nUnder the Phinuit regime this peculiarity was not noticeable. In\nfact the selection of much that did not show the slightest flavour of\npersonal identity indicated a graver suspicion in favour of telepathy, as\nall that was necessary to account for the phenomena, especially since this\nsupposition seemed to give a unity to the case which spiritism could not\ndo without assuming that Phinuit was a discarnate spirit, and that was\na part of the issue to be determined. But whatever theory we may have\nto account for the difference between the Phinuit and the Imperator\nregime, the fact of this unfailing discrimination of the true from the\nfalse, as between individual and common incidents for personal identity,\nand the amazing limitations in the attainment of the relevant within\nits own area, after its distinction from the irrelevant, remain an\ninteresting and puzzling circumstance. This fact of limitation and error\nstands in proper conformity with the idea of finite processes with which\nscience has everywhere else to deal, and so must make us cautious in\nsupposing something that at least simulates the infinite, which the\ntelepathy seems to do. There is no evidence and no analogy in\neither the physical or the mental sciences outside psychical research,\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 139\nfor any such power, especially when we assume the selectiveness\nexhibited by it. Telepathy simply becomes so large in its pretensions,\nif we insist on it, that there is nothing of which we can suppose it\nincapable, except perhaps prediction, and even this is excepted only for\nlack of the data by which to apply the assumption of telepathy as an\nescape froln the spiritistic theory.\ni (2) The\/ objection from the selectiveness of telepathy, once assumed,\napplies equally to its short and its long range. But I have not\nemphasised the infinity that is implied in the latter conception of it.\nIts enormous magnitude becomes much more astounding when we try\nto think of the selection it must make between pertinent and\nimpertinent facts in the memories of living persons at any distance,\nafter actually hunting them up and discriminating them from all other\nliving persons, all equally unknown to the percipient. Had we to deal\nonly with phenomena representing merely the memories of the sitter\nand such statements as are false or mere guess work when the\n\" communications \" transcended the memories of the sitter, we should\nfind telepathy more tolerable (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 461-462,\n569\u2014574 ; Vol. VIII., pp. 9-16). But when events or facts are\nchosen which are true and verifiably independent of the sitter's mind,\nthe telepathy that would account for this becomes infinitely more\nselective and complex than that which is limited to the sitter's mind.\nTo state it as boldly and clearly as is possible, it involves the power of\nthe medium, wholly unconscious and not knowing the sitter, as any\ncondition of establishing rapport at any distance, to select any\nabsolutely unknown person necessary, anywhere in the world, and from\nhis memory make the selection of pertinent facts to represent personal\nidentity, as that selection has been described for the mind of the\nsitter ! ! Such a conception is the Nemesis of the credulity which is\nusually charged to spiritism. It ought to take far more evidence to\nprove this than to justify spiritism, which at least has the merit of\nremaining within the sphere of the finite, while it conforms to known\nmental laws in both its strength and its weakness.\nNor will any analogies from wireless telegraphy be applicable here,\nin spite of its conception of coherers arranged for particular kinds of\nmessages. We must remember first that the coherer in wireless tele\ngraphy is a prearranged affair for its purpose and is limited to a\npartictdar kind of message. Otherwise there is no success of any kind.\nThere is absolutely no selectiveness in the coherer, and this supposition\nis necessary to the analogy. If the coherer could select any system of\nmessages sent out into the ether and omit those not pertinent to the\nparty at its end, the analogy might be urged. But this is precisely\nwhat it does not do and cannot do. We must first know both\nends of the line sufficiently to adjust the coherer to the machine\n\f140 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nsending out the messages, and the whole process is purely mechanical\nand absolutely wanting in the intelligent adjustment to the given\nsituation as in psychical mediumship. Now in the Piper case there is\nno pre-arrangement for rapport of any kind with any special person,\nand on the telepathic hypothesis the medium must have the capacity\nto be and represent a coherer infinitely better than anything producible\nin wireless telegraphy, as she is spontaneously adjustable to any person\nin any condition, at any distance, and at any instant. The supposed\nprocess obtains in one part of a sentence a fact from the sitter, and in\nthe other part of the same sentence mentions a fact unknown to the\nsitter and obtained from some one a thousand or ten thousand miles\ndistant and unknown to the medium (Cf. answer to question about the\ncane, p. 494). In addition to all this it is intelligently selective for\nthe purpose of producing the evidence for proving personal identity,\nleaving other matters aside. A man has only to state such a\nsupposition in order to refute it, and in order to ridicule the\nassumed analogy with wireless telegraphy. There is in fact no\nresemblance between the two phenomena except their amazing\ncharacter, and that is evidently a very poor fact upon which to base\ntheir physical identity.\nAs a more conclusive objection to both this assumed analogy and\nto telepathy itself without that analogy, I may refer to the universal\nlaw of the distribution of energy in the physical world. This law is\nthat force varies inversely with the distance ; the ratio may be the\nsquare, cube or other power. This makes it possible to assign definite\nlimits to the perceptible influence of such forces. Now if telepathy\nfollows any such laws in its action, it must be classed with heat, light\nand magnetism, and so regarded as propagated like them. Other\nwise we have a universe of energy at variance with the physical,\nwhich is the point at issue. But if that be once granted the\nstrongest a priori objection to spirits is forever broken down, and\ndissent from their possibility is mere quibbling after that. But\nif we assume, as we must on physical analogies, that telepathy\nconforms to this universal law, we find, in addition to the diffi\nculty of its selectiveness, the circumstance that, in spite of its\ndecreasing intensity, it passes all minds in its neighbourhood and\nchooses the right person at any distance, and the right fact for per\nsonating the desired individual as a spirit. According to all physical\nlaws, and possibly this is confirmed by experimental telepathy (Pro\nceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 536-1596), the nearer subjects ought to receive\nthe benefit of the greatest intensity, and so to impress the medium, or\nto be the sources of her impressions. But this appears not to be the\ncase. Her facts are selected pertinently to her object without regard\nto space limitations, or the laws for the propagation of physical energy.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 141\nNobody seems to have any influence upon her \" subliminal \" but the\nright person in the world, and that person unknown to her. One part\nof a sentence is gotten with great difficulty from the sitter's mind, and\nthe other with ease from some mind at any distance, in spite of the\ndiminished intensity. Now there is not one iota of evidence for any\nsuch capacity in the whole domain of physical science, and there it\nmust be found before reducing these phenomena to that explanation ;\nnor is there any trace of such a process in the mental world outside\nthe phenomena of psychical research, and these cannot be invoked\nagainst themselves. Hence, without the slightest trace of the limita\ntions to the propagation of physical energy, telepathy must either be a\nprocess that belongs to an immaterial world, or it is a new physical\nforce, mode of motion, or what not, that is both an exception to all\nknown physical facts, and shows an intelligent selectiveness which\nbaffles all conceptions of mechanical phenomena, while it conforms to\nphysical facts in the law of propagation. In the former case the\nspiritual world is won in some form ; in the latter we have a\nmongrel conception which is neither physical nor spiritual, but\na mere makeshift in words that is without evidence and without\nintelligibility.\nWere we dealing with the phenomena of apparitions and coin\ncidences of the non-experimental sort, the objection from the analogy of\nwireless telegraphy might have more weight. For in these phenomena\nwe might say that we are not likely to discover, and it might be\nimpossible to verify, the existence of the coincidences themselves\nlooking toward telepathy, were it not that the intercourse of friends\nreveals them to us. Our complete ignorance of experiences on the part\nof other persons that might be coincidental makes those which we\ndiscover through the intercourse of friends appear more selective than\nthey really are. How do we know, for instance, that in our dreams\nand frequent thoughts, or our hallucinations, we are not recipients of\ninfluences from other minds on ours, under conditions in which it is\nimpossible to determine the source of the impressions 1 May we not\nhave many coincidental experiences, but only occasionally discover\nthem from our intercourse with our friends ? The law of the distribu\ntion of energy may then hold good for telepathy, and we may have less\nright to suppose the selective character of apparitions and coincidences\nthan we are in the habit of taking for granted. All this is purely\nspeculative and a jtriori, and is far from being a tolerable belief or\npossibility to me, and, besides, assumes the supernormal to begin with.\nI think there are abundant reasons in the nature of apparitions and\ncoincidences, compared with ordinary dreams and hallucinations, not\nto press the hypothesis that the latter are ever coincidental for lack of\nthe evidence to the contrary, and hence I shall not dwell upon that\n\f142 [I'ART\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nquestion. I am anxious only to recognise what a telepathist might\nadvance in his defence, as against spiritism, in the field of apparitions\nand coincidences. It is the argumentum ad ignorantiam which is used\nto diminish the importance naturally assigned to spontaneous coinci\ndences and allied phenomena, and which certainly has its weight until\nwe can show that, even in this field, it is either not applicable at all,\nor is so only to a very limited extent. But it is far more plausible\nthan it appears, and while we may grant it all the importance imagin\nable for it in the field mentioned, it completely ignores the circumstance\nthat no comparison with the Piper phenomena is possible in the case.\nThe Piper phenomena are experiments, complete in themselves, and\nare not spontaneous occurrences. As experiments they ought to\nexhibit that access to the proximate emanations of thought, as in\nthe physical world, instead of the remote, and should not be selec\ntive at all, if telegraphy after physical analogies is to be the\nexplanation. But they indicate nothing of the kind, and no argumen\ntum ad ignorantiam prevents our assuming them to be really as\n-selective as they appear. Hence the process, if telepathic and under\nspacial limitations as to intensity and distribution, nevertheless dis\nregards the whole universe of consciousness, except to select at any\ndistance and without regard to the known laws of mind the facts that\nare pertinent to the supposition of personal identity. This teleological\nfeature of the process destroys the right of concession to mechanical\nanalogies in any respect, while the exclusion of proximate influences\nupon the results appears to contradict even the supposition or possi\nbility of any resemblance, even of the a priori sort, to the distribution\nof\/physical energy.\n| (3) Another objection to the telepathic theory is the incompatibility\nof the various confusions and mistakes with the enormous power that\nmust be assumed for its selective nature and its defiance of space\nlimitations. This argument -has two aspects. We may assume that\nthe subliminal of Mrs. Piper is itself deceived as to the nature and\nsource of its information, and compare the power implied in its successes\nwith its limitations implied in its mistakes. On the other hand, we\nmay assume that this subliminal is not deceived, and that it is an\nextremely acute intelligence, capable of understanding its object and\nconsciously making its selection with reference to its purpose. We\ncan then compare the mistakes and errors with this assumption of\nsupernormal intelligence. Taking the first assumption, a power which\nonly falls short of omniscience in. its discriminative, selective, and\nacquisitive action ought not to stumble and become confused at some\nsimple fact indefinitely less difficult than the hundreds in which it\nsucceeds. Of course, the reply would be that the \" conditions \" cause\nit, and this must be accorded its a priori weight, for the reason that\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 143\nwe are really too ignorant of the \" conditions \" to plead them any\nmore in defence of spiritism than in defence of telepathy, except as\nthey are and must be more complicated on spiritistic assumptions. If\nthe nature of the facts favours that conception of the \" conditions \"\nthat must necessarily attend spiritistic phenomena, we may decide the\nbalance in that direction. Otherwise we are engaging in a priori\nspeculation on either side. But nevertheless I think there is one fact\nthat makes the plea more cogent for spiritism than for the alternative\nview. It is that the difficulties in the communications exhibit evidences\n\u25a0of a disturbed memory precisely as we should expect to be the case in\nthe severance of a soul from the organism. We may accord that the\ntrouble with proper names is as easily explainable on one hypothesis as\non the other, a concession, however, which may be of very doubtful\npropriety, and is made only to concentrate the argument upon a more\nassured basis. But when the confusion is exactly like that of a person\nwho has difficulties with his memory, and when it also coincides with\nwhat must necessarily be assumed on the spiritistic theory, namely,\nobstacles to communication of any kind, we find that there is no sug\ngestion of a specifically known cause in the \" conditions \" between\nmedium and sitter, but only on the side that conforms to spiritistic\n\u25a0conceptions. Or, perhaps, to put the case in another way, if \" con\nditions \" are to figure in the matter, they indicate mental conditions\nsubsisting rather in the communicator than in the relations between\nthe sitter and the medium. The telepathic theory must assume that\nthe \" conditions \" concerned subsist between two or more brains or\nminds, even though it possibly allows for oscillations of power in the\nmind or brain of the medium.\nThere is no trace of such oscillation as affects the issue in the mind\nor brain of the sitter, as the whole record shows, and we may well\nraise the question whether it is in any respect different with that of\nthe medium, thus throwing the whole responsibility for difficulties upon\nwhat intervenes between the two brains or minds. But conceding this,\nthere was, as I was careful to observe at the sittings, no discoverable\ntrace of a definite correspondence between any real or supposed\noscillations of my thoughts and the observed oscillations and intermit-\ntences of Mrs. Piper's subliminal. Both these facts are a presumption\nin favour of the spiritistic theory, unless we assume oscillations that we\ndo not know anything about in the subliminals of both sitter and\nmedium. But what telepathy cannot easily account for, if we concede\nany weakness in the presumption just indicated, is the fact that this\noscillation of the conditions in the mind of the medium, necessar}- for\ngood \" communication,\" should so uniformly be avoided in the\nphenomena of secondary personality when non-spiritistic or non-\nevidential and yet assume the role of illustrating, in all its strength\n\f144 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, PhD.\nand weakness, the character of a memory independent of the brain or\nmind of both sitter and medium when the phenomena purports to be\nspiritistic. That is to say, while we can discover some very general\nresemblances between the fluctuations of acquisition in experimental\ntelepathy and the intermittent messages of the Piper record, yet there is\nin the latter an intermittence of a very different kind. It is the inter-\nmittence of dramatic play and of different personalities, necessitated\nperhaps by the obstacles to communication of any sort, if the time is\nto be occupied by relevant work at all. But such dramatic intermit\ntence of personality seems to be neither a fact nor a necessity of the\ndifficulties and fluctuations attending the supposed processes going\non between percipient and agent in experimental, and possibly\nspontaneous telepathy. This is a fact in the mixture of truth and\nconfusion in the communications which telepathy cannot face with\nconfidence. To do so it has only to still more extend the powers that\nhave already been stretched beyond the breaking point. (Compare\nProceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 362-394.)\nTaking the second assumption mentioned above, how can the inci\ndents that are false be reconciled with the remarkable power of dis\ncrimination and selectiveness that have to be assumed in telepathy in\naddition to its defiance of space and temporal coincidence?(^Ve have three\ntypes of incidents to deal with : The true, the false, and the indeter\nminate. \\ Whatever judgment we entertain about the indeterminate as\npossibly true and accessible to the telepathic hypothesis, we cannot say\nthis of the false, especially those errors that just miss being true. A\npower of such magnitude and assumed acuteness in the discrimination\nof the true from the false, in its effort to convince us of the existence of\nspirits, ought not thus to contradict itself and forfeit our confidence in\ntelling what it ought to know is false. The process is fabrication\npure and simple, whether we choose to call it unconscious and irrespon\nsible, or conscious and unveraeious. Such action reflects on the\ncapacity and intelligence of the subliminal, and to that extent creates\nsuspicion of its ability really to account for the successes by telepathy.\nWhen it comes to disposing of the indeterminate cases, we force tele\npathy into a dilemma. If the indeterminate incidents are admitted\ninto the class of the true, we by so much enlarge the evidential facts\nbeyond my own knowledge and the extent of the telepathy required\nto meet the case, giving it instantaneous power over the memories of\nwidely separated and unrelated parties. On the other hand, if we\nclass them among the false incidents, we have to assume defective\npowers in telepathy that are incompatible with those shown in\nobtaining the truth, so that the only theory that is consistent\nwith the facts is that which assumes the possibility of error in\naccordance with what we know both of the difficulties in the way of\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain 'Trance Phenomena. 145\ncommunication and the finite powers of the human mind, especially in\nthe field of memory.\nThese general arguments against telepathy may be reinforced\nby a few specific instances of mistake. I shall refer here to only a few\nof them, as the whole subject comes up in a later topic, and in an\nentirely different aspect.\nThe first interesting illustration is the passage in the sitting for\nDecember 24th (p. 317), in which my uncle shows his curiosity to know\nwho Dr. Hodgson is. On the telepathic theory there should be no\ndifficulty in this. Dr. Hodgson ought to be known by this time by\nboth the supraliminal and the subliminal of Mrs. Piper. In fact both\nG. P. and Rector recognise him without failure on all other occa\nsions. But here they must be supposed either to be ignorant of him or\nto be intelligent enough to simulate the actual facts of the case, so as\nto make their spiritistic claims more cogent, and thus contradict the\nuniform consistency of their character as honest personalities. That\nsupposition requires us to add a rather amazing hypothesis to telepathy\nin order to use the latter at all.\nAgain, take the complicated passage in the communications of my\ncousin, Robert McClellan (p. 422). He had evidently tried to give\nthe name of his wife, Lucy McClellan, and some incident with it, but\nhad to leave before he succeeded, and Rector told him to \" go out and\ncome in with it again,\" and then explained to me that my cousin had\nsaid something about Lucy, also remarking, against all excuse from\ntelepathy except to make it \"magnitude incompatible with its\nerror, that this message was not for Miss Edmunds, who is Dr.\nHodgson's assistant secretary, and whose name is Lucy. In a few\nminutes, responding to Dr. Hodgson's request to state explicitly who\nthis Lucy was, Rector said that my father and sisters had brought her\nhere several times, thus implying that she was a would-be communi\ncator. Now the facts are : (1) That the person who was alleged\nto have been brought several times by my father and sister to com\nmunicate was my aunt, if we can assume that it was any relevant\nperson at all ; (2) that I knew perfectly well what \" Lucy \" was meant,\nand only wanted the surname given for completeness ; (3) that this Lucy\nis still living. In the face of such facts telepathy is in inextricable\nconfusion and contradiction.\nA similar mistake is committed in regard to this name in one of my\nbrother's communications. He had to leave just as he succeeded in\ngiving the name Lucy (p. 465), and Rector, evidently remembering\nthat Dr. Hodgson had asked for explicit information regarding the\nname, said at once, \"I got it all but the Hyslop.\" This was perfectly\nabsurd from my standpoint, but quite natural and excusable for\nRector. The facts are : (1) that there is not and never was such a\nL\n\f146 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nperson as Lucy Hyslop ; (2) that my brother was trying to say Lucy\nMcClellan, the name of the wife of Robert McClellan, her deceased\nhusband, and one of the communicators. Both the name of this Lucy\nMcClellan and the fact that she is still living were in my mind and\nmemory all the while, so that there is no excuse for telepathy in the\ncase. A finite spirit might commit such an error in interpretation,\nespecially as my brother had a few moments previously mentioned my\nsister Lida.\n(i) There is another difficulty which I cannot but regard as a\nmost serious objection to the telepathic hypothesis. It is the differ\nence between communicators in the matter of clearness while the\ndata in my mind from which telepathy is supposed to draw are the\nsame for all. (Compare Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 362.) My father,\nmy brother, my sister and my uncle James McClellan were clear\ncommunicators, but my cousin Robert McClellan and my uncle James\nCarruthers were exceedinglv confused. The data in my memory exist\nthere in the same way for all of them, to say nothing of the incidents\nnot there at all, but in the memories of persons at a distance. But a\nfaculty that ignores all distinctions between the supraliminal and the\nsubliminal, between what is recognised when recalled, and what is\nwholly forgotten and unrecognised when recalled, and between the\nknown and the unknown to the sitter, can plead no extenuations\nin behalf of limitations determined by any known differences of\ntemperament or feeling in regard to the different communicators. We\ncannot plead any social habits and affections. But if we could plead\nthem it would make no difference, as the uncle with whom I\nhad spent so many delightful hours in conversation on all sorts of\nsubjects does not give me a word and does not appear at all. Nothing\nis obtained but a statement by my father implying his death.i Also\nmy mother, endeared to me by affections and memories that have\ni 1 refer to several allusions in which the death of this uncle, the husband of my\naunt Nannie, was implied, but not stated. On December 24th (p. 316), just after my\nuncle Carruthers had communicated, father said, \"I wish you would tell the girls\nthat I am with them in sorrow or joy. What is their loss is our pain.\" The use of\nthe plural in both the noun and the pronouns, the word \" sorrow,\" and the connection\nof the message with the aunt Eliza who had just lost her husband, indicates a\nprobable reference to my aunt Nannie's bereavement. Were it not for the probability\nthat the name \" Mannie,\" in the sitting of December 27th (p. 1342), more probably\nrefers to my stepmother than to my aunt Nannie, I might suppose a similar reference\nto this aunt's loss in the sentence, \"Tell ttiem to trust in God always.\" But the\nexclusive reference to aunt Eliza in the promise of comfort in her sorrow makes the\ninterpretation doubtful. Then at the sitting of June 1st, in response to my question\nput to father, whether he had seen anyone in whom aunt Nannie was interested, the\nreply came: \"Yes, I intend telling you about him before I get through, .Tames.\"\nBut not a word came during the next four sittings, though he died four weeks\nprevious to my uncle Carruthers, and I was actually prodding Mrs. Pipers's\nsubliminal both telepathically and by direct suggestion.\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 147\naffected my whole life, communicates so little that it is not worth\nwhile to give her a separate place in the summary of facts. On the\nother hand, my cousin, with whom I had far less to do, and between\nwhom and myself only one letter overpassed, is a frequent though not a\nclear communicator. And my uncle James McClellan, about whom I\nknew very little, though always fond of him, especially for the chance\nto see the cars when we visited him, told me mostly things that were\ntrue and yet unknown to me. Scarcely anything of evidential note\nexisted in my memory, or in that of any living person, regarding my\nbrother Charles and my sister Annie, and yet they were among the\nclearest communicators from the start, and what they communicated in\nmany instances was not associated with them in my memory. This\ndifference, therefore, between communicators is precisely what might\nbe expected from the existence of a personal equation in a discarnatc\nspirit affecting its ability to communicate, an equation that has abso\nlutely no evidence for its equivalent in the memory of the sitter. On\nthe contrary, the evidence is strongly against its supposition in the\nfacts mentioned above.\n(5) There is another objection to telepathy independently of the\nquestion regarding its magnitude. It is the peculiar inconstancy of the\ncommunications, and the changes from one communicator to another,\nrepresenting, apparently at least, the existence of conditions which\nmight more naturally produce aberration in spiritistic than in telepathic\nmessages. We can see no natural reason for the interruptions and\nchanges of \" communicators \" on the telepathic hypothesis, or for the\nconfusions and alleged explanations of them by the conditions of com\nmunication at all, if spiritism is not true. From what we have seen\nof experimental telepathy it is not accompanied by any such fluctua\ntions of ability to communicate by the agent, or to receive information\nby the percipient in simulation of spiritistic realism, as are marked in\nthe short intervals of communication from a given person through Mrs.\nPiper. There is just enough of failure and confusion, rise and lapse of\ntelepathic access, in ordinary experiments, to suggest that perhaps if\nwe knew more about it we might discover the same phenomena in it as\nin the case under our study. But at present there is not the slightest\nclear resemblance, except in the general fact of fluctuation, between the\ninconstancies and changes of communicators in the Piper case, and what\nmrght be called variations in experimental telepathy. There is nothing\nin the conditions of incarnate life, so far as we know it, to favor an\nintermittent character for telepathic acquisition. Of course we have to\nrecognise that theargumentum ad ignorantiam, at least in general, favours\ntelepathy as much as spiritism, because we know nothing more empiri\ncally of the conditions for one of them than for the other. But I think\neveryone will admit the greater probability at least, if not the certainty,\ni. 2\n\f148 [PAET\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthat the conditions of communication from the dead in a transcendental\nworld would more naturally exhibit difficulties and the necessity for\nintermittent messages than the conditions of telepathic communication\nbetween the living. The reason is apparent, and that is that on such\na supposition we should have one more world, and its complications to\nreckon with, than in telepathy. This ought to be self-evident, were it\nnut for our ignorance of telepathic conditions, on the one hand, and for\njust enough of what may be called inconstancy in them on the other, to\nsuggest the utmost caution in declaring with any haste or confidence\nthat there is a qualitative difference between the Piper case and experi\nmental telepathy. The supposition of their essential difference may\nturn out false under further study, but it consists much more with what\nwe know and must necessarily expect from the physiological point of\nview of the disturbing effects of death, assuming the existence of a\nsoul, than with what we should expect from secondary personality and\ntelepathic access. Until this distinction is removed the probability\nthat intermittent messages are more consistent with spiritism than\nwith telepathy must remain.\nThe cogency of the argument from inconstancy is just this. By\nsupposition telepathy cannot sustain its acquisition continuously, but\nmust be conditioned by something like the limitations to continuous\naction that are claimed for spirits. But when we look at the facts it is\nbut a change of communicator and not a change in the telepathic\naccess. If the telepathy can be continuous it is absurd to alternate\nthe communicators. The facts of continuous access to the sitters' or\nothers' knowledge is sufficient proof that telepathy cannot claim the\nimmunities that go to the supposition of spirits without first showing\nthat the limitations exhibited are due to something else than the\nmere fact of telepathic action.\nThere is also an important concurrent fact in our favour which\nconfirms the position here taken, and it is ostensibly connected with\nspiritistic phenomena independently of the Piper instance. This fact\nis that the large number of apparitions purporting to be phantasms of\nthe dead show no tendency on the part of the supposed spirit to remain\nlong under \" material \" conditions. They are quite uniformly represented\nas vanishing in a short time. Whatever the explanation of them\nthey have this very singular and perhaps significant resemblance to the\nintermittent and brief communications in the Piper phenomena, the\nmanifestations in her case varying with circumstances and conditions\nhaving no apparent relation to any known \" material \" causes, and\nabout which we are hardly entitled yet even to speculate. But the\nresemblance in this one particular between the experimental and the\nspontaneous phenomena which assume the aspect of spiritism is at least\nto Ik? remarked as indicating their consistency, and in each case it\n\fXU.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 149\nseems to present greater difficulties for the telepathic than for the\nalternative theory, if we are to admit that the conditions are more\ncomplicated in the one than in the other.\n(6) There is another strong objection to the telepathic hypothesis.\nIt is the inconsistency between the hypothesis assumed to account for\nthe difficulties of the telepathic access, and the fact that this access is\njust as often easy and prompt, exhibiting all the readiness and perti\nnence of ordinary conversation. In nearly all the sittings I remained\npassive, and avoided asking questions as far as possible, in order, first,\nto prevent any influence from suggestion upon the facts given, and,\nsecondly, to allow the communicator to tell his own story, which we\nhave learned is a way to prevent confusion until experience on the part\nof the communicator facilitates ready messages. When I asked questions\nthe communicator was usually allowed to answer them at his pleasure,\nto choose whether he should do it at once or at a later time. This\nmethod avoided confusion and suggestion at one stroke. But the facts\ngiven under such circumstances are more likely to be explained by tele-\npathy, on the ground that the medium has to take time and effort to pick\nout the right facts in my memory. In this way the confusion may be in\nterpreted as a device of the subliminal to gain time. This supposition, of\ncourse, is purely a priori. But if in extremity it is advanced we have\nto meet it. Consequently, I propose a formidable difficulty to this\nway of looking at the matter, especially after having assumed\nsuch enormous powers as we found necessary if telepathy be our\nresource. If, therefore, you can get the communicator clear enough\nto carry on a tete-a-tete conversation involving either an exemption\nfrom confusion or an immediate answer to your questions, a double\nobject is gained. First, you are drawing, or seem to be drawing,\nupon a fund of knowledge that is not left to itself to work its way\ninto expression, but is started in the natural channel of an independent\nmemory by an appreciative mind, and, second, you show that confusion\nis not necessary to the selective process, but is a mere incident of\nthe conditions that 'render communication difficult. Thus you do\nnot conceive the problem as one of fishing about in the sitter's memory\nwith pains and effort for the right facts, but as the spontaneous recol\nlection of another subject, as in ordinary intercourse. Hence, if you\nstill resort to telepathy, you have to reverse your judgment of the limi\ntations assumed to account for the hesitating answers to inquiries, an\nassumption made in contradiction with enormous powers supposed for\nother purposes, and thus we should have to conceive it as capable of\nthe immediate acquisition of the facts. Thus there would be no\nexcuse for the theory of confusion, and the necessity of arbitrary\nselection of the incidents from the oscillating processes of mental action\nand memory, whatever such imaginary processes are.\n\f150 [PAKT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nNow my last sitting especially illustrates this view of the case. It\nis a perfect type of telephonic conversation. I suggested topics about\nwhich to talk or to send messages, and the responses, representing often\npertinent incidents of a very special character and wholly outside my\nmemory and knowledge and comprehending every shade of complexity,\nindicate such action as would impose a still greater strain upon\ntelepathy. The play of an independent mind so distinctly imitated is\nvery far removed from the notion of a subliminal, either self-deceived\nor intentionally deceiving others, fishing around under difficulties for\nfacts. In reality the difficulties in communication, under the stress\nof the consciousness that the communicator was enjoying his last\nopportunity for some time, were apparently far less than before, and\nthe conversation was almost without a break, the interest being\nheightened by my resolution to break the long silence that I had\nmaintained. This being the case we cannot apologise for telepathy on\nthe ground of impeded acquisition, but have to assume powers in it\nwhich make its mistakes and limitations appear absurd and inconsistent.\nOne can understand from ordinary psychology why a man endeavouring\nto communicate at a telephone under great difficulties should halt at\nthe irresponsiveness of the man at the other end. Hut if the receiver\ndoes enough to stimulate attention and interest at the communicator's\nend, the difficulties would be less embarrassing, and the intercourse less\narbitrary except as the receiver made it so. This describes in telephonic\nphraseology and ordinary psychology just what took place in my last\nsitting. This difference between sittings without questions or suggestion\nof topics, and those conducted on the plan of mutual conversation is a\nvery important fact in determining the range of power which must be\nattributed to telepathy in order to meet the case, since it is exactlv the\nsame kind of fact which we meet in actual life, while the extensive\npowers assumed for telepathy are not what we observe in actual life.\nIt brings into clear light the incompatibility of such a power with the\nmistakes and confusion observed, while the spiritistic theory, on any\nprinciple of continuity and on the assumption of the known powers\nand limitations of the human mind, reveals no difficulties in the case\nthat are not naturally explainable in a perfectly rational way, even\nif a little a priori and defective in evidence of the conditions that it\nhas to assume on the \"other side.\" The mind of the communicator\nbeing finite and admittedlv liable to errors, and not requiring anything\nmore remarkable or miraculous than the ordinary processes of con\nsciousness, would most perfectly consist with any amount of confusion\nand error.\nx^T^jThere is another important objection to telepathy. If there\nbe any supposition whatever that is necessary for that hypothesis to\nmake, it is that the point de repirc for the telepathic acquisition from\n\fxu.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 151\nliving consciousness, and for the application of its omniscient selection,\nmust be the name or memory of the person who is to be represented as\ncommunicator, so that it can appropriate all the associates with\nthat name and personality, though it actually discriminates against the\nmere thought of the subject about the person represented. Telepathy\nhas to have some rational power of discrimination and selection in\norder to effect its simulation of personal identity. The only plausible\nsupposition within the range of known psychology for this cue to work\non is that it is the name or the sitter's memory of the person to be\nrepresented. But this assumption is completely wrecked on the fact\nof intermediaries that have no associations whatever in the memory\nof the sitter with the incidents selected and sent to prove the identity\nof some one else. This was a special characteristic of the communica\ntions by my brother and sister, and occasionally by my father.\nRector in a few incidents acted the part of intermediary, and so also\ndid G. P.\n(8) Another point may be made against telepathy in its failure to\nutilise its opportunities for producing more than it does from the\nmemories of distant and unknown persons. If telepathy he the\nprocess explaining the phenomena, and if it has transcended the\nknowledge of the sitter in the instances mentioned, it can in\nstantaneously select any person in the world that it pleases and\nfrom that person select with perfect discrimination the one fact\nneeded to complete a message obtained only in part from the sitter.\nKnowledge of this kind, or, whether we speak of it as knowledge or\nnot, a process with this power, ought to be able as easily to dispense\nwith the memory of the sitter altogether, as presumably on this theory\nwas the case in Dr. Hodgson's sittings while I remained in New York,\nand to make out its communications from any number of persons not\npresent and thus avoid suspicion for its weakness. But in no case\nwhile I was present did it appear to consciously and regularly\nsimulate any such powers. The point de repere for association\nwas, not the sitter's natural expectations or point of view, but\nthe natural interest of the communicator in the incidents that\npertained to his memory of the individuals to whom he wished to\nidentify himself. This is the natural law of association. When A.\nmeets B. his recollection and conversation take the direction, not of\nhis intimate life with C, but of what pertains to B. Meeting D. it\nwill be different from both B. and C. These three persons would in\nsome way have to be connected in their experiences in order to have\nany natural play of association about them when one of them is in mind.\nIf C. never knew B. he is not likely to be thought of when A. who knows\nC. talks with B. Now telepathy would have to be intelligent enough\nto discover this peculiarity in ordinary mental operations and imitate\n\f152 [part\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nit here in the selection of the persons and incidents at a distance in\norder to avoid doing what I have said ought to be expected of so\nimmense a power. While it is playing the rble of the infinite in the\nsimulation of personal identity by its correct selection of the point dc\nrepere in relation to the sitter, why does it not keep up this role in a\nway to defeat the objections, which it should know can be and are\nraised against spiritism in the choice of most of its messages from the\nmind of the sitter ! It could as easily reproduce personal identity by\naccess to distant minds as by relying so generally on that of the sitter, and\nat the same time escape the accusation made against it. But in spite of its\nsupposed power to defy space and temporal coincidence it goes just far\nenough to show that it contradicts its reputation for infinite capacities\nby assuming the limitations of spiritism. It can discriminate with\ninfinite shrewdness for its purpose in the treatment of the sitter's\nmind, but is not astute enough to play the game in reading distant\nminds which would tend more to acquit it of the suspicions that\nhamper its effort to prove spiritism ! If, while it is rummaging with\ninstantaneous precision about the whole universe of consciousness, it\nwould only show its ability to disregard the sitter s mind altogether\nand reproduce {lersonal identity without reference to the principle of\nfinite association and the point dr, re\/iire most natural to a human\nspirit, we could accord the process the right to suggest greater diffi\nculties than it docs. But it is precisely the extent to which it actually\nfulfils the conditions of the spiritistic doctrines in all its multitudinous\nand detailed complexity that deprives it of its controversial rights. It\nimitates spiritism in the reproduction of personal identity, but its\naction is such a fast and loose playing between finite and infinite\npowers that no one can tell whether it is entitled to respect for\none or the other. Just when it seems to be proving its immensity it\nshows such limitations that its pretensions break down, simply because\nit stops short in its acquisitions from distant minds at the point which\nenables spiritism to account for the arbitrary limitation of the pro\ncess, which is not arbitrary at all if we are dealing with discarnate\nconsciousness.\n(9) Another consideration, also, that will have to be accepted under\nthe telepathic hypothesis is the fact that telepathy is only one of the\nprocesses that must be combined in order to account for the phenomenon\nas a whole. This function is a mere adjunct to other powers quite as\nextraordinary as itself. That is to say, as against the single hypothesis\nof spiritism, telepathy has to be combined with various other assump\ntions to account for the facts. There must be assumed an original his\ntrionic capacity, joined with a fiendish ingenuitv at deception, whether\nconscious or unconscious, for giving personal form to the facts tele-\npathicallv acquired, a form completelv imitating the synthetic activity\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 153\nand intelligence independent of the brain from which the information\nis presumably obtained, and apparently independent of the brain by\nwhich it is expressed. The main features of this dramatic play of\npersonality will be considered again in detail when I can urge it8\npositive meaning for the alternative theory. But it may be alluded to\nhere for the sake of indicating that there is nothing in the passive\naccess of experimental telepathy (Cf. references on p. 126) to favour or\njustify such a supposition as this wholesale power to convert telepathic\nacquisitions into the perfect simulation of independent personalities.\nEven in hypnosis the subject seems to be wholly, or at least almost\nwholly, the instrument of foreign suggestion, and though the\nsecondary personality may display the original action of the subject's\nmind in response to some suggestion, to make a speech for instance, it\nyet exhibits no trace of a tendency to appropriate the thoughts of\nothers present, but draws upon its own resources and very gener\nal!}-, if not always, shows some of the limitations in language or\nrange of thought characteristic of the primary personality. The\nhistrionic power of hypnosis, even when it represents the spontaneous\nactivity of the subject, is still too mechanical to compare it hastily to\nthe phenomena of the Piper case. On the other hand, in the experi\nments in telepathy, upon which we have largely to rely for our\nconception of the nature and range of the process, there seems to\nbe no trace of this tendency to dramatic imitation of any other per\nsonality than that of the percipient himself. Hence when we are\napplying telepathy to the explanation of the Piper case we are obliged\nto discard the conception of a merely passive access to the knowledge\nof others, present or absent, and to conceive the process as combining\nwith it the independent synthetic and organising action of the\nmedium's brain or mind in completely reproducing the personality\nof another being than itself, not in external appearance, of course, as\nthat term is too often understood, but in terms of the states of con\nsciousness which the alleged communicator can be proved to have had.\nAdd to this also the amazing amount of auto-deception as well as\nhetero-deception that is involved, though it be all unconscious, or even\nthe honest opinion of the medium's subliminal, and extend this\nsupposition to the whole census of apparitions representing phan\ntasms of the dead so as to include the subliminals of all other\npersons, and we have put a dangerously infernal agency at the very\nbottom of things from which it is impossible to recover any morality\nat all !\nThe mere statement of such suppositions would be sufficient to\nrefute them were it not a fact that some of the phenomena of secondary\npersonality show, to some extent at least, both this ingeniously original\npower of constructive mental action and the tendency to some form\n\f154 [PAltT\nJ. H.

(Cf., \"Case of\nLe Baron,\" Proceedings, Vol. XII., pp. 277-297 ; Vol. XV., pp.\n466-483 ; also the Newnham case, Vol. III., pp. 8-24 ; Studies in\nPsychology, University of Iowa, Vol. II., Some Peculiarities ofSecondary\nPersonality, by Professor G. T. W. Patrick ; Psychology of Suggestion,\nby Boris Sidis, pp. 245-268, et al.) These are sufficient to show the\nrecognition of a fact that prevents us from wholly denying histrionic\ncapacity and deception in secondary personality. But we must not\nforget that secondary personality is complicated with suggestion in\nthese cases, or in most of them, so that the responsibility for histrionic\nappearance may have to be shared, in part at least, by the operator.\nBesides, both the deception and the histrionic play show the inconsis\ntencies of mechanical phenomena, and in this respect indicate almost\na complete contrast to the Piper phenomena, to say nothing of the\ngeneral qualitative and quantitative difference between her case and\nthose admitted to suggest difficulties. There are no such limitations\nin it as in the cases quoted. It has a complete semblance to reality\nwhich the others do not have, and they on account of that defect\nbetray their spurious nature.\nThese general objections to telepathy could be multiplied by\nthe mention of several which are positive arguments for spiritism.\nBut these will come in their place. Minor points could also be\nconsidered, but I shall leave their development to the reader after\nmentioning some of them in a few sentences. First there is the\ncurious fact that time relations, as we understand them, seem to be\nobliterated, which ought not to be the case with omniscient telepathy.\nIf the subliminal has so accurate a knowledge of time relations as the\nexperiments of Professor Delbreuf and Dr. Milne Bramwell would seem\nto imply (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 414-421, 605 ; Vol. XII., pp.\n179-192), and if telepathy have half the power that is attributed to\nit, why- cannot it obtain, occasionally at least, from the memory of the\nsitter specific dates quite as easilv as tricks of phraseology ? Why is it\nthat the subliminal appreciates nothing but a before and aftei\\_or\nthe most general relations of timeT We should expect tTus~oiT^iB--\u2014\nspiritistic theory, if Kant's doctrine of space and time be true. Then\nthere is another consistent habit of the communicator In' breaking over\nthe line and occasionallv making relevant remarks about conversations\nand conditions of life on the other side that telepathy cannot reach\nwithout admitting spiritism and that secondary personality cannot\nreproduce without forfeiting its claim to superior intelligence, if the\nstatements exhibit those intrinsic absurdities by which secondary\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 155\npersonality so uniformly betrays itself and its limitations. Then,\nagain, what are we going to do with Imperator's prayers when we\nconsider the religious condition of some of the sitters ? My early\nchildhood, of course, leaves my subliminal accessible for recollections of\nthis sort, and so does much of my later experience. But then these\npetitions are not even pretended to he Tnessages to me from any one\nand so are a piece of supererogatory- display, so far as the main purpose\nis concerned.\nOn the other hand, there is a class of phenomena in this record,\nquite frequent also in other Piper records, that affords a peculiarly\neffective argument against telepathy and its adjuncts, represented\neither as like ordinary secondary personality or as variously deceived\nand deceiving. These phenomena are the communications about\npersons and things not relevant to the sitter at all, but for some of\nwhich there could have been as much excuse for referring them to me\nas in the case of the lady claiming to be my mother in the sitting\nof December 23rd (p. 308) where the facts were all false. I shall\nenumerate these incidents briefly with references, and leave the detailed\nstudy of them to the reader.\nThe first interesting case of this is the communication on\nDecember 24th, regarding a little girl who was said to be looking for\nher mother (p. 319). The girl's name as Margaret Ruth was\ngiven, and the opinion ventured that it was possibly the child of Dr.\nHodgson's sister. On December 26th Rector said spontaneouslv, and\nwithout query from Dr. Hodgson, that this little child was not his\nsister's (p. 330).\nG. P.'s allusion to some affairs of his brother Charles in my first\nsitting, December 23rd (p. 305), is somewhat similar to this about the\nlittle girl. But his messages about John Hart and Dr. Meredith, May\n31st (p. 440), are especially good instances of irrelevancy to me and\napparently of G. P.'s knowledge of the fact. No less important for\nthe same view are the trance personalities' specific communications and\narrangements regarding persons concerned in experiments and sittings\nnot connected with my own. All these are given in the natural\nmanner of reality, and free from the confusion of messages that come\nfrom those in my family (Cf. pp. 222-238).\nIn these cases the trance personalities are perfectly conscious of the\nirrelevancy of the messages to me. Compare also the reference to\nMiss Edmunds (p. 442). Why are they not equally conscious of the\nfalsity and irrelevance in other cases ? The only answer to this question\nthat can sustain any consistency with itself is either that their intelli\ngence is so infinite that it can produce just the proper appearance of the\nfinite which we wish to use in favour of spiritism, or that it is not so\nsupernatural as the necessity of using it in the successes for escape from\n\f156 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nspiritism would imply. That they should be all unconscious might be\napplicable to the discrepancies between the successes and failures, but\nthat they should thus be conscious of the irrelevancies and consciously\nhonest at points where they would have as much or more excuse, on the\nsupposition of acute knowledge, for the deceit that must be supposed\nelsewhere, is incompatible with the assumption that they can play\nany consistent role in their game. Supposing them finite, limited and\nhonest in their knowledge, as they certainly appear superficially, both\naccounts for the character of the phenomena, and distinguishes them\nfrom such secondary personalities as exhibit no proper traces of\nspiritistic zeal and consistency.\n^To summarise the argument : If we are to suppose telepathy and\nits adjuncts as the explanation of these phenomena the theory must be\nheld to cover the following facts with all their suggested difficulties.\nThere is first the wonderful selectiveness shown in its unfailing dis\ncrimination between my own personal experiences alone and the\nexperiences that were common to ine and the supposed communicator.\nThen there is the far wider discriminative selection from all living\nmemories of the facts pertinent to the identity of the person re\npresented. The inconstancy of the communications and the dramatic\nintermittence of different communicators, facts quite natural to the\nnecessary difficulties of communication itself. \u25a0 There are also various\ninconsistencies and unnecessary complications on the telepathic theory :\nFirst between the occurrence of confusion and mistake on the one hand,\nand the remarkable telepathic power on the other, that must be assumed\nto account for the successes f%etween the usual point de repere, which is\nthe proper personality connected with the incidents communicated, and\nthe use of intermediaries J^-between the successes of some communicators\nand the uniform failure of others, though the facts in the memory of\nthe sitter and other living persons are the same for all of them^and\nbetween its range of assumed power over all living memories and its\nlimitation usually to what would be the natural law of association as\nexhibited in the recall of reminiscences in conversation.' - Lastly, there\nis the self-conscious communication of irrelevant matter, recognised as\nirrelevant, and thus made incompatible, not only with its action in\nwhat is false, but also with its apparent omniscience at deception in\nother respects. ) Such a power to imitate just what we should expect of\na finite intelligence acting under such limitations as must be supposed\non the spiritistic hypothesis is a very large one. I do not say that such\na supposition is impossible, as I am aware that some prefer to protect\ntheir scepticism by leaning that way. Dr. Hodgson has stated this\n.supposition which some may prefer to hold when conceiving that Mrs.\nPiper's mind, or brain as the case may be, both in its normal and super\nnormal conditions, is in constant relation to the supraliminal and\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 157\nsubliminal knowledge of all living persons, and perhaps to some facts once\nin a living mind or brain, but not longer so, and gotten by some process\nof clairvoyance from the ether or impressions on matter. (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., pp. 393-396.) This theory is at least as large as the\nspiritistic ! I mention it only to call attention to the fact. But I may\nadd that if we are asked to produce a second Piper case before the\nspiritistic interpretation shall become respectable, is it not equally\nnecessary to produce a second case of this rare combination of theories\nbefore feeling any assurance regarding their application 1 Moreover,\nwould it not be as easy to account for a second case on this theory, as\nit is to account for the one in hand ?\n\f1.58 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nCHAPTER IV.\nThe Spiritistic Hypothesis.\n[ All that has been said in depreciation of the telepathic theory is\nso much presumption in favour of spiritism, if we assume that we have\nonly two alternatives with which to deal. But in addition to these\nnegative arguments there are several positive ones. I shall first\nsummarise them and then discuss them at length. They are: (1)\nThe unity of consciousness exhibited by the communicators, or the\nsatisfaction of the criterion for personal identity. (2) The dramatic\nplay of personality. (3) The mistakes and confusions. (A) Certain\nmechanical and coincidental features in the automatic writing of the\nmedium. \/\n(1) The Unify of Consciousness and Personal Identity.\nIn regard to the first of these considerations, I can even demand\nthe assent that the facts in this record perfectly satisfy the criterion\nfor personal identity on any theory whatsoever. It is not necessary to\nassume the spiritistic theory in order to understand the pertinence\nof the facts to the question of their original source. The difference\nbetween the theories of fraud and spiritism consists in the mere\nquestion whether the facts have been artificially acquired, or whether\nthey are the result of supernormal acquisition from spirits. The\nsource of the facts in the mind of the person whom they purport to\nrepresent cannot be disputed without impeaching the veracity of the\npersons affirming their truth, and hence the only question is that which\nregards the method of obtaining them. The testimony to personal\nidentity remains the same in any case. That is to say, the facts\nrepresent the personal experiences and consciousness of the individual\nfrom whom they purport to come. But having recognised this circum\nstance, it will be easy to realise their spiritistic import after being\nconvinced that fraud is to be thrown out of account.\nIn ordinary life the criterion of personal identity is complicated\nwith physical phenomena, upon which we usually rely, but which are\nin fact not the final test of it. But in the problem before us all the\naccidents upon which we rely in a sensible world for at least the first\nsuggestion of personal identity are wanting in the determination of the\nsame fact in an assumed discarnate spirit. No material or sensible\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 159\ndata are accessible. Our criterion must be facts that force the supposi\ntion of the unity of consciousness between the past and present\nexistence of the alleged communicator. The incidents communicated,\ntheir psychological connection, their emotional interest or pertinence\nto the person they claim to represent, and the general manner of their\nexpression ought to indicate that unity of character which we should\nrecognise in the person given, or by which in daily life we should\ninstantly recognise their proper subject and source. This conception\nof the case is represented in my experiments on the \" Identification of\nPersonality,\" where the incidents chosen from the memory of a common\nlife achieve their purpose in a very short time, and represent just what\nwe find in the Piper phenomena minus the supernormal (pp. 537-623).\nIn this record of my Piper experiments, however, it is unfortunate\nthat the general reader is less qualified than myself for appreciating\nthis unity, because he does not know as well as I the pertinence of\nthe facts, and has to use his imagination more than I have to do.\nBut the notes in which I have given the facts from my own knowledge,\ninstead of my opinion as to the conformity of the messages to my\nknowledge, ought to give a sufficiently clear conception of this per\ntinence and so to make this exposition of their unity quite intelligible.\nIt is sufficient to remark then that the true facts in the entire\nrecord, representing experiences that are demonstrably not the original\nexperiences of Mrs. Piper, will be intelligible enough to the majority\nof men for them to understand their unity and spiritistic suggestive-\nness, no matter what theory they prefer. Hence I shall not resort to\nany lengthy process of explanation at this point as to what personal\nidentity is in any metaphysical sense. I shall be content with the\nsimple view that it is a stream of consciousness that is aware of the\npast and that can, under the proper conditions present facts which the\nsitter can verify and cannot conceive to have been the experience of\nany one else. In presenting the argument, I shall call special attention\nto the facts that illustrate the case and indicate their cogency.\nWe must remark, however, that the problem has gotten far beyond\nphysiology. Only the psychologist can any longer deal with the com\nplexities and significance of the Piper phenomena. We are dealing\nwith an intelligent unity in phenomena in which we art either unaware\nof the conditions affecting them, or must assume them to be abnormal\nand yet capable of reproducing the psychological facts of a normal\nunity. To assume that the brain conditions aie normal is to cut out\nby the roots any view but the spiritistic. To assume that the brain\nconditions are abnormal, we have to nontend with-thtTfuct tliat there\n\"is no irregularity in the mental phenomena of the subject corresponding\nto*~the disintegraiion_fif ..personality as observed in insanity and\nsecondary personality generally, but a reproduction of the normal\n\f160 [PAKT\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\npersonality of some one else-_^Hence the problem is wholly removed from\nthe sphere of physiology, and it is left to psychology to deal with\nthe significant unity of phenomena that require to be explained by\nsome other process than anything with which physiology is acquainted.\nThe problem is not one of any known brain conditions, but of the\npsychological unity of mental phenomena that must be referred to\nwholly unknown physiological laws and conditions, or to hypotheses\nconsistent with the known laws of consciousness, namely, a subject\nunity like that which we know in actual life and consistent with the\nfinite suppositions with which science is accustomed to deal. So far as\nthe present knowledge of physiology affords any evidence the subject\nunity may not be anything else than the individual's brain, unless we\ninsist that the inconvertibility of consciousness with its physical con\nditions forces us to suppose a subject other than the brain, a view\nwhich I do not feel compelled to take, though I admit the possibilities\nof it. But in all the cases of ordinary life, whether the personality be\nprimary or secondary, the connection between the two streams is such as\nto preclude any attempt to treat the one as reproduction of the personal\nidentity of another individual. The unity between the two is the fact\nthat forbids this. But when the phenomena have a psychological unity\nthat represents both another's personal identity, and this of one not\nliving, we have to recognise that our problem is not physiological, or\nnot physiological alone, but first psychological, in the determination of\nthe nature and the unity of the facts independently of the brain of\nthe medium, so far as any known physiological laws are concerned ; so\nthat the contest must be between a synthetic unity reproducing the\npersonal identity of an unknown individual not living, and the\ncapacities of secondary personality with its universally recognised\nlimitations in the field of physiology. Consequently, I shall examine\nin the concrete the incidents of the present record and exhibit their\ncomplex unity in terms of what we know of memory and consciousness\nin psychology and then merely ask if we have any analogies in\npsychiatry and its physiological assumptions and disintegrating\npersonality to suggest any rational way out of spiritism as a legitimate\nhypothesis.\nLet me take first the confused passage in which my father described\nall the incidents that took place at his death (p. 327) I take a con\nfused case at the outset purposely. My notes show that there is\nsufficient correspondence between his statements and the facts for us\nto recognise that the circumstances precluded chance as their explana\ntion. The exclusion of chance suggests intelligence, if only that o\u00a3\nfraud. But as this alternative has been excluded, the incidents\nrepresent just the unity which we should expect of the alleged subject\nsupposed to have survived.\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 161\nBut there are two incidents in the group that are of special interest\nin the consideration of their psychological unity for any other view\nthan the spiritistic. The first of these is the reference to congestion,\nin the question, \" Was it congestion, James J \" I saw, the moment I\nrecognised the pertinence of this allusion to congestion, that I had an\nopportunity to test the telepathic hypothesis, assuming that I was not\nto admit chance in this one particular ; for I supposed that my father\nnever knew that congestion took place in his spasms of the larynx.\nHence I wrote to the physician who attended him in his last illness,\nwithout telling him any facts in the case, to know if he had ever told\nmy father of his congestion, or said it in his hearing, and the emphatic\nreply was in the affirmative (Cf. p. 356). Here I could not get the\nunity of telepathy as the only alternative in the explanation. The\nfacts represented a wider unity of consciousness than I had supposed\nand were just what the spiritistic theory requires. The second fact is\nthe appreciation of my question in a wholly different sense from the\none I had intended, and yet in the more natural interpretation which\nit bore. I had asked \"What was the trouble when you passed out?\"\nI had in mind the disease which my father thought he had, and as\nmy word \" trouble \" was strictly incorrect, the reply surprised me, as\nsupposing that my question referred to some personal differences\nbetween myself and my father. His reply correctly indicated that\nthere had been no such personal differences. When I explained my\nmeaning in the term \" trouble,\" the subject was taken up with the\nstrictest interpretation of the temporal clause in the question. I\nagain supposed that this reply was wrong, as I had in my mind\nthe catarrh that he had imagined to be his disease. But the moment\nthat this idea was driven out of my head, I saw the entire\npertinence of both the message and the natural interpretation of my\nquestion. Now my question may be treated as a suggestion to any\nsubliminal to choose between two alternatives in the interpretation of\nit, and I do not care to dispute that view at present. But I must\nemphasise the unity between the mental processes that both interpret\nmost naturally my question and immediately reproduce facts that are\nnot necessarily suggested by the interpretation of it as equivocal. The\nspiritistic hypothesis explains them in a very simple manner, while any\nother theory has to combine at least two, and perhaps more, processes\nin order to meet the case. If the right interpretation of my question\u2014\nand both interpretations may be considered right\u2014had been followed\nby an entire mistake as to the facts about his death, the supposition of\nsecondary personality would cover the case. But this is not the fact.\nWe have either the unity and simple action of a single process of con\nsciousness, and so most naturally a spiritistic phenomenon, or the unity\nof two wholly different processes, the existence of one of which is not\nM\n\f162 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nadmitted in abnormal physiology or psychology at all, except in defer\nence to the necessity of escaping spiritism, and even this admission\nhas to explain the fortuitous or fortunate combination of such\nindependent functions as telepathy and secondary personality without\nsupposing any normal or abnormal brain equivalents in evidence to\njustify the assumption. The argument is purely a priori, while the\nspiritistic theory requires no complexity but that of ordinary con\nsciousness and the necessary difficulties of communication in any case.\nA more striking example is the cap incident. To say nothing of its\nexcluding telepathy from my mind, which it most probably does, as not\nrepresenting anything in my knowledge, it embodies three points of\nconsiderable importance. (1) There is the frequent allusion to it both\nwhen I was present and when I was absent. (2) It was wholly\nunknown to me when first mentioned, and discarded as useless on the\nfirst occasion of its mention (p. 387). (3) It had a singular\npertinence for my father's identification to my stepmother and bears\ndistinct evidence of this purpose. The fact represented a very trivial\nand very exceptional incident in his life. Now though the name\n\"Nannie,\" which was wrong, was connected with it, I had already\nsuspected what it meant, and when I asked later (p. 478) who made this\ncap, the answer involving an allusion to Hettie's mother, though\nelucidating some confusion, indicated a unity in the case in a most\nstriking manner. There is in the case not merely the pertinence of the\nsingle fact that my father had accidentally possessed such a cap as\nis referred to, but the persistent interest in it, apparently for a purpose\nthat is entirely rational, and the final correction of the name associated\nwith it at first and the additional indication of the relationship of\nmy half-sister to the person intended\u2014both circumstances representing\na mental fact or facts independent of my own interest in the case\nand representing precisely the unity that should belong to surviving\nconsciousness and that is not reproduced in any of the evidence\nthat we have of the functions and capacities of telepathy. There is\nboth a double act of memory in the case and the synthetic action of\nan intelligence independent of my own in the way the facts are woven\ntogether to make the meaning clear. The two memories are, first, that\nof the personal experience itself, the ownership of the cap, and second,\nthe repeated reference to it during the sittings, representing an interest\nand intelligent process out of proportion to the kind of interest I took\nin it, but quite consistent with the purpose of the communicator, who,\nafter all, proved that he was right in the stress he was laying upon the\nincident. This memory from sitting to sitting is wholly at variance\nwith the photographing process of telepathy as experimentally\nillustrated even when it involves a mixture of the percipient's ex\nperiences in the reproduction. It is the natural action of consciousness\n\fxr.i.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 163 #\nas we know it. This characteristic is frequent regarding incidents\nabout which there was a desire to know if I had forgotten them, generally\nshowing an interest independent of mine and out of proportion to mine,\njust as the case should be, if we are dealing with an independent\nintelligence.\nTake also the consistency of the mental attitude toward\nmy brother George throughout the whole series of experiments,\nwhether I was present or not. This feature, however, was not an\nintentional act of memory, as in the case of the cap, where purpose is\nso evident, but it was the natural action of a mind concomitant with\nthe incidents chosen to communicate, which perhaps I can detect more\neasily than the reader, unless he can see it in the facts by which I\nendeavour to make this characteristic clear.\nTake again the answer to my question about the medicine which I\nbought for him. This was given with substantial correctness as \" Himi \"\n(Hyomei), and the spontaneous addition made that strychnine was also\ntaken. This I knew nothing about at the time, and verified from three\nsources, and did not learn that the two medicines were mentioned\ntogether in one of his letters to me until long after this verification.\nThe Hyomei was a fact in my supraliminal, and the strychnine only in\nmy subliminal, this circumstance not making the slightest difference in\nthe success. Then in Dr. Hodgson's sitting the Hyomei was correctly\ndescribed as a vapour (p. 391) and alluded to more than once in both his\nand my sittings. The independent memory here, throughout the\nexperiments, repeats the characteristic noted in the case of the cap\nand shows the complex unity of pertinence, emotional interest, and\ndouble memory. Now if the unity of the incidents were that of\ntelepathy I should in all expectation have gotten arsenic also, but\nunless the \"serris\" (p. 336) be introduced as an attempt to get this,\nand it can be taken as the attempt to give the strychnine, there is no\neffort to complete the associated facts in my subliminal. On the\ncontrary, morphine was given, which was false (p. 384). Much less\nis there the slightest trace throughout of obtaining what was the chief\nmatter of our constant correspondence, namely, politics. These little\nincidents in the letters about medicine or other small affairs are very\ninfrequent, but if we are to suppose what telepathy illustrates as its\nhabitual function in our experimental investigations, it should repro\nduce the phenomena either as a whole as in the mind of the agent,\nincluding here the arsenic and discussions about politics, or compound\nthem with the matter in the mind of the percipient. But nothing of\nthe kind is done. The selection and dissociation of a normal con\nsciousness is performed, and only those facts given which had a special\ninterest to my father in his life with reference to his disease. The unity\nof these incidents, therefore, is that of a spontaneous and independent\nm 2\n\f,164 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nintelligence acting consistently with a known past and carrying\non the natural processes of consciousness, as opposed to the mechanical\nand passive reproduction that ought to characterise telepathy, when it\ndoes not interfuse the memories of the percipient with the facts\ntelepathically acquired. That is to say the unity is not one of my\nmemory, even when I can be said to know all the facts in one form or\nanother, but is a unity outside my conscious mind produced by\nprocesses that clearly indicate another personality.\nStill another illustration of this unity is the mention of the names\nof my brothers and sisters. Putting aside the first sitting, which is too\nconfused to consider, the names of my brothers and sisters were\ngiven correctly. All except one of them were in the form in which\nthey were used in life, and this one, namely, Hettie, was the correct\nnickname for my half-sister. Though father never used this, it was\nthe natural abbreviation of Henrietta. The giving of it was associated\nwith the assistance of G. P. (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 375,\nTillie for Matilda). But these names were not given all at once. They\nwere distributed throughout the sittings and connected with incidents\npertaining to them in life, giving again the double unity and pertinence\nof synthetic character and the memory of a terrestrial past supposedly\nterminated by death and of time relations that are not so terminated,\nbut which are most natural on the supposition that the content\nconnected with them is real and not artificial. There was, besides,\nusually the proper emotional and intellectual interest associated with\neach one mentioned, and this was especially sustained throughout in\nregard to the two for whom my father had been particularly solicitous\nin life.\nThere is a most interesting incident in this mention of the names\npf the family that makes the spiritistic theory far more clear than any\nother. This fact is the curious, but natural and correct distinction\nbetween the communication of proper names in the family and the\nsame outside the family. This seems to characterise the habits of all\nthe communicators in so far as any demand existed for it. Not once\ndoes my father give the surnames of any of the family, except twice his\nown. He simply gives the Christian name, as he always did in life when\nspeaking of them, and just as all persons speaking of their children or\nmembers of the family would do. But he just as naturally and in con\nformity with his own and the usual custom gives, or tries to give, the full\nname, Christian and surname, of those outside the family when he has\noccasion to speak of them. The same habit is noticeable in my cousin.\n-He speaks of my brothers as \" Robert Hyslop \" and \" Frank Hyslop,\"\nbut never gives the surname of his wife or children. He does not say\nto me \" your brother Robert,\" as my father gives relationship instead\nof surname, but he gives the full name. He calls my father \" Uncle\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 165\nHyslop \" once to distinguish him. It is not necessary that this habit\nshould be absolutely uniform, as certain persons in the attempt to com\nmunicate might very well recognise the importance of giving the full\nname at the outset and on all occasions requiring it. This dealing\nwith names in accordance with the natural habit in life of the com\nmunicators is the action of an independent mind, and not the passive\nreproduction of telepathic photography. This is evident from the\nfact that the names of my brothers and sisters together with the\nassociated incidents are the same in my memory for all communicators,\nand telepathy ought to get the same form unless we attribute a larger\npower of knowledge and distinction than is conceivable ; it must\nsimply have all knowledge possible and be able to adjust itself rightly\nto any degree of naturalness and complexity not represented in the\nsitter's mind, but still true to habit outside that mind. That is to\nsay, the subliminal of Mrs. Piper has already recognised this habit of\nthe human race, and in addition to its infinite telepathic power, can\nvary the organic unity of the facts gotten from any mind to suit the\nhabits of the person whose name she acquires with his relationship to\nthe sitter ! When such fine distinctions as I have just remarked are\nobserved, by the communicators, in conformity with their actual\nhabits when living, we have a phenomenon that is intelligible only on\nthe spiritistic hypothesis, and any other theory does not explain at all,\nbut only makes the problem insoluble by appealing to a power that can\ndo anything because we choose to say so, when in fact we do not know\nthat the infinite can do anything. We do know that consciousness in\nits actual life does this very thing, and we do not know what telepathy\nis at all. It is a mere name for causal connection, and as a known\nprocess by which to explain the synthetic unity of consciousness it is\nturn est. The scientific requirement to appeal to known causes for\nexplanation is better satisfied by the spiritistic than by the telepathic\ntheory. That is, in one we appeal to a known and in the other to an\nunknown cause, telepathy being the unknown.\nAgain one of the most remarkable illustrations of this unity,\nindependent of what was most natural in my memory, is the system\nof incidents connected with the conversation that I had with my\nfather two years before his death on this very subject of spirit\ncommunication, and that are reproduced in all the main particulars\n(pp. 30-34). The facts are : (1) Oar conversations on the subject ;\n(2) My doubts about it ; (3) The intimation that I had explained\nmuch by hallucination ; (4) The implication that I had used the\n\" thought theory \" to explain spiritism away ; (5) The Swedenborg\nincident ; (6) The promise (not strictly true, but possibly intended)\nto return to me after death ; (7) The reference to hypnotism ; (8)\nThe allusion to the \"young woman who had had some experiments\n\f166 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nand dreams\"; (9) The allusion to \"some kind of manifestations\n(apparitions) you were in doubt about\"; (10) That these took place\non my last visit to him.\nThe general unity of these incidents is indicated when I say that\nthey do represent accurately just what we did talk about on that\noccasion except the promise to return. But the most important feature\nof it is the Swedenborg incident. The reason for this is the slight\nplace which it had in my memory, being absolutely forgotten, and\nverifiable only by the explicit testimony of my stepmother, and the\nnatural interest which the communicator shows in a work which he has\nsuddenly discovered to be like what he found in Swedenborg. That\ninterest is also enhanced by the fact that my father had all his life, as\nhe actually says here, according to Rector's interpretation (p. 386),\nshut his eyes to the facts that pointed in this direction and kept\nhis mind steadily toward his dogmatic theology. It was, therefore,\nperfectly natural and an indication of independent intelligence for him\nto seize on the incidents of our conversation and present them as\nhere actually realised in these communications, illustrating the doctrine\nof Swedenborg, who was the only spiritualist of whom he knew any\nthing whatsoever. He did not know enough of its modern phases to\ndespise the doctrine, and saw even Swedenborg in his best light.\nThat emotional characteristic of the whole set of incidents on this\npoint gives the clue to both the complexity and the unity of the case.\nWhen we consider the very little knowledge that I had of Sweden\nborg, this being limited to turning over the pages of his books once or\ntwice in my life and but for a few minutes, and to the historical\nincident of the Stockholm fire, we can see more distinctly how\nunnatural is the unity of the case from my standpoint, and how\nmuch more natural it was from that of my father, who had actually\ntalked about Swedenborg with my stepmother after my departure,\nthus showing his interest at the time in the connection between\nSwedenborg's doctrine and the subject we were discussing. Making\nthat connection again here, wholly as a pertinent illustration of the\nnature and object of these experiments, without anything but my\nsubliminal to work upon, is a suggestion of independent intel\nligence that can hardly be rivalled by any set of phenomena,\nespecially as it took two independent minds on this side to get\nany unity in the case in regard to this special incident. But even\nthen it does not get the characteristic of interest that evidently\nmarked the communicator's consciousness, but only the unity of fact\nrepresenting the truth of the incidents, while from the standpoint of\nthe communicator there is both the persistent interest in the idea con\nnection and the discovery of its present application. This last is not\na feature of my memory at all, but the spontaneous act of intelligence\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 167\nother than the passive access of telepathy and so the organising\nunification of facts in an independent mind and memory. That is to\nsay, we have the appropriate appreciation of a fact evidently thought\nabout more in life than I was aware of and interposed here in perfect\nsimulation of real intelligence.\nThis unity outside my mind again is illustrated in the incidents\ncommunicated by my cousin Robert McClellan (p. 442), in which the\nstatement calling his sister his aunt created nothing but confusion for\nme, until I learnt that it was his habit uniformly during his long\nillness to call her this in deference to the habit of his children, she\nhaving nursed him during some months. It happens to be a case also\nin which it was impossible for me under any circumstances to have\nknown the fact, as all the events occurred years after I had even seen\nthem together, and nearly two years after I had seen either of them.\nAll the relations expressed in the message were natural and true,\nbut the one incident that makes that unity rational was the single fact\nthat I did not know. (Cf. pp. 231-235.)\nI shall take one more illustration of this characteristic. It is one\nof the finest in the record. I refer to the cane incidents (pp. 397-8).\nIn the sittings by Dr. Hodgson the allusions were confused and could\nhave obtained no meaning at all for one who did not happen to be\nfamiliar with the facts, that give the clue, or who does not understand\nthe treatment of confusion in communications. But in the later\npersonal sitting the unity was indicated in an unexpected manner,\nand my investigation revealed facts that I never knew. I saw, as my\nnotes indicate, that in Dr. Hodgson's sittings two canes were possibly\nin the mind of the communicator. To clear this up I took the indirect\nway of asking a question first about another incident connected with\nthe cane I had in mind, and after obtaining the proper recognition I\nasked who gave him this cane, and the reply showed a memory of the\nprevious communication whose meaning I had conjectured, and the\nreference to Dr. Hodgson as the one to whom he had given the com\nmunication. The allusion to the \"ring\" on the cane is perhaps equivocal,\nas it may refer to the \" gold bug \" that I wanted given, and that was\ndrawn, or to the tin ring which had been used to repair the broken\ncane which was most probably the one referred to at Dr. Hodgson's\nsitting. Now in my mind these three canes were not associated at all.\nI cannot now recall seeing the broken one, though it is probable that\nI had seen it, but less probable that I had seen it after it was broken.\nI have a vague recollection that my aunt who gave me the money to\nget the cane which I sent my father told me his old one was broken.\nBut I remembered only the ebony cane of many years ago, and the\none I gave him, neither being in any way associated together, and\nmuch less with the one that mine supplanted. Here then are three\n\f168 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthings that are not specially connected in my mind, but which were so\nconnected in the mind and experience of my father, and there was\nevery reason in the world for his supposing that the mention of them\nwould prove his identity. The synthetic unity of the incidents con\nnected with those three canes would be difficult to duplicate by any\nprocess imaginable in this universe, but a human or divine memory,\nusing the last to assume that an infinite process not human might do it.\nThe various ways of using the cane indicated were incidents of which I\nwas absolutely ignorant, so that again we get a unity that consists of\nseveral interesting facts : (1) The pertinence of the facts to the\npersonal identity of the communicator ; (2) The unity between those\nthat I did know and those that I did not know and some wholly\nforgotten ; (3) The unity of the memory between the various sittings ;\n(4) The unity of facts, a part of which, and the most important part,\nwas obtaimed when I was not present, with the facts obtained when I\nwas present ; (5) The unity of facts and interests on the part of the\ncommunicator which did not exist in my mind, even when the incidents\nsingly were known to me in most of the cases. All these charac\nteristics are simple enough on the spiritistic theor.y, but incompre\nhensible on any other. The last feature is the most forcible against\ntelepathy, as it makes it necessary to confer upon that process a power\nto wholly disregard the law of association in the mind of the subject\nfrom which the facts are obtained, and at any distance in space, and\nweave them into the proper unity to reproduce the real personality of\nanother in all its complex significance. In experimental telepathy, as I\nhave all along remarked, the telepathic process reproduces what is in\nthe mind of the agent, associates and all, and does not select uncon\nnected incidents from this memory and reproduce another personality.\nBut in the Piper case we must suppose that telepathy can enjoy\nad libitum power to change from the purely receptive to the construc\ntive process of reproducing personal identity, and without any regard\nto the limitations of time and space, as this incident especially shows.\nNow such a theory does not explain. It simply makes the problem\nlarger and the cause inconceivable.\nI could pass through all the more complex passages of the record in\nthe same way, and they would but illustrate the same characteristic\nthat I have indicated in instances having interesting and important\nvariations. This characteristic is the natural unity of consciousness,\nrepresented in the terms of memory and association as known, and\nwhich we might suppose to exist in a discarnate spirit, a unity that did\nnot exist for my consciousness in the form that is presented in the\nrecord, either in my expectations or in my recognition in all cases, but\nwhich is found on examination to be most natural to the communi\ncator. This unity also represents exactly the differences of choice in the\n\fxLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 169\nincidents that we remark in common life and experience. A. never\nrecalls exactly the same incidents that B. recalls in their common life\nin all their details. The point of interest always varies sufficiently with\nthe personal equation to originate surprises and facts that one party has\nforgotten or even did not know, especially in the selection of incidents\ndetermined by the difference of interests in the events. A. recalls a\nboat ride with B. and the fact that they smoked a particular kind of\ncigar. B. remembers the ride but not the smoking. Again A. recalls a\nconversation with B. about the sale of his farm and a visit to a friend\nto whom he was going when he had the conversation. B. recollects the\nconversation, but knows nothing about the visit and only learns it by\ninquiry after being told it. This is what we have in the incidents dis\ncussed and taken from the record. They are the phenomena of indepen\ndent intelligences, and not of some all embracing mind or infinite\ntelepathy cooped up in a woman's brain.\nIt may be useful in this connection to call the reader's atten\ntion to certain significant incidents which I was at first inclined\nto attribute to wediumistic manufacture, but which turned out on\ncareful investigation to have some, I would say considerable, evidential\nimportance. I refer to the cap incident (pp. 387, 406), the special\npertinence of the hymn, \"Nearer my God to Thee\" (p. 389), the\nstrychnine (p. 337), the expression \"Give me my hat and let me go\"\n(pp. 307, 313), my father's visit to me (p. 440), the paper cutter\n(p. 379), the reference to Swedenborg (pp. 30-34), all the details of\nthe Cooper incident (pp. 51-54), and especially the reference to the\nCooper school (p. 420), and perhaps a number of less specific allusions.\nIncidents like these, which are often not recalled by the sitter, and\nwhich are as often repudiated as preposterous, are precisely the\nkind which demand the most careful examination. The mere failure\nto recall an incident is an insufficient ground on which to reject it as\nfalse or even improbable. The memories of communicator and the\nsitter, as above remarked, may not necessarily coincide in the details\nof their experience. This is perhaps a commonplace of reminiscences.\nBut it will be interesting to remark that a frequent facsimile of such\nincidents occurred in my experiments on the Identification of\nPersonality in which the communicator often felt assured that he\nwould succeed in absolutely establishing his identity by a certain\nincident which was not recalled at all by the receiver, and he was\noften identified by evidence considered less specific and suggestive than\nwhat he had chosen to be final and conclusive. As illustrations of\nthis disparity of memories let me refer the reader for comparison to\nthe following incidents in those experiments. See Questions 3, p. 555 ;\n8, p. 558; 17, p. 574 ; 21, p. 579 ; 15, 18, 22, p. 585; 12, p. 590;\n10, 15, 17, p. 593; 2, 4, p. 596 ; 14, p. 601 ; 15, p. 613. Much of\n\f170 [part'\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nExperiment VI., Group A, p. 559, and practically the whole of\nExperiment X., p. 572, in the same group, illustrate this peculiarity.\nSuch facts, taken in connection with the evidential import of the\nincidents at first attributed to secondary personality, and later found\nto have significance, rather indicate a psychological interest and unity\nindependent of the sitter's mind, and do much to strengthen the\nspiritistic theory.\nBut there is another aspect to this unity which I have not\nmentioned, but which is as noticeable in the instances discussed as in\nthose that are yet to be produced. Hitherto I have emphasised the\nunity that lies outside my mind and have raised the questions\nappropriate to such a phenomenon. But there is another aspect of this\nsynthetic unity which notes the circumstance that a number of\nindependent facts are selected to constitute the whole incident, as it\nwas stated in the statistical summary. Our experiences in life represent\nan indefinite number of objects or events connected together in a single\nwhole. The separate objects or facts have no necessary connection in\nour minds. There is nothing in the name Adams, for instance, that\nnecessitates any one's thinking of the Presidency, and nothing in the\ntwo to suggest that President Adams would necessarily indicate a\ntrue combination. Hence when we are forced to study statements\nand incidents in a record of this kind we can best test the hypotheses\nof telepathy and chance by examining this synthetic unity of the facts\ngiven. If it consists more easily with independent intelligence than\nwith any other supposition we cannot rationally adopt any other theory.\nLet me first take the incident about the old horse Tom (p. 423).\nThere are four independent facts in this instance, facts that cannot be\nput together as they are without supposing intelligence. The facts\nare : (1) The name Tom ; (2) the statement that it referred to a horse;\n(3) the name of my brother George ; (4) the implication that my\nbrother was connected with the disposal of the horse. Either of\nthese names would as easily consist with the idea of a horse as the\nother, and neither of them would suggest in a guessing mind the\nunity that they actually have in this case, and this is heightened by\nthe evident demand of Rector that the communicator be certain of his\nmeaning. One of the facts I did not know. But the unity that they\npossess exists in not more than eight living persons, and perhaps less.\nIt was not complete in my mind. Hence we cannot apply photo\ngraphic telepathy, whatever that may mean, to my mind alone ; but\nthe instantaneous selection, from some other living person unknown to\nthe medium and at the distance of one thousand miles, of the one\nincident to give the case the completeness it has, without marring its\ntruthfulness, is a fact beyond comprehension except on the spirit\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 171\nhypothesis. The process is then more than telepathy, according to\nthe necessities of telepathy itself. The medium has, by supposition,\nnot only to secure her facts in an isolated form, but to construct the\nappropriate unity. The only escape from this is the assumption that\nthe telepathic process is dodging about through the world and selects\neach whole from the individual mind that possesses it. The statement\nof that supposition condemns it, especially as it is made in a purely\na priori manner to cover facts, the utmost of which we know is that\nthey must be explained. Then if it is a receptive process acquiring\nthe facts from my mind, why not take scores of associated incidents in\nmy mind about this very horse, instead of going to the minds of others\nto complete the whole. It is, instead of this, the constructive act of\nan independent intelligence, even if we suppose the incidents selected\nfrom the memory of the sitter by telepathy. The incidents are\nselected out of a larger whole in that memory and interwoven with\nthe fact that I did not know, and all to impress me more favourably\nwith the hypothesis of spiritism ! How much easier to suppose that\nit is nothing but the natural operation of a finite and surviving\nconsciousness selecting in the ordinary way of memory what it wants\nfor establishing its identity. There are no miracles in this view, and\nscepticism has not to be burdened with a belief in the supernatural.\nA precisely similar incident is that in which my aunt Nannie is\nsaid to have helped in bringing up us children after the death of my\nmother (p. 449). The independent facts constituting the whole are :\n(1) The old home; (2) the town of C. ; (3) the name of my aunt;\n(4) the death of my mother ; (5) my aunt's living with us after that\nevent; (6) my aunt's help in bringing up us children. The\npertinence of the reference to the \" old home \" is found in the fact\nthat it tacitly recognises and implies to me, quite definitely, the\ndistinction between his home after 1889 and the place where he was\nborn and lived until the year mentioned, the change of residence\nhaving been mentioned at a previous sitting of Dr. Hodgson (p. 406).\nAs said in the note (p. 449), the phrase \"little town of C.\" is not\ncorrect in the letter, but as proper names always give difficulty, and\nthe sound of \"C\" is one of the elements of the right letter in the\nIndo-European language from which the correct name, Xenia, is taken,\nthere is no difficulty for me in recognising the intended meaning. All\nthe other factors are exactly correct. The general complexity of the\nincident would not be greatly altered by the omission of the first two\nfactors, but the omission of the others or a change in the relation of\ntime expressed would disturb its integrity very considerably. As it\nstands, the conjunction of independent facts involving the right\nrelations of time and action, and representing events extending over\ntwo or three years' time, makes a consolidated whole that is just what\n\f172 [part\n\/. H. Eyslop, Ph.D.\nthe surviving consciousness of my father would produce. The factors\nare the salient points also in the incidents of the years involved, and\nexhibit the selectiveness that is appropriate to identification, while the\nmessage shows the proper emotional attitude toward my aunt.\nStill another illustration of this synthetic unity of independent\nfactors is the passage in Dr. Hodgson's sitting for me (p. 401), in\nwhich reference is made to this aunt, my brother George, and the\nanxieties of all three of us about that brother. The passage includes\nincidents about other matters which I shall admit into the whole\nbecause they are all given in one breath, as it were. The indepen\ndent facts are: (1) Allusion to the rough country roads; (2) the\n\" coach \" (should be carriage) ; (3) reference to my aunt's motherly\nadvice; (4) emotional attitude toward that aunt; (5) name of Ohio,\nthis being his old home ; (6) name of Bartlett ; (7) name of my\nbrother George; (8) the principal of the school; (9) father's talk with\nthis principal; (10) the fact that the talk was about my brother;\n(11) my father's confessed trouble about this brother; (12) the state\nment that father left (died) with this worry on his mind ; (13) the\nfact that we three shared in anxieties about this brother. There are\nalso several unverifiable factors in the passage, and I have omitted\nthese because they cannot be in any way considered evidential.\nHere then are thirteen independent factors in a sustained message,\none of them (Bartlett) doubtful in its import, but twelve of them\ntrue and synthetically connected in the actual life of my father, the\nincidents about my brother covering twenty years of my father's life\nand emotional concern. Those regarding him represent an extraordi\nnary combination of incidents and pertinence, and they must try the\ntelepathic theory very severely because they have had, on that\nsupposition, to be selected individually from my memory and woven\ntogether into a systematic unity by an original constructive power so\nas to reproduce adequate evidence of personal identity. Still more\nastonishing must be the mention of facts pertaining to the alleged\ntranscendental world which could neither be gotten from my mind by\ntelepathy nor verified. This is a strange slip for such an assumed\npower to be guilty of, considering that it must deceive us as well\nas be deceived itself ! It requires something else than telepathy to\nplay the part of secondary personality and imitate omniscience both\nin this and the truth of the incidents, especially when the allusions to\nwhat is going on in the transcendental world represent truly the\ncharacteristics of my father and his proper emotional attitude toward\nthe difference between me and my brother, and his appeal to religious\nmethods of adjusting this difference, precisely as he would do in life.\nIn presenting this unity it is also important to note that the time and\nthought relations have a direct connection with each other in the life\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 173\nof my father, while the incidents as mentioned were not so associated\nin my memory. The direct connection of the talk with the principal\nof the school about my brother with the idea of a college suggested by\nmy question, remembering that I was not present, and the fact that\nthis talk about my brother occurred soon after sending me to college,\nare matters that supply much psychological interest to this unity.\nA similar reference to the same thought at an earlier sitting and in\nanother connection is suggestive (Cf. p. 338).\nIf I had only isolated and simple coincidences to deal with, such as\nthe mere names of the family, or coincidences without synthetic\nelements in them and connected with proper names, and if I had to fill\nthem up with meaning from my own apperceptions, the argument\nwould be very different. We may tolerate and explain the defects of\nsuch incidents, if we have gotten enough to establish our case for\nspiritism, but it is a different thing to build it up from coincidences\nthat are too slight. Thus, in my first sitting, there is quite a number\nof pertinent names\u2014Annie, Charles, Mary, Margaret, possibly Lillie for\nLuella, and Elizabeth for Eliza. But relevant as they may be,\nespecially with the description of who the Mary and Elizabeth\nwere, naming their relation to my father and mother, they cannot\nbe treated as conclusive. Of course the fact that in the whole\nseries of seventeen sittings the right names and relation to me are\ngiven of the members of the family, all the living and three of the\ndead, without any proper fishing or guessing at others, is an evidential\nconsideration. But this treats the matter collectively and not\ndistributively. But in this first sitting there is too much admixture\nof irrelevant matter to give the correct names any weight, unless there\nare synthetic elements connected with them. This does not occur\nuntil near the close where several correct facts, connected with the\nillness and death of my brother Charles, are indicated. Only at that\npoint did the facts assume any value. In all the other sittings\na name hardly occurs without the indication of some synthetic\nincident, calculated to identify the person intended, and without\nthe mention of a surname. Some exceptions occur where a\nmistake is made fixing the wrong name to a given incident\n(pp. 428, 454). Sometimes this synthetic character involves a\nwhole congeries of facts, as already exemplified. But it is more\nfrequent that some one incident is linked with another or with a\nname, such as a relationship by which the asserted or suspected\nidentity can be recognised. For instance, I am asked in one case\nwhether I remember my brother Charles. In another I am asked.\n\" How is Frank now ? \" Lida is given as the name of my sister,\nJames McClellan is called my uncle, and \" Uncle Clarke \" is said to\nhave married my father's sister. In all these instances the synthetic\n\f174 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nelement adds immensely to the force of the name, as it equally\nexcludes guessing and brings an incident into the field of evidential\nvalue. In many cases there is no difficulty in recognising the person\nmeant by the mere incident given, as it is so specific and peculiar to\nthe individual, connected with it in the memory of the sitter, as to\n\u25a0exclude the possibility of illusion. Compare the references to \"Nannie\"\nwhich I have treated as mistakes for Maggie, my stepmother (pp. 69,\n342, 365). But wherever this synthesis occurs, and it is an element\nin nearly every incident to which I have attached any evidential value,\nit constitutes the natural requisite for proving personal identity, as\nit duplicates exactly the phenomena by which we establish personal\nidentity in ordinary life, when we have not the physical accidents\nto help us or to determine our judgment. It is interesting to\ncompare this with the means of identification in the experiments\nimitating the Piper case (pp. 537-623), where the identification\nwas almost uniformly correct ivithout this synthetic element, except\nas it occurred in the accumulative and collective force of separate\nincidents. But as a general rule, if not uniformly, incidents\nleading to identification did not present this synthetic character,\nso that in the Piper case we have an a fortiori argument of\ngreat strength for evidential significance. All this is indefinitely\nreinforced by the increased complexity and constantly synthetic unity\n\u25a0of the phenomena passing as spirit messages, as they represent an\norganising intelligence which has to be assumed, not only in addition\nto telepathy, but also perfectly in command of all the association\nand disassociation necessary to reconstruct into a synthetic unity\nthe elements that make up an evidential whole, that is true to\nreality in all instances except those that are due to the difficulties of\ncommunicating and those that are natural lapses of memory. These\nlapses and mistakes should not occur at all, if that organising power\nwhich is external to the brain from which the facts are obtained, and\nwhich goes by the name of telepathy, is half so wonderful as it is\nsupposed to be.\nLet me take the following instance in which this synthetic unity is\nvery complex and exemplifies not only what has already been illus\ntrated, but also the dramatic play of personality and the personation\nof two independent memories in the same incident, so that the organi\nsation of the facts into one whole leading to the identity of two\npersons involves a wonderful selection, past all comprehension on the\ntelepathic supposition. It is the remarkable passage in which my\n\" uncle Clarke \" gets somewhat, though not badly, tangled, and is\nhelped out by my father by an incident pertinent to himself and not\nto my uncle (p. 442). In this incident the following facts are crowded\ntogether all in a few sentences: (1) Name of my sister Annie; (2)\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 17o\nstatement that she is my sister; (3) my own name in full; (4) name\nof \" aunt Lida \" ; (5) statement that she is my aunt ; (6) name of my\nsister Lida ; (7) statement that she is my sister ; (8) statement that she\nis still living: (9) mention of my father by himself; (10) his allusion\nto the name of my \" uncle Clarke \" ; (11) statement that Lida was the\nmember of his family whom he had not mentioned. All these are\ntrue facts, and I have omitted from this catalogue the two names\n(Pierce and cousin Annie) which are not correct ; because the name\nPierce, though it is evident who is meant (p. 442), is not necessarily a\npartof the main incidentwhose unity I am presenting. The narue\"cousin\nAnnie \" is probably a mistake for my \" cousin Sannie,\" who was very\nintimatewith myuncle and his family (p. 536). Pierce, however, assuming\nmy interpretation of it, is pertinent, and the mistake of cousin Annie\nis a perfectly explicable factor in the unity remarked. But the eleven\nindependent facts and relations\u2014all correct\u2014make up a synthetic unity\nwhich it would seem impossible to parallel by any means except the\nspiritistic. This is especially true when we see the organising intelli\ngence deliberately endeavouring to draw distinctions between persons\nnot associated together anywhere in my mind except at the sittings,\nand then inserting the interruption by my father who takes up in a\nremarkable relative clause the allusion to my sister as the one\nthat he had up to this point failed to mention. The allegation that\nmy uncle was confused was not a telepathic acquisition from my\nmind, because I thought him unusually clear, but the thread of\nconnection between the mention of my sister's name and father's\nmemory of the fact that he had not yet mentioned her, is just the\nkind of thing that ought to happen if we are dealing with\nspirits. In this remarkable passage we find two independent\npersonalities kept distinct in spite of the mere relative clause connect\ning them, and in addition a memory of the accusation I had made,\nthat one member of the family had not been mentioned who is here\ncorrectly indicated. The only rational interpretation of such a\nphenomenon is the spiritistic.\nI could go through the whole record in the same way, but it would\nonly multiply illustrations without making the argument any clearer.\nThe reader can work out the application of the principle to other\ncases for himself after these examples. They will all represent a con\nsistent coherence and true synthesis of facts that might be independent\nof each other but for their truth and pertinence for identification of\nthe persons who are represented as communicators. The whole\norganisation of the synthesis is independent of the mind of the\nsitter, as they are not wholes of his past personal experience in\nthe form in which they are presented as messages, but would have to\nbe selected individually as elements and interwoven into the accurate\n\f176 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, PhD.\ntrue incidents that they are by a power which is infinitely vaster than\nanything we know in the physiology and psychology of both normal\nand abnormal phenomena. But they are unities of consciousness\nperfectly simple on the spirit hypothesis, especially when we observe\nthe natural mistakes that ought not to occur at all with such a power\nas we may be tempted to assume in order to escape the spiritistic\ntheory.\n(2) The Dramatic Play of Personality.\nBy this dramatic play of personality I mean that kind of action and\nchange of content and characteristics which we should legitimately\nexpect and demand either in any change of communicators, or in\nadjusting the incidences of communication on the \"other side,\" and\nwhich occurs naturally in ordinary conversation between two or\nmore persons. It is not easy to define this peculiarity, as it must\nbe indicated only in certain apparent irelevancies and confusion\nin the course of a narrative where we note apparent incoherence or an\ninterruption of the messages, and the appearance of another com\nmunicator. The drama on the stage represents it, and so will any\ninstance of conversation between two or more persons, but in these\nnormal cases there are the physical accidents that always initiate as well\nas indicate the change before the psychological peculiarities display\nthemselves. But in the present experiments there are no physical\naccidents whatever, except that at times movements of the hand or\nchanges in the handwriting may indicate a change of personality or\ncommunicator. But very often or generally the indications of it are\neither the confusion of the present communicator or the nature of\nthe message. We have only the psychological and logical content to\nexhibit to us this play, and it is represented by statement and con\nversation partaking often of the nature of intercourse that cannot\nappear appropriate at all, except as something going on between inter\nlocutors beyond and behind the ordinary stage of activity. That is to\nsay, the whole phenomenon of these communications partakes of the.\nappearance of several distinct personalities acting together for a\ndefinite end, and in the progress of their work they meet difficulties\nand obstacles which give rise to interruptions, explanations, directions\nand reciprocal conversation with all the marks of distinct and real\npersonalities, instead of the mechanical play of the ordinary secondary\npersonality, as we know it in its various natural and artificial forms.\nThis argument from the play of personality I consider one of\nthe strongest that can be advanced for the spiritistic theory in\nso far as it verifies a previously formed hypothesis, and I shall\nexamine it at considerable length on that account. I cannot\nconsider it, however, apart from the unity of consciousness displayed\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 177\nby the incidents evidencing personal identity, but only as con\nfirming the position taken by that argument. It is not enough\nthat there should be dramatic play of personality without evidence\nof personal identity. The latter is the primary problem and sub\nordinates dramatic play to itself. The phenomena of secondary\npersonality, though they rarely display such elasticity and simulation of\nreality as the dramatic play in the Piper phenomena, are yet in\nsome cases too dangerously near it, in the characteristics that should\nmake us cautious, for us to stake the case upon this second argument\nalone. But in spite of the radical difference between the Piper\nphenomena and those of secondary personality generally I do not\nthink that we should elevate the argument from dramatic play into\nthe first rank. The criterion for personal identity must be satisfied,\nprimarily as the condition of any future life for existing beings, and\nsecondarily as the fact that gives added meaning to the dramatic play,\nwhile the latter is a consequence which we ought to expect on the\nsupposition that we were dealing with spirits instead of Mrs. Piper's\nsubliminal. I give the argument great weight, much greater in the\nestimation of the Piper phenomena as a whole than in my own sittings\nalone. But I do not give it the first importance. It is simply a\ncorollary of the argument from personal identity, as something which\nwe should be entitled to expect in a change from one communicator to\nanother, or in the action that represents anything like an attempt to\ngive unity and purpose to the management of an exceeding complex\nsystem of conditions. It is this feature of the communications which,\nin my mind, plays such havoc with the telepathic hypothesis, while\nsupporting the spiritistic. It complicates telepathy too much with\nthe assumption of omnipotence or omniscience on the part of Mrs.\nPiper's brain. We have already seen how large that supposition must\nbe made to meet the conditions of acquisition, but when this dramatic\nplay of personality has to be included in the functions of the medium's\nbrain along with telepathy we shall find that we are adding one\ninfinity to another merely to escape a simple hypothesis which only\napplies the known laws of mind to explain phenomena that bear the\ncharacter of evidence for personal identity.\nIn discussing this second argument, or illustrating the dramatic\nplay of personality, it will be best to take the order of the record and\nwatch its development as we proceed. I shall improve the opportunity\nto call attention on each proper occasion to the incompatibility of the\nfacts with any telepathic theory that is supposedly represented in either\nexperimental thought-transference or spontaneous apparitions and\ncoincidences.\nThe first feature to be remarked in this dramatic play is the\ngeneral place of Imperator and Rector in it. Every sitting is marked\nX\n\f178 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nby the action, if only for a time, of one or both these personalities.\nI do not enter into any speculation as to what they are, as a pre\ncondition of a spiritistic conclusion, however much we might desire to\nhave the question of their nature determined. Their recognition as\nanything more than secondary personalities of Mrs. Piper's organism\nmust be determined by the issue of psychical research, as I have no\ninformation leading to their identification as they appear in the\ncommunications of the present record. If the spiritistic theory be\naccepted as the most rational account of the phenomena here pur\nporting to represent personal identity, we may well accept Imperator\nand Rector to be what they claim to be, namely, discarnate spirits.\nThere is much in my sittings, more independent of them, to suggest\ntheir genuinely spiritistic character, and this without insisting upon the\nevidential incidents that are so necessary in any adequate scientific\nproof, and that are so apparent in the various individuals who are the\ncommunicators to me, and who are trying to establish their identity.\nThis evidence is the distinct, consistent, and intelligent part they play\nin the whole phenomenon, representing as complete a unity of con\nsciousness for each one of them as the most rigid sceptic could demand\nof any real person whatsoever. The whole content of their communi\ncations, their manner and their character, are out of proportion with\nanything we know of Mrs. Piper, or of secondary personality generally.\nBut I shall not assume that their personality is exempt from the same\nevidential considerations that are applied to the other communicators,\nand so must suspend the issue until the case is made out for the latter,\nas the main argument must depend upon evidence for identity. Of\ncourse, if we assume that Imperator and Rector are the secondary\npersonalities of Mrs. Piper, we have large enough powers of intelligent\naction assumed to make it all the more difficult to transcend the\ntelepathic hypothesis. Hence if a man choose to reverse the argument,\nhe may wish to say that we should suspend judgment upon the identity\nof the communicators other than the \"controls,\" until some decisive\nhypothesis has been reached concerning the latter. That is to say,\ninstead of subordinating the character of Imperator and Rector to\nthe issue of the identity of others, we may have to settle the choice\nbetween spirits and secondary personality in their case in order to\njustify the abandonment of telepathy in favor of spiritism in the case\nof other communicators. Of course telepathy is out of court in the\npersonality of Imperator and Rector, and in lieu of evidence for their\nidentity we might assume that they are merely secondary personalities\nwith remarkable powers that might include sufficient telepathic\ncapacity to satisfy the problem. But suggestive as this objection\nand way of putting the matter may be, it is right here that the\ndramatic play of personality comes in to both corroborate the unity\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 179\nof consciousness and identity for other communicators and to offer\nevidence for the spiritistic nature of Imperator and Rector against\nsecondary personality, and in spite of the lack of the evidence for\nidentity in their cases. It is simply the want of evidence for identity\nin their cases that suggests secondary personality, as in the usual\nsimulation of spiritism. But the slightest study of the communica\ntions of Imperator and Rector, especially in matter not yet published,\nwill readily disillusion the observer regarding the right to make this\nassumption too easily. The phenomena which they have exhibited ever\nsince they supplanted Phinuit are too spiritistically real in their appear\nance to be dismissed hastily, and when we understand this dramatic\nplay, which it is by no means easy to do without a series of sittings\nin order personally to see it work we shall quickly discover reasons in\nits realism to justify its subordination to the identity problem of\npersons whose identity it is possible to establish. The beginning and\nclose of each sitting will indicate why this assertion can be made and\nsustained.\n( Now in order to understand this play of personality rightly we\nmust form a clear conception of what the Piper phenomenon purports\nto be, and of its modus operandi, as described by these chief figures\nthemselves, Imperator and Rector. It must be remembered distinctly\nthat the phenomenon does not represent itself as an immediate com\nmunication with the discarnate spirit, whose identity is at issue. This\nwas not often the case even in the Phinuit regime, and can be said\nnever to be the case now. This fact is in favour of its claims, as\nit consists with the whole superficial character of the affair and\ndiminishes the chances for accusing it of deception without making\nthis so archly fiendish as to baffle all hope of finding it either\nintelligible or finite in its capacities. But whether so or not, it consis\ntently represents itself as only an indirect communication with the\nspirits whose identity is at issue. Hence it purports to be a coterie or\ngroup of discarnate spirits, with Imperator at their head, endeavouring\nto reveal immortality to man, supervising the conditions, and regulating\nthe rights and occasions of communication between the terrestrial and\na transcendental world. One of them, usually Rector, serves as\namanuensis in writing the messages purporting to come from the com\nmunicating spirit. Sometimes between him and the communicator are\none or more intermediaries through whom the message must come\nbefore Rector obtains it and writes it for the sitter, just as if several\npersons were necessary to manage a telephone. Compare the inter\nruptions of G. P. (p. 211). This situation would naturally give rise\nto the dramatic play of personality and much else besides, especially\nif the machine used had any tendency to express automatically\nwhat was going on among the group in the mutual conversation\nx 2\n\f180 [PAKT\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nand directions that might take place in the management of so\ncomplex an affair with its difficulties and misunderstandings. Any\nchange of person or actor, or confusion in the communicator, would\nreflect itself in characteristics and statements which would represent\nthe distinctive features of varying personality.\nThis is exactly what we observe in the record. The communica\ntions show precisely the differences which we should expect to find\nwhen different persons communicate. The personal equation should\nand does count in the results as distinctly as would be expected. It\nought to be apparent how this tells against telepathy, as there is no altera\ntion in the conditions of Mrs. Piper or her powers in such a matter,\nnor is there any alteration in the data in the memory of the sitter\nfrom which the facts are presumably drawn by the telepathic process.\nBut of this again. The main point at present is the distinctive marks\nof different personalities represented in the various communicators,\nin the change from one to the other. For instance, the messages from\nRector are perfectly regular when no other person is communicating,\nand no confusion is apparent except as incident to disturbance in the\n\"light,\" as they usually call the medium, or the conditions for\ncommunicating. His communications are almost wholly uninterrupted\nand free from confusion. This is true on any theory whatsoever.\nThe difference seems to correspond to the differences of real persons\nin regard to their familiarity perhaps with the conditions of communi\ncation. It is marked by a distinctness and freedom from artificiality\nthat never seems to occur in the phenomena of hypnosis and secondary\npersonality generally, especially when the physical accompaniments of\nsuch phenomena involving external changes of expression and character\nso often betray their subjective source, while here in the Piper case\nthere is nothing of this kind. This difference remarked is a suggestive\none, and must be carefully studied before rejecting its significance\nin the interests of spiritism.\nThere are two special features of this dramatic play that claim\nattention. They are : (1) The mental and moral characteristics of the\ndifferent personalities concerned, and (2) the reproduction of those\ninterruptions, apparent incoherences and confusions, and interplay of\nconversations, remarks, directions, cautions, etc., which would occur\nunder some such conditions as the phenomena purport to represent,\nnamely, situations in a spiritistic world that are exactly similar to\nthose in actual life.\nIn regard to the first of these features, the difference between\nPhinuit and the two present \" controls,\" Imperator and Rector, is\nextreme. Phinuit was in many respects a conceited and vulgar\npersonality ; not always so, but often enough to create a dislike toward\nhim. In situations trying to his temper he often displayed that\n\fxLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 181\nin inner which showed no special refinement such as actually\ncharacterises Mrs. Piper, and still less did he comprehend the problem\nas it presented itself to the sitter, so that he assumed a browbeating\ntemper, scolding like a vixen at times. He was so proud of his\npowers that he was ready and willing to undertake almost any experi\nment to show himself off, until he would discredit his own claims by\nphenomena that exhibited no bearing on his own identity or on that\nof anybody else. There was absolutely nothing of the religious\nnature about him. He was a subject quite suitable for purgatorial\ndiscipline. He had a sense of humour and was ready to joke and\nplay tricks. It is the very opposite with Imperator and Rector. They\nare nothing if not religious. Their whole phraseology and style of\nthought are intensely religious, and represent this characteristic in a\nvery lofty manner. They are, or seem to be, as lacking in the sense\nof humour as a Puritan, and exhibit a moral and religious seriousness\nthat has no equal outside the church of the most orthodox type. They\ntake their mission far more seriously than Phinuit, appreciate its\nimportance morally and religiously very much better than he did or\ncould, and exhibit no disposition to show off in remarkable per\nformances. They never condescend to wit or satire, but are as solemn\nas undertakers. Yet it is not an artificial solemnity, but one\ncharacterised by a keen and profound conception of the moral serious\nness of life and its meaning. Imperator's temper represents, in its\nphilanthropic sympathy for man, as nearly as anything I know, the\ncharacter and purposes of Jesus Christ. The main evidence of this\nlast statement is in records not yet published. There is not a trace of\nthis in Phinuit. Besides, Imperator is dignified and imperious. His\nname describes his character exactly. He insists rigidly, as generally\njustified by results, upon conformity with his orders, but his disposition\nto charity, in spite of this, for the weaknesses and shortcomings of\nman is commensurate with the infinite pathos of human life. In this\nRector follows him, but in the most obsequious obedience and\ndeference. They address the sitter in the scriptural second person.\nPhinuit never did so. Their contrast with G. P. is just as marked,\nwithout in any way identifying him with Phinuit. G. P. is a secular\ntype, a jolly man of the world, intellectually dignified and refined, but\nnothing of Puritanic piety and cant in him. I do not use these terms\nin any bad sense, but only to indicate that he does not expose himself\nto the criticism of the sceptic who does not like religious phrases.\nHe is not above a \" By Jove,\" or \" confound it,\" which you would\nsuppose might shock the sensibilities of Imperator and Rector who\nfreely affiliate with him. There is not a trace of the solemn and\nunctuous seriousness about him, but he is a thoroughly companion\nable clubman, thoroughly human, as Phinuit was in an entirely\n\f182 [part\nJ. H. Hyelop, Ph.D.\ndifferent way. He has the intellectual refinement of Imperator and\nRector without their piety and unction, and all the humour without\nany of the vulgarity of Phinuit. He stands midway in character,\nas he does in history, between Phinuit and Imperator with Rector.\nBut whatever we may think of these personalities they are in all their\ndistinctness and reality just what makes the individuality of different\npersons in real life, and the parts they play are carried out with the\nsame invariable consistency and pertinence to their claims that we\nobserve among living men in the everyday affairs of actual thought\nand conduct. These are not telepathic phenomena. They do not in\nthe least represent acquisitions from the minds of the sitters, but are\nthe characteristics of independent intelligences, and far more conceiv\nable on that hypothesis than on any other, as the farther development\nof the argument will show.\nI leave these traits just described to be studied in the record by\nthe reader and without further comment. But I wish to emphasise\nthe fact that only those who have made themselves familiar- in some\nway with the Piper phenomena, and who have very closely investigated\nthe internal connections and disconnections of the communications,\nrepresentative of these mental and moral distinctions of personality,\ncan appreciate the second aspect of this dramatic play, upon which I\nintend to concentrate the most of my attention. I simply suspend\njudgment on any conclusion that may be considered from the point of\nview represented by the personal characteristics of the parties just\ndescribed, and turn attention upon the facts in the record that both\nillustrate their peculiarities in it, and indicate a play of personality\ninvolving far more than their individualities and complicated with\nthose of other communicators. This greatly enriches the argument.\nThis aspect of dramatic play is particularly noticeable and\ninteresting in my first sitting (pp. 1S4-190). I shall examine this\nfeature of the case very fully in this sitting, because it is the one\ninstance of general confusion which would have led me to discredit\nthe spiritistic nature of the phenomena, had I stopped short at that\nsitting, in which I did not discover the dramatic play until later\nsittings threw their light upon it. I was not familiar enough with the\nmodus operandi of the case to understand the nature and importance\nof this characteristic, in spite of the care bestowed in three readings\nof Dr. Hodgson's Report (Proceedings, Vol. XIII.). But as later\nsittings enabled me to understand this dramatic play, it came\ninto more special notice and prominence in this sitting, and must\nreceive that careful examination which will show both the internal\nunity of this sitting with all others and the dramatic exhibition that\nsuggests its spiritistic character without the evidential pertinence of\nits incidents which is weak. It is all the more interesting to\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 183\nremark this play in the first sitting, because I had to reject it as\nworthless evidentially at the time. There was nothing in the whole\nsitting, except some of the statements of my brother Charles near the\nclose, that I felt could possess any claims to being either telepathic or\nspiritistic. I afterwards learned that some names and statements were\npertinent that I had rejected. But within my knowledge at the time\nand without the light of later experiments I had to treat the sitting\nvery much as Dr. Weir Mitchell, Professor Peirce, and Professor\nNorton were disposed to treat their single experiments (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., pp. 460-462, 482-3, 525-6), except that the sitting\neffectually excluded illusion and suggestion from the explanation of the\nphenomena, and I had gone especially to test these hypotheses. But\nit did not impress me as doing more than this. It appeared only as a\nmass of confusion that had no other intelligible feature in it than an\nattempt to find out who I was and to determine who should be the\ncommunicators, as was quite natural under the conditions. But\nthese very facts enhance the interest that attaches to the study of\nthe dramatic play in it.\nIt will be important to remark by way of introduction that this\ndramatic play of personality takes two different forms of a general\ncharacter. One is a dramatic adjustment to various situations in the\nconnections between a terrestrial and a supposed transcendental world,\nand the other is a dramatic interplay between the personalities in this\ntranscendental world. Both may have distinct aspects, an evidential\nand a non-evidential. The non-evidential consists in the play that\nproduces statements and incidents which are conceivably explicable\nby secondary personality. The evidential play consists in those\ninstances which reflect both the separateness of independent person\nalities and the transmission of data not referable to the experience\neither of Mrs. Piper or the alleged personality intermediating the\ncommunication. The latter is the more important and might well\nclaim an independent value. The former, however, may have no other\nvalue than external consistency with the main hypothesis, confirming\nwhat we should logically infer from it.\nBut there must be no misunderstanding the importance which\nI attach to this discussion of dramatic play. Though distinguishing\nbetween the evidential and non-evidential aspects of it, I shall not\nclaim for any of it an independent value for the spiritistic theory, but\nuse the phenomenon only as a verification of an hypothesis suggested\non other grounds. In every form it is extremely useful for determining\nthe limitations of telepathy as this is known or supposed experi\nmentally, and hence for that purpose I need not distinguish nicely\nbetween the evidential and the non-evidential illustrations of the\nprocess. Not to encumber myself, however, with the difficulties of\n\f184 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nmaking out an independent evidential case on the ground of dramatic\nplay, I am willing for argument's sake to accord it no other importance\nthan the confirmation of the hypothesis necessary to account for the\nevidence of personal identity. Hence the only vantage ground that\nI reserve for myself is the objective facts in the lives of the com\nmunicators, leaving a margin for individual opinion in regard to this .\ndramatic play, in those who have not had the personal experience of a\nseries of sittings and the study of the data which such experiments\nelicit. I am confident, however, that the dramatic play will be\nappreciated at a high value by all who take the pains to understand it\nin its details, even though they are not tempted with the conviction\nthat the spiritistic theory is the correct one. My object, not being\none to proselytise or to convince others that spiritism is necessarily\ntrue, is attained if I can only secure the admission that this hypothesis\nis to be reckoned with in the problem instead of ridiculed without\nconsideration. I can well afford, therefore, to make a chivalrous\nconcession of the argument from dramatic play to those who are so\ninfected with the generalities of secondary personality that they will\nnot take the pains to distinguish the differences. Hence it is with\nthis concessive mood in view that I examine so carefully the least\nevidential sitting in the record, partly in deference to the condemnation\nwhich I had to pronounce upon it evidentially and partly as a reproach\nto those who were so ready to indulge in negative opinions after but\na single sitting and who would not admit the a priori difficulties which\nare patent on the face of the problem. The evidential illustrations\nof it -outside the first sitting will be so much gain for the spiritistic\nhypothesis, though I need not accord them more than the function of\nrealising what we must expect of the supposition advanced to account\nfor personal identity.\nThe usual preliminaries which characterise the Imperator regime\nare conducted, as generally, by Rector in this first sitting. The record\nwill indicate this clearly. The first incident of interest is the remark\nof Rector that G. P. is coming. Then between sentences that repre\nsent some of G. P.'s thoughts and some of Rector's, there is a state\nment that he will leave G. P. to answer questions, that is to do the\nwriting in the communications. Then G. P. immediately \"steps in\"\nand addresses Dr. Hodgson in the usual way after Rector bids us\n\" good-bye,\" having said that he must give his attention to another\n\" light \" present (a remark whose significance was not explained and\nthat is not intelligible to me). The change of personality is marked\nby two features. There is first the change from the scriptural to the\nordinary use of the personal pronoun, Rector using the former and\nG. P. the latter. Second, there is the entirely unconventional, free\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 185\nand easy manner of G. P.'s mode of address, which is an invariable\nindex of his personality. It is the use of the pronoun that enables us <\nto distinguish in the messages of Rector, after saying that G. P. was\ncoming, the influence of Rector's thoughts on the communications.\nBut it is Rector still that dominates and actually explains the purpose\nof G. P.'s presence. But whether we choose to attach any value to this\nor not, it is clear that the personality is changed when Rector abandons\nthe \" machine \" and leaves the writing to G. P. This G. P. now\ncarries on a conversation with Dr. Hodgson after making a reference to\na desire to see who has come to greet him, meaning evidently myself,\nand goes on to speak of things about his brother. This has no\nrelevancy to me, and bears no characteristic of telepathy from any\none, certainly not from me. The whole passage was absolutely unin\ntelligible to me, but was clear to Dr. Hodgson, though it represents no\nintelligible telepathic content. This aside, however, as we may assume\nthat it is really telepathic, yet it is absurd on the part of the\ntelepathic subject to go at any other task than the one for which\nthis sitting was arranged. Why direct its energies to Dr. Hodgson\nwhen it knew, or ought to have known, that I was the person to deal\nwith, a fact that is acknowledged in the curiosity to see who had come\nto greet him 1 All that followed, relevant to Dr. Hodgson, is a piece\nof nonsense, supposing that the telepathic subject or percipient\nhas any discriminative power at all. The telepathic percipient is\nthere by supposition to deal with me and not with Dr. Hodgson, and\nif it is the victim of mechanical methods of procedure why does this\ncharacteristic not appear constantly instead of the intelligent adapta\ntion to a situation that betrays just what we should expect on the\nspiritistic hypothesis. The scene is realistic and expressive of a super\nsensible situation and independent intelligence carrying on processes\nwholly distinct from the attempt to acquire facts from the sitter.\nThis play is deepened in the immediate order for Dr. Hodgson to\nleave the room for a minute. The representation is that there is a\nlady who wishes to speak with him, and on his leaving the attention is\ndirected to ine.\nNow on any telepathic hypothesis, involving the assumption that\nDr. Hodgson was a disturbing influence, his departure ought to have\nbeen followed by clearer communications and access to my memories.\nBut this was not the case ! The messages at once became exceedingly\nconfused, contrasting with what they had been up to this point.\nMuch of the confusion was due to the necessity of repeating the\nwritten words because I was not familiar with the automatic script.\nBut this is appreciated from the outset, either as if the supposed\ntelepathy was not hindered by my being a stranger, which contradicts\nwith the confusion, or as if the situation was as real as it is represented.\n\f186 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nWhen Dr. Hodgson returns the conversation which goes on with him\nis perfectly intelligent, and so is the attempt to meet the difficulties\nunder which I must decipher the writing. Finally, in reply to an\nappeal by Dr. Hodgson for his remaining, G. P. yields with reluctance\nand only after the explanation that the difficulty occasioned by Dr.\nHodgson's presence is due to the attendance of the latter's friends.\nBut G. P. says that he can prevent confusion only on condition that\nhe be able to keep away these friends.\nA long series of communications follows with a number of\npertinent names and suggestive indications of relationship, though in\nspite of Dr. Hodgson's absence they are confused almost beyond\ntolerance. But Dr. Hodgson returns just before my brother dis\nappears, and then occurs a most interesting statement by G. P., who\nstopped writing messages from my friends and explained that the\nconfusion was due to the presence of three persons who were all trying\nto speak to me at once, and a lady is allowed to have her trial after\nG. P. grants Dr. Hodgson's request to remain. This lady claims to be\nmy mother, and in spite of Dr. Hodgson's presence, which is presum\nably disturbing, she delivers a series of communications that are as false\nand irrelevant to both of us as they are clear. They were perfectly free\nfrom confusion and without hesitancy in proper names. I repudiated\nthe pertinence of her statements, but it did not alter her assurance that\nshe was right and that I was her son. This is telepathy ! I reject it\na second time, and am met with the same persistence. I do it a third\ntime and G. P. expresses his ignorance entirely, indicating that he is\nmerely telling me what he hears, this not being from my mind at\nall ! Now, if Dr. Hodgson's presence is disturbing, how is it that\nother minds in the world are not disturbing when the telepathy is at a\ndistance 1\nThe explanatory interruption in response to Dr. Hodgson's\nquestion involves a reference to me in the third person, as the\ncommunicator's friend, and is followed by a statement directed to\nDr. Hodgson in the second person, all explaining the difficulties\nof the situation which was understood by neither of us until the\nissue made it clear. But G. P.'s appreciation of the case on my\nside, and the difficulties with which he had to contend on his side,\nis a most interesting feature of it at this point, as it recognises the\ndesire that I shall \" hear \" him, assuming that I shall have my\ndifficulty with the reading when the fact is that I cannot understand\nthe messages, while he apologises for the confusion by telling Dr.\nHodgson that he cannot \" half hear \" when he is present. He begs\nhim to retire, and then explains to me the reason for his confusion,\nthis being the simultaneous talking of two spirits, one of them represent\ning what is in my mind and the other not ! ! This is then followed by\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 187\nan appeal to the communicator, apparently, to come and listen and\na message is begun which is suddenly interrupted with the remark\naddressed to some one on the other side to help him keep the communi\ncator's thought clear. This is neither taken from my mind nor directed\nto me, the whole process being absurd and unnecessary on the telepathic,\nand quite possible or probable on the spiritistic. ^\nBut the passage beginning with the explanation to Dr. Hodgson is\nan interlocution in which A., speaking to B. about C, speaks correctly of\nD. as B.'s friend, while explaining his own ignorance as to its being an\nassured fact, giving this as a reason for allowing the confusion to go on\nuntil D. can be the judge of what is correct. Immediately he asks D.\nin the proper grammatical form to listen to him while he also asks C. to\nretire for a reason that is plausible on the supposition that some one\nis present who should be excluded, but which is not so on any other\nassumption. This is the play of an individual mind in a situation\nsuch as the present is described to be. The mental synthesis is neither\nDr. Hodgson's nor mine, so that if we are to give any unity to the\nwhole affair nothing is more evident than the insufficiency of telepathy\nto account for it. But passing this by as uncertain, it is sufficient to\nremark that this independent interruption of the communication, the\nevident intelligence of it, and the peculiar logical unity and charac\nteristic fitness of it to the situation, are consistent and suggestive of\nspirit action, and are so much so, that it will require the most extra\nordinary supposition of secondary personality to supplant it. The\ninterplay and adjustment to an exceedingly complex situation that\nfollows, and that is wholly superfluous on the telepathic access, which\nhas already shown its admission to the desired reservoir, is past\nall praise for pertinent appearance of the spiritistic. The dismissal\nof Dr. Hodgson, consistent with the whole history of the Piper\ncase, the explanation of the confusion that is consistent with the\nignorance of my identity and with the confusion immediately\npreceding, and the disappearance of the lady after my insistence that\nshe was an intruder, to be immediately followed by that remarkable\nsuggestion to the communicator claiming to be my brother that he\ncome closer to listen, and then, as if the greater proximity to material\nconditions effected an unconscious state, to be prodded and kept clear\n(Of. Experiments in Hypnosis, p. 635), are all a part of a complex whole\nthat is apparently incomprehensible on any other supposition than that\nit is real. This is no freak of telepathy, as the data necessary to make\nthat explanation relevant are wholly wanting. There is nothing\nrepresenting such a situation in our minds. We may resort to\nsecondary personality and its fabrications, as all scientific minds should\ndo if phenomena indicative of personal identity were not present, but\nassuming that the business of the medium's subliminal in these\n\f188 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nexperiments is telepathic, this acting is absolutely superfluous and only\ncomplicates what might be kept simple, except as spiritistic realism\ndetermines complications which are not of the medium's own making.\nFrom the point at which I indicate that the lady claiming to be\nmy mother is an intruder, to the close of the sitting, there is no inter\nruption that is not intelligible on the natural interpretation of the\ncase, but the communications proceed, such as they are, with desirable\nsmoothness and unity, except that it requires the light of later sittings\nto discover this unity and exclusion of foreign intrusion. But in the\neffort to get this condition and to secure the right communicators, the\ndramatic play of personality coincides with just such a situation as my\nprecautions must create on the spiritistic theory. In this situation we\nshould most naturally expect confusion and interference until some\nthing could be ascertained, in some way, regarding my identity, and\nthe legitimate reason Obtained for shutting out all impertinent com\nmunicators. From the telepathic hypothesis the play gets neither\nunity nor rationality in its confusion. We should have to combine\nwith that theory a number of others quite as large and quite as\nwanting in evidential support in order even to obtain a proximate\nexplanation. The spontaneous diversions and apparent incoherences\nare a part of an intolerable confusion on the telepathic theory, but of\nconsistent and intelligible unity on the spiritistic, representing it, as it\nmust be, in the form of communication under difficulties.\nThe close of the sitting was marked by an incident of some interest\nin this very connection. Dr. Hodgson remarked that we should have\nto go, saying this to G. P., and he replies : \" Wait until I get\n[Imperator] to take this young man away.\" I then arose from my\nchair and walked past Mrs. Piper to the other side of the room, when\nthe hand wrote : \" He walked right in front of him. Why does he do\nthis ? \" This was followed by a few more communications from my\nbrother, which were suddenly interrupted by G. P.'s remarks to Dr.\nHodgson that he hoped to \" get the lady clear again.\" All the rest\nexplains itself. But this play is not that of telepathy, as I did not\nknow or think I was walking in front of a \" spirit !\" I might very well\nbe asked by the secondary personality why I had walked as I did.\nBut if we attributed to telepathy the knowledge of my walking\nas I did, two insuperable objections arise to this supposition.\nFirst, this quick access to my consciousness is in flat contradiction\nwith the whole sitting and its dramatic play, which are represented\nas conditions involving great difficulties, and the confusion supports\nthis beyond question. Second, the statement that I walked in front\nof a spirit was not of a fact in my mind. Then, again, why, if tele\npathy is the process, does G. P. \" hope to get the lady clear again \" ?\nIf he refers to the lady who claimed to be my mother and was not this,\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 189\nnot only have I shut her out definitely and thus precluded all excuse for\nconsidering her again, except on the supposition that, as a spirit, G. P.\nimagines the difficulty to be in a lack of clearness ; but also telepathy,\nafter having gotten the pertinent names for communicators, ought to\nbe able to tell that the names which have no application to me are\nirrelevant, especially after I have repudiated them ! There is therefore\nan internal contradiction in the telepathic hypothesis at this point. It\nhas the power to get the right names and incidents and none to dis\ntinguish and to prevent the giving of false ones, though this weakness\nis not specially discernible in later sittings ! It knows enough to be\nright, but insists on doing the wrong which it does not know enough\nto prevent ! On the other hand, if he refers to my real mother, all\nthe facts were clear enough in my memory and active consciousness at\nthe time to remove all excuses about her not being clear.\nMy notes call attention (p. 362) to another feature of this\ndramatic play in which the communicators are the actors rather than\nthe trance personalities in connection with them. I shall not examine\nit at length at present, as the notes ought to suffice. But I shall\nallude to one or two accidents of it. The main feature of it is the\nfact that I had supposed there was absolutely no trace of my father in\nit, nor of anyone else in the family except my brother and sister. But\nthe incidents of later sittings show with tolerable distinctness the pro\nbability that both my father and my uncle are communicators in this\nsitting, though they were too confused for me to discover or suspect it\nat the time. One of the facts, too, represents an automatism on the\npart of my father which was not an intended message at all, but just\nthe remark, absolutely unknown to me as a habit of his in life, that\nhe would make on the sudden discovery that he had to go out\nof doors on some errand. The remark was : \" Give me my hat \"\n(p. 307.) As the various communicators discovered that the sitter\nwas an interested relative, the play of effort to reach me would\nnaturally show just the tendency to dismiss the lady falsely\nclaiming to be my mother, and to test the qualifications of those\nwho agreed on my identity to take her place. The confusion then\nthat prevents me from suspecting any other communicators than\nthose who succeed in giving their names is just what would occur in\nthe process of determining who should be allowed to monopolise the\n\" machine.\" My ignorance of the incident about the hat, and the\npertinence of other indefinite incidents, all subject even to the\nhypothesis of guessing, and the transition from person to person\nwithout intimation to me, taken with my unfamiliarity with the\nwhole affair, writing and all, prevented my suspecting a unity which\nlater events enable me to give to the sitting very distinctly. The play\nis, then, that of several relatives talking all at once into a \" telephone''\n\f190 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nwhich they have suddenly discovered leads to their friends, and\nit is allowed to go on until the parties who are managing the\n\" machine \" ascertain who has the ear of the receiver. This becomes\nmeasurably clear before the sitting closes, and the second sitting opens\nwith a perfectly distinct exclusion of all communicators whatsoever\nbut my father until the proper interval justifies the admission of\nanother relative. The action is exactly as if the trance personalities\nhad discovered my identity and the right of the communicators to\nspeak, and then shut out disturbing agencies, and with them the con\nfusion that so marks this first sitting and that prevented my suspecting\nthe identity of more than my brother and sister. But there is nothing\nto suggest telepathy in the development of this dramatic play, as its\nwhole procedure indicates limitations in the trance personalities\nthat ought not to exist on the telepathic hypothesis with its\nsuppposed large powers, to say nothing of two true incidents that I\ndid not know, namely, \"Give me my hat,\" and the name of my father's\nsister Mary.\nIn the first sitting we have found that the whole dramatic play\nassumes the character of an attempt to find out who I am and who\nshall be permitted to communicate. Now in spite of the doubt in\nG. P.'s mind at the close of the sitting regarding the lady whom he\nhopes to keep clear, the opening and continuance of the second and all\nlater sittings presents the appearance of the trance personalities'\nhaving decided, in the time elapsing between the first and second\nsitting, who I was and who should communicate. The peculiar dramatic\nplay of the first sitting, therefore, is abandoned and the communications\nof the second are opened at once with the appearance of assurance\nthat they had found the right communicator, and all intruders are\nshut out. Whether the facts are as I have represented them on the\n\" other side \" is not the question. That must always be a matter of\nconjecture. But the differences between the dramatic play of the two\nsittings can be described in no other language, if they are to be under\nstood in their apparent character at least. Accepting, therefore, the\nrepresentation that the trance personalities have in the meantime\nassured themselves of my identity and secured a reason for suspending\nfurther experiments in that direction, we can easily understand the\nchange of dramatic play which is exhibited in this second and all later\nsittings, and the assurance with which this second sitting starts out in\nthe recognition of the right communicator. The assumptions which we\nhave to make regarding the dramatic play in this situation are only\nthe difficulties of the communication itself, and we find that the results\nconform to this conception of the case. But the dramatic play of the\nfirst sitting changes its character in the later sittings according to this\n\fxu.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 191\nvery idea of the situation. It now takes the form of a change of\ncommunicators with only such a part in it of the trance personalities\nas either the change and intervals may indicate, or as the conditions\nof communication necessitating a change may prompt or render\nopportune.\nIt appears that communicators cannot long stand contact with\nmaterial conditions, and must retire from the \" machine \" for a respite,\nto use the language of the sittings, which can be done on any\ntheory. In the interval of this change from one communicator to\nanother a sentence is often thrown in that is wholly irrelevant to the\nmessage, whether this sentence comes from the communicator or from\nthe amanuensis. This may even be true of interruptions in the com\nmunications from the same personality. This characteristic often\ndetermines both the confusion and the dramatic play, and unless we\nperceive this fact we shall lose a large part of the significance of the\nPiper phenomena as a whole.\nThe first part of the dramatic play in the second sitting occurs\nbetween the trance personalities after the usual greetings, and is indi\ncated in statements that inform the sitter of the coming communicator.\nThere is the representation of excitement in the hand of the medium\nand the written order for calm. The answer, \"Yes, I will,\" by the com\nmunicator is not a message to me, but an automatism of the \" machine \"\nindicating an interlocution going on with the parties in the transcen\ndental world. Immediately the communications begin, and are inter\nrupted only by language that first indicates disturbance, namely, \" I\nwant my head clear. I am choking,\" and then the statement, '; I am\ngoing; will come back soon.\" Without any other intimation the com\nmunicator changes from my father to my brother, as both name and\ncontent indicate. The language that follows shows that a slight\naltercation takes place between my brother and some one who appears\nto treat him as an intruder (p. 314). He rather passionately appeals\nfor permission to speak and gives a reason for it, which evidently\nconvinces \" the powers that be,\" for they allow him to communicate.\nIn the midst of this Rector suddenly intromits the statement, after a\nlittle delay, \" Listen, friend, have patience with me,\" and then, as if\nin explanation to me or Dr. Hodgson, \" Imperator is here, and we\nwill keep them quite calm.\" From my standpoint there is no excuse\nfor any of these diversions from the communications. There is no\napparent reason for the altercation with my brother in the telepathic\ntheory of the case. He had been a welcome communicator the day\nbefore, and telepathy, by supposition, had admitted him as a possible\ncommunicator. Why not proceed with him to-day as before? Nor\nis there any trace of disturbance that makes it apparent that Hector's\nremark just quoted is called for. Both passages represent a situation\n\f192 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nwholly ouside the mind of the sitter and without excuse from tele\npathy. One can imagine that the altercation was in favour of my\n\" uncle Charles,\" especially as my brother and my uncle here pass\nunder the same name. The ready submission of the objector to my\nbrother rather indicates the discovery of a mistake. This, of course,\nis purely speculative, but I indulge this mood for the moment to make\nintelligible what cannot be understood from the standpoint of either\ntelepathy or secondary personality. Its whole character imitates some\nintelligent purpose so obtrusively that it must get the credit of this\nidea on any theory whatsoever, and we can appreciate it only by\nrepresenting the process as one beyond the mind of the sitter and\nimitative, at least, of a reality which is certainly expressible in\nspiritistic terms.\nThis dramatic play takes on a realistic character of another kind in\nthe messages which follow. My notes show that I have had some\ndifficulty in deciding whether all of them come from one communicator,\nmy uncle, or a part of them, the first part, from my father. The\nfact that indicates the difficulty is the confusion occurring at one point\nin the passage which is pertinent to my uncle in all but one statement.\nAfter the indication of his inability to remain longer in the words,\n\" Mother, mother, going,\" etc., my father appears and attempts\nto continue communications regarding this uncle, though indicating\nthat it is he, and not my uncle, that is doing it. There is a distinct and\nnatural allusion to the statement a little earlier that he would be back\nsoon. The interesting part of the communication is the fact that\nbetween the two there seems to be a concerted effort to indicate\nthe presence and identity of my uncle who had died so recently. Both\nshow the same natural solicitude for the comfort of my aunt, the wife\nof this uncle and sister of my father, her Christian name being correctly\ngiven. But this allusion of father to the uncle contains a train of\nthought not at all characteristic of the uncle and soon reverts to affairs\nnot related to my uncle at all. It starts out, however, with the\nintelligent recognition of what was clearly enough indicated by the\ncontent of my uncle's message, though this uncle did not attempt\nhis own name.\nNow the death of my uncle was such as to give the content of his\ncommunications some interest. He was injured by an accident on the\nrailway, and died a few hours afterwards. I learned accidentally\nthat the allusion to my aunt's discouragement and despair had more\nspecific importance than usual. I treated it at the time as indicating\nthe natural sorrow that attends such a bereavement, but did not know\nor suspect that this grief was so near a dangerous result to herself.\nHence the interest shown by both communicators in trying to assuage\nsorrow was especially natural under the circumstances and shows\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 193\nsome indications of the recognition that there were special reasons\nfor speaking of my uncle. On the telepathic hypothesis there is no\nreason for my father to speak in this way of the matter, as there was\nnothing specific in my memory associated with the death of this uncle.\nThe change of communicator usually results in a change of matter in\nthe messages pertinent to the identity of the communicator from the\nstandpoint of the sitter. But here the natural sympathy of the\ncommunicator with his sister in her sorrow suggests an independent\nintelligence. That is to say, we have a dramatic play in this case\nrepresenting two personalities dealing with the same content with\njust the modification that suits their personal relations to the case,\nwhile my father makes the right suggestion in speaking of his sisters\nas \" the girls,\" and in this plural recognises the misfortune which his\nother sister, Nannie, had met just a month earlier in the loss of her\nhusband almost as suddenly as the sister Eliza referred to in the\ncommunications. The dramatic play has thus a psychological unity\nin diversity corresponding to the situation itself, and not correlated\nwith any memories that are associated in my mind.\nThis dramatic play occurs in a still more interesting form when\nthis uncle appears the second time (p. 317). The message began :\n\"What can I do to make Eliza feel that I am not dead? (S. : Tell us\nwho are with you, and that will help Eliza.) Yes, all, you shall know\neach one in her. You are not Robertson [?] are you ? (R. H. : Is that\nRobertson 1 ) You are not George are you ? (S : No, I am not George.)\n(R. H. : I am not. . .) No, James, I know you very well, but this other\none. . . did you know the boys. . . do you know me 1 \"\nAt the time I took the \" Robertson \" to be a mistake for my\nbrother Robert. But the last sentence of the passage indicated clearly\nthat the mention of my aunt was by my uncle, and that \" Robertson \"\nwas a reference to father, to know if I was \" Robert's son.\" My\nfather's name was Robert and my uncle always called him this.\n(Cf. reference to \"Robertson\" in the first sitting p. 310). The\nquestion, then, \"You are not Robertson (Robert's son) are you?\" and\n\" You are not George, are you 1 \" George being the name of my oldest\nbrother, reveal the communicator's discovery that Dr. Hodgson is a\nstranger. My reply shows that I supposed the question expressed\na doubt about myself and not as directed to Dr. Hodgson. The\nresponse then that followed my statement and that of Dr. Hodgson,\n\" No, James, I know you, but this other one. . . did he\nknow the boysJ . . do you know me?\" becomes wonderfully\npertinent and significant. My uncle never knew or heard of Dr.\nHodgson and it would be natural enough for him to wonder whether\nmy brother George happened to be with me, though telepathy ought to\nhave corrected any such impression. Nor did Dr. Hodgson know\no\n\f194 J. H. Hyslop, Ph.D. [part\nanything of my uncle. The death of this uncle had also been concealed\nfrom Dr. Hodgson. The whole situation, therefore, was a perfectly\nnatural one, and the dramatic play has all the verisimilitude of\nreality in it.\nThe absurdity of telepathy in this case ought to be apparent at a\nglance. After twelve years' work and acquaintance with Dr. Hodgson\nMrs. Piper's subliminal does not know him, but queries whether he is\nnot my brother George ! And this in spite of the fact that he is\nconstantly recognised by Rector and G. P., and is known by Mrs.\nPiper's supraliminal ! Moreover, telepathy with its supposed capacities\nfor discrimination in my memory ought never to make such a mistake,\nbut should know at once that Dr. Hodgson was not my brother. His\nname should have been gotten from my memory as readily as that of my\nbrother and his relation to me. But instead of this we have that play\nof real persons and display of ignorance which is absurd on the telepathic\ntheory. Nor will it do to say that its powers united with secondary\npersonality were great enough to discover the facts and merely to simu\nlate this ignorance, as the same power should discover the danger to\nwhich it is exposed in such an attempt at deception. The telepathic\ninfinity in this case runs into the finite and leaves itself without any\ndefence, as it becomes a tissue of contradictions. Notice the inter\nlocutions in the use of the pronoun \"you.\" The only natural and\nrational interpretation is the spiritistic theory, which has absolutely no\ncontradictions in it, but represents both the natural unity and consis\ntency of the phenomena, as well as an explanation in terms of the\nknown laws of consciousness.\nThis remarkable passage is followed by some clear communications\nfrom my father which terminate in a lapse into unconsciousness and a\nconfusion such as tend to follow any period of sustained communica\ntion. This is indicated by the reference to the trance personalities\nand by the expressed desire for me to wait until he returns. The\nlanguage is : \" In a short time they tell me I will be able to recall\neverything . . recall everything I ever did. . . You could be\n. . my . . does not . , I will have to go for a moment, wait\nfor me.\" Then at his disappearance Rector takes up the time com\nmunicating in regard to a little girl for the purpose of finding her\nmother (p. 319). The incident has absolutely no reference to me, and\ndoes not even pretend to have it. This claim would have been no\nmore inconsistent and irrelevant than the attempt in the first sitting\nto connect a lady with me who had no relation to me at all. There\nmight even have been some excuse for palming off a little girl on me,\nas my sister was a little girl when she died and her existence was a\nmatter of memory. The incident, therefore, whether true or false, is\nnot telepathic, either from my standpoint or from that of the trance\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 195\npersonality. It is precisely what should take place on the spiritistic\ntheory, the play of personality being perfectly natural at this juncture.\nIt is all the more interesting in connection with my father's admonition\nto wait for him, as if the communicator feared that I might not wait\nwhile he went away \" to recover his breath,\" so to speak. The assump\ntion that I might not remain is a natural one when we consider the\nuniform difference between the conception of time as felt by communi\ncators and that which the sitter knows. The reasons for this are only\nopen to conjecture and cannot be made any part of the explanation of\nthe phenomena. But the illusion on the part of communicator regard\ning my situation and freedom from the difficulties that he experiences\nin attempting to communicate is inexcusable on the telepathic\nhypothesis. That capacity should know its own conditions and my\nexemption from perturbing circumstances, and be as careful to be right\nas it is in the incidents by which it reproduces personal identity. A\ndiscarnate spirit, unfamiliar as my father was with experiments of this\nkind, or merely conscious that the difficulties in communication existed\non our side, though not tending to produce anything like asphyxiation,\nmight very well suppose, especially under syncope of any form, that I\nmight not wait for his return. But there is no excuse for telepathy to\npalm off on me conditions and expectations that it should know very\nwell were not true.\nThe third sitting contains few instances of this dramatic play\nwhich the reader cannot study sufficiently and intelligently for him\nself. But two of them are interesting enough for remark.\nThe first of these is connected with my question to know the\ntrouble when my father passed out (p. 327). I had in mind the securing\nof information in regard to the nature of the disease from which father\nthought he suffered. He had thought it catarrh, and we knew it was\nprobaby cancer of the larynx. But the point of interest here is the\ninterpretation put on my question, which is adverse to what was in my\nmind, and the peculiar emotional appreciation indicated when I\nexplained my use of the word \" trouble.\" He naturally enough, but\nin contradiction with telepathy of any sort, supposed that \" trouble \"\nreferred to some personal differences between us, and correctly indicated\nhis doubt about the existence of any such difficulties. Then on my\ncorrection of the interpretation, there was a second contradiction with\ntelepathy in his assumption that I was asking for the events that\noccurred in the moments of death, when I said that I meant \" sick\nness,\" though his interpretation was again the proper one when we\nconsider the rational meaning of the temporal clause in my question.\nThen, with this understanding of my desire, the attempt to narrate the\nincidents of that supreme moment is accompanied by a most interesting\ninterlocution between my father and Rector with interjected remarks\no 2\n\f196 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nto me also by Rector explanatory of actions on the \" other side,\" of\nwhich I could have no knowledge. First, Rector explains that father\nhas taken off the condition which he is trying to describe, apparently\nasks me a question as to \" what was meant by his eyes,\" and then says\nto the communicator \" speak plainly.\" The confusion that follows is\nindicated by Rector's farther explanation of the situation and then a\nstatement of what the communicator's action is, saying : \" He\nplaces his hand over his . . heart . . beat,\" then by Rector's\nreaching to touch Dr. Hodgson, as if in that way he could aid the\ncommunicator, who now goes on with some clearness for a time, when\nhe disappears again, and Rector takes up the incident of the little\ngirl mentioned in the previous sitting (p. 330) just as the change\ntakes place to my brother as a communicator, and Rector forewarns me\nof the fact. The inapplicability of telepathy to all this ought to be\nself-evident from the statement of the facts, as it is the play of an\nindependent intelligence and memory relating to events already on\nrecord in the previous sitting and pertinent to Dr. Hodgson, though\nnot matter of knowledge to him, and the reference immediately\nchanges to me in the announcement of my brother. The realism of\nthis is apparent.\nThe next illustration of this play is in connection with a\nphenomenon which resembles ordinary automatism, and with a\nrecognition of the trance personality of some disturbance in the process\nof communication. Immediately following a perfectly clear message\nfrom my father, and wholly irrelevant to it, was written out the\nquestion : \"Do you hear her sing?\" (p. 332). This was repeated in\nresponse to a statement by Dr. Hodgson, \" No, the words are not\nclear, Rector.\" Then Rector said, after Dr. Hodgson's \"No\" to\nthe repeated question : \" Friend, there is something and we will be\nobliged to ask thee to move.\" I changed my position, and was at\nonce asked to return. I had alluded to my sister Annie a few\nminutes before and I took the reference to singing to be to her.\nBut whether correct or not, the matter of interest is Rector's\ndiscovery of the incoherence and irrelevancy of the message, which\nwas not conceived by me as necessarily such, as I knew the frequent\nand sudden changes in the communications and the equally frequent\nallusions to events, intelligible or unintelligible, on the \" other side.\"\nI recognised the irrelevancy of the question to the import of the\nprevious message, but was not confused as to its possible meaning\nin reference to the previous allusion to my sister. Hence there is\nno excuse on the telepathic hypothesis for this procedure, and similar\nincoherences on other occasions did not prompt any such interruptions\non the part of the trance personality. We can admit telepathy only\non the supposition that it discovers my recognition of the confusion in\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 197\nconnection with father's message. But this would prove too much, for\nthe reason that there is not a single other interference like this when I\nwas far more confused as to the meaning of the message than I was\nat this time, while the statement of Rector suggests that there was a\ndisturbance in the \" machine\" (Cf. p. 332). Moreover, telepathy would\ninvolve the supposition that there was an influence upon the communi\ncations from my supraliminal states for which there is not one iota\nof evidence in this record, nor in any study and watching for this\neffect which I made purposely throughout the sittings. We may\nexplain this automatism as we please, but it is not telepathic, though\nany secondary personality that we may suppose could have successfully\ninterpreted the question as referring to actual singing on the part of\nmy sister, as often illustrated in pseudo-spiritism, instead of deliberately\nindicating by its treatment of the incident that it was nothing of the\nkind, but mere disturbance in the \" machine.\"\nIn the last of the first series of sittings the first noticeable feature\nof this dramatic play is the unusual appearance of Imperator and His\nstatement of the reason for preceding Rector. The necessity for\nrestoring the \" light,\" as the medium is called, is a queer trick to be\nplayed by a telepathic subject or percipient ! But immediately Rector\ntakes Imperator's place and the communications begin (p. 335). After\na few messages, Rector says, as if directing a person where to stand,\n\"Speak clearly, sir. Come over here.\" The communicator answers,\n\" Yes,\" as if indicating the intention to obey, and then accosts Dr.\nHodgson with the question : \" Are you with James 1 \" On Dr.\nHodgson's affirmative reply, my father responds with an evident and\nintelligent allusion to the understanding that he was to communicate\nwith Dr. Hodgson in my absence. He said : \" Well, will you help\nme to return later if I wish to return 1 If so, I will try and free my\nmind now.\" On Dr. Hodgson's favourable answer, he went on :\n\" Well, I will not feel troubled then, because I have no further talk\nwith him now,\" etc. The appreciation of the situation is perfect here.\nIt represents the consciousness of the fact that this is the last chance,\nfor the present at least, of a personal interview, and his satisfaction\nwith the promise to continue the attempt to prove his identity. This\nand the direction of Rector where to stand are realism and are not\ntelepathic, no matter how we endeavour to explain them.\nThe messages then continue smoothly for a moment when the\nstrange colloquy takes place, explaining that the communicator speaks\ntoo fast, and indicating also that my father had said all he wished.\nRector says in the midst of a communication : \" He speaks too\nrapidly, fearing he may forget something,\" and there follows the\nbroken sentence, \" . . had said all I wished,\" as if indicating to\nRector the latter's misunderstanding of the situation, while in fact\n\f198 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nshowing his consciousness of some disturbance and failure to\nappreciate the situation as Rector explained it to us. This is\na perfectly intelligible situation, exhibiting all the independent\nintelligence that any one can imagine and without a trace of excuse\nfrom telepathy.\nThe next piece of dramatic playing is found in the communication\nI made to my father (p. 339). I had kept him sending messages to me\nwithout reciprocating, as I was avoiding every form of suggestion.\nBut I here resolved to reveal myself, and at the same time try to\nelicit some evidences of his identity as connected with his religious life.\nI wrote out a long passage to be read to the hand and in it explained\nwhy I had not asked many questions. But before reading it, Dr.\nHodgson explained to Rector what I wished to do. Rector wrote out\nin response that the letter would have to be repeated for the reason\nthat my father could get the statements only in fragments. This was\nunderstood, and I began when the permission was given. The passage\nin which I stated the reason for this work and summarised our long\ncorrespondence, after my apostasy from orthodoxy, was designed to\ncall out some evidence of his identity in the direction that was the most\nimportant aspect of his life. His reply to the first part of the\ncommunication was correctly appreciative and representative of an\nactual fact in our conversation on this subject. But when I had\nread the passage alluding to what I had always told him, Rector,\ncatching the spirit of it, at once stopped listening and wrote,\n\"Perfectly. Yes. That is surely James.\" The dramatic feature of\nthis can be understood only in connection with four facts. (1) The\nappreciation of the sentiment by Rector ; (2) The recollection of\nwhat Rector said about the necessity of repeating the communication ;\n(3) The fact that the reply of father is made to Rector and not to\nine, indicating that he understood it and recognised in it exactly what\nhe knew of me in our correspondence ; (4) The implied uncertainty\nas to my identity until the present moment, which ought not to have\noccurred on the hypothesis of telepathy. The representation is that\nof a scene on the \" other side,\" and not of events acquired from my\nmemory. Rector's action is that of an intelligence that fears, after\nreminding us of the necessity of repeating the message to my father,\nthat its importance will not be appreciated for lack of getting it, and\nwe can imagine that he asks, as it were, \"Do you hear that?\" and\ngets the answer which he writes down, though it is not directly\naddressed to me.\nThe remaining features of this sitting explain themselves to the\nreader and do not require analysis. Their intelligent appreciation of\nthe situation, created partly by my communication and partly by the\nfact that it was the last sitting I was to have at that time, can be\n\fXLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 199\nperceived without discussing it. What it implies about the difficulties\nof telepathy is apparent, whatever else we may have to entertain to\nexplain it.\nThe next five sittings, which were conducted for me by Dr.\nHodgson while I remained in New York, show this dramatic play of\npersonality in a peculiar and pertinent form. The understanding at\nthe beginning of my sitting on 26th of December (1898) was that Dr.\nHodgson should receive communications for me. The object was to\nshut out direct thought-transference. The first part of the sitting\nwas taken up, as usual, with the business part of the affair with the\ntrance personalities, in which we can study this dramatic play with\ngreat interest for its absolute exclusion of telepathy and the repre\nsentation of independent intelligence. But after completing arrange\nments for future sittings, Rector remarks that if Dr. Hodgson has\nnothing further to ask he will bring my father to communicate, and\nthere at once begins a curious feature of the sitting and an exceed\ningly interesting aspect of the dramatic play. Dr. Hodgson expresses\nhis readiness, and the drama begins. Rector holds the hand out in\nspace, pointing to the communicator, apparently conversing with him,\nand then writes; \"No, he is not .... but it is his friend\n. . . very well. No, not James, but Hodgson. Yes. Come.\"\nDr. Hodgson gets the package, whose purpose has been explained,\nbut which ostensibly is intended to influence the \"holding of the\nspirit \" and its attention, and Rector writes : \" Give it me, friend.\"\nThe delay on Dr. Hodgson's part is filled in by Rector's monition\nto the communicator : \" Be patient, kindly,\" and after Dr. Hodgson\nhas placed the spectacle case on the table, my father indicates the\nproper appreciation of the situation and says : \" Yes, friend, I am\npleased to meet you, I wish to speak to James, but I understand he is\nnot here, but sends you in his place. Am I right J\" Dr. Hodgson\nreplies in the affirmative, and the communications begin (p. 370).\nThe interesting feature that follows generally is the use of the pro\nnoun referring to me, which is in the third person, and assumes that I\nwas not present. The whole play is realistic, and it is absurd to suppose\nit telepathic, as the very opposite of what my father assumes is the fact\nin Dr. Hodgson's mind. Rector knows the correct situation, but it is\nsuperfluous to play a merely dramatic part here when the communica\ntions are to represent facts that cannot by any means be obtained from\nDr. Hodgson's mind, and if they are to be secured from my mind in\nNew York, the colloquy and explanation by Rector is absurd, and if\nassumed to be a conscious or unconscious effort by him to deceive, the\nfact contradicts his whole character ever since he appeared with\nImperator in charge of Mrs. Piper. The attitude of u>y father appears\n\f200 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nmore puzzling, as it would naturally be supposed that he would\nremember the arrangements made and also be able to recognise Dr.\nHodgson again, if his earlier statement that he could see my spirit in\nthe body had any meaning whatever for recognition. But this\ndifficulty is explained after all in the statement a little later that he\nwas a little distance from Dr. Hodgson, but hoped to come nearer\nsoon (p. 372). Hence in spite of its apparent difficulties the play\nbecomes consistent enough, even if not altogether intelligible. But it\nis clearly not amenable to telepathy from Dr. Hodgson's mind, as there\nis a distinct reference to me at various times in the third person,\ninvolving the implication that the communicator was presenting the\nfacts to another person than to me. There are times, however, during\nsome of the five sittings when the communicator slips into speaking to\nthe sitter, Dr. Hodgson, in the second person as if talking to me,\nwhich is still more absurd on the telepathic hypothesis, as the\nsecondary personality must know better than to mistake Dr. Hodgson\nfor me. Moreover the play is more natural and explicable on the\nspirit theory than any other, as that of secondary personality and\ntelepathy cannot safely indicate in one breath its complete knowledge\nof the arrangements for the present situation and in the next imper\nsonate an ignorance of them that destroys its own pretensions.\nThere is nothing farther in this first of the five sittings by Dr.\nHodgson to be especially remarked except the interesting colloquy\nbetween Dr. Hodgson and my father in the attempt of the former to\nexplain to him just what I wanted and what was necessary to prove\nhis identity. All this explains itself to the reader and does not require\nanalysis. But the main fact of interest to be remarked in con\nnection with this explanation is the persistency with which my father\nin all subsequent sittings sticks to the understanding of the problem\nwhich this explanation gives him. Up to the present one he was\nless careful to limit himself to incidents in his life, but showed a\ntendency to make non-evidential remarks, and the incidents were such\nas merely his own judgment would select without as clear a view of the\nproblem before him as the explanation made it. His whole attitude\ntoward Dr. Hodgson is perfectly appreciative of his task, and once\nlater he alludes to it in terms that unmistakably indicate his memory\nof the fact (p. 460). One matter of interest in it is the promise of\nRector to explain the whole case to father in detail, an incident that\nhelps to sustain the dramatic character of the affair. After the\nexplanation by Dr. Hodgson begins there is very little of the sitting\nthat partakes of the nature of evidential communication, but it shows\nthe completely lite-a-tete nature of the conversation between the two\nparties in the drama, and while its extension beyond telepathy goes\nwithout mention, the play of independent intelligence is as real as life\n\fxLi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 201\nand would never be suspected for anything else but for the fact that\nthe evidence for personal identity is so difficult to obtain in the face of\nwhat we know of secondary personality, which often does so much to\nsimulate spiritism, though it has not yet reproduced such phenomena\nas we have in the Piper case.\nIn the second sitting of this series this dramatic play takes\nanother form than is usual in this record (pp. 375-377). It\nrepresents the appearance of a third trance personality, familiar to\nother sitters, but having no such specialised functions in my sittings\nas Imperator and Rector, at least in the work as it appears to\nus. This new trance personality calls himself Doctor. All three\ntrance personalities appear in the preliminaries to the communications\nfrom my father. Imperator writes first and gives a remarkable prayer\nand explains his entrance on that occasion. Rector then appears only\nto greet Dr. Hodgson for a brief period, bids farewell, and Rector at\nonce announces his own return and the communications begin. The\nconsistency and realistic aspects of these remarkable passages can be\nseen by the reader without comment. But there is one point of\ninterest that must have attention called to it, so that we shall observe\nthe pertinence of the main characteristic of this dramatic play to the\nnature of the communications that follow.\nImperator states that his object is to \" restore-the light.\" Rector\nexamines the situation and says things are \" infinitely better,\"\nDoctor tries the \" machine,\" and Rector intimates that they wish to\nhave \" Mr. Hyslop,\" my father, \" come closer.\" Presently Imperator\nsends through Rector that \" it will be impossible for Him to answer\nfor Mr. W. this .day, as it will necessitate our using too much light for\nhim, and we must give it for this kind gentleman, viz., Mr. Hyslop.\"\nHere is a series of statements and ideas that represent an organic\nunity of purpose and co-operation in spite of the changes of per\nsonality, and the study of the results of the sitting shows a vast\nimprovement over the first and second sittings. (Cf. Statistical\nSummary, p. 119). The whole play when examined in its essential\nfeature lying below the surface of the record shows this intelligent unity,\nand it goes without saying that it is not telepathic, but a representation\nof events and conditions in a transcendental world beyond experience.\nWe may treat it as we please, but it is not the reading of any human\nmemories relevant to the immediate problem before Dr. Hodgson.\nThe dramatic play in the communications with my father have the\nusual characteristics, with some modifications, or points of special\ninterest. The first noticeable fact is the impression he has that I am\npresent. He begins addressing me, saying, \" Good morning, James,\"\n(p. 377), and goes on using the second person for some time. He has\nforgotten that he is communicating with Dr. Hodgson. But the\n\f202 [PAET\n\/. H. Hyslop, PhD.\ndramatic play is interesting. When he mentions the mark near hia\near which he expected me to recall, Rector interrupts him with the\nrequest : \" Tell me, friend, that I may show it to him.\" There was\nevidently some special effort required to meet Rector's request, as the\nrecord shows, for in the attempt some interlocution has to go on\nbetween Dr. Hodgson and Rector, when all at once Rector stops\nDr. Hodgson's message and writes, \" He is saying something. Wait\nuntil I hear it clearly.\" There immediately follows a confused message\nregarding a pen and a paper cutter, with a most interesting exhibi\ntion of the difficulties involved in the communication. Rector was\nnot sure that he got it rightly. Presently father had to say \" Let\nme go a minute and return. I am very blind and begin to feel\nstrange.\" Rector then takes up the interval of a minute or so with a\nstatement of his good opinion of father, and promises a very successful\ncommunicator in time. Father returns and discovers for the first time\nin this sitting that he is not communicating to me at all. He says :\n\"Here I am. Yes, I see, you are not really James, but his friend.\nGlad I am to know you.\" From this point, being clearer, he speaks as\nif telling his incidents to an intermediary for me. The rest of the\ndramatic play in the sitting explains itself, and simply repeats such\ncharacteristics' as I have indicated, namely, the intromission of ques\ntions and explanations into the process of communication. But one\nincident is worthy of attention because of its length and irrelevance\nto any telepathic hypothesis. Dr. Hodgson had prepared to read\none of my questions and did not know that my father had left the\n\" machine,\" when Rector interrupted him with a communication about\nMrs. M., one of the earlier sitters. The matter in this colloquy has no\nreference to the issue with my father, but intelligently adjusts itself\nto the interval of his departure from the \" light\" for a respite.\nThe intromission of irrelevant matter into a message about\nMrs. M. expressed in the automatism : \" Yes, it contains my cutter \"\n(p. 380), and involving interruptions, explanations, cautions, etc.,\nand the play of distinct personalities, has a most interesting\nanalogy in an experience reported by Miss X. (Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII., p. 494). Miss X. had only a few minutes before parted from\na friend who had been talking to her about psychical research.\nShe picked up a shell and holding it to her ear heard in the form of\nauditory hallucinations the conversation of the few minutes before in\nthe apparent voice of her friend, and intromitted into it the expression,\n\" Are you a vegetarian then 1 \" She immediately wrote to her friend\ntelling him the circumstances, and asked him if he was respon\nsible for this irrelevancy. His reply showed that he had met a friend\nsome minutes after he left her who told him he was dining at a\ncertain restaurant, and Miss X.'s friend at once asked him if he was a\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 203\nvegetarian. This remark coincided with the intromission into her\nhallucinations of the very sentence the gentleman had used. Now this\ninstance is not spiritistic in its contents, but in spite of this fact it\nunequivocally favours independent personalities for the different parts\nof the whole, and affords no relief for telepathy in so far as that would\nenable us to dispense with real distinction of personalities. In this\ncase before us the intromitted message is traceable to a foreign and\nobjective source, and represents two personalities instead of one only.\nThat is to say, in spite of the fact that the intromission, which\nindicated its irrevelancy at once, was in the same form as the purely\nsubjective experience of Miss X., yet it had as a verifiable fact a\npersonal origin in another subject, and indicates two persons instead of\none. To have found no objective source for it would have left the\nincident at the mercy of the explanation of secondary personality.\nBut as it is, we have a distinct illustration of distinct personalities in a\nmessage which might have been interpreted as the product of Miss\nX.'s brain, and consequently an example of what we may be entitled to\ninfer in the Piper case, especially as the dramatic play is so emphati\ncally that of independent intelligence.\n\" It is perhaps hardly a feature of the dramatic play to note in the\nthird sitting by Dr. Hodgson that there is a singular use of both the\nsecond and third persons in the communications to me, but the\nincident is so closely connected with that use that it may be\nmentioned as throwing light on the whole affair. Father's messages\nbegin with a clear conception of the situation, as representing Dr.\nHodgson in the place of myself. He asks pertinently how I am, and\nwhether Dr. Hodgson has really seen me or only heard from me\n\" through what we used to call letters \" (p. 385). A little later when\nhe asks in the second person : \" Can you recall anything about my\nbeliefs in God?\" he speaks as if he thought he was directly addressing\nme. But as he knew from the letter that Dr. Hodgson was reading that\nI wanted some answer from him, it is perfectly rational to suppose\nthat he was still clear as to the situation, but was answering with the\nunderstanding that he was dictating communications to me. There is\na most interesting confirmation of this supposition a little later, and\njust after the allusion to the skull cap (p. 387), when he says, \" Answer\nthis for me, James, when you come again,\" recognising, in spite of the\nsecond person, that I was not present. This interesting incident must\nmake us cautious about raising objections on the ground of the\nmistakes in the identity of the sitter. But immediately Rector inter\njects a message which purports to be what he knows my father\nis trying to communicate, and it represents a pertinent fact, and\nthen as if suddenly called to get another message exclaims :\n\" Wait . . . what is he talking about ? \" and then speaks to Dr.\n\f204 [PAKT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nHodgson for something to \" hold the spirit.\" This, of course, has its\nvraisemblance to the tricks of ordinary mediums, but as it represents\nthe real dramatic play so well, I can refer to it without presuming as\nto its origin. But there is not much in this sitting that represents the\ndramatic play in any form not intelligible to every reader. Nor is there\nanything in the fourth sitting that demands special comment after what\nhas been explained concerning the general action of the play.\nIn the fifth sitting, however, the incident of the canes indicates\nsome features of the dramatic play that should be mentioned,\n(p. 397). In the attempt to communicate something about a cane,\nwhose identity I did not know or recognise until I made my investiga\ntions in the West, Rector interrupted the writing by movements of\nMrs. Piper's hand, which I found to be a probable attempt to describe\nthe uses to which the cane had been put. The details need not be\nrepeated here, but Rector apparently does not understand the mimic\nactions on the \" other side.\" Assuming that the action really repre\nsents references to my father's various habits in the use of the cane,\nwe can see how absurd it is to suppose telepathy of any kind when the\n\"control\" fails to get the right idea, though he can describe what\nhe sees and conveys nevertheless the right idea of the communicator.\nThe representation is that of independent personalities, and shows\nhow one of them communicates an evidential truth which he does not\nunderstand himself. That is not telepathy, as all the other communica\ntions are consistent with the supposition that the personality writing\nthem has also the correct ideas of them, but also is able to interpret\nthem when not otherwise clear. In the present case, however, the\ntrance personality cannot obtain a simple fact by telepathy, and cannot\ninterpret rightly the movements in an attempt to describe an event\nperfectly intelligible to me and to all who know how that particular\ncane was used. It requires, possibly, the supposition of some kind of a\n\" body \" to make the dramatic features of this incident perfectly clear\nto our imagination, but as that is a supposition which I cannot\nseriously entertain here because of our limitations in making any\nstatements about a transcendental world intelligible (Cf. p. 290), I\ncan only represent the action as it is given, and assuming that it is\nrealistic enough to suggest a spiritistic origin, lay the stress upon its\ntallying with the facts as I found them to be in my investigation.\nThe main point is to see that neither telepathy nor secondary\npersonality is compatible with the incident. There is a finitude about\nRector's powers here that is not consistent with their range at other\ntimes on any other hypothesis than the spiritistic.\nIn my last eight sittings this dramatic play is usually not so dis\ntinctive a feature of the communications, except as it is represented\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 205\nin the change from one communicator to another. The usual alter\ncations, colloquies, remarks, explanations, etc., take place between the\ncommunicators and the amanuensis\u2014Rector or other writer, as the\ncase may be\u2014-on the one hand, and between the amanuensis and the\nsitter on the other. If this fact is remembered it will not be necessary,\nin urging the argument for the spiritistic theory on the ground of\nthis dramatic play, to treat it at length in these last sittings. I shall\ntherefore notice only those exceptional instances of it that the general\nreader would not be able to observe so easily as I can, owing to my\nfamiliarity with the facts that make the communications so pertinent\nand evidential.\nThe first of these instances is of a type not found to any extent in\nthe previous series of sittings. It is the employment of a substitute\nfor the communicating. This occurs several times in this series.\nOccasionally father has given a message that was evidently intended\nto do what another had failed to effect. Once my brother Charles\n(p. 455) communicates for father, and once my sister Annie (p. 451)\ncommunicates for my cousin Robert McClellan, as the incidents in\neach case indicate. Sometimes, too, the communicator represents the\nincident that he is telling as having been mentioned to him on the\n\" other side.\" All this represents a play of personality that supposes\nan entirely new range for telepathy, if it is to be assumed at all.\nThe first instance is by father when he asks if I \" remember a little\nbridge we used to cross in going to Church,\" and on my assent he adds\nthat \" mother just called my attention to it \" (p. 435). This brings in a\npertinent incident that is put into the mouth of another person on the\n\"other side \"for whom it was more natural to mention this bridge than\nit was for my father, and it was not associated in my mind with either\none of them more than with the other. This feature is illustrated again\nby some statements by my brother Charles (p. 440) while my father\nrests a moment. He alluded to my half-sister and to some things that\nhe says father asked him to say, and remarks that \" his voice troubles\nhim a little when trying to speak,\" a strange statement from the\nordinary point of view, but consistent with what I knew of his illness,\nas father had been unable to speak above a whisper for three years\nbefore his death. His conditional clause, \" If you are still in the\nbody, James,\" has strange implications in it, and all that is said here\nis not telepathy, especially this last quoted statement, because telepathy\nmust be supposed to know positively that I am in the body. My\nsister Annie indicates a similar fact when, in communicating for my\ncousin, she speaks of my father knowing the \"Lucy \" mentioned better\nthan she does (p. 452). A still clearer instance of the same is brother\nCharles's reference to the accident to the chimney, about which he never\nknew, and to the fact that he \" heard father talking about it to mother\n\f20G [PABT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nsome time ago \" (p. 455). But the interesting part of the play is the\ninnocent and yet fortunate recognition of the communicator that his\nacquisition of the facts was from the \" other side.\" If he had\nmentioned them as personal recollections the circumstances would have\nhad to be set down as false, but, fortunately for the spiritistic view,\nhe rightly refers them to the very persons that would be supposed to\nknow, and, stranger still, he states that it was father that spoke to\nmother about the accident. Mother died fifteen years before the\naccident, and father was the only one that could tell her about the\nfact, though she knew well enough the existence of the chimney. The\ndifficulty of telepathy in such a case ought to be apparent. The\nwhole conception which the incidents represent is that of action in a\ntranscendental world arranging for the communication of facts more\nor less without reference to the person whose knowledge and experience\nthey were, but with a distinct reference, nevertheless, to the identity\nof the proper parties. The organic unity which the facts obtain is\nthat of independent intelligences recalling and collecting their own\nmemories pertinently to the one object of personal identity, and\nexhibiting none of the characteristics of telepathy as we know it\nexperimentally.\nI shall give in full one of the best instances of this transcendental\nplay and references that show how more than one personality is\nconcerned. It is again the work of my brother Charles, and repre\nsents an exceedingly complex psychological situation (p. 462).\nHe first gives his name and then alludes to his having been sent\nby Imperator to take father's place. Evidently, however, his entrance\nhad been preceded by a question by Rector to know what my brother\nsaid, as the question, \" What is it 1 \" appears and the phrase, \" My\nstep-sister \" comes as an answer, when as an explanation to Rector,\nwho apparently did not know the situation for the time, he gave his\nname and stated on whose authority he came. At once, on being\naccepted as persona grata, he says, giving the name of his step-sister,\nwhom he in fact never knew, \" Hettie I did not remember.\" He\nthen corrects this to half-sister and explains his error, with an\nallusion to the assistance he is getting from Imperator. He then\nreports a statement from father, explaining why he has come to\ncommunicate, a remark which at once requires us not to attribute\nthe facts to the wrong personality. I am then asked if I remember\nmy uncle James McClellan and \" Frank . . . speak ....\nHyslop,\" the last phrase representing a tendency to fail in completing\nthe name of my brother, which is effected by Rector's prodding\ndemand that he speak (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 464, Phinuit's\norder : \" Don't go to sleep \"). My brother then remarks correctly\nthat my brother Frank is still living and says that \"father spoke to\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 207\nme of him a few minutes ago.\" The remark calls into notice the fact\nthat father had a special interest in alluding to this brother, as he was\nan invalid at the time of father's death, and my brother Charles never\nknew him. Immediately Charles explains father's difficulties in\ncommunicating, and alludes to \" Dr. Pierce \" as a friend of my \" uncle\nClarke \" and to the fact that he is still living, thus again introducing\nanother personality into the play without appropriating the facts\nto himself. The allusions to father's war stories and to his injured\nleg are similar incidents. They refer to facts that Charles never\nknew personally. This continues through a number of instances,\nuntil the name of my sister Lida is given and the reference\nis made to father as having greater knowledge of her than himself,\nas was true. He also said that father \" often speaks of Lucy,\"\nbut the effort to complete this name failed, while the dramatic\nplay was heightened by the introduction of my sister Annie, also on\nthe \" other side,\" to assist him. But both failed, and Rector wrote in\nexplanation a most remarkable sentence, because it shows beyond\nquestion that he was both unable to read my mind and did not under\nstand whom my brother was trying to name. He said : \" I got it all\nbut .the Hyslop.\" It was Lucy McClellan that my brother was trying\nto name, and Rector evidently thought it was \"Lucy Hyslop,\" no such\nperson existing, and simply inferred from the identity of my brother\nthat he was endeavouring to give the name of another Hyslop. Hence\nhe was wholly wrong, as neither I nor my brother would naturally be in\nthe circumstances. This mistake on the part of Rector was corrected\nsoon- afterwards, as Mrs. Piper was coming out of the trance, when she\nuttered the name of \" Lucy McClellan,\" as if the error had been\ndiscovered on the \"other side,\" and a special effort made to correct it.\nThe difficulties of telepathy in this incident and in the compound play of\npersonality on the \"other side,\" combined with features of the same\nplay with this side, ought to be self-evident.\nThe next and last instance of dramatic playing that I shall discuss\nat length is the most interesting and remarkable in the record. It grew\nout of the attempt to give the name of my stepmother correctly in\nresponse to my request for it. The incident represents the difficulties\nof communication more clearly than anything else in the experiments,\nand it is characterised by calling in G. P. to help out with what Rector\ncould not accomplish.\nAs previous notes intimate (Cf. pp. 69, 342, 365) I was in doubt\nabout what was meant by the name \"Nannie\" in connection with\nincidents that really pertained to my stepmother, who was always\ncalled Maggie by my father. Hence I resolved to clear up this\nquestion without asking directly for the name. Dr. Hodgson knew\nmy object, as we had talked it over before going to the sitting, but\n\f208 J. H. Hyslop, Ph.D. [part\nI did not tell him the details of my plan. On father's appearance\n(p. 478) I assured myself of his presence, and at once asked him,\n\"Who made that cap you referred to so often?\" The answer\n\" mother \" was equivocal, and after my further interrogation to\nknow \" which mother,\" as soon as he understood that 1 meant my\nstepmother, \" my mother on this side,\" he at once answered,\n\" Oh, I see what you mean. Your mother is with me, but Hettie's\nmother is in the body.\" This perfectly satisfied me as to who was\nmeant by the \" Nannie \" referred to so often in connection with the\ncap, and I at once asked about a trip with her out West, intending to\nget incidents which would still more clearly identify her without getting\nthe exact name. But owing to my ignorance of the \" Cooper \" incident,\nand to my having wholly forgotten the fact that on the return from\nthat trip my father visited me in Chicago, I had not identified the\njourney, but supposed that he was referring to the trip in 1861 with\nmy mother and myself. But as a consequence some confusion arose,\nand after my saying that I could not recall any previous mention\nof the trip which father asserted he had told about before, there was a\ndetermined effort to give my stepmother's name, and some interlocution\ngoes on between those on the \" other side \" until finally father asks if I\nreferred to the time when we met with the accident (Cf. p. 372), and\non my saying that I did not mean this, he at once indicates by his\nnext statement that he understands to what I refer, and goes on to\nsay with astonishing correctness and pertinence : \" Well I am sure I\nhave told you of this before. Think over, and you will recall it. I am\nnot sure I mentioned her, but I had it on my mind when I referred to\nthe trip I took just before going out West, do you not recall it 1 \"\nI was perfectly satisfied with this statement, as it made the case\nperfectly clear in its reference to the trip \"just before going out West,\"\nand I was on the point of indicating my satisfaction when Dr.\nHodgson, who did not know the facts as I did and could not know\nwhy I was satisfied, interrupted me and called for G. P., to whom he\nexplained that there was some confusion in my father's mind about\nthe name of my stepmother. G. P. appreciated the situation and\nsaid \" Well, I will assist him. Do not hurry.\" Father then began an\nexplanation of what he had been trying to do and how he became\nconfused by my question, all of which was throwing light on the\nidentity of my stepmother without giving her name, though there was\nevidently one attempt to get it. I was purposely avoiding interrup\ntions, experience having convinced me that, under the circumstances,\nthe communications should take their own course. But Dr. Hodgson\nstill thought I was not satisfied with the situation and that the\nconfusion was continuing. Consequently he began to indicate to\nG. P. that there was still some confusion, when I explained that I\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 209\nunderstood the communications perfectly, and they continued until\nfather left the \" light \" for a respite. My sister Annie took his place\nand spoke for a few minutes announcing his return at the end.\nFather was still confused regarding what I wanted, and began to speak\nof the trip to which both of us had referred, trying apparently to\nlet my stepmother's name slip in with his statements. This appeared\nas \"HAT . . HAR . . No.\" I shook my head at this,\nbecause it was not clear. Father then expressed his desire to speak of\nother things and asked me to tell him exactly what I wanted. Dr.\nHodgson then spoke to \" Rector or George \" to explain what I wished,\nsaying that there was \" a locus of confusion with reference to James'\nstepmother still,\" and Rector replies \" Not so, it hath nothing\nto do with mothers of any sort, but it hath to do with trips, which is\nconfusing him somewhat, and I would not worry him about trips\nbut let him answer when he returns again.\" Dr. Hodgson then\nexplained our difficulty more carefully, saying that the name of my\n\" mother in the body had never yet been rightly given,\" and Rector\nreplied with the question : \" Has it been asked for ? \" Dr. Hodgson\nthen explained just what mistake had been made regarding it, saying\nthat we had gotten it as \" Nannie.\" Rector replied, with a perfectly\nAppreciative and correct answer in the statement of facts (p. 483),\nbut Dr. Hodgson, not knowing or understanding the pertinence of\nRector's explanation, answered : \" No, Rector.\" This was calculated\nto make confusion worse confounded, and Rector gave up with the\nmessage \"I cannot understand it \"and yielded to G. P., who, after\nDr. Hodgson explained to him what I wanted, said, apparently with\nsome sharpness : \" Well, why do you not come out and say, ' Give me my\nstepmother's name,' and not confuse him about anything except what\nyou really want ? \" Dr. Hodgson and I explained that the name had\nbeen directly asked for, and he replied somewhat humorously : \" Has\nit, very well, if she has a name you shall have it, G. P., understand ? \"\nDr. Hodgson then repeated his allusion to \"some peculiar difficulty\nabout getting her name,\" and G. P. replied : \" I do not think so, H. ;\nbut I do think he would refer to it in his own way if let alone. I\nknow how you confused me, by Jove, and I don't want any more of it.\nI am going to help him to tell all he knows from A to Z. No doubt\nabout it H., no one could be more desirous of doing so than he is. Is\nthat clear to you 1 \" My father then begins a long and interesting\nmessage, at the close of which G. P. returns (p. 486) and says : \" I\nwill speak for a moment and say I do not see any reason for anxiety\nabout Margaret.\" Dr. Hodgson asked, \"Who says this?\" and\nreceived the reply : \" George.\" I then asked him to tell the rest, and\nthe reply, somewhat evading or misunderstanding my question, was :\n\" He said, I suppose I might as well tell you first as last and have\nr\n\f210 [part\n\/\/. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ndone with it, or James may think I do not really know. Go tell him\nthis for me. You see I got it out of him for you, H., but you no\nneed to get nervous about it, old chap.\"\nNow when we sum up all this we find that at a crucial point\nwhere Rector was right and Dr. Hodgson was wrong, Rector gives up,\nbaffled in the attempt to understand the situation, and another\npersonality, G. P., appears for the purpose of clearing matters, and\nexhibits a half humorous and impatient temper while scolding Dr.\nHodgson, a temper as different from Rector's long-suffering and\npatience as any trait could be, and then with the persiflage of a\nman of the world goes about his task of unravelling the confusion.\nHe succeeds and reports with ease the name that I wanted,\nintimating at the same time and indirectly the difficulties that the\ncommunicator has in telling his incidents ! The incompatibility of\nall this with either secondary personality or telepathy ought to be\napparent without comment. Assuming telepathy we have the strange\nsituation that, after its marvellous achievements in both incidents and\nproper names, even in this very passage, telepathy is unable to get the\nname Margaret by any effort, and yet does get it with ease when G. P.\nis called in ! We are then laughed at for making so much fuss about\nit ! To us all the fuss appeared on the \" other side \" ! But what is\nthe use on the telepathic hypothesis of all the supererogatory efforts\nhere made in the complicated machinery of several personalities to\nget what is at last gotten with the utmost ease, and we are scolded\nand ridiculed for our \" much ado about nothing \" !\nAs the sitting comes to a close a feature of this dramatic play\nappears and adds importance to the remarks just made. G. P. says to\nDr. Hodgson : \" I am glad to meet your friend even though you fail\nto say anything about him. I am George Pelham, and glad to see\nyou.\" I replied : \"1 am glad to meet you, especially as I know your\nbrother in Columbia University.\" The quick response came : \" Yes,\nCharles.\" \" That is right,\" I said, and the appreciative reply came :\n\"Good. I'll see you again. Au\/tviedersehen.\"\nNow on the telepathic theory all the previous play is an acutely\narranged subliminal fraud, at the same time that the assumed ingenuity\nbetrays limitations inconsistent with its pretended powers, and their\nexposure is made easier than ever. There were opportunities during\nthe previous fourteen sittings to ascertain that I was acquainted\nwith this brother Charles, and to use what information I knew of\nG. P. himself to spontaneously refer to this brother by simply asking\nme, in ostentatious ignorance of the real situation, whether I knew\nthis brother, and then to send pertinent messages to him drawn\nfrom my subliminal. But not a trace of this is to be found. On the\ncontrary, G. P., in spite of the earlier allusion to my connection with a\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 211\ncollege and lectures, spontaneously, and in spite of the marvellous\nmemory that has to be attributed to the subliminal on the telepathic\nhypothesis (pp. 160-170), here represents truthfully his entire\nignorance of me, and in the natural surprise of a real person at once\nmentions his brother and shows the appropriate emotional interest in\nthe situation. But telepathy could not get the name \" Margaret \"\nwithout terrible confusion, though it could get the name Charles with\nout the slightest difficulty, and in spite of the fact that my mental\ncondition with reference to both names was the same with the excep\ntion that the former was more distinct in memory ! The internal\ncontradictions of the telepathic theory were never more evident than\nhere. When telepathy, assuming it, exhibits the facility of its opera\ntions in so marvellous a manner, there is no need of confusion, and\nof actions that at once discredit its pretensions and threaten with denial\nthe belief which it aims to foster ! But if we look at this realistic\nplay of personality as just what it purports to be we discover its entire\nunity and self consistency. The operation of finite agencies under\ndifficulties that must be admitted in any case is far more intelligible\nand consistent than this infinite complexity of all sorts of powers, large\nand small, and immeasurably contradictory, to say nothing of its\nincompatability with all that we know of secondary personality in its\nbest estate.\nI may, at this point, very effectively gather up several other\ninterferences of G. P. which I have not discussed collectively in their\nbearing upon this dramatic play. They show a peculiarly unique\nfeature of these communications, indicating very clearly just what we\nare entitled to expect on the spiritistic theory, and not on any other.\nIn these sudden interruptions G. P. appears as an intermediary to\ninterpret, correct, or transmit something which Rector, the amanuensis\ndoes not \" hear,\" and by signing his own initials to the message, or\nstatement, he reveals just the evidence of another personality and\nindependent intelligence which would be so natural on the spiritistic\ntheory, but not to be expected a priori either of the telepathic\nhypothesis or of its combination with secondary personality.\nAfter my first sitting, on December 23rd, 1898, there is no definite\nhint of G. P.'s presence at my sittings until that of May 30th, 1899.\nThe statement of my father on May 29th (p. 419), \"I am speaking\nto some other man who is speaking for me,\" might possibly imply\nthe presence of G. P., though possibly Elector was intended. But on\nMay 30th my cousin, Robert McClellan, gives G. P.'s full name\u2014\u25a0\nGeorge Pelham (pseudonym)\u2014and remarks that he is assisting. A\nmoment later, right in the midst of a communication from my cousin,\nwhose messages were badly confused, G. P. suddenly interjects the\np 2\n\f212 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nstatement : \" Look out H., I am here. G. P. + [Imperator] sent me\nsome moments ago \" (p. 428). Then again a few minutes later, while\nRector was struggling to get the name McClellan clear and could\nonly get McAllen, G. P. shouts out, so to speak, as an intermediary\nto aid Rector, \" Sounds like McLellen. G. P.,\" and my cousin\nacknowledges its correctness by saying : \" Yes, I am he.\"\nAt the close of my cousin's communications G. P.'s presence and\ninfluence are evident in the sentence declaring : \" The machine is not\nright, H.,\" which Dr. Hodgson took to refer to the need of a fresh\npencil, and he accordingly gave one. This occurs in the interval between\nthe departure of my cousin and the arrival of my father (p. 429).\nIn the same sitting (p. 434) the name of my half-sister was given.\nThere was considerable trouble with it on Rector's part, as he\nstumbled about between the false attempts \"Abbie,\" \"Addie,\" and\n\" Nabbie,\" until G. P. suddenly interrupted him with the statement :\n\" Yes, but let me hear it, and I will get it. G. P.\" He then gave\nthe name \"Hattie\" and followed it with \"Harriet,\" when I acknow\nledged that it was nearly correct, alluding to the \" Hattie \" in\nparticular, but without saying so. I asked that it be spelled out\nThen immediately was written : \" Hettie. G. P.,\" spelling it in\ncapitals, and I expressed satisfaction with it, recognising that this\nwas the proper nickname for Henrietta, which she was always called.\nBut as if still uncertain about it, the fact being that father never\ncalled her \" Hettie,\" G. P. continued : \" Ett [?] Hettie. G. P.\"\nThe form of this message is precisely like the previous one, \" Sounds\nlike McLellen, G. P.,\" and the use of \" Hettie \" for Henrietta is\nprecisely like the communication of Tillie for Matilda in 1892, probably\nby this same G. P. (See Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 375).\nIn the sitting for May 31st (p. 440), just as Rector remarked that\nit was my father who was communicating, explaining that \" he seems\na little dazed,\" G. P. suddenly interrupted with the statement : \" I\nam coming, H, to help out. How are you ? \" and made some brief\ncommunications with reference to two of his friends, both of them\nunknown to me. Dr. Hodgson knew one of them intimately and the\nother only by name. Then G. P. follows this with the announcement\nthat my father and mother are present to communicate, but a singular\nverb is used instead of the plural. The plural, however, is immediately\nadded and followed by the statement : \" If I fail grammatically, H.,\nit is owing to the machine. Hear. Cannot always make it work\njust right.\" The communications from my father then proceed without\nfarther interruption (p. 441).\nAgain in the sitting of June 6th, before my father appeared, and\njust as Rector had explained how we should ask certain questions\nwhen my father should announce himself, G. P. suddenly interjected\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 213\na greeting and some questions directed to Dr. Hodgson, the colloquy\nbeing as follows :\u2014\n\" H. how are you ? I have just been called upon to lend a\nhelping hand. You see I am not wholly isolated from you. (R. H. :\nGood, George, were you here last time ?) For a few moments. I\nhelped a man named Charles, but I did not get a chance to say How\nde do, H. ? (R. H. : All right, George.) I am going after the elderly\ngentleman. Look out for me. (R. H. : We will.) Got those theories\nall straightened out yet, H ? (R. H. : Pretty fairly.) I am going.\nAufwiedersehen. G. P.\" (p. 468).\nMy father then appeared with the appropriate message, \"I am\ncoming, James,\" and we began carrying out our plan of asking for\nincidents that were unknown to me. But it is apparent to the\nsimplest observer that G. P.'s interruption and conversation with Dr.\nHodgson had no relevancy either to me personally or to the general\npurpose of the situation.\nAnother sudden interruption, signed by G. P.'s initials, occurred\non June 7th. It was in the midst of the confusion incident to the\nattempt at giving the name of my stepmother. My father, evidently\nappreciating his difficulty in the situation, remarked : \" I feel the\nnecessity of speaking as clearly as possible, James, and I will do my\nbest to do so.\" G. P., probably fearing that my father was not yet clear\nenough to do what he wished, suddenly cautioned him with the\nadvice : \" Wait a bit,\" and as Dr. Hodgson interpreted the word\n\"wait\" as \"said,\" G. P. repeated the phrase, signing it: \"Wait a\nbit. G. P.\" Father then proceeded with his explanation of the\nmistake about my stepmother, all the parties on the \" other side \"\nassuming, apparently, that he was clear enough for the task (p. 481).\nIn all these interpositions of G. P. the marks of an independent\nintelligence are very indicative. There is in them nothing like the\ncharacter of either the inexperienced communicator or Rector, the\namanuensis, nor is there any definite resemblance to either secondary\npersonality in general or to intercommunication between two per\nsonalities in the same subject. They are the interference of a spectator\nand helper on his own responsibility, when he sees that he can effect a\nclear message that is misunderstood or not clearly obtained by Rector.\nSuch dramatic play, involving the personal equation of the real indi\nvidual G. P. as known when living, and here kept distinct from that\nof Rector and others, is a characteristic not easily explicable on any\nbut the spiritistic theory, especially when it includes the transmission\nof evidential data.\nThe last sitting is a drama intelligible enough to be understood\nwithout comment, though it is between Rector and myself, and my\nfather and myself. The play of personality is not of the same sort\n\f214 [part\nH. Eyslop, Ph.D.\nas that which I have analysed so carefully, but it is the action of an\nindependent intelligence under circumstances involving such prompt\nanswers to my statements and questions as the reader will find it\ndifficult to explain on any other hypothesis than the spiritistic. The\ntete a tete conversation that this last sitting represents is opposed to\nthe supposition that the difficulties alluded to in the last case of\ndramatic play are anything but spiritistic.\n(3) Mistakes and Confusions.\nThe third argument for the spiritistic theory is based upon the\nmistakes and confusions. By mistakes I do not mean the positively\nerroneous or false incidents, but only such as might be construed as\nthe natural errors- of memory and interpretation, as we know them in\nliving minds. Still one may ask, when attempting to stretch telepathy\nsufficiently to account for the phenomena by its special and selective\nomniscience, whether positive errors are not a contradiction in such an\nhypothesis. A capacity which can discriminate so effectively between\nthe true and the false in most of its acquisitions, and which can select\nand present the truth in instances that are often far more complex\nthan those in which it is erroneous, ought to know enough, no matter\nhow devilish you make it, to avoid deceiving you by telling what is\nnot true. It ought to know what is false and not to run any risks in\nits policy of deception, conscious or unconscious. A finite intelligence\ncan be supposed to commit errors of this sort, but such unfailing\ndiscrimination between my own personal memories alone and those\nthat are common to me and the alleged communicators, and the\nselection of facts unknown to me from the proper memory of some one\nelse in the world, at any distance and absolutely unknown to the\nmedium, make error of any sort a flat contradiction with such an\nassumed capacity as is necessary to meet the conditions of the case, and\nespecially inconsistent should be the representation of incidents as true\nthat such a power ought to know are false, and which, when dis\ncovered, are sure to bring discredit upon its intentions. On any\nsupposition, of course, we have to reckon with the presence of the\ntrue with the false, but it is far easier on the spiritistic theory to\nadmit the possibility of error than on the telepathic, because we know\nthat in finite minds truth and error live together and we understand\nwhy they do so. But a telepathic power that can organise from the\nscattered memories of various living beings, unknown to the person\nwho is supposed to exercise it, all the elements that go to establish the\npersonal identity of some one that is dead, is not a power that can\ncommit the simple mistakes of a finite memory and consciousness with\nimpunity. Having started on the mission of doing what ordinarily\nseems impossible it must be consistent and not discover any weakness\n\fxLI.] Observation* of Certain Trance Phenomena. 215\nas we know it in the living. Otherwise its pretensions are exposed to\nsuspicion, and we should turn to the hypothesis that in normal life can\nreconcile the facts of error with those of truth, and this hypothesis is\nthe one that gives unity to the phenomena by supposing limitations\nthat are consistent with all the facts. If the false preponderated, we\nmight well measure them off against the theory of chance to account\nfor the. true, or balance the evident limitations of telepathy in such a\ncase with the equal limitations of secondary personality. But the\nerrors are proportionately so few, and when not so few are so simple\nas compared with the complexity of the true, that the limitations\ninvolved in the explanation of the false reflect too seriously upon the\nimmense powers that have to be assumed to account for the true by\ntelepathy. That is to say, its evident finitude conflicts with its\napparent infinity. But I shall not dwell upon this in a general way,\nas my purpose is to deal with it in detail and to interpret the positive\nerrors in the light of those merely partial errors which show just that\nunity and degree of limitation which put the telepathic theory to its\nseverest test, and provide the natural escape from the supposition of\nsecondary personality in regard to the false. The mistakes, therefore,\nupon which the present stress will be laid are those cases in which the\ncommunicator is nearly right, and in which, from that very fact, the\nlimitations of the telepathic hypothesis are unequivocally proved, and\nonce admitted will both serve as an apology for the totally false\nincidents and turn the scientific understanding toward the spirit\nhypothesis as the only one that can rationally account for the truth\nand error combined, owing to its merely repeating the laws of mind\nas actually known, while the use of telepathy must be an appeal to the\nunknown in stretching it to cover the complexities of the whole case.\nWhere the evidence in the positive cases of truth coincided with real\nlimitations to telepathy between living minds we could well expect\nerrors and confusion to be consistent with it. But when the quantity\nand quality of the matter which has to be explained by telepathy, if\nthat is the theory to be proposed, are so great and so complex that it\ndemands such amazing capacities of mind reading, of the near and\nremote, as defy the rationality of mistake and confusion, we are\nbound to pause and reflect. Where the evidence shows a practically\nomnipotent power of discrimination, selection and acquisition, mistakes\nof a kind that ought not to occur on any such supposition must\ncontradict the hypothesis and favor the theory in which mistakes are\nnatural and probable.\nThis argument can be put in a still more effective way. Finite\nmemories in the actual world commit so many mistakes that psychical\nresearchers are afraid to admit human testimony involving the facts\nalleged to prove a future existence. Why, then, be any more exacting\n\f216 [part\nJ. H. Hysloj), Ph.D.\nof supposed discarnate spirits 1 We ought to expect a priori that st\ndiscarnate memory should be defective in its communications from a\ntranscendental world, and this for two very important reasons. (1)\nIf the physiological theory of memory be true, we ought to obtain\nabsolutely nothing whatever of a spirit's past existence from the spirit\nitself, assuming of course that it can or does exist. (2) The con\nditions of any communication at all might very well disturb either\nthe integrity of memory or the message, or both, for the time being\nat least, sufficiently to make the communicator commit very many\nmistakes.\nThe physiological theory of memory is usually couched in such\nterms as to imply the entire dependence of that function upon the\nbrain, even by those who do not think the brain sufficient to account\nfor consciousness at large. This would naturally imply that dissolution\nmust efface all memory of the past, even if the subject still survived.\nThe physiologist, therefore, who concedes the brain theory, cannot\nexpect anything as a message from a discarnate world, even when he\nbelieves, in contradiction with the principle that all rational belief\ndepends upon evidence, that there is such a world. I am not disputing\nthat theory of memory, as I am willing to concede its truth if the\nevidence can be produced in its favor, but I insist that such a theory\nmust destroy all rights to believe in a discarnate world at all, even if\nsuch exists, simply because the belief is without evidence, and its\nreality, when supposed, without interest of any kind. But modifying\nthe doctrine so that brain functions are supposed merely to affect the\nintegrity of memory, not to condition its existence, we should then\nnaturally expect some disturbance in its power of recall in a discarnate\nform, supposing this survival possible. Consequently we have no\nright to prejudge the case by the a priori assumption that spirit\ncommunications should be freer from mistakes than the deliverances\nof consciousness in the abnormal conditions of actual life. But again,\nassuming that the physiological theory of memory is altogether false,\nthe conditions intervening between two disparate worlds must, on\nevery principle of rationality, affect the communications in some way,\nso that mistakes should occur, and these of a kind that ought not to\noccur on the telepathic hypothesis, as that supposition has not to\nassume any but terrestial conditions to deal with. No matter how\nclear the memory may actually be in its own medium, any contact\nwith abnormal conditions must affect its integrity, for the time being\nat least, according to the physiological theory. That ought to be a\ntruism, so that mistakes and confusion, more especially on the spiritistic\ntheory than the telepathic, should be expected and actually strengthen\nthe evidence if they occur in the form which the nature of the case\nenables us to expect.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 217\nAlso we should expect errors if personal identity survives. What-\nwe know of the mind shows it to be finite, and it would have to be\nfinite after death if the general law of continuity holds good at all.\nConsequently, the very supposition of identity would make mistakes of\nmemory, inference, and judgment or interpretation, *he most natural\nthings in the world. The memory should show the same characteristics,\nsuccesses and failures, strength and weakness with which we are\nfamiliar in living persons and the observations of general psychology.\nAny other supposition involves such a change in the capacities of the\nmind as would most likely destroy the consciousness of its identity.\nThe ordinary supposition that spirits, assuming here the possibility of\ntheir existence, have transcendent powers of knowledge and memory,\nis really in conflict with the notion of personal identity, and puts the-\nvery existence of them beyond the reach of science and legitimate\nbelief. Of course this loss of identity might be the fact, but even\nwhen we suppose that the subject of the present consciousness sur\nvives, the supposition of this loss of identity would cut up by the roots\nboth all rational belief in the existence of any such beings and the\ninterest that any sane man might have in a transcendental existence\nif believed. If there be no personal identity, or consciousness of it,\nsupposing that the subject of incarnate consciousness survives, we can\nhave no more rational interest in a hereafter than if we were actually\nannihilated, unless we meant to assume with Plato, on the one handr\nthat the present life affects the destiny and action of this subject\nwithout the memory nexus, as we observe in certain connections\nbetween the supraliminal and subliminal streams of consciousness in\nnormal life, and on the other, that our altruism must be strong enough\nto conform to moral rules that reap no benefit for us, but only for a\nsubject in whose life we cannot participate in any interested way.\nThis may be the correct view, if you like, but it is not consistent with\nthe moral law that recognises the rights of the individual in its sacri\nfices for the socius. But as we cannot appeal to the moral ideal that\nmight be anthropomorphic, or that is liable to this charge, in support\nof a scientific truth, we must adjust our morals to the facts of the\nuniverse, whether we survive or not. Nevertheless, it is legitimate\nboth to indicate that inconsistency and to show that the expectation\nof such transcendent powers of mind as are usually assumed implies\na change in the capacities of the individual that must involve the\nloss of the personal identity which is supposed. From every point of\nview, therefore, we must grant that, on the supposition of personal\nidentity at all, the communications should show the mistakes and con\nfusions of ordinary life, multiplied and intensified both by the con\nditions of communication and by the absence of the physiological\nconditions that affect the action, even when they do not absolutely\n\f218 [part\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ndetermine the existence, of memory. Now, as a matter of fact, the\nresemblance between the phenomena of incarnate memories and those\nof the alleged discarnate minds is remarkably exact. Besides showing\npersonal identity in what is unmistakably true, the incidents often\nexhibit just that error which we should at once classify as an illusion of\nmemory in actual life, and consequently furnish us both a natural\n\u25a0explanation of the phenomena and the evidence of their inconsistency\nwith the assumption of omnipotent powers on the part of the medium's\nbrain. Hence to decide the case against spiritism on the ground of\nmistakes and confusions is to make the following assumptions: (1)\nthat the discarnate life, supposing it true, involves certain perfections\nwhich, in fact, are inconsistent with the personal identity that the\nbeliever in a future existence usually maintains; (2) that physiological\nconditions in the present life do not affect either the integrity or the\naction of memory ; (3) that transcendental conditions, even when the\nmemory is perfect, do not influence the fact and the nature of commu\nnication. Now either all of these assumptions are false, as I hold them\nto be, or we have a contest beween the purely physiological theories of\nmemory (discarding the psychological theory as in any case sub jttdice),\nand the contradictions in the telepathic hypothesis. I am assuming\nfor the sake of argument that the physiological theory of memory\nis inconsistent with any other theory of consciousness than the\nmaterialistic, though this may not be the case as a fact, as I\nshould be inclined to maintain on ordinary psychological grounds. As\nmemory is absolutely necessary to the consciousness of personal\nidentity, though it might not be necessary to the identity of the subject\nitself, it is the condition of establishing the identity of a discarnate\nspirit, supposing its existence. But a purely physiological theory of\nmemory both eliminates all hope of proving the existence and persis\ntence of a soul, and shuts us up to telepathy to account for the\ncoincidences in these phenomena that exclude chance as an\nexplanation. If then we ignore the force of the psychological\ntheory of memory against the physiological theory of the same,\nthe whole question narrows itself down to the adequacy of tele\npathy to account for the facts. If it is not adequate the physiological\ntheory of memory is not true, but vulnerable from two points of view\ninstead of one only. If telepathy covers the case the situation is just\nwhat it is between the psychological and the physiological schools. But\nin any case the issue centres in the capacities of telepathy, all other\ncontroversies being suspended on the termination of this issue. Con\nsequently the problem is to see if the mistakes and confusions in the\nPiper phenomena are consistent with the suppositions that have to be\nmade to explain the incidents that are not mistakes, or whether it is\nnot more rational to suppose survival as only an extension of the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 219\nprinciples that wo already know in the action of finite consciousness.\nThis question will have to be discussed in the concrete, and finally\nsettled by the individual himself.\nI have already alluded to the nature of this argument in discussing\nboth the unity of consciousness and the dramatic play of personality\nwhen the occasion made it useful to do so, and hence the general import\nof it ought to be detected in what has been said, especially in that\npart of the dramatic play which is ostensibly undertaken to avoid error\nitself. But I shall not repeat at length these incidents, as a mere\nreference to them is sufficient to remind the reader of their pertinence\nin this connection. I may call attention to the individual instances\nof mistake and confusion in the midst of any sustained dramatic play,\nbut it will not be necessary to repeat the whole case for the reader\nto understand the force of what I am contending for here. What we\nhave to do at present is to keep clear the magnitude of the telepathic\npowers that have to be assumed to explain the true incidents, and\nsimply ask whether certain mistakes and confusions are at all consistent\nwith that supposition, and so whether the spiritistic hypothesis is\nnot the simpler and easier one as well as more in conformity with the\nknown laws of the finite mind and of scientific method.\nI have already alluded to certain mistakes and confusions in the first\nsitting that I had, as I was discussing its dramatic play, but I have\nnot fully indicated their significance. The incident that calls special\nattention to the feature which I wish to discuss at present is the\nappearance of the lady who claimed to be my mother. The names and\nincidents connected therewith were false in so far as relevancy to me\nis concerned. As I have already remarked (p. 186), telepathy, when\nit shows such remarkable powers in the acquisition of the sitter's\nmemories, ought not to make such an error as this insistence that the\nlady was my mother. The medium's experience in supposed tele\npathic processes ought naturally to suggest surprise at such tentative\nendeavours as are found in my first sitting. All this groping about\nand attendant confusion is incomprehensible on any theory that\nmakes experience worth anything in the development of power,\nand so renders equally plausible the hypothesis which has to\nencounter the natural difficulties imposed by the test conditions which\nI was observing, unless we maintain that the medium has to begin her\neducation in the telepathic access on each occasion of a new sitter.\nThis supposition discounts the influence of experience with others, but\nscepticism in the absence of adequate knowledge of the real capacities\nof telepathy enjoys some impunity in proposing an objection of this\nsort. We might suppose that on the admission of a new sitter it\nrequires some time to cast over the whole mass of memories and to\nobtain the clue to the proper selection of incidents. This is all very\n\f220 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ningenious and obtains such force as it has, and that is not much, from\nthe limitations of our knowledge in regard to the process of what we\nchoose to call telepathy, but it is a priori and we have a right to\nexact of its advocate empirical evidence both within and indepen\ndently of the Piper case for its assertion, and an application of the\nhypothesis to details, because the facts so thoroughly satisfy the\ncriterion for personal identity that spiritism can undoubtedly explain\nthe phenomena, so that the only excuse for any other hypothesis must\n\u25a0ie either that it explains the phenomena more easily, or that it is a\nprobable alternative that demands exclusion before rational conviction\nis left without a choice. What there is in telepathy to supply the\ngrounds for either of these alternatives must be left to those who are\nable to furnish scientific evidence for their contention. But there is\nno special immunity in assuming that the theory is apparent or\nprobable on the face of it, nor that the opposite theory demands any\nmore credulity than a conception which is little more, or perhaps\nnothing more, than a name for general coincidences whose content is\nignored in the application of it. That is to say, the coincidence\nbetween variations, based on the personal equation, in experimental\ntelepathy and variations on a similarly supposed basis in the Piper\nphenomena is not suflicient evidence of their identity in abstraction\nfrom the peculiar and striking psychological content which distinguishes\nthem so radically, no matter how much difficulty the statement of the\nsupposition may give in a formal argument.\nBut there is another objection to this assumption that experience\nhas to begin over again in each new sitter. This is not always the\nfact. Perhaps it is not often so. It is very frequent that the first\nsitting is as good as any other. I might even say with tolerable\naccuracy that the difference between the first and other sittings is not\ngreat enough in most cases to attribute it to any other cause than\nthe natural difficulties of establishing the proper connections for\ncommunication such as the spiritistic theory would require, so that\nwe have to suppose telepathy always duplicating just what the\nopposing theory demands. That sort of process should suggest to any\none who has a sense of humour the dangerous proximity of his assump\ntion to the spiritistic theory itself. Again, this doctrine that each new\ntrial demands time and experience to segregate the facts necessary to\nimitate personal identity necessarily breaks down on the variations\nbetween sittings themselves. The experience counts for nothing unless\nother conditions are favourable at the same time. But conditions that\nsubordinate experience to themselves are entitled to a more important\nplace than experience itself, and suggest greater consistency with\nspiritism than with any alternative theory. In support of this\ncontention the reader may find it interesting to compare my sittings\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 221\nfor June 6th (p. 467), 7th (p. 477), and 8th (p. 487), and also Dr.\nHodgson's sittings for February 16th (p. 384), 20th (p. 391), and 22nd\n(p. 396). See also the Statistical Summary (Nos. III., IV., and V.,\np. 119, and Nos. VI., VII., and VIII., p. 120). In these there is no\nspecial evidence to confirm the general theory of experience, but much\nto suggest the influence of very different conditions upon the result.\nFurther suspicion against the influence of experience in either form is\naroused by the incidents of the first sitting, in spite of the judgment\nwhich I originally passed upon it. If we do not accept the incidents\nas evidence of telepathy we are confronted with the contrast between\nthis and the second sitting where the evidence of something unusual is\nquite apparent. If we do accept the existence of the supernormal in\nthe first sitting it takes that form which does not suggest anything\nlik?} the gradual development of its powers. The giving of the names\nof my brother Charles and my sisters Annie and Margaret, the allusion\nto the death of my mother's sister with its right relation in time, the\nintimation that both my father and mother were dead, all the various\nspecific incidents identifying my brother Charles, and two or three\napproximately correct names and incidents have their cogency increased\nby two facts that show how large the supposed telepathy must be, in\nspite of the assumption of its need for education in the individual case.\nThese two facts are the name and relationship of my father's sister\nand the important statement \"Give me my hat and let me go,\" both\nof which represented incidents unknown to me and hence extend the\nsupposed telepathy so far under conditions imagined to involve\nlimitations to the process that we may well wonder whether our\ntheory of experience and groping about in the memory of the sitter is\nnot a mere subterfuge. The supposition has no other strength than\nthe fact that the limitations of telepathy have not been positively\nassigned. Ignorance, however, is not proof. I grant that the\nargutnentum ad ignorantiam is a legitimate resource for raising the\nstandard of evidence, but it does not involve an explanation.\nOn the contrary, it complicates explanation by necessitating the\nextension of an hypothesis without regard to the proper unity of the\nphenomena. Of course a man who finds a certain formal resemblance\nbetween telepathy and what is supposed to be spiritistic may not be\neasily convinced against his will, and it is not a part of my task to\ninsist upon this result. I am more interested in the anticipation of\nthe sceptic's objections than I am in convincing him on this point.\nBut I think a dispassionate examination of the facts, as indicated, will\nresult in the recognition of the spiritistic position on this particular\nquestion as at least equally credible with the telepathic, while in other\nissues, and possibly in this also, it presents superior credentials for\nfavourable consideration,\n\f222 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nThere are three general facts that show there is no excuse for con\nfusion in the telepathic theory. The first is the circumstance that\nat no time did any amount of experience suffice to secure communica\ntions with certain persons who were even more entitled to recognition\non the telepathic theory than some that were admitted. I could name\ntwo instances very easily in my sittings, and it is all the more striking\nwhen we know that one of these two was implied in two of the messages\ngiven (p. 316). The second is that telepathy can show no special\nreason for the short time that it is possible to communicate. The\nthird fact is the circumstance that telepathy has no excuse for the\ndifferences between \" communicators,\" one being c'ear and the other\nconfused. Consequently the spiritistic theory has the advantage of\nbeing far more consistent than telepathy with the conditions\nthat we should be entitled to suppose and with the facts as we\nknow them. Concrete illustrations will indicate this better than\ngeneralisations.\nAny reader can compare the communications of my father with\nthose of my \"uncle Clarke,\" and see for himself the very striking\ndifference between them. My uncle never got his name through\nrightly, and only in one or two passages did he even get the facts\nclear (pp. 90-95, 423;. Nearly all his efforts ended in hopeless\nconfusion, and much the same is true of my cousin Robert McCIellan.\nSeveral times he got some important matters clear and definite, and\nwas always better than my \" uncle Clarke.\" But he never became as\nclear as his own father (p. 470), nor so clear as lny brother and\nsister. Now the data in my mind were the same for all these per\nsonalities and also for persons who never appeared at all, so that tele\npathy is absolutely without excuse for its confusions and its failures to\nproduce certain other persons. One or two instances of confusion or\nof difference in clearness might be attributable to the \" conditions \"\nunder which telepathy acts, but that this characteristic should invariably\ndistinguish one communicator from another involves such a stretching\nof the hypothesis of \"conditions,\" all unknown, that we may well ask\nwhether what we know of the personal equation in different men, on\nthe one hand, and the admitted fact of necessary difficulties in any\ncase of communication, on the other, does not consist far more readily\nwith spiritism than with the a priori elasticity of telepathy and its\n\" conditions.\"\nI wish to lay considerable stress upon this failure to get my uncle's\nname. In the case of most of the names the difficulties either did not\nshow themselves or were soon overcome. The names of my half-sister\n(Henrietta) and my cousin (Lucy McCIellan) gave some difficulty,\nthe latter especially, but were obtained at last correctly, if we can\nregard \"Hettie\" as correctly representing Henrietta, though she was\n\fxu.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 223\nnever called by anything but Henrietta by my father and the family.\nThere was also a little difficulty in getting through my cousin's name,\nRobert McClellan, but it was not much. My uncle's name, however,\nthat of Carruthers, never came rightly. The exemption from difficulties\nvaries, as I have shown, with the communicator, or with the conditions\npossibly under which the messages are delivered. But the reader will\nnotice that very often proper names are given promptly and without a\nstruggle, and in all cases with two or three exceptions, which I did not\ntry to have completed, were gotten correctly at last. Now there is\nnothing but a very natural psychological reason, connected with the\ncertainty of difficulties and obstacles in the way of spirit communica\ntion, for mistaking the names \" uncle Clarke \" and '.' uncle Charles \"\nfor that of Carruthers, the right name, especially after his Christian\nname James, had once been given. The mistake in this case, as it\nmust appear to the cautious scientist, is so great that I should have no\nright whatsoever to suppose that this particular uncle was meant,\nwere it not that time and again incidents, names, and relationships\nwere indicated by him and about him that were true of no one\nelse in the world, even when taken singly, to say nothing of\ntheir collective pertinency. This is strengthened by the natural\napproximation to his correct name. One can see very easily how\n\"Carruthers\" might be confused with the name \"Charles\" in the\ntelephone, and also how a more careful effort to make it clear by laying\nthe stress upon the first syllable \" Car \" might lead to the name\n\" Clarke \" by suggestion, and as the representation of the communica\ntions in the whole history of the Piper and similar cases is uniform in\nits comparison with something like telephonic processes, we have in\nthe spiritistic theory a better approximation to an explanation than\nin the telepathic, which ought not to get into trouble with an aural\nmemory when it has the visual to draw upon also. The mistake is\nperfectly conceivable on the theory of spiritism, especially when we\nconsider the effect of unfamiliar language in these communications.\nCompare the phrase \" United Presbyterian \" (p. 492) and experi\nments through a tube (p. 624), and also my own mistake mentioned\nin a footnote (p. 240). A qua\u00bbi omnipotent telepathy which\ncan reproduce all the complex incidents on which I have commented\nin*the discussion of the dramatic play of personality, and so easily defy\nthe limitations of time and space, ought not so utterly to fail in this\nname when it so nearly achieves success on the analogies of both the\nknown action of the telephone and the represented action of spirit\ncommunication. The assumption of telepathy requires us always to\nexplain why it is constantly reproducing characteristics in all their\nvariety and complexity, adaptation and intelligent unity, that ought\nto be found in spiritistic phenomena.\n\f224 [part\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nAnother illustration of a very simple mistake that represents a\nnatural illusion of memory is that in which my father mentions a\n\" flute,\" which he refers to my brother Will, the correction of which\nmakes it the guitar that belonged to my brother George (p. 461). In\nthis also there was a very pretty piece of dramatic playing that is\nmost interesting in its mechanical features. I shall notice this again.\nBut the important fact for remark now is the circumstance that the\nmention of the \" flute \" and the reference of its ownership to the\nwrong person has no excuse on the telepathic hypothesis, as the\nincident in the form in which it is first told was false. Moreover,\nbefore I had recognised the meaning of the message it was spontaneously\ncorrected to \" fiddle,\" an instrument that more nearly resembled the\nguitar that was finally indicated by action of the hand, but it\nwas still technically wrong and not derived telepathically, unless we\nsuppose this function liable to the same apperceptive errors as ordinary\njudgment. How easily it might be an illusion or error of memory on\nthe part of my father under any conditions whatsoever, incarnate or\ndiscarnate, is indicated by the following facts. It was about 1878 when\nmy brother got the guitar, and it was about 1880 when he took it with\nhim into another part of the State, almost totally abandoning the use\nof it there, and my father never saw it from that date to his death,\nsixteen years, unless when on a visit there in 1889. He was never in\nthe least interested in the instrument when my brother was at home,\nexcept to say that he thought my brother would never do anything\nwith it. Hence it is not an unnatural mistake to mention the wrong\nperson as owner, especially when it is also known that the brother\nmentioned was closely associated with the other in all the incidents\nand relationships involved in its proper ownership. But whether the\nerror be attributed to an illusion of memory as an apology for it is\nnot the chief matter of interest, but its conflict with the telepathic\nhypothesis which has been so successful, according to supposition, in\nfar more complicated incidents, and here is able to come near enough\nto suggest what was in mind, but is wholly false in the details.\nThe explanation of this confusion of the flute with a guitar is not\nso easy, as it involves some knowledge of supposable transcendental\nconditions of existence for which there is little or no evidence in this\nrecord. The attempt here to recall the name of the instrument 'by\nimitating the manner in which it was played, and the similar attempts\nto describe the uses of the cane (p. 400) by reproducing the move\nments involved, and to indicate the \"gold bug\" on the cane that\nI gave my father by drawing it (p. 495), are illustrations of possible\nactions, if the conception that the soul involves a facsimile of the\nbodily form be correct (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 301). Let us at\nleast imagine this state of the case in order to represent the supposable\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Pkenonena. 225\neffort here to communicate with me. We see that Rector is finally\nreduced to the necessity of imitating the mode of playing the instru\nment as the only resource for correcting the original mistake. But\nhow did the error occur at first ? Assuming that the communicator\nhad forgotten the name of the guitar we can imagine that he himself\nacted as if holding such an instrument upon his shoulder and picked\nit with his fingers, and the suggestion to Rector was that of a flute,\nwhich, on the communicator's denying it, was corrected to \" fiddle,\"\nthen \" vial \" for violin, and again on dissent, to actions that would\nconvey to me the idea of what was meant. The mistakes, therefore,\non this construction become perfectly natural and explainable on the\nspiritistic theory and incomprehensibly complex and absurd on the\ntelepathic. The difficulty that strikes one is the assumption of any\nthing like the \" astral body \" doctrine which is apparently so necessary\nfor this representation of the case. We are so accustomed to the\nCartesian conception of a soul which refuses it any property of exten\nsion that we endeavour to conceive it after the idea of Boscovich's\npoints of force. But there is no absolutely necessary obligation to\naccept the preconceptions of Cartesian dualism in order to eliminate\nthe associations of matter for conceiving a world transcending sense,\nas is well illustrated in the phenomena of X rays, where we have a\nwhole universe of force that does not reveal itself to sense perception\nin anything but its effects, and it is an invisible world of force in a\ndefinite relation to extension. There is therefore nothing but the\nsuperstition of Cartesian authority for clinging to the idea that the\nsoul cannot occupy space, and the \" astral body \" theory, divested of\nits absurd theosophic assumptions and unwarranted speculations, may,\nfor all that we know, represent the truth. But we cannot assume it,\nnor can we any more assume the theory that must represent it as a\npoint of force or spaceless reality. Either may be true, but must be\nproved or rendered rational by the necessity of supposing one or the\nother to explain facts. There is evidence, such as it is, in the records\nof psychical research to make it possible, if we assume a soul at all,\nthat either it or the \"spiritual body\" occupies space, and on that\nassumption the dramatic representation in this guitar incident becomes\nintelligible, but on the telepathic, hypothesis it is impossible to obtain\nany intelligible unity to the phenomena, and it is perhaps equally difficult\nto imagine their occurrence on the supposition that the soul is a\nspaceless reality, though I can conceive it possible by means that it is\nnot necessary to elaborate, as it is only the difficulties of telepathy,\nnot the legitimacy of either the Cartesian or the theosophic concep\ntion of the soul, that I am endeavouring to enforce. Telepathy ought\nto obtain guitar as easily as either flute, fiddle or violin, and so simple\na mistake is incompatible with the powers it is usually supposed to\nQ\n\f226 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ndisplay. But the mistake is doubly interesting in the light of the\nhistorical fact that in my positive knowledge father was far more\nfamiliar with the flute, fife, fiddle or violin, and organ than he was\nwith the guitar, both in regard to the matter of names and the\ninstruments. He knew absolutely nothing about the guitar except\nas in the possession of my brother.\nAnother illustration of a somewhat similar confusion and mistake,\nis in the set of incidents connected with the communications about the\ncanes (p. 397). The mistakes in this instance are not due to anything\nexactly like lapses of memory, but are much more like the confusion of\ntwo similar incidents in association and memory, and to imperfections\nthat belong to the transmission of the messages. An illustration of\nthe first feature of this instance is in the sentence which apparently\nspeaks of one cane, but which is false on that supposition, though true\nsupposing that the communicator was trying to speak of two canes\nthat answer to the different parts of the sentence. It was false that\nfather ever had a curved handled cane on which he had carved his\ninitials, but it was true that his children had twenty-five years before\ngiven him a gold-headed ebony cane on which his initials were carved,\nand I had given him a cane with a curved handle about one year\nbefore his death. But it turns out that the elaborate description of\nthe various uses of the cane, an account which I could not understand\nat the time, was not intended to refer to this curved handled cane that\nwas suggested to me, but to another curved handled one that had been\nbroken and mended with a ring of tin (p. 533). Hence it appears as\nif two canes were here in mind, and if the representation that is\ngenerally given of the imperfections of the messages be true this\nconjecture . that the attempt was to mention both canes has its\npossibilities. But without apologising for the case at present, the\ndifficulty that is presented to telepathy in this complicated incident\nis that of being able to discriminate so clearly in all important\ninstances and yet falling into hopeless confusion at a very simple\ndiscrimination in this instance. It is also farther complicated with\nthe fact that, whatever association is permitted to it in the acquisition\nof incidents, in this case there is the fact that I knew nothing about\nmy father's habits in the uses of the cane as indicated. Hence we\nhave to suppose, in this attempt to apply telepathic association to\nexplain the confusion of like memories, that this associative power can\ninstantly reach out into space and secure what I did not know to\nfinish the picture of what I did know, no distinction being drawn in\ntelepathic acquisitions between the known, the remembered and the\nforgotten, as well as the unknown. This involves instant rapport with\nany living person with the implied infinite power of discrimination\nbetween the right and the wrong facts. With such a power there\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 227\nought not to occur such a simple error as the confusion of the gold-\nheaded and the curved-handled cane, nor after the easy and clear\naccess of similar facts at any distance should there have been this\npantomime process describing the uses of the cane. The facts ought\nto have been clearly given. But when we know the facts about the\ncane, and recognise that the description which Rector gives fits exactly\nwhat I ascertained in regard to my father's habits on such occasions\nas my notes describe (pp. 415-416) we have an intelligible pheno\nmenon. Of course it takes the \" spiritual body \" theory to make this\nintelligible in descriptive language to our imagination, though the\nvery confusion and difficulties of communication in such incidents\nmay be due to the falsity of that doctrine, and I do not care to urge\nit as in any way necessary or indispensable to the occurrence of the\nphenomena.\nThe next instance of mistake is much like the one just discussed in\none of its aspects. It is the case of referring what was true of one\nbrother to another of whom it was not true, though in all but the\ncharacter of the incidents that the communicator had in mind the main\ncircumstance applied to both. I refer to notes for details (p. 516).\nBut it was an instance in which the communicator, when living, had\ntaken objections to the social affiliations of two brothers, the grounds\nand reasons being very different in each case. Here is a situation for\nnatural confusion in any mind, where either the memory is imperfect\nor the conditions disturbing to the communications, whatever the\nmemory. The events were contemporaneous and of the same general\ncharacter, but different in their specific marks. Association would\nnaturally bring both into consciousness, and difficulties in the com\nmunication might do the rest, or there might be a momentary illusion\nof memory in the recall of the events, and any sensitiveness of the\ncommunicating \" machine \" might reflect that illusion or a part of it.\nThere is much in the record to illustrate the influence of precisely the\nfactor just mentioned (pp. 324, 430). But whether or not, it is certain\nthat the lapse of twenty years, as was the case in this instance, with\nthe unquestionably difficult conditions of communication would easily\nproduce such a mistake as we find here. Nor can we say that it might\nbe precisely the error that telepathy would make in its attempt to use\nthe law of association, for it showed no tendency to commit such a\nmistake in the tax incidents (p. 493) which represented a situation\nsimilar to this. The distinction was clearly made between the latter\nby the communicator, and obliviscence on my part resulted in the con\nfusion on my side until my correspondence showed that the communi\ncator was right. Moreover, in all other instances in which telepathy\nis supposed and in which association is a necessary factor, its command\nof that function is so perfect by the terms of its success in getting the\nQ 2\n\f228 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nrightly connected incidents, that its mistake in such a case is an\nevidence of weakness that discredits it as an explanatory hypothesis.\nIn support of the naturalness of this mistake in both instances\nabove described, and of its explicability in terms of a personal con\nsciousness other than the medium's brain, I shall narrate exactly\nparallel instances in my own experience. They show that if I had\nbeen a communicating spirit at the time I should have committed the\nsame error.\nOn September 4th last I was reading Miss Alice Johnson's paper on\n\" Coincidences,\" and when I came to the case of the boat race which\nI had reported myself (Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 253), I noticed the\nfact that I had completely forgotten that I had reported it, though\nI recalled it presently, but thought at the same time that it was the\nsame boat race which figures in the \" Experiments on Identification of\nPersonality \" (p. 579). I instantly recalled the persons that took\npart in this experiment and it was some minutes before I discovered\nthat the instances were entirely different. The interest in the fact\nlies in the circumstance that if I had been a communicating spirit at\nthe time, I should not only have confused the two boat races, but I\nshould have sent through the wrong names in connection with one of\nthem. A precisely similar case was the confusion of the 23rd Psalm\nwith the 1 33rd, as noted in another instance where I did not discover\nmy mistake for more than six months, and then only under the\ncorrection of my wife (p. 612).\nOne of the most interesting illusions of this kind on my part is the\nfollowing, and it will not be less interesting to know that the discovery\nof it destroys one of the illustrations that I had originally quoted\nagainst the spiritistic theory in the first draft of this discussion.\nWhen I was re-reading the Report of Professor Lodge after my\nsittings (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 520), I was struck with the resem\nblance between the incident there told of an accident with a boat and\na reference to a boat by my father (p. 478). I at once noted the fact,\nand, without comparing it with my record, accepted my memory\nof it and raised the question whether it was not a good piece of\nevidence for the unity of the two regimes, the Phinuit and Imperator\npersonalities. In my first draft, therefore, of my report, relying\nwholly upon my memory of the incidents, I said, \"The incident which\nmy father narrates about the upsetting of a boat and his sister helping\nhim to dry his clothes is almost exactly duplicated in all its details by\na similar communication to Professor Lodge in England in 1889.\" But\nin the revision of this draft I was induced to examine my statements\nin the light of the record and the following mistakes occur in the\nabove statement placed in quotation marks. My father says nothing\nof the upsetting of a boat and nothing of his sister's helping him dry\n\fxLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 229\nhis clothes, though the language \" helped me out of the difficult\/ '\nmight be so interpreted in this and other ways from the context (see\np. 478). Nor does my father say, as was indicated of the sister in\nProfessor Lodge's incident, that she had \" screened \" the accident from\nthe knowledge of others. The source of the illusion on my part was as\nfollows :\u2014\nThe incident narrated by my father does not indicate that a boat\nwas upset, but at another time my brother Charles mentioned in his\nmessage about a boat that it had been overturned (p. 464), and also\nfather, in his incident about the broken waggon and wheel, said that\nhis sister Eliza had \" tried to cover it up, so it would not leak out, so\nto speak \" (p. 470). It is perfectly clear, therefore, that my memory\nhad confused three different incidents in making up the identity of\nmy case with that of Professor Lodge. Now if I had been a com\nmunicator under the circumstances I should have transmitted or made\na statement which the sitter would have had to condemn as false, or\nreconstruct from his own knowledge of the facts into three different\nincidents. Compare the incident of the \" chest,\" etc., Note 93, p. 534.\nI must mention still another illusion of memory on my part, of\nprecisely the same kind as the above. It occurred while Dr. Hodgson\nand myself were revising together the record, and comparing it with\nthe original automatic writing. The expression \" the whole city \"\noccurred in connection with the reference to the incident 'of the fire\n(p. 324), and I recalled the burning of Chicago which had interested\nand affected my father very much. Dr. Hodgson asked when this\noccurred, and I replied that it was in 1873. Dr. Hodgson remarked\nthat he thought it was in 1872. I replied that it must have been in\n1873, because it had occurred after I started to college, and this was\nin the year 1873. The incident that made me think so was the\nrecollection that I had remarked the smoky appearance of the country\nat the time, and the locality in mind was that of the college which\nI was attending. In a moment I recalled that it was my father\nwho had remarked in my presence at the time of the Chicago fire that\npossibly the smoky atmosphere, though we were three hundred miles\nfrom Chicago, was influenced by that conflagration. The moment that\nthis memory occurred to me I found that my previous impression must\nbe false, as father's observation applied to the old home locality,\nwhich was fifty miles from the place where I was attending college,\nand this latter place he had never seen. For a moment I was puzzled\nto account for the lapse of memory. But the next moment I recalled\nthe fact that during the dry fall at college a large forest fire broke out\nthat did very much damage, and the smoke in the surrounding country\nreminded me precisely of the smoky sky and atmosphere that we\nobserved at the time of the Chicago fire. I have often thought of the\n\f230 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ntwo incidents together. I looked up the matter and found that the\nChicago fire occurred in 1871. My memory, then, was partly wrong\nand partly right in its recollection. There was a distinct connection\nbetween the two events, but it was mental and not chronological or\notherwise objective. Here again, therefore, if I had been communi\ncating, I should have confused the incidents of two separate events in\nmy communication, though I should have been correct in the subjective\nconnection given them, a fact, however, which the sitter might never\nhave ascertained or appreciated.\nIn the messages of my sittings we have exactly the mental situa\ntion of these cases duplicated and the identical error committed. The\nlittle resemblance that the incidents have to telepathy, especially the\nlast, is shown by the statement about \"catching the fish on Sunday\"\nand connecting it with my brother Frank, which, if it be pertinent at\nall, represents two facts that are false. First, that the fishing was on\nSunday, and second that \" Sunday \" is a word that my father never\nused, as he absolutely and always used the word \" Sabbath.\" He forbade\nits use on our part. At best the incident is only partly true, and if\naltogether false is certainly not telepathic. Then, if telepathy has such\ngood command of the memories and associations in the minds of others,\nthe word \" Sabbath \" ought to have been obtained here from its\nassociation with my father's name, and especially as this usage is also\nRector's, who has to be treated on the telepathic hypothesis as\nMrs. Piper's secondary personality.\nWhile I am indicating illusions of memory on the part of the living\nthat are duplicated in these sittings I may as well indicate two more,\nwhich will show the need of some charity for spirit communications.\nIn my conversation with one of the persons living and named in this\nrecord, I was asked by him : \" How is your sister Eliza, who lives in\nPhiladelphia?\" Now my sister by the name of Eliza, or Lida, was\nnever known or heard of by this man, and she does not live in\nPhiladelphia. It was my aunt Nannie who lived in Philadelphia,\nPa., and it was she that he referred to in the question. When I told\nhim that he was mistaken in regard to the name, he could not believe\nit, and it was some time before I could make the matter clear to him.\nAbout an hour later his wife, who had not been in the room during\nthis conversation, asked me : \" How is your Aunt Eliza, who lives in\nPhiladelphia ? \" I found that she also meant my aunt Nannie. Now\nmy aunt Eliza lives in Ohio and not in Philadelphia. Both of these\naunts, Nannie and Eliza, had recently lost their husbands, one of\nwhom, James Carruthers, was a communicator in this record. It is\nnot probable that either of the inquirers had heard of his death. The\nother, the husband of aunt Nannie, was a minister of some standing\nin his church, and his death was known to the inquirers, as I found by\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 231\ninterrogating them. Both were thus mistaken in regard to the name\nand place of residence of the person of whom they were inquiring.\nIf a discarnate spirit had committed it, no apology would have been\nallowable for it, except that telepathy, in spite of its amazing and\nelastic achievements, might slip in this way, but a human intelli\ngence never !\nThere were several mistakes in the use or relationship of proper\nnames which had already been given rightly by certain communicators,\nthe error sometimes being by the person most naturally expected to\nmake such an error. For instance, my deceased brother Charles, who\nnever, when living, knew or heard of the Lucy McClellan mentioned\nin this record, and with whom, of course, the name was never associated\nin my mind, called her his aunt, when she was his cousin (Cf.\n\" step-sister,\" p. 462).\nThere is another remarkable illustration of both the dramatic\nplay of personality and at least apparent mistake that should be\nexamined in detail. It is the case in which my cousin Robert McClellan\nendeavours to speak the name of his wife, which was evidently not\nunderstood by Rector (pp. 442, 508). My cousin Robert McClellan\nmade a reference apparently to his \" dear relatives \" and exhibited\nhis usual confusion. But Rector tells the communicator at once\nto \" speak slower, I cannot hear it,\" and then says to him :\n\" Well, go out then and come again with it,\" and receives the\nreply, \" All right.\" Rector then says to me : \" Yes, but I did\nnot get what he said last. He said something about Lucy,\nbut it was not for thee, friend,\" evidently alluding by the word\n\"friend\" to Dr. Hodgson, because he at once explains to Dr.\nHodgson that \"the Lucy is not Jessie's sister,\" meaning Miss Lucy\nEdmunds and her sister Jessie, who had at some previous time com\nmunicated with Miss Edmunds, Dr. Hodgson's secretary. He then\nsaid directly to me that the \" Lucy \" was for me. Assuming that it\nwas my cousin Robert McClellan that was communicating, I asked\nhim what relation this Lucy was to him, hoping he would say his\nwife, and received the irrelevant answer, \" Mother said it only a\nmoment ago, and she is on father's side, and he comes and speaks of her\noften.\" Dr. Hodgson then asked Rector to \" state explicitly who this\nLucy is,\" and Rector replied :\n\" Did not hear it. All right. We will see about it as both Annie and\nher father have brought her here several times, and aunt Nannie will know\nwell. (I shall ask aunt Nannie about it.) She is a cousin of thine, friend.\nDost thou not hear ? (Yes. I hear clearly). But do not remember.\n(I remember one cousin Nannie and one aunt Nannie). Yes, she is. Aunt\nNannie is in the body and cousin Nannie is in the spirit. (Yes, your . . .\nwhat relation is this cousin Nannie to you ?) She is my sister. (R. H.\nWhose sister ?) LUCY'S \" (p. 442).\n\f232 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nNow I can make both the truth and the possible confusion in this\npassage clear only by an elaborate explanation which will show it\nperfectly intolerable on the telepathic hypothesis. First let me name\nthe dramatis persona: in the case. There are my cousin Robert\nMcClellan, the communicator ; my aunt Nannie, who is also his aunt\nNannie ; my cousin Nannie, who is his sister, and whom he constantly\ncalled \"aunt Nannie,\" during the long illness in which she nursed him,\nin deference to the habits of his children; \"cousin Nannie,\" which I\ninterpret as a mistake of the \" machine \" for \" Annie,\" referring to my\nsister, the communicator's cousin ; and Rector.\nI did not at the time understand the communicator's reference to\nhis mother and the statement that \" she is on father's side.\" Hence\nDr. Hodgson's request to state explicitly who this Lucy was. Now\nwhen Rector said : \" Both Annie and her father have brought her here\nseveral times,\" he most evidently had his mother, my father's sister,\nor possibly his stepmother in mind. Now, again, when Rector says :\n\" Aunt Nannie will know well,\" he makes a statement which will be true\nwhether it refers to the aunt of both the communicator and myself by\nthat name, or to his sister whom he called \"aunt\" as explained. Both\nwould know what I was expected to know here. But when I said that\nI should \" ask aunt Nannie about it,\" I had in mind the aunt of both\nof us, and hence a most interesting possible confusion begins. The\nanswer : \" She is a cousin of thine, friend,\" is absurd in relation to\nwhat I had in mind. It was correct as referring to his sister.\nSuppose the statement \" Aunt Nannie will know well \" refers to\nmy aunt, and the answer to my question, if the \" she \" refers to her,\nis both absurd and false, and telepathy has no claims. If the phrase\n\"aunt Nannie\" refers to my cousin's sister, as explained, and the\n\" she \" is supposed also to refer to her, the statement that she is my\ncousin is correct, but it is not what I had in my mind at the time, nor\ndoes it represent anything that I knew of, as the discovery of the\ncommunicator's habit of calling his sister his \" aunt \" was an unknown\nfact to me at the time, and one that it was not possible under the\ncircumstances for me to know, as my notes show (p. 508), and telepathy\nwould have tremendous odds to face, as it would involve the instan\ntaneous act of acquiring the fact in the distant West from an unknown\nmemory. Assuming then that the communicator had his sister in\nmind, called \" aunt \" as explained, and that he did not understand\nmy reference to aunt Nannie, the aunt of both of us, his answer :\n\" she is a cousin of thine, friend,\" made by Rector is correct. I\nhad in mind in my statement: \"I remember one cousin Nannie\nand one aunt Nannie,\" the former the sister of the communicator\nand the latter the aunt of both of us. Supposing the communicator\nto have in mind the same persons, his answer that : \" Aunt Nannie\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 233\nis in the body and cousin Nannie is in the spirit,\" is only half true\nand is half false, so that telepathy here breaks down. Supposing that\nhe had in mind his sister, when speaking of \"aunt Nannie,\" as\nexplained, and my sister Annie, his cousin, when he said \" cousin\nNannie,\" he is perfectly correct in his statements, but the name\n\" cousin Nannie \" is false and not gotten by telepathy, as I have no\ncousin Nannie on the \"other side,\" while I never knew that he\ncalled his sister by the name of \" aunt.\" Again, supposing that he\nhad in mind the aunt of both of us when he said \" aunt Nannie,\" and\nmy cousin, his sister, when he said \" cousin Nannie,\" he would have\nbeen right in the statement about the aunt of both of us, but\nwrong about the other, as she is still living, so that telepathy breaks\ndown with this. But if he missed getting the word \" cousin \" in my\nquestion, and had in mind his sister, as explained, when he said\n\" aunt Nannie \" his answer is correct, but the act is too much like\nreal communications with mistakes to appeal to telepathy, as she was\nmy cousin, his sister, and called \" aunt \" by him as explained. On this\ninterpretation also the statement that she was Lucy's sister is true to\nthe extent of being her sister-in-Zaw, the name of the real sister to this\n\" Lucy,\" his wife, having been given later (p. 452). If again he has\nin mind the \"Nannie\" who is aunt to us both the answer to my\nquestion, whether the word \" cousin \" is caught or not, is absurd and\nfalse, and telepathy is again lost. The consequence of all this is that\ntelepathy and the standpoint of that hypothesis only leads to hopeless\nconfusion and contradiction, and we have to choose between making\nthe case spiritistic or nothing at all. But the mere names and the\napproximation to the truth in any form of the confusion we may\nchoose to suppose prove that the passage cannot be repudiated. Hence\nthe following statement of the case will make it clear.i\nThe supposed confusion occurs wholly from assuming the stand\npoint of my mind for understanding the case. Let me, therefore,\nreconstruct it with the interpretation of my questions as they might\nhave been understood on the \" other side \" under the conditions\ndescribed, and we shall see how simple it is on the spiritistic\nhypothesis. To do this I shall have to alter my questions to suit the\nassumptions involved, which the reader will see are warranted from\nwhat I have said. I shall also throw the aunt of both of us out of\ni After attempting to understand the complicated analysis and explanation of\nthis incident, the reader will appreciate Rector's situation as well as his own if he\nwill compare the passage in the Theatetus of Plato, where the latter gives the\nstudent an example of the complications with which he has to deal in the problem of\nascertaining the truth about the nature of knowledge. Jowett's translation of Plato,\nVol. IV., p. 255. Third Edition. For the benefit of American readers I shall refer\nalso to the smaller American edition of Jowett's translation of Plato, Vol. III.,\np. 397.\n\f234 J. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\naccount, as it was a mere chance that the statement about her knowing\nthe names well was true and it is not necessary so to interpret it.\nLet me state again the dramatis personm of the reconstruction, and\navoid the false use of the terms and names from the point of view of\nmy mind. We shall then have the communicator's mother ; my father,\nthe communicator's uncle ; Lucy, the communicator's wife ; the \" aunt\nNannie,\" his sister and my cousin, as explained above ; and my sister\nAnnie, the communicator's cousin and by mistake of the \" machine \"\ncalled \" Nannie.\" 1 start with my question directed to the communi\ncator. The following will be the reconstruction :\n\" (But what relation was Lucy to you ? ) mother said it only a\nmoment ago, and she is on father's side, and he comes and speaks of\nher [Lucy] often.\n(R.H. : Yes. Rector, kindly get George to state explicitly, if\npossible, who this Lucy is. Last time I think you wrote it several\ntimes, but when I was out of the room, perhaps the time before, and\nour friend here I think did not read it at the time. )\n[Rector :] Did not hear it. All right. We will see about it as\nboth Annie and her father have brought her here several times, and\nsister Nannie will know well.\n(S. : I shall ask Nannie about it.)\n[Rector :] She is a cousin of thine, friend. Dost thou not hear ?\n(S. : Yes, I hear clearly.)\n[Rector :] But do not remember 1\n(S. : I remember one cousin Nannie [communicator's sister] and\none aunt Nannie.)\n[Rector or communicator :] Yes, she is. \" Aunt \" [sister] Nannie\nis in the body and cousin Annie is in the spirit.\n(S. : Yes, your . . . what relation is this my cousin Nannie\nto you ?)\n[Communicator : ] She is my sister.\n(R. H. : Whose sister ?)\n[Rector :] Lucy's. [In reality siaber-in-law.]\nThe last answer ought to have been \" mine,\" meaning the com\nmunicator's sister, but he evidently disappears from inability to\ncommunicate, as he had to do before and Rector answers for him with\nan attempt nearly successful, to identify this Lucy. Throwing out\nRector's slight mistake we have a perfectly intelligible story from the\nstandpoint of an assumed communicator, and absolutely nothing on\nany other supposition but what is correct enough, though confused, to\nprevent us from repudiating it. Telepathy disappears in worse con\nfusion than its supposed powers can endure for a moment, and we\nmust choose spiritism or nothing as our theory. It would not alter\nthe case to suppose that Rector when he said : \" Aunt Nannie will\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 235\nknow well,\" had added the word \" Aunt \" as interpreting my cousin's\npossible use of Nannie to mean my Aunt Nannie previously mentioned.\nIt would only increase the confusion in the mind of the trance\npersonality which is supposed to be so good at telepathy ! !\nTwo of the most interesting instances of mistake are those in the\nuse of the word \"library\" to denote the sitting-room and \"Sunday \"\nto denote Sabbath by my father. He never called the sitting-room\nhis \"library,\" according to the memory of all the family. I never\nheard it, especially as he had no special shelves even for his very\nfew books. As to Sunday, my notes and previous remarks explain\nthis (pp. 432, 67). Father was religiously scrupulous about saying\nSabbath, and it would call forth a severe rebuke upon any of us to say\nSunday, and we never did it. In fact it has been only during the last\nfew years that I have adopted the use of Sunday, in deference to the\nenvironment in which I move. But assuming intermediaries, as the\ncase represents their constant intervention and assistance, we find a\ncircumstance that is a centre shot at telepathy, besides explaining the\nsource of confusion and mistakes. The effect of these mistakes against\ntelepathy would be the same without the assumption of intermediaries,\nbecause, with the enormous powers attributed to telepathy and neces\nsary to explain at least 75 per cent, of the messages, if spiritism be\nexcluded, the absence of hesitation in the language under all conditions\nof acquisition should be followed by as accurate a selection of the\nright words in these simple instances as in any other, especially as\nImperator and Rector themselves naturally use the word \" Sabbath \" in\ntheir communications. In one of these instances (p. 432) the use of\nthe word \" Sunday \" was accompanied by hesitation before the word\nwas written, as the record shows. Now, in this very sitting we are\ntold directly that George Pelham is assisting my father (p. 435), and\nthere are several indications of the fact by G. P. himself (Cf. pp. 211\u2014\n213), and from what we know of him he would never use the word\n\" Sabbath.\" The hesitation could then be due to his failure to catch\nthe meaning of my father's message, which would most naturally\nbe expressed in the word \" Sabbath.\" There is no direct evidence\nthat G. P. was an intermediary in the other instance in which the\nword \"Sunday\" was used, but we are not always informed of\nwho the intermediaries are besides Rector. In one case, I should\nnever have known that G. P. was an intermediary in the case of\nsome communications from my brother, had it not been for G. P.'s\nown statement the next day, in which he said that he had helped a\nman by the name of Charles the last time (p. 468). But this one\ninstance of the influence of intermediaries in the message containing\n\" Sunday \" shows how the phenomenon can be explained, while the fact\nof the error which tends to disprove personal identity both displaces\n\f236 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ntelepathy and, especially in connection with the hesitation accompany\ning it, confirms spiritism. It is much the same with the use of the\nword \" library,\" which was not natural with father. It is very com\nmon to use the term for \" sitting room,\" which is the natural\nexpression for my father, and it might be that \" library \" is the natural\nterm for Rector in expressing the idea here involved, especially if it is\nthe usual form in England, as he purports to be one of the \" controls \"\nof Stainton Moses. This conception of the case is well borne out in\nthe message delivered to Dr. Hodgson about the \" coach \" when\nreferring to the rough roads and country (p. 401). \"Coach\" is a.\nword that father would never use except in reference to a certain\nvehicle in the cities, which he never visited more than half-a-dozen\ntimes in his life. The word he always used was \" carriage,\" and he\nwould laugh at himself as well as be laughed at, if he used \" coach \"\nto express what is conveyed to me by that term in the message\nmentioned. But the usage in England is very different, as I under\nstand it, and if Rector is to be treated as influenced by his connec\ntion with Stainton Moses, or personally acquainted with English\nhabits of expression, we have both an explanation of the variation\nfrom my father's usage and an index of the limitations of telepathy\n(Cf. Phinuit's expressions in England, Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 517,\n519, 520, 521). This process makes no use of the associates in my\nmemory, as has to be supposed in other cases, but acts precisely as an\nindependent intelligence would act, that is, misses in the game of\ndeception that has to be attributed to it the simplest resource for\nits consistency and defence. The spiritistic theory, however, gives\nboth unity and consistency to the whole phenomenon.\nAnother type of mistake has already been alluded to in the discus\nsion of the dramatic play of personality, but not fully examined in its\nimportance. It is illustrated almost exclusively in Dr. Hodgson's\nsittings for me, though it appears occasionally in the communications\nof my uncle and cousin when I am present, as it appears that they\nhave to seek the aid of intermediaries more generally than father.\nBut in Dr. Hodgson's sittings for me the communicator naturally\nmistakes my presence at times and addresses Dr. Hodgson as if he\nwere addressing ine personally. Of course it is not absolutely\nnecessary that we should suppose him unconscious of the situation, as\na man might address another in this way with distinct knowledge that\nhe was employing an intermediary. But the evident understanding\nat the outset until corrected that he was to communicate with me\ndirectly on this occasion, rather favours the supposition that the com\nmunicator was not perfectly clear as to the real situation, and it would\nbe natural to use the second person as he did, until he later and\nsuddenly awakened to the fact that he was speaking to Dr. Hodgson.\n\fxLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 237\nIn one remarkable passage, however (p. 387), \" Answer this for me,\nJames, when you come again,\" he combines the address to the second\nperson with the consciousness that I was not present, so that we must\nbe cautious in supposing that the confusion about me is greater than it\nmay be when using the second instead of the third person. But\n\u25a0whether conscious or unconscious, it involves precisely the mistake\nthat telepathy ought not to make. It should play its part more\nconsistently. If this power of dramatic play and simulation of\nreality were one-half what it must be in order to escape the\nspiritistic theory, there should be no such mistakes as the con\nfusion of the second and third persons in the communications.\nWe can sustain telepathy only on two suppositions in the case.\nFirst, that it knows enough to thus commit the mistake purposely in\norder to imitate more thoroughly the requirements of the spiritistic\ntheory which demand the probability of such errors. But this\ncontradicts its limitations in all mistakes in which it selects words or\nfacts against personal identity, though consistent with the influence\nof intermediary and independent intelligence. This shrewdness of\ntelepathy is not present in crucial situations testing its supposed\nqualities. Secondly, we may adduce the gratuitous hypothesis that\nthere were alterations of rapport between Dr. Hodgson in Boston and\nmyself in New York. But the facts cannot be studied with this\nconception in view without discovering some striking contradictions,\nto say nothing of its naturally preposterous and unsupported nature\nas a supposition. For instance, in the first sitting with Dr. Hodgson,\nin spite of the explanation of the situation to the communicator, he\naddresses me instead of Dr. Hodgson, though the supposition is that\nthe rapport is with Dr. Hodgson, as most of the sitting is taken up\nwith an explanation of what the communicator is to do. In the\nsecond sitting for about the first half of it he addresses me, until after\nan interval of respite he suddenly discovers, as it were, that ho is\ntalking to Dr. Hodgson, and then proceeds to speak to him of me in\nthe third person. But all this while, whether the rapport be\nconstantly in one place jor alternatively in Boston and New York, the\nfacts communicated remain from the same source, and the play of\npersonality changes to suit the spiritistic theory. Comparison of the\nsituations in the first and second sittings by Dr. Hodgson will show\nhow natural the procedure is. In the first the communicator starts with\nthe preconception that he is sending messages direct to me, but in the\nsecond, after Dr. Hodgson's explanation in the first, the communicator\ngradually becomes aware of the situation that he can command better,\nand he does not have to think merely of the messages and the person\nfor whom they are intended, but he can also hold in mind the fact that\nthey are directed to another person. It requires an extra effort of\n\f238 [part\nJ. H, Hyslop, Ph.D.\nattention to keep the complexity of the situation in view, and con\nsequently to distinguish rightly the persons involved while occupied\nwith the delivery of messages. The whole action, therefore, is that of\nan independent intelligence with all its limitations and difficulties,\ninstead of telepathic powers which never know when to play\nconsistently the r6le of the infinite.\nI shall not go over again the mistakes connected with the name of\nmy stepmother, and the confusion in the attempts to get it rightly.\nMy notes and the discussion of the dramatic play of personality illus\ntrate this fully enough, and the slightest observation ought to\nrecognise the absurdity of all this enormous effort to secure so simple a\nname by telepathy when other names far more difficult had been\nobtained so easily. This absurdity of the telepathic hypothesis in the\ninstance present is especially noticeable when we recall the fact that,\nby supposition, telepathy was able to avoid the use of the word \" aunt \"\nwhen saying \" Nannie \" for my stepmother, thus carefully enough\ndistinguishing between two persons with entirely different names and\nyet could give only one of them !\n(4) Automatisms.\nThe last type of phenomena illustrating confusion is represented\nby what I have called \" automatisms \" in my notes.l They occur\ngenerally at the close of some period of communication, or when some\ni Apropos of the possible causes of mistake and confusion, in so far as the con\nditions affecting automatism on both sides may produce them, I may refer to some\nobservations of Mr. Douse, who had the task of reading nearly a thousand answers\nof candidates at a certain University Examination. They illustrate the influence of\nnormal automatism in a variety of ways affectingerroneousspelling and abbreviations.\nMr. Douse calls them minor psychological interferences. He makes the following\nintroductory statement before classifying the phenomena observed.\u2014(Mind, N. S.,\nVol. IX. pp. 85-93).\n'' The average age of the candidates wasover nineteen years ; and except somehalf-\ndozen (who are here left out of account) they were all excellent spellers. Being set\ndown to write, under pressure and against time, compositions of their own upon given\nquestions, those young people may be considered to have been involuntary subjects of\na psychological experiment, with the advantage to the experimenter that they were\ntotally unaware of it. Their comparatively few and far between mistakes were at fiist\npassed as sporadic eccentricities ; but when mistakes of a similar character, and some\nof identical form, appeared again and again in the answers of different candidates, it\nseemed to me obvious that they must be due to a common cause or common causes ;\nand this became demonstrable as soon as I had jotted down and classified a few\nscores of them. Speaking generally, the cause of the perturbations, except as regards\none class, was found to be a momentary withdrawal of attention from the point at\nwhich the pen had arrived in the process of writing, and its transference to some\nneighbouring point in the line of ideas which the mind had evolved or was striving to\nevolve.\"\nThere were five classes of errors observed by Mr. Douse which he named and of\nwhich he gave numerous illustrations. In a footnote, he remarks that he observed\nprecisely the same mistakes in different persons and marks the illustrations according\n\fxxi.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 239\ncondition of syncope comes on, or whatever we may call the condition\nfor lack of better knowledge. They are not intended as messages to\nthe sitter by the communicator, but nevertheless they slip through by\nsome means or other. I shall choose a few instances for illustration.\nIn the sitting for December 23rd, 1898 (p. 307), there was the absurd\nand irrelevant message written out : \" I say give me my hat.\" This\nwould have been meaningless to me, had it not been for my brother's\nobservation that it was a very common expression of my father in\nsituations when he was suddenly required to meet some emergency\nand go out of doors or do some errand. We must remember that he\ncould walk only with great difficulty, and often asked for some such\nservice to save himself time and trouble. Supposing him in danger\nof a sort of hypnotic state when communicating, if anything .like\nsyncope occurred that necessitated his retiring from the \" machine,\" we\ncan well understand how the familiar phrase might unconsciously obtain\nutterance, and it occurred twice under similar circumstances. It\noccurred in the first sitting (p. 307) just before my brother Charles\nalluded to my father, who apparently could not yet communicate, and\nwas repeated under somewhat similar circumstances at the second\nto the number with the Latin words saepc (frequent) and bis (twice). The following\nsummarises instances in each class.\n(1) Prolcpsis, or \"assimilation from ahead.\" Skekel for shekel, spooped for\nstooped, prounounco (saepc), prounoun (saepc), tablenacle, \"The general ruled is\nfollowed,\" etc.\n(2) Metapedcsit, or \"overleaping.\" Possive for possessive, preced (bis) for\npreceded, combing for combining, rembrance for remembrance, voculary for\nvocabulary.\n(3) Metallage or \" cross compensation.\" Silibants (bis) for sibilants, patalals for\npalatals, phamplets (bis) for pamphlets, padoga for pagoda, etc.\n(4) Opisthomimesis or \" assimilation from the rear.\" Biship, synonyns, househould,\n\"The verb does not agree with both of the subjects, both (but) only with one,\" \" Again\nin doing a certain again (action),\" etc.\n(5) \"Contamination.\" A candidate, as often happened, would spell \"Teutonic\"\nnine times correctly, but the tenth time he would write \"Tuetonic\" through the\nunconscious influence of the very similar Tuesday ; similarly \" villian \" (villain) was\naffected by \"ruffian\"; \"goldern\" by \" leathern \" ; \"Lords Templars \" by \" Lords\nTemporal,\" and once \"The troubled Tiber chaffing with her shores.\"\nIn Mrs. Piper's automatic writing we often observe such mistakes in so far as they\nare automatisms, but I cannot classify them under the heads above enumerated in all\ncases. They also occur with the sitter in taking his notes or copying the communi\ncations. For instance, while writing this very note, in the first draft of the very next\nsentence, by \"Prolepsis\" I wrote \"collecting they (them) over a wide area,\nof experiments, they are,\" etc. But whether classifiable or not, as they may be by\ncollecting them over a wide area of experiments, they are automatisms that often\ngive rise to an apparent error in the messages. Sometimes the error is so apparent\nfrom the context that it hardly needs to be reckoned as such. I shall mention a few.\nOften Mrs. Piper's hand inscribes \" right \" for \" write,\" and vice versa, and \"too \"\nfor \"to,\" and vice versa. Once in my record Rector wrote \"Arthur\" for \"after\"\n(p. 424). The case of \"Frad\" for \"Frank\" (p. 338) illustrates another form. It\nwas written so that a part of the \" N\" was made as in \" FRAN,\" and then finished as\n\f240 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nsitting (p. 313). At the third sitting (p. 332), the strange inco-\nherency, \" Do you hear her sing ? \" occurred. Again at the fourth\nsitting (p. 336) : \"Where is my coat?\" I would treat the reference\nto his pen (p. 378) as an automatism, though a more definite and\nintelligent allusion was made to it later. But all these phenomena do\nnot show the slightest resemblance to what the general trend of our\nassumed telepathy indicates. These automatisms exhibit no conscious\neffort to indicate personal identity, as telepathy must be supposed to\ndo, if tolerable at all. They are just such wandering flights of con\nsciousness as we should expect of a mind labouring under mental\nconditions that fade now and then into delirium, and that may be\nequally affected by physiological and psychological influences acting\nin the organism of the medium. The intervals between communicators\nare often marked by traces of automatism, as if there were inter-\nmundane or other influences at work to disturb the process of\ncommunicating. Hence they are intelligible on the spiritistic, and not\non the telepathic hypothesis.\nThe automatisms representing Rector's questions to communicators,\nremarks to them, and communicators' remarks to each other, are not only\nthe letter \"D,\" and then \"FRED\" was given. The crowding of the thoughts\ntogether, as in \" Opisthomimesis \" above, might thus account for the confusion of the\ntwo canes, the curved handled one and the one with the initials carved in the end\n(p. 397). We can imagine also how \"Campaign\" might become \"camp\" (p. 371).\nf-ee also the possible confusion of \"Maggie\" for \"Nannie.\" The spelling of\n\" Hyomei\" as \"Himi \" (p. 336), while a natural phonetic error, illustrates the diffi\nculties in the case of unfamiliar words, though afterward in Dr. Hodgson's sittings\non my behalf, without any previous indication from either Dr. Hodgson or myself,\nthe word was spelled almost correctly, namely; as \"Hyomi\" (p. 391). The mistake\nof \"Charles\" for \"Carruthers\" (pp. 42*2-423), especially when wo remember that\nit was pronounced in the family as \"Crothers,\" as in \"brothers,\" is perfectly\nintelligiblo. This remark also is reinforced by the interesting fact that, after writing\nthe name correctly myself all my life, once in writing my notes on this record I spelled\nit \"Carthers \" and preserved the instance as an illustration of how the name\n\"Charles \" might be given for this uncle.\nA most interesting instance of automatic mistake also is Dr. Hodgson's writing\n\"there\" for \"here\" in my first sitting (p. 309), and repeating it in the revision.\nSimilar also to those above classified was the printer's mistake in setting up \" Miss\nHodgson\" for \"Dr. Hodgson\" after the name \"Miss S. \" in the previous sentence\n(p. 346). Another instance of the same import as the first of these two was the\naddition by Dr. Hodgson of the words \"Sounds like\" before the word \"boner\"\n(p. 327) after the expression \" Sounds like bone \" had been written once, though the\nwords '' sounds like \" had been used but once by the trance personality. This, of course,\nhad to be cut out of the detailed record as not a part of the original automatic writing.\nI may remark also an interesting automatism of my own which is very frequent.\nIn writing a word containing the letter \" e \" I often dot it foran \"i.\" This, however,\nI never do except when it is liable to be mistaken by the reader for an \" i. \" While\nwriting rapidly I fail to make the loop, and the appearance of the letter is unmistak\nably that of an \" i.\" Now, the interesting part of it is that, although I am thinking\nonly of \"e\" at the time, the motor action of the arm is adjusted to the appearance\nof the letter in the field of vision, and I discover my mistake only after it has\nbeen committed.\n\fxu.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 241\ndifferent in kind from those that come from a regular communicator, but\nthey expose more evidently than the others the weakness of telepathy\nas an explanation of the whole case. They represent the sensibility\nof the \" machine \" to perfectly intelligent conversation on the \" other\nside,\" which there is no necessity for our getting, except to dis\ncredit the hypothesis of telepathy. They are usually clear and intelli\ngible statements which we can easily understand as representing a\ndramatic play out of our sight, and are in no respect either passive\nreflections of telepathic messages or the reproduction of the sitter's\nmemories. The spiritistic character and pertinence of all this ought\nto be evident at a glance, though it could have little or no weight\nwithout prior evidence of personal identity. But when it supple\nments this evidence and does not constitute any intended part of the\nprocess involved in getting that evidence it shatters the telepathic\ntheory by attributing to it the elasticity of many very different\nprocesses.\nPerhaps the same use can be made of Mrs. Piper's deliverances\nas she emerges from the trance. But I shall not discuss them at\nlength, and the reader can study them for himself. They are\nespecially rich in confusion and automatisms. But the important\nfact about them is that they are the only instances in which any\ntraces of secondary personality in the ordinary conception of the\nterm can be found. This is a fact of very great significance, since\nit represents an abrupt break from the condition in which messages\nare easier, clearer, coherent, pertinent, and unassociated with anything\nthat we know of secondary personality, to the condition in which\nmessages are very incoherent and the indications of secondary per\nsonality are very marked. This ought not to be the case if the main\nphenomena were not preferably spiritistic, at least in the perfection\nof their representation of that hypothesis.\nK\n\f242 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nCHAPTER V.\nDifficui.ties and Objections.\nThe first thing to be said in regard to the difficulties and objections\nto the spiritistic theory is that, from the standpoint of my own sittings\nalone, there are no serious obstacles to the doctrine. If I had to judge\nthe case by my own experiments and record alone, I do not see how I\ncould avoid the conclusion that a future life is absolutely demonstrated\nby them The clue even to such difficulties as have to be discussed has\nbeen obtained from sources outside the Piper phenomena, and but for\nthem I should have nothing to suggest the cautiousness that I hav e\nmaintained. The evidence for personal identity in this record is so\noverwhelming, that when we dismiss fraud from consideration and\nreckon the mistakes and confusions in the favour of spiritism instead\nof difficulties and objections, we should not naturally suspect telepathy\nas the most probable hypothesis in the case. The spectre which that\ndoctrine raises is of the Society's own making in phenomena wholly\noutside the field I am considering here, and obtains its cogency\nfar more from our mentul habits than from the facts of this\nrecord. If the mistakes and confusions preponderated, the case\nmight not be so cogent ; at least it would not appear so to the\naverage mind, though the scientist might well suspect whether\nthat might not be the proper result to be expected, considering\nthe abnormal conditions of all sorts under which work of this kind has\nto be done. But astonishing as it must be to any one who would\na priori suppose that difficulties in communication would be insuper\nable, even on the assumption that anything like a spirit existed, the\nmistakes and confusions bear no suspicious proportion to the clear\nand significant truths, even in the communication of the most\ncomplex incidents, and consequently they not only become subordinated\nto the conclusion which is necessary to explain the pertinent matter,\nbut also serve the spiritistic view by virtue of the limitations which they\nsuggest in a hypothesis that these limitations contradict. To all who\nare not perfectly familiar with these phenomena and who ignore the\nfact that obstacles to any form of communication must he admitted,\nand this to a larger extent for spiritism than for telepathy\u2014to all these\nthe imperfections of the messages and the positive errors will appear a\ndifficult}'. But I think the true scientist, whatever his attitude\ntoward this subject, would expect error and confusion, even on the\nsupposition of existing spirits, and might expect them to an extent\n\fXLI.] Observationa of Certain Trance Phenomena. 243\nthat would exclude the possibility of any proof whatever of their\nexistence.i The assumption, of course, would be a priori and worth\nless in case experience or facts proved it false, but it is the most natural\none to make until the evidence at least modifies it.\nIt will be apparent, therefore, after what has been already said on\nthe subject of mistakes and confusions, why I treat their significance\nas the reverse of an obstacle to spiritism. Hence such suspense of\n' As an illustration of what the scientist ought most naturally to expect in\nalleged communications from discarnate spirits I may be permitted by the\nKantian idealist to quote that Corypheean authority in modern philosophy. He had\nfrankly and candidly faced the issue in problems of this sort and actually outlined the\nwhole method of psychical research a hundred years before any practical attempt was\nmade to apply it. It was the experience of Immanuel Swedenborg that prompted\nhim to do so. The letter to Fratilein von Knobloch in 17o8 shows how seriously he\nconsidered Swedenliorg's phenomena, though we should to-day discriminate between\nvarious types of them more sharply than Kant may have done. But Kant recognised\nvery clearly that any communications purporting to come from a transcendental and\ndiscarnate consciousness, if in any respect genuine, must contend with patho'ogical\nconditions, and he represented theso conditions as necessarily more abnormal than\nexperience has shown them to be. Let me quote Dr. Edward Caird's account of\nKant's doctrine, especially as there is no evidence in our list of membership that Dr.\nCaird is influenced in his statement of the problem by any preconceptions that\nour work might have produced, and yet no clearer statement of the general\nproblem could be imagined. In his \"Critical Philosophy of Kant \" (Vol. I.,\np. 150), after imagining the possibility that there is a world of spiritual\nconsciousness which may affect our moral consciousness in some way, Dr. Caird\nsays, representing the conception which Kant took: \" The only difficulty that remains\nunexplained is, how we are to reconcile the existence of such a spiritual community\nwith the fact that we are so seldom conscious of it. For the spiritual world is present\nto man, if at all, only in occas onal glimpses, which, besides, have often a somewhat\nuncertain and even irrational character. This, however, is already explained by what\nhas lx'en said of the nature of the consciousness of man as contrasted with that of\npurely spiritual beings. For what we experience as spirits will not naturally enter\ninto that consciousness which we have of ourselves as men ; or if it does so enter at\nall, it will only bo under abnormal conditions, and even then the intimations from the\nepirit world will necessarily take the form of the consciousness into which they\nintrude. Spiritual realities will l,e pictured as objects and events in the natural\nworld, and all the imperfections of the medium will affect the vision. For men in\ngeneral such perceptions will have somethingof the character of disease ; and if there\nare a few exceptional individuals who are so constituted as to be continuously con\nscious oftpiritual influences, their minds will be so much drawn out of proper balance\n;w- to the things i f this world by the confusing presence of another, that they will\noften be regarded by other men as insane. In this way it only needs a little inge-\nnu ty to explain all the facts of ghost-seeing in accordance with our primary assump\ntion as to the relations of the two worlds. ' For metaphysical hypotheses have\nwonderful pliancy, and it would show a great want of ingenuity not to be able to\nadapt thin hypothesis to every story of supernatural visitations, and that without\ntaking trouble to investigate its truth, which in many cases would be impos\nsible, and in yet more would be discourteous, to attempt.'\" (Cf. Kant's \"Traiime\neimsGeistersehers,\" pp. 33C-349, Hartenstein's edition. St e also Goerwitz' transla\ntion of the same. Preface, pp. i.-xi., and Introduction, pp. 1-33.) With such \u00bb view as\nthis before us our problem is simply one in which the evidence for personal identity must\nbe sufficient to overcome thj objections from telepathy, and mistakes and confusions\nwill stand in favour of a spiritistic hypothesis. [(.\/. Appendix VII., p. 643.]\nB 2\n\f244 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\njudgment as I have to entertain in the phenomena of this record must\ncome from outside sources.\nThe first objection which I have to meet is one that is constantly\nadvanced by scientific men, or by men who are everywhere presumed\nto be such. It is not an objection from the standpoint of the intelli\ngent psychical researcher, nor from that of this record, which deals\nexclusively with the problem of personal identity, but it is the objec\ntion of those who wholly misunderstand the nature of the primary\nquestion at issue. Nevertheless it must be stated and met. It is that\nspiritism cannot be accepted or proved until we know something about\nthe conditions of life in the transcendental world alleged as a conse\nquence of these experiments and other similar phenomena. This\ndemand is made by two classes of minds. There is first the average\nperson who is interested in theform of this life rather than the fact of\nit, not having any doubt about the fact, or any appreciation of the\nmaterialistic doctrine which makes any such life extremely doubtful.\nThen there is the scientific ( ? ) mind which follows in the wake of this\nfalse idea of the common mind, and though it is not infected with the\nsame morbid interest in either the fact of survival or the kind of life\nit promises, is nevertheless possessed of the same preconceptions of\nwhat the problem is. The objection, therefore, must be considered\nvery carefully, and it can be viewed from two wholly different concep\ntions of the term \"proof\" as bearing both upon the problem of personal\nidentity and upon that of the conditions of life in a transcendental\nexistence.\nThe first conception of \" proof \" to be noticed is that of any process\nby which certitude of conviction or knowledge is obtained in the mind\nof the person who acquires the conviction. This may be effected in\ntwo ways: (1) By the ratiocinative process, or the syllogism ; and (2)\nBy personal experience, insight, perception, or realisation in conscious\nness. Ultimately this latter process is the expression and source of\nthe \" proof \" we are considering ; for in all cases in which reasoning\ncan figure as producing personal conviction the function of immediate\napprehension is involved in the appreciation of the cogency of the\nreasoning itself. The subject of the conviction must appreciate the\nidentity of the conceptions with which the ratiocinative process deals,\nso that personal realisation in consciousness is the first and the last\ncriterion of the \" proof \" in question.\nBut for a man to demand this form of \" proof \" from me or from\nthe Society is essentially unscientific and unreasonable, because by its\nvery nature it can be obtained by no one except the man who asks it.\nHe asks us to produce a personal experience for him which involves\nkilling him to get it. He wants to be relieved of responsibility for his\nconvictions and yet insists on a criterion which necessarily implies\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain 'Trance Phenomena. 245\nthat responsibility. It is the duty of the man who makes this demand\nto do his own proving in the conception of the case defined. This form\nof \" proof \" cannot be supplied by any one except the subject, even in\npresent life, to say nothing of any supposed transcendental world.\nI shall not deny any man the right to set up so high a standard for\nthe determination of his own personal convictions, as I not only admit\nthat right, but also admit that it is not safe for most persons, without\nthe most thorough acquaintance with scientific methods, to accept any\nother standard than personal experience, though this may be exposed\nto fallibility. Our sanity depends upon putting the standard of con\nviction very high. But we must not confuse this right or duty with\nscientific method. We cannot make our personal conversion the\ncriterion of truth or the measure of what is meant by scientific\nmethod. It may be our only personal defence against illusion, but\nscience does not have to guarantee any man against the abuses of\nhis own judgment. It supplies data and asks for the best available\nhypothesis to explain them. The individual may be as rigid as he\npleases in the exaction of evidence, but he must not make his personal\nconviction any duty of mine before I have either convinced myself or\nsatisfied the demands of scientific method as it is understood in all the\nsciences.\nHence the second form of \" proof \" is precisely this method. It\nsimply collects facts under suitable conditions for the determination\nof rational hypotheses between which we have to choose. The\n\" proof \" in this case still leaves the responsibility for belief in the\nsubject of it, but it permits the data to be furnished by some one\nelse, and the issue stated so that the question is merely whether the\nfacts come under an old, or require a new hypothesis. It is simply\nInductive Method, as usually defined, and determines the degree of\nprobability in proportion to the application of the Canon of Agree\nment, or that of Difference. I shall assume that the reader is familiar\nwith this. I am concerned only in making clear that men shall not\ndemand of this or any other work in the determination of truth that\nit shall employ any other means than the facts of present experience\nto solve any of its problems. They had better remain unsolved, if we\nare to leave any and every individual to determine the standard of\nscience by his mere \" will to believe or disbelieve,\" valuable as\nthis is for security against the illusions to which we may be\nexposed in new inquiries. Still, old doctrines are not so sacred\nor so well founded by virtue of mere age or habit as always to\nescape the illusions of another type that may be as dangerous\nas any against which we try to protect ourselves. Consequently,\n\" proof \" in scientific parlance is the presentation and production of\npresent facts that enable us to calculate the probabilities of the course\n\f24G [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nof nature, whether every person is able to see them or not. But it\ndoes not impose any impossibilities. It does not require us to supplant\nthe process of individual experience, nor does it require us to make\nthe realisation in consciousness of any fact the test of all rationality.\nIt suffices if it can unify experience in terms of probabilities when it\ncan do no more.\nNow, in the application of this method to the phenomena of\nspiritualism our problem is simply to collect the facts and try\nhypotheses, no matter whither they lead. Now, when it comes to\ncollecting facts or statements purporting to represent a transcendental\nworld we must remember that there are two wholly distinct problems\ninvolved which ought not to be confused. The first is the existence\nof such a world, and the second is the conditions that characterise it.\nWhat will \"prove\" or render possible or probable the first will or may\nleave the second untouched. Taken in the special form of spiritism\nthe two problems are (1) the existence of spirits, and (2) their mode of\nlife. Unfortunately it seems that the majority of mankind, scientific\nand unscientific alike, have such a morbid interest in the latter ques\ntion that they wholly ignore both the place which it should have in\nthe truly scientific mind and the necessary insolubility of the problem\nin any such terms as they have been accustomed to represent their\nknowledge. Our chief complaint against the average spiritualist is\nthat he assumes to know and describe the conditions of a life for\nwhich we have no experience or immediate data to make it intelligible.\nIt ill becomes the scientific man to put himself on the level of the\npeople that he affects to despise. But he does so when he asserts or\nassumes that we must know the conditions of a transcendental life\nbefore we can accept it as a fact. All our intelligible knowledge is\nrepresented by some form of sensory, or at least terrestrial experience.\nWe cannot suppose any sensory phenomena in a discarnate soul with\nits loss of the very conditions of such, though, if we knew more\nthan we do, we might find other means of getting impressions. But\nthis assumption is too precarious to build an hypothesis upon it.\nWhatever the experiences of a discarnate soul, supposing it a fact,\nwe have no means in the media of our scientific knowledge to\ndetermine how we shall think them. It would require the presence\nof a spiritual body even to suggest anything analogous to our\nsensory impressions. But a surviving soul, assuming that it has any\nconsciousness of its past, could very well express or think in terms of\nits terrestrial life, and it would have to do so if there were any possi\nbility of proving this survival. Hence the problem of personal\nidentity is the first question to be settled. What claims to be a\nspirit must be made to prove its veracity by proving its personal\nidentity, and it can do this only by narrating its own terrestrial history\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 247\nin a way to break the theory of telepathy. The facts also must be\nverifiable. But when it has established its veracity, it does not follow\nthat we are to accept any statements regarding transcendental\nconditions of life as intelligible. Veracity and intelligibility are not\nconvertible. We may accept the veracity of a spirit after its identity\nhas been proved, and yet, without rejecting the truth of its statements\nabout spirit life, refuse to treat them as in any way important or\nintelligible for us. Statements about a discarnate life are, of course,\nworthless as evidence, because they are unverifiable, and even if\nveracious are in addition not necessarily intelligible. It is thus strange\nthat men pretending to be scientific express their willingness to be con\nverted to spiritism, if we shall only tell them what the conditions\nof life are in which a disembodied soul lives. They avow their\nreadiness to accept a doctrine on both unverifiable and unintelligible\nevidence. I for one refuse to do this. I have no interest in the\nconditions of such existence until I get there, unless they can be\nmade intelligible to me. I refuse to be drawn aside from the only\nrational problem of science, which is personal identity, because within\nthat field the facts, being reminiscences, may be both verifiable and\nintelligible. This limitation of the problem may make it insoluble\nin the estimation of some people. So be it ; nevertheless, I admit no\nproblem as prior to that of identity, and I consider any demand for\nunverifiable data and statements to involve a point of view worthy\nonly of those whose follies and fraud have made it all but impossible\nto discuss a hereafter with patience or respect. The man who sets up\nfor a scientist should be the last to sympathise with such a position, and\nshould know both his method and the nature of the problem sufficiently\nto escape illusions on so fundamental a question. Spiritualism ought\nnot to have a rival in the follies of the scientist who merely shelters\nhimself under the shadow of a great authority without intelligence, and\nthus converts his own standard into credulity.\nI have said nothing of suggestion as a difficulty in the case, because\nI do not consider it a factor in the results worth examination. There\nare a few isolated instances, to which I have called attention in my\nnotes and remarks as occasion required, in which suggestion is a con\nceivable explanation. But these are too few to allow them any weight\nin the whole, which the reader can easily see is unaffected by such\nsuspicions. Were any large number of specific incidents influenced\nby my questions or statements the criticism might be considered. But\nthey are two infrequent to justify the waste of time and space in their\nexamination.\nI could, however, construct an ingenious theory of suggestion out\nof certain cases by taking them in connection with later messages and\nthus indicate a source of impeachment. Thus I might say that my\n\f248 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nremark made in the letter sent to Dr. Hodgson and read to the hand\non February 22nd, 1899 (p. 400), regarding my aunt Nannie's care of\nus is the suggestion of that name and allusion to her keeping house for\nfather after my mother's death, made on June 1st, 1899 (p. 449). I\nmight also suppose that my request to finish the name begun with the\nletter \"F\" on December 27th, 1898 (p. 338), was the source of the\n\" guess \" at \" FRAD \" which I identified as Frank, but which could as\nwell be taken for a jump at Fred, which is actually given later where\nFrancis was mentioned, on May 29th, 1899 (p. 425). But when such\nsporadic instances are examined they will appear as mere quibbling in\ncomparison with the vast majority of cases that are free from all\nsuspicion in this respect. Hence I shall not waste any time discussing\nsuch ingenious speculations that are mere evasions of the pertinence\nattaching to more evidential incidents.\nThe next objection that is to be met is one that is perhaps more\ngeneral than any other. It is the triviality of the incidents com\nmunicated and the poverty of the life, or arrested development, which\nthey are supposed to indicate. The reply to this charge, however, is\nsufficiently clear, both in my refusal to recognise the assumption that\nthe facts are any indication of the condition of the soul, and in my\nremarks on the Experiments in the Identification of Personality (pp.\n537-623). We saw in these experiments that living, and presumably\nrational men choose the most trivial incidents for the purpose of\nidentification, and that we are equally bound to reflect on their sanity,\nor express repugnance to their conditions of life, when we are tempted\nto sneer at the occupations and mental status of spirits. No idea of the\npersons can be formed in those experiments from the character of their\nmessages. They naturally selected the incidents which association\nrecalled for establishing identity, and these were necessarily trivial.\nBut what has been said of the problem of psychical research, and of\nthe conditions of communication in any case ought to show that we\nhave no right to judge of the phenomena by any other standard than\nthat of personal identity, no matter what theory we have to account\nfor them. If the mental conditions necessary for communication are\npossibly abnormal, as might be most natural, though this is not\napparent in the case of Imperator and Rector, for reasons of experience\npresumably, there would be an additional reason for the triviality of\nthe messages and the confusion which the unscientific mind misjudges.\nHut whether such conditions exist or not, the only incidents that\nshould influence any man who can lay the slightest claim to a scien\ntific comprehension of the problem will be those which cannot be\nduplicated in any living consciousness, or that at least are not common\nexperiences. Tiivial facts are the only thing that will satisfy these\nconditions.\n\fXLl.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 24J)\nIt would be a far more pertinent query to ask why telepathy should\nthus limit itself to trivial incidents than to raise the question regarding\nspirits. The presumably easy access of this power to the sitter's and\nothers' memories, the supposed intelligence of the process in connection\nwith its adjunct, secondary personality, and discrimination between\nthe relevant and irrelevant matter, and the absence of all reason to\nsuppose that telepathy must duplicate the mental conditions apparent\non the \" other side \" for communicating, ought to qualify it for the\nreproduction of the important matter that we should most naturally\nexpect of normal personality. A process presumably so intelligent\nought to produce what is wanted and not to betray the limitations so-\napparent in the results.\nI must summarise several important facts that may be considered\nas a reply to the accusation of triviality in the messages. The}- are\npartly a denial and partly a justification of the triviality. I state\nthem briefly. (1) The facts are not all trivial. Many of them are\nquite worthy of the best intelligence, even when not attempting to\nestablish personal identity. (Cf. incidents of conversations on spirit\nreturn, pp. 30-34, religious remarks, pp. 401,456, and hymn incident,\np. 389.) (2) Many of the trivial incidents were in response to my\nown questions and involved the satisfaction of my own demands. The\nirrationality must be on my part. (3) Many of those that were\nspontaneously trivial follow upon an explanation to the communicator\nof what he is to do, and he is told to remind me of little things in his\nlife. (4) The probable abnormal condition of the communicator's\nmind in the act of communicating, and the difficulties of the act.\nThe last consideration is a most important one and the evidences\nthat it is a fact must be enumerated. (1) That there must be\ndifficulties in the way of communicating is an a priori necessity in the\ncase whether we choose to admit the existence of spirits or not. Any\nworld of energy transcending sense must yield a difficulty in connecting\nit with sensory experience, no matter what we conceive that world to\nbe. (2) The alternation of communicators which ought not to occur on\nthe telepathic theory. (3) The character of the communications at\nthe point of change from one communicator to another. (4) The\nconfused and fragmentary character of many of the messages. (5)\nThe absolute failure and inability of some communicators to com\nmunicate although they should be as naturally expected as those who\ndo appear. (6) The statements of the communicators themselves (Cf.\npp. 643-645, 428, 449) both in regard to their confused state of mind\nwhen communicating and their clearer consciousness when not com\nmunicating. (7) The analogies of hypnosis and secondary personality,\nin respect both of the contents of the messages and the appearance of\na disturbed memory.\n\f250 [part\nH. Hyxlop, Ph.D.\nIn reference to the matter of triviality the student will appreciate\nthe rationality of it much better if he will consult those passages and\nincidental remarks of the chief communicator which reflect his\nconscious understanding of my purpose. This only gradually dawned\nupon him and as it was explained to him, so to speak, first on the\n\" other side \" apparently, and then by Dr. Hodgson in the first of his\nsittings on my behalf. As a good illustration of the appreciation\nshown in attempting to satisfy my demands compare the answer to my\nrequest on June 6th (p. 470, Cf. also pp. 434, 460). One special state\nment is worth quoting, as it intelligently recognises in a spontaneout\nway both my object and the triviality of the fact mentioned,\nthus anticipating and answering the very objection under consideration.\nOn June 8th (p. 490) my father, referring to my stepmother, asked\nme : \" Will you ask her about the paper knife, not because I care for\nso trifling a thing, only as a test for you.\"\nIt would appear, therefore, that I entertain no objections to the\nspiritistic interpretation of the case. While this is true in regard to\nmy own sittings ; while I should be inclined to treat them as conclu\nsive, if I had not studied the subject in its wider phases and if I could\nregard the phenomena as quite as well isolated as any physical\nphenomena obtained under similar conditions of exclusion, yet I shall\nnot refuse to admit the existence of problems which require some\nsuspense of judgment regarding spiritism, strong as it may seem to be\non the surface of such facts as are here recorded. But nevertheless\nthe fact is that I have to go wholly outside of my own sittings and\nrecord for difficulties and objections of any sort, and these are of\nvarious degrees of weight, some of them being easily answered, as I\nthink, and some of them too well supported by the facts of secondary\npersonality to be dismissed without careful consideration, even if we do\nnot regard them as really applicable to the Piper case.\nNow as nry own spiritistic preferences were not determined by my\nexperiments alone and by the exclusion of other phenomena of like\nimport, on the surface at least, but were simply the \" straw that broke\nthe camel's back\" after studying Dr. Hodgson's Report, which brought\nthe issue very sharply to view and which left me without any satisfac\ntory reply to his position ; as it was the total record of the Society's\nwork, supplemented by my experiments, that disturbed my allegiance\nto materialism ; so it is the whole field of alleged spiritistic phenomena,\nand especially the whole of the Piper case as previously published, that\nI felt obliged to reckon with before being too sure of the conclusion\nwhich is so strongly supported by my own sittings. Consequently, as I\nunderstand the problem, there are two general sources of difficulty\nand objection which are both respectable and deserving of careful\n\fXIX] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 251\nconsideration. They are> first, the earlier reports on the Piper\nphenomena, and, second, the character of certain alleged spiritistic\nphenomena which suggest very large capacities for secondary person\nality, to say nothing of a large field of genuinely supernormal facts\nwhich cannot be rightly termed spiritistic for the lack of traces in them\nof evidence for personal identity.\nTaking the Phinuit regime in the Piper case we have certain\nphenomena which suggest caution in the acceptance of the spiritistic\ntheory, since they indicated the identityof living persons rather than that\nof the deceased. They are those experiments in which Phinuit would\nundertake to furnish the names and incidents in the lives of persons\nintimately connected with some old rag or trinket of whose ownership\nand history the sitter might be entirely ignorant. Phinuit also did not\nseem to care whether the person represented in the ownership of such\narticles was living or dead. (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 458, 525,\n535-6, 537 and 584 ; Vol. VIII., pp. 20-27, 101-3, 106, 109, 115,\n129, 140-1, 145, 154-5, 160-6.) There is some system in obtaining\ncommunications with your friends, and, through them, in calling up a\nrelative, since we can imagine some form of telepathic influence on a\nspirit to attract it, though this conception is tenuous enough to frighten\nus in applying our standards of belief. If we could suppose the possi\nbility of our friends being about us in a world which simply prevents\ntheir communicating with us except under unusual and abnormal con\nditions we can conceive why we establish rapport with them by going\nto a medium. This supposition, however, is the question at issue, or if\nnot the question at issue, is still as precarious as any we can imagine.\nBut when it comes to tapping any past consciousness that you please\nand about which you know nothing, simply by putting some old rag in\nthe hand of a medium, the thing becomes so incomprehensible, if not\npreposterous, at least to me, as to stagger anything but credulity. I\ndo not dispute the possibility of explaining such phenomena on the\nspiritistic hypothesis, if that is once secured, as we are too ignorant of\nthe laws of any supposed transcendental world to say what discarnate\nspirits can or cannot do, if it is once granted that they exist. But the\nproblem is not one of explanation merely. It is also one of evidence,\nand the existence of spirits must be proved before utilising them for pur\nposes of explanation, and as the phenomena so often indicate absolutely\nno traces of deceased personal identity we find them to be difficulties in\nthe way of accepting spiritism. But we do not dispose of the marvellous\nnature of the thing by refusing to recognise it as spiritistic. It is even\nas incomprehensible on any other view. It would not help matters to\ncall such performances clairvoyance with the intention of excluding\nspirits from account\u2014for that alleged process, if true, is far more\nunintelligible than the assumed agency of spirits. Spirits at least have\n\f252 [part\nJ. H. Hyslol), Ph.D.\nthis advantage, that they represent a consciousness with some known\npowers conceivably enlarged in a transcendental world, where possibly\ntelepathy, a sporadic fact with the living, might be the normal mode\nof communication and might immensely extend their resources for the\nacquisition of knowledge, especially when we look at the case from the\nidealist's doctrine of space. But clairvoyance and telepathy as ascribed\nto incarnate minds, are absolutely unknown in their mode of action,\nand are little more than names for facts which require a cause\nand which cannot be explained by any agency that science ordinarily\nrecognises. By some extraordinary hypothesis, for which there is some\nevidence, but not enough to dogmatise upon, or upon which to ask the\nsympathy of scientific minds not thoroughly acquainted with the whole\nproblem, I admit that we could give a spiritistic.- explanation to such\nphenomena as I have alluded to, and this might he done as Hartmann\nactually does it, by a sort of monistic pantheism which does not require\nus to take space into account in tapping the infinite. I have already\nsaid that I do not regard the pantheistic view as in any respect incon\nsistent with spiritism in its fundamental postulate, namely, that the\nstream of consciousness which passes for a person in this life and which\nmust be as much an emanation of the absolute now as after death, may\nstill survive and have its memory as at present. Or telepathy once\ngranted for any world whatsoever, it might also be qualified to secure the\nright person connected with the trinket in any number of supposable\nways, even on the assumption that as persons we are thoroughly indivi\nduated, as the atomic theory would require. But in the absence of any\nknowledge that spirits exist at all, the supposition of finding any one\nwe please in this easy manner is so extraordinary that we should\nnaturally ask whether the attitude of agnosticism is not safer than\nspiritism. I confess that any attempt to explain such phenomena\nwithout spiritism only makes matters worse Hence I can but recog\nnise agnosticism, which is simply the attitude of caution and insistence\non the most rigid canons of evidence, as the only rational alternative to\nspiritism, if we are to give such phenomena any importance at all.\nBut it is right here that a very significant objection can be raised\nagainst the recognition of these phenomena as indicative of anything\nin the supernormal field. The sceptic may refuse to admit that they\nare sufficient in quantity and quality to invite any other explanation\nthan chance and guessing. Some of the real or apparent successes in\nthe recorded experiments of the kind mentioned might be less sugges\ntive after these suppositions were applied to them, so that we may not\nresort to the supernormal in any shape. But this is to cut them off\ncompletely from use as objections to spiritism in the case of the Piper\nrecord where chance and guessing are pre-empted at the outset. The\nspiritistic theory in this instance will become overwhelming the\n\fxLI] Observations of Certain Travce Phenomena. 253\nmoment that we repudiate the value and significance of the coin\ncidences in the experiments under consideration as furnishing\nobjections. I am not able, however, to agree in discarding their\nvalue. Some of the incidents should have to be scrutinised with\nchance and guessing in view, and also perhaps illusions of identity on\nthe part of the person who recognised them. They were, however, not\nonly careful experiments, but contain, when taken as a whole, and\nmore especially in certain important instances, coincidences with specific\ncontents in too many cases to dismiss them as accidents. There\nare in them clear instances of supernormally acquired knowledge,\nand so must be retained either to create difficulties for spiritism\nor to indicate the existence of certain problems in it which we\nshould like to see solved before committing ourselves unreservedly to\nit. The sceptic, however, will remove the objection to spiritism\nfounded upon them, if he discredits their supernormal value. On the\nother hand, I see no hope of getting any leverage with which to\nbegin their explanation until the existence of discarnate souls is\nadmitted, though the facts indicating something supernormal are no\nevidence of the spiritistic theory. Hence it will be apparent why I\ndo not intend to treat the phenomena as in any way insuperably\nopposed to the belief in spirits. They are difficulties in the theory, not\nagainst it.\nBut there is one class of phenomena in these experiments referred\nto as suggesting difficulties that perhaps raise the strongest objection\nwhich we have to meet. They are the instances in which Phinuit\napparently, not certainly, read the minds of certain persons at a\ndistance, merely by having a trinket of some sort in Mrs. Piper's hand\nand that belonged to the person whose mind was supposedly read.\n(Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 139-159 ; see also references above, p. 126.)\nThis was done in some cases in which the medium had no knowledge\nof the owner of the article, nor did the sitter, Dr. Hodgson. There is\nno pretence of spirit communication in the contents of the messages,\nas they actually represent the present or past consciousness of living\npersons, and show no traces of any other personal identity. The facts\nrepresented largely physical actions which the person from whom they\nwere presumably obtained were performing at the time or had\nperformed shortly before. Now there is no satisfactory evidence in\nsuch phenomena of the existence of spirits. If you have once proved\ntheir existence you are justified in admitting them as the possible,\nperhaps the most probable, explanation of such facts, but the incidents\nare no evidence of that hypothesis in so far as it is affected or determined\nby the problem of personal identity, and it is this last issue that I\nmaintain must be satisfied first. Consequently, without prior proof of\nidentity we must, at least, feel charitable for telepathy, or something\n\f254 [part\nJ. H. Hyslap, Ph.D.\nlike it, and this on a vast scale. Now just in proportion as we feel\nobliged to accept telepathy in these and other coincidences transcending\ntime and spice limitations in the mind of the sitter, apparently hunting\nup some unknown person from whom to extract the information, to the\nsame extent we must admit the possibility that telepathy might account\nfor the reproduction of personal identity in the facts pertaining to\nthose who have died. This has always been the reasoning that held me\nto scepticism regarding the spirit theory, and I know that Dr. Hodgson\nwas restrained by the same fact from his conclusions for a long time.\nI suspect too that it was this circumstance which induced his effort to\nsee whether the facts made it more probable that Phinuit was a\ndiscarnate spirit than that he should be merely the secondary\npersonality of Mrs. Piper, representing her telepathic and clairvoyant\npowers. But legitimate as this may be, we cannot escape the duty to\nmake the spiritistic theory good against real or apparent objections of\nthis sort.\nBut I do not regard the difficulty here raised as at all an insuper\nable one. I think it possible to explain the phenomena on the\nspiritistic theory, if once assumed, though the evidence for it has to be\nvery different. That evidence is much stronger to-day than it was\nwhen the first two reports were published on the Piper case, and adds\nits weight to the argument for a spiritistic interpretation of the\nphenomena under consideration. But independently of this later\nevidence there are two resources for limiting the importance of the\nobjection advanced. There is first the elastic and indefinite meaning\nof the terms clairvoyance and telepathy. I have already shown that\nthey are mere names for an unknown cause. They are convenient\nweapons for scepticism, and serve a most useful purpose in keeping\nthe standard of evidence as high as possible, but they are not in\ntruth explanations of any sort. We get into the habit of assuming\na priori that they mean necessarily processes between living minds on\nthe ground that the evidence does not prove spirits, and we forget\nwholly that we are so ignorant of the real modus operandi in the case\nthat it does not occur to us that possibly the agency intermediating\nthe whole effect may be spirits. I do not advance this supposition as\nprobable, and if I thought the mere suggestion of it was calculated to\ndiminish the stringency of the canons of evidence I should be sorry\nto have mentioned it. But it is legitimate to remark the limitations\nof the appeal to telepathy, which rather creates than solves problems.\nThe second reply is based upon the possible spiritistic nature of\nPhinuit. If we shout telepathy we may well question the spirit reality\nof Phinuit, but we may in this way shut our eyes to facts which\ntelepathy cannot explain, but which spiritism may cover and with\nthem the other incidents in question. We may therefore turn the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 255\nproblem completely around and ask whether the facts on the whole do\nnot make it more probable than not that Phinuit was a discarnate\nspirit, and by this circumstance unravel the mystery about his per\nformances. This hypothesis must not be hastily made, nor the\ncanon of evidence be parted from in the attempt, but it is legitimate\nas a possible alternative to the explicable meaning of telepathy and\nclairvoyance when these are nothing more than appeals to an infinite\nof which we know nothing. Now I must say that, taking the whole\nPhinuit performances under careful scrutiny, the spiritistic theory to\naccount for him is a perfectly rational one. I do not say that it is\nproved or even the most probable one, but that it is a rational\npossibility, and especially in the light of what the Piper phenomena\nhave finally exhibited. In spite of his shortcomings and the total\nfailure to establish his personal identity, the independence of his\nintelligence, the consistency of his claim that he was a spirit and\nobtained all his information from spirits, the mention of correct French,\nnames, which Mrs. Piper could hardly have ever heard, except on the\nassumption of fraud, and more especially the mass of evidence of\nidentity of other persons than himself, and all the difficulties of\ntelepathic hypothesis which I have mentioned as inherent in it\u2014all\nthese are strongly suggestive that he was what he claimed to be, and\nthis once granted, the phenomena which seem to give difficulty become\neither explicable on the spirit theory, or a subordinate problem under\nit. To say the least, this is a possible alternative, rendered somewhat\nstrong by the array of facts just mentioned, and as long as this is the\ncase we are not forced to accept telepathy either as an explanation of\nthe phenomena or as an unequivocal objection to spiritism. Neverthe\nless, though I regard the difficulty as one that is not against spiritism,\nbut in it, I consider it an obligation to be extremely cautious in\npreferring the spiritistic theory against the possible difficulties,\nprofound or superficial, as the case may be, that may be raised by the\nprudent sceptic on the ground of achievements that are not evidence of\npersonal identity in any discarnate spirit, but that are so apparently\namenable to the extended telepathy which is here assumed to be the\nrival of spiritism. But whatever difficulties the phenomena considered\nmay have suggested in the old Phinuit rfyime, when his identity could\nnot be established, and when the identity of others was less clear than\nin the later regime, they are less serious in the present conditions of\nthe case, though we know nothing about the identity of Imperator and\nRector. The dramatic play of personality which in no case can be\nexplained by telepathy, and the prevention of interference and\nconfusion from various communicators, with greater accompanying\nclearness in the messages and their illustration of personal identity,\nare so suggestive of spiritism as to diminish the original importance\n\f256 [part\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nof the various difficulties in the Phinuit regime and to give the\nspiritistic theory the preference.\nOne of the circumstances which at least seem to favor telepathy in\nthe estimation of some people, or to suggest a suspicion in its favor, is\nthe fact that it is almost uniformly your friends who appear as the\ncommunicators in these experiments, and hence represent what is most\nlikely in the sitter's memory. Were the sitters called upon to identify\npersons of whose lives they knew nothing, and were they as successful\nin this as in those they do identify, the telepathic theory would have\nsuch an independence of the sitter's memory that it would make the\nalternative theory more plausible. But the general correlation between\nthe communicator and the memory of the sitter is a suspicious fact in\nsome minds, inasmuch as it makes the majority of the incidents on\nwhich the argument rests amenable to telepathy, at least as the safest\nprecaution against hasty conclusions. But I regard the objection as\nsufficiently refuted by two facts\u2014first, that such unknown persons have\n,often communicated incidents which satisfy the criterion of personal\nidentity, at least to the extent necessary to meet the difficulty con\nsidered (Proceeding!, Vol. XIII., pp. 37:2-383), and, second, that\nincidents are often given which are unknown to the sitter, and which\nwould have to be acquired, on the telepathic theory, in the same way\nus when the communicator is unknown to the sitter, namely, by a selec\ntion from the memory of some living person unknown to the medium\nor unknown to the sitter. But it is a very singular and inconceivable\npower to give it two such infinite capacities, one to get the right\nincident independently of the sitter's memory, and the other both the\nright person deceased and the right fact to represent his identity, both\nunknown to the sitter, to say nothing of the facts stated that evidently\nbelong to no living person at all, and have yet their probabilities without\nverification, both intrinsically and on the veracity of the communica\ntions generally. The dramatic play of personality would be against the\nmarvellous selective power of telepathy, or create a suspicion against it\nat least, even if all the facts belonged to the subliminal of the sitter.\nI am not able to admit that the fact of communications almost\nexclusively from friends specially favours telepathy. We know too\nlittle of the laws and conditions of nature and of telepathy to assume\nany such theory about this matter. There is one thing, however, that\nwe do know from experience with the Piper phenomena, and this is\nthat the task of identifying any stranger to the sitter would be an\ninfinitely more difficult one than with the known communicators when\nwe have to contend with so much scepticism in regard to those that\nwe do identify as our friends. I doubt whether I could be induced\nto prefer the spiritistic theory of any verifiable facts in the life of a\nstranger whose errors were greater than his successes in communication.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 257\nThe fragmentary nature of the messages, the capricious choice\nof incidents from the standpoint of the sitter, the probability that we\ncould not even find the persons living who could verify the incidents\nwhen given, and the possibility that there are influences that render it\nmore difficult for strangers to communicate rather make it fortunate\nfor scientific results that we do not have such data to deal with in any\nquantity, no matter what theory we adopt in the case. Now, if we\nexamine the facts in the record we shall find interesting corroboration\nof what I have said regarding the possible influences in favour of com\nmunications from friends. If the reader will study carefully the\nsittings of Dr. Hodgson held for me he will observe a most interesting\npsychological fact that tells against telepathv and indicates a possible\nexplanation of the natural selection of friends in communications. In\nthese sittings my father, who is the communicator, appears to get\ntired, so to speak, of communicating, and asks to be excused, a thing\nthat never occurred in my sittings except to rest a few minutes, as ic\nwere. In my last sitting even this did not occur. I held the attention\nby relaxing the scientific rigidity of silence, and by the demand that he\nshould tell his own story, and employed his interest and attention\nso strongly that he evidently felt no discomfort or inconvenience\nunder the \" conditions.\" Here we have the natural effect of intense\ninterest and attention to render the communication more sustained\nand clear, a perfectly natural phenomenon, and perhaps also the personal\ninterest of the communicator in the sitter as the most important\ninfluence affecting the process. But how could this interest be\nmaintained in a stranger ? We know in actual life it is far more\ndifficult to control the interest of strangers in conversation with us\nthan that of friends. This is especially true if the stranger is asked\nto do something important in a few minutes or seconds to establish his\nidentity ! Just try this once. It is hard enough to sit down and\nselect incidents rationally or irrationally with reference to secure identi\nfication, as my experiments on this matter showed, even when we have\nfriends to deal with, and a stranger has a practically impossible task\nto perform, as the necessary point de rep&re for memory and association\nto work upon is lacking in his case, and in addition the influence of\nintense interest and attention to accomplish the desired result, as is\nso well illustrated in the comparison of Dr. Hodgson's sittings with\nmine generally, and my last with the others, as well as with his.\nMoreover, a single remark also regarding telepathy will suffice to\ndismiss the distinction that we may be tempted to draw between\nfriends and strangers. If we are to assume the extension of telepathy\nin any case we have no rational reason for using the fact that friends\nare usually the communicators in favor of telepathy, because living\nstrangers to both medium and sitter ought to offer no special difficulties\ns\n\f258 [part\nJ. H. HyOop, Ph.D.\non the telepathic theory to the reproduction of memories of these\nstrangers, so that the present discrimination between friends and\nstrangers cannot be based on the greater facility of securing messages\nin one case than the other, but on the more naturally spiritistic nature\nof the phenomena. Nor will it help to say that the unwillingness to\ncommunicate with Dr. Hodgson is an indication of the fact that the\nmessages were obtained telepathicall)' from me in New York, and were\nthus more difficult and exhausting to secure, as this feature did not\nshow itself in my sittings where many messages had to be obtained\nfrom other memories, on that supposition, than my own (Cf. p. 132).\nMoreover, the communications from my cousin Robert McClellan,\nwhich could have been very numerous if drawn from my own memory,\nwere conceived from the standpoint of his own memory and attempt to\nidentify himself to his wife. Besides it would have been more difficult\nfor him even in life to remember much about me than for me to recall\nincidents in connection with him, as he was both much older than I\nam and we had too little to do with each other to fix many things\nin his recollection distinctly in relation to me. I have a great many\nrecollections of him or in relation to him that he would not associate\nwith me. The reason for this is connected with his father, my uncle\nJames McClellan, on whose place my cousin lived after his father's\ndeath. I always delighted as a boy to visit the place for its proximity\nto the railway, where I could constantly see the trains passing. I had\nseldom seen him also, for the last twenty years, and little occurred\non such occasions that could be remembered distinctly, as they were\nusually a night's social visit. Only the political speech to which\nI alluded (p. 429) was either likely to be recalled in relation to\nme or would have had any value as evidence for personal identity\nfrom my point of view, though the facts in my memory, sub\nliminal or otherwise, are numerous enough for telepathy to have\ndrawn more exhaustively upon them than it did. Hence it is signifi\ncant that, in spite of his relation to me, the communications from him\nare conceived in strict accordance with what we should naturally\nexpect in the ordinary laws of memory, and as if from a stranger\nwhose chief interest was in his more immediate relatives and recollec\ntions. Take, for instance, his reference to my brother Robert, which\nshows a solicitude in him that was natural, but which I did not know-\nwas anything special until I learned in the West that he had taken\nparticular interest in this brother for reasons that I cannot publish.\nHence I refuse to accept the assumption that communications from\nfriends are more favorable to telepathy than to spiritism. The\ncontrary may well be the case.\nThere is another difficulty which presents itself to nearly every\nstudent of these phenomena. It is the amazingly incomprehensible\n\fxLL] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 259\nconditions of existence and employment that are represented in some of\nthe communications. This difficulty does not appear in my own\nrecord, and hence were I dealing with that alone I should not have to\nconsider any such objections. There is not a trace in my sittings\nof anything indicating the conditions of existence beyond the grave.\nI have to look elsewhere in the case as a whole to encounter\ndifficulties of this sort. For instance, in one record we are told that\nthe soul has an \" astral facsimile of the material body.\" (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 301.) I have commented on this previously (p.\n225). Frequent allusions are made to breathing and functions that\nare natural only in the present existence, according to our physiological\nsuppositions ; calling for old playthings; statement that a child is just\nbeginning its letters, etc. Such things are not general, but they are\nfrequent enough to make one with ordinary sense pause and ask\nwhether they may not balance against spiritism and in favor of tele\npathy and secondary personality, and hence represent impossible facts\nas judged by the usual and natural assumptions of what consciousness\nmust be when separated from a material organism, especially when our\nthinking is dominated by Cartesian conceptions of the soul.\nI can say in reply, however, as I have said above, that there is\nnothing intrinsically impossible in the \"astral facsimile\" theory, how\never amusing, as it certainly is to me with my habits of thought.\nEven physiological science, where it has admitted a soul at all, has\noccasionally tolerated the idea that it might be of the shape of the\nbody, and this without reference to the veridical character of appari\ntions. But there is also a way to reconcile both the Cartesian and\nthe physiological conceptions. We may suppose that the \"astral\nfacsimile \" is an etherial body and the soul may still be a point of force\ninhabiting the etherial body, as consciousness now inhabits the mate\nrial organism. This is the way that the communications most natur\nally represent it, or require us to conceive it. Dr. Hodgson has stated\nthis matter very clearly in his report (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p.\n400). Of course I do not urge this view of it as true or proved, but as\nso possible from the limits of our knowledge regarding any transcen\ndental world beyond sense perception (instance X-rays), that it cannot\nbe treated as an objection, but only as a problem within the spiritistic\ntheory.\nBut it is not so easy to remove our natural repugnance to the other\nallegations or implications about the conditions of existence in another\nlife Living in houses, listening to lectures, are rather funny repro\nductions of a material existence, and still funnier for beings that ought to\nbe nothing more than points of force according to Descartes and\nBoscovich ! In some instances the statements may be treated as auto\nmatisms and hence as not indicating transcendental conditions of life at\n8 2\n\f260 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nall, as in the case of a communicator calling for his hat (p. 307), or as\ndistorted messages owing to the influence of the \" machine \" and its\norganic habits upon the form of the communication. Allusions to\nbreathing and similar functions may also be treated as automatisms, or\nas the nearest description that a spirit could give of the state of con\nsciousness which accompanies the difficulties of communicating. From\nwhat I have already said about the conditions of such an existence\nit is apparent that I do not consider myself bound to interpret them in\nthe terms of our most natural understanding, but as the best attempts\npossible to express new experiences in terms intelligible to us. That is\nthe communicator must put new wine into old bottles. Interesting\nevidence of this is the language used in describing the process of com\nmunicating. It is sometimes called \"speaking,\" and sometimes\n\" thinking,\" as if recognising in the latter case that it was telepathic in\nnature, that is, telepathy between the disearnate spirit and Mrs. Piper's\nsubliminal. Imagine a person who never had the sense of touch and\nonly the sense of sight communicating with another who never had the\nsense of sight but only that of touch, and we have some analogy with the\nsituation lietween incarnate and discarnate consciousness, the difference\nbeing that in the case of supposed spirits there is a memory connection\nwith the terrestrial world which makes torn\/; communications intelligible.\nIndependently of this, however, the communications would be either\nimpossible or worthless for establishing personal identity. The only\ncommon aspect of consciousness without this memory connection would\nbe the emotional characteristic, and that is an impossible basis for\nestablishing any intelligible idea of the real conditions that the\nlanguage appears to describe. On this ground and analogy, therefore,\nI refuse to interpret all such statements in terms of our ordinary\nexpeiience where they are so closely associated with sensor}' ideas. We\nmay leave them as unknown quantities. Even if we could not suggest\na method of explaining them away, they are not frequent enough to\nrequire a positive explanation in the absence of data to interpret\nthem, while the predominant evidence which falls into line with our\nconception of personal identity, sufficiently allows us to draw a\nconclusion regarding the possibility of survival, and we suspend judg\nment on the unverified and unverifiable allegations which do not\ncontradict the evidence, but which merely offend our a priori\nassumptions.\nBut there is a reply to the objection under consideration that is\nstill more effective, and that brings the statements that offend us so\nmuch into the range of our intelligence without admitting sensory con\nceptions into the account. I shall appeal to the whole philosophy of\nidealism in support of the possibility that I shall present. If that\nsystem has any foundation at all, its position assigns so much even in\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 261\nmaterial existence to the action of consciousness that it ousrht to be\neasily adjusted to the spiritistic theory. Ever since Kant the watch\nword of that philosophy has been that we make our world. Such\nstatements offend common sense as much as these puzzling allegations\nfrom a trancendental world annoy the common man and the\nphilosopher alike. But however much we may dissent from it and\nhowever much the language is calculated to create misunderstanding in\nterms of empirical and sensory experience, it nevertheless contains the\nimportant truth (1) that sensations are not representive of the world\nthat elicits them; (2) that all the disconnected elements of experience in\ntime and space are organised into the unity of scientific and other\nknowledge by the subject's own action ; and (3) that the spontaneous\nidealisation or creation of many objects of consciousness, not given in\nexperience at all, represents some constructive and non-sensory menta\ntion even in a material existence. Of course in our present conditions\nwe are always brought up to face the non-ego when the problem of\nadjustment to an external world is involved. The nature of the\ncase makes it constantly imperative to take our n-o'u o-rS, in the\nobjective world and not to disregard it, either in thought or action.\nWe can disregard it, however, in our dreams, and in those moods and\noccupations which employ us with the construction of our ideals. Now\nimagine the material world removed from its relation to consciousness\nand to the needs of life, and we have a condition in which Kant's\ndictum about the spontaneous action of the understanding would\nrepresent that function as having free play. Suppose then the\ntwo following conditions fulfilled in a transcendental world and then\ninterpret the statements which give difficulty in their light to see how\nthe matter may stand. (1) Imagine a rationalised dream life, or life\nof spontaneous idealisation and creation of ideas (poetry is this), and\n(2) their communication by persons to each other through telepathy,\nand we shall have a representation, in two actual facts of our know\nledge, of what is possible in the transcendental world. We carry on\nsuch acts of the understanding under limitations even now, and we\nhave also proved telepathy as an occasional phenomenon in a material\nexistence, though not employing any material conditions within our\nknowledge for its effectuation. Taking then these two suppositions\nwhich represent known laws of mental action and adding to them that\nof personal identity on the evidence of such records as this,\nand we have, as strictly within the lines of scientific method,\nthe rationality of the spiritistic theory. In addition we remove\nabsolutely all the offensiveness of statements about occupations and\nactions in a transcendental world, as they have to be expressed to us in\nour language adapted to sensory experience and not qualified to suggest\nthe real difference between the pure products of the understanding,\n\f262 [part\nJ. H. Hyslnp, Ph.D.\neven though they are based upon antecedent experience, and the\nmaterial objects which are usually denoted for us in our ordinary\nintercourse, where we cannot lose sight of the external world on any\ntheory. I shall not develop this thought at length, but leave it to the\nreader, as my object is accomplished when I have shown the way\neven to make the apparently preposterous statements of discarnate\nspirits intelligible to terrestrial reason. Rightly applied, this\nhypothesis will give unity to more of the data of psychical research\nthan appears at a glance. I shall not maintain that my hypothesis\nis true or proved, as I am as far from entertaining it as more than a\npossibility. It contradicts no known human experience or theory, but\nrather falls into line with much of our philosophy and common\nexperience divested of its association with sense, and consequently\nought to represent a fair reproduction of a spiritual world for any of\nthose who have been willing to believe and describe it without\nevidence. To those who will not accept such a world without evidence,\nand I class myself among this latter number, the hypothesis violates\nno known fact of human experience, but rather depends upon it and\nonly adds to it the conclusion that follows from the evidence of\npersonal identity. In this it satisfies the canons of scientific method,\nas telepathy cannot do.\nWe may also ask, as a further objection, who Imperator and\nRector are. Here we have two alleged spirits whose identity is\nabsolutely concealed from us and apparently with \" malice prepense.\"\nPhinuit attempted to tell us who he was and failed to identify himself.\nImperator and Rector do not even try as yet to satisfy our curiosity\non this point. Now are we not obliged to determine whether they are\nspirits or not before accepting the verdieally spiritual character of the\npersonalities that seem to be verifiable 1 May we not, in the absence\nof evidence for their identity, assume that they are secondary\npersonalities of Mrs. Piper's organism and representative of super\nnormal conditions which qualify her for telepathic acquisition of the\ndata that simulate the personal identity of others 1\nNow it should be said in regard to this objection that it can be\nmade from two points of view. The first will be from a thorough study\nof their performances, and the second that of secondary personality in\nothers and without any knowledge of the Piper phenomena. This\nsecond point of view does not need any notice, as it is not worth any\nthing until the man who is tempted with it acquaints himself with the\ncase at hand. The first is more important. But if any man delibe\nrately adopts that view as assured after studying the case at first\nhand, I do not see that I can dislodge him. As for myself I cannot\nstudy the dramatic play of personality, to say nothing of its complication\n\fxu.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 263\nwith telepathy, without appreciating the naturalness and the rational\nstrength of the spiritistic theory more than I can the emphasis\nof analogies which are too general to affect anything except the\nsuperficial features of an argument. In addition to the wonderful\ndramatic play of personality that I have so elaborately discussed,\njust think of the memory that must be involved in conducting the\nright adjustment and connections of incidents, ideas, and advice\nnecessary to give the psychological complexity and the unity of the\nphenomena that so successfully represent spirit existence, while\nhundreds of sitters follow each other from day to day in miscellaneous\nconfusion.(If any man wishes to combine such a number of \"miracles \"\nin one act or brain, namely, such elastic range of secondary personality\nas appears in these trance intermediaries and others like G. P. and\nPhinuit, all with character as distinct as we ever knew it in life and\ncapable of playing a real part wholly unlike secondary personality as\nwe know it ordinarily, and then add to this an omniscient telepathy\u2014\nif any man does this, I can only say that I do not follow him into the\na priori construction of such an hypothesis. ' He must give a detailed\nanalysis of cases that are similar and yet that do not have any\nspiritistic content. This may be possible, but I suspend judgment\nuntil it is effected. The supposition appears strong as any appeal to\nthe infinite must appear strong for the lack of any assignable limits to\nsuch powers. But these are not the customary modes of scientific\nexplanation, which has a preference for the finite.\nI may add, however, in further reply to this objection that, as I\nconceive the problem, I am not required to begin any theory with an\nexplanation of who Imperator or Rector are. That problem I have\nalready defined as, first, that of personal identity, but this does not\nobligate my proving the identity of everybody that comes along. If\nImperator and Rector volunteered any evidence of their identity, it\nwould be my duty to examine and weigh it. But unless they do\nvolunteer it I am entitled, nay, bound to suspend judgment on that\npoint, and be content with the supposition of secondary personality.\nIt is even possible that it is exceedingly wise on their part, if they are\nactually discarnate spirits, not to make any claims as to who they are.\nMy sittings show that it is a very precarious business to identify\nanybody that has been dead twenty-five or fifty years. Compare the\ncase of John McClellan (p. Ill), and Note 94 (p. 535). The memories\nof even one's children may not suffice to satisfy the maw of science if\na parent or relative has passed long before. (Cf. Footnote p. 111.) If\nImperator and Rector should happen to belong to a past generation, the\nconcealment of their identity would not only be a wise procedure until\nthe identity of some one else was established, but it might also entitle\nthem to the credit of fully realising the scientific problem that presents\n\f2G4 [PART\nJ. H. Hytshy, Ph.D.\nitself to us. I have no positive re&son to suppose that this possibility\nof their existence in some past generation is true, or even plausible.\nHut there is nothing opposed to it in the nature of the case.\nNevertheless I concede that as long as their identity is not\ngiven we must either assume that they are secondary personalities\nof Mrs. Piper or conduct the argument for the identity of others\non a scale commensurate with the gravity of the problem. If the\nevidence for the identity of alleged communicators, beside Im-\nperator and Rector, becomes so overwhelming as it appears generally\nin cases which we are capable of verifying, and if it transcends all\nnormal expectations of the human brain and routs the theory of\ntelepathy, so that spiritism is the preferable hypothesis, we may\naccept the facts as giving the retroactive light to suppose that\nImpenitor and Rector are what they claim to be. But this does not\ncommit us to their personal identity in any case, even if they should\nreveal it. They might he utterly unable to satisfy the criterion of\nscientific method in attempting the task, though any statement on\ntheir part would put the burden of rejecting the case upon us. We\nmight believe them if desired, but we are not obliged to do so. I\nshould have the right certainly to exact of them sufficient verifiable\nevidence for their identity before accepting their statements, whether\nthat evidence he facts in their lives on earth or their performances and\ncharacter as \" Controls \" in these experiments inducing confidence in\ntheir veracity. Hence I am willing, or may even think it necessary,\nto suspend judgment on this point altogether, even after accepting the\nfact that they are possibly or probably spirits on the ground of the\nevidence that presumably enforces the spiritistic theory in regard to\ncommunicators who can and do give verifiable facts. But we can\nnever forget that Imperator and Rector as personalities follow George\nPelham in the history of the Piper case as a personality, He it was\nthat could at once do something to establish his identity and control\ncommunications. They do not ap]iear as entire mysteries in the wake\nof Phinuit, but are preceded by a verifiable personality who was\ninstrumental in producing them, and who actually counsels Dr.\nHodgson to accept their directions in the management of the ex\nperiments. This fact with the whole testimony of their work is\na powerful argument for their reality. But I shall not assume it in\nthis discussion, and feel less obliged to do so for the reason that it\ndoes not make any difference where the proMem of personal identity\nbegins. We have in any case to face the fact of secondary personality\nand we may assume as many as we please of them as intermediaries, if\nonly the evidence unmistakably shows such limitations in the powers\nof these personalities as will not consist with anything except the\nspirit hypothesis.\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 265\nI should also treat their various statements about transcendental\nconditions and their professions of superior knowledge in the same\nway. These are their individual opinions and must be subject to the\nsame rules of evidence that regulate the acceptance of any opinions.\nComplete liberty of judgment must be accorded us on this point to\napply as rigid criteria as scientific method may demand, even when we\nconceive their opinions as either possible or probable. Their statements\nare not to be supposed false because we refuse to accept them as true on\nauthority. They may be the personal opinions of the subjects who state\nthem and cannot be put on the same plane as the verifiable facts of a\nterrestrial world. They may even be facts instead of opinions, but\nnot being verifiable by us beyond the range of such incidents as are\nrepresented in their achievements in terrestrial conditions (diagnosis\nof disease, supernormal perception of character, etc.), we are entitled\nto distinguish between what are opinions and what we know to be\nfacts verifiable independently of their testimony. This fact relieves us\nfrom all scientific use of data in the record which do not first prove\nidentity, whatever we choose to regard as possible or probable in the\npersonality of these intermediaries. If they could or did furnish\nsatisfactory evidence of their identity, the case against secondary\npersonality and its combination with telepathy would be that much\nstronger. That is freely admitted. But this does not affect the\nquestion regarding the proper scientific attitude toward communica\ntions that represent alleged facts in a transcendental world which\ncannot be verified, or that may be mere theories of a discarnate being\nwhose range of knowledge, even though it be much greater than ours,\nis subject to the same general limitations, so far as my acceptance is\nconcerned, as characterise all opinions of another intelligence. I do not\ncontradict them where thev do not contravene human experience, but\nneither do I feel bound to accept them, nor to class them with the\nverifiable facts which may serve as evidence for the supernormal or for\nthe existence of a transcendental world But the reservations on this\npoint and on their identity may well impose upon us the duty to\nrequire more evidence for survival of terrestrial consciousness than\nwould be the case if we could unhesitatingly accept the independent\nintelligence and teachings of these trance personalties, as this latter\nwould presuppose that we had eliminated the question of secondary\npersonality, at least in its most perplexing form.\nBut the problem of their independent personality is a very different\none from the acceptability of their opinions or their personal identity.\nTheir independent personality is prior to all questions, except the\nidentity of those for whom the evidence is scientifically sufficient.\nHence I refuse to consider their identity as any prior condition of the\nspiritistic theory. Their independent personality comes first, and even\n\f266 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthis is subordinate to that of communicators who can make out a case\nfor identity. Consequently the independent personality of these\n\" controls \" must be measured by the quantity and quality of the\nevidence that suggests preternatural intelligence. The real point de\nrepere, so to speak, of the scientific theory must be the capacities of the\nhuman brain, the normal knowledge of Mrs. Piper, and the limits of\nsecondary personality as already known. That is to say, have\nphysiology and psychology any theories that will explain the\nphenomena without a resort to spirits 1 If the communications of\nothers than these intermediaries bore no traces of personal identity,\nwe should be obliged, of course, to stop with the hypothesis of secon\ndary personality as sufficient to cover the whole case, no matter how\nwe had to stretch it, unless we were audacious enough to consider the\nexistence of transterrestrial intelligence as involved and not implying\nthe continuance of terrestrial consciousness after death. But this would\nbe an extremely dubious supposition, to say the least of it, considering\nthe language employed and the exact adjustment to our conditions of\nthought. I do not even need to state how little tolerance any intelli\ngent man should have for such a view. But the mass of evidence for\npersonal identity in certain cases is a presumption for the independent\npersonality of the trance intermediaries, and this latter then becomes\nwholly subject to the evidence with which we have to measure the\ncapacities of the medium. The proper order for our problems is,\ntherefore, the personal identity of any communicator whose incidents\nare terrestrially verifiable, the independent personality of the trance\nintermediaries, their personal identity, and the acceptability of their\nteachings. The solution of the first of these problems is offered in\nthe facts of this record, and does not come under notice at present.\nThe second question may be suspended as long as we like, inasmuch as\nwe have in any case to reckon with the fact of secondary personality,\nand may assume this for the trance personalities, without setting aside\nthe evidence for the identity of others, though the assumption requires\nus to be more exacting in the quantity and quality of the evidence\nthan would otherwise be the case.\nBut there is much in the Piper phenomena to suggest the indepen\ndent personality of these intermediaries. This ought to be evident to\nall who study carefully the dramatic play of personality of which I have\nmade much in the evidence for the spiritistic view. There is also the\nwonderful intellectual and moral cleavage between Phinuit and the\npresent \"controls,\" Imperator and Rector; between these and G. P.\nand also between Phinuit and G. P., to say nothing of the same\ncleavage between all other communicators. The personalities are so\nnumerous, so distinct, and so diversified in all the details of their\nmake-up that, supposing them to be secondary personalities of the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 267\nmedium, approaches the attribution of infinity to her. If the\n\" controls \" had never been more than one type of personality the case\nwould be very different. We should feel more keenly the difficulties\nproposed by it. But there have been so many trance personalities\ninvolved in the \" control \" of the medium (Phinuit, George Pelham,\nImperator, Rector, Doctor and Prudens) to say nothing of temporary\n\" controls \" (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 28-50 ; Vol. XIII., 295-335,\n370-389 ; more especially pp. 300, 303-4, 316, 358), and all with that\ncleavage which consists with, or exhibits, such independence of each\nother as would be true of separate persons, so that the hypothesis of\nsecondary personality simply atljibutes to Mrs. Piper's brain construc\ntive and synthetic powers which are more easily conceivable on the\nspiritistic theory than on any other. If Mrs. Piper's subliminal is the\nAbsolute let us say so. But, as Dr. Hodgson well remarks, we may\nas well call this another world and make it intelligible, as it is not\nintelligible in terms designedly used to deny a transcendental exist\nence, but which on examination perform the Hegelian process of\neither becoming altogether meaningless or identifying a conception\nwith its own opposite which it was intended to contradict. All this\nis worked out with a completeness by Dr. Hodgson that I need not\nrepeat, but shall only refer the reader to his discussion (Proceeding.*,\nVol. XIII., pp. 370-406). I may state, however, that I did not see\nclearly the meaning of his statements until my own facts induced\nthe same conclusion independently of his language. All this, too,\ncan be said while keeping in mind such cases as that of Dr. Morton\nPrince (Proceedings, Vol. XV., pp. 466-483), and that of M. Flournoy\n(From India to the Planet Mars).\nIt will be apparent, therefore, why I refuse to treat our ignorance\nabout these trance personalities as anything like forcible objections or\nserious difficulties in the way of the spiritistic theory. They may\nindicate a problem which it is desirable to solve. But this does not\nsubordinate the question of personal identity in the case of verifiable\nfacts to either the independent personality or the personal identity of\nthese \"controls,\" whom we might find it difficult or impossible to\ninvestigate. Hence the only view which I feel called upon to favour\nis that the spiritistic theory is well supported in the case of the persons\nrepresented as communicators to me. All other questions are held in\nabeyance as involving a possible, if not a proved spiritistic interpreta\ntion, especially as they are consistent with it and possess some\nindependent probabilities.\nIt may interest the reader to know at this point how little evidence\nmay be necessary to establish identity with sufficient certitude and\nthat this evidence may not be as specific as we have been accustomed\nto demand in our reports of the Piper case. I do not mean by this to\n\f2GS [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nrelax our vigilance in the matter of proof, but to indicate that when\nidentity is established we have only to consider how far telepathy can\naccount for the complexity of the phenomena. My experiments on the\nIdentification of Personality show that identity may often become-\nassured, and with good reason, upon evidence that was extremely\nindefinite and apparently unfit for the purpose, as judged by the\nstandards we have usually adopted in this study. I was much\nsurprised by the fact. The reader may compare the following refer\nences : Questions 2 and 9, pp. 563-4 ; 9, p. 570 ; 9, p. 577; 3 and 7, pp.\n586-7; 11 and 16, pp. 587-8; 2, p. 583; 1, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16,\nand 17, pp. C09-613, and especially Qttention 7, p. 619.\nI come now to an objection whi?h must necessarily carry more\nweight than any that I have considered, at least to those who are\neither devoid of resources for the justification of further scepticism or\ndefective in the appreciation of the character and consequences\nof hypotheses that are absolutely without any scientific support\nindependently of the Piper phenomena themselves. The objection\nwas practically stated in the difficulty just dismissed, and con\nsidered somewhat in the discussion of the telepathic theory\n(Cf. p. 152). It is the supposition combining the functions of\ntelepathy and secondary personality to explain the case, the one to\ngive the significant data and the other the play of independent\npersonality. That is to say, we may suppose that we have the\nfortuitous combination of capacities which usually or always have\nbeen separated in other abnormal cases. I think that any reader of the\nfacts will admit that the whole case cannot be adequately explained\nby what we understand by telepathy alone in either its spontaneous or\nits experimental aspects, no matter what extension we choose to give\nit. The dramatic play of personality is not like anything that we know\nof in telepathy. Telepathy may involve a subliminal process like that\nof secondary personality, but as it is known in its experimental and\nspontaneous forms it does not exhibit the intelligent selectiveness and\nteleological unity that are so characteristic of the Piper phenomena.\n]n its acquisition of data it resembles more nearlv a mechanical\nprocess, or the automatism of abnormal association. For that reason\nwe cannot assume that secondary personality in such a dramatic form\nas this record shows is a necessary part of the conditions connected with\nsupernormal knowledge. On the other hand, from all that we know of\nsecondary personality where it does not assume the spiritistic form at\nall, and even where it evidently tries to simulate it, though it displays\nthe imitation of another personality than that of the subject, it never\nreproduces the life and experience of other subjects than the one\ndelivering them, whether living or dead and absolutely unknown to\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 269\nthis subject. Hence it is equally apparent that secondary personality\nalone cannot account for the phenomena. But may we not combine\nthese suppositions in this fortunate instance so that the function of\none process may supplement the defects of the other 1\nThe objection which this combination embodies, however, as it\n1s stated here, is a purely a priori one, and I accept it merely\nas a concession to the precautions which the student may wish to\n.entertain who is familiar with the phenomena of secondary per\nsonality elsewhere and often claimed to be spiritistic, but who has\nnot minutely acquainted himself with the case before us. But I cannot\n-allow the objection to have any scientific weight whatever unless he\nsupport the appeal to secondary personality by remarking features in\nthis instance that justify comparison with other cases admitted to be\nneither spiritistic nor telepathic. That is to say, we must show that\nthis dramatic play of personality is a sufficiently general quality of the\nsecondary consciousness to invoke suspicion in this instance. We\n,cannot permit the objection to remain in abstracto. It must produce\n\u25a0evidence, and empirical evidence at that, for the one crucial point that\nwill justify comparison.\nThe first analogy that would suggest itself to the critic in the\nattempt to supply this empirical evidence would be multiplex\npersonality. We know that this is a fact, and that it often betrays\nno sign of spiritistic phenomena. The experiments of Pierre Janet\n(U'Antomatisme Psyehologique and Ne'vro$es et IdJes Fixes), Dr. Morton\nPrince (Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 79-98), and others ad nauseam,\nshow that the same brain may assume different personalities where the\ncleavage is wonderfullv marked and suggestive. Hypnosis can produce\nit in dual form almost at pleasure, and might develop it further if tried.\nBut I shall not illustrate it in detail, as I have done enough to\nindicate that I recognise it. But I reject at the outset any legitimate\ncomparison between multiplex personality in hypnotism and that which\nwe find in the Piper case, though I concede very frankly and fully the\nright of any one who has not studied these phenomena, but who has\nseen something of the spiritistic claims that have no better foundation\nthan secondary consciousness, to defend himself against illusion by\nthe supposition which I nevertheless reject. The resemblance is wholly\nsuperficial and rather in name than in reality. The term \"multiplex\npersonality \" seems to cover both cases, but it does not correctlv\ndescribe the same facts in each case. The multiplex personality of\nboth auto and hetero-hypnosis does not exhibit any dramatic play. It\nmay imitate another person under suggestion, or reproduce another\napparent personality than the normal, but it does not imitate\nconscious intercourse between these dual or several streams of mental\naction teleologically adjusted to a common end. This last is the\n\f270 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ndramatic play which I have discussed. \/ must insist upon tfie\nradical distinction between either the imitation under suggestion of\nanother personality than the subject, or the production, spontaneous\/;\/\nor under suggestion, of a secondary consciousness drawing without\nknowledge or recognition upon the experience, habit, language, etc., of\nthe normal stream, and that dramatic interplay ofdifferent personalities\nin the same subject that reproduces the intercourse of real persons with\neach other. This latter is what I have meant by the dramatic play of\npersonality and it is very different from dramatic imitation of it in\nany case. Psychologically the two are different, and this is true even\non the assumption that they are both forms of secondary personality.\nThe point is not to prove that the proper dramatic interplay of\npersonality is spiritistic, but that it is different from the dramatic\npersonality of suggestion, and that it is just what we should expect\non the spiritistic hypothesis. The change from one personality\nto another in the phenomena of secondary consciousness may be\nas sudden as you please, but it is neither one of those ad libitum\nprocesses which always imitates the existence of real persons, nor\na process which adjusts itself to a representatively complex and\nexternal situation which makes the acts teleologically intelligible\nin terms of a possible real existence, as in what I have described\nin the Piper case. It shows no trace of such complex and accurate\nadjustment. If it exhibits anything like adjustment at all, it is\neither absurd adjustment to a wholly imaginary world created by\nsuggestion,, or it remains passive and inert until some form of foreign\nsuggestion, or. inner caprice, alters its direction and mnemonic unity.\nNor does it help the argument any to produce the alterations of hetero-\nsuggestion. These are the purely passive reflexes of the hypnotic\noperator, and show neither such spontaneity as we observe in the\ntrance personalities of Mrs. Piper, with their intelligent and rationally\nteleological action, nor the representation of a consistent and intel\nligible situation outside the range of our knowledge. Hence I repudiate\nall but the most superficial comparison and resemblance between\nmultiplex personality in hypnosis and the trance personalities under\nconsideration, and I think every careful student of the case will agree\nwith this view. The one point which it is necessary to find in the\ncase in order to justify suspicion, namely, the dramatic interplay\nbetween different personalities in the same object, and adjustment to\nvarying conditions simulating a transcendental reality, is not discover\nable in the multiplex personality of hypnosis in so far as it has been\nstudied.\nBut there is a more important objection to this comparison of the\ntrance personalities of -Mrs. Piper with the multiplex personality of\nhypnosis. The latter nearly always, if not absolutely always, shows a\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 271\npoint of connection and unity between two or more streams of\nconsciousness which indicate an identity of subject in spite of the\napparent plurality of subjects. The cleavage is purely a mnemonic\ndefect, and is due to a suspension of the recognitive process. The\nfacts belong to the same ego or subject without the recognition that\nthey occurred in the stream of consciousness which as a whole seems\nlost. The amnesia is all but perfect, and may even be perfect in so far\nas definite recognitive processes are concerned. The retention and\nreproduction remain with an organising process that is minus the act\nof either localisation or recognition within the normal stream. This is\nvery common in our dreams. I recorded one instance of a similar\nphenomenon in the waking state of Mrs. D. (Proceedings, Vol. XII.,\npp. 262-3), Miss X. records in her papers quite a number of experi\nences in which a message comes unrecognised from the subliminal into\nthe supraliminal, and the phenomenon is a familiar one to a psychical\nresearcher (Proceedings, Vol. XI., pp. 1 14-144). Take also the case\nof the hypnotised artist who was told that he was a certain physician\nand in his imaginary practice of medicine prescribed that his patient\nshould go and paint pictures (Boris Sidis : Psychology of Suggestion,\np. 257) ; also the case of Dr. Dana, in which the amnesic subject\nwished the lady to whom he was engaged to remain with him, though\nhe had completely forgotten her name and his own with his whole\nlife, and did not even know the meaning of the very word marriage\n(Psychological Review. Vol. I., pp. 570-580; especially p. 572;.\nThe hest case is that of Ansel Bourne in our own records, where there\nwere several connections between the auto-hypnotic and the normal\nstream (Proceedings, Vol. VII., pp. 221-257.) There is also a most\ninteresting case in the experiments of Pierre Janet discussed by\nMr. Myers (Proceedings, Vol. V., pp. 376-8). My own case also illus\ntrates the phenomenon on a smaller scale. The hypnotic subject could\nnot recall his own name or age, but recalled the names of his com\npanions in both his normal and abnormal state very easily and of his\nnormal life only a few incidents (p. 641). But not to continue\ncases in which the cleavage is almost perfect, the whole phenomenon\nof post-hypnotic suggestion illustrates this connection in the same\nsubject, and it is too familiar to psychiatrists to require further\nmention. This interconnection between \" the two or more selves \" is\ngenerally admitted, and it is only the failure to recognise the con\nnection that gives the appearance of a total cleavage and of a dual\ni subject (Cf Boris Sidis : Psychology of Suggestion, pp. 162-179, and\nPierre Janet: L'Automatisme Psychologique pp. 73-91)\nNow this unity is not a characteristic of the \" multiplex per\nsonality \" of the Piper case. The only interconnection (with the\nexception of facts to be noted presently) that is observable in it is a\n\f272 [part\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nfacsimile of the interconnection between two minds self-consciously\nexchanging ideas. Rector does not appropriate the facts that\nbelong to G. P., unless some natural hint of their foreign source\nis given, as we attribute the like to others in actual life. Phinuit\nand G. P. refer to each other as independent realities, and appropriate\nnothing from one another which does not resemble the conscious\nintercourse between two beings. No unconscious interconnection, as\nin the ordinary cases of hypnosis and secondary personality, seems ever\nto show itself. It has been uniformly the same throughout the history\nof the Piper phenomena (Cf. my brother and my sister communicating\nfor others, pp. 100-108).\nThe only facts that seem to supply the necessary desiderata for\nsuch a comparison are those cases of secondary consciousness in which\none of the personalities actually recognises another and distinguishes\nbetween the two as if they were really different persons (Cf. Pierre\nJanet L'Automatisme Psychologique, pp. 67-125, and 271-354; Pro\nceedings, Vol. V., pp. 393-395, and Vol. XIV., pp. 366-372;\nVol. XV., pp. 466-483). There is something like dramatic play\nin these instances ; at least in respect to the apparent independence of\nthe personalities and their recognition one of another as if real and\nnot of the same subject. Nevertheless, we often find even in these the\nappropriation of another's memories, experiences and personal traits\nin a way that suggests the ordinary interconnection between apparently\nseparate streams of consciousness, as characterises the general type of\nmultiplex personality. The recognition is rarely, if ever, reciprocal.\nI have never seen it reciprocal. There is occasionally, at least, some\nresemblance to this play in our dreams. Karl Du Prel has remarked\nthis fact also (Philosophy of Mysticism, Vol. I., p, 137).\nBut before admitting more force in these cases than may be\npermitted it is worth while to remark that recent experimenters and\nstudents very much discredit the genuineness of these trained\nSalpetriere patients. But I shall not encourage scepticism on this\npoint for the sake of denying the comparison between the cases and\nthe dramatic play of the Piper phenomena. I shall assume their\ngenuineness and press the resemblance as far as it will go, for the\nreason that we cannot afford to defend the spiritistic theory at the\nexpense of facts which might possibly present a clue to the way out of\nit. Nevertheless, the existing doubt about them is legitimate vantage\nground for caution against dogmatism in making the comparison, at\nleast until the cases are examined.\nBut the best external evidence of this dramatic play, or at least\nsimulation of it, is the fact of automatic writing with its accompani\nments. A general reference to the many articles in the Proceedings is\nsufficient on this point. They show a personality of which the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 273\nsupraliminal is unaware in the same subject, palming off on this\nsupraliminal, knowledge which appears to come from some independent\nsource, but which study shows originates from the subliminal. The\nautomatic self simply plays hide and seek with the normal self. Hence\nputting together these cases of automatic writing and the incidents of\napparently independent personalities in hypnotic experiments, may we\nnot have sufficient dramatic play to give some trouble to the argument\nfor spiritism from that characteristic 1 Assume also that, in the process\nof fifteen years' experimenting and careful directions under Professor\nJames, Dr. Hodgson and others, Mrs. Piper has gradually, though\nunconsciously, become the subject of a thorough education into the\nmore than usually perfect instance of multiplex personality in which\nthe dramatic play can reproduce the realism that we observe in it.\nThen if we can obtain after this any empirical evidence of a deep\nunity below this diversity of personality in the Piper case and thus\nsatisfy the demand of physiology for one brain subject, with this\nunderlying unity and unusually educated power to simulate inde\npendent personalities, we may find the spiritistic theory face to face\nwith a serious difficulty, when we add telepathy to account for the\nobjective facts of the record. There are some interesting facts in\nthese phenomena which might be used to establish this very unity.\nFor instance, my brother Charles, in answer to my question as to\nwhat he died with, asks me : \" Is scarlet fever a bad thing to have in\nthe body 1\" (p. 330). Now I find this exact form of expression by\nanother person back in the Phinuit regime : \" Do you think consump\ntion a bad thing?\" (Vol. XIII., pp. 379 or 522). In my sittings my\nfather repeats his expectation that he will be able to tell me \" all he\never knew \" (p. 325). G. P. uses the same expression in the Phinuit\ndays (Vol. XIII., p. 432). My father's statement that I am \"not the\nstrongest man\" (p. 333) is duplicated in a similar statement by\nPhinuit, made in 1894 to another person : \"You're not the strongest\nman in the country \" (Vol. XIII., p. 519). Again my father said : \" If\nyour father ever lived I am his spirit. I am he. \/ am he \" (p. 475).\nProfessor Newbold got the same phrase from another person : \"If\nFred Morton ever lived I am he \" (Vol. XIV., p. 15). The incident\nwhich my father narrates about the boat and his sister helping him out\nof difficulty (p. 478) suggests comparison with a somewhat similar\ncommunication to Professor Lodge in England in 1889 (Vol. VI., p.\n520). Again in the Imperator regime some such statement as, \" May\nGod have you in His holy keeping \" is very common and also the\nphrase \" keep you in His holy keeping.\" Phinuit uses the expression\nin 1889, \" God keep you in His holy keeping \" (Vol. VI., p. 525). This\nis all the more remarkable because Phinuit has no specially religious\ncharacteristic, and this is the first instance and the only one in which\nT\n\fzi4. [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nI have remarked anything like piety or cant in him. A communication\nfrom Professor Lodge's uncle speaks of the uncle's going \" gunning \"\nat one time, a word which Professor Lodge says is \" rank American.\"\n(Compare also the words \"push\" and \"pull,\" p. 340.) These\nare all that I know, though they are probably more numerous.\nBut such as they are they seem to reflect just the possible unity which\nis necessary for a background to the diversity of personality which\nappears in the Piper case and which assimilates it to multiplex\npersonality generally, so that if we can only add the most extended\ncapacity for telepathy to this we should seem to have at least a\nplausible escape from spiritism.\nIn reply, however, it must be said that the cogency of these\nincidents for establishing a unity between the various \" controls \"\nin the Piper phenomena is greatly impaired by the following considera\ntions. The expression \" not a bad thing \" is too common in general\nusage to attach the slightest value beyond chance coincidence to its\noccurrence in two cases so far apart. Were it not so common an\nexpression in precisely such emergencies we might sustain a suspicion,\nand if it had been a common way of alluding to sickness or disagree\nable facts throughout the history of the Piper case the coincidence\nmight suggest a doubt. But this single instance of it is worthless\nevidentially for giving unity to the different regimes involved, especially\nas the admission of its significance for any such view would so\neliminate the necessity of considering chance in the coincidence of\npsychical research generally as to make the case at large far stronger\nfor spiritism than the sceptic is willing to concede. We cannot safely\ndiscard chance in this problem. The same can be said of the\ncoincidence in the expression about my comparative strength and the\nincidents about the boats. The mode of expression is a very common\none and scarcely anyone is exempt from such an escapade as is\ndescribed in the boat incident. It is not surprising that both\nshould occur. In fact, it might be surprising that this duplication\ndoes not occur more frequently than it does, if only on the ground of\nordinary physiological analogies that a nervous system should reflect\nthe effects of its experience even in transmitting the facts that belong\nto the consciousness of others. We cannot attach any special value to\nthe Americanism, \"gunning,\" as it does not necessarily represent the\nuse of an American word by an Englishman who never knew it. If\nwe had to suppose that Professor Lodge's uncle was the direct com\nmunicator the case would be more plausible. But the expression is\none of Phinuit's and represents his way of putting a message that\nmight have been very different. This modification of a message\nby the \" control \" is a most common incident. (Compare use of\nthe word \" Sunday,\" p. 432.) Now Phinuit, whether we regard\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 275\nhim as a real spirit or the secondary personality of Mrs. Piper,\nwas American in his experience as a \"control,\" and it would be\nnatural from all that we know either of the action of a real conscious\nness, or from the natural influence of the medium upon any transmitted\nfact, that such a word might be taken to express a thought that the\n\" control \" either obtained in fragments or had to express in its own\nway. Besides there is actually on record in the communications them\nselves the statement, purporting to come from Mr. E., that Phinuit\nlikes to pick up just such words and phrases for use (Proceedings,\nVol. VI., p. 517). This statement is born out also by a number of\nterms that could be selected from the reports, such as a \"nine-shooter,\"\n\" get out,\" \" skip,\" \" gave them a tuning,\" \" slumped through,\" etc.\n(Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 510, 519, 520, 521). These latter instances\ndo not illustrate the unity between the two regimes, but only the\ninfluence of the \" control's \" mind on the result, so that all such\ninstances fall to the ground as objections. Besides this, the Imperator\nregime seems to be exempt from their repetition, observing, as it does,\nall the dignities of the occasion.\nThere is more apparent force in the other two cases, owing to the\npeculiar form of expression in one and to the essentially religious and\nImperator type of language in the other, a feature that is quite opposed\nto the character of Phinuit. The expression, \"have in His holy\nkeeping \" is too common in religious service and human memory to\ntolerate any secure argument for the unity of the different personalities\nunder consideration. Besides, in spite of his irreligious temper, Phinuit\nis not averse to a \" God bless you \" at times, and might very well resort\nto so common an expression as the one indicated by mere chance,\nso that the coincidence has no evidential value.\nWe are then left to the first of the last two phrases for the\nargument to show the unity of the trance personalities, namely, the\nstatement : \"If I ever lived,\" etc. This instance is more striking and\ninteresting because it does not represent so common an expression or\nform of putting the thought as in the other instances. But after\ndisqualifying the other cases as arguments, it is a poor refuge to make\nso gigantic a conclusion as a unity of subject for the universal cleavage\nwe observe in the case depend upon this one little exception and\ncoincidence. Chance could not figure in anything if we allowed\nourselves to attach causal significance to such a phenomenon as this.\nEven if the causal unity be there as a fact, we should require\nbetter evidence than we have in this instance to justify conviction.\nWhen we add to this both the influence of the medium's organism\nand that of the \" controls \" upon the form of the communications,\nas is marked in the thousands of cases where this unity of trance\npersonalities is not even suspected, we have a rather invulnerable\nt 2\n\f276 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nargument against attaching much value to this one coincidence, in\nspite of the fact that it belongs to two regimes. Dr. Hodgson will\ndeal with this feature at length in a later report. But when examined\nit does not give any unity to the different personalities, but only shows\nthe limitations under which different personalities work, and the\nsuggestion of its possibility is actually so weak evidentially that I\nshould not even mention or discuss it, were it not that it is imperative\nthat we search every nook and corner for difficulties in the spiritistic\nhypothesis. But the weakness of the case is evident when we observe\nthe tremendous general cleavage between these personalities that are\ndemonstrably no part of the medium's normal equipment. I shall have\nto leave the confirmation of this by the empirical data of the record to\nthe reader, as it would occupy too much space here to even touch upon\nit. Especially is the case reinforced by the fact that if there be any\nunity at all between tho various trance personalities, it should show\nitself far more frequently, as it does so in the ordinary cases of\nsecondary personality, where the limitations of the normal self con\nstantly reflect themselves in the secondary self, even when the latter\nappears the superior. What astonishes one in the Piper instance is to\nfind that this supposed unity does not exhibit itself as it should if it\nexist at all. Casual coincidences will not show it, and there is no such\ncommon choice of expressions and language as so easily connects the\nprimary and secondary selves in the usual cases of hypnosis, where,\nthough recognition is interrupted or suspended, the main incidents of\nthe general character, habits, and expressions will often, and perhaps\ninevitably creep out and betray the unity of the two selves. But the\nonly trace of this unity in the Piper case is either this casual unity,\nwhose significance we have to reject, or the unity of her own subliminal\nand supraliminal which is to be expected in all circumstances, but\nwhich does not reflect itself in the trance personalities in any sugges\ntive way. The habits of the organism, whether physical or psychical,\nsubliminal or supraliminal, ought to be found in the results, and might\nbe expected, on all natural grounds of experience, to affect the perfect\nintegrity of the separate personalities on any theory whatsoever. But\nthe psychical streams represented in the various trance personalities\nexhibit an independence of these habits and a cleavage between them\nselves, as well as between them and the many communicators involved,\nthat is far more perfect than any study of secondary consciousness\nwould lead us to expect. A minute study of the case will bear this\nstatement out beyond question, while it is absolutely necessary to\nestablish a psychical unity between these personalities in order to get\nany fulcrum at all against the weight of the spiritistic theory. The\nstrength of the case for this distinctness of cleavage is apparent when\nthe small amount of evidence that I have produced breaks down, even\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 277\non a collective basis of argument, and more especially as it is not\nqualified even to suggest any marked influence from either organic or\nsubliminal habits on the part of the medium. The organic and psychic\nunity should coincide in order to make out even a plausible case for\nsecondary personality in the explanation of this dramatic play, while\nthere should not be any such overwhelming distinctness of character\nand language between Phinuit, G. P., and Imperator as appear, and\nthat does not coincide with organic and subliminal or supraliminal\nfunctions derived from experience in some form. This is perfectly\nevident and conclusive in studying the remarkable difference between\nthe trance condition and Mrs. Piper's emergence from it. The\nphenomena of secondary personality are frequent in the latter, but never\nnoticeable in the former, unless hunted for with the utmost care in\nsporadic instances which in no way suggest any unity in the various\ntrance personalities. Observe the very pertinent fact that the trance\npersonalities become objective realities in the third person to Mrs.\nPiper's subliminal as she emerges from the trance and catches messages\nonly in broken fragments. The cleavage between the trance condition\nin respect of personality and that of the subliminal emergence from it\nis very different from the cleavage between the two subliminals which\nshe exhibits in this emergence. In fact, the cleavage hardly exists in\nthis latter at all. But it is most interesting to note that just where\nthe ordinary phenomena of secondary consciousness begin to appear\nin Mrs. Piper the spiritistic begin to disappear, namely, the\nindications that we are dealing with realities other than subliminal\nmental states.\nHaving thus disposed of all empirical evidence in the Piper record\nitself in favour of the necessary unity between the various \" controls,\"\nas a condition of appealing to secondary personality in dispute of\nthe spiritistic significance in the phenomena, I go on to consider the\nobjection from the dramatic colouring in other instances of secondary\nconsciousness, a fact that is designed to classify this case inductively\nwith all others. In what may be called the dramatic play of hypnosis,\nthough it bears no essential comparison with the Piper case, as I have\nshown in the distinction between dramatic imitation and dramatic\ninterplay between different personalities, there is yet a participation\nsometimes by one personality in the experience of another. This is\nseldom, or never, reciprocal. But secondary personality betrays a\ncommunity of ideas that never occurs in the Piper case except as\nthis community conforms to the conception and representation of\nconversation and intercourse between real beings. In the ordinary\ninstance of secondary consciousness these data appear as stolen, or as\ncommon property, and acknowledgments are seldom made. The\ncommunity is automatic and not self-conscious. But both the form\n\f278 [part\nJ. H. HysU\/p, Ph.D.\nand the matter of the intercourse between the trance personalities of\nMrs. Piper represent the reciprocity of sane and intelligent exchange\nof ideas. There always appears either a stated reason for this com\nmunity in the nature of the situation real or represented, or the\ncommunity is of a kind that betrays no resemblance to the indis\ncriminate access of one hypnotic personality to the experience of\nanother. There is too much intelligence and natural adjustment to a\npossibly real and complex situation in a transcendental world, in our\ncase, to compare it with the mechanical action of the usual secondary\nconsciousness which does not even imagine a real or fictitious situation\nfor intercourse between personalities, and consequently the Piper\nphenomena get such a unity of a rational sort as characterises distinct\npersons working like a collective whole to a common end. This is\nspiritistic. The ends of secondary personality are at cross purposes and\nare not unified at all in anything but their accidents. Not so with the\nPiper case. Its unity is fundamental with respect to its avowed end,\nnamely, the proof of individual survival, but not in respect of the\nagencies that work together toward that end. Their personalities\nshow no reciprocity of ideas or experience that is not like the inter\ncourse of real beings in working for the same end. The contrast in\nthis respect with the so-called dramatic play of pseudo-spiritistic\nphenomena is very striking, where, as I have said, we get the most\nsuggestive evidence of any comparison whatever with the characteristic\nunder consideration. The whole play of ordinary automatic writing is\nmechanical and shows all the limitations and the marks which usually\ncircumscribe both the fact and the pretensions of a transcendental\nworld. When it reaches the point of supposing such a world, it is\nhaunted with the oracular obscurity and contradictions of the natural\nignorance of any brain on such a subject, as well as the limitations of\nsupraliminal experience. There is an organic unity in the Piper case\nthat is established by its end, not by its mental states. Hence that\ncomparison with others which the student of secondary personality is\nwont to make is to be dismissed, so that we are left without adequate\nanalogies in general to reduce the uniqueness of the Piper phenomena.\nThis does not mean, of course, that a man cannot adhere to the\nhypothesis of a combination of secondary personality and telepathy\nto account for them, but it does mean that the hypothesis is\nwithout adequate empirical and scientific evidence in its support.\nIt is purely a priori and so based upon merely accidental resem\nblances. But such a judgment cannot be entertained as anything\nmore than an evasion of its significance until adequate evidence is\nproduced in cases unquestionably non-spiritistic to show a dramatic\nplay so perfect and realistic as in the one under discussion. I do\nnot know a particle of evidence for any such characteristic carried out\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 279\nwith such organic consistency and intelligence toward a single end and\nwith such distinctness of personal intelligence and character as here.\nPierre Janet's Leonie 2 criticising Leonie 1 with a full consciousness\nof the hitter's life, and Dr. Morton Prince's X 3 laughing at X 1 while\nknowing all and more than X 1, do not in the slightest resemble the\ninterplay of personality with its reciprocal exchange of ideas, as if\nreal, that so characterises the Piper case. Consequently, I must adhere\nto the thesis that the only objection to the spiritistic theory which\nI can admit is extremely tenuous and dubious on the one hand, and\ninvolves such a combination of enormous powers and unconscious\ndeception on the other, as defies all ordinary scientific suppositions\nin this direction. The sceptic's only resource in the last analysis\nis the unique character of the case, and a demand for its\nrepetition in another instance before giving in his allegiance.\nBut this is an abandonment of scientific evidence for his theory of\nsecondary personality, while we have a vast mass of other phenomena\npointing in the same direction and which are not discredited by this\nexplanation of the Piper case, as they are of a spontaneous and\nexperimental kind not connected with any exhibition of secondary\nconsciousness even in appearance, though they are inferior to the Piper\nrecord in credentials. The difference, however, is one that cannot be\ndescribed briefly to any man who does not take the pains to examine\nand study carefully the reports on the case. It is a difference which\nevery one will have to see for himself, and I should not have taken the\ntrouble here to discuss it at all in language that will seem to imply at\nleast some resemblance to secondary personality, had it not been\nnecessary to indicate to the reader that I fully reckoned with that\nhypothesis in making up my convictions. The accusation that it is\nmerely what I have rejected will be made generally by persons who\nhave neither studied phenomena like these in general nor adequately\nexamined the special case before us. They cannot be refuted by any\nbrief characterisation of the phenomena that I can give here, and\nhence I can only deny the analogy which they imagine and challenge\nthem to reproduce it in the same form and extent without the evidence\nof personal identity, as a condition of revising the provisional\nhypothesis that I have accepted. It will require very little dispas\nsionate study of the dramatic interplay of different personalities to\ndiscover the rationality of supposing them independent intelligences\nuntil the evidence for personal identity in the incidents of the record\nis dislodged, and when we observe the vast amount of evidence against\nany psychical unity in these personalities and that the dramatic play\nof personality is not imitative and mechanical, but intelligent and\nadjusted to a rational end, we shall be satisfied to use the comparison\nwith secondary personality with very great caution, and only as a\n\f280 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ndefence against any exposure to illusion. But the moment we\nseriously examine the consequences to which the application of\nsuch a theory leads in its appropriation of brain powers without\nempirical evidence, and the amount of unconscious deception involved\nin the actual intelligence displayed by these phenomena, we shall\nwonder whether \"spiritualists\" have been the only victims of\ncredulity.\nI have spoken all along, however, of secondary personality and its\ncombination with telepathy as if they were necessarily inconsistent\nwith spiritism. The reason for this assumed inconsistency is the\nevidential problem in the case. But there is a way to look at secon\ndary personality, whether with or without telepathy, as a condition of\nthe proof of spiritism, even though its diversified forms are an obstacle\nin evidential matters. By this I mean that secondary personality may\nbe a transitional state between normal consciousness and the conditions\nnecessary for communication with a transcendental world.\nWe must not forget that secondary personality is not very clearly\ndefined. It is an expression very largely for our ignorance in regard\nto many of its conditions and phenomena. We require some phrase\nfor the activities that seem, superficially at least, to lie between the\npresumably mechanical functions of the brain which exhibit no\norganising intelligence and those which so completely imitate and\nreproduce all the phenomena of consciousness that they cannot\napparently be classified with the former, while the absence of mnemonic\nconnection with the normal state separates them from that class. But\nin spite of their apparent nature as a form of consciousness they are\nnot accessible to introspection and study of the individual who\nexperiences them, and hence they must remain more or less unknown\nto those who are best qualified to pronounce upon their character and\ncauses. In addition, however, to this field of ignorance regarding the\nmatter there is another aspect of it that is equally undefined, and that\nis so far favorable to the possibility that secondary personality may be\na transitional condition to that delicate and complex combination of\ncircumstances under which communications of an intelligible sort from\nthe dead can be effected. This is the extreme elasticity of the concep\ntion which secondary personality represents. It connotes every\ncondition of subliminal phenomena between somnambulic suggestibility\nin which the mind seems entirely passive and those spontaneous\nactivities that completely simulate another personal mind than the\nnormal. In this wide gamut every imaginable phase of mental action\nbetween normal consciousness and pure unconsciousness may be repre\nsented, and this, too, with interminable degrees of complexity. If the\n\" subliminal \" does not coincide with secondary personality it must\nropresent a still wider field of nescience. But this question aside, the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 281\nextremely elastic conception which secondary personality involves,\nhaving no definable limits except those which circumscribe the nature,\nfunctions and experience of the subject itself, enables us to study\nits various phases with reference to the different degrees of spontaneity\nand receptivity of which it may be capable. With the dominance of\nits spontaneity, whether this consisted in a play upon the subject's own\nexperience mnemonically separated from the supraliminal conscious\nness, as in automatic writing, somnambulism and hypnosis, or in the\nfabrication of a world of its own like dreams and hallucinations\n(Of. M. Flournoy's case, From India to the Planet Mars), we should\nexpect no communications from a transcendental world, even though\nthe impulse of the subject to action came from that source, but\nwe should expect only the various play of its own functions on the\nmaterial of normal experience, divested of the inhibitions and environ\nment constituted by the psychological conditions accompanying\nnorma] consciousness. But, on the other hand, just in proportion\nto the elimination of this spontaneous action and of the various\ninfluences that determine the limits of active secondary person\nality, we might obtain a condition susceptible of reflecting, like\nthe sensibility of the physical organism, the influences of an outside\nmental world.\nNow if we only add to this the possibility that in such a transcen\ndental world the normal method of communication is telepathic, we\ncan understand why, in the ordinary states of secondary personality\nwhere the conditions for telepathic communication even between the\nliving are not supplied, spiritistic messages of an evidential character\ndo not occur though the subject be aware of a transcendental stimulus,\nand that secondary personality might be a connecting link between\na material and a spiritual world, and so abnormal to both. Unless it\ncommonly accompanied telepathic phenomena between the living, we\nwould expect that it should either be wholly eliminated or certain con\nditions realised before we could receive telepathic messages from the\ndead. In this connection it may be worth noting as possibly corrobor\native of this view that telepathy between living minds is extremely\nsporadic and capricious. It is subject to conditions that betray no\nevidence of reproducing the personality of any one, but conforms to\nlaws like mechanical forces, namely, impressibility only to present\nactive energies. Experimental telepathy, as I have often remarked\nhere, shows no tendency to select teleologically, with a view to repre\nsenting another's identity, the facts of the agent's or other living\nperson's memory, but it apparently limits its access to present func\ntional action, and eschews quiescent states, precisely as in the\nmechanical world where only actual energy effects anything. If then,\nwe suppose that our messages conform to this law we must assume that\n\f282 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthe telepathy is from the dead and less probably from the living,\nespecially when it assumes the form and selectivenees of personal\nidentity. Moreover the stages of secondary personality nearest the\nnormal consciousness may limit telepathic access, when that occurs, to\nsporadic acquisitions in the material world, as its suggestibility is\nadjusted to such conditions ; and just in proportion as we suppress or\neliminate this secondary personality in its spontaneous and active form,\nand sever its connection from the influence of normal experience and\nmemory, we may bring the subject into telepathic rapport with the\ntranscendental world, and messages under these conditions would\nnaturally reflect the influence of discarnate spirits. If they require to\nbe in a secondary state in order to communicate, thus cutting them off\nfrom their normal spiritual life, we should expect them to communicate\nfacts representative only of their past, and these perhaps of a trivial\nand confused kind, or even nothing but dream fabrications like our\nsomnambulistic phenomena and the idiotic rambling like much of the\nthe secondary personality that has so often passed for spiritistic\nmessages.\nI do not assume, or beg the question here as to the existence of\nsuch a transcendental world, for I know that this is the issue to be\nproved. I am only postulating it hypothetically for the better repre\nsentation of the complex conditions that may be necessary for\nconnecting it, if possible, evidentially with the known material world.\nIts possibility must be taken for granted because of our ignorance in\nregard to the negative. Hence we have only to extend what we know\nof both telepathy and secondary personality in order to conceive how\nthe evidential problem may be solved.\nBut suppose telepathy may not be the mode of communication in\na transcendental world, there is yet a resource for spiritism in the\ncomplications of secondary personality and that nice balance of its\nfunctions which may be necessary to establish rapport with the trans\ncendental life. Now we very seldom find any conscious interpenetra-\ntion of the several streams of consciousness in the phenomena of\nmultiplex personality. The cleavage is almost universally absolute.\nPersonally I know of but one exception and the facts of this instance\nare not yet made public. At any rate, it is so rare that we musD\nexpect a fortunate combination of circumstances to secure the inter-\npenetration of two or more personalities consciously. Whatever the\ninfluences, therefore, that may be brought to bear upon the subliminal\nwe must expect that they will not often reflect themselves in the\nsupralimininal, or in actions and evidence properly belonging to the\nlatter. Now if we remember two things in this situation, (1) that\nsome motor effect or action, vocal or graphic, is essential in all con\nditions for our knowledge of the mental activity of the subject, and\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 283\n(2) that in the usual suspense of normal consciousness, as in sleep,\nparalysis, catalepsy, etc., motor functions are also suspended unless by\nchance they are accessible to suggestion\u2014if we remember these two\nfacts, we will understand what a rare combination of circumstances\nmay be necessary to the retention of motor functions, vocal or graphic,\nwhile secondary personality is reduced to the passive condition possibly\nnecessary to the receipt of transcendental communications and their\ntransmission to us through that retained motor action. In ordinary\nsecondary personality we have the retention of motor functions\npossibly because it is active, but in reducing this condition to the\n.same passive condition that sleep is assumed to produce for the supra\nliminal it would only be natural to suspend these motor functions also.\nConsequently we might often, in the complex vicissitudes of these\nphenomena, obtain a condition for the reception of messages, but no\nconditions for their motor expression. Whatever the mode of normal\ncommunication in a spiritual world may be, therefore, we require\neither that the interpenetration of the subliminal, by hypothesis\naccessible to communications, with the supraliminal which regularly\ncontrols the machinery of expression, or that condition of eliminated\nspontaneity in the transitionary phenomena of secondary personality\ncombined with the retention of the proper motor functions, so that we\nshould be able to obtain evidential facts of any kind. The difficulty,\nof course, is to be assured of such a condition. But as it is the content\nor subject matter of the phenomena of secondary personality as\nordinarily known, and not the state itself, or any knowledge\nof what it necessarily is, that has discredited spiritism as usually\nmaintained, we are entitled at least to ask the question whether\nsecondary personality may not really be what is imagined here to\nbe possible, namely, a transitional state between normal consciousness\nand the conditions necessary for communication. If this be possible\nwe cannot consider it as in any way opposed to spiritism except on the\nevidential side when its content fails to realise the demands of\nthat theory. Rapport with the discamate is the desideratum.\nOne remark here is borne out by the modern theory of hallucinations.\nThis is that they are due to secondary stimuli. That is to say, they\noriginate in a stimulus, but in one that is not co-ordinated with the\nsense apparently affected by it. To illustrate, an apparition in the\nfield of vision may be caused by some stimulus in hearing or other locus\nof the sensorium, or a sound apparently heard may be due abnormally\nto an impression received elsewhere than the ear. In all such cases,\nthe world of consciousness is not represented by the result of the\nstimulus as it is supposed to be in normal sensory experience. That is\nto say, the stimulus comes from one world and the representation is of\nanother. Armed with this conception we may explain those cases of\n\f284 [part\nJ. H. Hytdop, Ph.D.\nalleged and apparent communication in which the content of the\nmessages is hallucination, secondary personality, or unconscious fabrica\ntion. Supposing that the impulse or stimulus came from the trans\ncendental world and the representation of the facts from the action of\nthe subject's own mind, we can understand, on the theory of hallucina\ntions, how the conviction that the phenomena are spiritistic should arise\nand yet that the content should be manifestly absurd and incredible.\nPossibly some of Swedenborg's experiences are explicable on this\nhypothesis, and if so, we can understand that the deception apparent\nin such mental action is not of the sort to justify the supposition that\nit is in any sense diabolic, but is purely automatic and unintentional,\nthat is, subliminal automatism. I do not mean to imply that any such\ncondition is frequent, since the field of secondary personality is so large\nin which it is not necessary to suppose more than the dream play of\nthe mind on its own experience, and the natural automatism of the\nsubject so qualifies the suspicion of fiendish purposes that we may\nallow such cases as are here imagined to be very rare, and admit them\nonly where the subject matter shows a mixture of the veridical messages\nand evident hallucination. The suggestibility of the secondary state\nis so delicate and its sensory action, like that of dreams, so ready to\nexplode into products of its own manufacture, that we must in some\nway expect to eliminate this spontaneity in order to effect the proper\nrapport for genuine communications. That is to say, eliminate the\nconditions that tend to produce hallucinations or the fabrications of\nsecondary personality, and we may obtain genuine messages from a\ntranscendental world while it will not be necessary to suspect the\ndiabolic character of secondary personality as an escape from the\ncogency of the facts.\nf Let me summarise the position here taken. I assume the following :\n(1) That the discarnate spirit is in a state of active secondary per\nsonality when communicating, possibly at times resembling our hypnotic\ncondition in some of its incidents at least, and exhibiting various\ndegrees of clearness and confusion, merging now and then into delirium,\nautomatism, or complete syncope. This supposition explains both the\ntriviality and the fragmentary character of the messages, together\nwith the rapid movement of thought so evident in them. It also\nexplains easily the occurrence of automatisms. Telepathy between\nthe living cannot plead any excuse for its limitations in this way,\nbecause the powers that have to be assumed for it would give it access\nto any and all incidents of the sitter's memories, important and trivial\nalike. (2) That Mrs. Piper is in a state of passive secondary per\nsonality, a subliminal condition which reflects or expresses automatically\nthe thoughts communicated to it. The evidence that this is her con\ndition is almost overwhelming. The supposition, then, explains easily\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 285\nthe limitations of the whole case, and also the fact that the dramatic\nplay of personality is more consistent with the spiritistic theory than\nwith that of her secondary personality. Mrs. Piper can hardly be in\nan active and a passive state of secondary personality at the same\ntime. (3) That there is some process of communication between these\ntwo conditions of secondary personality, whose modus operandi is not\nyet known. It might be athanato-telepathic in its nature. The\nevidence for this at present is insufficient. Or we might find an\nanalogy in the combination of phonetic and electrical laws in the\ntelephone, in as much as many of the confusions resemble phonetic\nerrors. Much can be explained by this supposition that may not be\ndue to the mental condition of the communicator. (See Appendix\nVII., pp. 643-645.) \\\nThere is one more difficulty to be considered that appears to have\nsome weight in respectable quarters. It is closely connected with the\nproblem of mistakes and confusions, and is comprehended in the same\ngeneral causes. It is usually raised by the same class that takes\noffence at confusion. When some alleged communication is presented\nas coming from a discarnate spirit the usual questions are : \" Why\ncannot a spirit be more explicit and definite \\ Why cannot it name\ncertain specific dates or events at once that will immediately identify\nit 1 Why so much confusion and loss of memory 1 Why so much\ntrouble about their names 1 A spirit ought to be able to announce its\nname at once and to know that it is imperative to do this at first.\"\nTo many this represented disintegration of memory makes the whole\naffair appear very suspicious and creates a presumption for telepathy\nwhich we can easily conceive as capricious, and which experience seems\nto show is so.\nThis objection has in a large measure been answered in all that has\nbeen said about mistakes and confusion. But one aspect of it requires\nspecial notice. It is the tendency of certain presumably intelligent\npeople to a priori decide what a given spirit ought to say to identify\nitself. They argue from what they imagine they would do in the same\nsituation, without really knowing what such a situation is. Unless\nthe alleged spirit tells a coherent story and indulges in lofty sentiments\nin clear language or exhibits some superhuman flights of inspiration,\ngreat truths, etc., they turn up their noses and substitute sneers for\nscience. It is an objection that reflects more suspicion on the intelli\ngence of the man who makes it than upon that of the alleged spirit.\nIt is strange that an agnostic who has abandoned orthodox dogma\non the one hand, and who has seen the terrible lesson in humility\nwhich the doctrine of evolution has taught man in regard to his\norigin against all the poetry and mythology of the past, should\n\f286 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ncling to the theological assumption of some idyllic existence and\nperfection for spirits in case they exist at all, and this without one\niota of evidence ! The fact is that scientifically or otherwise there is\nno reason to suppose the existence of spirits of any kind, much less that\nthey represent anything much better than man is now. Every sane and\nintelligent man will take the evidence, good or bad, that he can get\nand affirm or deny the existence of spirits before saying what they\nought to do as communicators or what estate they shall possess before\nbelieving in them. The chasm which is usually supposed to exist\nbetween an embodied and a disembodied spirit has no excuse for its\nexistence except the imagination of unscientific men. After the\ndoctrine of evolution it is absurd to take any cross section of this\nprocess and assume that the next stage of it will mark an immeasurable\ndistance and degree of progress. It is flatly against all the laws and\nanalogies of nature to do this, and absolutely inexcusable in the minds\nof men who make the slightest profession of science. The existence\nof spirits cannot be judged by any a priori ideas that appeal to our\naesthetic sense instead of the actual evidence, and the best way to\ntreat any objection to them on this assumption is to employ Gibbon's\nsneers and to jeer a man out of court. In this, however, I am not\ndefending the insanities of this subject. I know that plenty of folly\nmay like to apologise for itself under cover of just this language. But\nit is nevertheless a perfectly inexcusable illusion to indulge our\njudgments in the assumption that, if spirits exist, they can talk the\nlanguage of poetry and inspiration. You may have an indulgent\npublic in your favor when you trust fancy in its pictures of preter\nnatural intelligence and powers, but science will only stand by and\nmark your faith. Evolution has destroyed the golden age of the\npast, and spiritism, with a similar lesson of humility, may destroy\nthe illusory golden age of the future. From what we know of\nthe influence of hypnosis upon the consciousness of personal identity\nand of physiological disturbances in the brain affecting the in\ntegrity of memory, so far from expecting any traces whatever of\npersonal identity, even if the soul survived as an \" energy,\" we should\nrather wonder that any intelligible message should come in the\nattempt to communicate. Both from our knowledge of physiology and\nfrom the necessity of intervening obstacles between incarnate and dis-\ncarnate existence, all the material conditions of our present mental\nstates and modes of communication being removed, we should rather\nexpect spirits, even when they retained the consciousness of personal\nidentity and possessed perfectly clear thought in their own natural\nmedium, only to squeak and gibber like poor Polly in their effort to\nspeak to us through such media as must be employed. The amazing\nthing is that there should be either any survival at all, or any traces\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 287\nof it possible. Hence there is nothing to do but to handle without\nmercy every man who is so ignorant of the postulates of scientific\nmethod and of the immense difficulties that must of necessity be\nencountered in real communications from a transcendental world as to\nask that spirits should speak the language or exhibit the intelligence\nof Plato, of Paul, or of Shakespere. When Pierre Janet could disturb\nthe ordinary functions of memory by producing anresthesia through\nhypnosis, or restore its functions by reproducing local sensibility, we\nneed not be surprised at the incoherencies of communication, even if\nthere were, no intervening obstacles to its existence. But add the\nlatter conditions to the former and the wonder is that the insanities of\nspiritualism are not far worse than they are. Physiology also shows\nin the localisation of brain functions that we have probably to\ndistinguish between the centres for the higher psychical activities and\nthe sensory-motor, putting the former in the prefrontal lobes and the\nlatter in the area about the fissure of Rolando. (Mills. The Nervous\nSystem and Diseases, pp. 321-352.) The older view supposed that the\nmotor action of the Rolandic area was unaccompanied by consciousness\neven of the sensory sort, so that sensations were associated with con\nsciousness or the higher mental activities in general. The memory of\nboth the sensory and intellectual processes would thus appear to\nbelong together. But the newer view seems to make the physio\nlogical distinction between the locus of the intellectual and the\nsensory coincide with the psychological distinction from time\nimmemorial between these two types of consciousness. Unless the\nsensory experience were taken up by the intellectual process and\nassimilated in its own way, it might be that any disturbance to\nthe physical conditions of sensation would affect the integrity of\nrecollection and recognition. Pierre Janet's experiments, showing an\nintimate connection between amnesia and anaesthesia and at least\napparently coinciding with the natural implications of the latest\nresults in the study of the localisation of brain functions, should\nthrow some light on the possibilities of difficulty in the process of\ncommunication independently of the merely physical and other\nobstacles to it, even after the possibility of survival is granted. But\nI cannot go into the complexities of this subject without taking more\ntime and space than this report will permit. I must rely upon the\nreader's knowledge of the fact that its complexities are great enough to\njustify the rebuke that science is entitled to administer to the pride\nand confidence of those who expect communications to be clearer even\nthan in our telephone.\nThe difficulty with proper names which is a stumbling block to\nmany persons in studying these experiments may have an explanation\nin the ultimate solution of physiological problems and their perplexities,\n\f288 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nas indicated above. But in the meantime there are some facts that\nmay explain it without any such appeal. It will be observed by the\nstudent that there seems to be a natural distinction between familiar\nand unfamiliar terms in the communications. The phraseology of them\nis comparatively narrow, and mistake or confusion often coincides with\nthe introduction of a term that is not so common as others (Gf, phrase\n\" United Presbyterian,\" p. 492). The suspicion is confirmed also by\nmy experiments in artificial communication where the confusion and\nerror coincided most generally with the use of proper names and\nunfamiliar terms (p. 624). If that be the case it would only be\nnatural to encounter difficulty in them when communicating with\nincarnate beings from a transcendental world, even on the supposition\nthat the communicator was perfectly clear in his own mind, which is\nprobably not the case. (See my discussion of this question in Harper's\nMonthly Magazine, Vol. CIL, March, 1901, pp. 635-639. Also The\nNorth American Review, Vol. CLXXL, pp. 745-746.) There are other\nfacts that may contribute to the same conclusion. The psychological\ncomplexities of memory, involving the various relations between intel\nlectual, sensory, and motor functions, the relation between different\nideas and the visualising and auralising process, the mental habits of\nthe individual in the use and recall of not only proper names, but also\nunfamiliar words, to say nothing of the difficulties of sending his ideas\nthrough a physical organism which he could not be expected to use as his\nown\u2014all these are factors in the explanation of the communications and\ntheir contents on any theory whatsoever, and have to be reckoned with\nin telepathy as much as in spiritism. In fact the difficulties in connec\ntion with telepathy ought not to be so great as in the case of its rival\ntheory, as telepathy eliminates both the psychological problems con\nnected with the supposed spirit and those of a supposed transcendental\nworld and is left to contend only with the physiological and psychological\npeculiarities of the sitter, in which case there ought to be no difference\nin the alleged communications from different persons. But these\ndifferences correspond with what we should expect in the known\ndifferences between individuals, so that both the facts of confusion in\nregard to proper names and unfamiliar terms and the manifold\nincreased difficulties over those assumed on the hypothesis of telepathy\nare in favour of spiritism.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 289\nCHAPTER VI.\nConci.usion.\nIt is apparent from all that has been said regarding telepathy and\nthe objections to spiritism that my predilections lie in the direction of\nthe latter theory, and I do not require to engage in any lengthy\nrestatement of the argument. I must simply explain what seems to\nme to be the proper scientific attitude to be taken toward such\nphenomena as are contained in this and similar records. The\nsceptical temper is familiar to all of us, and is the prevailing condition\nof general public opinion. To this there can be no objection so long\nas it is intelligent and scientific. On the contrary I think we are to\ncongratulate ourselves on the tenacity and persistence of it, even in its\nunintelligent form. But all this scepticism is not conscious of the\nreason for its justification, and for various illegitimate reasons goes on\ndenouncing \" spiritualism \" from the conceptions of its follies in the\npast. The history of \" spiritualism \" is undoubtedly a heavy incubus\nfor the scientific man to bear. But whatever that may be, the real\nreason for scepticism, which is only a name for caution when it is not\na demand for libertinism, is the momentous character of the conclusion\nand the tremendous consequences, philosophical, moral, religious, and\npolitical, that must follow anything like scientific proof of a future life.\nFaith no longer charms with her magic wand, except among those who\ndo not accept or appreciate scientific method, but whose flimsy standards\nafford no criteria for defence against illusion and deception. Hence men\nwho have been saturated, consciously or unconsciously, with the scien\ntific spirit either give up the hereafter or insist that their belief shall\nhave other credentials than authority. Consequently, every institution\nconnected with social, moral and religious life must be profoundly\naffected, whether for good or ill, by such an assurance as that of a\nfuture life, the doubt about which has turned the aspirations of\nmodern civilisation from the moral to the economic ideal. The\nconsequences make it necessary that we should not be fooled in\nso important a matter as this. We can then well afford to\nfollow scepticism to the utmost limits before yielding to spiritism, if\nonly for securing sufficiently rigid standards of truth and maintaining\nthe right of scientific method to determine the criteria of belief. Our\nfirst duty is to science, and in this we must give the right of way to\nscepticism, as the safest provision against illusion, until the audacity\nof the theories necessary to support it carries us beyond all evidence\nand rationality in the resistance to the alternative view. This is the\nu\n\f290 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nonly legitimate reason for hesitation regarding spiritism, as the danger\nof misinterpretation even in its genuine phenomena is so great that the\nobligation to caution cannot be too stringent. The past reputation\nand the false conceptions of both its facts and doctrines are not a\nvalid excuse for the evasion of phenomena that persist in thrusting\nthemselves upon the attention of science, but are simply warnings\nagainst lowering the standards of truth and defence against illusion.\nWe may think that the future life as presumably indicated by the\nevidence of spiritistic phenomena, even of the highest type, is poor\nand meagre at its best, and that nothing ideal can come of its proof.\nBut however humiliating the facts may be\u2014though they are infinitely\nless so than the unscientific imagination supposes\u2014science has no excuse\nfor evading the issue or following in the wake of popular delusions. It\nis the hard sacrifice of human pride and vanity that stand more in the\nway of a scientific and respectful consideration of these phenomena\nthan anything else. I do not admit that the general interpretation of\nthem is correct, when it repudiates the supposed life implied by them\nas unideal and undesirable, since we are not in a position to demand\nas yet any such construction of that life as may be necessary to\npronounce upon its character with assurance either way. Personal\nidentity is the first and only problem to attack at the outset. All others,\nif soluble at all, are infinitely more complex and difficult to determine.\nPersonal identity is hampered by nothing but the conditions of com\nmunication, which, of course, are numerous enough. It can appeal to\na veritable past. But such a thing as the mode of life in the transcen\ndental world, in addition to the obstacles of communication, is\nburdened by the want in us of any means for conceiving this life\nintelligibly in terms of the experience upon which we usually rely for\nthe regulation of our lives. We should never forget that the language\nemployed may easily mislead us, and can be ultimately comprehended\nonly by the higher faculties trained on the abstraction of sensory ex\nperience, and in constructing from the consistency and diversity of the\ndata, by the higher intellectual processes, a general conception that is\nboth consistent with itself and with the non-sensory consciousness of\nactual life, a conception that cannot be left to the unscientific\nimagination to determine. Unfortunately even the professional\nscientists too often accept the criteria of the plebs in this matter\n\u25a0where their energies ought to be employed in correcting it.\nIt is apparent from all this that I give my adhesion to the theory\nthat there is a future life and persistence of personal identity, that I\nam willing to make it provisional upon the establishment, by the non-\nbeliever in the supernormal of any kind, of sufficient telepathy, in\ncombination with the other necessary processes, to account for the\nwhole amazing result. All other questions I put out of court as not\n\fXLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 291\nrelevant, especially as there is not one sentence in my record from which\nI could even pretend to deduce a conception of what the life beyond\nthe grave is. I have kept my mind steadily and only on the question\nwhether some theory could not explain away the facts rather than\naccept spiritism. But I think that every one without exception would\nadmit that, superficially at least, the phenomena represent a good\ncase for spiritism as a rational possibility. The fact of satisfying the\ncriterion for personal identity can hardly be disputed by anyone on\nany theory whatever, whether of fraud, telepathy, or spiritism.\nHence, after excluding fraud, the only question is whether it is more\nconsistent with the data at hand to believe that they can be better\naccounted for by telepathy with its necessary adjuncts than by the\nsurvival of consciousness after death. I do not care how we conceive\nthis survival, whether in the form of the traditional \"spirit,\" or in\nthe form of some centre of force either with or without the accom\npaniment of a \" spiritual body,\" or again in the form of a continued\nmode of the Absolute. With these questions I have nothing to do as\npreliminary, but only as subsequent to the determination of personal\nidentity. I am satisfied if the evidence forces us in our rational\nmoods to tolerate the spiritistic theory as rationally possible and\nrespectable, as against stretching telepathy and its adjuncts into\ninfinity and omniscience.\nThe objections that I have presented have been considered only as\nso much respect to the real difficulties of the problem, as it must appear\nto both the casual reader and the student of abnormal phenomena who\ncannot so intimately appreciate the pertinence of the facts as can the\nsitter, and who justly clings to the rights of scepticism. These\ndifficulties, however, do not impress me as in reality so formidable as\nthey appear in the abstract. The only one that offers any resistance\nworth serious attention is that which supposes a combination of\ntelepathy and secondary personality, but the force of even this objec\ntion arises from the extremely vague character of it, from certain\naccidental and superficial resemblances between secondary consciousness\nand the interplay of personality in the Piper case which the uncritical\nstudent does not easily detect in its real nature, and from the failure\nof the general statement of the argument to express definitely the vast\nimplications that it must logically accept when worked out to its\nconsequences in order to cover the facts. We merely show that\nsecondary personality explains a number of abnormal mental pheno\nmena which some unintelligent people considered spiritistic, and the\nhabit of dispelling their illusions by that phrase enables us still to use\nit as a charm in the defence of scepticism, which in spite of its rights\nmay easily adopt the tone of dogmatism. But if we once study the\nPiper phenomena with due care and patience we shall discover in the\nu i\n\f292 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ndifference between them and the ordinary facts of secondary conscious\nness a significance in the dramatic interplay of different personalities\nthat reveals the most apparent realism in the whole performance.\nBut even telepathy and secondary personality do not exhaust the\nsuppositions that have to be made. The enormous deception involved\nin so persistent and consistent a representation of the spiritistic reality\nis of a nature to make one pause. A process assumed to be so\nintelligent and acute as it must be to reproduce personal identity in\nthis manner must know whether it is deceiving or not. Nor can we\nstop with the Piper case in making this supposition. This is only one\nin many thousands of those that are continually producing phenomena\nwith an apparent spiritistic import. The only difference between them\nand the case before us is that the latter more nearly satisfies the most\nrigid demands of science. But all of them represent a constant\nattempt to reproduce spiritistic phenomena, and if we are to use the\ntheory of unconscious deception we have to extend it to the subliminal\nof all who have apparitions, mediumistie experiences, spontaneous\ncoincidences suggesting a spirit origin, planchotte and other writing,\nand possibly to the unconscious life of every one of us. Such a\nsupposition baffles all credibility, scientific or otherwise. But it is the\nnecessary consequence of the combination of telepathy and secondary\npersonality, and perhaps of telepathy alone, so that there will no\nlonger be any excuse for agnosticism holding out against a definite\ncharacterisation of the Absolute as the Devil !\nBut I regard the contradictions of telepathy as not only breaking\nit down, but also as disqualifying any and every form of secondary\npersonality for a theory to meet the case. We cannot give telepathy,\nas we have known it experimentally, the power to meet the demands\nof the dramatic play as displayed here without conceiving it so great\nas to make its actual limitations and failures absurd, and in defect of\nthe achievement to successfully realise the functions of the infinite in\nsmall as well as great things, there is no necessity for making any\nappeal to secondary personality at all, to say nothing of the diffi\nculties against it without supposing that telepathy is its necessary\nadjunct. But as I am not dealing at present with the problem of\nsecondary personality beyond the limits of my own record I shall not\nargue against it further. The crucial test of spiritism, in this and all\nother cases, must turn upon the question of telepathy to furnish the\ndata upon which any secondary consciousness has to work. Until it is\nmore fully studied we shall have to assume that secondary personality\nis equal to the task of explaining the dramatic play of personality\nand all the non-evidential data, and base our conclusion upon the\ninsufficiency of telepathy to supply the objective facts in evidence of\npersonal identity. If telepathy involves a contradiction between the\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 293\npowers necessary to account for the true facts and the limitations\ndisplayed in its mistakes and confusions, we need not trouble ourselves\ntoo much regarding the question of secondary personality, though the\nunique and realistic interplay of personality in the various communi\ncators is a vantage ground for further support of the spiritistic theory.\nIn considering the telepathic hypothesis and the problem of\npersonal identity I have not treated all the facts as having the same\nweight, even when they were true. I have often been at pains in my\nnotes to indicate just what truth, or approximate truth, was to be\nfound in a message. I did not do this because the fact was evidential,\nbut because I was concerned in showing that amid the confusion\npresent sufficient meaning might be discovered to prevent considering\nthe case as positively false. The facts upon which I had to rely for\nprimary conviction were such that, with or without confusion, their\npertinence was unmistakable. The approximate truths can only be\nconfirmatory of what might be expected in the way of difficulties in\ncommunication. But the unity of consciousness exhibited both in the\nfacts that were verifiable and in the memory of certain incidents from\nsitting to sitting in which the communicator had a special interest,\nespecially when we observe the distinctness with which different sitters\nare kept apart in spite of the way they are sandwiched in for sittings,\nand the synthetic complexity of the facts given, are considerations\nthat are too realistic to refuse spiritism some scientific charity. When\nI look over the whole field of the phenomena and consider the\nsuppositions that must be made to escape spiritism, which not only\none aspect of the case, but every incidental feature of it strengthens,\nsuch as the dramatic interplay of different personalities, the personal\ntraits of the communicator, the emotional tone that was natural to the\nsame, the proper appreciation of a situation or a question, and the\nunity of consciousness displayed throughout, I see no reason except\nthe suspicions of my neighbours for withholding assent. But when I\nam asked to admit the telepathy required to meet the case, the amazing\nfeats of memory involved in the medium's subliminal, the staggering\namount of deception demanded, and the perfect play of personality\npresented, as capable of explaining the phenomena without spirits, I\nmay say, yes, if you choose to believe this against all scientific\nprecedents. But I am not ready to accept any such appeals to the\ninfinite, especially when we have only to extend the known laws of\nconsciousness to account for the facts instead of making such\nenormous suppositions for fear of losing our social respectability.\nScience is bankrupt when it has to appeal to the infinite. If\nthat infinite remained self-consistent there would be less difficulty in\ntolerating its operations, but when it is a mixture of amazing successes\nand absurd failures I am not likely to regard it with much veneration.\n\f294 [PART\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nI appreciate materialism, as one who once saw no way out of it and\nwho had no personal interest in getting out of it. But this was when\nthe known limitations of consciousness and mental action generally\nwere correlated with the known limitations of the brain. Consciousness\nin such a view is regarded as a functional activity of the organism and\nits powers in all accepted physiology and psychology, presumablj*\nrational, are confined to what it can receive and do on the spot. But\nwhen it comes to giving the brain the power to spontaneously acquire,\nand intelligently select, from any confused mass of memories at an\\r\npoint of time and sp^ce in the whole universe of conscious and\nunconscious mentation, and to do this instantly, reproducing perfectly\nall the complex facts necessary to establish personal identity, I much\nprefer to go outside that brain for my cause, as I am not accustomed\nin the use of scientific method to apply the predicates of infinity and\nomniscience to that organ ; nor to any individual mind. I may be\nmistaken, and if so I shall leave the correction to those who do not yet\nbelieve in telepathy. My preference for the spiritistic theory after\nfacing the problems just indicated rests on a very simple basis, and it\nis that I am not prepared to build any altars to Mrs. Piper's brain,\nespecially when I am asked to propitiate a diabolic divinity that I\nshould much prefer to see in the Lucretian intermundin.\nIt is worth remarking in this contention that, in so far as explana\ntory considerations are concerned, spiritism has superior claims\nscientifically to telepathy. Spiritism is an appeal to known causes,\nthe fundamental criterion of all scientific procedure ; telepathy is an\nappeal to the unknown (Cf. Footnote, p. 128). 'We know just what an\nindividual consciousness can do when it exists. In supposing its con\ntinuance beyond death we are but extending a known cause beyond cer\ntain concomitants and limitations of its terrestrial manifestation. As a\nphenomenon it is quite as intangible and invisible in its incarnate con\nditions as it can be supposed to be in the discarnate. We know it\neven terrestrially, in others, only by induction applied to certain\nphysical movements. Hence when we advance spiritism to explain the\nPiper and similar phenomena we are but extending known causes\nprecisely as Newton extended terrestrial gravitation to explain\nphenomena previously excluded from its operations. We are using\nthe same cause to explain the unity of certain facts that we used to\nexplain them when the person was living. It is telepathy then that\nappeals to the unknown, so that the spiritistic hypothesis has one\nscientific credential that telepathy has not.\nIn this conclusion, however, I am going to add a very important\nconsideration which is the mainspring of the whole discussion and\nmentioned in various places only by implication, but which has not\nbeen definitely formulated as I wish to do it now.\n\fxLI.] Observations of Certain Trance Phenomena. 295\nThis discussion is not designed primarily to convince the reader\nthat the hypothesis which Dr. Hodgson and myself have adopted and\ndefended is the true one, that it is the only one to be tolerated in the\npremises, but that it is entirely rational to suppose it possible, and that\nit explains the phenomena when it is assumed. I offer this record as\nsome evidence for the spiritistic theory, but not as final proof of it. The\nprocess of forming the personal conviction that it is the preferable one,\n\" the will to believe or disbelieve,\" must be left to the individual to\ndetermine for himself. I grant to others the inalienable right to make\nany suppositions they please in preference to the one defended here.\nBut if they intend them for any other purpose than to indicate the\nconditions on which they are willing to be convinced of spiritism, if they\nintend that their suppositions shall serve as an alternative hypothesis\nto the one here advanced, I shall exact of them the production of the\nsame specific and experimental evidence for the truth and explanatory\npower of their assumptions that we have presented in the Piper\nphenomena, before they shall -be entitled to scientific recognition. It\nis all very well to insist on a high standard of evidence, and to demand\nthat certain conditions shall be satisfied before accepting the truth of\nour hypothesis, or the fact that it is the only one possible, but you\ncannot make your personal conversion to this truth a condition or\ncriterion of the explanatory power ascribed to the spiritistic theory.\nThe validity of our hypothesis is not conditioned by its power to make\nconverts to its truth, but only by its capacity for rationally explaining\nthe facts. Or, to put this in the obverse form, it is no refutation of\nthe spiritistic theory to say that you are not convinced of its truth, or to\ndemand that we eliminate the infinite from it in order to establish it.\nThe asserted alternate hypothesis must be supported by independent\nfacts that make spiritism either impossible or superfluous. If spiritism\nwere not actually explanatory of the facts this demand could not be\npressed, inasmuch as the present record could then be quoted as\nevidence for telepathy. But the necessary admission that spiritism\nwill explain the case imposes upon the rival theory the obligation to\nsupply experimental evidence independently of this record to prove\nthat telepathy, with its adjuncts, can reproduce as perfectly the\npersonal identity of a living consciousness as Mrs. Piper produces that\nof the deceased.\nTo repeat them, the main object here is not to convince the reader\nthat spiritism is the only hypothesis to be entertained, but that it is\nrational to suppose it as one of the possible explanations. To me it is,\nat present at least, decidedly the preferable one. At any rate, if it\nhas relevant facts representative of personal identity to depend upon\nand suggesting an appeal to the infinite to escape spiritism, it becomes\na legitimate alternative and working hypothesis among all that may\n\f296 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nbe proposed. On this ground we shall be able to retort upon those\nwho make their personal conviction or conversion a criterion of the\nexplanatory power of spiritism, or who advance alternative suppositions\nfor explaining the phenomena, that they furnish experimental evidence\ninvolving, not the fact of telepathy as we know or suppose it between\nthe living, but the kind of telepathy that will reproduce the unity of\nconsciousness and personal identity in conjunction with the proper\ndramatic play of personality found in these records, but which would\nnot permit in any case a resort to discarnate spirits to account for it.\nUntil this evidence is forthcoming they can have no standing in a\nscientific court. In the meantime I am content to have suggested\nwith Dr. Hodgson the nature and extent of the considerations which\nmust be experimentally proved in order to refute the hypothesis which\nis here defended. When this result is effected it will be time to\nreconsider the position here taken.\n\fXLI.] 297\nAppendices.\nAPPENDICES.\nPreliminary Note.\nThe reader will naturally desire to know how my sittings were\nappointed, and what was Mrs. Piper's previous knowledge of myself.\nI had met Mrs. Piper in the early part of the year 1892 at the house\nof Dr. Thaw in New York, at a meeting where some \"mediumistic\ntrick \" performances were illustrated. (See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.\nVIII., p. 307.) I did not make her acquaintance in any special way,\nbut was only introduced to her. Some time afterwards, I had the\nlatter part of a sitting with Mrs. Piper, entering the room and taking\nmy place as sitter while she was in trance. I talked with her, however,\nafter she came out, for some fifteen or twenty minutes. The following\nis the contemporary record of my sitting.\nMay 20th, 1892.\n[Mr. J. H. Hyslop has fifteen minutes after Mr. Dow's sitting. See\nProceedings, S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 570.]\n[Phinuit talking.]\nHow are you ? You're a pretty good fellow. [Something about folks at\nhome.]\nWho's John ? [I admitted that my name was John, though not true.]\nThere's an old gentleman in the spirit belongs to him. Gentleman's father.\nYour father. He wants to call John. Who's John ? You have had some\ndifficulties. I want to help. He's all mixed up. Tell my son John I want\nto help him out of it. He wants you to answer.\nThere's a lady in the body has some trouble with her head. Who is it\nthey call Mary ? Very closely connected. She has some trouble in her\nhead. You needn't worry. She gets nervous. A bright woman. [These\nincidents in the main are correct.] A little catarrhal trouble in the head.\nWhat's the matter with her foot ?\nA friend will help him financially as well as mentally. [Correct.] You\ndo something. I don't know how to illustrate it, as it's something to do\nwith the brain. [Touching head.] It has something to do with the develop\nment of the brain and with thought. [Correct.] You keep on and you will\ndo well. You have developed it well. Sometimes you get all knotted up.\n[The reference to my mental confusion contains a very interesting fact. For\na few weeks previous I had been reflecting on the relation between inhibition\nand responsibility, and on the day preceding the sitting it suddenly occurred\nto me that I could prove my point by the figures representing the relation\nbetween association time and will time. I spent the afternoon looking up\n\f298 [part\n\/- H. Eyslop, Ph.D.\nthe matter, but found myself disappointed in the result, although thoroughly\nconvinced that I was correct in the main principle. About a month later I\nsolved tho problem. But Phinuit's statement cannot be made a prediction,\nbecause, in connection with correctly indicating the recency of my thought\nand the present confusion, which exactly described the condition of the\nprevious day, he merely indicated by the promise of success the confidence\nI had that I was correct.]\n[In my original note I neglected to say that \" Mary \" is the name of my\nwife. (May 2nd, 1901.)\u2014J. H.H.J\nYou're getting some very good ideas.\nYou're going to have a long holiday. Your lady is going with you. Over\na small body of water. [Correct.]\n[A long, distinct story now told about a Fred Ellis, who years ago fell\ninto the water by a bridge, and was pulled out. Something about little\nsacks. Sitter has no knowledge of such person.]\nSo far as I am aware, I never saw Mrs. Piper again or had any\ncommunication with her till I went out to Arlington Heights on\nDecember 23rd, 1898.\nThe sittings which form the subject of my present report were\narranged for in the following manner. I had written in August (1898)\nto Miss Edmunds for them, but had concealed myself under the\npretence of wanting them for some one else. Of this I was very\ncareful, but Mrs. P. was absent on her vacation, and the plan fell\nthrough. After Dr. Hodgson's return to this country I wrote to him\nfor sittings, and, in order not to allow Miss Edmunds (who had never\nmet me, and who had only corresponded with me) to know my plans,\nI asked Dr. H. not to tell her. The letter was forwarded to him\nunopened, he being at Bar Harbor at the time. In the course of\nthe correspondence arranging the sittings, a vague letter of mine to\nhim, misaddressed by myself to the office instead of to Dr. H.'s rooms,\ngave a chance for Miss E. to guess the case, but only to guess it from\nthe handwriting, as the contents of the letter betrayed nothing. She\nseems to have suspected it, but says she did not breathe my name to\nany one.\nI was ateo very careful not to tell any one in New York of my\nintentions except my wife, who was counselled to keep quiet, and\nalso Professor Butler on Saturday, tho 17th December, 1898, a letter\nto him asking for trinkets from some deceased friend having been\nmailed in the morning, if I remember rightly. No others bad the\nslightest information of my plans. The whole responsibility, there\nfore, for fraud in the case will fall upon myself, Dr. Hodgson and\nMiss Edmunds. (See Note 1, p. 344.)\nIt will be interesting to remark, a propos of fraud in the case, that\nthe first sitting is absolutely absurd upon the supposition. Much\ncould have been found out about me and communicated to Mrs. P. by\n\fAppendices. 299\nDr. Hodgson, either of my life in New York, or earlier in the West. -If\nI mistake not, there is a bibliographical dictionary with a pretty full\naccount of my career and work after entering college. I was not\neven identified by the alleged spirits claiming me as son and brother,\nand the apparent allusions to a brother and a sister who died long ago\nrepresent events which I could not verify if I tried, except from a\nrather meagre memory of my own, and from the testimony of two\naunts who know nothing of them except by hearsay.\nThere is, of course, no interest in all this except for the careful\nreader and critic who may wish to know exactly the preceding facts\nand the relation which the contents of the first sitting sustain to\nthem.\nI append the statement of Dr. Hodgson.\nI disclosed to no one the identity of Professor Hyslop, and I made arrange\nments with the trance-personalities for his first series of sittings by referring\nto him as a friend who wished to go four times. The following comprise all\nthe passages dealing with the matter.\n[Rector writing.] . .\nNovemher 12th, 1898.\n.

It will be\nnoticed that in several places references are made, in conversation\nbetween the trance-personalities and Dr. Hodgson, to other sitters,\nand in some of these cases initials only or pseudonyms are given,\ninstead of the real names.\nThe sittings, which usually lasted about two hours, from about\n10.15 a.m. to about 12.15 p.m., were all held at Mrs. Piper's house in\nArlington Heights, Mass., about half an hour by train from Boston.\nEvery word said by Dr. Hodgson or myself at the sittings is\nrecorded, excepti that in one or two instances, noted where they\ni Except also such phrases as, f'One moment, Rector,\" or \"Wait a moment,\nplease,\" used by Dr. Hodgson when it was necessary to turn over the paper, when\nthe writing was being superposed, or when the hand was going over the edge of the\nwriting pad.\n\fXLI.] 301\nAppendices.\noccur, several words addressed to Dr. Hodgson were inaudible to\nhim, and also that I did not myself succeed in recording absolutely\nevery word spoken by myself during Dr. Hodgson's absences from the\nroom during the first sitting. The record of the writing by Mrs. P.'s\nhand is also complete, except that I have only occasionally incorporated\nthe word \" Yes\" when written by the trance personalities in acknow\nledgment of Dr. Hodgson's correct reading of the original writing.\nWhen the \"Yes \" is a response to a question, however, it is, of course,\nincluded. Dr. Hodgson recorded my remarks, which I tried to speak\nvery slowly, partly that the record of them should be complete, and\npartly to facilitate the clear comprehension of my words by the trance-\npersonalities. Besides recording my remarks as I made them, Dr.\nHodgson also copied nearly all the writing by Mrs. P.'s hand as it was\nwritten, and shortly after each sitting we completed the record by a\ncareful comparison with the original writing (see also statements on\np. 14, and footnote on p. 29).\nThere are some cases of curious spelling by the \" machine \" which\nI have thought worth indicating in their proper places. I have\ninserted these, where they occur, in square brackets immediately\nafter the words which they represent. For example, \" lapse [laps] \"\n(p. 407). This means that the word in the original automatic writing\nwas written laps.\nI should add perhaps that the punctuation is not restricted to that\nof the original automatic writing, where there is a deficiency of it. The\nmarks in the original are practically confined to periods and interro\ngation points. A mark like a period seems to serve for the most part\nindifferently for any pause. The repetitions of words or phrases in the\nrecord were generally owing to our inability to decipher them at once\nwhen they were written the first time. Repetitions due to other causes\nwill be noted when they occur unless their origin is obvious from the\ntext (as for example in the emotional repetitions of my father near the\nbeginning of the second sitting). Occasionally in the record of the\nautomatic writing the brackets { } are found. In the original those\nbrackets were made ( ).\nThe notes embodied in the records of the sittings are, except as\notherwise dated, contemporary with the sittings ; that is to say, they\nwere written on the days of the sittings or shortly afterwards. Some\nadditional notes made later will be found at the end of the first series of\nsittings (p. 344), and others, made later still, at the end of the third\nseries. Page references to these later notes will be found in the course\nof the records of the sittings. I have preserved the chronological order\nto a large extent by this arrangement, and a comparison of my own\nnotes made at different times affords, in my opinion, an instructive\nlesson concerning sundry difficulties not sufficiently appreciated by the\n\f302 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nordinary inquirer into the psychological problems before us. It will\nbe seen, for example, in more than one striking instance, that whereas\nin my early notes I condemn certain statements as inconsistent with\nany origin from my father's mind, in my later notes, made after special\ninquiries, it appeared that these statements were entirely relevant and\nthat they pointed distinctly to the identity of my father. I must warn\nthe student then expressly that he cannot estimate the value of any\nincident in the detailed record of the sittings without consulting all\nthe notes concerning it, the later ones as well as the earlier ones. I\nhave taken special pains, in the appropriate places, to give all the\nreferences needful to notes elsewhere.\u2014J. H. Hvsi.op.\n\fxLI.] Appendix I. 303\nAPPENDIX I.\nThis Appendix contains the records of my four sittings on\nDecember 23rd, 24th, 26th, and 27th, 1898, with contemporary notes,\nand also additional notes embodying the results of later inquiries.\nSitting I.\u2014December 23rd, 1898.\nIntroduction.\nDr. Hodgson and myself arrived at Mrs. P.'s about 10 o'clock a.m.\nI had provided myself with a cloth mask, covering the whole face,\nsuch as is used at mask balls. This I put on before leaving the coach\nin which we rode from the station. Under this concealment I went to\nthe door and into the house, upstairs, where we met Mrs. P. in her\nroom. I was introduced to her as Mr. Smith. I merely bowed,\nwithout uttering a sound, and did not speak a word until after she\nhad gone into the trance.\nThese precautions were taken owing to my having met Mrs. Piper\nin 1892, as described above (p. 297), in consequence of which it might\nbe said that she had a chance to recognise me, though at that time I\nhad no beard, while I now wear one. But the mask effectually\nconcealed my face, so that no recognition was possible under any\nordinary circumstances.\nI had, under the mask, a good opportunity to study Mrs. P.'s\nreception of me. As I was introduced she caught sight of the mask,\nand, seeing its meaning, broke out into a laugh at Dr. Hodgson, and\nremarked that only once before had such concealment been used. The\nlaugh and manner were apparently genuine, though she could have\nseen us from the window coming into the house from the coach. I\ncould not detect any simulation in the laugh or manner. They bore\nevery external trace of sincerity.\nPresently, after dusting some articles in the room, Mrs. P. sat\ndown upon her chair for the trance. Pillows had been placed in front\nof her for her head to lie upon while entranced. I sat some three or\nfour feet away where I could closely watch the trance coming on. She\nsat quiet and no indications of the trance occurred for some time, say\nthree or five minutes. Then I noticed a few slight jerks of the head, and\nsome twitching of the right eyebrow, Mrs. P. picking the while at her\nfinger nails. Both stopped in a few moments, and no trace of the\ntrance was to be remarked. Mrs. P. then leaned forward upon the\n\f304 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\npillows, closed her eyes, rubbed them, with her face somewhat flushed\nfor a few moments, then opened her eyes, slightly straightened up,\nused her handkerchief, returned to picking her finger nails, and\nassumed a slightly fixed gaze. I then noted a gradually changing\nexpression in her face. It had lost its flush, and there was some\nthing of a pallor in it, though very slight and only noticeable perhaps\nin contrast with the previous flush. But the most notable change\nin the expression was one that is hard to describe. The whole mus\ncular appearance of it was less drawn than when I was introduced\nto her, and seemed fuller and more flabby, if that word can be used.\nHer mouth, also, was a little drawn on one side, and the gaze became\nmore fixed. Her mouth soon opened and she passed easily without\na struggle into the trance, with something of the appearance of a\nfaint.\nI then changed my position behind and to the right of her so that\nI could watch and read the writing, not a word being said by myself in\nthe meanwhile. Nor was I at this or at any time during the trance\neither in contact with her or where she could see me, her whole face\nbeing turned away from me and buried in the pillows. Sitting there\nbehind and to the right of her, I soon noticed the muscles on the hand\nat the third finger begin to twitch. Soon the whole hand began to\nshake and then reached out and down to write. A. pencil was placed\nin her hand, and the twitching continued for a few moments, and the\nhand again raised itself in the air, but immediately lowered itself to\nwrite.\u2014J. H. H.

H. returns.]\nI must try and speak as clearly as possible to him, Hodgson. I will do\nmy best to speak plainly.\n(R. H. : Yes. Good.)\nI wished to help this gentleman to find his friend on earth. I wish he\ncould understand me clearly. Will you not try, kind friend, to hear me ?\n(S. : Yes.)\nWe have a great deal to do for you and will if you will only try to hear us.\n(R. H. : George, shall 1 go out again, and you try to write slowly and\nclearly so that he may be able to read ?)\nI will try and do my very best to make myself understood by him.\n(R. H. : Yes. Can you write still more slowly ?)\nI will try but I am not alone, remember that, because there are others\ntalking to me here, and I am anxious to help them and they are anxious to\nreach hiin, so I will do the best I can.

As soon as he was\nthrough, Mrs. P. began to come out of the trance. First I noticed\nmuch twitching of the hand and arm, followed by a noise like snoring.\nPresently the head was raised, the mouth opened, and the eyelids very\nslightly raised. She remained in this condition for a few moments,\nthe tongue rolling about in the mouth and slightly protruding. Then\nthis was followed by a decided gaze with the eyes set looking into\nspace, and presently she looked about following Dr. Hodgson with a\nwild stare ; said \"Oh ! dear me,\" and fixed a wild fierce gaze on me.\nI at once left the room for fear of frightening her with my mask as\nshe came out.\nAs I read over the sitting carefully I found several places in which\nI had wholly misunderstood the connection and drift of it. In some\nplaces I had supposed that it was \" Charles \" that was talking with\nme, but I find that it must have been \" Margaret.\" But her death\nsomewhere between or about my first and second year makes the whole\nthing ludicrous. Nevertheless the allusion to mother, Annie and\nCharles, in the same breath, is interesting as a coincidence. But then\nthere is no reason for \" mother \" alluding to her gloves. Then when\n\f312 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthe person communicating answered my question whether \" he passed\nout before you?\" with a \"yes,\" this would be wrong if it referred to\n\" Charles,\" but would have been right if the communicator were\n\" mother,\" as I thought it was at the sitting. \" Margaret \" (?) and\nmy twin sister died somewhere about 1856 or 1858, brother Charles\nand sister Annie about 1865, and mother in 1869. This right relation\ncame out later, as the report shows.\nI noticed during the sitting the curious distinctness and evidence\nof the change from one personality to another. This is almost inde\nscribable, but it was marked in the tone of language, except at the\nclose, where the change from G. P. to Rector was marked by a mus\ncular convulsion in Mrs. P.'s arm.\u2014J. H. H.]\n[Later study shows upon how much misunderstanding some\nfeatures of this note are based. (March 10th, 1900.)\u2014J. H.

But this time it was the left hand that\nshowed the twitching, and not the right, until the trance came on.\nThere was some snoring also this time, as there was not before. After\nher head had fallen upon the pillows, and was arranged by Dr.\nHodgson so that she could breathe easily, soon there appeared the\ntwitching of the fingers and muscles which betokened the preparation\nfor writing, and the arm began to try to move itself into position for\nthis work, but Dr. Hodgson assisted it into place, at the same time\nputting a pencil between the fingers, when the writing began.\u2014J.

But I should have said \" worn out,\" and there\nwere frequent occasions during the last two years when I uttered it. It is\npossible that I have sometimes used his phrase, but I remember frequently\nusing \" worn out \" to my wife. However, I have no reason to interpret\nit as referring to this fact. The main point is to remark that the phrase was\none of father's. Assuming that he was really the alleged communicator it\ncould as well allude to my condition when I last visited him in [January or\nFebruary, 1895] 1894, I believe. I was very tired then, and took down a\nfew days after I left him with a long and severe illness. Its relevancy to\nthis visit and the exhausted condition in which I was is perhaps indicated\nby the allusion to ''lectures\" later. I had lectured in Indianapolis on\nPsychical Research and visited him on this trip. He was much interested\nin what I told him about it, and showed a more receptive mind regarding it,\nthough of an extremely orthodox belief, than I expected to find in him.\nHis later allusion also to his belief that we might get some knowledge of\nanother life fits in with this notion.\nI do not say that the phrase \" tired out \" has any such certain meaning\nas is implied in this account. It is simply consistent with it, and is one of\nthose little touches of personal waisemblancc of which this sitting is full.\u2014\nJ. H.H.]\n(S. : Out is that word ! tired out 'i) (R.

I was much puzzled by it, as I knew of no\nuncle by that name. The \"No\" after my denial of this knowledge is\nsuggestive as partly indicating my correctness and the consciousness of the\nconfusion immediately alluded to by the \"communicator.\" But this is\nvirtually cleared up by the phrase just afterwards, \" not a real uncle,\" which\nI did [not] notice or think of until the next sentence was written. With\nthe resemblance of the word \" Charles \" (slight resemblance only, and\nnoticeable only to those familiar with these sittings) to this uncle's name,\nand the fact that he was not a real uncle, the incident has a perfectly definite\nmeaning. \u2014J.

My scepticism and abandonment of orthodoxy had hurt\nmy father very much. It was long before he could get over it, especially as\nhe had wished me to enter the ministry, though using no compulsion and no\nurgent persuasion upon me. I merely knew his intonse desire. He knew\nmy difficulties in this matter and on the question of immortality, on which he\nnever wavered. Several words and phrases here are perfectly characteristic\nof him. \" Well, I was not so far wrong,\" is word for word an expression of\nhis which he always used, half triumphantly when he found his own\n\fAppendix I. 319\nconvictions turning out true after being controverted, and half con\nceding a right to the opposite opinion before it was refuted and his own\nverified.\nIn the next sentence, as soon as I saw the word \" but \" written, I was\ncurious to see if he would say I was sceptical, the word \"sceptical\" being\nthe one that came to iny mind. I was much interested when, instead, the\nword \" doubtful \" came, as this term was more natural to him, and the one\nhe always used in that connection. Similarly in the reference to my own\n\"ideas.\" He often spoke to me in a half-complaining way, and more\nfrequently to other members of the family and relatives that it was no use to\ninterfere with me ; that I was resolved to have my \"own ideas.\" He\nrecognised in me what goes sometimes by the name of stubbornness and\nsometimes the more respectable name of firmness, and he would always\nyield as soon as he saw that argument did not avail, but with some allusion\nto my \"own ideas,\" never using the word opinions, which I should at least\nmost frequently use.\n\" Well, it is not a fault \" is also like him, and was often used in extenuation\nof some trait in others of which complaint was made and which had its two\nsides.\u2014J.

On any theory of thought-transference there ought to\nhave been confusion such as the name produced in me ; for I could not\nassign the name any meaning, except that I could recall no Ruth in my\nacquaintance. If this feeling could determine the refusal to locate the\nchild within the group of my memories, then telepathy could account for\nturning me off in this way.

It almost broke his heart to see me going in that\ndirection, as his fear was that I should in consequence of it lead a life of\nvice. The only thing that ever reconciled him to my apostasy was the\nknowledge that I did not fall in this respect, and that I was terribly in\nearnest about my opinions. When discussing them, as we seldom did, because\nI knew our great difference in point of view, he never having had the\nscientific education that I had, he would insist, when he saw the intellectual\ndifficulties of his own faith\u2014and he saw them, for he had a remarkably clear\ninsight\u2014he would insist that the great thing was \"sincerity of purpose.\"\nOf course, he is apologising here for his own sincerity of purpose in\nadmonishing me in these difficulties, virtually indicating that there was\nground for my scepticism, which is here discovered after death.

His\nfailure was quite pardonable, because the first name mentioned two\nor three times sounded to me like his own. Besides, he was in a\npoorer position to catch it than I. When I told him what it was he\nrecognised it at once, but his queries addressed to Mrs. P. had turned\nher pronunciation more toward his own name, as at first indicated. But as\nsoon as I indicated what she was trying to say, doing this first by asking him,\n\" Don't you hear what she is trying to say 1 \" and then saying to him \"Hyslop \"\n(short sound of \"y\"), he saw and assented at once, and Mrs. P. then pro\nnounced the name much more distinctly, though strangely enough she now\npronounced it with the \" y \" sound instead of the short \" i \" ; that is, \"High-\nslop \" instead of \" Hislop,\" the latter being the correct pronunciation and the\nfirst one given by Mrs. P., though nearly every one adopts the former until\ntold the proper one. In the neighbourhood in which I was brought up, and\nin Scotland, the name is often pronounced \"Hayslop,\" and sometimes\n\" Highslop.\" But father never used this last. For the most of his life he\nhad used ' ' Hayslop, \" when speaking to neighbours and others, but elsewhere\nand with his sisters it was \" Hislop,\" and most especially during the last ten\nyears of his life when all of us conspired to fix the pronunciation as\n\"Hislop,\" father falling in with this, and so generally that in the community\nwhither he had gone in another State to spend the last years of his life\n(1889-1896) it was always pronounced \"Hislop,\" so far as I know, among\nneighbours and intimate acquaintances.\nBut it must be remembered in all this that I had never taken off my mask,\nand that Mrs. Piper had not seen my face since she had seen it some four or\ni The Roman numerals I. and II., referring to Mrs. Piper's subliminal con\nsciousness (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 397 and 400-1), are used to indicate\nwhat appear to be two stages of this condition, which, however, are not always very\nclearly marked.

Mrs. P.\nwas inside, and seeing me on the porch, where I stood for a moment, opened\nthe door and asked me to come in, saying that she had a very good name\namong her neighbours and did not wish them to see me. I said nothing at\nfirst, but when Dr. Hodgson came in I made some remark in as sepulchral\ntones as I could command, and said no more until after Mrs. P. entered the\ntrance.\nI should also further add that during the whole time I was present in\nboth sittings, both in her normal condition and during the trance, I did not\nhave the slightest physical contact with Mrs. P., except two or three times\nlong enough in the trance to move the arm into position.\u2014J. H.

As my name was announced at the previous\nsitting I did not deem it necessary this time to wear my mask, but it\nis interesting to record that nearly as little was known about my\npresence as if I had worn it. We were met at the door by the servant\nand went up to the room where the sittings are held without seeing\nMrs. P. I sat down on the floor in a corner of the room behind the\nsofa to untie a package with almost my back toward the door where\nMrs. P. was to enter. She entered and spoke indifferently to Dr.\nHodgson. I looked up to speak, but her face was turned away from\nme and I quickly turned back to my work without speaking, and in a\nmoment I overheard Mrs. P. remark to Dr. Hodgson that she had not\nseen me until then. I turned my head to look at her and found that\nshe was not looking at me at all, but was in position for the trance.\nI then moved into my proper place and not the slightest attention was\npaid to me, and soon Mrs. P. was in the trance, apparently without the\nslightest clue as to who I was, even if she had known me well before.\nI left the sitting before she recovered consciousness, so that there was\npractically nothing still to identify me though I offered the opportunity\nfor it by abandoning the mask. I do not say that she could not have\nidentified me, but only that the conditions of the present (third) sitting\nwere practically as good for concealment as in the two previous\ny 2\n\f324 [PAET\n\/.

I remember, remember well our talks about this life and its\nconditions, and there was a great question of doubt as to the possibility of\ncommunication ; that, if I remember rightly, was the one questiou which\nwe talked ovor.\nWill return soon. Wait for me.\n(S. : Yes, I shall wait.)\n\f326 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\n[Here is an incident of more than usual interest. It cannot be understood\nwithout a lengthy narrative. Two chronologically distinct, but connected,\nevents are here alluded to. One of them, our talk on the future life, etc.,\ntook place a year before his death, and the other, his possible intention to\nreturn to me (p. 356), occurred on his death-bed. I have already remarked\nin my comments on the second sitting that there seemed to be an allusion to\na conversation which I had had with him on the subject of psychical research\nand its importance, just after my visit to Indianapolis, already referred to.\nThere is an evideut reference to this again here in the communicator's\nlanguage. This is quite striking to me from the statement a little earlier\nabout its \"not being an hallucination, but a reality.\" He was not familiar\nwith the term hallucination, though he knew its import very well. But\nin our talk about the subject of evidence for the hereafter I was careful to\nlay much stress upon the fact of hallucination and the difficulties that it\nproduced for any claim to scientific proof. He saw it, but his faith\nwas too strong to be moved by it, and I can see the half-triumphant tone of\nhis present manner, as it always was in like situations verifying his own\nbelief or forecast of any event, though not in any boasting or victorious\nspirit, but only the strong satisfaction that he felt, as perhaps all of us\nwould, when we found a faith become an indubitable fact.\nWith this conversation in view the allusion to the promise made me is\none of much interest. When I was sent word by my aunt (Eliza, the one\nalluded to in the first sitting) that father had suddenly come to his old home\nvery ill, I knew that his end was near. I had been expecting such a crisis\nfor months. I immediately sat down and wrote him an affectionate letter.\nI could not conceal from him my belief that his illness meant death. I\nended my letter with the following sentence :\u2014\" I want you to come to\nme after it is all over.\" I had no belief in immortality at the time, though\nI did not disbelieve it. It has usually seemed possible to me, but the\nargument seemed to ine overwhelmingly strong for materialism. Neverthe\nless I knew that there was no way either to prove immortality, or to show\nmore clearly that it could not be proved, than the method of psychical\nresearch ; and though I had never had, and believe I never would have, an\napparition, I was not above Darwin's playing his bassoon to his plants, and\nventured on this suggestion to father as he stood on the brink of the grave,\nso that if it succeeded I could personally record such a coincidence, and if it\ndid not, record that fact. I had no apparition of him, and in fact never\nthought of my request half a dozen times afterward. But it is not a little\ninteresting to find here [see below] the statement that he has been calling\nfor me ever since his death. He replied to my letter on his deathbed, and\nI have it still, the last letter he ever wrote me. I do not remember whether\nhe made in it the promise he here says he made to me. My impression is\nthat he did not, because 1 remember keeping the letter mainly for the reason\nthat it was his last. I shall see, however, what it says when I get access to\nit in New York.\nIt is evident, however, in the conception of the communicator that he\nhas viewed the promise from the standpoint of communication, not\napparition, and that his mind in thinking of the promise reverts to the\nconversation two years before, or thereabouts, when the whole question\n\fXLI.] 327\nAppendix I.\ndiscussed was about the possibility of communication between discarnate\nand incarnate minds. I explained to him what telepathy meant and what\nwas possible if it was true. He saw it, and as at that time I could not accept\nmore than telepathy and was cautious and sceptical about that, I expressed\nvery grave doubts about communication with the dead. Hence there could\nnot be a more pertinent statement, on the part of one who claims to be my\nfather, than the one here made : \" There was a great question of doubt as\nto the possibility of communication, that, if I remember rightly, was the\ngreat question which we talked over.\"\u2014J.

H. : Yes, thank you.)\nMr. H. returns.\n(S. : That H is good.)\nI feel better now, James. I felt very much confused when I first came\nhere. I could not seem to make out why I could not make you hear me at\nfirst. I have been calling for you ever since I left my body. 1 can hear\nbetter and my ideas are clearer than ever before. I would like to hear you\nspeak.\n(S. : Yes, father, free your mind. I shall listen and understand.)\nI will leave nothing undone, but will reach you clearly and talk as we\nused, when I could speak independently of thought.

H.]\nI will try and remember all about it, he says, yet I remember heart and\nhead well.\n[The confusion in the communicator's mind which my question \"Do\nyou know what the trouble was when you passed out?\" created was a\nsurprise to me. When he spoke of his ignorance about the cause of his\ndifficulty of speech, I thought that he was alluding to the difficulties from\nwhich he had suffered for three years before his death, and especially on his\ndeath-bed. But on reading the passage now I see that it refers to the diffi\nculty of communicating his thoughts during the sitting. But thinking that\nhe was referring to his sickness I asked him what the \"trouble\" was with\nwhich he died, using here the spiritistic lingo, as I have done all along\npurposely, and it was a surprise to see the reply, which was natural enough\nwith the context, and, what is quite as striking, characteristic of many of\nhis letters to me whenever any difference of opinion arose. The word\n'. trouble \" was generally used by him to express perplexities and annoyances\nwith others growing out of personal relations with them, and was not used\nby him to express sickness, but only the accidents of sickness when men\ntioned, so that his diversion here is very natural.\nAt the time of the sitting I shook my head and thought that the\ncommunicator was wrong when, in what follows the confusion awakened by\nmy question, the communicator mentioned his stomach and, after ui'ich\nstruggling, his heart, lungs and breathing. The last seemed like it, but\nthe first three did not. I had in mind his throat trouble, catarrh as he\ncalled it, which in reality was probably cancer of the larynx. Hence I\nwanted to see if he would mention what he had thought his sickness was,\nand what he had so often called it. Hence my demurral to its correctness\nwhen I saw the allusion to his stomach, heart and lungs, and the \"conges\ntion.\" But when I came to read the notes over after the sitting it seemed\nclear that the communicator had interpreted my phrase \" when you passed\nout \" as referring to the final crisis, and the whole narrative took on another\nmeaning. I saw that it described exactly the chief incidents that occurred\nduring the last half hour especially, and less strikingly the last hour, of\nhis life. These must be described as fully as possible.\nFor about two months before his death my father had suffered from loss\nof appetite, a thing that had never been characteristic of him, and during\nthese two months he had little satisfaction from eating. During the week\nin which I helped to nurse him, the difficulty from swallowing on the one\nhand and the weakening of digestion on the other led to the necessity for\nartificial feeding, but during the last twenty-four hours of his illness, even\nthis process accomplished nothing. On my inquiry also there was found to\n\fxLi.] Appendix I. 82S)\nbe very little hunger, until on the morning of his death. About seven in\nthis morning he complained of hunger, and on bringing the doctor we were\nable, about eight or half-past eight, to raise him up in bed to give him some\nmilk. But he could drink very little of it, aud with this hunger, which is\nthe frequent messenger of death, he threw himself back upon the pillow with\nthe remark: ''It is too late.\" His pulse still showed a reasonably good\ncondition. He had himself, all through his illness, watched his pulse, and\neven during the spasms of the larynx, when we thought he would perish,\nthere seemed to be no diminution of the heart action such as would be\nexpected as death approached. This kept up well until about half an hour\nbefore death, which occurred about ten o'clock in the morning. I noticed a\ngradual weakening of the pulse and the speech until he could not move his\nhand or any part of his body. In the early stages of this oncoming weakness\nwhen I undertook to feel the pulse, he several times rather petulantly shook\nhis arm as if to prevent my effort, a thing he had never done before,\nbut rather exhibited, or even manifested on his own part, a desire to\nfeel his pulse or to have it felt. But in this weakening condition he\nalso reached out his hand for that of his wife, and, being utterly unable\nto speak, could only press it in token of farewell. Soon the breathing\nbecame shorter and shorter, and there seemed to be the most tremendous\nand agonising efforts to take a full breath. The doctor had told me\nthat this shortening of the breath during the spasms was due to con\ngestion, caused by the attack of the spasm, and he also intimated that it\nmight at any time terminate his life. Finally the pulse became too weak to\nbe noticed, the breathing too short to supply air, and the eyes assumed the\nfixed gaze of death, and one last effort was made to obtain a breath, the\neyes closed, and I remarked, \" He's gone.\" Then the lower jaw fell, and the\ncrisis was passed. He had complained during the last period of the illness,\nespecially during some of the last hours, of great pain in the head, but this\nwas not limited to the crisis which I have just described. The whole\nnarrative which this explains, and which claims to be from my father,\npursues this description quite closely as any one can see.\nThe incident about the trouble with the eyes I cannot confirm, but may\nbe able to do so from my mother, if it be true. It is also my impression\nthat the doctor had remarked by the bedside that there was congestion in\nthe lungs when any extreme difficulty occurred with the breathing. The\nconformity of the narrative, however, to the facts known to me is quite\nevident and remarkable.\u2014J. H. H.] [Cf. Note 10, p. 350].\n[The following letter was received to-day and confirms the statement\nwhich I have made above, that I thought congestion in the lungs had been\nmentioned to father or within his hearing.\nXenia, Ohio.\nMv Dear Mr. Hvsi.op, \u2014Father has been ill with La Grippe since\nSunday, and though able to be down stairs now, still feels weak.

I have not asked many questions, nor reminded you of any important\nfacts, because doing so would be interpreted here on earth as suggesting the\nanswers themselves.)\nAh, yes ; I remember the difficulties. [Cf. p. 341, and Note 24,\np. 365.]\n(Hence I have wished to let you tell your own story, so that I could go\nbefore the world and prove more clearly the great truth which we have at\nheart. You know it is the work of Christ, and you will remember that I\nalways said that I wished to live the life of Christ, even if I was not a\nbeliever.)\nPerfectly. Yes. That is surely James.\n(To meet you, then, in this way, and to feel that you will farther help\nme give mankind the great truth of immortal life)\nWith God's help I will, my boy.\n(is an inspiration which you can well understand.

These will be sent to me and I can verify them and put them\non record. You will then do a good work on your side that will help me\nwith Christ's work on this side.)\n[This passage was prepared beforehand with a distinct purpose. I\nresolved to test 6rst the memory of the communicator and second his\nreligious attitude. We had carried on a long correspondence in regard to\nmy apostasy from my early teaching, and he knew in life that I had taken\njust the attitude here indicated. Moreover I had concealed my own name\nand personal identity so thoroughly and avoided in all cases (unless we\nexcept the mention of my Aunt Nannie to my sister) everything like the\nsuggestion of names or events that would lead to identification, that I was\ncurious to see what the response would be. It is certainly very striking, and\nnot less so for its apparent memory of our past relations, on the one hand,\nand for the manner in which the recognition takes place. Here the state\nment, \"Perfectly, yes, that is surely James,\" is not made to me, but to\nRector, and owing to the nature of the machine it slips through to me, so\nto speak.\u2014J. H.

H. : Yes, that's an interesting word again.)\n[I refer in this remark to what seems a departure from the spiritistic\nlingo in the communicator's language. Father knew nothing about the\ndoctrine except in the vaguest way. He never came into contact with it,\nnever read any of its literature, and would know nothing of its lingo. But as\nI had frequently noticed in the sittings expressions bearing the stamp of\nacquaintance with its peculiar phraseology about death, I resolved to watch\nz 2\n\f340 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nfor indications of departure from it and adoption of the more natural\nphraseology characteristic of my father in life. I do not know the spiritistic\nlingo myself well enough to say positively that there is a deviation from it\nhere. But a very natural spiritistic phrase here would have been \" since\npassing out,\" instead of \"since entering this life.\" Hence in this case and\nin one other in which the term \"change\" was used to express the same\nidea, I wondered whether there was not a departure from the ordinary\nspiritistic lingo. \u2014J.

I understand.)\n[January 13th, 1900.\u2014A phrase in the above sentence recalls a passage\nwhich I read at Mrs. Piper's trance on February 9th, 1897. It occurred in\na letter written at my request by a personal friend of Stainton Moses, with\nthe view of helping the latter in his communications. The passage is : \"I\nwrite this letter because it seems possible that we may thus meet across the\nbarrier, my pull perhaps helping your push. \" See also the phrase used at\nthe sitting of June 6th, 1899 (p. 474), \" pulling with my push,\" and note\nthe remark made by Mrs. Piper's \"subliminal\" on June 3rd, 1899 (p. 457),\n\"Stainton Moses helping Hyslop.\"\u2014R.

If anyone had asked me whether father had ever known any\nthing about Swedenborg, I should have answered No with a great deal of\nconfidence. It is possible that in the conversation with him, to which I\nhave referred, some discussion of Swedenborg may have occurred, and I\nhave an impression that it did.

(S. : It is just like him.) right.\n[My remark here was based on the original reading of the word \"one\" for\n\" son.\" The note, therefore, which followed at the time explaining its fitness\nhas been expunged. The statement, however, under the latter has as much\npertinence as ever, though its reference is not to myself and though it be\nnon-evidential as before. It is applicable to both my aunt Nannie and my\nstepmother, but much more specifically to the latter. There is some\nuncertainty as to which is meant in the passage. But there are several facts\nwhich suggest a preference for my stepmother. (1) The word \"sister\" used\njust previously would apply equally to my sister who had not been\nmentioned, especially if we suppose that father had failed to express all\nthat he tried to say, especially also if we suppose that \"Nan,\" which is\nimmediately changed to \"Mannie,\" is an attempt to say \" Maggie. \" (2)\nThe name \" Mannie \" is as much an approximation to \" Maggie,\" that of my\nstepmother, as to that of my aunt Nannie (Cf. p. 343). The specific\ndiscrimination of my aunt Eliza's sorrow in the same passage (see below), as\nif not recognising the revelancy of the allusion to the other person in mind,\nis particularly pertinent in three respects, on the interpretation that the\n\" Mannie \" refers to my stepmother. First there is the specific selection of\n\" Eliza in her sorrow,\" as if she were not included with the other in mind.\nSecond, the discrimination is in agreement with facts suggesting a reason for\nit (Cf. p. 363). Third, the previous reference to this aunt's sorrow (p. 316)\nwas appropriately connected with the recognition of the same grief in my\naunt Nannie Hence the preponderance of psychological evidence is here in\nfavour of the reference to my stepmother (May 20th, 1900).\u2014.J.

I will tell you, friend, all about it after James is\nhas [superposed on the is as if to take its place] gone. (R. H. : Very good.\n\fAppendix I. 343\nI shall be pleased.)

H. H.\nAdditional Notes on Sittings of December 23rd, 2\\th, 2Qth, 27th, 1898.\n(Note 1.)\nNew York, April 26tt, 1899.\nApropos of the statements made at the beginning of the present report\nregarding the precautions taken fur secrecy and the extent to which they\nwere fulfilled, the following incidents are of some importance, at least to the\nwould-be critic, in the case. The precautions were designed to shut out\nabsolutely everybody from a knowledge of my intentions except Dr. Hodgson\nand myself. As a matter of fact this was effected, though there was one\nlittle mishap that might have led to discovery and mistake in the realisation\nof this purpose. I had carrried on my correspondence regarding the sittings\ndirectly with Dr. Hodgson at his residential address, and not at the office,\nso as to exclude all knowledge of my purpose from the Assistant-Secretary\nof the Branch, Miss Edmunds. This I did not at all feel necessary, but only\nwanted to be able to say that it was a fact in order to satisfy the naturally\nscrupulous and cautious scientist. But after getting the promise of sittings\nat some future date I wrote a short letter to Dr. Hodgson, and from mere\nhabit, after actually looking up Dr. Hodgson's house address, made the\nmistake of writing the office address, and the letter was opened by Miss\nEdmunds, as she usually opened the official mail. I had been careful to cut\noff all headlines that might lead to my immediate identification by any one\nnot in the office and who did not know me either by name or personally.\nMy signature was attached to the letter. The letter was sent to Dr.\nHodgson apparently without reading it though after opening. The following\nis an exact copy of the letter without the omission of a word or sign.\nNovember 13th, 1898.\nMv dear Hodgson,\u2014I have not been at the college since Friday, and do\nnot know what mail will be awaiting me there when I go down to-morrow.\nBut I do not wait to ascertain this until I write asking that you tell me by\nreturn mail, if you have not already written me, whether I am to have the\n\fXLI.] 345\nAppendix I.\nsittings for the dates mentioned some time ago. I wish to make final\narrangements for the trip. You will have to tell me when and where to\nmeet you\u2014Yours as ever, J R Hvsi.oi,\nIt had been intended originally to have the sittings earlier than the date\nactually fixed on at last. But as soon as Dr. Hodgson received the above\nnote he returned it with his reply, calling my attention to my mistake.\nNevertheless I withheld more carefully than ever all further intimation of\nmy intentions, and when I went on to Boston during the holidays for the\nsittings and was taken to the office, before introducing me to Miss Edmunds,\nwith whom I had frequently corresponded in his absence, but whom I had\nnever met, I said to Dr. Hodgson that I was not acquainted with Miss\nEdmunds, but that she probably knew my intentions from that mistake in\nmy letter. But he decided with my advice nevertheless to introduce mo to\nher under his regular pseudonym, Mr. Smith, and did so with the jovial\nremark, \"Another Mr. Smith,\" and added : \"Perhaps you know him, Miss\nEdmunds.\" She replied that she did not, and I reservedly added that 1\nhad never met her. She then spoke up : \" Oh, is this Professor Hyslop ? \"\nAs the cat was out of the bag I said : \" Yos, but I intended to keep the fact\na secret, but as you saw my letter referring to my intentions I may as well\nconfess.\" \" No,\" she said, \" I did not see any letter, but as we were going\nover the copy in the office this morning it flashed over my mind that the\nstranger called \"the four times friend\" was Professor Hyslop, but I did\nnot remark the fact to Miss S (assistant) until about an hour ago. But\nit was only a guess, as I did not know you were going to have sittings. I\nsimply remarked to her that I wondered why Professor Hyslop would not\nlike to have some sittings, as he is interested in them.\" But as my letter\nhad been opened by Miss Edmunds in pursuance of her custom, I deemed it\nbest to have her statement regarding her knowledge of my sittings to be put\non record with my report. I therefore wrote her to explain her relation\nto the question, and to state what she knew of my intentions. The following\nis her reply :\u2014\n5, Boylston Place, Boston, Mass., January X2th, 1899.\nDear Professor Hvsi.op,\u2014I can give no distinct reason why I guessed\nthat you were \" The Four Days Friend,\" as I certainly had not reasoned it\nout, but thought that I had guessed it from reading allusions in the sittings\nto \" The Four Days Friend.\"\nOn first reading your letter of January 8th, I remembered nothing of the\nletter you refer to, but on talking it over with Dr. Hodgson, I dimly\nremember opening a letter from you addressed to Dr. Hodgson, some time\nago, which I thought might contain something I could attend to, Dr. Hodg\nson being busy, and not often at the office. Since his return from England\nI have, in fact, opened most letters, but I usually put aside yours, Dr.\nNewbold's, and those from any one whom I know to be a personal friend.\nThis special letter has, however, made so little impression on me that it\nis quite likely I did not read it, but simply glanced at it hurriedly, and put\nit aside as something that I could not answer or help in. What my \"subli\nminal \" may have caught from that hasty glance, I cannot now, of course,\n\f\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D. [I'ART\naccount for. Soon after the return of Dr. Hodgson I remember your send\ning one or more letters addressed to him containing references to cases such\nas Mrs. D., about which he did not know, and this probably accounted for\nmy opening that letter. Also when he first returned, I opened more letters\nthan I do now because he was away from Boston for the first two months,\nand this special letter I simply left in his desk (or else forwarded it to Bar\nHarbour, I do not know which) and he has made no remark about it until\nnow, when I showed him your letter of the 8th inst.\nAnother unconscious factor leading to the guess may have been that\nwhen you wrote me during the summer to engage sittings \" for a friend,\" I\nthought it not unlikely that the \"friend \" was yourself ; but I did not men\ntion this to any one and thought no more of it.\nI mentioned to no one outside the office my \"guess\" of \" The Four\nDays Friend,\" but on the day of your arrival, and just before you came in\nwith Dr. Hodgson, I remarked to Miss S , our stenographer, \" I guess\n'The Four Days Friend ' to be Professor Hyslop.\" Less than an hour after\nthis you entered, and you will remember that, before guessing you to be\nProfessor Hyslop, I asked whether you were \" The Four Days Friend,\" and\nwas told \"yes.\" \"Then,\" I said, \" it is Professor Hyslop.\"\nAs I knew Miss S. would copy the sittings and would be sure to over\nhear something, and would know that you were in Boston, I thought it\nwould do no harm to mention my guess to her. She also remembers my once\nremarking to Miss [Printer's mistake for Dr.] Hodgson, \" I should think\nProfessor Hyslop would want sittings,\" and Dr. Hodgson was absolutely\nindifferent about it. He has, in fact, given no hint.\nSince your Forum and Independent articles, it seemed in the natural\norder of things that you should want some sittings.\nAll this may not be very clear, but it is absolutely all I can think of to\nthe minutest detail, and it is needless to say that I have used gxess in the\npurely English sense of the word.\u2014Yours sincerely,\nLucv Edmunds.\n(Note 2.)\nNew York, January 15th, 1899.\nIt is important to mention for the benefit of the reader that the intro\nductory remarks and notes about the incidents at the close of the sittings\nwhen Mrs. Piper was coming out of thu trance were written immediately\nafter the sittings while they were perfectly clear to memory. Indeed in\nmost cases full notes were taken at the time, and had only to be sup\nplemented by additional incidents from memory. I postponed absolutely\nnothing but the interpretation of the messages any longer than was possible,\nso that no intervening duties and thoughts occurred to disturb the accuracy\nof the account as it stands. Some of the notes in regard to the truth or\nfalsity of the facts were written after my return to New York, but I was\nexceedingly careful not to wait until so late a time to write anything that\ninvolved a memory, for more than five or six hours, of incidents at the\nsittings. The record shows a complete account of everything said or\nwritten at the sitting except my observations of incidents in regard to the\n\fXLI.] 347\nAppendix I.\ntrance, which were written down from copious notes and memory\nimmediately after returning to Boston, including as I have said, what Mrs.\nPiper said as she came out of the trance. This account will therefore be\nfound accurate and full, and without any defects that might otherwise mar\nthe impression to be made by the record. Nothing is omitted which the\ncritic might desire to know.\u2014J. H. H.\n(Note 3.)\nNew York, January 15th, 1899.\nYesterday I took the manuscript copies of my sittings to one of the aunts\nwho were mentioned in the sittings by my father. Her prejudices are all\nagainst this sort of work, and she has always warned me away from\nspiritualism, so that I did not expect to receive any favourable attention.\nI was surprised when I had read the accounts over to her to find that they\nimpressed her so strongly that she admitted at once and without indication\nof my own attitude toward them the force of the claim for their spiritistic\ncharacter. She remarked, however, in a somewhat reluctant way, too, that\nshe did not wish to commit herself in writing to that view, though she was\napparently willing to hold it personally. The thought was that I was\ndesiring to have this conclusion supported by her opinion of the incidents-\nBut I explained that I wished only to have her impressions as to the\npertinence of the facts to such a supposition and her corroboration of the\npersonal and characteristic features of the communicator purporting to be\nmy father. These were accorded with frankness, and some light was thrown\nby her upon some incidents of which I knew nothing and some which, if I\never knew them, were wholly forgotten. But her recognition of the\nvrainemblance to my father was distinct and emphatic, much more so than I\nhad expected, considering the strong prejudices which she had and has\nalways had against spiritualism. I expected a perfectly deaf ear to the\nwhole subject, and such an attitude of contempt as would somewhat throw\ndiscredit upon my judgment on this point, and so was prepared for a\nsetback. I was therefore agreeably disappointed in this result. As an\nindication of the real impression upon her mind, I may narrate the following\ninteresting incident in which her conviction was unconsciously betrayed with\nsome force. After my remark that I did not expect her to commit herself\nto the spiritistic view, I said that there was a loophole for getting out of it,\nand mentioned the telepathic hypothesis, which I explained, and of which\nshe had known something from past conversations when I had rejected the\nspiritistic theory on the ground of telepathy. For a moment she under\nstood that I was advancing that theory here to explain the spiritistic\nview away, and she showed some mental resistance to this procedure.\nBut when I remarked that I did not accept the ability of the telepathic\ntheory to explain away the spiritistic theory, except on the assumpti n\nof such gigantic suppositions that it would strain any credulity to believe,\nshe showed a decided welcome to my position, and expressed voluntarily\nher preference for the idea of communication with departed spirits. I\nwas amazed at the readiness to accept such a position after the smiles\n\fJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D. [part\nand half sneers of the past when I had tolerated that theory as a possible\nalternative to telepathy, and more especially after the repeated warnings\ngiven me in regard to spiritualism.\nFrom her I received also some corroboration of important incidents and,\nin addition to this, facts which indicate that significance attaches to certain\nstatements in the sittings which I had thought were a part of the automatism\nthat awakens suspicion of the whole thing. I shall explain this matter on\na separate sheet.\u2014J. H. H.\nMay 24th, 1899.\nP.S.\u2014In the sitting of December 26th there is a curious fact upon which\nI did not comment when I wrote the above, but I had my attention called to\nit yesterday when reading my report over. The phrase is \" Give my love\nand tell (?) sister Annie tells her . . . Anna not Anna but Annie. I\nam your sister.\" Now I learned from my Aunt Nannie in Philadelphia\nwhen I read the account to her that my sister was christened Anna, not\nAnnie, and that my mother always insisted on calling her Anna, and corrected\nit when pronounced Annie by any one. This fact was spontaneously\nmentioned to me by my aunt. I have no conscious recollection either of my\nmother's interest in this matter or whether we were in the habit of calling\nher Anna rather than Annie. \u2014J. H. H.\n(Note 4.)\nNow York, January loth, 1899.\nThere are four different phrases in the record which struck my aunt on\nreading it as quite characteristic of my father. Many other statements were\nrecognised as characteristic of him in sentiment, but these four phrases were\nidentified as such and without reference to sentiment. The first of these is\nthe phrase, \" Well, I was not so far wrong after all,\" which occurred in the\nsecond sitting while referring to my conversation with my father on the\nsubject of psychical research. The next instance is the phrase \"own\nideas \" used in the second sitting in reference to the same fact. This\ninstance has less significance than the former, because it is less individual,\nthough it represents the choice of expression which my father would make\nwhen others might take \"opinions\" in preference. The third illustration\nis the biblical quotation, \"What is their loss is our gain,\" in the second\nsitting. Even the plural pronoun is pertinent here. My aunt confirms my\nimpression that the phrase was characteristic of father. This might be true\nof many others at the same time, but it was so characteristic of him and his\nintimate family relations in just such connections as are indicated here that\nthe phrase is striking. The same can be said of the phrase \" Seek and you\nshall find \" in the third sitting, just after promising to do all he could to\nsatisfy my object in these sittings and just as the sitting was coming to a\nclose. This makes a fifth, and I might add a sixth, \"Tell them to believe\nand trust in God always \" near the close of the fourth sitting when asking\nme to be remembered apparently to his sisters, but probably to the sister\nnamed, Eliza, and my stepmother. This instance my aunt recognised\nas extraordinarily characteristic, both for its pertinence and for its\n\fXL!.] 349\nAppendix I.\nresemblance to father's habit in circumstances such as are indicated here.\nBoth aunts had recently lost their husbands, and though only one of them\nis distinctly alluded to, and this not the husband of the one who recognises\nthe characteristic nature of the phrase, the expression and the situation\nwere just what father would appropriate in this manner, and my aunt\nattests that this was father's mode of speech or writing in such situations.\nI remember the same myself as frequent enough, but after my scepticism it\nwas not so often that it was used to me.\nBut the instance of most interest is the one which I intended to regard as\nthe fourth, and of which I knew nothing as characteristic of father until my\naunt indicated the fact. It is the phrase, \"And the least said the sooner\nmended,\" in the fourth sitting when referring to affairs connected with my\nbrother. The history of the expression is as follows. My aunt says that the\nphrase was a constant one with her father, and that he taught it to his wife,\nwho did not use it at first, and that it became a family expression to mean\nthat certain things had not better be talked about too freely, because they\nmight give trouble, especially in matters that were in danger of becoming\ngossip. I myself never used the phrase, and it struck me as so odd here that\nI did not see its meaning at all in this connection, and hence did not catch\nits pertinence until its characteristic nature was remarked by my aunt. In\nthis light and with her statement regarding the use of the expression in their\nfamily I see a remarkable pertinence in its use here when referring to the\nfriction with my brother. It also throws light upon the expression a little\nlater (p. 337) which Dr. Hodgson thought a mistake, namely, \" for him,\"\nwhich, if it meant Imperator, ought to have been spelled with capitals as is\nusual. But evidently it refers to my brother. But, aside from this reference\nand pertinent allusion, the most important thing under consideration at\npresent is the characteristic nature of the expression and its history\nbeyond my knowledge at the time. I cannot recall ever hearing father\nuse it. It is possible that I have heard its use by him, but I am certain\nthat I have not heard it frequently enough to think it characteristic of him.\nThis judgment is borne out by the unintelligible nature of the expression\nuntil explained to me by my aunt.\u2014J. H. H.\n(Note 5.)\nNew York, January loth, 1899.\nThere are some incidents in the sittings that have taken on a meaning\nwhich they could not have at the time owing to my ignorance of the facts\nnecessary to understand them. These facts I found out from my aunt when\nI showed her the record.\nIn the first sitting the first name announced was Margaret, which, as I said\nat the time, I thought was the name of my oldest sister. This I find is\ncorrect. I do not recollect her, as she died when I was only two years old.\nIn connection with her name was mentioned \" Lillie,\" which had no mean\ning for me. This could possibly be taken as an attempt to give the name of\nmy twin sister, whom I do not remember and who died when two years\nold. [I have since ascertained that this twin sister was only four months\n\f350 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nold when she died]. Her name was Sarah Luella. I could not and should\nnot put this possible interpretation upon it were it not for what my sister\nAnnie said in the third sitting when she came in to ask about the lock of\nhair and pictures. The record (p. 331) shows the question \" Do you know\nwho Sarah is . . . Annie.\" This \"Sarah\" had no meaning for me\nwhatever, and I thought it a part of the nonsense which is so common with\nmediumistic phenomena, until the correctness of the name was indicated by\nmy aunt, who said that this was the name of my twin sister. The whole\npassage becomes perfectly intelligible with the supposition that this sister\nis meant. I now wonder whether this same person was meant in the first\nsitting when my brother Charles referred to \"one who is nearer to you than\nall the rest of us,\" and which had no meaning to me then.\nIn this same passage previously my brother Charles had said that he\nhad suffered from typhoid fever. This, as I recorded at the time, was\nfalse, and I thought that the same verdict should be passed upon the state\nment of the trouble with the throat, and that it had taken him \"over here.\"\nBut I find from my aunt that he suffered with a very putrid sore throat\nwhile he had the scarlet fever, and that he was sick only four days. There\nis no one living that could say anything more about the expression, \"because\nthe membrane formed in my throat.\" The phrase is pertinent, however,\nand probably states a fact, as the scarlet fever was of a very malignant\nform. There is no one also to attest the relevancy of the reference to the\ntrouble with his head. This might be true of any sickness. I have a very\nfaint recollection of the sore throat, and none at all of the length of his\nsickness.\nIn the first sitting also there was an apparent reference to the name\n' ' Corrie \" which I could not read, and when it occurred to me that ' ' Mary \"\nwas meant I asked if this was the name. The answer was in the affirmative\nand added that she was my father's sister. I knew nothing about this and\nsupposed that it had no pertinence. But I have found from my aunt that\nher oldest sister's name was Mary. I had never heard her called this,\nand, in fact, she died before I knew her. I had always heard her called\nAmanda. Her name was Mary Amanda. The reference to \" Elizabeth \"\nalso had no meaning to me at the sitting, but I learned from my aunt that\nmy mother had a sister by the name of Eliza, who died when my mother\nwas very young. There is only the specification of the relationship here to\nindicate the possibility in the name. Perhaps, also, the \"Corrie\" men\ntioned was an attempt to give the name of my aunt Cornelia, also my\nmother's sister still living, and whom we always called aunt Cora. See\nsitting of June 1st (p. 452), whore a closer approach to the name is made.\n\u2014J. H. H.\n(Note 6.)\nNew York, March 26th, 1899.\nI sent the manuscript of my first four sittings to bo read by my step\nmother and brother with the request that they make any comments they\ndesired, confirmatory or derogatory of the facts presented in the record.\nMy first letter was misunderstood by my stepmother, she thinking that I\nhad asked for an expression of opinion as to the genuineness of the case\n\fXLI.] 351\nAppendix I.\nand its spiritistic character, though I was careful to say that I wanted\nnothing but a statement as to what was and what was not fact in the record.\nIn her reply, after answering some questions that pertain to later sittings,\nshe wrote as follows: \"As to making any comments, it is too mystical.\nThere are some striking things, but I cannot help thinking that there is\nfraud in it. I do not want to comment on anything that I know so little\nabout. I will give you all the information I can, but many things in the\nsittings seem like guess-work. One thing I know is this : Your father's\naffection for you always remained firm. One of his marks of affection was\nto reprove when he thought one went astray. As he grew older and more\nhelpless he seemed to rely on you more than on any of the other children.\nI hope your mind will become clear on the important subject you are\ninvestigating.\"\nI wrote in reply to this that I did not wish any expression of opinion on\nthe merits of the work, and that I regarded a severely sceptical attitude of\nmind the proper one to take regarding the explanation of the case, but that\nmy object was mainly to have the facts confirmed or denied. I further\nadvised her not at any time to form opinions as to explanations, but to\ncritically scrutinise the alleged facts, and say what she could for or against\nthem simply as facts. The following is the response to this.\nBloomington, Ind., March 23rd, 1899.\nMv dear James,\u2014In going over the report again I can corroborate most\nof your comments. On page 313 of December 24th, the recognition of\nyour presence seems quite natural, and on page 318 \"I was not so far\nwrong after all \" is his language. December 26th, on page 325, there\nis language that sounds like his, \"That, if I remember rightly, was the\none great question which we talked over.\"\nAnother expression on page 333, \" Only trust in all that is good, James,\nand be contented, etc.\" But most of the language has very little meaning\nthat I can see. Frank has made comments more fully\u2014so I will just\ncorroborate yours.\u2014Affectionately, Mothbr\nMy brother, whose education qualified him to speak with more intelli\ngence of the case, especially as he had read two of the reports on it, wrote\nme at first, in reply to my request, that he would wait for a better under\nstanding of what was wanted, and this was explained as indicated above.\nBut he commented in advance as follows. It must be remembered that I\ndid not explain to him anything about the sittings or the persons supposed\nto be represented in them. Hence the pertinence of his interpretation of the\nincidents will be evident at a glance. \" In the sitting of December 24th,\npages 315 and 318, \" he says, \" is it supposed to be father or uncle James\nCarruthers who is talking 1 I do not see that I can make any comments of\nany material value. You remember I left Delphi in the August of the year\nprevious to father's death. So I did not see him for almost a year, so that\nthe larger part of the things spoken of I know nothing about. Some of the\nexpressions, as for example in the sitting of December 24th, page 315, ' I\nwould not return for . . . music, flowers, drives, etc.,' do not seem like\nwhat father would use. I need not point out others, for you will recognise\n\f352 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthem as readily as I. I have read the reports all carefully and do not find any\nstatements that I know to be false other than those you have marked as such.\"\nIn reply to my explanation that I wanted only such confirmation or\ndenial of facts as suggested themselves to him, my brother answers as\nfollows :\u2014\nBloomington, Ind., March 22nd, 1899.\nMv dear Brother James,\u2014In regard to the first sitting I do not think\nit worth while to make any particular comments. In the other sittings many\nof the expressions used are very like those that father used in his conversa\ntion and correspondence, while others seem very unnatural for him to use.\nIn the sitting of December 24th, the narrative on pages 313 and 314 is\nall very natural to father in tone and expression. When starting to meet\nsome one at the door or yard gate he would often say : \" Give me my hat \"\n(page 313). From page 314 to 316 it is more like uncle James Carruthers\nthan father.\nI do not remember father to have used the expression \"the girls\" in\nspeaking of his sisters, as on page 316. \"What is their loss?\" etc. was\na common expression of father's. Page 317 is very natural, especially the\nexpression \"stick to this\" ; and page 318, \"My toy, I remember, \"etc. ;\npage 318, \" you had your own ideas \" ; page 320, \" Everything in life,\" etc.\nI have known father more than once to express to mo and others his\npride in your attainments, and at the same time deprecate your scepticism.\nPage 321, '' I know well,\" etc., is very natural.\nIn the sitting for December 26th there is nothing that calls for comment\nother than what you have made until we reach page 332. Here the\nexpression \" Now out with it, James \" is very natural to father. But the\nfollowing, \"Do you hear her sing? \"l seems strange for him. On page 333,\n\"It does not pay \" was his common expression ; page 333, \" will one day be\nreunited with us and we shall meet face to face \" is father's form of\nexpression for this thought. Page 334, \"Seek and ye shall find \"was\na frequent expression of his.\nIn the sitting of December 27th, page 335, \"There shall be no veil,\netc.,\" is natural to father. Page 336\u2014Father had a little brown handled\nknife, but I did not know him to carry it in his vest or coat pocket.\nHe had a cap which he wore for a nightcap perhaps two or three times.\nPage 336, \"James, let me see some of my trifles. They can do no\nharm,\" etc., does not seem natural.i The narrative on pages 3j7, 338, 339,\n340 is very natural in tone and expression. Page 341 \u2014Father did not\ncommonly refer to any part of the house as \"the library.\" Page 341\nseems foreign in language and thought. Page 342 is very lifelike,\nespecially the advice to \"trust in God always.\" Page 343, \"If you will do\n\u2014all will be as I would have it,\" is his form of expression.\nThe expressions to which I have directed attention, with the exceptions\nnoted, are very like what father commonly used in his conversation and\ncorrespondence.\u2014Yours as ever, Frank E. Hvsi.op.\ni The statement about the singing and the request for trifles my brother does not\nunderstand, and it is not surprising that they seem unnatural. The second is a\nrequest for some article to be given the medium, and the first is one of the automatisms\nwhich are quite frequent in these sittings.\u2014J. H. H.\n\fXLI.] 353\nAppendix I.\n(Note 7.)\nNew York, April 17th, 1899.\nThe following notes represent the results of my later inquiries as well as\nsome of the earlier ones which have not yet been worked up. I made my\ninquiries at once after the sittings and preserved the replies which are now\nsummarised and recorded. The inquiries were made without telling the\nparties what my experiments had been, though they were surmised from the\nnature of my questions. But I carefully concealed the nature of the\nincidents which I wished to have corroborated or denied. This was especially\nthe case with the incident about the brown handled knife which was\ncorroborated in regard to its separate details and without the slightest hint\nregarding the facts stated in the sittings.\nThe first incident relates to the communication that evidently purports\nto come from an uncle of mine that had died after I made arrangements for\nmy sittings. While making the notes to the second sitting and whilst in\nBoston I wrote to my aunt the following letter apropos of the reference to\nmy uncle by Mrs. Piper. This was before the third sitting was held.\nBoston, Mass., December 24th, 1898.\nMv dear Aunt,\u2014Did you see Uncle James C recently in your\nsleep ? Or did you dream of seeing him ? Write to me at once in New\nYork.\u2014Yours as ever,\nJ. H. Hvsi.op.\nThe following was the reply I received, omitting those parts which are\nadvice to me to abstain from the investigation which my aunt had surmised\nI was engaged in.\nXenia, Ohio, December 27th, 1898.\nMv dear Nephew,\u2014Yours received this morning and in answer will say,\nI have neither seen him in my sleep nor dreamed of seeing him, but really I\ncannot see the difference. It is said those whom you think the most about\nyou do not dream of them. I have never but once dreamed of your father\nand I am sure I have thought of him often, and your uncle James is seldom\nirom my mind in my waking hours.\nI send you this, not knowing why you need it. I have no faith in\nspiritualism, but the guidance of the Holy Spirit is what I seek . . . ,\u2014\nSingly. E. A. C\nThis letter I received on the morning of the 28th, and on the same\nmorning I wrote the following second inquiry :\u2014\n519, West 149th Street, New York, December 28th, 1898.\nMv dear Aunt.\u2014Please to answer the following question at once : Did\nUncle C and you have walks, drives and book-reading together, which\nyou used to enjoy with each other, and did he enjoy music greatly ?\u2014Yours\na8 ever> J. H. Hvsi.op.\nThe following was the answer to this inquiry, but not dated. It is post\nmarked, however, \" Xenia, Ohio, Dec. 30, 3.30 p.m., *98,\" and received by\nme on the 31st.\n2 A\n\f354 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nMv drar James.\u2014We did have many walks, drives and book-reading\ntogether, particularly the Sabbath-school lessons. He enjoyed music, but\ncould not sing. He always sang at worship and when I would be up he\nwould be down. Yet he enjoyed music from others. \u2014Lovingly,\nE. A. C\nThis latter in the main corroborates the incidents for which inquiry was\nmade, though they may not have the weight desirableinthecase. Knowing\nmy uncle and his life as I did I myself must attach some value to them.\nThe incidents mentioned are not so common in family life in the region\nwhere he lived, however common they might be for mankind at large, and\nappear to be specific matters of taste and habit in the actual life of the\nalleged communicator. I was absolutely ignorant of them. I knew that my\nuncle had a piano in his house and that his daughter played on it, but I\nwould never have supposed that he was fond of music, as I never heard the\ninstrument played in his home more than a few times. I might have sur\nmised that he liked music, but I would not have guessed that he was in the\nhabit of taking drives, walks, and engaging in book-reading with my aunt as\na special pleasure. His life was a comparatively busy one in a small country\ntown.\nWhen I began to write these notes on April 9th I soon observed that the\npassage that I had interpreted as from my uncle might be partly a message\nfrom my father. I was struck first with the statement of my aunt that she\nhad seen father in her dream, and this without any inquiry from me to know\nwhether she had or not. I re-read the whole passage carefully which had\nalways puzzled me on account of its apparent origin from my father in so far\nas the continuity of the messages was concerned, but also seemed to represent\nat a sudden sUge of the communications the incidents in the life of my uncle\nwhich did not characterise my father's habits. That is to say, I could never\nassure myself whether the narrative applied wholly to my uncle or partly to\nmy father and partly to my uncle. The first person is used in both cases,\nso that it would seem we should make it all hang together. The interesting\nfact creating a suspicion of this procedure is that my father also died in the\nsame house, so that some of the language that would otherwise be un\ndoubtedly interpreted as referring only to my uncle could also apply to my\nfather. For example, the reference to leaving my aunt. But there is no\nspecial reason for this statement on the part of my father, except an\nautomatism, as it would be so natural for my uncle to say this in reference\nto his wife. The two things in favour of its being my father are (1) the fact\nthat the alleged communicator was my father up to the mention of my\naunt's name (Eliza), and there was no hint of a change of communicator, (2)\nthe traces of automatism just after the mention of my aunt's having seen\nthe communicator in sleep. A change of communicator often takes place at\nsuch times, and there was here time to have another take the place of the\nperson thus swooning. The only external fact favoring this interpretation\nis that my aunt actually saw my father in a dream as here stated of the\ncommunicator, which I found was not true of my uncle. But aside from\nthis actual coincidence and the circumstance of swooning, as we describe it,\nthe whole narrative would also apply to my uncle as well. Nor would the\n\fXLI.] 355\nAppendix J,\nmanner of addressing me by name alter this interpretation, as my uncle\ncalled me always by the same name as did my father here. But I wrote\nnevertheless to my aunt after this second examination of the passages and\nasked her to describe the dream in its details as she could remember it. I\nobtained the following reply to my inquiries.\nXeuia, Ohio, April \\Sth, 1899.\nMv dear James,\u2014Yours received and at your request I proceed to answer\naccording to the best of my ability and memory.\nI saw your father in some strange place at one of the old picnics which\ny..u know he so much enjoyed. I think now it must have been in Delphi, as\nthe place was not familiar to me. He was sitting on a log with a group of\nothers with whom I was not particularly acquainted. I only saw him, did\nnot speak. He had on his hat and seemed to be enjoying himself, as he was\nthe centre of a group. I have not yet dreamed of Mr. C , and I do not\nwant to do so, as the awakening would be dreadful.\u2014Lovingly,\nAunt Ei.iza.\nI had inquired to know when the dream had occurred and have had\nto repeat this inquiry. The answer will be found below. But the\ncoincidence cannot in any case be given any amount of evidential value.\nThe utmost that can be assigned it is the circumstance that the\nambiguity of the passage is such that we cannot say the incident is\nincorrect. It would be incorrect if we assume that the co'imunicator,\nbeginning with the mention of my aunt's name, is my uncle. This view\nobliges us to suppose that there was an unannounced introduction of my\nuncle while my father was supposed to be communicating, and this, of\ncourse, is quite as possible as any other alternative. On the other hand,\nas my father died in my uncle's home, and some of the statements alluding\nto his having left my aunt are applicable to him, assuming that they are\nrather automatisms, we could assume the truth of the dream incident, and\nintroduce my uncle immediately after it, with the remainder of the\nnarrative belonging to him. But I think it is impossible to clear up the\npassage in every respect. The simplest way to give it unity is to sup\npose that the statement regarding what my aunt saw in her sleep is\neither a mediumistic guess or an automatism, and so to treat the general\nincidents as referring to my uncle, whatever hypothesis we adopt to\nexplain them. The following letter, however, explains itself as indicating\nwhen the dream occurred.\nXenia, Ohio, April 17th, 1899.\nMv dear James,\u2014Yours came this morning, and as you are so very\nprompt and so readily accede to my wishes with reference to the northern\nland I will also try to be prompt.\nThe dream about your father was after his death. I cannot state the\nexact time, but I think not long before your uncle's death, as I told him\nhow life-like your father looked. I have not dreamed of him since, neither\nof your uncle D nor of your uncle James. \u2014Yours lovingly,\nA.CST Ei.iza C .\n\f356 [part\n.7. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nThe interesting feature of this last letter is the remark that my \" father\nlooked so life-like.\" This makes the experience resemble those cases of dreams\nand apparitions which are noted as clear and life-like at the time and that\noften turn out suggestive or coincidental. The records show that this feature\noften appears in the cases that are afterward discovered to be apparently\nsignificant, and therefore has its interest. We must not, however, be in\nhaste to attach any such significance to this incident. It is simply to be\nremarked as a fact that comes to the surface without any questions or sug\ngestions from me. It might well be natural to remark this characteristic in\nthe dream from the fact that it was the only dream that my aunt had of my\nfather after his death, and this circumstance might justify either the sus\npicion of an illusion in regard to its special clearness or the supposition that\nit was not clearer than are, perhaps, all dreams. Hence I do not wish to be\ntaken as assuming any importance in the coincidence, but only as remarking\nthe fact, and if any one wishes to give it importance he may do so, though\nany such interpretation must run the gauntlet which even much better\naccredited coincidences have hard work in surviving. It raises a question,\nhowever, which may be answered in further sittings, and it is possible even\nto clear up the doubts involved in the equivocal nature of the whole\nincident.\n(.NoU 8.)\nNew York, April 19th, 1899.\nThe following letter was in response to a request to make the date\nand incidents more specific than the undated and dictated letter already\nrecorded has done (p. 329). It is, moreover, signed by the physician\nhimself, and makes the facts more certain and definite than before. It\nrefers to my conjecture at the time of the sittings that the consciousness of\ncongestion was a fact in the knowledge of my father at the time of his\ndeath.\nXenia, Ohio, January 4th, 1899.\nJ. H. Hysi.op,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014Your letter of the 2nd to hand, and noted.\nIn answer to your question, \" Whether you remember saying to father or in\nhis presence that congestion occurred when he had his spasms and suffered\nfrom difficulty in breathing,\" I would say that I did state to your father\nthat there was congestion (passive) of the lungs when he had his spasms\nand suffered from difficulty in breathing. I also stated the same fact to\nfriends in his presence. \u2014Yours sincerely, J p j)ICE ]yj p\nIt will be apparent from this statement that the fact of congestion was\nin father's knowledge before his death, so that it has a special interest in\nnot being limited to the telepathic hypothesis for explanation.\n(Note 9.)\nNew York, April 9th, 1899.\nConcerning the reference in the third sitting to the promise to come\nto me if possible after death, I find on my investigation into the letter\nreferred to that my impression about its contents was correct. The\n\fXLI.] 357\nAppendix I.\nletter was dictated to my stepmother and written by her. It contains\nabsolutely no promise to communicate with me, but only thanks for my\nsolicitude for his welfare in this evident close of his life. But I wrote to my\nstepmother, who knew the contents of my letter to him, and asked her the\nfollowing question : \" Did father ever say anything about trying to reach me\nor make his continued existence known to me after death ? \" Her answer is :\n\" No, your father never said anything about trying to reach you, or making\nhis continued existence known to you after death.\" Whatever, therefore,\nmay be supposed to have been in his mind or intention, no promise was\nactually made, certainly not to me, and there is no recollection of anything\nlike it by my stepmother. She adds : \" I feel positive that he never thought\nof such a thing.\"\n[I repetted my inquiry personally of my stepmother, taking down her\nstatements at the time, to know if father ever mentioned to her his inten\ntion to try to return to me if possible after death, and she replied as before\nthat he did not. I then asked her if she remembered my request of him\non his death-bed, and she replied that she did very well, and then volun\nteered the further statement that she had asked him what I meant by it.\nHe answered in the sentence : \"Oh, I don't know.\" This, my stepmother\ncontinued, was \"the expression he always used when he did not want to\ntell what was on his mind.\" This fact renders possible the intention which\nis definitely indicated in the promise to return.

H.]\n(Note 10.)\nIn regard to the physical symptoms accompanying his death, I can only\nadd that every one of them is correct except that of the allusion to his eyes\nand the trouble they gave him. This is not known to be false, and all that\nmy stepmother remembers about the incident is that he frequently com\nplained of his eyes as his health failed. But this has no pertinence to\nthe question here at issue in this passage. The allusion to the trouble with\nhis head is much more relevant, but no one knows whether it was specially\ntroublesome during this last half-hour. There were several periods during\nthe latter stage of the illness in which he complained of pain in his\nhead, but as the voice had wholly disappeared during the last twenty-four\nhours of his life, and as I recall no physical indications of suffering in the\nhead, I cannot corroborate any supposition interpreting the reference here\nto such a pain connected with the throes of death. He showed a patience\nin all his suffering that often made it difficult to know just what pains he\nhad unless they appeared to be connected with the spasms of the larynx.\nFor instance, it was long after one of the spells in which there was not the\nslightest reason to expect any revival that he remarked that there was a\npain in his heel, and that he had felt it ever since this attack. It must have\nbeen twenty-four hours afterward, and on examination blisters had been\nformed on the heel. There is much reason to suppose from the complication\nof difficulties that he did suffer from pain in the head. He had had a\nstroke of apoplexy some twency years before, and we found that this critical\nspell was accompanied with some symptoms of neural disturbance that\nmight give rise to trouble in the head.\n\f358 [PART\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\n(Note 11.)\nIn regard to the incident of my sister's lock of hair, I must say that I\nhad some difficulty in assuring myself of the correctness of the fact beyond\nmy own memory. But after correspondence with my sister, stepmother,\nand an aunt in the State of Washington, who was the best witness to the\nfact, I ascertained its truth. But as it can hardly be evidential in any case,\nowing to the frequency of such incidents in the lives of friends, I need not\ndwell upon it farther than to say that it is contained in a wreath made of\nthe hair of all the members of the family, living and dead, at the time of\nmy mother's death in 1869. The most striking part of this communication\nfrom my sister was that which alludes to the photograph, and the relation\nof her death to that of my brother Charles. The phrase \" very young \" is\nspecially interesting, as it implies a distance in time wffich corresponds to\nthat of her death. If she had lived she would now have been thirty-nine\nor forty. We have the pictures of her and Charles yet with their obituary\nnotices, but I have not seen them for some years. The allusion to her\ndemise \"just after Charles\" is quite pertinent. She died just twelve days\nafter him with the same disease. I remember well that on the evening\nafter the burial of my brother, as we sat down to the table, my sister,\nthough without the slightest symptom as yet of illness, and standing\nbetween the door and the table, said to my mother : \" Mamma, I am going\nto get sick and die, too \" This remark always struck my mother as very\nstrange, and as my sister took sick the next day the statement and fulfil\nment of her prophecy have always remained in my memory. Hence this\nallusion to the relation of her death to that of Charles at once appealed to\nme with much force.\nI deliberately referred to iny aunt here by name, because I thought my\nsister would not remember her at all, and the claim that she does may be\ninterpreted as an error, though the cautious \"I think\" may atone for\nthis. Her trying to \" reach us years ago \" is not verifiable.\nThere is also an interesting incident in the spelling of her name. I do\nnot remember whether we called her Anna or Annie. My aunt tells me\nthat her name was Anna Laura. I accepted the name Annie at the sittings\nas correct, and saw only one of the usual slips in the passage where Anna\nwas given and then corrected to Annie. My aunt wanted her called Annie\nLaurie, but my mother would never listen to this and insisted on Anna\nLaura. The confusion of the two at this point is not without its interest in\nthis connection.\n(Note 12.)\nThe attempt to name the medicine here for which I had asked on the pre\nvious day has some interest in connection with some later inquiries made for\nanother purpose. I wrote to the druggist in the town out West for a list of\nthe medicines father had bought for himself, and on the 27th of September,\n1895, he seems to have bought some quinine. Of course I did not buy it\nfor him, and the consideration of the fact cannot havo any significance,\nexcept to note that there is a spontaneous dissent from it when Dr. Hodg\nson asked if that was the medicine meant by the word \"quien\" in the\n\fXLI.] 359\nAppendix I.\nautomatic writing. This shows that the dissent coincides with the incor\nrectness of the supposition that I bought it for him. There is, however, in\nthe case an instance of the occasional automatisms that come at these\nsittings and that are correct so far as they represent incidents in the life of\nthe alleged communicator, but incorrect in their apperceptive bearings,\nthough the correction of this case partly removes objection to it.\n(Note 13.)\nThe reference to a \" diary \" also can have a meaning if we take my step\nmother's statement as indicative of its correctness, and this confirms my\nconjecture at the time of the sitting. I asked her if father ever kept a\ndiary, and her reply is as follows : \" Your father never kept a diary since\nour marriage. His custom has always been to keep a day-book, and note\ndown his receipts and expenditures. You have his two day-books in your\npossession. I have an old one here that dates back of the one you have.\nHe often cut slips out of paper and kept them, but you got them in his old\npocket book along with his other papers.\" On examination of the day\nbook it has many of the features of a diary, certain statements, besides\naccounts, being made in them for recollection.\n(Note 14.)\nThe allusion to the brown handled knife is an incident of considerable\nimportance. I knew that I had no knowledge of such a thing, and the use\nto which it was here said that it was put. I therefore wrote to my step\nmother, brother and sister, to ask about it. I was careful not to tell them\nwhat I had been told at the sittings, as I wished to avoid any suggestions\nof the answer. I did not tell them anything whatever regarding the state\nments made to me at the sittings. It was later that I hinted at the nature\nof my work and object in asking these questions, though it was surmised\nthat I was engaged at these experiments. But without explaining what I\nhad actually done I wrote, addressing the letter to my brother, and asked\nthe following question : \" Did father own ' a little brown-handled knife in\nDelphi that he kept in his vest pocket and then in his coat pocket ? ' I\nwant you, Henrietta, and mother [stepmother] at once to answer this ques\ntion. Please to answer it if you can without questioning each other. Be\nsure to follow instructions, and write me at once.\" The replies which I\nreceived were as follows. My step-mother writes: \"Now in reply to the\ninquiries in Frank's letter I will say your father had a medium sized brown-\nhandled knife which he always carried in his pants pocket. I never\nknew him to carry it in vest or coat pocket. I have his knife now.\" My\nsister writes : \" Papa had a brown-handled knife at Delphi, but it was not a\nsmall one, and I never remember seeing him carry it any place except in his\npants pocket.\" My brother writing in regard to the same fact says :\n\"Father had a pocket-knife about four inches long with a dark cherry\nhandle, and another a little longer with a rough brown bone handle. But\nhe never carried a knife in his vest or coat pocket.\"\n\f300 [PAHT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nI then wrote to my stepmother to have the knife sent nie and it came.\nIt is the brown-handled one with the cherry handle, and is a smaller knife\nthan is usually owned by persons living as my father did. After he left the\nfarm there was no need for a larger knife. The brown bone-handled knife\nwhich my brother mentions is not in existence now, or it cannot be found.\nBut I asked the farther question without suggesting why I wanted it\nanswered, and without telling the facts : \" What did father use that little\nknife with the brown bone handle for V I asked this question from\nmemory, thinking that it was the bone-handled one that was in mind\nand not the smaller. My stepmother answers: \"As to the use of the\npocket-knife, I cannot think of any special purpose he used it for, except\ncutting his finger nails, and he liked to have me trim his toe nails often, as\nhe could not get down to it. He liked to watch little tinkering jobs about\nthe house that needed to be done.\" My brother answers: \"Mother, I\nthink, wrote you that father used the little brown-handled knife for paring\nhis nails, or for general tinkering about the house.\"\nIt will be seen from this that the corroboration of the fact is practically\ncomplete, save the statement about the place of carrying the knife. This\ndiscrepancy might be easily explained, but, as we are dealing with an\nevidential problem, the difficulty, if it be one, must not be slurred over.\nWhatever this may be regarded, the coincidence has some value owing to the\nprecautions taken to prevent the answer from being suggested by my\nquestion.\n(Note 15.)\nSince writing the above note I have inquired more carefully in regard to\nthe cap, because it has been alluded to twice since this sitting, and when I\nwas not present, and what truth there is in it can be ascertained in later\nnotes. [Cf. Note, p. 406.]\n(Note 16.)\nThis incident about the strychnine has an interest which I did not surmise\nat the sitting. I wrote to my stepmother, brother, and sister, asking\n\" whether father had any medicine given him by the doctor about the time\nI sent him the Hyomei, and what it was 1 Was it strychnine ?\" My step\nmother's answer was : \"Your father took medicine from Dr. Smith, of\nDelphi, in the fall and early winter of '95, which I think probably had\nstrychnine in it, almost sure that it had. He only gave the prescription,\nand I judged from that.\" My sister writes: \"He was taking Peruna at\nthe time you sent hiin the Hyomei. I was at home then, and I remember\nof hearing about him taking strychnine at some time or other. I don't know\nwho prescribed it, or just at what time he was taking it.\" My brother writes :\n\"There was probably strychnine in the medicine that father took when\ntreating with Dr. Smith, of Delphi, as a nerve tonic is usually prescribed in\nsuch cases. But he stopped treating with Dr. Smith at least eight or nine\nmonths before you sent him the inhaler.\"\nIt thus appears that he was taking strychnine without my knowledge,\nand this is made especially certain from the fact that it occurred after I had\nseen him in the winter of 1895, for the last time before his fatal illness.\n\fAppendix I. 361\nThe mention of it seems to have been connected with my question about the\nmedicine two days before, which was partly answered in connection with the\nmention of the Hyomei, as the letter \"S\" and the word \"Serris,\" just\nafter the incident of the Hyomei, seem to be the anticipation of the strychnine,\nwhich was interrupted by other incidents. This is a conjecture, however.\nAssuming that it was intended to answer my inquiry the answer must be\nregarded as false, because I did not get him any strychnine. But in spite of\nthis it turns out that he did use it, and if my question was understood to\ninquire for the medicines he took as well as that I got for him it is a very\npertinent answer. At any rate it represents an incident outside my know\nledge, and not acquired by telepathy from me, supposing, of course, that\nwe give it any significance at all. [Cf. Note 23, p. 365.]\n(Note 17.)\nAfter the sitting and my note on the Swedenborg incident was written,\nI sent to my stepmother to make inquiry in regard to its truth, asking\nthe following questions: (1)'-Did father ever talk with you about\nSwedenborg 1\" and (2) \" Do you remember the long conversation we all had\nabout psychical research at the time I was in Indianapolis giving my lecture\non the subject, and do you remember whether father said anything about\nSwedenborg in that talk ? \" My stepmother s answer is : \" He did talk\nwith me about Swendenborg after you had been there, merely answering my\nquestions about Swedenborg's belief. 1 remember the conversation on the\nSabbath day you were at our house in Delphi about psychical research, and\nyour father was the first to speak of Swedenborg. In answer to something\nyou said he replied : 'that was Swedenborg's belief.' I cannot remember\nmuch of the conversation.\" The incident turns out thus to be true and\npertinent, though still amenable to the telepathic hypothesis from my\nsubliminal memory which was not clear enough at the sitting to be anything\nmore than a surmise on my part when mentioned. On the other hand,\nthe unity and interest of the fact in the light of what would be true in\ncase it was my father actually communicating is much greater on the\nspiritistic theory than the telepathic. It is precisely what he would think\nof on such an occasion, while I have never given Swedenborg anything\nmore than the most casual connection with the subject, though aware of\nhis belief and experiences from tradition.\nLatest Notes.\nThis Section contains additional notes representing the results of\nmy latest inquiries.\n(Note 18.)\nNew York, September 20tk, 1899.\nIn studying this sitting for a careful review of the facts, I discover\ninternal evidence that I appear to be communicating at this point with my\nfather. I had supposed from the name Charles that I was dealing with my\nbrother, but further and careful examination shows that this is not the best\n\f362 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ninterpretation of the passage. The key to this newer view is the statement :\n\"I have seen Annie and mother and Charles and Henry.\" This could\nhardly be natural for my brother Charles. But this discrepancy could be\npassed by were it not for the following incidents that completely tit father,\nand do not fit my brother at all. (1) The third person and relation of time\nexpressed in the statement : \" Yes, he did. Some time before. And when\nI came he helped me.\" (Cf. p. 341.) (2) Also the allusion to his passing\nout \"suddenly at last.\" (3) The trouble with the head and heart. (Cf.\np. 327-8, Sitting for December 26th, 1898.) (4) The expression, \" Give me\nmy hat,\" which was one used by my father, as remarked by my brother,\nwhenever he wanted to go to the door or out on an errand. (5) The mis\ntake of referring the ownership of the accordion to my brother George.\n(Cf. incident of the guitar, p. 461.) (6) The phrase later indicating the\nright fact if it was father and only a possible one if it was my brother,\nnamely, the statement : \"I used to play on this.\"\nOf course, I had no clue at the time for this interpretation, and only\nlater events suggest it. The name of my brother and the intimation of G. P.,\nthat it was \" Charles\" calling, the mention of the other calling for me not\nbeing accompanied with the name or relationship, concealed this possible\nview from me, so that it was most natural for mo at the time to suppose that\nI should adjust my questions and interpretation to the supposition that it\nwas my brother. But close study of the passage shows that the presence of\nthe lady communicator made the confusion too great to get my correct\nbearings, while her dismissal brings my brother in her place later when the\nCommunications become clear and intelligible. But in this confusion that\nprecedes the discovery of my indentity the incidents fit my father, and not\nmy brother, while the name of my brother is correct. In favour of my inter\npretation is the fact that there is no clear and unmistakable claim that the\nincidents belong to my brother, natural as it would bo to suppose this con\nnection from their relation to his name in the communications.\u2014J. H. H.\n(Note 19.)\nNew York, September 24<\/i, 1899.\nIn studying the passage in the second sitting, that of December 24th,\n1898, in which the name \" Robertson \" occurs, 1 chanced to think that there\nmight be a meaning in this reference which had entirely escaped me.\nOn examination, therefore, I find that it haa a possible significance of some\ninterest. As my notes show, I had supposed that I was dealing only with\nmy brother Charles, and that the name \" Robertson \" was an attempt to\nmention my brother Robert. The narrative of the record indicates this very\nclearly. It also indicates my attempt to trick the communicator into the\nbelief that this brother was not living, but, as the record shows, I failed. It\nis also evident that I did not at all understand the communications, and pos\nsibly the discovery of this led to the disappearance of the real communicator\nin favor of the continued conversation with my brother. However this may\nbe, it now seems probable to me that this is the first appearance of my \"uncle\nCharles,\" as he is connected with the mention of the name \"Robertson\" in\n\fXLI.] 363\nAppendix I.\nthe second sitting (p. 317). What it appears to be is a question to know\nwhere \"Robert's son\" was. My uncle usually called my father \"Robert,\"\nand if we suppose the same state of mind and desire to speak directly to me,\nas in this second sitting, we have evidence to suppose also that we are here\ndealing for the moment with my uncle. The broken syllables \" Ell ... el\n. . .\" get a pertinent significance which I never suspected before. [Cf. p.\n314.] They are probably attempts to give the name of his wife Eliza, with\nwhich both father and my uncle later succeeded. There is one difficulty in this\ninterpretation, and this is the use of the feminine gender by my brother in\nintroducing him. I had supposed for a moment that the reference was to\nmy mother, but soon saw that this was false, though without reckoning\nfather into the account the statement that she was the last to \" come here \"\nwas true for the family necrology. But this same remark would apply\nabsolutely to my uncle, who was the last of the family connections to die.\nHence, supposing that my brother is here somewhat confused in details,\nas I notice is the case with intermediaries (Cf. pp. 332, 100-108, 146-147),\nwe may put the other incidents down in favor of the hypothesis that I am\ncommunicating with my uncle, and what appeared confusion before becomes\nperfectly clear and intelligible.\u2014J. H. H.\n(Note 20.)\nNew York, July 10th, 1899.\nIn a conversation with my aunt Nannie, living in Philadelphia, just before\ngoing West on the mission connected with these investigations, I learned a\nfact of some interest in connection with the first sittings. I learned it with\nout asking a question regarding the matter, but during conversation about\nher sister's affairs, whose husband, my \"uncle Charles,\" had died so sud\ndenly last fall, and who had appeared to communicate in those sittings. My\naunt remarked that her sister (Aunt Eliza) had suffered so much from dis\ncouragement and loneliness. The business was left in a terrible condition\nby my uncle's unexpected death, and my aunt was always completely de\npendent upon him for the management of everything. She was moreover of\na very social nature and less self-sufficient than her sister Nannie, and when\nmy niece, who was boarding with her while going to the High School, went\nhome at the end of each week, my aunt suffered greatly from loneliness, and\ncomplained of it to her sister. From worry with business and from this\nloneliness they were much afraid at one time that she would not live. There\nis then a coincidence between this state of mind and the remarks made by\nthe communicator, or communicators, in the sitting of December 24th, 1898.\nIt might be what a inediuinistic brain should concoct out of any similar\nsituation, and I do not refer to it as anything evidential, but only as an\ninteresting coincidence, consistent with the spiritistic theory, though not\nsufficiently evidential of it to merit emphasis, especially as in the\nevent of its recognition we must suppose it to have been post-mortem\ninformation. It does not bear upon personal identity in any case. But\nit is coincidental with the actual condition of aunt's mind in a special way.\n\u2014J. H. H.\n\f3G4 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\n(Note 21.)\nAugnst 5th, 1891).\nThis reference to a tire persisted in later sittings until I took special\npains to inquire further about this incident after I had actually given it up\nas false, or a mere automatism. But its persistence on the part of the\ncommunicator, on any theory, required that the investigation be pushed\nfurther. I then inquired of my aunt again whether she remembered any\nfire near the old home which gave father a fright, and put my question\nalso without intimating that the message located it in his early life. Her\nspontaneous answer was : \" I do not remember any tire that could give\nhim a fright. When he was a very young man a barn in the neighbourhood\nwas struck with lightning and burned, but I do not think it gave him a\nfright.\" The incident is then so near right that father reports rightly a\nfire that occurred in his early life, though there seems no reason to suppose\nthat it gave him a fright. But the chief interest on any theory, even that of\nchance, is that the two references to a fire tit exactly with his experience\nwith his own barn. Are we to suppose here the same confusion as we found\nin the case of the walking-sticks, and with the social incidents of two\nbrothers ? We know what a fright the tire mentioned in the sitting for\nMay 30th caused, and that it was connected with the expectation that it was\nhis barn, about which I know he was always anxious. I do not remember\never hearing him speak of this earlier experience, but as I know his solicitude\nabout the barn built in my time, it is probable that I have heard him tell the\nstory of the barn struck by lightmng, so that I cannot say that such an\nevent would not be amenable to telepathy. But the real or apparent\nconfusion of two incidents that are known to have been a part of his\nexperience is a most interesting fact, all the more so that it seems to have\noccurred more than once.\u2014J. H. H.\n(Note 22.)\nNew York, October 31tt, 1899.\nThis allusion to holding his hands over his breast has a possible meaning\nif we assume that it is connected with an attempt to give the name of the\nmedicine that I had ask-d for just above. The reference to his heart and\neyes just before this is of course a continuance of the death-bed incidents.\nThe mention of the swelling at once called my attention to the possibility\nthat he was answering my earlier question with the catarrh in mind, and\nhence, when the mention of holding his hands over his breast came, I thought\nthere was again a return to the incidents that I did not recognise at the time\nas intended for the death scene. But as the name of the medicine for\nwhich I had asked was closely associated in his mind with the diseaso I was\nthinking of, and as the allusion to the swelling had such pertinence in\nreference to his expressed wonder that it should be an accompaniment of\ncatarrh , it is pertinent to suppose that he was describing a method by which\nhe took that medicine, as it would be inevitably held in some such way in\nthe intervals of inhaling the vapour. 1 wrote to my stepmother to know\nif she could remember his holding it with the two hands over his breast, and\nshe recalls no instance of this in particular, but it is more than a probable\n\fXLI.] 365\nAppendix I.\nfact, as he did take the Hyoinei to bed with him, and it would be most\nnatural to hold it so in intervals when sitting in his rocking-chair. But\nthere is no way to either prove the fact or to be certain that my interpreta\ntion is the true one, though I regard it as probable.\u2014 J. H. H.\n(Note 23.)\nShort Beach, Conn., July 25th, 1899.\nI have been reading my father's letters to me during the last few years of\nhis life, and find an incident in one of them which has some interest in thin\nconnection, and which partly confirms my statements about this strychnine,\nand partly serves to contradict the opinion that I have held about my\nknowledge of his taking strychnine, though this knowledge was purely\nsubliminal. The note in the appendix to these sittings shows that I did not\npurchase this strychnine, and now I find that a letter of April 27th, 1896,\nmentions the fact that he was taking strychnine and arsenic at the same\ntime that he was taking the Hyomei. I had thought all along that I knew\nnothing of the fact, and that the circumstance was not even in my sub\nliminal, so completely had the fact been suppressed in my memory, as would\nquite naturally be the case from its being a mere incident in a letter that I\nhad no special reason to remember. But here it turns up to be amenable to\nthe telepathic hypothesis for any one who pleases to apply it to the case.\nThe reference to arsenic will have an interest in another connection. But it\nwill be equally interesting to note that no other facts in this correspondence\nare obtained, as perhaps should be the case if telepathy is to be the\nexplanation. But I am less anxious to remove telepathy from the explana\ntion than I am to show documentary evidence from the pen of my father\nhimself of the fact that he was taking strychnine at the time he was taking\nthe Hyomei.\u2014J. H. H. \u2666\n(Note 24.)\nThis response to my statement is a most pertinent one. I had intimated\nmy reason for not asking questions, and here, after mentioning our talk on\nSwedenborg, there is the perfectly correct recollection that I had discussed\nthe difficulties of any such communications. That it was unlike me not to\ntalk freely with my father was true, and both the appreciation of my position\nand the recognition of the problem as I saw it in our talk, put together\nhere in the natural synthetic action of independent intelligence is very\ninteresting. It is not like the process of telepathy as we ordinarily conceive\nit.\u2014J. H. H.\n(Note 25.)\nApril 10th, 1901.\nWhile working on the resume' of these four sittings I observed that there\nmight be a connection between the names \" Mannie,\" \"Nani,\" \" Mnni,\"\nand \"Ani\" in this general passage, and the later references which turned\nout to be regarding my stepmother, whose name was Maggie (Cf. Note\np. 342). The internal evidence of this is the name \"Mannie\" and the\nspecial pertinence of certain statements with reference to my stepmother.\n\f366 [part\nJ. H. Hyslol), Ph.D.\nA further and perhaps strong piece of evidence for this interpretation\nof this reference is the doubt entertained about his own answer, which\nwas, of course, called out by my denial that \" Nani \" had them. This I\ndenied, of course, because I thought at the time that he had his sister\nNannie in mind. As he died at the home of my aunt Eliza, and did leave\nhis glasses there, and as there was ample reason for his supposing that I\nwas confused in regard to his meaning, the complex situation involving an\nattempt to indicate both where he left them and leith whom he left them was\ncalculated both to create confusion and to cause error. From my point of\nview there was no error except in the mention of his sister, but assuming\nthat it was my stepmother that he had in mind, as the previous use of\nthe name Mannie (p. 342), and later references under the name \" Nannie,\"\nwithout the appendage of sister or aunt, justify me in supposing, to say\nnothing of the present evidences, the whole message becomes perfectly\nintelligible, slight confusion and all.\nIf I could suppose that my question asking who were present at the\nconversation on spirit return was understood there would be clearer evidence\nthat \" Mannie \" was meant for \" Maggie.\" But it is quite apparent from\nthe content of the reply, especially in the reference to \"sister,\" to say\nnothing of Rector's direct statement, that it was not understood. The\nwhole passage therefore seems to be a connected one. It would appear\nfrom the allusion to the spectacles that my father's mind was turned in the\ndirection of events and persons present at the time of his death. Possibly\nthe manner of his reference to the two aunts is corroborative of this suppo\nsition. All the facts are consistent with it if they do not prove it.\nNow my stepmother was present at the conversation on spirit return\nthat I had in mind when I put my question, and she was also present at\nfather's death. It was therefore relevant that she should be mentioned in\neither case. My two aunts were present only at father's death. Assuming,\nthen, that my question was misunderstood and that it suggested to my\nfather his \"promise\" to return after it was all over, and that this, with\nmy statement that he had not mentioned all the names desired, had sug\ngested the persons present during his last illness, we should have a perfectly\nintelligible passage throughout. The \"Nan\" might be supposed to stand for\nmy aunt Nannie, and the \"Mannie\" and \"Mnni\" for \"Maggie,\" while\nthe name of Eliza is clear. In the light of the latter identification of the\nnames of my aunt and my stepmother the confusion of them here is intelli\ngible (Cf. pp. 69, 406). This interpretation of the passage gives a clearly\npossible meaning to the statement that I was in New York when the con\nversation about spirit return took place. This was false in relation to my\nquestion, but I was in New York when I wrote the letter asking father to\ncome to me after it was all over. The note in the body of the detailed\nrecord shows the special evidence that my stepmother is included in the\nintended reference of my father (p. 342). The natural association of these\nthree names is also illustrated in the mention of them together at the close\nof the sitting of June 8th (p. 496).\u2014J. H.

In sending me the record of the\nfirst of these sittings, Dr. Hodgson wrote on February 7th, 1899 :\n\" You had better make such notes as you wish, so that they can be\nembodied in the type-written copies as before.

There is\nevidently here some fear that the fact was not clear to my mind, as it was not\nmy note making that fact evident. But correspondence with my mother\n(stepmother) shows that I did have such a conversation, and after learning\nthe fact I sent word to Dr. Hodgson to tell my father what is here said to\nhim. It is quite as interesting to remark the promptness with which it is\ndropped when he is told of the discovery and admission of my mistake.\u2014\nJ. H.

I am thinking of the time some years ago\nwhen I went into the mountains for a change with him, and the trip we had\nto the lake after we left the camp. Ask him if he remembers this.\n[Hand lifts box up as if to show it clearly to Sp.]\nAnd I have often thought of this.\n[Father never went into the mountains with me, nor to the lake. Also\nthe allusion to his doing this after leaving \"the camp\" has no meaning\nwhatever. I do not know that he ever saw any mountains except the\nAlleghenies which he probably saw in 1876 when he went to the Centennial\nat Philadelphia. It would require a great deal of twisting and forced inter\npretation to discover any truth in the statements for any one in the acquaint\nance of my father, even if it could be done in any way at all. It might\nsuggest something to others, but it suggests only what is false to me.\u2014\nJ. H.

[(y.\npp. 29-34.] I hear James often speaking to me. I hear him calling as\nit were for me to be near him.

We\nwill keep him near, friend.\nAsk him to recall all about this, friend, when he returns {R} (About\nwhich, Rector !) his experiences . . his + wishes thee to do so. (In\nconnection with this accident you mean !) In any thing, yes this in particular.\n(Yes, I will.) And the fire of which he is thinking. He is returning.\nYes, friend, I here (\"I have \"). I am here.\n(Mr. . . .) but I cannot remain long at a time just now.\n(I understand. I am sure that James will be very pleased for you to\nremember all you can about your experiences in connection with this accident\nor the tire.)\nYes, well then I may as well tell you all I can remember. I remember it\nseemed to be in the night and we were going at quite a rapid rate when a\nsudden jerk and crash aroused me, only to find we were in a . . ,\ndilapidated state . . . [Jerk awl crash not read at first.] he says jerk\n[sentence read through.] Yes, quite right.\nYes. Yes that is, the rails, bridge, cars and all . . Bridge. I have\nto catch it as best I can, friend (Yes. I understand.) otherwise I could not\nget it all for thee.\n[This incident about the railroad accident is much like that about the trip to\nthe mountains, except that it may have some possibilities in it. As it stands\nit has no definite meaning to me. I recall definitely no such accident as is here\ndescribed. The allusion to its having occurred when we or he made a trip\nout West takes it outside my memory. Father owned some land in Illinois\nand used to take trips out there to look after it. But I never heard of any\naccidents into which he got on any of those tiips. In 18W1, when I was only\nseven years old, I went with him, my mother, my sister Anna, and an aunt on\none of these trips, but I remember no serious accidents on it. If I remember\ncorrectly, we were delayed at Kokomo, Indiana, for some reason, though I do\nnot recall whether there was a delay on account of an accident, or whether\nmy memory of the place is due wholly to its singular name. As I write,\nhowever, I recall that we stopped for dinner, and I have always remembered\nthe peculiar name as a matter of childish interest, along with many incidents\nof that trip, which the nature of this discussion does not at present require\nme to mention. I know of two accidents that occurred in Chicago on this\ntrip. But they were not connected with any railways, nor with anything\n\fXLl.] 373\nAppendix II.\nthat would suggest them. I have only the vaguest impression that on this\ntrip there was something that might be construed as an accident, but I am\nconfident that it could not be described in such strong terms as are used\nhere. The allusion to the tire is as indefinite as the accident, and is evidently\nan attempt to reopen the incident that was not made clear to me in the\nDecember sittings. The only thing that has any apparent connection with\nthe real life of my father in this narration is the allusion to his recovery of\nhis ability to walk, and the expression of his belief that I should be glad to\nknow it. There is no reason from its connection to construe it as coming\nfrom him, but it was a fact that for fifteen years he had been unable to walk\nwithout a cane or a crutch. But if there is any truth in the whole incident\nit has no connection with my experience. \u2014J. H. H.]\nGive me his book kindly . . . or if thou canst give me his .\n(Rector, this is all I have with me) Give him his . . Yes glasses.\n(Does he remember this !) [box]\nYes, friend, very well. He had it for years.\n(Perhaps he would like to tell me about it.)\nYes, but there is very little to tell about this, he says, only it is his\nglasses case and was in the family for years. (Did he call it his glasses\ncase ?) [spectic apparently superposed on yeart] He says spectacle [spectical].\n(Did he call it his spectacle case ?) Yes. (I want to get it just right if\npossible.)\nI am quite sure of what I am saying to you, my friend. I think Nannie\nwill remember this also very well. You might speak to her about it, or ask\nJames to do so. (Yes, I will.)\nI shall be better able to recall everything in time if you will be kind\nenough to let me speak occasionally. I am more anxious than I can tell you\nto explain every thing.\n[This language about the spectacle case has some pertinence. For some\nyears after he began to wear glasses, he called them spectacles. Later he\nbegan to call them glasses, but he always, in my recollection, called the case\nhis \" spectacle case,\" as corrected here. Of course I had seen very little of\nhim after 1882, except in vacations, and then after 1885 only once until 1892,\nagain in 1894, and last when he died in 1896. But I remember what he\ncalled both his glasses and the case. No special evidential value can be put\nupon the fact here, because there is hardly any choice for a speaker on this\nmatter, as the usage here adopted would probably be universal. But it\ndeserves remark as a fact that the usage here conforms to the fact of my\nfather's usage when living, and that there was a change of usage for the\nterm glasses. This is the reason that I asked in the sitting for the 27th of\nDecember last what glasses he meant when he alluded to them. I wished\nthen to see if he would resort to his regular usage in regard to them.\n\" Nannie \" is probably Rector's mistake for Maggie, the name of my step\nmother.\u2014J. H.

With the direct answers to any [my ?]\nquestions and to help Mr. Hyslop to come closer. (Good.)\nI . . . (Shall I present articles ?) [Assent. Cross in air.]\nYes kindly. I am very near thee, friend.\n(I am very glad.) (There is this.)

Him to answer\nfor Mr. W. this day, as it will necessitate our using too much light for him,\nand we must give it for this kind gentleman, viz., Mr. Hyslop. (Yes, I\nunderstand.) He will ans. for W. later. (I understand.)\nGood morning, James. I am glad to be here again. I am your father\nstill who is trying to help you tind me. I recall quite vividly some few\nrecollections which I think will interest you somewhat. I remember some\nyears ago of sending . . sending George some of the photos taken of\nthe Library [not read] . . wait a . . Library, and he said he would\nreturn copies after he had finished them . . (\"finished\"?) finished\nthem . . finished, he repeats.\n[This allusion to his \"library\" had no meaning to me, as I never knew\nhim to call any room a library. He had no such room in his house. But I\nwrote to my stepmother in regard to this and several other matters in this\nsitting, and the reply is that father \"never called \" the sitting room, which\nalso contained what books he owned, his library. Besides, he never had any\nphotos of it taken and sent no such articles to my brother George. This\nincident is therefore totally false. It has an interest, nevertheless, under\nthe telepathic hypothesis, if that must be invoked to explain the true\nincidents in the various sittings. The term library describes what I have\nin my house, though I never had any photo of it taken, and we might sup\npose that the telepathic acquisition of what pertained to my father might be\nmixed up with ideas taken from my mind about my library. I do not attach\nany weight to tins supposition in the case of this incident alone, but only in\nview of the resort to telepathy at all for other facts, when the falsity of this\nincident considered in relation to my father can he partly accounted for by\nsupposing some telepathic \" fishing\" amid the ideas of my own mind. The\napplicability of \" library \" to my own mind is, of course, the only reason for\nsuch a suggestion, though in detail it is as false regarding myself as it is\nregarding any experience of father's. The only escape of the spiritistic\ntheory on this and some similar and later incidents is that the discarnate\n\f378 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nHpirit is out of his right mind, or that there is an intermediary present who\ninterprets a reference to the room where he kept his books, and that he\nwould call a \"sitting room,\" as \"library.\"\u2014J. H. H.] [I have since\nascertained that my father sent a photo of himself and my mother to my\nbrother George, but the language here does not fit the fact as known.\n(May 21st, 1900.) J. H. H.]\nI also rem . recall the disturbance and trouble I had with one of\nmy eyes, the left one. Do you not remember this, and the little so-called\n. . What . . . P . . A . . yes, I hear. Pad. Pad. I had a\npeculiar mark, which you will recall, at the back of the ears [ear ?]\nTell me, friend, that I may show it to him.\n[The allusion both to the difficulty with the left eye and to the mark\nbehind the ear is, as far as I and my stepmother know, entirely false. We\nnever knew of any trouble with either of them.\u2014J.H.H.] [See Note 27, p. 409.]\n(Some more articles. Rector ?)\n[Hand lifts box and still holding box, touches with fingers a spot behind\nmy left ear just below mastoid process.] (Here ?) Yes.\nYes. Give me one. [In reply to question above about more articles.]\n(I think there are some more inside this [box]. Can you ask Mr. Hyslop\nif he can tell what they are inside before I open.) [Pause.]\nHe is saying something. Wait until I hear it clearly.\n[Pause.] This I think is the one I used to put my Pen ho [?] . . .\nno not iien, Paper cutter . . P . . sounds like in .\n[As a matter of fact I had kept father's pen in this spectacle case ever\nsince his death, and it was there in the case when thus shown to Mrs. P. But,\nas indicated by Dr. Hodgson, it had not yet been opened. The allusion to a\npaper cutter I thought nonsense, as I had never known father to have a\npaper cutter. He never needed one for the purpose of cutting the leaves of\nnew books, as I suppose he had not bought any books that would need\ncutting of the leaves for forty years, and the newspapers he took needed no\nsuch instrument. Hence I treated the reference here as nonsense. But I\ntook no risks in the matter, and asked my stepmother whether father ever\nowned such an article, and if so, whether he ever put it in his spectacle case,\nexpecting to find my suspicion confirmed. Her reply is that he did have a\npaper cutter, a wooden one made by my brother, for opening letters, but\nthat he carried it in his vest pocket. I believe also that he never kept his\npen in this case. The later statements seem much clearer on this matter.\u2014\nJ. H. H.] [Cf. Note 34, p. 414]\nPerhaps you will recall my asking for my knife . . recall. [Cf. p. 336.]\n(Yes.)\nI think, friend, he is quite ready. [Cross in air.] Yes.\n[The allusion to his knife here shows a memory of what had been asked\nfor at an earlier sitting as already discussed, and indicates the same\npersonality as then on any theory of the case, as also do many other\nincidents.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Does he wish to say anything about the present contents of this box)\n[Pause.] (before I open it ?) Only concerning his spectacles, that is all. I\nhave to say ... let me go a minute and return. I am very blind and\nI begin to feel strange.\n\fXLI.] 379\nAppendix II.\n[The box did contain his spectacles as well as his pen. \u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes, go away and come back.)\nWe like him very well. He seems a most intelligent fellow, but finds it\ndifficult for him to remain long at a time. In time he will, however, come\nvery near, be quite clear, and do a great [work] for thee, friend.\nHere I am. Yes, I see, you are not really James, but his friend. Glad\nI am to know you. (I am very glad.)\nYes, I remember I used to have this little case on my desk a great deal.\nYes. And I am sure I used to place my spectacles in it. Yes, and some\ntime my paper-cutter.\nYes, I am sure he is right.\n[The statement about the spectacles is correct, but that about the paper-\ncutter is false as far as can be ascertained.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes, well . . ) He seems to know. (Anything else about what he\nused to do with it.) No, no he says nothing.\n(Well, Mr. Hyslop. Can you see what is now in it ?)\nLooks like my glasses. Yes.\n(Don't bother about trying to see what is actually now in the box, but if\nyou are able to tell what exactly is in it, of course I shall be glad.)\nWell, will you not let me look and think more about it and make quite\nsure of it ?\n(Why this . . . there is no hurry, and I would much rather you\nshould take all the time you want and be quite calm and peaceful, and just\nthink quietly how you can best give good tests to James.)\nYes, very well, then. Until I become accustomed to this way of speak\ning, understand the light that looks so bright to me and through which I am\nnow looking at you, I will not try to say too many things, but you can per\nhaps imagine how anxious I am to reach my children, especially James, as he\nwas really more to me than the rest, in a way.\nI think of everything I ever did. All in one minute it comes to me, then\nseems to leave me when I try to express something of it to you. (Yes.)\nYet with patience and time, friend, he will become clear and remember\nall. + .

As indicated in\nearlier notes, father did not keep what could be called ordinarily a diary,\nbut only an account book which served in many respects as a diary, as it\ncontained facts and records that most people would call or embody in a\ndiary. He also kept his daily accounts in it. But the extracts from his\nreading were written down on other pieces of paper for special use.\u2014\nJ. H.

Her letter in reply\nshows that there was no delay of any kind according to her recollection, though\nmy brother Frank says that there was some delay in regard to the goods, but\nno accident. But even supposing either some delay or an accident or both, I\nthink we could attach no significance to such a coincidence, except in favour\nof chance or guessing ; for the statement in regard to the alleged facts\nevidently relates to a trip when I had accompanied him, or when he had\ngone alone. The only possibility of relevance therefore lies in the sup\nposition that the time must coincide with the journeys which my father took\nto Illinois. Of course my age of seven years makes my memory too poor to\ntrust for any purposes, confirmatory or otherwise. I have already mentioned\nthe fact that I remember distinctly one delay for dinner at Kokomo, Indiana,\nand since then I recall the probability that we stopped there twice, once\ngoing and once on returning, but I recall nothing definite enough to say that\nthere was a delay at that place. But I have a strong impression from\nmemory that there was a delay at some point on that journey that was due to\nan accident, but not to our train. Where, I cannot recall. At any rate, it\nwas not serious enough to be talked about either to relatives or at home\namong his children, and no one is now living that could possibly throw light\nupon the matter but myself and my mother's sister, who was with us at the\ntime, as I was the only child with him and mother at the time, except sister\nAnnie, and she died a few years afterward. My aunt remembers no railway\naccident in which father was at any time.\nBut the answers to my questions put to my stepmother regarding the\nvarious incidents in the two sittings explain themselves. I did not tell her\nthe contents of the statements made in Boston, but inquired to know whether\ncertain facts were true or not.\u2014J. H. H.\nBloomington, Ind., February 11ft, 1899.\nMv dear James,\u2014Your note of February 9th at hand, and I reply at\nonce.\n1st.

He had a little wooden paper-cutter that Frank made him to open\nletters with once while he was at home with us in Delphi, but he positively\nnever carried it in his spectacle case, but in his vest pocket.\n4th. No, there was no delay or accident on our way from Xenia to\nDelphi.\n5th. No delay or accident happened to the cars that brought our goods.\nThey got to Delphi before we did.\n6th.

It must be this, as I took some. (Yes.)\n[I know nothing of father's having taken morphine and doubted it when\nI read this passage. The nature of the difficulty, however, under which he\nsuffered, which would prompt some physicians, at least according to older\npractice, to resort to it, led me to inquire both of the physician who attended\nhis last illness and of my stepmother whether father had ever used any\nmorphine, and both answer in the negative. The physician did not prescribe\nany for him after his return to his old home to die, and I knew there was no\nreason in the disease itself for hope of relief in this remedy, though morphine\nmight have been serviceable to aid his sleep. He had also suffered from\nmuch sleeplessness for a year or more before his death and this was the\nreason that I suspected the possibility of his having taken morphine under\nthe old-fashioned treatment he received in the State in which he was then\nliving. My stepmother says in answer to my inquiry : \"No, he never took\nany morphine at any time that I ever knew of. He always said that he\nnever could take it.\"\u2014J. H.

This Samuel Cooper was so far from being philosophic\nthat he would not understand even the word. The phrase \"philosophical\ntopics \" then sounds like an echo of some telepathic acquisitions obtained\nfrom my mind when in Boston. It has absolutely no relevance to the\nperson named in my question.\u2014J. H. H.] [For effect of further inquiry\nupon my estimate of this general incident, see Note 29, p. 410.

He also inquires of a special pen or quill, as he calls it, with\nwhich he used to write. (Yes. I will tell James.)\n[This allusion to the skull cap again is interesting, especially in connection\nwith that to the \"pen or quill\" : for it induced me to inquire of an aunt who\nknew father's early habits when he became bald, as he did very early, and\nbefore I was born. He was bold as far back as I can remember, and I\nthought it possible that he might have worn some cap for his head, though\nsuch a thing as wearing a skull cap was foreign to his own habits and an un\nknown among his acquaintances. I find that he never wore such a thing in\nhis early life. But he did use quill pens until he bought the gold pen which\nI had sent on to Dr. liodgson for use at the sittings. The cap is mentioned\nin a later sitting, and I shall add there what I did in regard to a similar\nallusion in my last sitting in Boston on December 27th.\u2014J. H.

I remember him only as wearing often a different coat when\nso sitting before the fire from that which he did his work in when the\nweather was cold. The whole pissage savours too much of a description of\none who lives in a library or among books to be used as evidence, especially\nthe word \"gown,\" which father would never use. I find from my step\nmother, however, that father did use to wear a thin coat in the mornings\nwhen sitting before the fire.\u2014J. H. H.] [Later references to this incident\nand further study convince me that there is more pertinence in it than the\nabove note admits. (May 23rd, 1900.)\u2014J. H. H. Cf. pp. 54-55.]\nYes, I am glad. It will be pleasant to talk . . talk with him as I\nused. James was always a good son, and cared much for me.

Perhaps you know about this, but I feel it no more.\n(Cf. pp. 327-328.)\n(All the physical troubles are over now.)\nYes, and I feel very well satisfied with myself, quite unlike my former\nself, James. (YTes.)\nI do not think I can speak with you much longer now, but I will come\nwhen I can and tell you all I have on my mind.\n[This whole passage beginning with the flattering allusion to myself has a\nsingular interest. First it represents just what father would say about me\nto anyone else. We did grow more companionable toward the end of his\nlife, the estrangement caused by my apostacy having been overcome. But\nwe cannot be said to have been much together. The very opposite was the\nfact, as some of my other notes abundantly show, except that we often\ntalked a great deal with each other when we were together. This allusion to\nthe faithfulness of Nannie, which is the name of his sister, while it is true,\nhas no pertinence whatever here, especially when we look at the following\nstatement in reference to his bronchial trouble, which was perfectly true.\nIf he had used the name Maggie, which is that of my stepmother, there\nwould have been extraordinary pertinence in the passage, all the more so when\nwe know the care and patience with which my stepmother nursed him during\nhis long illness. (Cf. pp. 342, 366.) This does not seem to me like the\nordinary mediumistic trick, because the word \" faithfulness \" and the specific\nallusion to bronchial trouble are too true and pertinent, the word\n\"faithfulness\" being just what he was accustomed to use to me when\ndefending my stepmother against criticisms which stepmothers have often to\nbear from step-children. It is not less interesting to note also the evident\nintention to speak of the bronchial trouble to a stranger who is supposed not\nto have known the fact. This word had not been used in any of my sittings,\nbut from what I have said in regard to his disease, it is pertinent enough to\nbe called correct, though not technically right. It was the larynx that was\nattacked, but the disease had penetrated into the bronchial tubes and they\nwere badly affected with it. But in a tit of unconsciousness, as it were, in\nthe attempt to communicate, it is noticeable that there is a change from the\naddress to the third person to addressing me in the second person. There is\nno significance in this except that it may help to show the possible source\nof the confusion in the whole passage which can be cleared up in the way I\nhave spoken of it.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes. Can . . .)\nI wish George could come to me. (Do you mean to your world !) Yes,\nI do. (Why !) James will U D. this. (All right.)\n[I do not understand this, though in the light of a later sitting it may be\nmade intelligible.\u2014J. H. H.]\nHowever, I see it is better so.\nDo you remember your sister Annie ? (Did James have a sister Annie ?)\n[repeated] Yes. [This is correct, and Dr. Hodgson seems to have forgotten\nwhat came in this name at my sittings.\u2014J. H. H.]\n\fAppendix II. 889\n(All right. I will tell him.) She is here with me, and she is calling\nto you.\n(Mr. Hyslop.) Yes, I hear you. What do you wish !\n(It is curious. I know your son James very well, anil we are interested\ntogether in this work. I have a sister Annie also, and she is still in the\nbody, and I think your views in the body were probably not unlike my own\nfather's, and you might be interested to meet my father over there, and you\ncan talk to him about James, and perhaps he will tell you something about\nme. I think you and my father would get along very well.)\nWell, I am glad to know this, and I will surely look him up, but you will\nremember one thing, and that is that my Annie is not yours. (Yes, I under\nstand. She's with you.) Yes, and I will surely find your father and know\nhim. These kind friends will help me to find him. (Yes, they will ; they\nwill introduce you to him. I shall be very pleased if they will.)\nWas he very orthodox, do you think ! (Fairly so.) [This question is not\nlike father, though it is not impossible. \u2014J. H. H.]\nWell, there is no need for it here. However, we won't discuss that until\nlater, when we know each other better. (He was a Wesleyan Methodist.)\nWell, this of course was more or less orthodox. [This sounds like an echo\nof Dr. Hodgson's \"fairly so.\"\u2014J. H. H.] (Yes, oh yes, indeed.)\nExactly, well we will get on finely soon. I know this perfectly well.\nBut I must get accustomed te this method of speech, and see how I can best\nexpress my [best written above express with caret below] my thoughts to you.\n(Yes.)\nI am now thinking of my own things and concerns.\nI can preach myself very iwell. Ask my son if this is not so. I recall\nmany things which I would gladly have changed if it had been as clear to\nme as it is now. I wish I could take my knife a moment, as it will .\n[Knife, from parcel C, given to hand.]\nIt will help me when I return to you. I do not think I can say more to\nyou now.\n(Well, I am very pleased to have had this talk with you, and I am sure\nthat James will be glad to read what you told me about the medicine and\ngown and reading the paper and so on.)\nWell I have so many things to say of much greater importance in a way\nlater when I can fully and clearly express myself.\nI am anxious to do much for him. (Yes.) Will you excuse me, I must\ngo. (Yes, certainly. Good-bye for the present. Thank you very much.)\n[Excitement.] There is one tune going through my mind. Listen.\nNeiirer my 0ixl to Thee. Hyslop.\n[This whole passage in reference to Dr. Hodgson's father and the state\nments purporting to come from my father are full of difficulties. With excep\ntion to the allusion to my sister Annie it might be taken to be a deliberate\nfabrication of the medium on the suggestion from Dr. Hodgson's mention of\nhis father being a Wesleyan Methodist. The statement of my father that he\ncould \" preach \" and that I could confirm it is not true, except in the sense\nthat it would be true of any one who took as much interest in religious\nmatters as he did, who spoke at prayer meetings as often as he did, and\nwho commented on a chapter in the Bible in substitution for a sermon, as he\n\f390 [part\nJ, H. Hyxlop, Ph.D.\ndid when we had no preaching. But he would never call thin \"preaching,\"\nand he never undertook any function in such services that could be mistaken\nfor \" preaching,\" at least within my experience and recollection. It seems\nto be an idea that might be readily awakened by association with the con\nception of a Wesleyan Methodist in any brain acquainted with their laymen's\nhabits. This is also confirmed by the quotation from the hymn, \"Nearer,\nmy God, to Thee.\" For the very interesting fact here is that father belonged\nto a denomination that would not tolerate either hymn singing or instrumental\nworship in its religious services, and father never knew a hymn in his\nlife, while this hymn is a perfectly familiar one to Wesleyans and others. It\nwould be the last thing in the world that he would quote at all, and especially\nto prove his identity to me. His attendance at church also was so strict that\nhe never went to any church where he would even hear a hymn. He did not\neven, after 1858, go to any church whose doctrines and practices most\nresembled his own, but only to his own congregation. Hence this quotation\nlooks like the very worst attempt to establish identity, and runs the risk of\ndoing the very opposite. It is probable that father had heard this hymn at\nsome funeral service where it was sung, but he certainly could not quote it\nfreely, and would not be tempted consciously or purposely to mention\nit in order to identify himself to me. He was not opposed to singing\nhymns for secular purposes, and during the Moody and Sankey excite\nment allowed us children to sing them at home on evenings with accom\npaniment of organ music. But he would not tolerate them in any other\nconnection.\nIf we have a right to interpret the passage as an automatism and repre\nsentation of conceptions which any person, incarnate or discarnate, would\nnaturally have, and as a most probable memory of my father, we could explain\nthe incidents on the spirit hypothesis, but it would be far from affording any\nevidence for it. On the contrary, it awakens suspicions in this regard and\nrequires overwhelming evidence of a better import to justify any attempt to\nexplain away difficulties. \u2014J. H. H.] [See Note 31, p. 413. (May 2.3rd,\n1900).-J. H. H.]\n[Further consideration has led me to think that I attributed too little\nimportance to the substitute for preaching which my father gave us in the\nform of comments on a chapter in the Bible. I found also a striking\nsignificance in the mention of the hymn. See Note 31, p. 413.]\nFriend, he is awakening, and seems very clear this day.\nI hope he will feel free soon as we do now.\n* \u00bb * * *\n[Mrs. P.'s sublim.]\nI.\nWho's the little dark man ?\nHe's very persistent any way, isn't he, Rector !\nYou'll manage him if you keep on.\nI don't want anybody . . .\nGood-bye.\nI didn't want to ache [!] any, \u2014I didn't want to go.

Dr. Hodgson, however, had pronounced it several\ntimes in the previous sittings.

It was quite, but I am anxious to speak plainly\nto and for you.\n(Yes, do not worry. Feel quite calm, and think quietly of any other\nmedicines that you took that you think James knows about.)\nI took at one time some preparation of Oil, but the name has gone from\nmy memory. I know everything so well when I am not speaking to you.\nDo you hear me. (Yes. I . .) Now .\n[These attempts to give the names of the medicines which he had taken\nin addition to those mentioned in my sittings have some interest. The one\nthat I had in mind when I sent on the question is not mentioned, and I have\nhad to send West to find out whether there was any truth in the statements\nmade here. I recognised at once the internal probability that at least some\nof them were correct, as the disease would require some form of Germicide,\nand some preparations of oil would serve it well. I went also and inquired\nof the druggists in this city, without telling them what I wanted the informa\ntion for, whether the first-named medicine, \" Munyon's . .\" was for\ncatarrh, and I found one by that name for this disease, which was what father\nthought he had. I found also that, though there was no special medicine by\nthe name of Germicide, there were many medicines called by that name or\nsaid to have that property, which were or could be used for catarrh, and I\nknew merely that father had taken many patent medicines for his trouble.\nBut I had to wait word from the West from my stepmother for any positive\nevidence as to the statements here made. My mother answers as follows :\u2014\nDear James,\u2014As Frank has written at length, I will answer your\nquestions briefly.\n1st. Your father never took any medicine in his sickness that sounded\nlike \"Munion.\"\n2nd. The inhaler that you sent him was the only thing that could be\ncalled a Germicide.\n3rd. He did not take any preparation of oil internally. \u2014Affectionately,\nMother.\nIt must be remembered that I did not tell my stepmother what had been\ntold at the sitting, but simply asked the simple questions whether father had\never taken the medicines named. My brother answers the same questions\nas follows :\u2014\n120, East 3rd Street, Bloomington, Indiana,\nFebruary 23rd, 1899.\nMv Dear James,\u2014When father was using an inhaler for his sore throat\nhe used a medicine called Hyomei. It was a medicine put up in New York\nby R. T. Booth, and you got it for him, father, along with the inhaler and\nsent it to him. This Hyomei was claimed by Mr. Booth to be a germicide\nand hence to be a specific for all lung and throat troubles.\nFather had Itev. Morton Malcom to send him from Pennsylvania, I\nthink, a bottle of medicine called Japanese oil. It was a strong liniment for\nexternal application chiefly. I think he used some of it in that way, but did\nnot take it internally.\nFrank E. Hvsi.op.\n\fAppendix II. 393\nNew York, March Uth, 1899.\nI culled to-day at one of the wholesale drug stores to inquire if among\nMunyon's medicines there was one called Germicide, and was answered in\nthe affirmative. It is a medicine for catarrh and is taken by an inhaling\nprocess. I was shown the apparatus by which the medicine is taken, and it\nconsists of a bottle with an arrangement for dissolving the medicine and\ninhaling the vapor through a tube. The emphatic answer of my brother and\nmother that father never took any of this prevents any use of the statements\nat the sitting except as a failure. It is interesting, however, to note that\nthis medicine culled Germicide, or rather Catarrh medicine denominated as a\nGermicide, is just what father would have considered with his idea of what\nhis disease was. It is more than probable that he had seen and consulted various\nadvertisements, but I have not been able at this date to discover the slightest\nevidence that he ever took it. Assuming that he had often thought of it we\ncan explain the statement at the sitting as consistent with the supposition\nthat we were dealing with a discarnate spirit, but without farther evidence\nthat he had thought of it the incident must be set down with that of the\nmorphine as an error, and in no case as evidence.\u2014J. H.

I understand, Rector. But, for example, as I tried successfully\nlong ago with the old communicator Phinuit, I asked him when I was not\nhere . . . )\nAh yes.

Why, if this is the best way of getting clear answers, why is it\nneedful to bring him here at all ?)\nSo that he will see me operate and U D how and why we reach thee, that\nhe may not be perplexed at our inquiries, also to be better able to recollect\nhis earthly experiences, through coming into contact with his objects,\netc. U D.\n(It is absolutely necessary, then !)\nYes, otherwise He would not have it so. But thou wilt remember that\nit requires time and patience to clear up his mind absolutely in regard\nto his earthly life. Thou wilt U D that much of it is gladly forgotten by\nall of us.\n(Yes, indeed. I think perhaps it might be better not to ask any more\nof his son's questions, but let Mr. Hyslop himself continue to recall what he\nthinks best.)\n[This statement by Rector is hardly consistent with that made by my\nfather. That is, Rector says that the earthly recollections are so likely to\nbe fiirgotten and father says that he can recall them so clearly when he is not\nspeaking through this machine. I had asked Dr. Hodgson why he did not\nhave Rector ask father the question away from the sitting and bring the\nanswer himself. This recommended itself to me because it seems that\nRector can think and write with perfect clearness, and that it could not be\n\f394 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nsaid of him that the conditions caused any special confusion. This then is\nthe answer that we get when the trial is made, and it seems to quite\ncontradict the implications of father's statements written hy Rector himself\nas the communications themselves indicate. The explanations are not\nimpossible, and apart from the statements made about the effect of the\nmachine and the clear memory away from it might be treated as reasonable.\nOf course, if Rector means that the forgetfulness occurs when in contact\nwith the machine we can understand it, but the statements suggest diffi\nculties.-,!.

I think so.)\nIf not, speak now before he becomes in any way confused.\n[This long and complex message has much interest, though I cannot say\nthat it is evidential. The first statement about the medicine is correct. The\nHyomei was a vapour which had to be taken by means of a special instru\nment which I got at the time I got the medicine itself. It is impossible to\nsay, however, whether the communicator intends here to thus characterise\nthe medicines which he had named previously to Dr. Hodgson, or the\nHyomei, which he mentioned to me at my fourth sitting. The phrase, \"and\nalso the other,\" makes it probable, and perhaps conclusive, that the vapour\nrefers to the Hyomei. If so it is an interesting coincidence, and not less so\nwith the fact that much of the passage is not true.\nIt is evident that the predominant idea about this Samuel Cooper is that\nhe was of \"a philosophical turn of mind,\" which is, as I have said before,\nabsolutely false. It is true that the two men differed radically in their\n\f398 [part\nJ. H. Hyslo,), Ph.D.\nreligious views, at least in the opinion of each of thein, for one was a\nWesleyan, and the other, my father, a Presbyterian. They have had\n\" friendly discussions \" on the subject of religion, which the usually supposed\ndifference between philoso],hy and religion in the common mind might\nsuggest to any brain, but they never carried on any correspondence. The\nstatement that he had met him \" here\" is pertinent, and also that \" he came\nsome years before I did,\" is exactly correct. From what I have just said\nabove alxiut the correspondence it will be apparent that there are no letters\nfrom this man in father's collection.\nThe reference to a photo in his \"collection\" is not definite enough to\nmake anything out of it. Nor was it definite enough at my sitting to\nrecognise what was meant. But I now recall a large photo of father which\nmight be meant, especially when I recall that at my sitting he wished me to\nhave it, he always knowing that I would value it most and be more likely to\nkeep it carefully. But it would have to be more particularly indicated here\nin order to suppose that either this or any other particular picture was\nintended. It is the same memory, however, that is here at work that\nclaimed to be my father at my sittings.\nThis reference to the \"stick with a turn in the end, on which I carved\nmy initials '' has some possibilities in it. I know he had a cane with a turn in\nit at the end, the usual curved end for holding it. I gave it to him myself, but\nI do not know whether he ever carved his initials on it or not. I rather think\nhe did not do so. But as he had more than one \"stick' he may have had\none such as is here described. I shall have to inquire in the West about\nit.\u2014J. H. H.\nSince writing the above a letter from my brother says: \" Father never\nhad a cane or ' stick ' with his initials carved on it. He never used a cane or\nstick to emphasise his talk.\"\nMy brother who wrote this was probably too young to remember that an\nolder brother and sister with myself once gave father a cane, an ebony cane,\nwith his initials carved on it, and that it was lost on the train while travelling.\nBut this Wine was not curved at the top or anywhere. It was a perfectly\nstraight stick. I refused to mention this fact until I learned whether he had\never had any other stick answering to the description given at the sitting.\nThe cane I gave him was curved at the top, but had no initials on it when I\ngave it to him, and I did not know whether any initials had been put on it\nby him or not. It was not his habit to do anything of this sort. He valued\na cane only for its use and not as a memento, so that I should not naturally\nexpect what he here mentions as anything done by himself, though that is\nnot what is necessarily implied by the statement. I shall inquire further\nabout the emphasis.\nIn my first correspondence regarding the \" stick \" or cane I did not tell\nanything about the statements made to Dr. Hodgson in Boston, and the\nanswers came as already recorded. The attempt to make clear at the sitting that\nthe communicator had a curved cane in mind suggested to me that possibly\nthere was an attempt to indicate a distinction that would Iks natural between\nthe cane owned years before on which father's initials were engraved, and the\ncane with the curved end that I had given him. If this were what the com\nmunicator had in mind it would have been a very forceful choice of evidential\n\fXLI.] 309\nAppendix II.\nincidents. Hence with the suspicion that the inquiry regarding the facte\nneeded to be pushed farther I wrote to my brother telling him what had\nbeen said at the sitting, and asking that he, my stepmother and my sister\nthink the matter over and see if they did not recall the fact that father did\nhave a cane with his initials on it. I referred to what I had remembered\nabout the one given father by my brother and sister years ago. I asked also\nfurther about the emphasis mentioned at the sitting. The replies are\nunanimous in regard to the question of the curved cane and initials on it,\nwhich were quite consistent with my expectations in the matter. I had\nknown of no such cane [Cf. p. 415], and the carving of his initials on it was\nso inconsistent with my father's habits, as he never indulged in whittling or\ncarving of any kind, that I could not imagine its truth, though granting its\npossibility. But the answers, one and all, state that he had no cane whatso\never on which his initials were carved by himself, and that the curved cane\nthat I had sent him had not been touched in this way. In so far as regards\nhis use of the stick for emphasis there is not the same unanimity of opinion.\nMy stepmother says : \" I never knew him to use his cane to emphasise his\nwords in conversation\u2014was always deliberate.\" My brother wrote in his\nfirst reply, which was mislaid, and found when the second letter was answered,\nthat he \"never knew him to use his cane to emphasise his expression.\" In\nthe second letter he writes : \" Neither mother [stepmother] nor I remember\nhim to have used his cane to emphasise his talk. But Henrietta says she\nremembers distinctly that he did it at times, especially in animated conversa\ntion. She is very positive about this. I remember [and my stepmother\nsays the same] that he often sat with his cane across his knees or resting\nhis hands and chin on it. But as to his using it to emphasise his talk I\ncannot be positive, though like yourself I have a faint impression that he\ndid.\"\nI may add that even if there were unanimity of opinion as to his\noccasional emphasis of his conversation in the manner alluded to at the\nsitting it could have little evidential value, because, as my stepmother\ncorrectly remarks, father was usually so calm and deliberate in his conversa\ntion and discussions that there was little temptation to resort to any forms\nof emphasis of this kind, though my impression had been exactly that of my\nsister, that in the occasional animated talks in which he sometimes engaged he\ndid emphasise himself in this way. But it was not a habit or characteristic\nof him as it perhaps is of myself, and so could not be used as evidence of\nidentity. It has been necessary, on account of this characteristic in myself,\nto push the inquiry on this point to the end, because the question of\ntelepathy between my mind and the medium, at any distance, is concerned in\nthe matter, though in that case there is no excuse for allusion to either a\ncurved cane with initials on it, nor to any other with such initials, for I\nown no curved cane, never carried any whatsoever until a few years ago,\nwhen I cut two in the mountains and had them made up. But there is\nnothing in the communications that would apply to me except the tendency\nto emphasise with a cane when talking in an animated way while carrying it.\n\u2014J. H.

We\nhad our own thoughts and anxieties together regarding this . . this .\nthis as J [ ! ] and Aunt Nannie also.\n(Do you mean she was anxious with you !) \\ Assent] he says yes.\n[This whole passage, started by the reference to going to church which I\nhad made in my letter, is in many respects a very remarkable one, though it\nwill not appear so evidential as is desired. But the expression, \" God bless\nyou, my son,\" is just what might be started in his mind by my referring to\nthe memory of going to church, especially if we assume what is here claimed\nto be the fact : namely, that the mind is not clear. But passing (his aside as\nuseless beyond the fact that it was his natural expression, though perhaps\ncqually natural to most mediums, the more striking incidents begin with the\nremembrance of the coach and \" the roughness of the roads and country.\"\nThe use of the word \"coach\" is not natural for father, as he did not use it,\nbut always spoke of such a vehicle in the country as a carriage. \" Coach \"\nwas a specific term for the vehicle of that name used in the cities. But\nwhen I wrote my letter to Dr. Hodgson I had in mind just the conditions\nhere described\u2014the rough country roads- though I thought specially of the\nalternative riding and walking which father, my brother and myself had to\ndo when it was too rough to take the carriage. I wanted to see if I could\ncall out some such facts and the place to which we went. The main object\nwas the latter, which would have been absolutely conclusive to any one who\nwould read the facts. It is not less remarkable to find my aunt Nannie\nappreciatively mentioned in this connection, as she was associated with this\nperiod of our lives, and father had every reason to be grateful to her for her\nkindness. My mother died in 1869, and Aunt Nannie came to keep house\nfor father, as she was his sister, and there were six of us to be cared for. I\nwas the oldest and only fifteen years old. She attended the United\nPresbyterian Church, to which father did not belong, and sometimes the\nnecessity of getting her to her own church at one place and the rest of us\nto ours at another was an additional reason for our going with father on\nhorseback. We took but one horse and alternately rode and walked. But\nusually the reason for this was the roughness of the roads and the necessity\nof walking at times to keep warm. When the weather permitted we took\nhorses enough for all of us. The roads were terribly rough. This was\nlong before the turnpikes were made, and the roads have been good in\nthat region for twenty-five years, so that the mention of the rough roads\n\fXLI.] Appendix II.\nis pertinent in the extreme for the time indicated. They were not rough\nin Indiana, whither he moved in 1889. It should be remarked that the\nstatements were made when I was not present, and that this is the first\nreference to specific facts in the State mentioned.\nThe perturbed state of mind indicated in regard to my brother George is\nvery interesting, and pertinent. The reference contains the thoughts of\nseveral years, and might be construed to apply also to many anxieties that\nhe felt about him in connection with my brother's care of father's property\nin the northern part of the State of Ohio. But the immediate time to which\nthis mention of him in connection with the principal of the school has refer\nence is an earlier period than the care of my father's property, though\nclosely connected with it in other relations than time, and what it means will\nbe seen when I have called special attention to the wonderful accuracy of the\nreference to Ohio. This was his native State which he did not leave until\n1889, and this is the first definite reference to it. It is perfectly coincident\nwith the mention of the roads and their roughness and the thought of my\naunt Nannie, whom I had suggested, and who had not been with him for over\ntwenty years. The transition to my brother is so abrupt that I can under\nstand it only as suggested by our going to church together, and this brings up\nall the memories connected with our lives. The name \"Bartlett\" when\nI first read it seemed to me to be a part of the nonsense of these experiments.\nBut when I re-read the record it occurred to me that it was the name of the\ntownship in which my brother lives. But on examination of a legal paper\nconnected with the property in that township, of which I am an executor,\nthe name is slightly different, though nearly like this, and if we allow for the\ndisturbance that might be caused by the difference of time between thinking\nthe sentences and writing them with the fact that the use of the word\n\"yet\" in the next sentence might have determined the writing of the last\nletters of the name \"Bartlett,\" we conjecture a possible importance in this\nword of very considerable evidential value. If the word had been\n\" Bartlow \" it would have been almost overwhelming in its suggestiveness,\nand this in spite of the irrelevancy about not having seen him yet. But\nthinking that father might have known such a man and corresponded with\nhim aboutthe northern land, as my brother George was here mentioned, I\ntook the occasion to ask my aunt Nannie, the only one likely to know\nanything about it, as she was closely associated with father in the ownership\nof this land, whether she knew of any such person and the possibility of\nather's connection with him especially re this land. Her reply is : \"As for\nyour question I never knew your father to have any dealings with a man by\nthe name of Bartlett, either in connection with the northern land or any\nplace else. I would have known if he had any connection with the land.\"\nThis strengthens the supposition that the name is an attempt to mention the\nname of the township, Bartlow, but it makes it more difficult to explain the\nirrelevance about his not seeing him, though true if it was a man he had in\nmind. I also suspected that Dr. Hodgson had not read the original rightly,\nand without telling him what it ought to be, as above indicated, I wrote him\nto send me the other possible readings of the original automatic writing. He\nsent me the original in answer to my inquiry, and there is only one reading\npossible for it, and this is the one given, namely : \" Bartlett.\" But putting\n2 L. 2\n\fJ. H. Hyshrp, Pli.D. [part\ntogether what I know of my father's anxiety about my brother both at the\ntime indicated in the next sentence and afterward, there is good reason for\nsuspecting an attempt, though it be a mere automatism, to give the name of\nthe township in which my brother lives. And this all the more if we\nsuppose it an attempt to indicate in this way what is forgotten or could not\nbe named in regard to the town itself. To see its possible pertinence1 let mo\nshow how any one might utter this when the name of the town is forgotten\nbut the name of the township remembered. Let it stand as follows. \" Do\nyou remember Ohio, James, Bartlow township?\" This is,\nof course, all conjecture, but it is possible, especially as it connects the\nmention of my brother, the two causes of mental anxiety here suggested,\nand the time involved in the incidents that I know.\n(If we suppose that there is a change in my father's thought after the\nword Bartlett we can make the whole passage intelligible on the ground that\nthe words, ''I have not seen him yet,\" are explained by their reference to\nthe principal of the school mentioned in the sentence that follows them\nThis suggestion wonld meet the difficulties which I raised in the following as\nwell as in the previous paragraph. May 29th, 11)00.\u2014J. H. H.)\nSince writing the above comments on the name Bartlett, it has occurred\nto me that another possible interpretation than the one 1 have given might\nbe made, especially on the hypothesis that what we get must be either\nautomatisms or mediumistic guessing. Father was very fond of Bartlett\npears, and indeed of pear culture, and had a large orchard of pear trees in\nOhio. As 1 said, he was very fond of the Bartlett pear, and tried to succeed\nin its culture, but his whole effort at pear culture failed. But it is only the\nassumption that we are dealing with automatisms that justifies this far\nfetched interpretation, and as the supposition that it refers to such a fact\nwould involve a time in his life somewhat separated from the time connected\nwith the other events considered here it is not to be considered as either\nsuggestive or important, but only one of those coincidences which should be\nmentioned for the benefit of critics and sceptics of this work. No interpre\ntation that I can put on it, considering the sentence after it, can make it\nperfectly clear that any of the possible meanings mentioned is true. It is\nthe large number of coincidental glimpses into events that are so pertinent\nto the case that gives the passage its force. There may, then, be no excuse\nfor even a possible reference to \"Bartlett\" pears except the hypothesis of\nautomatisms from a real spirit, which looks too much hke an attempt to see\nspiritism at all hazards in the case. But as mediumistic guessing could as\nwell explain such a conception as automatism we cannot purloin a spiritistic\ninterpretation for the sake of even making out a possible case. The context\nfavours either a nonsensical automatism or the interpretation given in the\nmain part of my notes.\nIt was my father's intention to send my brother also to college, and he\nhad him at the high school after I started to college. At first my brother\napplied himself to his studies as vigorously as I had ever done. But the last\nyear or more he gave up much of his time and interest to social life. His\nabilities were sufficient to enable him to do this without endangering his\ngraduation. But my father was afraid that this tendency would grow if my\nbrother went away from home to college, where ho was free from parental\n\fXLI.] 405\nAppendix II.\ninspection and influence, and my father went to the principal (this\nis the only word he would use) of the high school and talked the\nwhole matter of my brother and his work over with his teacher,\nand came to the conclusion that he would not send him to college.\nAfterward he talked the matter over with me, and I urged him to\ntry it, but he was inexorable, though it was a bitter trial for him\nto refuse it. It will be seen then that the reference here is particularly\npertinent and is naturally associated in the state of mind it repre\nsents with the lifelong interest and frequent anxieties he had about him.\nThe mention of this incident here also explains what he always had in mind\nin life when defending my brother against any derelictions of duty regarding\nthe care of the property. My brother went out to a perfect wilderness, and\nwhere there was no chance for civilised and cultivated persons like himself\nto get any proper social satisfaction, and though father lost some money in\nthe venture, the hard work of my brother and the sacrifices that his life\ninvolved in that region, after his high school education, always induced\nfather not only to pardon what he would have reprehended in a stranger\nmore severely, but also to apologise for him when any one else complained\nabout him. But with all his generosity and charity he was constantly\nworried with the affairs connected with the northern land, and often referred\nto my brother's education and sacrifices when we wrote or spoke of the\naffairs out there.\nThe expressed desire that I should not be troubled about him is also\npertinent, as he knew how many times I had been obliged to use his\nmediation in order to get my own affairs attended to at all. He always did\nhis utmost to keep me from misunderstanding the situation, and I have no\ndoubt that he worried more than I knew about, though I do know how my\nstepmother and aunts talked about the matter. The mention of aunt\nNannie again in this connection at the close is also very pertinent. It was\nshe with whom he most frequently corresponded about this property,\nespecially as she had by far the larger interest in it. She has often mentioned\nto me their correspondence on the management of things there, and I do\nnot know a more suggestive fact anywhere, taken with the others, than this\nsingular reference to her, as having a common knowledge and anxiety\nregarding my brother George.\nOn the whole I must consider this passage a strong evidential set of inci\ndents, though some of the gaps have to be filled in from my own memory, or\neven pieced out by tolerant interpretation. It is not as definite or objective\nas is desirable, and so cannot impress the reader as forcibly as it does myself,\nsince no one else can see the personal pertinence of the references and\nincidents as I can see them, though I think I have made tolerably clear the\npossibilities of their pertinence.\u2014J.

Did you remind James of my cap ? (Yes.\nHe does not remember it.) Not remember it ? Ask Nannie.

I cannot remain.\n+ Friend, it would be useless to hold him longer. (Yes.)\n[This continued reference to his cap is interesting, and this time it comes\nwithin the reach of possibilities. I said in a note the first time it was men\ntioned in my last sitting on the 27th of December, that I knew of no such\ncap, and did not think it possible that he ever wore one. My note on the\nsecond mention of it explained a further attempt to get at some meaning to it.\nI had before this, and after returning home from my sittings, written to my\nstepmother asking her if father had ever worn a cap. The following letter\nwhich I received in reply I interpreted, as did my stepmother, to mean that\nhe was not in the habit of wearing a cap, and hence I treated the matter as\nof no consequence. Several other questions were answered in the same\nletter and I quote from it. \"Your note of January 2nd and 3rd received\nto-day and in answer to your inquiries I will say, first, your father never\nwore a cap since we were married except once, and that was during very cold\nweather in '95. He was in the habit of sleeping with his head covered in the\nbedclothes, said his head was cold on top. I thought it was bad for him to\nbreathe that way, and made a knit cap for him to wear in bed, but it would\nnot stay on, and he never wore it more than one night. Never wore a cap\nof any kind in daytime.\"\nI took this as sufficient to condemn the reference, but it has occurred to\nme since this frequent reference to the cap that the wish in life to have some\ncovering for his head, which was very bald and which suffered from the cold,\nmight here crop up as an automatism. This possible interpretation is borne\nout here by the very pertinent allusion to his separation from me for some\ntime in the West. This is correct, and I think my correspondence with my\nstepmother shows me sufficiently ignorant of many of his things and habits.\nThis reference to Nannie is interesting, especially as he does not say \" aunt \"\nin it. It is not pertinent to her at all, but if the name were correct it would\nmake the incident very evidential, as can be seen from the contents of the\n\fXLI.] 407\nAppendix II.\nletter just quoted. The use of \"aunt\" in several references containing the\nname Nannie and the omission of it in the two or three cases where my step\nmother is concerned suggests that Rector did not catch the name l ightly. The\nright name may come out later, and if so it will explain this inadvertence. (Cf.\npp. 47, 69 -74). In the meantime the correctness of the allusion to the separ\nation between us in connection with the recognition that I do not remember the\ncap is an interesting fact when I am told to ask one about it whose name might\nbe mistaken in this complex process for that of my stepmother.\u2014J.

Hyslop, Ph.D.\nLatest Notes to Appendix II. ; Sittings from Febrvarv 7th\nto 22nd, 1890.\nShort Beach, August 9th, 1899.\nNote 2ii. \u2014Some time ago a suggestion occurred to me in the use of the\nword \"camp\" in the above statements that permits a conjecture here that\nillustrates what is possible in this rase, and it is not so violent a hypothesis\nas the absurd one which I rejected in my first note because I was not willing\neither to entertain or to state it. I do not hold that the one I am going to\nstate now is at all probable, but that, in consideration of the nature of these\ncommunications, as already remarked in some interesting cases of confusion,\nthe supposition is either possible, or serves to show how near the actual truth\nthe statements are. The conjecture did not occur to me until I became more\nor less aware of the fact that in these communications there was often an\nassociative connection between one message and the following. Having\nremarked this, and noting how nearly the word \"camp\" was to being a\npart of the name of a place. Champaign, which my father, mother, sister\nAnna, an aunt, and myself visited on the trip out West alluded to just\nbelow, I determined to ask the only person living who could know, whether\nwe had taken our trip to Chicago and the lake, which I remembered we took\nas a fact at that time, after leaving this town. Her reply, that of the aunt\nwho accompanied us on that trip, received this morning, is that we went to\nChicago and the lake after leaving this town. My stepmother writes me\nthat father often talked to her of this very trip, mentioning the name of the\ntown whenever he alluded to the trip. The facts then in favor of interpreting\nthe reference as I conjecture it are as follows. (1) That it was in 1861. The\nphrase \"some years ago\" may be taken as distinguishing between recent\nand remoter events. (2) That the trip can properly be described as \"a\nchange \" or pleasure trip, though incidentally business connected with some\nland was associated with the trip. This, however, concerned only some\nfencing and minor mutters. (3) That we visited Lake Michigan and Chicago\nat the time, making a special journey down to the lake shore while in the\ncity. (4) That the trip was made after we left Champaign, supposing that\nthere was some confusion here in getting the word Champaign, so that it\nbecomes \"camp.\" (5) That father very often talked to my stepmother\nabout this trip. (fi) That the message about the trip is closely connected\nwith the direct mention of a \" trip out West.\" (7) That the use of the word\n\" one \" in this very next message about a trip out West ap]Kirently to distin\nguish between more trips than one, several having been made previously on\nbusiness, is evidence of an associative nexus between the two messages. (8)\nThat the doubt expressed in the phrase \"we or I\" in the second message\nand connected with the accident involves the same distinction as I have just\nmentioned between the two communications. (9) That the very frequent\nconfusions in these messages which have an undoubted half significance at\nleast render the reconstruction possible, whatever we may think of its\nprobability.\nBut the facts against the interpretation are : (1) That we did not go to\nthe mountains in this or any other trip, but to the prairies in Illinois. (2)\nThat it was not after leaving any camp. It was after leaving Champaign.\n\fxu.] 409\nAppendix II.\nIn order that the reader may see how nearly the passage is to being\nabsolutely correct I may be allowed to reconstruct it somewhat with the\nimaginary confusion that ends in \" mountains \" and \" camp.\" If we assume\nanything like the trouble that was manifest in the guitar incident (Cf.\np. 461) the following is conceivable. \"I am thinking of the time some\nyears ago when I went into [Father says 'Illinois.' Rector does not under\nstand this, and asks if he means 'hilly.' Father says, 'no ! prairies.'\nRector does not understand. Father says, 'no mountains.' Rector\nunderstands this as 'No! Mountains.' and continues.] the mountains\nfor a change with him, and the trip we had to the lake after we left\n[Father says, 'Champaign.' Rector understands 'camp,' and continues.]\nthe camp.\" The name of the town is usually pronounced Sluimpaue, and\naccording to my stepmother my father so pronounced it when living, though\nmy own recollection is that he often pronounced it Campane. But of course,\nwe do not know the various tendencies to error which occur in the trans\nmission of such messages. Com1wre with this the mistakes of \"New\" for\n\"Ewen\" (p. 631), \"regicide\" for \" reconciler (p. 631), \"idle\" for \"Italian\"\n(p. 631), \"motion\" for \"emotions\" (p. 629). \" murder \" for \" weather \"\n(p. 631), \"turnips\" for \"guantlets\" (p. 627). I do not present the above\nreconstruction, however, as probable, but only as an indication of what\nis possible, and wish to be very cautious even in suggesting such speculative\npossibility.\nBut the right to reconstruct such messages is at least illustrated, if not\njustified, by such incidents as occurred in connection with Question 7. p. Bi0,\nin my experiments on the Identification of Personality. (Cf. also pp. 608-\n614.)\u2014J. H. H.\nNew York, July 10th, 1899.\nNote 27. \u2014On June 27th I read these sittings over to my stepmother, my\nsister, and my brother Frank, and found that several things which were\neither not remembered before or were denied are true after all. This fact\ncame out in each case in an interesting way and without suggestion from me.\nI assumed that the case was closed against the incidents, but the spontaneous\nremarks of one or the other of the persons to whom I was reading the account\nfurnished information that I had neither expected nor asked for. In one or\ntwo cases I asked a question, having forgotten what had been told me, and\ngot an answer which showed that the record was true. Of course my\nquestions by correspondence did not show the context and connection, and it\nwas natural that the incident whose confirmation or denial I sought should\nbe misunderstood. But when the whole narrative was seen the case became\nquite different. Hence some of the statements now contradict those formerly\nmade. On cross-questioning my relatives and reminding them of their\nformer statements to the contrary, they still adhered to the last statements\nand remarked that they had misunderstood the questions put to them before.\nMoreover the incidents recalled were so minutely described that I could not\nrefuse the preference to the later narrative and confirmation. I had, of\ncourse, to be very cautious about this as such a change of conviction is liable\nto suspicion, but as the confirmation was against the natural prejudices and\ndisposition of my mother and sister I had only the danger of suggestion on\n\f410 [hart\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nmy own part to overcome, and in most cases at least this danger was avoided\nby an indirect question and in some cases by receiving spontaneous state\nments that were not answers to my inquiries, but unexpected verifications of\nthe record, or confirmation of facts not clearly put in the record.\nThe first of these incidents was the one that was mentioned in the sitting\nof February 8th to Dr. Hodgson, and this was immediately followed by\nanother of very considerable interest. I had asked my stepmother whether\nfather had any trouble with one of his eyes and received a negative reply,\nbut when I read the passage referring to the trouble in the left eye and\nremarked that she had denied it before she said : \" Well, I do not remember\nthis, but it was true that he had some trouble with it. He used often to\ntake off his spectacles and complain that there was something the matter with\nthe left eye. He would rub it and complain that he could not see with it.\nBut he never doctored for it.\" The fact is a priori probable, as I had noticed\nthe last few years of his life that the disease with which he suffered was\ngradually making inroads upon various parts of his system.\nWhen I read the passage about the \" peculiar mark which you will recall,\netc.\" my stepmother made the same reply that she gave to my letter some\nmonths before, but went on to say spontaneously and without suggestion or\nfurther question from me, that father did have a mole on the left temple\nnear the ear and in front of it. I do not myself recall this, or that I ever\nknew it. My father wore a beard, and this mark, which was a very slight\none, was not likely to be easily noticed, especially as I had seen him very\nlittle since 187'J. The corroboration would be complete in this instance if it\nhad not been for the mistake of referring the mark to a place behind the ear.\nBut it is remarkably interesting to see two incidents, one strictly correct and\nthe other nearly so, in the same breath, as it were, and with the associative\nunity that would be natural to one trying to prove his identity.\u2014J. H. H.\nShort Beach, Conn., July 25ffc, 18!M.\nNote 28. \u2014I have ascertained an interesting fact that shows the allusion\nto morphine more nearly correct than my first note implies. On reading\nfather's letters over I find in that for April 27th, 1896, that father states to\nme that he was taking strychnine and arsenic at the same time that he was\ntaking Hyomei. Now this arsenic is not morphine, but it is a poison that\nwas very closely associated in father's mind when living with the common\nclass of poisons, and it might be a natural mistake to make here in mention\ning it instead of arsenic. Of course, the evidential feature of the case is lost\nin any event, but as a mistake it is more easily accounted for by the fact that\n1 have mentioned than it would be on the supposition that it was more false\nthan it is. That is to say, it is more like a mistake of memory than a mistake\nof fabrication.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 29.\u2014The second incident which unexpectedly turned out to have\nconsiderable interest and importance related to the name Cooper. I had\nreferred to the name because I thought that, if Dr. Hodgson would get\nthe answer that I wanted (see sitting of .June 1st) the incident would try\ntelepathy very severely. But, as my notes show, I was not only ignorant of\n\fXLI.] 411\nAppendix II.\nany relevance in the statements made by the communicator, but I did not\neven remark that the communicator actually distinguished between the\nCooper that I had in mind and another whose name 1 either never knew or\nhad wholly forgotten. I merely read the passage to my stepmother and\nremarked the absurdity of its pertinence to this Samuel Cooper, with which\nshe agreed, but, all unconscious of the light she was throwing on the record,\nshe said that father was a warm friend of Dr. Joseph Cooper, of Alleghany,\nthat he often spoke of him and that he probably had some correspondence\nwith him at one time. She distinctly recalls the last occasion on which my\nfather referred to him. It was one of the meetings of the United Presby\nterian Assemblies, which father would attend when it met in his home city.\nHe pointed him out to her, but as they had grown widely apart in then-\nreligious views, which were always different, he did not speak to him at this\ntime. Unfortunately all my father's correspondence was destroyed about two\nyears ago, except such as pertained to his business affairs, and it is impossible\nto corroborate the statement that he had corresponded with this Cooper on\nreligious matters. My two aunts do not remember either father's friendship\nor his correspondence with the man. This is not surprising, because what\never relations my father may have had with this Dr. Cooper occurred about\nthe time of the Union of 1858 when the United Presbyterian Church was\nformed, and it was at that time my two aunts separated from father on\nreligious matters. This Dr. Cooper, I am told by one who knew him well and\nwho is a theologian of some rank in that church, was very conservative,\nthough more liberal than father. This would attract him to father on ques\ntions connected with the union of the two churches, and I can conjecture\nthat the fact would give rise to father's desire to know how so conservative a\nmind could go into the Union at that time. Father had intelligence enough\nto worry any theologian very much if he was not strictly logical or sincere,\nas many a one could testify. I have no doubt that if I could recover this\nalleged correspondence, I would find that it related to questions connected\nwith that Union which father could not accept and whose acceptance he\ncould not understand in men professing the beliefs of Dr. Cooper. This Dr.\nCooper remained conservative in everything but the question of instrumental\nmusic, and astonished and offended his old friends a short time before he died\nby accepting the new tendency toward its introduction into church worship.\nIn the absence of testimony and correspondence, therefore, these facts may\nindicate the possibility of correctness in the statements of the communicator,\nespecially when we discover, in a later sitting (p. 420) the pertinent refer\nence to a school which had been built as a memorial to this Dr. Cooper.\nThe allusion to \" tokens\" on February 22nd (p. 397) in connection with\nthe name Cooper has considerable interest. My father belonged to a small\ndenomination, the Associate Presbyterian, which practised what is called\n\" close communion\" and hence used these tokens, little oblong metal pieces\nof a coin-like character, to indicate the person's right to participate in the\ndispensation of the bread and wine in the communion service. The\nimprobability that they should be mentioned by chance is clear from the\nfollowing facts :\u2014\nThe denomination consists of about ten or twelve ministers and perhaps\nnot more than a thousand communicants. There are perhaps fifteen or\n\f412 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nmore separate congregations. There is not one of these east of the\nAlleghany mountains. They are all in the Mississipi valley. One of the\nbest informed ministers in it wrote me that this denomination, the Associate\nPresbyterian Church, was the only one in this country that used these\ntokens in communion services, others that were conservative using only\ncertificates or cards. \" Open communion \" is the general practice and hence\ncertificates even are limited to one or two denominations.\nThe tokens are placed in the hands of an elder or member of the\n\" Session \" for safe-keeping in the interval between communion services,\nand there are not more than fifteen or twenty persons in the United States\nof whom it can be said that they have had these tokens. My father was an\nelder in this church and was always entrusted with the keeping of them.\nWhen the little congregation to which he belonged in Xenia, Ohio, of\nperhaps not more than twenty or twenty-five members, was disintegrated by\nthe death or emigration of its members, father kept these tokens in a little\nchamois skin bag, and I obtained them as mementos after his death.\nThe most interesting part of the reference to them, however, consists in\ntheir connection with the name Cooper. The use of tokens was never\nconsidered as essential to religious belief or practice. l?ut those who still\nclung to their use did so on the specific ground that the abandonment of\nthem would relax allegiance to the more important features of religious\nceremony. A good many questions of this sort were warmly discussed in\nthe settlement of the terms of union between the Associate Presbyterian and\nthe Associate Reformed Churches to form the United Presbyterian Church\nin 1858, which my father declined to enter, owing to his conservative beliefs.\nIf father ever had any correspondence with this Dr. Joseph Cooper, it was at\nthis time and most probably concerned such questions as are implied in the\nuse of tokens. Father and Dr. Cooper differed on these matters, as is\nindicated by the different directions which they took in their action at the\ntime. It is therefore very pertinent here to see the mention of these tokens\nin connection with a name that was very prominently associated with the\ncontroversies that were terminated by the formation of the United Presby\nterian Church.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 30.\u2014Since ascertaining the relevance of the statements with refer\nence to this Cooper, from the standpoint of the communicator, I may alter\nthe judgment previously expressed of some of the statements (p. 386).\nThe reference to the \"accident\" as soon as the name was given him is\npertinent enough, though it is not remembered by the only person who can\ntestify on the matter, my stepmother, whether any accident interrupted\ntheir journey on the occasion when they visited the West together. But it\nmust be recalled that an accident had been mentioned in connection with\nsome trip out West, so that any name that would suggest the West to the\nmind of the communicator might very well recall the incident of the\naccident, whether it ever took place or not.\nIt will be apparent also that the allusion to \"the old friend of mine in\nthe West \" takes on a new possibility in the light of the general relevance of\nthe message. It cannot be said that this Dr. Cooper lived in the West from\nthe standpoint of my father in his lifetime, because it was east of him that\n\fXLI.] 413\nAppendix II.\nDr. Cooper lived. It could be true as stated only from the standpoint of the\nplace of the communications, and this is hardly allowable except by straining\nthe interpretation. But if the communication is incomplete, the statement\nmight be connected with an attempt to speak of the Cooper School, an\nattempt, however, which did not succeed until a later sitting (p. 420). This\nwas \" in the West,\" but whether an imperfect message or not, the association\nof the name West with Cooper, in the light of the facts explained, is natural\nenough, even if confused and dreamy, so that I can recall the remark that it\nmight be a mediumistic trick.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 31.\u2014The next incident pertains to the hymn, \" Nearer, my God, to\nThee,\" on which I commented as opposed to the supposition that I was deal\ning with my father. I was explaining the absurdity of the incident and\npointing out that it, with some others, was flatly against the spiritistic\ntheory, as I read the record to my stepmother, when she emphatically\nagreed, and spontaneously remarked to confirm my judgment, all uncon\nscious that she was overthrowing it, that this hymn was especially disliked\nby father and that he very often expressed this dislike, remarking that he\ncould not understand how orthodox people could use a Unitarian hymn. I\nwas absolutely ignorant of this fact, and though I knew we had sung Moody\nand Sankey hymns for secular diversion to which father was not opposed,\nthinking, in spite of his objections to hymns, that they were better for\nsecular enjoyment than the usually vulgar songs of the neighbourhood, yet\nI do not recall singing this specific hymn and certainly have not the slightest\nrecollection of his prejudice against it. My stepmother's statement is abso\nlutely news to me. But it gives decided pertinence to the incident and\noverthrows my objection to it, and gives unity to the ideas connected with\nthe mention of Wesleyan Methodists a few moments before. Of course\nmediumistic associations could account for this association, but it would\nhardly account for the extraordinary pertinence of the allusion to this par\nticular hymn.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 32. \u2014Having observed some traces in the record of statements\nwhich were probably mere thoughts or intentions in the life of the com\nmunicator, and having ascertained from my stepmother that father had\nnever used any of Munyon's Catarrh Remedies, it occurred to me to ask her\non this visit whether father had ever talked about Munyon's catarrh\nmedicine, and the answer was that he had often mentioned his intention\nto get it, having seen it advertised in one of the Philadephia papers. But\nhe never bought it nor used it. It will be apparent, then, that there is at\nleast a half pertinence in the incident, at least sufficient to prevent it from\nhaving a direct negative value.\nTo verify this statement that possibly father had seen an advertisement of\nMunyon's Catarrh Remedy in the Philadelphia paper which I knew he took\nI examined the columns of this paper for the years 1895 and 189(i, the\nperiod covering the serious nature of his illness, but I did not find a single\nadvertisement of this medicine. I found, however, three advertisements of\nwell-known catarrh remedies, Aerated Medication, Johnston's Liniment, and\n\f414 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nHyomei. These were advertised iu a very conspicuous manner, and it is\nmore than probable that they were seen and talked over between my father\nand stepmother. In fact it is possible that the impulse to try the Hyomei\nmay have been awakened by the advertisements in this paper, and it is also\npossible that my mother's memory errs only in regard to the particular\nadvertisement about which they talked, since my brother is very positive\nthat father did see an advertisement of Munyon's Catarrh Remedy in a\ncircular, and not in this paper. Munyon's Catarrh Remedy has been widely\nadvertised in various ways. If my brother's memory can be trusted, and my\nstepmother thinks him correct about it, the conjecture regarding the possi\nbility that we have an automatism here somewhat like the expression, \"Give\nme my hat and let me go,\" has its conceivability.\u2014J. H. H.\nNew York, Novetnber 8th, 1899.\nNote 33. \u2014In order to ascertain all the probabilities in this matter and\ntest the accuracy of my brother's memory as against the proved mistake of\nmy stepmother, I wrote to the Munyon Company asking whether they had\never distributed circular advertisements of their Catarrh Remedy over the\nWest, and in particular the .State of Indiana. I was careful to explain that\nI had no wish to pry into private business matters, but only to test the\nmemory of a person who said that they had done so. The reply is as\nfollows :\u2014\nPhiladelphia, November Uh, 1899.\nProf. J. H. Hvsi.op, Columbia University, N.Y. City.\nDear Sin, \u2014We are in receipt of your favour, and beg to reply that we do\nnot care to answer your questions, as we never furnish information in regard\nto our business methods outside our office. We regret that we are unable to\nafford you this courtesy, and remain, very sincerely yours,\nDiet, by H. H. C. Munvon's H. H. R. Co.\nW.\nThe only facts of weight in the case are that my stepmother remembers\ndistinctly enough that father had talked of getting this medicine, and that\nmy brother confirms this fact, while the memories of the two are at variance\nabout the source of the suggestion to father, with a preference for my\nbrother's memory in my judgment, especially as the advertisements in the\npaper mentioned by my stepmother pertained to his disease and could easily\nbe confused in her memory with the one she here alludes to. The ease is\ntherefore at least sufficiently indeterminate to prevent the use of it for the\ntheory of fabrication. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 34.\u2014I found also in the sitting of February 20th that the allusion to\na round and a square bottle was less false than my original note indicates.\nMy stepmother still insisted that he kept no such bottle as a square one on\nhis desk. My sister did not remember anything of the kind, but my brother\nFrank, who was at home at that time, says emphatically and without positive\ncontradiction by either of the other two that father kept beside his round\nnk bottle also a square mucilage bottle on his writing desk. But none of\n\fXLI.] *15\nAppendix II.\nthem remember whether he put his spectacle case on this desk beside the\nbottles. They do emphatically say that he did not keep the tin spectacle\ncase there, and that it was not his custom to use the other leather case very\nfrequently. He may have put it on this desk at times. \u2014J. H. H.\n[Further inquiries while reading the proofs also show that my father had,\nand quite constantly used, a writing pad, my first inquiry having been mis\nunderstood from the way I put it. Also, there were a number of little\n\"rests,\" not exactly pigeon holes but shelves, so to speak, in the desk, and\non one of these the writing pad was kept when not in use. There also were\nplaced the various odds and ends, among them the usual implements and\nmaterial of a desk (i.\/. p. 379). No one seems to remember whether father\never placed the paper cutter or knife on these \"rests,\" but only that he\ncarried it in his vest pocket. But as it was given him solely for opening\nletters, and as he indisputably left everything else, hardly excepting the\nleather spectacle case, on these \"rests,\" it is possible that he often left the\npaper knife there with his letters and pen. (June 11th, 1900.) J. H. H.]\nNote 35.\u2014The incident about the cane or \"stick\" mentioned in the\nsitting of February 22nd, especially when compared with that in the sitting\nof June 8th, appears to have considerable interest. Without asking any\nquestions at all about it, I happened to see standing in the corner of the\nroom an old walking stick which had been broken and then mended with a\ntin \"ring\" about it. I asked if this had been father's cane, and received\nan affirmative reply. I asked how it had been broken, and was told by my\nbrother Frank that the break was caused by prying with it. The tin sheath\nabout the stick to about four inches long. The cane was a curved handled\none that had been given father by his brother-in-law, who had lost the\nstraight ebony cane with the initials on it that had been given him by us\nchildren. But unless we allow for confusion in the effort to indicate what\nwalking stick was meant in this case and for omissions in the communication,\nthere is some discrepancy between this incident and the statement made on\nJune 8th. If we can suppose father to have made the attempt to distinguish\nbetween the ebony cane and the curved one I gave him, on the one hand, and\nbetween the two curved canes on the other, the incidents obtain a most\nextraordinary interest and importance. This broken cane I had, no doubt,\nknown at one time before it was broken, and also I must have known that it\nwas broken, because my aunt gave me the money to buy the one I gave him,\ntelling me that the one he was using was broken. But I had not seen it in\nthis broken condition, and had absolutely forgotten what I had been told\nabout it.\nA little reconstruction will show how nearly right the sentence is in which\nthe statement is made about carving his initials on the curved cane. This\ncane was given him by his brother-in-law for the straight one with his initials\non it given to him by us children and lost by this brother-in-law. If then\nthe sentence had read : \" Do you remember the stick I used to carry with\nthe turn in the end, which was given me for the one on which my initials\nwere carved in the end ? \" it would have expressed the exact truth very clearly,\nas my story shows, and there would have been no confusion about it .\u2014J.H. H.\n\f416 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nNote 36.- I was for a long time very much puzzled by the description\nof various movements attributed to my father in connection with the cane.\nFrom one expression I supposed that there might be a reference to the act\nof breaking it. But as this would not apply to all the incidents I had to\nabandon the supposition. I therefore instituted more careful inquiries into\nfather's habits in the use of the cane and ascertain that the various state\nments may have immediate applicability to incidents well calculated to\nestablish identity. The \" thumping down,\" indicated by Rector's manner,\nmay apply to father's actual use of this cane to call my stepmother by\npounding it on the floor. He could not speak above a whisper, and if she\nwere in the kitchen he could not make her hear in any other way, and as he\ncould scarcely walk, owing to locomotor ataxy, it was the easiest way to\nattract her attention. There is, perhaps, some possibility that the allusion\nto a movement, described by Dr. Hodgson as like the motion of the hand\nin wiping out a basin, may refer to a playful trick of my father when he\nwas in the mood for it. He would hook the handle of the cane about my\nstepmother's arm or neck and watch her try to extricate herself. The cane\nwould naturally drop on the floor when she succeeded. His cane was con\nstantly in his hands and he used to roll or draw it across his knees. He was\nalso in the habit of keeping time with it to music, and when in meditation\non some subject. There is thus much in his habits to suggest some pertinence\nin these apparent allusions to them. They were habits entirely unknown to\nme.\u2014J.

H. H.\nJune 1th, 1899.\n2 K\n\f418 [PAKT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nIntroduction.\nI noticed the usual physical indications of the on-coming trance\nwhich it is not necessary to detail here, further than to say that the\nchange in the expression of the face compared with the normal condi\ntion seemed very marked. There was what might be called a very\nslightly bloated appearance to the face, the face looking less muscular,\nas if having less tonicity, though not in any way swollen. The lips\nand mouth were slightly drawn as the trance approached. The cough\nwhich at first seemed to trouble Mrs. P. lost its tendency to manifest\nitself, as if the trance condition relieved her throat of irritation, and it\nwholly disappeared when the trance was completed. There were\nseveral occasions in the on-coming trance when the eyes assumed a\nfixed and upward gaze until the lids began to droop. There was a\nslight twitching in the muscles of the cheek and hand, in the latter, as\nusual, before the writing began.\u2014J. H.

The allusion to it seems to imply that it\nwas one of the medicines which I had asked for at an earlier sitting. But\nwhile it is a medicine with which I am familiar, and which I have often used\nmyself, it was not what I asked for, nor was it among the medicines which\nmy father used for his disease. But the singular fact is that I had sent the\nspectacle case and contents to Dr. Hodgson in an old Maltine box, and this\n\fXLl.] 419\nAppendix III.\nbox was on the floor out of which the spectacle case was taken a moment\nafterward.\u2014J.

James, if you will wait you\nshall know all. Believe me I will in time recover fully.\n[I saw in this allusion to my going to a certain place evident indications,\nor at least a coincidence capable of interpretation of such indications, that I\nwas with some \"younger men\" in connection with this subject. I recalled\nat once an occasion in New York some weeks ago when I addressed the\nyoung men of the Graduate Club on psychical research and recounted in full\nthe facts of my former sittings. I felt the occasion very strongly and the\nmen showed much interest in the account. But it did not occur to me that\nthe allusion might be to a system of experiments which I instituted immedi\nately after my sittings and on my return to New York to imitate the Piper\nphenomenon. I had frequently to explain them, their purpose, meaning,\netc., to the young men with whom I conducted them. I also frequently\nmentioned my experiments with Mrs. Piper to these men, and so quite con\nstantly had my father on my mind. It is strictly true that the \"young\nmen\" are not \"light,\" that is, mediumistic, though it is interesting to see\nthe real or apparent supposition that I was in some way endeavouring to get\ninto communication with my father, and the correct statement that I could\nnot expect to do it in this way, if the Piper experiments are a test of its\npossibility.\u2014J.

When I saw the word \"doctor\" written I thought of father's\nold family physician who died long ago. But the reference to his peculiar\nviews about religion turned me off upon another physician who had the\nreputation of being an arch sceptic. But then again as soon as the mention\nwas made of the long talks, the passage taking time enough for the writing to\nenable my thoughts to change, I saw clearly that this was not the man\nmeant, as I knew my father never talked to this physician on religion,\nwhile his old family physician was of the same religious conviction as my\nfather. The long talks and peculiar views of religion, however, at once\nsuggested the name of another physician (Dr. Harvey McClellan, whose\nname was apparently attempted towards the end of the sitting) with whom\n1 know my father did talk on this subject, and I remember that my father\nand aunt used to condemn his more liberal views very heartily. \u2014J.

The reference to the church and the talks\non religion, especially when characterising them as peculiar, confirm or\nsuggest this interpretation more strongly than the first one. This dentist\nwas a Unitarian. My father admitted his intelligence, but could not agree\nwith him on religion, and had many talks with him. (Cf. Note 74, p. 523)\n(April 24th, 1901.)\u2014J. H.

As soon\nas I saw Torn written I thought of an old negro whom father often employed\nin the harvest field and with whom he used to have much fun. But I was\ncompletely surprised when the statement came, \" I mean the horse,\"\npossibly as information to Rector, who perhaps was puzzled at first to know\nwhat the passage meant. The question should have ended with \"what he\ndid with him.\" \"Tom\" was the off horse of a favourite pair of father's,\nwho had served him so well that he would never part with them but resolved\nto keep them until they died. \" Tom \" was excitable, though not dangerous,\nworked too hard and was wind broken. Just how and when he died I do not\nknow, as his death occurred after I had left home and neighbourhood for\nteaching, but I merely recall that a letter from some one of the family told\nme of the time and manner of his death. My impression is that my brother\ni The failure to get the name Carruthers correctly, at least eventually, was pro\nbably as much my fault as any one's, perhaps mine alone. When Rector gave the\nname \" Clark \" instead of \" Clarake \" I said, \" That's right,\" meaning that \" Clark \"\nwas the correct form for the apparent attempt in Clarake, and not that I recognised\nthe name as the correct one for my uncle. But my statement was calculated, unin\ntentionally, to make Rector believe that he had caught the name, and that it was\nright. It is interesting, therefore to note that in most instances during the later\nsittings the name of this uncle appears as \"Clarke,\" and only occasionally as\n\" Charles,\" which had been used for the name of this uncle until I called for the\ncorrect form here. Had I not used the expression \"That's right\" I might have\ngotten the name correctly, but the mischief was done, and I did not wish to preci\npitate such a time as occurred later when I asked for the correct name of my step\nmother.

Yes. I had for my feet. Cannot\nyou remember (When was this !)

Nannie is not the correct\nname here, though, if we interpret it as a mistake of Rector for the right\nname (Maggie, my stepmother), the intended reference would he pertinent.\n(Cf. p. 69, and Note 25, p. 365.) If she confirms this statement about the\nstool, it will support my interpretation of the name in this and in some\nearlier sittings.\u2014J. H.

I am now thinking of those\npictures ; where are they ?\nDo you remember a small cap I used to wear occasionally, and I left it I\nthink with Francis (R.

H.]\nOn reading this reference to my mother, and the names \"Ann\" and\n\" Anne \" while revising the proofs it flashed across my mind that my mother\nkept some pansies pressed in an old Bible. This recollection is very clear.\nI do not know who pressed them, and inquiry of my aunts and my living\nsister does not confirm my memory of them. But this sister was only seven\nyears old when my sister Annie died, and only twelve years old when my\nmother died, and is the only other member of the family that is in any way\nlikely to remember anything about the facts, as she alone has shown any\ndisposition to keep and protect my mother's relics and mementos of others.\nBut it was entirely characteristic of my mother to keep articles like pressed\n\f426 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\npansies, especially if they were the product of her deceased children or\nrelatives. It was she that was instrumental in having the hair wreath made\nfrom the locks of the family and dead relatives. Besides, she had preserved\nwith religious saeredness some little trinkets of a cousin who had been\na missionary in India. Hence, it is intrinsically probable that the incident\nof the pansies is true, but the late occurrence of the recollection and the\ncircumstances under which the recall was made, might suggest an illusion of\nmemory on my part, and I cannot press the significance of the incident.\n(May 25th, 1900.)\u2014J.

[Repeated.]\nI think you say, which Rob is it ! Well, Hyslop. (That's right.) I\nmean Rob Hyslop, of course ; which other . . other . . could I mean ?\n[This is the name of my brother, whom we always Killed Rob. instead\nof Robert. The explanation of it and the curious imputation that I should\nnot think of any other is very interesting. The evidence a little later seems\n\f428 [part\nJ. H.

[R. H. stops the writing by turning over the page.]\nDo not interrupt me when I am listening.\n(Oh I know.)\n[There is evidently much confusion in this passage. Robert is the\nname of my brother, but it does not fit the incident which I have been\ncurious to see from the time 1 began the sittings last December. The injury\nof the foot on the railway which cost the life of my uncle last fall was a\nsudden one, and his death was clearly alluded to in my second sitting,\nDecember 24th, 1898. This, too, is the uncle whose name cost so much\neffort in yesterday's sitting and failed. The linking of the name Robert with\nthe incident is a mistake, but I am not sure that it is a message from my\ncousin. It might be a question of Rector's to the party trying to communi\ncate. The answer to my statement referring to father's leg, he having\nsuffered for many years from locomotor ataxy, shows that my language was\nnot understood, but the allusion to the hurt foot and railroad is specific and\npertinent, if only it had been accompanied by the right name.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes, I know that, but it was not Robert, it was another name that has\nalready been mentioned.)\n(R. H. : Oh Lord !) [R. H. made this ejaculation as S. spoke rapidly,\nand R.

P. . . .\nYes, I am he.\n[This is interesting for the spontaneous recognition on the part of the\nwriter that the name was not correctly given, and for the equally spontaneous\ntrial to give it right. At this point apparently it is G. P. who interrupts\nand gives the name. [Cf. \" Hettie G. P.,\" p. 434.] The last syllable should\nbe \"AN.\"\u2014J. H.

What relation are you to me ?)\n[I asked the question to be assured of the communicator.\u2014J. H. H.] Your\ncousin. (That's right.) [This answer is correct.\u2014J. H. H.]\nHave you forgotten that, James ? [An interesting question.\u2014J. H. H.]\nI am a good soldier, don't you see I do not forget a comrade. [No special\nmeaning that I know in this language. \u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes. I remembered you well, but I wanted to be sure that I got the\nname just right.)\nOh I see. Well, that accounts for your not speaking to me when I came\nbefore with Uncle Hyslop. [See p. 422.]\n(Yes, that is right. Do you remember what I was doing when you saw\nme last ?)\nYes, you were writing, teaching, I believe. [Correct.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Don't you remember a meeting in which I spoke ?)\n[Much excitement.] Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. (R. H. : Calm.)\nbut I could not exactly remember just what it was.\n[This lapse of memory, if such it could be called, is natural enough, to say\nnothing of the general nature of the question I put. It would be most\nnatural for my cousin to think of me as teaching, and as he had been ill some\nmonths before his death and after I saw him at the meeting which he\narranged for me, my question might not suggest what was in my mind. On\nthe hypothesis of telepathy it ought to have been gotten. The recognition\nand excitement after my second question are very interesting, though it\ncannot be treated as evidential since we can suppose my question as implying\nits own answer.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(S. to R. H. : Want another pencil ?)\nAnd have you any knowledge of Merritt\u2014\n[I did not understand at the time the meaning of this name nor have I\nsince been able to ascertain any relevance in it (June 1st, 1900).\u2014J.

Do you U D. [A very pertinent remark\nif interpreted in reference to his disease.\u2014J. H. H.] (Yes. I understand.)\nI am glad it is as it is. (I am very glad you feel so about it.) And I want you\nto feel as I do. You are tired, James.\n[This is a correct statement and is interesting for the dogmatic character\nof it. I was very tired from hard work at the college in the work referred\nto below.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes, father, I have had some hard work with these communications and\ninvestigations. )\nbut do not make it hard, make it as you can easy.\nYou know how I used to talk to you about overdoing anything, and you\nwill remember your tireless energy. It is I, your father, who is speaking\nnow ; and how absorbed you used to get in your work, no matter what the\nnature of it was. Take my advice and don't do it, but be patient and work\nfaithfully ; the activities will go on after you are done there, do you hear\nme ? I . . . faithfully . . . activities.\n[The advice and comments here made by my father are very characteristic.\nThe most suggestive coincidental feature of it is the reference to the way he\nused to talk to me about my hard working. The word \"overdoing\" was\nespecially the term he used to employ. The same could be said of the word\n\"absorbed,\" and \"patient.\" He always advised me about being patient\nand more slow and deliberate in my work. He was so himself. Some of\nthe other remarks in this passage are suggestive either of what is going on\nwith him on the other side or of my work going on here. They have no eviden\ntial value, but they are curiously consistent with this whole phenomenon.\u2014\nJ. H. H.] [See Note 47, p. 503, and p. 313.]\n(Yes. I hear.

(Yes, father, I remember when you got hurt.)\n[Father was injured by some overwork in the harvest field, and the effect\nof it in a few years was to disable him entirely and to render him unfit for\nany labour whatsoever on the farm. It resulted in locomotor ataxy and the\nlife of an invalid for over thirty years. The injury took place when I was\nvery young and I do not remember being a personal witness of it. I was\ntold of it by father himself, and hence my language here is not meant to\nimply that I was a witness of the injury (Cy. p. 428).\u2014J. H.

(I\nremember a tire but I am not certain which fire you mean.)\nWe lived near, and, although it did not interfere, it gave me a fright. My\nthoughts are quite clear on this point.

Only he was not a preacher, and would never say\n\"Sunday.\" \"Sabbath \" is the word he always used, but the word Sunday\nmay have been due to G. P., who was apparently assisting (see below p. 434).\nI may also explain here more fully than I did in a previous note (p. 413)\nwhat significance may be attached to the term \" preaching.\" Corroborative\n\fXLt.] Appendix III. 433\nalso of my interpretation of the use of the word \"Sunday \" is the fact that\nthere was some delay both before and after the word. The church to which\nmy father belonged was a small one and could not afford to pay for regular\npreaching. The consequence was that we were often without it, perhaps\nnearly half the time, until it had, in his later days, to be wholly abandoned.\nBut very often\u2014if 1 remember rightly, always\u2014when there was no sermon,\nfather would gather his family about him on Sabbath mornings and say that\nas we could not go to church, he would read and comment upon a chapter\nof the Bible. He always expressly indicated that it was to take the place\nof a sermon. Morning prayers were often held in what we then called the\nkitchen, where we always ate our meals except when we had company. They\nwere often held in what we called the sitting-room, but what is usually\ncalled the dining-room by most people, and in which we often dined ourselves.\nEvening prayers were held nearly always in the sitting-room. But it is\ninteresting to remark that \"prayers\" is not the word that would be most\nnatural to him. He always spoke of the service as \" worship,\" or \" having\nworship.\".\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes. I remember them well.)\nThink there is one of the boys I have not yet mentioned, isn't there ?\n(Yes. I think so. Yes. I think you have not mentioned him very clearly.)\n^Vell, I was not sure, but I would like to reach to brother Robert myself\n. . . Robert cousin. [R. H. asks what the word is after \" reach to \"]\nDo not speak so fast, friend. If they spoke so fast here I could never tell\nthee anything.\nI would like to refer to brother Robert myself . .\nB R O (R. H. : \"brother\")\nReach . . Reach he said first, then refer . . refer.\nDo you know who I mean, James ?\n(Yes, father, I know very well.)\n[This pissage with reference to my brother Robert is a very remarkable\none. It turns upon the incoherence indicated by the words \"reach brother\nR)bert myself . . . Robert cousin.\" The name of my brother Robert\nwas given on December 27th, 1898, at my third sitting, but the name\nHyslop was not mentioned. In the earlier part of this present sitting\nboth names were given in full by my cousin R. H. McClellan, and it is\ninteresting to remark this because father at no time gave the last name of\nmy brothers and sisters. But here there is the recognition of the person\nwho had mentioned him before, his relation to me, his first name, the dis\ntinction between him as a person and my brother R,bert, and the desire to\n\"reach him myself\" in distinction from the previous message. Evidently\nthere was the usual difficulty in getting the name (McClellan) which had\nbeen given previously, and \"cousin\" was thrown in to identify him and\ndistinguish him from my brother. The mention of my brother in connec\ntion with the prayers is especially interesting, as father would often pray\nfor this brother as if his heart would break.\u2014 J. H. H.]\nI am glad you hear me so clearly. There is more than a million things\nI would like to speak about, but I do not seem to be able to think of them\nall, especially when I am here.

He has frequently referred to his\n\"library \" in earlier sittings, and on one occasion in those sittings it seemed\nto imply a room.

When\n\"Abbie\" was given I thought the intention was to give the name of my\nstepmother Maggie, but as soon as \"Hattie\" came I saw that it was my\nsister who had not yet been mentioned. The nickname Hettie is correct for\nher, though we never called her that, at least I never did so, and I know-\nsome of the others and her friends called her Etta.

The reference to God in the ]Missage is very characteristic,\nbecause when he found himself at a loss to explain any difficult matter he\nalways fell back upon his faith in an all wise and omnipotent God who would\nsome day make things clear.

It might, however, have been intended for the\nword relatives. (June 2nd, 1900).\u2014J. H. H.]\nI cannot hear it, speak slower.\nWell, go out then and come in again with it.\nAll right.\nYes, but I did not get what he said last. He said something about Lucy\n[?] LUCY, but it was not for thee, friend, [meaning not for R. H.]\n(S. to R. H. : I know. I know.)\nAnd he said it over and over the last time here.\n(Yes, is this my cousin speaking ?)\nIt is in father's place, and he will not return for a few moments.\nThe Lucy is not Jessie's sister, friend, [indicating R. H.] (R. H. : Yes,\nI understand.) [My assistant Miss Lucy Edmunds, has had communications\nfrom her deceased sister Jessie.\u2014R. H.]\nbut for the other friend, here.\n(Yes, I know. But what relation was Lucy to you ?)\nMother said it only a moment ago, and she is on father's side, and he\ncomes and speaks of her often. We .\n[See Note 54, p. 508.]\n(R. H. : Yes, Rector, kindly get George to state explicitly if possible who\nthis Lucy is.

We will see about it as both Annie and her\nfather have brought her here several times, and Aunt Nannie will know well.\n(I shall ask Aunt Nannie about it.) She is a cousin of thine, friend. Dost\nthou not hear? (Yes. I hear clearly.) But do not remember. (I remember\none cousin Nannie and one Aunt Nannie.)\nYes, she is. Aunt Nannie is in the body and cousin Nannie is in the\nspirit.

Well I shall inquire about that.)\nIt is as they say it, and it must he so.\nJames, don't you remember any . . . don't (R. H. : \" dost thou *' ?)\nyou remember her ?\n[The original notes on this complex passage, beginning with my cousin's\nreference to his relatives, have been expunged, owing to the fact that in this\ncase the retention of my perplexities about it has no value for the critic. I\nmay therefore substitute the explanation that later study gives it. I discuss\ncertain aspects of it in Chapter III. (pp. 231-235). The reference to Lucy\nexplains itself as the name of my cousin's wife, still living. But Rector's\nintimation to me that this Lucy was not Miss Lucy Edmunds is an interesting\npiece of intermission. The next message is not so clear. But I suppose it\nmeans that my cousin's mother had tried to give the name Lucy, and that the\nallusion to \"father's side \" means to explain to me that it was father's sister,\nwhom I never knew, rather than my cousin's stepmother, whom I had known\nand who was my mother's sister. My father had been the first to attempt to\ngive the name Lucy (p. 421). The reference to \"aunt Nannie\" coupled\nwith the statement that she was my cousin was perplexing to me, as the\nreader can well imagine, until I learned from my cousin's sister Nannie that\nduring his last illness, in which she had nursed him, he always called her\naunt in deference to the habits of his children. She is still living, as the\nstatement following indicates. The reference thus becomes clear. Also if\nwe suppose that the allusion to \" cousin Nannie \" in saying that she was \"in\nthe spirit\" is a mistake for \"cousin Annie,\" my sister, but the communi\ncator's cousin, the rest of the passage becomes clear. But the later answer\nto my question as to who this \"cousin Nannie\" was will have to be\ninterpreted from my point of view, in which the \" aunt Nannie \" above, the\ncommunicator's sister, is my cousin. Lucy is her sister-in-law, not her sister.\n(June 2nd, 1900).\u2014J. H. H.]\nI am your father who is speaking now.\nI do not seem to be able to express all I want, but I hope to do so\n. . .

Maria is the name of the wife of the John McClellan that\nI know. She was a Mitchell, and a Sarah Preston, who was brought up in\nthe Mitchell family and treated as a member of it, died in 1895 in the town\nin which this John McClellan lived, and it might be supposed that she was\npresent and interested in the reference to this John McClellan. Mary Ann\n\f444 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nwas the name of the sister of this John McClellan and was referred to below\n(p. 446). His wife, apparently referred to here, is still living, as the passage\nseems to indicate.

Whose foot\nwas hurt ?) F .lames it was Will's, I think Will's.\n[I cannot understand this incident of the injured foot. I never knew of\nany such injury to my brother Will. What I have been curious to have\nmade clear is the relation of the incident to the person to whom I supposed\nit referred. As I have already said, my uncle \"Charles \" (not correct name)\ndied recently from just such an accident on the railway, and noticing what I\ntook to be the confusion about it in the previous reference to it, I asked that\nit be cleared up here. But I am more in the dark than ever, because I have\nno memory of such an accident to my brother.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Well, I shall ask about it.) He got it injured, and so did I.

In a few\nmoments I remarked the open mouth, which soon began to appear\ndrawn, and then to mutter something quite inaudibly. This was soon\nfollowed by short quick breathing which lasted for only a minute or so\nwhen the head fell on the pillow as usual. There were then various\nchanges in the breathing which represented interruptions between short\nquick and more prolonged breathing until it lapsed into the breathing\nof deep sleep which resembled a snore just enough to suggest it but not\nto produce it. This became a little calmer as the writing began, though\nI noted afterwards that with change of control there was some\nresumption of the heavier breathing for a moment.\u2014J. H. H.\nJune 1st, 1S99.\n\fAppendix III. 447\nComments.\nThere was an interesting feature in this sitting which apparently\nshows a knowledge of the confusion that I have been unable to dis\nentangle in my notes of the previous sitting. The McClellan family\nseems to have been shut out from personal communications, and I was\nleft with my father who was superseded by my brother Charles and\nsister Annie when he left the machine. The sitting as a whole on this\noccasion is much clearer and less confused than the others. But the\nmost interesting feature of it is the manifest attempt to avoid the\nconfusion of the day before, the trance personalities actually stating\ntheir own knowledge of it and determination to prevent it. The\nwhole modus operandi of the sitting showed the effect of this resolu\ntion.\u2014J. H. H.\nRecord of Sitting. June Ut, 1899.\nProf. J. H. H. and R. H.\n[Rector writes.]\nHAIL (R. H. : Hail.

H. : Amen.)\n(Then Mrs. A. wishes the light to go to her for the sixth after coming,\n[hand moves as if to hear better] for the sixth after coming Sabbath, and\nspend the night with her and return here on the Sabbath to be ready for the\nnext day not yet settled.

H. : Good.)\n\f448 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\n(R. H. : Then . . . ) [Hand talks much with Sp.]\n(R. H. : Then Mrs. C. is apparently much anxious to know when she can\nsee you next. There would be the fifth after next Sabbath not yet filled.)\nWe feel that we have given so much help to Mrs. D. that it will not be\nnecessary for us to meet either Mrs. or Mr. D. after the next time. Con\nsequently if any inquiries are made from there kindly say it will not be\nnecessary for a time. U D.\n(R. H. : Yes.

Any further arrangements can be left till the day\nbefore the coming Sabbath.)\nYes, and better so.\n[Hand moves towards S. as if to ask whether he had anything to say.]\n(R. H. to S. : Say something.) (I am glad to be here this day.)\nHAIL. And to thee we return this day and no further arrangements\nwill be necessary at present, but rest thy body well until we return to thee\nafter coming Sabbath.\nAnd we wish to say that we were somewhat confused as [at ?] the closing\nof the last meeting owing to the light failing us. [This is a very interesting\nand true statement to be volunteered.\u2014J. H. H.]\nWe have also various friends of thine who are present, and at times more\nor less confuse us.

I am slowly recovering.\n[This stopping in the middle of the word \"which \" to insert the \" from \"\nabove the line, and then coming back to the right place and completing the\n\" which \" without trying to rewrite it, considering that Mrs. P. was not only\nunconscious, but had her head turned away, was a wonderfully interesting\nperformance. \u2014J.

But it is not\ncertain that this John McClellan was intended by the reference, especially\nas it is apparent that the communicator is governed by association in\nreferring to the incident of sending me to the university as \" another thing.\"\n(June 2nd, 1900.)\u2014J. H. H.] [Cf. Footnote, p. 472.]\nI am all right while + is near me, and my memory comes back to me\nclearer. I have given mention as you doubtless understand, to several\npersons, places, etc., which are not quite clear, and before I go on, if you\nwill refer to those which perplex you most I will do my best to correct them\nand perhaps I can recall some of them myself. I intended to refer to the\nMcLellen family one by one and keep all of their names quite [page turned\nwith the words of R. H. \"One moment please.\" Hand listens to R. H.]\n(R. H. : All right.) (S. : All right.) clear, but at times my head bothers\nme, and I have to return to regain myself. Do you remember our old home\nin the little town of C. ? [ ?]\n(R. H. : C, is that?)\nYes, and where I with Aunt Nannie lived after your mother [your inserted\nabove, between after and mother, after mother was written.] left us and we\nbrought you up.\n[This is an interesting passage beginning with the reference to \" our old\nhome.\" This very expression is consistent with the fact of his removal to\nanother State, alluded to as \"out West \" in earlier sittings. The letter C is\nnot correct for the name of the town possibly meant. The name of the\ntown was Xenia, pronounced \"Ze-nia,\"and we may suppose that Rector\ninterpreted the sound Z as the pronunciation of C (see), assuming, as there\nis evidence to believe, that phonetic analogies are admissible in this\nproblem. Father did not actually live \" in \" this town. My aunt Nannie\ndid. Our house was a few miles from it, but Xenia was our regular post-\noffice and was always referred to as our birth-place, etc. The statement\nthat my aunt Nannie lived with us, at this \" old home \" after my mother's\ndeath, is every word of it true, and the time relations are perfectly accurate.\n(June 2nd, 1900.)\u2014J. H. H.]\nI am in no way confused, but my mind is clear and I am very close [not\nread at once] to you and an . . close ...

The facts are too personal to be\nnarrated here, because of their unpleasantness. --J. H. H.]\nI also wanted Clarke for a mere recollection, not because I had any\nspecial interest otherwise.

H.]\n(Yes. Do you mean that he is on your side ?) He is here. [Correct\u2014\nJ. H. H.]\n(Yes. What brought him there t What brought him to your side ?)\nWhy do you not remember of his coming here suddenly, James ?\n(Yes.) [Correct about his sudden death.\u2014J. H. H.]\nIt was pneumonia. [Not correct. But it would be true of the uncle\nJames McClellan just previously mentioned.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes. I remember his sudden coming, but I wanted to see if something\nsaid about him before was what you meant.)\nWhat it was, due to it, and if I mistake not you remember it very well.\n(Yes. I remember it, but do not worry about it now. It will come\nagain. You can go on.)\nI only was disturbed because of the accident that I could not make clear,\nand Charles interrupted me somewhat because he had afever, and yet we are\nnot suffering with anything, don't think that, James, will you ?\n(No, I shall not, it is all right.)\n[The incidents in this reference confirm my interpretation of the real\nmeaning of the name Clarke so frequently mentioned before. The mistake\nof pneumonia is very singular, and it is interesting to see that there seems to\nbe some consciousness of the confusion involved in it. Also there seems to be\na half reproach administered to me for wanting him to tell me what I could\nbe supposed to know already, as if it were only the purpose of my experi\nments to deal with his own memories ; if not reproach there is evident\nwonder. If the word accident could be taken for all that it suggests in con\nnection with both my uncle's sudden death and the statements made about it\nin previous sittings, it would have special significance.\nThe statement that brother Charles had a fever is correct, as the notes to\nmy first and third sittings, December 23rd and 25th, 1898, quite clearly\n\fxu.] 45 1\nAppendix III.\nshow.

I am very glad to see you.)\nDo you remember when 1 came to this life, James ? (Yes, I remember\nvery well.) And did you know I did not see you ? (Yes. I think so.)\n[This last statement about not seeing me, and my answer, are not strictly\ntrue, but the former is near enough to the truth for me to give this answer in\norder not to introduce any confusion into the writing, as I thought a\nnegative answer might do. Some idea of how near the truth it is will he\nobserved when I say that I have but one distinct recollection of her. I\nremember on the evening of my brother Charles' funeral, he having died\ntwelve days before her, that as we sat down at the table to supper, Anna was\nstanding between the table and the door, and mother said something to her,\nI think, about coming to supper. She was perfectly well apparently at the\ntime, none of us having yet shown any symptoms of the scarlet fever. But\nshe replied to mother in a clear innocent tone, \" I am going to get sick and\ndie.\" The impression that the statement made on mother, with the\nawe and indefinable feelings which the death of my brother had excited in\nme, stamped the incident indelibly on my memory. I was eleven years old\nat the time. My sister was only four, I think, or thereabouts. I have\nrefused to look up the fact in order not to expose any more than is possible\nto the telepathic theory. But if I cannot now recall anything more than the\n2 a 2\n\f452 [I'.VKT\nH.

H.

All right, father, I wanted it for my scientific purpose.)\nOh, yes. Why did you not just remind me of it ? Well I will work for\nyou, and to remind you of other things quite as good. But don't hurry me,\nand in time I can talk to you just as I used to.\n[This whole passage regarding the incident I had recalled and the mental\nstatus indicated by the reply, though not containing evidential matter that\nmust impress the reader without elaborate explanation, is perhaps as impor\ntant as anything in my sittings. Let me first narrate the facts and then come\nto my purpose in suggesting it, with the comments that are necessary.\nI remember that one winter night some dog or dogs killed a number of\nour sheep, and the next morning we tried to track the dogs through the\nsnow to their homes. I took one track in one direction, and father followed\nanother in a different direction. But it happened that I was thrown off the\nfresh trail by an older one in the snow, I being too young and ignorant to\ndistinguish carefully, and failed to remark that the dog I had been set to\ntrace had turned off to his home at a certain point, the dog being Samuel\nCooper's. I followed the old trail to another neighbour's. But when father\nmade the search after me, he found my mistake, and as Mr. Cooper had seen\nme following the trail to another neighbour the fact prevented father from\nthrowing the blame unmistakably on the dog evidently at fault. Hence\nnothing could be done, I receiving some reproach for my carelessness. But\nlater in the spring the dogs attacked the sheep a second time. What\nfollowed this event I shall not describe at present, but add to the account if\nanything further is said about the matter. It will suffice to say at present\nthat the events that immediately followed were caused by the dissension be\ntween the two, they being immediate neighbours. (These incidents which\nI omit for personal reasons, and which were of a nature to impress my\nmemory indelibly were far more interesting than those that I have mentioned,\nto say nothing of the clearness with which they stand out in my memory.)\nKnowing how innocent my father was in the case, and how much he felt any\ndisagreement with his neighbours, it occurred to me that I might test his\npersonal identity by simply asking a question about Samuel Cooper, which I\nsent to Dr. Hodgson for one of his sittings. The confused and confusing\nresult has already been remarked. This was made \"worse confounded\"\nby the mention of John in connection with his name at the first of the\npresent series of sittings, May 29th, when I came later to suspect that this\nwas not the John Cooper for whom I thought it intended at the time.\nLater, however, I came to suspect that this John possibly referred to another\nperson, and all the allusions made to Mr. Cooper took on an entirely new\npossibility and import. I suspected this at the sitting previous to the present\none, and the statement that he, Samuel Cooper, \" was no relation of mine \"\nsupports this suspicion. It seems to imply that father expected me to ask\nabout my relatives only. But it is an interesting fact to see that he correctly\nstates that Samuel Cooper is not a relative of his, and the statement occurs\nin an interesting connection, though it is equally true of the Cooper\nthat he evidently had in mind all along. The whole passage is a fine\n\f454- [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nvrnisemblance of reality in conversation and thinking. The recognition, the\ncorrection, the wonder indicated regarding my question, and the final\nappreciation of my object are incidents in a unity of consciousness that is\nbeyond all simple explanation short of charity for the spiritistic theory,\nto say nothing of the two correct incidents in it, that about the discussion\nand the denial of relationship with the person named. The reader may reflect\non this incident when applying telepathy.\u2014J. H. H.]\nDo you remember where George used to go, and it did not please me very\nwell !\n(Yes, I remember. I remember it, and shall be glad to have you say all\nyou wish about it.)\nYou see the hours I spent over him and with him, the advice I gave him,\nand very little good at times.\n[This pissage is too indefinite for evidential purposes, but it expresses\nexactly my father's thought and actions in regard to a certain event, which,\nthough not reflecting on my brother unfavourably, was connected with his\nwelfare in a way that my brother may not have appreciated at the time. \u2014\nJ. H.~H.]\nI remember F R ank, and I also recall the time he caught the fish. Do you\nremember that Sunday ? [I know nothing of this. \u2014J. H. H.] (No, I do not\nremember it. But I think Frank will remember it.) Yes I refer to him as\nhe knew about it and the trouble it gave me. (Yes, I shall write to Frank\nabout it.) Can't you see him i Oh I see . . you will be going soon.\n[See Note 64, p. 51(i.]\n(Yes, that is right, that is right.)\nYes. Well, wait and ask him if . . as it will be better to ask .\nas, as, it will be better to ask him . . and the .\n(R. H. : Rather than write ?) [Assent.]\nMr. Hyslop says so.\n(Yes, I will talk to him about it.)\nAnd there was a place where he used to go and spend evenings, and both\nhis aunt and myself did our best to keep him out of temptation.\n(Yes. I am glad to hear that. You mean Frank I think !)\n[I know nothing of this incident. I left home before Frank was old\nenough to make social calls.\u2014J. H. H.]\nYes, I do mean Frank, but do you remember anything about War (Yes.\nI do. Go on.) and the mental anxiety I passed through at that time (Yes.\nI remember it very well indeed. ) and . . and my leg ! I am getting tired\nJames, will rest a moment and return.\n[This reference to the \" war,\" to the mental anxiety at that time, and to\nhis leg is profoundly interesting. Father was very strongly opposed to\nslavery and passed through a period of intense mental anxiety and fears for\nhis country at the time. He would probably have volunteered for the\nservice had not the injury to his leg which I have described in a previous\nnote rendered him unfit for a soldier. But near the close of the war, when\nhe could perforin a slight service as a soldier without risk to his health, he\nwent to aid in the prevention of Morgan's raid in Ohio. This service did not\nrequire any long marching, but only some militia duties.\u2014J. H. H.]\nThis is a very heavy atmosphere to be in.\n\fAppendix III. 455\nWhat about Aunt LUCY ? (Aunt Lucy who 1)\nCharles is speaking this, and he came here quite young . . young.\nShe was related to the other mother, wasn't she ?\n(Do you mean the mother on this side ?) Yes, I do. (Well, can\nyou tell what her other name is ?) John can as he knows her very\nwell. Ask him when he gets here, if that is you, James. (Very well. That\nis all right.)\nAnd what happened to the chimney after I left.\nDo you not remember ? (Yes. I remember it.) And wasn't it taken\ndown ? (Yes, I think so.)\nI heard father talking about it to mother some time ago ... I mean\nthe chimney, James. (Yes. Yes. I remember it very well.)\nWell, all right, I am not worrying about it, only I remember how cold it\nwas before I left.\nGoing out now.\n[We had no aunt Lucy, though at the time of the sitting I thought we had\na second cousin by this name. I can only suppose that my brother Charles\nmistook the relationship when trying to give the name of Lucy McClellan, in\nreality his cousin by marriage. The reference to her being related to\n\" the other mother,\" if it applies to my stepmother, is false, but it may be a\nconjecture of Rector's, as he apparently makes the previous statement. The\nstatement that John knows her very well is unverifiable, and indeed extremely\ndubious, though I admit it possible. (June 2nd, 1900.).\u2014J. H. H.]\n[The reference to the chimney is interesting, though I could hardly treat\nit as evidential if it came from my brother Charles alone, because he died\nmany years before the incident occurred. But it is peculiarly pertinent to\nhave it come thus indirectly from father and to have my mother connected\nwith it in this way, as it appears to be a story told her for information. Now\nthe facts are these. When we built our house in 18fi0 or 1861, the chimney\non the kitchen was not high enough to prevent the interference of the winds,\ncoming against the main part of the house or over it, with the draught in it\nnecessary to support the fire in the cooking stove. The consequence was\nthat, after trial, it had to be built up to reach above the second storey of\nthe house, and was a solitary chimney, perhaps twenty or twenty-five feet\nabove the roof of the kitchen. It did not give a very artistic appearance to\nthe house, but had to be endured. About 1884 a cyclone overthrew it, and\nit was rebuilt. The reader can determine the pertinence of the refer\nence, and more especially the form which it takes as having been told\nmother by father. She died long before the accident to the chimney. Are\nwe to suppose a consultation between them for something peculiar and\nspecially evidential to tell me ?\nThe allusion to the cold weather before he left is pertinent, as a note in\nmy first sitting shows. (C\/. p. 310.) My brother died in the winter when\nthe snow was on the ground.\u2014J. H. H.] [See Note 65, p. 517.]\nYes my son, all the medicine in the material world could not have kept\nme in it, as it was time for me to come. Go home, James, and see them all,\nand do not miss me, but try and feel if you can that I am somewhere near\nyou.\n(Yes, father, I shall feel that you are near.)\n\f45C [part\nJ. H. Hyrtop, Ph.D.\nAnd God keep you, as He always has, one of the best of sons. I can\nnow speak what I could not often say when I was with you there, but you\nnever gave me much anxiety.\n[Father did feel much concern for me during the \" Sturm und Drang \"\nperiod of my religious doubts, but it is probably true in every other respect\nthat he had little anxiety about me.\u2014J. H. H.]\nI seem to go kick to the old days more than anything else. Don't say\nyou wonder at this, that, and the other, but wait, be ]Kitient\u2014all sill will be\nclear to you some day. If I fail in my memory, do not say well if that is\nfather he must have forgotten a great deal. I really forget nothing, but I\nfind it not easy to tell it all to you. I feel as though I should choke at times\nand I fail to express my thoughts, but if fragmentary try and think the best\nof them, will you !\n(Yes. I shall try and think the best of them.)\nFrom day to day I will grow stronger while speaking, and then you will\nknow me as I am. (Yes, father, I think so.

Hyslop, or\nRobert Hyslop, when written in full. His name had already been given in\nfull at the sitting of December 27th. I suppose the intention here was to\ngive only the initials R.

Her request was apparently answered here by\nanticipation.

Now let me tell you one thing more and that is\nabout the little errors which I may make when speaking with you. I think\nmany things all at once and when I try to give mention to them I fail some\nwhat. Do you remember the school teacher I referred to a few days ago ?\n(Yes, I remember and shall be glad to have you go on.)\nHe has been more anxious to tell you what I had on my mind concerning\nhim.\n[This possibly refers to the incident told to Dr. Hodgson (sitting of\nFebruary 22nd). It is strange to see the statement that it was only a few\ndays ago. But the distinction in time coincides with what appears to be the\nhabit of alleged communicators in the Piper case. The statement here im\nplying that this teacher is not living is equivocal. I cannot tell whether it\ncomes from Rector or father. The sudden disappearance of father and\nappearance of my uncle makes it probable, perhaps, that it is Rector's state\nment regarding father's intention to free his mind regarding this teacher. I\ndo not remember the teacher's name, and do not know whether he is living\nor not.\u2014J. H. H.]\nHere is Clarke. (Good morning, uncle, I shall be glad to hear from you.)\nGive my love to N.\n[Hand tightens in excitement, and pencil is nearly forced out from\nfingers. R. H. lays his hand gently over it.]\nGive . . . [Sp.\u2014probably Imperator\u2014enjoins apparently, and hand\nbecomes quiet and bows.]\nGive my love to Nan.\n[The hesitation after \"Nan \" was written was an interesting fact. It would\nappear to have been more natural for my uncle to mention his widow Eliza.\nThere appeared to be in this hesitation a consciousness of a mistake, if the\npause can be so interpreted. But as he had mentioned his wife Eliza before\nmore than once it may seem a reasonable deviation here to refer to his sister-\nin-law, whose name is Nannie, the aunt Nannie of this record.\u2014J. H. H.]\n[Note 95, p. 536.]\nAnd let me think a moment. I am a little anxious first to tell you about\nyourself.\nI left so suddenly I had no time for anything. [Correct.\u2014J. H. H.]\n[Read incorrectly by S. R. H. reads correctly.] (S. to R. H. : I see.)\nI am all right now, only my head troubles me when speaking. Wh .\nWait for ine . . for me.\nAnd do you remember Rice (R. H. : Rice?) [Assent.] [Then hand\ndissents violently.] (R. H. : No.)\nYes . P i e ce [?] Pierce. I say Pierce . . D.\n(S. to R. II. : I don't remember him.) (R. H. to S. : Say so.)\n(No, I do not remember him, but you may say something about him and I\nshall enquire.)\nD R. Pierce. L i d i a L i d a . . LI . . L i d a.\n(Yes, I remember L i d a. What relation is she to me ?)\n\f460 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nAnnie and she are cousins, Lida Aunt. (Yes, which Annie is cousin of\nher ?) There is a sister Annie and a cousin Annie and aunt Lida.\nShe was an aunt to James Hyslop if I remember rightly and there is a\nsister in the body by that name. (Yes. Yes.)\n[I do not know this Dr. Pierce. I know a physician by a different name\nwho may have been my uncle's doctor. The name Rice came nearer what it\nis than Pierce. The physician in mind was also my father's doctor both on\nhis deathbed and when he lived in Ohio. (See Note 66, p. 517.)\nThe truth and confusion in this passage are most interesting incidents. I\nshall first state the facte, and we can then examine the difficulties. I have a\nsister whom we call Lida. My aunt, after whom my sister was named, and\nwho was the wife of the communicator and still living, was called Eliza.\nMy uncle in speaking of her and to her always abbreviated the name to Liza.\nMy sister, proper name Eliza, was called Lida for the very purpose of dis\ntinguishing her from this very aunt. From my uncle's habit, therefore, of\nabbreviating his wife's name to Liza, and from the proximity of the two\nnames in the message, we can understand the form that my aunt's name\ntakes in the writing. If a similar mistake occurred in the reference to\n\"cousin Annie\" I can interpret it as intended for \"cousin Nannie,\" the\nsame Nannie that appears in the communications of my cousin R. H. McClellan,\nshe being the latter's sister and also a frequent visitor and intimate friend\nof my uncle and aunt. Otherwise I must consider it as without significance,\nas I have no cousin Annie. The relation between this \"aunt Lida \" and\nmyself as here stated is correct, and so is the statement that the other Lida\nis my sister. (June 2nd, 1900.)\u2014J. H.

Not less so is the reference to Uncle Clarke (name not correct,\nthough evident to me) with the statement that he had come to \"straighten\nout his thoughts.\"\u2014J. H. H.]\nI am still here, and I will remain as long as 1 possibly can.\n(Yes, I am glad to hear that. Please go on.) I wanted to speak of\nher myself, James. (Yes, that is right.)

H.]\n\fXLI.] 461\nAppendix III.\n(R. H. : Yes, I said that.) Yes, you said that.\n[This recollection and reference to Dr. Hodgson is a most interesting\none, though perhaps not so remarkable on the spirit theory. On February\n7th at a sitting at which I was not present Dr. Hodgson explained the\nmeaning of this work to my father, and asked him what he would expect of\nme in like circumstances (See p. 374).\u2014J. H. H.]\nI remember the organ and our singing, the ... oh what was that\nhymn, James, we used to sing so often ?\n(Keep calm.

The evidence is that it differs in some features\nfrom the usual capital N. But I cannot entertain any safe conjectures as to\nwhat was intended. (June 3rd, 1900.)\u2014J. H.

(Yes.)\n[The reference to the organ and our singing is correct, if we could separate\nit from the reference to the hymn. The reference to \"that hymn,\" when\ntaken in connection with the mention of the organ, would present inter\nesting possibilities to most persons. But father would neither use the word\n\" hymn \" in this connection, nor imply that he either sang hymns or used\nthe organ for any purpose of instrumental worship. He was always opposed\nto instrumental music in worship of any kind. But it is perfectly pertinent\nto mention a certain \"hymn\" which \"we used to sing so often.\" I could\nname what would fit the case, but I shall wait to see what is done in the\nfuture. (What I had in my mind here was the 23rd Psalm. June 3rd,\n1900.)\u2014J. H. H.] [Cf. pp. 476-477.]\nYes. Oh . . what has Will done with the flute (R.

(That is right.) and his C.\n. . . Vial . .\nit is my fault . . . [R. H. puts brown knife on table.]\nI am thinking of George and his . . the instrument he used to\nplay . . but the name has gone. [Hand sways in air and moves\nfingers suggesting playing concertina.] [The previous note was made at\nthe moment during the sitting by me, but when S. reminded me, just\nafter the sitting, of the incident, and said it was the guitar, I recognised\n\f462 [PAKT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthat the movement of the hand fitted the guitar and not the cuncert'out.\n\u2014R. H.]\n(S. to R. H. : Look at that hand.) (Do not bother about the name now.\nI know exactly what you meant.)\nYes, all right. After I go out I will return and recall it. I feel I must\ngo for a moment.\n[This passage beginning with the reference to a \"flute \" was remarkable\nfor its dramatic feature and for the apparent testimony which it affords in\nregard to the difficulties of communicating. When the word \" fiddle \" came\nout, I at once suspected what was meant, but was not sure that it might not\napply to brother Will, though I had no memory of such a thing, as it was\nhighly improbable. But it at once flashed on my mind what was intended\nand I made the reference to another brother without suggesting the name.\nThe immediate mention of George shows both the correct name and the\ncorrect conception of the relation involved in the thought of the musical\ninstrument. As soon as the letter C was written, I saw that the sound indi\ncated an approximation to the first letter of the name of the instrument in\nmind, and when \"Vial\" was written I was satisfied and was going to\nsuggest that this was enough, when Rector spontaneously recognised\nthat violin was wrong and assumed the fault himself. Then there began\nthe most remarkable attempt on the part of Mrs. P.'s hand to imitate\nthe movements of a player when playing on a guitar that one could\nimagine possible under the circumstances. It swayed slightly and moved\nthe fingers as if picking the strings, and so clearly imitated the playing\nof that instrument that any one thinking of it at the time could not escape\ndetecting it.\nI did not know what a concertina was when I wrote the above portion of\nthis note, but supposed that it was an instrument played somewhat after the\nmanner of a guitar. But having ascertained from Miss Edmunds that it is a\nwind instrument like the accordion I am at a great loss to understand how\nDr. Hodgson could so mistake the movement of Mrs. P.'s hand and fingers.\nThis mistake has to be mentioned because, 'having in mind what was intended,\nI am liable to the accusation that the resemblance recognised by me was an\nillusion of apperception, and Dr. Hodgson's reference to the concertina\npowerfully sustains that suspicion. But I am confident beyond all doubt\nthat there is less reason for this suspicion than the sceptic imagines,\nthough he is entitled to the caution which such phenomena impose upon the\nobserver.\u2014J.

What relation was this person you are speak\ning about to me ?)\nWell, I got it all but the Hyslop.\n[Rector apparently thought here that my brother was trying to give Lucy\nas the name of a sister or relative. There never was such a person, and it is\ncurious to remark that in the attempt to trust his inferences Rector goes\nastray. But it is not less interesting to observe that, at the end of the\nsitting, as Mrs. Piper comes out of the trance, there is apparently a special\neffort made to get the name Lucy McClellan, and this time they succeeded\n(June 3rd, 1900;.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Was she very close to me !) [Hand shakes slightly to indicate not under\nstanding.] Say that again.\n(Was she very close to me when she was living !)\nYes, very, and would have remained so, but not a sister nor a cousin nor\nan aunt, James, but it is on my mind, and I would like to tell you all I can\nabout her, but I am a little weaker just now.\n[Brother Charles had tried to give this Lucy in a previous sitting (p.\n455), and the communications seemed very much confused. But as my\nuncle James McClellan was named a few minutes before in the present\nsitting, I here inferred that the attempt was to give the name of his\ndaughter-in-law, who, I thought, was meant the first time the name was\ngiven, but I gave up this idea because the relationship mentioned seemed\nfalse. But as soon as I saw the hesitation the first time I saw the name Lucy\nwritten, I thought it possible that the reference might be to my twin sister\nSarah Luella who had died before Charles was born, as the first two letters\nof her name Luella are the same as that of Lucy. Hence I remarked to Dr.\nHodgson that I knew wrhat it meant. I ought to have seen that : \" It is\nLucy I am speaking about. Lin . . . \" was not intended for my sister,\nbut I did not. However, I resolved to test the case by asking [for the\nrelationship to me of the person indicated. I put the question in the form\nmentioned, almost the identical language referring to her possibly in an earlier\nsitting (p. 309), in order to satisfy a special purpose. The answer is somewhat\npuzzling. It seems to answer me both affirmatively and negatively. But by\nseparating the statements they can both of them be interpreted as true. This\nLucy, still living, is neither sister, nor aunt, nor cousin, except we consider\nthe last by marriage, she being the wife of the Robert McClellan who commu\nnicated before. But the statement that \"she \" was very close to me and \"would\nhave remained so,\" seems to imply that the lady was not living, while in fact\nshe is. But this implication and the closeness of the relation asserted, if\napplied to the sister that I had in mind, would be perfectly relevant. \u2014J.H.H.]\n(R.

I noticed\nas before that the yawning and sighing which accompanied the approach\nof the trance were incidents of this state and not of the normal Mrs. P.\nThe first peculiarity, not noticed before, was the interruption of a short\nperiod of apparent unconsciousness, the eyes being closed, by a few\n\fXLI.] 467\nAppendix III.\nmoments of apparent lucidity. But when the trance became quite\nprofound there was the catching of the breath as of a person in the\nthroes of death, but this soon stopped, and the breathing became as it\nusually is in the trance.\u2014J. H. H.\nJune 6th, 1899.\nRecord of Sitting. Jane 6th, 1899.\nProf. J. H. H. and R.

H. : Wait one moment kindly.)\n[As Mrs. P. lost consciousness, the upper part of the body tended to\nsway on one side somewhat, out of equilibrium, and we had a little difficulty\nin arranging her head properly upon the cushions. While doing so, Professor\nHyslop moved Mrs. P.'s chair somewhat forward and to the side, with the\nobject of placing her body in a better position as regards the cushioned table,\nand we also changed the position of the table itself. On reading the above\nwriting and examining the position of Mrs. P.'s body I found that it had\nsagged over slightly to the right, and it would not apparently remain in a\nconvenient position. On stooping down and looking at Mrs. P.'s feet,\nslightly moving her dress for the purpose, I found that the feet were crossed\nand one foot was partly turned over on the side. I uncrossed the feet and\nplanted them straight in front of her, and we then re-arranged the upper\npart of the body.\u2014R. H.]\n[This was a very remarkable incident. As Mrs. P.'s head fell on the\npillow I saw that her body was in a crooked position, and feared that during\nthe writing she might topple over. Consequently I moved the chair upon\nwhich Mrs. P. was sitting so as to straighten her up a little and prevent her\nfalling over. The table was then pulled up closer to her, and we proceeded\nto wait for the writing. My surprise can be imagined when the allusion to\nsomething being wrong with the machine was made, and turned out to be\nwhat Dr. Hodgson has described. It is interesting to remark also that there\nwas a connection between this position and the indistinctness of the writing.\nAs soon as Mrs. P. was put into the proper position the writing appeared\nnatural as usual. I had supposed that the change was due to the transition\nfrom Imperator to Rector, as the writing before the allusion to Mrs. P.'s\ncondition was made resembled, to me at least, that of Imperator. But the\nresumption of the writing immediately by Rector without the symptoms that\nusually accompany a change of personality rather indicates a connection\nbetween the cramped position of Mrs. P. and the writing.\u2014J.

[in reply to correct reading.]\n\" I saw Hyslop [hislop], and learned that it was McCle . . . McClellan's son\nto whom he referred, but the light was so poor he could not talk intelligently. He\nwill see you later and explain all.\"\nThe first matter of interest to note here is the realisation of the prediction made\non June (ith, 1899, and the correctness of the general statement of John McClellan's\nrecent death. But it is apparent that there is some confusion in regard to the\nrelationship. Two correct statements were made regarding it. The first was that\nhe was a brother of James McClellan, and the second that he was a son of John\nMcClellan referred to before (p. 472). All the references to \"uncle\" and \"great\n\"uncle,\" relating him to me in this way were false. The mistake, however, is\nperhaps a natural one in the light of the following facts.\nThere are John McClellan, Sr., John McClellen, Jr., and James McClellan, the\nlast two sons of the first. There is also the other John McClellan who has no deter\nminate relation to any of these, so far as I know (p. 111). Now James McClellan\nwas my uncle by marriage with my father's sister. If my uncle's father is a relation\nship in any way analogous to that of my father's uncle, we may well undeistand the\nsource of the confusion in the attempt to assign the relationship. The person whose\ndeath was predicted, and who died on March 30th 1900, is John McClellan, Jr. The\nconfusion lay in the question of uncles, and it is therefore iuteresting to note that in\nthe statement on June 12th, 6. P. avoided this entirely, and specified that the\nperson concerned was John McClellan's son, thereby making it clear that it was\nJohn McClellan, Jr.\nThe reference to my sister as having finished her work is in the main correct.\nShe had but one piece of work to do after this date in completion of her course. It\nmust be remembered, ttbwever, that I had intimated to my father at the sitting of\nFebruary 6th, 1900, that she would graduate in the spring.\u2014J. H. H.\n\f474 [part\n\/. H.

[Cf. p. 386.]\n[I never knew that father had the slightest doubt about this. He never\nexpressed any doubt about it to me, not even in the conversation I had with\nhim on the subject, and I could not understand this confession of doubt if it\nwere not for the surprisingly receptive attitude which he took in that con\nversation for the scientific evidence which I produced in favor of it on that\noccasion. I had expected some reproach for my interest in it and a reminder\nthat this could come to us only by faith in a revelation. He was always\ncareful to keep his intellectual and moral perplexities from all of us, if he\nhad any ; so much so that it is inexplicable now to be told that he had them\non this subject. Of course it remains to prove that this is true, and I should\nnot tolerate it as even possible were it not thoroughly consonant with his\nbehaviour in our conversation and with his interest in Swedenborg.\u2014J. H. H.]\n[November 3rd, 1899. It is possible that the doubt refers to the\npossibility of spirit communication.\u2014J. H. H.]\nDo you remember our conversations on this subject l (Yes I do.

I remember it well.)\nIt was more particularly on this occasion than before.\n(Yes, that is right. Do you know what I was doing just before I made\nthe visit ?)\nYes, I believe you had been experimenting on the subject and I\nremember of your telling me something about Hypnotism. [Correct.\u2014\nJ. H. H.] (Yes, I remember that well.)\nAnd what did you tell me about some kind of manifestation which you\nwere in doubt about 1 (It was about apparitions near the point of death.)\n[Excitement in hand.]\nOh, yes, indeed, I recall it very well, and you told me a young woman\n(S. : \"young man \") no (S. : not man) . . a young woman who had had\nsome experiments and dreams. (Yes ; that is right. Yes, that is right.)\nwhich interested me very much, but yet you were doubtful about life\nafter so-called death. Remember the long talks we had together on this,\nJames. (Yes. Yes, I remember them very well, and I am no more\ndoubtful.)\n[This is a perfectly correct account of the visit I paid to him, my last as\nhere said, in 1895. It is interesting to remark the mistake, as if\nreferring to some visit of his own, and then the correction of it\nto my last visit. Hut all the allusions here are correct, unless an\nobjection can be based upon the use of the word \"experiments.'' I talked\n\fXLI.] 475\nAppendix III.\nwith father on this occasion about Mrs. D., an account of whose experiences\nI gave him at the time. But my \" experiments\" with her on crystal vision\nwere not made until a few weeks after my visit and the report of them\nnot published until after his death. I might have mentioned the experiments\nin a letter to him. The other experiences, narrated in the same report with\nthe crystal visions, I knew as early as 1893, and some in 1894, before I\nvisited father, which was during the mid-year examinations in 1895.\nThere is an interpretation of this, however, which consists with the use\nof the word \" experiments.\" I spoke of the above possible difficulty because\nany reader of my paper on Mrs. D. would at once interpret the word\n\"experiments\" as referring to those in crystal vision, which were made after\nthis conversation. But the fact is that one of the phenomena which I had\nmentioned to my father in the conversation was the case of a dream coinci\ndence and the experiment to see if Mrs. D. could identify by a photograph\nthe person appearing, whom she had never seen. (Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. XII., pp. 272-274.) Hence the case can have a clear reference to this\ninstance which had appeared so remarkable to my father.\nThe allusion to \"some kind of manifestation,\" recognised as meaning\napparitions near the point of death, possibly refers to what I said about the\nCensus of Hallucinations (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. X.) published in August\nof 1894, and to one which my stepmother mentioned where one of her parents\n\u2014I have forgotten which\u2014appeared to the other when dying. I was\nespecially sceptical in my treatment of these hallucinations on this occasion.\nI explained hypnotism quite fully, and tried several times during my visit to\nhypnotise my brother Frank, who was then an invalid. I remember father\nwatched me with great interest and with some disappointment when I failed\nto effect hypnosis, as he had never seen it.\u2014J. H. H.]\nGod knows best, and if your (R.

I\nwanted to see whether any objections to the results of my experiments could\nbe made from the accusation that I was \"sized up\" by Mrs. P., and things\ntold me that might be conjectured as we read character. But Mrs. Piper has\nnever paid any attention to me ; has not even spoken to me since I was\nintroduced to her, and disregards me so thoroughly that there is no use for\nme to look at her at all except to record the fact that she pays no attention\nto me. I spoke to her deliberately in her dazed condition, and she stared at\nme for a few moments like a wild person, and then broke out into the utter\nances mentioned. \u2014J. H.

[Mrs. P. still dreamy up to this point.]\nIntroduction.\nI was careful to observe whether I was noticed this morning by\nMrs. P. as she came into the room. Dr. Hodgson and I went upstairs\nlx;fore seeing Mrs. P. at all. I sat down upon a sofa and picked up a\nmorning paper to read until Mrs. P. came up. When she came into\nthe room, or rather just as she entered the door, she spoke to Dr.\nHodgson, and as she walked to a writing-desk she turned her head and\ntook a mere glance at me reading the paper, but finding that I had\nturned my eyes in that direction, she at once turned away and there\nafter paid no more attention to me than if I had not been in the room.\nThe symptoms of the trance repeated themselves as usual except\nthat, as the trance approached, the mention of the number 25, and then,\n\fXLI.] 477\nAppendix III.\nas I thought, 23, suggested to me that they had a connection with the\nlanguage Mrs. P. used as she came out of the trance the day before,\nwhen she said, \" You can't sing, elderly gentleman hasn't any teeth.\nThat's funny,\" this language being capable of reference to the \" hymn \"\nhe was trying to mention. If the number 23, as I thought I heard it,\nbe correct, it is the right number of the \" hymn \" [psalm] that I had\nin mind and supposed father had also. But there is no assurance that\nthere is any such connection with previous sittings in incidents of this\nkind. I can only mention a possibility of this because of a coincidence\nin the case. I referred in a previous note to the fact that father had no\nteeth at the time of his death, but I supposed that the \" you can't\nsing \" was only an incoherence. But it afterward occurred to me that\nfor some years before his death he had to give up singing at family\nworship because of the gradual loss of his voice, and if there is any\nthing in the supposition of continued weaknesses of this kind after\ndeath, which must seem absolutely incredible to us, the incident might\nrepresent an attempt on the other side, as in the case of the guitar, to\nsing the \" hymn \" he had in mind with the hope that some of it might\ncome through. If so, the 23 is a relic of this attempt, the 25 being a\nmistake.\u2014J. H.

I fet [?] forget who\nmade it, but I remember of my going out to a little stream and getting my\nclothes wet through, and if I mistake not it was Eliza who helped me to get\nout of the difficulty. I know I have the facts clear, but the details I cannot\nrecall. You might ask her about the boat and about helping me get dry,\nwhich is the most I can remember. (Yes, I shall certainly ask her.) I know\nyou will find I am right about it. [I know absolutely nothing of this.\u2014-J.\nH. H.] [See Note 76, p. 524.]\nI am here, James. 1 heard them telling you what I said to Rector and\nMoses [Stainton Moses. See Vol. XIII., p. 408.\u2014J. H.

Yes.\n(Who made that cap you referred to so often ? Who made that cap you\nreferred to so often ?) Mother.\n(Well, which mother? The one on your side or on this side? Which\nmother, the one on your side or the one on my side ?) on my side.\n[The term mother was so equivocal to me that I was forced to ask for the\ndistinction which my question suggests. But I made a botch of it in the way\nI put the question. I was governed by the use which I had made before of\nthe same mode of expression, thinking that it would be understood, as before,\nbut it was not, and I have myself to blame for not saying stepmother, as I\nshould have done, and as I was reproached later by G. P. for not doing.\nThe expression \"on my side\" would be wrong if interpreted as coming\nfrom father, but the statement that follows shows that the expreasion \"on\nmy side \" was repeated to father and not sent from him. This makes both\nthe apparent confusion and the connection perfectly clear and correct.\u2014\nJ. H. H.]\n(Do you mean in the earthly life or in the spirit life ?)\nOh, I see what you mean. Your mother, James, is with me, but Hettie's\nmother is in the body. [This is exactly correct.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes, that is right. Do you remember any trip with her out West ?)\n[As my mother's name was not given, and as I was satisfied with the\nrelationship to my sister expressed by it, I knew that the right person was\nin mind and put at once a question both to serve as still more certain\nidentification, and to call out some incidents about which I know little or\nnothing. Father and my stepmother took a trip out to the far West before\nhe decided to go to Indiana in order to look for such a home as he finally\n\fXLI.] 479\nAppendix III.\nadopted in the last named State. If he had mentioned any particulars of this\ntrip they would have served a twofold purpose, first identification to the\nsecond wife still living, and second the mention of incidents that I do not\nknow.\u2014J. H. H.]\ncertainly, I told you about it before some time ago, did you not U D it ?\n[This is quite a remarkable answer, as showing the confusion which my\nbadly put question occasioned, and the memory of what had been told me\nbefore, and which I was not sure I had rightly understood. The error in my\nquestion consisted in failing to use the word \"stepmother\" or \"second\nwife,\" instead of the pronoun \" her.\" For the mention of a trip out West in\nconnection with the word \" mother \" would inevitably suggest the trip which\nfather, my mother and myself took out West in 1861. The mention of his\nhaving told me of it before shows that this very suggestion was produced.\nThe reference makes clear, however, what I was doubtful about at the time.\n\u2014J. H. H.]\n(No, I was not quite sure what you meant. When you can I would be\nglad to have you tell some things about that trip, but don't hurry.)\n[I intended by this question both to express the uncertainty which I had\nfelt about the reference to that Western trip when it was made and to divert\nhis mind away from it to the other trip, though intimating that I wonld be\nglad to have something about this trip in 1861 when he could give it again.\nI seem to have succeeded in the diversion, though apparently a second\nthought brought about confusion worse confounded, and this would be\nnatural enough on a second thought, because \" that trip \" is an exceedingly\nequivocal expression. I am not surprised at the confusion that followed, and\nsaw very soon why and how I had caused the muddle.\u2014J. H. H.]\nYes, but it was she who made my cap, and you had better ask her about\nit.

Hand moves back the knife and retains the\nspectacle case.] recall what I so longed to say. My own mother Nannie. I\n. . . wait. I will go for a moment, wait for me, James.\n[The confusion here I interpreted as due partly to the nature of my\nequivocal question and partly to the attempt to give my stepmother's name.\nThe words my \"own mother, Nannie,\" suggested that he was trying to get\nsome way of making himself understood in regard to my stepmother's name,\nas Margaret was the name of both, and later this name was given by G. P.\n[See Note 77, p. 524.]\n(Yes I shall wait. Yes I shall wait.)\nYes, very well. Yes, I do. [Between Sp.]\nH., did you send for me. What is it ?\n(S. to R. H. : That's George, isn't it ?)\nYes. I am coming right back.\nI think, James, you mean when we met with the accident, do you not ?\n[This shows what I am responsible for in my equivocal reference to the\ntrip, and my failure to make clear with whom it was connected. I thought\n\f480 J. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthe next statement would clear it, but the answer shows that he thought he\nhad already referred to the trip I had in mind.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(No, not the accident. You took a trip with Hettie's mother just before\nyou went out West. It was that to which I referred.)\nWell, I am sure I have told you of this before. Think it over and you will\nrecall it. I am not sure I mentioned her, but I had it on my mind when I\nreferred to the trip I took just before going out West, do you not recall\nit ? [S. is about to speak.] (R. H. to S. : Sh sh) [Hand turns away\nto Sp.] [Cf. p. 421.]\n(R. H. : George . . . ) [S. about to speak again.] (R. H. to S. :\nSh-sh.)\n[I do not recall that any previous references to this trip were recognised\nby me at all, though I did explain that the statements made regarding a trip\nWest were equivocal enough to apply to two of them that I knew about. I\nshall have to re-read the first four sittings at least, and possibly some of the\nfive by Dr. Hodgson to determine this matter. This confusion and perhaps\nlapse of memory on my part ought to create charity for alleged spirits who\nhave difficulty in remaining near the \" machine.\"\u2014J. H. H.] [See Note 78,\np. 525.]\n(R. H. : George, there is apparently some confusion still remaining in the\nspirit Hyslop's mind about Hettie's mother in the body. He has not yet\ngiven her real name. Perhaps you can see just what the cause of this\nconfusion about her is.)\n[This statement by Dr. Hodgson is interesting partly for its misunder\nstanding of my mind and intention at the time and for the confusion which\nit was calculated to produce, as it did, and for the later explanation and\nreproach of G. P. Dr. Hodgson did not know, and the necessity of not\nburdening the record at the time with my reason for my conduct in not\npressing for the name prevented me from telftng him, that I was satisfied\nwith the right relation expressed in regard to my sister and the cap made by\nher mother, and that I was trying to run father's mind to a trip whose\nincidents would serve a fine evidential purpose. Dr. Hodgson of course did\nnot see this, not knowing anything about the trip nor about my purpose, but\nthought I was still trying to get the name when I was not. In the end,\nhowever, thanks to G. P., the matter was somewhat cleared up, but the\nconfusion at this time still continues to show itself, though father makes an\ninteresting attempt to clear it.\u2014J. H.

I U D.)\nHas he ever heretofore referred to any trip ?\n(I am not quite certain except once. I think he referred once to a trip J\ntook with him out West, but I mentioned the other one in order to identify\nmy stepmother with whom he took a trip just before he moved out West.)\nI see, well, I will assist him, do not hurry.\n\fXLI.] 481\nAppendix III.\n[This is an interesting piece of comprehension by G. P. The spontaneous\nrecognition of the situation and cause of the confusion is a wonderful bit of\nevidence for independent intelligence. He saw exactly what I was aiming at\nand how my reference to one trip was confused with another. The whole\ninterference of G. P. at this point and immediately following, indicating an\nindependent consciousness of the confusion, is a most remarkable phenomenon\non any hypothesis except the spiritistic.\nIn talking to Dr. Hodgson about this sitting after I had written my notes,\nand in explaining what was in my mind when I was pushing my inquiries\nabout the western trip with my stepmother, I found that Dr. Hodgson had\nmisunderstood the import of my language when talking to G. P. and thought\nI was still seeking for my stepmother's name. Hence his inquiry for this at\na later stage of the sitting. But my sole purpose was to get my father to\ntalking on a trip of whose details I knew nothing, and in using the word\n\"identify\" I merely wished to suggest to G. P. my purpose in asking for\nincidents. I did not mean to demand a name. But it was natural for Dr.\nHodgson to make this mistake, as we had talked over the propriety of asking\nfor this name as we went to the sitting. The circumstances explain our own\nconfusion and afford a legitimate excuse for the confusion evident on the\nother side. And it tells against telepathy with great force, because, if that\nprocess can catch so easily what confuses us, it ought always to have caught\nthe things in my mind and which I wished to have stated. But in no single\ncase has my present thought been caught in a situation like this and\npalmed off as father's.\u2014J. H. H.]\nYes, this is . . the one he referred to was the one with yourself\nyes, which interrupted his thought somewhat . . somewhat.\n[Perfectly correct and interesting in the way it explains the interruption.\n\u2014J.

(Yes, I shall ask\nher.)\n1 think it was yellow in colour . . Yes. [to reading.]\n[I remember nothing of this incident, but it is interesting as against the\ntelepathic theory to know that when this question was asked me by this\nsister at a previous sitting I made inquiry of my aunt and she replied that\nshe knows nothing about it. The telepathic power would not return to this\nif it could divine what condition of mind I was in on this matter.\u2014J. H.

You see I got it out of him for you, H., but you\nno need to get nervous about it, old chap. (R. H. : All right, George,\nthanks.)\nWell, I cannot hold him any longer, and you will get more later.\n[This is another interesting display of evidence for independent intelli\ngence. The mechanical play of secondary personality has no resemblance to\nthe natural appreciation of a situation and interchange of ideas here indi\ncated. G. P. goes away with father to get the name of my stepmother,\ntalks about it just as anyone would who had done as here indicated, and\nchaffs Dr. Hodgson for getting nervous about it ! !

I saw Rector and a lady.\nYes, that's funny, they kept whispering, whispering it all the time until\nRector turned.\n[Margaret is the name of iuy stepmother, but it is also the name of two\non the other side. Hence Mrs. P.'s allusion to the lady with Rector\nprevents my interpreting the name given as intended for that of my step\nmother who is still living.\u2014J. H. H.]\nIntroduction.\nThe first indication of the trance to me to-day was a slightly dreamy\nlook and far away gaze for a few seconds. Then Mrs. P. seemed to\nbecome a little more lucid and moved her head a little, following this\nact with the statement : \" I am going to send those to Mrs. M. to-day.\"\nThis referred to some instructions about proofs of her photos by Dr.\nHodgson. They had been examining them and talking about them\nsome five minutes before, and the voice when uttering the sentence was\na little dreamy and weak. Presently she began rubbing her face with\nher hands, and yawning. This was followed again after a little interval\nby rubbing the face and eyes, with arrested coughing. Presently she\nsaid in a very contented tone of voice : \" I don't mind going to sleep\nany more.\" Then her mouth opened slightly and after a short silence\na strange dry hacking and short cough was made. This was just\nbefore the head fell on the pillow.\u2014J. H. H.\nJune. S\/h, 1899.\nRecord of Sitting, June 8th, 1899.\nProf. J. H. H. and R. H.\n[Mrs. P.'s sublim.]\nI don't mind . .

(Hail to thee, Rector and\nImperator.)\nWe are glad indeed to be with thee this day. We have many duties to\nperform this day, and a few words of advice and a few explanatory remarks\nto make for thy better U D of our friend's confused condition. He came\nwith his thoughts full of things concerning his last memories at the meeting\nbefore, and could not be made txi U D that he should speak of other things.\n\f488 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nConsequently we sent our helper to instruct him according to his U D of the\nway in which he could best express himself. Besides the light was a little\nlow, and under such conditions we cannot do our best.\n[This is an interesting account of the confusion the day before. It is,\nof course, nothing more than we knew in general, or could surmise, but it is\none of those little touches of intelligence and fitness of speech that make up\nthe problem in these phenomena, on any theory we propose to adopt.\u2014\nJ. H.H.J\nWe now advise that we meet thy earthly friend no more until after we\nhave restored the light as we have previously stated to thee, friend. Other\nwise we would prefer to go on with him for a time longer. (R. H. : Yes, I\nunderstand.)\nBut after we have arranged our work [{] and through prayer and other\nwise restored the light }, bring him to us again, as it will be of great help\nto his friends on our side, and we ask thee to be wary and rest thyselves\nuntil we are prepared . . wary . . to meet thee again.

(Yes, I shall be glad to consider all these things.)\nIf there is any one thing of which thou wouldst ask advice or for help,\nspeak now.\n(I think I shall not ask father to-day. I can receive this some time in the\nfuture.) [The word father above should be farther.

Hyslop, Ph.D.\n[This whiile passage giving me both physical and spiritual advice is an\ninteresting hit of by-play in this business, and will be interpreted by most\npersons as a piece of presumption. It certainly has a most humorous side\nto it. Spiritistic proselytising from the other world is a new kind of propa\nganda, unless we accept similar attempts on the part of less accredited mediums\nthan Mrs. P. But it repeats the advice given to Dr. Hodgson and followed\nby him with no special tendencies in him that I can observe toward dissolution\nof body and soul. However, I am not concerned with either the correctness\nof such advice or the possible effects of accepting it, but with the dramatic\nplay of personality which it shows, in connection with the previous promise to\ngive the advice, and with the humorous aspects of its proselytism.\u2014J.H.H.]\nI see George and Mr. Hyslop coming now with our leader.\n[Slight perturbation in hand.]\nI am here, James, once more.\n(Good morning. Good morning, father ; glad to hear from you.)\nGood morning, James ; I am glad to hear good morning once more, and I\nam quite near to-day. [Hand moves towards R. H.]\nI know your father very well. (R. H. : I am very pleased that you have\nmade his acquaintance.) [See sitting of February Kith (p. 389). I had\nasked Mr. Hyslop to become acquainted with my father.\u2014R. H.]\nI find our minds were not quite the same when on earth, but our ideas of\nGod were.\n[This is quite a correct statement of the relation between the beliefs of\nmy father and those of Dr. Hodgson's father, in so far as it can be determined\nby a comparison of creeds. My father was a strict Presbyterian Calvinist\nand Dr. Hodgson's father a Wesleyan Methodist, and so Arminian. (June\n10th, 1900.)\u2014J. H. H.]\nYou see they have told me that James is going away, and I want to know\nyou and have you take my messages for me sometimes.\nI am glad you U D me better, James. Are you going home soon !\n(Yes, I am going home in about two weeks.)\nI want you to feel that I shall be there also, and I will remind you of\nsome of things I see you do while there. Do you hear ? (Yes, I hear, and\nshall be very glad indeed to have you do that.) I will repeat them to our\nfriend here. (R. H. : I shall be very pleased to take them.)\nI shall watch you very closely, James, and when you are talking to any\nmember of our family I will remind our friend of it, and what I hear you\nsay. (Good, that is fine. Good, that is tine.)\nYou will see that I will prove that I am with you still, even if I cannot\nalways speak my thoughts.\nDo you hear me ! (Yes, I hear you perfectly.) Give me something to\nthink over and I will speak to you .\n(S. to R. H. : Is that something to hold ?) [R. H. nods towards bag\ncontaining articles.]\nDo you recall the books I referred to yet, James i\n(I think I do, but I shall find out when I see my stepmother.)\nWill you ask her about the paper knife, not because I care for so trifling\na thing, only as a test for you i (Yes, father, I have already asked her. She\nremembers it and so does Frank.)\n\fXLI.] 491\nAppendix III.\nI am glad of it because I like to get these things offmy mind. I . . .\ndo you remember that Eliza's name was really Elizabeth ? (No. I did not\nknow that. I am very glad to find it out. ) She was named Elizabeth as a\nchild, and as time went on we began to call her Eliza. (Good. I am glad to\nlearn that. That is a splendid test.) And you cannot mistake it, James.\n[See Note 85, p. 528.]\nThere was a Henry [!] McLellan also. I think perhaps you may know of\nthis. (No, I did not know of it, but I shall certainly inquire.)\nhe was . . he was, I think an uncle of our McLellan boys . . Yes,\n(All right.) let me ... let me see . . .\n[I did not recall at the sitting that this name had been given before (see\nsitting of May 29th) and hence my negative answer, but I see now what it\nmeans, and the relationship is correct. It is possibly an attempt to give the\nname of Dr. Harvey McClellan, who is an uncle of the McClellan boys.\n(C\/. p. 422)\u2014J. H. H.]\n[I have made careful inquiry and have found that the \" McClellan boys \"\nhad no uncle by the name of Henry, and that their uncle Harvey is the only\nperson who can answer to this probable attempt at his name (June 10th, 1900).\n\u2014J. H. H.]\nWhat did I tell you about Jennie a short time ago ?\n(We only got the name, and I could not make out its meaning. We only\ngot the name, and I could not make out its meaning.)\nLet ine see . . . I think . . HAR . . . MARGARET\nhad some relative of [written above after whom was written] whom she used\nto speak as Jennie, but I won't be sure of this, as I cannot quite remember,\nbut I think she did ... I think she did.\n[This about Margaret and Jennie is not clear to me, in fact is meaning\nless.\u2014J. H. H.] [See Note 86, p. 529.]\nI thought of it several times, but I could not quite remember. You see,\nJames, I was not wholly conscious when I came here, and I suddenly thought\nof every one of my dear ones the moment I awoke. I go over and over\nthem in my thoughts daily, and I often wonder if they know how near I am\nto them. I want you some time to talk with me as we used to talk together.\n(Yes. Yes, father, I think I can say a few words now.)\n[Hand listens to Sp. and then makes cross in air.]\nI would be so glad to hear you, as it will help me to keep my thoughts clear.\n(Well, I shall talk a few moments about some earthly things that have\nhappened since you passed out. I bought the house in which you lived out\nWest in order to avoid expenses with the courts.) Oh, I U D well. I am glad.\n(George is still on the northern land.) and will be I fear. [Perfectly\npertinent.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Well, we shall see what we can do with it.)\nI will be on the look out and see what I can do by using my influence\nfrom this side of life. I may do much.\n(Very well. I shall be glad if you can. You . .)\n[Hand starts as if to write, then returns to listen again.]\n(You will remember Harper Crawford, I think.) [Excitement in hand.]\nYes I do, very well. What about him ! I have tried, and tried, and tried to\nspell his name for you, but I could not seem to articulate for their U D.\n\f492 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\n(Yes. I understand perfectly. I shall mention another, too. Do you\nremember Robert Cooper i) Certainly I do, very well indeed, and I have\nintended to speak his name for you also, but tell me about the mortgage.\n[This reference to a mortgage in connection with my cousin Robert\nCooper is very pertinent. He was badly handicapped by debt at the time of\nmy father's death and had his farm heavily mortgaged.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(I have not heard about it, but shall learn this summer.) And then let\nme know about HARPERS (Harper Crawford, you mean i) [Assent.]\n(All right. I shall ? do so.) [I did not catch the word missing.\n\u2014R. H.]\nI want to know this one thing only. Are they doing anything about the\nchn rch ?\nyes only [re-reading of sentence above. ]\n(What church do you refer to, the church in your old Ohio home ?)\n[Assent.] (I have not heard but shall inquire.)\nThey have put in an organ . .

[pointing to the yes only], [S.\nindicates that yes only was written first.]\nThey have put in an Organ, James. [I know nothing of this.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Very well. I shall look that up. Do you mean the first church ? Do you\nmean the first U. P. church ?)\nI cannot seem to get that, James. [Hand listens again.]\n(Do you mean the first United Presbyterian Church ?) I cannot get that.\nCan you say it for me slowly ?\n(Do you mean ... do you mean the First United Presbyterian\nChurch !) Say the two last slowly . . got it all but that.\n(United) yes. (Presbyterian, Pres-by te-ri-an.) Yes, I do.\n(Very well. I understand. You say they have an organ now)\nI say yes.\nVery well. (1 shall be glad to find out about it.) Yes, but I am telling\nyou.\n(I understand perfectly ; that will be a good test.)\nWell, it is so, James. [See Note 87, p. 529.] Tell me something more\nabout George. He always did look out for number one.\n(Yes. I cannot tell very much about George, because, as you know, he\nvery seldom writes letters. You understand.)\nYes I think I do, perfectly well. [S. laughs.] [Avery pretty recognition.\n\u2014J. H.H.]\n(When I come back here again I think I can tell you many things about\nhim.) Yes, but, James, I know a great deal myself and did worry . . worry\n. as you must know. Worry as you . . [Correct.\u2014J. H. H.]\n(Yes, I understand, and you know \/ worried much also.)\nYea. Who could know better titan I do t Remember what we talked\noner when you came out there. (Yes.)\nWell. I can say only one thing, do not . . not . . worry any more\nabout him or anything else. (No, I will try not to worry.)\n[See Note 88, p. 531.]\n\fXLI.] 493\nAppendix III.\nAnd about the fence [feuse] I am thinking about the tax I left. (R. H. :\n\"about the fence ? \") Yes, fence [fense].\n(The tax has been paid. I settled that all right. Nearly all the debts\nhave been cleared off. We owe only aunt Nannie a little.) Oh what a relief\nto my mind. I have thought and thought and thought what would Frank\nor George do if they had a hand in it.\n[This is terribly pertinent. My brother Frank is an invalid, and it is\npertinent that he was named in father's will as one of the executors.\nMy brother George was always so busy and so slow to answer letters on\nmatters of business that the two facts explain this allusion very clearly,\nand all that has previously been said about him.\u2014J. H. H.]\n[See Note 89, p. 531.]\nDo you remember what you did for me once '!\n(I am not sure just now, but if you will remind me)\nin regard to a tax one year. It was what I wrote to you [the to crossed\nout] . . It [I] was what I wrote you about . . about . . and you\nactively helped. (I do not remember it, but you must not be surprised\nbecause I helped you so often with money you remember.)\nYes, but about . . dear James, do you not remember just before I\ncame here I was not well at the time and I wrote to you about the tax. I\nshould never forget it. (I do not exactly recall it, but I think it most pro\nbable, because I know just what the situation was.) Well, it will come back\nto you, I hope, as it will live with me for ever.\nWhat about the fence ! Do you know what I mean ? (I think I do. I\nknow that we have repaired the fence.)\nAll right. I intended to have it done before I left, and I also had this\non my mind. (Yes, that is now all straightened out.)\n[The reference to the taxes and the fence is pertinent, very pertinent\nindeed, though it is possible that the instance of the fence is a little equivocal.\nI know that father was exercised about the time of his death about the con\ndition of the fences on his farm, and that when I with my brother assumed\nour executors' duties we had to look after this matter and to settle some\naccounts connected with father's orders about it. But I also know that my\nbrother Frank had urged his removing the rough fence about his house in the\nWest, and my brother once told me, if I remember rightly, that he thought\nfather was about persuaded to accept this course. I am less certain, however,\nabout this part of the matter than I am about the needs of the fence on the\nfarm in Ohio at the time of his death, and our completion of the work.\nI do not remember any correspondence about the taxes to which he refers.\nI think I have his letters, and may find whether the statement is true or not.\nBut the facts are these. The wheat crop had completely failed, and the\nprevious corn crop had brought very little, so that father had absolutely no\nmoney to either pay the taxes or to live on without borrowing, and no man\never hated more than he to borrow money when he saw little chance of\nrepaying it. He was also very prompt and scrupulous in paying his taxes,\nbut this time the want of money prevented his paying them, and the date\nfor paying them without a penalty was nearly up. It was about the 26th or\n27th of August. He took sick about ten days previous to this, and died on\nthe 29th. I found out by calling at the tax office a day too late that the\n\f494 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\npenalty could not bo avoided, and I never told father this fact. But\nwhen he mentioned his situation on his death-bed I told him not to worry\nabout it, that I would see to the matter, and I paid the taxes after the funeral\nand before I left for the east.\nBut I can hardly think that the language of his statement here can be\ncorrectly interpreted as referring to this incident of his condition at the time.\nIt apparently refers to some other occasion about the same time. But I do\nnot remember any pirticular incident regarding it. I know only that father\nwas very anxious about the taxes at the time of his death, and that I promised\nto see that there was no trouble about them. As here said to him, I so often\nhelped him when he called on me, and I was so busy with my work at the\ncollege that I remember no special occasion of such help, except after his death,\nand this does not seem to be pertinent.\u2014J. H. H.] [See Note 90, p. 532.]\nDo you know how you are helping me unburden my mind I shall be so\nglad when these things are off from it.\n(Very well. Do not worry about things. They are in very good order.\nRemember, we had very hard times when you passed out . . . ) (R. H.\nto S. : Not so fast.) (But the presidential election) (R. H. to S. : Wait a\nminute.) (turned in favour of better times.)\nWhat turned . . what turned ? (The election of Mr. McKinley.)\nOh, I I'D; the president, you mean. Did you say election t\n(Yes, that is right.)\nOh, I U D perfectly. I could not at first U D the words election and\nPresident ; they seemed so muffled . . muffled, James.\n(All right. Do you remember how you shook a walking-stick to my\ncousin about that time ! Do you remember how you shook a walking-stick\nor cane to cousin Robert MoClellan about that time !) [Excitement in hand.]\nWell I do, I never was more excited in my life I think I was right too.\n[True. Father was as much interested and excited about the issues in\nthat campaign as he was about slavery during the civil war. I remember in\nspeaking to him about the issues of the campaign that he threw up his hands\nand exclaimed as best he could with his lost voice, \"you can never reconcile\ndebtors and creditors.\" The expression, \"I was right, too,\" is perfectly\ncharacteristic. Both the phrase and the tone of belief are his. Father\nknew when he was not certain about political and economic problems, and\nif he found something to be true which he saw disputed, he would break\nout in this way when he expressed his conviction and the satisfaction of\nhis mind. The recognition of my question is also interesting.\nMy cousin Robert McClellan had called to see him in this his last illness.\nHe asked father on which side of the political question he sided, the issue\nbeing between the gold and silver parties. Father's voice was too weak to\nspeak and seizing an opportunity for a display of humour, he reached for the\nwalking stick which I had given him some time before and on which was fixed a\nbeetle in representation of a \"gold bug,\" and shook it, laughingly, toward\nmy cousin. My cousin saw the point, and had a hearty laugh about it. I\nheard the fact from both of them and from my mother afterward.\u2014J. H. H.]\n[See Note 91, p. 532.J\n(Well, who gave you that walking-stick ?) [S. touches R. H. to draw his\nattention to hand.]\n\fXLI.] 495\nAppendix III.\n[Forefinger of listening hand is tapping on left temple of S.]\nYou did, and I told him about it. [indicating R. H.]\n[This was as dramatic a play of personality as I ever witnessed, as well\nas being absolutely correct in regard to the facts. I did give him the cane,\nand from the reference to the curved handle in the sitting with Dr.\nHodgson (p. 397) I had inferred that, if we were to treat the communi\ncation as intelligible and true, it was probably this \"gold bug\" cane that\nwas meant. Hence the pointing of the hand toward Dr. Hodgson con\nfirms my conjecture.\u2014J. H. H.]\n[Later inquiries slightly modify the statement about the \"absolute\"\ncorrectness of the message, but leave it mainly correct. See Note 92, p. 51i3\n(May 7th, 1901).\u2014J. H. H.\n(Yes, I thought so. What was on it ?)\nWhat was on it ? I think I know that it had the little top [?] I . . I\nthink it had the little ring [t]\n(S. to R. H. [in a whisper]: not quite. )\n(I think I know what you mean by that. That is near enough. Do not\nworry. You recall it well.)\n[This attempt to draw the beetle or \"gold bug \" which was on the stick in\nlieu of struggling with the name was another interesting performance, and\nsuggests the resources which have to be adopted for accomplishing the\npurpose of the communicator in embarrassing emergencies.\u2014J. H. H.]\n[My discovery in the West of the curved handled cane which I had for\ngotten, which had been mended by a tin sheath or ring, and which the mimic\nincidents in the sitting of February 22nd (p. 400) tit more accurately than any\nother supposed stick makes it necessary to admit an equivocal meaning in this\nsymbol. It might be taken to represent this tin sheath or ring and the\nmanner of fastening it on the broken part of the cane. But for a more\ndetailed examination of the facts I must refer the reader to Note 92, p. 533.\n(June 10th, 1900.)\u2014J. H. H.]\nI will refer to it again later. (All right.

I took full notes of the\nanswers and remarks made by all persons who were connected with the names\ngiven at the sittings or who could be expected to know anything about the\nincidents mentioned.\nNew York, November 8th, 1899.\nNote 37.\u2014As this Maltine incident was the only one in the whole record\nthat appeared on the surface of it to indicate a fact known to me and not\ncommon to the supposed knowledge of my father, I thought it necessary to\nexamine into it. I knew from my observation in all the sittings at which I\nwas present that Mrs. Piper had not seen the box to which I have alluded in\n2 K\n\f498 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nher normal condition. But I did not know whether Dr. Hodgsoni had con\ncealed the box from her as effectually as the articles it contained, and hence\nas an alternative to telepathy we could have the possibility of an admission\nto the subliminal through the supraliminal, though this was more than\nimprobable in the sittings personally attended, and inconsistent with all that\nwe know of Mrs. Piper's recent trances. I had then to reckon with the\npossibility that it was obtained tele],athically, assuming that it was not a\nmedicine that my father would use for his disease at all. Hence I considered\nthe coincidence with reference to what I knew of the medicine and the box\nin question. But not knowing what my father may have taken I did not\npermit the incident to go uninvestigated. Hence I wrote to my brother,\nstepmother and sister to know whether father had ever taken any Maltine or\ncontemplated taking it. The answer of my sister and stepmother is that\nthey do not know positively, but very much doubt it. The answer of my\nbrother is as follows :\u2014\nBloomington, Indiana, November 7th, 1899.\nMv dear James,\u2014Received the questions from you to-day and reply as\nsoon as possible. No, father did not use any of the Maltine. But while I\nwas visiting at Will's, mother wrote that he was losing flesh. This showed\nthat he was not getting sufficient nourishment from his food. And as I knew\nthat Maltine was a good digester and tonic I wrote and advised father to get\nsome and use it. But he did not do it. However, it is likely that he had\nsome talk about it at the time of my wiiting to him about it.\u2014Love to all,\nFrank E. Hysi.op.\nThis case turns out then somewhat like that of \" Munyon's . . . .\nGermiside.\" It was a medicine which he was advised to take and most\nprobably contemplated, and so comes near enough to specific incidents in his\nmind while living to prevent any dogmatic decision in favour of the exclu\nsive application of either the telepathic theory or that of Mrs. Piper's accidental\nknowledge filtered into the subliminal. The fact that my father would at\nleast know the name of this medicine could not be given any weight in an\napology for spiritism, but the specific place which my brother's advice would\nhave in his mind would naturally occur to him or anyone else trying to think\nover the efforts to stay the disease with which he was suffering, though we\nmust wonder why he did not name a more familiar medicine which I\ni 1 was careful in all my own sittings not to unwrap the box labelled Maltine\nuntil Mrs. Piper was in trance, and to wrap it up again before she came out of the\ntrance, and I believe that prior to the incident in question the box was never within\nthe field of Mrs. Piper's vision. I had also inferred from something th*t Professor\nHyslop had either said or written to me that this box had nothing to do with his\nfather\u2014R. H.\nThough I did not state in so many words, as my letters show, to Dr. Hodgson\nthat the Maltine box had nothing to do with my father, the only rational meaning of\nelaborate statements describing packages that I sent him for use is exactly what he\nsuggests here. I indicated the relation of the Maltine box to the experiments in\nthree separate letters which I still hold, namely, one of January 2nd, one of\nJanuary 31st, and one of February 3rd, 1899. I described it as merely containing the\narticles which I sent as having been used by my father.\u2014J. H. H.\n\fXLI.] 499\nAppendix, III.\nhad in mind when I put my question, but which he never mentioned sit all.\nWhatever the difficulties in such a fact and in spite of the circumstance that\nwe cannot apologise for the spiritistic view by emphasising the possibilities\nof this reference to Maltine, yet they are great enough to preclude any\nattempt to insist on telepathy as the exclusive alternative, especially if we\nare permitted to use the reference to \" Munyon's .... Germiside \"\nas an automatism.\nOctober 15th, 1899.\nNote '.18.\u2014When the name \"Nani\" was given here, I supposed that the\nintention was to mention my aunt Nannie, as other notes indicate in similar\nsituations. But after the large number of cases in which the name Nannie\nwithout the qualification \"aunt\" was used most probably, or certainly, for\nmy stepmother, it is more natural to put this interpretation on the use of\nthat name here, especially as she was the one who would be most likely to\nremember the way he used to read his paper. But I refer to the case again\nbecause another fact has occurred to me that may explain why the mistake\nof \" Nannie \" for \" Maggie \" may have occurred. Rector must be supposed\nto know that my own mother was with my father \" on the other side.\" But\nnothing had been said to indicate to him that I have a stepmother, until the\nattempt was made in the sitting of June 6th to get the name of my step\nmother correctly. In this attempt it will be observed that Rector recognises\nat once the absurdity of calling my mother by the name Nannie, as he at\nonce explains that they know better over there, inasmuch as my Aunt Nannie\nhad only acted as our mother after the death of my real mother (p. 481i).\nThis had of course been intimated in an earlier sitting (p. 449) in a message\nfrom my father, and Rector might have inferred it from my statement in the\nletter from me to my father read to him by Dr. Hodgson (p. 400). Rector's\nmind was thus in the situation to apperceive messages referring to my step\nmother under the name \"Nannie.\" But I cannot insist upon this way of\nlooking at the facts because the mistake was committed in the name at my\nfirst series of sittings where we cannot suppose that any intimation from my\nside had been given of the relation between my aunt and domestic affairs.\nHence it must be treated as the usual mistake of \" Nannie \" for \" Maggie \"\nby the trance personality.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 39.\u2014The latest notes of Appendix II. (Note 29, p. 410, and Note 30,\np. 412) reveal the results of inquiries that cleared up the interpretation of\nthe Cooper incident and show at the same time the source of my illusion in\nthe note made at this sitting of May 29th (p. 421) regarding the name John.\nMoreover I had explained the pertinence of the reference to \" John \" only\ntentatively, as I had no assurance that this John Cooper was not living,\nBut I wanted the apparent significance of the coincidence to be seen, on\nany theory possible in the case, as it actually represents what I shoulc\nhave expected father to mention in connection with Samuel Cooper ano\nwhen I consider his specially kind feelings and sympathies for John Coopei\nin his mental misfortunes, in spite of the alienation between himself and\nthe father of this John Cooper. But having found that this John Coopei\nis still living, the scepticism indicated in the note of May 31st is confirmed,\n\f.5oo [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nwhile the discovery of an extraordinary pertinence in the reference to \"the\nCooper school and his interest there\" removes the difficulty that I felt and\nexpressed in my first note on the case. There was also a misrepresentation\non my part of the first mention by my father of Cooper after my question\nsent to Dr. Hodgson. (See sitting of February ltith, p. 38fi.) The\ndistinction is actually drawn there between the Cooper I had in mind and\nthis Dr. Joseph Cooper that father evidently had in mind, but my complete\nignorance of this latter person made me assume that 1 was either dealing\nwith a confused memory or with the complexities of secondary personality.\nBut the fact that father had known of a \"Memorial School\" for thifl\nvery man, the pertinence and relevancy of the allusion to philosophical and\nreligious discussions with him, and the removal of the difficulty in connection\nwith the name \"John\" show a perfectly definite unity in this allusion\nhere in the sitting of May 29th. The following facts will explain the\nsource of my father's knowledge regarding this school and the importance\nof the reference to Dr. Cooper and the incidents of the sittings.\nMy father had taken the Christian Instructor ever since its organisation\nsome seventeen or eighteen years before his death. It was edited by my\nuncle, the husband of my aunt Nannie mentioned in these records, and who\nhad suddenly died seven weeks before my first sitting. Dr. Cooper took\nsick in the year 188(i, and the fact was mentioned in the columns of the\nInstructor. He himself, conscious of being on his death-bed, as indicated by\nthe language of his letter, wrote to my uncle a short letter on his views of\nthe resurrection, and it was published in the Instructor of July 29th, 188ft,\nwith a lengthy editorial by uncle in reply, taking issue with Dr. Cooper's\nview. On the date of August 2(,th the paper gave a notice of Dr. Cooper's\ndeath in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 22nd, in a prominent article. On\nSeptember 22nd a phototype memorial of Dr. Cooper was offered to sub\nscribers by the editor. In the issue of December 2nd mention was made of\nthe college at Sterling, Kansas, and also on December 9th. Cooper Memorial\nCollege was mentioned by name on the dates of January 20th, 1887, and\nNovember 3rd of same year, and then special attention called to it by name\nin a considerable article on September 20th, 1888. I did not examine\nfarther into the record of the paper, as the conspicuousness of all the notices\nis ample evidence that my father most likely obtained his knowledge of the\n\" Cooper school \" in this way. All the notices were as prominent as\neditorials.\nIt is perhaps worth observing that my father's allusion to the philosophic\ndiscussions and correspondence may be confused references to the correspond\nence of Dr. Cooper with my uncle, as the subject was the resurrection and\nimmortality. The misunderstanding would probably be Rector's. The\nmistake, taking the exact language of the record (p. 397\\ as it bears rather\nupon the question of communication, would be considerable, but it is con\nceivable that it might occur.\nOne of the most interesting features of the incident, after ascertaining its\npertinence to Dr. Joseph Cooper, is the reference to \"a journey which we took\ntogether.'' The \" Memorial School \" which I have mentioned as having been\nbuilt in memory of this man, was situated in Kansas, whither my father and\nstepmother went on a journey in 1884, and it is a pretty case of association\n\fXLI.] 501\nAppendix III.\nto note even that a journey is mentioned in this connection, though my\nstepmother's name is not mentioned with it. A similar possible interest\nattaches to the mention of the name Lucy, as discussed in the next note.\n(Note 40.) My note (p. 421) shows, however, that the connection here\nmight imply that the journey was either with this Cooper or with myself.\nThere is no specific mention or reference to my stepmother under\nany name. But the journey as a fact was never taken with this\nCooper, and the rapid movement of thought all along here from one incident\nto another makes it unnecessary to make the associative implication that the\njourney was with this man, while the law 'of association would be correct on\neither assumption regarding my stepmother or myself : for it was on the\njourney with her in 1884 that father visited the State in which the Cooper\nSchool was afterwards built and visited me in Chicago on his return (Cf. Note\n53, p. 507), while I took a journey with him West in 1861. But the more\nnatural association here would be my stepmother. Assurance that this is\nthe meaning is wanting for the reason that no name is mentioned. It is\ninteresting, however, to see that a natural and pertinent connection of\nthought is discoverable in the passage, even though we cannot regard it as\nevidential in specific characters.\u2014J. H. H.\nNute 40. \u2014My stepmother tells me that she had a cousin who was always\ncalled Thusie, her full name being Arethusa. Father visited this cousin in\nPennsylvania with my stepmother. The only reason, of course, for putting\nany possible meaning on this incident is the following. (1) The previous use\nof \"Nannie\" for my stepmother, as finally shown by the reference to\n\" Hettie's mother ' in the cap incident. (See sitting of June 7th, p. 478.)\n(2) The easy mistake which might occur in the regular difficulties connected\nwith proper names, especially when there is some resemblance between\n\" Lucy \" and \" Thusie.\" (3) The fact that the right relationship is stated in\nthe message, if the interpretation of the name be correct. (4) The refer\nence to my brother Frank in this connection associating him with a visit.\nIt was while reading the proofs that the fourth point in evidence occurred\nto me. It came to my memory like the vague recollection of a dream that\nmy father, together with my stepmother, had paid a visit with instead of to\nmy brother Frank in Pennsylvania, and I inquired to find that I was correct.\nBut this was in 1873, one year after my father's second marriage, while the\nvisit to my stepmother's cousin was in 1882 or 1883, when my brother Frank\ndid not accompany them. Have we here confused remnants and associations\nof both visits ? It is to be noticed also that this second visit was just a year\nor two before father made the trip West with my stepmother, and while he\nwas thinking of moving West. Have we then in the later allusion to having\nmentioned a trip West with my stepmother (p. 480) any reference to the\npresent message ? This later allusion looks too much like an echo of my\nquestion, as the reader will observe, to entertain this conjecture with any\nconfidence, but if we could suppose that the later spontaneous mention of\nthis previous reference was less confused than it may be, and was not a\nsuggestion, the induction in favour of the present possibility would be more\nplausible. But it can in no case be evidential. It depends on supposing\n\f502 [PART\n,\/. H. Hynhqi, Ph.D.\nthat \"Lucy\" is a mistake fur \" Thusie,\" while the supposition that\nthe reference to \"Nannie's cousin\" is a different mistake from the one\nassumed makes the case a possible reference to Lucy McClellan, and not\nwhat is here imagined. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 41.\u2014On investigation I find that my sister Anna died when she was\nnearly three years old, and we are hardly entitled to suppose on our ordinary\nknowledge of psychology that she would remember such an incident as is\nhere mentioned. Besides, we knew of no \"Allen boys.\" There were no\nAliens in our acquaintance. If 'we could suppose, however, first that we\nhave an abbreviation for \" McClellan \" in the word \"Allen,\" as that name\nand relationship figures here so frequently, and would fit, and second that\nthe incident is gotten in the same way that my brother Charles got the\nchimney incident, there might be a possible meaning to the case. But it\ncertainly cannot be verified, and has all the probabilities of ordinary\nmediumistic phenomena against it. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 42.\u2014My impression regarding the disposal of this horse was correct.\nI wrote to my brother regarding the matter, and his answer is as follows.\nThe special pertinence in the mention of this horse lies in the impetuous\ncharacter and excitable nature of the horse, always terribly afraid of the\nwhip, and the perpetual reminders which father used to give us not to excite\nhim with the whip or to overwork him. This was very frequent after the\nhorse became windbroken. My brother's account of the death and burial\nof the horse explains itself. When he wrote the letter he did not know\nthat I had to publish it, though its humour is not out of place.\nDeshler, Ohio, May 3Ut, 1899.\nPoor old Tom is dead, and was given a decent burial near the creek on\nthe Savel farm. I do not know whether he was shot when he became feeble\nor just \" went dead,\" but I was the sexton who officiated at his funeral, and\nI know that he was put four feet under the ground with his heels up. I do\nnot know any more about \" de-tail \" except that he always turned it over his\nback' George L. Hvsi.op.\nNote 43.\u2014Father's habit of reading his {taper in this rocking chair was\nconfirmed by my stepmother and it continued up to the time of his death.\nThe chair was a favourite of his, and had been long in his possession. \u2014J. H.H.\nNote 44.\u2014I find on inquiry that my impression here was incorrect. I\nremembered very distinctly special arrangements in connection with his chair\nwhen sitting up during his last sickness, and inferred the probability, though\ndoubtful of it as my note shows, that a stool had been used. But in the\nprocess of stating that the incident as I supposed it is not true, my step\nmother remarked that during the last years of his life father suffered from\ncold feet, and that she had provided him with a stool on which to place his\nfeet while warming them at the stove, but that he always refused to use it,\npreferring to put his feet into the oven for his purpose, and shoving the stool\naside. The mention of the name Nannie again in this connection has its\npertinence and confirms my conjecture in the case.\u2014J. H. H.\n\fXLI.] 503\nAppendix III.\nNote 45.\u2014If I were entitled to stretch things in this mention of names,\nespecially in connection with the clear name of my brother Robert, I could\ngive some meaning to them, for the next older brother is named William\nWallace. But the confusion is too great to say more than that this interpre\ntation is not impossible, though we must have sufficient evidence of auto\nmatism and meaning in such instances elsewhere to justify any tolerance for\nthe possibility. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 46.\u2014Inquiry does not make this incident of the injured foot any\nclearer. None of my brothers suffered such an accident. It may be that\nlater notes on the recurrence of the same incident will suggest a possible\ninterpretation to it, though I have no confidence in the matter, and would\nbe the last person to suppose it evidential in any case. (See sittings of\nMay 31st, p. 444, and June 1st, p. 450.)\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 47.\u2014Since writing the note on father's constant habit of reproving\nme for hard work I have read his letters to me since 1892, and they are full\nof reminders that I was overworking.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 48.\u2014On reading this reference to a fire, which is said to have given\nfather a fright, to my stepmother and sister, both recognised its meaning at\nonce. Both remember the incident very distinctly that gave father and\nthemselves a very decided fright. They were returning from a social party\nat a relative's, and saw evidences of a fire in the direction of the home, it\nbeing toward evening. Father had always been afraid of fire in his large and\ncostly barn, and in his fear of this was persuaded to insure the barn,\nafter some hesitation about the legitimacy of insurance at all, his objections\nto life insurance on religious grounds remaining, On this occasion they all\nfelt certain that the barn was on fire and possibly the home. A freight train\nblocked the way of haste, but as soon as this obstacle was out of the nay\nthere were many hysterical efforts to hurry home, and all the haste made\nthat was possible to reach the scene of danger, and they ascertained that the\nbuildings were safe only when they came over the hill near the house.\nFather had several frights from this fear of fire to the lnirn when waking\nfrom his sleep at night, and mistaking the moonlight for his burning barn.\nOnce he aroused all in the house only to find that it was an illusion caused\nin the usual way by the moonlight. But from this story of the facts we can\nreadily see how his memory was likely to be affected by his experience, and\nthat his impression and fright, as here described, or rather alluded to, was\nwhat it is represented to be. It is barely possible that I heard of the inci\ndent in father's letters of that date, which I do not possess now. But I was\nnot at home then.\nIt will be apparent to the reader who compares this case with the earlier\nallusion to a fire, that there is a decided difference between them in their\ndetailed meaning. (See sitting for December 26th, 1898, and also of\nFebruary 7th following pp. 324, 372.) If there is any proof of instances in\nwhich the communicator confuses a true incident beyond evidential recogni\ntion, the memory here of having referred to an incident which no one\nrecognised before would be indication of the fact, and may help us to suspect\n\f504 [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthat there is a basis of truth in other instances where similar confusion\nmars the evidential value of an incident that is suggested as possible.\u2014\nJ. H. H.\nNote 49.\u2014Subsequent study of this passage, beginning with the name\n\"Charles\" and terminating with that of \"John McClellan,\" suggests an\ninterpretation which is quite free from the difficulties indicated in the pre\nvious note. It was the result of Dr. Hodgson's remark to me that possibly\nmy question just preceding the message, \"Brother John,\" was either not\nheard or not appreciated, which is a very common thing, though it may be\ntaken up later. We have then only to suppose that there was no intention\nto say \" Brother John,\" as we should most naturally and perhaps justifiably\ninterpret the expression in all conversation where there are no difficulties in\ncommunication assumed, but that a single communicator said or tried to say,\n\" Brother and John McClellan,\" a part not being heard by Rector, or that\nas Charles shouted \"Brother\" my father tried to give the name \"John\nMcClellan,\" and I get the fragmentary result. The pissage, therefore,\ndown to the names which stand for my uncle Carruthers becomes clear and\nintelligible on either assumption.\nBut the names under which my uncle pisses in these records followed\nimmediately and have to be interpreted either as an incoherence due to\nautomatism or a part of the intention of the communicator. We have then\nthe several possible interpretations of the intentions of the communicator.\n(1) He may have been trying only to give the name of John McClellan, and\nthat of my uncle comes in as an automatism. (2) My brother Charles and\nmy father try together to give the name of John McClellan, and the\nname of my uncle slips in as an automatism. (3) My brother and father\nare trying to give the names of both my uncle Carruthers and this John\nMcClellan. (4) My uncle himself and my father are trying to give the\nnames of this uncle himself and that of John McClellan. (5) That in any\nof these suppositions this John McClellan is present to assist in getting the\nname of McClellan through.\nThe difficulty with the first hypothesis is that it cannot account for the\nname \" Charles \" and the allusion to him as brother, if we assume that my\nfather is the only communicator, and on the other hand there is no reason\nfor the later statement that my father is speaking if we suppose that my\nbrother Charles is the only communicator. It is more natural to suppose\nthat they are both present assisting each other, as is often the ease, according\nto appearances and statements in these records. I therefore reject this\nhypothesis as not the most intelligible one.\nThat the names of my uncle are not to be treated as automatisms in\neither the first or the second suppositions is tolerably clear from three con\nsiderations. First, in the sitting of the previous day (p. 422) my father had\ntried unsuccessfully to give the names McClellan and Carruthers in suc\ncession, and the attempts were marked with a great deal of confusion,\nwhether we attribute it to him or to Rector. Second, just preceding the\npresent messages and attempts at these names, father apologises for previous\nconfusion and asks that I allow him to straighten it out, an expression similar\nto one which he again uses later regarding the name of John McClellan\n\fXLI.] 505\nAppendix III.\n(pp. 448, 450). Third, the evident attempt in this same sitting of my cousin\n(p. 428) to mention the accident by which my uncle Carruthers lost his life.\nHence the probability is that the object of the attempt is to give the names\nof my uncle and that of McClellan with a view to suggest a point de repire\nabout which my mind may work when messages are sent.\nThere are two suppositions, different in character, which still come out to\nthis same conclusion. As my uncle Carruthers was so often called \" Charles \"\nwe might assume that he was meant in the tirst use of that name. Or we may\nsuppose that it was really my brother, as indicated in the language. The\nlatter is to me the simpler hypothesis and consists throughout with the idea\nthat the effort is to give the name of my uncle Carruthers along with that of\nMcClellan. But as an interesting illustration of complicated confusion in\nconjunction with merely fortuitously favourable conditions to produce\nit we can show how it might be possible to explain the same con\nclusion by supposing that it was my uncle himself with my father at the out\nset, and not my brother. His name was pronounced \" Crothers,\" the \" o \"\nbeing sounded as in \" brother,\" and he was my father's brother-in-law. In\nordinary parlance, as well as in communications like these, \"brother-in-\nlaw\" is often abbreviated to \"brother\" (Cj. p. 472). My question with the\nword brother in it might be interpreted as asking for my father's brother-in-\nlaw instead of my real brother, and the answer would be correct, supposing\nmy uncle's presence. If also we suppose, what is entirely possible, that\n\" brother \" in the message, \" Brother John,\" is Rector's mistake of the name\n\" Carruthers \" (pronounced \" Crothers \") we have an attempt to say possibly\n\" Carruthers and John McClellan, \" the first name becoming \" brother \" for\nlack of clear understanding on Rector's part, he having his apperception mass\ndetermined by my question with the word \"brother\" in it. This would\nmake especially intelligible the immediate mention of the names under which\nthis uncle had previously passed in the communications. That just such a\nconfusion might occur is well illustrated by the experiments through a tube.\nWitness \" turnips \" for \"gauntlets,\" \" change \" for \" strange,\" \" prythee \" for\n\"brother,\" \"thought\" for \"but,\" \"murder\"for \"weather,\" etc. (pp.627, 631).\nI doubt whether this more complicated interpretation is to be tolerated, but\nit is interesting to find that it consists with the same conclusion as the more\nsimple view while it has the advantage of indicating the problems with which\nwe have to contend in communications of this sort.\nNote 50.\u2014There is much obscurity in this passage referring to \"cousin\nAnnie,\" and the names Hettie and Ruth. I cannot see why they should be\nconnected with the name of John, which I suppose to refer to old John\nMcClellan, unless we assume that he is acting as an intermediary for my\ncousin Robert McClellan, his grandson. But assuming this, the reference to\ncousin Annie would be correct, from the standpoint of my cousin Robert\nMcClellan, and the message would be somewhat like that from my brother\nCharles at the next sitting, that of May 31st, when he referred to his \" new\nsister \" (p. 440). The reader will recognise Hettie as the name of my half-\nsister given a few minutes before the passage under consideration. Ruth is\nthe name of my cousin Robert McClellan's aunt, the deceased wife of the\nDr. Harvey McClellan I supposed intended the day before (p. 421), and\n\f50G [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nhence the daughter-in-law of this old John McClellan. The phrase, \"She\nis only a friend, I think,\" is apparently Rector's explanatory remark. It is\ncorrect in fact, as this Ruth was not a relative of the family, but only an\nacquaintance of my father. I never met her so far as I know. That my\nsister should speak of her could only be intelligible on the supposition that\nit was connected with conversation on the \" other side \" designed to have\nsome communication made relevant to her husband still living, and in which\nmy sister was to figure as intermediary. \u2014J. H. H.\nJnly 30th, 1900.\nNote 51.\u2014In my original note on this passage purporting to come from\nJohn McClellan, which was written in the fall of 1899 after the most\nthorough investigation, I stated that I could find no relevance in it.\nNone of the names had any pertinence in connection with the only John\nMcClellan about whom there could be any plausible reasons for inquiry.\nI said in concluding : \" It is the only case in the whole record (save the\ngroup of names in the first sitting) that does not yield some hint of true facts\nor connections that might start an intelligible clue to something as a reason\nfor such an extraordinary grouping of names.\" But the circumstance of\ntrying to obtain documentary confirmation other than the History of Greene\nCounty, Ohio, for the service of John McClellan in the war of 1812, led to\nthe discovery of the true facts. The details of this discovery and of the\ninquiries that resulted in it are given in a later note in connection with the\nincident of the lost finger. (See Note 94, p. 535.)\nBut the facts pertinent to this passage ascertained during the process of\ninquiry are that the John McClellan who is apparently meant here was not,\nso far as I can learn, a relative of the McClellan family with which I am\ndirectly connected, but a citizen of another part of the county in which\nI lived, and who died in 1850, four years before I was born. Hathaway was\nthe name of a cousin of John McClellan's son-in-law and probably associated\nwith the family. The connection of the Williams with John McClellan\nhas not been so definitely traced as yet, though Mr. Jamison, nephew of\nJohn McClellan, recalls the name as that of connections with his uncle.\nMy information puts their association probably as far back as 1825.\nThe most puzzling thing about the passage is to conjecture why I should\nhear from this John McClellan at all. He was, of course, personally\nunknown to me, as the date of his death indicates, and neither being a\nrelative, near or remote, of myself or the McClellans, that I knew nor even as\nmuch as heard of by the oldest of the surviving McClellans that were my\nrelatives, I cannot imagine why such a person should turn up. I could\npropose all sorts of excuses as to the reasons on the \"other side \" for such\nappearance, but they would have no weight. I can only remark that my\ngrandfather on my mother's side, and hence my mother also, lived in the\ngeneral neighborhood which was the home of this John McClellan, and may\nhave associated with him or his relatives. But this must have been long\nbefore my father's marriage. (January 5th, 1901.)\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 52.\u2014Since writing the note in the body of the detailed record\n(p. 438) I have been able to clear up only one thing in it, and a hint\ntoward this result was given in the message and correction by my uncle\n\fxLI.] Appendix III. 507\nJames McClellan in the sitting of June 6th. I have since ascertained that\nthis John McClellan, whom I had in mind at the time, and because of this\nfact directed my statements and questions accordingly, is still living ; in fact,\nI called on him for information regarding incidents and names connected\nwith statements here made. But the correction of June 6th (p. 471) makes\nclear who was meant, so that the John McClellan spoken of all along was a\ncorrect name, but I had never known any one by that name, so far as\nI could recall, except the one just mentioned. But it is apparent, as I\nsuspected at the time of the sitting and afterward, that my cousin Robert\nMcClellan appears in the question, \"Do you know where Frank Hyslop\nis,\" as his interest in my brother Frank while living would prompt him\nquite naturally to inquire in this way about him. The John McClellan that\nI had in mind might also naturally make a similar inquiry, because he and\nmy brother knew each other at the same college that I attended, of which this\nJohn McClellan was the treasurer. He knew that my brother had lost his\nhealth. Hence, assuming that I was dealing with one whose decease I did\nnot know, I pressed questions with a view to testing telepathy. The\nwhole passage, however, contained too much confusion, as I understood it at\nthe time, either to form any clear idea of its possible meaning or to estimate\nits bearing upon theoretical questions. But the sequel of my investigations\nshows that the passage obtains a better unity than I had suspected. (See\np. Ill and Note 94, p. 535). It is necessary also to remark that there is a\ncollege in the village near where my cousin lived, about which he and I\nhad some correspondence regarding my stepmother's going there to\nlive after father's death. Hence my question and the statements made\nare relevant enough, only I have not yet ascertained any truth or\nmeaning in the references either to my brother's being \"at the library\nand sending books over to him,\" or any other \"Frank\" in the same\nmatter. It is apparent, from the nature of the statements, that the\nmention of my brother Frank is an association elicited by the name of\nanother Frank in mind whose identity I have not yet been able to trace, and\nit is still more interesting to note that he adds the surname \"Hyslop,\"\nin order to distinguish the one Frank from the other.\nNote 53. \u2014I have now to reverse this note indicating that the statement\nabout the visit would be pertinent if it had been as that note indicates.\nMy father did visit me in Chicago in 1884, but not \"just before\" he\ndied. But the most interesting feature of the fact is that I had wholly\nforgotten this visit, so completely that I cannot recall a single incident of it\nand would not believe it were it not that my stepmother and sister who\nwere with father at the time, and my sister-in-law also, confirm the fact beyond\nquestion. It was on their return from the visit to Kansas in search of a place\nto which to move, the plan being changed in 1889 to go to another State. I\nwas teaching near Chicago at the time. I had just returned from Germany\nwhere I had been for two years, and as father had gone on this Western trip\nbefore I returned home, and had not seen me until on his way home, which\nlay through Chicago, I seem to have gone to the city and stayed all night at\nthe hotel with him and my stepmother and my sister, and the next day\nto have taken them to a panorama of the battle of Gettysburg, all of which\n\f508 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nI have totally forgotten, and have to accept on the testimony of the three\nparties mentioned.\nI do not refer to these facts to show the pertinence of my father's state\nment, but to show a most interesting defect of memory on my part, as both\nthe psychological relation of the remark and the allusion to the visit being\n\" just before he came here,\" indicate that the reference is to the subject of\nour conversations on the question of spirit return with which he closed his\ncommunications a few minutes previously (p. 438). Compare a similar error\nlater in the same connection, which was spontaneously corrected (p. 474).\nNote 64.\u2014Further study gives this communication a possible or probable\nmeaning which I had not suspected before. It did not occur tome at first to\ninterpret \" side \" as implying a blood distinction instead of locality. But if\nwe suppose this to be the intention and that my cousin was speaking of his\no?rn mother, as of course is most apparent, we have a very clear and\ncorrect message. My cousin's mother was my father's sister, and his step\nmother was my mother's sister. As I never knew his mother it was most\nnatural for him here to indicate who had spoken the name in order to prevent\nme from thinking it was his stepmother, who is also not living. It appears\nthus that his own mother is represented as acting the part of an assistant or\nintermediary to effect the communication of the name Lucy. The supposition\nof blood relationship, however, in the use of \" side \" involves supplying an\nomitted pronoun before the word \" father,\" referring to my father. This\nwould make the message as follows. \"(My) mother said it (Lucy) only a\nmoment ago and she is on (your) father's side, and he comes and speaks of her\n(Lucy) often.\" This would be equally correct in regard to previous commu\nnications and in regard to the natural relationships in the case. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 55. \u2014Information which I obtained personally in the West makes\nthis whole passage quite clear, and unravels the confusion which I remarked\nin my previous note. When ''aunt Nannie \" was mentioned I thought of\nmy aunt Nannie whom father had mentioned and who was also the aunt of\nmy cousin, Robert McClellan, who was communicating, and hence I treated\nthe cousin Nannie mentioned as his sister, but I found her still living.\nHence the passage appeared to be absurd, especially when I reflected on the\nstatement that this \"aunt Nannie\" was said to be my cousin. But when\ncalling attention to some of the absurdities of communications of this kind\nti) my cousin, Nannie Stephenson, the sister of the cousin communicating, I\nalluded ti , the contradiction in the passage here, and though all her convictions\nwere decidedly against spiritualism, genuine or spurious, she suddenly and\nto my surprise exclaimed: \"Yes, but brother Robert always called me\n'aunt Nannie,' especially during the last few months of his sickness.\" This\nwas probably in deference to the habits of his children. His sister had\nspent much of her time with him nursing him during this sickness. This\nstatement of his sister's at once threw clear light on the passage. It must be\nremembered also that I knew nothing of the facts here narrated. I did not\nknow anything about his illness, except that he was ill, and would not\nrecover. The letter I wrote to his wife to inquire and to express interest in\n\fXLI.] 509\nAppendix III.\nthe case was never answered, and no one else as much as told me the nature\nof the disease.\nIt is clear then that this \"aunt Nannie,\" who was his sister, was rightly\nsaid by Rector here to be my cousin, and then the statement that she was\nstill in the body becomes correct. But then the \" cousin Nannie \" who, as I\nI had her in mind, was his sister, is still living, so that the statement that\n\"cousin Nannie is in the spirit\" becomes false apparently. But it is\npossible that my cousin said \" cousin Annie,\" and that the proximity of the\nname to the writing of \" Nannie\" referring to his sister, made the machine\nwrite \"Nannie\" over again (Cf. Footnote, p. 238 and Note 95, ]i. 536).\nThis might easily occur either as a phonetic or a mechanical mistake. Now\nmy sister Annie, one of the communicators in this record, and to whom\nI suppose the \"cousin Nannie\" referred, was the full cousin of Robert\nMcClellan, the present communicator, and hence assuming this reference\nto have been his intention the statement would be correct. But it would\nmake the answer to my question absurd, unless we suppose, as is possible,\nthat what was in my mind and language was correctly understood, and that\nhis own reference to \"cousin Nannie\" (cousin Annie) was ignored, as we\nmay well suppose him ignorant of the machine's mistake.\nThe confusion as it appeared to my mind was a natural thing in my\nignorance of what my cousin called his sister, and it appeared worse as soon\nas I learned from my aunt that my cousin Nannie was still living, she being\nsaid here to be \" in the spirit.\" No difficulty attached to the statement that\nshe was \"Lucy's sister,\" because it is the habit of many people, and\nespecially among those of the locality concerned, to speak freely in less\naccurate conversation of sisters-in-law as sisters. But the whole case is\nmade clear by a knowledge of the communicator's habit of culling his sister\n\"aunt\" out of deference to the habit of his children, and by the possibility that\nthe \"cousin Nannie\" refers to his niece who is not living. It is simply a\ncase of different apperceptions on the two sides, both being correct though\nthe statements fit only one side. The point that must appear weak to the\nreader is the interpretation of the \"cousin Nannie\" that is necessary to\nmake it perfectly consistent and significant from the standpoint of the\ncommunicator.\nAnother interpretation to this whole passage is possible, and in fact\nresults in the same conclusion as the first, though it represents the unity of\nthe case in a much more complex form. It involves also more dramatic play\nthan in the view of the previous note, with perhaps stronger evidence on that\naccount for the spiritistic theory.\nIf we go back to the appearance of my cousin and accept my conjecture\nthat he failed (p. 442) to finish his sentence in the attempt to say that he\nwanted to reach \"all his dear '' relatives, we shall notice that the reference\nto the name of his wife is Rector's statement after my cousin has been told\nto \"go out\" and come again. Then Rector explains that the Lucy is not\nMiss Lucy Edmunds, the sister of the Jessie mentioned, but some one\nrelated to me. In the reply that he then makes to Dr. Hodgson's request\nhe states a fact which rather indicates that he thought this Lucy was the\none that \"Annie and her father,\" these being my father and sister, had\nbrought with them several times to the communications. The fact was\n\f,510 [part\nJ. H. Hyxhrp, Ph.D.\nthat this Lucy was still living, and my conjecture is that the one\nthey had brought with them was the communicator's mother, Mary\nAmanda, sister to my aunt Nannie and my father, and mother to the\n\"aunt Nannie\" here called my cousin as explained. Rector's state\nment, therefore, that \"aunt Nannie will know well,' assuming that it\nrefers to my aunt by that name and mentioned throughout these sittings, and\nwho also was the aunt of the supposed communicator, my cousin, would\nstill be correct and fitting, and it would not be necessary to sup1iose that it\nwas either a direct or indirect message from my cousin giving the form in\nwhich he called his sister during the illness in which she nursed him. My\n\"aunt Nannie\" would know both this Lucy McC'lellan intended and the\n\"cousin Nannie,\" whether taken as a reference to my cousin by that name or\nas a mistake for my sister Annie. She would also know the person said to\nhave been \"brought here several times before,\" whom I have supposed to be\nmy aunt Nannie's sister and mother of my cousin Nannie, and who was\nalways called Amanda. But it would be simpler and just as pertinent to\nmake the \"aunt Nannie \" refer to the communicator's sister, as the explana\ntion that she was my cousin would indicate, and this would involve no\nassumption of confusion. When Rector says: \"She is a cousin of thine,\nfriend,\" he does not indicate whether he means my cousin Nannie, sister of\nthe communicator, or the Lucy that had been mentioned, who is also my\noousin by marriage, being the wife of the communicator. My opinion is\nthat Rector, not understanding Dr. Hodgson's question, as actually indicated,\nrefers to the communicator's mother whose name he could not get, but hoped\nto suggest by the reference to the communicator's sister, here called \" aunt,\"\nas explained, and who was my cousin. But when I make my statement that :\n\" I remember one cousin Nannie and one aunt Nannie,\" the reply shows a\nbetter comprehension of the situation. The statement that \" Aunt Nannie\nis in the body\" is correct, and if the statement that \"cousin Nannie is in\nthe spirit \" can be interpreted to mean my sister Annie, this is also correct, and\nthe next statements in response to my further question as to \"what relation\nthis cousin Nannie was to you,\" the communicator, were exactly correct from\nthe standpoint of my earlier question in which I had my cousin by that name\nin mind, the sister of the communicator.\nHence, on any interpretation, we either get what is false and inexplicable\nby telepathy, or what is true from two separate standpoints and too complex\nboth in its truth and misunderstandings to be easily amenable to telepathy\nas we know its operations.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 56.\u2014This passage has always remained psychologically puzzling.\nThere is nothing in the thoughts with which my father left the \" machine \" a\nfew minutes before to suggest the connection which my note in the detailed\nrecord indicates. Nor is it materially connected with the communications\nfrom my cousin, which it immediately follows. I had originally supposed\nthat it was an attempt on the part of my father to resume matters connected\nwith the confusion about my mother and stepmother, occasioned by my\nstatement just before he left. I assumed that the sentence \"Don't you\nremember her\" came from him and referred to one of the two just mentioned.\nBut this may as well refer to the Lucy just indicated, no matter who the\n\fXLI.] 511\nAppendix III.\ncommunicator is, whom I now suppose to have been my cousin who exclaimed\nthis just as he left the \"machine.\" Hence we may assume that my father\neither begins a new subject with the announcement of his presence, con\nnected with the McClellan family and suggested by what he sees and hears\ngoing on while my cousin is communicating, or that he is attempting in a\nconfused manner to unravel the threads connected with my mother and step\nmother. I could give a strained interpretation in favour of the latter\nalternative, assuming certain mistakes, but it would not even then escape a\nreference to the McClellans, as this connection is unmistakable in the\nallusion to \"John's wife\" and the statement that she is still living. But\nthe accidental discovery that the name Sarah, a fact unknown to me, had a\ndirect pertinence for John McClellan's family opened the way to the first\ninterpretation as the more probable. This view is especially reinforced by\ntwo facts. (1) The same grouping of names, with the exception of Maria,\nat a sitting on February 7th, 1900, and not included in the present report.\n(2) The indications on this occasion, and possibly in the frequent allusions of\nthe present record, of some solicitude for this John McClellan, which his\ndeath about seven months later justified (Cf. Footnote, p. 471). Hence my\nadoption of the note embodied in the detailed record (p. 444).\nBut all who are familiar with pseudo-mediumistic phenomena will remark\na very close resemblance to fishing and guessing in the names here given and\nwhich seem to have the coincidental import which my note indicates or\nsuggests. I am far, of course, from regarding it as fishing of any kind, after\nwhat I have seen in the Piper case, though I would treat it so in any record\nnot fulfilling the demands for evidence of personal identity in a better\nmanner than this. But while I cannot for a moment regard it as supplying\nthe slightest evidence of a spiritistic sort, I have described its possibilities\nfor the two reasons, first, that the fact shows it is not necessarily false, but\nis possibly true in intention, and, second, to call attention to the resemblance,\nin external features at least, to the phenomena of fishing and guessing. \u2014\nJ. H. H.\nNote 57.\u2014There has dawned upon me, on re-reading the passage about the\ninjured foot, and remarking the capital letter \"F \" just before the hesitation\nabout brother Will's name, that instead of \" injured foot\" we ought to have\n\" injured leg.\" This would apply very distinctly to my brother Frank, whose\ninitial is here given. It is apparent from my question, as stated in the\nprevious note, that I was after the accident which caused the death of my\n\"uncle Charles,\" while nothing but \"accident\" was mentioned by my\nfather. Now it was an accident to his leg that was the occasion of my\nbrother Frank's loss of health. It was a heavy fall while engaged at\ngymnastics in college. The injury was one that produced the same effect\nin my brother's use of his leg that father's injury in the sixties produced\nin his leg. I remember father's speaking of the resemblance before he\ndied. This he intimated in his letters to me. Hence it was the expres\nsion : \"He got it injured and so did I\" that indicated to me the\npossibilities of the case, on the assumption that there was some confusion of\nmemory, caused paitly by the conditions of communication (which cannot be\nassumed in the evidential problem at first) and partly by the confusing nature\n\f512 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nof my own question, as it was not on a railroad that my brother was injured.\nBut with all its possibilities the passage is not clear enough to be given the\nslightest evidential value, and could only be explained on the spiritistic\ntheory after we had given sufficient evidence that confusion and mistakes of\nthis kind actually happened. There are unmistakable evidences of such\nerrors, whether they are so indefinite as this or not. Besides there are the\nthree facts in favor of the ]mssibilities mentioned :\u2014(1) The initial of brother\nFrank's name ; (2) The recognition of the resemblance to his own injury ;\nand (3) The hesitation about the connection of the injury with my brother\nWill.-J. H. H.\nJuly 11th, 1900. \u2014Since writing the above note I have recalled the fact\nthat my brother Frank was agent for Dr. Chase's Receipt Book ami Household\nPhysician, and that it was while walking on his journeys to sell the book\nthat he broke down with spinal irritation and symptoms of locomotor ataxy,\ndue to this overtaxing of his energies so soon after recovering from his fall in\nthe gymnasium. If we could connect the allusion of my cousin to an injured\nfoot of one of the Hyslop boys (pp. 427-8) with this reference to an intention\nto be a doctor, we might, in spite of the confusion, imagine an attempt here\nto speak of Frank's work, which was very suggestive of an itinerant doctor.\nThere is no excuse for this supposed possibility except the uniform confusion\nof my cousin in his communications and the apparent evidence in these\nexperiments and others that association often seems to confuse and distort two\nseparate and similar events. I had asked for the accident to my uncle and it is\nconceivable that reference to his injury may have been mixed up with the\nthought of an injury to my brother's back and leg. That is I may get only\nfragments of two separate events. I do not entertain the possibility of this\nwith any degree of confidence whatever. Nevertheless, I inquired of my\nbrother Frank if my cousin ever talked to him jokingly about his being a\ndoctor, and the reply is that on one occasion, just after his return from\ncollege and after Frank had been canvassing for the book, my cousin\n\" chaffed \" and joked him about being a doctor.\u2014J. II. H.\niVofe 58.\u2014There was so much possible pertinence in the statement here\nput into the mouth of my stepmother that even at the expense of a little\npersonal flattery I inquired whether it was true or not. My stepmother\nwrites in answer to the question whether she ever used such language regard\ning me, as follows :\u2014\" I have many times made this remark to your father\nwhen we were both severely tried to know what to do, ' If the children were\nall like James and Frank we would have no trouble.' \" The implied com\nplaint against the others in this and father's language is not so severe in fact\nas may appear, for it really refers to the consequences of neglecting to\nrespond to father's requests and needs as promptly as should have been the\ncase. But I know from both my correspondence and from my memory that\nfather's worry on such occasions was considerable, as he was himself always\nprompt in business obligations and disliked delay and negligence. My step\nmother's confirmation of the language here, then, shows how very pertinent\nit is to the question of identity, and hence my justification for dwelling upon\nsuch personal matters. \u2014J. H. H.\n\fXLI.] 513\nAppendix III.\nNote 59.\u2014The allusion to \"a cousin John\" here in connection with my\nuncle James McClellan has always puzzled me. I had a cousin John, but he\nwas in no way connected with the McClellans and there is not the slightest\nindication here that I am dealing directly or indirectly with him. He died\nwhen I was a very young child and I remember his death as having given me\nmy first shock in regard to that dread visitor. Nor is there any clear reason\nto suppose that the person meant is the John McClellan in the earlier com\nmunication (pp. 431 and 438), as he was not a relative of either my family or\nthat of the communicator. I have ascertained one fact beyond my knowledge\nat the time of the sitting and which reflects some light on the case and indicates\nits possible connection with the John McClellan whom I know. I seem\nto be communicating with my uncle James McClellan, as the messages make\nclear. I learned from several parties in the West, members of the McClellan\nfamily, that there was a sister Mary Ann and that she is not living. Now\nit turns out that I knew her while at the university, but knew her only by her\nmarried name, Mitchell. I knew nothing of her death so far as I am aware.\nIt may be that I once knew she was a sister of the McClellans. It is more\nthan probable that I did, and probable that I knew her name as Mary\nMitchell, but I am quite certain that I never heard the Ann part of it.\u2014\nJ. H. H.\nNote 60.\u2014There is a matter of interest upon which I could not comment\nat the time of the sittings because I was not certain of the fact that I\nrecalled when making my notes. I have ascertained by inquiry what I\nthought was true ; namely, that my uncle James McClellan died of\npneumonia. This fact gives a singular interest to the message. I had in\nmind my \" uncle Charles,\" or \" Clarke \" as he is sometimes called, and hence\nwas trying to run down the incident that caused his death. But it is evident\nfrom what was said about clearing up matters referring to James and John\nMcClellan, and from the statement that \" Clarke\" was mentioned for a mere\nrecollection, that father had my uncle James McClellan on his mind. Now,\nthe chief interest to be noted first is that this uncle James McClellan married\nmy father's sister, and so did also my \"uncle Charles\" or \"Clarke\" marry\nanother sister, the Eliza of earlier sittings. (See sittings of December 24th\nand 26th, 1898.) Hence it is equally true of my uncle James McClellan that\nhe was related \"only by marriage \" to my father, and also truer of him than\nmy uncle \" Charles \" that he has been on that side \" for some time.\" With\nhim evidently in mind the answer \" pneumonia\" to my question is perfectly\ncorrect. The reference to the interruption by Charles, my brother, now\nobtains a singular interest, as it is correct that he died with a fever.\n(See sittings of December 23rd and 26th, 1898.) Now the allusion to\nbeing \" disturbed because of the accident \" apparently denotes father's\ndiscovery of the fact that I had my \"uncle Charles\" in mind, as is also\napparently indicated by the interruption of my brother Charles, the whole\npassage at this point being part of the conversation carried on between\nRector and the several persons on the other side. They seem to suppose\nthat when I say \" uncle Charles \" I mean my brother, and that I am not clear\nabout my uncle. Hence, when brother Charles gets my inquiry here, know\ning that I have made it before in connection with the name \"uncle Charles\"\n\f514 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nas I get it, he imagines that I am asking for his illness still, and inteiTupts\nwith his statement about a fever, as the supposed answer to my question.\nMy father, however, with a more correct suspicion of my misunderstanding,\nand seeing that I have in mind my \"uncle Charles \" alludes to \"the accident\nthat I (he) could not make clear.\" The passage thus becomes wonderfully\nclear and interesting, if we can be allowed thus to reconstruct it consistently\nwith the facts, and with what we know of the sources of confusion in such\nexperiments, precisely as they occur in the telephone. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 61.\u2014Some interest attaches to this name of which I was not certain\nat the time of the sitting. The name of my older sister who died when I\nwas two years old was Margaret Cornelia. She was named for an aunt\nCornelia, whom we called \"aunt Cora.\" But the manner in which my sister\nspeaks of the person named indicates that it is more prolmbly this aunt to\nwhom she refers. This view appears to be suggested by the remark \"what\nfather calls her,\" in connection with the evident difficulty of getting the\nname right and the fact that my sister can hardly be supposed to remember\nthis aunt, who is still living, as my sister died when nearly three years old.\nBut she can be supposed to know my sister Margaret Cornelia, though not\nuntil after her own death, assuming spiritism true of course, as my sister\nAnnie was born after the death of Margaret Cornelia. Moreover in the\nnext sentence my sister asks my mother to help her to give the name she had\njust tried. Now my mother was always very affectionately attached to this\naunt Cora, her own sister, and was possibly present at the first sitting when\nthe name \" Corrie \" was mentioned (p. 310), in connection with other sisters\nof both my father and mother. My father is confessedly present at this\nsitting of June 1st, and the allusion to what he calls her is especially\npertinent, because, if 1 remember rightly, he always alluded to her as aunt\nCornelia, while my mother called her \"Cora\" and we children aunt Cora.\nThere would be no such a conjunction of facts to suppose that the allusion is\nto my sister Margaret Cornelia, though she would probably have been called\n\" Cora \" had she lived. Besides it would have been specially evidential, for\ntwo reasons, to have mentioned this aunt Cornelia, both pertinent to my\nmother.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 62.\u2014I have already made clear, in the previous note, the possible\nmeaning of the name \"Cora,\" and need not repeat the matter to clear up\nthe note made after the sitting. But I have also acquired information that\nthrows light on the reference to \"Jennie,\" and so clears up the whole\npassage. \"Jennie \" is the name of the sister to the Lucy who is mentioned,\nthe latter being the wife of Robert McClellan, my cousin, for whom my\nsister is acting as intermediary, and hence this \"Jennie\" is his sister-\nin-law. I never knew her, or even knew of her existence. I knew\nabsolutely nothing of Lucy McClellan's connections. It will thus be quite\napparent what significance the linking of the two names means in connection\nwith the intermediation for my cousin Robert McClellan. It is pertinent also\nfor my sister to say that \" father knows about her better than I do,\" referring\nto cousin Lucy, for my sister never knew her at all, as my cousin's wife\ncame into the acquaintance of our family only after she married my cousin,\n\fXLI.] 515\nAppendix III.\nwhich was long after my sister's death. The allusion to grandmother\nwould occasion difficulty to the passage if connected with my cousin Lucy in\nthe plain indication of the message taken in its strict context. But if the\ntwo sentences are separated, and the phrase, \" Lucy is there \" be interpreted\nto mean that she is on this side, that is, living, the case is perfectly clear, and\nthis was the interpretation that I gave it at the sitting, and see no reason to\nchange it, though it is undoubtedly equivocal, and if it were not for the\npertinence and clearness of the rest of the passage would be evidence of\nsome confusion. Two sisters-in-law might be mentioned.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 63.\u2014It will be remembered that in the note to the sitting of May\n30th I was unable to attach any meaning to the name Peter. It was the\nsame at this sitting, but as the message purported to come from my cousin\nRobert McClellan whose older sou was named George, I resolved to inquire\nwhen in the West whether this George ever had a dog named Peter. When\nthe first reference to it occurred I was thinking of my brother George, as\nthe incident about the injured foot was calculated to keep my mind in\nthe direction of my own family. But I knew that it could have no possible\napplication to my brother in connection with Robert MoClellan, and so\ntreated the reference as a case of confusion which is so prevalent with this\ncommunicator, and it turns out so with the name \"Nanie,\" so far as can\nnow be ascertained. On the first chance, therefore, I asked George McClel-\nlan's younger brother whether George ever had a dog by the name of Peter,\nand received a negative answer. I did not explain why I asked it. I learned\nafterward from my cousin that he laughed about my question to his\nmother as being very funny, and repeated to her his denial of the fact, when\nshe contradicted him and said it was true. I saw her the next day and\nsiscertained that George did have a little ugly black dog named Peter when\nhe was between two and four years of age, and also that his father did not like\ndogs because of his fear of hydrophobia. When I asked George himself some\ndays after the same question, he being a resident of another city, he said he\nremembered only a dog by the name of Jack, which he had when he was five\nor six years old. Thinking then that there might be some mistake about the\nname on the part of the mother, I wrote to her to know if George's dog was\nnot named Jack instead of Peter, and I have the reply that both are correct,\nthat his first dog was named Peter, and was owned, by him between his\nsecond and fourth years, and that his next was named Jack, and owned when\nhe was five and six.\nIt is worth adding in reference to possible telepathy from my mind to\naccount for this incident, that I never knew of the existence of this dog or of\nany dog owned by this second cousin. I never knew this cousin at all until he\nwas between seven and ten years old, and saw him only a few times after that\nuntil he was grown up. His father, Robert McClellan, lived some distance\nfrom the old homestead, to which he moved some years after the death of\nhis father in 1876, my uncle James McClellan. (See sitting for June 6th.)\nI never visited my cousin Robert McClellan until after I graduated from\ncollege in 187V, and hence did not see him in the home he had before he\nmoved to his own old homo after his father's death. Consequently his son\nwas at least seven and perhaps ten years old before I knew anything about\n2 L 2\n\f516 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nhim except his name and relationship to me. It is apparent, therefore, how\nlittle I was likely to know about his pets at two and four years of age.\u2014\nJ. H. H.\nNote 64.\u2014Inquiry in the West throws new light on this whole passage\nbeginning with the reference to my brother George, and changes its possible\ninterpretation considerably. It will be noticed that I said in my note on the\nreference to my brother George that it was evidentially indefinite. It was\napplicable to him in its incidents, but not in itn emotional tone, as the\ndifference with him about his social relations did not represent so decided\nanxiety as is implied here. The objections were not moral at all, but were\ntKised upon the probable life that my brother would lead as a farmer. But\nwhat I learned regarding the incident of the fish, about which I knew\nnothing until told it here at the sittings, shows that it is probable that my\nfather had my brother Robert in mind, and that he made, strange to say, a\nmistake similar to the one made later in the guitar incident (p. 461). This is\nindicated by the association of the name of my brother Frank with the same\nand following incidents. I ascertain from him that the incident of the fish is\nnot quite right. It was not on a Sunday that it occurred. It seems that\nFrank and Robert were promised one Friday that they could go fishing on\nhalf the day Saturday if they finished their work. They did so, and went\nthe next day to enjoy their fishing, but did not return until late in the after-\nn<mn and had to pay the penalty for taking time not given them. My\nfather believed that Saturday afternoon and evening should be employed,\nas far as posible, in preparing for the religious duties of the Sabbath\nor Sunday, and often spoke of this to us. At least my brother Frank\nremembers no case of fishing on Sunday as is implied in the communi\ncation. Now another mistake occurs here, which I could not detect at\nthe time because I did not know whether the reference to what appeared\nto be Frank's social evenings was true or not. It will be seen that\nI doubted it at the time, and hence I asked the question if Frank was meant\non purpose to determine this doubt. The affirmative answer made it\nnecessary to inquire of him personally to ascertain its truth. Now my\nbrother Frank says that neither father nor aunt ever complained of his place\nof calling, as he had none at all. This confirms my conjecture at the time\nthat the reference would have been more pertinent if made to my brother\nRobert. In fact it is so pertinently applicable to him and involves such\npersonal and private matters that it is impossible to state the case as the\nevidential problem would require. It becomes apparent at this point that the\nreference to George was a mistake for Robert. The whole emotional and\nmoral tone of it applies more distinctly to him than to the event that I had\nin mind in reference to George, as the evident recurrence to the same facts\nin the allusion again to spending the evenings and \"temptation\" shows.\nThe mistake of names disturbs the evidential value of the incidents very\nmuch, but to me it would have such extraordinary pertinence if this mistake\nhad not been made, and if I could narrate the facts that show that\npertinence, that I have suffered myself to reconstruct it in the way I have\ndone simply to indicate how near the truth it comes. Corroborative of my\ninterpretation I have ascertained from two parties, besides my own memory,\n\fXLI.] 517\nAppendix III.\nthat my aunt and father did talk to my brother Robert about the very\nincident so clearly intimated here.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 65. \u2014I find by inquiry that the chimney referred to here was not\ntaken down on the building of the kitchen, but was modified by means of an\niron cover, the chimney never having been restored to its original height\nafter the accident from the cyclone. A part of it was removed after\nthe cyclone. I had merely inferred its taking down from my memory\nof its foreshortened appearance caused by the building of the new\nkitchen and the fact that I find it is not so high as I have represented it\nin my former note. The question, then, about its being taken down must\nbe interpreted either as containing a false implication or as referring to its\nhaving been blown down by the cyclone, and hence to the same incident\nimplied by the allusion to what \" happened \" to it. But there is a good\nlesson here against drawing inferences from one's memories, even though the\nfacts of the case consist with the inference. I find by inquiry also that we\nhad no aunt Lucy whatever. I was wholly mistaken regarding the name of\nthe aunt in mind.\nNote 66.\u2014I refused to comment on this reference to \"Dr. Pierce \" at the\ntime of the sitting because I thought possibly there might have been a\ndoctor by that name who attended my uncle at his death by the accident,\nthough I suspected that the name was a mistake for another doctor whom I\nknow very well. But I have been absent from this town for so many years\nthat it was possible for any number of unknown physicians to have installed\nthemselves there in the meantime. Hence before venturing to state my\nconjecture regarding the possibility of this name I waited to inquire. I find\nthat no \" Dr. Pierce \" attended my uncle and that there is none such in that\nplace. But Dr. Harvey McClellan, who was indicated apparently at a\nprevious sitting and also at a later sitting, in both cases by my father (pp.\n425, 491), was one of the attending physicians when my uncle's leg was ampu\ntated. But no \"Dr. Pierce \" was present. This, of course, is not asserted or\nimplied, but in the sitting for June 5th my brother Charles indicates that he\nwas a friend of my uncle \" Clarke \" which is true, if the name be interpreted\nas a mistake for the man I had in mind when reading the record over\nafterward. The true name should have been Dr. J. P. Dice. It can\nbe seen by those who are familiar with these experiments how Rice and\nPierce might be mistaken by Rector for the name I have given. The letter\n\" P\" becomes crowded into the attempt at \"Dice\" and the name becomes\n\" Pierce.\" This is of course conjecture, but it shows a possibility at least,\nthough it is not evidential. Cf. case of cat's name, Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\np. 20. Also a similar mistake in case of a dog's name, Vol. VI., p. 620.\nIn both Pick was given for Dick.\nNote 67.\u2014I made personal inquiry of my brother Robert to know\nwhether his eyes have been giving him any trouble and received a negative\nreply. He says that at no time have his eyes troubled him. I asked him the\nquestion before he knew anything about my reasons for asking it, and I plied\nhim with various queries to see if there was even the trace of a truth in the\n\f518 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nstatement made by the communicator, and the straight answer was always\nthat neither at present nor in the 1Kist have his eyes troubled him in the\nleast. I had an impression at the time that the statement was true, though\nI knew that it would apply more correctly to the next older brother, Will,\nwho has had very considerable trouble with his eyes for more than a year.\nThe difficulty began with what he represented to me as poisoning, and was a\nsource of some danger and alarm to him at one time. But they are now\nbetter, though still troublesome. The allusion in the question \" Are those\nhis children ? \" would also have possible pertinence to brother Will, whose\ntwo children father knew well enough before his death, and we could assume\nconversation about them possibly. But as it is interpreted by Rector to\nhave been interruption we cannot attach any evidential importance to it.\nOn the spiritistic hypothesis the mistake involving a confusion of one brother\nwith the other would be natural enough for Charles to make, considering that\nRobert was not born until seven months after Charles's death and that Will\nwas only two years old at the time. Besides, we may suppose that in the\nconfusion, incident to the interruption, Charles' thought may have passed\nto my brother Will, and the latter's name escaped the machine. But these\nfacts, while they may explain the naturalness of the mistake, do not give it\nevidential value.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 68.\u2014The statement of Rector, after f had said : \" I do not under\nstand,\" that it \" was only interruption,\" may show that 1 have no right to\nassume that the question : \" Are those his children t \" has the meaning that 1\nhad supposed, namely, a mistaken reference to the children of my brother\nRobert, ft is much rather to be interpreted as an automatism due to a\nremark of some one on the \"other side\" which gets written down before\nRector discovers its irrelevance to the communications from my brother\nCharles. This automatism could occur in several ways which it is not\nnecessary to unravel here, as even its very existence has to be conjectured,\nor accepted on the veracity of Rector, and I will not press the intelligibility\nof the statement farther than to say that, on any theory, we can discover a\nunity in the whole passage by treating the reference to children as an\nirrelevance precisely as the statement about the interruption would most\nnaturally imply that it is. Had my brother Charles given the name of my\nbrother Will when he resumed his messages this view of the case would\nhave been much clearer to the general reader. (Jan. 20th, 1900.)\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 69.\u2014I ascertained by personal inquiry in the West an incident that\nmakes my conjecture probably the right one, namely, that it was my cousin\nRobert McClellan that was communicating. When I read the passage to his\nsister, referred to in the sitting for May 31st as \"aunt Nannie \" and his\n\"sister,\" she remarked that there was no meaning in the mention of the\nbook of poems. She went on to say spontaneously, however, and without\nany indications that she was mentioning a pertinent fact, that as she had\nnursed him for several months, she had taken to him and read to him a book\ncalled \" Morning Thoughts.\" The end of each chapter is made of a rather\nlong poem.\u2014J. H. H.\n\fXLI.] 519\nAppendix III.\nNote 70.\u2014Inquiry results in the confirmation of only one of the incidents\nin answer to my request for facts that I did not know, and this is the name\nof the orphan boy, Jerry, who had been taken into the family, and whom I do\nnot remember personally. My aunts remember none of them except this one,\nand they recognise the pertinence of this very distinctly. There was the\nspecial reason for mentioning this boy, that he was rather good-natured, but\ndull to learn, and often got into trouble innocently by not knowing the risks\nand dangers to which his curiosity exposed him. For instance, he got his\nface badly burnt by powder in a foolish experiment with it ; had the skin\ntaken off his tongue by putting it against a frozen axe ; was in the habit of\ngoing to sleep in church, and when awakened up would drop off into sleep\nagain while putting a clove into his mouth, etc. These and many other\nincidents made him the subject of much amusement and story telling in the\nfamily and elsewhere. He came into the family, according to my aunt's\nstatement, about the year 1855, but she does not remember when he left.\nAll that I can remember is that he enlisted in the Civil War. I recall hearing\nthis told, but do not remember it personally.\nThere is a peculiar interest and possibility connected with the shoe and\nsock incident. It is consciously recognised that no one living can verify it.\nMy father says that only his mother and the Rogers girl can testify to it. I\nhave a strong recollection that I have heard my grand uncle (who died many\nyears ago and to whom no allusion is made in this record) mention the name\nRogers. He was the brother of my grandmother here mentioned. But as\nmy two aunts do not recall any one by the name of Rogers, I have to discount\nmy own memory in the case. But it is certainly interesting to find the name\nthus connected with my father's mother and connected in my own memory\nonly with her brother. It is noteworthy, too, that this incident is omitted\nfrom the list which I was admonished at Dr. Hodgson's sitting of July 6th\nto inquire into carefully (p. 497).\nIt is not surprising that my aunts cannot remember these incidents,\nassuming that they are even possibly true, because they are so small and\ntrivial that they might well be forgotten by them, though remembered by\nfather. My experiments on the \"Identification of Personality\" very fre\nquently show the same difference of memory between the communicator and\nthe receiver of messages. (Of. references, p. 268.) But it will interest\nthe advocate of telepathy that the only incident which my aunts recall\nis also one that I knew, namely, the name of \" Jerry,\" the orphan\nboy. But they could be expected to remember him, because his place\nin their experience was too prominent to be forgotten as easily as the\nother incidents. If they could have been verified they would have\nhad almost irresistible evidential force in the case. But the best that\ncan be said of them is that we do not know whether they are true or\nfalse.\u2014J. H. H.\n[I may add, however, that by persistent inquiry I found that one of the\nmain factors in one of the incidents was true, and of course unknown to me.\nBy the time that I began to push my investigations into details my two\naunts, Nannie and Eliza, became violently hostile to answering my ques\ntions and took every opportunity to deny what was not technically correct\nall the way through. But incidentally it came out that my aunt Eliza did\n\f520 [part\nJ. H. HysUrp, Ph.D.\nwalk home from a prayer meeting with a, certain young man, and was teased\nabout it by father. But his name was not Baker. (June 28th, liKX)). \u2014\nJ. H. H.]\nNote 71. \u2014This communication direct from my uncle James McClellan,\nwho waH the father of my cousin Robert McClellan, and who has communi\ncated so often, has very considerable interest, as much for the error of\nmemory among his brothers still living as for similar errors on the other\nside.\nThe first incident is that in which he said that he always despised the\nname Jim. This could not be taken from my memory for two reasons.\n(1) I myself never despised the name, and (2) I never knew that my uncle\ndid so. As my former note indicates, I at once saw that the statement was\npertinent on the ground of what I did remember, namely, that we always\ncalled him \" uncle Mack.\" But I do not recall ever having the fact explained,\nas we called one of his nephews, my cousin, also by the name \" Mack.\" But\n1 asked one of his daughters, the \"Nannie \" in the communications from my\ncousin Robert McClellan, whether this statement about his despising the\nname Jim was correct or not, and she did not know or could not remember.\nWhen I read the passage to another daughter, she broke out laughing and\nsaid that it was perfectly true, recalling the fact that her mother often\ncorrected the neighbours for calling him Jim, and would often say to the\nfamily that she was afraid she would be called proud on account of her tastes.\nThe community was a pioneer one, and those who chose to adopt certain\nrefinements of civilisation had often to suffer the criticism of their neighbours,\nwho said people were \" proud \" if they showed any solicitude on matters of\nthis sort.\nThe correction of the mistake in the name \"cousin John\" is very\ninteresting, as it was purely voluntary on the part of the persons on the side\nof the communications. Of course the letter from the son of this John\nMcClellan had put me in knowledge of the fact that he was still living, and\nthe circumstance becomes amenable to telepathy, though the dramatic play\nof personality involved is a difficulty in the way of the view, especially the\nstatement that I must remember his brother John if I was James, as my\nuncle, who was rather a favourite of mine, died while I was at college in the\ntown where his brother .John McClellan lived, as indicated before. The\nmanner too, in which some confusion occurs between the names of his\nbrother John and his father John is an interesting fact, though it is quickly\ncleared, and the circumstance represents a fact wholly beyond my knowledge,\nas I never knew his father personally or by name, so far as I can remember.\nThe correction of the statement that this brother was in the war is also\nan incident of some importance. It turns out to be true that the brother was\nnever in any war, and the confusion between the two names is still apparent\nin the attempt to communicate, though immediately corrected, and the\nreference made to his father as the one who was in the war, which I find\nalso to have been incorrect.\nThe inquiries that led to the discovery that this statement about my uncle's\nfather having been in the war is false are detailed in Note W4 p. 535 with\nthe evidence of who was probably meant. The language here clearly refers to\n\fXLI.] 521\nAppendix III.\nmy uncle's father. But there was evidently some confusion in the matter,\npossibly precipitated by.my statement that I did not remember my uncle's\nfather. Compare with this also the summary (p. 111). In any case, how\never, the incidents of the war and lost finger are not true of him, but\nof another John McClellan, who was not a relative of my uncle at\nall, and who was probably the person meant in the sitting of May\n31st (p. 431). But in regard to the statement that this John McClellan\n\" had a brother David who had a sunstroke,\" John McClellan, Dr. Harvey\nMcClellan, William McClellan, sons, and William McClellan, nephew, said\nthat he had no brother by this name. But in order to see if there was\nanything near the truth in the statement, I asked if he had any relative\nby that name, and was answered in the negative by all except John\nMcClellan, the son, who said that he had a brother-in-law by the name of\nDavid Elder. My aunt Nannie also knew of this David Elder. The fact\ngave me confidence in the clue. But none of the McClellans remembered\nwhether this David Elder had a sunstroke or not. Through one of them,\nDr. Harvey McClellan, I was directed to address an inquiry to the\ndaughter of David Elder, and it turned out that she was not living,\nthe fact being unknown to her cousin who gave me the address ! True,\nshe lived in another county, but she had died two years before, as I\nlearned from her daughter, and the fact, we should suppose, ought to have\nbeen known to her cousin. Through this daughter I obtained some further\ninformation embodied in Note 72.\nIt is pertinent to see the name of \"Nancy\" given in this connection,\nbecause this is the name of my uncle James McClellau's mother, virgin\nname Nancy Elder, sister of the David Elder just indicated. This\nI did not know, and assumed that he was intending to refer to my\naunt Nannie, his sister-in-law. There is, however, nothing but its con\nnection and the way it is written to indicate that the reference should be\ntaken as made to his mother. Earlier in life we had called aunt Nannie\nby the name of aunt Nancy, but for thirty years or more only in the form\nthat it invariably appears in these communications. My uncle most pro\nbably called my aunt by the name of Nancy, so that if we assume, as I think\nthere is no reason to do, that he was referring to my aunt Nannie we should\nhave an interesting variation from the usage in these sittings which would\nbe against the telepathic, and in favour of the spiritistic theory. We could\nescape its cogency for this view only by assigning telepathy an associative\npower and access to the connections in memory equal to its assumed acquisi\ntive capacity at the same time, a view which is not supported by the\nmistakes and confusions in this record. Apparently, however, the evidence\nis that my uncle was referring te the name of his mother, which was Nancy,\nand I understand that she was always called so As I did not know the\nname of my uncle's mother the difficulty with telepithy still remains con\nsiderable on this interpretation of his reference. \u2014J. H. H.\nNute 72.\u2014September 17th, 1899. After some months' correspondence\nand much difficulty I have been able to obtain further information of the\nsunstroke incident. The granddaughter of this David Elder wrote to her\nuncles asking them whether their father ever had a sunstroke, or had been\n\f522 [part\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\novercome with the heat, and whether it had affected him afterward, if he had\nsuch a stroke. The answer came from one of them that he thought that his\nfather had been overcome with heat about the close of the war (1865), but\nthat it did not affect him in after years. The other, the one with whom the\nfather had lived, said that his father \"never had a sunstroke, nor was he\nvery much affected by the heat of it.\" I then wrote to the first of these two\nfor particulars, and the reply was dictated to his son as follows :\u2014\nWashington, Iowa, September 4th, 1899.\nDear Sir,\u2014My father asks me to say in response to the attached (my\ninquiry) that in 1865 or '66 or '67 or '68, his father to slightly overheated,\nbut not, according to his remembrance, seriously so. There were n0 further\nparticulars that he can give.\u2014Yours respectfully,\nJas. H. Hyslop, New York City. \u00b0RV1LLE Ei.deE-\nTo the other brother who had denied the occurrence I wrote what his\nbrother had said in the affirmative, and he repeats, in reply, that he has n0\nrecollection of it, but admits that it is possible, though he insists, no doubt\ncorrectly enough, that it could not have been serious. The case thus stands\nrather in favor of the statement at the sitting, though it was evidently not\napparently so serious as the natural interpretation of the language in the\ncommunication would imply. But when we consider that even a light stroke\nof this kind carries with it prolonged consequences we need not be surprised\nthat there should he an apparent discrepancy between the description of the\n-sons and that of my uncle about the person concerned. My father had a\nlight sunstroke in or about 1867, and all his life afterward had to be careful\nabout working in the sun. \u2014J. H. H.\n[Further inquiry of persons who have been slightly overcome with heat\nand of physicians confirms the statement that, subjects of sunstroke, no\nmatter how light, never recover from the effects of it (January 20th, liKX)).\n-J. H. H.]\nNote 73.\u2014This incident about the minerals cannot be verified by either of\nthe aunts, his sisters. The word \"minerals\" is not one that would indicate\nany of the intellectual or other interest that my father ever had within my\nrecollection. He knew nothing about geology, and cared nothing about\nminerals or jewelry of any sort that I ever knew. He may at one time\nhave had some Indian relics which might ]kiss here for \" minerals,\" but I\nnever knew of his possessing anything of this kind. I merely knew that he\ndid exhibit some interest in such relics, but I know of n0 collection of them in\nhis possession. He used to tell us a great deal about Indian history in\nOhio, and especially about Indian battles. \u2014J. H. H.\n[Since writing the preceding note I recalled the fact that father did have\na small collection of Indian relics, consisting of an Indian hatchet or two, a\nmortar and pestle, another whose purpose I have forgotten, and a large\nnumber of flint arrows. He used to find these on the farm when ploughing\nor at work in the fields, and he often spoke of their camping ground as pro\nbably near a certain spring on our neighbour's place, that of the Samuel\nCooper mentioned in this record.

If\nthere was any consciousness of the mistake in regard to Dr. Dice, it might\nbe interpreted as a reference to him, but as it was my uncle that was trying\nto give this name I can hardly assume that this was meant by my father. The\nsecond possibility is that of Dr. Harvey McClellan, but as this name was\nsuspected once before, and mentioned once afterward (pp. 425, 491) or presum\nably so in the form of \" Henry McClellan,\" the communicator would hardly\nhave spoken here as he did. In fact, reading this statement in connection\nwith the attempt to complete the reference to \"a doctor who had peculiar\nreligious views \" suggested that possibly my interpretation of that passage\nas referring to Dr. Harvey McClellan might be wrong. Hence when\nreading the sittings over about two weeks after their occurrence, I\nrecalled another physician of father's acquaintance who would admirably\ntit the facts. He was a dentist, and was always called \"Doctor\" by\nfather and the family. He was of the Unitarian profession, or something\nlike this, and father had many conversations with him on the subject of\nreligion, and \"peculiar\" (better \"strange\") was the term that father would\nnaturally use to describe them. Father was quite a friend of this man, in\nspite of his heterodoxy. But he is not clearly enough indicated to\nsuppose certainly that he was meant. Hence I mention him only to modify\nthe interpretation of the former incident.\nThis persistent reference to the books sent me the year before he died is\nan interesting incident. I have denied its truth all along, and have still to\ndeny it, so far as my recollection goes. When I said to him at the sitting\nthat ] had them in my library, I meant to quiet his mind about it while I\nhad in view the books of his which I took and kept after his death. I had\nin mind, too, what was said at an earlier sitting (December 27th, p. 335). But\nthe reference to \" a box containing two or more books \" and sent me \"before I\n(he) became so ill,\" has an interest as being nearly right. I remembered his\nsending me a box some time before his illness, and containing something\nvery different from books, and hence I could only interpret this as false.\nBut I read over his correspondence with me and find that in a letter of\nDecember 22nd, 1892, he mentions sending me a box containing some things\nfor us, and mentions butter. I do not remember whether this box had any\nother contents or not. But in a letter of November 20th, 1893, he mentions\nhis and mother's purpose to send us a box of various things, but it was not\nrealised for some time, as the letter for January 8th, 1894, mentions sending\nit and apologises for the delay. The box contained two rolls of butter, two\ndressed chickens and some nuts. But I do not remember any books in it ;\nin fact, am quite confident that none such were sent me at that time. The\ndate shows, however, that it was more than a year before his death, a mistake\nthat is not so bad when we reflect that I made the same mistake until the\n\f524 [part\nJ. H. Hyshrp, Ph.D.\nreading of the letters corrected it. It is barely possible that he may have\nsent me some books to read and which were returned. Careful inquiry,\nhowever, does not assure anything definite about this possibility.\nPrevious notes show that the incidents about the reading of the paper\nand the glasses troubling his eyes are correct, except that the cause of the\ntrouble in the eyes was probably not his glasses, but the gradual breaking up\nof his system, though my father thought at the time that it was his glasses.\n\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 75.\u2014I could never feel satisfied with the absurd conception indi\ncated in my note of June 7th (p. 476), which had assumed the possibility of\ncontinued weakness after death in order to make conceivable the possible\namount of truth in the reference to the number 25, or 23, as Mrs. P. went\ninto the trance. But it occurred to me afterwards that this message might\nhave been much more fragmentary than it seems. Assuming then that my\nfather did not communicate all that he intended, and that he was trying to\nsay something about the twenty-third psalm (hymn), and about his inability\nto sing because he did not have any teeth, we should have a conception\nthat does not involve the difficulties attaching to my original interpretation.\nIt would be specially pertinent to mention this psalm for two reasons.\nFirst, my mother recited it in a clear voice on her death-bed after we\nthought she had become unconscious. Secondly, my father often tried to\nimpress the sentiment of this psalm upon our minds by reminding us of its\nplace among the last words of our mother, and by frequently singing it at\nfamily worship. This new interpretation does not involve the assumption\nof continued physical weakness and defects after death, as my previous note\nrepresents it, and hence the possible meaning of these fragments appears\nwithout the incredible conception which was stated, not because it was\nbelieved or believable, but because it served as an aid to the explanation of\nthe possible pertinence of Mrs. Piper's statements. There is nothing\nevidential in the message, as it does not clearly state what I have conjec\ntured, but the reconstruction serves to show how near to a significant truth\na lot of confusion and absurdity can be.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 7ti. \u2014Inquiry of my aunt here mentioned fails to verify the fact.\nThe doubt expressed by the communicator himself led me to inquire also of\nthe other aunt, who also does not remember the incident. If it were not for\nthe communicator's own doubt about the person who helped him out of his\ndifficulty we could very safely say that it is false, because I find by inquiry\nthat my aunt Eliza is thirteen years younger than my father, and hence was\nnot born at the time indicated in the incident. It would be imite possible\nfor my aunt Nannie to have been the witness of this little escapade, as she\nwas only eight years father's junior, but we could hardly expect her to\nremember such an incident.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 77.\u2014It might have been stated here in the previous note that my\nassumption of the possible meaning of the name \"Nannie\" for my step\nmother is decidedly confirmed by this phrase \"my own mother Nannie.\"\nFor as both were called Margaret, we can suppose that the phrase is a\n\fXLI.] 525\nAppendix III.\nfragment of what was said explaining that his own mother's name was the\nsame as \" Maggie's \" which was what he always called my stepmother. This\nwe have seen appeared as \" Nannie,\" which, be it noted, as I have elsewhere\nexplained (p. 342), is probably a mistake of Rector's, or possibly of\nthe \"machine\" for what was definitely thought by my father as Maggie\nifif. pp. 69, 365). \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 78.\u2014The incidents about the \" Cooper School \" and father's visit to\nme which I have explained in a previous note (See Notes 3f), p. 499, and 53,\np. 507) show clearly enough that the communicator was possibly right in thus\nalluding to this trip as having been mentioned before. But my ignorance\nof the \"Cooper School\" incident prevented any recognition of this cor\nrectness at the time.\nOn examination of the two sets of sittings, however, mine and Dr.\nHodgson's, I find nothing that justifies assurance about the reference to this\nWestern trip \"just before going out West.\" But the association of the fact\nwith the allusion to my stepmother, though suggestible by my question,\nobtains such pertinence as it has from the spontaneous intimation that the\ntrip had been mentioned before. The trip was taken for the purpose of look\ning up a place to which to move, but the decision was in favour of another\nplace than that of the original intention.\nThere is, however, too much confusion in the present communications,\nand too much equivocation in the allusion to a journey in connection with the\nCooper incident (p. 421) for me to suppose anything evidential in the present\nreferences. But I may explain the confusion and indicate two or three\ninteresting psychological features of the passage.\nI had been the source of the confusion in the first place by not making it\nclear that I was asking for my stepmoUier instead of my mother. There\nwould be no apparent reason to my father for my asking about a trip in such\nclose connection with the reference to the cap, since the cap was made in\n1895, and the trip with my stepmother was taken in 1884. But as my father\npresumably alluded to a trip with my own mother at the sitting of Dr.\nHodgson on February 7th (p. 371) it was natural for his mind to recur to\nthat on the present occasion, as such a trip had a direct association with\nmyself for him. My special object here, to call out incidents that I did not\nknow, was not detected, and the communicator's mind would naturally be\ndiverted by this apparently abrupt change of subject, which in fact would\nnot appear to him to be a change at all if I was referring to my mother,\nwhose identity enters into the confusion, as the communications show. It is\nstrongly corroborative of the thought unity in the case, in spite of its con\nfusion, and of my conjecture that my father had the trip with my own mother\nin mind, to see the name Surah mentioned immediately after the allusion to\nthe maker of the cap. For my aunt Sarah was with us, my mother, my\nfather, my sister Annie, and myself, on the trip in 1861, a fact wholly\nforgotten by me at the time of the sitting, and only discovered accidentally\nin a conversation with this aunt afterward. The recognition a little later\n(p. 481) that this was the trip intended confirms my supposition, though its\nforce is made dubious by my statement just previous. So also is the recog\nnition of the trip with my stepmother, though it would possess much\n\f52G [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\npertinence if I could feel assured that the pronoun \" we \" and the allusion\nto a journey in connection with the Cooper incident (p. 421) referred to my\nstepmother.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 79.\u2014When I made this answer to father's statement about the cap\nin connection with the name of aunt Nannie I interpreted it to be an answer\nto my question about it a little earlier, but on careful examination I see\nthat it is nothing of the kind, but is an attempt to clear up the confusion\nof my stepmother's name with that of my aunt, about which there was so\nmuch difficulty, as the sitting shows. The next note will show this view\nof the case still more clearly, I think.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 80.\u2014From a statement (p. 491) at the last sitting (June 8th) I\nat first thought that this \"H . . . HAR H . . \" might possibly\nhave been one of the attempts to spell out the name of Harper Crawford\nthere mentioned. But more careful examination shows that this is not the\nmost probable interpretation. It is more likely that he was trying to give\nthe name of my stepmother Margaret. Compare Notes 82 and 8)i. This is\nevidenced by the mention of his mother, whose name was Margaret (see\nabove), and his sister, with whose name he had confused that of my step\nmother. The \" No, go on,\" is probably an interruption of Rector's to have\nfather go on with his explanation of the confusion and to stop the reference\nto \"HAR.\" But it was a wonderful piece of pertinent reference to say'\nthat he thought of his mother and sister, in connection with an attempt to\nclear up the confusion of my aunt's name with that of my stepmother,\nas the statement of facts just above clearly indicates.\nIt becomes clear also that my supposition in the answer to his statement\nabout the cap and thinking it over when I mentioned aunt Nannie was a\nmisunderstanding on my part, representing confusion on my side while his\naccusation that I misunderstood him is justified by the facts, and hence the\nclearness was on his side. The reference to \"our visit to her also\" is\nwonderfully pertinent here, because, though it was in 1876 on his return\nfrom the Centennial at Philadelphia, I had earlier in the sitting referred\nto a trip out West with her, in asking for my stepmother's name, and still\nearlier had indicated that her name was confused with that of my aunt.\nThere is a distinct consciousness of this confusion here in the reference to\nthe cap and my aunt's name. It was therefore a perfectly correct piece of\nassociation for him to run over the trip that was connected with the visit to\nmy aunt. This fact alone is almost enough to prove identity, in spite of the\nconfusion, and perhaps one might almost say on account of it.\nI find also by inquiry that there is no Harriet among the relatives as my\nnote after the sitting supposes there was. Hence, all that was supposed in\nreference to that name has to be withdrawn. Besides, no Harriet was\nvisited. The whole passage becomes clear enough in the light of the\nprevious explanation, and the fact just learned from my stepmother that\nfather and she visited my aunt at the time I have mentioned, 1876. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 81.\u2014There is an extraordinary interest in the statements here about\nthe visit to the boys and the arrangement to go out West to live. I may have\nknown of these visits, but I did not recall them and had to verify them by\n\fXLI.] 527\nAppendix III.\ninquiry, and found that on his return home from this Western trip he did\nvisit brother George with mother. It appears, however, to be a statement\nmade to Rector, and not necessarily to me, as the \" visit te the boys \" must\ninclude me, if we take the plural into account, because my brother Will was\non the home farm at that time, and it would hardly be proper to say that the\nreturn thither to him was a \"visit\" to him. This is clearly recognised in\nthe statement, \" we saw George and Will,\" etc. But on this return he did\nhave a long consultation with brother Will regarding his willingness to take\nthe farm if he (father) decided to leave. But the most pertinent thing about\nthe statement is that he \" arranged to go out there to live,\" as this is exactly\nwhat he did, the time relation being precisely correct here.\nThe chief interest of this, however, is the relation of it to the theory of\ntelepathy. If it is to be accounted for on that hypothesis, it involves a\ndistinction by Mrs. Piper's subliminal between personal knowledge and\nexperience in connection with my father and what I merely knew by report\nand thoughts about the matter. I merely knew most of these things by\ncorrespondence and inference and not as personal experience, so that the\nconnection with my father is merely a thought connection. Now if telepathy\nis to account for it, why does that agency not also obtain abundance of other\nthoughts with the same kind of association ? Why does it so uniformly limit\nitself to the incidents in mine or others' memory that represent the\npersonal unity of my father's consciousness and memory at the same time ?\nThis is a tremendous capacity to assume, especially when we note its infalli\nbility in that respect and such decided fallibility in selecting the relevant\nfacts after so correctly discriminating them from the irrelevant. For there\nis not one case that I have observed in the whole seventeen sittings which\ncan represent a thought alone about my father. The associative unity\nand synthesis is wholly that of a personality on the other side, and not\nthat of telepathic acquisition from my memory, unless we suppose an\ninfallible distinction between mere thoughts associated with my father and\npersonal experiences so associated, to say nothing of the large number of\nfacts that I did not know at all.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 82.\u2014As I compare different passages in which this \" Har\" occurs it\nseeins more probable that it is a mistake for \"Margaret.\" This appears\nalmost evident, if not conclusive, in the sitting for June 8th (p. 491),\nwhere the \"Har . . . MARGARET\" occur together though it is probable\nthat another Margaret, my deceased aunt, is intended in the latter case. It\nwould suit this case to interpret it so because the allusion to the trip with\nthis person is so pertinent to her, my stepmother, especially when taken in\nconnection with my question regarding the same, and the remark immedi\nately afterward that he would try and tell me exactly what I wanted.\u2014\nJ. H. H.\nNote 83.\u2014The chief interest in this passage is the knowledge of Rector,\nas later statements would indicate, regarding the relation to me of the\nparties named. It is perfectly correct, and as realistic as could be imagined.\nIt is not in the least like the passive acquisition of telepathy, if our concep\ntion of that process is correct. The indication that there is a Nannie in the\n\f528 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nbinly to be distinguished from my mother who is dead, and the reason\nassigned for our confusion is a fine piece of independent intelligence, no\nmatter whether we suppose the allusion to be to my Aunt Nannie or to my\nstepmother with the continued use of the erroneous name.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 84.\u2014I have made diligent inquiry about this alleged experience of my\nuncle \"Clarke,\" and cannot verify it. His wife and children cannot confirm\nit. Either they were not told it or they do not recognise in the incident as\nnarrated here anything to recall what they may have been told. All of them,\nhowever, state that many years ago he had a waking vision of a chariot and\ntwo ways, the chariot being full of flaming swords and passing through a\nscene of great carnage. But as he had taken a dose of morphine it was\ntreated as the effect of this, except that my uncle often spoke of it as having had\na symbolic influence on his religious life. I see no reason for giving it such\na meaning or any meaning except the effects of the morphine. It certainly\ndoes not tit the incident as here told by my father, so that we have some\nthing to deal with that is either false or unveritiable. It would be a most\ninteresting fact if verifiable, as it would afford both a means of identification\nand an indication of something beyond telepathy. There is an interesting\ncircumstance, however, that may explain why I could not verify it. The\nstatement that he, my uncle, saw the light and spoke of it before he came\nhere, though it seems to imply that it had been mentioned before he died,\ndoes not absolutely require this interpretation, as it may mean only that ho\nhad spoken of it before he came to communicate \"here.\" He had died some\ntwo months or more before I had my sittings. The evidence for this interpre\ntation of the sentence is the fact that in the same pissage father very care\nfully distinguishes between the interval between death and the time and\nplace of communications, and the interval between the alleged conversation\nand the time of coming to the communications. This is what is meant by\nthe change to the spiritistic lingo which I noticed. If then it be true that\nthere is no reason to suppose the ex]ierience had been told to any one, we can\nhardly assume it to have necessarily been in the possession of those of whom\nI had to inquire. The statement later that I must \"remember the facts\nvery well\" does not necessarily imply that I knew the facts of the experience,\nbut may mean only that I must remember the facts which father supposed\nthat he had told before he was \" too far off\" to complete the story. Con\nsequently, the experience might have been one that occurred to him after\nthe accident by which he lost his life, and when he was in a condition that\nmight either prevent the telling of it or offer no opportunity to tell it. I\nhave no necessary reason, therefore, to suppose that the incident would be\nverifiable in any case.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 85. \u2014This is an incident about which I knew nothing, and, consider\ning that the aunt of whom it is told is twenty years older than I am, I could\nnot be expected to know it. But I asked my aunt Nannie, who is eight\nyears older than the aunt Eliza of whom it is told, and she emphatically\ndenied the truth of the incident. But this aunt Eliza herself told me\nthat she was nicknamed \"Lizzie\" when a child, and that afterward the\n\fXLI.] o29\nAppendix III.\nfamily began calling her Eliza, by which name I always knew her, and I\nnever heard any mention of what my aunt Nannie herself could not\nremember. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 86. \u2014This passage apparently indicates a connection between the\nattempts with \"Har\" and the name \"Margaret.\" But there is some\nconfessed confusion in it, and possibly no effort would suffice to unravel it,\nespecially as the name Jennie occurs out of place in this instance, unless we\nsuppose that the Margaret in this case is not meant for my mother at all,\nbut for my aunt, the second wife of my uncle James McClellan, who\ncommunicated before. In this case the Jennie could have the significance\nalready given it, as the sister of her stepson's wife. But the importance of\nthe passage is its connection of \"HAR \"with \"MARGARET.\" It shows\nwhat the probable meaning of \" HAR \" in previous messages (pp. 481, 482),\nthough it is probable that the person meant is not the same.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 87.\u2014This incident about the organ turns out to be perhaps as\nremarkable as any in the whole series of sittings. I knew nothing about the\nfact. The church to which allusion is made is the First United Presbyterian\nChurch in the town of father's old home, as indicated by my question, and\nthe Harper Crawford, whom I mentioned just to start father in the direction\nof memories in connection with this old friend, belonged to this church. I\nlearned from my aunt Nannie (about June 25th, 1899), who keeps in close\ncommunication with her sister, that an organ had been put into this church\nabout two months previously, the denomination being opposed to instru\nmental worship until recent changes in its constitution permitted the\nintroduction of it in churches desiring it. I learned also from her that\nit was the introduction of the organ into this church (Sunday-school)\nthat was the reason why my uncle \"Clarke\" and his wife left this\ncongregation and went to the second U.P. Church. I probably knew\nthat they had left it, but if I did know it I had wholly forgotten it. The\nonly chance I had to know it was at the time of my father's death when I\nwas at his old home, but I recall nothing said or done at the time to give me\nany information on the point. On further inquiry I learned that the\norgan had been introduced into the Sunday-school of this church two or\nthree years before my uncle's death, but not into the regular services until\ntwo months previous to the time of my last sittings. Now as an indication\nof my ignorance regarding the facts it is interesting to know that soon\nafter my first series of sittings I wrote to my aunt, the wife of this uncle,\nthe aunt Eliza of these records, and asked her to send me some questions\nwhich were to concern facts in the lives of my father and herself, and my\nuncle and herself, that I did not know. I had her seal the questions in an\nenvelope which I was not to open until at the sittings. I had this envelope\nwith me in my pocket, which I had kept there after opening it in Boston for\nuse at one of the sittings. I kept it there very carefully so that no one\nshould see it. One of the two questions in it was : \" Why did your uncle\nand I leave the First Church?\" I had, of course, seen the question, but I\ndid not have the slightest conception of what it was expected to elicit. But\nI did not see the suitable occasion to present the question. The information,\n2 M\n\f530 [PAKT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nhowever, which my aunt Nannie gave me about the introduction of the organ\ninto this church turned out to be the proper answer to this question which\nwas never put, and whose answer I did not know.\nThe most remarkable part of it, however, is the fact that I learned\ncasually in a conversation with my sister and stepmother when narrating the\nincidents here associated with the name of Harper Crawford. Without the\nslightest suspicion of the pertinence of the circumstance, my stepmother\nremarked that Harper Crawford, with his family, was the only person beside\nmy uncle \"Clarke\" and family who left this church on account of the\nintroduction of the organ. I learned from my aunt later that one other\nperson in the congregation had left on account of it, but this is of no\nimportance except to make the story correct, and to show the limited number\nof persons involved in the situation. I, of course, knew nothing of this\nHarper Crawford's action, as I have only spoken to him a few times, when\non visits to my old home, in the last twenty years, and have had no com\nmunications at all either with him or about him in all that time. I might\nvery well have gotten some hint of the admission of the organ into the\nChurch Sunday School at the time of my father's death, if it was in then,\nbecause I stayed for ten days at my \" uncle Clarke's\" house. But we were\nso out of sympathy on religious questions that we never talked about them\nin any shape, and so I was ignorant, at least so far as my memory serves me,\nof both the fact of the introduction of the organ and its connection with his\nand my aunt's leaving the church.\nNow the interesting feature of the incident is that the statement about\nthe organ should be started by my reference to Harper Crawford and given\nalmost instantly, and then that I should find that there was a real connection\nbeyond my knowledge between the two facts and also with my uncle who\nhad so recently died. It is probable that father did not know the fact of the\nintroduction of the organ before his death. If he did not, his knowledge of\nit would have to come from this uncle who was one of the parties affected.\nBut considering my ignorance of the main facts and any process whatsoever\nof acquiring them, the unity of consciousness involved in this incident\nappears to transcend any possibility of telepathy whatever, short of infinity\nin the capacities of Mrs. Piper's brain.\u2014J. H. H.\n[Since writing the foregoing I have just discovered one of father's letters\nmisplaced from the package already examined, and dated June 10th, 1896,\ntwo months and a-half before his death. It states the fact that this Harper\nCrawford and my uncle \" Clarke \" had left this church, but does not give the\nreason. Hence, contrary to my supposition, father probably did know all that\nis implied here and did not have to get it from my uncle after his death\nexcept the putting of the organ into the regular services of worship.\n(September 17th, 1899.)\u2014J. H. H.]\n[I made special inquiries for an official statement from the Secretary of the\nSession in the church here concerned regarding the exact time that the organ\nwas decided upon and put in. I give the questions and answers as originally\npresented. The answers I put in quotations.\n1. At what date did the Session decide by vote to introduce an organ into\nthe Sunday School ? Ant. : \" April 2nd, 1895.\"\n2. At what date was the organ put in ! (No answer to this question.)\n\fXLI.] 531\nAppendix HI.\n3.

When did Mr. James B. Carruthers and Mr. Harper Crawford ask and\nobtain their certificate of departure from the church. Ant. ; \" June 4th,\n1895.\"\nThis statement makes it apparent that the organ was put into the main\npirt of the church and its services after the death of my uncle Carruthers,\nthough the official decision for it was six months before his decease. But, as\nshown both by my father's letter mentioned above, and this official statement,\nthe organ was put into the Sunday School before this, and the two men\nhad left the church long before the decision to put it into the main part of\nthe service. Consequently, the allusion of my father to the case may not\nrefer to anything learned from my uncle since his death, but to a matter of\ncommon knowledge before either of them died. Father's letter to me makes\nthis clear, though it gives no hint of the cause for the abandonment of the\nchurch by the two men mentioned.i\nIf we are to apply telepathy to this incident it performs the extraordinary\ntrick of completing the story of my father's letter in 18%, either by selecting\nfrom my subliminal self information absolutely forgotten by me and using\nit as a means to obtain rapport with other minds, or by reaching out into the\nworld at large and obtaining the desired information in that way alone.\n(October 29th, 1899.)\u2014J. H. H.]\nNote 88.\u2014This passage beginning with the reference to my brother\nGeorge is as pertinent and extraordinary conversation as could be imagined.\nThere is not an irrelevance in it. Every statement is charged with meaning\nthat the members of the family know too well. The underscoring suggests\nfacts and pertinent emotional tone that only myself and members of the\nfamily can appreciate. It was the negligence of my brother in matters of\nbusiness letters that was the cause of a great deal of friction and unpleasant\ncorrespondence and worry both by father and myself. The underscoring\nshows the recognition of this fact. All the way through the connection and\nclearness are as perfect as an3' conversation between two living persons and\nsuperior to much that goes on over the telephone.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 89.\u2014I ascertained in the West, rather accidentally while alluding to\nthe pertinence of this reference to my brothers, a fact that gives additional\nsignificance to the mention of my brother George in this connection. My\nstepmother remarked that George was named originally among the executors\niu father's will which was drawn in 1887, and that afterwards his name was\ntaken off because of dissatisfaction with his business methods, and another\nnamed in his place. The reader can determine for himself the unity of\nconsciousness involved in the incident, as it contains personal features\nwhich cannot be any more clearly indicated. \u2014J. H. H.\ni At a sitting on February 5th, WOO, which is not included in this record, my\nfather spontaneously mentions that he had heard of the organ incident after his,\n.death.\u2014J. H. H.\n2 M 2\n\f5,32 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nNote 90. \u2014Inquiry develops the fact that both my opinions expressed in\nthe original note (p. 493) were correct, and that the incident about the fence\nrelated to the farm. My brother and stepmother say that he did not concern\nhimself about the fence around the house out West, and that he was not\nimpressed with the plan to remove it, though not objecting seriously to it.\nBut they say that he did think and talk very much about putting a wire\nfence on the old homestead farm.\nThe tax incident also turns out correct, though my stepmother could not\nrecall it. But I had a resource in this instance that I cannot always com\nmand for emergencies of this sort. I read father's letters to me from 1892\nto the time of his death in 1896. In a letter of July 9th, 1892, he states his\nsituation regarding his taxes, and speaks very pathetically about it, and any\none who ever knew how father felt about not being able to pay his taxes\nwould appreciate thoroughly from his language in this letter what his state of\nmind was and the readiness with which the incident is recalled here beyond\nthe grave. He says in it that they were due and would have to go on the\ndelinquent list in fifteen days if he could not gut the money to pay them,\nas the income from the farm had not supplied him with the necessary means\nfor it, and he so despised borrowing money for any purpose, especially for\npaying taxes. He had asked one of my brothers to pay them, because\nI had frequently supplied him with funds between November. 1891, and\nMarch. 1892, and he would not ask me for more. My brother failed\nto pay them at the time they were due, and father wrote me in this\nletter that they would have to go unpaid and be settled after he was\ngone, but asked me to advise him what to do and to write this\nbrother about the matter. My recollection is that I did write an urgent\nletter to my brother about it, but as my own letters to father have been\ndestroyed and my brother does not recall my having done so, the fact\ncannot be proved more clearly. At any rate, the next letter from father,\nof August 1st, 1892, states that this brother had promised to pay the taxes,\nand I learned from my brother personally this summer that he had once paid\nfather's taxes. Since seeing him he has examined his books and writes\nme that he finds \"that in March, 1893, I (he) paid father's tax which was\noverdue.\"\nThe expression \"actively helped\" in describing the part I played in the\nembarrassment seems thus to have been exactly what I did without paying\nthe taxes themselves. I had supposed at the sitting that it meant I had also\npaid them, but it seems that the communicator was drawing a distinction\nbetween what he found I had done after his death and what I had done in\n1892. so that we have in the incident a very pretty case of refined accuracy\nin the message which is much more like independent intelligence than\nanything we know of in telepathy.\u2014J. H. H.\nNiile 91.\u2014My cousin, wife of this Robert McClellan, confirms my state\nment about father's excitement regarding this campaign, and adds a feature\nwhich makes the statement here still more pertinent, and which I did not\nknow. I interpreted it to mean excitement with reference to the political\nsituation in general, but it seems that, while this is true, father showed\nspecial excitement in his talk, or attempt to talk in a whisper, to my cousin\n\fXLT.] Appendix III. 533\nRobert. His wife, the Lucy of these records, was present at the time, and\nsays that father became so excited and overstrained himself so to talk, that\nthey had to stop him and leave to avoid temptation for him, fearing that he\nWould have a spasm of the larynx.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote. 92.\u2014After what I have said about father's excitement in the previous\nnote the pertinence of the statement here about \"the talk with R. about the\nPresident \" is apparent without comment. It is to be remarked also that\nit is not a case of suggestion from me, as my question about the walking\nstick was not calculated in any respect to suggest any such remark from\nany one except a consciousness to which the unity of such experiences\nbelonged.\nVery considerable interest attaches to the attempt to answer my question\nregarding the ''gold bug\" on the cane, which I did not suggest, asking\nmerely what it was. The additional notes which I made to the sitting\n(February 22nd, Notes 35 and 36, p. 415) in which the spontaneous reference\nto a cane was made will explain much of the pertinence of this passage.\nBut some features of the case will have to be repeated here in order to\nindicate the significance of the communication. I stated in that note that\nI did not know, or had completely forgotten about the stick that was\nevidently in the communicator's mind, and that I had in mind, as here, the\nstick with the \"gold bug\" on it and which I had given him. Now it turns\nout that he hail another cane with a curved end which had been given him\nby his brother-in-law for the one with the initials on it given him by us\nchildren, and which the brother-in-law had lost. This curved cane father\nhad broken in two by some prying, and mended with a tin sheath\nor ring about four inches long. This is evidently the cane father had\nin mind in the message of February 22nd (p. 397) and as he had used\nit for many years (since 1876) it was natural to mention it for identi\nfication. But it was the fact that it was broken that moved my aunt\nNannie to give me the money to buy him another, asking me not to tell him\nwho gave it to him. I bought the \" gold bug \" stick and gave it to him with\nout telling him that it was a present from his sister. Now it will appear that\nwhen he says in answer to my question \" who gave you that walking stick ?\"\nthat I did so, he is correct from the point of view of the stick which I had in\nmind, but when he says that he told Dr. Hodgson about it he is technically\nwrong, though right as to the general circumstance. If we could assume\nthat in the confusion evident on February 22nd the \"gold bug\" cane was\nactually alluded to as well as the broken cane, but not definitely enough to\nbe recognised, the reference here would be intelligible. The allusion to the\n\"ring on it\" would appear to prove that he had in mind the broken cane,\nof which I was not thinking, as it was the old broken stick that had this\n\"ring\" on it. But \"ring\" would possibly describe the \"gold bug\"\nas accurately as the tin sheath on the older cane. The frequent\nhesitation and dissent in the communication, however, suggests either\nthat Rector's memory was playing a part in it until corrected, or that\nfather was thinking about the case, and after the writing of the \"ring\"\nclearly, he suddenly recalls the right cane and suggests the \"gold bug\"\nwhich is drawn, though it is possible that this was what he had in mind from\n\f.534 [part\nJ. H. Hynlop, Ph.D.\nthe moment that I asked my question, and that it was hard to avoid confu\nsion with the more familiar cane and incidents of the earlier sitting.\nBut even the technical mistake almut the giver of the cane that he had in\nmind has the great importance of showing the unity of consciousness and\npersonal identity between this and the sitting of February 22nd, and brings\nout reason for natural confusion in the necessary distinctions to be made\nbet ween three walking sticks under the difficulties of communication which\nare so marked in these experiments. \u2014J. H. H.\nNote 93. \u2014I find that the chest which I had in mind here was one of my\ngrandfather's brought from Scotland and not bought at an auction by father.\nThe attic ti\", that I had in mind was over the kitchen in his house out West.\nBut my stepmother does not remember any \"chest\" kept there, but only\nsome empty boxes which, so far as she can remember, were gotten at a store\nand not at an auction. Moreover the chest I had in mind was left behind\nin Ohio when he moved West. The incident then remains meaningless as it\nstands. \u2014 J. H. H.\nJuly 6th, 1900.- Whilst revising the proofs and examining the record\ncarefully, a suspicion came across my mind that my father might have had\nin mind a small c\/\u00ab.W under an attic-like stairway leading up stairs, and in\nwhich I knew he kept his clothes. I at once wrote to my stepmother and\nbrother to know if father's cane was kept in this closet both before and\nafter his death, and also if there was a chest kept there that had been bought\nat an auction. The replies were that he kept all his clothes in this closet,\nthat the cane which he did not use was kept there before his death, and that\nthe broken cane w hich he had so long used and to which reference is here\nmade was put into this closet after his death anil kept there until the\nhouse was sold ; also that there was no chest kept there. The allusion\nto \"attic,\" to his clothing being kept in the \" chest,\" to the putting of\nhis cane there by my stepmother, are suggestive in spite of the confusion.\n\u2014J.H.H.\nJuly 11th, VMO. \u2014I have just received a letter from one of my aunts in\nresponse to an inquiry about another matter altogether, and in which she\nincidentally and without any knowledge of its pertinence mentions one fact\nthat I knew and another that 1 did not know regarding the chest mentioned\nin my first note. Speaking of his military outfit she says : \" All I know of\nyour father's sword was when it was carefully laid away in father's Scotch\n' chist ' in the old attic. When I was a little girl 1 would cautiously peek in\nto see it and your father's military hat. I thought they were the grandest\nthings that could possibly be made.\"\nI myself remember that father kept his military suit in that chest, but\ndo not remember seeing the sword in it, or that the chest wits kept in the\nattic. I remember the chest in the new house built in 1861. when the part\nof the house in which the old attic existed was taken down.\nHave we here then a confusion of two separate facts connected with\nfather's clothes ? Have we an attempt to mention the chest in which his\nmilitary suit was kept, and an association in a confused state with the closet\nin which later his clothes and cane were kept ?\u2014T. H. H.\n\fXLI.] 535\nAppendix III.\nNote 94.\u2014The difficulties attending the final attainment of my informa\ntion on the passage from John McClellan, and the reference to his lost finger\nand connection with the war, should be a matter of record here. The clue to\nmy identification of him with the father of my uncle James McClellan was\nfound in the latter's communications on June 6th (p. 470) in which he\napparently meant that it was his father that had been in the war. I asked\nthe three sons then living whether their father had been in any war, and\nreceived from all three a negative reply. But finding in the history of the\ncounty in which he had lived that a \" John McClelland \" had been com\nmissioned as ensign in the war of 1812 on July 15th, of 1810, I told each of\nthem about the fact, and they admitted that it must have been their father,\nas they did not know any other John McClellan in that county. The next\ndifficulty which I had to meet was the spelling of the name with the \"d,\"\nwhich I had never known to be a fact. Inquiry, however, showed that the\nfamily originally spelled it either way, and as the history mentioned had\nspelled that of Captain Robert McClellan, about whom and about whose con\nnection with that war there was neither doubt nor difference of opinion, in\nboth ways, I felt that nothing stood in the way of supposing that the John\nMcClellan meant was the father of the McClellans connected with me,\nthough it led necessarily bt. the rejection of several incidents as either\nunverifiable or false. But in order to obtain official and documentary\nevidence of a better sort I applied in Washington, B.C., for information\nregarding the enlistment of John McClellan in the war of 1812. The only\nhopeful resource was the Pension Office which, however, keeps only the\nrecord of those who received pensions, and not of the enlistments. I did not\nfind there any John McClellan or McClelland who would fit my case, though\nI found a number of pensioners by that name. In the meantime I found by\ninquiry among the McClellan family which I knew, indisputable evidence\nthat the John McClellan mentioned in the history of Greene County, Ohio,\nwas not the father of my uncle James McClellan. I found that James\nMcClellan's father, John McClellan, had left Westmoreland County, Pa., in\n1813, three years after the date of the commission of the John McClellan\nmentioned in the history of Greene County, Ohio, and settled that year in\nWayne County, Ohio. Here he remained until 1831, when he moved to\nGreene County, of the same state. I also found that the John McClelland\nmentioned in the history of said county had resigned his commission on\nAugust 15th, 1815. The cuse was thus clearly against the identification of\nthis John McClelland with John McClellan, the father of James McClellan,\nand in favour of the memory of his sons that their father had not been in the\nwar of 1812.\nBut the course of my inquiries brought me upon the suspicion that this\nJohn McClelland mentioned in the history of the county was the real person\nfor whom I was seeking, and I employed a lawyer friend living in the county\nto thoroughly investigate the case for me. Among the first pieces of\nimportant information was the following from a relative of this John\nMcClellan (omitting the \"d\" in further mention of him). Mr. Kyle, my\nlawyer, says : \"A man by the name of Howard Sparrow, who married a\ndaughter of Mrs. Beamer, who was the daughter of John McClellan, of\nClifton, came to my office to-day and said that he had heard his mother-in-law.\n\f.53(5 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nMrs. Beamer, speak many times of the fact that her father, John\nMcClellan, had lost a tinger, and his best recollection is that it was the front\nfinger on the left hand. This was lost by him while he was in the army.\"\nFrom a nephew of this John McClellan, living in another county of the\nstate, I learn that this uncle by name was in the war of 1812, and that prior\nto his death he was generally known as \"uncle John McClellan\" in the\ncommunity. There are several corroborations of this fact from other sources.\nThis nephew thinks that his uncle was an officer in this war, but does not\nknow whether his uncle lost a tinger in it or not.\nA later communication from Mr. Kyle says : \" I made a trip to Clifton\nwhere John McClellan was buried. I found Henry Jamison, whose mother\nwas a daughter of John McClellan, of Clifton. The old family Bible shows\nthat he died December 18th, 1850, and they also knew that he was sick about\nsix years before his death. Harry Jamison's father died seven years ago,\naged eighty-one years, and he, George Jamison, was a cousin of the Hatha-\nways. Henry Jamison was of the opinion that the Hathaways lived over\ntoward Dayton where the Jamisons lived, and of course the inference would\nbe that if the Jamisons lived in the same neighbourhood and were cousins,\nand the daughter of John McClellan married a Jamison, who was a cousin of\nthe Hathaways, that the families probably associated together.\"\n\" Henry Jamison also said he remembered of the name of Williams being\nmentioned, but could not give any account as to how or to what extent they\nwere connected with the Mcl'lellans.\"\nLater information from the same source is : \"The Williams are a hard\nfamily to trace, for the reason that there are so many branches of this\nfamily, and they probably associated with John McClellan along in 1825 or\nsoon after. The Hathaways are a family of early date, but seem to have\ndisappeared in the early part of the century.\"\nNote 95.\u2014While reading the page proofs it occurred to me that my\nuncle was here alluding to my cousin Nannie, and not his sister-in-law.\nI was prompted to this by the possible mistake a little later in the name\n\"cousin Annie.\" The statement \"Annie (my sister) and she are cousins,\"\nsuggests the inference also, as it is true on that supposition. The mention\nof \"cousin Annie \" follows immediately the mention of my sister Annie, and\nRector (or the \" machine ') may have confused my uncle's \" cousin Nannie \"\nwith the name \" Annie \" just mentioned. The obverse error seems to have\noccurred in the communications of my cousin Robert McClellan (p. 231-235)\nwhere the proximity of the attempt apparently to say \"cousin Annie\" (my\nsister) to his mention of \" aunt Nannie \" converted the former into \"cousin\nNannie.\" Both are cases of Opisthomimesis (Cf. Footnote, p. 239). The\ninterpretation in each case is confirmed by two considerations : (1) The\nphonetic character of many mistakes. (2) The point tie. re1iire of the relation\nship in the two wises. My cousin stated all the relationships in his communi\ncation with reference to himself. My uncle stated them all with reference\nto myself. The \"cousin Annie\" of my uncle's message is the same person\nas the \"cousin Nannie\" of my cousin's communication, namely, the sister of\nRobert McClellan. She was very intimate with my uncle and his family,\nhaving boarded her two daughters there while they were in the high school\n(August 6th, 1901).\u2014 J. H. H.\n\fXLl.] 537\nAppendix IV.\nAPPENDIX IV.\nExperiments on the Identification of Personai.ity.\nIntroduction.\nThe following experiments were undertaken for the general purpose\nof illustrating certain features of the phenomena that have proved\nof so much interest in the case of Mrs. Piper. They incidentally\nillustrate also, if they do not prove, the fact that identification of\npersonality may even be possible under less rigid conditions than we\nhave been insisting upon in our reports. But of this in the proper\nplace. The first duty is to describe the modus operandi of the\nexperiments, and then summarise the specific objects in mind when\nundertaking them.\nNow the Piper phenomena represent a type of experiment in which\nwe can determine the conditions only at one end of the line. We know\nneither whether there is any other personality at the other end than\nthat of the brain through which we obtain our facts; nor what the\nsources of misunderstanding may be, if such personalities other than\nthat of this brain actually exist. Much less do we know with any\ndefiniteness the conditions that may aid or hamper real or apparent\ncommunications between two worlds, or two different sets of brain\nconditions. We have only a set of messages presented to us, purport\ning to come from discarnate spirits, and without the accompanying\ncriteria which enable us in our everyday experience to test the source\nof the communications from one person to another. If, for instance,\nwe hear a voice in actual life, what it says may confirm our conjecture\nas to the speaker, and we can also try for some other and different\ntest of the source of the voice. But in the Piper case we have nothing\nbut the bare content of the message, filtered and probably distorted\nthrough the medium's subliminal consciousness, and hence there are\nserious difficulties in forming our judgment of the case. But if we\ncan institute a system of experiments in which both the communicator\nand the sitter are limited to conversing with each other through\nmessages resembling those in the Piper case, we may come to some\n\f538 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nbetter understanding of what we must allow for in communications\nobtained with genuine mediums.\nWith a view, therefore, to illustrate various aspects of the Piper\nphenomena by experiments in which I could study the conditions at\nboth ends, I arranged a telegraph line between two of the buildings of\nColumbia University which were about four or five hundred feet apart.\nThe termini were so arranged that parties could be brought to them\nwithout seeing each other. I had two telegraph operators employed\nfor carrying on the experiments. The plan was to select two persons\nwho were well acquainted with each other, and who had enjoyed more\nor less of a common life together, so that incidents common to both\ntheir lives could easily be found for the experiment. But only one of\nthe two persons was to know who was at the other end of the line, and\nit was his duty to select incidents common to the two lives, while I\nwas to send telegraph messages about them to the other person. This\nlatter had to identify the sender, to whom he had not the slightest\nclue except such as could be ascertained from the messages.\nI usually accompanied the person sending the messages, so as to aid\nin their formation and proper order. At the other end I had an\nassistant who was to explain to the receiver what he was to do, and\nalso to send any replies that were necessary as guesses or identi\nfications. The assistant was also to make a note of any remarks\nof the receiver that had a bearing on his guess or decision, and to\nascertain by inquiry the reasons for the receiver's judgment in any\ninstance. Occasionally I took this place, and the assistant directed\nthe sending of messages.\nI usually allowed the person who was to act as sender to select\nthe one to whom he wished to send messages, but with a strict\nunderstanding that no mention was to be made of the experiment.\nThis enabled me or my assistant to arrange with the would-be\nreceiver to take part in the experiment without his knowing\nthe sender at all, and without his knowing the purpose of the experi\nment until brought to the end of the Jelegraph line. Here he was\nmerely told that his duty was to ascertain who it was that was\nsending him telegrams, and to say when he was convinced beyond\ndoubt of the identity of this person. His inferences and judgments\nwere telegraphed back to the sender, in order to regulate the latter's\nreturn messages. This was important, because it was a part of the\nplan followed in the selection of incidents, to start with as vague\ngeneral messages as possible and to feel one's way to identification, in\norder to see how early a suspicion of the right person would arise and\nhow indefinite were the incidents necessary to this end.\nAlso\u2014in order to make the mental situation as much like the Piper\ncase as the circumstances would allow\u2014I had incidents or statements\n\fXLI.] 539\nAppendix IV.\nselected that were either not true, or irrelevant, nonsensical, and mis\nleading, so that the receiver had to make his decision in spite of\ncontradictions and incidents that were not really what they may have\nappeared to be, and which often had the effect of turning his mind\noff some particular scent : since it was important, for the sake of\nstudying the receiver's mind, to keep him reflecting on more than one\npossible sender. It was found necessary to get the cumulative effect of\ntrue and identifiable incidents, to outweigh those that were calculated\nto produce caution and scepticism.\nThere are no doubt some disadvantages in this deliberate production\nof incidents intended to confuse the receiver ; since the messages\ncould have been sufficiently vague and indefinite to get an accumu\nlative effect without misleading him, while this policy might suggest a\nsuspicion that no part of the experiment was bond fide at all. But\nthis is not a serious disadvantage, as in the Piper case there must be\nuncertainty in this very respect, and it is precisely these uncertainties\nthat force the sitter to wonder whether the incident is what it\npurports to be, and whether it has the source that it claims to have.\nConsequently, in order to imitate that experiment, I considered it\nbest to create as nearly as possible the same mental situation for the\nreceiver of the messages as the sitter must have in the Piper experi\nments. The construction and arrangement of the telegrams were\nmade with that situation in view. There was only one thing that I\ncould not do, namely, state immediately some striking common incident\nwhich might lead at once to identification, as this would have prevented\nany study of the effect of vague statements upon the judgment of l he\nreceiver.\nThe results of the experiments are arranged in three groups, which\nI have called respectively Groups A, B, and C. Group A represents\nexperiments in which the main or only purpose was to identify a\nsingle person, and not much attention was paid to the question\nwhether the irrelevant and false incidents led to any correct identifica\ntion or not.\nGroup B, of which there were two experiments, consists of attempts\nto personate two or more persons in such a way that the main part of\nthe experiment should point to one person, while others might also be\nidentified and distinguished from the main person by incidents that\ncould not possibly belong to the evidence for that person. Thus, the\nreceiver was to decide spontaneously whom certain incidents repre\nsented, and to decide in the same way, without interrogation, the\nincompatibility of the other facts with the same personality. The\nresults show how far this was accomplished. It was difficult, of\ncourse, to keep this group and the first wholly distinct in character.\nBut in one particular they are distinguishable, namely, that they aie\n\f540 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ndesigned to represent incidental identification of other persons, while\nchiefly occupied with the identification of one particular person by\ncumulative incidents.\nGroup C represents experiments in imitation of the Piper pheno\nmena in respect of incoherences, nonsense, and various imperfections\nof spelling and expression. The problem of identification is the same in\nthis group as in the second, except that in it the more important element\nis the number of persons to be recognised incidentally, in addition to\nthe main personality concerned. But the main characteristic is the\nmore perfect imitation of the Piper phenomena. One difference, too,\nis the fact that this group was carried on without the telegraph lines.\nThe questions were prepared beforehand, and presented to the re\nceiver to be read and examined without going through the more\nexciting formality of telegraphing. The same fact is true of the\nsecond experiment in Group B.\nI may now summarise the several objects of the whole series of\nexperiments. I was extremely careful not to breathe the first\nof these objects to any one, not even to my assistants, so that\nthe results might be entirely spontaneous and without the influence\nof suggestion from me.\nI. To test the extent to which intelligent persons would spon\ntaneously select trivial and unimportant incidents for the purpose of\nidentification \u2014that is, incidents that were not connected, or not\nnecessarily connected, with the main habits of their lives.\nII. To test the accuracy of the identification in connection with\nboth individual and collective incidents, and especially to test how\nslight or how definite the incident had to be in order to suggest\nrightly the person it was intended to represent.\nIII. To test the success and personal assurance of the receiver of\nthe messages in guessing who is the true sender, in spite of some mes\nsages that are misleading or even false, but the bulk of which involves\nsufficient cumulative facts to overcome the natural scepticism and con\nfusion caused by incoherences and contradictions.\nIV. To study the sources of misunderstanding that might arise\nunder such circumstances when one party was ignorant of the inten\ntions of the other, and the causes of mistakes in identification which we\ncan determine in my experiments, and which are likely to occur in\nthe Piper case.\nIn regard to the first of these objects, it is very interesting to\nobserve the uniformity with which perfectly intelligent persons\nspontaneously chose what would generally be considered trivial\nincidents in order to be identified. This seemed to naturally\n\fXLI.] 541\nAppendix IV.\nrecommend itself to them,\u2014perhaps for the reason that trivial circum\nstances represent far more isolation than any chosen from the main\ntrend of life, though I noticed no consciousness of this fact in any\none. It was simply the instinctive method which every one tended\nto adopt. The records show very distinctly that, if left to them\nselves, men will naturally select unimportant incidents for proof of\ntheir identity, and it is one of the most interesting features of this\nchoice that the individual relied wholly upon the laws of association\nto recall what was wanted after deciding on the nature of the\nincidents to be chosen.\nVery often there were interesting illustrations of those capricious\nrevivals in memory of remote incidents which not only resemble so\nmuch the incidents in the Piper sittings in triviality, but also represent\nthe caprices and incoherences of associative recall, intelligible to the\nsubject on reflection, but hardly so to the outside observer. At any\nrate, the results in this regard completely remove all objections to the\nPiper phenomena from the standpoint of the triviality of the incidents\nchosen for identification, and that is an accomplishment of some worth.\nOn reflection, most persons will at once admit the superior value of\nsuch incidents for scientific purposes ; but too often, under the a priori\nassumption\u2014encouraged or created by a false idealism about a trans\ncendental state of existence\u2014that discarnate spirits ought to show an\ninterest in more lofty matters, we suppose that the fact of triviality\nindicates a greater probability for a mediumistic origin than for a\nspiritistic one. In reality, if the incidents represented were what we\nmight naturally regard as important, they would be of the sort that\nwould either be unverifiable at all, or so common to the lives of people in\ngeneral that they would be exposed to the fatal objection of guessing\nand inference. But if the messages describe uncommon and isolated\nincidents, this explanation must be rejected and the evidential\ncharacter of the facts recognised, whatever we may think about the\nconditions of existence to which they may be supposed to testify.\nBut after all the spiritistic problem is not at stake here and\nperhaps allusion to it is irrelevant, as the real question in these experi\nments concerns only the place of trivial incidents in the evidence.\nThese incidents, being such as are not likely to occur often,\nmaterially assist identification, while it is obvious that we can infer\nnothing from them as to the general conditions of life of intelligent\npersons. This fact was evident in the experiments here recorded, as\nthe persons chosen for the experiments were of the class whose\nintellectual occupations and habits of mind could not be depreciated,\nand yet the incidents chosen for the suggestion of personal identification\nwere much the same as those with which we have to deal in the Piper\ncase. This first object of the experiments, therefore, has been fully\n\f542 J. H. Hyslop, Ph.D. [part\nsatisfied, and the evidential value of these phenomena vindicated,\nwhatever the theory we adopt for explanation of them.\nThe problem presented in the other three objects will have to\nbe studied in the details of the records, and in incidents that I,\nas the experimenter, could observe more readily than a mere reader\nof the record would observe without suggestion.\nBut I must first call attention to an important and characteristic\ndifference between these experiments and the Piper case. In the latter\nthere is presumably the utmost effort on the part of the communicator\nto he identified, and \u00ab'e cannot suppose that there is conscious attempt\nto divert, confuse, or deceive the sitter as to the personal identity of the\nalleged communicator. But the purposes of my experiments required\nsome attempt to hold the receiver of messages back from too hasty iden\ntification, and in some cases the use of material for at least possible\ndeception. The object was not merely to see how easily the coin\nmunicator could prove his identity\u2014for this could have been done\nunder the circumstances with the greatest ease\u2014but it was to imitate\nas far as possible the conditions of the Piper record, which exhibit the\nnecessity of a cumulative character in the evidence and a correspond\ning suspense of judgment, with as much freedom from suggestion and\nillusion of interpretation as possible, in order to justify any rational\nconclusion whatever. Hence, to effect this result, and to study the\nnature of the incidents upon which correct identification could b.i\nbased\u2014that is, the degree of evidence, general or specific, on which\n\u25a0a true judgment could rest,\u2014I had to adopt a policy of actually\nholding the receiver back from immediate identification. The in\ncidents chosen at the outset had to be as vague and indefinite as\npossible, and the communicator had to feel his way along gradually\nby giving general, or presumably general, incidents with hs little\nsuggestive power as possible. This plan enables us to determine the\ndegree of evidence that is at times sufficient for identification, and\nit is often remarkable how vague the circumstance may be that\nleads to correct identification, as may be remarked in the special\nstudy of the results.\nThe necessity of following the reverse method of communicating\nthe incidents to what is naturally supposed to be the procedure in\nthe Piper phenomena is due to the reverse conditions in the two cases.\nIn my experiments identification could be easily effected, while in the\nPiper case the identification is either difficult, or that form of it is\ndifficult which requires the spiritistic interpretation for its ex\nplanation. Consequently I had to cultivate indefiniteness of incidents\nat the outset with increasingly specific character as the experiment\nproceeded. One advantage, however, I must claim for the experi\nments is that they illustrate and prove,\u2014as the Piper case illustrates\n\fAppendix IV. 543\nbut does not prove,\u2014the remarkable way in which even the most\ngeneral incidents may lead to correct identification, thus strengthening\nthe force of those which are specific. There are also good oppor\ntunities here for the study of illusions in interpretation, and I shall\ncall attention to this in the proper cases. The object of the diversions\nand false incidents, often suggesting other persons than the one\nto be identified, after what has been said about the use of general\nincidents and the necessity of suspending judgment, will be apparent\nwithout any elaborate explanation. They were important aids in\nthe more complete imitation of the Piper case.\nBefore describing the results in detail, 1 must make one more\nremark. I do not pretend that these experiments have any im\nportance except as illustrations. They are by no means numerous\nenough to prove much that is important. They are mere suggestions\nof what can be done in this direction, and studies of the\nresources of chance and illusion in concrete instances. But they\ncannot be considered as more than tentative efforts to exemplify\nand study, in the concrete, the phenomena that are connected\nwith the problem of identification under such exceptional circum\nstances as the Piper record exhibits. Others more generally occupied\nwith experimental psychology than I am may take up the question\nand reduce it to more perfect form and results. I have been obliged\nto content myself with the suggestion of it, and with the illustration\nand at least tentative vindication of the principles upon which the\nevidential force of the Piper reports is based.\nAnai.ysis of the Experiments.\nWhen it comes to a detailed examination of the experiments\nseveral problems present themselves. They relate to the complex\naspects of the Piper phenomena, which are not always so clear as to be\nfree from a certain kind of criticism and objection, at least of the\na priori sort, even when we feel ourselves able to overcome it. I have\ndealt with the objection based on the triviality of the incidents, and\nhave shown that this would apply equally to the cases represented\nin the experiments here recorded. But there is also one that depends\non two false assumptions, which may as well be exposed at once. It\nis that discarnate spirits, if they are supposed to exist, seem to show\narrested development in the kind of talk in which they engage. I\nhave only to say in reply to this that the present experiments would\nseem to show the same condition, if we relied upon the incidents\nchosen to form our concep'tion of the habits of mind of the communi\ncators. Few, if any, persons could even guess the character or habits\nof the communicators in my experiments, and I doubt if it would\n\f544 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\noften be possible in any tests for personal identity. But, supposing\nthat it is possible, it is not a necessary accompaniment of the effort\nto prove one's identity. The incidents most conclusive for all such\nefforts must be those trivial facts which can hardly be duplicated\nin two lives. This aside, however, the attempt to discredit discarnate\nspirits and their habits of mind by reflection on their choice of in\ncidents to prove their identity meets its refutation in the necessity\nof coming to the same conclusion about the communicators in my\nexperiments, whom I specially chose as being sane and intelligent men,\nwith occupations supposed to be above trivialities.\nI shall have an opportunity to discuss this problem in another con\nnection, and only mention it here as preliminary to another question\nclosely allied to it. I mean the mistakes of memory which must un\ndoubtedly be attributed to the communicators in the Piper case. It\nmay not appear a sufficient answer to this to say that the same mistake\nis noticed in the sitters, though this is an interesting fact. But I call\nattention to the mistakes of memory for the purpose of emphasising\nthe circumstance that they appear in the present experiments, pre\ncisely as they appear in the Piper phenomena. The assumptions that\nare made to discredit the spiritistic character of the Piper case are\u2014(1 )\nthat discarnate spirits ought not to make any mistakes ; and (2) that\nour own memories are less liable to illusion than those of discarnate\nspirits. Both of these assumptions are baseless. The doctrine of\nevolution ought to make us humble enough to avoid the first assump\ntion, to say nothing of the fact that the wonder should rather be that\nwe should have any memory of this life at all, supposing that we\nsurvived. I shall next summarise the several points to come under\nreview, which imitate what we have to deal with in the Piper case.\nThey are:\u2014(1) Errors of memory and their effect on the results.\n(2) Errors of interpretation. (3) Success and failure in idffitifiea-\ntion. Each of these questions will have its subordinate aspect.\n1.\u2014Errors of Memory.\nThe illusions of memory to which attention is here called are on the\nside of the receiver of messages, anu illustrate the difficulty of identifi\ncation at times when we should have expected it to be easy. Perhaps it\nwould be better to call some of them failures of memory, but in any\ncase they are that type of error in recollection which would adequately\nexplain misunderstanding in a communicator. They often show how\nunreliable anyone's statement is when not accompanied by a record\nof the facts written at the time. The first of this kind is that of the\nreceiver in the first experiment in Group A, when reporting to me her\nreason for her guess. Had not my question been recorded it would\n\fXLl] 545\nAppendix IV.\nhave been suspected of greater definiteness than it possessed. The\nerror on the part of the receiver, however, shows the fusion of mental\nimagery from her own memory with that conveyed by my question,\nand would spoil any narrative of the affair which had to depend on\nmemory alone (p. 554).\nBut more important errors of memory are such as show complete\nfailure to identify the communicator when he was confident that his\nincident would succeed in his purpose. They are illustrated in the\nfollowing cases :\u2014Group A, Exp. II., Ques. 3 (p. 555) ; Receiver's\nremark after Question 6 (p. 556) ; Exp. VI., most of the questions\n(p. 559) ; Exp. IX., note to Ques. 4 (p. 569) ; Exp. XVI., Ques. 3, 5,\n6, and 7 (p. 589). Group B, Exp. II., Ques. 21 and Ques. 30 (pp. 603,\n605). Group C, Exp. I., Ques. 11 and 15 (pp. 612, 613). Also\nGroup A, Exp. XL, Ques. 15, 16, and 17 (p. 578) ; Exp. XL, Ques.\n21, note (p. 579); Exp. XVII., Ques. 17 (p. 593).\nThere are many others of like import, though not so striking. But\nthese suffice to show many instances in which identification ought\nto take place, but fails. Of course some of the incidents were made\nvague for the very purpose of testing whether identification would\noccur on slight grounds, and the failure should not be surprising.\nBut in some cases the very incident which the communicator thought\nwould without fail identify himself had no suggestive power whatever.\nThis was very noticeable in Group A, Exp. XL, Ques. 21 (p. 579);\nand Exp. XV., Ques. 19 (p. 588). Such facts, involving what is\nverifiable on the part of the communicator, show what is possible in\ncases of alleged spirits\u2014assuming their reality\u2014and show that the\nfailure to identify may be wholly due to the sitter. This is specially\nto be remarked in Exp. VI. of Group A (p. 559), where the com\nmunicator finally came to the conclusion that, if he had been a\ndiscarnate spirit, it would have been impossible to identify himself\nto the receiver, owing to the receiver's inability to remember specific\nincidents in their common lives. The value of this case for this\nillustration, moreover, lies in the circumstance that, like most cases of\nspirit communication, a considerable interval of time elapsed between\nthe period of common life and the communications, and the com\nmunicator himself could not recall any incidents other than those\nchosen to prove his existence or identity. Exp. X. in Group A (p. 572)\nis a precisely similar case. It ought to be apparent what a large\nshare forgetfulness on the part of the sitter has in the difficulties\nof identification, when attempting to obtain communications from a\ntranscendental state of existence, to say nothing of the forgetfulness\nof an alleged spirit. The same fact is illustrated in my own sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper, in which my complete forgetfulness of certain\nincidents led to confusion on my part and failure to identify the\n2 N\n\f54G [PAKT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ncommunicator, or even the accusation of falsehood. Some examples\nof this have been given in my report of these sittings (p. 131).\n2.\u2014Errors of Interpretation.\nThese are of two kinds in the experiments. The first are those in\nwhich the receiver recalled an occasion and the communicator had in\nmind a totally different fact. The second class represents incidents\nof an apparent significance which turns out to be wholly due to\nchance, since they represent very different facts in the mind of the\ncommunicator.\nAs illustrations of the first type the following instances may be\nobserved. Group A, Exp. VI., Ques. 5 and 8 (p. 560) ; Exp. XIV.,\nQues. 3 and 6 (p. 583) ; Exp. XVII, Ques. 10, 17 and 21 (p. 592) ;\nGroup B, Exp. I., Ques. 2 (p. 596); Exp. II., Ques. 10, 11 and 12\n(p. 600). No special importance attaches to these cases of error except\nthat they should put us on our guard respecting the temptation\nto assurance in identification. There are many incidents common\nto various persons in life and we may easily forget the fact and\nassume specific peculiarities that do not exist. This, of course, is a\ntruism, and scarcely needs mention here except as indication of the\nprecautions which I have had in mind in forming my opinion on the\nmore serious case of Mrs. Piper. It should be remarked, however,\nthat the incidents that here occasion misinterpretation are often of\nthat general kind which the communicator would recognise as indefinite\nand liable to the illusion, so that as objections to the Piper case\nthey hardly hold. One important object in these experiments\nmust not be forgotten, and this is that a deliberate effort had to\nbe made to conceal identity for the sake of testing the accuracy of\nidentification by indefinite incidents, and hence it would inevitably\noccur that the communicator would state general incidents leading to\nwrong apperceptions. The incidents which constitute the strength of\nthe Piper case, as well as the identification in the present experiments,\nare far more specific than those that give rise to the misinterpreta\ntions here considered. Besides, there are more numerous cases in\nthese very experiments in which general incidents were correctly\nrecalled by the receiver, and in which the identification was correct\nand quite assured through them, especially when they were cumulative.\nThe correct judgments quite offset the errors. Nevertheless the errors\nare reasons for caution.\nBut the most dangerous source of illusion is that type of coincidence\nwhich turns out on inquiry from the communicator to have been due\nto mere chance. The best illustration of this is the cumulative\nargument, as it appeared to my judgment as receiver, in Group B,\n\fXLI.] 547\nAppendix IV.\nExp. II., Ques. 10, 11 aud 12 p. (600V Here I thought I had a\nconclusive case of inductive inference as to the person I named as the\nsender of the messages, but it turned out that, in spite of this cumula\ntive character of the evidence from my point of view, the communicator\nhad no such incidents in mind as I had imagined. It is true that the\nmessages were extremely vague and had not suggestive power taken\nalone, except Ques. 11, but they are most important examples of the\ndanger of inductive inferences on indefinite hints. I had, however, no\nassurance to satisfy me until Question 27 was sent, which confirmed\nstrongly the impression given by 26. But it will be apparent that my\nassurance was very pardonable here when we recall that Mr. Marvin, who\nhad been mentioned in my reply, just happened to come in as my reply\narrived, and seeing the possible meaning of the initials G. P., clinched\nthe case by sending the initials of Phinuit, Rector and Imperator. Cf.\nG. P. interruptions (pp. 211-213) and Miss X's incident (p. 202). My\ninference at that point became correct, though up to that point it was\nan illusion, and the coincidence, in spite of collective incidents favour\ning it, was due to mere chance. The fact, therefore, has its important\nlesson of caution, and justifies the demands that both specific incidents\nand a cumulative mass of facts in spiritistic communications should be\nsufficient to overcome the possibilities of chance as an explanation.\nThe next incident of a similar character, though not cumulative,\nis in Group A, Exp. III., Ques. 6 (p. 557). Somewhat similar cases\nare Group A, Exp. VI., Ques. 5 (p. 560), and Group B, Exp. II.,\nQues. 3 (p. 599). They show a temptation to identify through very specific\nincidents which are not in the mind of the communicator, or which\nmerely chance to be common to both persons or exceptional. Of course,\nin the case of these experiments the nature of them made it necessary\nto make some attempts to identify that were not bondfide, in order to\neffect a better imitation of the Piper case, in which confusion often occurs.\nThe objection would not apply in cases where there must be assumed a\nbond fide attempt to identify. Only a misapperception would be\npossible in this case, or failure to remember. Moreover the objection\nis more than offset by the large number of correct recalls of persons to\nwhom the incidents would apply as well as to the communicator. In\nfact this is so frequent as to favour our confidence in memory in spite\nof occasional or even frequent mistakes. Still we cannot be too cautious\nin a matter where chance is possible to any extent. Of course, the\nPiper case represents too much cumulative evidence to be amenable\nto this objection. For instance, what passes for an incident in it often\ninvolves several coincident facts that can hardly be put together by\nchance. Thus two distinct names, with their specific relation and\nsome characteristic fact in connection with them, will be mentioned,\njust as they would be in actual life in any narrative involving the\n2 n 2\n\f548 [PAKT\n,\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nnatural unity of consciousness. But in the present experiments the\nincidents are rather isolated, so that they get a cumulative character\nonly by the comparison of one with another. Consequently, the result\nin these experiments, if favourable to identification, must give afortiori\nforce to the evidence in the Piper instance. But without urging this\ncomparison at present, there is the admissible danger of not allowing\nsufficiently for chance in isolated cases of interpretation leading to\nidentification, and we have always to insist on cumulative and specific\nevidence transcending all possibilities of mere accident.\n3.\u2014Success and Faii.ure in Identification.\nThe mistakes in identification furnish a good introduction to\ncomments on the comparison of the successes with the failures in it.\nThe most striking feature of the experiments in this respect is\nthe fact that identification takes place correctly in so many\ninstances on such slight evidence without any cumulative force.\nIt is a striking fact that the experiments actually contrast with the\nPiper phenomena in this respect. The latter are not only specific facts\nof very great argumentative force but have that peculiar complexity\nof cumulative character which is generally illustrated in all such\nordinary matters as the conversation between friends over past\nrecollections. In these experiments the complexity of the incidents\nis far less noticeable, and yet the identification is assured and correct.\nQuite often a single incident is sufficient to determine the result, and\nwhen we can ascertain the reasons from the communicator as well as\nthe receiver, we find them entirely satisfactory. It is interesting to\nobserve that in no case have we allowed ourselves to be governed by\nso simple a criterion in the Piper phenomena. There we have insisted\non more rigid evidence and methods. If then the identification can be\njustified in the weaker case, it must be justified in the stronger.\nThere is another point also of some importance in estimating the\nvalue of the evidence in these experiments. It is the fact that the\nidentification has to be effected only by incidents and without any\nsuggestion of names. The communicator has to be ascertained solely\nby the mention of incidents calculated to suggest him. This is often\nthe case in the Piper experiments, but there we are often given\na clue in the definite mention of the name of the person from\nwhom the message purports to come. This gives a decided advantage\nfor identification which my experiments do not give. With a certain\nkind of incidents this linking of the name with them is liable to pro\nduce an illusion of identity ; but it affords a definite standard for the\ndistinction between the true and the false, and enables the mind to\napply more safely the cumulative argument, while it also puts the\n\fXLI.] 549\nAppendix IV.\nsitter in a position to measure more effectively the nature of test inci\ndents, and gives that complexity which the unity of consciousness\nought to show. Hence, if we can be so successful at identification by\nmere incidents without names, and by far less specific facts than the\nPiper case exhibits, we ought to appreciate the force of the argument\nfor some enormous supernormal powers on the part of Mrs. Piper,\nwhatever the theory we adopt to account for it.\nWith the advantage that the name is so often given in the Piper\ncase there goes, of course, the liability to illusions of apperception ;\nsince we may forget that general incidents may apply to other persons\nbesides the supposed communicator ; yet this is perhaps the only\nreal objection to the importance of the phenomena as evidence of\nthe supernormal of some kind. The synthetic unity of individual\ngroups of incidents, to say nothing of the cumulative unity of the\nseparate cases when taken together, constitutes an overwhelming\nargument for identity, on any theory we may choose to adopt as an\nexplanation. Illusions of apperception, if memory has any place in\nscientific evidence at all, appear to be almost completely eliminated.\nBut I shall not insist farther on the a fortiori argument from my\nexperiments to the Piper case. My main object was only to call\nattention to the fact that such a comparison could be made. What I\nwish to emphasise here is the surprising readiness and correctness with\nwhich identification took place in my experiments under less stringent\nevidence than that which we have been demanding in psychical\nresearch. I can lay no stress upon such cases as Exp. I. in Group\nA (p. 553), for the reasons there explained. But I may express the\nastonishment that I felt at' the time at the readiness of the receiver's\nguess when the question was so vague. I saw that identification could\neasily occur under far less exacting conditions than I had dreamed\npossible, accustomed as I was to treating the far more pertinent and\ncomplex unity of the Piper phenomena with so much scepticism. It\nbecame apparent at a glance that the incidents had to be far more\nindefinite in order to secure failure and to test accurately the question\nI was considering. Further, in spite of the most careful precautions\nin the later experiments to make the incidents or questions more\nindefinite and freer from suggestiveness, the identification often took\nplace in response to surprising indefiniteness and on the most slight\nevidential clues, if the Piper case be the standard by which to\nmeasure such evidence. The record shows this to any one who will\nexamine it carefully, and I need not mention specific instances of\nit. Only three failures may be said to have occurred, and one of\nthese was caused by a misunderstanding of the nature of the experi\nment. This was Exp. XV., Group A (p. 586). The other two are\nExp. VI. (p. 559) and X (p. 572). The former finally succeeded in\n\f550 [PART\nJ. E. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nidentification, and cannot be marked as a total failure. Hence there\nis but one total failure in identification, and I was struck at the time\nwith the cause of this failure, which was the undoubted inability to\nspontaneously apply inductive reasoning to the messages. I found the\ncase an illustration of the difficulties under which a discaruate spirit\nwould have to labour in proving its existence to most people. I\nexhausted all my resources, except giving my name, in the choice of\nincidents by which to identify myself, and failed. It is true that they\nwere of a somewhat different kind from those in other experiments,\nbut they were all that I could command in the case, and seemed to me\nin most instances to be very definite, as I still think they were. But\nthe fault was in the defective observation, recognition, and inductive\nreasoning of the receiver. In all other cases, especially where the mind\nof the receiver was alert and interested, the identification occurred\non slighter evidence than I had supposed possible.\nIn two of the experiments this identification and its assurance\nwere very striking. These are Exp. XIV., Group A (p. 583), and\nExp. I., Group B (p. 595). In the first of these I threw in incidents\nfor the purpose of diversion and confusion, as well as to test the\npossibilities of my own identification without any temptation to fuse\nmy identity with that of the person chiefly concerned. The case\ncould be classed in Group B on this account. But the spontaneous\ndistinction between myself and the personality of others by the receiver\nafter Question 8 is clear. The second instance is still better. The\ndistinction between myself and the person I was representing was\nmarked and positive, which was just what I intended or hoped to see,\nand all this, we must remember, was done without any suggestion of\nnames. [For Remarks on Personation see p. 617.]\nThe summary of the case for identification involves a distinction\nbetween several forms of it. The main distinction must be between\nthe persons that were intended to be identified and those that were\nnot, and both compared with the failures. I shall group them as\nfollows :\u2014\n1. Number of cases identified that were intended. Class A.\n2. Number of correct incidental identifications. Class B.\n3. Number of failures at identification. Class C.\nClass A. Class B. Class C.\n17 51 2\nIn Class A, I have placed only those representing the persons\nacting as communicators, or, as in two cases, personated for the\npurpose. I have placed one in the failures in spite of the fact that\nit was due to a misunderstanding of what was wanted, and would in\nall probability have been a success but for that misunderstanding. I\n\fXLI.] 551\nAlypendix IV.\nhave also placed a large number of successes among the incidental\ncases, Class B, because they were not communicators. They represent\nidentification on slight but pertinent clues, and were perfectly correct,\nthough not always entitled to any importance from a scientific point\nof view. Some of them, however, were actually intended in the\nmessages of the communicator, and might very well be reckoned\namong the cases in Class A. As it is, we have 17 successes against\n2 failures, and on evidence immeasurably inferior to that in the Piper\ncase. If we now add to these\u2014as we have a right to do from the\nstandpoint of intention on the part of the communicator\u2014all those\namong the incidental cases that were intended by the communicator\nto mislead or encourage suspense of judgment on the part of the\nreceiver, we should have the following tabular account, thus reckoning\nin Class A 24 intended identifications among those in Class B.\nThis table makes the case stand 41 successes to 2 failures, with\nthe outstanding possibility that the 27 cases in Class B. might be\ngiven some weight on the side of Class A. It must be remembered,\nalso, that I have left wholly out of account Exp. IX. in Group A\n(p. 567), in which I might have counted several successes.\nI add a few remarks concerning Group C. As intimated, it was\ncarried on without the telegraph arrangement. This enabled me to\nimitate the Piper experiments more accurately. I could work up the\nincidents so as to imitate the incoherences and confusion of different\nincidents so common in the Piper record. If the case is examined, it\nwill be found to reproduce many of the features of the Piper sittings.\nBut in spite of incoherence and confusion of distinct incidents, the\n\" sitter \" almost unfailingly identified the right person, even when\nindicated out of his proper connection, or the right event or place, and\nlocated them properly. I met the same surprise here, as in my first\nexperiments, at the slightness of the clue necessary to lead to identifi\ncation. The direct recognition by Mr. G. of his father at the use of\nthe word \" anthropogenic \" (see p. 610) was a brilliant and suggestive\nact. Nor was the recognition of his connection with a murderer less\ninteresting. But perhaps the slightest clue of all was that by which\nhe guessed Philadelphia (see p. 611). There was here nothing but a\nremote symbolic suggestion, and yet it was prompt and accurate. The\nmiserable pun which I made on the name Housatonic (name of a\nriver)\u2014namely, \" How's a tonic,\" with a reference to saying mass for\nsome one's soul for the State in which the river is\u2014did not fail to\nsuggest what I intended, in spite of the incoherence in the message.\nIt was also most interesting to remark that the two incidents which\nClass A.\n41\nClass B.\n27\nClass C.\n2\n\f552 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthe father chose with the greatest confidence that they would identify\nhimself or his wife were the names of Harrison Avenue and Ives\nPlace, the latter being the name of the farm where the receiver was\nborn ! But if the reader will examine carefully the messages and the\nguesses, he will find how astonishingly accurate the receiver was on\nslight clues and amid difficulties that some of our scientific Philistines\nwould regard as insuperable. In other words, the judgment of\nidentification in this and the Piper case unquestionably represents some\nclaims to scientific consideration, to say the very least that can be said\nof it. We may not be satisfied with the verdict in favour of spiritism\nin either case, and I do not care to enforce that conclusion ; but on\nany theory the significance of the facts for some important conclusion\nmust be recognised, and if experiments of this kind spontaneously\nreproduce a record like that of the Piper sittings, we must admit that\nthe latter has some weight as evidence of spiritism. We find further\nthat these experiments completely refute all objections based on the\ntriviality of the incidents, and show indubitably that we have no right\nto draw any conclusions from them as to the character or habits of\nmind possessed by the communicators.\n5.\u2014Summary.\nThe important matters of interest in these experiments and com\nments upon them may be summarised in the following manner, which\nshows further the points of comparison between them and the Piper\ncase.\n1. The spontaneous choice of trivial incidents by the communi\ncators for the purpose of identification.\n2. The illegitimacy of inferences as to the character or mental\ncondition of communicators drawn from the nature of the incidents\nfor identification.\n3. Correct identification of names from mere incidents common\nto two lives, or correct judgments in regard to facts only hinted at.\n4. Identification of persons on slight but pertinent clues, which\nare without cumulative force.\n5. The establishment of assurance in regard to the communicator,\nin spite of incoherence and diversions or contradictions.\nG. Errors of memory on the part of \" sitters \" that lead to con\nfusion and failure in recognition.\n7. The natural differences in the personal equation affecting the\nchoice of incidents for identification, as illustrated in the failure to recog\nnise incidents or persons\u2014e.g., Group A, Exp. I., Ques. 3, and others.\n8. Occasional liability to illusion from the element of chance,\nunless the incidents become cumulative enough to overcome it.\n\fAppendix IV. 553\n9. Difficulty and confusion in the communicator when trying to\nselect at once incidents for identification.\nThis last feature cannot be appreciated by the reader of this record,\nbut could be detected only by an eye-witness of the experiments them\nselves. Being a witness of them I was struck by the fact which is\nalso noticeable in communications with the telephone when the party\nis limited in time for his communications. The communicator's mind\nbeing set in the direction of specifically pertinent incidents for iden\ntification in reference to a particular friend, and being limited in time\nfor their choice, there was the interesting mental struggle and con\nfusion which every one could observe for himself in the play of\nassociation endeavouring to make the right selection of incidents\nfor the purpose. We can imagine the situation of a discarnate spirit\nwhich can have but a few minutes at least for communication, and\nprobably working under enormous difficulties of which we know\nnothing, to say nothing of the wrench that death might give the\nmemory, if the usual physiological theories of that faculty are to\nbe accepted.\nGROUP A.\u2014I.\nColumbia University, January 30th, 1899.\nCommunicator : Mrs. H.

If I could well come to see her I would do so, but I have my\nchildren to care for, and am too busy to take the time. Besides I live where\nit is not so convenient to call as it was once.\nMiss B. : I am certain of it. It is Mary. I know it cannot be\nany one else.\n(On inquiry why she had guessed my wife so quickly as to be practically\ncertain at the first telegram, though I succeeded in throwing her off the\nscent for the moment, she replied that she knew from the age mentioned\nthat it could be no one else, and that at that age, \" twelve or thirteen,\" she\nwas only at one place, and that was in Germany during the whole time.\nThis narrowed the guess down very much, and, of course, shows that my\nquestion was a mistake on my part. I should have made the time more\nindefinite. Had I known that this explicit age would have fixed both the\ntime and the number of acquaintances so narrowly, I should have said some\nthing more indefinite. Besides, there is the fact that both my acquaintance\nwith Miss B. and the difficulty I had in securing her co-operation, taken\nwith the fact that her family and mine exchange frequent social calls, would\ntend to suggest my wife. Consequently, I cannot attach any interest to the\nsuccess of her guessing.\nI do not require to record any of the remaining questions which I\nintended to telegraph, or have telegraphed to her, but can only say that they\nled gradually to more specific incidents in the lives of Mrs. H. and Miss B.,\nso that if the guess was not made on the indefinite ones it could be made on\nthe more distinct incidents. The other cases are better.\u2014J. H. H.)\nFebruary 5th, 1899.\nI wrote to Miss B. a few days after the experiment to ascertain her\nreasons for making the inference she did at once after the first message, and\nalso to see if my conjecture made above about the mental situation\ncalculated to suggest the communicator was correct. The following is the\nlady's reply. J fl RmU.\nDear Professor Hvsi.op.\u2014The impression I retain of the first telegram\nis that it was as follows: \"I met you abroad when you were twelve or\nthirteen years of age in short dresses. I have met you since in this country\nand we have become good friends. Am I a man or am I a woman ? \" or words\nto that efl'ect. I answered, \"Mary.\" This was the first and most natural\nthing that occurred to me. In fact I did not exert my mind in the least as\nmy belief all along was that the whole affair of the telegrams was a blind\nto put me off my guard for the real test. I felt, of course, that you had\nsomething to do with the concoction of the messages, and this undoubtedly\n\fXLI.] 555\nAppendix IV.\ninfluenced me. It could hardly be otherwise. She was the only person, I\nfelt, that you knew I could have met in this way, and my answer seemed the\ninevitable one.\u2014Very sincerely, q g\n(The original question will show the reader that I had not inserted the\nword \"abroad\" in the message, and that I made no allusion to the\ncommunicator's meeting the receiver in this country. This is an interpolation\nof the receiver's, a very natural illusion in the case. The remainder of the\nletter confirms my suspicion of the influences that suggested the answer and\nthe mistake of putting the question in the form it has. But I had neither\nsuspected nor prepared myself for the possibility of carrying on the\nexperiment to identify any one else. I merely saw that in all future\nquestions I had to be more indefinite.\u2014J. H. II.)\nGROUP A.\u2014II.\nNew York, January 30th, 1899.\nCommunicator : Miss O. Receiver : Mrs. H.\nIn this report, instead of indicating who is sending the telegrams by\ngiving the initials as before, I shall simply adopt the abbreviation \"Com.\"\nfor communicator and \"Rec. \" for receiver.\nI had managed to bring Mrs. H. down to the place for the purpose of\ncommunicating with Miss B., and before coming told her that it might take\nuntil twelve o'clock. I did not tell her that it was my intention that she\nwas to act as receiver. As soon as Miss B. had succeeded in assuring herself\nof the person at the other end, I telegraphed to Mrs. II. that I wished her\nto guess for some one. I then ordered the telegrams to begin.\nIt should be further said that I had called at Miss O.'s home on Saturday\nlast without Mrs. H.'s knowledge. Mrs. H. had understood that I was going\nto the college. I had talked the telegrams over in order to make theui as\nindefinite as possible and in order to shape them in such a manner as to avoid\nearly guessing. \u2014J. H. H.\n1. Com. : Mrs. H., how are you ? You ought to know me when you\nlearn that I, at least, know where you live. I think I have met you several\ntimes during the last few years.

Q. 10, p. 5(i4.)\n(Receiver made no guess here, but tells me after her return home that the\nstatement had no meaning for her. I explained that Miss O. told me that the\nincident was a real one and that it took place at our house, Mrs. H. having\nthought it nonsense to throw her off the track or confuse her, and not having\nany memory of any one eating German coffee cake at our house. \u2014J.

Com. : You and your husband once took dinner at our house and\nMr. Hyslop talked with my uncle on some interesting questions connected\nwith his work at Columbia.

Com. : I remember also an intimate acquaintance of yours who\nattended Barnard, and with whom I used to study down there. We used\noften to discuss the Civil War, she defending the Confederate side and I the\nother. Could you guess me 1\nRec. : I'm sure it is Miss Osborne. (My assistant adds Mrs. H.'s\nremark : \"The person with whom she conversed on the war was Miss\nHall.\")\n(I here sent back word that the guess was correct, and said it was not\nnecessary to go any further with the experiment.

Mr. McW. told me that he did not know of any reason\nfor asking such a question, so far as his own knowledge went, and that it was\nsimply a wild question. After the experiment was over Dr. V. I. said that\nthe question had thrown him completely off the track, because he had\nbought a red necktie last fall, and was wearing it then, and had thought of\na Mr. B., a freshman, who used to joke him about it, but that he, V.

Com. : How are you getting along with the flute ?\nRec. : McW. without question.\n(This was correct, and the guess had been so several times, and it seemed\nunnecessary to do any bluffing, as it would only have taken up time and\nended in the same result. \u2014J. H. H.)\nRemarks. \u2014Mr. McW. had met Dr. V. I. only comparatively recently\nand had not been with him so very often, and was not an intimate acquaintance\nof the gentleman. It is possible that this fact may have helped to run down\nthe right person in the guessing, but the main facts were vague enough for\nus to have expected more delay in the success, except perhaps for the possi\nbility always that the incidents or questions may have a much narrower signi\nficance than even the interrogator might suppose. The reading of the score\ntogether might not have been a frequent incident, as it turned out it\nwas not, in the experience of the receiver. It was a priori probable also\nwith McD.\u2014J. H.

The assumption that any\nrelevant person could be guessed and recognised spoils this case also. But it\nstill illustrates preconception, though not to the same extent as in the\nnext experiment.\u2014J. H. H.)\nGROUP A.\u2014IX.\nNew York, February 2nd, 1899.\nCommunicator : Professor Hyslop. Receiver : Professor C.\nThis experiment turned out absolutely useless for the purpose of the\ngeneral series. The wrong answer to the first question made it impossible,\nwith the short time of half-an-hour at our disposal, to run the receiver off\nthe track suggested by my name, the reason for which appears in the answer\nof the same person in the experiment of January 31st.\nBefore beginning the sending of messages the receiver sent me word\nthat he had only twenty-five minutes at his disposal, while in other cases\nwe had a full hour. The first question was designed to suggest any one of a\n\f568 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ngroup, a small group, of persons about the university and others who may\nhave been at Johns Hopkins University when Professor C. was there. The\nanswer given was absurd, as I was not at this institution until long after the\nreceiver. But in mentioning my name the receiver established the point de\nrepere about which some equivocal facts were to turn, and hence their\nidentification with me is liable to the objection of an illusion of identity,\nthough no such illusion is involved. Several later questions were in\ntended to suggest another person in a neighbouring city who was more\nclosely associated with the receiver at the time denoted by the queries than\nmyself. But the false suggestion at first of my name gave an associative\nclue to some questions that might not have recalled me at all. Hence the\nsuccess has no value at all in the case. It could only count as a possible\nillustration of the tendency to accept a hypothesis for a fact that consists\nwith it, but which might not of itself suggest it. This is borne out by the\ntendency to throw off all irrelevant matter in the case as not calculated to\ndisturb the conviction already formed.\nAnother fact has some importance in the case. The experimental work\nof the receiver has been conducted upon the fact that subjects and agents\nwere connected with this university, and his own habits of thought lay at\nthe basis of his first induction, and knowing that I was engaged in the general\nexperiment there was a natural limitation to the number to be guessed from.\nThe same absurd guess was made on the first message on January 31st,\nas indicated by its language, and more distinctly by his personal statement\nafterward, when he said that he did not intend it as a guess, because he\nrecognised that the incident did not suggest the name directly. Ilis idea was\nthat being conscious that I was back of the experiment, I had something to\ndo with the message. This is relevant as a guess, but not as a suggestion,\nand in any case it indicates enough already in consciousness to make the\nresult useless for the problem before us, though the manner of answering\nand discarding the incidents not relevant to the person suggested at first\nillustrates more natural control of the clue than was true of many others\nin the experiments. The experiment, however, is recorded here as it\noccurred.\nt. Com. : Do you remember me while you were at Johns Hopkins i\nRec. : Hyslop.\n(There was no reason, in fact, to suspect this as mine, as I had not been\nthere until long after him. I am not even certain whether any one at this\nuniversity was there at the time. Hence there is only the name of Johns\nHopkins and the fact that I had been there to give any pertinence even to\na guess, and that only as a person who was connected with the message.\nBut it spoiled the whole result. It would have applied better to another\ncolleague.\u2014J. H. H.)\n2. Coin. : Do you remember George Morris ?\nRec. : Hyslop.\n(This again was a perfectly absurd answer. It was relevant only as\nimplying that I had sent the message, not as a memory of me in connec\ntion with George Morris, who had lectured at Johns Hopkins at least near\nthe time that Professor C. was there. But I never knew him, and was not\nthere until seven or eight years after that date. But again the fixity of the\n\fXLI.] 569\nAppendix IV.\nreceiver's mind upon my name was such that equivocal incidents were not\ncalculated to throw it off, and the answer to the next question was half sug\ngested by a preconception. \u2014J. H. H.)\n3. Com. : You and I were at a meeting with T. and S. H. in Phila\ndelphia.\nRec. : I say Hyslop, not sure.\n(This answer was pertinent and true. But the two men mentioned have\nnever been at any similar meeting since then, and the receiver had only\nseen me twice before, and we had not talked together at this meeting.\nThis fact is probably the source of the receiver's doubt in the case. The\ntest of his memory for small incidents independently of these experiments\nconvinces me that it would be too problematic to say that the suggestion\nhad only a possible consistency with the original hypothesis. But this\nquestion and several others were designed to lead up to the suggestion of\nanother person, as will appear. But I had to omit two of the intended\nincidents on account of the point de rep&re already in mind, and consistent\nwith, though not readily suggestible by them.\u2014J. H. H.)\n4.

The receiver afterward told me that the name had no meaning to\nhim, and that he neither understood it nor sent any reply to it, though I\ntalked with him not more than ten minutes after the experiment. But the\nfact is that the telegram received from his end of the line stands in the\noriginal record in the handwriting of the telegrapher. The probability is that\nthis judgment about it by the receiver is confused with the later reference\nto the same name where my repetition of it was calculated to throw him off\nthe track. But the persistency of my name in connection with absolutely\nirrelevant matter appeared to be a case of fixed or persistent ideas that made\nit impossible to succeed in any reasonable diversions from them.

I shaped the question so that it might as easily apply to the\nreceiver's present residence, though it would not be true in that connection,\nand had my name not already been in the receiver's mind, the statement\nwould not have suggested me, because I had not been able to keep a promise\nto visit him at his present home. \u2014J.

The incident, which it is not necessary\nto detail, would suggest me to any man who had told the story with\nreference to me at an alumni dinner, and the answer is an unquestionable\nidentification of me, though it adds dubiousness to the pertinence of the\nothers in spite of their objective correctness.\u2014J. H. H.)\nNote 1.\u2014In regard to the receiver's impression, told me ten minutes\nafter the experiment, that Question 4 had no meaning, and that he had not\nsent any reply to it, I have mentioned the record in the telegram sent me.\nThe record kept by my assistant at the other end also shows that the\nreceiver's answer was taken and sent.\u2014J. H. H.\nNote 2.\u2014 I had surmised from the answers in this experiment and also\nthe first one with the same receiver, that he was not correctly informed of\nthe nature of it, but that he imagined that he had simply to guess the\nrelevancy of an incident to some person whom it suggested. On inquiry\nthis morning (February 3rd) of the man who was with the receiver at the\nopposite end of the line, and who was new as an assistant for the purpose of\nconcealing more effectually the probable or possible person communicating,\nI found that he had not made the duty of the receiver perfectly clear. He\nreports to me that he had told the receiver the secret nature of certain\nfeatures of the experiment\u2014that it was one in recognition, and that he\nwould receive messages from some one\u2014but that perhaps he did not make it\nclear whether the sender was supposed to be necessarily at the other end or\nnot. Afterward Professor C, during the experiment and soon after it had\nstarted, inquired whether it could be a person who was there or not. Even\nthis seems not to have evoked any answer sufficiently clear to make the\nguesses or inferences what they ought to have been and were intended to be\non my part. This then fully explains the nature of the answers and the\nillusion under which I acted from the answers sent.\nNevertheless, though the experiment does not illustrate what I wished\nto show, it has an interest of another kind. It shows very clearly on the\nside of the receiver just what influence preconception will have upon the\njudgment and how many identifications in the Piper case must run this\ngauntlet before they are granted any evidential value. On the other hand,\nthe similar illusion under which I had to act in the interpretation of the\nresult illustrates the cross purposes under which communications between two\npersonalities must be conducted when there are either extreme difficulties in\nthe way of its being effected at all, or similar difficulties in the way of a\nready understanding. There is in this experiment some resemblance to the\nconfusion in the Piper phenomena where the communications, at least so-\ncalled, show similar misunderstanding, though there we often have the time\nand opportunity to correct them. Here I could not do so, as this would\nlead to my identity in a way contrary to the object of the experiment.\nFurther it illustrates well how that confusion may arise in a sitting and\nperhaps not be corrected because of the failure to have a second one, and\nthe consequence is that the case is given up as useless. But when we know the\ncause of failure, if that is possible, we might have reason to see that the\nfacts are at least not opposed to the natural supposition that it is supernormal.\nThe mistakes and illusions in the experiment here described are perfectly\n\f572 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nnatural to both parties in the case and can be definitely determined and\nproved, and enable us to say whether the results are good for anything or\nnot. This is not always so easy, if possible at all, in the Piper instance, but\nthe difficulties ave of the type here indicated and show that we cannot\nform a negative judgment on the ground of them.\nIn connection with the presence of preconception and its influence on\nthe receiver and perhaps the communicator as well, there is a more important\nresemblance to the Piper case. Here I was endeavouring to suggest another\nperson than myself and one more intimately associated with the receiver at\nthe time of the incidents and the place in which they occurred than\nmyself. Now if we suppose that I was that person and trying to make\nmyself known to the receiver in the broken way that the Piper incidents\nexhibit, it would appear that I utterly failed in this, and only suggested another\nperson altogether. On the other hand, the receiver, starting out with a false\nidea of the limitations under which the inferences were to be made, first\nsupposes this other person (myself) and with this preconception\u2014created as\nmuch by a knowledge of my connection with the experiment as by the\nassumed privilege of supposing any one besides the communicator as the\nsender of messages\u2014it was natural to stick to the personality of the one first\nthought of, if the incidents mentioned later were consistent with it, and to\ndiscard as irrelevant all matter not consistent with it. Hence the only reason\nthat any correctness can be attached to the judgments of the receiver, in\nthe first incidents, is the fact that I had deliberately choseu cases of\nan equivocal character, which, some of them at least, were relevant to both\nmyself and the person I had in mind. The misunderstanding in regard to\nthe duty of the receiver, the assumption as to possible persons within the\nlimits of the guessing, and the preconception established by the first supposi\ntion prevented any suggestibility being found in the incidents intended to\nsuggest the identity of another person altogether. This illustrates\nmany incidents in the Piper phenomena, and we have to be as careful about\nrejecting it on account of these failures as in accepting it on the ground\nof its successes\nGROUP A.\u2014X.\nNew York, Febnmry Ut, 1899.\nCommunicator : Professor Hyslop.

Receiver : Professor B.\nThe present experiment has more resemblances to the report of the\nphenomena recorded regarding Mrs. Piper than any other that I performed.\nI felt that I could give it that character more safely than before, because I\ncould assume that the receiver was familiar enough to understand the style\nof messages to be sent, and the results proved that in that respect I was not\nmistaken. There was one mistake on the part of my assistant at the\nreceiver's end of the line, due to an earnest but mistaken caution that failed\nto make perfectly clear what the receiver was to do. My intention was that\nhe should know that he was not only to identify any one that the incidents\nrecalled, but also to decide finally and assuredly who was sending the\nmessages. In this case the receiver did not clearly understand that he was\nto infer who was sending the telegrams. Hence the result was a failure in\nthis respect, though the experiment has a value of another kind. The\nfailure is not wholly due to the misunderstanding mentioned, as the identifi\ncation of others intended by the incidents mentioned was correct, and only\nthe improbability that Mrs. B. should be present kept her out of the range\nof suggestion. She should have been as readily suggested as the persons\nactually named, and no doubt would have been had not the slight misunder\nstanding alluded to occurred. The experiment, nevertheless, has an interest\nfor features that will come under notice in their place.\n1. Com. : I know you, I know I do. You will be surprised to find me\nhere.

The incidents sent this time, owing to the short allotment of time\nat command, also assured more ready clues to identity, though there is one\ninterest in the result that is useful in spite of this fact.

But\nthere is enough difference to separate their record from that of the former.\nThe same general problem of identification is involved, but it is a little\nmore complicated and suggestive. The chief aim of Group A was to identify\nthe sender, whether the other persons mentioned were correct or not. The\naim in this group will be to represent two or more personalities in the\nincidents and to test the receiver's judgment in regard to the accuracy of his\ndistinction between the different persons involved in the incidents. This is\nto some extent attempted in some of Group A, but not in as systematic a\nmanner as in this set. Besides, there may be less uniformity of character in\nthe present set. But with whatever differences between the two groups,\nthere will be very decided resemblances in the fact that the same kind of\nincidents will be chosen and the same secrecy involved in the situation of\nthe receiver. The proper difference between the two sets of experiments\nwill consist in the attempt simultaneously to secure the identification of two\npersons by incidents that will not fuse into the same apperception mass.\nThere may also be some variety in the group, representing slight differences\nin method and complexity, but on the whole it will consist of cases such\nas have just been described.\nThis experiment is one in which the subject of it was brought to\ncommunicate with another, and was detained as receiver without previous\nexpectation that such would be the case. Hence there was all the secrecy\ndesired. In it I myself personated the incidents in the life of another\nperson, and threw into them expressions that belonged only to myseft and\nthe life of ourselves, so that there was the opportunity to discover the\nidentity of more than one person in the case.\n2 q 2\n\f596 [part\nJ.

Com. : Well, you got married at last without being threatened with an\nold maid's lot. Do you remember any one who moved about the time\nyou did ?\n(Before sending the question about the person who had moved, Mrs.\nHyslop remarked to my assistant: \"I guess it is Mr. Hyslop himself.\"\nThen evidently a pause, as the further note by assistant says : \" Yes, I do.\nI was wondering if he would get Mrs. O. down here. \"\nThe suspicion that the statement belonged to me was correct, as no one\nwas likely to allude to an old maid's lot except myself. But the latter\nsentence in the message had no reference to me whatever, and the distinction\nbetween it and the first is clearly implied.\nThen after sending the query about where the person in mind had lived\nbefore moving, the assistant records the remark : \" I think that's Mrs. 0. I\nam sure.\" Then the question about her son's sleep came, and pertained to\nincidents familiar to Mrs. O. and my wife.\u2014J. H.

You must say, I can't.\n(I had in mind the person who was recognised later as Mrs. W. , and I\nsent my reply here as a diversion, though I thought that my wife had in\nmind another person to whom this might apply, as I found later that it did,\nbut I had forgotten the circumstance that this party had moved from this\nstreet.\u2014J.

But I\nanswered \" yes\" in order to keep up the deception for a time, and it seems\nto have confirmed, as it perhaps should, the impression already formed. The\nanswer asking Mrs. O. was pertinent, though I had not intended her at the\noutset of my question. I have found since also that my impression about the\ntime that Mrs. W. had moved was not so accurate as I thought, and\nthat the statement fitted Mrs. 0. better than Mrs. W. This is an interesting\nfact, though the difference of time in the moving of Mrs. W. does not exclude\nher in general from the question. But I was wrong nevertheless about its\ndegree of nearness to our own moving, and so the suggestion was correctly\nanswered from the point of view of the receiver. \u2014J. H. H.)\n3.

I threw it in here\nto see if it would be properly placed and distinguished from the other\nincidents, and later this result is apparent.\u2014J. H. H.)\n6. Com. : Just where was it that you lived in Philadelphia ? I lived\nthere myself, but do not recollect your address for the moment.\nRec. : Send more.\n7. Com. : Who says Snobble Snumpkins ?\nRec. : That's what I cill Winifred.\n(This name is merely a pet name with which Mrs. H. is accustomed to\ntease our little girl, and it was thrown in here partly for diversion and\npartly for the object of this experiment.\u2014J.

(Remarks to assistant: \"The fourth throws\nme off.\")\n( 1 1 is clear here that the receiver's mind is beginning to look elsewhere\nfor a clue, and the next question shows the readiness with which the two\nclues are correctly put together. \u2014J. H. H.)\n9. Com. : Do you remember that I bought a piano and began the study\nof music to amuse myself before the illness and death of my mother ?\nRec : Did you ever live at 167, West 81st Street 1\n(This in the correct question to ask, as it names the former residence of\nthe person 1 had in mind, Mrs. W.

Please come back to the main track.\n(The name here was the pet name with which I teased my little boy, and\nits recognition has no special consequence, but the added request to come\nback to the main track shows very clearly that the receiver refused to identify\nit with the suspected Mrs W., who I knew was not aware of the expression\nat all. This interpretation of the reply was spontaneously confirmed by Mrs.\nHyslop's remark afterwards that Mrs. W. knew nothing of this. \u2014.1. H. H.)\n(To my assistant Mrs. Hyslop adds the remark : \" Mr. Hyslop sends\n5th, 7th and 10th questions.\")\n11. Com. : Do you remember that the last time I saw you I remarked that\nit was easier to come up to your place than I had thought it was ?\nRec. : Do you live on 121st Street ?

Then he said it without the\nslightest sense of humour. Guess me, now.\nRec. : 5, 7, 10, and 12 are Mr. Hyslop's questions. Is Mrs. W. there ?\n(This answer has considerable interest. It shows that the receiver's\nmemory was good enough to recall the fact that Mrs. W. neither knew the\nincident indicated about my little boy nor could be identified with the\nreference to the want of the sense of humour in my boy, which was a matter\nof frequent remark to my wife and only a few others who could not be\nsuggested in any of the messages here sent. This was what I had aimed\nat.\u2014J. H. H.)\n13. Com. : Do you remember that you bought some of your table-ware at\nthe store I know so well in Philadelphia ?\nRec. : That's Mrs. W. At the Simons store. I'm going home. Mrs.\nW. can come out and see me. (Then, a moment later) : Is Mrs. W. there ?\nCom. : You are right in your guess, but Mrs. W. is not here.\nMrs. W. lives in New York, and is a sister of the person whose store in\nPhiladelphia is named. (This 13th question was sent merely to seal the\nsuggestions given in the others, and it was natural from the nature of the\nprevious experiments that Mrs. W.'s presence would be supposed. \u2014\nJ. H. H.)\nGROUP B.-II.\nThis set of experiments can be classed in Group B, though there are\nmany features of it that would justify placing it in Group A. There is the\nmain purpose to seek for the identification of a single person, as the largest\npart of the incidents chosen relate to the chief person to be identified ; but as\nthere was a distinct purpose to throw me off the main track on certain\nother definite persons, the experiment can be classed in Group B. It also\ndiffers from those conducted with the telegraph line in that this method\nof communicating between the sender and receiver was abandoned for\nthat of using an intermediary who should either bring the messages to me\nor send them by mail without using the handwriting of the person to be\nidentified. The secrecy and method in all other respects were the same\nas in the use of the telegraph. I have also the advantage of studying\nmyself the nature of the situation and mental operations directly, where\nbefore I had to largely infer it until informed by interrogation of the parties\nBut in this experiment I was myself the receiver, and was in a position to\nknow quite distinctly the conditions under which the inferences of my other\nsubjects were made. The results were the same, and can be studied with the\nsame interest and profit.\nCommunicator : Doctor F. Receiver : Professor Hyslop.\n1. Com. : I knew you several years ago.\nRec. : No suggestion.\n\fXLI.] 599\nAppendix IV.\n(This message was not intended to have any special pertinence accord\ning to subsequent statement of sender.)\n2. Com. : Were you not on Amsterdam Avenue about two weeks ago ?\nRec. : Yes, Miss Stettheimer.\n(1 had in mind the incident which I had sent as communicator to this\nlady as receiver in a previous set of experiments ; then, assuming that the\nsender had in view the same part of the Avenue that I had, the inference was\npertinent, and since the coincidence could hardly have been true of any one\nelse, it would have been correct ; but afterwards I found that the sender\nhad in view another part\u2014the other end of the Avenue\u2014of which I should\nnever have thought, in spite of the fact that it was the end below the college\nthat I came over every day. Consequently the case is a very pretty illustra\ntion of the illusion of apperception. The identification was correct from my\nmemory of the possible persons who saw me about the time mentioned on\nthe part of the Avenue I thought of, but as regards the part thought of by\nthe sender it was a mistake, and illustrates the misunderstanding that can\neasily occur between communicators and sitters where the statements are\ncapable of a variety of meanings in spite of their apparent simplicity.\u2014\nJ. H. H.)\n3. Com. : You seemed to be carrying a copy of The Sun.\nRec. : No suggestion.\n(Only on two occasions within any recent date had I carried a copy\nof The Sun, and when the question came to me I had some little difficulty\nin recalling whether it was on Amsterdam Avenue that I had carried\nboth of them. At last before answering I remembered that it was on\nThird Avenuo that I could have been seen carrying it once -and on\nAmsterdam Avenue in the second case, but as I could remember seeing no\none on either occasion, I could not even make an intelligible guess. But the\ncommunicator's explanation of the question afterwards shows that it had\nless definiteness and pertinence than I was disposed and entitled to consider\nit when taken alone. He says that he did not know that this was a fact\nregarding The Sun, but that he had seen me on Amsterdam Avenue from his\nwindow with a newspaper in my hand and simply knew about the circumstance\nthat would possibly make a reference to this particular paper relevant,\nthough the statement was not known nor intended to be as pertinent as it\nseemed to be to me.\u2014J. H. H.)\n4. Com. : I should think you might reply to such a so-called critique.\nRec. : No suggestion.\n(No special importance was intended by this question. It was only a\nmore specific suggestion of the thought in the mind of the sender, limiting\nthe application in his mind\u2014and unknown to him also in mine\u2014to\none of the cases in which I could have been seen carrying a copy of The Sun.\nIn this case again, it was only the failure to remember any one seen on the\nAvenue at the time I carried the copy in question that prevented me from a\nguess as pertinent from my point of view as the second message, though\nfrom that of the communicator it had little but an imaginary pertinence. \u2014\nJ.

Hyslop, Ph.D.\n(Inquiry of the sender shows that the expression \" public conveyance \"\nwas used purposely as a misleading form of language, as the thing in mind\nwas a ferry-boat, while I thought of an omnibus and street car. It repre\nsented a true occurrence as between myself and the communicator, but was\nobscure and trivial, as it did not purport to mean anything that I should\neither necessarily or probably be expected to remember. But my memory\nhad to be tested as preliminary to more specific incidents.\u2014J. H. H.)\n6. Com. : Later I saw you at a reception.\nRec. : Would apply to many.

Com. : Do you know who is to review your book for the Political\nScience Quarterly?\nRec. : No. But it could be Merriam.\n(I thought of three persons here as likely to put this question, but I\ndecided for the one mentioned in my answer on the ground of general\nimprobability for the other two, as being too open a question for them to\nput, and the one named had not only taken part in these experiments, but\nhad been in the room recently and had as an outsider taken the lectures\nwhich made up the book. My inference was a mere guess, rather as a\npossibility than any inference involving any assurance. But the sender\nintended it as a means of keeping my mind on as many tacks as possible.\u2014\nJ. H. H.)\n8. Com. : I shall be very glad to receive a copy if you have any to spare.\nRec. : No suggestion. (Question of no special significance.)\n9. Cbm. : Shall I see you at the next faculty meeting ?\nRec. : No.\n(Communicator explains that the question was intended to open the way\nto a more definite suggestion of a colleague later on and to continue the\ngeneral object of diverting my mind toward as many persons as possible.\u2014\nJ. H. H.)\n10. Com. : How is your brother now !\nRec. : No suggestion, though if my memory were good, I could limit\nthis question te a few.\n(This question was far more definite than the sender imagined, as the\nintermediary who was acquainted with its purpose at once noticed and\nexpressed afterward his surprise at the reception it met. Still I had thought\nof something quite different from what the sender had in mind, and could\nnot have guessed the incident he intended by it. He had met my\nbrother who was here for a short time several years ago. five I think, and I\ncould not imagine who it could be that was in any way acquainted with him.\nHe was somewhat, yes, considerable, of an invalid at tho time, and was\nunable to continue his course on account of his illness. But I thought of\nacquaintances of this period only as a possibility, my main attention being\ndirected to the possibility that the brother was concerned who was specially\nmentioned in my sittings at Boston, which I had detailed to only a few\nstudents, and I was trying to limit the probabilities to the two or three\nmost likely to think of them. But I had to weigh the probabilities between\nmy invalid brother, with the possible persons who might have known him,\n\fAppendix IV. 601\nand those who might have put the question from the memory of my narrative,\nand I could make no probable guess, though the question was much more\nspecific from my point of view than from that of the communicator. The\nsender also knew nothing of my brother's illness.\u2014J. H. H.)\n11. Com. : When did you hear from George last ?\nRec. : No suggestion.\n(I betrayed from my manner to the intermediary my consciousness of an\ninteresting pertinence in this question, as I had another brother by this\nname, and coming after the previous question it definitely excluded iny\ninvalid brother from the case, as this brother George had never been in the\ncity and his name could be known only to those who had heard me narrate\nthe results of my Piper sittings, where this brother was mentioned, and he\nwas the one I had in mind as the alternative to the invalid brother. Still\nI could not definitely identify the communicator in any way. Further his\nown explanation of the question is that it had no special object, the name\nGeorge having come into his mind by mere chance. From his point of view\nit was therefore neither a true incident nor a pertinent question, while as\na fact also I had not narrated my experiences to him. Consequently its\npertinence was a mere matter of chance.\u2014 J. H. H. )\n12. Com. : Is Mrs. Hyslop well ?\nRec. : Marvin.\n(This answer was suggested by the relative pertinence of this question to\nthe line of thought suggested by the two previous ones. They all fit together,\nand as there were in my mind only two persons likely to ask all three\nof them, and one of these was in the room with me, I guessed the other.\nFrom my point of view this answer was most probable, but as there was no\ncumulative purpose in the three questions and no special purpose in this one\nby the communicator, but only a question of general diversion, we see a most\ninteresting source of illusion between sender and receiver.\u2014J. H. H.)\n13. Com. : Were you not a candidate for a position some time ago, for\nwhich you were unsuccessful !\nRec. : Yes, but no suggestion.\n(Communicator states that this refers to a true incident of which he\nknew, but which was a different one from that which I had in mind. The\none in his mind was some eleven years ago, and the one suggested to me by\nthe question was not more than four or five years ago. But in either case it\nwas not a very suggestive question, especially the case in his mind,\nas I was not likely to have mentioned it to him, and not likely to have\nremembered it if I did. Still it is pertinent, and it might be assumed\npossible for me to recall the fact, but the more important case in my mind\nprevented association from going any farther.\u2014J. H. H.)\n14. Com. : Do you recall lecturing a few years ago before a body of men i\nYou talked of depth.\nRec. : Cushing.\n(The communicator was present at this lecture, and my answer showed\nthat his question was rightly interpreted, and the name indicated was that\nof the chairman of the evening. I was asked to talk on experiments in\nspace perception in company with another officer of the college who was to\ntalk on another subject. There were only two names besides my own\n\f602 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nsuggested by the question, and I had no memory of any others whatever,\nand, as I was practically certain that my colleague could not be the sender,\nwhile the man named was in the institution at present, and could easily have\nbeen the communicator, I ventured on his name, though conscious that it\ncould as well or better be some one else whom I could not recall. Hence\nboth question and answer were pertinent, though a defect of memory pre\nvented any nearer suggestion of the right person.\u2014J. H. H.)\n15. Com. : Your experiments seem rather indefinite in character. I doubt\nwhether one can draw any scientific conclusions from them.\nRec. : Grannis.\n(The communicator explains that the question was intended to divert ine\nin the direction of the colleague in mind in question 9, as this colleague had\nremarked to me in presence of sender the sentiment here expressed. But\nthis incident was not suggested to me, though I thought of the colleague in\nthe mind of the communicator. But as I knew it was not his day to be at\nthe college and that it was improbable that he was present, I selected the\nnext probable person to make this remark, as I had remarked what I\nthought a little scepticism in him when present as an observer. \u2014J. H. H.)\n16. Com. : Do you still hold the same views regarding Hobhouse and\nSigwart that you did two years ago ?\nRec. : Grannie (!) or Stettheimer.\n(The communicator explains that he thought this question would suggest\neither Grannis, Marvin, or Jones, who had been students of mine in connec\ntion with this subject, but I could not recall that the first-named person was\nin the class at that time, and I knew the last was improbably the originator\nof the question because he was present in the room where the messages were\nbrought ; and the second-named person, though I thought of him, and he\nwas one of the very few that I could remember as having been in that class,\nI decided against, because he had a few minutes before come into the\nroom and left again. Hence I inferred the first name as pertinent to my\npresent class on the same subject, and doubtful in reference to the two\nyears before, and the second name as certainly a member of the earlier\nclass. I was therefore right in my thought of the three persons actually\nintended, but the circumstances mentioned prevented my decision from\nbeing what it might have been.\u2014J. H. H.)\n17. Com. : Marvin was misled.\nRec. Grannis.\n(This was intended to keep me on the person I named. It represents an\nincident in an earlier experiment, when the person named in the message\nwas misled in thinking that the person I here named was the communicator\nwhen he was not. The real communicator in the present case had been told\nit, and was not present when it occurred. He thus concealed himself while\nhe kept me on another tack than himself.\u2014J. H. H.)\n18. Com.: Did you not have a \"naive and enthusiastic\" student in\nEthics a year ago ?\nRec. : No definite suggestion, unless it is a ruse by Grannis in\nreference to practical ethics.\n(This was a perfectly definite question intended to suggest a certain\nstudent whom the phrase in quotation marks ought to have recalled, but not\n\fXLI.] C03\nAppendix IV.\ndoing this, I could only follow the preconception established by several\nprevious messages. If also it had reminded me of the person it was intended\nto suggest it would also have indicated the communicator quite probably, as\nI had had a few words with him a short time before on a matter connected\nwith the person in his mind. But here again memory failed and my precon\nception indicates an interesting source of error that would have been avoided\nby a better memory, and the circumstance mentioned would have had\ngreat evidential force.\u2014J. H. H.)\n19. Com. : Hays was a high churchman.\nRec. : Grannie, though Marvin could as well be identified with it.\n(My answer was given in these terms because I felt that it was extremely\nimprobable that Marvin should so soon after his experiments with me, when\nhe had sent this very message to me, repeat it in this way. Hence knowing\nthat in those experiments he had thought that Grannis was present at my\nend of the line, and that no one else but the intermediary in this set, Mr.\nMcW., knew it, I inferred that the incidents had been told Grannis, and\nguessed him on this ground. The communicator explains that Marvin\ncame in and suggested the message after telling the circumstances, and that\nhe sent it in order to keep me on the very person that I mentioned. My\nidentification was, therefore, correct though I reached it in the wrong way.\n\u2014J. H. H.)\n20. Com. : I heard you lecture on Hypnotism several years ago.\nRec. : No suggestion.\n(This is a mixture of true and false, as a diversion and transition to\nsomething more directly pertinent. I never delivered any such lecture as\nthis message suggested, but I lectured on, or rather discussed hypnotism in\nmy class, which the sender attended.\u2014J. H. H.)\n21. Com. : A year or so before you lectured on the History of Philosophy.\nRec. : Regularly or only on certain occasions 1 (Vf. p. 545.)\nCom. : Regularly.\n(I thought of a course which I give at Barnard College in this subject,\nand of Miss Stettheimer as the possible communicator, but I knew this was\nimpossible on reflection, and could only feel wholly Uncertain. I afterwards\nlearned that the communicator had an entirely different course in mind\nwhich I had forgotten for the moment, but which came to me just before\nthe receipt of the twenty-sixth message, as will be remarked there. It is\nworth saying, however, that even if I had recalled the right course, I had\nwholly forgotten the presence in the class of the person who turns out to be\nthe real communicator in the present experiment. The fact was, however,\nthat the real communicator was not a member of this course, and merely\nknew that I gave it and here used the fact as a diversion. \u2014J. H. H.)\n22. Com. : You later lectured on Space Perception.\nRec. : No suggestion save that it might be a lady in Barnard College,\nwho also heard me at Plainfield.\nCom. : Guess again.\n(The communicator explains that this was not a special incident or\nlecture, but simply refers to lectures in my general course, and was used\nmerely as a general reference to himself preparatory to better identifying\nincidents. To me it appeared to mean some specific lecture given to the\n\f604 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\npublic, and having forgotten completely that I had given a course in the\nHistory of Philosophy during the absence of the head of the department, I\nnaturally interpreted the message, especially from its mode of expression, to\nrefer to incidents which my reply makes apparent.\u2014J. H. H.)\n23. Com. : About three years ago I saw you in the lower part of the city.\nRec. : No suggestion.\n(A true incident between myself and sender, and refers, according to\nhis statement, to the same fact as Question 5. It is sufficiently vague and\nindefinite and is designed to test the point at which identification begins.\nThe next message has the same object, and only narrows the field slightly.\n\u2014J. H. H.)\n24. Com. : I think it was in the spring.\nRec. : No suggestion.\n25. Com. : I once attended a meeting of the S.P.R. at which you were\npresent.\nRec. : No suggestion.\n(True general incident, and not specific or specially important.)\n26. Coin. : When did you hear from G. P. last ?\nRec. : Marvin. Marvin is also the answer to Question 21.\n(This is an interesting question and answer. 1 at once supposed that\nthe \"G. P.\" referred to \"George Pelham,\" the personality referred to in\nthe last report of Dr. Hodgson, and as I had narrated to the person named\nin my answer the full details of my own sittings in which \" G. P.\" acted\nonce as amanuensis, and as he knew that I was carrying on the experiments\nwith Mrs. Piper through Dr. Hodgson, \u2014Dr. Jones, who was all the while in\nthe room with me, being the only other party that knew the fact,\u2014I at once\nfelt assured of the identity and so named the person above mentioned. I\nfelt that this was especially confirmed by the coincidence of this question\nwith messages 10, 11, and 12. But, as a matter of fact, the communicator\nexplains that the letters stood in his mind for an acquaintance of mine to\nwhom I had introduced him during the holidays at the meeting of the\nPsychological Association. Consequently, this is another illustration of\nmere chance in producing a cumulative case of coincidences in which the\npersonal identity imagined by me to be strongly indicated is illusory in its\nobjective interpretation, correct as it may be from my standpoint. But it\nin no way represents either the distributive or collective intention of the\ncommunicator as it does the cumulative suggestiveness for the receiver.\nThis conclusion by niysolf was also reinforced by the sudden recall to\nmemory of the fact at this time that I had given a course in the History of\nPhilosophy in Columbia, and that question 21 referred to this instead of to\nthe Barnard course, and as Dr. Marvin was a member of this course and\nalmost the only one that I could remember in it, and certainly the only one\nabout the institution, with probably the exception of Mr. McW., the inter\nmediary in the experiments, who could be a party to question 21, I at once\nsaw the pertinence of the question and in connection with this last message\nanswered with considerable confidence in the identification, especially as\nthis supposition coincided with the cumulative character of the messages\nalready mentioned.

My answer in any case was correct.\nBut my reason for it is such that the sending of the message by any\none else would have led to the same identification. There was probably no\nother student in the institution who could have given these symbols of the\npersonalties, Phinuit, Imperator, and Rector. Consequently he must have\nbeen suggested as the originator of the message, whether he were the\nimmediate sender or not.

There was, in\nfact, whatever the sender intended, less reason for my supposing Professor\nC. either as the sender or as the proper person meant than the one I guessed.\nI had not talked to any other person than the one I named for a year or\nmore about the man named in the message.\u2014J.

Com. : The baby said nothing.\nRec. : Franz quoting C .\n(This sentence was quoted from my message some time before to\nProfessor C. for my identification, and as Dr Franz was present with\nProfessor C. as my assistant, my memory made it certain that the person\nnamed in my answer was responsible for the question ; and it seems to have\noccasioned some surprise that my answer came as it did, since the statement\nwas intended to turn me to Professor C. Had I had the slightest reason\n\f606 [part\nJ. H.

But the whole mental situation made this impossible to me, and as\nI knew that no other person could know the incident referred to in the\nmessage except the sender, who had been my assistant when it was sent to\nProfessor C I had a clear case of identification with a very strong assur\nance, and one also that made any other of the persons that I had named in\nconnection with other messages impossible communicators of this message. \u2014\nJ.

I learned after the series\nwas completed that the message was one of McW.'s intended to divert me to\neither Marvin or himself. Hence both the intention and my identification\nwere correct.

The incidents were worked\nup on slips of paper and exhibited one at a time to the receiver, as if they\nhad been telegrams, and his judgment obtained with notes of his remarks\nby myself. In this case, however, I aimed at giving a suggestion of the\ncommunicator near the beginning, though first using some incidents that\nwould keep him out of mind, and help in sustaining a little ambiguity\nand incoherence. I obtained most of the incidents from tho father, and\nworked them up myself with some from my own recollection of his\nexperience, and shall indicate them before giving the account of the\nexperiment.\n\fXLI.] 609\nAppendix IV.\nThe material given me by the father consisted of the following incidents\nin the common life of himself and his son, intended to serve as means of\nidentification.\nHarrison Avenue, Springfield, Mass., was the street on which the office\nof the paper for which Mr. G. worked was situated. Union Street in same\ncity was the place of their residence. Rowing on the Connecticut River\nhere, Mrs. Aldrich and her kindergarten and daughter Gertrude, an old\nplaymate of the son when very young.\nRobert's Road, the street on which the family lived in Bryn Mawr.\nHannum, the name of the janitor in the Baptist Church there. \" Bob,\"\nthe name of an intimate acquaintance there.\n\"Lester,\" the name that the son was called by an acquaintance in New\nYork.\nJ. A. Bolles, the name of the editor of the New Milford Gazette, and\ncalled \" Ja. Ja.\" by the son.\nMillard Morgan, the name of an intimate friend of the son.\nFrank E., name of a relative with the same initials as the father, and\nalways called simply \"Frank E.\" Van Deusenville, the name of a village\nnear where \"Frank E.\" lived, and Ives Place, the name of a part of the\nestate belonging to the family. Used to go to picnics here.\nCharlio, the name of Professor G.'s brother, as he was always called.\nMonument Mills, the name of some mills in Housatonic ; Bob Mack, the\nname of an intimate acquaintance there ; band concerts attended by father\nand son on bicycles ; Rev. Charles A. Mallory, the pastor there.\nThe incidents which I added on my own account wore those in reference\nto J. R. G. ; those about the murderer, his trial, capital punishment, the\ninterview, of which I had been told by Professor G. some years ago, they\nbeing experiences common to him and myself, and I supposed probably to\nhis son, as events proved was true. Also the terms \"anthropogenic\" and\n\"consciousness of kind.\" I also added those about Philadelphia and the\npublic discussion, for the sake of running the identification down to a\ncertainty.\nThe incidents will be found to have been worked up with much inco-\nherency and confusion of dates and places. Events that happened at\ndifferent places are sometimes mentioned in connection with the same place.\nThe reason for this will be apparent to all who are familiar with the Piper\nphenomena, although I have very much exaggerated this incoherence. My\nwish was to see how far the receiver would separate the incidents and\nyet stand by the identification of his father, if he supposed him to be\nthe author of the statements.\nCommunicator : Professor G . Receiver : Mr. G., his son.\n1. Do you remember where we used to live when my work kept me so\nbusy 1 You were a little lad. It was long ago, and in the east, I think. I\noften think of it, and wonder whether you delighted in it as much as I did.\nDo you remember the man out west with my name, J. R. G. ? He must\nhave been a relative. Don't you remember our talk about him at\nM . . If . . . . d? I can't get all of it, before we siw him in Ohio. This\nwas on U .... on S t.\n2 R\n\fGIO [part\nH. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nMr. G. : That J. It. G. is Joshua R. Giddings.\n(This recognition was correct, and there was apparently nothing but the\ninitials and the reference to Ohio to indicate it. But afterward Mr. G. told\nme that he had recently been reading his life and that he was a distant\nrelative. The places abbreviated were not recognised.\u2014J. H. H.)\n2. I am going to see you when I can. You ought to remember me well\nenough. I was opposed to slavery. J . . sh . . a R. G . . d . . . . ng . . It\nis hard to get. If I remember rightly I was in what you call Congress.\nWe had exciting times about '61. You knew Mrs. Aldrich. What nice\nthings she used to do for you when you were so young, knee high to a duck,\nwhile I was making speeches in the campaign.\nMr. G. : (Here the name was again recognised, and the statement\nmade that he was opposed to slavery. Then :) I did know a Mrs. Aldrich\nin Springfield, Mass. She had a sort of kindergarten.\n3. My special science was not yet much known, though many may think it\nought to have been. But you would not have understood it then. We had\nnot gotten out of the woods then. Well, things have changed. Do you\nremember Gertrude ? Was there anybody by that name 1 I think I know\nher. Or was it Girtie, Guthrie, or something like that ? That was a big\ncity then. She was a little girl when I went to interview a man who was to\nbe hung for murder. If I remember rightly it was in a town where there\nwas a college and not far from where we lived. Afterward we moved. I\nmust have told you about capital punishment.\nMr. G. : I remember Gertrude, Mrs. Aldrich's daughter.\n4. I often think of the place and the work. That brute made me less\nsentimental. He might have been anthropogenic, but he tried my patience\nand that was great. Seventeen miles away I could have been at home.\nBoston may be a good place, but it has fewer memories than the town on\nthe river and the college where the girls were. The boys were not far off.\nDo you recall President Sharp ? No, Sharkey ... Is that it ? Will\ncome again.\nMr. G. : That is President Sharpless. I know his son. They were at\nHaverford near Bryn Mawr where we lived. \" Anthropogenic \" sounds like\nfather. It is his word. I have heard him talk about capital punishment.\n(Allusion to \"special science\" in previous question. I intended President\nSharpless by \" President Sharp \" and following words.\u2014J. H. H.)\n5. Your father would be glad to see you doing well at your work. Do\nyou still make shoes at that mill by the monuments ? Brother lived there\ntoo. The kindergarten was a fine place, wasn't it ? Wasn't Gertrude there \/\nDo you remember the tall houses, sky-scrapers, as we used to call them\nwhere we lived ? Things have changed. This is a strange world here. No\nnewspapers to write.\nMr. G. : Father was a newspaper man. I don't remember the mill by\nthe monuments. There is the kindergarten again. The sky-scrapers I know\nonly in New York.\n(The relevance of Gertrude was also recognised again.\u2014 J. H. H.)\n6. Wait a minute. I am forgetting. Oh ! yes, the river we used to row\non. Slavery ... I am wandering. My mind runs on this subject\nstill. I wrote on all kinds of subjects and had many interviews. And I\n\fXLI.] 611\nAppendix IV.\nhad to go about very much. You remember we went down to the river to\nrow together. There was a dam across it further up where there were so\nmany paper mills. Sharpless ! That's it. He was only a short distance\nfrom us.\nMr. G. : These were the paper mills on the Housatonic, where we go in\nthe summer. 1 was born there.\n(These were not the mills that I had in mind when I wrote the incidents\ndown. I had those at Holyoke, Mass., in mind, which were near Spriugfield.\n\u2014J. H. H.)\n7. Do you recall that murderer whose crime and trial after ten years\nmade so much noise about the country ? He was tried where there was a\ngirls' college, not far from home. I went to interview him before he was\nhung. The paper was to publish what he was to say. But I got tired of\nthis work and went to the kind of work that I like, and helped the girls to\nlearn. It was as good as Mrs. Aldrich's school. But it was not a kinder\ngarten.\nMr. G. : I don't remember this murder trial. The incidents would tit\nmy father. He did go to interview a murderer.\n8. Do you remember that trip to Europe ? Those porpoises. They were\nfine. Most of it has gone. But I forgot the Baptist Church. Was it\nSpurgeon or Hannum that preached ? This was in January. Is that right !\nNo. I am thinking of the janitor. It was the parsonage in which we lived.\nWhat a lovely city. They called it . . near the place . . . love.\nQueer name. Did you ever read the 23rd Psalm ?\nMr. G. : Father went to Europe and I remember that he talked about the\nporpoises. Hannum is right. He was the janitor at the church in Bryn\nMawr. We lived in the parsonage. [Reference to porpoises mine.\u2014J. H. H.]\n9. You were a little fellow when you came to the office. Do you recall\nyour first pair of trousers ? Was it on Han . . . What's that ? Hasson\nshu . . . ave. Let me see. Wait until I am clear. Oh! close to home.\nH A R . . . N A . . . E N U . . . in a field. I am going,\nwill try again.\nMr. G. : I did often go to father's office in Springfield, Mass. This looks\nlike Harrison Avenue. But I don't remember the place.\n(The word \" field \" was puzzling for a moment, but in a flash Mr. G. saw\nthat it was intended for the name of the town, which was correct, namely,\nSpringfield.\u2014J. H. H.)\n10. How good a thing it is and well\nFor brethren in unity to dwell.\nThat's the name of the town near where we lived. This was afterward.\nWhere was it ? You remember the girls' school, where we made brain, not\nbrawn. Some of it sounds like this : Robert ! Who is Robert ? Oh !\nRobert's . . . What's the rest ? Is it Road ? Yes, yes. Was this in\nMass. ?\nMr. G. : This is Robert's Road, where we lived in Bryn Mawr. Oh ! that\nmeans Philadelphia, only ten miles from Bryn Mawr.\n(Here Mr. G. put together this and the eighth question and with the\nmanner of an interesting discovery and assured belief mentioned the name\nof Philadelphia, which was correct.\u2014J. H. H.)\n2 h 2\n\f612 [part\nH. Byslop, Ph.D.\n[Short Beach, Conn., Avgiut 2nd, 1899.\nI learned incidentally a day or two ago of an interesting mistake made\nby myself in this allusion to the 23rd Psalm. The mistake is precisely like\nthose so often made by communicators in the Piper sittings. I had intended\nthe reader to suppose from my quotation about brethren living in unity that\nI was quoting the 23rd Psalm mentioned in a previous question. Now, a\nfew days ago, I had occasion to mention the same sentence : \"How good\na thing it is for brethren in unity to dwell,\" and referred it to the 23rd\nPsalm, as usual, and as in Question 8. But I was laughed at by my wife and\na friend with her. I insisted and felt quite confident that I was right, but\nthey were not to be convinced, and reasserted that I was in error. But I\nwould not yield until I took a concordance and found the passage in the\nfirst verse of the 183rd Psalm. 1 shall certainly have to be charitable to\n\"spirits\" when they commit similar mistakes, especially when we recall\nthe fact that the 23rd Psalm was a favourite one in the family, very ofteu\nsung at family worship, and more often recited on Sundays, while the\n133rd was very often mentioned and recited as a moral lesson to children\nwho frequently had their differences that the sentiment in this Psalm was\nintended to prevent.\u2014J. H. H.] (Gf. pp. 228 231.)\n11. You used often when small to come to the office. 1 saw you there,\nand I think mother will recall it. Do you 1 H . . R . . . . SON . . V . .\nNUE. Wasn't Gertrude there ? Where is \" Bob \" ? He is a good fellow.\nI know how you like him. Where is that street ? A man in your class has\nthe name of it.\nMr. G. : That must be Harrison Avenue, because there is a man by that\nname in my class, but I don't remember it. I know \" Bob \" well.\n12. Is it that Baptist sexton ? Sounds like Mark Hanna. Is that\nright ? He lived in the same town as . Thomas, who was very\nbright. I knew it. You knew \" Bob \" there, I remember. We did better\nafterwards, and I had more time to write. I must get that name. It . . .\nThomas. Can't get it right. There was a . Rhodes there, too.\nHe died, and . . .

Oh, yes ; it might be Miss Thomas, the Dean at Bryn Mawr.\n(The reference to the Baptist sexton was correctly interpreted as an\nallusion to \"Hannum.\"\u2014J. H. H.)\n13. Do you remember who called you Lester? Where is that gazette our\nboarder worked for ? Was it on Union-street ? Ja. Ja. . . . I don't\nhear. Bones . . . Bowl . . . What's that ? Sounds like Bonus.\nDon't you remember Ja ? I knew him and mother. That ought to prove\nwho your father is. And somebody else, too.\nMr. G. : When we came to New York, there was a fellow who always\ncalled me \"Lester,\" without any reason that I could give, as that was not\nmy name. That \"Ja. Ja. \" refers to John A. Bolles. I used to call an\nimaginary being \" Ja. Ja.\" in my play, and I called Mr. Bolles this because\nof his initials, \" J. A.\" We did live on Union-street, Springfield.\n14. Where is that book I wrote ? I am thinking of it. Where is brother\nCharlie now ? Oh ! those mills. It was not at Milford. Do you remember\n\fXLI.] 613\nAppendix IV.\nthe band concerts ? We had to have bicycles then. Was Frank E. at any of\nthose farm picnics ? Was that the name ? Sounds like a baker's dozen.\nMr. G. : Charlie was my father's brother. This might be written of last\nsummer. All of it is as if it were from my father. Frank E. is a distant\ncousin of mine by the name of G . He was a farmer there.\n(Mr. G. here referred to all the past questions with the remark that the\nwhole of them would fit his father, except those alluding to J. R. G. This\nwas correct, as I had used that name for diversion. \" Baker's dozen \" a bad\npun for Van Deusenville.\u2014J. H. H.)\n15. I forget a good many things. Only a few come back. But I\nremember Ives Place and Millard Morgan. Now I am thinking of that place\nwhere the girls went to school. Was it Smith College ? This was near the\nConnecticut River where we used to row together. Those were fine times.\nNo, it wasn't there I taught the girls. What's that ? Are you saying\nanything about a kind of consciousness 1 He says ... of kind.\nMr. G. : I know Ives Place, but I cannot recall where it is. I know\nMillard Morgan well. He was in college last year. I have rowed on the\nConnecticut. We lived one summer in Northampton. That phrase \" kind\nof consciousness \" if turned around is a pet phrase of father's. Yes, there\nit is in the next sentence (Cf. pp. 544-646.)\n16. How's a tonic in mass ! Sounds like this. Did you say mass ? Who's\nsoul I Wait a minute. Tell Charlie he will be glad to know I am still living.\nWhere is Bob Mack ' That's the one I think. It is hard to speak in these\nconditions. Some one is saying Milford Gazette. Ja. Ja. He can't stay.\nMr. G. : \"How's a tonic,\" that's Housatonic, the name of the place\nwhere we lived. Bob Mack is a man in this place. He was a friend of father\nand of his brother Charlie.\n(The recognition of J. A. Bolles was made again and his connection with\nthe gazette mentioned, and the town corrected to New Milford. \u2014J. H. H.)\n17. What did I say about the college ? I forget the name of it just now.\nIt has large columns in it, and I said much about consciousness in it. There\nare girls there too.

Who says Bryn Mawr and Rhode . . What's the road i I\nam muddled a little. The newspaper office was at the first place. Do you\nremember the curve in the railway track near the bridge over the river !\nWe moved to this new place. Oh, yes ! that's Hannum I was trying to think\nof a little while ago. I told you so.

Hyslop, Ph.D.\n(I had intended this curve to refer to the one in Springfield, Mass. All\nthe other incidents were correctly indicated and recognised.\u2014J. H. H.)\n19. Do you remember my book ? I liked social problems. But they\nforced me to cross swords with Carl Schurz. There was another man too.\nWhat was his name ? His people used to live in Judaea. He is a kind of\npreacher. This all comes of studying society. Was Van .... Van Dew . . .\nVan sen. Van Deussen there i The newspapers talked about it.\nThis makes me think of Harrison Ave. Mother will remember that, and\nyou too.\nMr. G. : That's father, I know. Were you at that discussion ? The\nother man was F A .\n20. I said Housatonic. That has nothing to do with saying mass, unless\nyou live there. Do you remember any picnics ? After all, teaching boys and\ngirls is better than farming, though it is fine work for a summer vacation.\nMr. (Ji. : Yes, I have been at lots of picnics. That's father, I know, we\nspent the summers there. All of it applies to him.\nThere are a number of matters of interest in the results of this\nexperiment. The first one to be noted is that which is characteristic\nof the whole series,\u2014the trivial nature of the incidents chosen for the\npurpose of identification. In the case of Professor G., it is especially\ninteresting to remark that the feature that perhaps ought to have been\nchosen\u2014on the supposition that men would choose what is uppermost\nand most important in their minds\u2014was not suggested to his mind\nat all. What bears upon that was selected by myself, namelv, the\nevidential terms and incidents in connection with the author's writings.\nThese are represented in the words \"anthropogenic\" and \"conscious\nness of kind.\" All the facts chosen by the communicator were of the\nunimportant kind that are objected to in the Piper phenomena.\nIt was a matter of much surprise to me that, the receiver inferred\nso quickly the name for which J. R. G. stood. His remark afterwards\nsufficiently explained that, however. But it was what I wanted to have\ncome in the second question, as a means of diversion from the immediate\nsuggestion of his father, who was nevertheless represented in the more\ngeneral statements about the place of living. The preconception thus\nestablished did its work in forcing Mr. G. to interpret the incidents\nwith reference to their identity and relation in time and place. He\nmade no mistake in this where any spontaneous mention was made,\nin spite of the incoherences involved, liven the slightest incidents\nin a setting of the most remote connection, did not fail to be observed\nand properly placed. All the names of persons were correctly recog\nnised and located, and the same is true of places, with the exception\nat first of some which were not fully spelt out and whose form did not\nat once suggest their purpose, the receiver not being familiar with the\nPiper reports in this respect.\n\fXLI.] 615\nAppendix IV.\nThere was no expressed suspicion that the communicator was his\nfather until we came to the third question, and here the term \" anthro\npogenic \" was seized at once and with assurance that the father was\nconnected with the experiment. This was not only true, but I\ndeliberately chose the term and threw it in here with a mass of very\ngeneral incidents of little suggestive power, in order to see whether it\nwould appear as evidential, or even suggestive at all, The success was\nvery striking, and I may say that the evidential nature of it is apparent\nfrom the fact that the term is not a common one with writers generally,\nbut a technical word often used in the father's book. It was. the\nrecognition that the term was one of his father's peculiar words, and\nthe unlikeliness of any one else using it that stamped the receiver's\nconviction with some assurance, and tended to break up the precon\nception established by the first identification. I did not expect so\nready an identification of President Sharpless. But this success at\nonce suggested Bryn Mawr and then at once the false implication\nthat the river referred to was at that place, which was the discrepancy\nintended. The receiver also recognised the refeience of the first sen\ntence in this fourth question to the last sentence in the previous\nquestion, referring to the murderer indicated.\nThere were two errors of judgment as viewed from the stand\npoint of the communicator. They were, first, the identification of\nthe dam and paper mills alluded to as chose on the Housatonic, when\nthose at Holyoke on the Connecticut were intended, and the suggestion\nof the railway curve at Van Deusenville when that at Springfield was\nintended. They indicate that what may be supposed to be specific and\npeculiar may in reality often be common enough to lack all evidential\nforce whatsoever.\nNot less interesting was the identification of the city of Phila\ndelphia from the vaguest metaphorical allusion to it. From its\nQuaker origin it has been called \" the city of brotherly love,\" and in\nquestion 8, I had suggested it in too vague a way to secure a guess, but\nin question 10 the quotation from the 133rd Psalm and the idea\nexpressed by it suggested the right city with a startled expression of\ndiscovery. In this latter question the error of putting the town\nsuggested by \" Robert's Road,\" in Massachusetts, was at once noted,\nthough this may be considered quite easy, in spite of some incoherence\nof statement.\nThe failure to remember Harrison Avenue was very interesting,\nbecause the father had felt perfectly assured that this would be\nremembered. The quick identification of Mr. Bolles was also striking,\nbecause the suggestion was slight.\nWhen we came to question 14, the receiver became tolerably assured\nthat the messages were from his father, and spontaneously remarked\n\f616 [part\nJ. H. Eyslop, Ph.D.\nthe cumulative nature of the evidence, now observing that much\nwhich previously had not suggested his father was meant to do so.\nAnd in the fifteenth question the recognition of \" consciousness of\nkind \" from a distorted suggestion of it was quick and sagacious, it\nbeing in this situation intended as a remote suggestion, and for this\npurpose readily seen. It very much strengthened Mr. G.'s feeling that\nhe was dealing with his father's massages.\nBut it was very strange that Ives Place was not at once recognised,\nbut wholly forgotten. This was another instance of a place that the\nfather supposed would be recognised immediately and without fail.\nBut it was only near the close of the experiment that it came to the\nreceiver's memory, and then only in connection with the name of a\nplace near it. That this part of the estate should be so readily\nforgotten, and other minor incidents recalled with so little effort, only\nillustrates the misunderstandings that may easily occur in all such\nattempts at identification. The last two incidents, however, were\neffective in securing assurance beyond the possibility of cavil and\ndoubt, as they were intended to do. The allusion to Mr. F\nA in the way it was made was remarked as evidence of the\ncorrectness of the inference. I had referred to Juda?a as if failing to\nrecall the name of the race to which Mr. A. belonged. This was\nremarked as evidence that the name suggested by the occasion referred\nto was correct, and that the incident must come from his father, or\nbe meant to identify him with the experiment.\nNote A.\u2014Addendum.\nGROUP C \u2014II.\nNew York, December 9th, 1899.\nCommunicator : Miss M. Receiver : Miss B. (December 5th, 1899.)\nInasmuch as the area of guessing was limited, as remarked, to a narrow\ntield in my other experiments, I resolved to try a case in which no such\nlimitations could exist. The receivers in all the others could safely act on\nthe assumption that the communicator was most likely connected with the\ncollege, and thus it would be supposed that the correct identification would\nbe easier. In the present experiment this objection is eliminated. The\ncommunicator was a lady in this city and the receiver one hundred and fifty\nmiles from this place. It was conducted in the same manner as Experiment I.,\nGroup C. The results show that the identification was not interfered with\non this account, though the tendency of the receiver to limit her guessing at\nfirst to the locality in which she lived justifies the suspicion which one must\nnaturally entertain against guessing under the circumstances described in\n\fXLL] 617\nAppendix IV.\nmy experiments. But objection of this sort is much weakened by the fact\nthat in this last experiment it was the intention of the communicator to\nsuggest the persons actually guessed by the receiver in her own locality.\nThe most interesting incident in the experiment was the correct answer\nto Question 7, and the spontaneous reconstruction of the facts in the\nmind of the sender with the cumulative inductive reasoning based upon the\nprevious messages. The process at once broke up the previous precon\nceptions and established a new apperception mass which made many\nof the subsequent messages superfluous. The reader can determine for\nhimself the interesting and instructive character of the guess, together with\nthe later confirmations of it. The name Ross had no more special connec\ntion with this ride than with hundreds of other experiences with the same\nperson in the same town. All the other guesses are but illustrations of the\ngeneral nature and purport of these experiments.\nThe experiments in group B, and also messages leading to incidental\nidentification, show how easy it is to personate the identity of others\nthan the communicator, though this process is largely limited to such\nidentification .is can be indicated by mere incidents rather than distinctive per\nsonal traits and is likely to develop traces of the identity of the real communi\ncator. In experiment I, group B, I successfully personated two different\npersons merely by indicating facts which pertained to their identity and not\nmine. It would not be so easy to reproduce the little tricks of language and\nphrase of another, or various aspects of character difficult of imitation except\nafter long acquaintance ; nor would it be easy to reproduce the psychological\ntraits of another, though perhaps possible under favourable circumstances.\nThe complex incidents representing the unity of consciousness in the iden\ntity or personality of the Piper communicators are more natural to a real\nsurviving person than to some one trying to personate them, and it is only\na most intimate acquaintance or an amanuensis that can come near to repro\nducing phenomena of this sort. But from my personation of two persons to\nthe extent of convincing the receiver that they were actually present (p.\n596) we can understand the part played by Phinuit in the Piper case, or\nhy any \"control.\" Nor is it any objection that such personation is possible,\nas it is apparent in the experiments that the communicator must know the\nfacts and the person they represent sufficiently to make the personation suc\ncessful. This will be true on any theory of the matter, and in cases where\nwe have to suppose telepathy in opposition to spiritism to account for the\nacquisition of the facts, the only question that can be raised is whether the\ntelepathy can be adequately selective for the purpose.\nThe same secrecy was maintained as in previous experiments, and I also\narranged it so that it was not known that it was I who was conducting the\nexperiment. I prepared the questions after securing the incidents from Miss\nM., and sent them to a friend who understood the object of the experiment,\nand he conducted it as if it were his own. The results are precisely like the\nothers. I alter names in all cases calculated to discover identity. In making up\nmy \"messages\" I endeavoured to imitate the confusion of the Piper pheno\nmena, and so did not try to keep incidents independent of each other, as a\ncomparison of the \" messages \" with the incidents out of which I constructed\nthem will make apparent. The following are the incidents, obtained from\n\f61.S [P4RT\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nMiss M., and upon which I proceeded. In the construction of the case I\nwent from the more general to the more specific, in order, as before, to study\nthe point where identification began.\nA walk on Pine-street (very common with all students). Miss B. telling\nMiss M.'s hand in Mrs. Jones' parlor with Miss M.'s sister present. Miss\nM.'s difficulties in gymnastic exercises, especially with the backward bend.\nDrinking Russian tea with Miss C. in the spring at Miss Park's. Meeting\nMr. Huskins on a certain Sunday in Miss C.'s room. Taking the picture of\nMiss 0. and Virginia Vales, near the Putnam House under a lilac bush.\nThe runaway on Holyoke mountain. Miss Judson and Miss C.'s sister in a\nbuggy in front of the running horse; Miss C, Miss M. , and Miss M.'s\nsister in the runaway buggy- A call by Miss M. on Miss C. just before\ntaking the picture mentioned, and asked by Miss C. where she was going to\nspend the summer. A talk with Miss C. by Miss M. about basket ball,\nMiss C. making the rules for it, and a request for Miss M. to write an article\nabout gymnastics for one of the leading periodicals. The party in the run\naway had gathered some columbines, and when the runaway began Miss M.\ncautiously put them down on the Boor of the buggy and helped her sister\nhold the reins.\nIncident of Miss C. telling Miss M. about her life in Boston, and her\nstudies and physical training there. Read Betty Parr's poems to Miss\nM.'s sister, and showed the day's order to the sister. Miss M., Miss C,\nand Miss M.'s sister together put out of a certain place on the night\nof the promenade and after eleven o'clock. Listening to a talk on self-\nsacrifice a year ago after the promenade. Miss M. present, when Miss C.\nreceived some photographs from her brother. A long wait to shake hands\nwith the president after the reception of last June.\nThese incidents were worked up into the following \" messages,\" with as\nmuch confusion and mistake as the necessities of the case required. The\nremarks of the receiver were noted by my friend, and are embodied in the\naccount as in the other experiments. I have only to observe that Miss B.\nwas told only that the guessing \"was an experiment in the psychology of\nguessing, having a bearing on the subject of mediumistic communication,\nand that the incidents had been furnished by a friend. Further than that\nshe was told nothing till the experiment was over.\"\n1. Com. : Do you remember our walk together ? It was down towards\nthe river. What was the street ? Oh, yes, Pine-street.

She had\nnaturally a better memory of where she had prosecuted her studies than the\nincidents of drinking tea on a certain occasion. It is also interesting as\nshowing that the communicator cannot expect everybody to remember as\ndistinctly the incidents by which he would identify himself. The incident\nin this message was far more specitic than the remark about the \"studies\nin Bo . . . . ; \" but in spite of this it had evidently little suggestive\npower.\u2014J. H. H.]\n7.

What\n\f\u20ac20 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\n\" message,\" and the others somewhat as a foil against too great confidence\nat this stage Any one of them might have sent the \"message,\" and the\nonly clue to Miss M. was the first person of the pronoun, and even that was\nhidden in an equivocal and broken sentence, so that it might be taken as\ndenoting the care of the sister in holding the reins rather than Miss M.'s\ncare in putting down the columbines. But the extremely indefinite nature\nof the \"message,\" with hardly even a fair hint of the ride intended, makes\nthe constructive interpretation one of the most remarkable things we can\nimagine, considering the disposition of some of us to attribute the liability\nto illusion in far more specific and definite incidents in the Piper case. The\nsudden inclination, as if by inspiration, to study the previous questions for\ncumulative evidence, and the correct judgment regarding their pertinence\nfor Miss M., are most interesting as illustrating how slight the clue may be\nfor correct identification, and how correct the \"sitter\" may be in con\nstructing the true meaning of the communicator out of the most broken\nand confusing messages. The facts are these. The party had gathered\nsome columbines for Miss Ross on Mt. Holyoke, and on the way home the\nrunaway occurred. Miss M. carefully laid the flowers down in the buggy\nand took hold of the lines or reins to help her sister check the running\nhorse. Miss Judson and Miss C.'s sister were in the carriage ahead, and\nMiss C. had all her solicitude for Miss Ross. How little of this is told in\nthe \"message\" is very apparent. It is also the first \"message\" in which\nthe slightest allusion to it occurs. The correct interpretation and construc\ntion of it, therefore, becomes little less than amazing, and added to this is\nthe very slight clue to the name Alice given in \" message \" 4. The experi\nment might have been stopped at this point but for the fact that, although\nthe guess was right both in regard to person and incidents intended, I had\nshaped the situation so that there was no proof that Miss M. was the only\nperson who, in spite of the first person of the pronoun, might have sent the\n\"messages.\"\u2014J.

Hyslop, Ph.D.\nAPPENDIX V.\nEXPERIMENTS IN COMMUNICATIOn.\nThe allusions by some of the \" communicators \" in the Piper\nexperiments and their difficulties in giving proper names, suggested to\nme the propriety of instituting certain experiments more or less in\nimitation of these imaginary conditions to see whether the result would\nin any way confirm our conception of the case. I had in view, of\ncourse, the illustration of other points at the same time, namely,\nphonetic errors which might grow out of resemblances in sounds of\ndifferent words with different apperception points, or the existence of\nnone at all in the receiver. Hence, I undertook to try communication\nof certain messages through a speaking tube from my kitchen to my\nlibrary, containing frequent use of proper names and words singly\nor combined that resembled in sound words with very different mean\nings. I shall comment on the vesults after giving them. But I had\nfirst to test for the conditions that would insure some indistinctness in\nthe communications. Hence, I placed my subject, an assistant in my\nwork, at the end of the tube in the library, and at such a distance from\nit as made talking into it not very clear. I tried at first six inches\ndistance, while I held my mouth while speaking about four or six inches\nfrom the other end which was not more than ten feet distant, though\nseparated from the receiver by the floor. The two bends in the tube,\nitself about an inch in diameter, were the only obstacles to the trans\nmission of the sound. But I soon found that the receiver was too near\nthe tube, and my voice too loud to make the necessary indistinctness\nin the case. I altered these conditions until there was difficulty in\nhearing the sounds or words. The receiver held his ear about eighteen\ninches from the tube, I, my mouth about six inches from the other end,\nand I spoke in an ordinary conversational tone, though very slowly,\nand with as clear articulation as possible, the object being in speaking\nslowly to permit the receiver to take down the words as they were\nuttered. When I had secured the conditions for indistinctness I began\nthe experiments whose results were as follows. I have arranged the\npassages that I read or spoke in one column, and the same as received\nin another, so as to facilitate comparison. They will almost speak for\nthemselves, and anyone familiar with the Piper phenomena will\ndiscover at once the resemblances to them in these results.\nWe require, however, to be cautious about mistaking the nature\nof these experiments. They do not prove the facts which they\n\fAppendix V. 625\nillustrate. We do not know that the conditions of spirit communi\ncation, if such exist, have any resemblance to those which I have\ndescribed in these experiments. At the utmost these results only\nillustrate the case from the standpoint of the narrators' statements\nregarding the analogies between communication from a transcendental\nworld, and the same under conditions that we know. Hence, it must\nnot be supposed that I am proving anything in favour of either spirit\ncommunication in general, or the difficulties of it in particular. All\nthat I can be supposed to have done is to have suggested a field for\na very large system of experiments to establish the relation between\nthe communication of familiar and unfamiliar sounds under the\nconditions indicated, and the difficulty of getting proper names in like\nconditions. The experiments can be varied in a thousand ways, and\nmany points in apperception illustrated and determined. In so far as\nthey bear upon the Piper case, my results can be taken for mere illus\ntrations of what may be natural in accepting the analogies which the\ncommunicators indicate between the conditions under which they\ncommunicate, and those which the language suggests. The confirma\ntion of the peculiarities of the Piper phenomena does not carry with it\nany evidence of either their genuineness or their significance, but only\nsuggests the limits of our knowledge in the case, while it intimates\nwhat may be true if we could only ascertain the nature of the alleged\ncommunications, and the conditions under which they occur. This may\nbe the case on any theory whatsoever, and I do not care to limit the\npossibilities to the spirit theory alone, though I suspect that we should\nmost naturally conceive their superior pertinence to that hypothesis as\ncompared with the telepathic.\nCommunicator.\n1.

The subject explained, before I had the opportunity to\nexpress my surprise, that he recognised this promptly because he knew\na friend by this name. I had used the expression \" windlass horse \"\npurposely to suggest \" windless house,\" \" didn't \" to see if the \" not \"\nwould hf omitted, and \"climb at\" to suggest with what followed, the\nword \"climate.\" But too little was caught to create even an illusion.\nThe third case shows the interesting failure to get the proper\nname, though repeated here in several forms as attempt to get the last\nform. But the words obtained show that a person was clearly in mind,\nbut nothing comes to give evidence of identity. The mistake of \" con\nnection \" for \"election\" is interesting. But the whole is meaningless.\nIn the fourth case, both proper names are failures. The second name\nI intended to suggest Edward, if it was not gotten itself. The fifth\nexplains itself with the interesting mistake of \" Carnegie \" for\n\" Kerneguy.\" It appears also that the word \" thought\" is interpreted\nas \" but.\" It is impossible to tell what suggested the word \" argument.\"\nThe sixth case also requires no comments except to remark that no\nproper names are received, and the word \" turnips \" is a funny mistake\nevidently for \"gauntlets.\"\nThe last instance is, perhaps, the most interesting, as the confusion\nis more sustained, and the mistakes more striking. Here, we have\n\"change\" for \"strange,\" \"troubles\" for \"struggles,\" \"improvise\"\nfor \" multiplied,\" and \" prythee \" for \" brother,\" and also \" come here \"\nfor \" Cockaine.\" Not a single proper name is obtained. If \" Cook \"\nhad been capitalised, it would have been conceived by the receiver as\na proper name, but such a conception was not suspected, while it only\napproximates in sound the real name. Not a particle of the thought\nis obtained.\nHow far the results represent greater facility in getting the words\nhaving the most familiar sound and the most frequently used, this\nsingle experiment cannot determine. We should probably forecast what\nwould be the case from what we already know in psychology, and might\nnot require experimental evidence to support it. But the facts as fat-\nas they go sustain the position that proper names are more difficult to\ncommunicate, and that familiar words of a simple sort are obtained\nmost easily.\nSecond Experiment.\nCommunicator.

The experiments were\nconducted precisely as before. The mistakes generally speak for them\nselves. They easily indicate what illusions the sitter may act under\nwhen he takes definite communications of addresses for guidance.\nIt was interesting to note that the receiver did not get Broadway,\n\fXu] 03 1\nAppendix V.\nbut did get Williamsburg, as the former is the more familiar of the two.\nBut even more familiar sounds than this are unperceived in this case.\nThe mistake of \" College Place \" for \" Ormond Place \" was interesting,\nas possibly a subliminal association of the name Berkeley in the\nprevious sentence, and not heard supraliminally. But the most mis\nleading error up to this point is \"Second St.\" for \"Sackett St.,\" also\n\" New \" for \" Ewen \" is interesting.\nThe second instance was chosen for proper names, and the apper\nception mass which they are calculated to excite, and hence, we should\nexpect, when the receiver is familiar with the works of the author, that\nhe should more easily recognise the sounds connected with the name\nalready recognised, and also that the opposite would take place when\nhe did not know the names of authors and their works. These\nsuppositions were borne out in the results, which speak for themselves\nvery largely. Kingsley, Church, Lanier and Cheney would have failed\nto have identified themselves in these messages. Hawethorne's message\nwas perfect. Spofford did not get his name, and would have depended\nwholly upon the title of his book for recognition, which would have\nbeen a poor test. The mistake of \" Mrs. Chubb \" for \" Mrs. Child \" is\nvery interesting for its actual approximation to the right name, but\nalso for the difference which it exhibits to the eye. The name of\n\" Newman \" for \" Robert E. Lee \" is a remarkable error, and hardly\nconceivable. What a judgment it would suggest if a spirit made this\nmistake !\nThe third passage for communication was chosen because the\nreceiver was known to be perfectly familiar with it. It was not long\nuntil it was recognised, and the fact stated, so that it was unnecessary\nto go farther. But the crucial word at the beginning was not gotten,\nand only when the proper name was obtained did the clue appear for\nthe rest. The next, the fourth case, is especially interesting as illus\ntrating the entire failure to obtain any conception whatever of the\nmessage intended. \"Murder\" for \"weather,\" send\" for \"play,\"\n\"old\" for \"role,\" and \"regicide\" for \"reconciler,\" and the complete\nomission of the proper names makes the whole passage unintelligible.\nIn the fifth, the receiver's habit of associating Japan with China,\nis the explanation of the mistake of this name for glass. Unfamiliar\nwords are missed, and the confusion of others is almost inexplicable.\n'Interest\" for \"victories,\" \"menaces\" for \"magnetism,\" \"irritating \"\nfor \" iridescent,\" and \" idle \" probably for Italian, are striking and\nwholly unexpected errors. The last part of the message also is inter\nesting because it shows unfamiliar words, and a corresponding failure\nin communication. On the whole, however, the passage as received\nhas too little resemblance to the original to indicate any intelligi\nbility in it.\n\f032 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nThe German passage I gave in order to see whether it made any\ndifference in the communications before the receiver was told of the\nintention to test him in this way. He reported that at first, he thought\nI was giving him Arabic. But the moment that he got \" sind schwer,\"\nhe recognised that what he had taken for Arabic was German, but the\npassage, which was taken out of Kant's Critique, was not received fully\nenough to indicate its identity.\nThe next, and seventh instance, was chosen also for the familiarity\nof it to the receiver. He discovered its identity in spite of its frag\nmentary character and the mistakes. These last seem unaccountable\nin several instances. \" Physic \" for \" system,\" \" spinal \" for \" lines, ' and\n\" cords :' for \" for \" are striking errors. \" Perception \" for \" reception \"\nwas a natural mistake to make under the circumstances which rather\nfavoured this apperception of the sound. The next is also wholly\nunintelligible owing to the mistakes. \"Sufficient conservation\" for\n\" special facination \" is a singular error, but \" motion \" for \" emotion \"\nis quite natural. The proper names are missing as usual.\nThe ninth passage was taken because it represented references to\nthe receiver's own state with names and places that were familiar to\nhim. This is measurably successful, only one proper name failing.\nThere was some surprise in the receiver's getting the unusual name of\nthe German gentleman given, though it may be that the combination of\nsounds in this name is especially favourable to recognition. The tenth,\ncontaining a German passage with English of a very plain sort was\ndesigned to test more carefully the question of familiar sounds, the\nreceiver being less familiar with German than English. The result\nillustrates tne case very clearly. The English was all of it gotten,\nthat part in brackets arising into consciousness as the rest of the\nsentence was coming. But the German shows no conception of what\nwas in my mind as communicator.\nThe eleventh is interesting, for tne fact, that what was received\nsuggests the American Confederacy, and would appear false under the\ncircumstances that would render the Swiss Confederacy pertinent.\nThe clue in what is received is too slight to give any hint of the real\nreference of the communicator. In the twelfth instance, the chief\ninterest lies in the fact that the name Rocheliffe was not gotten,\nthough in the first experiment before, it surprised me by being obtained.\nThis sort of variation seems frequent in the Piper case. \"Judge\nemployment\" for \"church preferment\" is a singular error, and in the\nlast, and thirteenth message, the interest consists in the fact that the\nreceiver recognised, as I had intended, that the passage was from my\nsyllabus with which he was familiar. But he did not get it with\nsufficient clearness to locate the subject with complete definiteness.\nAll that he could determine was that it pertained to the eye, but the\n\fXLI.] 633\nAppendix V.\nessential clues in the words \" blind spot \" and \" fovea \" were missed,\nand hence the communication might easily give rise to all sorts\nof illusions.\nBut the most important feature of the whole set of experiments\nis the result regarding proper names and words that are not the most\ncommon in conversation. Wherever any set of terms seems to occur\nthat do not fall easily into the mass of apperception suggested by any\ngiven term the tendency to either error or failure is very marked.\nLong words noticeably show this failure if they are not very common.\nThe incident or clue has to be clear before there is any security that\nwords can even be guessed. Now proper names are notably terms\nwithout connotative or descriptive meaning and hence the sounds\nproduced by them have little or no suggestive meaning. They must\nnaturally give rise to difficulties in recognition on that account, as\nthe apperceptive mass is the point de repire of all the most probable\ninterpretations. This principle applies to infrequent terms as well as\nproper names. In fact the two are exactly alike in this respect, and\nit is interesting to find that experimental results show precisely the\nsame characteristics in this respect. The general resemblance of the\nPiper case to these conclusions is noticeable in the fact that\nthe vocabulary of easy communication seems limited. In two cases\nI deliberately tried unfamiliar words and the difficulties here noted\noccurred. The expressions that I used were \" United Presbyterian \"\nand ''Presidential Election,\" and there was great difficulty in\ngetting them understood. In this case, of course, I was the commu\nnicator. But either way the difficulty ought to occur, as we have the\nhuman organism in the case of Mrs. Piper as the medium through\nwhich the message has to be given, while the analogous case to these\nexperiments lies in the manner in which the \" control \" has to get the\ncommunications from the \" communicator.\" But aside from all\nquestions of spirit communication there is in these experiments a\ncomplete duplication of the difficulties and errors in the Piper case,\nwith an explanation in the known laws of mental phenomena, virtually\nindicating that such mistakes ought to occur with proper names and\nunfamiliar words. And it is not a little interesting to note that the\nconfusion in my experiments is even greater than in the Piper\nexperiments as a whole. Very few of the messages in the present\nexperiments succeed in becoming intelligible at all. Freedom from\nerrors seems to be connected with the simplest language and the most\nfrequently used words. The variations between success and failure\nare not so common as in the Piper phenomena. There is almost\nuniform confusion in the present instance. But the error and confu\nsion are like the Piper case in their characteristics, and rather indicate\nthat it is a wonder, assuming spirit communication at all, that we\n\f034 [part\n\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nobtain anything intelligible whatever. This difference between the\ncases suggests that possibly we have those variations of the mental\nconditions for communications which I have marked in the conversa\ntion with hypnotic subjects who have often, and perhaps generally, to\nbe prodded in order to retain the conditions for conversation at all.\nIf that supposition be correct we can understand the variations\nbetween clear and confused messages in the Piper case, while the laws\nthat are marked in these experiments at communication will explain\nthe uniform difficulties in connection with proper names and less com\nmon words, whether the communication is clear or confused.\n\fAppendix VI. 635\nAPPENDIX VI.\nExperiments in Hvpnosis.\nLast spring one of my students came to me with the following story.\nHe said that he had been kuocked down at football and remained uu-\nconscious for an hour and a half, and that when he had awakened from his\ncondition he had no recollection of this time or of the events that had taken\nplace while he was apparently conscious, as he had been told of some things\nthat he had done in his secondary state. He asked me to hypnotise him\nand to see if I could throw any light on the matter. I promised to do so,\nthough I had not previously been very successful in hynotising people, and\narranged for the time of the experiment. My plan was to interrogate the\nsubject for the events and memories of the lost hour and a half, after the\nmanner of the Ansel Bourne case (Proceedings, Vol. VII., pp. 221-259). I\nwas somewhat handicapped at the outset by the fact that some of the\nprincipal things which the subject had said and done had been told him by\nhis companions afterward, and hence I had but a margin to work upon for\ntraces of a hypnotic memory alone. However, I tried, and the following\nare the results. I took complete notes at the time and wrote them down\nimmediately on my return home, so that the present record is not wanting\non the ground of any neglect in regard to the means of making it useful.\nThe first attempt was made on April 22nd (1899). I hypnotised Mr. L.\nwith some difficulty, taking some half-an-hour to effect somnambulism.\nBut as soon as I was assured of deep enough hypnosis, which I accomplished\nin the usual way of trying various suggestions of an absurd sort, I began\nwith the question whether he, the subject, had ever played football. I\nreceived the answer, \"Yes,\" and asked, \"When?\" I got the answer,\n\"Last Wednesday.\" I then asked Mr. L. to tell me what had happened\nafter this during the whole time he had remained in this condition, not\nexpressing myself in exactly this language, but in a way to intimate my\nidea. But I soon found that if I got the story it must be by dint of much\nprodding, because the subject showed a drowsy condition and had to be\nurged at the end of every sentence to go on with the story, by asking him\nquestions whether anything else occurred. In this way the following state\nments were made : \u2014\n\" I was struck by the ball, but I did not know what happened to myself.\nMr. S. took my head on his knee. It was there about a minute and a half\nI was then laid down. I did not get up right away, but felt all right in a\nminute. I lay a short time, got up on my side and turned over. I said I\nwould lie down. Mr. Sa. (Sa. to distinguish him from Mr. S. above) asked\nhow I felt. All right, I said, but I did not know whathad happened. I walked\nup the field with one of the boys on each side, Mr. Sa. on the right, I think,\nand Van H. on the left. They took me up to the end of the field and laid\nme down with my head on Mr. S. 's leg. I was not told this. I was there\nabout a minute and a half. S. told me I must stop and see the base-ball\n\fti36 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\ngame. I stood up and stood around watching the game as they kept on\nplaying. Then they took me by the arms and crossed out at the gate, up\nthe steps, across a little corner of grass down to the Gym. S., I think,\nunlocked my locker and got out a part of my clothes. I had left them there\nto play football. They gave me a shower-bath. This was at the end of the\nGym., nearest my locker. I used the shower-bath at the right hand side as\nyou go in about the middle, or if not there, the nearest as you go in. I\nthink 1 did not want to wet my head. I dressed myself and put on a\nsweater instead of a shirt, and was taken to Dr. Savage's office and lay\ndown on a couch. Dr. Savage was giving an examination, but said that\nI would not iiother him. I was told to go to sleep, but I did not do so.\nSoon I began to realise where I was and awakened from my condition.\"\nI had some difficulty in finding Mr. S. for an interview in regard to the\nfacts in this narrative, but at last succeeded in getting him on the 24th\ninst. I had been very careful in the meantime not to say a word to Mr. L.\nof what he had told me in his secondary state. I was careful also not to\nexplain to him what I had done until I had asked for confirmation or denial\nof the facts told me by Mr. L. I simply asked him whether the incidents\nin the narrative were correct or not, and he verified every one of them in\ndetail, except two. The tirst was that Mr. L. was not struck by the ball,\nbut suffered from collision with the head of another student. The second\nwas that Mr. L. did not turn himself over, but was turned over by Mr. S.\nAll the other details were correct except the equivocal statement about the\nshower-bath, which was corrected, however, by Mr. L. in the statements of\nthe second experiment. Some of the main features of the incidents thus\nnarrated had been told him by the men who had taken him to the\nGymnasium after the accident, and cannot therefore be counted among\nthose belonging solely to the secondary consciousness. But Mr. S. told me\nthose which he had not mentioned to Mr. L. after the recovery of his\nnormal condition. They were the question of Mr. Sa. and L. 'a reply, the\ncrossing \" the corner of grass,\" the getting of his clothes by S., the shower-\nbath, \"at the end of the Gym., nearest the locker,\" and the statement of\nDr. Savage that L.'s presence on the couch would not bother him in his\nexamination. What he had been told of these incidents consisted of the\nnames of the persons that had taken him to the Gymnasium, and none of\nthe details. But as the only way from the field to the Gymnasium lay\nacross the grounds, the passage through the gate, up the steps, and to the\nGymnasium, would describe as well what he must have done, whether he\nremembered it or not, and could be imagined from a knowledge of arriving\nat the Gymnasium. But crossing \"the corner of grass\" was no necessary\npart of such a course, and, in fact, was out of the proper path, and\nforbidden ; though students with their field-shoes on often seem to disregard\nthe rule on this point. On the whole, however, the incidents that had not\nbeen told him are sufficiently numerous to exclude the supposition of\nchance, and to support the contention in favour of a secondary memory\ndistinct from the normal state.\nIn addition to this confirmation, however, Mr. S. also narrated some\ninteresting phenomena occurring during the secondary state that Mr. L. had\nnot told me in either state. Mr. S. reported that Mr. L. asked on the way\n\fXLI.] G37\nAppendix VI.\nto the Gymnasium what day it was, and remarked that he had asked the\nsame question a thousand years ago. Mr. L. also remarked to Dr. Savage,\nas he observed the latter conducting the physical examination of some\nstudent, that he himself, Mr. L., took that examination about one hundred\nyears ago. Mr. L. also remarked, according to the same authority, that he\nhad forgotten all his knowledge and that he would have to go to the \"Prep.\"\nschool again and begin it all over. This Statemeiit was made to several\npersons.\nWhen he recovered from the daze he asked Mr. McK. to return the\nring which that person was holding while Mr. L. played football, and in his\nspontaneous manner indicated to his companions that he had no recollection\nof what had happened, they being naturally a little incredulous of his\nasseverations.\nIt was nearly two weeks before I could secure Mr. L. for another experi\nment. But on May 6th I succeeded in this object. On this occasion I tried\nsome of the same and some further experiments. I found it more difficult\nthan before to hypnotise him, owing possibly to the presence of another\nperson in the room, one of my assistants. I had to make the trial a second\ntime before I succeeded, but when I did succeed the hypnosis was more\nprofound than before, since the answers to my questions were not so ready,\nand there seemed to be more marked tendencies to drowsiness. I found on\ninquiry before he had entered the hypnotic state that he could remember\nnothing of the experiment two weeks before after I had begun the work of\nhypnotising him. This was an evidence both of the genuineness of the\nprevious trance and of the unhypnotised condition of the patient at this\ntime. Afterwards I aided in bringing on the hypnosis by suggesting that\nhe should try to feel good and happy as he went to sleep. I obtained\nevidences after the subject came out that this suggestion had had its\ninfluence, as remarks of the subject on the return of consciousness indicate.\nWhen I had satisfied myself that I had secured hypnosis, I asked Mr. L.\nif he remembered going to a preparatory school, and received an affirmative\nanswer. I asked this question because, as the previous report indicates, I\nhad been told that he had remarked the loss of his knowledge and expressed\nthe fear that he would have to start at the preparatory school again. This\nremark, as above indicated, he had made to his friends in his dazed con\ndition after the injury in the collision. I then asked him if he remembered\nsaying anything about the loss of his knowledge, and he replied that he did,\nthat he thought he would have to begin study all over again, and that he\nthought at the time that he was not all right, the last two incidents having\nbeen given without further question or the influence from any suggestion\nthat a question might give. I then asked what the preparatory school was\nto which he went, and he replied, \"St. Paul's, in Garden City.\" I then\nasked him if he knew anybody by the name of Van H., and he replied\n\" Yes,\" and I further asked whether this man had done anything for him\nwhen he was dazed after the hurt, and he replied that \" he was first end on\nthe right, and he himself (L.) was on the left end in the field.\" The mean\ning of this was not certain to me at the time, but I understood that it was\nthat Van H. was playing on the right and Mr. L. on the left in the game.\nInquiry showed that my interpretation was correct. The incident shows\n\f638 [I'ART\n.\/. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nthat the normal state to some extent interpenetrates, even when not recog\nnised as such, with the secondary state. So also do many of the other\nincidents of a similar nature.\nI then asked him with reference to his having made a remark about\nsomething occurring a thousand years ago. He recalled having said some\nthing about it, and added, spontaneously, that he \"thought he had done all\nthese things before,\" referring to what had occurred to him after his hurt\nand in the secondary state that followed it. But I could get nothing more\ndefinite in regard to the meaning of this alleged memory.\nI asked, further, about what he thought regarding the examination of Dr.\nSavage, alluding, but without suggesting the matter definitely, to the fact\ntold me by Mr. S. My question was just as stated above. He replied that\nhe thought at the time that he had taken the examination before, but was\nnot sure, and thought he had not been marked.\nI then asked him who took him to the Gymnasium and was answ ered by\nthe statement, \"S. and N B .\" I followed with the query, how he\nhad gone and he described his going as he did before. He said they \" came\nout of the gate, up the Library steps, and on the right side of the Library\ncrossing the corner of the grass, on the right corner by the tree where the\nsign was, and down the steps into the Gymnasium at the right hand\nentrance. \"\nAsked how long he was dazed he said, \"one and a half hours;\" asked\nalso where he took his bath, he replied at \" the end of the Gym., towards Dr.\nSavage's room in compartment on the right side, not nearest the middle, but\nnearest the lockers.\" He went on to say, without further question, that S.\ndried him, and that he then went out and sat down by the locker, stayed a\nfew minutes, got half dressed, and did not remember what he then did. He\ndid not remember going to Dr. Savage's room, but did remember lying on\nhis couch. He remembered lying there for about ten minutes, and then\nnothing more.\nAt this point I began trying questions of a different sort and designed to\ndiscover traces, first of his normal sleep life, and then of the connection\nbetween both this and the secondary state and that between the latter and\nhis normal consciousness. I first asked him if he could recall any dreams.\nHe replied that he did not. I pressed the question, but received the same\nanswer twice more. I then asked him his name, and he hesitated some\ntime without being able to give it. I said, \" I don't think you have any.\"\nHe answered, \"No.\" 1 then asked, \" How old are you ?\" and received no\nanswer except the kind of half stammer of a person trying to think what his\nage was, and I then asked, \" About fifty ? \" and the answer came promptly,\n\" Yes.\" (He is not over twenty-one or twenty-two, perhaps less.) I asked,\n\"Where were you born?\" and he could not tell this, though I waited\nawhile. I then said, \" You have forgotten, have you i \" and received the\nanswer, \"Yes.\"\nI then tried the following experiments. The patient was sitting on one\nchair, his feet placed on another, and with his head cushioned on the back\nof the chair upon which he was sitting, and his eyes closed. I was standing\nbetween him and a table which was not more than two feet distant from his\nbody. I stood between his head and the table, so that even with his eyes\n\fXLI.] 639\nAppendix VI.\nopen he could not have seen me take anything from the table. Moreover, I\ncould reach anything I liked on this table without making any more noise\nthan would be caused by the friction of my clothes on the skin, and I could\nalso move it to the back of his head without his seeing it even with his eyes\nopen in the normal state, to say nothing of their being closed and him in\nhypnosis.\nI first picked up his glasses, which he had laid on the table before I began\nmy experiment, and held them about six inches from the back of his head,\nopposite the cerebellum. I had done this in a manner that he could neither\nsee me pick them up nor see me move them to that position. I asked him\nif he could not see what I had placed at the back of his head, and after hesi\ntating a moment and receiving the question again, he said he saw my hand,\nand when I asked what else, he replied, \" A pencil.\" The fact was that my\npencil was in my left hand in front of him and visible to any one with his\neyes open. I then put down the glasses, picked up the ink-bottle as noise\nlessly as possible and moved it to the back of his head as cautiously as I\ncould, and with movements to prevent any possible perception of it even\nwith open eyes in a normal state, and asked him again if he saw what was\nthere, and he replied with great promptness, \" An ink-bottle.\" I then took\nup a pink-coloured examination book with the number 416 written on the\ncover, and asked him, after putting it at the back of his head, what he saw,\nand received for reply, \" A table with pen and papers on it.\" I last took\nmy watch out of my pocket while purposely talking to him to prevent his\nhearing my movements, and held it at the back of his head, asking him\nwhat he saw there, and he replied, \"An ink-bottle again.\"\nThe prompt and interesting hit of the ink-bottle in the second experi\nment was a surprise to me at the time, and I tried the succeeding experiments\nto verify the suspicion that it awakened. But their failure and the nature\nof the answers suggested the probable source of the coincidence. His\nsupraliminal knowledge of the table and its natural contents, taken with the\nsuggestion to the secondary state from my movements, in spite of their\ncaution, most probably, or possibly at least, intimated the case of the table,\npapers, and pen. Thus, the incident of the ink-bottle is easily explained,\nthe imagination of the objects being suggested by an inference from the\nhypenesthetic perception of my movements.\nImmediately after these experiments, I awakened the subject and asked\nhim if he remembered anything he did. He replied that he remembered\ngetting up and sitting down again, and that he was asked to do something in\nthe way of tests, until one of them created quite a strange impression. At\nlast, he said, he saw a square hole going down towards the centre of the\nearth. \" I felt conscious,\" he said, \"when this started, and then something\ncame and told me to go to sleep, and I at once felt nice and enjoyable.\"\nThese statements are a tolerably good reproduction of what took place\nafter awakening him from the first trial of hypnosis half an hour before and\nduring the hecond attempt. I had thought that I was going to fail in the\nexperiment, as the signs of hypnosis did not occur, and awakened him to\ntest him and assure myself of what his condition was. I found that his\nanswers were favourable to a second attempt, and had him sit down again for\nanother trial, after saying that he might rest a few moments. I then began\n\f640 [PART\nH. Hyslol), Ph.D.\nthe hypnotising agiin in the usual way by passes over the eyes and forehead.\nAt last I told him to go to sleep and feel happy, because he was going to\nhave a nice time Soon after this I found him in hypnosis, as the tests\nindicated.\nHe also remarked after coming out of the trance that he was deeper in\nsleep than before (two weeks before) because he could not remember hearing\nmy voice this time.\nTwo days after, May 8th, and without divulging anything told me either\nto Mr. L or anyone else, I had an interview with the N B men\ntioned by the subject in hypnosis as one of the parties who took him to the\nGym. But I found that this person did not go with him. He did, however,\nwalk with him to the gate of the ball field, and could not remember who it\nwas that did accompany L. to the Gymnasium. Mr. B., however, remem\nbers that Mr. L. asked him a number of incoherent questions during his\ndazed condition after the hurt, and among them, as an example, he asked\n\" how he (L.) had gotten his (B.'s) clothes on.\" Mr. B. had lent Mr. L. his\nclothes to play in.\nThe fact that Mr. B. accompanied him to the gate accounts very readily\nfor the discrepancy in L.'s account, while the amount of error in it favours\nthe genuineness of the phenomena with which I am dealing, as against the\npossible suspicion of foul play with me. It would be quite a natural mistake\nto make in any confused state. The previous narrative does not contradict\nit, as names had not been given.\nAn interview also with Mr. Van H. shows that he was not one of the\npersons that accompanied Mr. L. to the Gymnasium. But ho did accom\npany him, as did Mr. B., as far as the gate at the entrance to the field.\nMr. Van H. also says that it was the collision of his own head with that\nof Mr. L. that caused the hurt, and not a stroke of the ball, as I was told\nin the first experiment. Nor was it a kick on the chest, as I had been\ntold in the first experiment, but forgot to record it. The failure of Mr.\nL.'s memory at this point is interesting and natural, as he had insisted all\nalong, both in his dazed condition and also in his normal condition, that he\ndid not know how he was hurt. Mr. Van. H. said that as they brought\nMr. L. to the middle of the field after the hurt, he, Mr. L., did not seem\nto know how he had been hurt, and, looking at the game in bewilderment,\nasked if that was the way he was hurt. The confusion in the hypnosis at\nthis point then is interesting.\nAll three men, Messrs B., S., and Van H., confirmed the truth of the\nother incidents in the narrative as given in hypnosis, even down to the\ncrossing at the right of the Library and over the corner of the grass where the\ntree and sign were, except that the confirmation of this last feature was by S.,\nwho had accompanied L. all the way. After Mr. L. came out of the trance\nI asked him where he had gone to the preparatory school, and received the\nsame answer as in hypnosis, \"St. Paul's, in Garden City.\" A number of\nthe incidents had been told him after he recovered consciousness, such\nas his queer remarks about having lost his knowledge, and thinking thnt all\nthis had occurred before. But some of the smaller and less striking inci\ndents had not been told him in this dazed condition : for instance, that he\nhimself, Mr. L., was on the left end in the field. But this was, of course,\n\fxu.] Gil\nAppendix VI.\nan incident of the normal consciousness. Nor had he been told the exact\ndirection of his course to the Gymnasium. The incidents of the tree and\nsign and crossing the corner of the grass were also matters of supraliminal\nknowledge in so far as previous habits were concerned, and would be the\nprobable course of men in athletic dress in spite of the rules to the contrary\nin the institution.\nSome days afterward I tried to repeat the experiments, but owing to the\naccident of a sudden shock, liko the quiisi electrical shock which we often\nexperience as we go to sleep, Mr. L. was awakened, after a long attempt to\nhypnotise him, and I did not have time to continue tho experiment.\nMost of the incidents in these experiments speak for themselves, and it\nrequires no comment by me to explain their significance, if they have any.\nThey resemble the usual phenomena of hypnosis. But I may recapitulate\nsome of the points of interest. In the first place, there is no trace of a\nconnection between the subject's ordinary sleep and the hypnotic condition.\nBut these experiments are not sufficient to throw any light upon that question,\non one side or the other. There is, however, a decided connection between tho\nnormal and the secondary consciousness, though it is not one in which the\nsecondary consciousness seems to have any recognition that tho incidents\ncommon to the two states belonged to a normal condition. But what\ninterested me most in the case was two facts. First, that connection\nbetween tho primary and the secondary states which indicates a unity\nof personal ground for tho phenomena, whatever disintegration we may\nobserve in the phenomenal unity of the two states, or perhaps, better,\nwhatever segregation we observe in the two series. There seemed to\nbe absolutely no conscious unity whatsoever between the two states,\nthough there is undoubtedly a subject unity in them. The second\nand most interesting characteristic is the resemblance of the perform\nance to what we have to imagine is the case \"on the other side \" in\nthe Piper phenomena. I found that I could get nothing out of the subject\nwithout constant prodding. The tendency to silent drowsiness was so great\nthat I could get him to talk only in answer to questions. Now, in the Piper\nReports, the allegation is that the \" communicator \" is in a dazed condition\nand that it is difficult to get any statements from him. The confusion\ncertainly resembles what I here observe. I remember one instance precisely\nlike this. Phinuit, speaking to one of the \"communicators,\" as if to arouse\nhim, says : \"Don't go to sleep.\" Similar intimations seem to be frequent.\n(See Proceedings, Vol. XIII, pp. 404, 466, and 473.) We cannot press this\nanalogy with any great assurance without many experiments and a larger\naccumulation of facts. But it is worth calling attention to it here as a\nsuggestion of what needs observation. There seems also a suggestive\npossibility in the subject's inability to give his own name, age, and birth.\nIs there any connection between this and the similar difficulties and\nhesitation with which \"communicators'' in the Piper case give their own\nnames, though they seem more ready to give the names of others, as\nnoticeable here 't Mr. L. had spontaneously mentioned some facts\nrepresenting incidents of his normal life, and he mentioned others in\nresponse to questions not calculated to suggest them ; but he had, in spite\nof this, wholly forgotten his name, age, and time of his birth, unless we\n\fG42 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nsuppose that he should have been given more time, as in the Piper instance,\nto give them. But whatever our view of the case, there is this phenomenal\nresemblance between the two sets of facts.\nNew York, November 9th, 1899.\nWe, the undersigned parties to the incidents narrated in the abo%'e\naccount of experiments with Mr. Luin, aver that our part in them has been\none of good faith and honesty, and that we have not consciously done or\nsaid anything that would impeach the character of the facts as reported\nto Professor Hyslop by ourselves. To the best of our knowledge this is a\ntrue account of the events as they occurred within our observation.\u2014Very\ntruly,\nThomas Simons,\nH. Van Hievenberg, Jun.,\nRai.ph; E. Lum.\nWitness : J. H. Hvsi.op.\n\fXLI.] Appendix VII.\nAPPENDIX VII.\nQuotations bearing on the Mentai. Condition of the Communicator\nwhii.e Communicating.\nIt has occurred to me while reading the proofs that the reader\nmight wish to have the evidence for the position taken throughout the\nReport that the communicator was not in his normal mental state while\ncommunicating, at least for part of the time. There may be lucid\nmoments enough, but there are times when his mental state apparently\nborders on delirium or the complete loss of memory, and something like\nhypnosis or secondary personality. It will be convenient for the\nreader to have the evidence for this collected together with the\nreferences. I have; confined myself to my own Report in this evidence,\nthough previous Reports are i\\mtv as full of similar indications of an\nabnormal mental condition while communicating. Besides, I have not\nincorporated in this list of indications the indirect evidence consisting\nof certain confused messages, and various passages showing intrinsic\nmarks of some mental disturbance. The reader must determine these\nfor himself by a psychological study of the contents. I have\ntherefore limited myself to the direct statements of the communicators\nand those messages which do not require study to ascertain the fact\nasserted.\nThe first statement that indicates an abnormal mental condition\noccurred in the first sitting, and shows of itself from the connection in\nwhich it took place that it was one of those incoherences that we are\nfamiliar with in deliria. It occurred just at the close of the communi\ncator's effort when he had to disappear. It was the expression, \" I say,\ngive me my hat \" (p. 307). This was repeated in precisely similar con\nditions at the second sitting. \" Give me my hat, and let me go \" (p. 313).\nA little later (p. 313) occurred, \" I want my head clear. I am choking.\"\nThe attempt first to give the name of my uncle Carruthers ended in\ncalling him \" uncle Charles,\" and I disowned him. The reply of the\ncommunicator showed the consciousness of some confusion or difficulty,\n\"No, I am thinking . . . let me see\" (p. 316). A little later he\nsaid, \" I know, James, that my thoughts are muddled, but if you can\nonly hear what I am saying you will not mind it\" (p. 316). In the\nsame sitting at the close of a rather confused attempt to deliver some\nmessages, he said, \" In a short time they tell me I will be able to\nrecall everything I ever did. You could be . . my . . . knew\n\fG4-4 [l'AKT\n.\/. B. Hi\/slop, Ph.D.\ndoes not ... I will have to go for a moment. Wait for me \"\n(p. 319). A similar remark was made at the next sitting, just after\nthe confused attempt to tell an incident about a fire. It was, \" Do\nyou know that in a little while I will be able to recall everything I ever\nknew \" (p. 325). Just after a passage in which two chronologically\nseparated but psychologically connected facts were alluded to, the\ncommunicator says, \" I feel better now, James. I felt very much con\nfused when I first came here \" (p. 327). In reference to something\nthat he could not recall he said, \" But strange I cannot think of the\nword I want\" (p. 330), and a little later regarding a similar matter,\n\"This is what I cannot think, and it troubles me a little, James,\nbecause I know it so well \" (p. 330). In reference to my sister Annie's\ncommunication at the third sitting he said, \" She has been here longer\nthan I have, James, and is cleaver in her thoughts when she is trying\nto speak, but do not feel troubled about it \" (p. 332). It is interesting\nto remark that both statements are true. My sister died long before\nmy father, and her communications show decidedly less mental disturb\nance than his. A moment later my father said, after Rector,\napparently discovering something wrong, had remarked to me to move,\n\" Yes, my head grows lighter and lighter \" (p. 332). At the fourth\nsitting my father said, \" My head seems clearer and I can see\nyou perfectly. I can see and hear tetter than ever. Your voice\nto me does not seem so far away. I will come nearer dav by day \"\n(p. 335).\nAfter some confusion about the medicine for which I had asked, he\nsaid, \" I seem to lose part of my recollections between my absence and\nreturn\" (p. 336). Speaking of the accordion which had been \"given\nhim\" to \"hold\" him, as the spiritistic lingo has it, he said, \"I am\nclearer when I see it \" (p. 330). This is apparently true of all the\ncommunications. In almost the next sentence occurs an automatism\nquite like the references to his hat (pp. 307 and 313). \"Where is my\ncoat. I iiegin to think of what I do not need \" (p. 336). It is most\ninteresting to remark here that the communicator discovers that his\nmind is wandering, and alludes himself to the incoherence. After\nsome confused message regarding several matters, apparently discovering\nhis difficulties, he said, \" I assure you when I can get so I can 8peak\nand say just what I like I will straighten out things for you\" (p. 338).\nA little later Rector says, \" Give me something that I may hold him\nquite clearly \" (p. 338), indicating the effect of old articles on the\ncommunicator.\nWhen I had indicated that 1 did not remember the subject of our\nconversation about Swedenborg, my father seemed to think that he\nmight have had the talk with some one else, and said, \" In any case\nI shall soon be able to remember all about it. I am so much nearer\n\fXLI.] 645\nAppendix VII.\nand so much clearer now than when I vaguely saw you here, and when\nCharles tried to wake me up here\" (p. 341).\nIn Dr. Hodgson's sitting a number of interesting instances occur.\nThe communicator, my father, had had much difficulty in trying to\nname the contents of a spectacle case that he had been asked to name,\nand after one effort he said, \" Let me go a minute and return I am\nvery blind, and begin to feel very strange \" (p. 378). Immediately\nafter his departure Rector says, \" He seems a most intelligent fellow,\nbut finds it difficult for him to remain long at a time. In time he will,\nhowever, come very near, be quite clear, and do a great work for thee,\nfriend\" (p. 379. Cf. pp. 372 and 384). A few moments later, in\nexplaining the difficulty of adjusting himself to the \" light,\" father said,\n\" I think of everything I ever did. All in one minute it comes to me,\nthen seems to leave me when I try to express something of it to you \"\n(p. 379). At the close of a sitting, that of February Kith, Rector\nremarked of him, \" Friend, he is awakening, and seems very clear this\nday \" (p. 390). At the next sitting my father, alluding to the name of\na medicine which he could not recall, said, \" I took at one time some\npreparation of oil, but the name has gone from my memory. I know\neverything so well when I am not speaking to you \" (p. 392). After\nsome conversation between Rector and Dr. Hodgson regarding the\nmethod of obtaining certain messages and Rector's explanation of\nwhat was necessary, Rector said, \" Friend, while speaking he is like in\ncomparison to a very sick man, yet when we take his objects it clears\nhim greatly for the moment \" (p. 394). A little later my father says,\nafter some confusion and finding that he must rest, as it were,\n\"I cannot really say more to you now. I am getting weak \" (p. 395).\nThe illustrations are perhaps quite as numerous in the last eight\nsittings as in the previous ones, except that in the sitting of June 8th,\nwhich was the clearest I had, there is only one conscious recognition of\nthe mental state connected with communications.\nIn the first message on May 29th my father said, \" If I fail in my\nmemory think not for me, but let me think my thoughts, and they will\ncome to me in time, past memories and all \" (p. 418). A little later he\nsaid, \" I am sorry if I mistake anything, but they tell me if I am\npatient I will rememlxu- all \" (p. 419). After a brief respite he said,\n\" I am thinking over the things I said when I was confused.\" Then,\nalluding to his Ix'lief that he thought it \" possible we might live else\nwhere, ' but that communication was doubtful, he said, \" We do speak,\nalthough vaguely at times,\" and added, \" What is on my mind at\npresent is the conditions which help me to return\" (p. 420). Speaking\nof my brother's disposal of the horse Tom, he said, \"1 am thinking\nabout it now and everything I ever knew I believe, because my mind\ntravels so fast, and I try to get away from the rest as much as possible\"\n\fG46 [PART\n.\/. \/\/. Hyklop, Ph.D.\n(p. 424). When I said that I did not remember the stool to which he\nreferred, he said, \" Strange, I think, but when I go out I will think it\nall over and see what I have told you \" (p. 424). A few minutes later,\nwhen I had indicated that my stepmother knew of the knife to which\nhe had alluded, and that I did not, he said, \" Well, that will be all\nright, but what I am anxious about is for you to know I am not for\ngetting anything, only I am a little confused when I try to tell you\nwhat I so longed to do. I think of twenty things all at once \" (pp.\n424-425). In a moment he disappeared for a respite, and on his return\nhe immediately said, \" Ah, James, do not, my son, think I am degener\nating because I am disturbed in thinking over my earthly life, but if\nyou will wait for me I will remember all, everything I used to know \"\n(p. 425). My cousin, Hobert McClellan, in his first attempt to com\nmunicate remarked in the midst of his messages, \" I am a little dazed\nfor the moment, but have patience with me, and I will be clear\npresently\" (p. 428). Alluding to the fire which had been mentioned\nin an extravagant manner on December 26th (p. 324), and recognising\napparently his confusion about it, my father said, \"There are some\nthings which I have said while speaking to you here which may seem\nmuddled. Forgive it, my son, and if you wish to straighten it ask me\nand I will \" (p. 431). A few minutes later in a confused passage about\nmy brother Charles, my uncle Carruthers, and apparently John\nMcClellan, he exclaimed, \"Oh, speak, James. Help me to keep my\nthoughts clear\" (p. 431). After introducing my mother by name she\ntried to communicate, but had to give it up with the statement, \" I\nwant to speak of the rest, but I am too weak \" (p. 432). A little later\nmy father said, \"There is more than a million things I would like to\nspeak about, but I do not seem to be able to think of them all, especi\nally when I am here. It was not so long ago that I came here \" (p. 433).\nThis last statement is most interesting in connection with the fact\nwhich we have found empirically to be true, namely, that persons not\nlong deceased are generally not so good communicators as those who\nhave passed long before. Compare his allusion to my sister Annie\nand the longer period of her decease (p. 332). After quite a clear\nreference to Swedenborg on May 31st, he said, \"Never mind, I am\nclearing, James, and all will be well \" (p. 438). Apparently my cousin\nwas communicating soon afterward, and in the midst of a very confused\nset of messages, Rector said, \" Wait a moment and he will return and\nclear it up\" (p. 439). The confusion seems not to have diminished,\nand in a few minutes my cousin himself said, in response to a question\nfrom me, supposing that I was dealing with the John McClellan that\nwas treasurer of the university I attended, \"Well, of course, but you\nsee I am not quite clear yet, but it will surely come back to me\" (p.\n440). A little later, in response to my query as to who was speaking,\n\fXLI.] 647\nAppendix VII.\napparently Rector said, \" It is father who is speaking now. But he\nseems a little dazed \" (p. 440). Father took a respite, and on his\nreturn he said, \" I am going to try and keep my thoughts straight \"\n(p. 441). Later, \"I do not seem to be able to express all I want\"\n(p. 443).\nAfter an allusion to myself my father said, \" I am really too weak\nto think more for you, James, and they seem not to hear me so well \"\n(p. 445). Presently he tried to say something about the Cooper inci\ndent, and in the midst of much confusion he said, \" I am confused,\nJames, and I cannot tell you what I wish, and I will try again. I am\ngoing now,\" and he disappeared (p. 445).\nOn June 1st Rector said near the beginning, \"And we wish to say\nthat we were somewhat confused at the closing of the last meeting\nowing to the light failing us \" (p. 448). This will be apparent to the\nreader if he examines the record. When father began he said soon\nafter, \"I intended to refer to uncle John, but I was somewhat dazed,\nJames\" (p. 448-9). In a moment he said \"I am all right while\nImperator is near me, and my memory comes back to me clearer \"\n(p. 449). Later I tried to have him name the cause of my uncle\nCarruthers' death, and he having said pneumonia, which applied to my\nuncle James McClellan, I said, \" Do not worry about it now. It\nwill come again.\" My father's reply was, \"I was only disturbed\nbecause of the accident that I could not make clear, and Charles\ninterrupted me somewhat because he had a fever \" (p. 450). The\nallusions to the accident and to my brother's fever are important\nincidents, and taken in connection with the facts of the record, the\nconfusion is quite apparent. Later on and after a very confused set\nof messages regarding my brothers he said, \" I am getting tired, James,\nwill rest a moment and return. This is a very heavy atmosphere to be\nin \" (p. 454). Toward the close of the sitting, after an allusion to\nmyself, he said, \" I seem to go back to the old days more than anything\nelse. Don't say you wonder at this, that, and the other, but wait, be\npatient\u2014all will be clear to you some day. If I fail in my memory,\ndo not say, well, if that is father he must have forgotten a great deal.\nI really forget nothing, but I find it not easy to tell it all to you.\nI feel as though I should choke at times (Cf. p. 313), and I fail to\nexpress my thoughts, but if fragmentary try and think the best of\nthem, will you ? \" (p. 456). After a short communication from my\nmother, who could not remain long, my father appeared and said, ''Now\nlet me tell you one thing more, and that is about the little errors\nwhich I may make when speaking to you. I think many things all at\nonce, and when I try to give mention to them, I fail somewhat\"\n(p. 459). After the best message that my uncle Carruthers gave, my\nfather broke in with the allusion to my sister Lida, and said, \"I had\n\f648 [part\nJ. H. Hyslop, Ph.D.\nto come to straighten out uncle Clark's mind, James \" (p. 460). A little\nlater in alluding to the organ, he ejaculated, \" Oh, what was that hymn\nwe used to sing so often 1\" I replied, \" Keep calm. It will come out\nall right.\" He then went on, \"Well, I will think of it presently, and\n... is it all clear to you, or are you confused 1 \" (p. 461 ). In the con\nfused attempt to name the relationship of the John McClellan who had\nrecently died, my father said, \" Now wait, I am a little confused myself \"\n(Footnote, p. 472). At the close of the sitting he said, \"I feel, think,\nand know as well as I ever did, and yet I am not able in this way to\nexpress all I think. I may give out my thoughts in fragments, but if\nI do I hope they may at least comfort you a little\" (p. 475). In the\ncommunications connected with the confusion about my stepmother's\nname he said, apparently alluding to her, \" Yes, but it was she who\nmade the cap, and you had better ask her about it. Sarah, SARAH.\nLet me see what is it I wish to say. Ellen. Help me. Oh, help to\n[U. H. puts leather spectacle case and brown knife on table, next to\nhand. Hand moves back the knife and retains the spectacle case.]\nrecall what I so longed to say. My own mother Nannie. I . .\nwait. I will go for a moment, wait for me, James\" (p. 479). In the\nname \" Sarah \" my father evidently recurs to the trip mentioned a little\nbefore, as my aunt Sarah accompanied us on that trip, and forgets the cap.\nThe significance of the confused statement \"My own mother Nannie\"\nis commented on elsewhere (p. 71, and Note 77, p. 524). In a sudden\ninterruption of his thoughts he exclaimed, \" Now what did I . . . ,\"\nand recovering the thread immediately said, \" Oh, yes, I then arranged\nto go out there to live \" (p. 482). Finally on June 8th, explaining his\nmental condition on first coming to communicate, he said, \" You see,\nJames, I was not wholly conscious when I came here, and I suddenly\nthought of every one of my dear ones the moment I awoke \" (p. 491,\nCf. p. 341).\nThere are many less striking passages bearing on the point which I\nhave not included in this list. The reader may remark them for him\nself if he reads the detailed record with proper care. Besides, I have\nnot put down those automatisms in all cases which indicate the oncoming\nsvncope or unconsciousness which mark the disappearance of a com\nmunicator (Cf. expressions \"mother,\" \"father,\" etc., in my uncle's\nfirst attempt, pp. 315 and 316). Nor have I mentioned those broken\nmessages which clearly indicate the same fact of automatism or delirium\nin any number of cases. The reader must wateh for them himself.\nBut it is an interesting fact to remark the communicator's frequent\nobservation that the confusion is due to defective memory (amnesia)\nand rapid thinking when he can remember. We might suppose a priori\nthat this would be the case from the fact that the communicator is\ndivested of all motor functions for inhibiting the flow of his thoughts,\n\fAppendix VII. 649\nwhile they must at the same time be adjusted to the automatic action\nof the motor functions in Mrs. Piper's organism.\nApropos of the statements about rapid thinking it may be of interest\nto narrate a frequent experience of my own recently. I have been\nsuffering from a severe attack of nervous prostration, and I noted\nduring it many (perhaps hundreds of them) instances in which a thought\ncame into my mind and I tried to hold it before attention and could\nnot do so. They passed in a second into irrecoverable oblivion. I say\nsecond purposely, as no more time than this in most cases elapsed\nbefore the incident was gone. I could remember that there was some\nthing which I wanted to remember, but the thought desired was too\nevanescent, and would not respond to my effort. This is, of course, an\nabnormal mental condition. I have remarked the same phenomenon in\nthe interval between sleep and waking. The same is a frequent charac\nteristic of dreams. It is common also in functional patho-psychosis.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nTHE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nINDEX TO VOLUME XVI.\n(PART XLL)\n1901.\nArtici.es brought to Sittings for Identification 23, 48, 307, 323, 338, 367, 370,\n371, 373-5, 377-80, 384-91, 394, 397, 479, 497-8, 648\n\" Aunt Nannie,\" Chief References to 27, 43-8, 61, 62, 69-74, 76, 80, 81, 85,\n132, 133, 146, 171, 172, 192-3, 210, 232-3, 240,310, 331,\n342-3, 305, 400-3, 407, 421, 449, 451, 459, 460, 463,\n469-70, 478-81, 483, 493, 496, 519, 524, 526, 528, 529\nAutomatisms 238-41,259,260\n(See also \" Spiritistic Hypothesis \"\u2014Characteristic Phrases.)\n,, Normal Automatic Krrors ... 238-40\nB., Miss, Experiments in Identification, 616\nB., Miss O. , Experiments in Identification 553\n1$., Mr., Experiments in Identification 583\nB. , Professor, Experiments in Identification 586, 588\nBourne, Ansel, Case of .. 271, 635\nBrainwell, Dr. Milne, On Subliminal Appreciation of Time 154\nC, Professor, Experiments in Identification 565, 567, 583\nCaird, Dr. E., On Kant's Theory of Methods of Communication from\nDiscarnate Spirits .\" 243\nCarruthers, Mrs. Eliza, Chief References to, 27, 47, 80, 81, 85, 90-5, 100, 132,\n146, 192, 193, 310, 314, 315, 317, 469, 470, 478,\n491, 496, 519, 524, 528\n,, ,, Evidence as to Incidents Communicatee!, 353, 354, 355, 528\n,, James (Uncle Clarke) (Sec Communicators.)\nCartesian Conceptions of the Soul 225, 259\nCommunication Through a Tube, Experiments in 18, 624\nCommunications, Analysis Showing Proportion of Truth and Falsity in 118-21\n,, Classification of Chief Incidents 131-33\n\u201e Statistical Summary 116-23\n\fii Index to Volume XVI.\nCommunicator, Mental Condition of\u2014while Communicating ... 249, 6+3\n,, and Sitter, Possible Effects of Relationship between 122, 123,\n257, 258\nCommunicators, Chief References to :\u2014\nCarnithert, James, 17, 26, 29, 64, 76, 90-5, 146, 173, 174, 192,\n193, 222, 314, 315, 317, 353-5, 363, 422-23, 428, 431.\n444-6, 450, 459, 484, 504-5, 513, 528, 529, 643, 647, 648\nHyulop, Anna, 17, 27, 96, 105, 108, 147, 205, 209, 307, 331, 358,\n421, 425, 451, 482, 502, 644, 646\n\u201e \"Charles,\" 17, 23-5, 27, 94, 100, 147, 184-91, 205,\n206, 307, 309, 310, 313, 316, 330, 350, 431, 440,\n450, 455, 462-5, 513-7. 518, 645, 646, 647\n\u201e Martha Ann (Mrs.) 21,26,306,308,431,458\n\u201e Robert, 12, 17, 22, 26, 28-47, 48-93, 97, 109, 112, 131-33,\n137, 160, 170, 189, 190-214, 221-38, 257, 308, 313, 316-22,\n324-44, 347, 343, 351, 352, 354-62, 370-5, 377-9, 380-95,\n397-416, 418 27, 429-38, 440-1, 443-5, 448-56, 459,460-3,\n468-75, 478-81, 484, 485, 490-536, 643-9\nMeClellan, Jamcs, 17, 26, 64, 65, 77, 108, 109, 146-7, 258, 445,\n446, 450, 463-6, 470-3, 513, 520-1, 529, 536, 647\n,, Robert Harvey, 63, 74, 95, 97, 108, 145, 164, 167,\n205, 211, 223, 231, 258, 427-9, 433, 442, 443, 494,\n505, 508-10, 514, 515, 518, 520-5, 532, 536, 646\nPelham, George (\" G.
