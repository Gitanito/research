W. H. MYERS.\nBY OLIVER LODGE, D.Sc., F.R.S.\n'\\pvvfjLtvos r)V rt \\ftv)(r)v KO.I VCMTTOV iraipiav.\nWHO would have thought a year ago, when our Secretary and joint\nFounder at length consented to be elected President, that we should\nso soon be lamenting his decease '\nWhen Henry Sidgwick died, the Society was orphaned, and now it is\nleft desolate. Of the original chief founders, Professor Barrett alone\nremains ; for Mr. Podmore, the only other member of the first\nCouncil still remaining on it, was not one of the actual founders of\nthe Society. Neither the wisdom of Sidgwick nor the energy and\npower of Myers can by any means be replaced. Our loss is certain,\nbut the blow must not be paralysing. Rather it must stimulate those\nthat remain to fresh exertions, must band us together determined\nthat a group of workers called together for a pioneering work, for\nthe founding and handing on to posterity of a new science, must not\nbe permitted to disband and scatter till their work is done. That\nwork will not be done in our lifetime ; it must continue with what\nenergy and wisdom we can muster, and we must be faithful to\nthe noble leaders who summoned us together and laid this burden to\nour charge.\nI, unworthy, am called to this Chair. I would for every reason that\nit could have been postponed ; but it is the wish of your Council ; I am\ntold that it was the wish of Myers, and I regard it as a duty from\nwhich I must not shrink.\nThe last communication which my predecessor made was in memory\nof Henry Sidgwick : my own first communication must be in memory\nof Frederic Myers.\n\f2 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART\nTo how many was he really known ? I wonder. Known in a sense\nhe was to all, except the unlettered and the ignorant. Known in\nreality he was to very few. But to the few who were privileged to\nknow him, his is a precious memory : a memory which will not decay\nwith the passing of the years. I was honoured with his intimate\nfriendship. I esteem it one of the honours of my life.\nTo me, though not to me alone, falls the duty of doing some\njustice to his memory. I would that I might be inspired for the\ntask.\nI was not one of those who knew him as a youth, and my acquaint\nance with him ripened gradually. Our paths in life were wide apart,\nand our powers very different : our powers, but not our tastes. He\ncould instruct me in literature and most other things, I could instruct\nhim in science ; he was the greedier learner of the two. I never knew\na man more receptive, nor one with whom it was a greater pleasure to\ntalk. His grasp of science was profound : I do not hesitate to say it,\nthough many who do not really know him will fail to realise that this\nwas possible; nor was he fully conscious of it himself. Even into\nsome of the more technical details, when they were properly pre\nsented, he could and did enter, and his mind was in so prepared a\nstate that any fact once sown in it began promptly to take root and\nbud. It was not a detailed knowledge of science that he possessed, of\ncourse, but it was a grasp, a philosophic grasp, of the meaning and\nbearing of it all, not unlike the accurately comprehending grasp of\nTennyson ; and again and again in his writings in our Proceedings do\nwe find the facts which his mind had thus from many sources absorbed\nutilised for the purpose of telling and brilliant illustrations, and made\nto contribute each its quota to his Cosmic scheme.\nFor that is what he was really doing, all through this last quarter\nof a century : he was laying the foundation for a cosmic philosophy,\na scheme of existence as large and comprehensive and well founded\nas any that have appeared.\nDo I mean that he achieved such a structure 1 I do not. A\nphilosophy of that kind is not to be constructed by the labour of\none man, however brilliant; and Myers laboured almost solely on\nthe psychological side. He would be the first to deprecate any\nexaggeration of what he has done, but he himself would have\nadmitted this,\u2014that he strenuously and conscientiously sought facts,\n\fXLII.] In Memory of F. W. H. Myers. 3\nand sought to construct his cosmic foundation by their aid and in\ntheir light, and not in the dark gropings of his own unaided intelli\ngence. A wilderness of facts must be known to all philosophers;\nthe true philosopher is he who recognises their underlying principle\nand sees the unity running through them all.\nThis unity among the more obscure mental processes Myers saw, as\nit seems to me, more clearly than any other psychologist ; but what\nright have I to speak on psychological problems ? I admit that I\nhave no right\u2014I only crave indulgence to show the thing as it\nappears to me. For authoritative psychology we must hear Professor\nWilliam James. He will contribute a memoir, but as I write now\nI have heard no word from William James. I express only what\nhas long been in my mind.\nTo me it has seemed that most philosophers suffer from a dearth\nof facts. In the past necessarily so, for the scientific exploration\nof the physical universe is, as it were, a thing of yesterday. Our\ncosmic outlook is very different from that of the ancients, is different\neven from that of philosophers of the middle of the century, before\nthe spectroscope, before Darwin and Wallace, before many discoveries\nconnected with less familiar household words than these : in the\nmatter of physical science alone the most recent philosopher must\nneeds have some advantage. But this is a small item in his total\noutfit, mental phenomena must contribute the larger part of that ;\nand the facts of the mind have been open\u2014it is generally assumed\u2014\nfrom all antiquity. This is in great degree true, and philosophers\nhave always recognised and made use of these facts, especially those\nof the mind in its normal state. Yet in modern science we realise\nthat to understand a thing thoroughly it must be observed not only\nin its normal state but under all the conditions into which it can be\nthrown by experiment, every variation being studied and laid under\ncontribution to the general understanding of the whole.\nAnd, I ask, did any philosopher ever know the facts of the mind\nin health and in disease more profoundly, with more detailed and\nintimate knowledge, drawn from personal inquiry, and from the\ntestimony of all the savants of Europe, than did Frederic Myers?\nHe laid under contribution every abnormal condition studied in the\nSalpe'triere, in hypnotic trance, in delirium, every state of the mind\nin placidity and in excitement. He was well acquainted with the\n\f4 l)r. Oliver Lodge. [PART\ncurious facts of multiple personality, of clairvoyant vision, of hallucina\ntions, automatisms, self-suggestion, of dreams, and of the waking\nvisions of genius.\nIt will be said that Hegel, and to some extent Kant also, as well as\nother philosophers, recognised some ultra-normal mental manifestations,\nand allowed a place for clairvoyance in their scheme. All honour to\nthose great men for doing so, in advance of the science of their\ntime; but how could they know all that we know to-day? Fifty\nyears ago the facts even of hypnotism were not by orthodox science\naccepted; such studies as were made, were made almost surreptitiously,\nhere and there, by some truth-seeker clear-sighted enough to outstep\nthe fashion of his time and look at things with his own eyes. But\nonly with difficulty could he publish his observations, and doubtless\nmany were lost for fear of ridicule and the contempt of his professional\nbrethren.\nBut now it is different : not so different as it ought to be, even yet ;\nbut facts previously considered occult are now investigated and re\ncorded and published in every country of Europe. The men who\nobserve them are too busy to unify them ; they each contribute their\nportion, but they do not grasp the whole : the grasping of the whole\nis the function of a philosopher. I assert that Myers was that\nphilosopher.\nDo I then in my own mind place him on a pedestal by the side of\nPlato and Kant ? God forbid ! I am not one to juggle with great\nnames and apportion merit to the sages of mankind. Myers' may not\nbe a name which will sound down the ages as an achiever and builder\nof a system of truth ; but I do claim for him that as an earnest pioneer\nand industrious worker and clear-visioned student, he has laid a\nfoundation, perhaps not even a foundation but a corner-stone, on\nground more solid than has ever been available before ; and I hold\nthat the great quantity of knowledge now open to any industrious\ntruth-seeker gives a man of modest merit and of self-distrustful powers,\na lever, a fulcrum, more substantial than those by which the great men\nof antiquity and of the middle ages were constrained to accomplish\ntheir mighty deeds.\nMyers has left behind two unpublished volumes on Human\nPersonality, has left them, I believe, in charge of Dr. Hodgson\u2014has\nleft them, alas, not finished, not finally finished ; how nearly finished\n\fXLII.] In Memory of F. W. H. Myers. 5\nI do not know. I saw fractions of them some time ago as they left his\npen, and to me they seemed likely to be an epoch-making work.\nThey are doubtless finished enough : more might have been done,\nthey might have been better ordered, more highly polished, more\nneatly dove-tailed, had he lived; but they represent for all time his\nreal life work, that for which he was willing to live laborious days ;\nthey represent what he genuinely conceived to be a message of moment\nto humanity : they are his legacy to posterity ; and in the light of the\nfacts contained in them he was willing and even eager to die.\nThe termination of his life, which took place at Eome in presence\nof his family, was physically painful owing to severe attacks of difficult\nbreathing which constantly preceded sleep ; but his bearing under it\nall was so patient and elevated as to extort admiration from the\nexcellent Italian doctor who attended him ; and in a private letter\nby an eye-witness his departure was described as \"a spectacle for\nthe Gods ; it was most edifying to see how a genuine conviction of\nimmortality can make a man indifferent to what to ordinary people\nis so horrible.\"\nIn the intervals of painful difficulty of breathing he quoted from one\nof his own poems (\"The Renewal of Youth,\" one which he pre\nferred to earlier and better-known poems of his, and from it alone\nI quote) :\n\"Ah, welcome then that hour which bids thee lie\nIn anguish of thy last infirmity !\nWelcome the toss for ease, the gasp for air,\nThe visage drawn, and Hippocratic stare ;\nWelcome the darkening dream, the lost control,\nThe sleep, the swoon, the arousal of the soul ! \"\nDeath he did not dread. That is true; and his clear and happy\nfaith was the outcome entirely of his scientific researches. The years of\nstruggle and effort and systematic thought had begotten in him a con\nfidence as absolute and supreme as is to be found in the holiest martyr\nor saint. By this I mean that it was not possible for any one to have\na more absolute and childlike confidence that death was a mere\nphysical event. To him it was an adversity which must happen\nto the body, but it was not one of those evil things which may\nassault and hurt the soul.\nAn important and momentous event truly, even as birth is; a\n\f6 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART\ntemporary lapse of consciousness, even as trance may be ; a waking\nup to strange and new surroundings, like a more thorough emigration\nthan any that can be undertaken on a planet ; but a destruction or\nlessening of power no whit. Rather an enhancement of existence,\nan awakening from this earthly dream, a casting off of the trammels\nof the flesh, and putting on of a body more adapted to the needs\nof an emancipated spirit, a wider field of service, a gradual oppor\ntunity of re-uniting with the many who have gone before. So he\nbelieved, on what he thought a sure foundation of experience, and\nin the strength of that belief he looked forward hopefully to perennial\neffort and unending progress :\n\" Say, could aught else content thee ? which were best,\nAfter so brief a battle an endless rest,\nOr the ancient conflict rather to renew,\nBy the old deeds strengthened mightier deeds to do ?\"\nSuch was his faith : by this he lived, and in this he died. Religious\nmen in all ages have had some such faith, perhaps a more\nrestful and less strenuous faith ; but to Myers the faith did not\ncome by religion : he would have described himself as one who\nwalked by sight and knowledge rather than by faith, and his eager\nlife-long struggle for knowledge was in order that he might by no\nchance be mistaken.\nTo some, conviction of this kind would be impossible\u2014they are\nthe many who know not what science is ; to others, conviction of\nthis kind seems unnecessary\u2014they are the favoured few who feel\nthat they have grasped all needed truth by revelation or by intuition.\nBut by a few here and there, even now, this avenue to knowledge\nconcerning the unseen is felt to be open. Myers believed that\nhereafter it would become open to all. He knew that the multitude\ncould appreciate science no more, perhaps less, than they can\nappreciate religion ; but he knew further that when presently any\ntruth becomes universally accepted by scientific men, it will penetrate\ndownwards and be accepted by ordinary persons, as they now accept\nany other established doctrine, such as the planetary position of the\nearth in the solar system or the evolution of species, not because\nthey have really made a study of the matter, but because it is a\npart of the atmosphere into which they were born.\n\fXLII.] In Memory of F. W. H. Myers. 7\nIf continuity of existence and intelligence across the gulf of death\nreally can ever be thus proved, it surely is a desirable and worthy\nobject for science to aim at. There be some religious men of little\nfaith who resent this attempted intrusion of scientific proof into their\narena : as if they had a limited field which could be encroached upon.\nThose men do not realise, as Myers did, the wealth of their inheritance.\nThey little know the magnitude of the possibilities of the universe, the\nunimagined scope of the regions still, and perhaps for ever, beyond the\ngrasp of what we now call science.\nThere was a little science in my youth which prided itself upon being\npositive knowledge, and sought to pour scorn upon the possibility, say,\nof prayer or of any mode of communication between this world and a\npurely hypothetical other.

I say no word against the scientific men of\nthat day, to whom were opposed theologians of equal narrowness and\nof a more bitter temper. But their warlike energy, though it made\nthem effective crusaders, left their philosophy defective and their science\nunbalanced. It has not fully re-attained equilibrium yet. With Myers\nthe word science meant something much larger, much more compre\nhensive : it meant a science and a philosophy and a religion combined.\nIt meant, as it meant to Newton, an attempt at a true cosmic scheme.\nHis was no purblind outlook on a material universe limited and con\nditioned by our poor senses. He had an imagination wider than that\nof most men. Myers spoke to me once of the possibility that the parts\nof an atom move perhaps inside the atom in astronomical orbits, as the\nplanets move in the solar system, each spaced out far away from others\nand not colliding, but all together constituting the single group or system\nwe call the atom,\u2014a microcosm akin to the visible cosmos, which again\nmight be only an atom of some larger whole. I was disposed at that\ntime to demur. I should not demur now; the progress of science\nwithin the last year or two makes the first part of this thesis even\nprobable.

W. H. Myers. 11\n[Postscript to Dr. Lodge's Paper.]\nSir Robert EL Collins\u2014an early friend of Myers'\u2014sends me the\nfollowing sketch :\n\"I FIRST saw Frederic Myers in the early summer of 1864. He was\nleaning over the side of a steamer in the harbour of the Piraeus,\nreciting poetry to a companion. We became friends on the ship, and\ntravelled together to Messina, Palermo, Naples, and Rome. This was\nhis ' Hellenism ' period, and I have never forgotten his enthusiasm,\nwhether we walked in the country outside Messina and Palermo, where,\nhe said, all sights and sounds brought Virgil to his memory, or visited\nArt Galleries, where he would stand rooted before statues such as the\nFaun of Praxiteles.\n\"At his special desire, we bathed in the troubled waters between\nScylla and Charybdis.\n\"When, in 1867, I became tutor to the late Duke of Albany, Myers\nlearned to know the Duke, and the two remained firm and constant\nfriends till the latter's death. His In Memoriam notice of the Duke\nwill attest to this. He was at Windsor Castle at the time of Princess\nLouise's wedding, and wrote some lines on the event. I do not think\neither these lines, or a short poem he wrote by the Queen's request at\nthe time of the late Duke's confirmation, have been published.\n\"During the phase of mind under the influence of which Myers wrote\nSt. Paul, I had frequent opportunities of being with him, and was much\nstruck with the intensity of his feelings at this time. A common friend\nremarked that his face wore ' a chastened look.' He seemed to have\nthe power, if not of carrying his friends all the way with him in the\nspecial feelings by which he was himself swayed, at least of imbuing\nthem with something of his attitude of mind. That he was unconscious\nof the influence of his personality is shown by his ingenuously remark\ning to me once, that it was strange that we often seemed to undergo\nsimilar changes of thought at the same periods.\n\" His most striking characteristic, in my opinion, was the eagerness\nand ardour with which he identified himself with all matters great and\nsmall that had a real interest to the average human being ; while the\npower he possessed of investing such matters with fresh attractions, and\npresenting them in novel lights, furnished proof, if proof were needed,\nof his extraordinary force and genius.\n\"ROBERT H. COLLINS.\"\n\f12 In Memory of F. W. H. Myers. [PART\nOn Myers as a man of letters the following appreciation has been\nwritten at my request by my colleague, the Professor of\nLiterature in the University of Birmingham :\n\" IF students of literature hold resolutely by the touchstone of style, it\nis because they find in it a promise of all the major virtues, a sure mark\nof the distinguished mind. Amid to-day's welter of uncontrolled and\npurposeless verbiage, such work as that of Myers is doubly precious ;\nunimpaired by contact with what is weak and worthless in contemporary\nwriting, it not only shines in itself, but carries on the noble traditions\nof our literature. As a man of letters, his distinction was in part due\nto the breadth and refinement of his scholarship, which could suffer no\nconventional accent, since in his ears ever sounded the language of the\npoets who were his lifelong companions, and since he moved along the\ndifficult paths of philosophical speculation as one familiar with the high\nthings of the intellectual world.\n\" His style, always choice, always charged, even surcharged, with\nthought, kindled when it touched a subject near his heart into a flame\nof brilliance ; his phrases vibrated in unison with his feelings. Eminent\nas scholar, psychologist, poet, he has his place as a critic of poetry\nin the company of those whose altars smoke with a fire derived from\nHeaven. He took his readers captive, not only because his knowledge\nwas profound, his instinct unfailing, but because by reason of the\nemotional and imaginative sympathy with his author of which he was\ncapable, there is heard in him the note of an almost passionate appre\nciation, of which I believe the palmary example in our language is the\nEssay on Virgil. Myers claimed for poetry, as indeed for all high art\n\u2014and I do not think the future will disallow the claim\u2014that though\nits oracles are not those of a passionless reason or a studious enquiry,\nthey are none the less authentic revelations that well up from some\nunfathomed depth of being, the divine enclasping region where are\nwrought the warp and the woof of our mortal life and destiny\u2014\nNee morta.lt smaiis, adflata est numine quando Jam propi&re dei.

MACNEILE DIXON.\"\n\fXLII.] Myera'a Service to Psychology. 13\nII.\nFREDERIC MYERS'S SERVICE TO PSYCHOLOGY.\nBY PROFESSOR WILLIAM JAMKS.\nON this memorial occasion it is from English hearts and tongues\nbelonging, as I never had the privilege of belonging, to the immediate\nenvironment of our lamented President, that discourse of him as a\nman and as a friend must come. It is for those who participated in\nthe endless drudgery of his labours for our Society to tell of the high\npowers he showed there ; and it is for those who have something of\nhis burning interest in the problem of our human destiny to estimate\nhis success in throwing a little more light into its dark recesses. To\nme it has been deemed best to assign a colder task. Frederic Myers\nwas a psychologist who worked upon lines hardly admitted by the\nmore academic branch of the profession to be legitimate; and as for\nsome years I bore the title of ' Professor of Psychology,' the suggestion\nhas been made (and by me gladly welcomed) that I should spend my\nportion of this hour in defining the exact place and rank which we\nmust accord to him as a cultivator and promoter of the science of\nthe Mind.\nBrought up entirely upon literature and history, and interested at\nfirst in poetry and religion chiefly ; never by nature a philosopher\nin the technical sense of a man forced to pursue consistency among\neoncepts for the mere love of the logical occupation ; not crammed\nwith science at college, or trained to scientific method by any passage\nthrough a laboratory ; Myers had as it were to re-create his per\nsonality before he became the wary critic of evidence, the skilful\nhandler of hypothesis, the learned neurologist and omnivorous reader\nof biological and cosmological matter, with whom in later years we\nwere acquainted. The transformation came about because he needed\nto be all these things in order to work successfully at the problem\nthat lay near his heart ; and the ardour of his will and the richness\n\f14 Professor William James. [PART\nof his intellect are proved by the success with which he underwent\nso unusual a transformation.\nThe problem, as you know, was that of seeking evidence for human\nimmortality. His contributions to psychology were incidental to that\nresearch, and would probably never have been made had he not\nentered on it. But they have a value for Science entirely inde\npendent of the light they shed upon that problem; and it is quite\nfrom it that I shall venture to consider them.\nIf we look at the history of mental science we are immediately\nstruck by diverse tendencies among its several cultivators, the conse\nquence being a certain opposition of schools and some repugnance among\ntheir disciples. Apart from the great contrasts between minds that\nare teleological or biological and minds that are mechanical, between\nthe animists and the associationists in psychology, there is the entirely\ndifferent contrast between what I will call the classic-academic and the\nromantic type of imagination. The former has a fondness for clean\npure lines and noble simplicity in its constructions. It explains things\nby as few principles as possible and is intolerant of either nondescript\nfacts or clumsy formulas. The facts must lie in a neat assemblage, and\nthe psychologist must be enabled to cover them and ' tuck them in ' as\nsafely under his system as a mother tucks her babe in under the down\ncoverlet on a winter night. Until quite recently all psychology,\nwhether animistic or associationistic, was written on classic-academic\nlines. The consequence was that the human mind, as it is figured in\nthis literature, was largely an abstraction. Its normal adult traits were\nrecognised. A sort of sunlit terrace was exhibited on which it took its\nexercise. But where that terrace stopped, the mind stopped; and\nthere was nothing farther left to tell of in this kind of philosophy but\nthe brain and the other physical facts of nature on the one hand, and\nthe absolute metaphysical ground of the universe on the other.\nBut of late years the terrace has been overrun by romantic improvers,\nand to pass to their work is like going from classic to Gothic architec\nture, where few outlines are pure and where uncouth forms lurk in the\nshadows. A mass of mental phenomena are now seen in the shrubbery\nbeyond the parapet. Fantastic, ignoble, hardly human, or frankly non-\nhuman are some of these new candidates for psychological description.\nThe menagerie and the madhouse, the nursery, the prison, and the\n\fXLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 15\nhospital, have been made to deliver up their material. The world of\nmind is shown as something infinitely more complex than was sus\npected ; and whatever beauties it may still possess, it has lost at any\nrate the beauty of academic neatness.\nBut despite the triumph of romanticism, psychologists as a rule have\nstill some lingering prejudice in favour of the nobler simplicities.\nMoreover there are social prejudices which scientific men themselves\nobey. The word 'hypnotism' has been trailed about in the newspapers\nso that even we ourselves rather wince at it, and avoid occasions of its\nuse. 'Mesmerism,' 'clairvoyance,' 'medium,'\u2014Iwrrescimus references\/\u2014\nand with all these things, infected by their previous mystery-mongering\ndiscoverers, even our best friends had rather avoid complicity. For\ninstance, I invite eight of my scientific colleagues severally to come to my\nhouse at their own time, and sit with a medium for whom the evidence\nalready published in our Proceedings had been most noteworthy.\nAlthough it means at worst the waste of the hour for each, five of\nthem decline the adventure. I then beg the 'Commission' connected\nwith the chair of a certain learned psychologist in a neighbouring\nuniversity to examine the same medium, whom Mr. Hodgson and I\noffer at our own expense to send and leave with them. They also\nhave to be excused from any such entanglement. I advise another\npsychological friend to look into this medium's case, but he replies\nthat it is useless, for if he should get such results as I report, he would\n(being suggestible) simply believe himself hallucinated. When I\npropose as a remedy that he should remain in the background and take\nnotes, whilst his wife has the sitting, he explains that he can never\nconsent to his wife's presence at such performances. This friend of\nmine writes ex cathedra on the subject of psychical research, declaring\n(I need hardly add) that there is nothing in it; the chair of the psycho\nlogist with the Commission was founded by a spiritist, partly with a\nview to investigate mediums ; and one of the five colleagues who declined\nmy invitation is widely quoted as an effective critic of our evidence.\nSo runs the world away ! I should not indulge in the personality and\ntriviality of such anecdotes, were it not that they paint the temper of\nour time, a temper which, thanks to Frederic Myers more than to\nany one, will certainly be impossible after this generation. Myers was,\nI think, decidedly exclusive and intolerant by nature. But his keen\nness for truth carried him into regions where either intellectual or\n\f16 Professor William, James. [PART\nsocial squeamishness would have been fatal, so he 'mortified' his\namour propre, unclubbed himself completely, and became a model of\npatience, tact, and humility wherever investigation required it. Both\nhis example and his body of doctrine will make this temper the only\none henceforward scientifically respectable.\nIf you ask me how his doctrine has this effect, I answer : By\nco-ordinating ! For Myers' great principle of research was that in order\nto understand any one species of fact we ought to have all the species\nof the same general class of fact before us. So he took a lot of\nscattered phenomena, some of them recognised as reputable, others\noutlawed from science, or treated as isolated curiosities; he made\nseries of iiicm. filled in the transitions by delicate hypotheses or\nanalogies, and bound them together in a system by his bold inclusive\nconception of the Subliminal Self, so that no one can now touch one\npart of the fabric without finding the rest entangled with it. Such\nvague terms of apperception as psychologists have hitherto been satis\nfied with using for most of these phenomena, as ' fraud,' ' rot,'\n' rubbish,' will no more be possible hereafter than ' dirt ' is possible\nas a head of classification in chemistry, or 'vermin' in zoology.\nWhatever they are, they are things with a right to definite description\nand to careful observation.\nI cannot but account this as a great service rendered to Psychology.\nI expect that Myers will ere long distinctly figure in mental science as\nthe radical leader in what I have called the romantic movement.\nThrough him for the first time, psychologists are in possession of their\nfull material, and mental phenomena are set down in an adequate\ninventory. To bring unlike things thus together by forming series\nof which the intermediary terms connect the extremes, is a procedure\nmuch in use by scientific men. It is a first step made towards\nsecuring their interest in the romantic facts, that Myers should have\nshown how easily this familiar method can be applied to their study.\nMyers' conception of the extensiveness of the Subliminal Self quite\noverturns the classic notion of what the human mind consists in. The\nsupraliminal region, as Myers calls it, the classic-academic conscious\nness, which was once alone considered either by associationists or\nanimists, figures in his theory as only a small segment of the psychic\nspectrum. It is a special phase of mentality, tdeologically evolved for\nadaptation to our natural environment, and forms only what he calls\n\fXLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 17\na 'privileged case' of personality. The outlying Subliminal, according\nto him, represents more fully our central and abiding being.\nI think the words subliminal and supraliminal unfortunate, but they\nwere probably unavoidable. I think, too, that Myers's belief in the\nubiquity and great extent of the Subliminal will demand a far larger\nnumber of facts than sufficed to persuade him, before the next\ngeneration of psychologists shall become persuaded. He regards the\nSubliminal as the enveloping mother-consciousness in each of us, from\nwhich the consciousness we wot of is precipitated like a crystal. But\nwhether this view get confirmed or get overthrown by future inquiry,\nthe definite way in which Myers has thrown it down is a new and\nspecific challenge to inquiry. For half a century now, psychologists\nhave fully admitted the existence of a subliminal mental region, under\nthe name either of unconscious cerebration or of the involuntary life ;\nbut they have never definitely taken up the question of the extent of\nthis region, never sought explicitly to map it out. Myers definitely\nattacks this problem, which, after him, it will be impossible to ignore.\nIPhat is the precise constitution of the Subliminal\u2014such is the problem\nwhich deserves to figure in our Science hereafter as the problem of\nMyers ; and willy-nilly, inquiry must follow on the path which it has\nopened up. But Myers has not only propounded the problem defin\nitely, he has also invented definite methods for its solution. Post-\nhypnotic suggestion, crystal-gazing, automatic writing and trance-speech,\nthe willing-game, etc., are now, thanks to him, instruments of research,\nreagents like litmus paper or the galvanometer, for revealing what\nwould otherwise be hidden. These are so many ways of putting\nthe Subliminal on tap. Of course without the simultaneous work\non hypnotism and hysteria independently begun by others, he could\nnot have pushed his own work so far. But he is so far the only\ngeneralizer of the problem and the only user of all the methods ;\nand even though his theory of the extent of the Subliminal should\nhave to be subverted in the end, its formulation will, I am sure,\nfigure always as a rather momentous event in the history of our\nScience.\nAny psychologist who should wish to read Myers out of the pro\nfession\u2014and there are probably still some who would be glad to do so\nto-day\u2014is committed to a definite alternative. Either he must say\nthat we knew all about the subliminal region before Myers took it up,\n\f18 Professor William James. [PART\nor he must say that it is certain that states of super-normal cognition\nform no part of its content. The first contention would be too absurd.\nThe second one remains more plausible. There are many first hand\ninvestigators into the Subliminal who, not having themselves met with\nanything super-normal, would probably not hesitate to call all the\nreports of it erroneous, and who would limit the Subliminal to dissolutive\nphenomena of consciousness exclusively, to lapsed memories, sub\nconscious sensations, impulses and phobias, and the like. Messrs. Janet\nand Binet, for aught I know, may hold some such position as this.\nAgainst it Myers's thesis would stand sharply out. Of the Subliminal,\nhe would say, we can give no ultra-simple account : there are discrete\nregions in it, levels separated by critical points of transition, and no\none formula holds true of them all. And any conscientious psycholo\ngist ought, it seems to me, to see that, since these multiple modifica\ntions of personality are only beginning to be reported and observed\nwith care, it is obvious that a dogmatically negative treatment of them\nmust be premature, and that the problem of Myers still awaits us as\nthe problem of far the deepest moment for our actual psychology,\nwhether his own tentative solutions of certain parts of it be correct\nor not.\nMeanwhile, descending to detail, one cannot help admiring the great\noriginality with which Myers wove such an extraordinarily detached\nand discontinuous series of phenomena together. Unconscious cerebra\ntion, dreams, hypnotism, hysteria, inspirations of genius, the willing-\ngame, planchette, crystal-gazing, hallucinatory voices, apparitions of the\ndying, medium-trances, demoniacal possession, clairvoyance, thought-\ntransference\u2014even ghosts and other facts more doubtful\u2014these things\nform a chaos at first sight most discouraging. No wonder that\nscientists can think of no other principle of unity among them than\ntheir common appeal to men's perverse propensity to superstition. Yet\nMyers has^actually made a system of them, stringing them continuously\nupon a [perfectly legitimate objective hypothesis, verified in some cases\nand extended to others by analogy. Taking the name automatism\nfrom the phenomenon of automatic writing\u2014I am not sure that he\nmay not himself have been the first so to baptize this latter pheno\nmenon\u2014he made one great simplification at a stroke by treating\nhallucinations and active impulses under a common head, as sensory\nand motor automatisms. Automatism he then conceived broadly as a\n\fXLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 19\nmessage of any kind from the Subliminal to the Supraliminal. Afid he\nwent a step farther in his hypothetic interpretation, when he insisted\non 'symbolism' as one of the ways in which one stratum of our\npersonality will often interpret the influences of another. Obssessive\nthoughts and delusions, as well as voices, visions, and impulses, thus\nfall subject to one mode of treatment. To explain them, we must\nexplore the Subliminal ; to cure them we must practically influence it.\nMyers's work on automatism led to his brilliant conception, in 1891,\nof hysteria. He defined it, with good reasons given, as \" a disease of\nthe hypnotic stratum.\" Hardly had he done so when the wonderfully\ningenious observations of Binet, and especially of Janet in France, gave\nto this view the completest of corroborations. These observations have\nbeen extended in Germany, America, and elsewhere ; and although\nBinet and Janet worked independently of Myers, and did work far\nmore objective, he nevertheless will stand as the original announcer\nof a theory which, in my opinion, makes an epoch, not only in\nmedical, but in psychological science, because it brings in an entirely\nnew conception of our mental possibilities.\nMyers's manner of apprehending the problem of the Subliminal\nshows itself fruitful in every possible direction. While official science\npractically refuses to attend to Subliminal phenomena, the circles which\ndo attend to them treat them with a respect altogether too undiscrimi-\nnating\u2014every Subliminal deliverance must be an oracle. The result\nis that there is no basis of intercourse between those who best know\nthe facts and those who are most competent to discuss them. Myers\nimmediately establishes a basis by his remark that in so far as they\nhave to use the same organism, with its preformed avenues of ex\npression\u2014what may be very different strata of the Subliminal are\ncondemned in advance to manifest themselves in similar ways. This\nmight account for the great generic likeness of so many automatic\nperformances, while their different starting-points behind the threshold\nmight account for certain differences in them. Some of them, namely,\nseem to include elements of supernormal knowledge ; others to show a\ncurious subconscious mania for personation and deception ; others again\nto be mere drivel. But Myers's conception of various strata or levels\nin the Subliminal sets us to analyzing them all from a new point of view.\nThe word Subliminal for him denotes only a region, with possibly the\nmost heterogeneous contents. Much of the content is certainly rubbish,\n\f20 Professor William James. [PART\nmatted that Myers calls dissolutive, stuff that dreams are made of,\nfragments of lapsed memory, mechanical effects of habit and ordinary\nsuggestion ; some belongs to a middle region where a strange manu\nfacture of inner romances perpetually goes on ; finally, some of the\ncontent appears superiorly and subtly perceptive. But each has to\nappeal to us by the same channels and to use organs partly trained to\ntheir performance by messages from the other levels. Under these\nconditions what could be more natural to expect than a confusion,\nwhich Myers's suggestion would then have been the first indispensable\nstep towards finally clearing away.\nOnce more, then, whatever be the upshot of the patient work\nrequired here, Myers's resourceful intellect has certainly done a service\nto psychology.\nI said a while ago that his intellect was not by nature philosophic in\nthe narrower sense of being that of a logician. In the broader sense\nof being a man of wide scientific imagination, Myers was most\neminently a philosopher. He has shown this by his unusually daring\ngrasp of the principle of evolution, and by the wonderful way in which\nhe has worked out suggestions of mental evolution by means of bio\nlogical analogies. These analogies are, if anything, too profuse and\ndazzling in his pages; but his conception of mental evolution is more\nradical than anything yet considered by psychologists as possible. It\nis absolutely original; and, being so radical, it becomes one of those\nhypotheses which, once propounded, can never be forgotten, but soon\nor later have to be worked out and submitted in every way to criticism\nand verification.\nThe corner-stone of his conception is the fact that consciousness has\nno essential unity. It aggregates and dissipates, and what we call\nnormal consciousness,\u2014the ' Human Mind ' of classic psychology,\u2014is\nnot even typical, but only one case out of thousands. Slight organic\nalterations, intoxications and auto-intoxications, give supraliminal forms\ncompletely different, and the subliminal region seems to have laws in\nmany respects peculiar. Myers thereupon makes the suggestion that\nthe whole system of consciousness studied by the classic psychology is\nonly au extract from a larger total, being a part told-off, as it were, to\ndo service in the adjustments of our physical organism to the world of\nnature. This extract, aggregated and personified for this particular\npurpose, has, like all evolving things, a variety of peculiarities. Having\n\fXLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 21\nevolved, it may also dissolve, and in dreams, hysteria, and divers\nforms of degeneration it seems to do so. This is a retrograde process\nof separation in a consciousness of which the unity was once effected.\nBut again the consciousness may follow the opposite course and\nintegrate still farther, or evolve by growing into yet untried directions.\nIn veridical automatisms it actually seems to do so. It drops some of\nits usual modes of increase, its ordinary use of the senses, for example,\nand lays hold of bits of information which, in ways that we cannot\neven follow conjecturally, leak into it by way of the Subliminal. The\nulterior source of a certain part of this information (limited and per\nverted as it always is by the organism's idiosyncrasies in the way of\ntransmission and expression) Myers thought he could reasonably trace\nto departed human intelligence, or its existing equivalent. I pretend\nto no opinion on this point, for I have as yet studied the evidence with\nso little critical care that Myers was always surprised at my negli\ngence. I can therefore speak with detachment from this question and,\nas a mere empirical psychologist, of Myers's general evolutionary\nconception. As such a psychologist I feel sure that the latter is a\nhypothesis of first-rate philosophic importance. It is based, of course,\non his conviction of the extent of the Subliminal, and will stand or fall\nas that is verified or not ; but whether it stand or fall, it looks to me\nlike one of those sweeping ideas by which the scientific researches of\nan entire generation are often moulded. It would not be surprising\nif it proved such a leading idea in the investigation of the near future ;\nfor in one shape or another, the Subliminal has come to stay with us,\nand the only possible course to take henceforth is radically and\nthoroughly to explore its significance.\nLooking back from Frederic Myers's vision of vastness in the field\nof psychological research upon the programme as most academic\npsychologists frame it, one must confess that its limitation at their\nhands seems not only unplausible, but in truth, a little ridiculous.\nEven with brutes and madmen, even with hysterics and hypnotics\nadmitted as the academic psychologists admit them, the official out\nlines of the subject are far too neat to stand in the light of analogy with\nthe rest of Nature. The ultimates of Nature, \u2014her simple elements, if\nthere be such,\u2014may indeed combine in definite proportions and follow\nclassic laws of architecture ; but in her proximates, in her phenomena\n\f22 Professor William, James. [PART\nas we immediately experience them, Nature is everywhere gothic, not\nclassic. She forms a real jungle, where all things are provisional, half-\nfitted to each other, and untidy. When we add such a complex kind of\nsubliminal region as Myers believed in to the official region, we restore\nthe analogy ; and, though we may be mistaken in much detail, in a\ngeneral way, at least, we become plausible. In comparison with\nMyers's way of attacking the question of immortality in particular, the\nofficial way is certainly so far from the mark as to be almost pre\nposterous. It assumes that when our ordinary consciousness goes out,\nthe only alternative surviving kind of consciousness that could be\npossible is abstract mentality, living on spiritual truth, and communi\ncating ideal wisdom\u2014in short, the whole classic platonizing Sunday-\nschool conception. Failing to get that sort of thing when it listens to\nreports about mediums, it denies that there can be anything. Myers\napproaches the subject with no such a priori requirement. If he finds\nany positive indication of ' spirits,' he records it, whatever it may be,\nand is willing to fit his conception to the facts, however grotesque the\nlatter may appear, rather than to blot out the facts to suit his\nconception. But, as was long ago said by our collaborator, Mr.\nCanning Schiller, in words more effective than any I can write, if\nany conception should be blotted out by serious lovers of Nature,\nit surely ought to be the classic academic Sunday-school conception.\nIf anything is wrelikely in a world like this, it is that the next adjacent\nthing to the mere surface-show of our experience should be the realm\nof eternal essences, of platonic ideas, of crystal battlements, of absolute\nsignificance. But whether they be animists or associationists, a\nsupposition something like this is still the assumption of our usual\npsychologists. It comes from their being for the most part philoso\nphers in the technical sense, and from their showing the weakness\nof that profession for logical abstractions. Myers was primarily a\nlover of life and not of abstractions. He loved human life, human\npersons, and their peculiarities. So he could easily admit the possi\nbility of level beyond level of perfectly concrete experience, all\n' queer and cactus-like ' though it might be, before we touch the\nabsolute, or reach the eternal essences.\nBehind the minute anatomists and the physiologists, with their metallic\ninstruments, there have always stood the out-door naturalists with\ntheir eyes and love of concrete nature. The former call the latter\n\fXLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 23\nsuperficial, but there is something wrong about your laboratory-\nbiologist who has no sympathy with living animals. In psychology\nthere is a similar distinction. Some psychologists are fascinated by the\nvarieties of mind in living action, others by the dissecting out, whether by\nlogical analysis or by brass instruments, of whatever elementary mental\nprocesses may be there. Myers must decidedly be placed in the former\nclass, though his powerful use of analogy enabled him also to do work\nafter the fashion of the latter. He loved human nature as Cuvier\nand Agassiz loved animal nature ; in his view, as in their view, the\nsubject formed a vast living picture. Whether his name will have in\npsychology as honourable a place as their names have gained in the\nsister science, will depend on whether future inquirers shall adopt or\nreject his theories ; and the rapidity with which their decision shapes\nitself will depend largely on the vigour with which this Society\ncontinues its labour in his absence. It is at any rate a possibility, and\nI am disposed to think it a probability, that Frederic Myers will\nalways be remembered in psychology as the pioneer who staked out a\nvast tract of mental wilderness and planted the flag of genuine science\nupon it. He was an enormous collector. He introduced for the\nfirst time comparison, classification, and serial order into the peculiar\nkind of fact which he collected. He was a genius at perceiving\nanalogies ; he was fertile in hypotheses ; and as far as conditions\nallowed it in this meteoric region, he relied on verification. Such\nadvantages are of no avail, however, if one has struck into a false\nroad from the outset. But should it turn out that Frederic Myers\nhas really hit the right road by his divining instinct, it is certain\nthat, like the names of others who have been wise, his name will\nkeep an honourable place in scientific history.\n\f24 Professor Charles Richet.

Je trouvais en effet en lui non pas cette foi\naveugle et credule qui accepte toutes les fantaisies qu'une imagination\nsans critique severe inspire a ses enthousiastes ; mais le culte de la\nrigueur scientifique, 1'amour de la precision et une Erudition sure,\nsagace et perspicace. Aussi, toutes les fois que quelque phenomene\ninteressant dans le domaine des sciences occultes se presentait a moi,\nma premiere pensee etait-elle toujours : \" il faudra montrer cela a\nMyers, et savoir ce qu'il en pense.\"\nEt c'est ainsi que nous avons pu tous deux, en maintes occasions, a\nCalmar en Suede, en Saxe a Zwickau, a File Ribaud en France, a Paris\net a Cambridge, etudier ensemble quelques uns de ces phenomenes\ndeconcertants, compliques, qui par le melange du vrai avec le faux\nsemblent defier a la foi notre scepticisme et notre credulite.\nJe ne peux me rappeler sans emotion ces voyages, ces excursions\nchannantes oii 1'esprit de Myers se livrait tout entier. Attentif aux\nmoindres details, scrutant toutes les conditions experimentales, proposant\ndes dispositions ingenieuses, infatigable dans son activity a la recherche,\ninalterable dans sa confiance, il relevait mon courage souvent abattu,\net ne me permettait pas le desespoir ou le decouragement.

W. H. Myers and the S. P. R.\nIV.\nF. W. H. MYERS AND THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL\nRESEARCH.\nBY FRANK PODMORE.\nTHE Society for Psychical Research stands now at a critical point in\nits history. In Frederic Myers we have lost the last of the brilliant\ntrinity of Cambridge men who, in conjunction with Professor\nBarrett, founded the Society in 1882. Myers had of course made his\nname known in other fields before the Society was formed. His\nearly work, St. Paul, marked him out as a poet of high and original\nquality ; his essays on various literary themes, classical and modern,\nhad won for him the appreciation of scholars. Had he devoted himself\nto such pursuits there can be little doubt that he would have taken a\nhigh place in the Victorian age of English literature. But from early\nmanhood, or perhaps even from boyhood, he had been possessed with\nthat passion for the quest of immortality which he himself so well\ndescribed a few weeks before his death, in his memorial address on\nHenry Sidgwick. Prior to 1882 he had joined a small circle, of\nwhom Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick and Edmund Gurney were the\nother leading members, to investigate the phenomena of Spiritualism,\nand had later assisted at Professor Barrett's experiments in thought-\ntransference.\nFrom the foundation of the Society he threw all his energies into its\nwork, and after Edmund Gurney's death took a large part of the\nroutine duties in addition to the more congenial task of research.\nOnly those who have worked with him can know how heavy a burden\nof dull business details incidental to the management of an organisa\ntion like ours Myers cheerfully undertook to bear. To his activity in\nother directions the fifteen volumes of our Proceedings, to which he\ncontributed a preponderant share, bear eloquent witness. Again, though\nthe writing of the book was the task of Edmund Gurney, Myers played a.\n\f30 Frank Podmore. [PART\nconsiderable part in collecting the material for Phantasms ofthe Living, and\nwas largely responsible for the classification of the cases finally adopted.\nProbably the achievement which he would himself have regarded\nas most expressive of his personality, and which it seems likely will\nultimately be accepted by dispassionate critics as possessing the\nhighest permanent value, is his prolonged investigation into the\npowers and manifestations of what he has happily named the Sub\nliminal Self. Those who are unable to accept, without large\nqualification and deduction, the conclusions at which he has arrived\ncan yet unreservedly admire the characteristic qualities of his genius\nas here exhibited. We admire first his full and comprehensive survey\nof the whole field, and the amazing industry on which that com\nprehensive survey is based. As Edmund Gurney, himself a student\nof no mean capacity, once said to me, \"Whilst I am reading a book,\nMyers will master a literature.\"\nNext we note the extraordinary power of generalisation and classifi\ncation displayed. Professor James and Dr. Lodge have already described\nMyers' power of bringing together a vast assemblage of heterogeneous\nphenomena, pointing out their resemblances and analogies, and uniting\nthem in a common system. Not only did he thus bring the whole\nfield of enquiry\u2014a feat never attempted before\u2014into one comprehensive\nsurvey, but he carried his genius for classification into each particular\npart of the whole area. One of the most striking examples of this\nis afforded by his treatment of the material dealt with in Phantasms\nof the Living. We had placed before us an immense mass of apparently\ndiverse and heterogeneous observations\u2014dreams, visions, banshees,\ncorpse-lights, apparitions at death, fetches, doubles, and so on. The\nidea that all these various phenomena might be explained as due\nto the action of one mind upon another was the common property\nfrom the outset of those who had founded the Society. But it\nwas mainly owing to Myers that the idea was embodied in pro\nvisional categories and expressed by a notation hardly less com\npendious than that of chemistry. Briefly, the various phenomena were\ngrouped according to the state of agent or percipient, whether the one\nor the other were at the time of the occurrence in the normal waking\nstate, or asleep, or in trance, delirium, illness, or dying. Thus, when\na percipient in full possession of his waking faculties saw an apparition\nof a friend shortly before his death, the occurrence would be classed\n\fXLII.] F. W. H. Myera and the S. P. R. 31\nas Ad P\" (agent dying, percipient normal). If two persons sleep\ning in different rooms had a common dream, it would be noted as\nA' P' (agent sleeping, percipient sleeping). Other instances of the\nnotation will be remembered by all who are familiar with his\narticles on the Subliminal Self. It is to be noted that this power of\nsystematisation is of great practical value, even though later knowledge\nshould lead ultimately to quite other principles of arrangement. The\nmere ability to bring together a vast number of scattered observations,\nto point out some of their common characteristics, and to group them\nin a provisional scheme, is a sufficiently rare endowment, and, in\nan investigation like ours, of the highest possible utility. However\nincomplete and rough and ready the classification may be\u2014and Myers'\nschemes were by no means rough and ready\u2014it facilitates discussion\nand at once directs and stimulates further investigation.\nClosely connected with this power of classification was Myers' extra\nordinary fertility in suggestion and hypothesis. He was always seeing\nanalogies that previous observers had overlooked ; always bringing\ntogether from the furthest extremities of the field phenomena seemingly\nthe most diverse and demonstrating their essential resemblance. It\nis this faculty which makes his writings so perpetually suggestive and\nprovocative of thought. Those who differ most widely from some of\nhis conclusions cannot read his works without gaining innumerable\nhints for their guidance, glimpses of new order and harmony in the\nmaterial, and unimagined side-lights on old problems.\nOn Myers' gift of expression there is no need to dwell at length, in\nthis place least of all. Every volume of the Proceedings up to the\npresent time has been graced by some article from his pen. The most\nimpressive characteristic of his style, however, was not the splendour\nof the diction, the unequalled command over the literary stores alike of\nclassical and modern times, or even his rich imaginative endowment,\nbut his instinct on occasion for the inevitable word. In his more\nstudied utterances the language might seem at times overweighted\nby its own riches, by the abundance of the imagery, by the embar\nrassment of quotation and allusion. It was when he chose to be\nbrief, and of many good things to select only the best, that his\nstyle reached perhaps its highest point of effectiveness. It would be\ndifficult to surpass the art shown in the brief obituary notices of our\ndistinguished members which he contributed to the Journal of the\n\f32 Frank Podmore. [PART\nSociety ; in his replies to attack in outside periodicals ; and in some\nof the brief speeches at our meetings which were delivered to\nmeet an unrehearsed emergency. It is pertinent to remark in this\nconnection that our psychical vocabulary is largely owing to Myers ;\namongst his best known coinages are telepathy, supernormal, veridical.\nBut there is no need to dwell upon an aspect of his intellectual\nequipment which is familiar to us all. It is perhaps not so well\nrecognised that much of his work was scarcely less finished from\na scientific than from a literary standpoint. His conscientiousness\nas an artist was no doubt born with him ; his conscientious thorough\nness as an investigator was more gradually and laboriously acquired.\nThat he did display so much care and thoroughness in the tedious\ntask of investigation is, in a man of his temperament, not the least\nof his achievements.\nNo trait in his character was more conspicuous than the tolerance\nof opinions at variance with his own. His deference indeed to any\nexpression of adverse views was so marked that it can best be\ndescribed as docility. At our Council meetings, whilst few were so\nwell qualified to form an opinion, no one was more reluctant to\nseem to press his own. He was always open to suggestions from\nwhatever quarter. Part of this deference to any expression of opinion\nwas no doubt the simple outcome of a finished courtesy. But it had\nits roots, I think, deeper than this. It was most marked in his atti\ntude towards Henry Sidgwick. Myers was always ready to defer, and\nset us the example of deferring, to any opinion in matters of policy\nand conduct deliberately expressed by Professor Sidgwick. That\ninstant recognition of Sidgwick's true insight and sure judgment,\nthe truest and surest that any of us have known, was a tribute\nthat honoured the giver not less than the recipient.\nMyers' life, happy in its strenuous activities, was happiest of all\nperhaps in its conviction of another life to follow. Various symptoms\nhad given warning of his approaching end, and in November last,\nwriting to tell me that his own expectations of an early death had\nlately received medical confirmation, he spoke of himself as looking\nforward to the great change, and \"disposed to count the days till\nthe holidays.\"\n\fXLII.] F. W. H. Myers as a Man of Letters. 33\nV.\nF. W. H. MYERS AS A MAN OF LETTERS.\nBY WALTER LKAF, Litt.D.\nMYERS has a right to a place among the foremost writers of our day ;\nbut it seems hardly likely that this right will ever be duly recognised.\nWhether it be or not is a question with which we may concern our\nselves the less as it is certain that Myers himself did not greatly care.\nHe had within his grasp a high reputation as poet and essayist, and\ndeliberately sacrificed it to yet higher moral purposes. As years went\non he addressed himself less and less to men of letters, seeking ever\nmore consciously only the narrower audience which cared for the\none subject engrossing his own energies aud ambitions. Hence it\nis that to the world at large he is above all the author of St. Paul,\nhis least mature work ; and even the Times is capable of attributing\nto him what was written by his brother.\nUntil the publication of his nearly finished book on Human Person\nality and its Survival of Bodily Death, which will give him his final\nplace both as thinker and writer, nearly all his most mature and finest\nwork must be sought in the publications of the S.P.R. St. Paul is not\nforgotten, nor should it be ; for it is the work of a real poet. But it is\neasy to point out in it the obvious faults of youth\u2014too exuberant\nimagination, too gorgeous colouring, excessive love of resonant phrase\nand dominant harmony. One small volume contains all the published\nverse of the rest of his life ; but it shows how he had learnt to control\nthe temptations which tended to lead him astray, and guide his\nfertility towards one high aim. But it is in his later prose that this\npower of chastening and self-mastery is best seen, ever gaining ground\nand strengthening his style till he had attained something like perfection\nin his art. The poet's imagination is always there ; under his touch no\ndiscussion is arid ; flashes of insight light up alike the darkness of the\nsubliminal self and the dreary inanities of automatic writing. But\nC\n\f34 Dr. Walter Leaf. ' [PART\nno word is used merely for the effect of the moment ; all subserve the\nmoral end.\nIt is this ethical tendency which is the real bond between all his\npublished essays. His literary sense was almost abnormally acute ;\nbut his criticism always leads up to one great question, by which he\njudges alike Virgil and Mazzini, Victor Hugo, Tennyson, Marcus\nAurelius and Renan\u2014what attitude does the poet, the historian, the\nstatesman take towards the great riddle of life ? What sense has he of\nthe interaction of the world unseen in the things of this life 1 What\nlesson has genius, the \" uprush from the subliminal self,\" brought to\nman from behind the veil ? Even in the essay on Greek Oracles, which\nwas I believe the first published of his prose works, this desire for\nknowledge of the spiritual mysteries was the leading thought\u2014hardly\napparent to the careless reader at first, but clearly indicated in the\nnotes added to the later editions. It can be traced through the other\nessays Classical and Modern, till in the later volume, Science and a\nFuture Life, it is the avowed and only subject.\nSide by side with the ethical interest grows the scientific, till the\nthreefold cord of goodness, truth, and beauty is twined in harmony.\nEach reinforces the other. Myers became a finer artist not by seeking\n\" Art for art's sake,\" but by using his art for moral and scientific ends\nat once. Shallow thinkers may at times call him \" rhetorical,\" because\nthey do not reflect that rhetoric is after all the art of making other men\nshare one's faith. In this sense Myers was eminently \"rhetorical\";\nhe had to an extraordinary degree the gift of persuasiveness\u2014a gift\nwhich is probably even better displayed in his correspondence than in\nhis published work. His sympathetic and emotional nature went quick\nand straight to an opponent's point of view ; his skill in language could\npresent his own immediate object even to the coldest adversary as\neminently rational and desirable.\nBut in his best work there is little that even an enemy can call\nrhetorical. On the contrary, the most remarkable feature in it is,\nto my mind, the eminently workmanlike style in which he could, when\noccasion called for it, render a lucid statement of long and often\nrepellent points. Any one of his papers in our Proceedings will\nabundantly show this capacity. If I instance that on Pseudo-possession\n(in Vol. XV., pp. 384-415), it is not because of any special interest or\nmerit to be found in it, but because it is an average\u2014an almost every\n\fXLII.] F. W. H. Myers as a Man of letters. 35\nday\u2014specimen of his work, and (with the exception of his memoir\nof Henry Sidgwick) the last published during his life. It is a dis\ncussion of two French medical works, and opens with a studiously\nunadorned statement of facts. The luminous arrangement will\nhardly be appreciated by any who have not learnt by experience\nhow hard a task it is to set out clearly in short space essential\npoints picked out from a large mass of recorded observation. But\nwe have not gone far before Myers's humour begins to play round\nthe dull tale of hysteria. The \" tragedy of the free breakfast table \"\n(p. 389), is followed by the scene between \" the wily psychologist and\nthe common devil\" (p. 391); and among the pregnant and trenchant\ncriticisms of the doctrine of metempsychosis our eyes can hardly fail\nto twinkle as we hear how Victor Hugo \" took possession,\" as his own\nearlier avatars, \" of most of the leading personages of antiquity whom\nhe could manage to string together in chronological sequence.\" But\nthe whole essay is a masterpiece in scientific treatment of intractable\nmaterials. It contains, almost as an obiter dictum, Myers's last words\non telepathy (pp. 408-410), put with cogency to satisfy the most\nexigent logician ; and it is only on the last page that the burning moral\nconviction of which we have been half-conscious throughout is allowed\nto show itself openly in the closing chord of hope\u2014in the assurance\non which Myers was never tired of dwelling, that the human race is yet\nin infancy ; that we are \" the ancients of the world \" ; and that all this\nstrange farrago of hysteria, telepathy, automatism, and genius points\nforwards to the day when our successors \"will look on our religions with\npity and our science with contempt, while they analyse with a smile\nour rudimentary efforts at self-realisation, remarking 'how hard a\nthing it was to found the race of man.'\"\nIt is natural to compare Myers to Ruskin. Both devoted high gifts\nof genius to high moral ends. Much of Modern Painters has like faults\nwith St. Paul, and Ruskin like Myers learnt with years the need of\nself-suppression, though at the last he affected a simplicity which was\nsomewhat overdone. But in two points at least Myers was the finer\nartist, if indeed the two points are not really one. Myers has the\nfiner gift of humour. Readers of his published Essays only would\nhardly suspect how keen this was ; but it was never suppressed when\nhe wrote for our Proctfdings, or when he gave the S.P.R. or some other\ncongenial audience one of those wonderful addresses, delivered without\n\f36 Dr. Walter Leaf. [PART XLII.]\nnote or hesitation, which made us feel that he could, had he chosen,\nhave taken as high a rank among orators as among writers.\nAnd above all Myers was always preaching hope\u2014hope for man\nin the largest sense. There is in all he wrote not one touch of the\npeevish dissatisfaction of the prophet in an unworthy age which mars\nbeyond redemption so much of Ruskin's best work. Myers was\nthroughout masculine, and his ever-growing faith in man's life beyond\nthe grave raised him higher and higher above the petty discourage\nments which to Buskin seemed to make all his preaching hopeless even\nwhile it was being uttered. Myers worked with all his heart for men\nin the sure and certain hope that his labours, however slow advance\nmight seem, would not in the end be in vain.\nIt is less possible to appreciate Myers than even Ruskin without\ninsisting on this indissoluble interfusion of literature and morals.\nThe essay on his best-beloved Virgil is perhaps that of all his utter\nances which gives us most of his literary self. And the very heart\nof Virgil was to him in the famous speech of Anchises to Aeneas\nin Elysium (Aen. vi. 724-755), where the poet \" who meant, as\nWe know, to devote to philosophy the rest of his life after the\ncompletion of the Aeneid,\" propounds \"an answer to the riddle\nof the universe in an unexpectedly definite form.'' This ultimate\nsubordination of form to substance, of art to thought, is the whole\nstory of Myers's literary work. His art gained all the more because\nit was not pursued as a primary aim, and the obvious rewards of it\nwere little sought. Those only who followed the working of his\naspirations will adequately recognise his mastery, and see how for him\nstyle was but the expression of his inmost soul. In his wonderful\nfragments of Virgilian translation he reached his height. The poet\nwho was ever his truest ideal is transfused till the Roman and the\nEnglishman blend in one passion, human and divine, and the\ntriumphant song is taken up and proclaimed again after two thousand\nyears :\n\"To God again the enfranchised soul must tend,\nHe is her home, her Author is her end ;\nNo death is hers ; when earthly eyes grow dim\nStarlike she soars and Godlike melts in Him.\"\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nPART XLIII.\nMARCH, 1902.\nADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT,\nDR. OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.\nIN continuing to occupy the Chair for another year I am called upon\nto address the Society, and I do so under some disadvantage as having\nnot very recently had an opportunity for personal investigation into\nany important phenomenon about which the Society might be desirous\nof hearing. Accordingly it appears that I must make some general\nobservations about certain aspects of our work, and must attempt a\nreview of some portions of the situation.\nTo this end I propose to say something on each of the following\ntopics, though I shall by no means attempt to treat any of them ex\nhaustively :\u2014\n(1) The current explanations of trance lucidity and clairvoyance.\n(2) The strange physical phenomena sometimes accompanying\ntrance.\n(3) The views concerning these ultra-normal human faculties that\nmost appeal to me.\nFirst I will speak of trance lucidity and clairvoyance; whereby I\nintend just now to signify the fact, the undoubted fact as it appears\nto me, that under certain conditions the mouth can speak and the\nhand can write concerning things wholly outside the normal ken of\nthe mind usually controlling them. There are many questions of\ninterest about this process : the muscles of the mouth and hand appear\nD\n\f38 Address by the President, [PART\nto be stimulated, not from the brain centres dominated by the will, but\nfrom some more automatic and less conscious region of the brain, the\npart ordinarily supposed to be concerned in dreams and in hypnosis and\nautomatisms generally ; at any rate the normal customary mind of the\nwriter or speaker does not appear to be drawn upon. And yet there\nappears to be an operating intelligence, with a character and knowledge\nof its own. The questions of interest are, What is that operating\nintelligence ? and how is the extra knowledge displayed by it attained t\nThe chief customary alternative answers to the second question are\ntwo :\u2014\n(a) By telepathy from living people.\n(6) By direct information imparted to it by the continued conscious\nindividual agency of deceased persons.\nOn each of these hypothetical explanations so much has been said,\nfor and against, that perhaps it is unnecessary to recapitulate the\narguments ; especially since in that (in every sense) considerable part\nof the Proceedings which has been recently issued, Professor Hyslop\nhas dealt with the whole subject in an elaborate and careful manner;\nand, for my own part, I wish to express to him my thanks for the\ngreat care and labour he has bestowed upon this work, and for the\nvaluable contribution to Science which he has made. I know by\nexperience how troublesome it is, and how much time it consumes, to\ncomment with anything like fulness upon a long series of trance\nutterances relating to domestic matters about which strangers are\nnaturally quite uninformed and uninterested, and how difficult it is to\nmake appear in the printed record any trace of the human and living\ninterest sometimes vividly felt in the communications themselves by\nthose to whom all the little references and personal traits have been\nfamiliar from childhood. No doubt all such records must necessarily\nappear very dull to strangers, just as a family conversation overheard\nin a railway carriage, about \" Harry \" and \" Uncle Tom \" and \" Lucy \"\nand the rest, becomes, if long continued, oppressively wearisome.\nPatience, however, is one of the virtues which any one aspiring to be\na student has to learn. The bulk of Professor Hyslop's Report may\ndeter a good many people from even beginning to read it ; but I would\npoint out that a great deal of this bulk consists, not of the record itself,\nbut of comments on it, discussion of hypotheses concerning it, and a\nrecord of ingenious experiments undertaken, with the help of students\nand colleagues at Columbia University, for the purpose of elucidating\nit ; and while the complete record is there for any future student to\nexamine in detail, it is possible for any one skilled in the process of\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 39\nreading and judicious skipping to make himself acquainted with the\nmain features of Professor Hyslop's weighty and splendid piece of work\nwithout reading the whole volume.\nThis, however, is a digression.\nReturning to the subject of trance-lucidity generally, I wish to\nemphasise my conviction that an explanation based on telepathy as\na vera causa can be pressed too far. Telepathy is the one ultra-normal\nhuman faculty to the reality of which most of those who have\nengaged in these researches are prepared to assent ; that is, to assent\nto it as a bare fact, a summary of certain observed phenomena ; but\nits laws are unknown and its scope and meaning are not yet apparent.\nIt is probably but one of a whole series of scientifically unrecorded\nand unrecognised human faculties ; and it may turn out to be a mistake\nto attempt to employ it for the purpose of explaining a great number\nof other powers, which may be co-extensive or equipollent with itself;\nthough the attempt is a natural and proper one to make. A key must\nbe tried in all locks before we can be sure that it is not a master key ;\nand if it open only one or two, it represents so much gained.\nTelepathy itself, however, is in need of explanation. An idea or\nthought in the mind of one person reverberates and dimly appears\nin the mind of another. How does this occur? Is it a physical\nprocess going on in some physical medium or ether connecting the\ntwo brains ? Is it primarily a physiological function of the brain,\nor is it primarily psychological ? If psychological only, what does\nthat mean ; Perhaps it may not be a direct immediate action\nbetween the two minds at all ; perhaps there must be an intermediary,\n\u2014if not a physical medium, then a psychological medium,\u2014or con\nceivably a third intelligence or mind operating on both agent and\npercipient, or in communication with both.\nUntil we can answer these questions,\u2014and for myself I doubt if\nI have succeeded even in properly formulating them,\u2014 it is scarcely\npossible to regard telepathy, even from the sitter, as a legitimate\nexplanation of much of the clairvoyance or lucidity noticed in trance\nutterances. It may have to be assumed as the least strained explana\ntion, but it cannot with certainty be definitely asserted to be the\ncorrect one, even when it would easily cover the facts ; still less is it\npermissible, except as the vaguest and most groping hypothesis, to press\nit whenever convenient beyond the limits of experiment into an extra\npolated region, and to suppose that the minds of entirely disconnected\nand unconscious strangers at a distance are actually read : when it has\nnever been experimentally shown that they can be read at all.\n\f40 Address by the President, [PART\nThose strangers must be supposed to be less familiar with the\nconcerns of the person ostensibly represented as communicating through\nan entranced medium than he would be himself: why should we\nseek to go beyond the hypothesis of the agency of his in some way\npersisting intelligence and postulate the unconscious agency of outside\nor stranger persons ? The reasons for doing so are obvious and may\nbe cogent. It is easy to suppose that living people somewhere are\nacquainted each with one or two of the facts related by the\nclairvoyante : and these people exist ; whereas we are not by any\nmeans so sure of the continued existence of the deceased person who\nis the ostensible communicator. In fact, that is just the thing we\nshould like to be able to prove ; i.e., we should like to ascertain the\nactual truth concerning it, in a scientific way. Hence, again, I\nwould plead that those of our members who are convinced of con\ntinued existence, continued accessible existence, must try to be patient\nwith those of us who are not : impatience of any kind is out of place\nin this difficult quest, to which in all ages some part of humanity has\ndevoted itself with only personal and not universal satisfaction.\nOne hypothesis concerning the agency of unembodied spirits is that\nthey themselves temporarily occupy and animate some portion of the\nbody of the medium, and thereby control a sufficient part of the\nphysiological mechanism to convey the message they desire. The\nimpression which such a hypothesis as this makes upon us depends\nupon the view that we take of our own normal powers : it derives\nany prima facie reasonableness which it may possess from the theory\nthat we ourselves are mental entities, to which the names soul, spirit,\netc., have been popularly applied, who may be said to form or accrete,\nto inhabit and to control a certain assemblage of terrestrial atoms,\nwhich we call our bodies ; by means of which we, as psychological\nagents, can manage to convey more or less intelligible messages to\nother similarly clothed or incarnate intelligences : employing for that\npurpose such physical processes as the production of aerial vibrations,\nor the record left by ink traces upon paper.\nGiven that we are such meutal entities or psychological intelligences,\nwith the power of accreting and shaping matter by the act of feeding,\nwe must note in passing the important fact that the manufacture of\nour bodies, just spoken of, is a feat accomplished by life without mind,\nor at least with only sub-conscious mind : it is wholly beyond the power\nof our conscious mind to perform. Feed a child, and in due course\nunconsciously he becomes a man,\u2014a process beyond our control or\nunderstanding and wholly transcending our utmost executive skill.\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 41\nXote further that it is the same unconscious life, or part of the\nbody, or whatever is the proper term, which manages nearly all\nthe ordinary vital processes, and disposes of our food or gives us\nindigestion as it sees fit. This may seem a frivolous interlude, but\nit is important in connection with what follows. It is perhaps\nobviously important in connection with the whole business of the\ninter-action between mind and matter.\nThe hypothesis which seeks to explain the control of a medium's\nbody in trance by the agency of discarnate spirits, presumes that\nan elaborate machine like our bodies is capable of being occasionally\nused, not only by the mind or intelligence which manufactured it,\nso to speak, but temporarily and with difficulty by other minds or\nintelligences permitted to make use of it.\nThere are many difficulties here, and one of them is the assumption\nthat such other intelligences exist. But that I confess is to me not\na very improbable assumption ; for knowing what we already certainly\nknow of the material universe, of its immense scope, and the number\nof habitable worlds it contains (I do not say inhabited, for that the\nevidence does not yet reveal, but habitable worlds), realising also\nthe absurdity of the idea that our few senses have instructed us\nconcerning all the possibilities of existence which can be associated\nin onr minds with the generalised idea of \" habitable \" : perceiving\nalso the immense variety of life which luxuriates everywhere on this\nplanet wherever the conditions permit : I find it impossible to deny\nthe probability that there may be in space an immense range of life\nand intelligence of which at present we know nothing.\nIndeed, we ourselves are here on this planet and in this body for\nonly a few score revolutions of the earth round the sun : a thousand\nmonths exceeds what we call the \" lifetime \" of most of us. Where\nor what we were before, and where or what we shall be after, are\nquestions\u2014intimately and necessarily connected with each other as\nI believe, and as Plato taught, or allowed himself to appear to teach\u2014\nwhich as yet remain unanswered and as some think unanswerable.\nBut granting the possibility of a far greater and more widespread\nprevalence of life or mind than we have been accustomed to\neontemplate\u2014a prevalence as extensive, perhaps, as that of matter-\u2014\nwhat is the probability that the different classes of life and mind\ninterfere or inter-operate with each other ? There is no a priori\nprobability either way : it is purely a question for experience and\nobservation.\nBy observation we learn that as a general rule the visible and\nD2\n\f42 Address by the President, [PART\nsensible inhabitants of this world are to all appearance left to pursue\ntheir own policy undisturbed except by mutual collision, conflict or\nco-operation. How much of this isolation is apparent, and how much\nof it is real, I will not now inquire. I believe it would be admitted\nby philosophers that the appearance of isolation and independence\nwould be likely to present itself, even in a world where the reality\nwas guidance and control ; and certainly there have at all times\nbeen persons, called religious persons, who have felt more or less\nconscious of directing aid.\nSo it is with the material worlds :\u2014they sail placidly along in\nthe immensities of space, unimpeded and unhampered ; and pluming\nthemselves, perhaps, many of them\u2014those whose physical atmosphere\nhappens to be extra dense, or whose vision is otherwise limited\u2014on\nthe idea of complete, possibly they call it splendid, isolation. But\nwe who see further, through our clearer air,\u2014we, the heirs of\nAristarchus, Copernicus, and Galileo, who realise the orbs of space,\u2014\nknow that this apparent freedom is illusory : that all their motions\nare controlled by a force of which they are unconscious : and that\neven the outward appearance of isolation, or immunity from external\ndisturbance, is liable to be suddenly and violently terminated ; for\nwe know that in the depths of space, every now and then, a\nsubstantial encounter with some other similar body occurs\u2014a collision,\na catastrophe, and the blaze of what we call a new star : a phenomenon\nwhich by persons more closely concerned\u2014persons in the immediate\nneighbourhood, if such there be\u2014would rather be styled the destruction\nof an old one.i\nIn the psychological world have we ever experienced any such\nultra-normal phenomenon, any interference from without of our\nnormal and placid condition ; is there any record of an inrush of\nintelligence or of moral character beyond the standard of humanity,\nany avenue to information not normally accessible, any revolution\nin our ideas of God and of humanity and of the meaning of existence ?\nHave we ever welcomed or maltreated a prophet or a seer of the\nfirst magnitude 1 Or, on a lower level, have we ever had experience,\nin our family life, of any strange occurrence, apparently! hallucinatory\n'I am well aware that collision between solid habitable globes must be an\nextremely rare occurrence, and that collisions between widespread or nebulous\nmasses must be much commoner. But the meaning of what I am saying does\nnot depend on the habitability of the colliding masses, nor does it depend on the\nrelative frequency of collisions ; my point is to emphasise the rarity, but at the\nsame time the possibility, of the occurrence.\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 43\nbut yet significant, any vision or voice or communication from friends\nbeyond the normal range, or, it may be, from friends beyond the\nveil? Or, to go lower down still, have we ever witnessed any\nmovement of material objects which by known causes or by normal\ninhabitants of this planet have not been moved ?\nIt is a question of evidence whether such things have occurred ;\nand opinions differ. For myself, I think they have. Part of the\nextra difficulty of accepting evidence for any unusual phenomena\nis the a priori notion that such occurrences are contrary to Natural\nLaw, and are therefore impossible. We cannot, however, clearly\ntell that they are contrary to natural law ; all we can safely say is\nthat they are contrary to natural custom ; or, safer still, that they\nare contrary or supplementary to our own usual experience. That\nlast statement is safe enough ; but between that and the adjective\n\"impossible,\" or the equivalent phrase \"contrary to the order of\nNature,\" there is a vast and unfillable gap.\nWhence, then, arises the antagonism\u2014the inveterate and, let us\nhope, expiring antagonism\u2014between orthodox science and the evidence\nthat humanity has at different times adduced, the evidence which\nour Society has conscientiously worked at, that such occasional\nirruptions do occur? It arises, I think, because Science has a horror\nof the unintelligible : it can make nothing of a capricious and dis\norderly agent, and it prefers to ignore the existence of any such.\nIt is accustomed to simplify its problems by the method of abstraction\n\u2014that powerful practical method of ignoring or eliminating any\ncauses which are too embarrassing, too complex or too trivial, to be\ntaken into account. And by a long course of successful ignoration\nit may have acquired a habit of thinking that it can actually exclude,\ninstead of only abstract, these disturbing causes. That, however, is\nbeyond its power. Abstraction is a most useful process, but it can\nonly exclude from consideration ; it cannot really exclude from the\nuniversei anything too complex or too apparently disorderly. Of\ncourse there is no real hesitation on the part of any one to admit\nsuch a statement as that; but nevertheless a certain amount of\nexclusion\u2014exclusion from its own experimental area\u2014science has\nfound it possible to exert : and it has exercised this exclusion. If\ndisturbances were frequent, trustworthy science would be almost\nimpossible ; life in the laboratory would be like that depicted by the\nauthor of Prehistoric Peeps, where long-necked reptiles assist at every\nentertainment.\n'James Ward, Naturalism and Aynosticifim, vol. i , p. 77-\n\f44 Address by the President, [PART\nSo also a little mischief or malice might cause trouble in any\nscientific laboratory. Introduce a spider or other live animal into\nthe balance or other delicate apparatus of the physicist, and he will\nfor a time be thrown into confusion. Something capricious and\ndisorderly has entered, and spoils everything. This is just the sort\nof annoyance which a scientific man would feel if suddenly introduced\ninto a traditional seance in full activity. It would, however, be open\nto a first-rate experimentalist, even if a spider were a perfectly new\nexperience to him, to catch it and tame it and get it to spin webs\nfor his further instrumental convenience ; but usually it would be\nejected as too confusing, and its study would be left to the biologists.\nIf biologists did not exist, if the live beast were the first ever\nexperienced, and if, subsequent to the confusion, it escaped, it is\ndifficult to see how a narrative of the experience could be received\nby any scientific society to which it was recounted, except with\nincredulity, more or less polite.\nSo, I conceive, could a human being, looking down on an ant\nworld, inflict catastrophe and work miracles of a discomposing\ncharacter. I suppose that the ordinary ant in populous countries\nmust already have been liable to such irruptions and disturbance of\nits economy in past history, and may be thought to have accumulated\nand handed down some legends of such occurrences ; but to ants\nin unexplored countries, the achievements of some shipwrecked mariner\nmight come as a novel and incredible experience. And it may be\nnoted that the performances of humanity could be beyond the powers\nof the ant community, not only in magnitude, but in kind. For\ninstance, human beings might administer chemicals, or electric shocks,\nor sunlight concentrated by a lens.\nNow, by far the greater number of the physical phenomena which\nare asserted to take place in the presence of a medium involve\nnothing in themselves extraordinary : the production of scent, for\ninstance, the introduction of flowers and other objects, movements\nof furniture, the impress on photographic plates, are all of a nature\nthat can easily be managed by normal means, given time and oppor\ntunity ; and the only thing requiring explanation is how they are\nmanaged under the given conditions, more or less stringently devised\nto prevent their normal occurrence. This is a familiar old battle\nground, at which we glance and pass on.\nBut there is a residue of traditional physical phenomena which\ninvolve an effect beyond ordinary human power to accomplish. For\ninstance, the asserted resistance of the human skin and nerves to fire,\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 45\nusually though not always when under religious emotion or in some\ntrance state ; or the extraction of a solid object from a permanently\nclosed box ; or, what is much more commonly asserted than the other\ntwo, the materialisation or appearance of temporary human forms.\nI confess that I myself have never seen any of these things achieved\nunder satisfactory conditions, but the evidence of Sir William Crookes\nand others for certain of them is very detailed ; and it is almost as\ndifficult to resist the testimony as it is to accept the things testified.\nMoreover, some in this audience must imagine themselves perfectly\nfamiliar with all these occurrences.\nLet us therefore see whether, in the light of our present knowledge\nof Physics, they are wholly impossible and absurd, so that no testimony\ncould produce any effect on our incredulity ; or whether we may\ncomplacently inquire into the evidence, and be prepared to investigate\nany given case of their occurrence; with care and due scepticism\nundoubtedly, but not with fixed and impervious minds.\nOne of the three instances quoted seems in some respects the\nsimplest and most definite, inasmuch as it keeps off the less familiar\nground of physiology and biology and touches only on physics. I\nmean the phenomenon commonly spoken of as the \"passage of\nmatter through matter,\"\u2014the passage or leakage of one inorganic solid\nthrough another, without damage or violence. Asserted instances of\nthis are such as the tying or untying of knots on an endless string, the\nextraction of a billiard ball from a permanently closed shell, and\nthe linkage together of two closed rings. I have never seen a trust\nworthy instance of any of these occurrences. I know of rings being\nput over things apparently too large\u2014a ring on the stem of a wineglass,\nfor instance, or on the leg of a round table, or on a man's wrist,i\u2014but\nI have never seen a permanent and undeniable instance of what may\nbe termed a physical miracle ; and I am not aware that there is such a\nthing on view in the world as, for instance, the linkage of unjoined\nrings of different kinds of wood : though perhaps the skill of the\nbotanist or tree fancier might manage to accomplish this by constrained\ngrowth under favourable conditions. I assume, however, that any\nnatural mode of doing it could be detected by proper botanical\nexamination of the result.\n'The iron ring on Husk's wrist being believed by Dr. George Wyld to be\nmiraculously small, i.e. too small to have ever gone over the hand ; see Pro-\nctedingt S.P.R., vol. III., p. 460, for an account of an investigation of this\nphenomenon by Sir William Crookes, Mr. Victor Horsley, and others, who con\ncluded that the ring might have come into the position in which they found it by\nknown natural forces.\n\f46 Address by the President, [PART\nA couple of rings of unjoined leather, cut out of a single skin, have\nbeen shown linked together ; but this linkage can be managed by\ntaking advantage of the thickness of the skin and by judicious cutting.\nAn assemblage of wineglass and egg-cup stems, packed through a\nhole in a piece of wood, has been produced in Berlin, and has\nbeen kindly lent for our inspection ; but though this is asserted to\nhave been produced under supernormal conditions, it is certainly\nonly of the nature of a moderately ingenious mechanical contrivance\ninvolving skilled and deceptive construction. A similar object, con\nsisting of a wooden ring on the neck of a glass vase, recently con\nstructed (quite normally) in Sir William Crookes's laboratory, I am\nalso permitted to exhibit.\nBut concerning the abnormal \" passage of matter through matter,\" I\nam not aware that Sir William Crookes has ever testified to any\ninstance of it ; the only scientific evidence that I am acquainted with\nwas that given by Professor Zollner, which, though extremely curious\nand puzzling and detailed, does not leave a feeling of conviction on the\nunprejudiced mind.\nAccordingly, the simplest thing for me, or any other scientific man\nat the present day, is to treat the case of matter through matter as\nnot only unproven but as impossible, and to decline to consider it.\nNevertheless, so many extraordinary things have happened that I\nwould not feel too certain that we may not some day have to provide\na niche for something of this kind. If so, one hardly likes to suggest\nthat the recently-discovered probably complex structure of the material\natom, with interspaces very large in proportion to the aggregate bulk\nof its actual constituents, may have to be appealed to, in order to\nexplain the hypothetical interpenetration of two solids. At present,\nhowever, the difficulties of any such hypothesis are enormous, and I\nconfess myself an entire sceptic as to the occurrence of any such\nphenomenon, and should require extremely cogent evidence to\nconvince me.\nBut it may be said, Do I find movements of untouched objects, or\ndo I find materialisations, any easier of belief? Yes, I do. I am\ndisposed to maintain that I have myself witnessed, in a dim light,\noccasional abnormal instances of these things ; and I am certainly\nprepared to entertain a consideration of them.\nSuppose an untouched object comes sailing or hurtling through the\nair, or suppose an object is raised or floated from the ground, how are\nwe to regard it ? This is just what a live animal could do, and so the\nfirst natural hypothesis is that some live thing is doing it; (a) the\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 47\nmedium himself, acting by trick or concealed mechanism ; (6) a\nconfederate,\u2014an unconscious confederate perhaps among the sitters :\n(<) an unknown and invisible live entity other than the people present.\nIf in any such action the ordinary laws of nature were superseded,\nif the weight of a piece of matter could be shown to have disappeared,\nor if fresh energy were introduced beyond the recognised categories\nof energy, then there would be additional difficulties ; but hitherto\nthere has been no attempt to establish either of these things. Indeed\nit must be admitted that insufficient attention is usually paid to this\naspect of ordinary commonplace abnormal physical phenomena. If a\nheavy body is raised under good conditions, we should always try to\nascertain (I do not say that it is easy to ascertain) where its weight\nhas gone to ; that is to say, what supports it, what ultimately supports\nit. For instance, if experiments were conducted in a suspended room,\nwould the weight of that room, as ascertained by an outside balance,\nremain unaltered when a table or person was levitated inside it 1\nor could the agencies operating inside affect bodies outside ?\u2014questions\nthese which appear capable of answer, with sufficient trouble, in an\norganised psychical laboratory : such a laboratory as does not, I\nsuppose, yet exist, but which might exist, and which will exist in the\nfuture, if the physical aspect of experimental psychology is ever to\nbecome recognised as a branch of orthodox physics.\nOr take materialisations. I do not pretend to understand them,\nbut, as I have hinted in an earlier part of this Address, if ever genuine\nand objective, they may after all represent only a singular and\nsurprising modification of a known power of life. Somewhat as a\nmollusc, or a crustacean, or a snail can extract material from the water\nor from its surroundings wherewith to make a shell, or\u2014a closer\nanalogy\u2014just as an animal can assimilate the material of its food\nand convert it into muscle, or hair, or skin, or bone, or feathers\u2014a\nprocess of the utmost marvel, but nevertheless an everyday occurrence,\n\u2014so I could conceive it possible, if the evidence were good enough,\nthat some other intelligence or living entity, not ordinarily manifest\nto our senses, though possibly already in constant touch with our\nphysical universe by reason of possessing what may be called an\netherial body, could for a time utilise the terrestrial particles which\ncome in ita way, and make for itself a sort of material structure\ncapable of appealing to our ordinary senses. The thing is extremely\nunlikely, but it is not altogether unimaginable. Nor is it physically\nimpossible that some of these temporary semi-material accretions might\nbe inadequate to appeal to our eyes and yet be of a kind able to\n\f48 Address by the President, [PART\nimpress a photographic plate ; but here I confess that the evidence,\nto my mind, wholly breaks down, and I have never yet seen a\nsatisfying instance of what is termed a spirit photograph ; nor is it\neasy to imagine the kind of record, apart from testimony, which in\nsuch a case would be convincing ; unless -such photographs could be\nproduced at will.\nThe evidence for photographs of invisible people which we some\ntimes hear adduced as adequate is surprisingly feeble. For instance,\nin a recent anonymous and weak book, said to be written by a\nmember of this Society, two such photographs are reproduced which\nare said to have been obtained under what are considered crucial\nconditions ; but the narrative itself at once suggests a simple trick\non the part of the photographer, viz., the provision of backgrounds\nfor sitters with vague human forms all ready depicted on them in\nsulphate of quinine.\nThe ingenious and able impositions of a conjurer are causes\nverissimce, and full allowance must be made for them. Some of the\nphysical phenomena which I have adduced as among those pro\nclaimed to have occurred, such as apporis, sceut, movement of objects,\npassage of matter through matter,i bear a perilous resemblance to\nconjuring tricks, of a kind fairly well known ; which tricks if well\ndone can be very deceptive. Hence extreme caution is necessary,\nand full control must be allowed to the observers,\u2014a thing which\nconjurers never really allow : I have never seen a silent and genuinely-\ncontrolled conjurer : and in so far as mediums find it necessary to\ninsist on their own conditions, so far they must be content to be\ntreated as conjurers. Honest and good people are often the most\nreadily deceived, especially by protestations and by injured innocence :\nso certain Members and Associates of this Society must be good enough\nto pardon the rest of us for being, as they think, stupidly and absurdly\nsceptical about the reality of many phenomena in which they themselves\nstrongly believe. \"Facts are chiels that winna ding,\" says Robert\nBurns. So is belief. One cannot coerce belief. And it is difficult\nsometimes to adduce satisfying reasons for either the faith or the\nincredulity that is in us on any particular topic.\nOne is frequently asked by casual and irresponsible persons : Do\nyou believe in so and so ? usually : Do you believe in ghosts ?\u2014a question\nwhich ordinarily has no meaning in the mind of the asker, and to\nA technical phrase which I do not justify and do not trouble to improve upon\nuntil convinced of the genuineness of the kind of occurrence intended by that\nrase.\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 49\nwhich a categorical reply, either yes or no, would convey no real\ninformation. The best answer to such a question is that belief is not\nour business, but that investigation is ; and if any answer beyond that\nis to be given to a stranger, it must take the form of a question\nasking for a definition of the terms used,\u2014a stage beyond which\nthe casual inquirer can rarely go.\nBut suppose he can, and is not a flippant inquirer, with an eye\nto ridicule, or a comic article in the Press. This Society, for\ninstance, is not in the position of a casual and irresponsible inquirer;\nalmost every grade of opinion, and probably almost every grade of\nintelligence, exists among its members ; indeed it would be only\nwholesome in the present state of our knowledge if each one of us\nheld a different shade of opinion. Moreover, some of our members\nmust have devoted the greater part of a lifetime to the subject, and\nmust be far more experienced than myself; but still if any one\ncares to hear what sort of conviction has been borne in upon my\nown mind, as a scientific man, by some 20 years' familiarity with\nthose questions which concern us, I am very willing to reply as\nfrankly as I can.\nFirst, then, I am, for all personal purposes, convinced of the\npersistence of human existence beyond bodily death ; and though\nI am unable to justify that belief in a full and complete manner,\nyet it is a belief which has been produced by scientific evidence;\nthat is, it is based upon facts and experience, though I might find it\nimpossible to explain categorically how the facts have produced that\nconviction. Suffice it to say for the present that it is not in a simple\nand obvious way, nor one that can be grasped in an hour or two,\nexcept by those who have seriously studied the subject, and are con\nsequently equally entitled to an opinion of their own.\nFor if asked : Do I associate physical movements and other physical\nphenomena with the continued existence of deceased persons 1 I\nmust answer I do not. The phenomena always occur in the presence\nof the living, and the natural supposition at first is that the living\nin some unknown way produced them ; that, in so far as they are\nnot tricks, they represent an unexpected and unrecognised extension of\nhuman muscular faculty ;\u2014a faculty which, by the way, though we are\nwell accustomed to it, is itself, in its quite normal manifestations,\na most noteworthy phenomenon, and philosophically considered of\nextreme significance; though it would take too long to bring out\nthe full meaning of what I here suggest. Suffice it to say that by\nthe action of live things the ordinary processes of the degradation\n\f50 Address by the President, [PART\nor dissipation of energy can be diverted or suspended or reversed 1 ;\nweights can be raised which inorganically would have fallen ; rivers\ncan be deflected, and the face of the earth changed ; and, most\nsurprising of all, a conclave of persons can sit and decide, or to all\nappearance decide, whether a certain thing shall happen or shall not.\nIf pressed, I must confess that I do not see how the hypothesis of\nthe continued existence of human personalities, so long as they are\ndisconnected with bodies and muscles, is any real help in explaining\nultra-normal physical movements ; except that since .the movements\nshow traces of what we ordinarily speak of as will and intelligence,\nthey do suggest the agency nfjivn tihingi jif snmn kind.\nBut then I see no reason\/#jTiKmrcihg'<Sfep0lsjbilities of existence\u2014\nit may be of inter-planepry .05 .of ejctrasoaciah existence \u2014to those\nfriends of ours who have\\recBntl\\r fnnaWtea^lhis\/ planet.\n\u00ab jf\nEliminating physical pheVqmefta ther^pje^w the present, suppose\nthat I am asked further : Do yoft^wtsitterthat trance-utterances are\never due to the agency of departed persons ? I am bound to say that,\nas regards the content or intelligence of the message, I have known\ncases which do very strongly indicate some form of access to a\npersistent portion of the departed personality; and occasionally, though\nrarely, the actual psychical agency of a deceased person is indicated.\nBut if by agency my hearers understand me to mean in all cases\nconscious agency, direct communication with full consciousness of what\nis going on, they must allow me to explain that of that in most cases\nI am extremely doubtful. It seems to me much more often like a\ndream intelligence or a sub-conscious part of the persistent mind that\nwe have access to, not a conscious part. It appears to me still a true\nkind of telepathy ; and telepathy from, as well as to, a sub-conscious\nstratum. This use of the term is an extension of its ordinary one,\nbut it is an extension which appears to be required. (See Mrs.\nSidgwick, Proceedings S.P.R., vol. XV., pp. 17, 18.)\nThe medium when awakened does not usually remember, is not\nreally conscious of, the communication which has been spoken or\nwritten : not until he or she returns to the state of trance. Nor\nshould I expect the ostensible communicator, so long as he is anything\nlike ourselves, to remember or to be properly conscious of what has\nbeen, as it were, drawn from his memory, until he too returns once\nmore into the same dream-like or semi-conscious or sub-conscious con\ndition. There may be all grades of recollection, however; analogous\n'Witness \"Maxwell's demons\" in theory, and nitrifying bacteria in what is\nnow accepted as botanictil fact.\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 51\nto the various grades of reminiscence of ordinary dreams, as and\nafter we wake.\nMoreover, it appears as if the portion of the deceased person which,\non this hypothesis, is once more in a manner materialised for us,\nand with which we hold communication, is sometimes but a very\nfragmentary portioni; so fragmentary that if at some other or at the\nsame time the same ostensible individual is operating through another\nmedium elsewhere, the two portions are, I believe, sometimes unaware\nof what each is, so to speak, saying, and are liable to deny each other's\ngenuineness. Occasionally, however, in my experience, there has been\nan indication that the bare fact of simultaneous communication through\ntwo mediums is known or felt ; and I urge that more experiments and\nobservations are needed in this direction, which will, I hope, prove\nan extremely helpful line of research if only it can be worked. The\ndifficulties are obviously great and the opportunities few. Anyhow\nit will be agreed that this double communication from ostensibly one\nintelligence, with the contents of each message unknown to the other\ncommunicator, is an interesting and instructive phenomenon, if it is\nreal, and one that fits in excellently with Mr. Myers' luminous hypo\nthesis of the subliminal self.\nFor, to tell truth, I do not myself hold that the whole of any one\nof us is incarnated in these terrestrial bodies ; certainly not in child\nhood ; more, but perhaps not so very much more, in adult life. What\nis manifested in this body is, I venture to think likely, only a portion,\nan individualised, a definite portion, of a much larger whole. What\nthe rest of me may be doing, for these few years while I am here,\nI do not know : perhaps it is asleep ; but probably it 'is not so entirely\nasleep with men of genius ; nor, perhaps, is it all completely inactive\nwith the people called \"mediums.\"\n(Imagination in science is permissible, provided one's imaginings\nare not treated as facts, nor even theories, but only as working\nhypotheses,\u2014a kind of hypothesis which, properly treated, is essential\nto the progress of every scientific worker. Let us imagine, then,\nas a working hypothesis, that our subliminal self\u2014the other and\n'Probably these limitations are all due to imperfections of the physical\nmechanism, or rather to the difficulty of controlling it under the given circum-\nrtances,\u2014\n(a) of controlling it at all,\n(b) of controlling it solely, i.e. unconfused with other influences,\n(c) of controlling it continuously, without breaks analogous to wandering of\nattention ;\nl>ut whatever the limitations are due to, they are interesting and instructive.\n\f52 Address by the President, [PART\ngreater part of us\u2014is in touch with another order of existence, and\nthat it is occasionally able to communicate, or somehow, perhaps\nunconsciously, transmit to the fragment in the body, something of the\ninformation accessible to it. This guess, if permissible, would contain\na clue to a possible explanation of clairvoyance. We should then be\nlike icebergs floating in an ocean, with only a fraction exposed to aun\nand air and observation : the rest\u2014by far the greater bulk\u2014sub\nmerged in a connecting medium, submerged and occasionally in sub\nliminal or sub-aqueous contact with others, while still the peaks,\nthe visible bergs, are far separate.i\n\" We feel that we are greater than we know.\"\nOr, reversing the metaphor, we might liken our present state to\nthat of the hulls of ships submerged in a dim ocean among many\nstrange beasts, propelled in a blind manner through space ; proud,\nperhaps, of accumulating many barnacles as decoration ; only\nrecognising our destination by bumping against the dock wall ;\nand with no cognisance of the deck and the cabins, the spars and\nthe sails, no thought of the sextant and the compass and the captain,\nno perception of the look-out on the mast, of the distant horizon,\nno vision of objects far ahead, dangers to be avoided, destinations\nto be reached, other ships to be spoken with by other means than\nbodily contact,\u2014a region of sunshine and cloud, of space, of perception,\nand of intelligence, utterly inaccessible to the parts below the\nwaterline.\nIncidentally, if one were permitted rather rashly to speculate, it\nmight be suggested that most of the disputes about re-incarnation\ncould be hypothetically reconciled by this hypothesis of the subliminal\nself. Not the same individual portion need perhaps be incarnated\nagain, but another phase of the whole ; and so gradually each aspect\nmight acquire the experience, the submerged experience, so to speak,\nand the practical training, obtainable by incarnate life on one of\nthe vagrant lumps of matter known as habitable planets.\nSo also are the difficulties of birth and recent childhood, recent\nnonentity, minimised by the subliminal self hypothesis. The suggestion\nis an obvious one that as a body becomes gradually ready and the\nchild grows, so more and more of the total personality leaks, as it\nwere, into it, until we get the adult individual as we know him :\nsometimes more of the whole\u2014what we call a great man : sometimes\ni Perhaps it may not be superfluous to say that an iceberg floats with only about\ni5, t h of its bulk above water.\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 53\nless\u2014a deficient man. And death is the rejoining and re-uniting\nof the temporarily almost dissevered and curiously educated fraction\nto the whole. Shall such a mental entity be only capable of complete\nand thorough incarnation ? Shall it never in some dreamy and\nsemi-conscious or unconscious state influence another body, or take\nany physical part in the scenes in which for a time it was so interested f\nThe opportunities appear to be scarce, and the phenomenon is rare ;\nbut who is to say that it is non-existent; and who shall say that\nthe fact that the communications are vague, hesitating, uncertain,\nsometimes mistaken, and never complete,\u2014though no doubt there\nare several grades towards completeness,\u2014goes to prove that the\nresidue is not genuine? It is occasionally almost like trying to hold\na conversation with some one in his sleep : it is hard to judge of a\npersonality by that sort of test. Indeed, there are all grades of\nbrilliancy even in our own waking complete selves : not always are\nwe at our best; and odd conceptions might be formed of our intelli\ngence if a stranger judged us by our remarks on the weather or the\ncrops. I am told that Browning spoke in quite a commonplace\nmanner concerning the weather.\nHow often have we not found that the utterances of some eminent\nperson, even in his full bodily manifestation, do not come up to-\nonr idea of him : an idea perhaps based on an acquaintance with a\nrecord of his more fully developed personality in moments of\ninspiration. There is a tale concerning Tennyson which I recently\nheard ; it may not be true, but it is quite possible. A lady, a\nworshipper of Tennyson, and long desirous of seeing him, was once\nto her great joy invited to a dinner at which he sat opposite to her,\nand she listened open-eared for his conversation. He spoke very\nlittle, however, being apparently in an uninspired mood, not to say a\ngrumpy humour; and the only phrase she distinctly caught was,\n\"I like my mutton in chunks.\" That lady might easily have gone\niway convinced that she had been the victim of a fraud, and that\nsome unpoetic person had been palmed off on her as \" the bard,\" after\nthe manner of the dinner party in The Golden Butterfly.\nThe fact that a \"control\" who frequently sends messages, brings\nwith him each time only the memory of previous messages through\nthe same medium, and is unaware of his other supposed manifesta\ntions through other mediums, is very suggestive of what we know\nconcerning secondary and multiple personalities. The complete or\ncomplex personality itself may perhaps know all about them all ;\nbut with this complete personality we seem unable to get into com\n\f54 Address by the President, [PART\nmunication ; we can so far only reach the fragments, and through\ndifferent mediums different fragments, as if\u2014speaking of it as a kind\nof incarnation,\u2014as if the temporary incarnation were affected or regu\nlated by the kind of body occupied, and could not manifest in identical\nfashion when constrained by the limitations of different instruments\njust as an executive musician would naturally appeal to different\nemotions if given, alternately, a violin, a cornet, a flute, and a concer\ntina. We can hardly expect, on any view, to reach more than what\nwe have supposed to be the fraction which had been manifested here\nin the flesh during earth life, but it appears as if we could not\nreach so much as that\u2014only a fragment of that. The specially\nadapted and educated body and brain which it was wont to use is\nno longer available,\u2014the organ is broken, and the organist is\nasked to manifest his identity on the harmonium of a country\nchurch.\nBut neither telepathy nor yet the agency of deceased persons is\nable to explain the asserted power of true clairvoyance properly\nso-called : the perception of things unknown to every mind of a human\norder 1 ; nor prediction of a kind other than inference.2 These are\ngreat subjects, and I have something to say about them too, though\nwhether it is worth saying at the present time is very doubtful,\nfor I am not by any means convinced that either of these things\never occurs. I will only say, therefore, in general, that the vague\nhypothesis of a world-soul, or an immanent Mind, of which even\nthe totality of ourselves are only microscopic fragments, as our ordi\nnarily known selves have been supposed to be more substantial\nfragments of our entire selves\u2014a Mind to which space and time are\nnot the barriers and limitations which they appear to us\u2014a Mind\nto which the past, present, and future are not indeed all one, but\nyet in a manner perceivable at will as a simultaneity as well as a\nsequence, and in which no transit or travel is necessary to pass from\n\u2022one place to another,\u2014I must say that a vague hypothesis of this\nkind\u2014a notion familiar to all philosophers\u2014is often forced across\ni For instance, the reading of numbers or letters grasped at random and thrown\ninto a bag ; or of a piece of newspaper torn out anywhere and sealed up without\nhaving been looked at, and the residue promptly burnt ; if such a thing ever\noccurs.\n2 If such a thing is conceivable aa real prevision not deducible from a wide\n.knowledge or survey of contemporaneous events ; for instance, the winner of a\nneck-and-neck race, or the exact date of some optional and as yet undecided\nevent. But these are not good instances, for it must be assumed posriblc that\n.the predicting agency might act so as to bring about fulfilment.\n\fXLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 55\nmy vision as I think over the problems of this great and wonderful\nuniverse.\nTo suppose that we know it all : to suppose that we have grasped\nits main outlines, that we realise pretty completely not only what\nis in it, but the still more stupendous problem of what is not and\ncannot be in it\u2014is a presumptuous exercise of limited intelligence,\nonly possible to a certain very practical and useful order of brain,\nwhich has good solid work of a commonplace kind to do in the world,\nand has been restricted in its outlook, let us say by Providence, in\norder that it may do that one thing and do it well. Some of these\ngnostic persons have been men of science, others have been men of\nletters, some of them again politicians and men of business : some\nfew of them have called themselves philosophers,i but the world has\nnot thought them its greatest philosophers. The instinct of the world\nin the long run, though only in the long run, is to be trusted ; and\nthe great men whom it has picked out as philosophers of the very\nfirst magnitude\u2014the philosopher Plato, of the older time, and the\nphilosopher Kant, of the more modern era\u2014 did not so limit their\nconception of the possible ; nor have the greatest poets, those whom\nhumanity has canonised among its greatest poets\u2014Virgil, let us say,\nand Wordsworth and Tennyson\u2014neither have they looked with dim\nbeclouded eyes on the present of the universe, or on the past and\nthe future of man.\nHear Tennyson on the origin of life and the antecedents of human\nexistence :\u2014\nOut of the deep, my child, out of the deep,\nFrom that true world within the world we see,\nWhereof our world is but the bounding shore.\ni One cannot but sympathise to some extent with those philosophers who urge\nthat the progress of humanity has been achieved by attention to a development\nof onr full consciousness, and that reversion to the subconscious or to dream\nstates is .-. step back. It must be noted, however, that the adjective \"subliminal,\"\nas we understand it, is not suggestive of subordinate or subsidiary, but is far\nmore nearly related to \"sublime\": a statement which, considered objectively,\nthe philosophers in question would probably disallow. If they mean that for the\nactive and practical concerns of life consciousness must be our guide and our\nadviser, I ain with them ; but if they mean (as I am sure they do not, when\npressed) that inspiration ia attained through consciousness, or that it is unlawful\nand unfruitful to investigate the subconscious, where (I suggest) lie the roots of\nthe connection between mind and matter ; then I must join issue with them.\nSo might an iceberg, glorying in its crisp solidity and sparkling pinnacles, resent\nattention paid to its submerged subliminal supporting region, or to the saline\nliquid out of which it arose, and into which in due course it will some day return.\n\f56 Address by the President, [PART\nHear him also on the present, and on the possibilities of inter\ncommunion :\u2014\nThe Ghost in Man, the Ghost that once was Man,\nBut cannot wholly free itself from Man,\nAre calling to each other thro' a dawn\nStranger than earth has ever seen ; the veil\nIs rending, and the Voices of the day\nAre heard across the Voices of the dark.\nAnd yet again on the future, and the ultimate reconciliation of\nmatter and mind :\u2014\nAnd we, the poor earth's dying race, and yet\nNo phantoms, watching from a phantom shore\nAwait the last and largest sense to make\nThe phantom walls of this illusion fade,\nAnd show us that the world is wholly fair.\nA quotation from Virgil, as translated by Mr. Myers, may be per\nmitted even to one who has no claim to be a scholar.

Thompson. 61\nI.\nINTRODUCTION TO THE REPORTS OF SITTINGS WITH\nMRS. THOMPSON.\nBY DR. OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.\nFROM time to time an oval account has been given at meetings of the\nSociety by various members of their experiences with the lady living\nat Hampstead, Mrs. Thompson, who has been good enough to allow a\nfew personally introduced friends to sit with her for the purpose of\nobserving and recording the phenomena of so-called mediumship which\ndeveloped themselves in connection with her ; but so far no publication\nin the Proceedings of any of these records has been made.\nThis delay is in accordance with the usual practice of the Society in\ndealing with the most important cases which come under its investiga\ntion, opportunity being thus afforded for fuller light, in whatever\ndirection, to manifest itself. Mrs. Piper was under investigation for\nseveral years before any report of her powers was published ; and\nthough her case was different, being that of a paid medium, it is\nobvious that the same kind of caution should be exercised, and similar\nopportunity for growing experience should, if possible, be afforded, in\nany case which appears to be of the first evidential rank.\nThe records of sittings with Mrs. Thompson now published constitute\nonly a small proportion of the whole, but they represent some of those\nof which the notes were most carefully and exactly made ; and they\ngive a fair idea or sample of the nature of the phenomenon\u2014both at its\nbest and at its worst,\u2014though indeed some private episodes in un-\nreported sittings are held, by those with personal knowledge of\nthem, to be far superior to any here recorded.\nThe delay in this case has been useful since it has afforded oppor\ntunity for Dr. Hodgson to have six sittings with Mrs. Thompson.\nThese appear to have been of the kind above denominated \"worst,\"\nand his report is decidedly unfavourable ; indeed, he is strongly of\nopinion that there was nothing of any value in them at all, and that\nthey suggest that in other cases also knowledge believed to have been\n\f62 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART\nof supernormal origin might be traced to normal sources of information\nif the sitters had been equally competent. This being so, it is im\nportant to have the fact recorded in our first publication ; and it has\nbeen the wish of Mrs. Thompson herself that everything, whether\nfavourable or unfavourable, should be impartially published. Refer\nence to her letter in the Journal for November, 1901, will show the\nadmirable position which she takes up in such matters ; her object has\nbeen to help in our quest, to this end she has given up much time and\ntaken much trouble ; and anything in the nature of suppression, either\nof suspicious circumstances or of hostile criticism, would be resented by\nher, just as it would be contrary to the whole spirit and traditions of\nthe Society.\nIn these phenomena the first question is, whether the information\ngiven is so far in accordance with facts as to be worthy of consideration.\nOf this the reader can judge fairly from the records, so that no time\nneed be spent in discussing it. But it is impossible to state fully\u2014\nbecause no one knows, or can know\u2014the exact circumstances under\nwhich the knowledge was obtained and given out by the medium. The\nvalue of the evidence, therefore, depends partly on the honesty of the\nmedium and partly on the competence of the observers. The latter\npoint may be judged of indirectly from the records, which show what\nprecautions were taken, (a) to prevent information reaching the medium\nby normal means, (b) to distinguish information that could have reached\nher normally from that which apparently could not.\nThe honesty of the medium is a more difficult problem ; because we\nmust recognise the possibility that she might either consciously or\nunconsciously present knowledge obtained by ordinary means as if it\nwere acquired supernormally, which is precisely what in these cases is\nmeant by \" deceit.\" It is not customary in ordinary life to associate\nthis word with any subconscious or unconscious condition, nor is it\ncustomary to analyse it or to do anything but simply anathematise it,\nand it may seem highly dangerous to be prepared to do anything else ;\nyet on consideration it will be perceived that every piece of information\ngiven must be acquired somehow, and the whole interest of the pheno\nmenon from our present point of view depends primarily on whether the\ninformation was acquired normally or not. The first question before us\nis whether the source of information can be shown to be supernormal ;\nit is therefore necessary to assume that whenever the knowledge could\nhave been acquired normally it was so acquired. Hence a discussion\nof normal means of obtaining information, and how far they may be\npresumed to go, becomes of the essence of the question.\n\fXLIV.] Introduction to Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 63\nIn fairness to a medium, it must be admitted that it is not always\neasy to be certain of the limits of the power of normal acquisition, or to\nset bounds to the power of our organs of sense, so as to be able to\ndiscriminate clearly where sense-perception merges into a form of clair\nvoyance or crystal-vision lucidity. Thus, take the case of a lady who,\nholding an unwrapped copy of the Times before her face to act as a fire\nscreen, saw a few hours later in a glass sphere an announcement of a\ndeath which subsequent investigation showed to be contained in its\nobituary column (see Proceedings S.P.R., vol. V., p. 507 ; a similar case\nalso in the Journal S.P.R., vol. I., p. 246) ; it would, of course, have to be\nassumed that she had obtained the information through normal vision\nwith her eyes, even though genuinely unconscious of the fact. Or take,\nagain, the case where the contents of a letter, delivered into the post-\nbox of a house, becomes known in a dream to a person who believes\nhimself to have remained in bed, normally quite unaware of any such\nletter (I cannot now find a record of the case of which this is my\nrecollection ; but there is something like it in Phantasms of the Laving,\nvol. L, p. 375 ; also vol. II., pp. 385 and 444 ; also in Proceedings S.P.E.,\nvol. XIV., pp. 279 and 280) ; the hypothesis would at least have to be\nconsidered that in a state of somnambulism he had read the letter and\nsealed it up again, for some other member of the family to open later.\nOr take the case of Mrs. Piper, who ostensibly read part of a letter,\nwhich I gave her, by the process of undoing it and applying it to the\ntop of her head : it would have to be assumed that she had glimpsed\nits contents by her normal eyesight, unless evidence to the contrary\nwere strong. Such a case might, of course, be one of conscious fraud :\nthe application of the letter to the top of the head being then a mere\ndeceitful artifice to divert attention from the real intervals of normal\nreading.\nNevertheless it is quite imaginable, in any given case, that the\nmedium might genuinely think she had got the whole of the informa\ntion in a supernormal way, while the truth was that some part of it.\nor even the whole, had been really obtained normally, or, if not quite\nnormally, yet by hyperaesthesia\u2014extra quickness of the appropriate\nsense organs.\nIt needs but a small acquaintance with hypnotic and automatic\nphenomena to be well aware that the hypnotic subject or automatist\nis frequently deceived as to the source of his impressions; not only\nmay he suppose that an impression originated in his own mind when\nit really came from without (e.g. from the hypnotist) or vice versa ; but\nalso he may suppose it came through one sense when it provably came\n\f64 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART\nthrough another. A little careful analysis of our own experience will\nshow that we sometimes make similar errors as to the sources of impres\nsions in ordinary daily life. Examples of the kind referred to are con\ntained in the Proceedings S.P.R., vol. IV., pp. 532-4. In the first case a\nboy appeared to read clairvoyantly or telepathically the number of the\npage of a book held facing the agent, but with its back to the boy ;\nand when asked to indicate the place where the number was, pointed\nto the back of the book just opposite the number's true position.\nNevertheless there is reason to believe that the number was really\nseen reflected in the cornea of the eye of the \" agent \" or person facing\nhim, though this image would certainly be an extremely small thing\nto read, and could hardly be legible to a person not somewhat hyper\nsensitive. Nevertheless M. Bergson, who observed the fact and\nsuggested this explanation, felt sure that the boy's real belief was in\naccordance with his own statement, and accordingly supposes it to be a\ncase of simulation inconscient.\nThe second example is referred to more at length in the Journal\nS.P.R., vol. I., p. 84, where Mrs. Sidgwick reports on a case of reading\nor glimpsing with elaborately bandaged eyes through chinks so small\nand deceptive that the observer could hardly tell with which eye he\nwas dimly seeing, and might conceivably be unaware that he was\nseeing in a normal way at all.\nCertainly in cases of hypnosis, where suggestion may be dominant,\nit is easy to suppose that the subject may believe himself to be\nreceiving impressions in any way which is either actually or artificially\nin the mind of the operator ; and it is a familiar fact that suggestions\nwhich are given in one state often take effect as if they were quite\nspontaneous when the subject has entered another state, no connection\nbetween the two states being remembered. (See a number of curious\ninstances observed and recorded by Mr. Gurney in Proceedings S.P.R.,\nvol. IV., pp. 268 et seq.)\nThere is therefore a further difficulty when an attempt is made to\ndiscriminate between what a medium knows in her own proper person\nand what she knows in trance or in her secondary personality. In\nhypnotic experience it is usually found possible to distinguish these\ntwo reservoirs of knowledge or memory from each other, and to find\nthat they are independent, or at least that they consistently simulate\nindependence. There seem to be all grades of this independence of\nmemory in different states. (See especially Gurney's article in Pro\nceedings S.P.R., vol. IV., p. 518, etc. ; also the report by Dr. Milne\nBramwell, vol. XII., pp. 193-5 ; see also, for something of the same\n\fXLIV.] Introduction to Sittings vAtli Mrs. Thompson. 65\nsort in secondary personality, the Leonie case, vol. V., p. 397.) But\nsuch a hypothesis is too dangerous and lax to be applied to the present\ninstance. It is quite possibk that the entranced medium may not be\nfully aware of some things that have been told to the medium in her\nordinary state ; but for evidential purposes it must obviously always\nbe assumed otherwise. Everything known to the normal Mrs.\nThompson must be considered equally known to the ostensible\n\" control \" speaking with Mrs. Thompson's mouth.\nIf it had been found in any one case that she had deliberately\ndeceived a sitter, this would of course throw grave doubt on all other\ncases, even those in which it appeared that no deceit was possible.\nNow, she does, when in trance, often refer to facts known to her when\nin her normal condition ; the \" control \" seeming sometimes aware,\nand sometimes unaware, whether the facts are so known or not. But\nthe sitters who have had most experience of her trances (especially\nMr. Piddington and Mrs. Verrall) have been struck by her constantly\ntelling them\u2014either during the trance or afterwards\u2014that certain\nfacts were so known to her normal state, and are not to be regarded\nas supernormally known. Instances of this will be found in the\nnarratives, which follow. \u00ab\nOn the other hand, there are cases in which, without any such\nwarning to the sitters, she has made statements about special facts as\nif they came to her supernormally which (a) she might have learnt (e.g.\nMiss Harrison's names, see Mrs. Verrall's paper, pp. 208-210) or (b) there\nis strong evidence that she '\/''\u2022\/ learn by normal means. Cases like\nthese are what in the subsequent discussion we call \" suspicious circum\nstances,\" and it is on them that Dr. Hodgson's unfavourable judgment\ndepends.\nAs I have already indicated, persons who are familiar with automatic\nphenomena will admit that it is possible that Mrs. Thompson might\nhave learnt these facts unconsciously and given them out with no\ndeliberate intention to deceive. And in favour of this it may be urged\nthat a witness who watched an incident of the kind (see below,\np. 162) had the impression that it was to be so interpreted. On\nthe other hand, Dr. Hodgson, who did not see such an incident occur,\nbut had strong reason to think it had occurred, believes that Mrs.\nThompson acted consciously and deliberately. Plainly, each reader\nmust be left to form his own judgment on these incidents.\nWhatever view is taken, we must all admit that a certain amount of\nwhat may, in the technical sense, be called \" deception \" is involved, or\nis liable to be involved, in the phenomenon for the reasons above given.\n\f66 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART\nThis deception need not in any case be voluntary, and its occurrence\nmay depend on a certain want of co-ordination between different strata\nof personality in the medium\u2014if it be supposed that a \" control \" is a\nsecondary personality,\u2014so that information conveyed from one stratum\nmay be received and given forth as a genuine supernormal message by\nanother stratum, having been misinterpreted and perhaps distorted in\nthe process of transfer.\nIt must be noted, however, that in the case of Mrs. Thompson such\ninstances of apparently unconscious transmission of information, without\ncognisance of its source, seem to have been only occasional, and do not\nin any way suggest the existence of an organised subliminal fraudulent\nscheme : nor do they indicate an elaborately organised and complex\nscheme of subliminal romance, such as Professor Flournoy experienced\nin the case of Helene Smith, many of the elements in which he traced\nto normal sources, though there was every reason to suppose that the\nmedium was unaware of their real origin.\nI myself have been accorded opportunities of sitting with Mrs.\nThompson many times, sometimes with Mr. Myers, sometimes alone,\nand I have become impressed with her absolute sincerity, and real\ndesire, not always successful, to avoid every normal assistance or other\naid : which aid, when employed, while it may for the moment\nfictitiously appear to improve the phenomenon, really undermines its\nmost essential feature.\nI propose now first to quote, from the Report of the Psychological\nCongress in Paris, Mr. Myers' general introduction ; then to give the\nseries of Dr. Van Eeden, and of the sitter known as Mr. Wilson ; then\nto give Dr. Hodgson's report, together with some observations of a\nsimilar character, as noted by Miss Johnson ; and to conclude with\nthe series of Mrs. Verrall.\nIt is not to be supposed that this collection represents any large\nproportion of all the work that Mrs. Thompson has been good enough\nto do for the Society, but it is all that we propose to publish at the\npresent time.\n\fxuv.] Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 67\nII.\nON THE TRANCE-PHENOMENA OF MRS. THOMPSON.\nBY THE LATK F. W. H. MYERS.i\nInlroiluction.\nI.\u2014Trance is a name applied to a form of automatism, whether\nhealthy or morbid, in which the automatist appears to be in some\nway altered, or even asleep, but in which he may speak or write\ncertain matter of which his normal personality is ignorant at the\ntime, and which it rarely remembers on his return to waking life.\nIf there appears to be not merely a modification but a substitution\nof personality in the trance, it is called possession. Trance occurs\nspontaneously in so-called somnambulism, as a result of disease in\nhysteria, and as a result of suggestion, etc., in hypnotic states. A\nfuller analysis shows classes which slide into each other in various\nways.\n1. The trance may be simulated and the utterances fraudulent ;\nthe facts which they contain having been previously learnt, or being\nacquired at the time by a \" fishing \" process.\nThis is usually the case with professional dairvoyantes.\n2. The trance may be genuine, but morbid ; and the utterances\nincoherent or in other ways degenerative, even when showing memory\nor accuracy greater than normal.\nThis is the case in hysteria, so-called demoniacal possession, etc.\nThis group of cases has been admirably analysed by Drs. Pierre\nJanet, Binet, etc., in France : Drs. Breuer and Freud, etc., in Austria :\nand elsewhere.\n3. The trance may be genuine and healthy, and the utterances\ncoherent, but containing no actual fact unknown to the automatist.\n'Reprinted by permission from the IV\" Congrte International de Psychologie :\nCampie rcndu det Stances et Texte des MAmoires (Paris, 1901), pp. 113-121. Some\nobvious misprints in the report, the proofs of which had not been submitted to\nMr. Myers, are here corrected.\n\f68 F. W. H. Myers. [PART\nThis is sometimes the case in hypnotic trance ; and the \" inspirations\nof genius \" may approach this type, which seems to be illustrated by\nProf. Flournoy's subject, Mile. Helene Smith.\n4. The trance may be genuine and healthy, and the utterances\nmay contain facts not known to the automatist, but known to other\npersons present, and thus possibly reached by telepathy; or existent\nelsewhere, and thus possibly reached by telcesthesia.\n5. The trance may be genuine and healthy, and the utterances may\ncontain facts not previously known to the subject nor always known\nto the observers, but verifiable, and such as might probably be included\nin the memory of certain definite deceased persons, from whom they\nprofess to come. This form of trance may suggest a temporary sub\nstitution of personality.\nII.\u2014During the past 25 years I have seen many specimens of the\nthree former of these classes, and a few of the two latter and more\ninteresting types. Records of the Rev. W. Stainton Moses' case, and\nof Mrs. Piper's case, with others analogous, have been printed in the\nS.P.K. Proceedings. I have now to describe a third well-marked\ncase of this type,\u2014the case of Mrs. Thompson.\nThis case, while quite independent, is closely parallel to Mrs. Piper's.\nI hope to produce, in a longer paper to appear in Proceedings S.P.L'.,\na series of testimonies, from a large group of competent witnesses,\nwho assert that facts have been uttered to them through Mrs. Thompson\nentranced which could not have become known to her in any normal\nway.\nThe hypotheses of fraudulent preparation and of chance-coincidence\nappear to be quite excluded. There seems to be some telaesthesia and\nsome telepathy ; but most of the matter given suggests the character\nand the memory of certain deceased persons, from whom the messages\ndo in fact profess to come.\nIII.\u2014I claim that this substitution of personality, or spirit-control, or\npossession, or pneumaturgy, is a normal forward step in the evolution of\nour race. I claim that a spirit exists in man, and that it is healthy\nand desirable that this spirit should be thus capable of partial and\ntemporary dissociation from the organism ;\u2014itself then enjoying an\nincreased freedom and vision, and also thereby allowing some departed\nspirit to make use of the partially vacated organism for the sake of\ncommunication with other spirits still incarnate on earth. I claim that\nmuch knowledge has already thus been acquired, while much more is\nlikely to follow.\n\fXLIV.] Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 69\nCASE OF MRS. THOMPSON.\nFollowing on this introduction, it seems best to give, in such brief\nform as my limits allow, a few details which may answer obvious\ninquiries, and which may prove useful to persons who may have the\nchance of investigating similar cases.\nI. \u2014History of the Case.\nIt is through the kind permission and co-operation of Mr. and Mrs.\nEdmond Thompson, of Hampstead, London, N.W., that I am enabled\nto present a record\u2014inevitably imperfect indeed, yet fairly representa\ntive\u2014of certain phenomena which have accompanied Mrs. Thompson\nfrom childhood down to the present day. The case is the more\ninteresting in that these phenomena arose among a group of persons\nunfamiliar with such experiences, and have ever since been closely\nlinked with Mrs. Thompson's own private life and family affections.\nMrs. Thompson was born in 1868,\u2014the daughter of an architect in\nBirmingham. Mr. Thompson, whom she married in 1886, then held\nan important post in a firm of merchants, and has now for some years\nconducted a business of his own as importer of isinglass in the City of\nLondon. Mrs. Thompson thus is not, nor ever has been, a paid or\nprofessional medium.\nMrs. Thompson's distinct realisation of her own powers dates only\nfrom 1896, when, in consequence of certain perplexing experiences, she\nsought advice of Mr. F. W. Thurstan, a graduate of Cambridge, long\nknown to me, who has rendered great service to this research by\naffording opportunities (at considerable expense of time and trouble to\nhimself) for the recognition and development of psychical gifts. Mrs.\nThompson, who was already interested in spiritualism, saw the\nannouncement of Mr. Thurstan's meetings, and attended them for\nsome.time. Introduced by his kindness to Mr. and Mrs. Thompson,\nI have known them intimately since 1898; and they have agreed with\nme that it is the clear duty of persons possessed of supernormal powers\nto keep an accurate record of phenomena, and to publish so much of\nthat record as may be possible with serious care. For what follows,\ntherefore, I claim entire genuineness. I believe that there has been no\nattempt whatever to exaggerate any incident, but an honest desire on\nthe part of both Mr. and Mrs. Thompson to utilise for the benefit of\nScience a gift which they fully recognise as independent of personal\nmerit ;\u2014a trust placed in the hands of individuals selected by some law\nss yet unknown.\n\f70 F. W. H. Myers. [PART\nMrs. Thompson, I would add, is an active, vigorous, practical person :\ninterested in her household and her children, and in the ordinary\namusements of young English ladies, as bicycling, the theatre. She\nis not of morbid, nor even of specially reflective or religious tempera\nment. No one would think of her as the possessor of supernormal\ngifts.\nII.\u2014Modes in which Messages are given.\nThese, with Mrs. Thompson, cover nearly the whole range of\nautomatism already familiar to the student.\n1. In the first place, Mrs. Thompson frequently sees spirits standing\nin the room, who sometimes, though not always, indicate their identity.\nSometimes ' these figures form scenes, like the scenes discerned in\ncrystals, but life-size. Thus a glove-fight which my son had witnessed\nat Eton was partially reproduced as though by figures standing behind\nhim. Similar auditory impressions are sometimes also received, re\nsembling either internal or external voices, heard by Mrs. Thompson\nalone.\n2. Writing is sometimes seen on walls, etc. ; again resembling the\nwriting seen in crystals.\n3. Pictures are often seen in a glass-ball (crystal). These pictures\nfall into the ordinary categories. Some of them seem meaningless\nand dream-like ; some of them represent scenes actually passing else\nwhere ; some of them are symbolic of future events. Sentences some\ntimes appear ; which, oddly enough, look to Mrs. Thompson (who\nalone has seen them) just like scraps of coarse printing ;\u2014as though a\npiece of newspaper were held beneath the ball. There have even\nseemed to be ragged edges, as though the paper had been torn. Such\nindications are of interest, on the assumption that the pictures may\ncome from outside her own mind, as seeming to show that it may be\neasier to produce a picture\u2014in this case a picture of printed words\u2014\u2022\nwhich is in some way copied from objects materially existent already.\n4. Mrs. Thompson sometimes writes automatically, in a waking state.\n5. But such writing is generally produced during a brief period of\nsleep or trance. There will be an impulse to write, followed almost at\nonce by unconsciousness ; and scrawls, more or less legible, will be\nfound on awaking.\n6. But the most frequent mode of communication is by speech in\ntrance ; intermingled with occasional writing, and claiming to come\nfrom some definite spirit who \" controls.\"\nThe entry into the trance is swift and gentle. As a rule there is a\n\fXLIV.] Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 71\nmere closure of the eyelids as in sudden sleep. If the control be an\nunfamiliar one, there may be a few deep inspirations. The awaking\nalso is a mere opening of the eyes,\u2014sometimes with a look of bewilder\nment. If the sitting has been a success, there is a feeling of rest and\nrefreshment,\u2014which may indeed develop into unusual peace and joy.\nThe impression made on the observer is that the trance is as natural as\nordinary sleep. Mrs. Thompson believes that her health has derived\nmarked benefit from these trances.\nIII.\u2014Choice of Sitters.\nIn selecting sitters I have naturally aimed at getting persons who\nwere unknown to her, and not giving hints or suggesting replies. I\nnaturally also wished to give opportunities to savants, and especially\nto colleagues on the S.P.R. Council, such as Sir W. Crookes, Professor\nSidgwick, etc. Experience soon showed that it was practically unim\nportant whether Mrs. Thompson knew the sitter beforehand or not.\nThe quality of the messages has not been perceptibly modified by this\nfact. Most of the best messages, in fact, have been given to absolute\nstrangers, while persons of whom much could easily have been learnt\u2014\nas Sir W. Crookes, Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick, Dr. Hodgson, etc.\u2014\nhave obtained practically nothing. I can, however, perceive to some\nextent on what circumstances success depends. Success depends partly\non the sensitivity of the sitter himself\u2014when such sensitivity happens\nto meet Mrs. Thompson's\u2014in some way which we cannot explain.\nBut success depends much more on the question whether there is any\ndeparted friend who is eager to communicate with the survivor, and\nwho has also learnt the way in which to do so.\nIn this, as in almost all points, Dr. Hodgson's conclusions, drawn\nfrom his numerous sittings with Mrs. Piper, are confirmed by my own\nobservation with Mrs. Thompson. He had already observed that he\nobtained the best results when he acted on the spirit-hypothesis ;\u2014\ndealt with the sources of information as if they were just what they\nprofessed to be, and thus got from each spirit in turn all that it could\ngive him.\nStill more markedly, I repeat, is this the case with Mrs. Thompson.\nThe knowledge given\u2014whether consisting of earth-memories or (as\nappears) of actual fresh observation of things on earth, made from the\nspiritual world\u2014arranges itself most naturally, almost inevitably,\nunder the names of certain informants around whose special memories,\nand powers of fresh acquisition, the scattered facts and ideas emitted\nare seen to cohere. One is, in fact, talking to a series of friends, each\n\f72 F. W. H. Myers. [PART\nof whom has a characteristic, but limited, budget of news to tell one,\u2014\nand also a characteristic, but limited, power of observation or collec\ntion of fresh facts. I find that the important thing is to interest if\npossible (on behalf of each fresh sitter) certain departed friends of my\nown,\u2014some of them already familiar with these inquiries before their\ndecease. If these or similar willing and capable spirits will intervene,\nsome measure of truth is sure to follow. In this, as in an earthly\ninquiry, I have to work outwards from a small nucleus of persons and\nideas already intimately known. Other sitters (as Dr. van Eeden)\nhave had the same experience with their own special groups.\nIV.\u2014Arrangement of Sittings.\nThe actual sittings are of the simplest type. I bring an anonymous\nstranger into a room where Mrs. Thompson is, and we simply await\nher trance. I sometimes ask my anonymous friend to remain silent\n(if, for instance, his accent should give some clue to nationality) or\nelse we talk together on trivial topics until Mrs. Thompson's light trance\nsupervenes,\u2014with no external symptom except a closing of the eyes\nand certain slight differences in manner. It does not matter where\nthe visitor sits, nor is any contact desired. There is no \" fishing \" for\ninformation. I usually converse myself with the \"control\"; and in\nsome of the best sittings I have been as ignorant as Mrs. Thompson\nherself of the family history, etc., of the sitter. To give one instance\nonly, this was well exemplified in the case of Miss A. D. Sedgwick (the\nAmerican novelist), whom I took with me for a sitting on the very day\non which I made her acquaintance. I knew Miss Sedgwick's name and\nher books ; Mrs. Thompson knew nothing of her whatever, but a vein\nof memories was at once opened which developed with so much of\nintimate family matter that only a scanty selection from what was said\ncan be offered for publication. This series of memories was fully\nbegun by an alleged spirit-friend of Miss Sedgwick's, while I alone\nwas the interlocutor. Afterwards Miss Sedgwick joined in, but gave\nno hints ; and indeed various facts were given to her which lay quite\noutside her own memory. This last remark suggests a brief review of\nthe habitual contents of these messages.\nV.\u2014The Matter giixn falls under Four Main Cfa.ss\u00ab.s, whose Proportion.*\nvary with the Sitter.\n(a) Dream-like and confused talk, with mistakes and occasional\napproximations. This probably proceeds mainly from Mrs. Thompson's\nown subliminal self, and occurs when there is no valid \"control.\" It\n\fXLIV.] Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 73\ndoes not seem connected with any clear consciousness, and when it\noccurs now it is usually stopped by some \" control,\" who puts an end\nto the imperfect trance ;\u2022\u2014much as one rouses oneself up from a\nconfusing doze, so as either to wake or to sleep properly.\n(li) Facts lying beyond the sensory range, but not necessarily\nimplying discarnate spirits as their source. Such are perceptions of\nevents actually occurring at a distance, or of events which have\noccurred in the past or will occur in the future. It is at present\nimpossible to say how far Mrs. Thompson's own subliminal self, cr\nhow far any discarnate fellow-worker, is responsible for the singularly\nvaried mass of knowledge thus given.\n(c) Next come facts purporting to proceed from discarnate spirits,\n\u2014and such as might probably exist in their memories. But in this\ncase, of course, as in Mrs. Piper's, the majority of these facts exist also\nin the minds of the sitters, so that it is possible to argue that they\nare telepathically drawn from thence by the sensitive's subliminal\nfaculty, without any intervention of spirits of the departed.\n(d) There remains a small but significant group of facts which are\nnot known to the sitters, but which would have been known to the\ndeparted persons from whom they profess to come;\u2014or (and this is\nstill more curious) facts which are such that those departed persons\nwould have been interested in learning them after death. The gradual,\nincidental accumulation of facts of this type becomes at last a strong\nargument for the authenticity of the alleged communications.\nI believe, then, that I have good reason for ascribing many of these\nmessages to definite surviving personalities, known while on earth to\nfriends of mine whose presence with Mrs. Thompson has evoked the\nmessages, or to myself.\nI believe that most of these messages are uttered through Mrs.\nThompson's organism by spirits who for the time inform or \" possess \"\nthat organism ; and that some are received by her spirit in the unseen\nworld, directly from other spirits, and are then partially remembered,\nso that the sensitive can record them on emerging from the ecstatic\nstate.\nBut although I cannot ignore the evidence for these extreme hypo\ntheses, I by no means wish to assert that all the phenomena in this or\nin any similar case proceed from departed spirits. Rather, I am\ninclined to hold that whenever an incarnate spirit is sufficiently\nreleased from bodily trammels to hold any conscious intercourse with\nthe unseen world, that intercourse will inevitably include various\ntypes of communication. I think that there is likely to be knowledge\n\f74 F. W. H. Myers. [PART\nderived telepathically from incarnate as well as from discarnate spirits ;\n\u2014and also telaesthetic or clairvoyant knowledge of actual scenes, past,\npresent, or future, which lie beyond sensory reach. If I speak with a\nfriend on this earth I am at the same time conscious in many ways\nof the earthly environment ;\u2014and similarly I imagine that even a\nslight and momentary introduction into that unseen world introduces\nthe spirit to influences of that still more complex environment,\nmingled in ways which we cannot as yet disentangle. The sensitive\nmay thus exercise concurrently several forms of sensitivity ;\u2014receiving\nmessages of all degrees of directness, and perceptions of all degrees of\nclarity.\nThese ideas are far removed from ordinary scientific experience. It\nmay still seem, I fear, almost impertinent to offer them for the con\nsideration of a Congress of savants. Yet I ask that this case be\nconsidered along with two other cases brought forward at the same\nCongress :\u2014namely, Professor Flournoy's case of pseudo-possession in\nM11e. Helene Smith, and Dr. Morton Prince's case of multiplex\npersonality in \" Sally Beauchamp.\" ' It is hard to say which of these\ncases, if narrated fifty years or even twenty years ago, would have been\nconsidered the most bizarre and impossible. Yet all competent\npsychologists will now agree in considering Professor Flournoy's and\nDr. Prince's cases as records of high value to the student of human\npersonality. Before setting my case aside as unworthy of similar\nconsideration, I invite psychologists to study Part XXXIII. (vol.\nXIII.) of the S.P.R. Proceedings, where Dr. Hodgson has discussed\nat length the closely similar case of Mrs. Piper. If that record be\ncompared with the forthcoming record of Mrs. Thompson's case, in\n[the present Part] of the same Proceedings, it may perhaps be felt, by\nsome at least of the rising generation of psychologists, that few tasks\ncan be more interesting and important than that of discovering, in-'\nvestigating, and comparing as many as possible of these extraordinary\nvariations in the ordinary human type\u2014variations which, although\noften degenerative, are also sometimes, in my view, distinctly and\nrapidly evolutive in their tendency.\ni See Proceedings S.P.R., vol. XV., p. 46C.\n\fXLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 75\nIII.\nACCOUNT OF SITTINGS WITH MRS. THOMPSON.\nBY DR. F. VAN EEDKN\n(of Btissum, Holland).\nWE may say of students of psychical phenomena that they fall into\nthree different groups :\u2014the complete disbelievers, the spiritualists, and\nthe non-spiritualists.\nAmong the serious men of science who have taken the matter in\nhand patiently and without prejudice, complete disbelievers are\nbecoming scarce. We need not here discuss their opinion.\nBut the believers in the genuineness of the phenomena are still\ndivided into two well-defined parties.\nThe first group accepts almost completely the view of the spiritists\nand believes in the influence of spirits, of impalpable and, in the\nordinary way, imperceptible beings, upon the mind and body of a\nliving human being.\nThe second group acknowledges the facts as extraordinary and\ninexplicable by ordinary causes, but does not admit that as yet any\nthing has been discovered which forces us inevitably to believe in the\nexistence of spirits. Everything may perhaps be explained, according\nto them, by faculties personal to the medium, such as telepathy and\nclairvoyance.\nTo the first group belong, as we all know, very distinguished\nmen of science, such as Alfred Eussel Wallace and Sir William Crookes,\nand also the man whose loss we so deeply deplore, Frederic Myers.\nTo the second group belonged, I believe, that other President of this\nSociety, whose loss we all regret, Professor Sidgwick ; and to it there\nstill belong Mr. Podmore and others.\nThe first theory is much the simpler as an explanation. Once given\nthe possibility of the action upon our own existence of beings whose\nmaterial conditions of existence are quite imperceptible and even incon\nceivable for us, all the rest is easily explained. As a philosophical\nconception this view has nothing in it absurd or improbable. On the\nF\n\f76 . . . \" Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART\ncontrary, as a matter of probability, we must agree that it is far more\nlikely that there exists an infinity of imperceptible beings, even in our\nimmediate proximity, than that we should be the ultimate form of\nlife, or that we should have reached an exhaustive power of perception\nof other living beings. We know that our sensory perception is limited\nto five modes, or channels, each of them embracing only a small part\nof an infinite scale of vibratory motions. It is, philosophically speak\ning, quite as absurd to believe that every form of life and existence\nmust fall under our power of observation, as that there are no other\ncelestial bodies but those which our eyes can see.\nWe must keep in mind the philosophical tenet, well expressed by\nSpinoza, and as far as I know never contradicted or considered open\nto contradiction, that God's infinity has an infinite number of modes :\n\" Infinite, infinitis modis;\" that is to say, there is not only infinity in\nsequence of time, or in extension of space, but also in diversity of\nbeing at the same place and at the same time.\nThe second group of observers, however, while accepting the\nphilosophical possibility, or even probability, of the existence of\nother beings, angels or spirits, near us and able to exert influence\nupon us, maintain that it is scientifically right to oppose as long\nas possible the theory of their agency or intervention to account for\nthe phenomena. Premature use of such a theory would indeed be\nfar too easy a method and not in accordance with scientific economy,\nwhich prescribes the utmost restriction in the employment of final\ncauses and the utmost care in every step towards the unknown.\nTelepathy and clairvoyance being once recognised as realities, and the\nmarvellous faculties of the unconscious or subliminal mind being taken\ninto consideration, we must not speak of spirits until it becomes\nabsolutely necessary.\nThis second platform seems to be quite unassailable from the\ntheoretical side. It is always very difficult to prove strictly that a\ncertain fact has been out of reach of the medium's unconscious observa\ntion during the whole of his lifetime ; and this difficulty grows into\nabsolute impossibility, if we admit a faculty like clairvoyance, of which\nwe cannot tell if it has any limits either in space or in time.\nLet me give an instance from my own experience with Mrs.\nThompson. We had taken every precaution at my first sitting that\nthe medium should hear nothing about my coming, my name, or my\nnationality. I came unexpectedly, and remained an almost silent\nwitness. And yet, at the first sitting, the name Frederick \u2014my\nChristian name and that of my father\u2014was given; an apparent\n\fXLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 77\nattempt was made to pronounce my surname (\"Fon,\" \" Fondalin \"),\nand an allusion was made to my medical profession.\nAt my second sitting, though I had not seen Mrs. Thompson in the\ninterval, the name \" van Eeden \" was given in full, pronounced as if it\nwere read by an Englishman (Eden), also the name of my country\n(\"Netherlands\"), and the Christian names of my wife (\"Martha\") and\nof one of my children were given, and at the beginning of the third\nsitting the name of the place where I live (\"Bussum\").\nThese different names were given more or less at random, not\nalways in their proper relation, but nevertheless in such a way that\nsimple guessing was out of the question. She began, e.g. (at the third\nsitting) to call me \"Mr. Bostim,\" \"Bussom\" or \"Bussum,\" mistaking\nthe name of my place for my own name ; then she asked what\n\"Netherlands\" meant; she said at the first sitting that I had a\nrelation called Frederik ; at the third, that it was my own name, and\nthat I was a \"gardener of Eden,\" and so on. At each following sitting\nthis confusion became a little clearer in her mind.\nTo explain this, coincidence will not do, as every one who studies\nthe notes must acknowledge. Four suppositions are possible :\n(1) Conscious fraud. This presupposes a system of secret informa\ntion, a detective service, of incredible extent and precision. I may say\nthat to know Mrs. Thompson is to discard this idea.\n(2) Unconscious fraud. On this hypothesis, it is necessary to assume\nthat by some marvellous power of deduction the medium can connect\nnames, seen here and there on letters, cards, or papers, with an\nunknown visitor whom she sees for the first time.\n(3) Information by spirits. This is the explanation given by Mrs.\nThompson herself. On this view, the spirits talk through her mouth,\nwhile she herself is dreaming about other things. She tells her dreams\nsometimes after waking up.\n(4) Clairvoyance and telepathy. According to this theory, Mrs.\nThompson reads particulars about me from my mind or from else\nwhere, unconsciously, and constructs a dramatic figure, a fantastic\nbeing, a spirit, who is supposed to tell her all this.\nHow can we eliminate the supposition of imposture ?\nThe possibility of fraud seemed untenable. I got information about\nobjects whose origin was known only to myself. I brought a lock of\nhair of a man who had lived and died at Utrecht, and the hair was\nimmediately connected with that name, and on subsequent occasions\nreferred to as the \" Utrecht hair.\" I brought a piece of clothing that\nhad belonged to a young man who had committed suicide. Nobody in\n\f78 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART\nthe world knew that I had kept it, nor that I had taken it to England\nwith me for this purpose, and yet I got an exact description of the\nyoung man and the manner of his suicide, and even his Christian\nname was given.\nFor me this excluded all fraud or coincidence.\nCertainly, this evidence would not be convincing for anybody who\ndoubted my faculty of memory and observation, or my veracity. But\nno evidence is in itself sufficient. It all requires repetition and corro-\nboration by others. This is exactly what we look for.\nThe choice between spirits and telepathy remains. But the difficulties\ninvolved are deeper and more complicated than we might think at first\nsight.\nThe telepathic hypothesis implies that my thoughts were communi\ncated, without ordinary means, to the mind of the medium. But at\nwhat distance ? May we take for granted that this way of communi\ncation, concerning which we have no knowledge whatever, falls under\nthe laws of light and sound 1 Or can there be only telepathy when\nI am in the same room, or when I make an effort of volition 1 And\nhow can we avoid or exclude the telepathic influence of all other\npersons in all other parts of the world 1\nAt first sight one would say that telepathy was excluded when the\nmedium tells me a thing I did not know myself. This has, indeed,\nbeen considered by many previous researchers as a crucial test.\nBut let us consider this crucial test well, for we here come across an\nunscientific or unphilosophical method of reasoning, very common\nindeed, but most misleading. To rely on this test involves a tacit\nassumption of knowledge which we do not as a matter of fact possess.\nOur present knowledge of the conditions of telepathy is not know\nledge, but simply a sort of vague idea of what is likely, an \" Ahnung,\"\nas the Germans say.\nWe think it likely that distances count in telepathy, distances in\ntime and in space ; in the case of experiments, we think it most likely\nthat there will only be telepathic influence between two persons at\nthe same time in the same room, one of them making an effort of\nvolition, the other remaining passive. But we have no right to\nmaintain that these conditions are essential.\nWho could contradict me if I were to say that the information\nwhich was unknown to me was obtained by telepathic action from\nsome other person somewhere in Holland or in some other part of\nthe world 1\nStill more vague and ill-defined are our notions of clairvoyance.\n\fXLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 79\nAnd it is just because our knowledge of its conditions and laws is so\nsmall that we can explain nearly everything by it, and that conse\nquently it is impossible to talk of crucial tests.\nWe all know that our subliminal part is a first-rate dramatist. Our\ndreams are comedies or dramas most astonishing to ourselves. We\ncan order hypnotised persons to perform this or that rdle, and they\nwill act their part with wonderful talent and accuracy.\nIn this way, every spirit that is represented, no matter in how\nlife-like and convincing a manner, can be explained away. If we\nadmit the faculty of clairvoyance, which can procure information\nconcerning everything and everybody, concerning all places and all\ntimes, concerning the past and the future, what miracle of evidence\n<an the spirit produce that will outweigh the fatal objection that he\nis simply a dramatic creature of the medium's brain, constructed with\nthe help of absolutely unlimited information 1\nFor instance, the young man who had committed suicide gave as\nproofs of his identity Dutch names of places and persons which were\nnot at all in my mind at the moment. This might have been un\nconscious telepathy. At the same time proper names were given which\nI had never heard myself. I did not even know such names existed.\nYet later, in Holland, I came across people who bore these very names,\nthough their connection (if any) with the young man I could not find\nout. But what value could they have as proof of identity ? Could\nwe not always say that the medium, being clairvoyant, had seen these\nnan.es somehow in connection with the young man, and so used them\nto complete the vraisemblance of her creation ?\nThus it is clear that evidence of this kind must remain incon\nclusive.\nOn the other hand, we know nothing of the conditions under which\nspirits may or must work on the human brain, nor whether distances\ncount or not in that regard, any more than we do in the case of\ntelepathy.\nAB a very curious observation, I may relate the following : The\nyoung man, as mentioned in the notes of my sittings, had recovered\nfrom his first attempt at suicide (though the control, \"Nelly,\" did not\nfind out this particular), but the wound in his throat left his voice\nhoarse and gave him a peculiar little cough. As soon as I came near\nMrs. Thompson with the piece of clothing, her voice became more or\nless hoarse, and by and bye the same peculiar little cough appeared,\nand grew more accentuated at each subsequent sitting. After three\nsittings it kept on even in the intervals between the sittings, and\n\f80 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART\nin the end did not leave her altogether until I had left England, taking\nwith me the piece of clothing\u2014a flannel vest.\nHere distance seemed really to be of import, and, what is most\ncurious, the influence seemed to emanate from an inanimate object.\nIt reminded me of what a French author called \"I'&me des chases,\"\nthe soul of things.\nNow, it is just as difficult to disprove the other view, that there is\nno telepathy, no clairvoyance at all in these phenomena, but that\neverything is the work of spirits. According to this view\u2014as main\ntained by superior minds like A. Russel Wallace\u2014spirits surround us\neverywhere and always, and are constantly occupied in trying to\ngive us impulses, ideas, or fantasies. These influences are pleasant\nor disagreeable, useful or dangerous, insignificant or marvellous,\naccording to our impressionability, our healthy or morbid physical\ncondition.\nBy this means telepathy, clairvoyance, all the phenomena of the\nsubliminal intelligence, even dreams and the hallucinations and mental\naberrations of the insane, may be explained.\nThis position seems to me as strong as the other. While studying\ndreams and the disturbances of the diseased mind, I have often had a\nvivid impression that, in some instances, they could only be the result\nof evil influences working from the outside, like demons with diabolical\nscheming and prevision. It must have struck every observer how\noften it appears as if a wicked spirit takes advantage of the weak and\nill-balanced condition of a human mind to assail it with all sorts of\ndreadful, grotesque, or weird ideas and fantasies.\nTo explain all these morbid phenomena as the work of the uncon\nscious or subliminal mind, or of a secondary personality, often seems\nforced and insufficient. Moreover, considering the matter philo\nsophically, are the terms: \"unconscious,\" \"subliminal,\" \" secondary per\nsonality,\" clearer and more scientific than the terms demon, spirit, or\nghost t Is it not often a simple question of terms 1 What difference\nis there between a secondary or tertiary personality and a possessing\ndemon ?\nThe strongest objection to this view, I think, is that we are able to\ncreate secondary or tertiary personalities by means of hypnotic sugges\ntion, and that it is unlikely that we could create demons in that way.\nBut then, again, do we know what we are doing by hypnotic sugges\ntion ? Decidedly not, as I am entitled to say after fifteen years of\npractical experience. And is it not possible that we, by our hypnotic\nsuggestion, are working on the mind in exactly the same way, and\n\fXLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 81\ntherefore with the same results, as the invisible spirits do ? I, for my\npart, feel unable to deny this possibility.\nWe are obliged in this difficult matter to rely a good deal on our own\npersonal impressions, to judge by probability, and to form more or less\nintuitive conceptions. This may not appear very exact, but it is\nunavoidable, and we shall find a similar course pursued in many other\nbranches of science. Astronomy, for instance, is based principally on\npersonal impressions,\u2014but impressions which are verified by many\npersons, and on intuitive ideas of probability,\u2014but ideas which are\nconfirmed by repeated observation.\nMy personal impression has varied in the following manner. During\nthe first series of experiments, in November and December, 1899, 1 felt a\nvery strong conviction that the person whose relics I had brought with\nme, and who had died fifteen years ago, was living as a spirit and was\nin communication with me through Mrs. Thompson. A number of\nsmall particulars, which will be found in the notes, produced on me\nwhen taken en bloc the effect of perfect evidence. To regard these\nall as guesses made at random seemed absurd : to explain them by\ntelepathy forced and insufficient.\nBut when I came home, I found on further inquiry inexplicable\nfaults and failures. If I had really spoken to the dead man, he\nwould never have made these mistakes. And the remarkable feature\nof it was that all these mistakes were in those very particulars\nwhich I had not known myself and was unable to correct on the\nspot.\nConsequently, my opinion changed. There were the facts, quite\nas certain and marvellous as before. I could not ascribe them to\nfraud or coincidence, but I began to doubt my first impression that\nI had really dealt with the spirit of a deceased person ; and I came\nto the conclusion that I had dealt only with Mrs. Thompson, who,\npossessing an unconscious power of information quite beyond our\nunderstanding, had acted the ghost, though in perfect good faith.\nIn so doing, she must have been guided by slight involuntary\ntokens, positive or negative, on my part. How, otherwise, could she\nhave given so many true details, sufficient to create an impression of\nperfect evidence, and how otherwise would she have made mistakes\nexactly on the very points on which I was unable to correct her 1\nBut on my second visit, in June, 1900, when I took with me the\npiece of clothing of the young man who had committed suicide,\nmy first impression came back, and with greater force. I was well\non my guard, and if I gave hints, it was not unconsciously, but on\n\f82 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART\npurpose; and, as will be seen from the notes, the plainest hints\nwere not taken, but the truth came out in the most curious and\nunexpected ways.\nTake this for instance. Nelly said to me: \"You don't seem to\nhave any whiskers. I don't see your head properly, some one covers\nup your head. He [i.e. the suicide] covers up your head to show\nhow his own head was covered up. Oh, dear ! isn't it funny 1 You\nmust not cut off your head when you die,\"\nThe fact is that the head of the young man was covered up when\nhe was found dead.\nNelly did not take the hint that the first attempt at suicide had\nfailed. And yet she gave details which unmistakeably, though\nindirectly, refer to that failure ; e.g. \" when they found him he could\nnot speak \" ; and again, \" don't take me back to the horror of it \" ;\nwhich two sayings are in exact accordance with the ineffectual attempt,\nafter which he was found alive and quite conscious, but with an open\nwindpipe. The second time he shot himself through the heart and\ndied at once.\nThe following described very exactly both his character and his\nattempt at suicide. \" He would not show me any blood on his neck,\nbecause he was afraid I should be frightened.\"\nThis is quite like my dead young friend. He was very gentle\nand always tried to hide his mutilated throat in order not to horrify\nchildren or sensitive people.\nUp to the sitting of June 7th all the information came through\nNelly, Mrs. Thompson's so-called spirit-control. But on that date\nthe deceased tried, as he had promised, to take the control himself,\nas the technical term goes. The evidence then became very striking.\nDuring a few minutes\u2014though a few minutes only\u2014I felt absolutely\nas if I were speaking to my friend himself. I spoke Dutch and got\nimmediate and correct answers. The expression of satisfaction and\ngratification in face and gesture, when we seemed to understand\neach other, was too true and vivid to be acted. Quite unexpected\nDutch words were pronounced, details were given which were far\nfrom my mind, some of which, as that about my friend's uncle in a\nformer sitting, I had never known, and found to be true only on\ninquiry afterwards.\nBut being now well on my guard, I could, exactly in this most\ninteresting few minutes, detect, as it were, where the failures crept\nin. I could follow the process and perceive when the genuine\nphenomena stopped and the unconscious play-acting began. In hardly\n\fXLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 83\nperceptible gradations the medium takes upon herself the r6k of\nthe spirit, completes the information, gives the required finish, and\nfills in the gaps by emendation and arrangement.\nE.g. the Dutch names which are to be found at the beginning\nof the sitting on June 7th were written by Mrs. Thompson in her\nsleep while I was absent. These names are very remarkable, as I\nhad never heard them ; so my own telepathic influence, at least so far\nas my ordinary consciousness is concerned, was excluded. But when\nI asked Nelly who was \" Notten, Velp,\" and who was \" Zwart,\" I\ngot very quick and definite answers, purporting to come from the\nyoung suicide, which answers were afterwards found to be absolutely\nwrong. I even found that the name \" Zwart \" must have been mis\nread, and that what was really written was \" I wait.'' Nevertheless\nNelly made out of my mistake a fictitious friend of the deceased\ncalled \" Zwart,\" who shot himself in the forehead.\nThat same summer I came twice into contact with persons bear\ning the name \"Notten\" and living at \"Velp,\" but I failed absolutely\nto find out in what relation, if any, they stood to my deceased\nfriend.\nWe see here how recklessly and carelessly the control-spirit Nelly\nenters into explanations about things of which she evidently under\nstands nothing, though she has referred to them spontaneously her\nself. And we see, moreover, how easily and imperceptibly the rdle\nof any spirit is taken up by the medium, after the genuine infor\nmation has ceased.\nThe principal thing that brings this on is encouragement. As\nsoon as the control-spirit or the medium is encouraged and helped\nin an enthusiastic way, she goes on and on, making her creation\ncomplete, until nothing true or genuine is left. This accounts for\nthe dreadful muddle in which so many honest observers have\nended.\nAnd here, I think, I may make a definite and clear statement of\nmy present opinion, which has been wavering between the two\nsides for a long time. I should not give any definite statement if\nI did not feel prepared to do so, however eagerly it might be\ndesired, for I think it the first duty of a scientist and philosopher\nto abstain from definite statements in uncertain matters. And in\nobservations like these we must reckon with a very general inclina\ntion to deny on second thoughts what seemed absolutely convincing\non the spot and at the moment. Every phenomenon or occurrence\nof a very extraordinary character is only believed after repeated\n\f84 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART\nobservation. After the first experience one's mind refuses to stay\nin the unaccustomed channel of thought, and next morning we say :\n\" I must have been mistaken, I must have overlooked this or that,\nthere must be some ordinary explanation.\"\nBut at this present moment it is about eight months since I had\nmy last sitting with Mrs. Thompson in Paris, and yet, when I\nread the notes again, it is impossible for me to abstain from the\nconviction that I have really been a witness, were it only for a few\nminutes, of the voluntary manifestation of a deceased person.\nAt the same time, I feel sure that genuine direct information\nis far rarer and scarcer than the medium believes, and in good faith\nwould have us believe. I hold that a certain amount of uncon\nscious play-acting is nearly always going on at every sitting of every\nmedium, and that even our most scrupulous and careful observers,\nsuch as Myers and Hodgson, have been misled by it. I doubt not\nonly the veracity but the actual existence of the so-called control-spirits ;\nto me it seems not improbable that they are artificial creations of the\nmedium's mind, or\u2014according to the spiritist view\u2014lying and pre\ntending demons.\nIn considering what method to adopt in future investigations this\nquestion is extremely important ; since every medium gets a certain\neducation from his or her leaders or observers, and the effects of this\neducation are generally unalterable. The education, as a medium, of\nMrs. Thompson has been an immense improvement, compared with\nwhat we have been accustomed to. After all the poor mediums literally\nspoiled and bewildered by too credulous and fanatical experimenters,\nMrs. Thompson's quiet self-control and scrupulous neutrality is very\ngratifying. And yet I cannot avoid expressing my opinion that her\nwonderful faculties as a seer have been spoiled by too much credulity\nand encouragement on the part of the principal observers and leaders\nof the experiments. I have seen how soon the so-called control-spirits\nbegin to fancy and to invent when we simply entertain the idea\nof their genuine existence as controlling spirits. In my notes it\nwill repeatedly be seen that I asked : \" How do you know t \" because\nI was aware that I only heard the conclusions of the control-spirit,\nand not the direct perceptions of the seer. In the later sittings I\nstrictly abstained from talking to the control-spirit ; I took no notice\nof her, but asked for exact information of what was seen or felt by\nthe medium. This attitude was not sufficiently persevered in by\nformer observers. Most of them entered more or \"~~I\nand spoiled the purity of the experiment.\n\fXLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 85\nI may sum up my criticisms by saying, that moat observers have\nbeen, if not too credulous, then certainly too eager. This eagerness, in\ncomparison with which patience is often considered phlegmatic, is a\ngeneral weakness of the Anglo-Saxon. It accounts for his wonderful\nachievements, but also for his mistakes. And this is true also in the\ndifficult domain of psychical investigation.\nIn a remarkable article entitled, \" How it came into my head,\" Miss\nGoodrich Freer, who is herself a seer, has well pointed out this want of\npatience and passivity in psychical researchers, and the advice she\ngives we may all take to heart. Nearly all the material that has been\ncollected up to the present needs revision : a sifting of the gold of\ntruth from the ore of play-acting and fancy. We can never have a\ndefinite conception of the way in which this supernormal information\nreaches us, and we are only too much inclined to form more or less\nincomplete, materialistic, and superficial ideas about it. We speak\nof the spirit playing on the brain, as a player does on a violin or\npiano, and so on. We must also not forget that the statements\nmade come from regions where our conceptions of time are probably\ninvalid, which must, offer an insuperable bar to our powers of\nunderstanding.\nLet me mention one little fact in my experience with Mrs.\nThompson,\u2014a mere trifle in itself, but still very curious. In one of our\nfirst sittings Kelly predicted that I should get at a dinner in Cam\nbridge \"a red sauce with fish,\" which \"would not suit me.\" I asked,\n\" Why not 1 \" i but got no answer. In Cambridge the red sauce really\ntamed up, and I took some, braving the prediction, and wondering\nif it would make me ill. At the next sitting, I asked why the sauce\nwas forbidden me in the prediction, and Nelly asked, evidently at a\nloss for an answer, \" Well, don't you feel thirsty 1 \" But I did not\nfeel thirsty at all. Then she said, \"Are you a vegetable man?\" Now,\nI had never told Mrs. Thompson, or shown in her presence, that I was\na vegetarian by custom. But as the sauce was a fish sauce, and was\ncoloured with cochineal, the remark, made several days before, that it\n\" would not suit me,\" was perfectly appropriate ; yet the medium\nappeared not to understand herself the appropriateness of her own\nremark.\nThis little fact is, if well considered, full of unfathomable wonders\nfor our human mind. This trifling remark,\u2014a little joke without any\ndeeD or serious meaning, but showing supernormal knowledge of the\no, \" Why not ? \" is not recorded in the notes, but I have no\n. [Note by J. G. Piddington.]\n\f86 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART\nfuture and of my own way of life,\u2014made, as it were, by proxy and\nwithout insight into its meaning,\u2014how are we ever to grasp all that lies\nbeneath it ? Nothing in all the experiments gave me so vivid an\nimpression that the medium is simply an instrument, a tool, temporarily\nin the power of beings who live, and can even jest, in regions beyond\nspace and time.\nBut let us take care, by all means, not to represent these beings in\ndefinite forms according to our own dramatic fancy. We are sure to\nproduce what are called in anatomy \" artifacts,\" artificial instead of\nnatural forms.\nI have heard the source of this supernormal information denomin\nated by an English poet as \" the collective memory of the race,\" and\nthis broad and mystical conception, however vague, seems to me in\nsome respects the safest working hypothesis for further investigation.\nAll will readity agree when I maintain that the trance-world of a\nmedium and the world of dreams are not very far apart. In both, the\nhuman mind seems to possess some possibility of contact with a super\nhuman world, \" Anschluss am Absoluten,\" as the Germans say. In my\nnotes, I show that my own dreams, during the time of the sittings,\nprovided me with a name which I had forgotten, and which duly\nappeared at the next sitting. And while I was preparing this paper,\nnearly a year after the sittings, another dream gave me the solution of\nthe word \" Wocken.\" which, as shown in the notes, was particularly\ninsisted upon by the young suicide. It was in my dream associated\nwith the title of the only book he had written, published after his\ndeath, and for the success of which he was very anxious. (The solu\ntion seems very probable, but I cannot publish it.)\nHaving observed my own dreams for a long time, making careful\nnotes of them, and having attained the faculty of executing in my\ndreams with full presence of mind voluntary acts which I had\nplanned while awake, I arranged with the medium that I would\ncall her in my dreams after returning to Holland, and that in\nher trance she would tell an observer in England if she had heard\nmy calling. All this is recorded in the account of the sittings in\nAppendix I. at the end of this paper.\nThe result (recorded in full in Appendix II.) I may give in a few\nwords. The whole matter seems to me of great interest, and merits\nan elaborate treatment, which, in years to come, if time and ability\nallow, I hope to be able to devote to it. But this single interesting\nexperiment I will relate now, if only to draw attention to the possibility\nof the new line of investigation that it opens up.\n\fXLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 87\nIn the winter following the first series of sittings, Nelly\nannounced in the course of various seances, that on three occasions\nshe herself, and on another occasion another spirit, had come to\nvisit me in my dreams. In two instances these visits corresponded\nclosely in time with dream visions of my own, which I had recorded\nin my diary previously to the receipt of letters from Mr. Pidding-\nton giving details of Nelly's statements, and in all four instances\nthere is evidence of telepathic rapport between Nelly and myself.\nThe second instance is the most remarkable. For then, in my\ndream, I made what I thought to be a mistake and called out\n\"Elsie, Elsie,\" instead of \"Nelly.\" I put down the fact in my\nnotes the next morning, the name Elsie being absolutely without\nany meaning and quite strange to me.\nTwo days later I got a letter telling me that Nelly's spirit friend,\nElsie, had heard me calling, and that she had been sent by Nelly\nto answer me. So my mistake was no mistake ; the name Elsie,\nthough strange to me, had come into my head by some mysterious\ninfluence, and the message across the channel was received.\nI have the notes and the letters to show to any one who takes\na serious interest in such matters.\nAfter this, the communication stopped; only Nelly seemed to be\naware of two slight indispositions on my part; but the dream ex\nperiments wholly failed.\nI will conclude this brief account by saying that I see before us a\nlimitless domain of strange knowledge and the possibility of most\nimportant investigation, but that we need in this, more than in\nany other branch of science, patience and prudence. Nowhere are\nwe in such great danger of complete error and entanglement, We\ncan form hypotheses, eschatologies, whole religious systems, accord\ning to our fancy, and the docile medium will show us all our\nchimeric constructions in full action and bewildering semblance of\nreality.\nTo avoid such pitfalls we must check all undue eagerness and\nimpatience in this most delicate and subtle of scientific quests,\nwhich concerns the human soul and the superhuman world where\nwith it is conjoined. Passive in observation, patient in action,\nprudent in advance, we must refrain from seeking to unveil with\nover-hasty hands the secrets yet hidden from us by the Eternal\nGod.\n\f88 Dr. F. van Eeden.

P.) \" Tell Dr. van Eeden he kept calling me last night (i.e.\nJan. 4-5). He was inside those curtains. He wears curtains round his bed ;\nhe was inside them and he called me. I went to him and I think he knows\nit. He told me so, and he is waiting to hear if you send my message. He\nwas asleep. 'Now, Nelly, you come to me and remember,' he cried out.\nHis wife was stout. . . . He was in bed alone, not with his wife, he was by\nhimself. He had had a hard day's work, yet was sufficiently awake to\ncall me.\"\nJ. G. P. sent a transcript of the above to Dr. van Eeden and\nreceived the following reply :\nWalden, Bussum, Jan. 10, 1900.\nDear Mr. Piddington,\nIn the diary of my dreams I find on January 3rd that I had what I call a\n\"clear dream \"with full consciousness on the night of [Jan.] 2-3, between\nTuesday and Wednesday. In those dreams I have power to call people and\nsee them in my dream. I had arranged with Nelly that I should call her in\nthe first dream of this sort, and I did so on the said night. She appeared to\nme in the form of a little girl, rather plump and healthy-looking, with loose,\nlight-coloured hair. [Note that at sitting on Nov. 29, 1899, Nelly had\ndescribed her hair as black and curly, in van E.'s hearing. See note ad loc\\,\np. 90.\u2014J. G. P.] She did not talk to me, but looked rather awkward or embar\nrassed, giving me to understand that she could not yet speak to me ; she had\nnot yet learned Dutch. This was the second dream of the sort after my stay in\nEngland. The first occurred on Dec. 11. In this dream I also tried to call\nNelly, but it was no success. Some grown-up girl appeared, who spoke\nDutch, and as my consciousness was not quite clear, I had forgotten that she\nwas to be English.\nThe particulars are true. I slept alone, in the bed with the curtain, or\nrather drapery, hanging before it. I was extremely tired, and slept deeply\nand soundly, which is always a condition for that sort of dream.\nThe mistake about the date does not seem very important, as it WM\nprobably the first sitting you had after Jan. 3.

After the letter from London, I made the plan to tell\nNelly in my dream the name \" Walden \" ; afterwards to tell her to think of\na little monkey of mine that died some time ago.\nThe dream began with a great popular festival somewhere near Brussels.\nThe music was very pleasant to me. Then I walked away towards moun\ntains, and found myself before a large bay or inlet of the sea. Then I got\nfull consciousness and recollected my plans. At first I called out \" Elsie !\nElsie!\" but then remembering that this was wrong I called \"Nelly! Nelly!\"\nNobody came. I became anxious, feeling that she would not come, and\n'ailed \" Nelly, you must come, and think of Walden, Walden. That's where\nI live.\" I did not pronounce the word monkey. I awoke without having\nseen anybody.\n(3) Sittings were held on Jan. 23rd, Jan. 25th, and Feb. 1st, 1900,\nbut no reference was made to Dr. van Eeden.\nExtract from record of sitting of Feb. 6th, 1900, at Mrs. Thompson's\nhouse.

That's how I\nsensed he wasn't well ; and there's a boy who isn't very well at his\nhouse.\"\nDr. van Eeden wrote on receiving the transcript of the notes of this\nincident :\nOn Wednesday, Jan. 24, I went again to my hut and slept there, though\nnot yet quite \" frisky.\" I had no dreams about Nelly, as my \" clear \" dreams\nonly come when I am healthy and well-disposed. My boys were in good\nhealth all the time. I saw Nelly in my dreams on Jan. 20th and talked\nwith her : on Febr. 1st she seemed to turn back as soon as I saw her.\nAlthough it has not been possible to fix with certainty the day of\nMrs. T.'s visit to Mrs. C., nor the Thursday on which Mrs. T. had\nneuralgia, yet it seems clear that knowledge was obtained of Dr. van\nEeden's state of health at the time in some supernormal manner.\n(4) The next sitting was on April 19th, 1900, J. G. Piddington\npresent alone. In the course of it Nelly, independently of any hint\nfrom J. G. P., said :\n\"Dr. van Eeden and I were talking last night. I couldn't make him\nunderstand. He wasn't like asking me to talk like the time before, but he\nknew I was there. He's going to have a sort of breakdown in his health\nbefore August.\"\nJ. G. P. \" How can you foretell that ?\"\nNelly. \" I see a picture of him in his bed\u2014wanting nourishment. He's\nprostrated, unfit for work. He's doing some writing, and he shouldn't\ngo on with it.

Being accustomed to work in\nthe fields every day, I took up that work again very soon in rather cold\nweather. This brought me down again, with fever, pain in the muscles, etc.\nI gave up labour for a few days until I seemed to be strong again and began\nauew, but again with the same result. This has occurred thrice until I\nresolved to stop manual labour for a fortnight. All this corresponds pretty\naccurately with what Nelly has been saying. On April 19, however, I ^C-as\nall right again, and I have been doing my usual work without hindrance\nsince that time. I think there is no reason to see a prediction in her state\nments, as they correspond so exactly with the facts which occurred shortly\nbefore the seance.\n\f116 J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington.

PIDDINGTON.\n[IN presenting a pseudonymous paper to the Society I am breaking\nthrough a salutary rule. I should therefore state that the gentleman\nwho is here called Mr. J. 0. Wilson wrote the paper at my special\nrequest. It seems to me far better for the actual sitter, if a careful\nand intelligent observer and thoroughly conversant with the problems\ninvolved, to record his own impressions of the phenomena than for a\nthird person to intervene with his opinion of matters with which be\nis only indirectly concerned. Mr. Wilson was an admirable sitter,\ncautious and discrete, yet sympathetic. Nelly hit off one of his charac\nteristic traits with her usual bluntness : \"This gentleman would tell\nthe truth, he'd own to everything\"; in other words, Mr. Wilson,\nthough of a critical disposition, yet exhibited none of the reluctance,\nwhich is, I fear, not uncommon with sceptics, to admit the correctness\nor the approximate correctness of statements made by the medium in\ntrance.\nMr. Wilson's reasons for concealing his identity appear to me satis\nfactory.

WILSON.\n[This statement was originally written 0n March 16th, 1901, and revised\nand enlarged September 28th, 1901.]\nI have never met Mrs. Thompson before, between, or after the two\nsittings of January 18th and January 25th, 1900; and on these occa\nsions we had the very slightest afternoon-tea conversations before she\nwent into a trance. I am very clear that she could have learnt nothing\nabout me from anything said in her presence by Mr. Piddington or\nmyself beyond the two details mentioned in the notes above that I\nhad sometimes made reports of sermons for newspapers and that I\nknew Mr. Myers. But Mr. Myers knew nothing of the circumstances\nwith which the sittings were concerned, beyond the bare fact of the\ndeath of the lady who is here called Miss Clegg. With the general\noutline of the circumstances it will be seen that Nelly showed no\nacquaintance.\nAbsolutely no one except Mr. Piddington and myself knew when my\nsittings with Mrs. Thompson were to be, though a sister of mine living\nin the country, who had had previously some sittings with Mrs.\nThompson, had suggested my seeing her, and knew that a sitting was\nto be arranged for me.i The sister and brother with whom I am\nliving in London knew I was seeing something of Mr. Piddington,\nbut had no thought of my taking any personal interest in psychical\nmatters.\nIn connection with the possibility of Mrs. Thompson's having in her\nown conscious person obtained the information given, one or two\ni Mrs; Thompson was unaware of the relationship between us, and has never\nheard my name.\n\fXLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson* 12D\nfurther points may be noted at once : (1) As shown above, she could\nscarcely have obtained this except through Mr. Piddington, and he\nknew very little indeed of my personal life. We had then been\nacquainted for a short time only; I doubt if we had actually met\nas many as five times. He was not even at all accurately acquainted\nwith my reasons for wishing to have a sitting, being under the\nimpression that I had recently lost a wife and was left with several\nchildren. Whereas I have never been married, but was engaged at\nthe time of her death to Miss Clegg, who was killed in a bicycle\naccident in the summer of 1899, and with whom Nelly was supposed\nto be in communication. Mr. Piddington had never heard this\nlady's Christian or surname. (2) If, however, Mrs. Thompson had,\nin her own person, obtained any knowledge of me, Nelly certainly\nmade no use of it. She gave no information about me and showed\nscarcely any interest in me, but confined her remarks entirely to\nMiss Clegg. The one fact mentioned about me\u2014that a brother of\nmine had died as a baby \u2014 is common to many people, and as it\noccurred before I was born, is not likely to have been elicited by\nordinary investigation.\nOn the other hand, she gave the right Christian name for Miss Clegg,\nand had no idea of mine. She gave a very close and correct indication\nof where Miss Clegg lived, and showed no knowledge of my home.\nAlmost all the other persons correctly named were friends of Miss\nClegg's, and only associated with me through her.\nYet, on the supposition of fraud, Mrs. Thompson could only have\nobtained information about Miss Clegg, of whom Mr. Piddington and\nMr. Myers knew nothing, through what she might have been able to\nfind out about me. Had she done so, it would have been almost\ninevitable that she should endeavour to make her statements about the\ndead more convincing by the parade of more startling knowledge of the\nliving. It would have been easy, and natural, to try to obtain my\nconfidence in the \" communications \" from Miss Clegg by making it\nclear that she had experienced no difficulty in \" discovering \" me.\nI have no desire whatever to bring forward these points as an\nargument that the facts given by Mrs. Thompson are more likely to\nhave come from direct communication with a \" spirit \" than from\ntelepathic insight into my consciousness. There seems to me little or\nnothing in these sittings that adds to the evidence for communication\nfrom the dead, and indeed certain details, which I shall mention later,\ntend rather to suggest that Mrs. Thompson's impressions were actually\nguided by my thoughts and interests at the time of the sittings.\n\f130 \u00ab J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART\nI am here only concerned to bring out my general impression that\nMrs. Thompson's statements do not show any of the kind of knowledge\nwhich might have been most naturally and easily obtained through in\ngenious \" fishing \" or deliberate fraud. This consideration affords much\nstronger evidence in support of her \"genuineness \" than my saying that\nshe could not havefound out this or that fact. I am led to the same\nconclusion by noticing that while the information given about Miss\nClegg was largely concerned with intimate details particularly signifi\ncant to me, it left entirely untouched the striking manner of her death\nand the most obvious facts about her everyday life. These must have\nbeen the first discoveries of any fraudulent investigations, and Mrs.\nThompson could hardly have failed to make use of any such knowledge,\nif only for the purpose of convincing me at once that Nelly was speaking\nof the right lady. On the supposition that the information had been\nobtained by fraud, it is sufficiently correct to prove that Mrs. Thompson\nhad rightly conjectured Miss Clegg's identity ; while it would have been\nimpossible for her to have found out (through ordinary channels) so\nmuch without discovering more, and inconceivable that she should\nnot have used such information\u2014to give me confidence.\nIt is now more than a year since these two sittings took place, but\nthe perfectly definite impressions produced on my mind by them are as\nclear to-day as they were then, and have been confirmed by three\nrecent examinations of Mr. Piddington's notes.\nI have carefully gone over the notes again by myself, with Mr.\nPiddington, and with one of Miss Clegg's sisters. There is no doubt\nabout which of the statements made by Nelly are true and which are\nfalse, and on this matter the authority of Miss Clegg's sister entirely\nsupports my own conclusions, while it enables me to be positive in the\nfew details about which I was uncertain. This lady did not see the\nnotes or know anything of the sittings until March, 1901. She now\nfeels with me that the number and character of the facts correctly\nstated are very remarkable.\nThe first impression I carried away from my sittings with Mrs.\nThompson was of her clear and unhesitating manner. She never\nbrought out the first syllable of a name under her breath in order to\nfeel her way towards its completion. Nearly every sentence was spoken\ncontinuously, so that the fact or idea to be conveyed was seen to have\nbeen in her mind before she began to speak, and was not in any way\n\"fished\" for. I should say that on the whole she gave a stronger impres\nsion of definiteness, both in true and false statements, than can be con\nveyed by Mr. Piddington's literal and most exact report. A series of\n\fXLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 131\ndetached statements may easily look more vague on paper than they\nsound in conversation, and they may suggest (what would be quite\nuntrue of these instances) that more was said or done than is herein\nreported. Mr. Piddington has clearly indicated the few occasions on\nwhich he thought it wise to direct\u2014or divert\u2014Nelly's attention, or\nwhen he answered her questions ; and I am sure that he never did so\nin any other case. He has also noted everything I did or said myself\nwhich could have influenced Mrs. Thompson, the fact being that\nI scarcely spoke at all. There were several instances in which the\ntemptation was very strong to lead Nelly on by asking questions, or\nsuggesting that she should pursue a hint, but 1 saw that my doing so\nwould largely destroy the evidential value of anything she might say,\nand I rigidly maintained the silence which Mr. Piddington had enjoined\non me. He was himself so seldom aware at the time of whether\nNelly's statements were true or false that he could not have given her\nmuch assistance.\nMrs. Thompson, both in her own person and when speaking for\nNelly, struck me as singularly sincere ; and while I have already noticed\nthe absence of the slightest attempt at \"fishing\" in her trance-talk, it\nmay be well to add further that when in a normal condition she made\nno attempt whatever to \" draw \" me, directly or indirectly. She made\non me the impression of scarcely giving me any personal attention\nexcept what was required by the ordinary courtesies of conversation,\ntalked very little at all, and for the most part on her own affairs. To\ndo this was to miss an obvious opportunity for fraud, if fraud were\ndesigned, as any sitter in my circumstances would have been in a\nsomewhat strained mental condition and, if led into conversation of\nany significance, whether personal or theoretic, would almost infallibly\nhave betrayed himself unconsciously. By practically leaving me alone,\nMrs. Thompson provided an undesigned and effective witness to her\nsincerity. It seemed to me, again, perfectly obvious that she was\ngenuinely quite unaware of what Nelly had told us. On such a point\nit is, of course, almost impossible to produce evidence, but the extreme\nsimplicity and easiness of Mrs. Thompson's transitions from trance to\nwakefulness unquestionably produce a strong impression of absolute\ntruthfulness.\nThe information given was undoubtedly all familiar to Miss Clegg\nduring her life-time, except the remarkablefftatement about money in\nthe post-office. It was also known to a few other persons now living,\ne.g. her mother and sisters. Most of it was immediately recognisable\nas true or false by myself, but there are two facts which I did not\n\f132 J. 0. Wilson and J. 0. Piddington. [PART\nconsciously know at the time, and which I am not aware of having\never known: namely, (1) that Miss Clegg had worked a cushion in\ncross-stitch, which still existed; and (2) that her father wore pince-nez.\nIt is, of course, just possible that these facts had once been mentioned\nto me, and that they had remained in my sub-conscious memory ; but\nI am fairly certain that I never knew the second fact,\u2014that Mr. Clegg\nused to wear pince-nez. He died before I ever met Miss Clegg or had\neven heard her name, and it is not shown in the photographs of him\nwith which I am familiar.\nThe names and facts given were in the main particularly associated\nwith my own relationship towards Miss Clegg, though certainly not, in\nevery case, those I should first think of in connection with her. A\nvery intimate girl cousin named Dorothy, for instance, is mentioned,\nwho died before I knew the family ; but I am familiar with her picture,\nand my brother is married to her (Dorothy's) sister. The Mar\ngaret also mentioned is the third sister in Dorothy's family, and an\nintimate friend of mine. The room which figures so conspicuously in\nNelly's visions is one which had only become Miss Clegg's since 1898,\nand had earlier associations with quite other members of her family.\nNo events of her life before my knowledge of her are alluded to, and\nno friends of her childhood, except her father and the Dorothy afore\nsaid.\nIndeed much of the information dealt directly with matters on\nwhich my mind had been busy during the months since her death. I\nwas living at that time at her mother's house, and using as my own the\nroom with \" the funny bookcase \" and the creaking chair. I had been\nhaving a good deal of trouble about the small sum of money left in the\npost-office at her death. The \" girl in a blue dress,\" who was a younger\ncousin (not in the same family as Margaret and Dorothy), was also\nstaying with Miss Clegg's mother at the time, and was always a great\nfavourite with me.\nIt is important to say in connection with \"the girl in the blue\ndress,\" that Mr. Piddington and myself are perfectly clear that\nNelly never confused her with Miss Clegg, to whom she referred\nas \"the lady,\" or \"the lady with the stocking,\" etc. It is not\nquite possible to convey this impression by a literal report of Nelly's\nwords, but we were never in any doubt as to which of the two she\nwas speaking of, and we could always see that she kept the two\nclearly apart in her own mind. She was apparently aware of the\ndanger to be avoided, and once stated emphatically that the two\nwere not the same.\n\fXLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 13-3\nI may add, perhaps, a few words about the articles belonging to Miss\nClegg, which were handed to Mrs. Thompson. The stocking had not\nbeen washed since it was worn by Miss Clegg, though it had been put\naway for the wash a few days before her death when she was in per\nfectly good health. I had myself carefully preserved it in this\ncondition with a view to possible sittings.\nThe purse had been constantly used by Miss Clegg, and was in her\npocket at the time of the accident from which she died.\nThe slip of paper was taken from a drawer in the book-case con\ntaining diaries, account books, etc., and had written on it rough notes\nof small expenditures.\nThe ring was Miss Clegg's engagement ring. As I have myself\nalways worn this since her death in addition to my own engagement ring,\nit would have been easy for Mrs. Thompson to notice my having two,\nand she might have observed that one of them looked like a lady's ring.\nThis might possibly have suggested to her that I had been engaged,\nbut not married.\nNote by J. G. Piddington on three incorrect statements made by Nelly\nabout Miss Clegg.\n(Sitting of January 18th, 1900.) \"She wasn't a lady of great\njewelry, but had ear-rings like little bee-hives.\"\n(Sitting of January 25th, 1900.) \"It wasn't only her leg, but\nvaricose veins as well under her thigh.\"\n\" A peritonitis feeling about this letter. It's like Auntie A-'s\nperitonitis\u2014that sort of pain\u2014toothache in your inside.\" (See also the\nnote which precedes record of sitting of January 25th, 1900.)\nThe foregoing paper and record were read at a meeting of the Society\nheld on November 29th, 1901, at which Mrs. Thompson was present.\nAssuming that Mrs. Thompson has no recollection of what she says\nwhen in trance, this was her first opportunity of acquainting herself\nwith the subject matter of Mr. Wilson's sittings.\nOn November 30th, Mrs. Thompson wrote to me as follows :\nMr. Piddington,\nHow Nelly does mix things ! My sister died eight years ago of peri\ntonitis. . . . She had a gold brooch and ear-rings exactly as Nelly described,\nand (with the aid of a magnifying glass) you will see in the enclosed photo.\nthe identical brooch and ear-rings. When a girl at home she suffered with\nvaricose veins, but I do not know if she had suffered in that way before her\ndeath, as I did not see her for several vears.\n\f334 J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART\nThe ear-rings convinced me Nelly must mean my sister, as never before or\nsince have I seen any of that particular pattern. In the photograph the\nlittle \" bee-hive \" does not show very well, but it was formed of a very fine\ntwisted gold wire.\nYours sincerely,\nROSALIE THOMPSON.\nAt an interview on December 3rd, 1901, Mrs. Thompson gave me\nthe following additional.information, viz. :\nHer sister, Mary Alethea Turner, died of peritonitis, in the month of\nOctober, 1893, at Handsworth, eight or nine days after childbirth.\nShe possessed little jewelry, but had and often wore a brooch and ear\nrings, on each of which was a design, worked in twisted gold wire, re\nsembling a bee-hive, and she was in the habit of referring to these\nornaments as \" my bee-hives.\" Another sister, Annie Wade Middleton,\nunmarried, also died of peritonitis at the age of twenty-two, on March\n21st, 1894, five months after Mrs. Turner's death. Both sisters had\nbeen attended by Dr. Foster, of Handsworth, both died in the same\nhouse, and both were buried in the same grave in old Handsworth\nchurchyard.\nSome of the facts here mentioned have no immediate bearing on the\nthree points in question, but Mrs. Thompson readily consented, at my\nrequest, to give such details, in order to facilitate the verification of her\nstatements.\nI am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Benjamin Davies, an Associate\nof the Society, residing in Edgbaston, for a full and careful corrobora-\ntion of such of Mrs. Thompson's written and verbal statements as\nrelate to the illnesses and deaths of her sisters. In the certificate of\ndeath of Mrs. Turner, of which Mr. Davies has sent me a duly certified\ncopy, the cause of death is given as \"Childbirth, 13 days, Phlebitis, 7\ndays, Peritonitis, 3 days.\"\nIn the certificate of death of Miss Annie Wade Middleton (of which\nI have also received a certified copy) the cause of death is given as\n\" Peritonitis.

Davies -writes :\nFinding that this disease was not mentioned in either of the certificates of\ndeath, I went to interview the doctor who attended the sisters, viz., Dr.\nFoster, of Hall Road, Handsworth. Dr. Foster, being himself a student of\npsychical phenomena, took a particular interest in the inquiry directly I\nmentioned the purpose of my visit, and very kindly offered all possible\nassistance.\nDr. Foster, speaking from memory, was quite certain concerning the\nvaricose veins, saying that they certainly did not exist in either case. Dr.\n\fXLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 135\nFoster is of opinion, however, that the phlebitis in Mrs. Turner's case\nmight quite easily have led the medium to describe the disease as \"vari\ncose veins.\"\nOn December 5th, 1901, I received the following letter from Mrs.\nThompson, who had written to her sister, Mrs. Eudge, with reference\nto the varicose veins :\nDecember 4th, 1901.\nEnclosed you will find my sister Harriet's letter (Mrs. Rudge's) in reply to-\nmy question if she knew anything of Pollie's (Mrs. Turner's) varicose veins.\nI also asked Mrs. Rudge if she knew where the \" bee-hive brooch and ear\nrings\" were, and also if Mrs. Turner had any other ear-rings.\nYou will find a full reply to my questions.\nI can honestly state I never knew of the \" thigh veins,\" or of any at all\nafter my sister's (Mrs. Turner's) marriage. ... I have cut away from my\nsister's letter the part not bearing upon the subject.\nMrs. Rudge's letter was as follows :\n51 C\u2014 Road, R\u2014 Park, Dec. 4, 1901.\nMy dear Rosa,\nI fear I shall not be able to give you very much information, for my\nmemory is, and always was, so bad. I never seemed at home much with\nPollie [i.e. Mrs. Turner], and so never heard her say anything about veins in\nher single days. But after marriage she had them, and on the inside of her\nthigh, I know, just before G was born, she suffered a good deal with\nthem. . . .\nNow as regards brooch and ear-rings, I do not know for certain, but I\nbelieve A has them. I believe some one said they saw her with them\non\u2014feel almost sure. I never knew her with any others except plain ones,,\nthose you wear first when the ears are pierced. . . .\nYour affectionate Sister,\nHARRIETT.\nIt appears then that Mrs. Rudge does not corroborate, though she\ndoes not contradict, Mrs. Thompson's recollection that Mrs. Turner\nsuffered from varicose veins before her marriage. Mrs. Rudge admits\nthat her memory is not very clear, aud her statement that Mrs. Turner\nhad varicose veins after marriage must not be taken as conclusive, for\nit is plain that her one definite recollection is of Mrs. Turner's condition\nshortly before the birth of her child, when the symptoms were perhaps\nnot due to varicose veins but to phlebitis. But I see no reason for\ndoubting Mrs. Thompson's statement that her sister, Mrs. Turner,\ndid suffer from varicose veins, as this complaint, she tells me, is common\nto other members of her family, and some support is independently\nafforded to her statement by the fact that persons who suffer from\n\f136 J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART\nvaricose veins are somewhat more liable to phlebitis than the generality\nof people.\nI have examined, under a magnifying glass, the two photographs of\nMrs. Turner, in one of which she is shown wearing the brooch and ear\nrings, and in the other the brooch only. I cannot categorically state\nthat the ornamentation does represent a bee-hive, but it certainly re\nsembles one closely. A jeweller to whom I submitted the photographs\nis of the same opinion, and was quite certain that the design was, as\nMrs. Thompson stated, worked in gold wire.\nIn face of this fresh evidence, I think it cannot reasonably be doubted\nthat the three statements (bee-hive ear-rings, varicose veins, and peri\ntonitis) wrongly given by Mrs. Thompson in trance in connection with\nMiss Clegg, owe their origin to reminiscences of Mrs. Thompson's dead\nsister, Mrs. Turner, which \"Nelly\" got hold of, but used in a wrong\nrelation. But because the source of Nelly's information has thus been\ntraced, the problem presented is none the less puzzling,\u2014indeed, if\nanything, the puzzle is all the greater.\nI fail to see how any hypothesis involving conscious fraud on Mrs.\nThompson's part can provide a solution.\nIf we regard Nelly as merely a secondary personality and invoke\ntelepathy from some living mind as an explanation, we must assume\nthat this secondary consciousness, while cognisant of the personality\nof the sister Annie and of the fact that this sister suffered from\nperitonitis, can only discover certain definite facts which would have\nbeen true of the other sister, Mrs. Turner, but cannot assign\nthese facts to the right person, although that person is the\nmedium's own sister; and moreover associates them wrongly with\nanother person, between whom and Mrs. Turner there is no connec\ntion whatever.\nIf, however, Nelly is the spirit of Mrs. Thompson's daughter, then,\u2014\nunless her powers of communication happen to have been obstructed at\nthis particular point by some fortuitous defect in the \" machine,\"\u2014we\nmust assume that her knowledge is limited in a curious manner :\u2014\nthat she knows her Aunt Annie, but does not know her aunt Mrs.\nTurner, nor recognise her when she sees her, although the two photo\ngraphs which I have seen show that a strong family likeness existed\nbetween Nelly's mother, Mrs. Thompson, and Mrs. Turner. But some\nlight is perhaps thrown on this point by information furnished me by\nMrs. Thompson in a letter dated December 23rd, 1901, in which she\nstates that whereas \" Aunt Annie \" was a constant visitor at her\nhouse and often helped to attend Nelly during her illness, Mrs. Turner\n\fXLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 137\nnever saw Nelly, and there had been but rare intercourse between herself\nand Mrs. Turner for some years before the latter's death.\nOn December 3rd, 1901, I went carefully through the record of Mr.\nWilson's sittings with Mrs. Thompson, but she did not discover any\nother references which could be applied correctly to her sister, Mrs.\nTurner.\nIn conclusion, I may remark that there was and is no connection of\nany kind between Miss Clegg or Mr. Wilson and Mrs. Thompson or\nher sisters or family.\n\f138 Dr. Richard Hodgson. [PART\nV.\nREPORT ON SIX SITTINGS WITH MRS. THOMPSON.\nBY RICHARD HODGSON, LLD.\nI ATTENDED six sittings with Mrs. Thompson in July and August,\n1900, and quote here the detailed records of these, so far as they\nconcern myself or the lady present at the first two sittings.\nPseudonyms have been substituted for the real names in the case\nof this lady and the most important incidents connected with her.\nThe portions omitted concern Mr. Myers, or other previous sitters, and\nI learned from Mr. Myers after the series of sittings was over that none\nof these references to other matters could be regarded as having\nany evidential value. Mrs. Thompson knew who I was, and I had\ninterchanged a few words with her on at least two previous occasions.\nSo far as I know, the lady, Mrs. Barker, was unknown to Mrs.\nThompson, and was scarcely known to Mr. Myers. I knew little about\nher life and friends myself. She had visited America for the purpose of\nhaving some sittings with Mrs. Piper, and was so anxious to receive\ncommunications from her deceased husband that I arranged with Mr.\nMyers for a trial with Mrs. Thompson.\nIt will, I think, be clear on perusal of the detailed records that\nthe statements made by Mrs. Thompson concerning myself and my\nrelatives or friends do not\u2014considering the opportunities which she has\nhad for obtaining information about me\u2014suggest even prima facie any\nproof of supernormal power, and they need no special comment.\nThe statements relating to Mrs. Barker, however, notwithstanding\nthe many that were incorrect, do include such correct or partially correct\nspecific statements that the first conclusion suggesting itself to most\nreaders would probably be either that some supernormal power was\nmanifested, or that Mrs. Thompson, or her trance-personality, had\nobtained information surreptitiously.\nI may say here at once that the view which the consideration of\nthese six sittings inclined me to take is that Mrs. Thompson exhibited\nno supernormal power at all during their occurrence, and that she was\n\fxr.iv.] Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 139\nin a normal state the whole time. Mrs. Barker, at the time of her\nsittings, independently reached and still holds the same conclusion as\nmyself. In the detailed records, of course, I made notes under the\nheadings of \"trance,\" etc., in accordance with what the manifestations\npurported to be, and the reader can form his own judgment of the\napparently incriminating circumstances from the notes appended to\nthe sittings in connection with some further comments and analysis\nwhich I give here on some of the most important statements concerning\nMrs. Barker. My own view of the methods which I suppose were\nadopted by Mrs. Thompson in acquiring and using information con\ncerning the sitter will be sufficiently indicated by the few following\npoints :\n(1) From the preliminary conversation at Sitting I. Mrs. Thompson\nobtained the information that \" three years ago or so \" the sitter was\ndesirous of having sittings. At beginning of Sitting II. Mrs. Thompson\nsays : \"Things are so difficult after three or four years.\"\n(2) Mrs. Thompson guesses (wrong) that a cap has been brought, and\non the production of the spectacle case guesses (wrong) that it belonged\nto the sitter's father.\n(3) Mrs. Barker and myself leave the room, and Mr. Myers remains.\nAfter a short time Mr. Myers left the room to call Mrs. Barker.\nI should explain here that the sittings were held in what I may\ncall Koom 2 of the S.P.R. Rooms at 19 Buckingham Street, to dis\ntinguish it from Room 1, the Library Room, usually occupied by\nMr. Bennett. The sitter and myself on this occasion, after leaving Mr.\nMyers with Mrs. Thompson, went into the general hall space outside\nthe rooms of the S.P.R. altogether.\nI suppose that during Mr. Myers' absence Mrs. Thompson looked\ninto Mrs. Barker's opened parcel, and read the address or part of the\naddress on at least one of the envelopes lying there, and thus obtained\nthe name \" Miss Dorothy Gibson.\"\n(4) Mrs. Thompson gives the name Dorothy for the sitter, who\nacknowledges it, and then guesses (wrong) that the sitter wishes to\nhear from her mother. 'See (2). Mrs. Thompson then guesses (partially\nright) \"man, his hand used to shake,\" and (wrong) that he was \"ill a\nlong time.\" Mrs. Thompson now knows definitely from her several\nguesses and from Mrs. Barker's treatment of them that the desired\ncommunicator is not the sitter's father or mother, and is a man, and\nshe guesses (wrong) that the desired communicator was named Gibson\n(probably a guess at the sitter's brother).\n(5) I return, and Mrs. Thompson expressly refers to the sitter as\nK\n\f140 Dr. Richard Hodgson. [PART\n\" Miss Gibson.\" She was, however, married nearly eight years before,\nand the letters taken to the sitting had been written to her before\nher marriage.\n(6) Mrs. Thompson indirectly asks for letters, and, as letters are\nbeing given to her, asks that they should he wrapped up, as though to\nsuggest that the furthest thing possible from her mind was the thought\nof reading anything on the envelopes. The sitter wrapped them so\nthoroughly that it would have been at least difficult for Mrs. Thompson\nto look inside the envelopes without drawing the special attention of\nthe sitter to her manipulation of the package. After a short intervnl\nMrs. Thompson requested me to arrange the letters so that her\nfingers could touch the writing. This, of course, in itself was a\nreasonable request, but it also gave opportunities for Mrs. Thompson\nto look in the envelopes or even to take the letters out, as she took\nup such a position that the articles she handled both at this and\nat later sittings were concealed from my view by the desk. The\nnotes of the sittings are inadequate as regards the articles handled by\nMrs. Thompson later on ; I believe that on the resumption of the\ntrance the articles used before were again given to Mrs. Thompson.\nWhen Mrs. Barker was alone with Mrs. Thompson she took my position\nat the desk to make notes. It is perhaps immaterial just exactly\nwhen Mrs. Thompson may have looked into the envelopes. My\nimpression at the time of the sittings was that she probably took\nthe opportunity after my leaving the room in the second part of the\nsitting. In any case I suppose that Mrs. Thompson did look insiile\nthe envelopes and read the following passages :\n\"I shall not forget the waiting-room at Altringham for a long\ntime.\"\n\"Your Sodjer, Harold,\" and other words suggesting an accepted\nproposal.\n\" 1 am glad you did not come up to town with us yesterday. I\ndrove to Waterloo, and had to take my uniform case.\"\n\" P.S. The girls sent a letter to me the other day in a parcel from\nhome, addressed H. R. Guthrie, Esq. ! ! ! \"\nAs I found by personal inspection, these passages could be easily\nread without removing the letters from their envelopes. The signa\nture at the end of one of the letters, which might also have been\nsimilarly read, was an H. B. joined together.\n(7) The relation between the above passages and various statements\nmade later by Mrs. Thompson indicate very strongly that she was\ndrawing inferences and guessing\u2014making also some interesting mistakes\n\fXLIV.] Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 141\n\u2014on the basis of the information acquired from looking inside the\nletters.\n\" You wished him good-bye when he was going on a boat\u2014he went\non a boat.\"\n\" He wants to know what his sisters\u2014the two girls\u2014are doing.\"\n\" Poor Harold is dead now.\"\n\"This dead Harold was a soldier.\" (S. \"Was he?\") \"You have\nseen him in uniform ; why do you say ' was he ' 1 \" (S. \" Ask him to\ntell me some more about his being a soldier.\")\nThe remarks here of the sitter apparently suggested to Mrs. Thompson\nthat perhaps the references to \" sodger \" and \" uniform,\" which she had\nread in the letter, might not after all mean that the person concerned\nwas a soldier. Accordingly, in the next sitting (July 31), she says,\n\"That was no soldier,\" and in the fifth sitting (August 13) she apparently\nguesses that the uniform was connected with a yacht. Later on again,\nin the sixth sitting (August 14), she goes back to the \"soldier.\"\nBut perhaps the most important passages bearing on the question of\nwhether the letters were read or not are the following :\n\" He wants to know if you remember the romantic place where he\nproposed to you.\" (S. \" Ask him where it was.\") \" He says it was\nin the station waiting-room you promised to be Mrs. Guthrie.\"\n*'No one else proposed to you at Altringham in the waiting-room.\"\nIt seems fairly clear from these that Mrs. Thompson inferred from\nthe statements read in the letters that the name of the communicator\n\u2022desired was Guthrie, and that he had proposed at a station waiting-\nroom ; not unreasonable inferences for a normal intelligence who had\nread the passages quoted above from the letters and was otherwise\nunaware of the facts of the case,\u2014but nevertheless wrong. (See the\nnotes appended to the record of the first sitting, p. 148.)\n(8) At the next sitting a handkerchief was presented with the name\nBarker on it, and the only new information of special significance\ngiven in connection with this sitting was the name Barker.\n(9) I need not lengthen this introduction by entering into further\n\u2022details concerning obvious inferences and guesses and mistakes. For\nexample, at the end of the first sitting :\n(S. \"Ask him one more thing. Does he really mean that he\nproposed in a real waiting-room ? \")\n\"No, no. He says you promised him in the waiting-room.\"\nThe point of the sitter's question was missed, as was plain from\nthe answer then, and also from the statement at the sixth sitting\n(August 14).\n\f142 Dr. Richard Hodgson. [PART\n\" It was at the station when she said, Yes, I will.\"\nIt was really at a \" dining room \" of Mrs. Barker's then residence\nwhere the proposal was made and accepted.\n(10) On the other hand there was not the slightest perception at the\nfirst sitting, on the part of Mrs. Thompson, that Mrs. Barker was a\nmarried lady. Mrs. Barker was dressed in ordinary mourning, not in\nwidow's weeds, and was very young-looking. She was nevertheless\nwearing a specially heavy wedding-ring, and I suppose that Mrs.\nThompson regarded this as a deceptive ruse. It was not till Sitting IV.\nthat any explicit mention was made of Mrs. Barker as a married lady;\nand I feel bound to say that in preliminary conversation with Mrs.\nThompson, at the beginning of this Sitting IV., the lady was, in a\nmoment of forgetfulness, spoken of as \" Mrs. Barker.\" In that sitting\nlater came the words \" Dorothy, my wife.\" That Mrs. Thompson\nherself was aware of the inferences concerning lack of supernormal\npower that might be drawn from her previous references to \" Miss\nGibson\" is indicated by her apparent attempt, in Sitting VI., to\nexplain such references.\n\" I always call that lady Miss Something. I always call her Miss\nGibson, because you see the old Grandma Gibson always speaks of her\nlike that. I say the old, because she was grandma,\u2014she wasn't old\nwhen she came to us. You know that old lady ; she's so interested\nin a soldier, a man in uniform, and she wants to take care of him for\nsome one else.\"\nUpon which Mrs. Barker's comment is : \" My father's mother died, I\nbelieve, before my birth.\"\nI should add that the letters taken by Mrs. Barker were not taken\nwith any thought of deceiving Mrs. Thompson, either by the contents\nof the letters or the addresses on the envelopes.\nMy conclusion is that the order of the events, the relative sequence of\nthe knowledge exhibited by Mrs. Thompson, and the erroneous inferences\nfrom the written words on or in the envelopes, all combine to show that\nMrs. Thompson read the words in question by normal vision. As the\norder of opportunity arose for becoming possessed of the information\nby ordinary means, Mrs. Thompson obtained it (first, the names on\nthe envelopes ; next, such contents of the letters as might be easily\nread ; last, the name on the handkerchief)\u2014and not till then.\nThe question then arises whether Mrs. Thompson in her normal\nstate acquired the information in question surreptitiously, or whether\nshe was dominated by a secondary personality to whom the surrepti\ntious procedures are to be attributed. There may be some who will\n\fXLIV.] Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 143\nadopt this latter view. For myself, I saw no reason to suppose, in the\nwhole course of my six sittings, that Mrs. Thompson was at any time\nin any \" trance \" state of any sort whatever.\nThe records are nearly verbatim, except for the passages excluded\nas having no reference to Mrs. Barker or myself. These are indi\ncated by three asterisks. Two asterisks indicate the omission of a few\nwords that were not caught or recorded at the time they were spoken,\nand I believe that these were unimportant. Dots . . . indicate pauses\nor breaks in the utterances of Mrs. Thompson ; they do not indicate\nomission of any words spoken by her. Most of the commentary notes\nwere made either immediately after the sittings or within a few days.\nAdditional notes were made in February, 1 902, in further consultation\nwith Mrs. Barker, and these are preceded by the letter A. Mrs. Barker\nwas alive to the importance of recording as fully as possible, and\nespecially of writing down exactly whatever she herself said. In one or\ntwo cases, when it was impossible to give the exact words, I gave the\nsubstance of the remark or remarks in square brackets. Comments\nmade after the sittings are also in square brackets, and the remarks of\nthe sitters at the sitting are in round brackets.\nDETAILED RECORDS OF SITTINGS.\nSITTING I.

[PART\nVI.\nNOTE ON A POSSIBLY AUTOMATIC INCIDENT OBSERVED\nIN THE CASE OF MRS. THOMPSON.\nBY ALICE JOHNSON.\nIN his Introduction (see above, p. 65) Dr. Lodge has spoken of what\nhe calls \" suspicious circumstances \" in Mrs. Thompson's sittings, when\ninformation which there is more or less reason to think was obtained\nnormally is given out by the \" control \" as if obtained supernormally.\nSupposing that in such cases the source of the information is really\nnormal, two interpretations are possible : (a) that either the medium\nor the \" control \" deliberately misrepresents the circumstances ; or\n(6) that the impressions of the medium are reproduced automatically\nby the \"control.\" Dr. Hodgson maintains the former interpretation\nof some instances that came under his observation. I give below a\ncase occurring in my own experience which appeared to me suggestive\nof the latter.\nThe account is written from my notes, made at the time of the\nsittings.\nAt my first sitting, on July 25th, 1899, I had given to Mrs. Thompson\nan envelope (A), fastened up, containing (1) a postcard, and (2) a letter\nenclosed in a second envelope (B), not fastened. She had aaked to be\nallowed to put her finger inside envelope (A), so I haul torn it open, and she\nheld it for a little while with her finger inside, I watching her meanwhile.\nI could not see that she read anything, but I think it possible that she\ncould have done so without my detecting it. There was no sign, however,\nthat she did so ; and none of the information given in the inner letter or\npostcard was reproduced. She gave the whole back to me, and I brought it\nagain to my second sitting on the following day just as it was.\nAt this sitting Mrs. Sidgwick was the only person present besides Mrs.\nThompson and myself. The sitting was chiefly occupied with statements\nabout an \" old lady,\" whom I identified as an aunt who had died on June\nllth, 1899, aged 81. The description of her was fairly correct.\nI then took envelope (B) out of envelope (A) and gave it to Mrs. Thomp\nson to hold. Envelope (B) was addressed to one of my sisters by a friend,\nB. G., who had died on July 2nd, 1899, and it contained a letter from B. G.\nto my sister. Mrs. Thompson, holding this letter, made a few rather\n\fXLIV.] Note <m a Possibly Automatic Incident. 163\nvague remarks, which were more or less applicable to R G. Then the\ntrance ended.\nEnvelope (A), still containing the postcard mentioned above, was lying\non the sofa on which Mrs. Thompson and I were sitting. Without getting\nup from the sofa, I began collecting the papers, etc., which I had brought to\nthe sitting, when suddenly Mrs. Thompson became re-entranced, and said\nin a rather excited manner, \" Put down, give my love to all at 3 Bristol\nRoad [assumed address]. That's what the old lady said.\"\n\"3 Bristol Road \" was B. G.'s address, so that the remark appeared very\nsignificant. Immediately afterwards, however, I saw that it was written at\nthe top of the postcard inside envelope (A), and could just be seen by\nlooking towards the open end of the envelope. I can hardly doubt that\nMrs. Thompson caught a glimpse of this\u2014probably quite accidentally\u2014as I\ntook it up to put it into my handbag. My impression is that she was not\nconscious that she had seen it ; and that her subliminal self or \" Nelly \" re\nproduced the percept without any idea of its real source, just as she would\nprobably reproduce any information she acquires through whatever means.\nThough \" Nelly \" often knows that some of her information is directly\nderived from Mrs. Thompson, and represents it as so coming, there seems\nevidence in other cases (e.g. in the incident of the bee-hive earrings, etc.,\nin \"Mr. Wilson's\" sittings, see above, pp. 133-7), that sometimes it really\ncomes from Mrs. Thompson, while \" Nelly \" is under the impression that it\nhas some other source.\nConsidering how much general evidence there is that different strata of\nconsciousness in the same person may remain entirely unaware of each\nother's activities ; also that the memories of different personalities may\npartially overlap, while certain regions of them remain distinct ;\u2014I see no\ndifficulty in the supposition that the part played by Mrs. Thompson in the\nincident just' described may have been purely automatic,\u2014that she had no\nintention either of obtaining information by underhand means, or of repre\nsenting it as acquired in a manner different from that in which it really was\nacquired. Mrs. Sidgwick, who also witnessed the incident, allows me to\nsay that this statement represents her view of it, as well as mine. Mrs.\nThompson's manner at the moment was, as usual, open and unembarrassed ;\nthere seemed no attempt at any concealment ; and I had, and have still,\na distinct impression of her entire sincerity in the matter.\n\f164 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nVII.\nNOTES ON THE TRANCE PHENOMENA OF MRS. THOMPSON.\nBY MRS. A. W. VERRALL.\nMRS. THOMPSON, as is probably known to many of the readers of\nthis paper, is a highly developed sensitive, a non-professional\nmedium, who has been for some years under the observation of\nMr. Myers and other members of the S.P.R., and has lent herself\nmost freely to their suggestions. The opportunities therefore of\nobservation and experiment have been exceptionally good and\nmany, and the results obtained correspondingly valuable. I pro\npose in this paper to confine myself to the description and\ncriticism of such phenomena as I have myself personally observed\nin my intercourse with Mrs. Thompson. I shall therefore not\nattempt to enumerate or classify all the abnormal occurrences\nthat have been noted in her case, nor to give an account of her\nprevious history, or the development of her powers, interesting\nas such a history would be. The present notes are only a con\ntribution to the history of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs.\nThompson, and supplementary to the records of other observers.\nUnder these circumstances I do not propose to discuss the\nquestion of fraud on the part of the sensitive ; when I come to\ntreat in detail of the facts communicated to me, I shall do my\nbest to state what opportunities there could have been for the\nnormal acquirement of the knowledge shown, and leave the reader\nto judge whether the hypothesis of fraud, conscious or unconscious,\non the part of the medium will explain the facts. At the same\ntime, I should like to say at the outset of this paper that on no\noccasion in my frequent meetings with Mrs. Thompson have I\nhad the slightest reason to suppose that she has taken any steps\nto obtain information about my concerns or those of my friends ;\non the contrary, more than once she appears to have missed obvious\nopportunities of acquiring such information. Further, scrupulous\nexactitude has been shown by her, in the normal as well as in\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 165\nthe abnormal condition, in acquainting me with any knowledge\nof my affairs of which she has become possessed. Into the question\nof how far in the state of trance when her eyes are apparently\nshut she is able to see, I shall not enter, as it is simpler to\nassume that what she could know she did know. I shall hope to prove\nthat much of the knowledge shown by her could not have been\nobtained by any normal methods hitherto recognised. The hypothesis\nof \" fraud\" seems to me in the case of Mrs. Thompson not only\nimprobable but inadequate.\nThe sittings discussed in this paper took place between April, 1899,\nand December, 1900. I first made Mrs. Thompson's acquaintance in\nJanuary, 1899, when I met her in a friend's house, by arrangement,\nand talked to her for some half-hour or so ; my husband was in the\nroom at the time, but had no conversation with her. I had no other\nopportunity of meeting Mrs. Thompson till April, 1899, when I spent\nan afternoon and evening with her, also at a friend's house ; and it\nwas then that I had my first experience of the phenomena of her\ntrance. On this occasion, the trance occurred in the presence of\nseveral persons, and the greater part of the communications were made\nby Mrs. Thompson in writing ; these communications I did not see, as\nthey referred to matters spoken of in earlier sittings with which I had\nno concern. Towards the end of the trance she made some statements\nwhich applied to me. No regular notes were taken of these, but,\nimmediately on my return, I wrote down from memory what she said\nto me, and my recollections were confirmed by Mrs. Thompson's host,\nto whom I showed my notes on the next day. This sitting is referred\nto in the following observations, but does not form one of the series\nwhich I have analysed fully for statistical purposes.\nOn all other occasions referred to in this paper, full notes were\ntaken during the sitting. At my first two sittings in July, 1899, the\nnotes were taken by Miss Alice Johnson ; at one very short and unex\npected sitting, with my daughter alone, the notes were taken by her.\nOn the other occasions I was the note-taker ; sometimes I was alone\nwith the sensitive, but more often there was another person present.\nWhen mine were the only notes taken, I went through the rough\nnotes carefully with the other sitter before writing them out, but we\nseldom found anything to correct ; once, when the other sitter had\nalso taken notes, I sent my copy to him for comparison, and received\nthem back with only one small verbal correction. The taking of fairly\nfull notes is not very difficult ; there are often pauses of considerable\nlength in the course of the sitting, and the trance personality is always\n\f166 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.

No. 8 forms part of the series of Dr.\nvan Eeden's sittings, which he has himself described, and No. 20, a\nvery short sitting, belongs also to another series. For the statistics\nwith which this paper deals I have counted all the statements made\nin Nos. 2 to 17 inclusive,i (with the exception as above stated of\nNo. 8,) so far as those statements referred to myself, my daughter\n(No. 10), Mr. and Mrs. A. (No. 9), and Miss Jane Harrison (No. 11\nand subsequently). I have not included such statements made in\nthe second and third sittings as obviously referred to Miss Johnson,\nbut wherever it was uncertain to which of the two persons present,\nMiss Johnson and myself, the trance personality was speaking, I have\ncounted the statements as made to me, so that the percentage of\nunidentified statements is probably slightly higher in those two\nsittings than in the others.\nBefore proceeding to the description and classification of the\nvarious statements made to me or in my presence by Mrs. Thompson,\nit will be convenient to say a few words as to the manner in which\nthe information has been conveyed ; I may say briefly that in my\nexperience information has been conveyed in the following ways :\n(A) Directly from Mrs. Thompson, who has transmitted to\nme in writing \" messages \" received by her when I have\nnot been present ;\n(S) Indirectly through Mrs. Thompson, entranced in my\npresence. In the trance occasionally statements have been\n'These statistics were originally compiled for a paper sent to the Paris\nCongress of Psychology in August, 1900, so that the statements in sittings\nrabseqnenr to that date have not been included. I have analysed them roughly\nand find that their inclusion would not affect the general result.\n\f168 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nwritten by Mrs. Thompson with pencil on paper, but\nusually the communications have been made by a supposed\npersonality speaking through Mrs. Thompson. The prin\ncipal personalities which have appeared within my observa\ntion claim to be :\n(a) Nelly, a child of Mrs. Thompson, who died as a baby;\n(b) Mrs. Cartwright, a former schoolmistress of Mrs. Thompson ;\n(c) A friend of my own, not long dead, whom I shall here\ncall Mrs. B.\nIn this paper, without prejudice to the question whether these\npersonalities have an independent existence or are modifications of\nthe personality of Mrs. Thompson, I shall distinguish them by using\nthe names to which claim is made. I may say that they differ\namong themselves and from Mrs. Thompson, so that there is\nno possibility of a sitter confusing them. I shall say more about\nthese personalities later on,i and will now pass to the consideration\nof the actual statements made by them.\nThe most obvious classification of the statements made is to\ndivide them according to the time to which they refer\u2014past, present,\nor future. For our purposes, things referring to the past or present,\nbeing generally known or ascertainable, may be separated from\nthings referring to the future, the truth or falsehood of which is\nnot known and cannot be immediately ascertained. Proceeding to a\nfurther classification by results, we may have, in the case of state\nments referring to the future, predictions fulfilled (true), not fidfiUtd\n\u2022(false), and unfulfilled (not yet tested), besides a fourth class too\nvague or too general to be worth noting at all. In the case of\nstatements referring to the present or the past, we have, if we\nclassify by results, three possible classes, things true, things false,\nthings unverified or unidentified. The following table sums up the\nabove classification : -\nI. Predictions :\n(A) Fulfilled (true).\n(B) Not fulfilled (false).\n((7) Unfulfilled (neither true nor false).\n(D) Not capable of classification.\ni See p. 184.\n2 For details of I., see Appendix A; for II. F, Appendix B; for II. 0,\nAppendix C ; II. E is dealt with in the paper.\n\fxnv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 169\nII. Statements referring to the present or past :\n(E) True.\n(F) False.\n(G) Unidentified or unverified.i\nInstances of nearly all the seven classes have come within my\npersonal observation. To begin with the predictions, the total\nnumber made in my presence2 is 16, of which 6 come under Class\nC, 9 under B, and 1 under A? A list of these predictions is\ngiven in Appendix A. It will be seen that they deal for the most\npart with matters of trifling importance and common occurrence.\nUnder these circumstances, as it is impossible to estimate the value\nof the results by comparing them with the ascertained number of\nsuccesses and failures in a similar series of random guesses, and as\nfarther the number of predictions not fulfilled (B) is relatively very\nlarge, I confess that I am not waiting with any particular interest or\nanxiety for the results of the predictions hitherto unfulfilled. As\nfar as my personal impression and experience go, I have had no\nreason to believe that Mrs. Thompson, or any of her personalities,\npossesses the gift of prophecy.4\nIf we pass on to the classification of statements referring to the past\nor the present, the material is much more abundant and the results,\nas it seems to me, very striking. It is difficult to count statements\nexactly when they have to be sifted out of miscellaneous conver\nsation, but I have gone carefully through the notes of my sittings5\nbetween April, 1889, and June, 1900 (sittings 2 to 7, 9 to 17, in the\nlist given above), and endeavoured to make a list of actual statements\n'I call those statements unidentified which seem to have no connexion with\nthe sitter or the sitter's concerns ; unverified statements, on the other hand,\nare statements that are definitely connected with facts or persons known to\nthe sitter, but whose accuracy it has not been possible to ascertain.\n2 Some predictions concerning me, directly or indirectly, have been made\nto other sitters, but the consideration of these does not enter into my scheme,\na> this paper deals only with my personal observations.\n'The solitary \"fulfilled prediction\" concerned the occupation at a specified\nhour of the trance personality, and therefore is not strictly speaking a pre\ndiction in the ordinary sense of the term, but as it is a statement referring\nto the future it must be classified under this head.\n* I have classed, for statistical purposes, all references to the future as\npredictions, but in many cases I think that the statements made were hardly\n*o intended. See Appendix A for full list and discussion of details.\n'Detailed reports and criticism of some of the sittings will be found in\nAppendix D.\n\f170 Mrs. A. W. Verrcdl. [PART\nmade. When the same thing has been stated more than once, I have\ncounted it as one statement. Three statements appear twice over,\nas there were at first definite false statements of facts, which, with\nno suggestion from me, were corrected wholly or partly on subse\nquent occasions. The form of correction varied ; once the control\nling personality deliberately referred to her own previous remark, and\nput it right; once the fact which had been incorrectly stated by\nNelly was correctly stated by Mrs. Thompson's handwriting in\ntrance ; once a true statement inconsistent with a previous false one\nwas correctly given without any reference to the previous version.\nTentative or vague remarks subsequently defined have been counted\nin their final form only ; these, I may say, were very few. On\none occasion Nelly made a rambling series of remarks which seemed\nat the time hopelessly confused, but the next day Mrs. Cartwright\ndisentangled and sorted the various observations and these therefore\nhave been counted as finally stated by her.i\nThe total number of statements made to me between the dates\nmentioned above has been 238 ; of these 64 come under Class G,\nunidentified or unverified; 33 under Class F, false; and 141 under\nClass E, true. It will thus be seen that the percentage is as follows :\nClass E (true), 59.\nClass F (false), 14.\nClass G (unidentified), 27.\nIn Appendix B will be found a complete list of the false statements,\nand in Appendix C a general description of those that are un\nidentified;2 here I propose to deal with the correct statements in\ndetail, and to consider what possible sources of information were\nopen to Mrs. Thompson.\nCLASS E. CORRECT STATEMENTS.\nThe reader will, I think, be prepared to admit that unless the\nstatements made were of the most commonplace and vague kind, the\nlarge percentage of correct statements excludes the possibility that the\ncause of the success is to be found in accidentally accurate guessing.\nFortune, no doubt, favours the bold, and much must be allowed for a\nlucky accident . such a percentage of success as 59 would not warrant\ni See p. 179.\n2 It should be noted that the general head of unidentified statements includes\nremarks totally differing from one another both in nature and in value. See\nAppendix C.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 171\nus in assuming a supernormal intelligence on the part of the guesser\nwere the statements like those of the ordinary \" palmist \" or the\nsociety fortune teller, such, for instance, as that a \"dark lady\nacquainted with the sitter \" had recently had a \" trouble connected\nwith money,\" or that the sitter had lost a friend through \" an\naccident\" or by \"a violent death.\" The statements that appear in\nmy notes are not of this nature ; many of them will be given in\ndetail later on, but a few specimens taken at random will serve to\nshow that we are dealing, for the most part, with perfectly definite\nstatements. I find among my notes the following statements : that\nthe sitter's husband has two brothers and one sister living ; that\na lawyer called Stephen or Steevens was intimate in a certain\nhouse ; that the sitter had been occupied during the last day or two\nin turning over sheets of paper and making corrections upon them ;\nthat the name of a new sitter introduced during the sensitive's\ntrance was (let us say) Kitty ; that a letter held by the sensitive\nhad been kept in three places, viz., a left-hand drawer, the locked-up\ncupboard of a writing table, and an old-fashioned writing-desk. I\nhave made no selection in the above enumeration ; some of the\nstatements are correct, some incorrect, but the reader will not deny\nthat they are definite.\nGranting then that accident will not account for the success shown\nby Mrs. Thompson, let us see whether statistics throw any further\nlight on the question whether the information undoubtedly possessed\nby the sensitive has been acquired normally or by some method\nor methods not hitherto generally recognised as available. I may\nsay that under the head of knowledge normally acquired I should\ninclude not only everything consciously learnt by the sensitive, but\neverything that she can have gathered from half-forgotten conversa\ntions, from the clever piecing together of clues accidentally given,\nfrom the rapid glance at written words or names that have been\nwithin her range of vision, even from so fraudulent a performance\nas the deliberate conveying to her, without her consent or know\nledge, by some other person, of ascertainable information. Thus,\nif facts obtainable from the Peerage or Who's Who, or such other\nsource, were given, not at the first interview with a stranger, but\nat a later sitting after an interval during which the sitter's name might\nhave become known, I have counted such information for my present\npurpose as normally acquired, though I must not be understood as\nthereby implying my belief that it was so acquired. So that, when\nonce a person described by the sensitive has been recognised\nM\n\f172 Mrs. A. W. Ven-aLl.

It will thus\nbe seen that the percentage of correct statements obtainable by\nthe sensitive from normal sources of knowledge is 36, so that the\nnon-ascertainable statements constitute 64 per cent., or nearly two-\nthirds of the whole number of correct statements.\nThus, after putting aside unverified or vague remarks, incorrect\nassertions, and such correct statements as were normally obtainable,\nthere remains an irreducible minimum of 90 out of the total of 238, or\n38 per cent., which are correct and not to be obtained by the sensitive\nthrough any normal recognised means of information. This large\npercentage, taken in conjunction with the detailed nature of many\nof the assertions, warrants the belief that Mrs. Thompson has some\nsource of information not generally accessible.\nWith regard to the nature of that source of information, there does\nnot yet seem to be sufficient evidence to justify a dogmatic assertion.\nThe information given, in my experience, varies considerably in dis\ntinctness as well as in value, and the general impression left upon me\nis that the source is not always the same. Occasionally, for instance,\nthere seems to be direct telepathy between the communicating\npersonality and the sitter, while on other occasions such telepathy\nis conspicuously absent. I have endeavoured to classify the informa\ntion given accprding to its possible sources, and in the account that\nfollows I have grouped the incidents together according to the class\nunder which they seem to fall. Some classification is necessary to\nguide the reader through what would otherwise be but a hopeless\ntangle of isolated facts about a stranger's concerns. It is rather with\nthe intention of stating than of solving the complex problems arising\ni Among the 51 I have reckoned 6 very remarkable statements as to the con\ntents of a certain letter which was \" psychometrised,\" as Mrs. Thompson calls\nit, for me by Mrs. Cartwright ;\u2014not that I believe the information to have been\nnormally acquired, but, as the letter was in the same bouse as Mrs. Thompson,\nand as Mrs. Thompson was once alone in the house for three-quarters of an hour,\nthough it is exceedingly unlikely that she had seen the letter, and indeed\nimpossible that she should have come across it by accident, it is not a physical\nimpossibility that she should have read it. Her statements therefore, as to its\ncontents are not counted us due to supernormal knowledge. See pp. 204-7 for\ndetailed account.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 173\nfrom the phenomena presented by Mrs. Thompson that I have adopted\nthe classification which follows.\nFACTS NOT ASCERTAINABLE BY THE SENSITIVE.\nThe correct statements of facts not ascertainable by Mrs. Thompson\nJiave been grouped under four heads :\n(a) Things known to the sitter and directly present in his\nconsciousness ;\n(6) Things known to the sitter, but not immediately present in\nhis consciousness :\n(c) Things that have been well known to the sitter, but are at the\nmoment so far forgotten as only to be recalled by the\nstatements of the medium ;\n(d) Things unknown to the sitter.\nIllustrations will make clearer the distinctions between these\n-classes : (a) Things known to the sitter and directly present in his\nconsciousness. Under this head fall all the statements as to articles\nbrought by the sitter, and all remarks about friends of the sitter\nwheu once there has been identification of the person described by\nNelly with an actual acquaintance. Thus I class under this head\nMrs. Thompson's correct statements with regard to a small locket\nwhich I had given her; namely, that it belonged to another lady\nwho had given it to me, that \"at the beginning of it all\" was an\nold dead lady called Annie or Anna, that the white hair in the\nlocket belonged to a different dead lady, not Anna. But I do\nnot put under this head but under the next (6), further correct\nstatements which she made about the old lady Annie, or about\na ring belonging to the owner of the white hair, as these further\nstatements, though true, had no sort of connexion with the locket\nand were not present in my consciousness at the time. Under\nthis head (a) comes a very striking allusion (see p. 214) to the\ncircumstances connected with the death of a certain lady, Mrs. B.,\nmade by Mrs. Thompson immediately on taking into her hands\na letter from a relative of the lady's ; the letter contained no\nreference to Mrs. B.'s death, but had been given to Mrs. Thompson\nin the hope of obtaining from her definite information concerning\nthe lady, known to both the sitter and the note-taker. Descriptions\nof objects brought by the sitter, given before the objects have\nbeen seen by the sensitive, come into this class, as do also\ninstances of apparent direct response on the part of Nelly to a\n\f174 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nthought in the sitter's mind. Some very clearly marked instances\nof this last have fallen within my own observation ; the cases are\nnot very numerous, but the response from the \"control\" to what\nhas been thought but not uttered by me has been so rapid and\ncomplete that, were it not for the evidence of the other sitter, I\nshould have been disposed to believe that I had unconsciously\nuttered the thought aloud.\nThus on one occasion Nelly said that a red-haired girl was-\nin my house that day, and I was wondering whether a certain\nfriend of my daughter's who is often at the house would be there,\nwhen Nelly added, \" Not So-and-so,\" mentioning by name my daughter's\nfriend, exactly as though I had uttered the passing thought.i Again,,\nwhen Nelly was describing a certain bag given to me for my\nbirthday, something she said made me for a moment think of a\nsmall leather handbag left in my house by a cousin and occasionally\nused by me, and she said : \" You had an uncle that died ; it was\nnot long after that.\" The father of the cousin whom I had just\nthought of is the only uncle I have known, but his death long\npreceded the giving to me of the bag as a birthday present, which\nwas what she had quite correctly been describing till my momentary\nthought apparently distracted her attention to the other bag.2 1\nhave had in all some five or six instances of such apparently direct\nresponses as the above to a thought in the sitter's mind, but when\nat Nelly's suggestion I have fixed my attention on some detail for\nthe sake of helping her to get it, I have never succeeded in doing,\nanything but what she calls \"muggling her.\"\nI pass to the next class (b), much more abundantly illustrated in\nmy experience ; things known to the sitter but not immediately at\nthe moment present in his consciousness. The greater number of\nthe correct statements made to me by Nelly come under this head,,\nso that to illustrate this class fully would be to give a complete\naccount of some of my sittings. A single illustration must suffice.\nIn what was practically my first sitting with Mrs. Thompson\u2014for I\nhad only been present once before with several other people while\nshe was entranced\u2014Nelly gave me a series of descriptive touches of\na dead lady with whom I was intimately acquainted, all of which\nwere true, characteristic, and familiar ; but they were not the leading\ntraits in this lady's personality, the points on which I should have\nseized had I wished to recall her to a third person. Nor was my\nattention fixed on this particular friend at the beginning, for I had.\ni Sec App. D, p. 231. 2See App. D, p. 242.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 175\ngiven the sensitive a small hair cross and was expecting informa\ntion about its owner. But the statements of Nelly were definite\nand accurate, referring to small details of dress,\u2014among other\nthings saying that my friend wore a black silk apron trimmed with\nlace fastened by an elastic and button round the waist, that this\napron had belonged to some one else before her (the lady had\noften told me that it was her mother's), and that she folded\nit in a particular way ; Nelly also described correctly the\nlady's objections to the low-necked frocks which my child wore\nas a baby, and imitated a habit she had of pulling up the child's\nunder-vest to cover her bare neck; she further successfully re\nproduced a facial trait of this lady, a characteristic movement of\nthe lips, and finally described her as puzzled at the situation,\ndoubtful as to the truth of Nelly's statements that I was really\npresent\u2014all this very characteristic\u2014but engaged in obtaining\nexplanations of the circumstances from Dr. Arthur Myers. There\nwas no sort of reason why Mrs. Thompson should associate the lady\nin question, had she known her name, with Dr. Myers ; as a fact\nthey had not met more than three or four times, but on those\noccasions my friend had been in the habit of discussing the\nproblems investigated by the S.P.R. with Dr. Myers, because, as she\nused to say, his explanations made the things easier for her\nto understand.i\nThese statements then, it will be seen, were definite and accurate ;\nthey were characteristic, but they were not present in my mind ;\nthey were not obvious, nor were they what I should have myself\nselected had I wished to recall memories of my dead friend to\nanother acquaintance. Other and more intimate things than details\nof dress and personal habits were in my thoughts as soon as the\ncharacteristic points given by Nelly had made me realise of whom\nshe was speaking, but to these no allusion was made. Telepathy\nthere may have been\u2014it is difficult to say where telepathy may\nnot be\u2014but it cannot be said that direct telepathy from the\nimmediate consciousness of the sitter can account for all the\nstatements that come under this second head (b), as might be said\nof the statements classed under (a).\nThe third class (c) contains \" things that have been well known\nto the sitter, but are at the moment so far forgotten as to be\nrecalled only by the statements of the medium.\" It is not always\n\u00abasy to draw the line between this class and the preceding one, but\ni See App. 1), Sitting 2, p. 223.\n\f176 Mrs. A. W. VerraU. [PART\nthe distinction is between the things that are not prominent in one's\nmind and the things that have altogether passed out of one's\nsupraliminal consciousness, though the mention of them recalls\nthem to memory. Under this head (c) comes Nelly's mention\nof carpet slippers with foxes' or animals' heads upon them in\nconnexion with a certain dead Theodore who \"belonged\" to me.\nOnly one Theodore \" belongs \" to me, and such points in the\ngeneral description as were given seemed to be appropriate. My\nrecollections of this Theodore were few, though fairly vivid ; he had\ndied about five years before the sitting, having lived in Australia\nfor the last thirty years of his life. I had written to him shortly\nbefore his death, but had had no answer and had not seen him since\nI was a child of five or six years old, when I knew him well. At\nfirst I could attach no memory to the slippers with their foxes'\nheads, but a recollection came back, was strengthened by time and\nconfirmed by the remembrances of other members of my family, that\nI had worked him some slippers, putting in the ground behind the\nfoxes' or animals' heads which were on the work when it was\nbought. Nelly's definite account of my working the slippers, given\nat a later interview, comes under class (a), as I then asked her about\nTheodore, with the intention of seeing whether her information\nwould be more complete now that my recollection was more\ndefinite, but the early reference at my very first interview to\nTheodore's slippersi comes under the head of more than half-\nforgotten things.2\nThe next class (d)\u2014things unknown to the sitter\u2014is the most inter\nesting, as the information given can hardly be due to telepathy, unless\nwe are to give to the word a much wider significance than has hitherto\nbeen done. Communication with the mind of the sitter will not\nexplain the correctness of statements demonstrably unknown to the\nsitter's consciousness, and if such statements occur too frequently to\nbe ascribed to chance, we must seek for their explanation some\nother source of information, such as clairvoyance, or communication\nin some form with the minds of persons absent and unknown to\ni As perhaps throwing some light on the origin of Kelly's information in the\nfirst instance, I (nay say that I have many recollections of Theodore mnch\nmore vivid than the slippers are, even now after many efforts to recall their\nstory ; but I think that Theodore can have had very little knowledge about me,\nand if pressed to say something of me, would probably have known only two\nthings\u2014that I was my mother's daughter, and that I had once worked him\nsome slippers.\n8 See App. D on Sitting 2, p. 227.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson, 177\nthe sensitive, perhaps even of the dead. It may be said that it\nis difficult to demonstrate that any particular fact is and has\nalways been unknown to a sitter, especially if, while granting the\npossibility of telepathy, we further suppose that what is known to\na person's habitual associates may have been communicated to that\nperson's subliminal self. But for the purposes of my present paper\nthere is a clearly defined class of things unknown to the sitter, and\nthis is the class of which I am speaking.\nThe number of cases of this kind has been small in my experience\u2014\nten in all; and I propose to relate them here in detail,i adding such\ninformation as I have been able to obtain as to the possession by\nothers than the sitter of the knowledge shown, so that the reader\nmay judge what is likely to be the sensitive's source of information\nin each case. Some of the cases are in themselves trifling, and\nwould be of little interest if they made part of a long series of\nrandom guesses. But in the rarity of such random guesses, com\nparatively trivial or commonplace matters are of interest and\nvalue.\n(1) My daughter had received as a birthday present from an\nannt during her absence from home a small old-fashioned brooch,\nunder the following circumstances : 2 she and a cousin had been\noffered by the aunt two little trinkets of her own, this brooch and\na ring, and the cousin, being the elder, had been given her choice.\nShe chose the ring on the ground that she already happened to\nown a brooch in other respects exactly like the brooch offered, but\nset with red stones instead of blue. I knew of the aunt's gift and of\nthe fact that the cousin had chosen the ring, but not of her motive\nfor so doing. I took the brooch to Mrs. Thompson about a\nfortnight after my daughter's return home.\nNelly (a) described the brooch without seeing it, and said (I)\nthat it had belonged to an old lady, and (c) that there was another\nsimilar brooch connected with it. It will be observed that (a) the\nappearance of the brooch was known to me, the sitter, that (b) the\nfact\u2014correctly stated\u2014of its former ownership was a reasonable\ninference for any one who, like me, had seen the brooch, but that (c)\nthe existence of a similar brooch was unknown to me, but known to\nat least three living persons. It was only when I restored the\nbrooch to my daughter and related what the sensitive had said that\nI heard about the existence of the similar brooch, which was in\ni The tenth case is too private to be related ; it ia briefly described on p. 196.\n2 See App. D, Sitting 4, pp. 234-7, for full accouut.\n\f178 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nfact an element of some importance in the story, as it determined\nmy daughter's ownership of this brooch.\n(2) I had shortly before Mrs. Thompson's visit to me in Decem\nber, 1899, marked in a shopman's catalogue a small pendant for\nwearing on a watch chain which I intended to give my daughter as\na Christmas present. I had not mentioned my intention to any one,\nand the catalogue had been put away with other papers where it\nwas not accessible. Nelly, in a talk alone with my daughter when\nI was out of the house, told her that some one called Margaret\u2014\nwhich is my name\u2014would give her a trinket to wear on her chain\nif she asked for it. When I found this statement in the record\nmade by my daughter of Nelly's sayings, I consulted my daughter\nand showed her the marked catalogue; but the present was not given,\nas I found she preferred something quite different.\nThe knowledge thus shown\u2014if it is not to be called a guess, and\nit should be noted that no other such guesses were made\u2014was\npossessed only by me, who was out of the house when the state\nment was made.\n(3) My daughter, who was away from home, had received among\nother presents at Christmas a book which I had not seen, though\nI had been told its title. I did not know that it was illustrated.\nNelly said to me on January 3, 1900, at Hampstead, in the presence\nof another sitter, who knew nothing of my daughter's presents,\nthat Helen had received a book for a Christmas present with a\npicture of a ship in it. This was, as I subsequently found, correct:\nthere are six pictures in the book, in one of which is a ship, and\nthis picture is reproduced on the cover.\nThe knowledge here shown\u2014if it is not reckoned as a guess, and\nit should be noted that no other statements were made by Nelly\nabout Christmas presents\u2014was not possessed by me, the sitter, but\nwas possessed by my daughter, by the giver of the book, and doubt\nless by other persons who had seen the book.\n(4) When I gave Mrs. Thompson the locket mentioned above\n(p. 173), I believed it to have belonged to my youngest sister, who\nhad died as a young child in 1866. There had been three exactly\nsimilar lockets, containing my grandmother's hair, given to myself\nand my two sisters, and after my little sister's death my mother\ncarried the locket on her watch chain. After my mother's death in\n1894, my sister, hearing that I had lost the hair out of my own\nlocket, gave me hers, keeping the one that had belonged to my\nlittle sister and my mother. But I had misunderstood her, and\n\fxr.iv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 179\nthought that it was this one that I had, and was taking to Mrs.\nThompson. After saying that the locket was not mine, Nelly gave\na short description of the lady to whom it had belonged, which\nwas wholly inapplicable to my mother, though appropriate to my\nsister. I had consequently reckoned this statement as incorrect, and\nit was only on mentioning the matter to my sister that I found\nthat I had been mistaken, and that Nelly's account of the previous\nownership of the locket was, as far as it went, more accurate than\nmy own.\nThe information shown on this occasion was thus not possessed\nby me, the only sitter, but was possessed, as far as I know, by\nonly one other person, my sister, who had never seen Mrs. Thompson,\nand was not aware that I was intending to take the locket to her.\n(5-9) The next five cases are closely connected, and the informa\ntion purports to have been communicated to the sensitive by a dead\nrelative of the sitter. The history of the way in which these statements\nwere obtained is worth noting ; it affords a curious illustration of what\nI have noticed more than once, namely, the apparent growth or\ndevelopment of information on the part of the trance personality,\nduring an interval between two sittings, where there has been no\npossibility that the sensitive should have become possessed of further\nknowledge by normal means, even if we suppose her willing to obtain\nsuch knowledge surreptitiously. At an interview at my house when\nMr. and Mrs. A. were present, and I was taking notes, Nelly made a\nrapid and confused statement, which seemed to Mr. A., sitting\nfor the first time with Mrs. Thompson, to be wholly unin\ntelligible. Mrs. A., who had been present at other sittings,\nthought that the remarks suggested confusion rather than mere\nimagination, but it was impossible to make anything of the\nstatements as given. Mrs. Thompson was told on coming out of the\ntrance that the sitting had not been successful, as there was a great\nconfusion of statements. The next day Mrs. Thompson informed\nme that she had had a vision or trance when she was alone,\nin which Mrs. Cartwright had appeared, and had said that Nelly\nhad made a great confusion between Mr. A.'s relatives, and that she\nshould herself have to come to set things straight. Later on, after\na long and very successful sitting under Nelly's auspices with another\nfriend of mine, Nelly was replaced by Mrs. Cartwright. At Mrs. Cart-\nwright's request, the notes of the previous sitting with Mr. and Mrs. A\nwere produced and read aloud, sentence by sentence, in the presence of\nMrs. A. but without Mr. A. At each pause Mrs. Cartwright stated\n\f180 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nwhether the remark was true or not, and to whom it referred, so that,\nin the end, out of an apparently hopeless tangle a definite series of\nstatements was obtained from the trance personality, some of them\nknown by Mrs. A. to be true, some of them entirely unfamiliar to\nher. These latter were six in number ; one of them appears to be\nwholly incorrect (App. B., No. 18) ; the other five are here related,\nNos. 5 to 9.i\n(5) It was stated that Mr. A. had a relative, an old lady, alive, a\n\"rare old lady for knitting\"; that this lady used to carry about with\nher around knitting-basket which contained her \"top-knot, an ornament\nfor her head, a cap you might call it, but it was a top-knot.\" Mrs. A.\nwas well acquainted with an old relative of Mr. A.'s, who was a great\nknitter, but had never seen her with a round knitting basket or any\ncap basket, and knew nothing of a \" top-knot.\" Mr. A. could throw\nno light on the statement. Mr. A.'s sisters, on hearing the above\naccount, said that the relative in question, having somewhat thin hair\nin middle life, before adopting the old lady's cap, with which Mrs. A.\nwas familiar, had worn a little knot of black lace on the top of her head\nwhich her young relatives called her top-knot, and which she used to\ntake about with her in a round knitting-basket.\n(6) It was stated that Mr. A.'s mother, now dead, \" was familiar with\nthe wife of a retired naval officer ; you could get information about\nthis.\" It was known to Mrs. A. as well as to Mr. A. that his mother\nhad few intimate or familiar friends, and of these there was only one,\nMrs. C., whose husband's occupation was unknown to Mrs. A., as the\nlady was a widow when Mrs. A. first heard of her. Mr. A. supplied\nthe information that the husband was called Captain C., but thought he\nhad been in the army. Mr. A.'s sisters, however, said that he had been\na captain in the navy, and had retired from the service before his\nmarriage. They further said that this lady, the widow of Captain\nC., was the only person outside her immediate family group who\nhad visited their mother during her last illness.\n(7) It was stated that Mr. A.'s mother used to wear a \"white\nShetland shawl,\" and that the shawl was still in existence in her\ni As Mr. and Mrs. A. do not wish their uame to be printed, I am unable to print\nthe record of this sitting in App. D. But I hare quoted the actual words of the\nsensitive throughout whenever it was possible. The information not already pos\nsessed by Mrs. A. was obtained by her from her sisters-in-law, the Miss A.'a,\nabout three weeks after the sitting, when she read to them my record of the\nstatements of the sensitive and the comments of Mr. and Mrs. A. The Miss A.'s\ndo not live in Cambridge, and had not heard of Mrs. Thompson till Mrs. A.\nshowed them the record.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 181\nhusband's house, \"still here, not in your house (to Mrs. A.), in the other\nhouse.\" Neither Mr. A. nor Mrs. A. had any recollection of such a\nshawl, and Mrs. A. was sure that she had never seen her mother-in-\nlaw wear a Shetland shawl. But the daughters said that their mother\nused to wear a white Shetland shawl as an evening wrap, in their early\nchildhood, before Mrs. A.'s acquaintance with her, and the shawl is\nstill in existence in the husband's house. After their mother's death\nthe shawl, which had special associations for her, had been kept by the\ndaughters. It may be said that it would be a safe guess to say that a\nlady of the age of the lady in question had worn a white Shetland\nshawl, but it would not be a very safe guess to go on to say that\nsuch a shawl was still in existence in its late owner's house.\n(8) It was stated that the same lady used to fasten the Shetland\nshawl with a brooch, and this brooch was described in detail. It was\nsaid to be about the length of a brooch held by Mrs. Thompson at the\nmoment, but not so high, \"more lengthwise, with open work of gold\nround it, and plaits of hair behind.\" Mrs. A. was further told \" to\nask the stouter lady \" about the brooch. Mrs. A. had no knowledge\nof any such brooch; two brooches were known to her, but neither of\nthem answered to the description. Mr. A. had no recollection of any\nof his mother's brooches. The daughters said at once that there was\na brooch corresponding to the description in all respects, except that\nthere was no hair at the back, the central stone being a topaz set\ntransparently. The brooch hud been worn by their mother during\ntheir early childhood, and by the elder daughter for a short time some\nthirty years ago. Mrs. A. asked what was to be made of the suggestion\nthat \" the stouter lady \" should be asked about the brooch, as by the\nstouter lady she had supposed the younger and less thin daughter was\nmeant, who, as so far appeared, had no connexion with it. She then\nfound that the brooch with other trinkets had actually been in the\ncharge of the younger daughter, and kept in a drawer in her room\never since their mother's death. Under these circumstances, Mrs. A.\nproceeded \"to ask the stouter lady\" for the brooch, and the brooch was\nfetched from the place where it had been kept undisturbed for six or\nseven years. It was found to have at the back a plait of two different\nkinds of hair, black and grey. The topaz, which looked transparent,\nwas, in fact, set upon a coloured foil, and the centre of the brooch was\nsolid.\n(9) It was stated that Mr. A.'s mother, being \"a clearing-up,\nmethodical lady,\" possessed a manuscript receipt book,i still in\ni \" She bad things put in a book of receipts.\"\n\f182 Mrs. A. W. VerraU. [PART\nexistence in her husband's house, and that in this book were\nreceipts other than cookery receipts, and in particular a receipt\nfor pomade, or, as the lady herself used to call it, \" pomatum.\" It\nwas known to Mrs. A. that her mother-in-law had possessed such a\nreceipt book as described, but nothing of its contents was known to\nher. The existence of the book was not known to Mr. A. The\ndaughters knew of the book, and said that pomatum was certainly the\nword used by their mother for the article in question, but they knew\nnothing of any receipt for pomade. The book was fetched ; it had\nbeen written in from both ends and was carefully indexed. No receipt\nfor pomade appeared in the index, but after the experience of the\nbrooch, sufficient confidence was felt in the accuracy of Mrs. Thompson's\ninformation to induce a search through the book. It was then found\nthat the last five receipts, counting from one end, had not been\nindexed, and that among these was a receipt for making Dr. Some\nbody's pomade. The book had never, so far as is known, left the\nhouse where its owner had lived, and Mrs. Thompson had certainly\nnever entered that house. The receipt was moreover in the middle\npart of the book, and, owing to its not having been indexed, was not\nvery easy to find, even for those who had leisure to search.\nWith regard to the possession by others than the sensitive of the\nknowledge of the facts in these five cases, it will be seen that they have\npoints of difference and points of resemblance. In all five cases the\ninformation (a) was certainly unknown to one sitter, Mrs. A. ;\n(b) was certainly not consciously possessed by the other sitter, Mr.\nA.; (c) certainly had been possessed by the dead lady from whom\nNelly represented herself as having obtained it. In cases 5 and 6\nit is probable that Mr. A. had at one time or other known the\nfacts about the top-knot and the profession of Captain C. ; it is\nalso likely that he had seen the white Shetland shawl (7), though\nhe certainly did not know that it was still in existence. In\ncase 8 it is very unlikely that, even if he had as a child seen the\nbrooch, he knew anything of the plaits of hair at the back, and\nhe certainly did not know that it was in the keeping of the younger\nsister. In the last case, 9, he was not aware of the existence of the\nreceipt book, and it may be taken as certain that he had never read it.\nThe greater part of the facts were known to some other living persons,\nas must always necessarily be the case if statements made by the\nsensitive and unknown to the sitter are to be capable of verification.\nThese living persons were unknown to Mrs. Thompson and were\nthemselves unaware that reference had been made to their family or\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 183\nfriends, so that their thoughts were not directed to reminiscences of\ndeceased relatives. Moreover, the whole of the facts were not known\nto these living and absent persons. The only person who knew all\nwas the dead lady herself. If such experiences as these were numerous,\nit would be difficult to avoid inferring that the source of information\nis to be found rather in the one consciousness that knew all the\nevents than in the scattered consciousnesses which can, after all,\nnot supply the whole. But more of such experiences would seem\nnecessary before we are warranted in constructing even a provisional\nhypothesis of this sort.\nMoreover, while the evidence from this group of cases (5 to 9) seems\nto point in the direction of communication from the dead as the\nsimplest explanation of the knowledge of the sensitive, it must be\nremembered that no such source seems indicated by the evidence in\nthe other group (1 to 4). There the facts, unknown to the sitter,\nwere in three cases known to another living person not then present,\nbut familiar with Mrs. Thompson, and interested in the sittings. In\nthe last case (4) the knowledge was possessed by a stranger to Mrs.\nThompson ; but in none of these cases is there any reason to suppose that\nany dead person knew the facts, or was interested in them, nor did Nelly\nclaim to have become possessed of the information through any other\nmeans than her own. In two of the cases the information concerned\nan article held by Mrs. Thompson at the moment, and in the other\ntwo, it concerned the doings of persons known to Nelly, who, it may\nbe said, claims to be able occasionally to visit people whom she knows.i\nThe only \"person\" then in these cases who could obtain the informa\ntion given, and supply the common element, is the trance personality\nwhich we call Nelly. Of the question of the independent existence\nand interdependence of the various trance personalities I do not\npropose to treat in this paper ; my present point is that the knowledge\nshown in cases 1 to 4, if it is to be regarded as something more than\naccidental, is not analogous to the knowledge shown in cases 5 to 9.\nIts explanation, be that what it may, clearly is to be found in the\npossession by Mrs. Thompson of some faculty other than that of\nobtaining information possessed by a deceased friend of the sitter.\ni For other instances of knowledge shown where Nelly claims to have visited the\nperson in question and \" seen \" what was being done, see p. 187 foll. But the\nanalogy is not complete, for in the cases there related, the facts, though not\nconsciously in the sitter's mind, were known to her, and therefore the hypothesis\nof telepathy from the sitter is not, as in the above cases 1-4, excluded.\n\f184 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nMETHODS OF COMMUNICATION.\nIt having, as I hope, been shown that some, at least, of the statements\nmade by Mrs. Thompson are such as cannot be due to random guessing\nor to information normally acquired, it will now not be out of place to say\nsomething about the methods by which the communications are made,\nand more particularly about the so-called personalities that are the main\nsource of information. The methods employed fall, as has been\nalready said (see p. 167), into two principal divisions according as the\nstatements made are, or are not, known consciously to the normal\npersonality of Mrs. Thompson. Some of the statements made to me\nhave taken the form of written messages sent to me by Mrs. Thompson,\nrecording things that she has heard or seen in a state of trance or\necstasy, and remembered on waking ; but by far the greater number\nhave been uttered through the lips of Mrs. Thompson\u2014or, on some very\nlew occasions, written by her hand\u2014while she was entranced. There\nhas been very little writing within my observation ; what has been so\nwritten has, with one possible exception, been in the sensitive's own\nhandwriting. The trance utterances purport to come from some spirit\nof the dead, who has for the time taken possession of the medium's\nperson. I have, as I have said, received communications from three\nsuch personalities, Nelly, Mrs. Cartwright, and a personal friend whom\nI have called Mrs. B. The characteristics of the respective personalities\nare not very marked ; all bear strong resemblances to that of Mrs.\nThompson herself. The actual voice is hardly to be distinguished\nfrom hers, the words and phrases, so far as they are in any way\ndistinctive, are such as she herself uses in the normal state; in fact,\nregarded as a piece of dramatisation, the performance is not striking.\nBut, in spite of the absence of distinct traits, there is a marked indi\nviduality about each of the three personalities which makes it impossible\nto confuse them with one another or with Mrs. Thompson. It is no\nmore possible to mistake Nelly for Mrs. Thompson, or Mrs. Cartwright\nfor either, than it is to mistake one living person for another. The\nfirst words of Mrs. Cartwright or Nelly, though preceded by no change\nin Mrs. Thompson's manner, attitude, or gestures, show instantly\nand unmistakeably who claims to be communicating with the sitter.\nThe characteristics of Nelly are much more vivid to me than are those\nof Mrs. Cartwright, but in both cases the general effect on the sitter is\nmuch what would be produced were they in effect what they purport\nto be, in the one case a child of Mrs. Thompson's, in the other a former\nschoolmistress. In this respect, in my experience, they differ greatly\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 185\nfrom the so-called Dr. Phinuit, the sole control of Mrs. Piper when I\nsat with her. Although the change of voice and manner from Mrs.\nPiper to Dr. Phinuit was very much more marked than is the change\nfrom Mrs. Thompson to Nelly, Dr. Phinuit did not produce on me the\nimpression of an actual independent being with whom it was possible\nto enter into normal relations. The two personalities of Nelly and\nMrs. Cartwright, on the contrary, make the same impression as would\ntwo actual human beings with whom one had a normal acquaintance ;\nyou may like one better than the other, you may know one better\nthan the other, you may recognise their merits and their limitations,\nbut it never occurs to you to doubt their independent existence.\nThe third personality, Mrs. B., cannot be classed with the other\ntwo, as it differs from them in some important respects. Like them,\nit is not to be confused with Mrs. Thompson herself, but, unlike\nthem, it presents so far no unity, no such characteristics as go to the\nmaking of an individual. Not only does it not bear the remotest\nlikeness to the person it claims to be, but it has at present no\nindividuality at all. It is something which is not Mrs. Thompson,\nwhich is neither Nelly nor Mrs. Cartwright, which is vague, colour\nless, undefined, speaking with difficulty and hesitation, hardly aware\nof its surroundings, unable to answer directly the questions of the\nsitter, sometimes apparently unconscious of the presence of one of\nthe sitters, absorbed in the thought of the difficulties and strangeness\nof the occupation in which it is engaged. Very definite statements,\nquite impossible to obtain by any recognised normal means, have\nbeen made to me and in my presence about Mrs. B., but they have\nbeen made by Nelly, usually after the departure of the personality of\nMrs. B. herself. This personality has now appeared to me four\ntimes, and each time it has made great advances as regards coherence\nand power of expression. It is possible that with time some char\nacteristics of the lady herself might appear; the name has been given,\nthe personality is asserted by Nelly to be that of Mrs. B., and its own\nstatements are throughout consistent with the supposed personality ;\nwhat is at present lacking is just that touch of individuality which\nis the distinguishing mark of Nelly and Mrs. Cartwright. The\nstudy of the development of a new personality, whatever be the\nexplanation of such personalities in the case of Mrs. Thompson, is\nby no means the least interesting of the problems presented, but the\nmaterial is not yet sufficient to enable me to do more than state the\nelements of the problem, and leave its solution for the future.\nThe question of the relations of the two leading personalities,\n\f186 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PABT\nNelly and Mrs. Cartwright, to each other and to Mrs. Thompson\nis a very complicated one ; so far as my ovvji observation goes, I\nhave not been able to separate into groups the facts known to Mrs.\nCartwright and those known to Nelly. As both these personalities\nclaim\u2014and seem\u2014to possess the power of learning facts by super\nnormal means, this is not remarkable; where there is a possibility of\nthe telepathic transference of knowledge in the sitter's mind (to take one\nprobable source of information) to the communicating personality, it\nwould be unreasonable to expect that the range of knowledge possessed\nby the two personalities should be widely different. Moreover, the\ntwo personalities claim to be in constant communication with one\nanother, and Nelly sometimes quotes Mrs. Cartwright as the authority\nfor a statement made by herself, so that I have found it quite\nimpossible to distinguish between the things known to these two\ncontrols. But there is no difficulty in drawing such a distinction\nbetween the knowledge of these personalities on the one hand and\nthat of Mrs. Thompson herself on the other. I do not mean that\nnothing is possessed in common by Mrs. Thompson and the trance\npersonalities ; on the contrary, I am convinced that occasionally facts\nthat have been learnt by Mrs. Thompson in an ordinary way are\nreproduced by the trance personality, often with correct additions\nnot known to Mrs. Thompson, sometimes with slight errors or con\nfusion of detail. A clear illustration of this was obtained at one of\nmy more recent sittings, the statements in which do not enter into\nthe statistics quoted at the beginning of this paper.\nOn September 14th, 1900, during an unusually long wait before\nthe entrancement of Mrs. Thompson, in the presence of the other\nsitter, Miss Harrison, I told Mrs. Thompson in the course of\nconversation the following facts :\n(1) That during our summer holiday, my daughter had had an attack\nof chicken-pox, and that she and I had in consequence moved from\nour hotel at Baden to a pension i at Zurich, where we had been shut\nup in absolute seclusion for sixteen days in two rooms, with very little\nto do, and that we had occupied our leisure in trying the time-\nhonoured means of divination by means of the \" Bible and the key,\"\nonly that the Bible had been replaced in our case by a paper novel.\n(2) That once some years ago I had tried Planchette with a\nfriend, and that we had written correctly the Christian name,\nElizabeth, unknown to both of us, of a lady who was coming to\ndinner; that subsequently, with a view to discovering which of the\ni The pension was a new one ; I did not mention its name to Mrs. Thompson.\n\fxnv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 187\ntwo manipulators contributed the more largely to the result, we\nhad each read different books while sitting with our hands on the\nplanchette, and that the words written under those circumstances\nby our two hands were the French words under my eye.\n(3) That I had had great difficulty in inducing a very stupid\npostmistress in a small village in the Grisons to despatch a paper\non Mrs. Thompson's trance phenomena which was to be read at the\nParis Congress ; that the woman would recognise no classification\noutside letters but \" samples \" or \" printed matter,\" and that when I\nfinally induced her to send the MS. by parcel post, she could tell me\nnothing of the probable date of delivery of my parcel, had never\nheard of Paris, and only knew of France that it was \"very far\naway.\"\nI transcribe from my notes of a later sitting (Dec. 14, 1900)\nremarks of Nelly's which seem to me to refer to the above facts ;\nthe reader will note that there are one or two slight errors, such\nas would be likely to occur if any one were relating after some weeks\na story that had been once heard. But what is much more remark\nable than these errors is the addition by Nelly of several details\nto the stories\u2014details which she had certainly not learnt from\nme, which in some cases had been mentioned by me to no one, but\nwhich were correct. I give the account of the sitting as recorded\nby me at the time:\nXotes of a sitting at 19 Buckingham Street on December 14<A, 1900\u2014\nPresent, Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Verrall.\nXeUy. \" Helen had pimples and sat in a dark room ; I saw her there.\"\nMrs. V. \"Can you tell me about it?\"\nA'elly. \"You had a pink blouse and you read to Helen when you had\nit on. There were stairs outside the house when Helen had the pimples. I\nwatched you going to the Post Office ; what a silly old woman ! Shall\nI tell you a story?\"\nMrs. V. \"Yes.\"\"\nSelly. \"Once upon a time Mrs. Verrall was in Switzerland and she\nwauted to send a round Christmas box. The old woman said, 'I don't\nknow where Paris is, but it is a long way off.' She would not understand\nwhether the parcel would get before the birthday. You know Professor\nRichet, who sent ' mother the book with the pretty pictures in it ? \"\nMri. V. \"Yes, I know him.\"\ni Mrs. Thompson tells me that Nelly's statement that M.

[PART\nNelly. \"It was Professor Richet who wanted it to read.\"\nMrs. V. \" Can you see what the old woman wore ? \"\nNelly. \"She had a thing round her head, like a poker thing sticking\nup.

There was not a comfort\nable chair in the room where you sat and read ; I can see you sitting\nlike this.\"\nHere Mrs. Thompson imitated a person trying in vain to sit comfortably\non an upright chair.\nNelly. \"Helen's eyes were bad and you read to her.

She went on :\nKelly. \" I have seen you trying with letters not in Switzerland. I\nkuew you before mother knew you. I have always known the people\nwho were interested in these things.

V. \"Who else was there?\"\nNetty. \"No, I could not see.\"\nIt will be instructive to take in detail the three points on which\nI had spoken to Mrs. Thompson two months before these remarks\nwere made by Nelly, and see what errors and what additions were\nmade in the reproduction of them.\n(1) The chicken-pox of my daughter appears, the fact of our\nbeing shut up together and my reading to her (a likely guess),\nand the divination with the book and the key. But the book has\nbecome a Bible, which I distinctly said it was not. The additions\nwere as follows :\n(a) That I had a pink blouse, and read to Helen when I had it\non. I had a pink blouse, but did not wear it in Helen's room ; I\nhad two completely different dresses, worn one in the sick room and\none in my own room, and the pink blouse belonged to my room ;\n(b) That there were stairs outside the house ; later these are\ndescribed as steps up which the milk woman used to go. The\nstreet outside our house, on to which the window of Helen's room\nlooked, terminated immediately beyond our front door in a great\n\f190 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nflight of some sixty stone steps, of the breadth of the carriage road,\nwhich did not extend beyond our house, and all the passers-by went\nup and down these steps ;\n(c) That when I opened the window I had to stick in a pot hook,\nthat the pot hook was troublesome, and that the reason was that\nthe hole was full of rust, and made my finger dirty. The outside\nshutters in Helen's room fastened to the wooden upright which made\nthe centre of the window frame by two pot hooks fitting into iron\nrings on the window frame. I was not able to push one of the hooks\ninto its hole for the first few days and made temporary arrange\nments, but after a great storm of wind had destroyed my substitute,\nI had to investigate the cause of the obstruction, and found that\nthe ring was choked up with rust. In clearing it, I tore the skin of\nmy finger, and had to wash my hands with some care to get out\nthe rust which had got into the wound;\n(d) That there was a curtain, which I screwed up and folded, so\nthat I could read. There was no difficulty with the curtains in\nHelen's room, but each evening, before sitting down in my own room\nto read, I used to fold the curtain back by gathering it into my hand\nand tucking it behind the peg at the side ;\n(e) That there were curtains to the window and the bed. This\nwas the case in Helen's room ; it is, of course, very unusual to have\ncurtains to the bed in a Swiss room, but in this case the curtains had\nbeen put as a protection to the eyes of the patient, and any one\nacquainted with the circumstances might probably have guessed that\nthere would be curtains to the bed ;\n(\/) That there was not a comfortable chair in the room where I\nsat and read. This was true, there were only two hard, narrow up\nright chairs, extremely uncomfortable, and I often had to give up\nreading to Helen and go to rest in my own room after making many\nefforts by a change of position to make myself comfortable ;\n(g) That the house top was squarified, like the top of the house in\nthe willow-pattern plates, or a dinner napkin folded into four. This\nis true ; the house, unlike the majority of Zurich houses, stood in its\nown grounds ; it was a square house, and on the top of the roof was\na flat space, considerably smaller than the area enclosed by the house\nwalls, so that the angles of the lines of the roof ran inwards to a\ncentral platform very much as they do in a willow-pattern plate ;\n(A) That it was a rickety place. This was not true ; the window\nshutters, etc., were particularly well made, and the iron and wood\nwork good;\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 191\n(\u00bb') That a person in a cap, carrying milk, used to go up the outside\nsteps. This is not true ; plenty of women in short round skirts went\nup and down the steps, but I have no recollection of any milk carrier,\nnor do the women of Zurich wear caps ;\n(j) That there were stuffed birds in the room on the left side in\nthis house. This is not true ; the room on the left was a tiny office\ncontaining little furniture. At the next place, to which we went from\nZurich, where my husband, usually called by Nelly \"Mr. Willgar,\"\njoined us, there was the largest collection of stuffed birds I ever\nsaw in one room, but the room was not on the left-hand side of\nanything. In this same hotel of the stuffed birds there was a shocking\nlavatory, the only bad one we found in our three months' absence.\nIs it possible that by this time Nelly had passed on to the next\nplace ? It will be seen that she put my husband with us, and seemed\npuzzled how to fit things in.\n(2) The old story of my attempts with Planchette appears with the\nmistake of Eliza as the name written instead of Elizabeth, with the\nreference to the language, French, reproduced by the instrument, and\nwith the unlikely addition that Nelly was present on the occasion.\nIt will be noticed that Nelly was not able to say anything of the\nfriend who joined me in making Planchette write.\n(3) The story of my difficulty with the postmistress appears ; the\nfact that I had a parcel to send to Paris, and the impossibility of\ngetting from the woman any account of the time when it would be\ndelivered. It is an error to imply that the language was French : it\nwas German ; that the parcel was round : it was flat ; and that it was\ngoing to Professor Richet : I sent the MS. to Dr. Janet, who was to\ngive it to Mr. Myers to read ; as a fact it was not read, but an\naccount of its contents was given at the Congress in Mrs. Thompson's\npresence by Professor Richet. The following additions to this account\nwere made by Nelly :\n(a) That the woman had a thing round her head, like a poker thing\nsticking up : that she had a flat look at the back of her head, and\nthat the thing was all put on in a piece ; perhaps she slept in it.\nThe description is not very definite, and it is difficult to say how\nfar it really represents what as a fact the woman wore, but part of\nit does represent my impression at the time. The postmistress wore\na stiff black lace erection which stood out round her head, and which\nfrom a front view I had taken to be the frill of a cap. I distinctly\nremember the surprise with which I discovered when she turned\nround, that, instead of there being a knot of hair at the back, what I\n\f192 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nhad taken for the frill of a cap was the edge of a sort of plate, clapped\non at the back of the head like a halo, with no knob of hair beyond\nit, as I had expected to see. The erection was flush with the\nactual back of the head, so that it almost seemed to be part of the\nhead itself, and the question instantly rose in my mind as to what\nshe could look like without it;\n(b) That on my way to the Post Office I seemed to pass a\nverandah not belonging to the Post. This is true ; on my first visit\nto the Post to send off my paper to Paris I missed the regular\nentrance and went on to what I thought was the house to which I\nhad been directed. The people there told me that I had passed the\nPost, but could go back to it through a verandah which belonged to\nthem ; this I accordingly did.\nI have dwelt at great length on these trivialities because the\nobservations of Nelly seem to me to be worth studying in detail. I have\nno doubt that much of what she said in December was directly derived\nfrom what I had said in September to Mrs. Thompson : but it is\ninteresting to note that, whether or not we are to allow Nelly's\nclaim to have \"seen\" the additions, it seems clear that the personality\nthat calls itself Nelly has the power of learning facts about the\nsitter that have not been communicated nor directly asked for ; it\nwould almost seem as if Nelly's knowledge were just that of a person\nwho could see a little better than the rest of us, who had the\nfaculty of going just outside the normal bounds of knowledge, when\nher attention had been directed to a particular point. This, if true,\nis very interesting to those, who, like myself, have made experiments\nin thought transference, or \" clairvoyance,\" because in success in such\ncases the sensation to the guesser is exactly that of having on this\noccasion seen or heard a little better than usual. I refer of course\nto cases where it is not possible that the real explanation of the\nsuccess is to be found in hyperaesthesia.i\nTo return to the point whence I started, it is clear that the trance\npersonality does occasionally show knowledge of what is known to\nMrs. Thompson ; in some cases no reference is made in the trance\nto the normally acquired knowledge of Mrs. Thompson, but it often\nhappens that the trance personality quotes Mrs. Thompson as the\nsource of knowledge, for it claims the power of \"reading Mrs.\nThompson's mind.\"\nBut so far as long and careful observation enables me to judge,\ni See article on \"Some Experiments on the Supernormal Acquisition of\nKnowledge\" in Proceedings S.P.R., vol. XL, p. 174.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 193\nthe converse of this proposition is not true ; never once have I\nfound Mrs. Thompson in her normal state show possession of know\nledge familiar to the trance personality. I have constantly tested\nthis matter ; I have spoken to Mrs. Thompson as if she knew some\nthing that I had discussed with Nelly, but I have never found in\nher any trace of such knowledge. If by accident or on purpose I\nhave addressed the trance personality as though it were identical\nwith Mrs. Thompson, I have invariably been corrected ; in fact there\ncan be no doubt to any one who has had frequent opportunities of\nobservation that the separation between Mrs. Thompson and the\ntrance personality is a very real thing to them both and goes very\ndeep. For the purposes of the statistics at the beginning of this\npaper it has of course been assumed that all information given through\nthe ordinary channels to Mrs. Thompson or any of the trance per\nsonalities is information normally obtained ; but as a matter of fact\nit is my belief that abnormal or supernormal means of information,\nsuch as telepathy, clairvoyance, or other faculties, are quite as readily\nemployed by the trance personalities as the more normal methods.\nFAILURES, OMISSIONS, ETC.\nSo far I have written only of the positive side of the communi\ncations through Mrs. Thompson, but no account of the phenomena\nwould be complete without some comment on what may be called\nthe negative side,\u2014 the failures, the omissions, the apparent un\nimportance of the facts told, the lapses, the errors, the want\nof continuity and occasional incoherence of the narrative. The full\nlist of errors in my earlier interviews, as far as I know them, is given\nin Appendix A. Probably to this list should be added some of the state\nments about persons long dead, or otherwise unverified, but the total\nnumber of actual misstatements is not in any case large (see p. 170).\nThe omissions and the incompleteness of statement are much more\nremarkable, and the apparent failure of Nelly to draw obvious\ninferences is one of the most marked and interesting features\nwithin my experience. In illustration of this the reader will\nobserve that I was given many characteristic details descriptive\nof my mother-in-law,i who was said to be easier to get at through\nmy child than through myself, and yet Nelly was obviously under\nthe impression that the person described was my own mother. She\nnever used any expression which definitely committed her to that\nview, but was constantly apologising for \"Mrs. Willgar's\" greater\ni See App. D, Sitting 3, p. 228.\n\f194 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\ninterest in my absent husband and child than in myself, the sitter,\na fact of which the interpretation would have been obvious enough\nto any one who had realised the situation. Again, Nelly is often\npuzzled by such a common thing as the difference in name between\nmother and daughter when, as constantly happens, the name\nthat she gets at is the mother's maiden name or the daughters\nmarried name. She has several times said in speaking of my\nhusband, whose two baptismal names, Arthur Woollgar, she hit\nupon almost correctly at a very early stage of my acquaintance\nwith her, that she could not see that he was married, but he\nhad a Margaret (my own name) and a Helen (our only child's name)\nbelonging to him. Since Mrs. Thompson in the normal state, as\nwell as Nelly, knows my name and my daughter's, the inference is\nobvious, but it has not been made. It was only some months after\nmy acquaintance with Mrs. Thompson and during a visit in my\nhouse that Nelly said that \" the Willgar gentleman \" whom she had\npreviously described lived in the house, and was the person whom\nMrs. Thompson called Dr. Verrall. As Nelly herself calls me Mrs.\nVerrall, the inference again seems obvious, but again it has not been\nmade. She talks to me freely of \"the Willgar gentleman,\" or of\n\"Arthur,\" and she recognises that he belongs to me, but she has\nnever referred to him as my husband,i and continues occasionally to\nexpress a gentle wonder why he so often comes into her thoughts\nof my daughter Helen and me. To maintain this little device\ndeliberately would seem to be playing not only a purposeless but an\nunnecessarily complicated game : it is only one of many similar\ninstances where we can see no satisfactory explanation of the motives\nof the trance personality and must be content to register the facts.\nIt occasionally happens that the information given to a complete\nstranger is accurate and detailed, as I have myself seen, but more\noften in my experience does the knowledge of a person's surround\nings gradually develop and define itself, so that Nelly's statements\nbecome more precise. If the increased knowledge thus shown were\nsuch as could be obtained by enquiry or other normal means, this\nincrease of precision on acquaintance would be a very suspicions\ncircumstance. But in the cases under my observation the facts\nstated have often been such as could not be ascertained.2 The case\n'In some of the later sittings Nelly has spoken of \"your husband,\" but has\nnever said that he is identical with \" the Willgar gentleman.\"\naSee the account on p. 179 of the defining by Mrs. Cartwright of the confused\nstatements made on the previous day by Nelly.\n\fxuv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 195\nof Theodore and the slippers, already quoted (see pp. 176, 227), is an\ninstance of increased knowledge on the part of the trance personality\nwhere it was impossible that the medium could have learnt any further\nfacts. At the second sitting, when I asked about the matter, Nelly\nadded to her original statement the further facts that the slippers\nwere worked by me, that they were on canvas, that I had put in\nthe background, and that I had had much trouble over them. All\nthese things were in complete agreement with my own recollections,\nstrengthened by the memories of my father and sister, with whom I\ntalked the matter over in April, 1899, at Brighton shortly after my\nfirst meeting with Mrs. Thompson. In the interval between April\nand July, 1899, no communication whatever took place between Mrs.\nThompson and myself, and there never has been any communication\nbetween her and my family. I had not spoken on the subject to\nany one else, so that there was no other source whence she could\npossibly have derived information in any normal way. This is by no\nmeans an isolated case. It should be noted that the additional\ndetails given at the second sitting were known to the living, includ\ning the sitter, and certainly not to the dead, the limit of whose\nknowledge on the matter was probably reached in the statements of\nthe sensitive at the first sitting. In this and similar cases I am\ntherefore disposed to attribute the increase of knowledge on the part\nof the sensitive either to the increased attention, conscious or un\nconscious, given by the sitter after the subject has been introduced\nat a sitting\u2014that is, to telepathy in some form\u2014or to an increase\nin the power of the \"control,\" which comes with familiarity, why\nor how it is not yet possible to say.\nIllustrations of increased knowledge of an ascertainable kind will\nbe given later, when I come to treat of \"suspicious circumstances\"\nattending these phenomena, and I pass on to other points of interest\nof what I have called a negative sort. The incoherence of the\nstatements made is sometimes very great; not only are the remarks\nthemselves often fragmentary and hardly intelligible, but they are\noccasionally interpolated into the midst of irrelevant matter. When\nthe person or circumstance thus introduced is distinctive there is no\ndifficulty in assigning the remark to its proper place ; but I have\nno doubt that a certain number of statements classed as incorrect or\nunverifiable are as a fact statements wholly irrelevant to their con\ntext and belonging to some other series of communications. This\nincoherence is more apt to occur in a bad sitting than in a good one;\nbut it is to be remembered that occasionally statements remarkably\n\f196 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nclear and correct are made during what is otherwise an unrepaying\nsitting. Indeed, one of the most interesting things i that occurred within\nmy observation was let fall without any emphasis, and conveyed\nno impression of its importance to me at the time\u2014another\nillustration, if illustration were needed, of the importance of recording\neverything that is said during a sitting, even when the statement\nappears wholly unintelligible.\nThe omissions on the part of the communicating personality are\nno less remarkable than the statements; but classification is here\nimpossible and comment difficult. They may be roughly divided\nunder two heads, according as the gaps represent facts or the con\nnexion between facts. Under this second head comes the failure,\nalready mentioned, to draw an obvious inference ; under the\nformer, the constant overlooking by the sensitive of things that\nseem to the sitter important, and that are at least as easy to ascer\ntain by normal means as other facts given. For instance, the family\nof my husband consists of his father, two brothers, and two sisters.\nThe two sisters, the father and one brother have been often spoken\nof; the profession of the father and brother has been correctly given,\nand some characteristic details concerning them, but no mention has\nbeen made of the other brother, though he is living in the same\ntown as the rest of the family, and is quite as intimate with us as\nany of the others. A direct enquiry on the subject produced the\nanswer that Nelly could only see one brother, and at no subsequent\nsitting has any reference been made to this second brother.'2 Instances\nof similar omissions could be multiplied ; but the enumeration of them\nwould do no more than prove, as does the extreme triviality of many\nof the statements made, that whatever is the cause that determines\nthe selection of incidents, it is not the expectation or desire of the\nsitter.\nThe triviality of the incidents mentioned has received such frequent\nillustration throughout this paper that nothing further need be said\non the subject. I think that my experience is perhaps exceptional in\nthis respect, in that I have not myself received any communications\ni This is the case 1U in the list of statements unknown to the sitter, which ia of\ntoo private a nature to be related (see p. 177).\n* The fact that my husband has two brothers and two sisters appears in the\nreport of my sittings with Mrs. Piper, and the name of the second brother is there\ngiven. This is not the only case where Mrs. Thompson has showed ignorance of\nfacts easily ascertainable by any one to whom my family circumstances were of any\ninterest.\n\fxi,iv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 197\npurporting to come from intimate friends whom I have lost, and\ntherefore a much greater number of the statements made to me are\ndue to the observations of Nelly than is the case with those who are\nsupposed to be in direct communication with close friends of their\nown. At the same time, I have had opportunities as note-taker\nof witnessing what occurs in the case of others, and there is no\ndoubt that the matters of deep import touched on by the sensitive\nare few and far between. Some there have been : allusions to deeply-\nrooted feelings, and to profound convictions of the dead, unmistake-\nable, and, at least at the moment, convincing to the sitter. It is true\nthat these references to the deeper and personal emotions are unlikely\nto be of great evidential value; it is true also that there seems to\nbe a desire and an effort of the trance personality to respond to the\ndemands of the sitter, be those demands uttered or unacknowledged ;\nand it should be said that what I have looked for first and above\nall else throughout my sittings has been evidence of supernormal\nfaculty. This I believe that I have had, and mainly through the\nvery details whose triviality I am discussing. \/\/ If it be true, as I\nsuspect, that on what the sitter brings largely depends what the\nsitter gets, others will probably have had a larger share than I in\nthe deeper and more stirring allusions to the past and the dead.\nASCKRTAINABLE FACTS AND SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.\nAny attempt to enable those interested in the subject to form a\njudgment as to the value of the trance phenomena of Mrs. Thompson\nwould be incomplete without a notice of what may be called the\n\" suspicious circumstances \" connected with those phenomena : in\nother words, the occurrences which suggest that normal means of\ninformation play their part in producing successful results. I have\nsaid already that I think it probable that the sources of knowledge\nof the sensitive are various, and I think it would be unreasonable to\nsuppose that among these sources should not be reckoned Mrs.\nThompson's own knowledge or guesses of the circumstances of her\nsitters. fl\\ might go further and say that it is possible that during\nthe trance or the transition from trance to a normal condition she\nmay have some faculty resembling the sharpened sense perceptions of\na hypnotic subject, and so be able to read or recognise by the touch\nthings that would be outside her ordinary range.'' Recurrent successes\ncapable of such explanation would diminish the value of her success,\neven where the circumstances seemed unfavourable to any but super\nnormal methods of obtaining knowledge, as a considerable margin\n\f198 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. \u2022 [PART\nmust in any case be allowed for mal-observation or error on the\npart of the observer. Such successes, therefore, might fairly be said\nto be \" suspicious, \" and in forming a general estimate of the value\nof the phenomena, it seems of the utmost importance to see what\nproportion of success is obtained under circumstances favouring the\nsuggestion that normal means of information have been illegitimately\nemployed.\nIt will here be necessary to revert to a group of statements that\nhas been mentioned already in this paper (p. 172), but not described or\nanalysed, namely, the statements which were correct but were ascertain-\nable by normal means, for it is by an examination of these that we are\nlikely to find evidence, if anywhere, that recourse has been had to\nnormal means of investigation. In this class I have included all such\nstatements about the sitter as might be supposed obtainable by a\nperson desirous of obtaining them, and so I have here included names\nand details concerning sitters supposed to be unknown to the sensitive,\nif given at any but the first interview. The total number of such\nstatements made to me during the period to which I have applied the\ntest of statistics is 51 ; they may be subdivided into the following\nclasses :\n(a) Names connected with sitters whose identity is known\nto the sensitive, - - ... 14\n(b) Facts contained in letters given to the sensitive, - 7\n((.\u2022) Facts in the history of the sitter or of a close connexion\nof the sitter, - - - 23\n(d) Facts probably known to Mrs. Thompson, - 3\n(e) Facts that might have been guessed, ... - 4\nTotal, 51\nI propose to treat of each of these heads in some detail, that the\nreader may be able to judge how far the information given seems to\nthrow suspicion upon Mrs. Thompson's general methods. I take the\nclasses above enumerated in inverse order :\nClass (\u00ab).\u2014The four following statements have been classed as things\nthat might have been accidentally guessed, or as \" lucky shots.\"\n(1) A sitter, Miss E. (let us say), was told that a person of her\nname, E., was recently dead ; the sitter's name had not been given to\nMrs. Thompson, but this statement was made pretty late in the sitting\nafter letters bearing the lady's name upon them had been handed to the\nsensitive. The fact was correct, but no further information was given\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 199\nabout the recently deceased Mr. E., about whom indeed the sitter her\nself knew very little.\n(2) The same sitter was told that her mother was dead ; but this\nwould be a safe conjecture to make in the case of the majority of sitters\nof the lady's age. Some interesting and correct information about the\nmother followed upon this statement, but it is not necessary to attribute\nthe opening remark that she was dead to supernormal information.\n(3) The same sitter was said to have spent her summer holiday in\nthe company of a dead friend of hers, about whom a great deal of\ninteresting information had previously been given by the trance-\npersonality. The sitter had more than once spent her summer holiday,\nor part of it, with the lady in question ; but in view of the fact, which\nhad appeared clearly in the course of the sittings, of the great intimacy\nbetween the ladies, this suggestion is well within the range of likely\nguesses.\n. (4) It was said that a hair cross given to the sensitive had been kept\nin a wooden box. This was the case ; but the box was a Japanese one,\nand the wood has a peculiar odour, communicable in some instances to\nits contents, though not detectably communicated to the cross. But in\nany case such a statement would have a very good chance of being\ncorrect.\nClass (d).\u2014These four cases may be dismissed as having no light\nto throw on the subject of our enquiry, and we may go on to the\nclass (d), of \"Facts that were probably known to the sensitive.\"\nThese are three in number :\n(1) A letter (see App. D, p. 238) that had been given to the sensitive\nto read was at a subsequent sitting said to have been kept in three\nplaces: (1) a left-hand drawer; (2) the cupboard of a writing-table,\na cupboard which was fastened by turning a key ; and (3) an\nold-fashioned writing-desk. These three places had in fact served\nto keep the letter in question, and they were the only places\nthat had been used for more than temporary purposes in the\nknowledge of the owner. It was impossible that the sensitive should\nhave any normal knowledge on the subject of the first and last\nmentioned ; but it was from out of the locked cupboard of the writing-\ntable in my drawing-room, where Mrs. Thompson had sat during her\nstay in my house, that I took the letter, in her presence, for the trance-\npersonality to read.\n(2) and (3) Two statements were made to my daughter in a very\nshort sitting during Mrs. Thompson's visit to us, in December, 1899,\nabout a neighbour's child, a friend of my daughter's, namely, that she\n\f200 Mrs. A. W. Verratt. [PART\nhad recently broken her leg, and that after the accident she had gone\nabroad. The accident had occurred a few days before Mrs. Thompson's\nvisit to Cambridge in July, 1899, and during that visit my daughter\nhad often seen her. My daughter used to visit the child whose leg\nhad been broken, and it was a frequent subject of speculation with us\nall whether the leg would be well in time for the child to go abroad\nwith the rest of her family. I have no proof that the subject was\nspoken of before Mrs. Thompson, but under the circumstances I should\nthink it very improbable that it was not. I am disposed to regard her\nmention of the incident, five months later, as an instance of deferred\nmemory, like those related on pages 187 foil.\nThe reader must judge whether any of these pieces of information\nseem to suggest that the sensitive was making good use of knowledge\nconsciously possessed by her; my own impression is that these were\ngenuine recollections of what the sensitive knew by normal means,\ninterpolated among other matter that she did not and could not\npossibly have so known. It is noticeable that the description of the\nlocked cupboard as the keeping-place for the letter was wedged in\nbetween the mention of two other places of which the sensitive had\ncertainly no knowledge ; it was not likely that her mention of it would\nbe impressive, for even a forgetful sitter would be likely to remember\nthe circumstances immediately preceding the production of a test letter,\nand, ex hypolhesi, unless the sitter did remember that the letter had\nbeen in this cupboard, the mention of the fact by the trance personality\nwould not help to create an impression of the accuracy of the sensi\ntive's remarks. It seems to me much more probable that these three\nfacts about where the letter had been were known to the sensitive, and\n.that the difference between them is that in the one case the sitter knew\nhow the sensitive was possessed of that knowledge, whereas in the\nother cases she did not. The two allusions to the accident to my\n\u2022daughter's friend would have been impressive had we forgotten that\nMrs. Thompson had had opportunities of learning the facts in the\n\u2022ordinary way, and perhaps some readers will believe that the trance-\npersonality took the risk of our having so forgotten. But the case is\nclosely parallel with the one related at length earlier in this paper, and\nit is impossible for me to believe in that case that Mrs. Thompson, after\n.our long acquaintanceship, thought so meanly of my memory or my\n\u2022common-sense as to suppose that I should be impressed by the not\nwholly accurate reproduction of what I had myself told her in the\npresence of a witness two months before.\nClass (c).\u2014The largest division is (c), facts in the history of a sitter\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 201\nor of a close connexion of a sitter, mentioned after identification of the\nperson described. There are 23 of these. Two of the statements refer\nto an incident which has been referred to in this paper, but not related\nin detail; Nelly had at a first interview with a sitter unknown to Mrs.\nThompson made some remarkable and true statements about a friend\nof that sitter recently dead, whom I have called Mrs. B., but she had\nimplied, though she had not actually said, that Mrs. B. was the sitter's\nsister, and that Mr. B. was still alive. At a later sitting when\nfurther details were given about Mrs. B., the trance personality cor\nrected these two errors. These two corrections therefore have been\ncounted as true, but as capable of normal acquisition, for there had\nbeen intervals between the sittings during which, if Mrs. Thompson\nhad identified the lady called Mrs. B., and had made enquiries about\nher, she could have ascertained both the above facts ; whether the\ncorrection was due to knowledge so obtained, or to telepathy from the\nsitter, or to some other cause, I have no means of determining.\nThree of the statements in this class refer to a particular sitter, who\nat the time they were made had been identified by Mrs. Thompson and\nwas known to her. Nelly spoke of Miss Jane Harrison in her presence\nto me as being connected with \" monuments,\" and as associated with\nthe British Museum and the Museum at Kensington ; it was further\nstated what her age would be at her next birthday. This also was\nknown to me after consideration, but not at the moment. These\nthree facts are all easily ascertainable, and have no evidential or\nother value.\nFour of the statements in this class refer to my own concerns ; Nelly\nsaid that a piece of hair which I gave her when she was in my house\nwas the hair of a very delicate baby, so delicate that it \"makes\nmother's hand cold \" ; Mrs. Thompson's hand, which she gave to me,\nhad suddenly become, very cold.i It would have been easy for any one\nto have ascertained that some years ago I lost a very delicate child,2\nwhose health had been a permanent anxiety to us since her birth. It\nwould have been as easy to learn that the child was a girl, but this\nSelly had not done ; she spoke of the child on this occasion as Helen's\ni It is [ ii . i i i . ] i - worth noting that on another occasion, when speaking of a person\nwho had died suddenly from an accident, in full vigour of health, Nelly drew my\nattention to the heat of Mrs. Thompson's hand, due, according to her, to the\nextreme vitality of the person in (Iuestion.\n2 In the account of my sittings with Mrs. Piper (Proceedings, vol.

[PART\nbrother, and on an earlier occasion she had spoken of a dead boy\nbelonging to me, saying, there was \"a little boy at our house\n(i.e. dead), he would have been about 11 ; he's not got a name.\nLittle Arthur, I call him that. Mrs. Cartwright says he's a little\nArthur.\"i\nI pass to the second statement referring to me. At a very early\nsitting the sensitive said that there had been an old Frenchman want\ning to see me ; she gave a description fairly resembling my French\ngrandfather, who died before my birth, but she added that he was\ncertainly no relation.2 If she had guessed or known that I had\nFrenchmen among the dead \" belonging to \" me, it would seem\ngratuitous to insist that this one was no relation ; the statistical result\nhas been that these remarks appear as one incorrect statement (that\nthe Frenchman described was not my grandfather) and one true\nascertainable statement (that an old Frenchman belonged to me). By\na little more skill it would have been easy to avoid the false statement\nwithout showing a suspicious knowledge of the facts, but this is not\na solitary instance of Nelly's apparent lack of skill.\nThe two last statements about my affairs are as follows : After\nreading a letter from my mother under circumstances to be related\nhereafter (p. 204), she said that there was a French look about the\nwriter's personality, and I was also told that I had known Mr.\nEdmund Gurney. Both these facts are true and accessible. No\nfurther comment seems necessary. I quote them here to make the\nlist complete.\nThe greater number of ascertainable statements (14) concern my\nhusband; all but two were made at a sitting on November 2nd, 1899,\nwhen I had taken one of my husband's gloves to the sensitive. I had\ndone this because I had had through another sitter a few days before a\nmessage to the effect that Nelly saw \"Arthur Willgar3 walking on the\ni The child in question was born in September, 1888, and would therefore hare\nbeen just over 11 at the date of my sitting on October 4th, 1899. She died\nbefore learning to talk, but it is incorrect to say that she had no name. With\nregard to the words \" little Arthur,\" it is interesting to note that an aunt of my\nhusband's, to whom reference was made by Nelly during the same sitting, always\nspoke of her nephews' children by their father's names, as \"little Arthurs,\"\n\"little Toms,\" etc. This use of the phrase is suggested by the introduction\nof the indefinite article before the words at their second occurrence, \" Little\nArthur, I call him that. Mrs. Cartwright says he's a little Arthur.\"\n2 See App. D, Sitting 2, p. 223.\n3 My husband's baptismal names are Arthur Woollgar, the latter being his\nmother's maiden name.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 203\nold Chain Pier at Brighton shortly before it was blown away ; I don't\nthink he's married, but he's got a Helen belonging to him.\"\nIt would be wearisome to enumerate all the things that the sensitive\nsaid to me about the owner of the glove, whom she called Mr. Willgar,\nbut though there was a vague association with him of a \" Margaret \" as\nwell as of a \" Helen,\" she did not speak of him as my husband. The\nstatements made concerned his appearance, his occupation, his health,\nand his surroundings as a boy. But it is obvious that such facts as\nthat he used to be at an \" ungreen seaside, a housified place,\" which\nhad developed within his recollection to a \" nigger seaside,\" would be\nreadily enough made by any one who knew that my husband's family\nhave always lived at Brighton. This is not the place to relate either\nthe true and not ascertainable things, or the false things that were\ngiven side by side with these. There were not many of either, the\nlarger number of things said ou this occasion being what any one\nknowing the facts could know.\nTwo classes, (b) and (a), remain for discussion, which I have separated\nfrom the rest, as they seem to call for special treatment\u2014facts contained\nin letters and names connected with the sitter. I have kept these two\nclasses to the end as I think that in them, if anywhere, are to be found\nthe \" suspicious circumstances \" for which we are looking. Among the\ntabulated statements are seven referring to the contents of letters. On\nOctober 5th, 1899, I took to Mrs. Thompson's house two letters\nwritten to me about twenty years before by my mother. I had\nselected these two as containing distinctive matter, after reading some\nsix or seven. The sitting was one of the most unsatisfactory I have\nhad ; Mrs. Thompson was in great anxiety about a friend who was on\nthat day undergoing a severe operation. I gave her one of the two\nletters, not myself knowing which of the two it was. Mrs. Thompson\nheld the letter in her right hand, with some of her fingers inside the\nenvelope. This is the usual plan, as Nelly does not profess to be able\nto tell anything of the contents of letters unless her mother's fingers\nare on the writing. Mrs. Thompson was sitting in a chair close to me\nand facing me, so that there is no question of her having withdrawn\nthe letter from the envelope, but as I took down in writing in my\nnotebook sixteen words between my giving the letter and the first\nutterance of hers about it, it is possible that the sensitive may have had a\nchance to see something when my eyes were on my notebook. I was\naware of the importance of watching and did what I could ; the right\nhand holding the letter was hanging down at her side and in the\nfrequent glances that I gave I saw no suspicious action. Nelly said\n0\n\f204 Mrs. A. W, Verrall. [PART\nthat the words \" I am sure \" occurred in the letter, that it was a lady's\nletter, that the writer was not very well,\u2014not in good health when she\nwrote. The words quoted do occur in the letter on the fourth or\noutside page about a third of the way down, so that the letter having\nbeen folded in three, they were at the bottom of the envelope, not\nvisible unless the letter was slipped out a little way. They could\nof course have been touched by the sensitive. The writer who was\nnot in good health when she wrote, refers to the subject of her health\nin one short sentence on the third page, so that the reference could not\nhave been seen unless the letter had been taken out, unfolded, and\nopened. It is certain then that this sentence was not read by any\nnormal method, and if we are to suppose that the success, such as it\nwas, with this letter was obtained by normal methods, we must, I\nthink, count the remark about the health of the writer as a lucky shot.\nIt is possible to say the same of the other words, but I have read\nthrough some twenty letters of this writer, and not found the words\n\" I am sure \" in any other letter. I have no experience as to the\ngeneral possession of the faculty of reading words written in ink on\npaper by passing the fingers over them; I have made a few experi\nments, but have not found myself able to feel anything that can be\ninterpreted, though I have occasionally been able, in the case of\nhandwritings very familiar to me, to assign the letters to their writers.\nProbably the faculty of discerning by the touch varies with different\npeople.\nThe second letter, which had not left my handbag, was brought\nhome, put in an undirected envelope, and endorsed as having been\ntaken to town but not shown to Mrs. Thompson. It was placed\namong a large number of other letters, awaiting periodical sorting and\ndestruction, on a shelf over my writing table in my husband's study.\nThere it was when Mrs. Thompson came to stay with me on December\n4th of the same year. I had no intention of making any further use of\nthe letter, but on December 6th, at luncheon, Mrs. Thompson told me\nthat Mrs. Cartwright had said she would come, and as I had heard\nthat Mrs. Cartwright made a speciality of reading letters, I thought\nthat I would be provided with a letter in case she came. Accordingly,\nat three o'clock when I went into the drawing-room where the sitting\nwas to be, I took with me the letter which I had brought back from\nLondon unshown, and a small trinket, and without any concealment\nput them both in the cupboard of my writing-table, turning the key as\nusual. I did not leave the room till after the sitting, so that the letter\nwas certainly not read by Mrs. Thompson on the afternoon of the 6th.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 205\nThe rooms used by Mrs. Thompson during her visit to me did not\ninclude the study, where my husband sat except in the morning when\nhe was at College. Mrs. Thompson was not alone in the house at any\ntime during her visit, except for about three-quarters of an hour in the\nmorning of the 6th, when my husband, my daughter, and I were\nall out. It will be seen, then, that there was a time when Mrs.\nThompson was alone with the servants in the house, and that the\n.endorsement on the envelope would have drawn attention to the\n.contents as a likely subject for experiment, had any one found the\nletter. I am not suggesting that Mrs. Thompson found the letter;\nI am explaining that I have not counted the accurate statements as\nto its contents among those supernormally acquired, since I regret to\nsay that the conditions were not absolutely strict, as I had intended\nthat they should be, and at the time believed them to be.\nThe letter was held by Mrs. Thompson in the usual way, and\nthere was no question this time of the possibility of a glance while I\nwas taking notes, for there was another sitter, Miss Harrison, in the\nroom, who was at leisure to watch closely what was done, and\nsaw no suspicious movements.\nThe statements made by Mrs. Cartwright were as follows. I quote\nthe contemporary notes :\n\" ' My dear May,'\u2014I can't read every word ; the lady who writes it is\ntroubled about ' my dear May's ' overstudying ; there is a great talk about\n1 changing one's mind ' (after a pause to me). ' It's to you the letter is ; I\nhad so sensed the name Margaret to you ; that's strange. She either wants\nyon to change your mind or ... it's written by a loving mother ' (after a\npause, distinctly). ' I cannot help you to find the book.' [I did not under\nstand what she meant, whether she was reading the letter or speaking of\nsomething else. I had no recollection of anything about a book, though the\ngeneral drift of the letter I knew, so I asked :] ' Are you saying that ? ' (Mrs.\nCartwright went on) : \"You want a book. It's a French book that is lost.\nI expect Rosa'si account of me makes you expect all to be correct. The\n.difficulty lies in the time at which it was written, and in the placing and\nreplacing of it in different envelopes. 1 get the idea that when it was\nwritten the lady was a little put out at something that had been done, but,\nwished you not to gather that. Her thoughts are all of love, but she feels\n.annoyance. ' Merrifield ' (pronounced Merrlfield with a strong accent on\n.the second syllable, of which the ' i ' was made long). This seems to be the\nname of a house more than of a person ; I can't get it as signature. I can't\nrealise how it is, but I feel that I must go to look for a French book,\nand yet the letter was written long ago.' Mrs. Cartwright went at this\npoint, and Nelly returned. She asked for the letter, and on having it\ni Mrs. Thompson.\n\f206 Mrs. A. W. Veil-all. [PART\nsaid she could only see 'Lily, not Helen's Lilian.' The next day I told\nNelly that the name given by her from the letter was right, to -which\nshe replied 'Oh yes, Edith.'\"\nThe statements as to facts in this letter appear to be six in all,\nnamely, (1) the state of feeling of the writer; (2) the lost French\nbook ; (3) the relationship to me of the writer ; (4) the name\nMerrifield ; (5) the name Lily ; (6) the name Edith. The facts are\nas follows : The letter was written to me by my mother under a\nmisapprehension as to a proposed course of work for me ; she thought\nI proposed to alter my work very considerably, taking on more\nthan had been planned ; she introduces her comments with the words\n\" This gives me an opportunity to laugh at you a bit for your\ninconsistency.\" There is no sign of annoyance in the letter, which\nends, after calling me \" not-know-your-own-mind,\" with the phrase\n\" your mother loves you,\" and the usual signature of initials only,\nM. A. M. A later letter, written after my mother had found that\nshe had misunderstood my letter to her, shows that when she\nwrote the earlier letter she had been seriously disturbed, not\nto say vexed, at what she believed to be my change of plan.\nThat later letter was the one which had been given to Mrs.\nThompson in town; the remarks on this subject were on the\nsecond and third (inner) pages, and so had certainly not been seen\nby her in a normal manner. In the letter given to Mrs. Cart-\nwright my mother mentions with regret that my sister had recently\nlost her French exercise book, that they had hoped to recover it,\nbut had not done so. The names Lily and Edith do occur in the\nletter, the former twice. Four other Christian names occur, besides\nmy sister's name, Flora, twice. It is noticeable that \"Merrifield,\"\nthough not the name of a house, is not in the signature; as\nuttered by Mrs. Cartwright it suggests to me a sort of \" portmanteau \"\nof my mother's name, which was Maria Merrifield. The trance\npersonality had mentioned the name Merrifield some time before\nas belonging to me, and had then pronounced it rightly, and had\nshown the conception she had of the meaning and pronunciation of\nit by calling it, as an alternative, Happyfield, so that this curious mis\npronunciation seems to be wholly gratuitous on the assumption that\nthe sensitive was normally acquainted with the contents of the letter,\nand was guessing that the final M. in the initials stood for the name she\nhad already used.\nAs bearing on the question of how the sensitive obtained her\nknowledge of the contents of the letter, it is perhaps worth noting\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 207\nthat the account she gave is not quite what would be expected\nfrom a person who had recently read it and wished to reproduce\nits contents. The first thing mentioned in the letter, the actual raison\n<?etre of the letter, was that a lamp, which was coming to me as\na present from some friends, had been sent off. Of this no mention\nwas made by Mrs. Cartwright, though it would seem a definite piece\nof information likely to be noted by any one reading the letter with\na view to reproducing its contents. There is another small\nerror which struck me at the time. The letter really begins\u2014\"My\ndearest May.\" This is represented in Mrs. Cartwright's version by\nthe words, \" My dear May,'' a sufficiently obvious guess, but wholly\nuncharacteristic of the writer. This particular form of opening was\nnever, to the best of my belief, used by the writer; it certainly does\nnot occur among the numerous letters which I have preserved. On\nthe whole, however, the contents of the letter are very well and\nfully reproduced, and it is obvious that they must in some way\nhave become known to Mrs. Thompson or to the trance personality.\nThe reason why I have spoken of this as a possibly suspicious\ncircumstance is that it is the only letter which has been read in\ndetail within my knowledge with conspicuous success, and, unfor\ntunately, owing to the circumstances above described, it is the only\nletter of which I am unable to say that it is impossible that the\nsensitive should have seen it.\nIt should be noted that I have myself only on one other occasion\nbesides the above given Mrs. Thompson a letter to read. So far she\nhas had no success ; but as it is possible that something more may\ncome of this letter later, I am unable to say any more on the\nsubject here. Other letters have been given her in my presence.\nIn one case she made incorrect statements about the writer ; in\nanother some correct and some incorrect; in the third case the\ngiving of a letter resulted in a very striking and definite allusion\nto the death of a relative of the writer. (See page 214.)\nI pass on to the last class (a) of true but discoverable facts\u2014that\nof names connected with the sitter. Fourteen out of the total ol\nfifty-one ascertainable statements were, as I have said, names given on\nvarious occasions in the course of the sittings. Three of these\nbelong to my husband's surroundings, three to my own, and eight to\nMiss Harrison's. The three belonging to my husband are as follows :\n(1) That \"some one called Mary Elizabeth, is it Mary or Marian ?\nThey say Mary Elizabeth \" knew him as a little boy. My husband's\nyounger sister is called Marian Elizabeth. She was, as I have been\n\f208 Mr?. A. W. Verrall. [PART\ntold, called after two aunts, Mary and Elizabeth, a modification of\nthe former name being given to avoid confusion.\n(2) Henry was said to be the name of his father. This is true.\n(3) His own name was said to be Arthur Willgar : the latter\nname being also that of his mother. This is almost correct. His\nsecond name is Woollgar, which was his mother's maiden name.\nThree of the names belong to me ; they are as follows :\n(4) Merrifield was said to be the name of a lady in my family.\nThe name was given at first thus: \"Merrifield, Merriman, Merry\nthought, Merrifield ; there is an old lady named one of those who,\"\netc. Later, Nelly said: \"Mrs. Merrythought, that's not quite\nright; it's like the name of a garden,\" and after in vain trying to\ngive me the name exactly, she said : \" I will tell you how names\ncome to us. It's like a picture : I see school children enjoying\nthemselves. You can't say Merrymans, because that's not a name,\nnor Merrypeople.\" Nelly, later on, spoke of my mother as \" Mrs.\nHappyfield,\" or \" Mrs. Merrifield,\" with indifference.\n(5) Nelly spoke of my sister by name, but said that her mother\nhad seen the name in the S.P.R. Journal a day or two before.\n(6) Nelly said that Vernon was a name belonging to me : it is\nthe name of the Terrace where my father lives at Brighton.\nIn this collection of names there is nothing of any special\ninterest, as the facts could have no doubt been ascertained by\nany one who wished to learn them, except perhaps in the introduc\ntion of Mary Elizabeth, with the suggestion of Marian. Neither is\nthere anything the least suspicious in the way in which they were\nused, nor in the fact that they were used.\nThe names connected with Miss Harrison are eight. One of\nthem was the name of a place where a dead friend had lived; but\nas it was not mentioned till after the identification of the friend,\nit has no evidential value, and is parallel to the introduction of\nthe name Vemon in my case. The other seven were given in two\ninstalments, three and four at a time, and it is the circumstances\nconnected with them which may at first sight be called \" suspicious.\"\nThe first interview between Mrs. Thompson and Miss Harrison '\ntook place in my house on Dec. 6th, 1899, and I took notes.\nMuch was said about her mother, and I, who knew that Mrs.\ni At this interview, when Miss Harrison was introduced as a stranger (see\np. 211), among many true things said to her came four names, correctly given.\nWith these I am not now dealiug, as they have been classed among the 90 true\nstatements that could not have been ascertained by normal means (see p. 172).\n\fXLTV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 209\nHarrison's maiden name had been Elizabeth Nelson, was constantly\nlooking for the name ; but we did not get it. On Thursday, the\n7th Dec., Mrs. Thompson left Cambridge, and on Dec. 8th I\nreceived from her, as told to her in trance, the following message :\n\" Grandfather Nelson tried to speak, and caused a mixed influence.\nElizabeth was dead ; Ellen was alive. She gave Ellen's name, but\nnot in full. She sends her love to Barker or Barker's son, and \"\n\u2014the rest was indistinct, Mrs. Thompson added. Mrs. Thompson's\nletter was dated Dec. 7th, 7.30 P.M.\nThis message, to be intelligible, needs a somewhat lengthy ex\nplanation. Miss Harrison's name, which is Jane Ellen Harrison,\nhad been given as Jane Harrison at the sitting :\" not, therefore, in\nfull. Elizabeth Nelson is her mother's name, and Ellen Nelson is\nthe name of the mother's only sister, after whom Miss Harrison\nreceived her second name. This aunt long outlived the mother ;\nbut it seems that by Ellen in the message is meant rather Miss\nHarrison herself, since the name was said to have been given.\nBarkston Mansions is the name of a building where Miss Harrison\nhad a flat for some years, but she had left it some two years before\nthe sitting. The message is obscure enough for an oracle, and\nperhaps needs as much interpreting ; but, leaving aside the doubtful\nEllen, three points come out clearly : Grandfather Nelson, a dead\nElizabeth, and Barker or Barker's son.i These three names were\nknown to me at the time of the sitting, as well as to Miss Harrison\nherself. I have ascertained that both names and the address are to\nbe found in earlier editions of Who's Who t though the latest editions\ngive Miss Harrison's later London address, Chenies Street Chambers,\nand not Barkston Mansions.\nBut this does not finish the history of Miss Harrison's names.\nJust before Christmas, about a fortnight after the sitting, I con\nsulted the last edition of Who's Who? to see what information it\nactually contained, and I thereby learnt the further facts that\nMiss Harrison's mother was described as Elizabeth Hawksley, daughter\nof Thomas Nelson, that her father's name was Charles, and that among\nher published works was mentioned a book on Greek vases, in which\nshe had collaborated with Mr. D. S. Maccoll. On January 3rd, 1900,\nMiss Harrison and I sat again with Mrs. Thompson, and the first\nremark that Nelly made was that Miss Harrison's mother was\ni The \" she \" referred to in the message is a new personality, who tried to\ncommunicate, and who certainly did know Miss Harrison while she lived at\nBarkiton Mansions.\n\f210 Mrs. A. W. Yen-all. [PART\nnamed Elizabeth, then that she was Elizabeth Hawksley or Hortsly ;\nlater on she said that Miss Harrison's father was called Charles,\nthat the grandfather was Thomas Nelson, and that a Mr. Coll, Cawl,\nMaccole, gave Miss Harrison a lot of papers that were not cheques\nor bank-notes. The name Barkston was also uttered, and on my\nasking Nelly what it was, she said that it was the name of a\nhouse, Barkston Street, Place, Gardens.\nHere, then, at this sitting were produced four new names, Hawkslej\",\nCharles, Thomas, and Maccoll, all to be found in Who's Who? and\nall recently suggested to me by the paragraph in Who's JThoi The\nfact that seven names were given after the identification of the\nsitter, when there 'had been time for investigation of her history, is\nundoubtedly very suspicious, but no less curious is the division of these\nnames into two groups of three and four names respectively, cor\nresponding with the information possessed by mo. It would have\nbeen more satisfactory if the first batch had been given at the first\ninterview with the then unknown sitter, but if this knowledge was as a\nfact obtained by the sensitive through the book of reference in ques\ntion, it is a most extraordinary coincidence that the names which\nwere in the book, but which I did not then know\u2014Hawksley, Thomas\nand Charles\u2014should not have been given till after I did know them.\nIn forming a judgment on these facts I think some attention also\nshould be paid to the form in which the word Barkston appears in\nthe first communication, a written one, from Mrs. Thompson, namely,\nas Barker or Barker's son. This does not look like the error of a\ncopyist but of a hearer, and if we are to suppose that the sensitive\nobtained information from a normal source and endeavoured by the use\nof such information to impress the sitter, we are bound to admit\nthat the method adopted was certainly not obvious, that it was, indeed,\nso ingenious that it might easily have failed of its purpose ; for it is\nplain that the phrase \" she sends her love to Barker or Barker's son \"\nmight very easily have been put down as sheer nonsense, when it is\nremembered that Barkston Gardens was not the actual present address\nof the sitter.i But it will be said by the sceptic, and it cannot be\ndenied, that the ingenuity of the fraudulent medium is only equalled\nby that of the interpreter of oracles, and the question obviously admits\nof no certain answer. The reader must form his own judgment on\nthe facts.\ni It was, as I have said, the address familiar to the friend who is represented in\nMrs. Thompson's message as sending the communication.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 211\nFIRST INTERVIEWS.\nThe best way, as it seems to me, of throwing light on the question of\nhow the sensitive obtains her information is to examine very carefully\nwhat facts she is able to give at a first interview with an unknown\nsitter.i I have myself only a limited experience of this, as I\nhave only twice introduced new sitters. One of these two was\nMiss Harrison, and it will be instructive to note what facts\nwere told her before the sensitive had any opportunity of consulting\nbiographical dictionaries. The other new sitter came to a meeting\nwhich is not included in the sittings which have furnished my statistics,\nand with an account of what happened at these two \" first sittings \" I\nwill conclude this already lengthy paper.\nIt was during Mrs. Thompson's visit to me in December, 1899, that\nI decided to introduce to her Miss Jane Harrison. I arranged with\nMiss Harrison, who was at the time in residence at Newnham College,\nto come to my house in the afternoon of December 6th, and to wait\nin my husband's study till I should send for her. I gave orders to the\nmaid at three in the afternoon, after Mrs. Thompson was estab\nlished in the drawing-room for the sitting, to show Miss Harrison into\nthe study when she came, and not to announce her to me in the\ndrawing-room. I then told my daughter that when the trance had\nbegun I should send her from the drawing-room to bring in Miss\nHarrison from the study, and my daughter was not alone with Mrs.\nThompson after hearing this. As no other persons besides those just\nmentioned knew of the arrangement between Miss Harrison and myself\nthat she should have a sitting, and as Miss Harrison did not come to\nour house or otherwise see Mrs. Thompson during the two days\npreceding the sitting, when Mrs. Thompson was my guest, I think\nit may be taken as certain that Miss Harrison was, as I intended\nshe should be, a wholly unknown stranger.\nWhen the trance had well begun and I heard the bell\nring, and so knew that the visitor was in the house, I sent my\ndaughter away, and Miss Harrison came silently into the room and sat\non a sofa at a little distance. Mrs. Thompson had been informed\nthat a new visitor was to come, and that the visitor was a lady. She\nhad expressed some anxiety lest it should be a lady whom she already\nknew and with whom she had not had a successful sitting, and I had\ni For this purpose I do not count myself as an unknown sitter. Mrs. Thompson\nknew my name when I first met her, and it was then understood that I was to have\na sitting some day.\n\f212 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nreassured her, or rather Nelly, on this point. That was all that\nhad been said on the subject. I give the report of the opening of the\nsitting from my notes taken at the time, read over to Miss Harrison and\napproved by her, and written out the next day :\nNelly (to J. E. H.). \" Have you been pouring something out of one\nbottle into another, from a wide-necked one into another ? I quite distinctly\nsee it.\" (After a short pause.) \" I will do that letter.\"\n[Miss Harrison had brought three or four letters in a bag, but had not\ntaken them out. At this Miss H. gave me one of them in a blank\nenvelope and said :]\nMiss H. \" I don't know which letter I've given you.\"\nNelly. \" It doesn't matter \" (holding the letter in its envelope). \" It\nseems like . . . not a happy feeling, Mrs. Verrall; put mother's fingers on\nthe letter.\" (I inserted Mrs. Thompson's fingers into the letter.)\nNelly. \" The lady is dead belonging to this letter ; she's not Jinny's\nrelation. Jimmy, Jemmy, Jenny. The one that writes the letter has a\nstrange influence. It's a man's influence in a woman's mind, there are\nechoes of a man's thoughts. I don't know whether a man wrote it.\"\nNelly then invited \" Jinny \" to come nearer, which Miss Harrison did.\nNelly. \" I can see you talking to Mrs. Sidgwick ; you are one of the\ntalkers at Mrs. Sidgwick's house. You have not got a mother. Your\nmother is at our house ; she thought : ' Jinny.' Your mother died and\nsome one else in the same year.\"\nMiss H. \" It was a long time ago.\"\nNelly. \" It makes me feel sad. After your mother died something cheery\nhappened, a success, but too late for your mother to know. There's a\nMargaret associated with you, and Anna, 1 Anna belonged to a dead\nlady, not old, looks 45 now ; has a smooth face. The lady (Miss\nHarrison's mother) had a crape shawl with silk fringe ; I can see it\non ; you have a photograph of her with the shawl, a grand dress sticking\nout, with the shawl on cornerways. A lady belonging to you had\na cancer ; you heard about that with other sad things. You've got a ring\nbelonging to some one, not your mother, that's dead.\"\nMiss H. \" I had, but I've lost it.\"\nNelly. \" Did you leave it by the wash basin ? It was lost not in\nCambridge, but further away. Poor thing, she had her head aching, she lay\ndown a long time, did not die quickly. She has been dead a long time.\nShe's a bright lady, not a talking lady.\"\nThe sitting was a long one and cannot be printed without omissions,\nas it contains references to some private matters, and to some other\nmatter which is incomplete at present and to which it would be\npremature to refer. But the above quotation will show the reader\nthat definite statements were made to an unknown sitter without\ni Not the real name.\n\fxuv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 213\nany suggestion from either the sitter or the note-taker, and these\ndefinite statements are almost without exception correct. Thus, as\nregards the remark about the bottle from which Miss Harrison was said\nto have been pouring something, this conveyed no impression to me at\nthe time, nor to Miss Harrison. Later on in the sitting, Nelly returned\nto the subject, saying, \" I see a bottle department, this lady will think\nof me when she pours from one bottle to another, perhaps glycerine\n(this word was said with some hesitation) ; it's not a scientific depart\nment.\" Miss Harrison, who at the second reference to the bottles\nhad wondered whether Nelly was thinking of a recent visit she had\nmade to a newly-equipped laboratory at Newnham College, here asked\nwhether Nelly could see the bottles, and Nelly answered, \"They are\nglass bottles, one wider in the neck than the other.\" It was only on\nher way home after the sitting that Miss Harrison remembered that she\nhad during the last two months been regularly making \" sparklets,\" and\nso had constantly been engaged in filling a narrow-necked glass bottle\nfrom a wider mouthed one. It seems likely that the word glycerine\nwas an attempt to give the characteristic word \" gazogene,\" but even\nthough this word was not given, there can be no doubt that Nelly's\ngeneral account is appropriate, and aptly describes what Miss Harrison,\nunknown to me, had been constantly doing, and would soon do again.\nThe next statement concerned the letter given, which was one of\ntwo or three brought by Miss Harrison. As she said at the time, she\nwas not sure which letter she had taken out. It was found after the\nsitting that the writer was a man and was alive. The first statement\nmade by Nelly was therefore incorrect, and the later remarks are too '\nvague to be valuable, though the form of the words suggests a gradual\nchange of impression on the part of the speaker, and apparently a final\ninclination to think the writer a man. It is interesting to note that as\nneither of the persons present knew at the time which letter the\nsensitive was holding, the modification of her view can have been due\nneither to thought transference nor to fishing.\nThe use of the name \" Jinny \" is very interesting. It was a name\nused in Miss Harrison's childhood, and is still used by her family,\nbut not by any of her Cambridge friends. Later on the name Jane\nwas used when Nelly was speaking of a recently dead friend of\nMiss Harrison's who called her Jane, but Nelly did not at first seem to\nrealise who Jane was ; she had called the sitter Jinny, and suddenly\nsaid, after describing the dead friend, \" who was Jane t She's\nassociated with the lady (i.e. the dead lady), it's not her name ;\n\u2022Jane was a sorry lady because this lady died.\" Again a few\n\f\u2022214 Mr\u00bb. A. W. Verrall. [PART\nminutes later she turned to me and asked me whether I called Miss\nHarrison Jinny, a name, she said, which was nicer than Jane.\nThe sensitive correctly stated that Miss Harrison's mother was dead,\nand there is in the possession of the eldest daughter a framed minia\nture showing Mrs. Harrison in a dress with crinoline and a fringeil\nshawl worn \" cornerwise.\" The two names, Margaret and Anna,i\nhave associations for Miss Harrison, and the description of the lady to\nwhom \" Anna \" belonged is accurate as far as it goes. The name of the\nlady was not given by Nelly in connexion with her, but almost immedi\nately after the short description of this lady, whom I have called Mrs.\nB., Nelly mentioned the surname in a form very usual with her when\nshe has a fact to communicate of which she does not apparently see\nthe precise significance. She said, \" What's B ? \" No answer\nwas made, and she went on to mention the Christian name and\nsurname of the lady's husband, also dead, but dismissed them as those\nof the friend of a former sitter. This former sitter was well acquainted\nwith Mrs. B. and with her husband, and had, in fact, received from\nNelly some months earlier a message purporting to come from Mr. B.,\nwhose Christian and surname were mentioned by Nelly. There would\nhave been no reason for Mrs. Thompson to think it likely that Miss\nHarrison and the former sitter would have acquaintance in common,\neven had she known Miss Harrison. As a fact Nelly spoke in Miss\nHarrison's sitting as though the husband were dead, and she did not\ngive any name to the wife; but that in some inexplicable way the\ntrance personality was aware of the name is, I think, shown by the\notherwise motiveless introduction of the surname and husband's full\nname, though she dismissed them as inappropriate on this occasion.\nAt this sitting, in close conjunction with a description of Mrs. B.,\ncame the mention of her husband's name, though it was not till a\nsubsequent sitting that Nelly completed the identification and recog\nnised that the Mr. B. of one of her sitters was the husband of\nthe lady described to Miss Harrison at this first sitting with her.\nIt is true that the owner of the ring which had been lost died after a\nlingering illness, of which one of the most marked and distressing\nsymptoms was constant severe headache.\nThe most striking incident in this sitting has been briefly referred to\nearlier in this paper. It also relates to Mrs. B. One of the letters\nbrought by Miss Harrison (see page 212) was given to the sensitive,\nwho instantly spoke of the loss sustained by some relatives of the\nwriter, and went on to give a description of the dead lady and of the\ni Not the real name.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 215\ncircumstances of her death, which made the identification beyond dispute.\nThe letter was not written by the dead lady herself, but by a relative,\nand this fact was apparently recognised by Nelly, for she said to me\nin reference to the letter contained in the envelope which she held in\nher hand, \" Mrs. Verrall, a live person's letter won't get me on to a dead\nperson.\"\nLater in the same sitting it was correctly stated that Miss Harrison\nhad come to my house from Newnham College, and an additional\ndescription was given, in order that we might not think Nelly was\n\"only guessing,\" which correctly determined in which of the three\nHalls Miss Harrison was living.\nThe full name, Christian and surname, of a lady who had already been\nspoken of to me by name at an earlier sitting as a friend of mine, was-\nmentioned by Nelly as one whom \" this lady \" (Miss Harrison) knew\nall about, and in the few words that followed Nelly seemed to us both\nto describe accurately the relations between the lady named and Miss\nHarrison. The lady was a College friend of us both, but more\nintimate with me.\nIn this first sitting, then, with Miss Harrison, a stranger, introduced\nunder the conditions described above, names were given and incidents\nrelated, which warrant, in my opinion, the assertion that Mrs.\nThompson showed herself possessed of knowledge not normally\nattainable. The same thing occurred in the case of the other sitter\nwhom I introduced in December, 1900, also under conditions\nprecluding the possibility of previous investigations by the sensitive\ninto his antecedents.\nI bad arranged with Mrs. Thompson to bring a friend to a sitting on\nMonday, December 1 7, 1900. I was to meet Mrs. Thompson in town and\ngo with her to the rooms of the Society in Buckingham Street, at 2.30\no'clock. The sitter was to come to the rooms not before three and\nknock at the door without entering, to inform me of his arrival, as\nI was anxious that he should not enter until the trance had begun.\nNo one but the sitter, myself and my husband knew who it was that I\nproposed to introduce. The arrangements were carried out as planned.\nAfter Mrs. Thompson had become entranced, I brought the sitter into\nthe room, where he took up a position behind a screen. It was\nimpossible that Mrs. Thompson should have seen him. The early part\nof the sitting was fairly good ; the sensitive correctly described the\nstate of health of the visitor and his habitual occupations. I gave her\nin succession two objects which he handed to me, a pair of sleeve links\nand a gentleman's ring. She at once asked for the tie which belonged\n\f216 Mrs. A. W. Yen-all. [PART\nto the ring, and added that the tie was black and that it belonged to\nthe gentleman then sitting behind what she resentfully spoke of as\n\" that umbrella.\" The ring had, as I found afterwards, been taken off\nthe black tie worn by the sitter to give to the sensitive, but there was\nnothing to show that it had been so worn. I suppose it is possible\nthat the movements made in thus removing it may have been audible to\nthe sensitive, but I do not see how the colour of the tie could have\nbeen discovered even by hyperaesthesia.\nThere seemed throughout the interview a considerable confusion\nbetween the affairs of the sitter and my own. This was perhaps\ndue to the perplexity introduced by the new condition,i as it has\nnot occurred to anything like the same extent in other cases within\nmy experience. Nelly seemed restless and anxious, and passed from\ntopic to topic much more rapidly than is usual with her. It was\ndifficult to analyse her somewhat discursive remarks, but undoubtedly\nthings were said that were appropriate to the sitter's friends and\nother things that referred to mine. There was, however, a con\nsiderable amount of unidentifiable matter.\nAt the end of an hour, as we had arranged, the sitter came out\nfrom behind the screen, and from that moment things went much\nbetter. Nelly expressed regret, as the links were handed back, at\nnot having been able to \"get anything\" about them. She added:\n\" I should like something belonging to the links : there's a little hair\nchain belonging to them.\" The sitter replied that he had not got\nthat, and could not find or bring it. Nelly went on to describe it\nin some detail: it had, she said, \"little rounds on, round gold things,\nthat used to move up and down.\" The sitter has since informed\nme that the hair chain, belonging to the owner of the links, had\ngold rings upon it at intervals, but that they were not moveable.\nNelly further said that, in default of the chain, she would like the\n\"pencil, with separate leads to be fitted in, not an ordinary pencil\nlike that (taking up a wooden pencil from the table) ; you put the\nleads into it separately.\" She went on to say that there had been\na difficulty about getting leads to fit the pencil. It is true that the\nsitter possesses a gold pencil case that had belonged to the owner\nof the links and the hair chain, and that he had had considerable\ndifficulty in obtaining leads that would fit it. He writes to me that\n\u2022\"after she had mentioned the chain, which I had up to that moment\nentirely forgotten, I was not surprised at her mentioning the pencil\ncase, but was rather surprised at her reminding me of the difficulty\ni The sitter has been visible to Nelly in all my other sittings.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 217\nthat I had had in getting leads to fit it.\" Nelly further said that\nthe same person \" had a box with compasses in.\" This statement\nis also correct. She mentioned no other articles in connexion with\nthe links.\nNow, I think that any impartial reader will admit that the cir\ncumstances related above are very remarkable, and even if they\nstood alone, would go far to substantiate the claim of the sensitive\nto the possession of supernormal knowledge. A stranger gives to\nthe sensitive a pair of gold sleeve links that had belonged to a\nfriend who died out of England, and who had certainly never met\nMrs. Thompson, no one but himself knowing what article he intended\nto bring ; the sensitive tells him of three other articles belonging to\nthe owner of the links, a hair chain with moveable gold rings, a\npencil case to which there had been difficulty in fitting leads, and a\nbox containing compasses,\u2014all which articles did, as a fact, belong\nto the owner of the links ; she makes no mention of articles which\nhe did not possess; the description of the article? is definite, and\nwith the exception of the moveability of the rings, entirely accurate.\nWithout propounding any theory as to how Mrs. Thompson's trance\npersonality obtained this information, I think that we are justified in\nattributing it to no method hitherto recognised as normal.\nI have now presented all the facts and all the observations which\nI have so far been able to record concerning the phenomena occurring\nin the case of Mrs. Thompson. I have taken especial pains to draw\nattention to the failures and shortcomings, as well as to the suc\ncesses, which I have personally observed. In particular, I have\ncollected together for purposes of comparison a little group of\ncircumstances, which, did they stand alone, might seem to suggest\nthe illegitimate employment of normal means of acquiring informa\ntion, though I wish here to repeat emphatically that throughout the\nwhole course of my acquaintance with Mrs. Thompson, no single\nsuspicious or even doubtful incident has come within my knowledge.\nThis group of facts must be judged, not in isolation, but in its\nrelation with other groups; indeed, the whole of the phenomena\nrecorded by me must be regarded as merely part, and not a very\nlarge part, of the general evidence that has been collected.\nIt is not my intention in this paper to express any opinion\non the general character of the phenomena presented by Mrs.\nThompson. To do so would require a more intimate acquaintance\nthan I have with the records of other observers of this sensitive,\n\f218 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PAUT\nand would need deep and wide knowledge of the results of\nsimilar experiments with other trance mediums ; it would demand\na training and experience, not to mention other qualities, to\nwhich I have no claim. All I have here attempted is to give\na full account of the phenomena occurring under my personal\nobservation. My attempt at classification is an endeavour to make\nthe details easier to follow, and is made rather with the hope of\nenabling the reader to grasp these details than of suggesting any\ntheory for their explanation. That Mrs. Thompson is possessed\nof knowledge not normally obtained I regard as established beyond\na doubt ; that the hypothesis of fraud, conscious or unconscious on\nher part, fails to explain the phenomena, seems to be equally\ncertain; that to more causes than one is to be attributed the\nsuccess which I have recorded seems to me likely. There is, I\nbelieve, some evidence to indicate that telepathy between the sitter\nand the trance personality is one of these contributory causes.\nBut that telepathy from the living, even in an extended sense of\nthe term, does not furnish a complete explanation of the occurrences\nobserved by me, is, as readers of this paper will have noticed, my\npresent belief. More than this I do not feel warranted in saying\nuntil further evidence has been obtained : it is to the records of\nother observers and to the accumulation of the experience of different\nsitters that we must look for the material to enable us to judge what\nfurther causes are at work.\nAPPENDIX A.\nLIST OF PREDICTIONS.\nA (FULFILLED\u2014TRUE).\n(1) That Nelly would be talking at twenty minutes to ten the\nnext evening.\nB (Nox FULFILLED\u2014FALSE).\n(1) That A.i would have a cough in the winter of 1899-1900.\n(2) That B. would be told by a friend of a great scandal or\nmisfortune at C.\ni Many of these statement)) will be found in the reports of sittings quoted or\nprinted in App. D, often with the names in full.

Sometimes\nthe form is interrogative ; Nelly may say \"Do you ever do so and so ? \"\nthe fact being that the action described is appropriate to some one to\nwhom the sensitive has been referring, but not to the sitter. Some\ntimes, as in those cases classed as predictions, the trance personality\nseems to use the prophetic form to convey information of which she\nhas no clear knowledge. For instance, in case (B) (5) it was not\nlikely, nor has it happened, that the lady \" D.\" would go to the North\np\n\f220 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PAKT\non any errand, sad or otherwise. But it was true, though unknown to\nNelly, that her old home had for years been in the North, and, as\nmight be expected, she had gone North more than once \"on sad\nerrands\"; and so \"going North on a sad errand\" was a description,\nhad it referred not to the future but to the past, which would have\nbeen applicable to the lady in question. In case (B) (8) Mrs.\nThompson knew of \" E.'s \" illness, and it is possible that the remark\nthat he would never completely get over it, might be only the expres\nsion of her feeling that his recovery was not proceeding rapidly; on\nseveral occasions I have found that the trance personality takes a\ndepressed view when there is any question of illness. In case\n(B) (9), where it was stated that \" F.\" would suffer from a specified\ndisease before a specified age, two statements were in fact made,\none that \"F.\" would have a certain trouble with his health, and\nthe other that he was not yet 50 years old. The sensitive had\nmore than once referred to the health of \"F.,\" saying, what was\nnot correct, that he suffered from a particular weakness; she\nhad also expressed her conviction that he would not believe that this\nwas the case, and finally the remark was made, here classed as a\nprediction, \"'F.' is not fifty yet, he will not laugh so much at the\nhealth trouble when he is fifty.\" \" F.\" as a fact was not 49 when this\nwas said ; he is now past fifty, but has had no symptoms of the particular\nhealth trouble mentioned ; thus this remark, if it is to be regarded as a\nprediction, is not fulfilled; but if it is only a circuitous way of mention\ning \" F.'s \" age, it is a correct statement of an ascertainable fact, and\nhas for purposes of these statistics been counted under that head.\nIt is worth noting in this connexion that at the time these remarks\nwere made by the sensitive, the sitter was suffering from an attack of\npain due, as was subsequently determined by medical advice, to the\nparticular health trouble wrongly ascribed by the sensitive to the\nsitter's friend, \" F.\"\nAPPENDIX B.\nTABLE OF STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE PAST OR PRESENT\nWHICH ARE FALSE, CLASS F (see p. 169).\n( 1 ) That A. was at the time poorly.\n(2) That B. had recently painted a head.\n(3) That C. had had a specified accident.\n(4) That D. used to wear a particular kind of cap.\n\fxuv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 221\n(5) That E. had suffered from a specified disease (see App. A.,\ncase (B.), (9) and note).\n(6) That F. was fond of boating.\n(7) That G. had lost a boy who would have been eleven years\nold when the statement was made.\n(8) That a certain coat contained an unused railway ticket.\n(9) That H. was associated with a specified town.\n(10) That in I.'s house a fair-haired servant was ill.\n{11) That J.'s mother had a living son.\n(12) That K. had gone abroad (true) by a specified route (false).\n{13) That a friend of L.'s had died of a specified disease.\n(14) That there was a person called L.

Sometimes people come and talk, but sometimes\npictures.\"\nComments on the above account of Sitting 2.\n(1) No old Frenchman visited at our house. My mother's father, who\ndied before her marriage, was French. The description given answers fairly\nwell to my knowledge of him derived from description and a portrait in my\nfather's house at Brighton, where Mrs. Thompson had never been. He was\n\" not like a Frenchman,\" being fair with blue eyes, he had \" no beard,\" his\nforehead was \" rather large,\" but I know of no peculiarity about his ears.\nHe was not a \"wise man,\" but was a \"friend of all people.\" My mother was\ncalled \" Marie,\" and the name \" Louis,\" though not \" Louise,\" occurs in her\nfamily. Mr. Myers and I had spoken in Mrs. Thompson's presence of the\npossibility of my reading a paper in French at the Paris Congress, so that\nMrs. Thompson's normal personality knew that I spoke French. The fa<_-t\nthat my mother's family was French has been mentioned in the report on\nMrs. Piper's sittings (Proceedings, Vol. VI.), so that any one wishing to obtain\nfacts about me would have had no difficulty in discovering that I had H\nFrench grandfather.\n(2) The hair cross was taken by me from a small wooden Japanese box\nwith drawers ; the wood has a slight scent, but I could not myself detect any\nodour about the cross. I have never myself worn the cross except, years\nago, on a watch chain, but it was worn by my mother, who gave it to\nme, on black velvet. I cannot identify the lady described ; I was expecting\na description of the lady who made the cross (my cousin and godmother), but\nnone of Nelly's statements apply to her, except the possible connection with\nChristopher. When Nelly spoke of an operation, I remembered that my\ncousin had died of cancer, but had had no operation, and as I thought this,\nNelly went on to say \" not cancer.\" For the \" small thing\" which was \" got\nout \" of my mother's foot (not hand), see below (3) and (5).\nThe statement about the \"Parliamentary come down\" is wholly unintel\nligible to me. The remark about Helen's work seemed to reflect very\nvividly my own feeling at the time. I had come to the sitting straight from\na talk with some one who was teaching my daughter a wholly new subject ;\nwe had been arranging for some work to be done during my daughter's\nholidays, and I was disturbed at this, and afraid that the subject was too\nhard and would take too much time from her prol>er work.\n(3) Adolphe Lebas is unintelligible to me. The \"quilling, and hot-water\nbottles,\" etc., suggested my own mother, so I put a question about the\n\"operation.\" Owing to my carelessness as a very young child, a needle\nran into my mother's foot. The incident made a great impression ulwn\nme. The needle broke, and part was extracted, some time later, by our\ndoctor, a red-faced, clean-shaven man. For further details see below (5).\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 227\n(4) This question referred to a remark of Nelly's at my first informal\nsitting in April 1899. The note made by me on returning home at 11 p.m.,\non April 5th, was as follows :\n' \"Theodore\u2014not very near\u2014 only featuie is that the back of his head at\nthe top is prominent\u2014does not seem the same age as at first\u2014died at the\nordinary age\u2014 'old Theodore'\u2014doesn't like to talk\u2014reads a lot\u2014sits always\nin the same place by the fire\u2014on the right-hand side\u2014 opposite an old-\nfashioned horse-hair arm-chair\u2014in a place with bars to the windows\u2014and\ncows to be seen\u2014was fond of fishing\u2014wears woollen under his waistcoat,\nand carpet slippers with animals' heads worked on them.\"\nLater, I added from recollection the words : \" Wouldn't wear patent\nleather shoes for the Queen\u2014slippers have foxes' heads, or at least some\nanimals'.\"\nThe most recent death among my relatives was that of a cousin, Theodore,\nwho went out to Australia as a young man, and died there at about seventy\nyears old. The mention of Theodore recalled to me my personal recollec\ntion of him, which is very vivid, as a young man, but I immediately remem\nbered that he was an old man when he died. On April 22nd I talked over\nwith my sister our recollections of this cousin ; she told me that he had been\nvery melancholy during the last few months of his life, and very silent. We\nboth remembered something about my having worked wool-work slippers\nfor him when he went to Australia ; my sister thought she remembered that\nthere were foxes' heads on the slippers, several small heads, and my father,\nwhen asked, had a vague impression of foxes' heads on slippers as a piece of\nchildish needlework. I also, on reflexion, recalled that I had bought the\nslippers with a pattern ready worked, and had with great labour and much\nunpicking, filled in the ground behind them. This was the condition of my\nmemory when I saw Mrs. Thompson on July 27th, and in the interval\nbetween April 22nd and July 27th, I had not mentioned the subject to\nanyone. Mrs. Thompson was not then, and is not now, acquainted with my\nfather and sister.\nIt will be noted that on this occasion, without prompting from me, she\nadded to her first vague connexion of Theodore with carpet slippers that they\nhad been worked by me, with difficulty, and that I had filled in the canvas,\nthe heads being already done.\n(5) Miss Johnson's notes here have the words, \"needle, not crochet hook,\nthat ran into the lady,\" and it does not appear certain whether they were to\nl\u00bbe assigned to Mrs. Thompson, or to me. They were not bracketed, as my\nother remarks are, but on the other hand, she believes that I was the speaker.\nMy own impression is that Nelly said, \"It was a needle that ran into the\nlady,\" and that I, recognising this as an important correction of the previous\nstatement (see above, 3) said to Miss Johnson, \" needle, not crochet hook,\" in\norder to be sure that the alteration was noted.\nI have a vague recollection of a carriage accident to the doctor\nand this is confirmed by my father, who thinks that the doctor broke his\n\f228 Mrs. A. W. Vert-all. [PART\nleg. We know of no connexion between the doctor and Linton or\nLynmouth.\nThe \" cakes \" and the \" mezzo soprano \" are not intelligible to me.\n(6) Here there appears to be a transition on the part of Nelly from my\nmother to my mother-in-law, who is undoubtedly described later on. I did\nnot detect this at the time, and as the statements made were for the most\npart not appropriate to my mother, I was, as will be seen from my remarks,\nvainly endeavouring to clear up the situation, till the vivid reproduction of\na facial gesture and the description of the apron, etc., suggested to me that\nthe old lady now being described was my mother-in-law, who is in no way\nconnected with the hair cross, which was the only object held by the sensi\ntive. I comment in detail on the various points :\nMy mother-in-law's first child, a boy, died at the age of six weeks ; my\nmother never had a son.\nMy child Helen has only a faint recollection of my mother-in-law, but a\nperfectly clear one of my mother.\nThe remark about the Frenchman is indefinite, but perhaps refers to my\nmother.\nDr. Arthur Myers knew my mother very slightly, but my mother-in-law\nvery fairly well. See below, notes on Sitting 3, No. 7.\nNeither lady took any interest in the boat race, though if \"Cambridge\"\nwere substituted for \" boat race,\" the remarks would be true of my mother-\nin-law.\nThe description of the cough is appropriate to my mother-in-law, and the\nreproduction by the sensitive of a certain way of moving the lips was\nstartlingly characteristic' of her. The silk apron I have often seen her wear,\nand I know, from her, that it had belonged to her mother. It fastened with\nan elastic and button round the waist, and the movement of the sensitive's\nhands as she went through the action of taking off an apron and folding it\nwas characteristic. So too was the voice and gesture as she spoke of the\nwhite stockings. My mother-in-law has more than once referred half\napologetically to her preference for white Blockings, which she wore long\nafter they had ceased to be fashionable. I know of no velvet boots worn by\nmy mother-in-law ; the mention of them recalled my own mother. (See\ncomment on Sitting 4, No. 9, Oct. 5, 1899.)\nSITTING 3.

[PART\nComments on the above account of Sitting 3.\n(1) When I thought over the statements of July 27th I came to thf\nconclusion that at least two definite allusions had been made, to my French\nconnexion and to my mother-in-law, and so I decided to take with me to the\nnext sitting on July 28th objects representing both these. Nothing had\nbeen said about my bringing any fresh objects on the morning of July 28th.\nJust before going out to see Mrs. Thompson, I asked my daughter for the\ncoral neglig6 which was given to her by her grandmother during the latter's\nlast illness, and I took this in a bag. I also wore a ring which had been\ngiven by my French grandfather to his wife. I had my mind fixed on the\nidea that if the information of the sensitive were in any way derived from\nmy mother-in-law she would be sure to think of Helen and her gift, so that\nthe first remark of Nelly certainly bore directly upon my own thought*,\nthough the object which she mentioned was not correctly named.\n(2) The statements concerning my child's clothes are true. My mother-in-\nlaw did not like the low-necked frocks which the baby wore, and used to\npull up the under vest to cover the baby's bare neck. She also often half-\nlaughingly remonstrated with me for not letting the child wear the usual\nwoollen \" bootikins.\" Helen always wore silk shoes and stockings, sometimes\nblue, but more often white.\nMy child had the usual round-backed high chair, but I have no recollection\nof any special cushion. I have no remembrance of my mother-in-law doing\nembroidery, though no doubt she did, like all her generation.\n(3) There was no servant called Laura, nor can the French gentleman Iw\nidentified. The town in question, Brighton, has very white roads, a constant\nsource of annoyance to me, and so very distinctive to me of the town.\n(4) There is a portrait of my mother-in-law, at her house in Brighton,\nwhich Mrs. Thompson has never entered. The dress is black, but in alternate\nstripes of velvet and satin, producing the effect of a pattern if one looks\nclose. There is a lace collar, and the hair is parted and worn down. There\nis no chain in the picture, but my mother-in-law constantly wore a long fine\n<jold chain, and I thought at the time that this was shown in the portrait.\nHelen has a similar, but less fine, gold chain worn by my mother, and shown\nin a portrait of her which is in my father's house.\n(5) The curtains in my mother-in-law's bedroom were buff. Philip is not\nii name in either family. The general description that follows seems appro\npriate to my mother-in-law, especially the reference to the pleasure that her\ngrandchild's \" cleverness \" would give her. No diaper or other pinafore was\nmade by my mother-in-law for my child, as far as we can remember, but\nshe did once give the child a Holland pinafore which the nurse thought\nclumsy and uncomfortable, and which was only worn when the giver was\nlikely to see it.\n\fXLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 233\n(6) The general description of the lady is correct ; my husband used to\nsketch years ago, but no \" exercise book \" can be found. There are two\nbureaux in the room where my mother-in-law's portrait stands, but no globe.\nA gazogene globe stood for many years immediately below the portrait of\nmy mother. My mother had a circular fur cloak.\n(7) Nothing is known of a \" stupid parson \" ; there was no canoe-shaped\nknitting basket, nor plaid spectacle case.i I have seen my mother-ill-law\nwearing woollen cuffs with beads worked into them.\nThe difficulty in getting her to understand the situation, and the necessity\nthat she should understand before acting, struck me as characteristic. So\ndid the intervention of Dr. Arthur Myers ; I have often heard him explain\ning to my mother-in-law the work and aims of the S.P.R. and the effect of\ncertain experiments.\nI was in the country on September 14th, and did not see Mrs. Thompson\nagain till October 5th ; she then wore no velvet or sailor collar. She had\na sailor collar to a dress she was wearing the next autumn, 1900, at the\nsitting of September 14th ; this sitting was arranged at very short notice.\nA suggestion had been made by Nelly in May, 1900, that Miss Harrison and I\nshould sit on September 9th, Miss H.'s birthday. This day proved to be a\n.Sunday, and so the appointment was made for the nearest day, September\n8th. Miss Harrison, however, was not back in England by this date, and I\nhad a sitting (No. 18) with another sitter. I did not hear till after\nthe 8th that Miss Harrison was returning on the 13th, and at once arranged\nfor the first possible day, the 1 4th.\n(8) Helen never had a brooch given her by my mother-in-law. I did not\ngo \"North \" before my next journey ;< abroad,\" which was in June, 1900, nor\nhave I been since.\n(9) When Nelly spoke of some one with \" sandy hair,\" I at once thought of\na friend of my daughter's called Lilian, whom she had seen, and she at once\nadded, \" not like Lilian.\"\nThere was no one with reddish hair in my house on July 28th. But tin-\nnext day, when I told my daughter what Nelly had said, she stated that she\nhad been expecting a visit from a friend who answers to the description ;\nhaving reddish, sandy hair, worn up, uuder a wide hat, and freckled hands.\nThe girl did not come to the house.\n(10) For the \" message,\" see below (notes on No. 5).\n'A relative of Miss Johnson's who had recently died had possessed such a\nbasket as here described ; also bead cuffs and a plaid spectacle case. \u2022\n\f234 Mrs. A.

I was about to take them out of their envelope, when she said]\n\"No, give me one, only, in the envelope.\" (I took out one without choosing\nand gave her the other, folded inside the envelope.

The brooch was of an old-\nfashioned design, and had, I knew, come from some other owner to the aunt,\nbut neither my daughter nor I knew who that previous owner was. The\nbrooch is in the shape of a gold knot and pendant locket, with blue enamel\nand pearl, and there is hair in the pendant. At the time of the sitting\nI knew that my daughter and a cousin had been given this brooch and a\nring by their aunt, and that the cousin, being the elder, had chosen the ring.\nIt will be seen that Nelly gave a correct description of the brooch before\nshe saw it, while I held it in a folded envelope ; there is a stone let in, and\nthe brooch is in the shape of an earring.\nThe \"lady of the brooch\" is too indefinite a phrase for identification ; it\nmight describe (1) the aunt who gave it, (2) the lady from whom she\nreceived it. This lady who, as I subsequently found, was not a relative, has\nbeen dead some years. The giver of the brooch had had no recent sore throat.\nFor further remarks about the brooch, see below on 3.\n(2) A friend of mine, not a relative, had had the operation described in\nthe summer of 1899. I did not at the time know which side had been\noperated on, but found on enquiry that it was the left. She had made a\nvery fair recovery at the time of the sitting, but there has been further\ntrouble since.i\n(3) For the red stuff round the bed, see comment on Sitting 3.\nMy name is Margaret, and I always use Margaret in my signature, but no\none calls me by that name. My grandmother (father's mother) used to call\nme \"Margaret\" to me and to my mother, as she thought the name \"May\"\nfoolish.\nWhen I told my daughter of Nelly's statement about the similar brooch\nshe said that was so, and that the reason why the cousin chose the ring and\nnot the brooch was that she already possessed a brooch in design precisely\nlike the one in question, but with garnets for its decoration. The brooch\nhas no connexion with any member of our family.\ni For obvious reasons I am unable to give details here, but I may state that the\nsubject was introduced again at the next sitting by Nelly, in connexion with the\nname of a lady who is a common friend of myself and the lady who had been ill,\nand that on this occasion Nelly repeated the suggestion of further suffering, and\ncoupled it with a Christian name, closely resembling that of the invalid lady.\n\f238 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART\n(4) The two letters which I had taken were from my mother to me, dated\n20th and 23rd October, 1876. They were selected by me on the day before\nthe sitting, from a packet of letters kept in a cardboard box in my husband's\nstudy. The particular parcel from which these letters came had been in the\nbox only a few hours ; since 1894 they had been in the left-hand drawer of\nmy table in the study, and before that for many years they had been in\nan old-fashioned writing desk. I selected these two out of several of about\nthe same date, written by my mother on her return to Brighton from\nCambridge in October, 1876. She was not well at Cambridge, and was ill\nwhen she reached home. I did not know which of the two letters I had\ngiven to Mrs. Thompson.\nThus it is true that the lady who wrote was not in good health ; the only\nallusion to the writer's health was in the inner pages, which Mrs. Thompson\ncould not possibly have seen.\nThe words \" I am sure \" occur in the letter, on the outside sheet, at the\nbottom of the envelope, upside down. They must have been touched by\nMrs. Thompson's fingers, but they could not have been seen unless the\nenvelope had been partly opened. I saw no attempt to do thia, and she\ncertainly did not bring the envelope near her other hand.\nThe remarks about the \" lady \" are unintelligible, and I do not know to\nwhat lady they were supposed to apply.\nMy husband and I have not been to Yorkshire or Lancashire since\n1896.\n(5) My mother's mother was, I think, 87 when she died. She lived in the\nhouse with us as children and was very fond of us. She was less tall than\nmy mother.\n(6) My husband was 48. Nothing is known of the misfortune or scandal ;\nmy husband had no talk with any friend during the sitting.\n(7) Naturally my mother accompanied me to a dentist more than once\nduring my childhood.\n(8) It was not true that Greek was fresh to my daughter. She was\nlearning a new subject, but it was not Greek (see Sitting 2, No. 2).\n(9) Henry is the name of my husband's father. There seems here a con\nfusion between my mother and my mother-in-law.

My\nhusband had mentioned this to me, but neither of us could recall any\naccident. I did not at the time of the sitting know which shoulder showed\nthe old strain ; my husband is not sure, but thinks it was the right.\nNothing is known of the cap described.\nHenry is the name of my husband's father (see note on Sitting 4, No. 9).\nMy husband lectures on classical subjects at Cambridge, and wears of course\na black gown ; he was suffering from rheumatism at the time of the sitting,\nand exercise was naturally a difficulty. He has never been fond of boating,\nhe does write books, and he did know Mr. Gurney, not only at Cambridge ;\nhe used to see him at Brighton as well as at Cambridge, and stayed with\nhim in Ireland at the house of a common friend.\nThe description of the room with wooden walls, etc., suggests the hall at\nTrinity, which is shown to visitors, and is likely to have been seen by Mrs.\nThompson when she stayed in Cambridge in July, 1899.\n(2) My unmarried name was Merrifield ; my mother was not interested\nin the work of the S.P.R.\nHelen is the name of our only child ; it will be seen that the name of\nWillgar has been used of the owner of the glove, and that he is seen to be\nconnected with my maiden name, unknown as far as I know to Mrs. Thomp\nson, and with my child's Christian name, certainly known to Mrs. Thompson.\n(3) My second child, a girl, was born in September, 1888, and would\ntherefore have been eleven years old. She died before learning to speak.\nIt may be of interest in this connexion to note that an aunt of my husband's\n\u2014who seems to be referred to later in this sitting (see below, No. 4)\u2014always\nspoke of the nephews' children by their father's name as \" little Arthurs,'i\n\"little Toms,\" etc.\n(4) My husband had a dark gray overcoat, but there was no ticket in the\npocket when I looked on my return to Cambridge.\nThese remarks seem to show a further step in the identification of \" Mr.\nWillgar.\" My name is Margaret ; and Verrall and Barrett are certainly\nnames of analogous type.

By\nTH. FLOURNOY (Extrait des Archives de Psychologie de la Suisse Romande,\nVol. I., No. 2, p. 101-255, Geneva, 1902.)\nThe readers of these Proceedings will remember the account which Mr.\nMyers gave in Part XXXVIII. (Vol. xv., pp. 395-415) of a remarkable\ncase of \" Pseudo-possession,\" to wit, the observations by Professor Flournoy on\nthe mediumship of \" Mlle. Helene Smith \" in his book Des Indes a la planhe\n3fars. The present article is the continuation of the observations there\ngiven, and indeed, as far as Professor Flournoy is concerned, probably its\nconclusion. For the great success of his book directed so much attention\nto \"Mile. Smith\" that a wealthy American lady came to see her, was\nconvinced of the spiritist interpretation of her phenomena, and endowed\nher so generously that she can now devote herself entirely to the cultivation\nof her psychic gifts. The example thus set is a notable one and may\nperhaps be found to indicate the right solution of the difficult problem\nof how to extend social support to the curious personalities, whom, for lack\nof a better name, we call \"mediums\" or \"psychics.\" That in the abstract\nthey deserve such support may be admitted. They are exceedingly rare,\nrarer probably than opera singers. And they are psychologically very\ninteresting, more so perhaps than psychology professors, who at all events\nare common enough. If then we endow psychologists, why should we\nnot endow \"mediums\" for them to study? That the current methods of\npaying them, practically \"by results,\" are crude and unsatisfactory is admitted\non all hands. They maximize the temptations to fraud and overwork, and\nminimize the opportunities for systematic study. Nor can any real advance\nment be hoped for from unpaid amateurs. For amateur work, though it\nmay be good enough to start with, also puts obstacles of its own in the\nexperimenter's way and is too capricious aud inefficient to serve in the long\nrnn. Hence it will be interesting to watch the effect of the experiment\nmade with \" Mlle. Smith.\"\nNot that too much must be expected of a first experiment. Indeed the\nauguries are not all favourable scientifically. For apparently one of the\nresults of the improvement in \"Mlle. Smith's\" position has been a com\n\f246 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART\nplete rupture with Professor Flournoy. The publication of his book, he tells\nus, severely strained their relations, partly because \" Mlle. Smith \" then for\nthe first time realized how completely the case for a spiritist interpretation\nof her phenomena was explained away by the professor, and partly because\nshe conceived herself to be \" insulted \" by the ordinary ignorance and flip\npancy of the newspaper reviews. In view of the fact that only Professor\nFlournoy's strong testimony to her integrity rendered remarkable many\nof her performances which could easily have been simulated by fraud, the\ncritics' insinuations should not, perhaps, have been regarded as unnatural.\nWhen, however, \"Mile. Smith\" realized that these were only the draw\nbacks to fame, this phase of estrangement seems to have worn off. Then\ncame her benefactress and carried her over wholly into the spiritist\ncamp.\nNow that personally a medium should prefer the spiritist interpretation\nis natural enough. It is ever so much more flattering to be regarded\nas communicating with the spirits of the departed than to be con\nsidered subject to fits of \" somnambulism with glossolaly.\" And in \" Mile.\nSmith's\" case, the spiritist interpretation was unusually romantic. To\nreduce the ex-Ranee Simandini of Chandraghiri, the ex-Queen of France,\nthe protegee of discarnate Cagliostro, the recipient of telepathic communi\ncations from trusty correspondents throughout the solar system, to a mere\ndreamer of dreams constructed by an ill-regulated sub-consciousness must\nbe painful to the least sensitive vanity, and it is not in the least surprising\nthat Professor Flournoy should have to confess (p. 115) that \" Mlle. Smith\"\nis now \" profoundly irritated against science and the scientists and only\ndesires to have nothing more to do with professors.\" Similar feelings are\nwidely spread among spiritists and even among the general public, and\ntheir growth is not wholly unreasonable. But \"Mlle. Smith\" would\nnevertheless do well to remember that there are professors and professors,\nand that in M. Flouruoy she has had to do with one of the most sincere and\nopen-minded of the tribe. She should remember also that her own fame\nand importance in the world at large rest almost wholly upon his testi\nmony, and that there is nothing to show that her present friends are willing\nor able to keep such a record of her performances as will have the slightest\ninfluence on the judgment of reasonable men.\nAt present, then, the case stands and falls with Professor Flouruoy's\naccount of it, even though it is professedly more imperfect as a record of\nher later developments than of her earlier exhibitions. Judging by the\nmaterial which was accessible to him, Professor Klouruoy decides that\nnothing substantially new has been produced, and (charitably) supposes\nthat this may have been due to the influence of his own \" suggestion \" and\nthat in different surroundings \"Mile. Smith's\" mediumship may develop\nin new directions. Consequently his chapters on \" Leopold \" the \" spirit-\nguide,\" on the \" planetary \" languages, on the Indian pre-existence, and on\nthe \" royal cycle \" are composed of replies to criticisms and supplementary\nchronicles and explanations.\n\fXLIV.] Review. 247\nTo take these remarks in order. In the chapter on \" Leopold,\" Professor\nFlournoy relates several further instances of useful warnings, which he\ninterprets as sub-conscious inferences, and so long as it is impossible to\nassign any limits to the powers of this aubliminal consciousness, it is clear\nthat nothing of this sort, however surprising, can be affirmed to lie beyond\ntheir scope.\nUnder the head of planetary wanderings, there seems at first more to\nmention. Professor Flournoy quotes extensively from the elaborate philo\nlogical study of the \"Martian\" (pseudo-) language by Professor Victor\nHenry of Paris, which gives a (conjectural) derivation of almost the whole\nof its vocabulary. \" Ultramartian,\" which had just begun to appear in\nDet Indes, has received a further development. Professor Flournoy gives\nspecimens not only of the language (distinguished by the preponderance\nof K and P and T), but of the writing (composed of ideograms\u2014in accord\nance with the backward condition of this ill-starred planet), and of the\nscenery. These latter illustrations appeal not only to the eye, but also to\nthe sense of the ludicrous (especially the \" Ultramartian \" sheep (dog?) on\np. 160), but on the whole these pictures are simply childish. In addition we\nare afforded a glimpse of \" Uranian \" (language and script), which is remark\nable for its preference for A, O, L and T, and hear rumours of several\n\"Lunar\" languages\u2014as to the authenticity of which Mr. H. G. Wells does\nnot yet seem to have been consulted.\nThe new material with regard to the Hindu pre-existence of \" Mlle.\nSmith\" consists almost wholly of descriptions of visions, and adds nothing\nverifiable to the historical data previously given. On the other hand, the\ninternal contradictions of the story, regarded as history, come into stronger\nrelief. Thus the Sanscrit experts all agree that the trance-utterances are\nsolely Sanscrit imperfectly reproduced, but without admixture of other\ntongues ; that Indian women, neither at the time alleged (1401) nor at\nany other, spoke Sanscrit ; that the language of the place alleged (Kanara)\nwas, and is, Dravidian, and utterly different from Sanscrit ; that it is\nincredible that a Mussulman Arab chief would marry his daughter to a\nHindu prince practising suttee. And Professor Macdonell's acute remark\nthat the phrases attributed to Simandini looked very like examples from\na Sanscrit grammar, looks rather lurid in the light of the discovery (p.\n212) that one of the spiritist friends of \" Mlle. Smith,\" in whose study\nshe often gave seances, had in this very room a Sanscrit grammar con\ntaining some of the most characteristic words used by \" Mile. Smith \" '\nAs against all this, the apparent authenticity of the Hindu song (Det Indes,\np. 301-2) can hardly be said to weigh seriously.\nOf the \" Royal Cycle,\" Professor Flournoy is not able to give many\nadditional rehearsals, although he has heard that when \"Mlle. Smith\"\nwas taken to Paris, \" reminiscences \" of her life as Marie-Antoinette came\nupon her with great force. An episode which he does describe, with the\n\" control \" by Dr. Barthez, the physician of the Due d'Orlfians (not of\nPhilippe-Egalite, however, but of his father), seems to suffer from serious\n\f248 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART\nhistorical anachronisms, and there is no similarity between his authentic\nhandwriting and that produced by \" Mlle. Smith.\"\nSome further remarks on the Burnier-Chaumontet signatures, which in\ntheir way seemed perhaps the most striking evidence in favour of a\nspiritist interpretation produced by \" Mlle. Smith,\" tend considerably\nto diminish the difficulty of explaining them by latent memory, while\nthere has been no multiplication of similar feats to tell on the other side.\nOn the whole, therefore, it is not surprising that Professor Flournoy\nshould find that he has nothing to retract and little to add to his previ\nously-expressed judgment ou his subject, and that he continues to regard\nthe case of \" Mlle. Smith \" as decidedly on a lower plane of scientific\ninterest from those of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson (p. 252). Adherents\nof the S.P.R. will read with pleasure and approval his concluding remarks\n(p. 254) on the deplorable chasm which exists between the \" orthodox \"\npsychologists, who are devoid of interest in supernormal phenomena, and\nthe enthusiasts who have the desire to know, but are devoid of all\nscientific method, and on the services of the S.P.R. in attempting to\nbridge this chasm.\nII.\nI have so far aimed only at reproducing Professor Flournoy's conclusions\nconcerning what all who are interested in Psychical Research must feel he\nhas, by his care, lucidity and candour, made an epoch-making case. But for\nthis very reason it seems appropriate to improve the occasion to discuss, by\nway of criticism, or perhaps in lieu thereof, some of the general issues he\nhas raised.\n(1) lu the first place there is the question of whether he did well to reject\nthe spiritist interpretation so decisively. It is not that I would dispute that\non the evidence of this case he is fully entitled to do so. But the history of\nscience is full of examples of incompatible theories, each of which, iu\nthe given state of knowledge, seemed to supply alternative explanations of\nthe facts of nearly equal value. And though in his last chapter Pro\nfessor Flournoy shows that he possesses the true logical doctrine with\nregard to the investigation of anomalous facts, one sometimes feels that\nsomewhat less confidence in hazarding anti-spiritist explanations would not\nhave been unbecoming. He sometimes seems almost to forget what a big\nhypothesis, what an asylum, ignorantiae, the subliminal consciousness still is.\nI cannot feel that there is so much to choose between it and spiritism as\nProfessor Flournoy supposes. He regards the latter as an explanation ignoti\nper ignotiw (p. 130)\u2014as indeed it has often been taken to be, not\nonly by spiritists. But in reality the appeal to spirits, though it may\nbe perverted into a pseudo-explanation, is intrinsically an appeal to per\nsonal being* with motives and minds acting analogously to our own\nand pro tanto knowable, and calculated, roughly, to render knowable\nthe phenomena it deals with, while as soon as we sink below the level\nof clear consciousness, we enter a land of darkness where all analogies\n\fxi.iv.J Review. 249\nfail us and where anything may happen. This has always been the\nsecret reason why academic psychology has fought so shy of anything\nthat savours of the \" unconscious \" : and so, if I were an \" orthodox \"\npsychologist, I should find it hard to choose between two equally distasteful\ntheories. But I am sure that a \"subliminal self\" capable of the astounding\nretentivenessand marvellous creativeness which Professor Flournoy demands\nfor \" Mlle. Smith's\" would be quite as efficient in destroying my \"dogmatic\ntorpor\" as the boldest extravagances of spiritism. But as I do not feel\npledged to the glib application of a few trite psychological formulas as the a\npriori explanation of all the facts that await investigation, I prefer to preserve\nan open mind with regard to any explanation that may be propounded, and\nto leave myself free to hold that the truth will probably turn out to be far\ngreater and more complicated than is as yet anticipated by the rival theorists.\nIn other words, there does not seem to be any pressing need at present to\ncome to a decision ; we may hold any theory of these perplexing phenomena,\nif we do so in a tentative and methodological sense, and may use the rivalry\nof the conflicting theories with a view to sharpening our observation of the\nfacts.\n(2) And this brings me to my second point, viz., whether Professor\nFlournoy has done full justice to the methodological advantages of spiritism\nas a \u2022working theory. The present case seems to show that the triumph of\nthe scientific explanation (allowing the subconscious self theory to be more\nscientific) can be overdone in practice. For it is evidently a mistake to\nalienate one's subject, and it is conceivable (though not perhaps very\nprobable) that if Professor Flournoy had contented himself with a less\ncomplete \" explanation \" of \" Mlle. Smith's \" performances, he might still be\npermitted to observe her developments. But quite apart from such personal\nquestions, it seems possible that the spiritist interpretation is per se more\nstimulating and encouraging, and therefore more likely to bring out the full\npowers of the \" medium.\" It is naturally depressing to be told that you\nare an ill-balanced person, whose normal life is perturbed by irruptions of\nsubliminal abnormality ; it is inspiriting to hold that you are a chosen\nchannel of communication with other worlds. Whatever, therefore, the\nnature of the phenomena may ultimately turn out to be, it seems probable\nthat the latter interpretation will make the most of them, and will\nactually produce more of them ; and this would eeem to be one of the\nelements of truth in the constant insistence on \" faith \" as a condition of\nsuccess in such investigations.\nTranslated from the concrete into terms of abstract logic, the point in\ndicated seems to be the possibility of a divergence between the methods of\nproof and of ditcovery. Proof consists in the progressive assimilation of the\nnew truth by the old, in the establishment of their connexion and systematic\ncoherence. But it does not follow that we shall also discover most by always\ninsisting on this, and by never advancing beyond what can be strictly\n\" proved.\" The discoverer, in other sciences as well as in geography, may\nhave to be like an explorer of a terra incognita, who must push ahead by\n\f250 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART\nwhatever means are handy. In so doing, he doubtless must run risks and\noften cut himself adrift from his base in established principles. He has \"faith,\"\nof course, that his communications can ultimately be restored, but his proxi\nmate aim is the discovery of novelty, and not its digestion. He should\nbe more solicitous, therefore, not to let anything new escape him, than to\nsecure his retreat into the cosmos which science has already set up. In this\nmanner, then, it may be methodologically expedient to use hypotheses whose\nultimate validity may appear very doubtful. Whether, on that account,\n\" Mile. Smith \" will do better under exclusively spiritist auspices remains to\nbe seen. For while the \"faith\" of her spiritist friends in the possibility\nof obtaining the sort of evidence they demand may render its production\npossible, by stimulating the medium, or in other as yet unknown ways,\nno amount of \" faith \" can by itself be a substitute for trustworthy recording\nand intelligent experimentation, and it seems too probable that the oppor\ntunities of obtaining further instruction from \"Mlle. Smith\" will be thrown\naway, unless she comes once more under the supervision of a sympathetic\nexpert of the type, say, of Dr. Hodgson.\n(3) The next issue to raise is perhaps that of whether, in point of fact, Pro\nfessor Flournoy has completely explained \" Mlle. Smith's \" case on his theory.\nHe appears to think that he has, and with two reservations I should agree\nwith him. The first reservation, as I have already indicated, ia that the\nfacts are at present in such a condition that, like every growing science,\nPsychical Research admits of a good deal of indetermination, and a number\nof theories may apparently cover the facts, while nevertheless, they may all\nbe wrong or very partially right. The second is that even though \" Mlle.\nSmith's \" performances are all built up out of her (subliminal) memories, yet\nthe construction out of these of coherent \"dreams\" requires a principle of\nselection.i No doubt we are all familiar with the operation of such a\nprinciple in ordinary dreams ; but then the psychology of dreams stands\nitself badly in need of an elucidation which it would, no doubt, long ago\nhave received but for the psychologists' horror of what seemed abnor\nmal and of no great practical importance. And it is further remarkable\nthat this \" selecting principle ''should always mimic with such extraordinary\ncloseness \"proofs\" of spiritism (and in this case of reincarnation). This one\nmight be tempted to explain as due to the greater interest of the spiritist\ninterpretation alluded to above, were it not that the phenomenon persistently\noccurs also in cases where the \"medium \" rejects that interpretation.2 If I\nwere concerned, therefore, to bolster up the spiritist view, I should suggest\nthat the facts looked as though an intelligence were at work that was\ndesirous of conveying the impression of coming from another world, but yet,\nas a rule, found itself unable to express anything but what had once passed\ni Professor Flournoy just touches on this difficulty (top of p. 243).\n'E.g. in Mrs. Piper's case, and in a case of automatic writing in which my\nbrother, Mr. F. N. Schiller, acted as \"medium.\"\u2014See Proceedings, vol. iv.,\np. 216.\n\fXLIV.] Review. 251\nthrough the medium's mind, and therefore was reduced to ransacking\nit for the most improbable and recondite memories, in order to simulate\nan extramundane origiii. And such a procedure might perhaps even be\nmade to seem pardonable and psychologically plausible in a \"spirit\" seek\ning to express its continued identity under the restrictions of an alien\norganism.\n(4) And this again suggests the final reflection that very little has really\nbeen done in the spiritist camp in the way of psychological elaboration of\ntheir working principle. One cannot read Professor Flournoy's replies to\nthe spiritist criticisms of his book without being greatly struck by the\nargumentative weakness of the latter.\nThe fact seems to be that spiritists as yet have hardly a notion of the\nresources which modern psychology and philosophy may yield them for\nthe defence of their favourite thesis, and do not realize how hollow is the\nground on which the \"scientific\" materialism of their opponents stands.\nMaterialism has the support (broadly) of our existing academic personnel, of\nthe customary ways of common-sense, and of the inertia which shrinks\nfrom translating speculation into experimentation. But all these things are\ncapable of being altered, if a really strong and genuine desire to know can\nbe aroused with regard to these subjects.\nBut when it is and when the spiritist theory is advocated by one who\nreally kiiows where the land lies, it is safe to say that no one will be blind\nto the absurdity of taking \" Mlle. Smith's \" \" planetary \" excursions literally.\nFor the notion of a relation between our world and an \" other,\" which should\ntake the form of one in physical space (i.e. in the space of our world), will\nthen be seen to possess precisely the same crudeness as the ancients' fancy,\nthat by descending the crater of Avernus one might go straight to the\nhouse of Hades, and that by sailing westwards beyond the Pillars of\nHercules one might reach the Islands of the Blest.\nFrom the very nature of the case, the relation between two worlds (i.e.\nmodes of experience) must be of a psychological order. The alleged\n\" other \" world cannot lie north, east, west, or south of ours. It must be a\nstate of consciousness, or a mode of experience, into which we pass from\nthat constituting our \" world,\" and from which we can, perhaps, repass. In\ncomprehending its relation to ours, therefore, the guiding analogies must be\npsychological. In other words, the relation must be conceived as analogous\nto that of a \" dream \" world to a \" real \" world,\u2014without, of course, pre\njudging the question of which is to be regarded as the \" reality \" and which\nas the \" dream.\" That question can only be decided by the comparison of the\ncontents of the two \" worlds,\" and (since we ex hypothesi start from our\nworld) by the value of the revelations of the \" other \" world for our life.\nJudged by such canons, the grotesque and unmeaning childishness of\n\"Mlle. Smith's\" planetary dreams will at once settle their interpretation,\nand dispose of them without any superfluous censure of the poverty of\nscientific imagination and the obvious scientific ignorance which they\ndisplay. F. C. S. SCHILLER.\nR\n\f252 F. N. Hales. [PART\nFact and Fable in Psychology. BY JOSEPH JASTROW, Professor of Psy\nchology in the University of Wisconsin. (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston\nand New York, 1900.)\nProfessor Jastrow's book is a collection of popular essays upon a variety of\npsychological topics. Many of them were written a number of years ago,\nand are now reprinted from the various magazines in which they first saw\nthe light.i Most of the essays, we are told, have been submitted to a critical\nrevision, and brought as far as possible up to date. Two essays to which we\nwill mainly devote our remarks,\u2014\"The Problems of Psychical Research\"\nand \" The Logic of Mental Telegraphy,\"\u2014bear only a general resemblance to\ntheir former appearance. In others we are glad to see that some errors of\ndetail have been corrected. Thus, in the entertaining essay on the Psychology\nof Spiritualism, in which Prof. Jastrow, borrowing largely from the results\nof the Seybert Commission and of the S.P.R. investigations, acutely diagnoses\nSpiritualism as a social disease, there occurs the tale of the exposed medium\nwho confessed that \" the first seance I held after it became known to the\nRochester people that I was a medium, a gentleman from Chicago recognised\nhis daughter Lizzie in me, after I had covered my small moustache with a\npiece of flesh-coloured cloth and reduced the size of my face with a shawl I\nhad purposely hung in the back of the cabinet.\" The story is so good that\nit is sure to earn a mythical immortality. Prof. Jastrow does hot give any\nreferences, and refrains from telling ua whence he got the story and who\nwas the medium. As a matter of fact the tale is told by D. D. Home in\nLights and Shadows of Spiritualism (p. 405). He \" copied from an American\nnewspaper the confession of a detected trickster, who had been caught in\nthe act of imposture while giving seances at Rochester, N.Y.\" In accordance\nwith the rule observed by him throughout Lights and Shadows, Mr. Home\ndid not print the name of this interesting penitent, which is represented\nonly by its initial \" J .\" 2 Curiously enough, Prof. Jastrow, in his Popular\nScience Monthly article (April, 1889), quoted the story as the confession of\n\"an exposed medium, D. D. Home,\" who was thus, for the first time, con\nvicted of imposture and trickery in Prof. Jastrow's essay. We are glad to\nsee that this singular error has not been repeated in the reprint before us.\nBut he is as careful not to give any authority for the major part of his facts\nin the reprint of his essay as he was in the original article. That any one\nshould let slip such a mistake who had, however cursorily, glanced through\nLights and Shadows of Spiritualism, is not easy to believe. To the student\ni We transcribe from the preface their chronological order : The Dreams of the\nBlind (Jan., 1888), The Psychology of Deception (Dec., 1888), The Psychology of\nSpiritualism (April, 1889), The Problems of Psychical Research (June, 1889), The\nNatural History of Analogy (1891), A Study of Involuntary Movements (April\nand Sept., 1892), The Logic of Mental Telegraphy (October, 1895), Hypnotism\nand its Antecedents (February, 1896), Mental Prepossession and Inertia (April,\n1897), The Mind's Eye (1899), The Modern Occult (1900).\n5 See The Gift of D. D. Home, by Madame D. D. Home, pp. 210, 211.\n\fxi.iv.] Review. 253\nof the Proceedings of the S.P.R., on the other hand, much of Mr. Jastrow's\nmaterial has a familiar look. Why does he not take the trouble to acknow\nledge his indebtedness to the obvious sources ? He admits, with a generosity\nwhich all his colleagues do not share, that the publications of the S.P.R.\nare not wholly devoid of value. Why does he not reveal the extent of the\nbenefit he has derived from them 1 This plain duty was all the more in\ncumbent upon him that he chooses what he finds convenient and leaves the\nrest. The result is wholly misleading. Such an attitude cannot be too\nseverely condemned. Methods which custom allows an advocate to use\nwould be morally reprehensible in a judge, aud canons of evidence pass\nmuster in a party pamphlet which have no place in a scientific memoir.\nIn what light then are we to view this book ? \" The present collection\nof essays is offered as a contribution towards the realisation of a sounder\ninterest in, and a more important appreciation of, certain problems upon\nwhich psychology has an authoritative charge to make to the public jury.\nThese essays take their stand distinctively upon one side of certain issues,\nand, as determinately as the situation seems to warrant, antagonise contrary\npositions ; they aim to oppose certain tendencies and to support others ; to\nshow that the sound and profitable interest in mental life is in the usual\nand the normal. . . .\" In other words, Prof. Jastrow claims the right and\nassumes the responsibility of making a number of ex cathedra statements\nupon a variety of subjects, some of which he conceives have dangerously\nengrossed the public interest to the detriment of others. He wishes to\neducate the interest of the public in psychological matters. He conceives\nthat a science cannot prosper if the public take no interest in it, cannot\nthrive if it be misunderstood by the layman. It is difficult to see what the\nlayman's opinion can possibly matter on a question of pure science, or why\nthe layman should be allowed any voice whatever. To the public, science\nis revealed religion, and the savant its prophet. The layman believes on\nauthority, that is his privilege. But in what sense can he be supposed to\nform part of a jury ? On account of the public interest taken in the obscure\nand the unusual, said Prof. Jastrow in a presidential address to the American\nPsychological Association, the current conception of psychology is becoming\ndistorted, and the true interests of psychology are jeopardised by the un\nfortunate confusion of psychology with what is termed psychical research.\nNot only then is the public to decide which of two trends of scientific\n\u2022opinion is the more likely to be fruitful of results, but science is conceived\nby Prof. Jastrow to freeze and shrivel up if the indiscreet curiosity of the\nuninformed public happens to follow the wrong track. And it is in order\nto avert this unfortunate catastrophe that Prof. Jastrow delivers his charge\nto the public jury. It is, he conceives, \"particularly the obligation of the\ntorch-bearers of science to illuminate the path of progress, and to transmit\nthe light to their successors with uudiminished power and brilliancy ; the\nflame must burn both as a beacon-light to guide the wayfarer along the\npathways of science, and as a warning against the will-o'-the-wisps that\nshine seductively in the by-ways.\"\n\f254- F. N. Hales. [PAKT\nThese essays, then, would appear to subserve a double purpose. In the\nfirst place, they aim at uprooting certain pernicious beliefs widely dissemi\nnated among the magazine public. In the second place, we have a right to\ninfer, from the sentence just quoted, that they are addressed to scientific\nmen as well. But the two purposes are really one to Professor Jastrow'a\nmind. The pure light of \" the torch of science \" runs a risk of flickering-\nout, so long as the public gaze is fascinated by some more attractive \" will-\no'-the-wisp.\" Hence, to dispel popular superstitious is ipso facto to render\na service to science. This attitude of the author explains the character of\nthe book. In it Prof. Jastrow, representing a certain school of psychology,\nappears both as advocate and as judge, vindicating his own cause before a\njury which is equally unable to grasp the principles underlying either of\nthe opposing \"Tendenzen.\" As an advocate, he permits himself the use of\nrhetorical devices, and as an authoritative psychologist speaking to a popular\naudience, he assumes the right of laying down general principles without\npausing to justify them ; this unfortunate ambiguity runs through the whole\nbook, and makes the task of the critic a thankless one. In most of the-\nessays, however, it cannot lead to serious misunderstanding. Those on the\nModern Occult, on the Psychology of Spiritualism, on the Natural History of\nAnalogy, on Hypnotism, on the Psychology of Deception, etc.\u2014though they\ncannot be considered as contributions to science\u2014will certainly answer the\npurpose they were intended to fulfil. The essay on Dreams of the Blind,\non the other hand, we are very grateful to see rescued from the comparative\nobscurity of the New Princeton Review. Of the \" Experimental Investigation\nof Automatic Movements\" we shall have a word to say later on. But it\nwas hardly to be expected that any useful purpose could be served by\ndiscussing the logical status of Psychical Research and of \"Mental Tele\ngraphy\" in essays of so manifestly didactic, and so unfortunately popular a\ncharacter. Had they been mere individual expressions of opinion, there-\nwould have been all the more justification for not noticing them. But we\nhave heard them expressed before, we shall probably hear them again, and\nit may help to clear away misunderstandings if we examine and answer\nProf. Jastrow's arguments one by one. The existence of the Society for\nPsychical Research, and the growth of its problems, give rise to the ques\ntion, What attitude is to be taken to the outlying phenomena of mind ?\n\" Are they,\" asks Prof. Jastrow, \" are they outcasts, to be treated in a spirit\nof charity and forbearance? Are they the true owners of the land, the\nunjustly deposed and rightful heirs, soon to be restored to their kingdom by\na fairer and more searching examination of their title ?\" And by means of a\nseries of similar metaphors, he conjures up before the startled psychologist\na threatening mass of obscure phenomena struggling to dispossess the\nfamiliar facts of normal, waking life of their claim upon the scientist's\nattention.\nSurely no way of stating the problem could possibly be more misleading.\nIt appears to imply that there are on the one hand a certain number of\nrespectable, conservative owners of the field, and on the other hand au\n\fXLIV.] Review. 255\ninimical crowd of revolutionary malcontents ; it implies a party warfare\nwithin the republic of science, in which each party seeks its own good\nregardless of the good of the whole. Professor Jastrow appears to believe\nthat psychology may be defined by means of an absolute disjunction ; that\nit is the study of one category of phenomena to the exclusion of another\ncategory of phenomena. We have seen that he speaks of \" the unfortunate\nconfusion of psychology with what is termed psychical research,\" and that,\naccording to him, \" the spirit and attitude of psychical research towards\npsychology has been productive of harm to our profession [that of psycho\nlogist] and to the reputation which we cherish.\" Now what are, in his\nview, the essential characteristics of psychology, and what are those of\npsychical research ? Professor Jastrow has himself put the question, and\nhe finds that \" the precise status of psychical research, and its relations to\nother departments of scientific inquiry, are far from obvious.\" Surely, he\nexclaims, the problems of psychical research ought to be able to find a nook\nin so commodious a home as Psychology, individual and comparative, normal\nand abnormal ! But he soon finds an apparent differentiating characteristic :\n\" Whereas Psychology studies the recognised and explicable phases of mental\nphenomena, Psychical Research is occupied with the disputed and mysterious.\"\nAnd such a differentiation is as unwarranted as it is clearly absurd. \" The\nlegitimate problems of Psychical Research are equally and necessarily genuine\nproblems of Psychology, that require no special designation.\" Prof. Jastrow\ncomplains that psychical research \" separates a group of problems from their\nnatural habitat . . . violently transports a growth from its environment.\"\nAnd he vehemently protests against the notion \" that while the psychologist\nmay be listened to with respect and authority in one portion of his topic, the\nlayman and the member of the S.P.R. are equally or more competent to\npronounce judgments in a closely allied field.\" Surely this is once more\nthe false disjunction noticed above ! It is certain that any given psychologist,\nin so far as he has no knowledge of a special topic, is himself a layman with\nregard to that topic, and his opinion carries no sort of authority. But the\nassertion that psychology as such has no claim to meddle with psychical\nresearch, meets us for the first time in Prof. Jastrow's pages. Does he mean,\non the other hand, to imply that the psychical researcher is ignorant of\npsychology ? He is ready to admit that \" a considerable portion of the\ninfluential contributors to Psychical Research are animated by as truly\nscientific motives as labourers in any other field of psychological endeavour.\"\nHe quotes with approval Mr. Podmore ; he borrows copiously from the\ninquiries of Dr. Hodgson, of Mrs. Sidgwick, of S. T. Davey. But there are\nsome \" who subscribe to pernicious and illogical conclusions, and indirectly\neucourage a most unfortunate attitude in others.\"\nDiscussing the actual interests which give vitality to Psychical Research, he\nascribes the chief order of importance to the occult interest ; he allows that\nthere is also a psychological point of view ; he quotes with approval Mr.\nLang's \"comparative psychical research.\" But the characteristic trait of\nthe psychical researcher, the one which brands him as the pariah of science,\n\f256 F. N. Hales. [PART\nin Professor Jastrow's view, is that the psychical researcher always seeks to\nprove or to disprove something. \"As soon as he succeeds in finding a con\nsistent and commonplace explanation for a group of phenomena, his main\ncuriosity is satisfied, and he takes to pastures new.\" Very different is the\ntrue psychological interest, we are told, in Madame Blavatsky's performances,\ne.g., \"The logical scientist was quite convioced that Madame Blavatsky had\nnot discovered the means of carrying ponderables by unseen agencies iron*\nChina to Peru\" ; just as apparently the logical scientist in Professor Jastrow's-\nview does not require to study the Mrs. Piper records, still less experiment\npersonally with Mrs. Piper, in order to give a theory of the phenomena ; nor\nto wait for positive evidence before reaching the conviction that, however\nD. D. Home managed to do his tricks, he was at auy rate and most certainly an\nimpostor. The psychological problem in all these cases is a quite different\none : \" It tiikes up the inquiry as to how such marvellous pretensions came\nto be believed, by what influences conviction is formed and doctrines\nspread.\" Such is the fundamental difference of principle between psycho-\n. logist and psychical researcher, according to our author\u2014that while the\npsychologist knows there is \"nothing in it,\" without the tedium of a special\ninquiry, the psychical researcher takes the trouble to collect, evidence in\norder to have some special proof whether there is \" anything in it \" or not.\nWe protest, in the interests of psychology, against this caricature of\npsychological ideals, and in fairness to psychical research we protest no less\nstrongly against the charge of occultism insinuated by Professor Jastrow's\nphrase \"something in it.\" It is a mood which he thus characterises, not a\ndefinite logical position ; it is a mood which we detest quite as much as he\ndoes ; it is a mood which every scientist detests, because it denies the ra\u00ab ion-\nality of his pursuit. And we gladly abandon to any one's satire the idly\ncurious layman who, by a kind of Schadenfreude rejoices whenever some\nouthouse of science collapses on the heads of the masons within. Such a\nmood has nothing, however, to do with logic. The scientific conservatism\nupheld by Professor Jastrow is no less a mood, and no less foreign to logic.\nIs psychology, then, so perfect a science that we need not trouble to inves\ntigate phenomena which at first sight seem difficult to explain by the\ntheories current in any one year? Is the basis of our science, then, so\nsecure that it is mere waste of time to study facts which at first sight do not\nharmonise as perfectly as we might wish with facts already investigated ?\nDoes not the very essence of research consist in finding out whether there\nbe or be not \"something in\" a certain fact at present obscure ; in finding\nout whether this fact makes for one theory or for another ? We perfectly\nagree that some theories may be considered extra-scientific, and that the\nscientist could -not without a logical crime consent to refute or even notice\nthem. It is equally true that the question whether a theory be scientifically\nlegitimate or not is one which requires careful discussion. But we never\nbefore supposed that it was possible to assert that : \" There is no obligation\nresting upon the psychologist to make large sacrifices for the pursuit of\nill-defined residual phenomena,\" When Professor Jastrow speaks of the\n\fXLIV.] . Review. 257\n\"psychologist,\" we trust he means the \"representative of psychological\nscience\" ; for while it is certain that no one would reproach any given man\nwith not attempting a task beyond his strength, or which he is by training\nor by nature unfit to cope with, this is a purely personal matter, which does\nnot touch the logical question.\nMoreover, so far as a science is unsatisfactory and incomplete, in so\nfar must the interest of the investigator be directed towards the future\nrather than towards the past. A desire for novelty as such has nothing\nmore logical in it than a wish to keep up with the changing fashions\nof dress. But we had always thought it was the main characteristic of\na logical system, such as that of science, that so long as it was incom\nplete, no part of it could possibly be regarded as having reached a state\nof logical equilibrium. It follows that the interest in that which is\nalready known, in so far as it is imperfectly known, is a relative interest : it\nis relative to the new discoveries which will further define the significance of\nthe familiar. And the new discoveries have also a merely relative interest: it\nis relative to the already known phenomena which they further explain.\nWe are ashamed to write out these logical platitudes at length. We merely\nregret that Professor Jastrow's strictures should have made them necessary.\nHe censures the S.P.R. for that attitude which is and must be precisely the\nattitude of a young science. It is quite as true of the other branches of\nexperimental psychology as of psychical research that they are constantly\nseeking new fields ; just in the same way that they do not and cannot study\nanything else than residual phenomena. But the sting of our author's\ncensure lies perhaps in its tail. He may attach some quite special meaning\nto the term \" residual phenomena.\" He censures the S.P.E. indeed again\nand again on account of a supposed predilection for the mysterious. Perhaps\nhe means to hint, by the use of the adjective \" residual,\" that the obscure\nphenomena which there is no obligation resting upon the psychologist to\nstudy are also mysterious. We should like a definition of this word ; it is\nmost unfortunate that the writers who use it most should take least pains\nto define it. \/'Any fact or thing is mysterious, for instance, in so far as\nits properties or nature are insufficiently known ; and whether a man be\nmerely puzzled by appearances unfamiliar, or whether he be thrilled by a\nmystic emotion at their sight, the difference is entirely subjective. The\nsort of feelings aroused in a man by the solution of a logical problem does not\nalter in any degree the character of that problem.' The word mystery, like\nthe word supernatural, has no place in the dictionary of science. Either\nwill be looked for in vain in the writings of our responsible leaders.' Sub\njectively, there are those whom mystery attracts, and those whom it repels.\nBoth categories of people are, in the end, animated by the same kind of\nsuperstition. Neither has a right to censure the other, because both stand\nequally outside the pale of logic. Professor Jastrow, like Professor\nMiinsterberg, is one of those for whom the word mystery has a meaning -,\nand both alike have a personal distaste for it. But what can that possibly\nmatter to any one ? '\/Were a chemist to excuse himself from investigating\n\f258 F. N. Hales. [PART\ncertain organic substances because he could not stand the smell, we should\ndoubtless agree that it was not worth while his injuring his health. But\nwhat would be thought of him if he loudly proclaimed that the department\nhe was unfit to investigate was not fit to be investigated at all? Candour\nrequires him to recognise his own personal disability, but not even the most\nsevere moralist could expect him to publish it abroad in a series of- popular\naddresses !\nIt is then clear that to censure the S.P.R. for investigating \"residual\nphenomena\" is to make a meaningless criticism. Science cannot do anything\nelse. To censure our leaders for their predominant interest in new fields of\nresearch is equally illogical. In no science, in so far as it is incomplete, can\nany body of facts have any other than a relative value. Least of all in the\nmost backward of all sciences, psychology, is there any justification for a\nself-complacent looking backward upon regions already travelled over.\nFinally, the reproach that the objects of the S.P.R.'s studies are mysterious\nfalls back upon those who utter it, and convicts them of that very disposition\nwhich they pretended to diagnose in our leaders.\nIt is easier still to explain away Prof. Jastrow's other difficulty. Why did\nthe S.P.R. come into existence at all, and what relation do its problems bear\nto other psychological problems 1 He himself has supplied us with the\nlogical answer ; and he affects to ignore the historical reason, which was far\nmore potent twenty years ago than it is now. Recognising at one point that\nsome of the work of the S.P.R. has a certain value, he says that those\nproblems of psychical research which are legitimate are problems of\npsychology. With this we heartily agree. But when he proceeds to imply\nthat these problems ought never to have been separated from \" their natural\nhabitat,\" we can no longer follow his argument. Surely it is obvious that\none and the same science can and must be\u2014provisionally at any rate\u2014\nseparated wp into a number of special departments which may be investi\ngated each for its own sake. We might as well wonder that psychologists\nleave the study of, e.g., cases of aphasia or of psychical blindness to the care\nof medical specialists, on the ground that these pathological problems are\nproblems of psychology. As Prof. Jastrow himself .-ays : \"The division of\nthe Sciences reflects the diversity of human interests. ... It is obvious\nthat the Sciences were shaped by human needs.\" It is obvious that the\ndivision of labour in science has a practical as well as a logical ground. No\nman can be equally competent in all branches of his favourite science : that\nis the practical cause of the division. He must seek to master a group of\naffiliated problems : that is the guiding principle of the division. No one\nwho is familiar with the sort of work implied will doubt the practical\njustification of the growth of \" psychical research.\" No one can possibly\nfeign to ignore the historical reason of this growth. Had the Society for\nPsychical Research never been founded, no psychologist would ever have\ntroubled to consider even the very most elementary of its problems.\nProf. Jastrow appears to question the logical justification of the S.P.R. pro\ngramme, on the ground that its investigations are sometimes of a physical\n\fXLIV.] Review. 259\nsometimes of a physiological character. We might answer him by pointing to a\nnumber of mixed sciences\u2014to chemical physiology, or to physical chemistry ;\nwhich are but so many illustrations of the continuity of the sciences. But we\nprefer to critically examine the view of the functions and limits of psychology\nas it is implied (unfortunately not expressed) in some specially curious\npassages. The phenomena claimed to occur in the presence of spiritualistic\nmediums are by no means new. Their analogues exist in the folk-lore of\nalmost every land, from China to Peru, and from the North Pole to the\nSouth. Anthropology has always considered it as its function to trace back\na myth to its sources, to map out ihe course of the spreading belief. But it\nhas never been able to go back to the font et origo. Whether any pheno\nmenon occurred which could reasonably have given rise to the myth ; what\nrelation there was between the fact and the belief about the fact \u2014these are\nquestions which the historical method could not possibly solve. It could\nonly trace the transformations of belief, and the first term of its historical\ndeduction could but be the subjective belief, not the objective fact. The only\nmethod by which this could be studied was the experimental method. We\nhad always conceived it to be the great merit of the S.P.R. that it uncom\npromisingly adhered to the rules of scientific logic, and inaugurated the\nexperimental investigation of the modern analogues of the old phenomena.\nIf, then, it be allowed that the investigation of the growth of a myth or\nbelief is not complete until all its conditions, objective and subjective, have\nbeen discovered, it is no objection to say that the investigation of spiritualism,\nfor instance, is largely tin- business of physics, or of some science other than\npsychology or anthropology. The objection would only be cogent if it could\nbe shown that the investigation was complete at any given point. In so far\nas anthropology erected hypotheses as to the relation between a given belief\nand the fact believed in, it cannot censure psychical research for having\nsought experimental verification of such hypotheses.\nThe same argument holds of psychology with regard, e.g., to the pro\nblem of telepathy, in so far as psychology abandons the stand-point\nof absolute subjectivism. It is no doubt an instructive task to expound\nwhat used to be called the \" laws of mind,\" to trace the processes by\nwhich the various material of presentation gets woven into a complex\nwhole. Some of Professor Jastrow's expressions seem to imply that\nthe psychologist's interest begins and ends with the discovery of\nneat illustrations of the working of various mental tendencies. Thus he\nfiuds \"interesting psychological points in such diverse occupations as the\nactor's profession, in juggling, in tricks of skill, in advertising, in religious\nrevivals, etc.\" He speaks of the evidence in proof of telepathy as being\n\"capable of psychological interpretation,\" and containing \"illustrations of\nobscure and subtle mental processes.\" Does he mean that any endeavour to\npass from the subjective to the objective is extra-psychological ; that, for\ninstance, a psychological theory of colour-vision has no right to take into\naccount either physical conceptions of wave-motion or physio-chemical con\nceptions of nerve-processes ; that the sphere of psychical objects\u2014to use\n\f260 F. N. Hales. [PART\nMunsterberg's terminology\u2014can and must be completely separated from the\nsphere of physical objects ; that psychology, as a science of psychical elements\nand their laws of combination, has no right to, and no interest in, relating\nthese psychical elements to anything outside them ? Psychology, on such a\nconception, becomes individual and subjective with a vengeance. The con\nception is worth elaborating, and we readily confess that psychical research\nis not compatible with it. We could not but allow that, although psychical\nresearch offered the psychologist much interesting illustrative material, yet\nits main interest was extra-psychological. In the same way, did anthro\npology choose to adopt a standpoint of radical subjectivism, and to maintain\nit consistently, our arguments would have no force.\nBut Professor Jastrow shows no symptoms of such a consistency.\nThe principle implied on the one page is denied on the next ; and\nwe find after all that the only reason for Professor Jastrow's state\nments is that \"logical\" science is perfectly cognisant of the objective\nsignificance of this or that order of phenomena (spiritualistic, tele\npathic, etc.), i.e. that the only feature of interest about them is just the\nsubjective feature. This naturally is a matter of proof. The difference\nbetween the \" psychical researcher \" and the psychologist of Prof. Jastrow's\ntype is just that the one seeks experimental evidence where the other is\ncontent with an analogical argument. The difference of attitude is total,\nbut there is no essential difference between the two conceptions of psychology.\nIt is only from the standpoint of radical subjectivism that any exception can\nbe taken to psychical research on the ground that it calls in the aid of\nphysics or physiology, or any other science. And if that point of view be\nabandoned, psychology must go the whole length of psychi<al research. Just\nas, on the ordinary view, any other but a psycho-physical theory of, say,\ncolour-vision must be quite devoid of significance, FO with regard to halluci\nnations, including the so-called telepathic hallucinations, we cau rest satisfied\nwith none but a psycho-physical theory. The ordinary rules of inductive\nlogic will apply here as elsewhere ; and the question whether two phenomena\nA and B, which are contiguous in time, are or are not connected as cause and\neffect, admits essentially of the same kind of solution, be the phenomena\nwhat they may. We cannot allow that Prof. Jastrow has shown the guiding\nprinciples of the founders of the S.P.R. to be in any way illogical. The\nexistence of the Society can readily be justified on scientific, practical, and\nhistorical grounds. So long as its work has not been taken up by official\nlaboratories, these grounds will retain their old cogency. It is no less easy\nto show that the problems with which it has dealt, and the methods with\nwhich it has treated them, are an inevitable development of old problems\nunsatisfactorily solved, and of antiquated methods logically incomplete.\nBetween psychical research and psychology there can be no possible opposi\ntion ; and the only real danger which the tatter has to fear from the former\nis that the psychologist should misunderstand the aims and methods of the\npsychical researcher.\nWe need not examine Professor Jastrow's essay on \" The Logic of Mental\n\fXLIV.] . Review. 261\nTelegraphy \" in detail. What is new in his criticisms we have already\nanswered by implication. In the main he has repeated the arguments\nbrought forward by Herr Parish some years ago, and so completely refuted\nby Mrs. Sidgwick. When Prof. Jastrow remarks that \"it is only necessary\nto be interested in coincidences in order to discover them on all fides,\" we-\ncannot find that he contributes anything to the debate. On the one hand, a\nleading interest is necessary to the discovery of coincidences, whatever they\nmaybe,\u2014whether the botanist endeavours to find out the analogies of structure-\ncommon to various plants, or the zoologist to classify an organism hitherto\nunknown to him. And it is equally clear that such an interest tnsy to some\nextent create these very coincidences. Secondary resemblances may be\nmagnified, primary differences overlooked, mid so forth. The danger in this\nrespect is common to all scientific research alike. But if Prof. Jastrow\nmeans that a person interested in so-called telepathic hallucinations will\nmost likely notice a coincidence between a hallucination and some other\nevent, this is a question which can only be solved one way or the other by\npositive evidence. It has been examined at length in the \"Report on the\nCensus of Hallucinations,\" and we see no reason to reject the solution\ntherein reached.\nAnother kind of argument equally devoid of cogency is the following : all\nsorts of coincidences have a law-abiding character. There is a statistical\nregularity about the yearly number of births and deaths and marriages, or of\nunaddressed letters thrown into the post. \"The experience of offering an\narticle to an editor and receiving a reply to the effect that another article\ndealing with the same topic in a similar way was already awaiting the com\npositor is not unusual.\" It would be interesting, indeed, to know whether\nthe number of death-coincidences had this kind of statistical regularity, or\nwhether the number of right cases in experiments on thought-transference\nperformed under identical conditions presented a law-abiding character.\nBut this does not in the least alter the logical status of the question. If the\nnumber of right cases or the number of coincidental hallucinations were\ngreater than the theory of probability allowed for, we should nevertheless be\nobliged to draw the conclusion that some cause other than chance was in\noperation.\nWhen Prof. Jastrow goes on to consider whether the hypothesis of tele\npathy is scientifically legitimate or not, he forgets that the hypothesis has for\nthe present the smallest possible positive content, that it makes no kind of\nassumption with regard to the manner of connection of the phenomena,\u2014the\ncoincidence which it affirms to be not due to chance alone. It affirms that\na state of consciousness (a) of a subject A is connected with a state (l>) of a\nsubject B ; but whether this connection be direct or indirect, or what is the\nprecise relation between the two phenomena, these are questions which it\ncannot attempt seriously to answer. It asserts a causal relation, but dues\nnot explain the causal process. The \"telepathy-hypothesis\" should be cnn-\nsidered, therefore, as nothing more and nothing less than the statement of a\nproblem. That there is a problem we hold to have been sufficiently proved.\n\f262 F. N. Hales. [PART\nTo ask whether the data of the problem are scientifically legitimate or not\nis simply devoid of meaning. The data simply are, and science has to\nconsider them.\nBut we readily agree with Prof. Jastrow that the attitude \" which insists\nupon a detailed and exact explanation of concrete personal experiences \" is a\ndeplorable and illogical attitude at the stage which the inquiry has reached ;\nand the tendency to believe in the personal significance of events is no less to\nbe regretted. If psychical research has been misunderstood by its advei-\nsaries, its friends must bear the greater part of the blame. It is only too\nprobable that much of its popularity has been due to a love of the mysterious\nand to an interest in the peculiar on the part of the general public. It\nbehoves the S.P.R. to make clear to its supporters what its leading principles\nreally are, and to seriously consider Prof. Jastrow's words of warning :\n'Unless most wisely directed, Psychical Research is likely, by not letting\nthe right hand know what the left hand is doing, to foster the undesirable\npropensities of human nature as rapidly as it antagonises them. Like\nindiscriminate almsgiving, it has possibilities of affording relief, and of\nmaking paupers at the same time.\"\nLack of space forbids more than a very cursory notice of the most important\ncontribution to psychology contained in the volume,\u2014\" The Dreams of the\nBlind.\" The general fact that \"the mode of functioning of a brain-centre\ndepends largely upon its initial education, but that, this education once\ncompleted, the centre can maintain its function, though deprived of sense-\nstimulation \" was well worth illustrating by the comparative method. There\nappears to be a critical period, which both Heermann (1838) and Jastrow\nplace between the fifth and seventh years. Persons who go blind before the\nfifth year have, as a rule, no visual dreams. Persons who go blind after\ntheir seventh year have usually visual dreams. If blindness occurs between\nthe fifth and seventh years, the preservation of the visualising power depends\nupon the degree of development of the individual. ''We could have wished\nthat the author had studied the precise relation between the imagery in\nwaking life and in the dreams of the blind, and had mentioned those cases of\nso-called psychical blindness in which the patient still has visual dreams,\nalthough he has lost the power of visual recognition and visual reproduction\nin waking life.\nThe experimental study of involuntary movements has the great merit of\nbeing the first in time of a series of similar researches by other psychologists\nin America and elsewhere. A subject's hand, resting free upon a mobile\nrecording plate, has, according to Prof. Jastrow, a tendency to move towards\nthe object to which the subject is attending. The experiments are worth\nrepeating with less primitive apparatus. Prof. Jastrow himself has noticed\nthe tendency of the arm to move towards the body, yet he neglects to inform\nus in many cases whether the right hand or the left was resting on the\nrecording-plate. We are not told how many different subjects he experi\nmented with, nor under what conditions ; whether they knew the purpose of\nthe experiment, or were ignorant of it ; what kind of a tracing was obtained\n\fXLIV.] Review. 263\nin each case when the subject's attention was not directed to anything in\nparticular. This latter point is specially important, as no two subjects under\nthese conditions appear to yield identical, or indeed closely similar tracinga.\nThe technical deficiencies of the apparatus and the small number of the pub\nlished tracings prevent ua from placing any confidence in the results.\nF. N. HALES.\nLa SuggettibilM, par DR. ALFRED BINET (Paris, Schleicher freres, 1900.\npp. 400).\nPsycho-physiology progresses in the same way as physics and the other\nbranches of natural science, though perhaps more slowly. Each contribution,\nhowever small, adds to the exactness of analysis, and to the solidity of the\nwhole scientific structure. But there is another form of psychology, let us\ncall it introspective or \" individual \" psychology, which does not advance in\nthe same way. For instance, since the introduction of hypnotism and\nsuggestion as subjects of scientific investigation, hundreds of books and\npamphlets have appeared on these questions, of which only very few, perhaps-\nten or twenty, were really steps in advance. Most of them may be safely\nleft unread by the student, unless they contain material for discussion,\u2014well\nobserved and reliable facts.\nDr. Biiiet's last book on suggestibility may be considered a step in advance.\nIt is the first successful attempt to bring clearness into this loosely used and\nvaguely defined term. It describes methods of investigation, and defines the\ndistinctions between suggestion and other conceptions, such as \" hypnotism.\"\nThe two terms, hypnotism and suggestion, are usually mixed up in a\nhopeless way, and not only by laymen. In Dr. Binet's book hypnotism is\nabsolutely excluded from the field of observation. We have to do with,\nsuggestion and suggestibility pure and simple.\nSuggestibility is treated here as a normal quality of the healthy humaii-\nindividual,\u2014a quality which is never altogether lacking, but which varies in\nintensity between rather wide limits, while its excess merges into the\npathological. According to Dr. Binet, it is possible to measure the degree of\nthis quality, and to give in figures the co-efficient of suggestibility for each'\nindividual. The methods and experiments by which he attempts to show\nthis are admirably ingenious, but his desire for exactness often leads him to-\nnumerical results of very doubtful value, because of the small number of\nexperiments. What can be deduced from statistics in individual psychology-\nderived from experiments with 46 persons ?\nBut nevertheless, what is most valuable, the methods are indicated and a\nbeginning is made. Dr. Binet will agree with us in expecting different\nresults when not scores but thousands of individuals have been tested.\nThe book is extremely important on account of the wide scope of this same-\nquality, \" suggestibility,\" the study of which is necessary not only for the\npsychologist and the philosopher, but for the medical student, the student of\nlaw, and especially for the teacher.\n\f\u2022264 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART\nDr. Biuet has studied methodically and defined scientifically facts and ideas\n\u2022which were not altogether unknown, which have even become rooted in the\npopular belief in the form of anecdotes and proverbs. But the teacher who\nby dint of his carefully guarded authority stamps on his young pupil any\nartificial belief or unnatural creed never to be eradicated, or the judge eiitrap-\nping an innocent but suggestible person to his doom by subtle and persuasive\nquestioning, are instances of the terrible meaning of the vaguely noted facts.\nIndeed, this book, if carefully read, will open more eyes to the extreme\n\u2022danger of authoritative teaching and bias on the part of the judicial enquirer\nthan all the warnings of moralists. Any one of common sense will see after\nperusal of these simple experiments that it is absolutely necessary to change\n\u2022our general principles of education, to do away as much as possible with the\ninfluence of personal authority or prestige on the side of the teacher, and to\nteach our children independence of judgment, and the power of using their\nown eyes instead of those of the master. When we apply the lessons of this\n'book to the great social, political, and religious movements of the masses\u2014\nsubjects wisely not touched upon by the author\u2014their significance becomes\n\u2022enormous, and the necessity of a widespread study of them most evident.\nThe terms \"automatism\" and \"suggestibility\" are not so clearly dis\ntinguished as hypnotism aud suggestion. Indeed, the experiments and\nspeculations about \" automatism \" are the weakest parts of the book.\nIn Dr. P. Janet's well-known book, IIAutomatisms Psychologique, very\n.different phenomena were gathered together under the name of automatism.\nIn this book it was the facts rather than their classification which were dwelt\n\u2022upon, and it seems to me that Dr. Binet's treatment increases the difficulty\n.instead of solving it.\nWe apply the word \"automaton\" to a thing which can move by itself, with-\n\u2022out any impulse from without. The materialistic school of the last century\nconsidered the whole human organism an automaton, denying that it was\nmioved by that force of superhuman origin which we call will, or soul. The\npresent use of the word \" automatism \" for a part only of the organism seems\nto involve a tacit assumption that the whole is not purely automatic. And\nat is clear that unless the mystical or superhuman agent can act always and\n.everywhere, automatism must play a part in the organism.\nBut the experiments of Dr. Binet taken alone might lead many readers\n\u2022to the conclusion\u2014apparently shared by the author\u2014that it is now proved\nthat in the so-called automatic writing of mediums, no superhuman or extra-\nhuman agency is ever present. This conclusion, however, is by no means\njustified by the facts. In his experiments, Dr. Binet simply takes a few-\nfragments of the complicated human organism, and makes them act spon\ntaneously in an automatic way by patient and ingenious devices. Such\nprocedure is no proof at all that the same disintegration cannot be performed\nby some other external influence, human or non-human. This fallacious\n.conclusion is not indeed explicitly drawn, but it seems to be implied.\nF. VAU EEDEN.\n\fXLIV.] Review. 265\nHypnotism and Suggestion in Therapeutics, Education, and Reform, by\nR. OSGOOD MASON, A.M., M.D. (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co.\nLondon, 1901.)\nUnder the above title Dr. Osgood Mason has brought together in a small\nbook of some 340 large type pages, a mass of speculation, observation, and\ncriticism (together, I may add, with not a little rhetoric), touching almost\nall the phenomena, or alleged phenomena, which are usually considered\nsubjects of psychical research, as well as a good deal else besides. Hypnotism\nand the ethics of it, the subconscious mind, life and the underlying reality,\nclairvoyance, telepathy, Reichenbach, oriental occultism, all pass under\nreview. The result is a readable, discursive, and very miscellaneous book,\nof, it must be confessed, somewhat unequal value, but of very consider\nable interest where the author's own personal observation and practical\nexperience are concerned. It would seem that in the transparent atmosphere\nof the continent across the Atlantic, just as distant physical objects are made\nto look closer than they really are, so there is a tendency to regard as very\nnear at hand the solution of problems which to European enquirers still\nappear but dimly apprehended. And I venture to think that in his anxiety\nto construct a theory which will harmonize and co-ordinate all the various\nsubjects with which he deals, Dr. Mason has shown himself somewhat\ninfluenced by this tendency and has perhxps allowed himself to assume a\ngreater degree of familiarity with their nature than is altogether warranted\nby the general state of knowledge concerning them. The hypnotic state\nwhich, in at least one European school, and probably by the public at large\nalmost universally, has been considered to be a more or less pathological and\nexceptional condition, is here, implicitly at least, treated as the manifestation\n\u2022of a universal psychic force, its scope only limited by our experience, and\nits invocation for a given purpose, ethically considered, as indifferent as that\nof electricity or any other similar force in nature.\nMany instances of its successful therapeutic application are given, and one\ncannot help thinking that Dr. Mason has perhaps been exceptionally fortu\nnate in his subjects, or, as one would prefer to believe, exceptionally skilful\nin his treatment of them. For although, in other annals, examples of the\nreformation of inebriates and of the morally perverted are often quoted,\nwhich are as remarkable as certain cases in Dr. Mason's own experience,\nthe general results of hypnotic treatment of such patients do not on the\nwhole seem to fulfil the expectations of some of the more enthusiastic\nexperimenters of a few years back ; and though it is true, as Dr. Mason says,\nthat undue conservatism has altogether prevented its adoption in some\nquarters, it is none the less true that a more extended experience in other\nquarters of the uncertainty of its results has led to a considerable\nlimitation of its employment. Dr. Mason indeed calls attention to the fact\nthat the general feeling of the medical profession is that the therapeutic\nusefulness of hypnotism is very limited. It may be presumed that if this\nfeeling still persists after all these years of systematic investigation of the\n\f266 E. Feilding. [PART\ncapabilities of suggestive treatment, it cannot be entirely traceable to\nprejudice or ignorance. While in words Dr. Mason disavows any wish to\nclaim for it either miraculous results or general applicability to the majority\nof persons, the impression left on the mind of a reader of his book is that in\nfact he is far more optimistic regarding its ultimate universal value than\ncertain of his phrases would suggest. A chapter is devoted to the educa\ntional use of hypnotism and some remarkable instances of successful\ntreatment of cases difficult to deal with by other methods are given. I may\nselect the following for citation: \"A generally intelligent, but uneducated\nwoman, 35 years of age, although a good reader, experienced the greatest\ndifficulty in spelling ; she never wrote a letter without being obliged to\nconsult a dictionary for the majority of words. . . . She was an excellent\nhypnotic subject. . . . One day, now a year ago, she asked me if I could not\ndo something by suggestion for her troublesome inability to spell. I replied\nthat I would make the trial if she desired. Accordingly, I suggested a\u00bb\nfollows : ' You can read ; the correct form of every word you wish to write\nis already in your mind ; now when you are in doubt you will not try to\ntiiia1.- how the word is spelled ; you will become passive and at once an\nimpression of the correct spelling of the word will come to you, and you will\nwrite it without doubting or looking in the dictionary to see if it is right\/\nThe effect was immediate, and after two or three treatments, in order to\nshow the improvement, and express her gratitude, she wrote me a four page\nletter, without consulting the dictionary, and in which were only two or\nthree errors in spelling. Her language was most markedly that of an\nuneducated person. She constantly omitted her final g's\u2014said ' says I,' and\nwas entirely regardless of singular and plural in the use of nominatives and\nverbs. Half a dozen suggestions removed these errors in an astonishing-\nmanner, so that her language is now that of a fairly educated woman\u2014not\nfaultless, but good.\"\nThe following is one of Dr. Mason's most interesting examples of his suc\ncess in the reformation of character. \" A little boy, seven years of age, was &\nmost unhappy coward\u2014afraid of the slightest pain, and a coward and cry-baby\namong his playmates. He had some slight disease of the scalp which it was\nnecessary to treat, but he would cry and run away the moment I entered the\nroom. After one or two unhappy and only partially successful attempts at\ntreatment, I decided to try suggestion. Placing him in a chair opposite me,\nI took his face and head firmly between my hands, and putting my face near\nhis, I commanded him to look steadily in my eyes. It was very difficult to\nsecure his attention, but having succeeded, I soothed him with passes and\nlight touches, until his eyelids drooped ; he was perfectly quiet, subjective\nand sleepy, but not asleep. I then suggested that he would no longer be a\ncrying, whimpering coward, but a strong, brave boy ; that he would take his\ntreatment without fear, and that he would stand up sturdily for his rights\namong his fellows. This was repeated over and over, gently, but firmly ; he\nall the while remaining passive and sleepy, and apparently taking no notice\nwhatever of my suggestions. The next time I called he was shy, but not\n\fXLIV.] Review. 267\ntroublesome, and with two or three repetitions of the suggestions he came\npromptly and bravely to his treatment.\n\" I was also informed that the change in his manner among his playmates\nwas equally marked ; certainly all cringing and cowardly manner had dis\nappeared, and he seemed self-reliant and happy.\"\nThese are interesting examples of an application of hypnotism in which\nDr. Mason expects to see great developments in the next half-century,\nwhereby it will be placed \" among the most highly prized agents for good in\nuse among intelligent well-wishers of humanity.\"\nTo the objection so often urged against the justifiability of hypnotic treat\nment on the ground of its being an interference with free will, Dr. Mason\ndevotes a good deal of space. He quotes a father who said he would rather\nhis sou should go wrong of his own free will, than right by having that free\nwill interfered with by hypnotism. Yet what, he asks in effect, is education\nitself but the interference with the free will of the child by the presentation\nof motives for action in the right direction so continued as to be, in the long\nrun, irresistible ? Your son offends, and you seek to lead him from his\noffending by exhortation, by instruction, by the constant presentation of\nhigher ideals, by punishments. If you succeed, you will have influenced his\nwill. If you fail, what is the conclusion ? Either that the motives for a\nchange of conduct have been of insufficient strength, or that the boy's mind\nhas not been sufficiently impressionable, by reason of other distracting causes,\nto appreciate them. If through hypnotism you are able to eliminate this\ndistraction, to increase the impressionability of his mind, to present the\nmotives for improvement in such a form that they will be acted upon, where\nis the harm ? In what way is his individuality more tampered with than by\nthe other and unsuccessful method of dealing with him ?\nIf the question went no further than this, I take it that there could be but\none reasonable answer, and that favourable to Dr. Mason's contention. But\nthe problem is somewhat wider. We must ask ourselves how far, quiie\napart from the particular victory over the particular fault, we have upset the\nnormal balance between the conscious and the sub-conscious planes ; how far\nthe temporary emergence of the latter into consciousness may not result in\na tendency to intrude there increasingly in the future ; and to what extent\nthe habit of reliance on external suggestions may result in a restriction of\nspontaneous effort. We still know little of the true nature of hypnotism ;\nlittle of what actually takes place when we probe into the hidden depths\nbeneath consciousness, and of the possible lesions, unperceived and perhaps\nunperceivable, that may result from our intrusion among the secret fibres\nof being. The bulk of trustworthy evidence does indeed, so far as I am\njustified in attempting to weigh it, appear to show that in the hands of a\ncautious operator the use of hypnotic suggestion is unattended by any\ngeneral harmful results. But the habitual therapeutic use of hypnotism is\nstill confined to a comparatively small number of specialists, and it seems\nstill somewhat premature to lay down its complete and invariable inno-\ncuity almost as an axiom, as Dr. Mason appears to do, and to inculcate such\nS\n\f268 Mrs. A.

This little book, consisting of some twenty chapters,\nhas been produced by Monsieur Sage in the interests of French readers ; but\nit is to be recommended to all who wish for a clear and accurate general\nstatement of the case of Mrs. Piper, as an introduction to the detailed study\nof the first-hand reports essential to the serious student of such phenomena.\nMonsieur Sage gives an account of the origin of the trance, and of the\nvarious phases of its development during the fifteen years that Mrs. Piper\nhas been under the close observation of the Society for Psychical Research,\nand, in particular, of the Secretary of the American Branch, Dr. Richard\nHodgson. He treats in a thoroughly impartial spirit the many and compli\ncated questions suggested by an examination of the evidence ; he allows no\npersonal bias to interfere with his statement of the various hypotheses that\nhave been put forward in explanation of the facts, nor to determine his\nselection of the incidents to be narrated.

VERRALL.\nMagic and Religion, by ANDREW LANG. (Longmans, Green and Co. 8vo.\npp. 316. London, 1901.)\nThis volume is, for the most part, a continuous criticism of Mr. Frazer's\nGolden Bough. Mr. Lang and Mr. Frazer disagree almost in toto as to\nthe facts which are held to explain the origin of religions. The former\ntends in the direction of a \"primitive illumination \" which has been gradu\nally lowered in tone side by side with the progress of mankind in other\nrespects, the steady decline of religion keeping pace, oddly enough, with\nthe steady improvement of social feelings and current morality. Mr.\nFrazer on the other hand seeks for the fans et origo of the most exalted\ncreeds in the rites and practices of primitive magic, and, as is well known,\ndoes not hesitate in the added chapters of his recent edition to offer on\nthese lines an explanation of the great tragedy of Calvary itself.\nWith the main contents of Magic and Religion the psychical researcher\nhas little to do, despite the deep interest possessed by Mr. Lang's delightful\npages for the student of anthropology and folklore. Even the final chapter\n\u2014dealing with the \"Fire Walk\"\u2014which possesses a more direct interest\nfor the psychical investigator, has to a large extent already appeared in\nthe Proceedings of the S.P.R. But a quantity of fresh evidence has been\nadded by Mr. Lang, and in view of this he has withdrawn the \" psychical \"\nexplanation which he formerly offered in \" Modern Mythology,\" and now\nleaves the question open with the implied conviction that it is one for\nthe physician and physiologist alone. Nevertheless it is not easy to see\nwhy this change of front should be derived from the cases, cited by\nMr. Lang, where Europeans have taken part in the fire-walk, and from\nDr. Hocken's examination of the natives of Fiji in 1898. In the former\nof these two cases\u2014that reported by Col. Gudgeon\u2014the reporter expressly\nstates that the priest said to Mr. Goodwin : \" I hand my mana (power)\nover to you, lead your friends across,\" that they then \"stepped boldly\"\nacross the fiery surface and three of the four Europeans got across un\nscathed, while one was badly burnt who, like Lot's wife, \"looked behind\nhim,\" i.e. probably, lost courage and began to think of bolting. The\nColonel adds : \" A man must have mana to do it ; if he has not, it will\nbe too late when he is on the hot stone of Tama-ahi-roa.\" In the second\ncase Dr. Hocken mentions \" intense faith \" as a possible explanation, though\nhe thinks it highly improbable, for he finds it \"difficult to see how any\nmental state can prevent the action of physical law.\" Difficult indeed !\nNevertheless it may be that the Neoplatonic philosopher is not wholly\nwrong when he speaks of 6 Mar Se&s as the real explanation of the pheno\nmenon : \" they walk on fire unharmed, for the god within them does not\n\f270 E. N. Bennett.

How came it that Home's ied-hot cinder\nfelt cool in one person's hand, while it raised a painful blister on that\nof another? Was the poor clergyman whose hand was permanently scarred\nby the cinder utterly lacking in the essential mana, or had he forgotten\nto put on Mr. Podmore's asbestos glove ?\nSo much as to the explanation of the phenomenon, when the available\nevidence appears to show conclusively that the heat of the material trodden\nupon was so intense as to char and destroy the skin of a human being\ncoming in contact with it under normal conditions. The interesting paper,\nhowever, contributed by Professor Langley (see Journal S.P.R., October,\n1901) has proved clearly that the upper layer of stones in an exhibition\nof fire-walking which he witnessed in Tahiti was not nearly so hot as it\nappeared to be. The basaltic stones in question were such poor conductors\nof heat that even when the lower portion had become red hot, it was\npossible to step rapidly over the upper surface without much inconvenience.\nThere can be no doubt that Mr. Langley in dealing with the fire-walk\nbefore him has proved his point, that \"it was not a miracle\"; for the\nmisprint about the specific gravity of the stone does not really invalidate\nhis conclusions. Indeed, at first sight, the reader of Mr. Langley's paper\nfeels inclined to believe that he has before him the true explanation of\nevery recorded instance of the \"fire-walk.\" The intense heat underneath,\nthe spurts of flame shooting up from the interstices of the stones, the\ncomparative coolness of the surface presented to the feet of a cautious\nwalker\u2014all these factors seem to show how a man can step across the\nfurnace with safety, while a handkerchief falling into it is charred, a\ntimid performer, losing his head, blunders between the stones and is badly\nburnt, or a boy slipping down is actually killed by the flames.\nBut despite the prima facie appearance of comprehensiveness attached\nto Mr. Langley's evidence, and the irrelevancy of Mr. Lang's criticism\nthat the fire-walker in the case cited was a \"travelling performer,\" there\nyet remains a considerable mass of testimony which does not appear to-\nbe overthrown by Mr. Langley's experiments and observations. Even\nsetting aside all cases in which stones are employed for the oven, how\nare we to account for the immunity from injury enjoyed by the Nistinares\nof Bulgaria or the fire-walkers of Mauritius and Japan 1 In these instances\nthere is good evidence to show that the performers tread with naked\nfeet upon glowing embers. Colonel Haggard relates that at Tokio in\n1899 \"people of all ages walked through red-hot charcoal.\" Mrs, Schwabe,\na-n eye-witness of a fire-walk in Mauritius (see Journal S.P.R., December,\n1901), speaks of \"masses of red-hot embers to the depth of several inches\n\fXLiv.J Review. 271\n. . . the radiant heat of which was almost unbearable . . . several yards\nfrom the trench.\" A number of large logs carefully arranged might, of\ncourse, be red-hot underneath and fairly cool on the upper surface ; but\nthis is not the impression conveyed by the above testimony, which seems\nto imply the existence of a glowing mass of embers after the logs and\nbrushwood had been disintegrated by the preliminary blaze.\nSome very interesting matter is covered by the appendices to Mr. Lang's\nvolume. The strange story of St. Dasius' martyrdom is brought forward\nby the author of the Golden Bough to show that, as late as the reign\nof Diocletian, a yearly feast to Kronos (i.e. the Saturnalia) was celebrated\nin which a man selected by lot was \"clad in royal raiment and allowed thirty\ndays of revelry, after which he was to sacrifice himself at the altar of\nKronos.\" The tale itself is amplified in one MS. with a mass of that\necclesiastical padding so familiar to readers of the Vitae Sanctorum,\nbut it is doubtful if Mr. Lang has really succeeded in undermining the\nconclusion drawn by Mr. Frazer,\u2014that the slaying of a victim at the\nSaturnalia was still known of and occasionally practised as late as the close\nof the third century. Such a practice was, no doubt, at the time ex\nceedingly rare, but unless the narrator of the martyrdom was aware of\nits existence, it is difficult to understand why he introduced it into his\nnarrative at all. All that is stated is that, at the obscure frontier town\nof Dorostolum, such a yearly festival was held and the garrison fell in\nwith the local observances, as was frequently the case (cp. inscriptions\nupon altars found along the Roman wall and elsewhere passim), and selected\none of their own number, Dasius, as the victim. Whether he was a\nChristian or a pagan, whether or not he was insolent to the legatus, is\nirrelevant to the main point\u2014that, unless the narrator contradicts himself\negregioualy, the young soldier was selected as a victim of the Saturnalia.\nAs to the third appendix, which deals with the momentous question\nwhether the events of the Crucifixion week can be identified with certain\nalleged customs in vogue at the Feast of Pnrim, Mr. Lang has ably\ndemonstrated the one great weakness of Mr. Frazer's theory, viz., the\ndifference of date between Purim and Holy week. The question is alto\ngether too large for treatment within the limits of this review ; but it\nis perhaps worth while to call attention to a small textual point which\nis not noticed by either Mr. Lang or Mr. Frazer. Origen, as well as\nJerome, was undoubtedly cognizant of the MS. reading 'l-qaow [rii-] BapapfHiv\n1j 'liIaoSv Ti>v Xe-yo\/io'ox Xpurrdf. Despite the absence of much extrinsic evi\ndence for the authenticity of this strange text, the intrinsic evidence is\nvery great ; there would be every reason for altering the text in question,\nnone whatever for inventing it. If then the sentence originally ran, \" Shall\nI liberate unto you Jesus [the] Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?\" how\nmuch colour might be lent to Mr. Frazer's theory 1 Of the two prisoners\nnamed Jesus, one had been selected to play the part of \" Barabbas \"\u2014the\n\"Son of the Father\"\u2014who was to be crowned, scourged, and ultimately\nslain ; the other was to be set free.

BENNKTT.\nDreams and their Meanings, by HORACE G. HUTCHINSOX. (London : Long\nmans, Green & Co., 1901. 8vo, pp. 320 ; price, 9s. 6d. net.)\nThis is a book which seems to have made itself to a considerable extent.\nIt has grown out of an article published by the author in Longmans' Magazine\non \"Common Dreams.\" This caused a deluge of letters to descend on\nMr. Hutchinson's head, and about one-third of the present work is based\non these letters. The last two chapters, which make up rather more than\nanother third, are from the hand of a collaborator whose fervent faith \u2022was\nheld to mark him out as a fit and proper person to deal with telepathic and\npremonitory dreams. The remaining eighty pages, from the hand of Mr.\nHutchinson, deal in a somewhat less than exhaustive manner with what\nscience has to say about dreams, with the bearing of dreams on the question\nof the origin of religion, with divination, and with interpretations of\ndreams\u2014a collection of facts that would have been better placed in the\nchapter on divination.\nThe book does not pretend to be more than a popular work, and it would\nbe unfair to judge it by scientific standards. Even in a popular work, how\never, we might have expected to find some reference to the subliminal\nconsciousness. There does not seem to be a mention of it in the first part of\nthe book, however. A little research in the publications of the S.P.R. would\nhave enabled the author to produce a book that would have been at once\nmore interesting to the general reader and more useful. By directing\nattention to such questions as automatic waking at a specified hour, he\nmight have induced his readers to bring together a large amount of useful\nmaterial.\nWith the work of the collaborator\u2014a member of the S.P.R., who prefers\nto be nameless\u2014it is unnecessary to deal at great length. The materials are\ntaken mainly from the Proceedings, but are used in an uncritical spirit, which\ngives the unpsychical reviewer only tot> much occasion to lift up the finger of\nscorn. He suggests, for example, that the finding of lost articles through\ndreams can only be explained on the theory that \" our spirit is conducted by\nso-called occult means to the place where the lost article is reposing.\" In the\nchapter on premonitory dreams we see evidence of the same fault. Two of\nthe dreams classed as premonitory (pp. 273, 293) seem to be merely telepathic ;\nthe case on p. 291 does not of necessity involve any more occult source of\ninformation than the subliminal consciousness ; and the same may, perhaps\nbe said of the cases on pp. 287 and 289. Beyond a vague statement that the\ndetails of the dream on p. 280 were the same as those of the subsequent\naccident, there is nothing to show that the dream had any connection with\n\fXLIV.] Review. 273\nthe accident : even if it could be shown that the details were in substantial\nagreement, they are such as might apply to many collisions at sea. But\nperhaps the most staggering point about the whole chapter is the statement,\nquoted from the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, where it refers\nto telepathic cases, that premonitory dreams are proved. But so far from\nthis being the view of the Committee, they expressly say on p. 331 that\nthe cases with which they deal afford no adequate justification for taking\nthis view, which introduces vast difficulties. There can be no excuse for a\nmisstatement of this kind. It is clear that the statistical inquiry which\nwas necessary to demonstrate the existence of spontaneous telepathy is far\nmore necessary in the case of premonitory dreams ; the chance coincidences\nwill in the latter case, apart from the complications introduced by the greater\ncomplexity of dreams, be more numerous in proportion as dreams are more\nnumerous than waking hallucinations. At present belief in premonitions\nis only a superstition. N. W. THOMAS.\nElementeder Empirische Teteologie,\\<jn Paul Nicolaus Cossmann (Stuttgart,\nA. Zimmer's Verlag, 1899).\nI wish to draw attention to this book as one of the most important that\nhas appeared during the last few years. It was published in ]899, but I\nthink it will come to be considered as one of the first signs of dawn of the\nnew scientific spirit of our present century.\nlu fact, in its modest appearance and dry form, it seems to me of no less\nimportance for us than the essay of Mayer on the conservation of energy was\nfor the 19th century. It does what every work of high merit has done,\u2014it\nformulates what has been in the scientific mind for a long time in a vague\nindefinite fashion. It is the scientific revival of teleology after a long night\nmare of determinism\u2014not, however, the old-fashioned teleology, but teleology\nin a new and deeper sense.\nIt contains nothing new, nothing of which a philosopher would not say :\nindeed, we knew this long ago. And yet it is entirely new in its thoroughly\nscientific method of treatment.\nHenceforth no man of science who wishes to escape the name of amateur<\nwill be able to proclaim determinism as the principle of natural science, and\nto discard teleology as purely metaphysical and mystical. Teleology will be\nhenceforth a scientific principle unavoidably required ; no researcher will be\nable to do without it. And this is the result of Cossmann's work.\nBesides causal relations, nature shows teleological relations of facts. In a\ncausal relation, two co-operating causes a and b form the result c, a and 6 being\nconstant, c being exclusively determined by a and b. In a teleological\nrelation a and c are constant, and determine the secondary cause b.\nThese two forms of relation do not exclude each other, but exist together.\nThe causal relation is always there, but it is not alone. The teleological relation\ndoes not exist without causality, yet it is not causality.\nTo give an instance : The protective colour of a butterfly is a link in a\n\f274 N. W. Thomas. [PART\nteleological relation, yet it could not exist if the chemical matter which forms\nthe colour was not present in the animal, as a causal factor.\nAnd I consider it a stroke of genius in Cossmann's work to draw a definite\ndistinction between what we call living and non-living nature with regard to\nthe teleological relationship. In this way the old contention about vitalism\nis finally settled, a simple, clear and scientific definition being given, which\ncannot be mistaken nor lead to error ; to the effect, namely, that in natural\nsciences we distinguish two series of observable facts\u2014one series (non-living\nnature) which is without a teleological relation, the other series (living nature)\nwhich is invariably related tdeologically as well as causally.\nF. VAN EEDEN.\nFact and Fancy in Spiritualism, Theosophy, and P\u00abychical Research, by\nG. C. HUBBELL. (Cincinnati : Robert Clarke Co., 1901. 8vo, pp. vi. +9-208.)\nThis work is the outcome of a series of lectures delivered by the author\nbefore the Ohio Liberal Society of Cincinnati. The four lectures which com\npose it were not originally destined for publication, as the author informs us,\nand have apparently undergone little or no revision, with the natural result\nthat there is a certain lack of continuity and an occasional want of firmness\nof treatment. This does not, however, detract seriously from the interest of\nthe book, which is not intended to be more than a popular exposition of the\nsubject. It will be found eminently readable by amateurs, who will not\nonly appreciate the easy style in which it is written, but may also profit by\nthe sane view taken by Mr. Hubbell.\nThe first three chapters deal with Madame Blavatsky, and with the bearing\nof the results hitherto attained in Psychical Research on the questions of\nbelief in a future life and on the materialistic theory ; in a final chapter,\nbased to some extent on personal experience, the author gives some account\nof the frauds of Spiritualism, but at the same time suggests that there is an\nelement which neither fraud nor hallucination can explain. In some of his\nremarks on Spiritualism Mr. Hubbell hardly eeems to appreciate the extent\nto which our standards of evidence have risen during the past twenty-five\nyears. He quotes the experiments of De Qasparin and the Dialectical\nSociety, together with those of Sir W. Crookes, in proof of his assertion that\n\" the movement of ponderable objects without physical contact, such move\nment displaying intelligence, ... is established beyond all question.\" In\nview of our increased knowledge of the possibilities of fraud and of the falli\nbility of human testimony, even if we make allowance for the fact that thr\nexperiments took place under specially favourable conditions and that Home\nwas never detected in trickery, this expression is too strong. It may be that\nHome was exceptional in his gifts, and that we can for this reason hardly\nhope for speedy confirmation of the observations of Sir W. Crookes ; but\nthat confirmation is needed the experimenter himself would probably be the\nfirst to admit.\nIn the chapter on Psychical Research and a Future Life, the author,\n\fXLIV.] Review. 275\nafter dealing with the Piper case, goes ou to explain the bearing of the\ntheory of telepathy on the belief in a future state of existence, but his argu\nment hardly carries conviction. On p. 99 he states that the fundamental\ncontention of materialism\u2014that body and mind are so connected and related\nthat the action of the mind is entirely confined to the body, and dies with\nthe body\u2014is shaken, if not overthrown (presumably by the fact of telepathy).\nBut even if it is not true, as the author expressly states on p. 129, that\ntelepathy can in all probability be explained in terms of matter and motion,\ni.e. on a materialistic hypothesis,\u2014it is clear that we have in telepathy from\nthe living no basis for arguing that the soul will survive death. Perhaps the\npassage iu question is intended to apply rather to the Piper case, but if this\nis so, the choice of words is unfortunate. The argument should clearly be\nbased, not on the telepathic, but on the spiritistic theory. It may be that\nboth the telepathic and the spiritistic hypotheses involve telepathy ; but\nthe important fact, from Mr. Hubbell's point of view, is in this case not\ntelepathy, but the source from which the telepathic impulse comes. The\nquestion is naturally one which will appeal to many of Mr. Hubbell's\nreaders, and it is a pity that he should not have made his point quite clear.\nN. W.

It is for this reason that the Council\nhas sanctioned the appearance of the paper under a pseudonym.\u2014\nEDITOR.]\nI offer the following notes of a series of experiments in hypnotism\nwith my friend M. with some diffidence, aware that they contain\nno such circumstances of exceptional importance as would perhaps\nalone justify their being brought forward now that the general\nphenomena have been so completely examined and described. The\nresults achieved in this series do not transcend those which may\nusually be expected with a fairly susceptible subject. The fact,\nhowever, that the experiments were conducted with an educated\nsubject, himself greatly interested in the development of phenomena\nwith which he had previously been unacquainted, and to the examina\ntion of which he was able to bring an acute and discriminating\nintelligence, and an unusual power of self-analysis, lends them a\ncertain interest. It is, in my experience, so rare that an operator\nfinds himself assisted in this way by a subject, at once thoroughly\ntrustworthy and normal, while possessing a high degree of hypnotic\nsusceptibility, that I am encouraged to think the results may not\nbe unworthy of description.\nMy friend M. is a young man aged 22, quick and alert in mind,\nand of an enthusiastic and decidedly nervous temperament, highly\nidealistic and with considerable literary gifts. At present engaged\nin teaching, he has much influence with boys, in his treatment of\nwhom he shows both initiative and judgment. He is interested in\n\f280 Edward Greenwood. [PART\nathletic pursuits and takes as much part in them as constitutional\nweakness of the lungs will allow. Formerly afflicted with consumption,\nthis disease, which was taken in time and is no longer active, has left\nhim physically delicate and incapacitated for much bodily effort. It\nalso, no doubt, left his nervous system in a somewhat hypersensitive\ncondition. I wish, however, to emphasise the fact that he is essentially\nnormal and responsible, of robust character and of decided intellectual\nability.\nHaving witnessed one or two simple hypnotic experiments, M.\nevinced much interest in the subject, but at first expressed dis\ninclination to submit to any himself. On the question subsequently\nrecurring in conversation, however, I asked to be allowed to test\nhis susceptibility, engaging at the same time to refrain from any\nexperiment. He consented, and after a very short procedure, I\nsucceeded in closing his eyes. As soon as I had demonstrated his\ninability to open them, I immediately restored him to his normal\nstate, but, interested by this small experience, he appeared to lose\nhis former distaste, and thereupon invited me to test systematically\nthe extent of the influence. This, then, was the genesis of the\nseries of experiments, some 20 or 30 in number, which I now have\nit in hand to describe.\nThe actual process of hypnotisation has always been of the most\nsimple and rapid description. Almost from the first, it has only\nbeen necessary, after he has composed himself for the experiment,\nto say the word \" sleep,\" and he immediately passes into the hypnotic\nstate. The trance is not a deep one ; he retains full consciousness\nof himself, and his mental powers undergo no change, except in so\nfar as he is amenable to suggestions given by myself. His memory,\nafter awakening, is practically continuous, and while he is, during\nthe trance, otherwise completely susceptible to post-hypnotic sugges\ntion, I am wholly unable, by this means, to produce any lasting\nbreak between his hypnotic and his normal consciousness. In the\ncourse of the experiments, the character of the trance underwent\nseveral changes to which I shall later refer. His degree of suscepti\nbility has, however, not varied ; certain limitations to my power of\nsuggestion presented themselves in the first experiments, and have\nnot since been modified.\nIt is not my purpose to describe in detail the experiments in which\nwe engaged, except in so far as may be necessary in order to give\nM.'s own description of his sensations while undergoing them. The\nexperiments were of the ordinary character: all attempts to produce\n\fXLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism. 281\nany of the higher class of alleged phenomena, such as thought-\ntransference, clairvoyance, or even augmentation of the faculties of\nsense, being complete failures.\nI now proceed to give a general account of M.'s condition.\nThe injunction to sleep immediately places him in a state of sug\ngestibility. In the latter experiments he passed directly into this\nstate without any apparent external change whatever taking place ;\nthough in the earlier experiments, the change was marked by the\ninvoluntary closing of the eyes, which he immediately asked, and\nobtained, permission to open again. Beyond a slight alteration in\nhis manner, imperceptible to a third person who was not forewarned,\nand frequently difficult even for myself to appreciate, there is, ever\nsince the first few experiments, no external difference between his\ntrance and his normal condition. During the former, however, he\nis physically completely under my control, any movement being\neither inhibited by the merest gesture on my part, or performed in\nobedience to an expressed wish. M. tells me that he experiences\nno sense of compulsion by me :\u2014an inhibited movement seeming to\nbe inhibited at its source in his will. Thus, if I tell him that he\ncannot do a certain thing, he agrees. If I then desire him to try\nto do it, he explains that he could make the movement if he wished,\nbut that he does not wish. If I then desire him to wish it, he\ndeclines. Similarly, an action which I tell him to perform is performed\napparently as a free exercise of his own will, and because he prefers\nto perform it, and the full consciousness that it is a suggestion from\nmyself makes no difference to the sensation of free choice. I have,\nhowever, been able to show him that a suggestion to perform some\nindifferent action such as to sit in a particular chair, or to reveal\nthe position of a hidden coin, which he had previously, while in his\nnormal state, at my instance deliberately made up his mind he would\nnot perform, and which he still objected to perform in his trance\nstate, could nevertheless not be resisted if sufficiently often reiterated.\nHis sensuous suggestibility is strictly limited to certain only of\nthe senses. Taking in order the various senses, I found that I could\naffect them as follows :\n(1.) The sense of sight proved quite insusceptible. I could neither\nsuggest a visual hallucination, nor produce any hallucinated variations\nof colour or form, nor render invisible a present object.\n(2.) The sense of hearing was also refractory. I could neither\nproduce a hallucinated sound, nor render real sounds inaudible,\n(3.) Smell and taste were under my control, and I could either\n\f282 Edward Greenwood. [PART\nproduce a feeling of nausea by suggesting an abominable odour, or\nvary the taste of things that he might eat or drink. A glass of\nwater took on, according to my direction, the taste of spirits or of\nwine, followed, if so suggested, by appearances of complete intoxica\ntion. A piece of soap which I informed him was of rarest quality,\nand tasted like chocolate, he ate with much relish till I suddenly woke\nhim up. This experiment was proposed by himself, and he retained\nthroughout the full consciousness that, in point of fact, the soap\nwas soap, and not chocolate.\n(4.) As regards the sense of feeling, I was able to produce, but\nnot abolish, the sensation of pain. Thus, while I failed to produce\nansesthesia, even to the slightest degree, a suggestion that his chair\nwas hot, or that he had a toothache, would succeed. He would explain\nduring its continuance, that he knew the suggestion was false, and\nthat the pain was not genuinely felt, that the symptoms of discomfort\nwhich he exhibited seemed to proceed direct from the suggestion,\nand the actual discomfoit to be deduced from the symptoms. Thus\na suggestion that there was a pin in his chair caused him to move\nuneasily, and to be unable to stop doing so. He said that nevertheless\nhe did not actually feel the physical sensation of pricking, but merely\na kind of localized moral discomfort consequent upon his inability\nto cease showing the uneasiness due to the suggestion of a physical\none. A curious result was obtained by giving a suggestion affecting\nsenses respectively subject, and refractory to, my influence. Thus\na declaration that he was on the bank of a river and required to\ncross to the other side, to be fully successful, would involve a visual\nhallucination\u2014which, as before explained, I was unable to produce\u2014\nand a tactile hallucination (which was within my power). While\nseeing nothing before him but the carpet, therefore, he nevertheless\nfelt, on stepping on it, the coldness of the water, and while perfectly\nconscious that there was no visible river, he found it necessary,\nwhen told to cross, spontaneously to take off his shoes and stockings,\nand roll up his trousers in order to avoid the irresistible suggestion\nof getting wet. He protested at the same time against the absurdity\nof his doing so, but explained that he found the precaution followed\ninevitably from the fear of the sensation of wet.\nSuggested impersonations were also fully executed, unless they\ntrenched too blatantly upon the absurd. Thus a suggestion that M.\nwas myself, and that I was he. succeeded ; and in his reversed capacity\nhe continued a course of experiments upon myself, devising several\noriginal and ingenious varieties to which I, for the sake of the game,\n\fXLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism. 283\nacquiesced in subjecting myself. He also behaved with considerable\ndignity and verve as King Edward VII., until I threw a match at\nhis head, a proceeding which appeared to conflict so strongly with\ndramatic verisimilitude that he lapsed back into his ordinary hypnotic\ncondition, nor could I reinduce the impersonation. On the other\nhand, statements that he was the Empress of China, and that he\nwas a nurse and I a baby, failed to carry any conviction, being\neither received with a passive assent, or rejected with scorn. In his\nwaking state he explained that he was inly conscious that in point\nof fact he was not the characters that he was bidden to assume,\nand that if asked he would have said as much, but that he was\nirresistibly impelled to act as though he were.\nI have stated that M. is highly susceptible to post-hypnotic\nsuggestions. The execution of such suggestions is somewhat curious.\nSince I am unable to affect the continuity of his memory, he is\naware, when awaked, of the fact that a suggestion is impending ;\nhe is also aware while executing it of the fact that it is a suggestion,\nthough it may be that if there is a considerable interval of time\nbefore the suggestion is due the memory of it will fade from his\nmind, to revive when the time has come. The following instance\nis of some interest. I told him on one occasion that next day\nI would ask him to walk with me in the garden, and that when\nthere I would ofter him a book, and ask him to read me a passage\nout of it, but that he would only find himself able to read every\nalternate word. The following morning, when we went forth, he\nhad a copy of Punch in his hand. I asked him if it contained\nanything good, and, if so, to read it to me. He forthwith, and\nsomething to my disappointment, read me a set of verses without\na flaw. I then produced my own book, directed his attention to\na passage, and asked him to read it aloud. He started doing so,\nreading, however, only every alternate word, and presently stopped,\nsaying he could not understand what it was all about.\nI asked him if he was aware that he was executing a post-hypnotic\nsuggestion. He said that he had forgotten about it, but that he\nnow remembered it clearly. I then asked him to try whether, with\nthe full consciousness that he was the victim of a mere suggestion,\nhe would still be forced to submit to it. The result showed the\ninfluence to be unaltered. He said that he was aware that there\nwas something in between the words which he read, but that they\nconveyed no meaning to his mind ; so that while reading aloud he\nfailed to grasp the meaning of the passage ; but that if he read it\n\f284 Edward Greenwood. [PART\nto himself he understood it without difficulty. As an instance of\nthe accuracy with which the suggestion had operated, it appeared\nthat if he selected a passage himself he was able to read it\ncorrectly, whereas if I selected it, though it might be the same\npassage, he could make nothing of it.\nAs a contribution to the question as to whether, during the\nexecution of a post-hypnotic suggestion a subject lapses back into\nthe hypnotic state, I may here mention that on my way into the\ngarden I bent over a rhododendron and declared that it smelt of\nvanilla. He expressed surprise that it should do so, tested it him\nself, and agreed. On our way back, after the close of the reading\nexperiment, he again paused at this rhododendron to smell it, but\nfound it had lost its scent. He then immediately realized that its\nfirst perception of it was due to a suggestion. But this sugges\ntibility did not extend to orders which were more obviously\nsuggestions, except during the actual execution of the post-hypnotic\ncommand. Thus I found that, while he was actually engaged in\ntrying to read a selected passage, I could inhibit any movement\nby a sudden direction to that effect, but that when he ceased\nreading I was unable to continue the inhibition. If the post-hypnotic\nsuggestion is to be executed shortly after it was given, so that the\nmemory of it does not escape him, the mode of execution is some\nthing as follows : I tell him that three minutes after waking he will\nget up and sit on my kneee. Then I wake him.\n\" Oh, so I'm to sit on your knee, am I ? \"\n\" Yes, do you feel as if you were going to ? \"\n\" Not in the least ; I never felt less inclined to do anything\nin my life.\"\nThen we talk of other things. Presently he says :\n\" Do you know, I do begin to feel as if I should like to sit on\nyour knee. But I won't.\"\nThen a little later :\n\" I say, I really feel a most extraordinary wish to sit on your\nknee. I know I sha'n't be happy till I do. You mustn't mind. I\nreally think I'd better.\" . . .\nAnd he does.\nI should here state that owing to M.'s ready susceptibility I\nbegan to fear I might acquire an influence which would be in\nconvenient both to him and to me, and so enjoined that thenceforth,\nwhether he wished it or no, I should be unable to hypnotise him\nunless he previously recited a formula asking me to do so, in a\n\fXLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism. 285\nparticular form of words. After several failures 1 eventually\nsucceeded in impressing this so strongly upon him that it became\nabsolutely effective, and the formula proved requisite before I could,\neven with the utmost co-operation on his part, influence him in\nthe least. One night, however, after retiring to bed, I was\nsurprised by his entering the room with the request that I should\nawaken him. I expressed astonishment, and asked whether he was\nreally asleep. He assured me that he was, and explained that\nwhile we had been conversing in the drawing-room after dinner,\nother persons being present, he had experimentally recited the\nformula, solto voce, and had immediately, unperceived by myself or\nthe others in the room, gone off into the hypnotic state, and could\nnot get out of it again. I protested that this was an extremely\nunfair trick both on himself and on me, and to guard against its\nrecurrence I enjoined that in future a mere repetition of the\nformula should not suffice, but that it must be formally written\ndown, signed, and handed to me. This has hitherto proved com\npletely effective, and in the absence of the document no efforts\non the part of either of us, however much prolonged, have any\nresult whatever.\nI will now describe what appears to me the most interesting feature\nin M.'s development, viz. the variations that have taken place in his\ndemeanour in the hypnotic state. During the first two or three\nhypnotizations, his secondary condition was very markedly different\nfrom his normal state. His sight seemed dim, and his eyes wore a\nvague and distant look. His demeanour was heavy, his movements\nslow, and his manner of speech low, restrained, and quite devoid of\nits usual vivacity. He exhibited extreme nervousness; the slightest\nsound caused him to start, and on one occasion, at the sight of a beetle\n(I was never able to determine whether this animal was real or the\ncreature of self-hallucination), fled across the room in a paroxysm of\nterror, from which I had some ado to recall him to calmness. Towards\nmyself he exhibited much repugnance, disliking that I should touch or\neven approach him. I appeared to him in a mist, and as wearing a\nhorrible aspect, with diabolic eyes ; nor could any suggestion restore\nme to favour in his sight. Further, his range of vision was consider\nably diminished. Whereas his normal reading distance is about\n1J ft., he found himself unable to read a book at a greater distance\nthan 6 ins.\nAfter the third experiment many of these symptoms changed. He\ncompletely lost his fear of myself, his general nervousness vanished,\n\f286 Edward 0-reenwood. [PART\nhis condition was no longer comatose and languid, but resembled very\nclosely his normal state. His speech was indeed somewhat slower, his\nmanner more restrained than was usual in his normal state, but a\ncasual observer would scarcely have recognized anything abnormal.\nOne evening, some time after the establishment of this as his ordinary\nhypnotic condition, he surprised me by suddenly behaving in quite a\ndifferent manner. He became extremely hilarious and absurd, jested\nin an easy way, displayed a tendency for practical jokes upon myself,\nkicked my clothes about the room, and was generally obstreperous and\nfantastic, both in his speech and behaviour. I met him in the same\nspirit till in a moment, without warning, he reverted to his former\nhabit\u2014quiet, speculative, and restrained. Later on, in the same\nevening, a further relapse into his jocose vein took place. The complete\ndifference between the two conditions, the absolute contrast of the\nwhole manner of the man as presented in each respectively, the\nalteration in his expression, conduct, and mode of speech, the sudden\nand unexpected way in which the change took place, sometimes in the\nmiddle of a sentence, involving frequently a break in his thought, and\nu cessation and repudiation of what he had just been saying, brought\nme tentatively to regard these variations as a kind of embryonic\nspecimen of multiple personality.\nIn course of time further variants developed, quite spontaneously,\neach differing markedly from any other. These moods, if I may so\ncall them, do not attain to the dignity of the personalities in the\nclassic cases of Leonie or of Louis V., for example, and indeed M.\ndisclaims for them anything in the nature of distinct personalities.\nHe is conscious of complete continuity between them, a continuity\nfar more perfect than that between his waking and hypnotic con\nditions. Their appearance is beyond his control, and independent\nof my suggestion, though I have found I can produce one or other\nof them at will. It is, he explains, as though he were a magic-\nlantern, with many-coloured slides passing in sequence before his\neyes, so that he looks out upon the world, and thinks and feels\nregarding it, through a constantly changing medium. For it is not\nonly in externalities that these moods vary from one another : they\ncarry with them each a different set of emotions, tastes, and a different\nmental attitude. For reference, they may be christened as follows :\n(A) the \"nervous\" mood, i.e. the one in which appeared during the\nfirst three hypnotizations. (I may perhaps be wrong in classifying this\nas a distinct mood. He has never since lapsed back into it, and I have\nnot attempted to reproduce it by suggestion.)\n\fXLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism. ' 287\n(B) the \"ordinary\" or \"quiet\" mood, which during a considerable\nportion of the series was the only one that appeared.\n(C) the \" malicious \" mood, of which I shall speak later.\n(D) the \" gay \" mood, almost identical with (C), except that there\nappears no aggressive wish to do injury.\n(E) the \"depressed \" mood, in which he expresses himself as utterly\nand beyond bounds miserable, and ready for no reason to burst into\ntears. The following are some instances of the complete change that\nthese varying moods involve : While in his normal state he is a man\nof gentle nature, in his \" malicious \" mood he expresses a strong wish\nto inflict pain, and frequently asks me to allow him to stab me in order\nto give him the satisfaction of seeing the blood flow. Indeed, I have\noften detected him surreptitiously extracting a penknife from his\npocket, with a view to gratifying this peculiar and alarming inclination.\nHe confesses to a wish to vivisect, or, failing that, to strangle. I gave\nhim permission on one occasion to do his worst, and he made so\ndetermined an attempt on me with a towel round my throat that I\nwas forced to bid him forego the remainder of the experiment. Again,\nwhile in his normal waking state a person of well-bred and courteous\ndemeanour, and a religious and idealistic temperament, in his \" gay \"\nmood he displays an astounding lack of the ordinary conventions or\nproprieties, professes a complete contempt for either religion or\nmorality, and a disregard for any responsibility in his actions, becomes,\nin his own phrase, a child of nature, non-moral, though not vicious.\nIf I offer a suggestion not in consonance with the particular mood he\nmay be in, I may insist upon its execution quite vainly so long as he\ncontinues in that mood. If, however, I procure a change in the mood\nitself\u2014a change which it is beyond his power to resist\u2014he is im\nmediately ready to fall in with the suggestion. Thus, if he is in his\n\" ordinary \" or \" quiet \" mood, and I suggest something of which he\ndisapproves, no amount of insistence on my part will avail to get him\nto perform it. I then say : \" Very well, I will put you into your\n' gay ' mood, and then you will not object.\" He may protest against\nthe change, but vainly. I say : \" When I count 5 you will pass into\nthe 'gay' mood. 1\u20142\u20143\u20144\u20145!\" Immediately a change passes\nover his face ; he generally rises from his chair, rollicks about the\nroom, and professes himself ready to execute even the most preposterous\nsuggestions of which he had scouted the very idea only the moment\nbefore.\nM.'s waking memory of what passes in his hypnotic state, while\nalways continuous, was, as I have elsewhere indicated, subject in the\n\f288* Edward Greenwood. [PART\nearlier experiments to occasional intermissions. Towards the close of\nthe series, however, the continuity became perfect, and he is therefore\nable to pass in review, during his waking state, the various \" moods \"\nin which he has undergone his hypnotic adventures. Though he may\nfeel surprise, from his waking standpoint, at his having expressed such\nand such a sentiment, or done such and such an action while in one of\nthese moods, his memory is perfect, not only of the sentiment or action\nitself, but also of the emotions and points of view accompanying them.\nWe soon began to discuss, in his waking state, the probable limits of\nhis acquiescence to distasteful suggestions, as it began to seem likely\nthat, granting that they were given while he was in an appropriate\nmood, there might be no limits at all. And at first we both came to\nthe conclusion that this was probably the case.\nI obtained his permission to test this more systematically, and we\narranged to try the effect of certain suggestions, certain of which\nwere proposed by himself, and to which he agreed that in his\nwaking state he would feel the strongest objections. I found at\nfirst that if I gave such a suggestion in his \" ordinary \" or \" quiet \"\nmood he would flatly refuse to execute it, and be rather indignant\nat my insistence. Nor could any power cause him to yield. If I\nthen put him into his \" gay \" mood, he at once expressed surprise\nat his former objection and explained it on the ground that he had\nbeen in his \" quiet \" mood, for the prejudices of which, he declared,\nthere was no accounting, and for which, in his \" gay \" mood, he\nappears to entertain the same kind of contempt that a music-hall\nmanager would for the London County Council. Short of the obvious\nlimitations that must be imposed on experimentation of this kind,\neven the most repugnant suggestions have, by this device, gained\nacceptance It is impossible, in practice, to prove how far this kind of\nthing really will go, or to put to the test an actually criminal or\nimmoral action. Nor have I been sufficiently heroic to test whether,\nin point of fact, M. would really vivisect me, if permitted, or stab me in\nthe jugular or strangle me, though I am inclined, from certain indications\nof the fundamental change of instinct that takes place, to believe his\nassurance that he would do it with the greatest delight.\nAdmitting the weakness of any evidence short of such experiment\nation, I cannot but express my own belief that when M. assured me\nthat, no matter how repugnant an action might be to him in his\nwaking state, it would cease to be so if suggested, or permitted,\nwhile he was in an appropriate mood, he was probably correct in\nhis statement. It is true that later experiments caused us both to\n\fXLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism.\nmodify our conclusion as to the absolute irresistibility of these sug\ngestions, and on the last occasion on which any such were tried he\nopposed to my most artful endeavours a completely successful\nresistance. And this, notwithstanding the fact that the particular\nsuggestion was one to which on a former occasion I had easily\ngained his acquiescence, and which, in his waking state, he had just\nconsented to my trying to repeat. I think, however, that this forti\nfication of his power of resistance may be traced to my frequent\nreferences to the matter in his waking state, and to my repeated\nrequests that he should resolve to try and resist to the uttermost.\nIt is the first occasion in my own experience that I have observed\nthe phenomena presented in these so-called \" moods \" to which M. is\nsubject, and I am not aware of a similar condition having previously\nbeen described elsewhere. It is therefore impossible to argue from\nthis particular case to the general. It is accordingly to this particular\ncase that 1 must limit my conclusion, which is, repugnant and\nunexpected as I confess it to be, that, in the hands of an unscrupulous\noperator, there was at one period of the experiment possibly no limit\nto the acquiescence that might, by artful procedure, have been induced\nto suggestions which, in his normal state, would be highly distasteful\nto the subject ; and that the moral prepossessions which are usually\nconsidered to be ample safeguards against a misuse of the power of\nsuggestion would have been, in this case at all events, an insufficient\nprotection. And I am of opinion that even now it is by no means\nimprobable that suggestions which, though repugnant to him in his\nwaking state, are spontaneously consonant to him, say in his \"mali\ncious \" mood,\u2014such, for example, as a suggestion to stab or to\nstrangle,\u2014might not most blithe-heartedly be acted upon.\n\f290 Walter Skeat [PART\nn.\nMALAY SPIRITUALISM.\nBY WALTER SKEAT.\n[THE following is part of a paper which appeared under the above\ntitle in Folk-Lore, Vol. XIIL, No. 2, June, 1902, and is here reprinted\nby the kind permission of the Council of the Folk-Lore Society. The\npaper was read at the General Meeting of the Society for Psychical\nResearch on May 30th, 1902.\u2014EDITOR.]\nWhen I recently had the honour of being invited by the Council to\nread a paper before this Society,i I had nothing ready which seemed\nsuitable for the purpose. It appeared to me, however, that it would\nbe a useful piece of work to bring together in one paper the main facts\nconcerning the spiritualistic beliefs of the Peninsular Malays, with\nspecial reference to motor automatisms of the type of the Divining-Rod,\nwhere the motions of an inert object in contact with a human being\nmay be regarded as externalisations of subconscious knowledge. Out\nof this idea the present paper has grown.2 I shall therefore now\nendeavour in the first place to put the details of the Malay per\nformances before you as clearly as possible. I shall then proceed to\nstate the problem, in so far as it concerns ethnology, and shall only\nrefer incidentally to the few, and, I fear, somewhat negative results\nwhich may be of general psychical interest. Speaking generally, most\nforms of spiritualism known to us in Europe are most likely known in\nsome form or other to Malay magicians, even though they may not all\nhave been yet recorded. Devil-dancing is practised, and apparitions\nand what may be called Pelting Spirits (PoUergeister) are certainly\nmost strongly believed in. Houses are left uninhabited on account of\nphenomena of the classes referred to, and I myself once lived for many\ni The Folk-Lore Society.\n2 For many of the notes, and for much valuable assistance in the compiling of\nthis paper, I am indebted to Mr. N. W. Thomas.\n\fXLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 291\nmonths in a Malay house which, according to the Malays, was unmis\ntakably haunted.\nOf spirit-writing and levitation, no purely Malay accounts are yet to\nhand. It would be unsafe to assume the absence of the first till we\nknow for certain if there is any really automatic form of planchette\npractised in China, beside the case described by Professor Giles as long\nago as 1879, in which a poem was composed for the writers. As to\nthe second, there are many references in Malay literature to the flying\nperformances of Malayan heroes, whilst to this day it is alleged in\nSelangor that people possessed by the Pontianak ! (one of the tremen\ndous birth-demons of Malay tradition), acquire supernatural powers,\nenabling them to climb trees of immense height and to walk in\nsafety along branches which are no thicker than a man's thumb, a\nmanifest impossibility under normal conditions. A similar power is\nalso claimed for the young girls who perform what the Malays call\nthe Monkey-dance, in which, however, they are possessed by the\nMonkey-spirit.\nThe burning of incense and recital of a charm called Piruang enables\nMalay magicians to walk upon water without sinking in it beyond the\nankles. A similar charm in the case of the Malay form of ordeal by\ndiving enables the innocent party to remain under water for an\nincredible period, which, according to the Malays, sometimes extended\nto \"almost\" three-quarters of an hour, in fact in some cases (it was\ndeclared) he would remain under water until the spectators lost\npatience and dragged him out, whereas the guilty party begins to\nchoke immediately. A magician from Perak informed me once that he\nhad used the power of causing a sandbank to rise at sea between his\nown boat and that of his pursuers. I at once made him a sporting\noffer of twenty dollars if he would give me an exhibition of it, but he\ninformed me that it could only be done when he was really in danger,\nand not for \" swagger.\" The same man, moreover, claimed to possess\n'In the Malay Peninsula the Pontianak (or Mati-anak) is usually distinguished\nas the ghost of a child who baa died at birth, the ghost of a woman who has died\nin child-birth being called \"langsuir,\" and credited with all the attributes which\nelsewhere belong to the Pontianak. Cf. Col. J. Low on Siamese customs in\nJ. A. I., vol. i., p. 361, which I had not seen when I wrote to the above effect in\nMalay Magic, pp. 318 and 327. There is no doubt that the two are often\nconfused, but the belief in the langsuir, as distinguished from the Pontianak, is\ncertainly the usual explanation in the Peninsula. [Cf. Kruijt in Hed. .iVerf. Zend.,\nxzxix., p. 17, and xlii., p. 433; also Riedel, 57, 58, 81, 184, 239, 267 (and in\nseveral other passages), though in none of these is the langsuir once mentioned.\nN.

[PART\nthe power of clairvoyance, but failed in an easy test which he himself\nproposed.\nThe first class of spiritualistic ceremonies, which happens to be the\none to which I specially wish to direct your attention to-night, consists\nof a simple form of automatism, as represented by the movements of\ninert objects. No form of table-turning is of course practised by the\nMalays, who pass their lives for the most part in scattered communities,\neither in the jungle or at sea, and who do not therefore make any\nappreciable use of such luxuries as tables and chairs. Nevertheless a\nfairly close parallel to our own table-turning exhibitions may be found\nin the dance-ritual of inanimate objects which the Malay magicians\nexhibit, though we do not as yet possess any clue as to the real purpose\nof such performances.\nA second class of automatisms, allied in form to these dances,\nincludes a large number of ways of divining by means of the\napparently intelligent movements of inanimate objects in contact with\nthe magician.\nA third class, which requires to be distinguished to some extent\nfrom automatic phenomena, consists mainly of ceremonies by which\ncertain demons, animals, or even inert objects are made to act upon\npersons at a distance. This kind of ceremony corresponds to what is\nusually known as a \" sending.\"\nThe fourth and last class of ceremonies to which I shall refer includes\nsuch rites as are intended to induce possession either for divinatory\npurposes or for that of exorcism. These four classes will now be taken\nin the order in which I have mentioned them.\nI. In the first class of motor automatisms I place those ceremonies of\nwhich the purpose does not lie on the surface, and can only be inferred\nby the European observer.\nThe Palm-blossom Dance is a very curious exhibition, which I once\nsaw performed in the Langat district of Selangor. Two freshly-\ngathered sprays of areca-blossom, each about four feet in length, were\ndeposited upon a new mat near a tray containing a censer and three\nspecial kinds of sacrificial rice. No particular season was specified.\nThe magician ('\u2022 Che Ganti \" by name) commenced the performance by\nplaying a prelude on his violin, and a few minutes later Che Ganti's\nwife (an aged Selangor woman) took some of the sacrificial rice in her\nhand and began to chaunt a weird sort of invocation, addressed to the\nseven sister spirits, probably the souls of the palm. She was almost\nimmediately joined in the chaunt by a younger woman. The invoca\ntion consists of four separate sets of seven stanzas, each stanza con\n\fXLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 293\ntaining four short lines, which rhyme alternately. The first set begins\nas follows :\n\" Thus I brace up, I brace up the palm-blossom,\nAnd summon the elder sister to descend by herself.\nThus I brace up, I brace up the palm-blossom,\nAnd summon the second sister to descend with the first.\"\nThe same words are repeated mutatis mutandis until all seven sisters\nhave been summoned to descend, the witch then covers the two sprays\nof palm-blossom with a Malay plaid skirt or wrapper and five cubits of\nwhite cloth, folded double and fumigated. The chaunt now changes\nabruptly into the second set of seven stanzas :\n\" Borrow a hammer, borrow an anvil to forge the neckbones\nof this- our sting-ray (i.e. the sheaf of blossom).\nBorrow an orchard, borrow a courtyard,\nTo bring down upon earth the fairy sisters. \"\nSix stanzas follow, in which the names of six other parts of the\nsting-ray, i.e. the head, wings, tail, gills, etc., are successively substi\ntuted. At this point rice is thrown over one of the two sprays, its\nsheath is opened, and the contents fumigated. Then the old woman\ntakes the newly-fumigated spray between her hands, holding it upright\nat the base with her hands just resting on the ground, and the third\nset of stanzas commences with the words :\n\" Dig up, O dig up the wild ginger-plant,\nDig till you get a finger's breadth or two of it.\nSeek for, 0 seek for a magnificent domain\nInto which to bring down the fairy sisters.\"\nThe remaining six stanzas of this set are similar to the first, with\nvariations appropriate to each one of the six remaining spirits. During\nthe chaunting of this third set, the erect spray of Palm-blossom, held\nbetween the witch's bands, commenced swaying, at first almost imper\nceptibly, to the tune of the music, its motion becoming more and more\naccentuated as the chaunt proceeded.\nThe last set of stanzas proceeded with the words :\n\" Bear on high the betel-rack, bear on high the betel-dish,\nBear them on high in the midst of the pleasure garden.\nCome hither, my love, come hither, my life,\nCome hither and seat yourself in the courtyard centre. \"\nThe last six stanzas vary only in the invitations addressed to the\nspirits, which are requested to ascend the house-ladder and wash their\nfeet, to take their seat upon the mats that are spread for them, and to\nenjoy to the full the good things (e.g. betel-leaf, etc.) which their\nu\n\f294 Walter Skeat. [PART\nhosts have provided for their refreshment. The invitation concludes\nwith an appeal to the spirits not to be too rough, but to be mild and\ngentle, and as its wailing notes die away, it is believed that the seven\nspirits descend and \" perch \" like birds ulxm the palm-blossom. At\nthis point the fiddle stopped and tambourines were substituted, the\nspray of blossom forthwith proceeding to jump about on its base, as\nif it were indeed possessed, until it eventually dashed itself violently\ndown upon the mat-covered floor of the dwelling.i\nAfter one or two repetitions of this performance, with Che Ganti's\nwife as the medium, other persons present (myself amongst them) were\ninvited to try their luck with it, and did so with varying success, which\ndepended, I was told, upon the impressionability of their souls, as the\npalm-blossom spray would not dance for any one whose soul was not\nimpressionable. I myself must unfortunately have been one of these\npeople, as I never experienced the slightest tremor, and the palm-\nblossom remained motionless until I got tired of waiting, and moved it\nmyself, when my doing so was of course hailed as the manifest work of\nthe spirit.\nWhen the first blossom-sheaf had been destroyed by the rough treat\nment which it had to undergo (as each time at the conclusion of the\ndance it was dashed upon the ground), the second was duly fumigated\nand introduced to the company, and finally the performance was\nbrought to a close by chaunting a set of stanzas in which the spirits\narc requested to return to their own place. These latter commenced\nas follows :\n\" I slip the palm-blossom, I slip it,\nI slip it into the white bowl,\nEscort the fairies, escort them,\nEscort them unto the white heaven.\"\nThe remaining stanzas are precisely similar, with the exception of the\ncolours assigned to the bowl and the heavens, which are described\nsuccessively as black, green, blue, red, purple, and yellow. The two\nsheaves were then carried out of the house and deposited on the\nground underneath a banana-tree. I was told that if this closing part\nof the performance were not carried out with scrupulous care the\nspirits would not leave the house, and its inmates would be strange in\ntheir head for days, even if, indeed, none of them went mad.\nThe Dancing Fish-trap is a spiritualistic performance in which a fish-\ni If I remember rightly Che Ganti's wife retained her hold of the spray until\nit had dashed itself upon the ground two or three times, when she dropped it\nand let it lie.\n\fXLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 295\ntrap (lukah) is employed instead of the spray of palm-blossom, and a\ndifferent invocation is used. The fish-trap, moreover, is dressed up\nmuch in the same way as one of our own \"scare-crows,\" so as to\npresent a rude sort of resemblance to the human figure. Its \" dress \"\nconsists of a woman's jacket and plaid skirt (sarong), both of which\nshould (if possible) have been worn previously. A stick is then run\nthrough the upper part of the trap to take the arms of the jacket and\na cocoanut-shell (preferably a sterile one) is clapped on the top to serve\nas the fish-trap's head. The trap, when fully dressed, is held a few\ninches above the ground by two or three people, each of whom applies\nboth his hands to the bottom of the Fish-trap, in a manner similar to\nthat employed in our own table-turning performances, and the invoca\ntion is forthwith chaunted in the same manner and to the same accom\npaniment as that used in the palm-blossom performance. At the close\nof the invocation the magician whispers, so to speak, into the fish-trap's\near, bidding it not to disgrace him, but rise up and dance; and\npresently the fish-trap begins to rock to and fro, and to leap about\nin a manner which, of course, proves it to be possessed by the\nspirits.\nOf the Dancing-Spoon of the Malays we are told in Primitive Culture,\nii., 152: \"Mr. Darwin saw two Malay women on Keeling Island, who\nheld a wooden spoon, dressed in clothes like a doll ; this spoon had\nbeen carried to the grave of a dead man, and becoming inspired at full\nmoon, in fact lunatic, it danced about convulsively, like a table or a\nhat at a modern spirit seance.\" This is of course an automatism, not\na case of movement without contact.\nII. In the next class I place those motor automatisms in which a\ndefinite purpose, easily discernible by the uninitiated, is consciously\npursued. In this case also the objects are put in motion by the\nunconscious muscular action of those in contact with them.\nThe Divining Lemon.\u2014For divinatory purposes the Penang Malay\ntakes a \" rough-coated \" lemon, a hen's egg, a wax taper, four bananas,\nfour cigarettes, four rolled-up quids of betel-leaf, several handfuls of\nsacrificial rice, one of the prickles of a thorn-back mudfish, a needle\nwith a torn eye (selected from a packet containing a score of needles,\nout of which, however it must be the only one so damaged), and a\ncouple of small birches made of the leaf-ribs of palms\u2014one with seven\ntwigs and the other with twelve. From among the foregoing articles,\nwith the exception of the lemon, the fish-prickle, and the needle, two\nequal portions are made up, one portion, together with the birch of\n\f296 Walter Skeat. [PART\nseven twigs, being deposited under a tree outside the house. When\ndeposited, the egg must be cracked, and the cigarettes and the taper\nbe lighted. The taper is then taken up between the outspread fingers\nof the joined hands, and \" waved \" slowly towards the right, centre,\nand left. It is then deposited on the ground, and the taper presently\ncommences to burn blue, this being regarded as an \"acknowledgment\"\non the part of the spirit. The fish-prickle and the needle are now thrust\nhorizontally through the lower part of the lemon, at right angles to each\nother, and left so that their four ends arc slightly projecting. A\nsilken cord of seven different-coloured strands is then slipped round\nthese ends, and serves as a means of suspending the lemon over the\nbrazier of incense, the upper end of the cord being held in the left hand\nand the birch in the right. Everything being prepared, the magician,\nafter the customary scattering of rice and fumigation of the birch and\nthe lemon, recites the appropriate charm, and presently commences to\nput questions to the lemon, which the spirit is now supposed to have\nentered, rebuking and threatening it with the birch whenever it fails\nto answer directly and to the point. The spirit's conversational\npowers were, however, extremely limited, being confined to two signs\nexpressing \"Yes\" and \"No.\" The affirmative was indicated by a\npendulum-like swing of the lemon, which rocked to and fro with more\nor less vehemence according to the emphasis with which the reply was\nsupposed to be delivered. The negative, on the other hand, was\nindicated by a complete cessation of motion on the part of the lemou.\nWhen the lemon is required to discover the name of a thief, the names\nof all those who are at all likely to have committed the theft are\nwritten on scraps of paper and arranged in a circle round the brazier,\nwhen the lemon will at once swing in the direction of the name of the\nguilty party. The most propitious night for the performance of this\nceremony is believed to be a Tuesday.\nThe Cup and King Ordeal.\u2014Another and perhaps a commoner form\nof the foregoing ordeal is described by Maxwell, as follows : \" Suppos\ning that a theft has taken place in a house, all the inmates are\nassembled, and their names are written on the edge of a white cup, on\nwhich some sentences of the Koran are also inscribed. A ring is then\nsuspended by a maiden's hair and held right over the middle of the\ncup. It is then swung round gently, and the name which it first\nstrikes is the name of the thief.\"\nIn a slightly different form of the divination, the instrument is a\nbowl, which is filled with water and covered over with a white cloth,\non which the scraps of paper with the names arc successively deposited.\n\fXLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 297\nThe bowl is supported by two men on their knuckles, and a passage\nfrom the Koran is read. When the scrap of paper containing the\nname of the thief is laid on the cloth covering, the bowl twists itself\noff the men's knuckles, and falls to the ground with a crash.\nThe Sieve Ordeal.\u2014In some cases a sieve (nuiru) is similarly used.\nMystic sentences are written upon it with turmeric, and when all the\nhousehold is assembled a man grasps the sieve by the edge and holds\nit out horizontally. Presently it is seen to commence oscillating up\nand down, and pulls away from the man who is holding it, the latter\nfollowing its lead until it reaches and touches the thief.\nThe Divining-rod.\u2014The last object of this class is the Malay divining-\nro<i, which is similarly gifted with the power of making supernatural\nmovements. This is a rod or birch of rotan sega (the best marketable\nvariety of cane), which may consist either of a single stem, or of any\nodd number of stems up to nine. The handle of the rod or rods is\nbound with a hank of \" Javanese \" yarn, which may or may not be\nstained yellow. The sorcerer who wishes to use it grasps the butt-end\nof the rod in his right fist, and after burning incense and scattering\nsacrificial rice, repeats the appropriate charm, which commences with\na summons to the spirit to descend from the mountains and enter into\nhis embodiment. If the invocation is properly performed, the spirit\ndescends, and entering the sorcerer's head by way of the fontanel,\nproceeds down his arm and into the rod itself. The result is that the\ntip of the rod commences to rotate with rapidly increasing velocity,\nuntil the sorcerer loses consciousness, in which case the rod will point\nin the direction of any sort of lost or hidden treasure, which it may be\nthe object of the operators to discover. Even underground water\ncould, I was assured, be thus discovered.\nIII. We now come to the third class\u2014that of demons, animals,\nand even inert objects, which are made to act on persons at a distance\n\u2014a class which as I have already said includes sendings of every\ndescription.i\nSendingx.\u2014One form of sending is described as follows : '\u2022 When\none individual has animosity against another, he constructs a dagger\nupon magic principles, and recites a prayer over it. Then, if his\nadversary lives at a distance, the sorcerer, seizing the dagger by the\ni [The magician is regarded (sometimes at any rate) as sending his magic bone\nor stone in propria persona into the body of his enemy. Cf. Nys, Chez ley\nAbarambos, p. 117.

[PART\nhandle, stabs with the point in the direction of his enemy, whereupon\nthe latter immediately falls sick. Blood gathers on the point of the\ndagger, and this the man sucksi exclaiming: 'Now I am satisfied,'\nwhilst his adversary becomes speechless and expires.\"\nAnother form of Tujv, in which the bow appears to have been\nemployed as the instrument, was related to me by a Malay magician\nas follows : If you wish to abduct another person's soul, you must go\nout of the house either at daybreak or \" when the newly-risen moon\nlooks red,\" and standing with the big toe of the right foot resting upon\nthe big toe of the left, make a trumpet by putting your right hand\nbefore your mouth, and recite through it the charm, which runs as\nfollows :\n\"Om, I loose my shaft, I loose it, and the moon clouds over,\nI loose it and the sun is extinguished,\nI loose it and the stars burn dim.\nYet I shoot not at sun, moon, or stars,\nBut at the heart-strings of a child of the human race, so-and-so.\nCluck, cluck ! soul of so-and-so.\nCome and walk with me,\nCome and sit with me,\nCome and sleep, and share my pillow.\"\nThe text of this charm would, I think, be conclusive proof, even if\nthere were no other, that the form of magic called arrow-sending, or\nrather arrow-pointing, was formerly in vogue among Malay magicians.\nThe next three sendings are taken from an old but valuable\nauthority on the Peninsula named Begbie. One form of sending it is\ncalled the Tuju Jantong, or the \" heart-sending \" ; jantong being the\nMalay name both for the human heart and also for the cordiform top\nof the newly-opened bunch of bananas. The person who employs this\nform of witchcraft has to search for one of these cordiform tops and\nperform a magic rite under it. He next has to tie the banana-top, and\nhaving recited a prayer over it, burns the point which communicates\nwith the heart of his adversary, inflicting excruciating agony. When\nhe is tired of tormenting him he cuts the jantong, and the man's heart\nsimultaneously drops from its proper situation, blood issuing from the\nmouth of the expiring sufferer.\nIn the remaining instances, the sendings apparently consisted of\ninsects.2 The Tuju Jindang is a kind of sending in which the sorcerer\ni [Cf. Lex Mixsions Catholiquea, 1893, p. 345. N.W.T.]\n2 [Cf. Martius, Zur. Eth.

It partakes of the appear\nance of the silkworm. Its keeper directs it to attack the enemy,\nsaying : \" Go and devour the heart and entrails of so-and-so,\" or words\nto that effect, whereupon it departs and flies against the ill-fated\nindividual, entering generally either at the back of the hand or between\nthe shoulders. At the moment of contact a sensation is produced as if\na bird had flown against one's body, but it is invisible, and the only\nsign of its presence is the livid hue of the spot where it has entered.\nOn entering, it forthwith performs its mission, inflicting intolerable\ntorment. The body gradually becomes blue, and the victim expires.\nOne of the spirits most dreaded by the Malays is the Polong, whose\nshape is described as resembling nothing in the animal world, but\nwhose head is formed very much like the handle of a kris ; the eyes\nbeing situated at either end of the cross-guard, and the upper part\nof the blade representing the neck, from the extremity of which branch\nout two spinous leg-like processes, running nearly parallel with its\nspiral filiform body, widening out at the insertion, and gradually\napproximating at the extremities ; at least such is the form of the\nPolong which a Malay physician and dealer in the black art will\nrudely sketch if requested to do so. It is difficult to believe, although\nwe are so assured, that this demon with whose figure the Malays\nare so well acquainted, is nevertheless always invisible. It is death by\nthe Malayan code to keep one, but it is nevertheless asserted that\nseveral females are in the habit of doing so, as the possession of a\nPolong imparts exquisite beauty to its owner, even though she be\nnaturally ugly. The men seldom keep one of these spirits unless\nthey have some revenge to gratify, though occasionally they keep them\nfor hire by others. The Polong is kept in a small earthen bottle, whose\nneck is sufficiently wide to permit the introduction of a finger. As it\nfeeds upon human blood, its keeper cuts his finger once or twice a week,\neither on Friday or Monday night, and inserts it in the bottle for the\nPolong to suck. Should this be neglected the demon issues from his\nconfinement and sucks the whole body until it becomes black and blue.\nDirectly any one is attacked by a Polong, he either screams out, and\nfalls down in a swoon, or becomes deathlike and speechless. Some\ntimes possession is shown by incoherent raving, and in other cases by\nacts of violence on the bystanders. Occasionally, even death itself\nensues. The Polong is under strict management, being obliged to\ninflict the punishment in that kind and. degree which his master\ndirects. The Malays say that this form of possession (like that of\n\f300 . Walter Skeat. [PART\nwerwolfismi) ia infectious, at least in some cases, as people who have\nbeen so incautious as to ask the sufferer the simple question, \" What\nis the matter 1 Have you got a Polong 1 \" are instantly affected in a\nsimilar manner. Mr. Thompson (of Singapore) saw a man who posi\ntively assured him that he had seen no less than twenty individuals\nthus seized at the same time.\nThe soothsayer or physician is called in to the patient in order to\nexorcise the spirit. He draws a representation of it in a white basin,\nand pouring water on to it, desires the patient to drink the same. He\nthen holds the ends of the possessed person's thumbs, in order to\nprevent the escape of the Polong (that being the door by which it makes\nits exits and entrances), and questions it as to its motives for tormenting\nthe individual. Having received its replies through the mouth of the\npossessed, he proceeds to search all over the body for the lurking place\nof the spirit, which, notwithstanding its invisibility, is supposed to be\nperfectly tangible, and to be lodged between the skin and the flesh.'-*\nAs soon as the magician has discovered the spot in which the Polong\nis concealed, he exacts an oath of it to the effect that its previous\nreplies were true, and that it will never re-enter the body of the\nperson from whom it is about to be expelled. The sorcerer sometimes,\nindeed, exerts so great a power over the Polong, as to compel it to enter\ninto and destroy its own master.\nAccording to Malay accounts, the proper way to secure a Polong is\nto deposit the blood of a murdered man in a small bottle or flask, and\nrecite sundry conjurations over it for a period of seven or fourteen days,\nwhen a noise will be heard in the bottle resembling the chirping of\nyoung birds. The operator then cuts his finger and inserts it into the\nbottle, when the Polong sucks it. This \"is repeated daily, and the\nperson who thus supports the Polong is called its father, if a man, or its\nmother, if she happens to be a woman.3\nThe Polong is, I was assured, invariably preceded by its pet or\nplaything, the Pelesil,* which appears to be usually identified with a\nspecies of house-cricket, of which I was once shown a specimen by a\nMalay in a small glass bottle or phial. Whenever the Polong is\ncommissioned by its adopted parents to attack a new victim, it sends\ni [Cf. Tijfah-ift, xli., 458. N.W.T.]\n1 [Something analogous appears to be the Japanese belief in possession by foxes,\nwhich enter the body under the finger-nails. N.W.T.]\na Another Malay superstition is that the blood of murdered men turns into\nfireflies ; cf. Malay Magic, 329.\n4 [Cf. Journal Indian Archi^lago, 307: J. A. I., xxiv., 288. N.W.T.]\n\fXLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 301\nthe Pelesit on 'before' it, 'and as soon as the latter, flying along in a\nheadlong fashion, usually tail foremost, enters .its victim's body and\nbegins to chirrup, the Polmg follows.\nThe Pelesit appears to be occasionally kept either as a substitute\nfor, or as actually identical with, the Polong, and I was told that it was,\nlike the Pobng, occasionally caught and kept in a bottle, and fed\neither with parched rice or with rice stained yellow with turmeric, or\nwith blood drawn from the tip of the fourth finger, and that when its\nowner desired to get rid of it, it was buried in the ground. One of\nthe most widely recognised ways of securing a Pelesit, which is regarded\nin some parts of the Peninsula as a valuable species of property,\nconsists in exhuming the body of a child and carrying it at full moon to\nan ant-hill, where it is reanimated and presently lolls out its tongue ;\nwhen this happens the tongue must be bitten oft' and buried in a place\nwhere three roads meet, when it will eventually develop into a Pelesit.i\nThe Polong is also sometimes identified or confused with a familiar\nspirit called Bajang in Kedah, which appears, .however, to .have\noriginally been regarded as an entirely distinct conception, since its\nusual embodiment is stated to have been a polecat or rather civet cat.\nWe have, then, in the list of Malay familiar spirits, the Polong (or\nBajang) and its plaything or messenger the Pelesit, the latter of which\noccasionally appears to be actually regarded in some cases as the Polong's\nembodiment, although it is more usually considered as distinct from the\nPolong. During the Cambridge Expedition of 1899 we came more than\nonce on the track of these peculiar demons. At a village near\nTrengganu I succeeded, by some strategy, in obtaining a snapshot of a\nwoman who kept a familiar spirit, but most probably she guessed that\nsomething was up, for next morning my Malay friend who had helped\nto arrange the matter came and told me she had just been to see him,\nand had complained that she had dreamed that a great white\nmagician from over the sea had stolen away her soul. I sent her a\npresent of a little gold dust which I had recently purchased, but even\nthen she was only pacified with difficulty, as she complained I had not\nsent her quite enough of it.\nIt is interesting to note the symptoms displayed by the supposed\nvictims of the demons I have just been describing. In various Malay\naccounts we are told that a person possessed by a Polong, whether a\nvirgin or a married woman, either falls into a death-like swoon, or cries\nout and loses consciousness of what he (or she) is doing, and tears and\ni [Cf. Crooke, Introduction, p. 360. For magic properties of tougue, cf. Report\nBnr. Eth., 1881-2, p. Ill ff. N.W.T.]\n\f302 Walter Skeat. [PART\nthrows off his or her clothing, biting and striking bystanders, and blind\nand deaf to everything. A certain sign that one of these fits is coming\non is for the sick person to rave about .cats. When the Polon-g has been\nexorcised, the sick person at once recovers consciousness, but is left\nweak and feeble ; but if the means adopted for exorcising it are un\nsuccessful, the person who is attacked yells and shrieks in anger, and\nafter a day or two dies. After death blood comes bubbling forth from\nthe mouth, and the whole body is blue with bruises.\nAt a place on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula I came across a\ndifferent belief, viz., that in a particular species of vampire. At Patani,\none of the members of the expedition (Mr. Gwynne-Vaughan) informed\nme that he was walking down the main street of the town when he was\nstopped and asked if he wished to see some skulls. He had the pre\nsence of mind to reply in the affirmative, and was taken outside the\ntown and there shown two skulls which had been feeding, it was\nalleged, upon the soul of a Malay woman. I myself then went to see\nthem, and bought the two skulls for a couple of dollars, and brought\nthem home.\nThose who are familiar with T. Lockwood Kipling's fine work on\nMan and Beast in India will doubtless remember the beautiful specimens\nwhich he gives of the caligraphic pictures of which oriental penmen are\nBO fond. Pictures of this kind are occasionally employed by Malay\nmagicians for various objects, and form one of the methods adopted for\nguarding a house against the entry of the familiar spirits of which I\nhave been speaking They consist, as in India, of the names of God\nand of various prophets, and prayers cleverly woven into a design,\nwhich is believed to furnish a complete protection against the spirits\nreferred to.\nIV. Of the ceremonies of the fourth class, viz. Possession and Devil-\ndancing, I have seen, perhaps, altogether about half a dozen perform\nances, though I need scarcely remark that it is a most difficult task\nfor a European to obtain permission to attend such ceremonies at all,\nand it can only be done by possessing a strong friend (so to speak)\nat court.\nAt these performances the magician and a large number of his friends\nand relations being assembled in the sick man's house, the magician\nseats himself on the ground facing an attendant who chaunts the invo\ncation, accompanying himself upon the Malay three-stringed viol.\nAfter much burning of benzoin and scattering of sacrificial rice the\nspirit descends, entering the magician's body through the fontancl.\nThe magician is at once seized with convulsive twitchings which seem\n\fXLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 303\nto spread all over his body, and these are accompanied by a rapid\nrotatory motion of the head, which he makes revolve from right to left\nat a tremendous pace,i shaking at the same time his shoulders and\nthighs, and getting more and more violent until the whole body is\nquaking like a jelly, thus producing an almost painfully vivid imitation\nof an epileptic fit. Soon, however, he falls down in a state of what is\ndoubtless real exhaustion, and after an interval rises again and com\nmences to dance. The entire process is repeated several times ; and a\nquiet interval then follows, during which the magician, sitting on the\nground, replies in a high, squeaky, unnatural voice to any questions\nthat may be put to him, not merely as regards the welfare of his\npatient, but even as regards private and personal matters, which are of\ninterest only to the patient's friends and relations. In the course of\nthis catechism the magician expounds the cause and nature of the sick\nman's illness, as well as the remedies which should be adopted for his\nrecovery.\nAmong the oracles thus delivered at a performance attended by Mr.\nF. F. Laidlaw and myself in Kelantan, there was one which is perhaps\nwell worth recording. We had arranged next day to attend a Malay\nbull-fight, to which we had been invited by His Highness the Raja\nMuda. These bull-fights are not fought on the unequal lines of the\nspectacles called by that name in civilised Europe, but consist of a fight\non equal terms between two powerful and carefully trained bulls, which\nseldom do each other or any one else much injury, and which as exhibi\ntions of strength are exciting to watch. During the catechising of the\nmagician to which I have alluded, he was asked to give what I believe\nis called the \"straight tip\" as to the probable winner of next day's\ncontest, and gave as his selection a bull named Awang Eanggong. On\nthe following afternoon Mr. Laidlaw and I were sitting on the dais\nnext to His Highness, and when the bulls were brought on the field\nHis Highness asked me which bull I thought looked most likely to win.\nRemembering the sorcerer's tip, I replied \" Awang Eanggong,\" though\nI did not know one bull from the other, and in the result \" Awang\nKanggong \" certainly won hands down, breaking his opponent's horn in\na few rounds and driving him off the field in most ignominious fashion.\nThe sorcerer's reputation as a good \" judge of cattle \" naturally went\nup, though I must confess that it would take a great deal more proof\nthan was actually forthcoming to make me believe that there could\nhave been anything supernormal about the sorcerer's tip.

(Part xxx. 1897, Vol. xn. pp. 45-115) Mr.\nPodmore contributed an article on \"Poltergeists.\" After analysing\neleven then recent cases, he found common trickery detected in four,\nand confessed in three instances, and he inferred that trickery was the\n\" true and sufficient explanation,\" probably in the whole set. In much\nthe most curious example (1) that of Worksop, in 1883, the witnesses\nwere \" imperfectly educated, and did not give their testimony till some\nweeks after the event.\" In a little discussion with Mr. Podmore, I\npointed out that some witnesses, including a policeman of sceptical\ncharacter, gave evidence at the time of the events, and I published that\ntestimony extracted from the local newspaper of the date.i The interval\nof some weeks before the persons were re-examined had produced no\nadditional marvels. I am rather inclined to doubt, as will later be\nshown, whether memory, after a lapse of time, is always so mythopoeic,\nso apt to exaggerate, as Mr. Podmore believes : and we know that,\namong the educated, memory is often inclined to minimize extraordinary\noccurrences. A case in point is that of Lord Fortescue, who, as a very\nold man, about 1850, denied that he had heard of the wicked Lord\nLyttelton's ghost story, though he was in the house when Lord\nLyttelton died. Yet Lady Mary Coke, in her journal (privately\nprinted by the Earl of Home) for the date, tells the tale on the\nauthority of Lord (then Mr.) Fortescue. Lord Chesterfield said that,\nif a man indubitably rose from the dead, in three days the Arch\nbishop of Canterbury would disbelieve it. Probably most of us\nknow that, if anything very much out of the usual has come into\nour experience, we gradually distrust our own impressions, and\nreason the matter away. But the opposite process is doubtless the\nmore common, especially among the imaginative. By dint of excluding\ni In The Making of Religion, pp. 353-358.\n\f306 Andrew Lang.

To myself the uniformity of hallu\ncination, in many places and ages, as to the peculiar and non-natural\nflight of objects, appeared a thing difficult of belief. Therefore, while\nadmitting the force of the case for trickery in all such instances,\u2014our\nfirst, most natural, and most probable explanation,\u2014I do not feel\nabsolutely convinced that it is the only explanation. But I have no\nother theory to propound, and only wish to keep a door open for some\nother undiscovered cause.\nIn March and June, 1899, Mr. Podmore returned to the theme, in\nthe Journal of the Society. (Vol. IX. p. 37 and p. 91). i\nMr. Alfred Kussel Wallace had suggested the examination of several\nhistorical cases of unexplained disturbances, historically recorded.\nThese can never be satisfactorily analysed. We cannot cross-examine\nwitnesses : we cannot even examine the scenes of the events, in many\ncases. Moreover few of Mr. Wallace's instances were such as I should\nhave selected. He omitted the case of Mrs. Kickett's house,\u2014Hinton,\nnear Arlesford,\u2014attested by that lady, and observed by Lord St. Vincent.\nThe house was pulled down, and it would be unfair to mention some\nmodern facts which may, perhaps, be germane to the matter. Mr.\nWallace also omitted the Willington Mill case, to which, therefore, Air.\nPodmore did not refer. The Tedworth, Cideville (1851), and Epworth\ncases remain, and, if only as folk-lore and history, are deserving of\nsome comments. An early, sceptical, and acute psychical researcher,\nthe Kev. Joseph Glanvil, F.K.S., wrote on the Tedworth case, which\nhe had investigated. We must regret that Mr. Glanvil was so un\nmethodical that his observations are of slight value. I quote Mr.\nPodmore's criticisms of the Tedworth affair. (Journal S.P.R Vol. ix.\np. 39.)\nThe Drummer of Tedworth, as told by Glanvil. The disturbances\nbegan \"about the middle of April,\" 1661 (Glanvil only gives two exact\ndates in the whole narrative), and continued for about two years.\nGlauvil's account of it, as we learn from the preface to the fourth (posthu\nmous) edition of Sadducumus Triumphatus, was first published in 1666.\ni Mr. Podmore'a criticisms have since been reprinted, with slight modifications,\nin his Modern Sjnritualism : A History and a Criticism, Vol. I. pp. 25-43\n(Methuen&Co.).\n\fXLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 307\nGlanvil himself paid one visit to the house \"about this time \"\u2014the last date\ngiven, on the previous page, being January 10th, 1662. Glauvil's account of\nall he saw and heard is, in brief, as follows :\u2014On hearing from a maid\nservant that \" it was come,\" he, with Mr. Mompesson and another, went up to\na bedroom ; \"there were two little modest Girls in the Bed, between seven\nand eleven Years old, as I guest.\" Glanvil heard a scratching in the bed \" as\nloud as one with long Nails could make upon a Bolster.\" This lasted for half-\nan-honr and more, and Glanvil could not discover the cause ; it was succeeded\nby a panting, like a dog, accompanied by movements in the bedding ; also\nthe windows shook ; also Glanvil saw a movement in a \" Linnen Bag \" that\nhung against another bed, but was not apparently sufficiently sure of the\naccuracy of his observation to mention this incident in the first (1668)\nedition. Further, Glanvil was aroused by an untimely knocking next\nmorning ; and his horse fell ill on the way home, and died 2 or 3 days later.\nThis is the only detailed account which we have at first hand ; it is written\n5 or 6 years after the events, and apparently not from full notes, as\nGlanvil is unable to give the exact dates.\nThe rest of the account is founded on the real relation of Mr. Mompesson,\nconfirmed by other witnesses, \" and partly from his own letters.\" There are\nalso two letters of Mompesson's, dated respectively 1672 and 1674. But he\ngives no detailed confirmation of Glanvil's account ; indeed, when the second\nletter was written he expressly says that he had lent Glanvil's book \" for the\nuse of the Lord Hollis,\" the previous year, and did not know what the account\ncontained. But even if we assume that Glanvil had accurately put down 5\nor 6 years later all that he had heard from Mompesson, it does not amount\nto much ; for it does not appear that Mompesson himself witnessed any of\nthe more marvellous incidents\u2014the drops of blood, the chairs moving by\nthemselves, \" the great Body with two red and glaring eyes,\" and all the rest\nof it. These things were witnessed by neighbours, by men-servants, or by\naii undistributed \" they.\" So that Glanvil's account of them may be third\nhand or tenth hand.\nNow the first known edition of Glanvil's Considerations about Witch\ncraft is of 1666.

The Bailiff informed him that he\nwas a stranger going for Portsmouth, having a Pass under the hands and\nseals of two of his Majeste's Justices of Peace for the County of Wilts for\nhis passing to Portsmouth, and to be allowed and relieved in his journey ;\nand that he had been requiring money of them, and they were col lectiug\nmoney for him.\nHe this Informant saith, that suspecting him to be a Cheat, he desired the\nOfficer of the Town to send for him, which accordingly he did, and examining\nhim how he dar'd go up and down in that way beating his Drum, and\nrequiring money ; he, this Informant, saith Drury answered I have good\nAuthority ; and produced a pretended Pass under the hands and seals as\naforesaid, Drury positively affirming it was their hands and seals. He this\nInformant saith, that knowing it to be counterfeit, he charged him with it,\nand was sending him before a Justice of Peace : and then Drury beggM, aiid\nconfess'd he made it : and upon his begging he let that pass. But he this\nInformant further saith he took away his Drum, which Drury was very\nunwilling to part with.\nHe this Infprmant saith, he left the Drum for some time after at\nDecember, later end, 1662.

And if they call to it, as several persons have, saying, Devil,\nKnocker or Drummer, come tell us if the man from whom the Drum was\ntaken be the cause of this, give three knocks, and no more ; and immediately\nthree loud knocks were given, and no more. After that, another time,\nCome tell us if the man from whom the Drum was taken be the cause of\nall this, by giving five knocks, and away ; and presently five very loud\nknocks were given, and away, and no more heard at that time.\nDrury's Examination as to this confesseth his being at Ludgurthal about\nthe time named, and his beating Drum there ; his false Pass, and that Mr.\nMompesson took away from him his Drum ; but denies that he hath any way\npractised witchcraft, or that he hath been any way the cause of that trouble.\nFor the Escape made by him, and the Charge given against him by Air.\nMompetaan of witchcraft, he was sent to the County-goal at Sarum, there to\nremain till the next Assizes. It may be observed that this Drury was about\nfour or five months since committed to Glocester-goal for felony ; and Mr.\nMompesson being informed he had several times in the gaol exprest himself\npleased at the report of the troubles in his house, saying, although the Drum\nbe burnt the Devil is not dead: and that he had better let me and my Drum\nalone : two or three days after the late Assizes holden there, resolved to go\ndown to Glocester, forty miles from his house, to inform himself what was\nbecome of Drury.\nThe night before he took his journey, a Drum beat in his stable, where it\nhad not been heard to beat before : and the morrow morning his Gelding\nbeing brought forth of the stable, was fain very lame ; but however, he went\nfor Glocester, and there was informed, as before related, that he (Drury)\nwas sent away for Virginia.\nMr. M\u00bbmpeston, being upon his return back from Glocester, in his way,\non Munday night last, lodged at a place called Droughton in this County,\nwithin two miles of Alscut. (?) On Thursday morning he was informed that the\nsaid Will. Drury came to his house at Mscut, (?) the Munday night, with a\nDrum at his back, and had beat it that night.

Drury was imprisoned\non an independent charge of felony at Gloucester about December\n1662 : was found guilty and sentenced to transportation ; escaped,\nand began to annoy Mr. Mompesson, who next accused him of witch\ncraft on April 15, 1663, at Salisbury. The ground of action was\nthe alleged use by Drury, when in gaol at Gloucester, of expressions\nconnecting him with the unexplained disturbances. The Grand Jury\nfound a true bill, but Drury was acquitted on trial for lack of\nevidence to connect him with the affair. Air. Mompesson, two or\nthree neighbouring gentlemen, and the parson of the parish, gave\nevidence, at Salisbury, to the phenomena. Unluckily, we have only\nMr. Mompesson's deposition : I have failed to discover the full\nrecords of the trial in MS. In the printed deposition, Mr. Mom\npesson does not say what he himself heard and saw ; he merely\ncomplains of \" knocking, great noises, scratching, troubling the beds,\"\nand so forth. There can be no moral doubt, perhaps, that Mr.\nMompesson and his witnesses attested their personal experiences of\nthese familiar phenomena. But their evidence is lost or inaccessible.\nThat Glanvil's tales about the disturbances, if not printed till 1666-\n1668, were current as early as 1662, and were not invented or even\nexaggerated between 1663 and 1666-1668, I can readily prove.\nThe earliest contemporary record known to me is a ballad i of the\nyear 1662, in which the disturbance at Tedworth began. This\nextremely inartificial poem was hunted out by Miss Elsie Alleyne\nat the Bodleian Library. It is earlier, if the printed date, 1662,\nbe correct, than the sworn deposition of Mr. Mompesson, of April 1 5,\n1663. The ballad gives details which are not in Mr. Mompesson's\nprinted statement, but are chronicled by Glanvil at least as early\nas 1 668 ; for example, the story of the bed staff which spontaneously\n\" went for \" the clergyman while he was praying.\nA wonder of wonders, being,\nA true solution of the strange and invisible beating of a Drum, at the house\nof John Mompesson, Esq., at Tedworth, in the county of Wiltshire, being\nabout 8 of the clock at night and continuing till 4 in the morning, several\ndays one after another, to the great admiration of many persons of Honour,\nGentlemen of quality, and many hundreds who had gone from several parts\nto hear this miraculous wonder, since the first tune it began to beat \" Round\nheads and Cuckolds, come dig, come dig.\" Also the burning of a drum that\ni A Wonder of Wonders.

[PART\nmight suppose that the nervous shock to the \"little modest girls\"\nunder eleven, caused them hysterically to feign the disturbances witnessed\nby Glanvil in their bedroom. Mr. Podmore disables Mr. Glanvil's\nevidence. He was far from being a stupid man, and the children\nwere so very young that I am unwilling to credit them with trickery.\nI think, too, that Glanvil published a tract on the affair as early as\n1663. In June, 1663, Mr. Pepys tells us \"there are books of it,\narid, they say, very true.\" I fancy that Glanvil was probably the\nauthor of one of \"these books of it,\" that he put his narrative later\ninto his Philosophical Considerations Touching Witches and Witchcraft,\nand that the ballad poet simply rhymed after Glanvil's prose (quarto,\n1666; folio, 1668). Till the \"books\" of 1662-1663 are discovered\nI must leave the drummer with a few remarks.\nI happen to know a modern parallel to Glanvil's alleged scratchings.\nA gentleman, distinguished in law and known in politics, informs me\nthat, going one day upstairs in his house in Maida Vale, he heard a\nviolent scratching, as if of a highly excited tiger on the outside, as\nhe deemed, of the nursery door. Eunning up he found two of his\nchildren (boys, one now grown up corroborated) and the nurse in\ngreat alarm. This accident kept recurring ; there were no marks\nor scratches on either side of the door. I was told this, as I\nsuggested that the nurse or the children had scratched the door\nwith a large comb. The owner of the house, being addressed by\nhis tenant, showed a nervous anxiety to evade the topic ; and my\nacquaintance discovered no explanation. This was his only encounter\nwith anything so much out of the common run of human experience.\nLet us, then, grant that the nurse laid a board of wood, procured for\nthat purpose, against the door, inside, and violently scratched it\nwith some instrument, \" with intent to deceive,\" and from a hysterical\ndesire of notoriety, which she did not obtain, as nobody connected\nher with the sounds. This explanation, in fact, did not occur to\nthe trained legal faculties of her employer.\nAs for the Mompesson children, the disturbances were worked by\nthem not only at night, but when put to bed \"in fair day.\" On\nGuy Fawkes' day, 1662, a board of wood kept going to and fro in\nthe day time, \"seen by a whole roomful of people,\" say Glanvil.\nMr. Cragg, the clergyman, who (with two other gentlemen) gave\nevidence at Drury's trial (April 15, 1663) prayed in the room, \"and\nthen, in sight of the company, the chairs walked about of them\nselves,\" so clever were these bad little girls in bed.i Mr. Mompesson\ni So also in thu ballad of 1662.\n\fXLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 315\nnow sent all the children but the eldest girl away, and took that\nimpostor, aged ten, into his own bedroom, where the drumming\n(the child being in bed) was as active as ever. She, I suppose, also\nkept plucking the bed clothes off the bed of the footman (Anthony) ;\nor the man said that this annoyance, so common in such cases,\noccurred. One child succeeded in making three distinct sets of noises\nin her bed, accompanied by wrigglings as of a living thing, in the\nbolster.\nThe Rev. Joseph Glanvil, apparently about March 1663 (the date\n1662 must be an error) then visited the house. \"There were two\nlittle modest girls in the bed\" (naughty little minxes) \"between\nseven and eleven years as I guessed. I saw their hands out of the\nclothes, and they could not contribute to the noise that was made\nbehind their heads.\" Mr. Glanvil little knew the artfulness of\nlittle girls. \"I searched under and behind the bed, turned up the\ncloaths to the Bed-cords, grasped the Bolster, sounded the wall, and\nmade all the search possible.\" A friend aided Glanvil in these\nstudies. A kind of panting noise, apparently under the bed, \"shook\nthe room and windows very considerably.\" This would be worked\nby collusion, some one in the \" cock loft \" above would be thumping\non the floor ; according to our theory.\nGlanvil had critics. He was told that he was in a fright and\nhallucinated. \"This is the Eternal Evasion,\" Glanvil replies. He\nasserts his perfect coolness, and the certainty of his observations.\nSometimes the children were forced to leave their beds and sit up\nall night, which, of course, was the very thing that little girls would\nenjoy. Glanvil's report, apart from his own experience, was taken\nfrom Mr. Mompesson's conversation and letters ; \" he being neither\nvain nor credulous, but a discreet, sagacious, and manly person.\"\nIn a letter of November 8, 1672, to Glanvil, Mr. Mompesson formally\ndenied that he had ever told the King, as was rumoured, that \"a\ncheat had been discovered about that affair\" (1). To do so, said\nhe, would be to perjure himself. He stuck (August 8, 1674) to his\nevidence, given at Salisbury, in April, 1663. \"The shaking of the\nFloor and strongest parts of the House in still and calm Nights,\"\nMr. Mompesson especially insisted on, as the ballad of 1662 also\ndoes. Perhaps no little girl could shake the strongest parts of the\nhouse, a phenomenon which was frequent, according to Robert\nChambers, in the case of D. D. Home. I have cited Glanvil mainly\nto show the harmony between his version, though late, and that of\nthe ballad of 1662. But, of course, the lateness of Glanvil's work,\n\f316 Andrew Lang. [PART\nand his inexplicable confusion of dates, do not increase our confidence\nin his narrative.\nThe Tedworth case, of course, is not evidential. But I think that\nmy praiseworthy researches have made it fairly clear that absolutely\ncontemporary accounts did not vary much from those of Glanvil in\n1666-1668 j that the 'deplorable ballad is probably versified from a lost\npamphlet of Glanvil's, or some other book almost identical ; that very\ntedious and wearying disturbances prompted Mr. Mompesson's con\ntemporary deposition, and those of his friends ; and that very young\nchildren could hardly have produced the disturbances, as described,\nwithout detection. The phenomena, again, were of the regular\npoltergeist or \"spiritualistic\" kind, and their true cause was never\ndiscovered. This may, perhaps, be reckoned an advance historically\non the results of Mr. Podmore's investigation ; but he, by the nature\nof Mr. Wallace's challenge, was perhaps limited to Glanvil's own\naccount. Otherwise he would have resorted to the proper Quelkn.\nThese do not wholly confirm his theory of unconscious exaggeration\nafter the interval of a few weeks or even years.\nTHE EPWORTH CASE.\nAs to the Wesley case at Epworth (December, 1716, April (?), 1717),\nMr. Podmore's criticism must be summarised. The evidence consists\nof letters (January-April, 1717), between young Sam Wesley, then at\nWestminster with Atterbury, and his mother, his father, and two of\nhis many sisters, at home. We have also an account written for the\ninquiring Sam by old Mr. Wesley ; it seems to have been completed by\nJanuary 24, and certainly was finished by February 11, 1717. There\nis also a brief diary of old Mr. Wesley's\u2014December 21, January 1,\n1716-1717. Next comes a set of narratives written in August-Septem\nber, 1726, at Epworth, for John Wesley (who had been at Charterhouse\nin 1717). The writers or narrators in 1726 are Mrs. Wesley, Emily,\nSukey, Nancy, Molly, Keziah, the Rev. Mr. Hoole, the man servant,\nand others. We need not look at a late narrative by John Wesley, a\nmagazine article.\nTaking the papers of 1716-1717, with those of 1726, Mr. Podmore\ndecides :\n(1) That in 1717, \"witnesses narrate of their own personal experience\nonly comparatively tame and uninteresting episodes.\"\n(2) \"They (1717) allow their imaginations to embellish somewhat\nthe experience of other members of the household.\"\n\fXLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 317\n(3) In 1726 these other members adopt the \"imaginative embellish\nments \" of 1 7 1 7 into their own first-hand accounts.\n(4) The witnesses (thanks to what I may call mythopoeic memory),\nmake, in 1726, additions to or amplifications of their narratives of\n1717.\nNow (1) the personal experiences, say, of Mr. Wesley, recorded in\n1717, are not tame, and are not uninteresting, I think, either com\nparatively or positively. He was thrice pushed about by \" an invisible\npower.\" Again, this, the oddest of all the phenomena (if Mr. Wesley\nwas not drunk, and I never heard that he drank too much), is told by\nhimself of himself, and is not alluded to by any other witness. More\nover, \" ' it ' rattled and thundered, behind and before him, in rooms\nlocked and unlocked\" (record of 1717).i\n(2), (3) In 1717 Mr. Wesley and Emily told Sam, about Mrs. Wesley,\nthings which she did not tell Sam in 1717, herself, but did tell Jack in\n1726. However, in the letters of Mrs. Wesley, Mr. Wesley, and Sam,\nin 1717, it is thrice averred that, in 1717, she \"forbore many\nparticulars,\" or did not tell \" one third \" of the circumstances.\nMr. Podmore omits this fact. In 1726, then, she merely did tell\na few of the things which, in 1717, others told, but she confessedly\n\" forbore.\" The story of the badger seen by Mrs. Wesley was told by\nEmily, in 1717. In 1726, Mrs. Wesley says that Emily was present,\nin 1717, when she saw this illusion, let us call it.\n(4) Every circumstance \"added\" in 1717, by Mrs. Wesley, except a\nreference to her nightgown and the examination of certain bottles, was\ntold in 1717 by Mr. Wesley, who was with her in an exploration of the\nhouse and shared her experiences. There was not, in 1717, \"one\nsound diversely interpreted,\" as Mr. Podmore declares : there were,\nMr. Wesley says, (1717) two distinct sounds, of breaking glass and\njingling money. The fright of the mastiff was recorded by Mr. Wesley,\nin 1717, as well as in 1726 by his wife.\nMr. Podmore has probably not observed this, nor noted that, in\n1717, Mrs. Wesley confessedly did not record a third of the experiences.\nThe two sounds and the mastiff are of contemporary record.\nAgain, in 1726, Keziah (a child in 1717), did not make mythopoeic\nadditions to, or even remember her own experiences, recorded by\nEmily in 1717 (as by Mr. Podmore's theory she ought to have done),\nbut could only recall a sound imitative of her father's knock.\nMr. Hoole's account, in 1726, is much less full and much less\ni The Letters are in Southey's Life ofJohn Wesley.\n\f318 Andrew Lang. [PABT\n\"sensational\" than Mr. Wesley's description, in 1717, of their\ncommon experiences. Mr. Hoole minimized.\nThus I conceive that Mrs. Wesley, Keziah, and Mr. Hoole, in 1726,\ndo not embroider upon the records of 1717.\nAs to the reports of the four sisters, in 1726, two had not written at\nall in 1717. The whole family, at that date, were heartily sick of the\nsubject and of Sam's inquiries. Susan, in 1726, omitted some of the\nstrangest experiences which, in 1717, she had recorded ; and mentioned\nothers which, in 1717, she did not chronicle. Mr. Podmore, naturally,\nnotes Susan's \"amplification\" in 1726. About the omissions of Susan\nin the same year, he, as naturally, says nothing. Emily, in 1726,\nmakes a considerable and, I suspect, mythic or misplaced addition to\nher record of 1717, but she also makes many and most important\nomissions. These are not remarked on by Mr. Podmore. Manifestly,\nif he is to argue that, in nine years, there were amplifications, he\nought to notice, also, that the omissions are more numerous and\nmore important. This is so obvious that, if he chose, he might say,\n\"by 1726 several narrators had become ashamed of, and therefore\nomitted, the absurd fables which excitement made them tell in 1717.\"\nThis sceptical argument is really stronger than that which Mr. Pod-\nmore advances. Perhaps his best plan would be to combine the two.\nWhere witnesses make additions, in 1726, they act under the influence\nof the magmfying power of the memory. Where the same witnesses\nmake omissions, they do so because they are now ashamed of their ex\naggerations of 1717, to which, however, they also add, by mythopoeic\nexaggeration. The double argument does not commend itself to me.\nBut Mr. Podmore must account for the late omissions, of which he says\nnot a word, as well as for the amplifications, on which he dwells with\nemphasis. At least this is how it strikes me.\nWe next come to Hetty's case. She is suspicious, as the fraudulent\nagent :\n(1) Because the agency, she thought, had \"had a particular spight\nat her,\" and was noisiest in her neigbourhood. But the agency had\nalso, we are told, \" a particular spight \" at Mr. Wesley, going the\nlength of three personal assaults. If Hetty saw \" something like a man\nin a loose trailing dressing gown \" (she is not said to have seen him),\nthree or four others in records of 1717 heard the sound like that of a\nsweeping dressing gown. Hetty's case is not peculiar in this respect.\n(2) Hetty had \"the singlar habit of trembling in a sound sleep when\nloud noises were going on all around her.\" So had the two other girls\nwho shared her bed. (Mr. Wesley, 1717 ; Mrs. Wesley, 1726.)\n\fXLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 319\n(3) Hetty did not write an account in 1717, or none survives,\nthough Emily says that Hetty is writing. Nor are Molly, and Nancy\nknown to have written in 1717. Hetty's silence is not peculiar to her.\n(4) Hetty gave no account to Jack, as the others did, at Epworth in\n1726. Where was Hetty in 1726, and on what terms with Jack ?\nAs a matter of fact, in 1726 Hetty was not at Epworth at all, but\nfar away, and could not, like the others, be examined by Jack. For\nreasons rather obscure, but connected with her recent marriage, Hetty\nwas in her father's disgrace ; he never forgave her, and, living with her\nhusband, a plumber of no culture, she was remote from the scene of\nJack's inquiries. The scientific sceptic ought to know the historical\nfacts of Hetty's case. So wretched and so repentant was this beautiful\nand charming girl, and so kind to her was Jack, that she would\nprobably have confessed to him her early practical joke, if she had\nbeen guilty.\nLet me add that, if we are to find a trickster, the new maid-servant\nattracts suspicion. The disturbances began with her ; she was\nfrightened by groans before any one of the family heard anything.\nShe is also the last recorded percipient of any phenomena (April, 1717).\nMrs. Wesley had a strict eye on her own girls and their lovers ; but\nwe scarcely ever hear where the new maid-servant was on any of the\nmany recorded occurrences of an unexplained kind. Mrs. Wesley\nacquitted the maid ; but if, as I shall try to show, persons can be\nfrightened into a hysterical condition, and into fraudulent production\nof odd occurrences, it would be easier to frighten a rustic servant girl\nthan a daughter of the rectory. i\nMr. Podmore himself, I daresay, will be pleased if I have dissipated\nhis suspicions of Hetty Wesley. I think I have shown, by the\nevidence, that her case presented no peculiarities : that she was not the\nonly sister who did not write to Sam in 1717 ; not the only sister who\ntrembled in her sleep; and that, in the Long Vacation of 1726, Jack\ncould not examine her on the spot, as he did the rest of the family,\nbecause she was far away. Then there is the servant maid to fall back\nupon as the impostor\u2014she and any waggish swains whom she may\nhave secreted in the long darkling and winding chamber in the\ni May I add that Mr. Podmore has said nothing about the hints that the noises\nwere hallucinatory ? Mr. Wesley, like Lord St. Vincent in the Hinton case,\nheard nothing at all till he was told about the noises. Later, he did not hear,\nand some of the others did not hear, a \" very loud \" knock on his own bed, heard\nby \" most of the family.\" The Maws, who lived opposite, listened, but heard\nnothing, when the noises were \" in their full majesty.\" (Recorded in 1726.)\n\f320 Andrew Lang. [PART\nroof of the house. At Epworth a simple boyish mechanism for\nproducing knocks on the outer walls of a house is even now familiar.\nYou need no more than a nail, a button, a piece of string, and the\ncover of a wall or bush. To be sure this trick does not explain a\ntenth of the phenomena described.\nIt ought to be observed that, according to Emily Wesley, in 1717,\nher father had preached against the local \" cunning men \" for several\nSundays before \" old Jeffrey,\" the bogle, began his pranks. That fact\nseems to me to be the key of the situation. At Cideville (1851) a\nrural warlock, and two small boys whom he frightened, were certainly\nthe \"agents\" in the disturbances. In a strange Red Indian case, of\nwhich I received reports (1899), the agent, a native girl of fourteen,\nhad received a severe nervous shock from natural causes before heavy\nweights began to \"tobogan about the floor\" of the wigwam, accom\npanied by the usual intelligent knocks and scratches. These, as I now\nlearn (1901), the Indians, at first sceptical, attributed to the agency of\na medicine man, lately deceased. In Miss Florence O'Neal's Devon\nshire Idylls, a good country girl is alarmed by a witch, and heavy\nfurniture then becomes volatile. No fraud, however, was detected.\nMiss O'Neal kindly informed me as to the circumstances. I give\nanother case, received from a Lincolnshire man, the Rev. Mr. Heanley.\nTHE RECTORY, WEYHILL, ANDOVER, HANTS,\nOctober 20\u00abA, 1901.\nDear Mr. Lang,\nYou aak me to furnish you with the particulars of a\n\" Wise woman \" \" sending noises,\" which came under my notice in the\nLincolnshire Marshland. I will do so to the best of my power, although it\nwill be a necessarily imperfect account, for I was then only just about to\nmatriculate at Oxford, aud I lost all interest in the case when it became\nclear that the immediate agent in producing the disturbances was the\nservant girl in the house affected. For it never occurred to me to look more\ndeeply into the matter, and ask the all important question as to what\nexternal influences might have been brought to bear upon her to make her\nact in the extraordinary fashion which she did. 1 simply thought it a case\nof hysteria.\nIt was in the summer of 1867, the year after the cattle plague had raged\nin the Marshes, when there was an extraordinary reversion amongst the\nnumerous small freeholders and little tenant farmers to the use of charms\nand spells to safeguard their cows ; and \" wise-men \" and \" wise-women \"\nreaped a harvest accordingly.\nIn my own parish of Croft Marsh there were two such reputed \" wise\nwomen,\" Mary X., the wife of a farm bailiff, and Mrs. K., wife of a small\ntenant farmer, who kept one servant, a nervous, delicate girl. Mary X. had\n\fXLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 321\nby far the greater reputation of the two, but Mrs. K. contrived to draw\naway some of Mary's wonted customers.\nOne afternoon the servant, who had been sent on an errand, returned in a\nterrible taking. Mary had met her upon the road, and after \" lookin' solid \"\nat her for some time without speaking, had fiiially said, \" Get thee whoam\nand tell that old b of a missus of thine that them as I knaws on, does\nmore than them as she knaws on, and them as can, 'ull larn her \\vp shakins\nand talkins, and remblins 1 to mell wi' jobs as belongs to me. Get thee\nwhoam, and moind thou saay I sent thee.\"\nThe girl was half dazed with fright, but faithfully delivered her message,\nand Mrs. K. flew into a tremendous rage, abusing the girl furiously for\nventuring to repeat such \"daffle,\" and daring old Mary to do her d dest.\nBut the girl repeatedly said she knew as sunnnat was comin' ; and sure\nenough within a week disturbances began in the house, strange whisperings,\nunexpected knocks, and finally moving of furniture. At first the manifesta\ntions only took place at night, but in a few days they began in the daytime ;\nand it was then that the servant was caught in the act, I think, of fixing\ntwo boards under her bed to form a sort of clapper, and was dismissed on\nthe spot, when the disturbances promptly ceased, and did not recur again.\nBut so far as I can recollect the girl stuck stoutly to her assertion that she\nhad no knowledge of what she was doing, and professed herself as much\nalarmed as any one else at the whole affair.\nHere as in the Grimsby case (Oct., Nov. 1901) we have malum\nminalum,\u2014the witch's threat,\u2014and damnum secutum, a set of Polter\ngeist phenomena. It looks almost like an affair of \" suggestion : \" how\nfar the trickster (in Mr. Heanley's case) was normally conscious of her\nacts, we do not know. In Mr. Podmore's second case, at Wem\n(Proceedings, Vol. xn. p. 67) the agent, Emma Davies, \"cried out\nthat an old woman was at her,\"\u2014the regular old witchcraft symptom,\n\u2014and she may have been frightened, as in Mr. Heanley's instance.\nWILLINGTON MILL.\nThe Willington case is closely analogous to that of Epworth, but is\nnearer our time by a hundred and twenty years. (1835-1847.) The\nbest part of the evidence is found in MS. statements, drawn up\nduring the disturbances, but not in the shape of a regular diary, by\nMr. Joseph Procter, the occupant of the house (Journal S. P.E.\nDecember, 1892, Vol. v., pp. 331-352). Mr. Procter was a Quaker,\nan Anti-Slavery man, an \"early tec-totaller \" and a good example of\nhis community. His first statement is of January 28, 1835.\nIn December 1834, Mrs. Procter first heard of the troubles from the\nnurse-maid. With her the experiences began, as at Epworth they\ni To \" remble \" is to move or shift a thing. Cf. French rembler.\n\f322 Andrew Lang. [PABT\nbegan, with the maid-servant. The nurse-maid used to sit by the\ncradle of one of the children in a room on the second floor. The\nchamber above was unoccupied. The earliest phenomena were sounds\nof some one walking heavily in the room above, so that the nursery\nwindow rattled, as the windows always do in these cases. Before\nmany days elapsed \" every member of the family \" had shared the\nexperience. In January 1835 the first percipient, the nurse, left; but\nthe phenomena remained. Some visitors (in January) heard nothing :\n\" all, with one exception, have been disappointed.\" (January 28, 1835.)\nThe \" haunted \" room, on the third floor, was examined carefully :\nnothing in the way of explanation was discovered. There were no\nrats : the sounds \" had no connection with the weather.\"\nOn February 18, 1835, Mr. Procter noted the disturbances since\nJanuary 28. On January 31, heavy \"deadened\" knocks sounded\nclose to his own bed. Omitting several stories, we find (Dec. 16, 1835)\nthe sound as of winding up a jack, at Epworth, here of a clock : heard\nby Mrs Procter's sister and a companion.\nThe bed lifting (as in Nancy Wesley's case, reported in 1726) was\npart of the experience of Mrs. Procter and nurse Pollard. Mrs. Procter\ndescribed it to her son, Edmund, \"as if a man were underneath pushing\nup the bed with his back\" (Dickens describes a slight earthquake\nshock in similar terms, substituting \" a large beast \" for a man, under\nthe bed.) Sounds of footsteps, knocks, and trailing garments were\n.common at Willington as at Epworth. One of the little boys \"was\nfound trembling and perspiring with fright,\" like three of the Epworth\ngirls. Mr. Procter does not recount many of his personal experiences,\nwhich were mainly of sounds, especially an odious kind of \" whistling\nor whizzing,\" heavy knockings, and peculiar moans. The visual\nhallucinations represented a monkey, \" a funny cat,\" and one or two\nhuman phantasms, not beheld by Mr. Procter. In 1847, after twelve\nyears of annoyance, the Procters left Willington : there was a tremen\ndous <harivari the night before they departed. As at Tedworth, a\nreport was circulated that Mr. Procter had discovered the cause of the\nphenomena to be a trick practised upon him. This, like Mr. Mompes-\nson, he denied. (Tynemouth, January 7, 1858.) The circulation of\nthis false explanation is, itself, one of the recurrent phenomena, in\nthese cases. No mortal has ever yet discovered, what Sir Walter\nScott could not find, \" Funny Joe's \" confession of having caused the\nWoodstock disturbances. But Funny Joe is always cited, as if he\nwere an authentic authority. His evidence is precisely on a par with\n.the girl who talked Greek and Hebrew, that old favourite of the\n\fXLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 323\n\u2022authors of scientific manuals of psychology. For science is easily\nsatisfied, when the evidence suits the theory in vogue.\nHere, speaking as an anthropological amateur, I would again remark\non the uniformity of the phenomena from the Eskimo (Rink) to my\nRed Indian case, in Hudson Bay Company Territory, to D. D. Home,\nor to the most ignorant little country girl, or to very early missionary\nreports from newly conquered Peru, or to Mr. Dennys's Chinese cases,\nor those of Catholic missionaries in Cochin China ; it is always the old\nstory of Epworth, Tedworth, Amherst, Rerrick, and so forth. The\nthing is \"Universally Human.\" Why? Is there a traditional trick; a\ncommon hallucination (as Coleridge thought) or are we still to seek for a\ntheory? Mr. Podmore (1896-97) has the Arundel case. \"A bewitched\"\ngirl was producing \" scratchings,\" which on a given occasion (Feb. 8,\n1884) were, beyond all doubt, fraudulent, as was proved by Mr.\nHubbert, F.R.C.S. (Proceedings, Vol. xn., p. 67.) Earlier in the\nevening, however, according to the girl's mother, a \" perfectly honest\nwitness,\" the sounds occurred while she held the child's hands. The\nmother tried another bed in another room. \" She states that the first\nbed heaved up (as at Epworth and Willington), and that, when\nthey went into the second room, the bed and everything in the\nroom shook.\" Had the girl \" crammed \" the Tedworth, Epworth,\nand Willington cases\/ with a crowd of others, British and foreign 1\nHad the child been studying historic records, or have they become\norally familiar? Once the thing began, the child could scratch her\nmattress when nobody was in the room, and she did. But about\nthe heaving up of the bed,\u2014that she could not do, while in the\nbed. Was the mother hallucinated in the traditional way, like\nRobert Chambers, when with D. D. Home ?\n\" The chamber floor would rise and fall,\nAnd never a board disjointed ! \"\nWhat we really desire is an answer to the question : How do\nthese stories come to be told 1 I am not too contented with the\nanswer, \" Because young people play a few foolish tricks : the rest\nis all exaggeration and hallucination.\" It is the extraordinary\nuniformity in the reports, from every age, country, and class of\nsociety, the uniformity in hallucination, that makes the mystery.\nI may be allowed to quote, not as \" evidential \" but as illustrative\nof this uniformity, a few cases from Monsieur de Mirville ; as his\nbook is not in the hands of everybody. I cite the second edition\n(1854). This is not the tract in which de Mirville published the\n\f324 Andrew Lang. [PART\ndepositions of witnesses in the Cideville case (1850-1851). In the\nwork of 1854, he argues from these depositions in the court of the Juge\nde Paix at Yerville. In 1854 he collects other examples.\nInto the case of Angelique Cottin, which began on January 15, 1846,\nI cannot go, for lack of a complete dossier, or collection of documents.\nOn January 15, 1854, objects flew about in the girl's neighbourhood.\nNext day, the neighbours had picked out some one as the witch\nor wizard who threw the spell on her. The disturbances went on,\nthe curt was called in, was sceptical, then verified the facts, and sent\nfor the doctors. They were puzzled. On February 2, the famous\nArago brought the affair before the Academy of Science. He him\nself, with M.M. Mathieu and Laugier, had observed the phenomena.\nA committee of the Academy of Science did not witness anything\nunusual, and Angelique was dismissed as non avenue. The Gazelle des\nHdpitanx (March 17) blamed the committee for satisfying neither\nbelievers nor sceptics. How were the experiences of Arago and the\nrest to be explained ? The Gazette Medicale declared that the Academy\n\" had exceeded its powers. . . . The non-appearance of the pheno\nmena, at a given moment, proves nothing.\"\nMr. Podmore (Journal S.P.R., June, 1899) refers briefly to the\nstone-throwing case at Paris, reported in the Gazette des Tribunaux\n(February 2, 1854). The aifair on February 2 had lasted for three\nweeks. There was a rain of missiles against an isolated house, which\nwas in a painfully battered condition. The police, aided by dogs,\ndid their best, but could track the missiles to no source. Planks had\nto be nailed on to the openings of the windows and the door place.\nMirville, not till the following winter, went to make inquiries at\nthe office of the Gazette. He learned that the owner of the house\nwas suspected of having destroyed his own property : others said\nthat a criminal had been caught. This rumour the police denied.\nAs for the sufferer, Lezible, the occupant of the house, he showed to\nMirville the debris of his properties, and a scar from one of the\nflying stones. \" What had I to get by smashing my furniture,\nmirrors, clock, crockery, to the value of \u00a360?\"' What indeed!\nAn odd point was that Lezible shut his outer shutters, which had a\nnarrow chink where the two flaps met. This didn't baffle the stone\nthrowers. Long thin pieces of tile now flew through the chink !\nThe secretaries of the Commissary of police assured Mirville that\nabsolutely no explanation had been discovered. Now it is easy to\ntry whether Mr. Podmore or I can bombard a house with stones\nfor weeks without being \"run in.\" If \"run in\" we could explain\n\fXLV.] Tlw Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 325\nto the worthy beak that we were engaged in scientific experiments.\nHowever, the case is not \" evidential,\" it merely donne & penser.\nAny member of the Society who can muster up energy enough to\ngo to the British Museum, may there find a serial styled Douglas\nJerrold, for March 26, 1847. Or perhaps he may not find it. Mirville\ncites this paper, at all events, for the unusual phenomena in the house\nof a Mr. Williams, Moscow Road, Bayswater. He had a family of\nfour, and nourished a Spanish boy of nine to ten years old. For days\nthe furniture flew up and down. The modus operandi of the child of\nten was never discovered, but, being a foreigner, he was suspected. A\nsimilar affair, on a larger scale, occurred in 1849 at Saint Quentin\n(Gazette des Tribunatm; December 20, 1849). No explanation was\ndiscovered ; the fracas lasted for three weeks. A case like that of\nAngelique Cottin was reported in the Conslilulionel, March 5, 1849.\nThe agent was a girl of fourteen. The trouble began as she was\nputting a child to bed ; a cupboard door burst open, and a quantity of\nlinen flew at the girl. After that \" all was gas and gaiters \" :\nthe furniture danced as usual. M. Larcher, the local physician at\nSaucheville, attested the facts. The girl had been instrumental in\neffecting the arrest of a rural malefactor ; after his release from prison\nthe phenomena began. A sack used to fly at the girl and envelop\nher ; heavy planks behaved as at Tedworth. The girl was carefully\nwatched, day and night, for a fortnight, by one of the ladies of her\nemployer's family. The girl was sent to her parents, and recovered,\nbut the phenomena attached themselves, at her former master's house,\nto a baby four months old. A newspaper, L'Abeille, of Chartres\n(March 11, 1849), published the letter of an eyewitness who had seen\nodd things in the child's cradle, arriving he knew not how, but he\ndoes not say that he saw them arrive. The editor sent two reporters,\nwho collected plenty of anecdotes. The curt exorcised the child, after\nconvincing himself of the reality of the facts : how he does not say.\nThe exorcism succeeded. Obviously the evidence is always given in\nthe very vaguest fashion : in each case it is worth a rush, but a fairly\nthick band of rushes is difficult to break, and we are still to seek\nfor an explanation of the uniformity of the descriptions.\nAs to the Cideville case (1851), Mr. Podmore does not seem to have\nfound the pamphlet of M. de Mirville, containing the depositions of\nwitnesses, and I am not aware that Mr. Wallace has supplied him with\na copy. I have, therefore, through the kindness of the Marquis\nd'Eguilles and of the Juge de Paix at Yerville, procured a transcript\nfrom the archives of the Court, of the proceedings in the trial of\nY\n\f326 Andrew Lung. [PART\nM. Tinel. I lay these documents at the feet of the Society, in the\ninterests of History. We cannot criticise the historical Poltergeist\nwithout going to historical sources.

LANG'S PAPER.\nBY FRANK PODMORE.\nMR. LANG'S historical researches into the evidence for the Tedworth\nPoltergeist incidentally afford strong support to my position. Briefly,\nthat position is that, when we succeed in getting the testimony of\neducated and intelligent witnesses at first-hand, and not too remote,\nwe find that the Poltergeist's performances were tolerably commonplace;\nand that the really marvellous incidents in every case rest either upon\nmere rumour, or upon the evidence of uneducated and incompetent\nwitnesses, or more rarely upon the testimony of educated witnesses\ngiven long after the events. Mr. Lang, it will be seen, has discovered\ntwo additional sources of evidence : the \" deplorable ballad,\" and\nMr. Mompesson's first-hand evidence, given in Court in April, 1663.\nThe ballad, as might be anticipated, repeats the same sort of\nstuff that Glanvil had given us at second-hand\u2014the throwing of\nthe bed-staff, the dancing of chairs and stools, the pulling the\nchildren out of bed, the attack upon the man-servant in his bed, and\nso on. But Mompesson, in his deposition, testifies only to the beating\nof the drum, knocking, \" several great noises, scratching, troubling the\nbeds. ' Even this evidence, since Mompesson gives no details, and does\nnot say whether he himself heard and saw these things, or whether\nhe is merely summarising the experience of his household, is of no\nparticular value except to show the utmost length to which a\nresponsible and intelligent witness could go. Practically, that is,\nMompesson's evidence adds nothing to the evidence of Glanvil,\nwhich I had already cited. Now, I by no means intended to reflect\non Glanvil as a witness. No doubt, as Mr. Lang says, he was \" far\nfrom being a stupid man,\"and probably he was about as good a witness\nas the times could have afforded. But I pointed out that his narrative\nwas scantily furnished with dates. Mr. Lang goes further, and shows\nthat the dates given are wrong. I further pointed out that his account\n\f328 Frank Podmore. [PART\nwas apparently not written down until some years later. Mr. Lang's\nreply to this is that the ballad, at any rate, confirms Glanvil's account\nof the disturbances in general. But that account is worthless anyway ;\nand is not rendered more or less worthless by the ballad. The only\nitem in Glanvil's report having any value as evidence is his account of\nwhat he himself saw and heard ; and the ballad has no bearing upon\nthat.\nBut Glanvil says that when he was present \"it shook the room and\nwindows very sensibly.\" Mompesson also describes \" the shaking of\nthe floor and strongest parts of the house in still and calm nights.\"\nMr. Lang doubts the ability of a little girl to perform this feat. Mr.\nLang's experience has obviously been more peaceful than my own.\nThis shaking of the room by continuous slight movements of one foot\nand leg, and doubtless by any other slight movement repeated at\nregular intervals, is the easiest of domestic arts to acquire, and also,\nKt-perto crede, the most difficult of all pernicious habits to eradicate ; for\nit can be done unconsciously, and is frequently so performed by a\ncertain acquaintance\u2014if indeed I may claim him as an acquaintance\u2014\nof my own.\nOn the whole, I take it that Mr. Lang and I are in substantial\nagreement about the Tedworth case : it is interesting, but evidential\nonly in so far as it shows that the ways of Poltergeists and children\nwere much the same in the seventeenth century as in the twentieth.\nIncidentally, I note that the parallel case which Mr. Lang cites, on\nthe authority of a gentleman \" distinguished in law and known\nin politics,\" is in a fair way to become itself interesting from the\nantiquarian standpoint. When Mr. Lang first heard the account he\ndoes not say ; but at any rate the father's story is corroborated by the\nson, now a grown man, but then a child in the nursery.\nBut Mr. Lang's views diverge much more widely from mine, I regret\nto say, on the Wesley case. I will take the points in order, referring\nto the numbered paragraphs in Mr. Lang's article.\n(1) My argument is based upon a comparison of the earlier and\nlater accounts by the same witness. It had therefore only an indirect\nreference to Mr. Wesley's testimony, in which no such comparison is\npossible. But, since Mr. Lang challenges me, I will admit that Mr.\nWesley seems to have been able, without the help of the nine years'\ninterval, to present us with a narrative which is not tame or\nuninteresting.\n(2) and (3) Mr. Lang writes: \"In 1717 Mr. Wesley and Emily\ntold Sam, about Mrs. Wesley, things which she did not tell Sam\n\fXLV.] Remarks on Mr. Lang's Paper. 329\nin 1717 herself, but did tell Jack in 1726. However, in the letters\nof Mrs. Wesley, Mr. Wesley, and Sam, in 1717, it is thrice averred\nthat in 1717 she 'forbore many particulars,' or did not tell 'one\nthird ' of the circumstances. Mr. Podmore omits this fact.'\nThis statement of the case hardly, I submit, brings out the facts.\nAt the risk of being tedious, I will quote the passages referred to in Mr.\nLang's \"thrice averred.\" Firstly, Mrs. Wesley writes (25th-27th January,\n1717): \"It commonly was nearer her (Hetty) than the rest, which she\ntook notice of, and was much frightened, because she thought it had a\nparticular spite at her. \/ could multiply particular instances, but I\nforbear.\" The passage, as printed, seems to refer to the connection of\nthe disturbances with Hetty. Sam Wesley, it is true, interprets the pas\nsage somewhat differently. He writes, secondly, in reply to his mother's\nletter : \" You say you could multiply particular instances of the\nspirit's noises, but I want to know whether nothing was ever seen by\nany\" (letter of February 12th, 1717). In any case, I submit, the\npassage will not bear Mr. Lang's interpretation. The refusal to multiply\nparticular instances is hardly equivalent to the suppression of incidents\nof a different and more marvellous nature. There remains, thirdly,\nMr. Wesley's testimony. He writes : \" Your mother has not written\nyou a third part of it\" (letter of llth February). On this the only\ncomment which seems to be required is that Mr. Wesley neither says\nnor implies that Mrs. Wesley had withheld any of her own experiences.\nMr. Lang's statement, therefore, that \"in 1717 Mrs. Wesley con\nfessedly did not record a third of the experiences \" seems to me to go\nbeyond the warrant of the record. The only person who confesses so\nmuch is Mr. Wesley ; but he did his best, in his own diary, to com\npensate for the alleged deficiency. And Mr. Lang's inference that\namongst the omitted experiences were some of Mrs. Wesley's own,\ndifferent in kind to those which she did describe, appears to me not to\nbe justified either by the written record or by common-sense.\nMr. Lang adds that Emily, as well as her father, mentioned in 1717\nthat Mrs. Wesley had seen a badger. Precisely; but Mrs. Wesley was\nnot, as would appear from her silence despite Sam's appeal to her,\nsufficiently sure of having seen it to mention it in 1717. The conviction\nonly grew with years. Surely the vision of a spectral badger could\nhardly come under the heading : \" Multiplication of particular\ninstances \" !\n(4) \" Every circumstance added in 1726 by Mrs. Wesley was told\nin 1717 by Mr. Wesley.\" That is part of my argument. In 1717,\nwith the incidents fresh in her memory, Mrs. Wesley refused to \" let\n\f330 Frank Podmore. [PART\nherself go\": in 1726 she incorporated with her own memory of the\nincidents the memories and imaginations of other people.\nMr. Hoole's account in 1726 is less sensational than Mr. Wesley's\naccount of the same incident in 1717. Mr. Lang infers that Mr.\nHoole minimised. I claim equal license to infer that Mr. Wesley\nmagnified. Securus judicet orbis.\nIn their later narratives Emily and Susannah omit several incidents\nwhich they had recorded in their earlier accounts, and insert others\nwhich found no place in their original statements. Mr. Lang contends\nthat my argument, being founded on the alleged exaggerations con\ntained in the later reports, is vitiated, because \" the omissions arc\nmore numerous and important.\" More numerous they no doubt are :\ntheir relative importance, of course, depends upon the standard which\nwe adopt. I notice that the incidents omitted from the later accounts\nare merely additional descriptions of various kinds of noises ; but the\nincidents inserted are of a wholly different kind\u2014to wit, physical\nmovements, in Emily's case movements of a very striking character,\nand I claim that these additions, from the evidential standpoint at any\nrate, are much more important than the omissions.\nNow as to Hetty's part in the business. My demonstration\u2014or\nattempted demonstration\u2014of the untrustworthincss of the testimony\nis of course in no way affected by the question of Hetty's agency in the\nmatter. I fear, indeed, that I may seem wanting in chivalry in\nreturning to the charge. But the indications are so much stronger\nthan would appear from Mr. Lang's account of the matter that it seems\nnecessary to do so. My suspicions of Hetty are founded on the\nfollowing passages, which I quote afresh :\nMrs. Wesley writes, January 25th and 27th, 1717: \"All the\nfamily, as well as Robin, were asleep when your father and I went\ndownstairs (on the nocturnal exploration referred to by Mr. Lang), nor\ndid they wake in the nursery when we held the caudle close by them,\nonly we observed that Hetty trembled exceedingly in her sleep, as she\nalways did before the noise awaked her. It commonly was nearer her\nthan the rest.\" Emily writes (1717): \"No sooner was I got upstairs,\nand undressing for bed, but I heard a noise among many bottles that\nstand under the best stairs, just like the throwing of a great stone\namong them, which had broken them all to pieces. This made me\nhasten to bed ; but my sister Hetty, who sits always to wait on my\nfather going to bed, was still sitting on the lowest step of the garret\nstairs.\"\nAnd again : \" It never followed me as it did my sister Hetty. I\n\fXLV.] Remarks on Mr. Lang's Paper. 331\nhave been with her when it has knocked under her, and when she has\nremoved has followed, and still kept just under her feet.\"\nMrs. Wesley, in her later account, after describing loud noises\nwhich they heard in their bedroom, writes : \" Mr. Wesley leapt up,\ncalled Hetty, who alone was up, and searched every room in the\nhouse.\"\nSusannah, in her later account, writes : \" Presently began knocking\nabout a yard within the room on the floor. It then came gradually to\nsister Hetty's bed, who trembled strongly in her sleep. It beat very\nloud, three strokes at a time, on the bed's head.\"\nFinally, in John Wesley's version of Mr. Hoole's experience, we\nread : \" When we \" (i.e. Mr. Wesley and Mr. Hoole) \" came into the\nnursery it was knocking in the next room ; when we were there it was\nknocking in the nursery, and there it continued to knock, though we\ncame in, particularly at the head of the bed (which was of wood), in\nwhich Miss Hetty and two of her younger sisters lay.\"\nMr. Lang's reply to this is: \" It was said (by Emily Wesley in 1717)\nto have a particular spite against Mr. Wesley, and Mr. Wesley tells us\nthat it thrice pushed him about.\" Moreover, Hetty's habit of trembling\nin her sleep was not \"singular,\" because Mr. Wesley tells us in 1717\nand Mrs. Wesley in 1726 that the two children who shared Hetty's\nbed did the same. I am indebted to Mr. Lang for a further illustra\ntion, which had escaped my notice, of embellishment in Mrs. Wesley's\nlater account. In describing in 1717 the visit to the nursery, Mrs.\nWesley says, in the passage already quoted, that \"Hetty trembled\nexceedingly in her sleep.\" In 1726, referring to the same occasion,\nshe writes : \" The children were all asleep, but panting, trembling, and\nsweating exceedingly.\" The reader can judge which version is likely\nto be the more accurate.\nMr. Lang has done nothing to explain why Hetty did not write to\nher brother Samuel in 1717, though she had apparently allowed her\nsister Susannah to suppose that she had done so (letter of March 27th,\n1717) : nor is it clear to me why Jack did not obtain her testimony\nin 1726, if\u2014as -was no doubt the case\u2014he realized its importance.\nThere were posts in those days ; and Mr. Lang tells us that Hetty\nwas on good terms, at any rate with Jack.\nTo reply to Mr. Lang's summary : Mrs. Wesley and Emily both\nassert that the noises were most frequent in Hetty's neighbourhood\nMrs. Wesley and Susannah both mention that Hetty trembled strongly\nin her sleep. By the testimony of Mrs. Wesley and Emily, Hetty, on\nat least two occasions, was up and about the house alone when the\n\f332 Frank Podmore. [PART\ndisturbances were in progress. Susannah states that Hetty had\nwritten a full account to Sam Wesley in 1717 ; but Hetty either did\nnot write or her letter has not been preserved. Nor did she write to\nJohn Wesley in 1726. The presumption of Hetty's guilty agency\nafforded by these considerations is not perhaps very strong ; but Mr.\nLang's arguments seem to me to detract but little from such strength\nas it possesses.\nBut, once more, the point is of little importance. Hetty may have\nbeen entirely innocent of any share, conscious or unconscious, in the\nperformance. The question in any case has little bearing upon the\nevidence. I cannot find that Mr. Lang has done anything to impair\nmy demonstration of the untrustworthiness of the evidence upon which\nthe case rests : he has in fact unwittingly supplied me with a further\nillustration of my argument. My omission to discover this particular\ninstance for myself is the only omission of all those with which he\ncharges me to which I am prepared to plead guilty.\n\fXLV.] Further Remarks. 333\nFURTHER REMARKS.\nBY ANDREW LANG.\nIT is hard to make my reply to Mr. Podmore short. I may say that\nI did not quote the Tedworth ballad as proof of the facts, but to\nshow that Glanvil's mythopoeic memory did not invent them between\n1662-1666. Mr. Mompesson's deposition is not in detail: I have\nvainly tried to recover, at Salisbury, the evidence of his witnesses\nand himself under examination. I do not believe that a child of ten,\nin bed, could shake a room in a squire's house of 1662. What a\nchild, in bed, can do in a modern London house, I leave to the larger\nexperience of Mr. Podmore. My \"antiquarian\" story, of are. 1875,\nis not more \"antiquarian\" than many in the Society's Census of\nHallucinations, is much less \"remote\" than several of these. As to\nEpworth, we have in Mr. Wesley's notes, the evidence, desiderated\nby Mr. Podmore, of \"an educated and intelligent witness at first\nhand,\" to Poltergeist performances not \"tolerably commonplace,\"\nnot \"comparatively tame and uninteresting.\" We have more in Lord\nSt. Vincent's account of the disturbances at Mrs. Rickett's house,\nHinton, and in Mr. Procter's notes at Willington Mill. Mr. Pod-\nmore admits this for Mr. Wesley, and I regard Lord St. Vincent\nas a witness quite as trustworthy.\nI still do not find that Mr. Podmore, in March, 1899, mentioned\nthat Mrs. Wesley (Jan. 25-27, 1717), forbore to \"multiply particular\ninstances,''\u2014as she says she could do,\u2014and did not tell \" one-third of\nit.\" On this head I shall not follow Mr. Podmore's attempts to put a\nspecial sense on \"particular.\" The reason why Mrs. Wesley gave a\nfuller account (which I take to have been oral) to Jack in 1726, than\nin her letter to Sam in 1717 is obvious to any unprejudiced reader.\nA sensible woman, now free from anxiety as to Sam's and his brothers'\nhealth, with a hundred household and parochial cares, she did not\nwrite \"a third of it.\" On March 27, 1717, she writes: \"I am quite\n\f334 Andrew Lang. [PART\ntired of hearing or speaking of it.\" That is the simple explanation of\nher brevity when writing in 1717, and of her relative copiousness in\ntelling in 1726. Emily also, in 1717, writes: \"I could tell you abun\ndance more of it,\" but she is lazy about writing. Is not this the\nalmost universal experience of psychical researchers, when they ask\nfor information by letter? Mr. Hoole, in 1717, did not write at all, as\nSam desired, or no letter exists, and I conceive that there was pro\nbably another letter by Emily, and perhaps one by Hetty, of March\n27, which we do not possess. Mrs. Wesley and Emily, in 1717, had\n\" abundance more to tell \" which they did not then write ; if they\nwere more copious by word of mouth, in 1726, it does not follow\nthat they were myth making. I exhibit specimens of Mr. Pod-\nmore's reasoning.\nIn 1717 Mr. Wesley and Emily say that Mrs. Wesley saw (\"thought\nshe saw,\" writes Mr. Wesley), a badger (hallucination, no doubt).\nMrs. Wesley corroborated this in 1726, but did not write to Sam about\nit in 1717. 1 take it to be one of the \"particular instances\" which\nshe then omitted ; but that is only my opinion. Mr. Podmore writes :\n\" Mrs. Wesley was not, as appears from her silence despite Sam's\nappeal to her, sufficiently sure of having seen it to mention it in\n1717.\" But she did, in her family circle, mention it, unless Mr.\nWesley and Emily invented her vision at the time.\nAgain \"every circumstance added in 1726 by Mrs. Wesley was told\nin 1717 by Mr. Wesley,\" I remarked. Mr. Podmore replies : \"That is\npart of my argument. In 1717, with the incidents fresh in her\nmemory, Mrs. Wesley refused to 'let herself go': in 1726 she incor\nporated with her own memory of the incidents the memories and\nimaginations of other people,\" for example, the evidence of her\nhusband (his evidence of his own experiences), which fact Mr. Podmore\nleft out.\nIt is part of everybody's \"argument\" that the testimony of\neducated and intelligent witnesses at first hand\" is the best. Mr.\nPodmore gets it from Mr. Wesley, as to the mastiff, for example.\nBut he omits it, till Mrs. Wesley corroborates in 1726, and then\nhe dismisses her evidence, as an \"imagination of other people,\"\n\" incorporated in her memory,\" with the same logic as he devotes to\nMr. Wesley's statement, in 1717, that the other children, as well as\nHetty, trembled (Mrs. Wesley adds\u2014 1726\u2014panted and sweated)in their\nsleep. Mrs. Wesley, in 1717, only mentioned the trembling of Hetty,\nand this peculiarity was made part of the case against Hetty (Journal,\nMarch, 1899, p. 44). Mr. Podmore omitted to mention Mr. Wesley's\n\fXLV.] Further Remarks. 335\nequally contemporary statement that the other children also trembled :\nMr. Wesley sat by them alone. As Mrs. Wesley, in 1726, tells us what\nMr. Wesley told in 1717, Mr. Podmore, who had omitted Mr. Wesley's\nevidence to the point, thanks me for \" a further illustration of\nembellishment in Mrs. Wesley's later account.\" But why did he not\ngive Mr. Wesley's evidence, and why should it be discredited ? The\nlogic baffles me. Is it, then, part of Mr. Podmore's argument to omit\nportions of the evidence of a first-hand, contemporary, educated, and\nintelligent witness ? He calls Mrs. Wesley's mention of the terror of\nthe mastiff, given in 1726, an addition by Mrs. Wesley, \"a decorative\ndetail.\" But he did not tell us that Mr. Wesley gave the detail in\n1717. This evidence of the kind of witness chosen by himself,\neducated, intelligent, contemporary, at first hand, he omitted in the\nJournal, March, 1899.\nHe also, I repeat, omitted to mention that witnesses, in 1726,\nomitted parts of what they wrote in 1717. He may reckon the things\nomitted less important than the things added. The witnesses, how\never, had their own standard, and, in Emily's \"abundance of more\nthings to tell,\"\u2014but not told,\u2014in 1717, and not alluded to by Mr.\nPodmore, may very well be the things told by her in 1726. In 1726\nSukey omitted what she told in 1717 concerning the sound as of a\nman walking in her room, in a trailing garment. Mr. Hoole, in 1726,\nspoke to the same experience. In any case, when a critic is dwelling\non late additions, he should, I think, also record late omissions, and\nthe fact that two witnesses certainly and confessedly did make\nomissions in 1726, whatever these omissions may have been.\nAs to Mr. Hoole, I think that I may have misled Mr. Podmore by\nmy own inaccuracy. I said that \"Mr. Hoole,\" in 1726, \"minimised.\"\nThe fact is, first, that he does not seem to have been always with\nMr. Wesley, who was alone when some odd things occurred, Mr.\nHoole being upstairs. Secondly, in 1726, Mrs. Wesley says that, in\nMr. Hoole's presence, the noises were \" lower than usual,\" but Mr.\nPodmore may discard her statement. But, when I erroneously said\nthat \" Mr. Hoole minimised,\" Mr. Podmore replies, \" I claim equal\nlicense to infer that Mr. Wesley magnified.\" Memory, I have insisted,\nmay magnify, or may minimise. But it magnifies in Mr. Wesley's\ncase ; minimises in Mr. Hoole's, just as may happen to suit Mr. Pod\nmore's contention. Meanwhile, as before, the contemporary, first\nhand, educated, intelligent witness goes to the wall in the person of\nMr. Wesley.\nAs to Hetty, I merely repeat that there was nothing singular in her\n\f336 Andrew Lang. [PART\ncase. There are circumstances, and such were Hetty's, in and after\n1726, when only a very resolute researcher will vex a woman with\nletters about an old ghost story.\nMay I suggest that as the Wesley papers are very easily accessible\nin Southey's Life of John Wesley, the curious had better read them\nfor themselves? I quite think that Emily, in 1726, did add a myth\nor two, as I think I hinted already.\nNOTE.\n[Two points in the above argument may be briefly referred to :\n(1) The evidence of Mr. Wesley. Mr. Lang calls this first-hand.\nMr. Podmore draws a distinction between the first-hand part of it,\u2014\nthat relating to Mr. Wesley's own experiences,\u2014and the second-hand\npart,\u2014that relating to the experiences of others. A summary of Mr.\nWesley's account of his own experiences, including details of what Mr.\nLang calls \"the oddest of all the phenomena,\" viz., his being \"thrice\npushed by an invisible power,\" was given by Mr. Podmore in the\nJournal, March, 1899, with instances in which Mr. Wesley's second\nhand testimony as to the experiences of others represented their experi\nences as more remarkable than would appear from their own contem\nporary accounts.\n(2) The later evidence contains, says Mr. Lang, omissions as well as\nadditions ; thus it does not in all respects exaggerate, but in some cases\nprobably minimises ; and this tends to show that the additions new!\nnot be exaggerations. Mr. Podmore, in his remarks above, contends\nthat the omissions relate chiefly to the less marvellous kinds of incidents,\nviz., noises ; whereas the additions introduce various instances of the\nmore marvellous kinds, such as \" physical phenomena.\" (It has often\nbeen observed that \" physical phenomena \" tend to be introduced into\nlate or second-hand accounts.) Xow it is inevitable that many details\nshould be forgotten after a time by witnesses, and it might have been\nexpected a priori that for this reason later narratives would generally\nbe less striking and detailed than contemporary ones. As a matter of\nfact, the opposite is generally the case, which shows, as we all know,\nthat there is a tendency to exaggerate unusual events in retrospect.\nIn this case the arguments brought forward on both sides, together\nwith the original records, will give the reader full material for estim\nating the value of first-hand as compared with second-hand, and\ncontemporary as compared with later testimony, and we do not propose\nto continue the discussion.\u2014EDITOR.]\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 337\nIV.\nDISCUSSION OF THE TRANCE PHENOMENA\nOF MRS. PIPER.\nBY HEREWARD CARRINGTON.\n\u00a7 1. Introductory.\nTHK importance of the problems arising from a study of Mrs. Piper,\u2014\nher trance-utterances and automatic script,\u2014cannot well be over\nestimated. It would almost seem that the S.P.R. had at length reached\nthe crux in its history ; that turning point which it is impossible to\nignore. And, apart from absolute suspension of judgment and\nneutrality of mind, which few of us possess, there seem to be two, and\nonly two, roads open to the impartial investigator : one leading direct\nto Spiritism ; the other diverging off, and leading us into a maze of\n\" unknowns \" and speculative hypotheses, which, though ingenious, are\nnevertheless somewhat unwarrantable, and do not afford us much\nmental satisfaction. The whole case is one continuous series of\nglorious uncertainties; of doubts, suspicions, semi-convictions, more\ndoubts and again uncertainties, leaving us dissatisfied with ourselves\nand wondering whether, after all, there is such a truth as Spiritism or\nno ! But the problem must be faced ; the last report on the Piper\nphenomena has brought this question to a head, and we must decide in\nour own minds at any rate as to the source of the knowledge displayed.\nThere really seem to be but two hypotheses which we need consider in\nthis case : one, the Spiritistic ; this we accept only after failing in\nevery other conceivable direction ; the other, any hypothesis or com\nbination of hypotheses which affords a reasonable explanation of the\nphenomena in question. Of the two, it is hardly necessary to say\nwhich one is likely to be more widely accepted, if only a loophole is left\nopen by which the other is evaded. There are, in the first place, many\nweighty a priori assumptions against the probability of the Spiritistic\nhypothesis .in the Piper case. That only one medium should have\n\f338 Hereward Carrington. [PART\nsupplied us with sufficiently strong evidence of \" spirit return \" to make\nthat hypothesis even the most probable one is in itself a most extra\nordinary and suspicious circumstance ; and that we should base our\nbelief in the survival of the soul, nay, in the very existence of a soul at\nall, upon the automatic scrawl of one entranced woman is to some of us\na most stupendous assumption. But a priori objections must here be\nset on one side, and the facts of the case met with a counter-argument\nsufficiently strong to render this alternative hypothesis at least a\nreasonable one. Now it must be admitted that the arguments brought\nforward by Professor Hyslop in his Report make the Spiritistic hypo\nthesis at least thinkable, and, instead of struggling and straining our\nfacts to make them appear supernormal and spiritistic in character, the\nfacts themselves are of such a nature that they force one to seek for\nhypotheses that will account for the knowledge shown without reverting\nto the supposition that the communicators are \" veritably the person\nalities that they claim to be,\" i i.e. that they are spirits. The necessity\nof such a hypothesis is obvious if we are to discard that one with which\nDr. Hodgson and Professor Hyslop have supplied us, and it is the\nobject of this paper to suggest an explanation, which, while leaving\nmany points undecided and unexplained, yet seems to me to fulfil most\nof the requirements of the case ; and, indeed, this is all that can be said\nof the Spiritistic hypothesis, which, while it has many good points and\nstrong evidence in its favour, yet has also many contradictory state\nments to account for, and many extraordinary difficulties to contend\nwith before it clears itself from all suspicion.\nTo turn, then, to the Piper phenomena.\n\u00a7 2. The hypotheses already advanced to account for the phenomena.\nOf the various hypotheses that have been brought forward to\n\"explain\" this remarkable case, fraud is very naturally the first one\nwhich will have to be met and refuted. Until this factor is\neliminated the entire evidence is, of course, evidentially worthless.\nBut I shall not dwell upon the question here. Every one who has\nbeen associated with Mrs. Piper for any length of time, or studied\nher trances, or even the written reports, has, I believe, become\nfirmly convinced that she is not a conscious impostor. Of course\nit is next to impossible to prove this on paper. I am aware that\nmany persons still continue to believe that Mrs. Piper obtains her\ninformation in a perfectly normal manner ; by inquiries of paid\ni Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. xm. p. 406.\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 339\nagents, and by the \" information bureau \" system, if I may so call\nit, exposed in the Revelations of a Spirit Medium. No doubt this\nis very extensively employed by mediums in this country (U.S.A.),\nbut I do not believe that Mrs. Piper obtains her information in this\nway. However, it is unnecessary to dwell on this point, and I shall\nnot discuss it further.\nThe remark is sometimes made that Mrs. Piper's trance utterances\nrepresent nothing more than \" the wanderings of a hysterical woman.\"\nIt is, of course, chiefly made by persons who have never studied or\neven seen the Piper reports published in the Proceedings ; but I\ndiscovered not long ago a very similar statement from the pen of\none of our most valued critics and contributors to the work of the\nSociety. In Cock Lane and Common Sense (p. 327), Mr. Andrew Lang\naccuses Dr. Carpenter of an \"almost incredible ignorance of what\nevidence is.\" Now, without impertinence, it seems to me that\nMr. Lang exposes himself to very much the same charge when he\ndescribes Mrs. Piper's automatic script as \" very mournful and\nincoherent utterances\" (Independent, Dec. 1901, p. 2869). Mr. Lang\nhas openly expressed his dislike for the Piper phenomena before now,\nbut that is no excuse for his wilful disregard of the specific facts\nindicated in this series of trance sittings.\nRegarding the theories of fraud and hysteria as removed from the\nfield, therefore, wo now come to the various hypotheses that may be\nsuggested as counter-arguments to Spiritism. In the first place it must\nbe conceded that both muscle-reading and suggestion (conscious and\nunconscious), are generally out of the question ; the former, as there is\nno contact between medium and sitter ; the latter we may disregard, as\na study of the stenographic reports fails to indicate more than the\nfaintest suggestions, and these on very rare occasions. As the reports\nare verbatim, I suppose they are to be relied upon.\nThe same objections hold good with regard to hypercesthesia on the\nmedium's part. Indeed, it is hard to see where this could possibly\ncome in, generally speaking.\nThe question of chance, pure and simple, is absurd ; especially in the\ncase of G.P., and in Professor Hyslop's sittings, as his statistical table\nabundantly shows (Vol. XVI. p. 121).\nAs to knowledge gained unconsciously by the medium : that may perhaps\nexplain some few incidents, but very few, and is not worth considering\nseriously.\nNor will secondary or multiplex personality alone account for the\nphenomena; for, though the necessary dramatic play may here be\n\f340 Hereward Carrirtgton. [PART\nexhibited, this personality would lack the requisite knowledge which\ngives the force to the Spiritistic hypothesis.\nAs for telepathy and clairvoyance, we must suppose that these supply\nthe necessary data ; the knowledge gained by some supernormal means,\nwhich supply the personality with the requisite personal memories and\nrecollections, and give to the sitter the general impression that he is in\nvery truth in communication with his deceased friend or relative. Of\nthese two, clairvoyance\u2014as we understand it\u2014has operated on but rare\noccasions. There were some traces of it in the old Phinuit regime, but\nmost of these were in the form of experiments, and there are but very\nfaint traces of this faculty operating in recent sittings. We are forced,\ntherefore, to accept telepathy as our explanation until we succeed in\nobtaining a better one. But the theory of telepathy has been answered\nby both Dr. Hodgson and Professor Hyslop with \" arguments of con\nsiderable force,\" and personally, I do not consider it sufficient to account\nfor the facts recorded, if taken alone. Professor Hyslop's arguments appear\nto me to be almost convincing on this point. We are left, therefore, to\naccount for the facts as best we may, or to fall back upon the old and\nmuch despised theory of Spiritism. Most assuredly this covers all the\nfacts in the case, and it is a hypothesis which we may be forced to accept\nsome day ; but for the present let us stand it to one side, to be\nregistered by the world at large as \"not proven.\" (Proof, by the way,\nin this case, must rest entirely on comparative probabilities, and so will be\njudged differently by various persons, according to their subjective\nmental attitude in these questions.)\n\u00a7 3. The possibility of combining these hypotheses.\nTo revert now to the hypotheses, I contend that no one hypothesis will\nexplain all the facts in the Piper records, and on this point I believe\nthat the majority of those who read the Proceedings will agree with me.\nBut will a combination of these hypotheses suffice? I certainly believe\nthat, with more or less straining, it will. This very point is, it appears\nto me, deliberately skipped by Professor Hyslop in his carefully drawn\nup Eeport. We find (Vol. xvi. p. 1 24), the following sentence\u2014\n\" I leave to the ingenuity of a priori speculation the combination of\nassumptions necessary to meet the simple hypothesis which I have\npreferred to defend as satisfactory for the present. Hence, with the\nrefusal to consider these, telepathy is the only real or apparent difficulty\nin its connection with secondary personality that I shall consider.\"\nWhy should Professor Hyslop refuse to consider these ? I venture to\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 341\nthink that it is precisely this combination of objections which is likely\nto occur to the average person who believes fraud to be eliminated in\nthis case. That, to me, seems a very weak point.\n\u00a7 4. The value of the previous evidence estimated.\nNow if we go back in our review of the Piper phenomena, I believe\nthat few persons would care to stake their belief in a future life on any\nevidence published prior to Dr. Hodgson's Eeport in Proceedings, Vol.\nXIII. Sir Oliver Lodge (Vol. vi., p. 647), classified some 41 instances\nwhich he considered as \"especially difficult to explain by direct\nthought-transference,\" but Mr. Lang claims to have \" explained \" all\nthese more or less satisfactorily, except the \" snake skin incident.\" i\nVol. VIII. (Proceedings) certainly contains no evidence sufficiently strong\nfor us to found such a belief upon ; and indeed such was the conclusion\nof Dr. Hodgson himself (p. 57). In Proceedings, Vol. XIII., outside of\nthe G.P. notes, there seems to be\u2014indeed stronger evidence than\npreviously, but hardly enough upon which to base the belief in a future\nlife. The Reports in Vol. xiv. are exceedingly dubious, owing largely\nto the extraordinary confusion prevailing throughout. If, therefore,\nsome person, candid, open-minded, but ignorant of this Society's work,\nwere to ask what scientific evidence there was for a belief in the\nimmortality, or at least the survival of the soul, and we should refer\nhim to the G.P. notes and to Professor Hyslop's Report, the question\nis\u2014would that be sufficient1 I venture to think that it would not. Of\ncourse the case is different with Dr. Hodgson. He has seen, he tells us,\nmany private and personal passages written out by the entranced Mrs.\nPiper which we have not seen ; they, unfortunately, being loo personal\nand too private to be published ! Also Dr. Hodgson has had the\nadvantage of personal observation ; of watching the symptoms of the\ntrance, the dramatic play of personality and many other of these\ninteresting manifestations which we can not witness. Naturally this\npersonal scrutiny carries far more weight to the mind of an observer\nthan would hundreds of printed pages to the same individual j and that\nthis personal and prolonged investigation does tend to convince is\nobvious from the position taken by both Dr. Hodgson and Professor\nHyslop. However, the majority of the human race cannot enjoy these\nprivileges, and, while they should be allowed for, no one can convince\nothers except on the actual testimony itself; and it is consequently from\nthe printed pages that we must argue the point.\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. xv., p. 41.\nZ\n\f342 Hereward Carrington. [PART\n\u00a7 5. The Piper phenomena are mare spontaneous than experimental in\ntheir character,\nNow, in attacking the position taken by Professor Hyslop, I must\ndiffer from him in one of the first and most crucial points in the whole\ncase. On p. 142 (Proceedings, Vol. XVI.), we find the following\nsentence :\n\"The Piper phenomena are experiments, complete in themselves, and\nare not spontaneous occurrences.\"\nHere is where I entirely differ from Professor Hyslop, or I have\nmistaken the meaning of the word \" experiment.\" Spontaneous\nphenomena are exactly what they are, it appears to me. An investi\ngator \"sits\" with Mrs. Piper and calmly waits for whatever messages\nmay come through her hand. The conversation is invariably opened\nby some \" control \" ; each new subject is broached by him ; (if by the\nsitter as a \" test,\" it very seldom succeeds) ; and the knowledge is offered\nor written out quite spontaneously, to be either recognized or disclaimed\nby the sitter. In experimental thought-transference, on the other\nhand, the agent (presumably the sitter) has some definite idea in his\nmind which he endeavours to impress upon that of the percipient (here,\n\u2014-medium). It is in his supraliminal consciousness, and no account is\ntaken of anything which may happen to be passing through his\nsubliminal consciousness. Thus : the figure 64 may be in the agent's\n(supraliminal) mind.\u2014The percipient says 37.\u2014\" Wrong ! \"\u2014How do\nwe know that 37 was not in the subliminal consciousness of the agent I\nWe cannot. Obviously experimental thought-transference must take\nplace between the supraliminal consciousness of one person and the same\nstratum of consciousness in the mind of the other. Were this not so,\nthere would be no experiment about it. Sir Oliver Lodge's argument as\nto distant telepathy, that \" it ought to be constantly borne in mind that\nthis kind of thought-transference, without consciously active agency,\nhas never been experimentally proved,\" (Vol. VI., p. 453), is answered\nby Mr. Lang in a somewhat telling question\u2014\" How can you experi\nment consciously on the unconscious 1 \" (Vol. xv., p. 48). Hence it is\nno argument against telepathy to say that such and such a fact was not\nin my mind (supraliminal consciousness) at the time,\u2014rather the\nreverse. Consequently, in the Piper case, I must profess to differ\nabsolutely from Professor Hyslop in his statement that these are\nexperiments ; it seems to me that that is precisely what they are not.\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 343\n\u00a7 6. The possibility of unconscious telepathy.\nGranting then that the knowledge gained by Mrs. Piper is abstracted\nfrom our subliminal consciousness, we have no direct proof that this\nlatter may not be thinking of anything,\u2014some incident entirely distinct\nfrom that upon which our supraliminal is engrossed. On the other\nhand, we have very good evidence to show that such is frequently the\ncase. \" Miss X \" remarked that\u2014\" it ought by this time to have passed\ninto an axiom that it by no means follows that what is at the top of our\nminds will be likely to tunable out first \" (Essays in Psychical Research,\np. 117-18). Similarly Dr. Hodgson assures us that\u2014\"on March 18th,\n1895, . . . her deceased sister wrote with one hand, and G.P. with the\nother, while Phinuit was talking, all simultaneously on different\nsubjects \" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 294). For further proof of\nthis see Mr. Myers' articles on \"Automatic Writing,\" Mr. Gurney's\nexperiments in hypnotism, etc.\nThe point I am trying to emphasise is this :\u2014that the great majority\nof the bare facts in the sittings could have been obtained by the medium\nby means of telepathy from the subliminal consciousness of the sitter ;\u2014\nthough the latter's \"supraliminal\" might have been busy with other\nthoughts at the time, and expecting something entirely different.\nThat is no proof that telepathy was not in operation between the\nmedium and the sitter's subconsciousness.\nBut what of the facts that are not known to the sitter and have to be\nverified afterwards 1 Of these many are wrong, others are unevidential,\nand still others are unverifiable, whereas the residuum may be explained,\nperhaps, by means of the latent memory of news subconsciously heard,\nor by telepathy from the living person himself. On examination it will\nbe found that very few facts fail to come under this head ; and\nsurrounded as they are by more or less irrelevant talk and suggestive\nremarks, they may very possibly be the result of simple chance. Such\na theory is, I know, somewhat exasperating to those who are convinced\nof the genuineness of the phenomena ; but the following extract bears\nout my view precisely, and will be appreciated by all those Psychical\nResearchers who have had some phenomenon explained in a perfectly\nnormal manner, but upon which they were willing to stake their\nexistence as being supernormal in character. Lord Lytton remarked\nthat ...\" thus it is whenever the mind begins, unconsciously, to\nadmit the shadow of the supernatural ; the obvious is lost to the eye\nthat plunges its gaze into the obscure \" ( Strange Story, II., p. 1 3).\nIt will be observed, however, that I here limit myself only to facts,\u2014\n\f344 Hereward Carrington. [PAKT\nthe actual knowledge shown by the medium in the trance state,\u2014and I\ndo not attempt to weave those facts together so as to form a personality.\nOn that subject I shall have a theory to offer presently. But for the\nmoment I only wish to emphasise the point that all the actual facts\n(with very few exceptions) obtained and written out in these sittings\nmight have been drawn from one person's mind,\u2014his subliminal\nconsciousness,\u2014and, when Dr. Hodgson was holding his sittings for\nProfessor Hyslop, the knowledge displayed would yet be explainable on\nthis hypothesis, if space is no obstacle to telepathy, and the facts might\nstill be explained in this way, though they might be somewhat less\ndistinct and consecutive, and, indeed, this proves to be the case.\n\u00a7 7. The strong and the weak points of tlw Spiritistic hypothesis.\nTurning, now, to the Spiritistic hypothesis, it must be admitted that\nthere are many facts that point to this explanation as the true one-\nFor instance, the extremely rapid interplay of personality is, so far as\nmy own knowledge goes, unparalleled in the history of this subject ;\npersonalities, moreover, which differ so radically from each other in\ncharacter, knowledge and general characteristics. Again, the intimate\ncharacter of some of the messages conveyed, apparently, the almost\nirresistible conviction that the sitter was indeed conversing with his\ndeceased relative. But it is the combination of all these wonderful\ncharacteristics which conveys to the sitter the impression of the reality\nof this independent personality. As Dr. Hodgson has so well expressed\nit (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. xin., p. 360) :\n\" It is not this or that isolated piece of knowledge merely, not merely\nthis or that supernormal perception of an event occurring elsewhere,\nnot merely this or that subtle emotional appreciation for a distant\nliving friend,\u2014but the union of all these in a coherent personal plan\nwith responsive intellect and character, that suggests the specific\nidentity once known to us in a body incarnate.\"\nAll this is well known and recognized, but there are, on the other\nhand, many apparently irreconcilable points to be considered in\nconnection with this view of the case under consideration. Granting\nthat the confusion displayed in the automatic script may be accounted\nfor on the spiritistic hypothesis as readily as, or more readily than, on\nthe telepathic, there yet remain many extraordinary statements on the\npart of the communicators which certainly point to sheer ignorance, on\nsubjects well known to them alive, rather than to any flaw in the actual\ntransmission. Thus we have the remarkable utterances of Rector,\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 345\nImperator, etc., quoted by Mrs. Sidgwick in her \"Discussion\"\n(Proceedings, Vol. xv., p. 32). Mr. W. S. Moses, again, does not know\nthe names of his own \"controls\" (Vol. XIV., pp. 38, 40 and 41);\nsimilarly G.P. does not remember (?) his Greek (Vol. XV., p. 42).\nAll this, of course, arouses one's suspicions, and makes us accept with\nextreme caution any statement coming from this source. As a further\nexample of this point we have the apparently ludicrous statements as to\nthe occupation in the life to come. As Professor Hyslop remarks :\n\" Living in houses, listening to lectures are rather funny reproductions\nof a material existence\" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. xvi., p. 259).\nIndeed one would think so ! To reconcile these statements, Professor\nHyslop has to resort to the supposition that they are \"merely auto\nmatisms,\" and other purely arbitrary suppositions. For this there\nseems to be but little authority, and as the statements are made with\napparently the same assurance as the remainder of those set forth, one\ncan but wonder whether these utterances are not due in origin to one\ninitial source, and that source assuredly not \" spirits.\"\nThe same objections may be brought to bear upon the mistakes and\ncontradictions in the messages. These have been mentioned briefly in\nthe above paragraph, and whereas it may be admitted that partial\nmistakes and incoherences are in favour of the spiritistic hypothesis,\nwhat are we to say to the absolute ignorance shown, the contradictions,\nand grossly false information given by Mrs. Piper's \"controls,\" or the\ncommunicators themselves ? These points, together with the fishing,\nshuffling, and tentative questions (more frequent in the Phinuit days\nthan now), strongly point to Mrs. Piper's secondary personality as the\norigin of the entire phenomena.\n\u00a7 8. Phinuit a secondary personality.\nOne of the strongest objections, however, to the spiritistic hypothesis\nis (in the present writer's opinion), what he has chosen to term \" the\nevolution of Phinuit.\" Now this gentleman\u2014who, we are thankful to\nsay, no longer manifests in Mrs. Piper's trances\u2014was almost universally\nconsidered to be a secondary personality, and although he might,\n(perhaps), have been what he claimed, i.e. a spirit, the facts were so\noverwhelmingly opposed to it and there is so little evidence for his\nexistence that the assumption of his spiritual nature (!) is, to say the\nleast, obviously gratuitous. His inability to speak French\u2014though a\nFrenchman ; his ignorance of medicine\u2014though a doctor ; and his\nutter failure to prove his identity, or even to know his own name\n\f346 Hereward Carrington. [PART\n(see Vol. VIII., p. 53), all are contrary to the claims of Spiritism. But\nit is unnecessary to dwell on this point longer. Phinuit is, I believe,\ngenerally acknowledged to be a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper ;\nbut the argument of some spiritists is that even granting this, know\nledge was frequently displayed by \"spirits\" independently of his\ncontrol, and which prima facie bore distinct marks of the communicator's\nidentity ; not to speak of those who have communicated since Phinuit's\ndisappearance. To this argument I reply that Phinuit was one of Mrs.\nPiper's first \" controls\"; that he announced to the world at large his own\nspirit existence as confidently as did the best communicators, and that\nit was through him that almost all the alleged spirits conversed with the\nsitters, in the early days. Professor Hyslop's ingenious theory of the\nsecondary personality being a kind of borderland or \" neutral ground,\" if\nI may so express it, between the living and the dead would explain\nthis last point, however. But the fact remains that one of Mrs. Piper's\nfirst \"controls\" was no spirit at all, but merely a secondary personality !\nHow is it possible, then, for us to discriminate between Phinuit and,\nlet us say, Eector or Imperator\u2014neither of whom has ever proved his\nidentity satisfactorily ? If one is a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper,\nwhy not all ?\u2014for Phinuit's \" dramatic play \" was certainly equal to\nanything that either Imperator or Rector supplies us with, if not better.\nIn those days the evidence presented facts which tended to show the\ninfluence of living minds as well as those of the dead, but thought-\ntransference from the living seemed to be gradually eliminated, and the\nevidence to point more and more strongly to the action of disembodied\nspirits alone. Now this would be perfectly rational on either hypo\nthesis. On the Spiritistic, it would represent the gradual improvement\nof the \"machine \"; a \"clearing the decks,\" so to speak, of all useless and\nunnecessary encumbrances, and affording greater facility for direct spirit\nintervention. On the telepathic theory, on the other hand, this\n\" clearance \" would probably represent the gradual formation of the\nfaculty for combining suggestions and telepathic ideas into a separate\npersonality. Of course this is a very provisional theory, and the\nspiritistic explanation has still many points in its favour. But because\nspiritism is the easiest explanation (at present), are we justified in\naccepting it without further attempts to explain these phenomena\notherwise ? Most assuredly no ! If this had been the policy of the\nS.P.R. from its foundation, we should never have reached many of the\nimportant truths which it has now firmly established, and many facts\nwould still have passed for \"supernatural\" amongst the majority,\nwhich are now accepted more or less as a matter of course, simply on\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 347\naccount of the reasonable basis upon which these facts rest, and are\nexplained ; (e.g. automatic writing).\n\u00a7 9. An Analysis of \" Psychical Research.\"\nFor example, nearly the whole range of \" psychical research \" could\nbe explained by that one word\u2014spirits\u2014if accepted ; yet many would\nanalyse these phenomena very differently ! Thus : all the \" physical\nphenomena\" of Spiritism and \"Poltergeists\" would be explained as\neither fraud, hallucination or telekinesis : all clairvoyance, prevision,\nand precognition as the result of chance, illusions, and hallucinations of\nmemory, and (in the first of these at any rate), as imposture very\nfrequently : all apparitions of the living and dead as either subjective\nor telepathic hallucinations : all haunted houses as a combination of\nfraud, illusion, hallucination, expectancy, suggestion, and, perhaps,\ntelepathy from the living or \"some subtle physical influence,\"\u2014in\naddition to normal sounds and noises greatly magnified ; aye, even\nthought-transference itself might be a form of \"brain-waves\" or \"ether-\nvibrations,\" granting that it is accepted at all ! Such an analysis is,\nvery probably, repugnant to many minds, especially to those who have\nbecome more or less convinced of the reality of a \" life beyond death,\"\nand, whereas I do not altogether believe in the strict analysis just\ngiven, still, when once a belief in the supernormal begins to operate,\nthe \" common-sense \" side of the question is frequently ignored\u2014as\nsomewhat repugnant to the feelings of those concerned. But I will\nagain quote from that clear-brained, level-headed thinker, Lord Lytton,\nwhere he says (Strange Story, Vol. II., p. 284) :\n\"The moment one deals with things beyond our comprehension, and\nin which our own senses are appealed to and baffled, we revolt from the\nProbable, as it appears to the senses of those who have not experienced\nwhat we have.\"\nWhat a truism !\n\u00a7 10. Tfo possibility of over-estimating the value of the evidence.\nThe object of the previous remarks is to pave the way for a few of\nsomewhat similar type applied to the problem of the Piper trance\nphenomena. Mrs. Sidgwick thinks that the \"evidence for direct\ncommunication . . . may easily be over-estimated\" (Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. xv., p. 21). At the time that this was written, the present writer\nwas less inclined to accept that statement as true than he is now, after\nhaving seen that Professor Hyslop unknowingly colours\u2014highly colours\n\f348 Hereward Carrington. [PAKT\n\u2014many incidents which, looked at from another standpoint, fall within\nthe range of a perfectly normal explanation.\nThus :\u2014Professor Hyslop makes much of the fact that Mr. Carruthers\n\u2014one of the \"communicators\"\u2014does not recognize Dr. Hodgson, while\nthe latter is \" sitting \" on his behalf, and during his absence (Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. xvi., p. 194). Now this is of frequent occurrence in cases\nof secondary personality, when, in the abnormal condition, the subject\ndoes not recognize former friends and acquaintances, or even his own\nwife and family (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. V., p. 391 ; Vol. vil., pp.\n249, 256, 257, etc.). If multiplex personality be assumed in this case,\nthe non-recognition of Dr. Hodgson is certainly what would be expected.\nAgain, the lack of clearness in the communications of suicides ' may be\ndue to unconscious suggestion, perhaps telepathically conveyed. More\nover, so far as the published notes go, they are surely insufficient to\nestablish anything with certainty; the element of chance being too\ngreat.\n\u00a7 11. Some advantages of the \" secondary personality\" hypothesis.\nOn the whole, therefore, there are many points in favour of the\n\" secondary personality \" hypothesis ; and, apart from the supernormal\nknowledge displayed, and the dextrous interweaving of the facts gained\ninto a distinct personality, the only rational argument against this\ntheory is that the personalities displayed in the Piper case are so\ninfinitely superior in style, graphic exposition of character, and dramatic\nplay of personality to all other known cases of a similar character, that\nwe are, some say, almost entitled to doubt whether or not they belong\neven to the same genus. This supposition appears to me absolutely\nunwarrantable. It must be remembered that the difference displayed\nis purely one of degree, not of kind ; the superiority consists simply in a\ngreater isolation of the different personalities, and in their far more\nrapid interplay than is generally the case. Just why this great\nsuperiority should exist is indeed a most puzzling problem ; and the\nonly theory that seems at all tenable is that under the vastly greater\nopportunities for improvement which Mrs. Piper has enjoyed, over\nother mediums, the \" conditions \" have so benefited her that she has\ndeveloped into a stronger medium ; meaning by this\u2014on the hypo\nthesis proposed below\u2014that Mrs. Piper's brain has greatly developed\nthe capacity for combining the numerous suggestions and telepathic\nimpulses conveyed from the sitter's mind ; that these personalities are\n'See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XHL, p. 376.\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 349\ncomposed, as Professor Newbold suggests, by the \" weaving together by\nMrs. Piper's nervous mechanism of all the complex suggestions of the\nseance room, supplemented by telepathic and clairvoyant impressions\ngot in connection with the sitter and with the articles which he brings \"\n(Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. xiv., p. 9).\nIn the above argument, it will be understood, I did not take into\naccount the supernormal knowledge displayed, but merely the unity of\nconsciousness and individual personality represented. That Mrs. Piper\nshould be so far superior to all other mediums on this point may to\nsome appear a strong argument for the spiritistic hypothesis ; but when\none considers the years spent in the careful training of this faculty,\nunder the constant observation of Dr. Hodgson, it appears equally\nplausible on the telepathic. And if we are challenged to produce\nanother Mrs. Piper for the purpose of proving the theory above\nadvanced, we reply that two such cases would be just as puzzling and\ninexplicable as one,\u2014as either the spiritistic or the telepathic hypothesis\nmight be again applied to the solution with precisely the same result as\noccurred in the first case\u2014viz., a continued diversity of opinion, each\nparty claiming that the second case proved their theory ! If the tele\npathic hypothesis is a strain upon our credulity, so, taking everything\ninto account, is also the spiritistic.\n\u00a7 12. Comparison of the Piper personalities with other known, cases of a\nsimilar type.\nNow one of Professor Hyslop's greatest objections to the \"secondary\npersonality \" hypothesis is that, as a rule, the phenomena observed are\nfar more mechanical than is the case with Mrs. Piper's \"controls.\" This\nis undoubtedly the case, and, standing alone, this is a very strong card\nin the spiritist's hand. Personally, I know of no other case even\napproximately similar to the marvellous \" interplay of personality with\nreciprocal exchange of ideas, as if real, that so characterises the Piper\ncase \" (Proceedings, Vol. xvi., p. 279). My only reply to this is, firstly,\nto again emphasize the fact that the difference is one of degree, and not\nof kind ; and, secondly, that secondary personalities are not invariably\nas mechanical as Professor Hyslop maintains. To quote one simple case\n(that of Ansel Bourne), I need but remind the reader that his\nsecondary personality\u2014personating A. J. Brown\u2014was so completely\nnatural that not one of his many newly-acquired friends and\nacquaintances ever detected anything uncommon or unusual in his\nconduct during a period of several weeks (loc. ctl. Vol. vu., pp. 221-257).\n\f350 Hereward Carringtan. [PART\nThe case is not in any way analogous to the Piper phenomena, but\nmerely illustrates the fact that secondary personalities are capable of\nreproducing, in a perfectly natural manner, a distinct personality, which\nis itself absolutely unknown to, and wholly different from, the original\nsupraliminal consciousness of the subject. Indeed this is recognized by\nProfessor Hyslop, for he says :\n\" The crucial test of Spiritism, in this and all other cases, must turn\nupon the question of telepathy to furnish the data upon which any\nsecondary consciousness has to work. Until it is more fully studied,\nwe shall have to assume that secondary personality is equal to the task\nof explaining the dramatic play of personality, and all non-evidential\ndata, and base our conclusion upon the insufficiency of telepathy to\nsupply the objective facts in evidence of personal identity \" (Proceedings\nS.P.K., Vol. XVI., p. 292).\n\u00a7 13. Spiritism versus Telepathy and Secondary PersonalUy combined.\nWe come, therefore, to the combination of telepathy and secondary\npersonality as an explanation of the phenomena under discussion.\nThis is admittedly the strongest antagonist which the spiritistic\nhypothesis has to face, but it seems extremely doubtful whether it will\naccount for all the phenomena recorded, or no. Personally, I am\nexceedingly doubtful as to its ability to do so. But if we reject every\nhypothesis in turn, as insufficient to account for the accepted facts, we\nshall be driven by sheer weight of evidence into an acceptance of the\nspiritistic hypothesis. Possibly this may occur at some future date,\nbut for the present let us set that to one side, and, after examining\nall the remaining hypotheses in turn, and finding them insufficient to\naccount satisfactorily for the phenomena observed, we must endeavour\nto invent some hypothesis which will account for a greater proportion\nof the facts than any hitherto advanced\u2014or remain without any\nhypothesis at all. This last state of mind is certainly anything but\nsatisfactory ; and it remains for us, therefore, to frame some theory\nwhich will fulfil the requirements as nearly as possible.\nNaturally each one of us looks at any evidence presented for our\njudgment in an entirely different light ; according to his outlook upon\nthe Universe, and his own subjective mental attitude towards these\nsubjects. Consequently, each one of us has some more or less vague\ntheory as to the source from whence those writings proceed, and it is\nupon my own hypothesis, gradually evolved from the repeated readings\nof the Piper reports and script, that I beg to offer a few brief remarks;\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 351\nnot that I expect them to receive any acceptance, be it observed, but\nrather that they seem to afford at least a plausible alternative to the\nspiritistic theory, without so much straining upon the alternative\nhypotheses.\n\u00a7 1 4. Tracing the growth of a telepathically initiated secondary personality.\nTo build up this theory, step by step, I shall be obliged to go \"as\nfar back \" as hypnotism ; meaning by this that, in the beginning at\nleast, we are working upon a (comparatively speaking) perfectly normal\nand rational basis. The late Mr. Myers, then, maintained that almost\nthe only uniform phenomenon in the hypnotic trance was the\n\" formation of a secondary chain of memory,\" and claimed that\n\" hypnotism . . . may be regarded as constituting one special case\nwhich falls under a far wider category,\u2014the category, namely, of\ndevelopments of a secondary personality\" (Proceedings, Vol. v., p. 387).\nNor is it even necessary to revert to hetero-suggestion for the produc\ntion of this phenomenon ; it is possible to produce alteration of\npersonality by auto-suggestion alone ;\u2014\" I have seen a man cultivate\nthe power of automatic writing. Another learned to change his\npersonality, while the third would become somnambulic \" (Hypnotism.\nBy J. R. Cocke, M.D., p. 304). In all these cases, a distinct per\nsonality (and without any verbal suggestion whatever, it will be observed)\nis induced, together with the usual loss of memory on \" coming-to.\"\nTo revert now to the published experiments in thought-transference.\nFew psychical researchers will deny the existence of this supernormal\nmethod of communication, I take it, or doubt that telepathy, from\nhowever great a distance, is indeed a fact. Combining, now, the facts of\ntelepathic suggestion and hypnotic suggestion we come, by an easy\ntransition, to the phenomenon of telepathic hypnotism, which is\u2014\naccording to the definition given above\u2014the telepathic production of a\nsecondary personality.\nThis, therefore, brings us at least one step nearer an understanding\nof the Piper \" controls \" than heretofore. We have found that\nsecondary, and perhaps multiplex, personality may be induced by\ntelepathy, each personality retaining its own chain of memories and its\nindividual identity ; yet generally lacking that supernormal knowledge\ndisplayed by the communicators in the Piper case. The trance is very\nprobably closely allied to the hypnotic, yet is not precisely the same\n(see Proceedings of the American S.P.R., p. 105), and the \"controls\"\nwould represent, on this hypothesis, telepathically produced secondary\npersonalities.\n\f352 Hereward Carrington. [PART\nBut it is the facts revealed by these personalities, rather than the\npersonalities themselves,\u2014the supernormal knowledge displayed, and\nnot simply the strong indications of an independent intelligence,\u2014which\ncause us to turn towards spiritism for an explanation. Indeed, were it\nnot for the pertinent remarks and proofs of \" shared memory \" given,\nwe should have no cause for supposing that either \"parapathy\"i or\ntelepathy had any share whatever in the formation of these person\nalities. But as the very \"ground-work\" of their identity, so to speak, is\ncomposed of these very scraps of knowledge, we must assume that\n\"noopathy\" enters into the case, both in the actual formation of the\npersonality, and in keeping it, when once formed, supplied with\npertinent facts.\n\u00a715. The \" Difficulties \" of the \" Telepathic Hypothesis \" simplified.\nWe now come, therefore, to the very heart of the problem\u2014the\ncrucial point of the whole case. Granting that this personality is once\ntelepathically initiated, whence does it derive the continuous stream of\ninformation written out in the trance state ; especially those facts not\nwithin the sitter's memory or knowledge at the time ? The theory of\n\"discriminative telepathy,\" if I may so call it, has been met with\nalmost crushing arguments by Professor Hyslop, and were this the only\nalternative to spiritism we should, I venture to think, be almost forced\ninto an acceptance of the latter theory. But I do not believe that our\nchoice rests between these two hypotheses only. I contend that the\npersonality displayed through Mrs. Piper's automatic writing was\nobtained\u2014not by telepathy between the medium's brain and distant\npersons in this world, but by parapathy from the sitter's subliminal\nconsciousness : that it was extracted thence in toto ; identity, memory,\npersonal knowledge, and individual consciousness, just as displayed,\nwithout resort to any source of knowledge further than the sitter's\nown sub-consciousness, and was removed thence in one compact\nmass, as it were, rather than that it was collected piecemeal from the\nends of the earth. (How this entered the sitters subliminal conscious\nness I shall endeavour to show presently, \u00a7 19.) Of course this does\nnot mean that all the knowledge displayed in the trance condition,\nthrough Mrs. Piper's hand, was obtained at one time from the sitter's\nsubliminal self, but that the facts themselves were all there, and\nobtained from that one fount on different occasions, I do contend.\n'For definitions of \"parapathy\" and \"noopathy\" see Professor Hyslop's\nReport, p. 125, foot-note.\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 353\nThat facts which we were totally unconscious of ever having known\nmay be obtained by automatic writing is a well-known fact, and Mrs.\nPiper seems to have been the automaton ; thus, instead of our sub\nliminal consciousness writing unknown facts through our own hands,\nMrs. Piper writes them for us, the latent knowledge being supplied by\nparapathy from our own sub-consciousness.\n\u00a7 16. Rdsumt of the previous argument.\nThus far nearly everything suggested has been said before in more\nor less similar language, and it but remains for me briefly to\nrecapitulate, before passing on to this, our last and most crucial\nproblem, viz., the knowledge of facts apparently unknown to the sitter.\nWe have seen (i.) that our \"spirits\" may not be spirits at all, but\ntelepathically produced personalities, (ii.) That the requisite dramatic\nplay of personality and unity of consciousness would accompany the\nsecondary personality thus created, (iii.) That the unverified and\nunverifiable facts in the sitting cannot be counted as evidential ; and\n(iv.), that those verifiable facts already known to the sitter cannot be\nproved to lie outside the limits of telepathy, if the facts were known,\nat any time : (a) to the supraliminal, or (b) to the subliminal conscious\nness of the sitter, or of any one within the immediate vicinity. If we\nadmit the above conclusions, and,\u2014according to the rigorously scientific\nelimination process, we should admit them,\u2014then those who defend the\nspiritistic hypothesis are forced to base their faith upon the facts which\nwere, to the best of the sitter's belief, wholly without his memory or con\nsciousness, and had never become known to him through the recognized\nchannels of sense. Of these, a portion may have been known to the\nsitter and temporarily or permanently forgotten by him, while another\nportion may have become known to him subliminally, but never have\nrisen above the threshold of consciousness\u2014such as conversations heard\nwhen asleep, etc. Of the remainder of the facts in these reports, it\nwould be a very nice question to settle as to how far chance may be\naccountable for them. Amidst the confusion and excitement in most\nof these sittings; amidst the shufHing, stumbling, and \"fishing\"\u2014(more\ncommon under the Phinuit regime than now, however) ; amidst the\nmany tentative remarks and absolute falsity of numerous positive\nstatements, it would be almost surprising if we did not find some true\nincidents which would be applicable to any one particular case, either\nto the sitter himself or to some relative or friend of his.\nBut it must be admitted that all this is purely speculative, and\nperhaps unwarrantable. We must not strain our \" perfectly natural \"\n\f354 Hereward Carrington. [PART\nsolutions to the breaking point in too many places at once, or the chain\nmay become too weak to support the strain placed upon it. Both sides\nof the question must be judged fairly, and without prejudice, and if it\nis possible to arrive at any solution of these problems without reverting\nto what Mr. Lang calls \" animism,\" it is clearly our duty to do so ; but\nwe must not make ludicrous attempts at explanations which are both\nunsupported by evidence, and prima facie extremely improbable ;\u2014\n\" There is a point at which the explanations of common-sense arouse\nscepticism\" (Cock Lane and Common Sense, p. 60).\nConceding this point to the spiritistic side of the controversy,\ntherefore, I shall assume, for the sake of argument, that the facts\nobtained by Professor Hyslop by means of Mrs. Piper's automatic\nwriting, were not known by normal means and forgotten by his supra-\nliminal self, though lodged within his subliminal memory, and that\nchance is insufficient to account for the successful statements made.\nWe are now face to face with the most\u2014and only remaining\u2014impor\ntant problem of all the Piper or analogous phenomena, viz., how is this\nknowledge, unknown to the sitter, obtained ? The hypothesis of \" spirits \"\nand exclusive telepathy from widely scattered living persons both\nappear to me exceedingly improbable ;\u2014the former for obvious reasons,\nthe latter because of the vast assumptions necessary and difficulties\nencountered within the hypothesis itself. But if we reject both of\nthese theories (together with \" the Absolute and the Devil ! \"), we are\nforced, it appears to me, into some such hypothesis as the following.\n\u00a7 17. The writer's theory for explaining these phenomena : Initial Remarks.\nIn the first place, I should suggest that many\u2014perhaps all\u2014of the\nthoughts in the minds of those about us are constantly being \" tele-\npathed,\" as it were, to the brains of others; that each individual\nconsciousness is the nucleus and radiating point of hundreds of such\ntelepathic messages, which, though constantly being received and\ndispatched, are entirely carried on below the level of consciousness,\nso that we never become cognizant of them except in some abnormal\ncondition, or under some extraordinary emotional influence ; when this\nthought tends to merge into consciousness as an automatism (sensory\nor motor). Occasionally one of these telepathic messages rises above\nthe level of consciousness in the form of a veridical dream or phantasm,\na crystal-vision, a warning voice, a restraining hand (hallucinatory) ;\nor, again, in the numerous motor types of messages, such as automatic\nand planchette writing, trance utterance, table-tipping, etc. All this\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 355\nhas been discussed so fully by the late Mr. Myers, in his papers on\n\" The Subliminal Consciousness,\" that I need not have entered into the\nproblem at all were it not for the fact that whereas former writers\nhave regarded these telepathic messages as rare and sporadic, the\npresent theory suggests that they are of almost constant occurrence,\nbut very rarely merge into consciousness, save as an automatism, or\nwhen the medium gets en rapport with our \"subliminal,\" and so attains\nthe facts by unconscious telepathy.i\n\u00a718. Objections to the above theory and replies thereto.\nThe only serious objections to this hypothesis are (i) that if this\nwere actually the case, one's brain would be the recipient of vibrations,\nnot only from one's friends and relatives, but from every living being in\nthe universe; and (ii) that, even granting that the facts are telepathically\ntransmitted as suggested above, they would form an indescribable chaos\nfrom which it would be almost impossible to select the right facts for\nthe person thought of; thus making the medium's telepathic powers\nworse than useless : for, instead of an orderly array of thoughts, con\nnected with some particular individual, and classified, to a certain\nextent, by some unknown association process, with his individuality,\nthe medium's subliminal consciousness would find itself groping vaguely\namidst a bewildering mass of evidential material, strewn helter-skelter\nthroughout the sitter's sub-consciousness.\nI shall answer the second of these charges first, thus \" clearing the\nground,\" so to speak, for the reply to objection number one.\nNow it must firstly be noticed that these mistakes frequently do\noccur,\u2014the right facts are given, but in relation to the wrong person.\nThis is precisely what we should expect on the above hypothesis, and\nis somewhat difficult to reconcile with the spiritistic theory. Thus\nProfessor Hyslop says (in reference to a string of facts just given in his\ni Since writing the above, I find that Mr. Myers has advanced very much this\nsame view, from a slightly different standpoint. In Phantasms oj the Living\n(Vol. ii., p. 302), the following sentence occurs: \"I conceive that, if telepathy\nbe a fact, something of diffused telepathic percolation is probably always taking\nplace. This at least is what the analogy of the limitless and continuous action\nof physical forces would suggest. . . . And similarly it is not unreasonable to\nsuppose that the same telergy, which is directed in a moment of crisis towards a\nman's dearest friend, may be radiating from him always towards all other minds,\nand chiefly towards the minds which have most in common with his own.\" See\nalso From India to the Planet Mart, p. 387-8, where this point is just touched\nupon.\n\f356 Hereward Carringtcm. [PART\nReport),\u2014\"In fact the whole passage is definitely applicable to my\nbrother Robert, and not to the others.\" (Proceedings, Vol. XVI., p. 77).i\nMuch of the confusion in the Reports which was previously explained\nas the rapid and unknown changes of the communicators may also be\ndue to this cause. The facts are more or less confused and ambiguous,\n\u2014sometimes applicable to the wrong person rather than to the right\none ; oftentimes applicable to almost any one at all. But I shall not\ndwell too much upon this point, for, though many mistakes are com\nmitted and considerable confusion sometimes apparent, the result,\ngenerally speaking, is that the incident in question is usually connected\nwith the right person. We are left, therefore, to speculate as to the\nforce or energy at work which would separate these telepathic ideas\nfrom different minds into the fully rounded-out personalities, and\ncombine these thoughts into more or less complete individualities.\nThere are, of course, two conceivable methods by which this result\nmight be obtained. (i.) The facts may be associated with that\nindividual, and classified, as they enter our brain,\u2014thus forming part of\na group of facts (telepathically obtained), which in themselves form\nthat individuality by moans of some association process ;\u2014or (ii.) that\nthe facts are in reality in a very confused condition, but are singled\nout, as in some way distinctive, by the medium, and combined by her\nsubliminal self into a separate individuality, in the very process of\nabstraction.\nIt would be necessary to assume in this case that the fragmentary\nknowledge gained is in some way distinctive ; each thought or memory\nbeing \"labelled,\" so to speak, and applicable to that one person solely.\nThis may indeed be the case to a certain extent, for even when our\nsupraliminal consciousness hears the name of some well-known friend,\nit is at once associated with a host of memories and recollections con\ncerning that individual ; and we may surely suppose that the subliminal\nself, with its far wider range of possibilities, and highly developed\nmechanism of susceptibility and suggestion, may discriminate between\nthe thoughts of one person and those of another.\ni See also the following statements in the last part of Proceedings issued (XLIV).\nOn page 195 (Vol. xvn.) Mrs. Verrall says : \" But I have no doubt that a certain\nnumber of statements classed as incorrect or unverifiable are as a fact statements\nwholly irrelevant to their context and belonging to some other series of communi\ncations.\" Again (p. 136) Mr. Piddington wrote : \" In face of this freah evidence,\nI think it cannot reasonably be doubted that the three statements . . . wrongly\ngiven by Mrs. Thompson in trance in connection with Miss Clegg, owe their\norigin to reminisceuces of Mrs. Thompson's dead sister, Mrs. Turner, which\n' Nelly ' got hold of, but wted in a wrong relation.\" The italics are mine.\n\fXLV.] Discuasion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 357\nAs to the first of these objections (that, on the hypothesis proposed,\none's brain would be the recipient of vibrations from every living\norganism indiscriminately), the theory just advanced, as an answer to\nobjection (ii), would partially dispose of this objection also, and it only\nremains for us to answer the natural inquiry\u2014why should our friends\ninfluence us more than other persons 1 If this constant telepathic\ncommunication is a fact, why should some thoughts influence us more\nthan others, merely because they happen to belong to one's friend or\nrelative? Here is indeed a complex problem, and one which will\nrequire all our ingenuity to solve, but, in place of any better forth\ncoming explanation, I would suggest the following hypothesis, which,\nbold venture as it is, yet seems to fulfil the requirements of the case\nbetter than any other so far advanced.\n\u00a7 19. The writer's theory for explaining these phenomena : Continuation\nof the theory.\nIt has frequently been observed that two persons, when constantly\nin each other's society, tend, very frequently, to \"grow alike,\" both\nphysically, in their modes of thought, and in their general mental and\nmoral \" make-up.\" It is as though their minds had become adjusted to\none another's, so to speak ; that interchange of thought was becoming\nboth a more frequent phenomenon, and that the process of communica\ntion was being facilitated as the time progressed, and the two persons\nin question came to know one another better, and to let their minds\nrun more and more in the same channels. Now by what process is this\nmental telegraphy facilitated 1 In other words,\u2014if wo assume that\ntelepathic communication is a fact, and that it is, in such cases, appar\nently developed, what is the actual mental process involved which\nwould facilitate its action?\nIn answer to this question, I would suggest that the two persons\nhere involved have had their mental receivers and transmitters gradually\nadjusted to one another's ; so that, whereas at first only a few \" divergent\nrays \" are received by us, as time progressed and our mental trans\nmitters and receivers began to be adjusted at the proper foci to the\nother person's receivers and transmitters respectively, the process\nbecomes clearer and more frequent, and leads to almost constant sub\nconscious telepathic interaction between the two subliminal selves.\nIt will be seen then that, on this hypothesis, facts and personal\nknowledge may be freely exchanged without the recipients being aware\nof that fact either at the time or afterwards, unless it emerges into\n2A\n\f358 Hereward Carringt&n. [PART\nconsciousness as an automatism, or is abstracted thence by the medium,\nand given back to the sitter as a piece of entirely new information.\nIn fact, all knowledge apparently unknown to the sitter is merely\nfiltered through Mrs. Piper's brain, and, mingling with her \"spirits\" or\nsecondary personalities, is expressed through the medium's hand with\nthe invariably dramatic setting, thus conveying a strong impression\nthat the messages are in reality due in origin to the action of disem\nbodied spirits.\nWe here arrive, therefore, at a conclusion which, although it does\nnot disprove spiritism, nevertheless renders that hypothesis unnecessary.\nFor, if we can account for the knowledge displayed by the medium\nwhich is, to the best of his belief, unknown to the sitter, then most\nassuredly there is nothing else of such moment in the spiritistic\nhypothesis, as to detain us from rejecting it as at least gratuitous.\nFor I claim that this apparently unknown knowledge may indeed be\nknown to the sitter, although he himself may be entirely unaware of\nsuch knowledge,\u2014it having been gained, by unconscious telepathy from th^st.\nin constant association with him ; and that many facts undivulged may\nstill be within the safe keeping of his subliminal self, ready to be\nevoked under certain conditions at present too little understood to be\nextensively practised ; and this, it appears to me, might be the solution\nof the Piper and all kindred phenomena.\n\u00a7 20. Conclusion.\nIn conclusion be it said that I do not intend this to be more than a\ntentative hypothesis, and that I am in no way fighting or opposed\nto the philosophy of spiritualism. Realizing, as I do, the tremendous\nimportance of the question being definitely decided either for\nor against this belief, and the revulsion of feeling which must\nnecessarily follow in the wake of any such thing as a \"scientific demon\nstration of a future life,\" it appears to me that, before accepting it, we\nshould strain every conceivable hypothesis to its utmost before \"letting\ndown the bars \" before the proof of immortality. To the spiritist, this\nattitude must seem to denote an extraordinary frame of mind ; it is\nhard for him to appreciate the tremendous impediments and extreme\ndifficulty any one of a materialistic temperament experiences in attempt\ning even to conceive any form of a \" future life \" whatever. But this\nis a matter of personal opinion from an \" outsider's \" point of view.\nWhat one's opinion would be were one in the place of Dr. Hodgson or\nProfessor Hyslop, it is impossible to say, but for mankind in general, bas-\n\fXLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 359\ning their whole belief on the printed pages of our Proceedings, it would\nseem that this absolute proof is still wanting, and that the majority of\nus are still inclined to murmur with old Omar :\n\" Strange, is it not ? that of the myriads who\nBefore us pass'd the door of darkness through,\nNot one returns to tell us of the road\nWhich to discover we must travel too ! \"\n\f360 Professor J. H. Hyslop. [PART\nREMARKS ON MR. CARRINGTON'S PAPER.\nBY PROFESSOR J. H. HYSLOP.\nTHE spirit of Mr. Carrington's paper, which is sympathetic, makes it\nunnecessary to waste my time in getting at the issue involved, and\nhence I shall simply take up each section in its order and make such\ncomments on points concerned as the nature of the question requires.\nI shall premise my remarks, however, with an important considera\ntion which I mean to keep in view in all my comments. There are two\nquestions in the problem of psychical research in so far as it has to do\nwith the spiritistic hypothesis. The first is the question of explanation ;\nthe second is the question of evidence. Both demands must be satisfied\nin any hypothesis put forward, whether it is spiritistic or not. The\ntheory must actually explain, and it must have evidence in its support.\nIf the hypothesis presents only one of these requirements, it is defective,\nand science cannot entertain it, even though it happen to be true\noutside of our knowledge. Science forms its convictions not on mere\npossibilities, but on knowledge\u2014the knowledge that the theory explains\nand that it has evidence. This criterion will be applied throughout\nmy remarks. I shall use now one and now the other aspect of it as\noccasion demands.\n(1) Mr. Carrington misunderstands the whole case when he says that\nit is an a priori objection to the probability of the spiritistic theory\n\" that only one medium should have supplied us with sufficiently strong\nevidence of ' spirit return ' to make that hypothesis the most probable\none.\" The reason for making so much out of the Piper case is not that\nit is so unique, but that we have in it both quantity and quality of\nmaterial to justify the discussion of the hypothesis in all its complexity.\nMrs. Piper is not the only medium from which such phenomena have\nbeen obtained. There have been plenty of them in history representing\nphenomena similar in character so far as simple supernormal quality is\nconcerned. But they have not been the subject of prolonged scientific\n\fXLV.] Remarks on Mr. Carrvngtoris Paper. 361\nexperiment and inquiry. It is the latter fact, and this fact alone, that\nis the reason for putting emphasis on the Piper case. It is the only\none that justifies the scientific man in saying that he has sufficient\nevidence in it to make out a case which will explain other less evidential\ninstances as well. The spiritistic theory does not depend wholly on\nthe Piper case, but only for its consistency in a large mass of facts and\nits exceptionally scientific character.\n(2) I have nothing to say regarding section 2, except to indicate\nthe reservation which I make in regard to the actual explanatory\npowers of telepathy and clairvoyance. I make bold to assert that\nthey explain absolutely nothing, not even non-spiritistic phenomena of a\nsupernormal character. They are simply evidential criteria ; that is,\nowing to the possibility of such facta as they denominate, we simply\nfind it more difficult to get the required evidence for a spiritistic theory.\nOf. Journal S.P.R., Vol. X., pp. 214-215; also my report, Proceedings,\nVol. xvi., pp. 294, and 127 footnote. One of the most amusing things\nto me in the whole history of psychical research is the tendency of its\nmembers to appeal to telepathy as explaining both spiritistic and\nother phenomena after it has been carefully defined as merely a name\nfor phenomena still to be explained. The term was adopted to describe\nmental coincidences which are not due to chance and which have some\ncausal nexus, but it is not a name for the cause, and hence cannot be\nused to explain anything. As an explanatory principle, it represents\nsimply the unknown, and all explanation must appeal to a known principle,\nnot necessarily a fact known at the time. I took special pains to indicate\nthis briefly in my report (p. 294), where I showed that human conscious\nness . was a known principle, and was only extended in supposing its\ncontinuance. It is thus capable of explaining the same kind of facts\nthat it explained in actual life. Telepathy and clairvoyance explain\nnothing. They are simply names for facts, if facts, still to be explained.\n(Cf. Proceedings, Vol. XVII., pp. 248-9 and 261 : Journal S.P.R., Vol. x., p.\n214). Hence I deny at the very outset the fundamental assumption of\nmy critics, and maintain that the spiritistic hypothesis has a fulcrum\nof some importance in supporting itself. If it is to be set aside, we\nmust prove the explanatory powers of the alternatives employed, and\nnot gratuitously assume that we are explaining a phenomenon by call\ning it a mysterious name.\n(3) Mr. Carrington's quotation from my report misses the point.\nI was simply rejecting the combination of theories on the scientific\nprinciple that a theory which does not apply in the main features of\nits nature to the whole mass of phenomena is not applicable at all.\n\f362 Profewor J. H. Hyslop. [PART\nThe Ptolemaic theory of astronomy explained the solar system as fully\nas the Copernican system, but not as simply. The combination of\n\"cycles and epicycles\" covered the field well enough, but the com\nbination was both unnecessary and too complex to satisfy the proper\nmethod of science, which is that a theory must be simple and have no\nadjuncts which are necessitated merely by its own inadequacy. The\nadjuncts must be known or proved facts naturally fitted to the theory.\nThe combination of Mr. Carrington has no unity, and is merely\narbitrary. The spiritistic theory gives unity to a far larger mass of\nfacts than any of the other hypotheses enumerated by Mr. Carrington,\nand which he rejects as insufficient when taken alone to account for the\nresults. The adjuncts which are attached to the spiritistic theory are\ndrawn from normal and abnormal psychology, and represent known\nfacts in living human experience, so that in drawing our explanatory\ngeneral principle from a known human consciousness and our adjuncts\nfrom accepted psychology, we cover the field by a simple theory, and\nmust reject the combination which Mr. Carrington mentions for the\nsame reason that the Ptolemaic astronomy was rejected in favour of\nthe Copernican.\n(4) In section 5, Mr. Carrington disputes my contention that the\nPiper phenomena are experiments and not spontaneous occurrences.\nThere is a very decided misunderstanding here of the passage which\nhe quotes from me, and which he disputes. I drew the distinction\nbetween the \"experimental\" and \"spontaneous\" to contrast the Piper\nphenomena with those of apparitions. We can exercise no influence\non the occurrence of apparitions, but we can at least choose the\ntime for the Piper phenomena and ask questions during the sittings.\nThese facts give the case the general nature of an experiment. The\nspontaneity involved in the phenomena occurs, we may say, only\nwhen the \" communications \" are allowed to take their own course.\nThis is for the evidential purpose of excluding both suggestion and\nguessing. But asking questions completely destroys the spontaneous\nnature of the phenomena precisely as questions in the experimental\nwork of psychology assume the problems of the laboratory to be\nexperimental. Besides, in any conception of the term, the Piper case\nis experimental in comparison with those phenomena which the Society\nhas classified as spontaneous. That is what I had in view in my\ndistinction, and it holds good at least to the extent of showing that\nwe have a far more valuable set of phenomena in the Piper results\nthan can ever be obtained by recording casual and spontaneous\nexperiences. In every essential feature the Piper sittings are experi\n\fXLV.] Remarks <w Mr. Carrington's Paper. 363\nments of precisely the same sort as are the experiments with subjects\nin the work of experimental psychology.\nLet me also differ from Mr. Carrington regarding the cogency of\nMr. Lang's question as an argument against the statement of Sir Oliver\nLodge. You can answer Sir Oliver Lodge only by experimentally\nproving the kind of telepathy which he says, I think correctly, has\nnot been proved. Mr. Lang's sceptical question, implying that we\ncannot \"experiment consciously on the unconscious,\" is not in any\nrespect a proof that telepathy is subliminal. It would rather show\nthat it is both unproved and unprovable.\n(5) Section 6 maintains \" the possibility of unconscious telepathy.\"\nI do not dispute this. What I want to know is : \" Is it a fact ? \" not\n\" Is it possible'! \" What Sir Oliver Lodge maintained, and I agree with\nhim, is that this kind of telepathy has never been experimentally proved,\nand until it has been so proved, we are not obliged to consider it as a\nscientific hypothesis for either explanatory or controversial purposes.\nThe \"possibility\" of it may serve as an evidential limitation in the\nquestion of demonstration, but will not be a consideration in inductive\nproblems. The claim here by Mr. Carrington that \" the great majority\nof the bare facts in the sittings could have been obtained by the medium\nby means of telepathy from the subliminal consciousness of the sitter,\"\nis subject to limitation of what has just been said. If that kind of\ntelepathy is scientificially proved, I can agree ; but I deny that it has\nbeen scientifically proved. What people have been doing in this work\nis extending the meaning of telepathy without producing the facts that\nwould justify it. Not knowing its laws and conditions or limitations,\nwhen confronted with an apparent spiritistic phenomenon, we ask :\n\" But what if telepathy can obtain its data from the subliminal 1 \" Then\nby virtue of the right to ask the question on various occasions, we\npresently surreptitiously assume it to be a fad. Presto ! and the whole\nthing is done.\nIn his reference to the sittings held by Ur. Hodgson in my behalf,\nMr. Carrington neglects to note that many of the facts in those sittings\nwere quite as unknown to me as to Dr. Hodgson, and that we must\neither extend the telepathy to other minds to account for them or\nadvance the hypothesis of previous subliminal acquisition telepathically\nby myself. As Mr. Carrington treats of this latter theory further on, I\nshall omit consideration of it at present, and only call attention to\nthe misconception of the facts of the record.\n(6) In putting forward the dramatic play involved in the phenomena\nas apparently the first matter in favour of the spiritistic theory, Mr.\n\f364 Professor J. H. Hyslop. [PART\nCarrington reverses the order of cogency as stated by myself in my\nreport. I make that fact purely secondary, and perhaps Mr. Carrington\nwould do so if asked regarding it. But I call attention to the matter\nto emphasise the question of selectiveness in the phenomena as related\nto the problem of personal identity as the really strong point for the\nspiritistic theory first to be considered, and if telepathy cannot meet\nthat, it must take second place.\nThe \" difficulties \" which are mentioned as suggested by Mrs. Sidgwick\nin her discussion of Dr. Hodgson's report, I must dismiss, as they\ndo not seem to me of any scientific importance.\nMr. Carrington thinks that my suppositions to explain statements\nregarding material existence, etc., are purely arbitrary. Now I was\ncareful to show that in two respects my explanation of such phenomena\nsimply reproduced the admitted facts of present knowledge. I indicated\nas an ad hominem point that I had only to assume telepathy as the\nnormal mode of communication in a transcendental world, as it is\nassumed to be a sporadic occurrence in this, and second, that the\nprevailing idealism in philosophy would afford an analogy which\nprevented all assumption of the supernormal to account for the\noccurrence of such phenomena. Besides, Mr. Carrington neglects to\nobserve that it is not necessary for me to resort to these suppositions,\nas I said they were not proved, and that the essential feature of the\ntheory maintained was that the \"communicator\" is in a mental\ncondition at least somewhat like our secondary personality (pp. 284-5)\nwhile communicating. This again is a resort to present knowledge\nand conceptions to explain the occurrence of such messages as he thinks\noffensive to our ideas of what ought to occur. I cannot go into details\nof this feature of the theory, but it explains how amnesia of both\nthe normal life in the transcendental world and the past terrestrial\nlife might occur, and in every way disturb the apperceptive powers for\nrightly representing the conditions of spirit life. This enables the\nspiritistic theory to explain what the telepathic theory cannot pretend\nto explain, so that when you are reduced to a choice between them, the\nformer becomes preferable, whether proved or not.\nThe question of \" mistakes, confusion, and contradictions ' is too\nlarge to discuss in detail here. Each one of these would have to be\nconsidered by itself. But I may briefly indicate that contradictions,\nno matter how numerous, in regard to affairs on \" the other side,\" do\nnot in the least affect the spiritistic theory, but only the reliability\nof the controls for telling the facts about such a life. The spiritistic\nhypothesis rests wholly upon facts that we can verify on \" this side,\"\n\fXLV.] Remarks on Mr. Carringtmi's Paper. 365\nand that are unquestionably supernormal and inexplicable by telepathy.\nContradictions about things terrestrial are a positive objection to\ntelepathy, because after assuming the powers which must be attributed\nto it to explain away the spiritistic theory, there is no excuse for\ncontradiction. Besides, we have no right to suppose that discarnate\nspirits know anything more about \"this side\" than we know about\ntheirs. They may have as much difficulty in finding out facts here\nas we have in finding out about their affairs.\n(7) The objection based on what Mr. Carrington calls (in \u00a7 8) the\n\"evolution of Phinuit\" misconceives the whole problem, and shows\nvery clearly how assumptions made for evidential reasons become\nsupposed facts. After some animadversions on this point of\nPhinuit's nature, Mr. Carrington says : \" But the fact remains that\none of Mrs. Piper's first controls was no spirit at all, but merely\na secondary personality.\" Then he asks a question as to the\npossibility of distinguishing between him and the present controls.\nNow let me say in reply, first, that in my argument I assumed\nthat the Imperator group are also secondary personalities (pp. 153-\n4, 264, 265-6, and 292). But assuming this for evidential purposes\nis not admitting it to be a .\/\u2022\".\/. As personal identity was the\nstandard, I had to test these trance personalities by the same criterion\nas others, but their failure to indicate their identity is not proof that\nthey are Mrs. Piper's secondary personality, but merely a reason for\nsuspending judgment and conducting the argument on the concession\nthat they have not satisfied the conditions of evidence. The absence\nof proof for the presence of spirits is not proof for the absence of spirits,\nand yet the majority of writers and critics perpetually commit the error\nof making the assumption which this statement denies. Hence we\nmust not forget that the assumption for argumentative purposes that\nPhinuit was the secondary personality of Mrs. Piper is not equivalent\nto the denial that he was in reality a spirit. For all that we know, he\nwas that, but the evidence did not prove it. Phinuit and the Imperator\ngroup satisfy one term of the double standard which I mentioned near\nthe beginning of my remarks. They can be explained by the spiritistic\nhypothesis, but they do not conform to the evidential criterion. Hence\nargumentatively we must assume them to be what they may not be in\nfact, but we have uo right to convert a logical expedient into evidence\nthat they are not what they claim to be. In all this I wish merely to\nemphasise the truth\u2014so easily disregarded\u2014that failure to prove a\ncase is not evidence of the contrary view ; it simply leaves us in a\ncondition of agnosticism.\n\f366 Professor J. H. Hydnp. [PART\n(8) In section 10, Mr. Carrington misunderstands the purport of Mrs.\nSidgwick's statement that the \"evidence for direct communication . . .\nmay easily be overestimated.\" In this Mrs. Sidgwick is disputing Dr.\nHodgson's possession theory, which concerns the modus operandi of\ncommunication, and not the fact of it. Mrs. Sidgwick admits that\nthere is a considerable amount of evidence for spiritistic communication,\nwhich seems to imply an admission of the cogency of incidents for the\nspiritistic theory which Mr. Carrington here thinks are weakened by\nmy discussion. (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. xv. pp. 17-18.) But his miscon\nception of her statement makes its quotation irrelevant to the point\nwhich he wishes to make regarding an incident in my record connected\nwith the \" communications \" of my uncle. This was his failure to\nrecognize Dr. Hodgson, of which Mr. Carrington says I make so\nmuch.\nBut Mr. Carrington misses my point in saying that secondary\npersonality in hypnosis and other forms shows precisely this failure to\nrecognize certain persons present. This may all be very true. But\nI was using the failure to recognize Dr. Hodgson as a difficulty in the\ntelepathic hypothesis. I was certainly not dealing with secondary\npersonality alone in the Piper case, but with a telepathic agent by\nsupposition. On this assumption I ought to have gotten a knowledge\nof Dr. Hodgson's presence precisely as I did in the case of my father,\nwho had heard of Dr. Hodgson while living, but my uncle had not, as\nI had never talked with him about the subject. The curious feature\nof the Piper case is that the personalities who, when living, knew or\nhad heard of Dr. Hodgson, always or generally recognize him, while\nthose who never knew him do as my uncle did in this case. Why\nshould telepathy always duplicate the spiritistic phenomena ami nothing\nelse ? Besides, Mr. Carrington should note that Dr. Hodgson is\nconstantly recognized during the supposed secondary condition of Mrs.\nPiper, so that it is not consistent that my uncle should fail to do this,\nexcept on two assumptions : first, that I was dealing with a spirit, and,\nsecond, that the telepathic powers of Mrs. Piper are limited to the\nnature of the personality represented, or rather extended to the\ncoincidences between what is true of both the living and the dead and\napparently nothing else ! That was the point which I wished to make\nso as to show how complicated telepathy might be, or had to be, to\naccount for the delicate psychological distinctions which it draws,\na distinction which its experimental form seems never to recognize.\nThe \"multiplex personality,\" which must be assumed in this case,\nmust represent the multiplicity of the alleged \"communicators,\" aud\n\fXLV.] Remarks on Mr. Cwrrvngtom's Paper. 367\nyou would have to give some rational account of the consistency of the\nImperator group and their phenomena with the supposed elasticity and\ncleavage assumed by Mr. Carrington, as well as the strange tendency\nof the assumed personalities to coincide in their work with the demands\nof a spiritistic hypothesis, showing psychological powers and distinctions\nwhich now indicate no limitations, and now precisely those which we\nshould expect on the spiritistic theory.\n(9) In regard to the combination of telepathy and secondary per\nsonality in the Piper case, Mr. Carrington must not ignore the fact that\nI called attention to this possibility and remarked that, as the non-\nevidential matter might all be referable to secondary personality, the\nwhole issue turned on the question whether telepathy could adequately\naccount for the acquisition of the supernormal facts. Having claimed\nthat telepathy could not rationally account for this acquisition, so far\nas present evidence is concerned, and as the various controls can be\nexplained by the spiritistic hypothesis, it was not only consistent but\nnecessary to accept the hypothesis which was most consistent with all\nthe facts, and so treat it as preferable, that is, as a working hypothesis.\nIf you suppose that telepathy is all that Mr. Carrington assumes it to\nbe, then the case may be as strong against the spiritistic theory as he\nsupposes. But he should have remarked that my whole argument\nthrew upon him and similar critics the burden of proving the kind of\ntelepathy which he assumes, and which I do not admit for one moment\nas either proved or as having the respectability of a working\nhypothesis.\n(10) What Mr. Carrington says in section 14 of a \" telepathically\ninitiated secondary personality,\" is practically answered by my last\nremarks above. When such a thing gets inductive or other evidence\nin its support, I can reckon with it, but I am not, in an inductive\nproblem, under any obligations to refute mere possibilities. I simply\ndemand of every assumed possibility that it present evidence of its\nbeing a fact, just as Mr. Carrington demands of the spiritistic theory,\nnot that it be possible\u2014for this he apparently grants\u2014but that it\nhave evidence.\nOf course, Mr. Carrington is only stating in this way what is really\ninvolved in the usual telepathic theory, so that, apart from the language,\nwe have only the old hypothesis to consider, and this is subject to the\ncriticism that the sitter cannot telepathically produce real personalities of\nwhich it knows nothing, except we suppose that there is no personality\nwhich he does not know, at least subliminally, all having been acquired\nin the manner discussed in later sections. But, apart from this\n\f368 Professor J. H. Syslop. [PART\nsupposition, the limitation of telepathically initiated secondary per\nsonalities is found in facts not known by the sitter as we have been\naccustomed to define \" knowledge.\" Mr. Carrington must produce\nthe evidence that such assumptions are justifiable, not assert their\npossibility, as we are not dealing in this problem with mere possibilities\nbut evidentially supported hypotheses.\n(11) In section 15, Mr. Carrington speaks of \"difficulties of the\ntelepathic hypothesis simplified,\" and then proceeds to maintain that\nthe sitter may have telepathically acquired at some time the facts that\nare supposed to be entirely \" unknown.\" It is amazing to see this\ncalled \" simplifying the telepathic theory ! \" I have a very simple reply\nto this contention. It is, Give us the evidence that any such thing\nis a fact. I am not going to say that it is impossible. For all that\nI know, this and many other things are quite possible. One other\nwriter says that \" the ether fairly teems with the vibrating thoughts\nof the bygone ages, and all (sic) that is necessary to become possessed\nof this store of universal knowledge is to become sensitive to ether\nvibrations and learn how to translate them into ordinary language.\"\nVery possibly, so far as I know. But you would think that a man who\ndoes not stumble at the acceptance of such a stupendous claim as this\nwithout an iota of evidence, would not get excited about spirits which\nclaim to have some evidence in their support. Now Mr. Carrington\nseems to imitate this man and does not produce any evidence that\nthe sitter is possessed of such subliminally acquired knowledge by\nmeans of telepathy, and until he does, a scientific man is under no\nobligation to discuss it in an inductive problem. Only when it\ngives some evidence of being a fact in non-spiritistic data can we\ndiscuss it as an objection to the spiritistic theory. Besides, it is\ncertainly strange that Mr. Carrington should demur to the accept\nance of the spiritistic theory on the evidence of \"one case\" when\nhe is willing to tolerate a far more stupendous theory without\nevidence of any sort. The Piper case may not be enough to prove\nthe spiritistic theory, but it has to be explained by some theory,\nand as the spiritistic hypothesis seems to have in it both the requisite\nexplanatory and evidential credentials, it is certainly legitimate to treat\nit as a working hypothesis, and exact of every other competing doctrine\nthe satisfaction of the same demands. I must contend, on the very\nnature of telepathy as a supposition, as well as the contradiction\nbetween the magnitude and the necessary limitations of his theory as\napplied to the facts, that it does not explain anything, and Mr.\nCarrington has given no evidence that his conception of it is a fact\n\fXLV.] Remarks on Mr. Carrington's Paper. .369\nin any case, so that neither credential of a legitimate scientific hypo\nthesis is embodied in his supposition.\nIn this theory Mr. Carrington has certainly followed the injunction\nwhich he imposes upon sceptics in section 13, namely, that \"we must\ninvent some hypothesis which will account for a greater proportion of\nthe facts than any hitherto advanced.\" Now what I dispute is the\nright to \" invent \" any hypothesis whatever. Newton was very careful\nto say in regard to gravitation \" hypotheses non Jingo,\" by which he\nmeant that he limited his suppositions to known principles, and simply\nextended their operation with evidence. If we are to be allowed to\n\"invent\" hypotheses ad libitum without responsibility to evidential\nconsiderations, I think I could produce several theories to rival the\nspiritistic, some very simple and some very large. I have never\nunderstood scientific method to permit this, and hence I simply ask\nof every theory presented that it present the two fundamental creden\ntials of every legitimate hypothesis, namely, explanatory and evidential\ncapacity, and perhaps I should add, as an important corollary, applica\nbility to details. Mr. Carrington has not supplied any of these con\nditions in his proposal. To support it, he should present something\nlike the experimental data which the Society's Proceedings record in\nfavour of telepathy, as limited to the present active states of conscious\nness, and in favour of the spiritistic theory. There is not the slightest\nattempt to do this, and until it is done, I am not called upon ta\nscientifically consider such statements as this : \" I should suggest that\nmany, perhaps all, of the thoughts in the minds of those about us are\nconstantly being ' telepathed ' as it were to the brains of others,\" except\nto say that they are assertion, not evidence.\n(12) In Mr. Carrington's remarks on what we should expect from\nhis hypothesis in the way of mistakes and confusion, he actually departs\nfrom the very principle with which he starts out in the discussion.\nThis was to accept the less stupendous theory. I shall not question\nthe liability to mistakes in the selection from so large a mass of\nexperience, including both supraliminal and subliminal knowledge,\nexcept that if telepathy is half as large as Mr. Carrington and others\nsuppose, it ought not to make any such mistakes as are actually\ncommitted. But if we can explain such mistakes by the normal laws\nof consciousness, we do not have to resort to the supernormal at all.\nMr. Carrington takes an unverified hypothesis, and then to get out of a\ndifficulty which it presents, \" invents \" a weakness in it to simulate it\nto the finite which is not in the original supposition. In the application\nof the spiritistic hypothesis, I had proceeded upon the implications of\n\f370 Profexsor J. H. Hy\u00ablop. [PART\npersonal identity, and assumed what must be true on that idea, namely,\nthat the subject, the discarnate soul, would show the strength and\nweakness of consciousness as we know it, and so I explained the\nmistakes and confusions by the various incidents of normal and abnor\nmal memory. That is, some mistakes can be explained by the ordinary\nlapse of memory, others by the amnesia produced by the condition of\nsecondary personality in which the discarnate spirit is supposed, on the\ninternal evidence of the record, to be. I thus resort to the known to\nexplain my case, and Mr. Carrington resorts to the unknown for his\nexplanation both in the conception of the hypothesis at large and in\nthe adjunct expressing its limitation. Besides, Mr. Carrington has\nstated as an objection to his theory a range of selectiveness that it must\nimply, which I think every scientific man would regard as fatal to it\nuntil experimentally proved, and this evidence is not here offered.\n(13) The Ptolemaic character of Mr. Carrington's theory is shown in\nthe \" cycles and epicycles \" which he has to contrive to make it work.\nHe finds that it implies subliminal acquisition from every living person,\nand then, to account for the selectiveness of Mrs. Piper's subliminal, he\nsupposes that the thoughts of friends and relatives have a specially\nconstituted nature to be impressed or selected which others do not\nhave. Where is the evidence of such an assumption ? Of course, it is\nthe interesting fact that, generally at least, the \"communications\"\npurport to come from friends, and that spontaneous coincidences are\nusually connected with friends. But Mr. Carrington forgets first that\nit is only from friends that you can ever discover evidential instances of\nspontaneous coincidence, and that it is only incidents about friends that\nyou can hope to have any chance to verify as a rule. For all that we\nknow, especially if Mr. Carrington's hypothesis be true, there is\nplenty of telepathic communication between living people, but as no\ncommunication of the ordinary sort takes place between them, there\nis no evidence of the telepathic impression. It is not necessarily the\nmental attitude of our friends that causes the telepathy between us, but\nit is the accidental circumstance that we can converse or exchange letters\nthat proves it, and we must not mistake the evidence of a fact for its\ncause. The only resource for Mr. Carrington is to increase the selective\ncapacity of Mrs. Piper's telepathic action, and so make it so intelligent\nand acute that he cannot escape the supposition that it is perfectly\ndevilish. This is what I had in mind when laying so much stress on\nthe incident in which my uncle failed to recognize Dr. Hodgson. I was\nindicating that telepathy as a mechanical process ought not to coincide\nwith what we should expect on the spiritistic theory without supposing\n\fXLV.] Remarks an Mr. Carrington s Paper. 371\nthat it was sufficiently intelligent and self-conscious to know what it\nwas doing, and if it knows this, it knows that its own work is not\nspiritistic, and we have to add the devil to it to make the phenomena\nintelligible. That it is devilish may be the correct interpretion, and\nI shall not claim to possess data for refuting this view ; but I shall\ninsist on the telepathist recognizing frankly the implications and\nconsequences of his theory.\nMoreover, the fact of friendship is not an intelligible reason for\nsupposing that telepathy is primarily affected by it. It may be that\nit is as imagined, but to justify the supposition, we must have very\nmuch more evidence than the coincidental circumstance that our\ncollected data represent experiences between friends. Let me say right\nhere that I can give a very simple explanation of all such coincidences\non the spiritistic theory, but I have always refused to tolerate it even\nfor myself because it lacks the requisite evidential features. But there\nis nothing in friendship, so far as it is psychologically known, to suggest\nthat telepathic action especially depends on it, and until some reason\ncan be found, in the very nature of it as a phenomenon, to create this\nexpectation, we must treat the coincidence between it and telepathy\nas insufficiently understood to assume any general law based on it.\nBesides, granting it, how would Mr. Carrington explain the constancy\nof Mrs. Piper's supposed telepathy in the selection of memories related\nto deceased persons and not related to the living, without also supposing\na most fiendish intelligence in the selection ? Surely the fact that\na friend has died can hardly so alter the nature of my memories\nregarding him as to distinguish them radically from the memories about\nliving friends. Hence, if telepathy is not intelligently selective, I\nought to get a constant confusion of incidents between the living and\nthe dead, which as a fact I do not get, as the records show. Again,\nI say you must add the devil to your hypothesis to make it work, and\nif this is so, let us admit it, and recognize a part of our hypothesis is a\nfiendish capacity of the subliminal to know just what it is about and\nto simulate the spiritistic exactly.\n(14) I am aware that Mr. Carrington regards his hypothesis as merely\ntentative, but what I am maintaining is that we are not entitled to\n\"invent\" even tentative hypotheses, unless they actually explain and can\npresent in their favour an adequate body of empirical evidence. The\ncontention that the possibility of such a theory renders the spiritistic\ntheory gratuitous is not relevant, because after admitting that the\nspiritistic theory actually explains and has at least some evidence\nin its support, it is clear that his own theory is quite as gratuitous\n\f372 Professor J. H. Hyslap. [PART\nas the one he wishes to set aside, and the attempt to \"invent\"\nit only reveals a more or less conscious or unconscious motive in the\nrespectability of scepticism for evading the issue. If gratuitousness is\nan objection to a theory, and I admit that it is, I must say that every\ntheory not supported by adequate experimental evidence is gratuitous\nand so objectionable. \"Inventing\" hypotheses simply to get rid of\na perfectly plain and reasonable supposition which accords with the\nknown both in its simplicity and complexity simply reveals, in the last\nanalysis, a disposition to make our ignorant neighbours' opinions of our\nsanity the standard of truth and scientific method. We need some\nsense of humour in this matter. I cannot see that the gravity with\nwhich we can propose or receive the most stupendous miracle in favour\nof scepticism and incredulity in any way proves that we are scientific.\nWhat we must realize in discussing the spiritistic theory is that it is\nnot our business to \" invent \" hypotheses to prove it gratuitous, but to\nshow that it does not explain and that the evidential conditions are not\nsatisfied. To resort to the contrivance of a priori hypotheses, however\nvaluable as indications that the conclusion has not been demonstrated,\nis simply a tacit admission that scientifically and inductively the case is\nagainst you. All that the spiritistic theory claims is that it conforms\nto the canons of induction, not that it is secure against the fertility of\nhuman imagination. It may be false, but it is scientific. So far as we\nare concerned, scientific method may not be the criterion of truth, but as\nlong as that is the accepted standard, and I accept it, we have only to\nconform to it to throw upon adherents of that method the responsibility\nfor accepting or rejecting hypotheses which satisfy their own conditions.\nOn the other hand, if imagination and \" invention \" are to be our\ncriteria, I think the admission would be very cordial that spiritism\nwould obtain credibility on quite easy terms.\n(15) Mr. Carrington has apparently taken no account of the funda\nmental feature of the theory that he is criticising, namely, that the\ncommunicator is not in a normal mental condition while communicating.\nThat conception is the clue to many of the \"difficulties and objections\"\nwhich so naturally present themselves against the spiritistic theory. A\nrecognition of this assumption, as based on (a) the internal evidence of\nthe messages, (6) the statements of the communicators, and (c) its con\nformity to what we know in pathology, would suggest a unity in the\nwhole that brings it into an intelligible form. All criticism which\nneglects this part of the theory as defended simply evades the issue.\nThere is no reason to suppose, from any conception of telepathy as it\nis experimentally known, that it should reproduce the characteristics of\n\fXLV.] Remarks on Mr. Carringtoris Paper. 373\nan abnormal mental condition on the \" other side,\" which we can easily\nunderstand in terms of the various phenomena of secondary personality.\nThe theory as I have presented it in my report is not grappled with at\nall until this feature of it is adequately noticed.

[PART\nON PROFESSOR HYSLOP'S REPORT ON HIS SITTINGS\nWITH MRS. PIPER.\nBy FRANK PODMORE.\nTHAT no detailed criticism of Professor Hyslop's report on his series\nof sittings with Mrs. Piper has yet appeared, is due no doubt to the\nextremely voluminous nature of the report itself and its accompanying\nappendices. Certainly the mere bulk of the work is sufficient to repel\nmost critics. Not lightly may one essay to controvert conclusions\nwhich are supported by some 650 pages of argument and evidence. To\nmy thinking, however, Professor Hyslop is justified in the appeal\nwhich he makes for a patient and detailed study of records that\ninvolve, even remotely, issues so momentous :\u2014\nIt seems to me impossible to obtain a proper conception of the issues\ninvolved without a most painstaking study of ... detailed records. On\nthis point I make no concessions to the popular demand for a merely readable\nstory, but expect from those who claim to be intelligent a minute and\npatient study of the phenomena, such as we demand in all scientific and\nphilosophic problems (Report, p. 18).\nAfter such study as I have been able to give to the matter, I find\nthat I differ from Professor Hyslop's views almost as widely as it is\npossible for one honest and unprejudiced investigator to differ from\nanother in the interpretation of the same subject-matter. But I\ngladly pay my tribute at the outset to his notable industry, patience,\ningenuity, and, above all, his serious and whole-hearted appreciation\nof the importance of his task. But my own credentials will no doubt\nbe called in question, and, indeed, before setting out to explain why\nmy conclusions on the evidence before us differ from Professor Hyslop's,\nI should like to defend my claim to be considered an unprejudiced\nwitness. Prior to the publication, in 1898, of Dr. Hodgson's monu\nmental report on Mrs. Piper's later trances (Proceedings, Vol. xni.),\nI had held that her utterances were amongst the strongest evidences\n\fXLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 375\nwhich we possessed for telepathy, or at least for some supernormal\nfaculty of acquiring information outside the possible radius of the\nsenses ; on the other hand, it seemed to me that the indications of\nthe action of discarnate spirits were so slight and shadowy as to be\nhardly worth taking into account. After some conversations with\nDr. Hodgson during his visit to this country in 1897, and careful\nstudy of the Report issued shortly afterwards, I inclined to the opinion\nthat the case for spirit intercourse was at any rate strong enough to\nbe accepted as a provisional hypothesis. That in the course of the\nfour or five years which have intervened my views have gravitated\nback to the standpoint which I held before 1898, is due partly to\nrecent study of the history of spiritualism, and partly to the perusal\nof Professor Hyslop's report. The effect of that report on my mind\nhas been not merely to discredit altogether the spirit hypothesis\nso far as this particular series of seances is concerned, but retro\nspectively to cast some shadow of doubt on the results previously\nrecorded by Dr. Hodgson.\nThus much in defence of my claim to be heard as an unprejudiced\ncritic. Now to the argument. Professor Hyslop asserts that the issue\npresented by these records \" is simply whether spiritism, or telepathy\nfrom living persons exclusively, is the more rational hypothesis to\naccount for the facts \" (p. 5), and as between these two he gives his vote\ndecidedly in favour of the former. Whether his preference, as between\nthese two hypotheses, is justified or not, I have not needed to inquire.\nThe offer of a choice between these alternatives implies the exclusion\nof other explanations. To one such possible explanation Professor\nHyslop does briefly define his attitude\u2014fraud is, he thinks, excluded\nby the past history of Mrs. Piper's mediumship. Now, certainly, in the\nprevious seances recorded in Dr. Hodgson's reports, fraud in the only\nform not hopelessly inadequate\u2014the acquisition of knowledge by\nprivate detectives\u2014seems excluded by the conditions of the case. But\nDr. Hodgson's case for the exclusion of fraud was founded mainly on\nthe records of first seances, held with persons whose names were\nentirely unknown to Mrs. Piper. Obviously, if Mrs. Piper maintained\nhowever so well equipped a detective agency, she would find little\nopportunity to make use of her information until she knew at least the\nnames of her sitters. Now the first seances on which Dr. Hodgson\nrelied were in most cases strikingly successful. But the first seance in\nProfessor Hyslop's series, according to his own original estimate of it, is\n\" absolutely worthless \" as evidence (p. 20). It is true that, in accord\nance with his mental habit, he modifies this estimate on further reflec\n\f376 Frank Podmore. [PART\ntion, and is now of opinion that \"it could be made quite intelligible,\nif not slightly evidential, by disentangling its threads of suggestive\npossibilities.\" But his original judgment remains on record, and I doubt\nif many readers will be inclined to dispute it. The first seance, then,\nin the series may be called a failure. But clearly, without imputing\ndeliberate fraud of a kind of which Mrs. Piper's past history affords no\nindication, at each seance after the first it became more and more\nlikely that the true statements may have been founded on knowledge\nnormally acquired by the medium, either in her waking state from\nthings heard and read, or in the trance by inference from things let drop\nby the sitter, or generally from his acceptance or rejection of previous\nutterances ; and these normal channels of information were possibly\nwide enough to have conveyed everything in the later seances whicb\nwas true and relevant. Now, to this question Professor Hyslop has not\naddressed himself at all. He contents himself with refusing to discuss\nthe possibility of fraud, in what he considers the only form conceiv\nable in the case, that is, the employment of detectives for obtaining\ninformation (p. 6), on the ground that that hypothesis was excluded\nten years ago (p. 5). But in connection with the strikingly successful\ngroups, mostly of first seances, recorded by Dr. Hodgson and others in\nprevious reports, there was no need to insist upon the possible operation\nof such familiar causes as chance-coincidence, fishing, inference from\nhints let drop at the sitting, or the reproduction of information casually\nacquired by the medium before the seance, because the facts stated at\nthese seances were often so detailed and accurate as to make the mere\nsuggestion of such an explanation ridiculous. The question of deli\nberate and systematic fraud was discussed and rejected, not merely as\nbeing inadequate to the results, but as being, with anonymous sitters,\npractically impossible. In considering the present records, however, in\nwhich the first seance was a failure, and the chief successes were scored\ntowards the end of a series which extended over many months, when\nthe sitter had long ceased to be anonymous, we may perhaps exclude\nfraud, but we are not equally entitled to exclude chance-coincidence,\nskilful inference, and the reproduction of information casually acquired.\nProfessor Hyslop says indeed (p. 11) that he was careful to avoid\ngiving suggestions, either muscular or by his questions. But it\nappears from the record that he generally let the medium know\nwhether her statements were right or wrong, so that she might have\nbeen enabled gradually to correct them, which she seems to have\ndone.\nIn considering generally from the evidential standpoint the utter\n\fXLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 377\nances at Mrs. Piper's later seances, it is to be noted first, that the\nmachinery of the trance communication is by no means simple, or even\nintelligible, except with expert interpretation. Mrs. Piper is entranced,\nand apparently unconscious of what goes on. The messages given are\nwritten through her hand. The intelligence which inspires those\nmessages, whatever its precise nature, is certainly complex, and of an\nunusual if not unique kind. The view of the process of communication\nprovisionally adopted by Dr. Hodgson and Professor Hyslop is that\nMrs. Piper's organism is made use of by the spirits of certain deceased\npersons for the purpose of communicating with their friends who are\nstill living here. But for the most part that communication is supposed\nto take place in an indirect way. Professor Hyslop's father does\nnot, ex hypothesi, himself control the bodily movements of Mrs. Piper.\nThat function is too delicate and uncertain to be entrusted to any but\nan expert spirit. Professor Hyslop's father, uncle, brother, or other\ncommunicating spirit, dictates, therefore, what he wishes said to one of\nthe customary controls, usually \"Rector\" or \"G. P.,\" who in turn\ntranslates the messages somehow into terms of Mrs. Piper's muscular\nactivity. But occasionally the ordinary process is interrupted by the\nintrusion of alien spirits, who either succeed temporarily in obtaining\npossession of Mrs. Piper's organism or divert the attention of the\ncontrolling spirit. Once more, the supposed orderly process may be\ninterrupted by \"automatisms\"\u2014vague, meaningless remarks thrown\nout by the communicating spirit (or by Mrs. Piper's own subliminal\nconsciousness). Thus on p. 332 occurs the remark, \"Do you hear\nher sing 1 \" This remark is not, to the uninstructed reader, more out\nof place than many other remarks interjected in the course of the trance-\nwritings. But it is not recognised by Professor Hyslop as relevant,\nand is dismissed as \" one of the automatisms which are quite frequent\nin these sittings\" (p. 352, note). Now, cumbrous and far-fetched\nthough this hypothesis of communication at two removes may appear,\nthere can be little doubt that it has a very direct relation to the\nobserved phenomena, so direct that we are practically confined to the\nchoice of one out of two alternatives\u2014the hypothesis either accurately\nrepresents the facts, or is itself responsible for the appearances which\nsuggest those facts. If Mrs. Piper's organism is not controlled by\nspirits in the manner supposed, we are forced to conclude that her\ntrance utterances have been moulded to their present form so as to\naccord with a theory gradually elaborated by Dr. Hodgson and his\nfellow-workers.\nThe practical result of this complicated mechanism is that the\n\f378 Frank Podmore. [PART\nmessages delivered through the entranced Mrs. Piper are extraordi\nnarily ambiguous and uncertain in their interpretation. To begin with\nthe simplest difficulty, the actual script is extremely indistinct, and can\napparently only be read, if read at all, by those who, like Dr. Hodgson\nhimself, have had long practice in deciphering it. In some instances\nquoted in the reports it seems to have baffled even Dr. Hodgson.\nThe ambiguity of the writing may sometimes have given openings bv\nwhich the trance intelligence could gain information. Consider, for\ninstance, this passage :\n\" I am with her (with whom ?). Yes, I have A A [undec.,\npossibly either Alice or Annie]. (Is it Alice?) Alice (Alice who?) \/ da\nnot say Alice, I say Annie\" (p. 307).\nThis is quite in Phinuit's old style. Again, in one place the word\n\" mother \" is printed five times, but \" a close re-examination of the\noriginal automatic writing indicates that the first of these words looks\nlike 'mother.' The others look like 'brother'\" (p. 316). On another\noccasion the sitter asks, \" Who passed out soon after you ? \" The\nanswer given is \"mother [? brother] is here also\" (p. 331). In some\ncases the indistinctness of the writing may even have led to uncon\nscious perversion of the record. In one case, e.g., the sitter asks for\nthe name of a younger brother to be given. The writing proceeds :\n\"Cannot hear you. Do not hurry so. Do you mean F f\n(Sitter: 'Yes, father, I mean F., if you can tell the rest.') 'Yes,\nI can remember very well, FRAD (?).'\" Professor Hyslop then\nexplains that the symbol printed as D was really very like NK,\nand that Frank was the brother's name (pp. 337-8). One cannot\nhelp wondering whether, if the brother's uame had happened to be\nFred, the resemblance of the last character to NK would have\nseemed to Professor Hyslop quite so conspicuous.\nBut, after all, the writing is the least of the difficulties in the\ninterpretation of these communications. The really serious obstacle\nlies in the nature of the communications themselves. There is a\nlarge amount of what, for our present purposes, we must dismiss as\nmere padding. The controlling spirits are voluble in protesting that\nthey will do their best ; asking the sitter to have patience ; complain\ning of the conditions, and so on. This part of the communications\nis coherent enough, but not evidential. The messages of deceased\nrelatives are for the most part fragmentary and incoherent. They\nare also indirect, tentative, and ambiguous in form. Last of all, they\nfrequently, perhaps generally in the earlier sittings, contain no indica\ntion of the identity of the supposed communicator. That identity\n\fXLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 379\nhas to be inferred from internal evidence. In other words, the message\nis assigned to the relative to whom it would be most appropriate.\nThus, to take one case out of many, Professor Hyslop explains that at\na certain part of the first sitting he originally supposed himself to be\ncommunicating with his brother, but later saw reason, purely from\ninternal evidence, to suppose that his father, not his brother, was the\ncommunicator (pp. 22. 307, and 361). In other words, the messages\nfor the most part bear no label of origin ; in some cases they bear no\nlabel of destination either. Names are thrown out haphazard, to be\ntaken up and identified or left, as the sitter wills. Thus, to take a\nsalient case, at the second sitting the \" control \" announces that there is\na little girl-spirit trying to find her mother. He then proceeds :\n\" Who is Ruth 1\n(Hyslop : I do not know Ruth.)\nNot to thee, friend, but to thee [i.e. it refers to R.H.]\" (p. 319).\nIf we were dealing with the ordinary professional clairvoyant, who\ndescribes, before a roomful of her clients, the apparition of a sweet-\nfaced widow lady, or an old gentleman with silver hair, or some other\ntypical figure, we should say that the conditions were cunningly\ndevised to ensure that her clairvoyant descriptions should never fail to\nfind a billet somewhere. In reality, ambiguous messages of the kind\noften dealt in by Mrs. Piper, bearing marks neither of origin nor of\ndestination, widen the scope of chance-coincidence in much the same\nway, though no doubt to a less extent. Obviously the cap is more\nlikely to be found to fit if it is not aimed at one particular head.\nThe evidential value of fragmentary, incoherent, and indirect state\nments of the kind here dealt in by the trance-intelligence is extremely\ndifficult to estimate. Taken as they stand, many of them are meaning\nless. To have any meaning, they require to be filled in or inter\npreted. It is, of course, in the process of filling in or interpretation\nthat the real danger lies. The material is so vague that several inter\npretations would often fit about equally well, and the interpreter\nis tempted to choose that meaning which best accords with his wishes\nor his preconceptions.\nBut to come to particulars. It would obviously be impracticable,\nwithin reasonable limits of space, to analyse the evidence presented by\nthe whole series of sittings. Nor is any such complete analysis\nnecessary. As already pointed out, the information given at a pro\nlonged series of sittings is of course less and less valuable as evidence\nfor supernormal activity (spirits, telepathy, or anything else) the later\nit comes in the series. At each sitting the medium starts with a\n\f380 Frank Podmore. [PART\nlarger stock of information, normally acquired, than at the sitting\nwhich went before. Moreover, as the sittings proceed, the medium\nobviously has more and more opportunities of acquiring information\nfrom outside sources. I do not suggest that the medium, in the present\ncase, made any illegitimate use of any outside source of information which\nmay have been accessible to her; but clearly that possibility is not\none which we can altogether exclude. For this reason I should have\npreferred to begin my analysis of Professor Hyslop's records with the\nfirst sitting. But as the first seance was at the best inferior to the\nothers, in order not to treat the case unfairly I have chosen the second\nseance for detailed analysis.i As the first seance, however, is evi\ndentially the critical one, I have thought it well to give a brief\nsummary of its results, which does not greatly differ from Professor\nHyslop's own statistical summary in the table printed on p. 118 of his\nReport.\nAfter the preliminary conversation with the controlling spirits, there\nenter at the first sitting a lady with gloves and a little girl, who do\nnot give their names and who fail to obtain recognition. Thereafter,\nin the course of the sitting, seventeen names are introduced spon\ntaneously by the trance-intelligence. Of these, five\u2014Margaret, Annie,\nCharles, Willie, and Elizabeth\u2014are correct; but it should be added\nthat the lady introduced as Elizabeth was known in life as Eliza. Of\nthe remaining names 11 are incorrect, viz., Lillie, Alice, Henry, Albert,\nAlfred, Mr. Morse, Walter, Edwards, Ell-el, Robertson, Corrie. But\n\" Lillie,\" we are told, would have been correct and pertinent if it had\nbeen Sarah Luella ; \" Ell-el \" might be an attempt at Eliza ; \" Robert\nson \" would have a meaning if it were Robert's son ; and \" Corrie \"\nmight have been intended for Mary or for Cornelia. Finally, there is\na name not deciphered, but probably intended for Ellen or Allen. On\nthis Professor Hyslop comments, \"Allan (sic) could have one possible\nmeaning, and Ellen two.\"\nThe amount of coincidence here is clearly not more than chance\nwould afford. In fact, the trance-intelligence may be accounted\ndistinctly unlucky in scoring only 5 successes in 16 trials with quit*\ncommonplace names. Probably in most English families, at any rate,\nthe number of hits would have been greater.\nThe second sitting was, according to the statistical summary, one of\nthe most uniformly successful of the whole series. There are,\naccording to Professor Hyslop, 12 \"incidents,\" resoluble into 49\ni See Professor Hyslop's remarks on the first seance (Report, pp. 20 and 21)\nand his statistical summary, on p. 118, of the statements contained in it.\n\fXLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 381\n\"factors,\" of which 45 are true, 3 indeterminate, and one false.\nClearly, therefore, we shall do no injustice to the record if, having\nperforce to content ourselves with analysing a sample, we choose the\nsecond seance for the purpose.\nNow there is one, and, so far as I can find, only one definite true\nstatement made at this seance. The full name of the sitter\u2014James\nHyslop\u2014is given. Even that information is given piecemeal\u2014the\n\" James \" at the beginning, the \" Hyslop \" at the end of the sitting\u2014\na procedure which, if fraud were in question, would certainly seem\nsuspicious.\nIf the sitter's name had been given at the first seance, when the\nprecautions taken against the discovery of his identity seem to have\nbeen pretty complete, it would have been a valuable piece of evidence.\nComing, in this piecemeal fashion, 24 hours later, when the medium\nhad had the opportunity of passing in review the events of the first\nsitting, and the names of likely sitters, we cannot assign so much\nweight to it. Professor Hyslop's general interest in the subject was\nknown, since he had lectured on psychical research even in his\nfather's lifetime. And to Miss Edmunds, at any rate, it appeared\nprobable that he was one of the persons who would apply to\nhave sittings with Mrs. Piper (see p. 345). In the circumstances\nthe name \" James \" may have been a \" try-on,\" the favourable\nreception of which would justify the confident ejaculation of\n\" Hyslop \" at the end of the sitting. Excluding \" Ruth,\" of which\nwe have already spoken, four other names were correctly given at\nthis seance\u2014George, Charles, Willie, and Eliza (Elizabeth). All these\nhad been introduced at the previous seance, the first-named by Professor\nHyslop himself. Moreover, the relationship (brother) of George and\nCharles had also been indicated at the preceding seance ; and the rela\ntionship of Willie and Eliza is not precisely indicated in the second\nseance. Three names are incorrectly introduced \u2014 \" Robertson,\"\n'\u2022 Elsie \" (which is promptly changed, after repudiation by the sitter,\nto Eliza), and \"Uncle Charles.\" The sitter remarks that he does not\nknow any Uncle Charles. The trance-intelligence replies : \" I think\nis not a real uncle ; you must remember what I mean.\" Professor\nHyslop's comment is : \" With the resemblance of the word Charles\n(slight resemblance only, and noticeable only to those familiar with\nthese sittings) to this uncle's name, and the fact that he was not a real\nuncle, the incident has a perfectly definite meaning\" (p. 316). He was\napparently an uncle by marriage, and his name, as we learn later, was\nJames B. Carruthers.\n\f382 Frank Pod-more. [PART\nThere is one other quite definite statement made at the sitting.\nProfessor Hyslop's father was, he says, \"the last to come here.\" This\nis claimed as correct, and it is correct if understood to apply only to\nthe immediate family. It is not even true of blood-relations, for\nProfessor Hyslop's cousin, Kobert H. M'Clellan, had died since (p. 17).\nStill less is it true of the communicators in general, for the uncle by\nmarriage, who is supposed to be communicating through a considerable\npart of this same seance, had also died after Mr. Hyslop, senior.\nSupposing that the form of the sentence had been modified, and Mr.\nHyslop's spirit had said that he was the last but one to come here, or\neven the last but two, would Professor Hyslop have written down either\nof these statements as false ?\nIf we turn to the substance of the communications, we shall find\nthem much more coherent than in the previous sitting, but on the\nother hand there are fewer definite statements. The intelligence\ncommunicating is much freer, and seems more sure of the ground, but\ncontrives to utter very little beyond the commonplace or the readily\nconjecturable.\nI will briefly summarise the various points, omitting the purely\ngeneral topics, such as the difficulties of communicating, the pleasure\nof meeting the sitter again, the grief of those left behind, etc., matters\nwhich make up a large part of the communication :\n(A) After the introduction of the two names, \"James\" and\n\"Willie,\" comes the advice, \"Do not work too hard.\" This com\nmunication is interpreted as coming from the sitter's father.\n(B) A few lines introducing Brother Charles, and interpreted as\ncoming from him.\n(C) A passage with the advice : \" Don't worry ; \" a reference to\n\" trouble in your (sitter's) head,\" which Professor Hyslop cannot\ndistinctly remember. The passage concludes with the words, \" Tired\nout.\"\nIn the detailed notes (p. 314) the passage is interpreted as coming\nfrom the father. But in the report (p. 28) it is apparently assigned\nto the uncle.\n(D) \"E\u2014Elsie, El\u2014Elsie\" is written. Sitter repudiates the\nname Elsie, and it is immediately changed to Eliza. Then follows\ngeneral talk about the loneliness and grief of Eliza, after the sitter had\nintimated by his question that Eliza was still living.\nThis passage is referred to the sitter's uncle, James Carruthers.\n(E) A reference to \"Uncle Charles,\" with the explanation, added\nafter repudiation by sitter of the suggested relationship : \" Not a real\n\fXLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 383\nuncle ; \" a statement that he (or the sitter) \" used to be so nervous ; \"\na message to \" the girls ; \" a question, \" Have you seen the children\nyet ; \" a reference to George, and then : \" Are you troubled about\nhim ? He is all right and will be, James.\" Then the advice : \" Worry\nnot ; \" and the recognition of the accordion, which had been brought to\nthe seance, with other things belonging to the late Mr. Hyslop, in\naccordance with the usual practice at these seances of bringing objects\nfamiliar to the deceased person who is supposed to communicate.\nThis passage is interpreted as coming from the father.\n(F) Another reference to \"Eliza,\" and a decided change in the\nattitude of the communicating intelligence, possibly inspired by the\nsitter, who on the introduction of the name Eliza remarks : \" Tell us\nwho are with you, and that will help Eliza.\"\nThe passage is referred to the uncle.\n(G) A reference to the sitter's lectures, and to his scepticism about a\nfuture life.\nEeferred to the father.\n(H) The Ruth episode.\n(I) Sitter's father states he was \"the last to come here.\" More\nreference to sitter's difficulties and scepticism.\n(K) Sitting ends with Mrs. Piper's ejaculation of the sitter's surname\n\u2014Hyslop.\nIt will be seen from this bald summary\u2014the accuracy of which can\nbe tested by reference to the full report of the sitting\u2014that, if we\nomit the reference to the trouble with George, there is nothing in the\nstatements made to call even for the exercise of telepathy. There is\ncertainly a shrewd appreciation of Professor Hyslop's own character,\nand of the relations subsisting between him and his father ; in short, a\ndramatic realisation of the situation generally. But a person of\nsomewhat more than the ordinary acuteness and sympathetic insight\ninto character would probably have made as good a show by utilising\nthe experience gained at the first sitting, even if the identity of the\nsitter remained unknown. But, as already said, it seems possible\nthat, in the twenty-four hours which elapsed between the first sitting\nand the second, Mrs. Piper's trance-intelligence had penetrated Pro\nfessor Hyslop's disguise ; and that when he came for the second time she\nknew or strongly suspected who he was. Such an assumption seems,\nhowever, hardly necessary to explain the results. The things said are\nthe mere commonplace of mediumistic seances ; the attitude indicated\nof the older to the younger generation is far from being uncommon; in\n\f384 Frank Podmore. [PART\nshort, the whole situation is such as might have been divined by an\nintelligence far inferior to that of Mrs. Piper's trance-personality. But\nProfessor Hyslop says that not only the ideas, but the form in which\nthey are conveyed, were characteristic of his father. Here, again, the\nphraseology seems too little distinctive to justify any certain inference.\nThey are phrases which, in this country at any rate, would naturally\ncome from the mouth of a medium playing, with some plausibility it\nmust be admitted, the part here assumed. But let the reader judge for\nhimself. Here are the chief words and phrases used at the seance, and\nclaimed as characteristic : \" Give me my hat and let me go ; \" \" Tired\nout ; \" \" It was me [the \" me \" is natural for father] \" ; \" What is their\nloss is our gain ; \" \" Stick to this ; \" \" Do you recall your lectures, and,\nif so, to whom do you recite them now ? [this word \" recite \" is very\nsingular: it is like him];\" \"Well, I was not so far wrong, after all;\"\n\" You had your own ideas ; \" \" Well, it is not a fault ; \" \" Sincerity of\npurpose ; \" \" All the difficulties which you encounter,\" etc., etc.\nOne more point before we leave the consideration of this seance. In\nthe statistical summary already mentioned Professor Hyslop enumerates\n49 separate factors, of which one only is classed as false. There were\nthree incorrect names given \u2014 \"Elsie,\" \"Robertson,\" and \"Uncle\nCharles.\" Which of them is classed as \" false,\" and which as \" true \"\nor \" indeterminate \" ?\nLet us now take a sample from another part of the series. In\nFebruary, 1899, Dr. Hodgson held five sittings with Mrs. Piper, on\nProfessor Hyslop's behalf, in the absence of that gentleman. I propose\nto deal with the first of these, partly because it is the first, partly\nbecause, as containing no \" mixed \" or \" indeterminate \" statements,\nit is the simplest. Every statement is classed, in the statistical summary,\nas true or false: there are 8 true incidents, consisting of 14 factors,\nand 2 false incidents, one containing 4 and the other 6 factors, or 14\ntrue factors against 10 false; on the whole a favourable balance. I\ncannot, by any system of calculation, make my analysis of the sitting\nagree with Professor Hyslop's. The false factors can readily be\nidentified ; indeed I make the total sum rather larger. But the true\nfactors, on the most favourable interpretation, amount, according to my\nreckoning, to 1 1 only. But let the reader judge. The relevant matter\nbegins about half way down page 370.\nRector is represented as explaining to the spirit of Professor\nHyslop's father that the sitter is \"not James, but Hodgson.\" The\nspirit then says that he wants to speak to James (one true factor), and\nrefers to a previous conversation on the subject of Emanuel Swedenborg\n\fXLV.] Professor Hydop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 385\n(one true incident, consisting of two factors, but clearly not evidential,\nas the reference to Swedenborg had been made at a previous sitting).\nThen follows the precise statement by the spirit : \" I am thinking of\nthe time some years ago when I went into the mountains for a change\nwith him, and the trip we had to the lake after we left the camp \" (one\nwholly false incident of 4 factors).\nNext comes a long and definite, though fragmentary, account of a\ntrip out west, and an accident to the train, owing to the engine going\nthrough a bridge, which delayed their journey several days, and gave\nhis father a nervous shock, from which he never fully recovered (one\nwholly false incident of 6 factors).\nThere is a vague reference to a fire (one true factor, but not\nevidential, as it had already cropped up at previous sittings).\nAfter the mention of the fire, and the railway accident, and the\nnervous shock, comes the statement: \"I have now completely recovered\nfrom this, and I can walk about as well as ever I could\" (p. 372).\nApparently Professor Hyslop counts this statement as true (one \" true \"\nincident of 2 factors).\nA reference to \"long talks\" on \"possibilities of communication\"\n(one true incident of 2 factors).\nA spectacle case is produced. The spirit recognises the case as\nhaving been his own, and states correctly that he called the glasses\n\" spectacles \" (one true incident of 2 factors).\nThere is then a reference to \" Nannie.\" As there was apparently no\nperson named Nannie to whom a reference here could be pertinent,\nI should class \" Nannie \" as false, or, at best, as indeterminate. But\nit seems clear from the summary that Professor Hyslop has classed\nit as true, on the assumption that \" Nannie \" was Rector's mistake for\n\" Maggie \" (one false factor).\nThe only other evidential statement in the seance occurs on p. 375,\nan allusion to Professor Hyslop being in New York at the time (one\ntrue factor, but, as Professor Hyslop points out, the statement has\nlittle evidential value).\nTo sum up, then, I find 11 false factors as against 10, and 11 true as\nagainst 14, on Professor Hyslop's reckoning.\nPractically not one of the 1 1 true factors has any value as evidence,\nbeing either repetition of statements made at previous sittings, or, as\nin the case of the recognition of the spectacle case, things such as the\nmedium could readily infer without extraneous assistance.\nBut the false statements are new, precise, and categorical. And\nProfessor Hyslop adopts a very curious method of dealing with\n\f386 Frank Podmore. [PART\nthem. The statement that Mr. Hyslop, senior, went with his son\nto the mountains, and then on a trip to the lake after leaving the\n.camp, is admitted to be false. But they did once go together to a\ntown called Champaign (generally pronounced Shampane, and so\npronounced, according to the stepmother, by Mr. Hyslop, senior,\nthough Professor Hyslop thinks he called it Campane). After this they\nwent to Chicago, and naturally visited the lake shore whilst in the city.\nProfessor Hyslop then suggests a possible reconstruction of the\nstatement, as follows :\nMr. Hyslop, senior, is supposed to be dictating to Rector, who is\nwriting through Mrs. Piper's hand (p. 409) :\n\" I am thinking of the time some years ago when I went into [Father says\n'Illinois.' Rector does not understand this, and asks if he means 'hilly.'\nFather says, ' no ! prairies.i Rector does not understand. Father says, ' no\nmountains.' Rector understands this as 'No! Mountains,' and continues]\nthe mountains for a change with him, and the trip we had to the lake after\nwe left [Father says, 'Champaign.' Rector understands 'camp,' and con\ntinues] the camp.\" The name of the town is usually pronounced Shampane,\nand according to my stepmother my father so pronounced it when living,\nthough my own recollection is that he often pronounced it Campane.\nThe following are a few more instances of the same method : On p.\n384 the spirit being asked what medicine he used to take besides\nstrychnine and Hyomei, replies morphine. Mr. Hyslop, senior, did\nnot apparently take morphine, but he did take arsenic. \"Now this\narsenic is not morphine, but it is a poison that was very closely\nassociated in father's mind when living with the common class of\npoisons, and it might be a natural mistake to make here in men\ntioning it instead of arsenic \" (p. 410).\nAgain (p. 386) the spirit is asked if he remembers Samuel Cooper.\nThe reply is that he was an old friend in the West, and that they used\nto have long talks on philosophical subjects. Of Samuel Cooper, an old\nneighbour of Mr. Hyslop's, the statement is false. But there was\n(p. 411) a Dr. Joseph Cooper, with whom Mr. Hyslop may have\ncorresponded on theological matters in 1858. It is true that Joseph\nis not the same name as Samuel, that the correspondence is purely\nconjectural, that in any case writing is not the same as talking, and\nthat theology is not precisely philosophy, also, that Dr. Cooper did\nnot live West of Mr. Hyslop, but, unfortunately, East. There was,\nhowever, a Cooper Memorial College, which was founded after his\ndeath, of which Mr. Hyslop may have been thinking ; or the mention\nof talk on philosophy may have been intended to refer to Dr. Cooper's\n\fXLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 387\ncorrespondence on theology with Professor Hyslop's uncle. \" The\nmisunderstanding would probably be Rector's \" (p. 500). On the whole\nProfessor Hyslop thinks that the incident \" has considerable interest\nand importance\" (p. 410).\nOnce more, after referring to friendly discussion and correspondence\nwith Cooper, the spirit continues (p. 397) : \"I had also several tokens\n(1 the word is apparently not legible), which I recollect well. One\nwas a photo, to which I referred when James was present. . . .\" No\nphotograph can apparently be traced of either Samuel Cooper or\nJoseph Cooper. But Professor Hyslop finds much significance in the\nallusion to the \" tokens.\" For his explanation of the term, which is\ntoo long and involved to quote, see pp. 411-2.\nOr, again, take this statement. The spirit says (p. 397): \"Do you\nremember the stick I used to carry with the turn in the end, on which\nI carved my initials ? If so, what have you done with it ? They are\nin the end\u2014with the turn\u2014TURN, he says.\"\nTo a plain man this is a very clear and definite description of a stick\nwith a curved handle, having the owner's initials carved by himself on\nthe curved part of the handle. Now Mr. Hyslop, senior, did at one\ntime possess a stick with his initials carved upon it, not apparently by\nhimself; but the stick was straight. Further, he had possessed at\nleast two sticks with curved handles, but on neither were his initials\ncarved. But one of the latter sticks had been given to Mr. Hyslop by\nhis brother-in-law, who had been responsible for the loss of the straight,\ninitial-bearing stick.\n\" If, then, the sentence had read : ' Do you remember the stick I used to\ncarry with the turn in the end, which was given me for the one on which\nmy initials were carved in the end?' it would have expressed the exact\ntruth very clearly . . . and there would have been no confusion about it \"\n(p. 415).\nIt is hardly necessary to give any more instances, or to carry the\nanalysis further. The reader can compare my summary with the\ndetailed statements in the appendices, and see for himself whether\nI have perverted the facts. He can also, with very little trouble,\nsatisfy himself that the samples which I have chosen for analysis have\nnot been chosen unfairly. No doubt the last series of sittings, held in\nMay and June, 1899, show a decidedly smaller proportion of incorrect\nstatements, and a larger amount of coherent and relevant matter. But\nthis was of course inevitable, if the trance-intelligence knew how to\nprofit by its own previous mistakes, and to utilise information gained\nfrom the sitter at previous seances. Moreover, we are hardly entitled\n\f388 Frank Podmore. [PART\nto assume, as Professor Hyslop does apparently assume, that the\nmedium did not make use of external sources of information.\nThe conclusion reached some years since by Dr. Hodgson and most\nother persons who have studied the previous evidence\u2014that Mrs.\nPiper, as a matter of fact, did not derive the information uttered in her\ntrances from such sources as private enquiry agencies\u2014rests primarily\non the consideration that the actual conditions under which the seances\nwere held would have rendered such fraud useless or impossible. It\ndid not rest, and ought not to rest, on any one's conviction of the\nhonesty of the medium. The whole history of spiritualism and psychical\nresearch should convince us that we are never entitled to assume the\nhonesty of the medium. We know at once too much and too little of\nmediumship. Too much, for we know that almost every type of\nmediumship has been connected with dishonesty in the past ; too\nlittle, for if there are honest mediums we don't know by what signs to\ndistinguish them from the dishonest ones. I take it as axiomatic\nthen that if any information was given at these later seances which\ncould, in the interval of five months and a half which had elapsed\nbetween the first seance of the first series and the last of this later series,\nhave been obtained by any fairly intelligent person,\u2014whether from\nregisters, tombstones, old newspapers, directories, or any other sources,\n\u2014this information is to be attributed to such sources. That so\nlittle real information was given goes to show that at any rate the\nmedium was not an adept in making enquiries. But there is one\nincident\u2014the curious confusion between the identity of John\nM'CIellan, father of one of the communicating spirits, and another\nperson of the same name coming from the same part of the country,\nto whom reference is made in a county history\u2014which might be\nheld to point to an unsuccessful attempt of the kind. Professor\nHyslop considers the passage in which this suspicious mistake is\nmade as \" one of the finest sets of pertinent and evidential incidents\nin the record\" (pp. Ill, 470, 535).\nPsychologists tell us that in perceptive processes inadequate and\nambiguous stimuli are peculiarly apt to give rise to hallucination ; or,\nin other words, faint sights and sounds are liable to be interpreted\naccording to the wishes or beliefs of the percipient : and the same\nlaw appears to hold good when we are dealing not with sensations but\nwith ideas. History supplies us with abundant examples of elaborate\ntheories constructed out of material sufficiently vague and indeter\nminate to allow wide latitude of interpretation.\n\fXLV.] Review. 389\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEWS.\nModern Spiritualism: a History and a Criticism. By FRANK PODMORE.\n2 Vols. 8vo. (Methuen & Co., London, 1902.)\nApart from the Proceedings themselves, this book may fairly be described\nas the most important contribution to the subject of psychical research that\nhas\u2014up to the end of 1902\u2014appeared since the publication of Phantasms\nof the Living. If a long and profound study of the subject and a wide\nacquaintance with cognate subjects, an accurate knowledge of facts and a\nphilosophic grasp of principles, a strict and impartial adherence to scientific\nmethod regardless of whether or not it leads to distasteful conclusions,\u2014if\nthese are the qualities requisite for dealing with this topic, it would be\nhard to find any living writer better fitted than Mr. Podmore for the\nwork.\nApart from the desirability of having the whole history in a single\ncompact form, with the most copious and exact references to the original\nauthorities, we had reached a stage at which a critical summary of\nthe results so far attained was urgently needed, and it is fortunate indeed\nthat both tasks have fallen into such competent hands. It may be\nadded that the book is written in a clear, concise and crisp style, which\nmakes it easy and pleasant to read.\nThe author thus describes his object in writing it (Vol. I., p. xi) : \" The\nsystem of beliefs known as Modern Spiritualism\u2014a system which in one\naspect is a religious faith, in another claims to represent a new department\nof natural science\u2014is based on the interpretation of certain obscure\nfacts as indicating the agency of the spirits of dead men and women.\nThe primary aim of the present work is to provide the necessary data\nfor determining how far, if at all, that interpretation is justified. But\nthe question, Is the belief justified 1 cannot, as the whole history of\nmysticism stands to prove, be finally answered until we are prepared\nwith a more or less adequate answer to two subsidiary questions : first,\nIf not justified, what is the true interpretation of the facts : and, second,\nHow can the origin and persistence of the false interpretation be\nexplained 1\"\n20\n\f390 Alice Johnson. [PART\nTo answer these questions, we have to take account of the history\nof the movement and of the prior systems of belief from which it sprang.\nThe persistent neglect of the evidence by its opponents seems to have\nbeen due to their belief that the movement would die out of itself ; and\nten years ago these expectations appeared on the way to fulfilment ;\nbut within the last decade the strongest evidence ever adduced for the\nbelief in communion with the dead has been furnished through Mrs.\nPiper, while the physical manifestations occurring in the presence of\nEusapia Paladino have strongly impressed more than one eminent man\nof science.\n\" Whether the belief in the intercourse with spirits is well founded\"\nor not, it is certain (says Mr. Podmore, Vol. I., p. xiii) that no critic\nhas yet succeeded in demonstrating the inadequacy of the evidence upon\nwhich the Spiritualists rely. That evidence groups itself into two distinct\ncategories ; and in some cases those who accept the one category reject\nwholly or in part facts coming under the other. In the first place we have\nto consider certain subconscious activities mauifesting themselves in trance\nspeaking, automatic writing, seeing of visions, which though they may be\nreadily counterfeited, are not necessarily, or in typical cases, associated with\nimposture. In the second place, second in the historical as in the logical\norder, there are certain physical manifestations, unquestionably, in their\nlater developments, bearing strong resemblance to conjuring tricks, but\nas unquestionably appearing in the first instance in the presence and\nthrough the agency of uneducated and unskilled persons, mostly young\nchildren, and in circumstances where the hypothesis of trickery presents\nformidable moral as well as physical difficulties.\"\nTo the man in the street, \" spiritualism \" generally connotes the \" physical\nphenomena \" only ; and though to students of psychical research the\nmental phenomena are at least equally familiar, Mr. Podmore's analysis\nof the development of the two classes is not only original, but highly\ninstructive.\nHe points out that the physical phenomena are of comparatively recent\norigin. With the exception of the single well-defined Poltergeist type,\nthere is\u2014broadly speaking\u2014no parallel to be found for them in civilised\ncountries during the last three or four centuries at least.i On the other\nhand the mental manifestations\u2014inspired writing and speaking, spiritual\nhealing, telepathy and clairvoyance\u2014may be derived directly through the\nphenomena of Animal Magnetism back to those of ecstasy, obsession,\nmagic and witchcraft. Thus it appears that this type stretches back in\na series that has probably never been broken to the dawn of human\nhistory,\u2014showing so far no tendency to disappear with the advance of\ncivilisation,\u2014while the former species has only occurred sporadically\u2014\niMrs. Sidgwiok points out in her article on \"Spiritualism\" in the\nBritannica that a practice of causing heavily-loaded tables to rise by \"magic\" seems\nto have existed among the German Jews in the 17th oentury. See Von Hut-less,\nAtgyptisci< Mystcrien, 1866, pp. 130-132.\n\fXLV.] Beview, 391\nas a sort of adventitious or parasitic aftergrowth, attached here and there\nto the main organism of belief, but at no time forming an integral part\nof it.\n\" For the proper understanding of the subject it is essential to note\n(Vol. I., p. xiv) that the recognition of the trance phenomena, as testifying\nto the existence of a spiritual world, preceded the acceptance of the physical\nmanifestations as signs and wonders vouchsafed from that world. The\nraps and movements of tables did not, in the ultimate analysis, originate\nanything ; they served merely to confirm a pre-existing belief. It is, no\ndoubt, amongst other causes, primarily because of the failure to recognise\nthis historical sequence that most attempts to demonstrate the falsity\nof the Spiritualist belief have proved ineffectual. It was of little use\nfor the American doctors to prove that the raps could be produced by\ncracking of the joints, or Faraday that tables could be turned by un\nconscious muscular action alone ; for Maskelyne to imitate the rope-tying\nfeats of the Davenport Brothers ; or for hardy investigators at a later\ndate to seize the spirit form at a dark stance. Alike in the larger historical\ncycle and in the sequence of each individual experience, the faith in\nSpiritualism was buttressed by these things, not based on them ; and\nthough shaken, could not be permanently overthrown by any demonstration\nof their futility.\"\nThe subject divides itself into three main topics, which we may take in\norder : (1) the history of the movement, (2) the so-called physical\n.phenomena, (3) the mental manifestations.\nI. THE HISTORY or THE MOVEMENT.\nMr. Podmore shows that Spiritualism is historically the direct outgrowth\nof Animal Magnetism, starting, e.g., in America from the revelations\nof a magnetic clairvoyant, Andrew Jackson Davis\u2014the \" Poughkeepsie\nSeer,\" and its first exponents being drawn from the ranks of those who\nhad studied and practised Animal Magnetism. The spiritualistic inter\npretation of the trance had also been widely adopted in Europe long\nbefore 1848, the year of (among other things) the famous rappings. For\na proper understanding of the subject of Spiritualism, then, it becomes\nnecessary to study the earlier mystical beliefs and especially the cult of\nAnimal Magnetism in America and Europe. Until recently those who\npaid any attention to this cult were divided into two fiercely opposed\ncamps\u2014one believing devoutly not only in the phenomena but in the\nmost fantastic explanations of them, especially the operation of a subtle\nfluid ; while the other rejected them wholesale, as the results at least of\nmal-observation, if not of fraud. The two eminent men of science,\nBertraud and Braid, who accepted the phenomena while attempting to\nrelate them to known physiological laws, entirely failed to gain the ear\nof their scientific contemporaries, and were treated with even more con\ntumely by believers than by sceptics. \"Nature, it may be said, (observes\n\f392 Alice Johnson. [PART\nMr. Podmore) abhors a Mugwump.\" Let us hope that the S.P.R. will never\nbe led to stultify its work through sharing in the same prejudice !\nIn the case of hypnotism, posterity came round after all to the side of\nthe Mugwumps, finding in their views a rationalistic explanation of facts\nwhich it was no longer possible to ignore ; and Mr. Podmore suggests\nthat the modern doctrine of telepathy may similarly be found to furnish\na rationalistic explanation of many facts which have been attributed to\nspiritual agencies. Headers of the Proceedings will be aware that the same\nview was maintained by Mr. Myers in his articles on automatic writing,\nalthough, of course, Mr. Podmore is inclined to press the explanation much\nfurther than Mr. Myers did.\nHis work is divided into four books : I. The Pedigree of Spiritualism ;\nII. Early American Spiritualism ; III. Spiritualism in England ; IV.\nProblems of Mediumship. In Book I., Possession and Witchcraft are\nfirst treated of, with accounts of many historical cases of \" speaking with\ntongues\" (a topic which recurs in connection with various clairvoyants and\nlater trance mediums) : the Nuns of Loudun, the Tremblers of the Cevennes,\nthe Convulsionaries of St. Medard and the Irvingites. Witchcraft has\noften : been taken as a text to show the folly of human beliefs and the\nunreliability of human testimony. In Phantasms of the Living Gurney\nhad already pointed out that, as a matter of fact, the evidence for witch\ncraft was very poor, consisting to a large extent of inferences rather\nthan observations, while the observations were either those of children\nand uneducated persons, or reported at second-hand. To this Mr.\nPodmore adds an instructive comparison of the earlier witchcraft to the\nlater Poltergeist phenomena. In both cases it is almost always children\nor uneducated persons who are concerned. There is much, again, in witch\ncraft which is now understood to be due to hysteria and suggestion,\naffecting both the bystanders and agents or victims, and Mr. Podmore\ngives reasons for supposing that the similar Poltergeist effects are attribut\nable to similar causes.\nIt is important to note that the general argument depends for its\ncogency on the assumption\u2014 an assumption amply borne out by the whole\nhistory of \" physical phenomena \"\u2014that the things described were not the\nthings that occurred, but only what the witnesses\u2014sooner or later, but\ngenerally later\u2014believed to have occurred. Not that this assumption is\ntaken by the writer for granted ; but that detailed comparisons of\ncontemporary with later, and first-hand with second-hand, evidence show\nit to be necessary. The principle has long been accepted\u2014theoretically\u2014\nby the S.P.R., and we lose nothing by seeing it applied now and then\nwith relentless logic.\nAn interesting confirmation of Mr. Podmore's explanation of Poltergeists\nis to be found in a case given above (p. 320) by Mr. Lang, in which\nPoltergeist phenomena were produced by a servant girl in consequence\u2014\napparently\u2014of a prediction made to her by a witch, which seems to have\nacted as a suggestion. The special interest of this case is that the girl\n\fXLV.] . Review. 393\nappears to have acted automatically, without intention and perhaps\nunconsciously. ;\nWe may find in the future that a good many cases of \"physical\nphenomena\" may be similarly explained. See e.g. a case reported by\nProfessor Janet in the Bulletin de I'Institut Psychologique International\n(December, 1901) and referred to by Mr. Podmore (Vol. II., p. 325).\nThe next part of the book treats of the rise and progress of \" animal\nmagnetism \" before and after Mesmer, its spread in different countries\nand the various theories as to some kind of force, generally conceived of\nas a fluid, to which the effects were attributed ; the early observations of\nthe trance by Puysegur ; the so-called transpositions of the senses described\nby P6t6tin ; the occasional instances of what appeared to be clairvoyance\nor thought-transference observed by some of the most scientific investi\ngators ; the growth of the trance-phenomena* which gradually came more\nand more, partly through the influence of Swedenburg, to be attributed\nto the control of spirits\u2014especially in Sweden, France, and Germany ;\nthe German somnambules, with their visions of heaven and their crude\nmystical, or rather material, theories of the universe ; the comparatively\nLite introduction of mesmerism into England, where the interest roused\nin it was keen indeed, but limited, its opponents being even more violent\nthan its supporters, and where the Spiritistic interpretation of the trance\nfound little favour ;\u2014of all these things a valuable historical account is\ngiven, with full references to the original sources.\n. What chiefly strikes one is the hurry that these observers were in to come\nto conclusions, and find explanations\u2014or even to found complete theories of\nlife on what they had witnessed. They had, indeed, abundance of facts\niefore them\u2014facts even which, unlike many of those with which\npsychical research has to deal, could be repeated at will. It' was easy\nenough to induce visions, to obtain trance utterances, to produce\u2014in\nwell-trained subjects\u2014\" transpositions of the senses \" and \" phrenological \"\nphenomena, specific reactions to metals and magnets, and so on. But, as\nwe know, the experimenters generally failed to grasp one important prin\nciple,\u2014the efficacy of suggestion; and for want of this much of their work\nis useless. Now, as Dr. Bramwell remarks (Proceedings, Vol. XII., p. 224)\nand as Mr. Myers especially insists upon (Human Personality, Chapter V.),\n\"suggestion\" is not an explanation, but merely a formula (like many Other\nso-called explanations) ; but it is now recognised to be a formula in\ndispensable to any rational interpretation of hypnotism. The history\nof animal magnetism shows usr then, the imperative necessity of sus\npending our judgment on a science still in , ,so rudimentary a stage as\npsychical research, lest we, too, should be wandering uselessly iii a\nlabyrinth, and shutting our eyes all the time to some clue which may be\nlying close at our feet. , \u2022 ' ,\nEarly records of clairvoyance and thought-transference are next treated\nof, with critical discussions of some of the best evidence. The careful\nreader of this early evidence (to be found in the Zoist and elsewhere)\n\f394 Alice Johnson. [PART\nwill probably agree with Mr. Podmore in thinking it inconclusive. The\nexperimenters, as a rule, made little or no allowance for hypersesthesi*\nand heightened intelligence in the trance, or for subconscious interpreta\ntions by their subjects of slight indications unconsciously given by\nthemselves. The possibilities of codes and of conjuring were not taken\nmuch account of, and the records generally were kept with little care.\nThere remain, however, a certain number of good cases, to which weight\nmay fairly be allowed, since they have been reinforced later by evidence\nmore up to modern requirements. Among these, Mr. Podmore gives a\nprominent place to the remarkable trance utterances of Cahagnet's subject,\nAdcle Maginot (already described in his article in Proceedings, Vol. XIV.,\np. 50), the only one of the early sensitives whom he thinks worthy to\nbe compared with Mrs. Piper.\nHe passes on next to the early cult of mesmerism in America. Here\nthe subject was chiefly taken up by persons of little or no scientific\neducation, with the result that the more extravagant theories of phrenology\nand nerve-fluids were carried to great extremes and set forth in barbar\nous systems of nomenclature.\nThe mesmerised subjects soon developed into trance mediums, of whom\nAndrew Jacksoii Davis, the Poughkeepsie seer, was the most famous. Hia\n\" Harmonial Philosophy \" was expounded in a series of lectures given\nduring trance, and afterwards published. These \"Revelations\" deal with\nthe evolution of the universe,\u2014or, as Davis preferred to call it, the\nUnivercoelum,\u2014and show a curious mixture of arrogance and ignorance.\nMr. Podmore gives a few instances of the \" scientific \" statements made\n\u2014e.g. the description of the ichthyosaurus inhaling through an adipose\nbranches (sir) an atmosphere which consisted of carbon, nearly counter\nbalanced by oxygen. Of his philosophy, we are not after this surprised\nto hear that its meaning is \" elusive beyond the tolerated usage of\nphilosophers.\" Yet his work shows traces of certain qualities which n>ay\npartly account for the extraordinary popularity it achieved. He had\nclearly been much influenced by Fourierism a7id Swedenborgianism ; he\nhad realised \" something of the orderly progression from the primaeval\nfire mist ; something of the unity in complexity of the monstrous world ;\nsomething, too, of the social needs of his time and of ours\u2014the waste,\nthe injustice, the manifold futilities and absurdities involved in the present\nstage of economic evolution. . . . He could appreciate the bigness of\nthe ideas with which he dealt, and in a semi-articulate, barbarous fashion,\ncould make other people appreciate them too.\"\nBut his fame is chiefly to be attributed to the \"Rochester knockings,\"\nwhich formed the next epoch in the movement, and were regarded by\nDavis and his followers as the fulfilment of his prophecy of freer spirit-\nintercourse with earth.\nThe history of the originators of these knockings\u2014the Fox sisters\u2014and\ntheir host of followers and imitators, given in full in Book II., needs no\nspecial comment here. Copious extracts are given from original sources.\n\fXLV.] Review. 395\nof the best evidence for the \"physical phenomena\" produced by these\nmediums ; and it is shown how far that evidence falls short of what is\nrequired. \" To the reader of to-day \" (says Mr. Podmore, Vol. I., p. 249,\nand few would probably be prepared to contradict the assertion) \" the\nmere statement of such belief on such grounds may well appear preposter\nous. Logical grounds for the belief\u2014as logic is understood in the modern\nworld\u2014were clearly wanting. But the matter should not on that account\nbe summarily dismissed as a pale recrudescence of mediaeval superstition.\nFor which of us is in better case ? The causes of belief in the last\nanalysis are not logical. It should not be overlooked that, in the present\ninstance, the men who believed, if not of high intellectual distinction, had\nat least proved themselves capable, and had won more or less reputation\namongst their fellow-citizens as merchants, preachers, university pro\nfessors, physicians, lawyers, legislators, and men of science ; that many of\nthem had embraced such belief when still in the prime of life and the\nripeness of their judgment ; that the same beliefs are held by a large\nnumber of persons, even at the present day. We may feel assured that\nin one form or another the belief in such marvels, as it has revived again\nand again in the past, will manifest itself again and again in generations\nto come ; and history shows that those who sneer at such credulity with\nout attempting to understand its causes, are perhaps themselves not the\nleast likely to fall victims, precisely because they do not understand.\"\nAs an aid to such understanding, the author gives a graphic account\nof the American milieu, in which the cult first grew and flourished (Vol.\nL, p. 208, et teq.). \"It was in the conditions of a new and rapidly\nexpanding civilisation, and perhaps in the special genius of the American\npeople, that the explanation must be sought. . . . We find a nation\nin whom the standard of popular education and intelligence was much\nhigher than in England, and probably most other European countries at\nthe same date. But this very diffusion of education was in some aspects\nmischievous. In the older civilisations the world of ideas is still an\noligarchy, with a constitution to some extent fixed and defined. There\nare recognised standards and precedents for the guidance of thought in\nevery department. But in the American Republic of fifty years ago, every\nman claimed the right to think for himself, and to think as extravagantly\nand inconsequently as he chose. . . . Speculation [had] a freedom which\nwould have been impossible in a more settled society. . . . Outside the\nfew large cities [there was] an immense fringe of semi-rural ' townships,'\ncarved out of the wilderness but yesterday, and filled with an enthusiastic\nhorde of pioneers, who had learned to read and to think from men, or as\nwe have just seen, from children, 1 scarcely better trained and equipped\nthan themselves. . . . There was inevitably expended on the problems of\nlife a large amount of vigorous but crude and undisciplined thinking ; and\ni The Rev. J. 6. Ferguson, a prominent spiritualist of the time, at the age of thirteen\nconducted a school at one end of a log house ; a shoemaker, who worked at his trade\nat the other end, holding himself in readiness to help in keeping order.\n\f396 Alice Johnson. [PART\nthe results stand on record now in the history of various American religious\nepidemics, of American Socialisms, of American phrenology, of crusades\nagainst alcohol, tobacco, pork,\" etc. Socialism especially seems, to have\nbeen most intimately bound up with spiritualism. What was attractive in\nthe new creed was its humanitarian and religious side, its appeal to the\nliberal instinct in all departments of thought and feeling, its claim to\nprovide men with a satisfying solution of the most vital problems. \" The\nstrong impulse (Vol. I., p. 225) which transformed the tricks of mischievous\nchildren .... into the beginnings of a new gospel of hope and freedom\nproceeded from men like Warren Chase and John Murray Spear, full of\ncrude but sincere aspirations for the bettering of the world ; men whose\neyes were often blinded by the very splendour of their distant ideals to\nall that was sordid and contemptible in the present. There were many\nmen of the same type who were at that very time labouring for the\nabolition of negro slavery. . . . Many of [these Spiritualists] shared\nwith the Socialists and reformers their large enthusiasms and their\ngenerous incapacity to see the trickeries and mean egotisms which sur\nrounded them.\"\n. The follies and extravagances associated with the movement were\nindeed obvious enough, as may be seen from the instances given by Mr.\n\u2022Podmore. But he is careful to point out\u2014and this is what makes his\nhistory of value\u2014that all these absurdities were mere excrescences on\nthe movement, and not an essential part of it. The main body of\n.Spiritualists repudiated them, and though they received the physical pheno\nmena credulously enough, they regarded them chiefly as signs\u2014not as\nevidences\u2014of a spiritual force. It was on the mental phenomena that they\nrelied,\u2014the indications .of intelligence in the raps ; the trance-utterances\nand visions ; the doctrines that in many respects harmonised with their\nprevious beliefs, and at their best had nothing positively repugnant to\nordinary common-sense. \" The special characteristi<: of the Spiritualist\nmovement from the beginning has been its democratic character. There\nhas been neither recognised leader nor authoritative statement of creed.\nThis characteristic again gave breadth, tolerance, and expansiveneas to\nthe movement, which made it unique among religious revivals, and\nrendered it possible for the new belief to combine with almost any pre\nexisting system of doctrine\" (Vol. I., p.. 299).\nThis too great .elasticity and plasticity\u2014this \" anaemic optimism \"\u2014had,\n'however, its drawbacks. The philosophy and religion of that early school\nof Spiritualism cannot appeal to cultivated thinkers of to-day. The\nphilosophy is essentially materialistic, and the religion essentially parochial.\n\" The world [which the spirits] present to our view (Vol. I., p. 302) is\na strictly material world, developing by processes .of .material evolution\ntowards an unknown end. There is no mystery about their teaching.\nSpirit is only attenuated matter ; the other world a counterpart of this ;\nthe living universe an endless series of beings like ourselves. Their view\nin short represents the product of common-sense, the comiuou-seuse of\n\fXLV.] Review: 397\nthe ordinary uninstructed man. . . . There is rarely any hint of deeper\ninsight. The problems of Space and Time, of Knowing and Being, of\nEvil and Good, of Will and Law, are .hardly even recognised. Common-\nsense is not competent for these questions ; and in so far as the Spiritualist\nscheme fails to take account of them, it falls short of being a Theology,\nor even an adequate Cosmology. But such as it is, though it makes no\nappeal to the higher imagination, and ignores the deeper mysteries of\nlife, it has for nearly two generations satisfied .the intellectual needs and\nthe emotional cravings of hundreds of thousands of votaries. And its\nfollowers can boast that\"\u2014they have the qualities of their defects\u2014\n\" throughout that period they have shown a sympathy for opinions\ndiffering from their own, and a tolerance for their opponents, unique in\nthe history of sects called religious.\"\nIn 1852 the new ideas first penetrated into England through the visit\nof an American medium, Mrs. Hayden. Up to that time, such \"clair\nvoyance \" as had been found associated with the mesmeric trance had\nnot as a rule received the Spiritualistic interpretation. An epidemic\nof table-turning now set in, answers to questions being obtained by\ntilts or by raps at particular letters as the questioner ran his finger\nalong an alphabet. The results were received with much greater scepticism\nin England than they had been in America. G. H. Lewes, e.g., showed\nhow he could get any answer he wished for through the medium's\nobservation of the way he hesitated at the appropriate letters, and others\nnoticed that she could only succeed when the alphabet was in her view.\nBraid again, and afterwards Faraday, proved that the table might be\nmoved with entire unconsciousness on the part of the agents. The English\nmesmerists in general, however, adopted table-turning with enthusiasm,\nfinding in the supposed vital or \" electro-odycal \" force that produced it\na confirmation of their theories of Animal Magnetism. On the other\nhand the practice was violently attacked by a group of Evangelical\nclergy, who attributed the movements to Satanic agency.\nII. THE SO-CALLED PHYSICAL PHENOMENA.\nAt this period the \" physical phenomena \" exhibited by most mediums\nwere sporadic and simple \u2014 raps, spirit-lights, and a rudimentary form\nof slate-writing, as practised by Miss Marshall. The rapid growth of\nspiritualism is to be attributed rather to the extraordinary outburst of\nautomatic activity\u2014visions, trance-speaking, writing and drawing\u2014that\nnext took place, and which excited much more interest in its adherents.\nThe literature of the time is chiefly concerned with these, and the physical\n.phenomena are generally passed over with such remarks as that of Mrs.\nde Morgan that \" instances of tables rising from the floor to the height\nof three or four feet are so well attested\" that it is hardly necessary\n.to refer to them.\n\u2022. In 1860, however, the movement entered upon a new phase, in\n\f398 Alice Johnson. [PART\nconsequence of what Mr. Podmore describes as the American Invasion,\u2014\nthe visit of a long succession of American mediums, the most prominent\nof whom was Home, to England. Professional mediumship had now\nbecome highly developed, and the physical phenomena were much more\ncomplicated and varied than before. Descriptions are given of typical\nperformances of the principal mediums of this period, and of the successful\nimitation of many of them by conjurers ; also of many exposures and\ndiscoveries of fraud. Mr. Podmore of course fully admits that to prove\ntrickery in some cases is not to prove it in all, and that it is conceivable\nthat a medium might sometimes cheat and at other times produce genuine\nphenomena ; but he contends that, apart from the evidence presented\nby Home's seances, no presumption of a new physical agency is established\nby the records of these mediums.\nWith regard to the general method of dealing with evidence on all\nthese subjects\u2014the mental as well as the physical phenomena\u2014one diffi\nculty is that the accounts are always more or less ambiguous, because the\nrecorder unconsciously assumes in the reader a certain degree of familiarity\nwith the circumstances. Any one who has made a serious attempt to\ngive a really accurate description of a complicated event will know how\ndifficult it is to avoid using some expression which may legitimately\nbe misinterpreted by a reader. And the witnesses here dealt with are\noften little practised either in observing or describing. The question\nthen constantly arises : when a passage or an event is susceptible of\ntwo or more interpretations, which ought we to take ?\nWhen this question arises in the course of a scientific research into\nany alleged new fact or principle, the authenticity of which is disputed,\nevery one agrees that we should invariably take the less favourable\ninterpretation,\u2014that the burden of proof lies throughout on those who\nattempt to establish the new fact or principle.\nIt is because psychical research is hardly yet recognised as a branch\nof science\u2014even by psychical researchers\u2014that this method is so\ngrudgingly admitted in its case. People cannot get away from the idea\nthat we are investigating the characters of the witnesses rather than\nthe events occurring in their presence. Of course the character of the\nwitness is one factor in the evidence ; and if our primary object were\nto determine whether a witness or a medium was an honest person, it\nwould not be out of place to exercise charity of judgment. But the\nquestion of the probity of witnesses is here a purely secondary one, and\nconcerns us merely as bearing on the question of the authenticity of\nthe facts. In judging the latter, it cannot be too strongly insisted on\nthat we are bound always to take the most unfavourable interpretation.\nMr. Podmore has faithfully followed this principle, with the result\nthat his book is an admirable example of scientific method, and will\nno doubt be fiercely attacked on that score.\nIt must further be admitted that in his lighter moments he sometimes\nallows himself to indulge in humorous gibes, which add to the literary\n\fXLV.] Review. 399\nform of the narrative, but are hardly calculated to conciliate opponents.\nHis more serious utterances, however, show no lack of sympathy or\nrespect for those who differ from him in opinion ; for instance, his\ndescription of the early American spiritualists, some part of which has\nalready been quoted, and the following passage in reference to the physical\nphenomena :\n(Vol. II., p. 141) \"The dealings of science with spiritualism form\nan instructive chapter in the history of human thought. Not the least\ninstructive feature of the chronicle is the sharp contrast between\nthe tone and temper of those men of science who, after examination,\naccepted, and of those who, with or without examination, rejected the\nevidence for the alleged physical phenomena. Those who held themselves\njustified in believing in a new physical force\u2014for De Morgan, Crookes,\nand other scientific converts did not at the outset, nor in some cases at\nall, adopt the Spiritualist belief proper\u2014showed in their writings a\nmodesty, candour, and freedom from prepossession, which shine the more\nconspicuously by comparison with the blustering arrogance of some of the\nself-constituted champions of scientific orthodoxy.\"\nAfter a most careful examination of the subject, however, he comes to\nthe conclusion (Vol. II., p. 182) that \"generally, the strongest evidence\nyet considered for the genuineness of any of these manifestations falls far\nshort of the standard of proof which is required before any such claim\ncan be admitted.\" He brings forward two general objections to the accept\nance of the marvels. (1) If the physical effects claimed to have been\nproduced are not due to known physical causes, we have to assume not\none new force capable of acting upon matter, but several, because the\neffects are of so many different kinds.\nThis, of course, is a merely a priori objection, and as such is liable to\nbe upset by further discoveries. Readers who are interested in the\nquestion may be referred to an extremely ingenious speculation in Mr.\nMyers's Human Personality, Vol. II., pp. 530-543, as to how a force or\nentity, analogous to Clerk Maxwell's Demons in the power of dealing\nwith molecules as we deal with masses of matter, might produce many\nof the alleged kinds of phenomena.\nYet (adds Mr. Myers, op. cit. p. 543) \"it is to 'will power' that the\ncommunicating spirits themselves ascribe their achievements ; to some\nmode of operation quite unexplained, but even more direct, more funda\nmental, than those imagined molecular powers which I cited to show how\nmen who believed that no ' demon ' existed, found it necessary to invent\none.\"\n(2) Mr. Podmore's second objection is much more serious, since it relates\nto the nature of the actual facts. \" It is briefly this : The annals of\nSpiritualism offer no physical phenomena which do not, in the last\nanalysis, depend on the experimenter's unaided senses for their observa\ntion, and on his memory for their record.\" Sir William Crookes at\nthe outset of his researches laid down certain rules to which he thought\n\f400 Alice Johnson. [PART\nscientific proof of a new physical force should conform (see his\nResearches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism pp. 6-7) viz., that the effect*\nproduced should not depend for their evidence on simple observation,\nbut should be capable of being registered by scientific instruments, and\nmeasured and tested by scientific tests, so contrived as to be proof\nagainst fraudulent manipulati\u00b0n ; e.g. the passage of an object into a\nhermetically sealed tube.\nThe experiments which come nearest to satisfying these conditions\nare, no doubt, those of Sir William Crookes himself with Home,\nespecially the experiments in the alteration in weight of a board. In\nthese experiments, one end of the board rested on a table and the other\nwas supported by a spring balance. Home placed his fingers on the end\non the table and \" willed \" the board to become heavier or lighter ; the\nvariations in weight being recorded by an automatic register. Mr.\nPodmore suggests that the effect might possibly have been produced\nby the use of a dark thread with a loop attached to some part of the\napparatus\u2014-perhaps the hook of the spring balance\u2014and the ends\nfastened, say, to the knees of Home's trousers (he gives instances of\ntricks performed by similar means). We can only say that the possibility\nof this particular trick does not seem to have occurred to the experi\nmenters (of course not even a conjurer can be expected to be familiar\nwith all possible conjuring tricks), and that the conditions of the seances,\nat described, do not exclude it. A similar explanation is suggested for\nthe movements of a lath and some other small objects at the seances.\nBut to suggest a possible explanation of an event is not to prove that\nit occurred in the way suggested, and Mr. Podmore adds (Vol. II., p.\n243) : \" It is not easy to see how the investigators . . . could have\nbeen deceived, and repeatedly deceived, by any device of the kind\nsuggested ; and if we find ourselves unable to accept Mr. Crookes'\ntestimony, we are guided to an adverse decision less perhaps by any\ndefects which have been demonstrated in the particular evidence here\npresented than by that general presumption against the operation of\nthe supposed new physical energy which . . . inevitably follows from\nan analysis of all the cognate evidence accumulated down to the present\nday.\" The evidence for Sir W. Crookes' experiments may not be perfect,\nbut it is undoubtedly very good. If there were plenty of other evidence\nof the same kind as good, the cumulative effect would be great indeed.\nIt is really because the good evidence is so slender in amount that\ncautious persons may hesitate to build on it.\nThe evidence for Home's phenomena is poor enough apart from that\nof Sir W. Crookes. It must be remembered that he had been practising\nas a medium for some twenty years before these sittings, and though\nhe was never actually exposed, his sitters generally seem to have\nimposed no tests on him, and there are many circumstances in the\nreports which point to some kind of trickery. The reports, e.g., of his\nlevitations (see Vol. I., p. 244, and Vol. II., pp. 253-4) suggest that he\n\fXLV.] . Review. 401\nwas trying to deceive his sitters in the dark by making them think that\nhe was floating in the air when he was really supported by normal means.\nThere is also evidence that illusions, and even hallucinations (see Vol. II.,\np. 268), were fairly frequent at his seances, and as Mr. Podmore says,\nthis may account for many alleged phenomena.\nThe objection generally offered to this explanation is based on the\nsupposition that it implies some kind of hypnotic or abnormal condition\non the part of the hallucinated sitter, whereas sitters as a rule remaiu\nin a normal condition throughout a seance. But hallucinations are often\nexperienced in a normal condition ; just as suggestions are often success-\nfolly imposed by medical hypnotists on patients in a normal waking\nstate : and it seems possible that part of a successful medium's equipment\ndepends on a similar unexplained power of influencing people in an\nunusual way,\u2014something that transcends the skill of a conjurer much\nas the hypnotist's power of suggestion transcends that of the ordinary\ndoctor.\nBesides the instances given in the text of an apparent power of this,\nkind, we may refer to a remarkable account published by Dr. Gibotteau\nin the Annales des Sciences Piychiquet (Sept.-Oct. and Nov.-Dec., 1892)\nof hallucinations imposed\u2014perhaps telepathically and certainly without\nverbal suggestions\u2014on himself and one of his friends by a peasant\nwoman, the daughter of a reputed witch.\nThe section on physical phenomena concludes with two of the most\ninteresting chapters in the book, entitled \"Automatism\" and \"Dream\nConsciousness,\" containing an analysis of the natural history of mediums\nfrom the psychological point of view. \" It would betray \" (says the author,\nVol. II., p. 289) \"a very inadequate conception of the nature of the\nmovement to dismiss it as merely one more instance of the exploitation\nof fools by knaves. That many so-called mediums have been knaves of\na commonplace type there can of course be little question. . . . But\nthe typical mediums, the men or women who have risen to eminence in\ntheir profession, would not come under any such familiar formula. If\nknaves, they seem at any rate to have shared in the folly of their dupes.\nIt is no doubt in this fact that the secret of their power lay. The medium\nsucceeded in deceiving others because, wholly or partially, he at the same\ntime deceived himself ; and he deceived himself because, as a rule, he\nwas not fully aware of what he was doing.\" This thesis is defended with a\nprofundity of knowledge and a wide and philosophic insight into human\nnature ; but it is impossible to do justice to it in the limits of a\nreview.\nIII. THE MENTAL MANIFESTATIONS.\nBut, as already indicated, however conclusively it may be proved that\nthe so-called physical phenomena afford no evidence of the action of any\nphysical force beyond that exerted by the human muscles, Mr. Podmore\nmaintains that the strength of the argument for spiritism remains\n\f402 Alice Johnson. [PART\nunaffected, for this really depends on the evidence for supernormal mental\npowers, as manifested in numerous cases, and pre-eminently in the case of\nMrs. Piper. Evidence of this kind is on an altogether different footing\nfrom that for the physical phenomena, because it relates to matters much\nsimpler in themselves\u2014mere utterances or writings, instead of movements\ninvolving an indefinite number of objects besides the medium\u2014and also\nbecause it does not depend on continuous observation of what is going\non at the moment, but may be recorded in such a way as to be per\nmanently available for study.\nGranting that Mrs. Piper has supernormal powers, we come next to the\nquestion whether telepathy from the living is adequate to explain them,\nor whether we must invoke telepathy from the dead. It matters not in\nthe first instance whether the latter kind of telepathy consists merely of\nimpressions conveyed from the discarnate to the incarnate mind, or\nwhether it develops into a temporary fusion of the two minds\u2014the dis\ncarnate one taking the predominant part and governing the organism for\nthe time, according to Mr. Myers's theory of possession. We have first\nto substantiate the agency of the discarnate mind in the matter, before\nwe need discuss its method of action.\nWhen the case of Mrs. Piper was first discussed, it was generally\nrecognised that as much as possible should be explained by telepathy\nfrom the living, before invoking other agencies ; and this for two reasons :\n(1) the evidence for such telepathy is both good and abundant ; (2) the\nevidence for the most obvious other alternative\u2014telepathy from the dead\n\u2014cannot, from the nature of the case, so far as we can see at present,\never be so good, because we only know what takes place at one end of\nthe telepathic chain, whereas in telepathy from the living we can gain\ninformation as to both ends.\nThese are obvious\u2014even trite\u2014considerations ; but it is necessary to\nrepeat them from time to time because controversy on this subject tends\nto degenerate into arguing whether telepathy from the living or from the\ndead is more probable a priori. The result has been extremely unfortu\nnate. Some who advocate telepathy from the dead have so persistently\nundervalued telepathy from the living as to have created, apparently, an\nimpression that we no longer care to have evidence for it. In the\nearly days of the S.P.R. the great importance of telepathy was better\nunderstood. Mr. Balfour, for instance, in his Presidential address, speaks\nof it as \"a fact (if fact it be) . . . far more scientifically extraordinary\nthan would be the destruction of this globe by [collision with some star].\n... It is a profound mystery if it be true, or if anything like it be\ntrue ; and no event, however startling, which easily finds its appropriate\nniche in the structure of the physical sciences ought to excite half so\nmuch intellectual curiosity as this dull and at first sight commonplace\nphenomenon\" (Proceedings, Vol. X., pp. 9-10).\nApart from the urgent necessity of learning more about telepathy on\naccount of its own intrinsic importance, it is, I am inclined to think,\n\fXLV.] Review. 403\nalong this line that our best chance lies of proving personal immortality.\n\" Whether or not,\" says Mr. Podmore, (Vol. II., p. 359) \" the conditions of\nanother world permit its denizens to hold halting communication with\nthose here is a question of slight and transitory import if we have it in\nour power to demonstrate, from its own inherent properties, that the life\nof the soul is not bound up with the life of the body.\" He refers to Mr.\nMyers's view that the transcendental powers of the subliminal self afford\nevidence of its immortality ; but in one important respect he misconceives\nthis view,\u2014supposing it to rest on the existence in the subliminal self\nof such faculties as prevision, retrocognition, and clairvoyance, for which,\nas he rightly says, the evidence is at present scanty. But Mr. Myers\nexplains clearly and constantly in Human Pertonality (which was not\npublished when Mr. Podmore wrote) that he regards Telepathy as the\nmost fundamental and important of all transcendental faculties. For\ninstance (Vol. I., p. 8), \"In the course of this work it will be my task\nto show in many connections how far-reaching are the implications of\nthis direct and supersensory communion of mind with mind. Among\nthose implications none can be more momentous than the light thrown by\nthis discovery upon man's intimate nature and possible survival of death.\"\nAgain he says (Vol. II., p. 526) that though telepathy cannot actually\nprove survival, it strongly suggests it. The question depends primarily on\nwhether it works through a physical mechanism or not, and Mr. Myers\nadduces many considerations tending to show that the process is essentially\nmental (see e.g. Vol. I., pp. 245-6, Vol. II., p. 195. The same view is\nstrongly expressed in Vol. II., p. 282). The apparent unlikeness of tele\npathic action to the action of any known physical force is also insisted\non by Mr. Balfour in his Presidential Address, quoted above (Proceedings,\nVol. X., pp. 10--11).\nIn any case, it is sufficiently obvious that we have still a great deal to\nlearn on the subject, and we can all endorse Mr. Podmore's final conclusion\nthat the question is one of evidence : \" The task before us is the patient\nanalysis of the existing evidence, and the attempt, preferably by direct\nexperiment, to acquire new evidence on the subject.\"\nALICE JOHNSON.\nThe Varietiet of Religiont Experience, A Study in Human Nature, being the\nGifford Lectures on Natural Religion, delivered at Edinburgh in 1901-2, by\nWILLIAM JAMES (Longmans, Green & Co., London, New York, and Bombay,\n1902).

For in his latest book, which i.s\nsure to be at least as widely read as any of its predecessors, the greatest of\nliving psychologists assigns so fundamental an importance to the influence of\nwhat the late Frederic Myers called the Subliminal, and uses it so freely and\nbrilliantly to explain the psychological facts he is describing, that it seems\n\f404 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART\nimpossible that psychologists will be able to evade much longer the considera\ntion either of the conception or of the evidence on which it is based. The\nreaders of Professor James' exquisite tribute to the late President of the\nS.P.R. (Proceedings, Part XLII.) will indeed be familiar with his appreciation\nof the subconscious factors in mental life, but even these will probably\nexperience some surprise at the extensive use made in the present volume\nof the group of conceptions with which psychical researchers have attempted\nto explore the dark corners of the human mind. Professor James' example\ndoes much to remove two of the chief difficulties with which the S.P.R. has\nhad to contend in its dealings with academic psychologists, viz: (1) that of\nconnecting its subjects with the ordinary topics of psychological concern, aud\n(2) that of finding employment for its conceptions in normal psychology.\nNow it has recently been maintained by the new ' pragmatist ' school of\nphilosophers that to prove a doctrine useful is the first step towards proving\nit true ; it supplies at least a motive for discovering and testing its ' truth,'\nand even if it should turn out that it ceases to be useful aud tenable beyond a\ncertain point, leaves it at least methodologically valuable and true for certain\npurposes. Hence it would be hard for us to exaggerate the importance of\nProfessor James' proof that the doctrine of the subliminal consciousness is\nuseful for the purpose of describing the phenomena of the religious life.\nWhich being premised, we may proceed to a more detailed consideration of\nthe points in Professor James' book which seem specially relevant to the\nwork of the S.P.R. His aim was, he tells us, an empirical inductive descrip\ntion of \" man's religious appetites,\" i.e. of the accounts given of their religious\nexperiences by a large number of (more or less) literary persons\u2014institu\ntional religious, statistics, and the sociological attitude in general beinp\nexcluded\u2014and within its limits forms an extraordinarily brilliant and\nimmensely suggestive study of its subject. Even apart from its special\nbearing on Psychical Research, I do not know what recent philosophic book\ncould be more strongly recommended to lovers of good literature.\nThe first obstacle in his path which Professor James has to clear away is\nthe objection that his whole subject is entirely morbid and pathological, and\nthat personal and intimate experiences of religious truth are merely the\nresults of neurotic diseqxiilibration. In the chapter on \"Religion and\nNeurology,\" Professor James gives some delightful specimens of this type of\nexplanation (p. 10) :\n\"Alfred believes in immortality so strongly, because his temperament is\nso emotional. Fanny's extraordinary conscientiousness is merely a matter of\nover- instigated nerves. William's melancholy about the universe is due to a\nbad digestion\u2014 probably his liver is torpid. Eliza's delight in her church is\na symptom of her hysterical constitution. Peter would be less troubled about\nhis soul if he would take more exercise in the open-air, etc. A more fully-\ndeveloped example of the same kind of reasoning is the fashion, quite com\nmon nowadays among certain writers, of criticising the religious emotions by\nshowing a connection between them and the sexual life. Conversion is a\ncrisis of puberty and adolescence. The macerations of Saints and the\n\fXLV.] Review. 405\ndevotion of missionaries are only instances of the parental instinct of self-\nsacrifice gone astray. For the hysterical nun starving for natural life Christ\nis but an imaginary substitute for a more earthly object of affection.\nMedical materialism finishes up Saint Paul by calling his vision on the road\nto Damascus a discharging lesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic.\nIt -\u2022\u2022inils out Saint Teresa as a hysteric, Saint Francis of Assisi as a\nhereditary degenerate. George Fox's discontent with the shams of his age,\nand his pining for spiritual veracity, it treats as a symptom of a disordered\ncolon. Carlyle's organ-tones of misery it accounts for by a gastro-duodenal\ncatarrh. . . . And medical materialism then thinks that the spiritual\nauthority of all such personages is successfully undermined.\"\nTo all this the reply is simple. All these methods seek to discredit the\nvalue of a thing by appealing to its origin. But though a suspicious origin\nmay render us cautious about a thing, it is after all with its value when it\nhas come about that we are really concerned. A truth discovered when the\nblood was at 103\u00b0 F. would be just as true and valuable as when it was at\n98\u00b0 F., and no one thinks of discrediting the products of the arts or the\nnatural sciences \"by showing up their authors' neurotic constitution.\"\nWhatever occasion a subject may give us to air our prejudices, the last\ncriterion always is empirical, and r^ests on the way in which a thing works as\na whole. \" By their fruits ye shall know them, not by their roots \" (p. 20).\nThe bearing of this lively discussion on the whole subject of ' psychic\npowers ' is not far to seek. For one of the chief objections of common sense\nto psychic research is the suspicious character of the personnel concerned\nwith it. Ghost-seers are emotional and imaginative persons whose stories\nneed not be believed: mediums are neuropathic to the verge of insanity, and\nwhoever believes in them is a weak-minded ' crank.' Whenever, therefore, a\nman of science or intellectual standing exhibits symptoms of interest in such\nsubjects, it is time to circulate well-constructed tales of his deplorable lapse\nfrom sanity.i\nTo all this all who are exposed to similar charges may henceforth reply in\nProfessor James' words. It may be very extensively true that the avowed\n\" psychics \" are persons whose mental (and even moral) health leaves a good\ndeal to be desired. But then the social atmosphere is at present still more\nunfavourable to the cultivation, than to the study, of psychic powers. And\nthe ignorance which envelopes the subject is still so dense that it needs\nunusual courage to take the risks which their cultivation may involve.\nHeuce those in whom psychic powers are combined with superior and well-\nbalanced minds, capable of efficient self-control, will naturally shrink from\ncultivating, or at least from divulging them. It will only be in the weaker\nminds that these phenomena will burst forth uncontrollably, and add to the\ndistrust with which such powers have always been regarded. And yet all the\ntime these powers might really be extremely valuable, and as innocuous,\nwhen properly understood and regulated, as e.g. musical gifts. And\ni With hardly an exception all the leailing members of the S.P.K. have, to my\ncertain knowledge, been subjected to this form of martyrdom.\n\f406 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART\nsecondly even if psychics had the defects of their qualities and it were true\nthat a connection between psychic temperament and insanity could be made\nout, similar to the alleged connection between genius and insanity, it might\nstill be useful and we might still ask: \"What then is more natural than\nthat this temperament should introduce one to corners of the universe,\nwhich your robust Philistine type of nervous system, forever offering its\nbiceps to be felt, thumping its breast, and thanking Heaven that it hasn't\na single morbid fibre in its composition, would be sure to hide forever from\nits self-satisfied possessors?\" (p. 25.)\nIn his chapter on the \"Reality of the Unseen\" Professor James quotes\ncases (p. 61-2) from the Journal of the S.P.R. and from Phantoms of the\nLiving to prove the reality of the immediate experience of an unseen\npresence, which appears so often to assume a specially religious form.\nInto his account of \"the religion of healthy-mindedness,\" Professor James\ninserts a very sympathetic description (which will doubtless be no end of a\nshock to many professorial pedants) of the 'mind-cure' movement, declaring\nit to be \" the one original American contribution to philosophy.\" It is, of\ncourse, diametrically opposed to science, in that it assumes that things\noperate by personal forces and for the sake of individual ends, instead of\nbeing the results of impersonal and universal formulas. Yet both appeal to\nexperience for verification. And the funny thing is that experience, in a\nmeasure, verifies both. Nor must this success of mind-cure be wet-blanketed\nby the phrase ' suggestion,' which has become merely the scientific s,lang for\n' apperceiving ' the facts. It is better to admit frankly that both are\n\" genuine keys for unlocking the world's treasure house to him who can use\neither of them practically\" (p. 122), and to hold that \"the universe is a\nmore many-sided affair than any sect, even the scientific sect, allows for.\"\nProfessor James adds in an interesting appendix a friend's case in which a\nvisit to a mental healer, in spite of his disbelief, started a turn for the better\nin a critical condition of his health. This he explains, very much like Pro\nfessor James (p. 125), as due to his \"receiving telepathically and upon a\nmental stratum quite below the level of immediate consciousness, a healthier\nand more energetic attitude, receiving it from another person whose thought\nwas directed upon me with the intention of impressing the idea of this\nattitude upon me.\" He admits that his trouble was of a nature which\nwould be classified as nervous rather than organic, but thinks that the\ndividing line is an arbitrary one, as the nerves control the whole intemal\neconomy. Hence he is on the whole \" inclined to think that the healing\naction, like the morbid one, springs from the plane of the normally uncon\nscious mind.\"\nIt is, however, when he reaches the subject of \" Conversion \" that Pro\nfessor James appeals most decisively to the ideas with which the labours of\nMyers have familiarized the readers of these Proceedings. Conversion is\nmost probably connected with the possession of a subconscious, subliminal, or\ntransmarginal self, in which the motives deposited by the experiences of life\nare incubated, and which, if very active, may even produce sudden and\n\fXLV.] Review. 407\nseemingly inexplicable changes. \" I cannot but think,\" he says (p. 233),\n\"that the most important step forward that has occurred in psychology since\nI have been a student of that science is the discovery, first made in 1886,\nthat, in certain subjects at least, there is not only the consciousness of the\nordinary field, with its usual centre and margin, but an addition thereto in\nthe shape of a set of memories, thoughts, and feelings which are extra-\nmarginal and outside of the primary consciousness altogether, but yet must\nbe classed as conscious facts of some sort, able to reveal their presence by\nunmistakable signs. I call this the most important step forward because,\nunlike the other advances which psychology has made, this discovery has\nrevealed to us an entirely unsuspected peculiarity in the constitution of\nhuman nature. No other step forward which psychology has made can\nproffer any such claim as this.\"\nFrom this subliminal region, then, proceed not only conversions, but all\nsorts of automatic \"uprushes\" or \"explosions\" of ideas elaborated outside\nthe field of ordinary consciousness, motor impulses, obsessive ideas, unaccoun\ntable caprices, delusions, and hallucinations of hypnotic or hysterical subjects.\nThe religious cases must in the first instance submit to formal psychological\nclassification along with these\u2014as indeed the religious admit, after their\nfashion, when they dispute as to the divine or diabolical origin of these\nphenomena. This classification, however, leaves untouched their value, and\nthe question of the ultimate origin of the beneficial influences. It is con\nceivable (p. 242) that \" if there be higher spiritual agencies that can directly\ntouch us, the psychological condition of their doing so might be our possession\nof a subconscious region which alone should yield access to them. The\nhubbub of the waking life might close a door which in the dreamy Sub\nliminal might remain ajar or open.\"\nThe \" mystical \" consciousness is all too familiar to ordinary men as an\neffect of chemicals, the sway of alcohol over mankind being \" unquestionably\ndue to its power to stimulate the mystical faculties of human nature\"\n(p. 387). Thus \" the drunken consciousness is one bit of the mystic\nconsciousness,\" which, however, is still more powerfully stimulated by\nnitrous oxide. Its key-note is invariably a reconciliation in which all the\nopposites in the world are melted into unity in such a way that the higher\nand better species appears as itself the genus. The theoretic importance of\nthese mystic states is (p. 423) that \" they break down the authority of the\nnon-mystical or rationalistic consciousness baaed upon the understanding and\nthe senses alone. They show it to be only one kind of consciousness. They\nopen out the possibility of other orders of truth.\" And yet religious\nmysticism is only the better half of the subject. Side by side with it we\nmay find in delusional insanity or paranoia a sort of diabolical mysticism,\nexhibiting the same psychological symptoms, but with a pessimistic trend,\nand also springing \" from that great subliminal or transmarginal region of\nwhich science is beginning to admit the existence, but of which so little is\nreally known \" (p. 426).\nIn his last lecture Professor James finally inquires into the objective truth\n\f408 F. C. S. Schiller. [I-ART\nunderlying all this religious experience and returns to the question, reserved\nbefore, as to the ultimate source of the subliminal inspiration and of the\nimmediate assurance it seems to give of a communion with diviner powers\nwhich effect our salvation. In the last resort the whole of religious\nexperience seems to rest on \" the fact that the conscious person is continuous\nwith a wider self, through which saving experiences come \" (p. 515), and\nthis \" is literally and objectively true as far as it goes.\"\nBeyond this common result of all religions we pass into the realm\nof hypotheses and \" over-beliefs,\" as to which Professor James is laudably\nreluctant to dogmatize. But he personally believes that the infiltration of\nspiritual energy which the religious seem to experience is no merely\nsubjective illusion, but a real fact. For notwithstanding the studied\nimpersonalism of our scientific assumptions, it is only in our personal\nlife that we comprehend real fact and transcend abstractions. If therefore\nthe abstract point of view of Science be naturalism, then Professor\nJames is a supernaturalist.\nBut supernaturalism is of two kinds, refined and universalistic, or crass\nand \" piece-meal.\" The former, which has been excogitated by mauy of the\ntranscendentalist theologians and philosophers of the day, repudiates, not\nmerely miracle, but every action of the supernatural on the natural.\nNothing is altered in the natural course of events by the existence of its\n\" God \" or \" Absolute.\" Its \"God \" neither answers prayers, nor helps men,\nnor aims at ends, nor gives ground for moral hope. He is simply a paint of\nview\u2014the point of view of the Whole\u2014and beyond affording a peculiar satis\nfaction to those who like to take that point of view, he makes not the\nslightest difference to anybody or anything. This universalistic super-\nuaturalism, however, Professor James thinks, is practically a surrender to\nnaturalism. We can have no use for a \"God\" who makes no difference :\n\"our difficulties and our ideals are all piece-meal affairs, but the Absolute\ncan do no piecework for us ; so that all the interests which our poor souls\ncompass raise their heads too late\" (p. 522). Hence Professor James\npleads for \" a candid consideration of piece-meal supernaturalism \" and\nbelieves that \"a complete discussion of all its metaphysical bearings will\nshow it to be the hypothesis by which the largest number of legitimate\nrequirements are met\" (p. 523).\nA real God, therefore, must produce real effects, and so in our cominunings\nwith the wider self \" work is actually done upon our finite personality ; for\nwe are turned into new men, and consequences in the way of conduct follow\nin the natural world upon our regenerative change. But that which\nproduces effects within another reality must be termed a reality itself, so I\nfeel as if we had no philosophic excuse for calling the unseen or mystical\nworld unreal\" (p. 516).\nTo identify this real power with an absolute world-ruler is, however, a\nvery considerable over-belief. All that religious experience unequivocally\ntestifies to is that there is something larger tliau our conscious selves,\ncontinuous with us and friendly to our ideals. \" Any thing larger will do,\n\fXLV.] Review. 409\nif only it be large enough to truat for the next step. It need not be infinite,\nit need not be solitary. It might conceivably even be only a larger and\nmore godlike self, of which the present self would then be but the mutilated\nexpression, and the universe might conceivably be a collection of such selves,\nof different degrees of inclusiveness, with no absolute unity realized in\nit at all \" (p. 525).\nProfessor James concludes with a promise to work out these hints of a\npluralistic metaphysic in a subsequent book, which will doubtless prove as\ninstructive as the present. Meanwhile we may add a few admiring\ncomments to this theory of the cardinal importance for religion of sub\nconscious inspiration. And first of all attention should be drawn to a slight\nchange of terminology. Professor James often prefers the term trans-\nmarginal to subliminal. The reason is clear : the preposition sub- becomes\nawkward when applied to what is envisaged as a source of higher inspiratiou.\nIt is better not to seem to beg questions by denominating it what lies\nacross (trans) the border. Perhaps as a compromise the term transliminal\nmight be found convenient.\nIn the second place I find myself, with all deference, unable altogether to\nfollow Professor James in his appreciation of the mystical states of\nconsciousness. At least I should contend strongly that whether arrived at\nby rational means or not, all the products of our mental life should be\nsubjected to rational tests, and rejected if they turn out to be essentially\nirrational and unprofitable. Now, on Professor James' own showing, this\nobjection applies strongly to almost all the mystical experiences. In\npoint of psychological form their nearest congeners are to be found in\ndrunkenness and insanity. As regards psychological content they are quite\nunstable and insecure. Even though for the moment the mystic's assurance\nmay seem ineffably to surpass the confidence to be attained by the slow\nmethods of ordinary reasoning, yet it is subject to eclipses as sudden and\ninexplicable as the effulgences with which it dazzled the soul. Professor\nJames must surely have come across some of the cases (of which the poet\nCowper is a well-known literary example) in which the conviction of being\n\" damned \" alternated with that of being \" saved,\" or where the experience\nof mystical visions did not preclude a subsequent lapse into agnosticism and\ndisbelief.i For these reasons to a critically-minded mystic the question of the\ncognitive value of his psychical experiences must be a great puzzle, and\na fortiori they must seem dubious to non-mystics. Regarded logically their\nrevelations are pervaded by hopeless contradictions, as when the highest\nknowledge is described as the negation of knowledge, and the highest\nconsciousness as the extinction of self-consciousness (cp. p. 401). And\nProfessor James' generosity surely reaches an extreme when he quotes\na dreary farrago of absolute nonsense to show that \"many mystical\nscriptures are indeed little more than musical compositions\" (p. 421).\nMetaphysically again mysticism seems to point in the wrong direction.\ni The answers to the Questionnaire of the American Branch contain several such\ndocuments.\n\f410 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART\nProfessor James admits that the theoretic drift of \"classical religious\nmysticism is in the direction of an enervating pantheistic monism and a\npeculiarly flabby optimism.\" Both of these doctrines I agree with Professor\nJames in regarding as false, and both could be substantiated, if at all, only\nby rigorously rational demonstration. The mystics content themselves with\naffirming them on grounds so unintelligible that they can only add contempt\nto the dislike for them one had previously entertained. Finally, from\na practical and moral point of view, the fruits of mysticism seem to be\nmainly evil. It seems to be an even chance that the 'religious' mystic will\nset himself wholly above morality ; and even if he does not in this respect\nimitate his alcohol-imbibing and drug-inhaling confreres, his ecstasies\nproduce nothing of value for practical life. Judged, therefore, by the\n\u2022' pragmatist \" standards of Professor James, mysticism, wherever it crops\nup, in Hinduism, in Buddhism, in Neoplatonism, in Catholicism, in Whit-\nmania, must be pronounced worthless as such and devoid of rational\nauthority over us. Even the theoretic gain of mysticism, viz. the knowledge\nthat the ordinary consciousness does not exhaust the whole of experience,\nmay be obtained more simply from the facts of dream, trance, etc. The\nimportant question as to all such states is not as to their existence, but as to\ntheir practical value and rational significance.\nLastly as regards the value of the \" transmarginal self \" for the purpose of\npsychological explanation. \/ cannot see that, apart from psychical research,\nit has any. If it merely meant negatively that the mainsprings of our\nmental life were not to be found in consciousness, and implied that every\nthing beyond was unknowable, it would not advance science. It would\nmerely add one to the technical phrases whereby baffled philosophers and\ntheologians have tried to gloze over their failures to satisfy our demands for\nknowledge. And it would deserve to be cast on the metaphysical rubbish-\nheap together with the ' Unknowablet' and 'Abtoluiet ' of other ' thinkers.' But\nProfessor James clearly means his \"transmarginal\" to be something more,\nto be afield for scientific research (p. 611), in which our Society would have\na prescriptive claim to a prominent part. What the transmarginal really is\nis what we have to find out. And just in proportion as our research is\nsuccessful, it is evident that what was beyond the margin will be included\nin it, that the soul will extend her borders, and that our whole consciousness\nwill be augmented and glorified by the assimilation of what is now\n\" subconscious.\"\nThe practical value of Professor James' confession of faith in the reality\nof our spiritual intercourse with higher powers I take to be very similar.\nRegarded as a mere personal 'over-belief it is of course psychologically\ninteresting, but its logical value is slight. The true import of the doctrine\nhowever lies in the suggestion it conveys that such personal religious\nexperiences are not insusceptible of scientific treatment. They are now\ndeclared to be worthy of scientific attention, and through them the light of\npsychology may find access to the preserves of theological dogma. By\nturning so much of a theologian Professor James may prevail on theologians\n\fXLV.] Review. 411\nto turn psychologists. And so in the end it may come about that, as I once\nsuggested with reference to a similar plea of Mr. Andrew Lang's, theology\nwill be rendered an experimental science, and as auch recover the hold over\nthe human mind which it now appears to have lost.\nIn taking leave of Professor James' fascinating lectures I must remark on\nwhat will seem to many a very curious fact, viz., the almost total omission\nof the topic of immortality from a description of religious feelings. Professor\nJames' record as a psychical researcher and lecturer on Human Immortality\nis too well known to allow one to put this down to prejudice or aversion. To\nme it seems rather like an unsolicited confirmation of the view that\nimmortality, whatever it may have been in the past, is not now an important\nobject of desire. However, as I am at present engaged in a statistical\ninquiry into the real character and extent of this traditional craving, I can\nconfine my remarks to the little Professor James does say in his Postscript.\nHaving spoken of the necessity that a real God must make a difference, he\ngoes on to say (p. 524) that the first difference such a God should make would\nbe personal immortality. But it seems to him a point secondary to an\neternal caring for our ideals. It is however \" eminently a case for facts to\ntestify. Facts, I think, are yet lacking to prove ' spirit-return,' though I\nhave the highest respect for the patient labours of Messrs. Myers, Hodgson,\nand Hyslop, and am somewhat impressed by their favourable conclusions.\"\nThis interesting pronouncement of so great and sympathetic an authority\nindicates perhaps how far calmly dispassionate science is disposed to go in\nthe present state of the evidence ; and though it may seem but little to the\nmore sanguine, I would bid them remember (1) that Professor James has\nhimself explained how a \" will to believe \" is justified in cases of this sort,\nand how faith may legitimately outstrip knowledge, provided always that\n\" faith \" leads to \" works\" which confirm it ; and (2) that proof is essentially\ncumulative, and that comparatively little more of the sort of evidence\nwe have already succeeded in getting recorded might complete the proof\nsufficiently to shift the ' burden of proof ' on to those who as yet will to\ndisbelieve. There is plenty of scope, therefore, for energetic exertion both\nin improving the evidence and in disposing the social atmosphere more\nfavourably towards its investigation.\nF. C. S.

Maeterlinck knocks down \" the Gods \" (as he calls them) only to set up\nin their stead the subconscious self, which he endows with almost divine\nattributes. It is the veritable Ego, pre-existent, universal, and \" probably\nimmortal.\" (We like the \"probably.\") It inhabits another plane of exist\nence, where Time and Space are not. For it there is no far or near, neither\npast nor future, nor resistance of matter. It is omniscient and omnipotent ;\nand it may not be too much, perhaps, to speak of its active principle as\nthe essential fluid, the ultra-violet rays of Life. Yet, although it is\nprobably the common possession of all men, it does not speak to the\nintelligent or normal consciousness of all either with equal clearness or\nfrequency.\nBut what has this subconscious self to do with, or how can it be held\nresponsible for, the good or bad luck that may attend a human life ? M.\nMaeterlinck answers the question in this way : \" An event, propitious or\ndisastrous, proceeding from the depths of the great eternal laws, rises up on\nour path and bars it completely. There it looms, immovable, fatal, unshak\nable. With us it has no concern, it is not there for us. Its raison <f(tre is\nin itself and for itself alone. Us it simply does not know. It is we who\ndraw near it, we who, once within the range of its influence, must flee from\nit or face it, circumvent or cross it. I will suppose it to be an unlucky event :\na shipwreck, a fire, a thunderbolt, or death, disease, accident, or suffering in\na somewhat unusual form. It waits, invisible, blind, indifferent, a thing\ncomplete, unchangeable, but as yet potential. It exists in its entirety, but\nonly in the future ; while for us, whose senses adapted to the service of our\nintelligence and our consciousness are so made that they perceive things only\nsuccessively in time, it is still as though it did not exist.\n\" For the sake of greater precision, let us imagine the event in question to\nbe a shipwreck. The ship that needs must be lost has not yet left port ; the\nrock or the wreckage that will split her in twain is sleeping peacefully\nbeneath the waves ; or the storm, that will not break before the month is\nout, slumbers beyond our ken in the hidden places of the heavens. Nor\n\fXLV.] Review. 413\nmally, if the fiat had not gone forth, and if the catastrophe had not already\ntaken place in the future, fifty passengera come from five or six different\ncountries would have embarked. But the ship bears clearly on her the\nbrand of fate. Perish she certainly must. And so, for months, perhaps for\nyears before, a mysterious selection has been at work among the travellers\nwho ought otherwise to have started together on the same day. Possibly\nout of the original fifty twenty only embark when the time comes to weigh\nanchor. Perhaps not even a single one of the fifty obeys the call of circum\nstances which would have necessitated his departure had the future disaster\nnot been in existence, and, may be, their places have been taken by twenty\nor thirty others in whom the voice of chance does not speak with the same\nstrength. But with this imaginary case before us\u2014which is merely a more\nstriking illustration of what is constantly happening within the narrower\nrange of every-day life\u2014is it not more natural to suppose, instead of having\nrecourse to far-off shadowy gods, that it is our subconscious self which acts\nand decides ? It knows, it must know, it must see the catastrophe, for\nneither Time nor Space exists for it, and the catastrophe is taking place at\nthe very moment beneath its eyes, even as it is taking place beneath the\neyes of the Eternal Forces. How it gives forewarning of the coming evil\nmatters little. Out of thirty travellers who receive warning, two or three\nwill have had an actual presentiment of the danger ; these are they in whom\nthe subconsciousness has freer play, and reaches more readily the primary\nstrata, obscure though they be, of the intelligent consciousness. The rest will\nhave no misgivings, they will rail at inexplicable delays and obstacles, they\nwill do their utmost to arrive in time, but start they will not. Some of\nthem will fall ill, miss their way, change their plans, meet with some trivial\nadventure, or a quarrel, a flirtation, a lazy or an absent-minded fit will\ndetain them in spite of themselves. Others of them, again, will never have\ndreamed of embarking on the predestined ship, although logically and fatally\nshe was the only one that they ought to have chosen.\n\" In the case of the majority, these efforts of the subconsciousness to save\nthem are carried out at depths so great that it will never occur to them that\nthey owe their life to their good luck, and they will believe in all good faith\nthat they never had any intention of boarding the vessel that the Powers of\nthe Sea had marked for their own.\"\nAs for the unlucky, they must not imagine that the universe is hostile to\nthem, but rather they should blame their own subconscious selves. \" Their\nunconscious soul,\" says Maeterlinck, \" their unconscious soul does not do its\nduty.\" And he goes on to ask : \" Is it (i.e. the inefficient subconsciousness)\nmore awkward or less attentive ? Does it sleep in despair in the depths of a\nprison more closely barred than others ? Can no act of will stir it from so\ndeadly a slumber?\" Apparently, in M. Maeterlinck's opinion, the case is\nnot hopeless. Either the supraliminal consciousness (which answers to what\nthe author calls \"la vie intelligente,\" or \"la volonU et Vintelligence \") develops\na sufficient receptivity, or the subconsciousness a sufficient attentiveness to\nthe needs of its junior partner. To sum up, then, good luck depends upon an\n\f414 J. G. Piddington. [PABT\neffective, bad luck on a defective intercommunication between the conscious\nand the subconscious strata.\nThe reception which this bold and novel theory is likely to meet with from\northodox philosophy can hardly be favourable ; but students of the S.P.R.\nProceedings and Journal, and those especially who have felt the force of\nMr. Myers' papers on the subliminal consciousness will not be too ready\nto dismiss it offhand as pure mysticism. In any case it is only possible\nto do justice to M. Maeterlinck's conception if we consider it apart from\nhis ill-chosen illustrations of shipwrecks, railway accidents, fires, etc., and\nindeed apart from all disasters which may depend, in part at least, on\nhuman agency ; and if we apply it to the cases of such calamities only\nas may be regarded as practically unaffected by man's intervention, e.g. a\nvolcanic eruption. In cases of the latter class it is logically conceivable\nthat the subliminal self may act, in some such way as he suggests, by\nsimply preventing the person from getting within rauge of any particular\nnatural catastrophe. Any supposed power of prevision, however, implies\nthat the future is already fixed and is not to be influenced by human\nwill. Hence the theory is self-contradictory, if applied to cases where\nthe thing to be avoided may be either caused or modified through volun\ntary human action.\nBut apart from this fundamental confusion of thought, which\u2014as will\nbe seen from the extracts quoted\u2014pervades the whole argument, it is\nchiefly when we come to consider the way in which the case is presented,\nand the exaggerated claims put forward on behalf of the subconscious\nself that we psychical researchers, with our prejudice for plain well-\nattested facts, are likely to part company with M. Maeterlinck. On what\ngrounds of fact he relies, if indeed he pretends to proffer any facts at\nall, it is not easy to say. He would seem to have evolved his doctrine\nout of his own inner consciousness, unhampered by any details of evidence,\nand then to have thrown in a few generalized facts as an after-thought.\nHe quotes no authorities ; he makes no acknowledgment of the labours\nof those who have ploddingly explored the psychological fields in which\nhe himself runs riot. It is true that he cites the experiences of a friend,\nbut they are vague and unconvincing ; and in a foot-note to p. 261 he\nmakes some remarkable statements, which, if true, would indeed lend\nstrong support to his conclusions, but unfortunately there is no reason\nto attach any credibility to these statements. It is worth while to trans\nlate almost in full this foot-note, because it contains practically the only\nattempt at positive evidence in support of the previsionary and premoni\ntory powers with which M. Maeterlinck endows \"the unconscious soul.\"\nThe note runs thus : \" It is indeed a common occurrence and worthy of\nnote that in the case of great catastrophes the number of victims is\nusually infinitely smaller than on the most reasonable calculation of pro\nbabilities one would have been led to apprehend. At the last minute a\nfortuitous and exceptional circumstance has almost always kept away\nhalf and sometimes two-thirds of the people menaced by the as yet in\n\fXLV.] Review. 415\nvisible danger. A steamer which founders has generally many fewer\npassengers on board than she would have had had she not been doomed\nto sink. Two trains that run into collision, an express which falls over\na precipice, and so on, carry fewer passengers than on days when nothing\nhappens to them. The collapse of a bridge most frequently occurs, quite\ncontrary to what one would expect, just after the crowd has left it.\nUnfortunately there is not the same immunity in the case of fires in\ntheatres and other places of public assembly. But here, as we know, it\nis not the fire, but rather the presence of an affrighted and maddened\ncrowd which constitutes the chief danger. On the other hand, an ex\nplosion of fire-damp takes place as a rule when there are considerably\nfewer miners at work in the mine than there ought to be in the regular\ncourse. In the same way a powder or a cartridge factory, etc., generally\nexplodes at a time when the majority of the workmen, who otherwise\nwould have inevitably perished, have gone away from the works for\nsome trifling, though providential, reason or other. So true is this fact\nthat the almost constant observation of it has resulted in a sort of familiar\nstock phrase. Any <lay we may read in the newspapers under the items\nof general news sentences like this : ' A catastrophe which might have\nhad terrible consequences, thanks to such and such a circumstance was\nhappily confined to ... etc.' Or, again : ' One shudders to think that,\nhad the same accident happened a minute sooner, when all the workmen,\nor all the passengers, . . . etc.' \"\nOn this flimsy foundation of newspaper snippets M. Maeterlinck would\nseem to have built his theoretic edifice. The futility of the examples\nquoted in this foot-note is really too obvious to be worth exposing.\nCertainly, if one troubled oneself as little as the author to produce sub\nstantial evidence, or made as little allowance for mere coincidence, it\nwould not be difficult to make out a case for the existence of a malevolent\ndeity, whose special function was to cause ships and trains to be wrecked,\nboilers to burst, theatres to burn at moments^which promised the largest\nhaul of human victims. Had M. Maeterlinck deigned to consult any\nthing so prosaic as the railway annals of his own country, he would have\nfound in the extraordinary frequency of accidents to trains crammed with\nholiday folk on Belgian jours de fete some facts which will not square with\nhis fancies. Our own researches do seem to point to the possible exemption\nof the subconscious self from spatial limitations, but so far they have\ncontributed little towards rendering probable this larger claim of freedom\nfrom the limitations of time which M. Maeterlinck unhesitatingly makes\nfor it ; and before such a claim can be considered, better evidence must\nbe forthcoming than the vague statements of this naive foot-note\u2014state\nments which could be verified or refuted only by means of a world-wide\nand utterly impracticable census extending over many years.\nBut not content with the paucity and poverty of the positive evidence\nat his disposal, M. Maeterlinck, in the last chapter of the book, L'Avenir,\nis candid enough to produce evidence which, so far as it goes, is un\n\f416 J. G. Piddington.

And this, so far as it\ngoes, is in accordance with the results at present arrived at by the S.P.R.\nOf all the evidence in favour of supernormal faculties hitherto collected\nby the Society, the weakest by far both in quantity and quality is the\nevidence for prevision.\nThis failure to bring forward any original or borrowed evidence of\nvalue is all the more disappointing in the author of La Vie des Abcilles, who\nin that delightful work displayed not only a gift for original scientific\nresearch, but also the power of appreciating and marshalling the scientific\nobservations of others.\nTo this criticism, if he chanced to read it, the author might perhaps\nreply in the words of Symmachus, \"wno itinere nan potett perveniri ad\ntarn grande secreium,\" and that there are methods other than those of the\nS.P.R. for arriving at the truth. True enough : but what is objection\nable is the attempt to combine two methods, the intuitive-mystic with\nthe scientific. M.

Such, however, as like to wander along the by-paths of history,\nand such as appreciate the merit of a scrupulously document^ revival of\nsome obscure episode of past days, will be well repaid if they consult\nthe full narrative.\nM. de Coynart's treatment is primarily historical, and only secondarily\nand incidentally psychological : yet the adventures of Marie-Anne and her\nfriends afford points of psychological interest deserving of our attention.\nIn order to appreciate them, it will be necessary to give a summary\u2014the\nbarest possible, be it understood\u2014of the events recorded by the author.\nMarie-Anne de la Ville, born at Bordeaux in 1680, was the daughter\nof a local lawyer of some social position but of little or no fortune.\nHer mother died when she was eighteen mouths old, ami this early loss\nwas perhaps responsible for her subsequent depravity. When only nine\nyears old, she discovered in an uncle's library several occult books,\nfrom which she learned the traditional forms of incantation, and many\nother things not calculated to have the best effect on the brain of an\nimaginative child. Of a good spirit named Jassemin, who figured in\none of these mystic works, she had a hallucinatory vision ; and -that the\nhallucination was genuine she always maintained, nor need her word\nbe doubted on this point. At eleven years of age she was sent to the\nConvent of the Visitation du faubourg Saint-Antoine at Paris, where\nfor eight years she remained. Here she probably came into contact with\nMme. Guyon, the Quietist, and to this supposed association M. de Coynart\nattributes in part her later developments ; but the inference seems rather\nunfair to the worthy Mme. Guyon, and Marie-Anne's early acquaintance\nwith occultism sufficiently explains the attraction which the subject\nhad for her in her maturer years.\nWhat happened to her after leaving the convent is not precisely known,\nbut she seems to have been at large in Paris, and what that meant in\nthe 18th century is better imagined than described. When next she\nis heard of, she had joined a band of treasure-seekers, which, though led\nby an inferior police-officer named Divot, was composed of members\ndrawn from a mixture of social classes from nearly the highest to nearly\nthe lowest. One of the most important, by reason of his sacred calling,\nwas a Prior, by name Pinel ; the presence and offices of a priest being\nheld indispensable to the successful raising of the devil. Marie-Anue\nsoon became the mistress of the Prior, and, but for short intervals when\nher more than easy morals led her to seek a change, remained so during\nthe three years of adventure which followed ; but it is only fair to the\nPrior to add that the liaison was none of his seeking, and that far from\nbeing in collusion with Marie-Anne, he was utterly her dupe, and further\n\f418 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nmore her stauuchest friend,\u2014 a most pathetic figure, more worthy of pity\nthan of condemnation or contempt.\nThe band had been in existence some seven or eight years before Marie-\nAnne joined it, and in spite of the unbroken failure of its operations,\nthe ardour of its members had not been damped, nor had hopes of ultimate\nsuccess been abandoned. The belief was then, as in past centuries, largely\nprevalent among all ranks of society that not only the natural virgin\ntreasure of the earth but also treasure left hidden by man was guarded\nby demons : and the aim of the band of treasure-seekers was to conjure the\ndemon guardians to deliver up their hoards either simply in obedience\nto irresistible incantations, or in exchange for human souls. Marie-Anne\nsoon became the leader of the company and the prime mover in their\nexpeditious, because she claimed knowledge of the traditional incantations\nand modus operandi, in which the other members were admittedly not\nadepts.\nIt would be outside the scope of this review to narrate the various\nand fruitless expeditions undertaken by the company at Marie-Anne's\ninstigation, or to describe in detail how in face of repeated insuccess she\nmanaged to retain the confidence and support of her companions, how\nshe literally worked the oracle to provide herself with creature-comforts\nat the expense of her associates and particularly of the Prior (ruined\nfinancially as well as morally by his infatuation), how she varied the\nmonotony of treasure-hunting with interludes of spirit communications\nand simple physical phenomena, and how, in short, she ran through an\nextensive repertoire of mediumistic tricks and humbugged the whole party\nconsistently and successfully for a period of three years. The curious\nreader must be referred to the book itself, where the story is told fully\nand attractively, with great lucidity and some humour.\nThree points, however, merit a longer reference : (a) Some instances of\nillusion and hallucination. Four members of the baud together with\nMarie-Anne were engaged on a treasure-hunt at D'Arcueil. While Marie-\nAnne was (or was supposed to be) performing her lengthy incantations,\nthe others by way of passing the time until her return from the scene\nof operations were dining in a neighbouring inn. Two hours passed,\nand the four diners, wondering at the delay, set out to see how the\nsorceress was progressing ; when, to quote the official record of the Prior\nPinel's evidence before M. d'Argenson, they saw \" a man on horseback,\nenveloped in a red cloak (although the weather was very fine). He was\nabout half a league distant from the said Marie-Anne, but when the\nPrior and the others drew a little nearer to her, they were surprised to\nsee the horseman by the side of her, although a moment before he had\nbeen very far away from her. This threw them into such a state of\nastonishment that they lay on the ground in order not to see him, being\nconvinced that the horseman was the Spirit, who was going to maltreat\nher because they had had the ^temerity to watch her in spite of her\nhaving forbidden them to do so.\" Marie-Anne must have witnessed her\n\fXLV.] Review. 419\ncompanions' fright, and guessed the cause of it : for when she rejoined\nthem her face and head were \" covered with bruises,\" and her head-dress\nwas gone. Of course the Evil Spirit had thus wreaked his wrath on her\nbecause the others had \" broken the conditions \" (to use a modern phrase),\nand of course the horseman in the red cloak was none other than the\nEvil Spirit himself. Another member of the party, M. de Brederodes,\ngives a highly coloured account of the same scene, but the relatively sober\nnarrative of the Prior probably comes nearer to representing the mean\nhallucinatory experience as shared by the four percipients.\nNow, in her examination before M. d'Argenson, Marie-Anne declared\nthat no such horseman had come near her. A real horseman there may\nwell have been, who was seen in the distance by the others and not by\nMarie-Anne, but her sharp eyes would not have failed to notice him had he\nreally come near her. And as there was nothing to be lost or gained by\ndenying the story of her comrades, Marie-Anne's version is more easily\naccepted than the miraculously rapid movements of the mysterious man\non horseback.\nOn another occasion at Arcueil Marie-Anne had made her companions\nstand in a line with their noses turned to a wall, while she with a lighted\nwax-taper in her hand was going through her usual performances. The\nincantations finished, she caught hold of a branch of an overhanging tree,\nand shook it with all her might in order to extinguish the taper. Her\ndupes described this incident to M. d'Argenson as follows : \" A great\nblast of wind, extraordinary for so calm a night, suddenly arose and\nshook the branches and put out Marie-Anne's taper.\"\nOnce the Prior believed he had heard the Spirit prescribe certain\nremedies for Marie-Anne, whereas Marie-Anne stated to M. d'Argenson\nthat she had merely asked for the remedies \"sans contrefaire sa voix\"\nAnother time Pinel and the others said they had seen the Spirit in\nthe guise of a tall man. Marie-Anne, however, when this episode was\ntouched on in her cross-examination declared that she had seen nothing.\nIt must not be supposed that these four instances exhaust the list, for\nthere were plenty more. The followers of Marie-Anne lived in an atmos\nphere of hallucination ; and so strained was their state of expectancy,\nthat any trivial incident might at any moment be translated by their\nfancy into a miraculous event.\n(6) The uncritical attitude of the band.\nNo member of the regular band, nor any of the outsiders who occasionally\nwitnessed Marie-Anne's performances suspected her bona fides, two un\nimportant exceptions apart,\u2014unimportant because, although one individual,\na novice, said he thought the whole thing was a trick, and another,\nequally new to the phenomena, mildly suggested that the Spirit's voice\nwas only Marie-Anne's disguised,\u2014both very soon convinced themselves\nof the genuineness of the sorceress' powers. This almost complete absence\nof suspicion was due, no doubt, in part to Mlle, de la Villa's cleverness ;\nbut unless we remember to transport ourselves back into an age when\n\f420 J. G. Piddington. [PART\nbelief in magic yet widely obtained, we shall be in danger of unduly\nexaggerating her powers of deception.\nNowadays people do not believe in the supernatural without, at least,\nfirst obtaining some evidential facts (or what they consider to be such)\nin order to dispel their a priori scepticism. But to the a priori credulity\nof Marie-Anne's times such cautious preliminaries would have seemed\nuncalled for, and to have questioned the reality of the interference of\nevil spirits in human affairs would have appeared almost as ridiculous,\nat least to the average man, as it would have not so many years earlier\nto doubt that the sun moved round the earth.\n(c) The examination and confession of Marie-Anne.\nDivot turned informer, with the result that Marie-Anne was arrested\nin February, 1703. At the time of her arrest she was found to have\n\" une esptce de tifflet \" in her throat. Thanks to malingering, which quite\ntook in the young officer sent to convey her to Paris, it was not until\nAugust that she was lodged in the Bastille : whither she had been pre\nceded by seventeen of her accomplices, or rather dupes.\nThe enquiry was conducted by the celebrated M. d'Argenson in person,\nand lasted nearly four months. All the prisoners, except M. de Bredero'les,\nwere found guilty and were severely punished : Marie-Anne, the chief\nculprit, being sentenced to imprisonment for life and to a perpetual diet\nof bread and water. She was imprisoned in the Hfrpital, now called\nthe Salptitriere ; and it is permissible to fancy that had she flourished in\na happier hour, she might have figured among a crowd of sister de'traqueet\nas a patient, instead of as a prisoner, within the self-same walls.\nShould any reader in the course of perusing the veracious history of\nMarie- Anne de la Ville suspect that M. de Coynart has painted his\nheroine with too black a brush, and that amidst all the admitted fraud\nthere may have been glimmerings of genuine psychic power, his hopes\nof a possible partial rehabilitation of the sorceress' character will be\nrudely dashed when he reaches the last chapter but one, which deals\nwith her examination before M. d'Argeuson. Her avowal of fraud was\ncomplete : and such reservations as she did attempt to make were con\ncerned not with her pretended magic but with her relations with the\nPrior Pinel. The woman in her was still capable of a sense of shame,\nif the charlatan was not.\nThe chief interest of her examination lies in the answers, in which\nare directly stated, or from which can be inferred, the motives of her\nfraud. They may be summarised as follows :\n(1) She honestly believed, at least at first, in her magical incantations ;\nand if towards the end of three years she did lose, or began to lose, faith\nin them, the general tone of her replies to M. d'Argenson's questions seems\nto imply that it was only in the efficacy of the particular incantations\nto which her acquaintance happened to be limited, and not in the general\npossibility of summoning and gaiuiug ascendancy over evil spirits, that\nshe had lost confidence.\n\fXLV.] Review. 421\n(2) She believed iu the truth of the stories of buried treasures.\n(3) She resolutely maintained her conviction that the apparition of the\nangel Jassemin, which she had experienced in childhood, was \" a real thing.\"\n(4) She admitted that she had often pretended to call up and converse\nwith the spirit merely to please (satisfaire) her companions.\n(5) She denied that money was her object, and declared that she fre\nquently went through her tricks for the mere fun of laughing in her\nsleeve at the credulity of her followers.\nMr. H. G. Wells has made the pleasure of gulling the credulous the\ndominant note in the character of the fraudulent medium that he has\nportrayed in his Love and Mr. Leurisham. But for such a motive to be\nmore than fitfully operative demands the possession by the charlatan of a\nlarger degree of intelligent cynicism than would seem to have been con\nsistent with the unthinking Bohemianism of Mlle, de la Ville. It was\none among several motives, no doubt, as perhaps it may be in the case\nof all charlatans, but it was not the dominant one.\nLove of money, in spite of her denial, was certainly an incentive, though\nnot, perhaps, one of the strongest ; for Mlle, de la Ville could easily have\nturned her wits and her looks to more profitable account than to duping\nan impecunious Prior, and it was only rarely that a well-to-do person\njoined the band, and then but for a short time. In so far as she had\nhoped at first to possess herself of treasure by magic arts, money was her\nobject ; but, in spite of one or two shady episodes, she must be acquitted\nof having primarily aimed at extracting money from her companions.\nIt is easy enough to conjecture other motives besides those which\nMarie-Anne admitted, but I believe that the essential motive lay in her\nown credulity. If she had not originally believed that spirits of evil\ncould be evoked from the nether world and subdued by magical rites,\nher career might not indeed have proved less criminal, but it would not\nhave taken the particular direction which it did.\nWe are usually content to assume that the practice of fraudulent\nmediumship is due to a love of money, or of notoriety, or of deception,\nbut we might do well to add another motive to the list, namely, the\nbelief, or at least the expectation, held by a medium at the outset of his\ncareer, that if he perform the necessary ceremonies and follow the recog\nnised procedure, supernormal phenomena will follow in due course.\nSome lines from the introductory chapter may serve to conclude this\nreview of M. de Coynart's book : \" Dealing though it does for the most\npart with very obscure individuals, this history shows to what depths of\ncredulity persons of all ranks and not wanting in intelligence can descend.\nThough this truth will be borne out by a narrative based throughout on\nauthentic documents, it evidently does not follow that all marvels can\ntherefore be explained away. But, at least, this history will demonstrate\nwhat great precautions we must all of us take to protect ourselves from\nthe workings of our own imagination or from the suggestions of others.\"\nJ. G.

For\ninstance, a girl aged 25 who was obsessed by the thought that she must\nthrow herself out of the window, explained when hypnotised that the\nidea arose from her having seen such an accident portrayed in an\nillustrated paper, though she had no memory of it in her waking state.\nRecognition of the cause enabled Dr. Farez to cure the obsession by\ncounter-suggestion. He tells a somewhat disconcerting story of a dramatic\nauthor who allowed himself to be frequently hypnotised by his wife,\nwho at last was able to throw him into profound hypnosis by touching\nthe nape of his neck, and to change his ordinary sleep into hypnotic\ntrance. She made use of this power to dictate his conduct to him. For\ninstance, on one occasion M. X. found himself unable to walk up the\nstairs leading to a friend's rooms, and thought that he was becoming\nparalysed. In alarm he went to Dr. Farez, who hypnotised him and\ndiscovered that the wife had out of jealousy suggested the physical\ninability to visit the friend she objected to. If Mme. X. had goue\na little further and suggested to her husband that no one but herself\ncould hypnotise him, it would have been difficult to overcome her undue\ninfluence.\nDr. RCgnault endeavours to explain by the light of the most recent\ndiscoveries in psychology and neurology how hypnosis assists the action\nof suggestion. He argues that in the waking state a sensation sets up a\ncentripetal nerve current which excites corresponding psychic cells in the\nbrain cortex, and these he terms \"centres of sentiment.\" These centres\nrepresent sentiments and ideas, and transmit the impulses to the motor\n\fXLV.] Review. 423\nneurons. It is the neuron which vibrates the most which induces the\nresponsive action.\nIn profound hypnosis, Dr. Regnault thinks, the suggested sensation\nacts so powerfully on the psychic cell or centre of sentiment that only\none idea is aroused and, therefore, free choice in conduct is prevented.\nThis is only another way of expressing Bernheim's contention that\nhypnotism enables the operator to stimulate or suppress a function by\nacting on its cerebral centre through the suggested idea.\nSeveral physicians including Tokarsky of Moscow, de Jong of the\nHague, Lloyd Tuckey of London, Stadelmann of Wurtzburg, contributed\npapers on the treatment of drunkenness by hypnotism ; and the general\nexperience was of an encouraging nature. BeVillon attached much impor\ntance to the creation of a \"psychic centre of inhibition\" which he brings\nabout by suggesting to the hypnotised patient that he is unable to con\nvey a glass containing alcohol to his mouth. At the same time he is\nmade to hold a glass in his hand and shown jhow he is paralysed when\nhe attempts to raise it to his lips. By repetition the suggestion becomes,\naa it were, a fixed idea which effectually pi-events indulgence.\nOther papers deal with hypnotism and medical jurisprudeoce (Dr. v.\nSchrenck-Notzing of Munich has made this latter subject quite his own) ;\nthe regulation of the practice of hypnotism by the State ; the relation of\nhypnosis to ordinary sleep, etc.\nCHAS. LLOYD TUCKET, M.D.\nWill Power, How to Acquire and Strengthen, by RICHARD J. EBBARD.\n(London, 1902. pp. 275. 8vo. The Modern Medical Publishing Co.)\nThis is one of many books published lately on the subject of will\npower and it is a fair example of its class. The theory of the subliminal\nself, so ably worked out by Mr. Myers and other members of the S.P.R.,\nis largely responsible for the prominence given to the subject, but the\nfollowers go much further than the pioneers would consider authorised\nby facts. According to Ebbard and his school the subconscious self is\nnot only omniscient but also omnipotent, and has only to be properly\ntrained and suitably evoked to cure all the ills which afflict the human\nbody and mind. Herr Ebbard is a profound believer in the Nancy school\nof hypnotism, but he considers hypnosis unnecessary. He gives elaborate\ntables for self-treatment by suggestion, and he advocates this being\ncarried out at night while waiting for sleep. At this time, he argues,\nit is possible to so influence the mind by repetition of a phrase us to\nmake it a dominant idea and the determining influence on function and\nconduct.\nThe book contains much good advice, and many of the directions given\nare based on sound common sense. The author mixes up a good many\nother things with his psychic treatment, so that a patient studying it\nmight feel a good deal puzzled, and feel inclined to consult Herr\n\f424 Dr. Charles Lloyd Tuckey. [PART\nEbbard\u2014a not unwished-for result, perhaps. Several patent and quack\nremedies are vaunted and altogether one is reminded of the saying\nattributed to Talleyrand that appropriate incantations and arsenic will\nkill sheep.\n('HAS. LLOYD TUCKET, M.D.\nHave You a Strong Will? By C. G. LELAND. (Second and Enlarged\nEdition, pp. 284. 8vo. Philip Welby, London, 1902.)\nA book by the veteran author of The Brritmann Battadt commands\nrespectful attention, and when Mr. Leland assures us that his memory\nhas improved since his seventieth birthday by following out the rules\nhe explains in his book, we are bound to believe him, and to acknow\nledge the value of the lesson he teaches.\nThe case of another \"Grand Old Man,\" the late Dr. Brown Sequard,\nthe famous neurologist of Paris, however, occurs to one's mind, and how\nhe thought he had discovered the elixir of life and could renew his own\nyouth and energy by its use.\nMr. Leland discourses in his pleasant style on the different systems of\nartificial memory, which are all, he says, based on association of ideas ;\nand then he comes to his own system, which he terms direct memory.\nBriefly, this consists of cultivating the memory, and so gradually\nstrengthening it, by learning extracts and things by heart at bedtime\nwith careful attention and the strong wish to understand aud remember\nthem. By degrees, the author says, the memory becomes so strengthened\nthat one is able to remember without difficulty anything leaint in this\nmanner, the subconscious self being thus educated. Not only is memory\nimproved, but character can be formed and vicious tendencies can be\namended. Mr. Leland says he began to practise on himself, willing that\nhe should be able to work all the next day without fatigue. In this\nway he acquired confidence and facility, which, he adds, is marvellous in\na man of his age. It will be very interesting if some of the members\nof the S.P.R. will carry out the author's suggestions and let us know the\nresult. A person who can never remember Hates or figures might begin\nby impressing a few of these on his mind the last thing before going\nto sleep, and gradually increase the task until the normal faculty was\nacquired or even surpassed.\nCHAS. LLOYD TUCKEY, M.D.\nChristian Science, Medicine, and Occultism, by ALBERT MOLL, M.D.\n(London: Rebman Ltd., 1902. pp. 47. 8vo. Price 6d.)\nDr. Moll is well known as a writer on hypnotism and allied subjects,\nand is a prominent physician in Berlin. In this paper he gives an account\nof his investigation of Christian Science in Germany and also in the\nUnited States. He writes from the standpoint of an educated physician,\n\fXLV.] Review. 425\nbut with an open mind. He admits the cures which Mrs. Eddy and\nher followers often effect, but he is convinced that these are only possible\nin functional and nervous maladies. Dr. Moll quotes the offer of an\nAmerican physician who expresses his readiness to pay $1000 to any one\nwho can produce a single case of malignant disease cured by Christian\nScience. He is an uncompromising opponent of Spiritualism, the pheno\nmena of which he thinks are always produced by fraud and deception.\nHe quotes several gross cases which have occurred in Berlin, and he\nseems to have been very unfortunate in his investigations.\nMembers of the S.P.R. will think Dr. Moll wanting in a sense of\nfairness and proportion in his conclusions, and in his classing together\n\" animal-magnetism, table-moving, telepathy, spirit-rapping, materialisa\ntion, and fire-walking.\" He says be has never, during the many years\nhe has made occultism a particular study, come across a single pheno\nmenon which was not \"open to explanation by forces known to reputable\nscience.\"\nDr. Moll shows the serious risk run in treating all diseases as the\noutcome of morbid imagination, and how in such a disease as appendicitis,\nwhen a successful issue depends upon early and correct diagnosis, time\nmay be lost and life endangered by treating the symptoms as trivial\nand neglecting to call in a doctor. He thinks that spiritualists and\nChristian scientists are generally sworn enemies to the regular school of\nmedicine, are often strict vegetarians or enthusiastic homoeopathists, and\ngenerally persons of unstable mental equilibrium. Dr. Moll gives a long\nlist of spiritualistic and occult societies existing in Berlin, and he thinks\nthat Germany and other countries are suffering from a psychical\nepidemic.\nCHAS. LLOYD TUCKEY, M.D.\nZur Psychologie und Pathologie sogenannter occulter Phiinomene. Von DR.\nMED. C. G. JUNG. (Leipzig : O. Mutze, 1902, 8vo. pp. 122.)\nIn this little work Dr. Jung, who is Assistant Medical Officer of the\nPsychiatrische Klinik at Zurich, discusses two cases which came under\nhis own observation. The first, very briefly related, is a case of hallucinatory\nattacks followed by amnesia in a patient who suffered apparently from\noverwork. The author justly remarks that [some of the leading cases on\nwhich the psychologist commonly relies are little better than anecdotes, and\nno more reliable than anecdotes usually are. It is a useful work to replace\nthese travellers' tales by modern examples which have been submitted\nto careful study and analysis.\nThe second case is of more interest from the point of view of psychical\nresearch. The subject, a female medium of sixteen years of age, developed\na mystical system of natural science in the course of her trances. The\ndevelopment of her \"controls\" is carefully traced, but unfortunately no\ndetails are given on one point of great interest. It is stated (p. 24) that\n\f426 N. W. Thomas. [PART\nshe was able to personate remarkably well dead relatives and even persons\nwho had merely been described to her. Experiments in personation are\nobviously complementary to Professor Hyslop's experiments in identifica\ntion, and it is a matter for regret that the author did not see the importance\nof such observations. There seems to have been nothing beyond secondary\npersonality in the trances. Among other phenomena glossolalie was\noccasionally observed ; the language was unmistakably a modified French.\nN. W. THOMAS.\nThe Hind of Man, by GUSTAV SPILLER. (Swan Sonnenschein, London,\n1902, 8vo. pp. xiv. 552.)\nMr. Spiller has come to the conclusion that psychology is amazingly\nbackward and in this book sets forth the results of his efforts to advance\nit. We learn in the preface that it is the outcome of the application of\nthe experimental method ; the author professes to have built up his fabric\nby introspection ; he reviews incidentally the literature of normal psycho\nlogy. We can hardly be surprised that a writer who regards the science\nof psychology as up to the present non-existent deals hardly with psychical\nresearch and spiritualism (he does not distinguish between them), and as\na matter of fact, hia view seems to be that the whole thing is a superstition.\nHe says : \" How are we to account for members of learned societies\nseriously maintaining the objectivity of these pretences [of the Spiritualists] ?\nThe less said on the subject the better.\" And again : \" There is no science\nof spiritism . . . after the short experimental stage come undiluted\ndogma and reckless speculation. Professors Wallace, Crooken, Lodge and\nJames illustrate what I am saying. Only the last of these is a psychologist\nand he has never written anything bulky on the subject.\" After Mr.\nSpillert unqualified condemnation of psychologists, as \" philosophers, i.e.\nthose who have settled doctrines to begin with,\" it is a little difficult\nto see on what grounds he thinks that psychologists are best fitted to\ninvestigate spiritism. It is still less clear why no psychologist can l>e\nan authority until he has written something bulky on the subject. Again\nit is difficult to suppose that Mr. Spiller means anything by accusing Sir\nOliver Lodge and Sir William Crookes of reckless speculation after a\nshort experimental stage. If they have published nothing bulky, they\nhave not indulged in reckless speculation. Mr. Spiller's view that the\nwhole thing is a superstition makes his attitude towards Sir W. Crookes's\nexperiments rather enigmatic ; he regards them as \"interesting.\" If\nthe whole thing is fraudulent, one might suppose that experiments\ncould only be interesting in proportion as the experimenter was deceived.\nIf there is an objective basis, on the other hand, it is rather hard on\nmembers of learned societies that they may not say so without being\nregarded as superstitious. More inexplicable still is Mr. Spiller's state\nment that \"competent persons\" should examine the whole subject. Mr.\nSpiller is quite sure that it is all humbug ; this being so, one does\n\fXLV.] Review. 427\nnot quite see what his competent person is to do. The remainder of\nthe work is not quite so revolutionary as Mr. Spiller imagines. The\nline he takes is not always very clear and he would probably have\nbeen more effective if he had confined himself to a narrower field.\nN. W. THOMAS.\n\f428 Edmund Gurney Library.

IN PREPARATION.\nThis work aims at presenting in continuous form the bulk of the evidence,\nexperimental and otherwise, which points to human faculty operating below\nthe threshold of ordinary consciousness during the life of earth, and to human\nfaculty continuing to operate after the body's decay. Among the subjectt\ntreated of in this book are Alternating Personalities, Hysteria, Genius, Sleep,\nDreams, Hypnotism, Apparitions, Crystal-Gazing, Automatic Writing, Trance,\nPossession, Ecstasy, Life after Death. The Author's object was to bring\nwithin the purview of Experimental Psychology many topics as yet unfamiliar\nto science, but nevertheless ripe, as he believed, for scienti6c experiment and\ndiscussion.\nIt is hoped that the book will appear in the early autumn. The proofs of\nthe greater part of it had been revised by the Author, and it will be brought\nout under the editorship of Dr. Richard Hodgson and Miss Alice Johnson.\nLONGMANS, GREEN & CO., PATERNOSTER Row, LONDON, E.C.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nfART XLIII.
