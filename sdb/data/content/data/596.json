G. Piddington.\nA\n\f2 Professor William James. [part\nI.\nEEPOET ON MRS. PIPER'S HODGSON-CONTROL.\nPART I.\n1\nBy Professor William James.\nRichard Hodgson died suddenly upon December 20th, 1905.\nOn December 28th a message purporting to come from him\nwas delivered in a trance of Mrs. Piper's, and she has hardly\nheld a sitting since then without some manifestation of what\nprofessed to be Hodgson's spirit taking place. Hodgson had\noften during his lifetime laughingly said that if he ever\npassed over and Mrs. Piper was still officiating here below,\nhe would control her better than she had ever yet been\ncontrolled in her trances, because he was so thoroughly\nfamiliar with the difficulties and conditions on this side.\nIndeed he was ; so that this would seem prima facie a\nparticularly happy conjunction of spirit with medium by which\nto test the question of spirit return.\nI have collated 69 of the American sittings (the latest being\nthat of January 1st, 1908) in which the professed R. H. has\nappeared (his communications forming possibly a sixth of the\ntotal bulk of the records), and a few remarks as to my own\nrelation to the phenomenon would seem a good introduction\nto what follows. I have no space for twice-told tales, so I will\nassume that my readers are acquainted, to some degree at\nany rate, with previously printed accounts of Mrs. Piper's\n1\nThis report was prepared to be read at the General Meeting of the Society,\non January 28th, 1909. To make a single document by distributing its material\nthrough the larger report would cost much labor, so the two parts are printed\nseparately, but readers will understand that they should be read in conjunction.\n\fLVlil.] Report on Mrs. Piper s Hodgson-Control. 3\nmediumship. 1\nI had myself had no sitting with Mrs. Piper\nand had hardly seen her for some nine years, but for most\nof that time I had been kept informed of what was going\non by reading the typed records, furnished me by my friend\nHodgson, of all the trances of which report was taken, and\nfor which the sitters had not asked secrecy to be observed.\nThe \" Control \" most frequently in evidence in these years\nhas been the personage calling himself \" Hector.\" Dr. Hodgson\nwas disposed to admit the claim to reality of Eector and of\nthe whole Imperator-Band of which he is a member, while\nI have rather favoured the idea of their all being dream-\ncreations of Mrs. Piper, probably having no existence except\nwhen she is in trance, but consolidated by repetition into\npersonalities consistent enough to play their several roles.\nSuch at least is the dramatic impression which my acquaint-\nance with the sittings has left on my mind. I can see no\ncontradiction between Eector's being on the one hand an\nimprovised creature of this sort, and his being on the other\nhand the extraordinarily impressive personality which he\nunquestionably is. He has marvellous discernment of the\ninner states of the sitters whom he addresses, and speaks\nstraight to their troubles as if he knew them all in advance.\nHe addresses you as if he were the most devoted of your\nfriends. He appears like an aged and, when he speaks\ninstead of writing, like a somewhat hollow-voiced clergyman, a\nlittle weary of his experience of the world, endlessly patient\nand sympathetic, and desiring to put all his tenderness and\nwisdom at your service while you are there. Critical and\nfastidious sitters have recognized his wisdom, and confess\ntheir debt to him as a moral adviser. With all due respect\nto Mrs. Piper, I feel very sure that her own waking capacity\nfor being a spiritual adviser, if it were compared with Eector's,\nwould fall greatly behind.\nAs I conceive the matter, it is on this mass of secondary\nand automatic personality of which of late years Eector has\nbeen the centre, and which forms the steady background of\n1\nChief among these are Hodgson's reports in Vols. VIII. and XIII. of the\nS.P.R. Proceedings, Mrs. Sidgwick's discussion in Vol. XV., Hyslop's long\naccount in Vol. XVI., and his briefer one in his book Science and a Future\nLife.\n\fProfessor William James. [part\nMrs. Piper's trances, that the supernormal knowledge which\nshe unquestionably displays is flashed. Flashed, grafted,\ninserted\u2014use what word you will\u2014the trance-automatism is\nat any rate the intermediating condition, the supernormal\nknowledge comes as if from beyond, and the automatism uses\nits own forms in delivering it to the sitter. The most habitual\nform is to say that it comes from the spirit of a departed\nfriend. The earliest messages from \" Hodgson \" have been\ncommunicated by \" Hector,\" but he soon spoke in his own\nname, and the only question which I shall consider in this\npaper is this : Are there any unmistakable indications in the\nmessages in question that something that we may call the\n\" spirit \" of Hodgson was probably really there ? We need\nnot refine yet upon what the word \" spirit \" means and on\nwhat spirits are and can do. We can leave the meaning of\nthe word provisionally very indeterminate,\u2014the vague popular\nnotion of what a spirit is is enough to begin with.\nSources other than R. H.'s surviving spirit for the veridical\ncommunications from the Hodgson-control may be enumerated\nas follows :\n(1) Lucky chance-hits.\n(2) Common gossip.\n(3) Indications unwarily furnished by the sitters.\n(4) Information received from E. H., during his lifetime,\nby the waking Mrs. P. and stored up, either supraliminally or\nsubliminally, in her memory.\n(5) Information received from the living E. H., or others,\nat sittings, and kept in Mrs. Piper's trance-memory, but out\nof reach of her waking consciousness.\n(6) \" Telepathy,\" i.e. the tapping of the sitter's mind, or\nthat of some distant living person, in an inexplicable way.\n(7) Access to some cosmic reservoir, where the memory of\nall mundane facts is stored and grouped around personal centres\nof association.\nLet us call the first five of these explanations \" natural,\" and\nthe last two \" supernatural \" or \" mystical.\" It is obvious that\nno mystical explanation ought to be invoked so long as any\nnatural one remains at all plausible. Only after the first five\nexplanations have been made to appear improbable, is it time\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 5\nfor the telepathy-theory and the cosmic-reservoir theory to be\ncompared with the theory of B. H.'s surviving spirit.\nThe total amount of truthful information communicated by\nthe E. H. control to the various sitters is copious. He reminds\nthem, for the most part, of events\u2014usually unimportant ones\nwhich they and the living E. H. had experienced together.\nTaking any one of these events singly, it is never possible in\nprinciple to exclude explanations number 1 and 4. About\nnumber 3, a complete record of the sitting ought generally\nto decide. Number 2 is often excluded either by the trivial\nor by the intimate nature of the case. Number 5 would be\neasily settled if the records of the sittings of the living Hodgson\nwith Mrs. Piper were complete and accessible. They are\nsupposed, for the past ten or twelve years at least, to exist in\ncomplete form. But parts of them are in Hodgson's private\ncipher, and they are now so voluminous that it would be rash\nto say of any recent message from Hodgson, so long as the\nmatter of it might conceivably have been talked of at any\nprevious trance of Mrs. Piper's, that no record of such talk\nexists. It might exist without having yet been found.\nAdd, to these several chances that any communication of\nfact by the Hodgson-control may have had a natural source,\nthe further consideration that Mrs. Piper had known H. well\nfor many years, and one sees that her subliminal powers of\npersonation would have had an unusually large amount of\nmaterial to draw upon in case they wished to get up a make-\nbelieve spirit of Hodgson. So far, then, from his particular\ncase being an unusually good one by which to test the claim\nthat Mrs. Piper is possessed during her trances by the spirits\nof our departed friends, it would seem to be a particularly poor\none for that purpose. I have come to the conclusion that it\nis an exceptionally poor one. Hodgson's familiarity when in\nthe flesh with the difficulties at this end of the line has not\nmade him show any more expertness as a spirit than other\ncommunicators have shown ; and for his successes there are\nfar more naturalistic explanations available than is the case\nwith the other spirits who have professed to control Mrs. Piper.\nSo much for generalities, and so much for my own personal\nequation, for which my various hearers will make their sundry\nkinds of allowance. But before taking up the messages in\n\f6 Professor William James. [part\ndetail, a word more about the fourth of the naturalistic explana-\ntions which I have instanced (conversations, that is, between\nMrs. Piper and Hodgson when alive) is in order. Abstractly, it\nseems very plausible to suppose that E. H. (who systematically\nimposed on himself the law of never mentioning the content\nof any trance in her waking presence) might have methodically\nadopted a plan of entertaining her on his visits by reciting all\nthe little happenings of his days, and that it is this chronicle\nof small beer, stored in her memory, that now comes out for\nservice in simulating his spirit-identity.\nIn the concrete, however, this is not a highly probable\nhypothesis. Every one who knew Hodgson agrees that he was\nlittle criven to anecdotical small change, unless the incident\nwere comic or otherwise of an impressive order, and that his\nsouvenirs of fact were usually of a broad and synthetic type.\nHe had had a \" splendid time \" at such a place, with a\n\" glorious \" landscape, swim, or hill-climb, but no further\ndetail. Gifted with great powers of reserve by nature, he\nwas professionally schooled to secretiveness ; and a decidedly\nincommunicative habit in the way of personal gossip had become\na second nature with him,\u2014especially towards Mrs. Piper. For\nmany years past he had seen her three times weekly (except\nduring the months of her summer vacation) and had had to\ntranscribe the record afterwards. The work was time-consuming,\nand he found it excessively fatiguing. He had economized\nenergy upon it by adopting for many years past a purely busi-\nness tone with the medium, entering, starting the trance, and\nleaving when it was over, with as few unnecessary words as\npossible. Great brusqueric was among the excellent P. H.'s\npotentialities, and for a while the amount of it displayed towards\nMrs. P. led to a state of feeling on her part which a New York\nHerald reporter once took advantage of to exploit publicly.\nR. H. was remonstrated with, and was more considerate\nafterwards. It may well be that Mrs. Piper had heard one\nlittle incident or another, among those to be discussed in the\nfollowing report, from his living lips, but that any large mass of\nthese incidents are to be traced to this origin, I find incredible.\nThe spirit-Hodgson's first manifestion was, as I have said,\neight days after his death. There was something dramatically\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper s Hodgson-Control. 7\nso like him in the utterances of those earliest days, gradually\ngathering \"strength\" as they did, that those who had cognizance\nof them were much impressed. I will begin by a short account\nof these earliest appearances, of which the first was at Miss\nTheodate Pope's sitting on Dec. 28th, 1905. At this sitting\nRector had been writing, when the hand dropped the pencil and\nworked convulsively several seconds in a very excited manner.\nMiss P. What is the matter ?\n[The hand, shaking with apparently great excitement, wrote\nthe letter H, . . . bearing down so hard on the papei\nthat the point of the pencil was broken. It then wrote\n\" Hodgson.\"]\nMiss P. God bless you !\n[The hand writes \"I am\"\u2014followed by rapid scrawls, as\nif regulator of machine were out of order.]\nMiss P. Is this my friend\n1\n?\n[Hand assents by knocking five times on paper-pad.]\n(Rector.) Peace, friends, he is here, it was he, but he could\nnot remain, he was so choked. He is doing all in his\npower to return .... Better wait for a few moments\nuntil he breathes freer again.\nMiss P. I will.\n(R.) Presently he will be able to conduct all here.\nMiss P. That is good news.\n(R.) Listen. Everything is for the best. He holds in his\nhand a ring. ... He is showing it to you. Cannot you\nsee it, friend 1\nMiss P. I cannot see it. Have him tell me about it.\n(R.) Do you understand what it means?\nMiss P. I know he had a very attractive ring.\n(R.) Margaret.\n\"All\" was then written, with a \"B\" after it, and Miss P. asked\n\"what is that?\" \"A,\" \"B\" and \"L\" followed, but no explanation.\n[The explanation will be given later.]\n\f8 Professor William James. [part\nThe above is the whole of the direct matter from Hodgson\nat this, the first of the sittings at which he has appeared.\n(For the sequel to this ring-episode, see pp. 13-18.)\nAt Miss Pope's next sitting (five days later), after some talk\nabout him from Rector, E. H. appeared for the second time,\nand in the character, familiar to him, of being a well-spring\nof poetical lore. Mrs. Piper's hand cramped most awkwardly,\nfirst dropped and then broke the pencil. A new one being-\ngiven, the hand wrote as follows :\nRICHARD HODGSON I AM WELL HAPPY GLAD I CAME GOD BLESS POPE\nMiss Pope. Many thanks. [Then the hand wrote :\n\u2014\nIt lies not in her form or face\nTho these are passing fair,\nNor in the woman's tone of grace,\nNor in her falling hair ;\nIt lies not in those wondrous eyes\nthat swiftly light and shine,\nTho all the stars of all the skies\nThan these are less divine.\nI am only practicing.\nMiss P. Who wrote it ?\n(Rector.) Richard only.\nMiss P. When ?\nNow.\nMiss P. Doesn't it exist on paper in our world ?\nNo.\nMiss P. Did you really make that up 1\nYes.\nMiss P. Well, you are clever.\nIf you ever find this in your world, never believe in this\nworld !\nMiss P. I shall look for it, you may be sure.\nGood ! Think I'm asleep ] Not much ! My head. I must-\nleave you now.\n(Rector.) It is impossible for us to hold him\u2014that is all.\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 9\nMiss P. Rector, did he dictate that poem to you? ... Do you\nthink he made it upl\n(Rector.) I do positively know he did . . . Farewell !\nAt the second sitting after this (Jan. 8th, 1906), Miss Pope\nagain being the sitter, E. H. appeared again, writing as follows :\nI am Hodgson ... I heard your call\u2014I know you\u2014you\nare Miss Pope. Piper instrument. I am happy exceed-\ningly difficult to come very. I understand why Myers\ncame seldom. I must leave. I cannot stay. I cannot\nremain to-day. . . .\n(A tobacco-pouch that had belonged to Hodgson was presently\ngiven to the Medium as an \"influence,\" when the writing\nwent on :\n\u2014\nI am in the witness-box, do you remember ? \u2014Do you remem-\nber my promise to shake you up 1\nMiss P. I once asked Geo. P[elham] to \"shake me up.\"\nNo, I do not mean that.\nMiss P. What do you mean ?\nI said that if I got over here first I would soon learn how to\ncommunicate. \u2014I would not make a botch of it.\nMiss P. I remember\u2014indeed you did.\nI am certainly P. H. I am sure. I have joined dear old\nG. Pelham, who did so much for me\u2014more than all the\nrest put together.\n[After a few words in Pector's name, a brush that had\nbelonged to Hodgson was put into the medium's hand.]\nPemember my theory about objects'?\nMiss P. What was it 1\nThey carried their own light. I was right.\nMiss P. Yes, I remember very well.\nI see it now, I was right.\nDid you receive my lines to Miss D. [Referring apparently\nto the verses at the previous sitting.]\n\f10 Professor William James. [part\nMiss P. Good, that is most interesting.\nAmen ! Miss D [This name, correctly given, is that\nof the. cousin of R. H., mentioned as \"Q\" in previous\nreports, a name well known to the trance-consciousness.\n\u2014W. J.]\nMiss P. Miss D ?\nYes. Ah, ah, ah, (which written words indicate laughter).\nMiss P. What does that mean? \u2014(referring to the \"ah, ah\").\nI am amused at you. Yet 1 found them ?\nMiss P. No, I haven't.\nIt will take the remainder of your earthly life, and then\nyou'll fail.\nMiss P. You are just the same as ever.\nNot quite as full of energy as I wish, but give me time.\n[Rector then comes in, and the sitting closes.]\nOn Jan. 16 th and Jan. 17 th, R. H. spoke again to Miss\nPope, but without anything evidential in matter\u2014or in manner\neither, unless the following be counted as dramatically like :\nI shall never assume control here. Imperator shall lead me.\nIn his care I am safe. I was met by him. There will\nbe no moaning at the bar when I pass out to sea\nremember it I\n[Miss Pope assents.]\nOn Feb. 5th, R. H. asks again :\nGot any news of my poem 1\nMiss P. No, I give that up.\nI thought you would come to it. I made that up in a moment\nand composed to Miss D .\n[After some more non-evidential talk, R. H. mentions his\nliving friend, Miss Bancroft, and says :\n\u2014\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 11\nGive my love to her and tell her I hope to speak with her\nsoon.\nIt seems as if the wondrous land\nWithin her vision lay :\nI dimly sense the mystic strand\nBehind the glorious gray.\nTo Margaret Bancroft. Give her this. She has light.\n[Correct.\u2014W. J.]\nMiss P. Yes. Is this your own ?\nI just made it for her. . . . Tell her I shall never forget\nthose hills, the water, our talks, and the delightful visit I\nhad with her. [Correct. \u2014W. J.]\nMiss P. I think she is coming soon to speak with you here.\nGood. I hope so. Will you tell her, give her my message,\nask her if she knows anything about my watch being\nstopped. Do you 1 I must go out and get a little breath.\n[Miss B. writes:\u2014\"I think the watch means my watch.\nWe had a number of jokes about the frequent stopping\nof my watch.\"']\nOn Jan. 23rd, 1906, Mrs. Wm. James, and W. James, Jr.,\nhad a sitting at which K. H. used the medium's voice and save\na very lifedike impression of his presence. The record runs\nas follows :\n1\nWhy, there's Billy ! Is that Mrs. James and Billy ? God\nbless you ! Well, well, well, this is good ! [Laughs.] I\nam in the witness-box. [Laughs.] I have found my wa}',\nI am here, have patience with me. All is well with me.\nDon't miss me. Where's William'? Give him my love\nand tell him I shall certainly live to prove all I know.\nDo you hear me ? see me 1 I am not strong, but have\npatience with me. I will tell you all. I think I can\nreach you.\n1\nIn this and in some of my future citations from the records, I have condensed\nthe material by leaving out repetitions and digressions, so that what appears is\noften straighter and more coherent than what was originally given. I have,\nhowever, scrupulously endeavoured to omit nothing that could possibly have\ndetermined what was said or its veridieality. \u2014W.J.\n\fProfessor William Jo,mes. [part\nSomething on my mind. I want Lodge to know everything\nI have seen Myers. I must rest.\n[After an interval he comes in again :\n\u2014\nBilly, where is Billy 1 What are you writing, Billy ? Are\nyou having any sports? Would you like to take a swim?\n[B. H.'s chief association with W. J., Jr., had been when\nfishing or swimming in Chocorua Lake.] Well, come on !\nGet a good deal of exercise, but don't overdo it ! Perhaps\nI swam too much. [He undoubtedly had done so.]\u2014\nlearned my lesson, but I'm just where I wanted to be.\nDo you remember [Q] ?\n[Q] helped me. Then I saw Mother,\nBebecca, and Father. I want very much to converse with\nAnnie. [His sister.] She perfectly understood my efforts\nand was everything to me. I want her to know that I\nam living, and I am going on to show what I know to\nthe end of all time. Is Ellen well? \u2014that's my sister.\nI want G. D. [his brother-in-law] to have my watch.\n[The Hodgson-family names used here are correct, but were\nknown to the trance-consciousness. \u2014W. J.]\nDo you play ball? \u2014tennis? Men will theorize \u2014let them\ndo so ! I have found out the truth. I said that if I\ncould get over there I would not make a botch of it.\nIf ever B. H. lived in the body, he is talking now. . . .\nWilliam [James] is too dogmatic. ... I want George\n[Dorr] to extricate all those papers and set those marked\n\"private\" aside. This has been on my mind. George\nis to be trusted absolutely with all sincerity and faith.\nThere are some private records which I should not wish\nto have handled. Let George [Dorr] and Piddington go\nthrough them and return them to the sitters. The cipher !\nI made that cipher, and no one living can read it.\n[Correct.] I shall explain it later. Let Harry [James]\nand George keep them till then. [They had been\nappointed administrators of his estate, a fact probably\nknown to Mrs. Piper.] This is the best I have been\nable to do yet. I spoke with Miss Pope, but this is the\nbest. Remember, every communication must have the\nhuman element. I understand better now why I had so\nlittle from Myers. [To W. J., Jr.] What discourages\n\fLVIIL] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 13\nyou about your art ? [W. J., Jr., was studying painting.]\nOh what good times we had, fishing ! Believe, Billy,\nwherever you go, whatever you do, there is a God.\nSo much for Hodgson's first appearances, which were char-\nacteristic enough in manner, however incomplete.\nWithin the space to which this preliminary report is\nlimited one can hardly quote the records verbatim, for they\nare anything but concise. My best plan will be to cull\na few of the best veridical communications, and discuss\nthem simply, from the point of view of the alternatives of\nexplanation.\nI begin with what I shall call\nThe Bing Incident.\nOn Hodgson's 50th birthday, a lady whom I will call Mrs.\nLyman, an old friend of his, much interested in the Biper work,\nhad given him a rather massive ring to wear. The source of\nthis ring H. had kept to himself, and after his death Mrs.\nL. asked the administrator of his estate to return it to her.\nThe ring could not be found.\nAt the sitting of Dec. 28th (B. H.'s first appearance as a\nspirit), it will be remembered that the control Sector had\nsaid to Miss Bope, the sitter, \" He holds in his hand a ring\ndo you understand what it means ?\n\"\nMiss P. I know he had a very attractive ring.\nRector (writing) Margaret, a 11 B, L.\nOn Jan. 16th, Miss Bope being again the sitter, the B. H.-\ncontrol suddenly wrote :\nGive ring to Margaret back to Margaret. [Mrs. Lyman's\nname is not Margaret.]\nMiss P. Who is Margaret 1\nI was with her in summer.\nMiss P. All right, but the ring has not been found yet. Can you\nfind out where it is ?\nThe undertaker got it.\n\f14 Professor William James. [part\nMiss P. Oh, all right.\nI know. Help me.\nMiss P. I shall look it up.\nIt was with me.\nMiss P. Yes, I heard so.\nIt was, it was.\nMiss P. I will attend to it.\nThank you.\nOn January 24th, Mrs. Lyman herself had her first sitting.\nAs soon as Hodgson appeared he wrote :\nThe ring. You gave it me on my fiftieth birthday. When\nthey asked I didn't want to say you gave it me, I didn't\nwant to say that. . . . Two palm-leaves joining each\nother\u2014Greek. [Here followed an illegible word. The\npalms truly described the ring, which Mrs. Piper probably\nhad seen ; but it bore no Greek inscription, nor was the\nsymbol on it a Greek cross.] You gave it me\u2014\nMrs. L.

No, they didn't find it on your finger.\nPocket, it was in my pocket, I'll find it you shall have it.\nOn January 29th, Mrs. L. had another sitting. The Hodgson-\ncontrol wrote\nI have been trying to make clear about that ring. It is\non my mind all the time. I thought if I could get\nMargaret B. to get it for me, I would get it to you\nthrough her, then no one would understand. I could\nnot tell Miss Pope about you.\nMrs. L. Did you think Margaret B. gave it to you ?\nOh dear no ! not at all.\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 15\nMrs. L.

That is true, but what was the motto in the ring\n1\n?\nAll will be clear to me in time. Do not ask me test\nquestions now. ... I wish the ring now to go back\nto yourself. I thought Margaret would understand and be\nglad to do it for me. I could not tell Miss Pope about\nyou.\nOn March 5th E. H. again inquires of Mrs. Lyman about\nthe ring. She then asks him :\n\" Did you have it on that\nlast day when you went to the boat-elub ?\n\" [B, H. died\nwhile playing a game of hand-ball at the boat-club.]\nI certainly had it on that day.\nMrs. L. You told Miss P. the undertaker got it,\nThought he did and I am sure a man took it from my\nfinger.\n[After a few more words R.. H. continues :]\nI had that ring on my finger when I started for the club,\nI recall putting in my pocket, I did so because it hurt\nmy finger when playing ball. I am not dreaming, I am\nclear. When I get here first I am a little stuffy, but\nI am as clear now as I ever was, I put it in my waist-\ncoat pocket.\nMrs. L. Why do you think a man stole it 1\nI saw it on a finger. ... I put in my pocket, and the one\nwho took care of my clothes is responsible for it. . . .\nWhat did they do with my waistcoat?\nOn May 16th, on being told that the ring i s not yet\nfound, the Pi.

I see\nwhere he goes and the house where he lives, plainly. . , .\nFive story brick house not far from the club and he is\non the third story from the street, near the corner of\nthe street, the room is in the rear of the building and\nI see his face clearly [a description of the man follows].\nI see the ring on his finger clearly. The waistcoat was\nin his room when I entered the light a few moments\nago. I am as sure of this as I am that you are Mrs.\nLyman.\nIn point of fact the ring was found a couple of months\nlater in the pocket of Hodgson's waistcoat, which had been\ntoo carelessly explored for it, and which had lain during all\nthe interval in a room at the house of Mr. Dorr, with whom\nthe Hodgson-control had all the time been having frequent\ncommunications.\nThe whole incident lends itself easily to a naturalistic\ninterpretation. Mrs. Piper or her trance-consciousness may\npossibly have suspected the source of the ring. Mrs. Lyman's\nmanner may have confirmed the suspicion. The manner in\nwhich the first misleading reference to \" Margaret \" was after-\nwards explained away may well have been the cunning of a\n\" control \" trying plausibly to cover his tracks and justify his\nprofessed identity. The description of the house and of the\nman to whom he ascribes its present possession sounds like\nvague groping, characteristic also of control- cunning. The\ndescription was but little like that of Mr. Dorr, whose house,\nmoreover, is neither very near a corner nor very near a club.\nOn the other hand, if the hypothesis be seriously enter-\ntained that Hodgson's spirit was there in a confused state,\nusing the permanent Piper automatic machinery to communicate\nthrough, the whole record is not only plausible but natural.\nIt presents just that mixture of truth and groping which we\nought to expect. Hodgson has the ring \" on his mind \" just\nas Mrs. Lyman has. Like her, he wishes its source not to\nbe bruited abroad. He describes it accurately enough, truly\ntells of his taking it to the fatal boat-club, and of putting\ninto his waistcoat-pocket there, of the waistcoat being taken\nfrom the locker, and vaguely, but not cpuite erroneously,\nindicates its present position.\ni\n\fLvin.j Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 17\nMrs. Lyman's own impression of the incident is as follows\n\"No living person beside myself knew who had given him the\nring, and I am quite sure that the living R. H. would have been\nas desirous as I to keep all mention of me out of the trance-\nrecord. Had he had entire control he would never have mentioned\nthe ring until I had come to a sitting, but in his half-dreamy state\nsomething slipped out to Miss Pope, the sitter, aided telepathically\nperhaps by her knowledge that he had lately worn an unusual-looking\nring which she knew was missing after his death. I am sure that\nMiss Pope thought the ring would be a good \" test,\" so that\nalthough she was not the first to speak of it, it must certainly\nhave been in her mind. It is characteristic of R. H. that even\nin his half-conscious state he is able to keep his own counsel so\nwell. The word Margaret and the letters B and L which followed\nthe mention of the ring at the very first sitting seem to refer to Miss\nMargaret Bancroft and myself. He knew that Miss Bancroft had\n\"light,\" and he seems to feel that if he can only reach her she will\nunderstand what he wants. He was well aware of my own morbid\ndislike of having my affairs mentioned at the trance outside of my\nown sittings. You know that curious trait of suspicion in Hodgson's\nabsolutely honest nature\u2014trained in him professionally. When\nMiss Pope tells him the ring cannot be found, he at once thinks\n\"there was my body, and my clothes, etc., I believe the undertaker\ntook it.\" Then I myself, Mrs. Lyman, come and again tell him\nthe ring can't be found. His earthly memories presently become\nclear and he tells me exactly what he did with it before his death.\nBut his suspicious side has been aroused\u2014you know how anything\nonce registered on the trance-machinery seems to make an impression\nand tends to recur\u2014and again he thinks that some one took it.\nNothing could be more characteristic of H. than his indignant\nremark about the man who had charge of his clothes being\nresponsible. It all seems to me the kind of unpractical thing that\na man would do in a dream. There are strong characteristics of\nR. H. in it, but it is R. H. dreaming and troubled. I am glad\nI haven't to make myself intelligible to a stranger to the persons\ninvolved ; but knowing them as I do, I feel my own way straight\nthrough the maze, and the explanation is clear.\"\nThis incident of the ring seems to me a typical example\nof the ambiguity of possible interpretation that so constantly\nhaunts us in the Piper-phenomenon. If you are willing\nB\n\f18 Professor William James. [part\nbeforehand to allow that a half-awakened spirit may come\nand mix its imperfect memories with the habits of the\ntrance-automatism, and you apperceive the message sympatheti-\ncally, what you get is entirely congenial with your hypothesis.\nBut if you insist that nothing but knock-down evidence for\nthe spirits shall be counted, then, since what comes is also\ncompatible with natural causes, your hardness of heart remains\nunbroken, and you continue to explain things by automatic\npersonation and accidental coincidence, with perhaps a dash\nof thought-transference thrown in. People will interpret this\nring-episode harmoniously witb their prepossessions. Taken\nby itself its evidential value is weak ; but experience shows, I\nthink, that a large number of incidents, hardly stronger than\nthis one, will almost always produce a cumulative effect on\nthe mind of a sitter whose affairs they implicate, and dispose\nhim to the spiritistic view. It grows first possible, then\nplausible, then natural, and finally probable in a high degree.\nThe next incident I will cite is one which at a certain\nmoment gave me a little thrill, as if I might be really talking\nwith my old friend. (I have to make the personal confession\nthat this reality-coefficient, as Professor Baldwin calls it, has\ngenerally been absent from my mind when dealing with the\nPiper-controls or reading reports of their communications.) I\nwill call the episode \" the nigger-talk case.\"\nThe Nigger-Talk Case.\nOn February 27th, 1906, at a sitting with Professor Hyslop,\nthe following dialogue took place :\nR. H. I wonder if you recall what I said I would do if I should\nreturn first 1\nHyslop. I do not remember exactly.\nRemember that I told Myers that we would talk nigger-talk\n\u2014Myers\u2014talk nigger-talk 1\nHyslop. No, you must have told that to some one else.\nAh yes, James. I remember it was James, yes, Will James.\nHe will understand.\nMr. Hyslop immediately wrote to me\u2014I being in California\n\u2014enclosing the record and soliciting corrohoration. I had\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 19\nto reply that the words awakened absolutely no echo in ray\nmemory. Three months later I returned to Cambridge, and\nbegan to study records of sittings held during my absence.\nI met this incident again, and again it failed to stir my\nmemory. But the very next day, in a conversation with\nMessrs. Dorr and Piddington, while I was recalling certain\ndiscussions that I had formerly had with Hodgson about the\namenability to suggestion of the Piper-controls, it suddenly\nflashed across me that these were probably what the words to\nHyslop had meant. I had namely said to Hodgson, more than\nonce, that a little tactful steering on his part would probably\nchange the sacerdotal verbiage of the Imperator-group so com-\npletely that he would soon find them \" talking like nigger-\nminstrels.\" For a moment I felt sure that this expression of\nmine, buried so deep in my own mind that it required a peculiar\nchain of associations to revive it, was what was dimly working\nin the memory of a surviving Hodgson, and trying to extricate\nitself. It was so incredible that E. H. would ever have repeated\nsuch a remark to either the waking Mrs. Piper or to her\ncontrols, that it seemed a good test of his survival. I regret\nto say, however, that the subsequent developments of the\nincident have deprived it in my eyes of all test-value. Not\nonly did the Hodgson-control, when questioned by me subse-\nquently, fail to recall anything like that discussion of the\ncontrol's suggestibility which was the setting in which my\nmemory had put the phrase, but Mr. Piddington has found in\nthe Piper-records evidence that Hodgson had used the words\n\" nigger-talk \" in speaking to the Myers-control, so that this\nexpression must be considered as part of the stock of Mrs.\nPiper's trance-vocabulary.1\nSuch an incident shows how wary\none must be in one's interpretations. A really expert critic\nof the Piper-trances ought to be familiar with the entire\nmass of material previous to any utterance under consideration.\nHodgson was extraordinarily expert in this sense, and one of\nthe weirdest feelings I have had, in dealing with the business\nlately, has been to find the wish so frequently surging up in\n1{ 'Feb. 4th, 1902. Dr. Hodgson (spontaneously to Myers-control) Do you\nremember about your laughing with me once and your saying that doubtless\nyou would some time be coming back and talking nigger-talk \">. \" A reference\nto the same incident is also made in the sitting of Feb. 13th, 1901.\n\f20 Professor William James. [part\nme that he were alive beside me to give critical counsel as\nto how best to treat certain of the communications of his own\nprofessed spirit.\nThe Huldah-Episode.\nDuring the voice-sitting of May 2nd, 1905, Mr. Piddington\nbeing present, the R. H. control said\nPid, I want very much to give you my private letters con-\ncerning a Miss\u2014a Miss\u2014in Chicago [pseudonym]. I do\nnot wish any one to read them.\nJ. G. P. How shall I know ?\nLook at my letters stamped from Chicago. I wouldn't have\nthem get out for the world.\nThe name \" Densmore \" [pseudonym] was then written. Mr.\nPiddington asked whether the letters would be signed by the\nsurname or the Christian name. The name \" Huldah \" was then\ngiven as that by which the letters would be signed.\nOn May 14th Piddington reported to the R. H. control that\nno such letters could be found, and asked for further informa-\ntion\n\u2014\" Can you tell me at what time this lady wrote letters\nto you ? Was it lately ?\n\"\nNo, several years previously. I should be much distressed\nif they fell into other hands. No one living except the\nlady and myself knows of the correspondence.\nJ. G. P. If I cannot find those letters, should you feel any objection\nto my writing to the lady to ask if there has been such\na correspondence 1\nYes, I would rather you would do so.\nLater (May 29th) Piddington reports unsuccessful search\nagain, and Mr. Dorr, who also is present, asks whether\n\" Huldah \" is one of a family of Densmores known to him.\n\" Is she a sister of Mary, Jenny, and Ella [pseudonyms] ?\nElla is the one. Huldah we used to call her.\n[This was emphatically spoken. Then followed a statement\n(not caught in Mr. Dorr's notes) that the lady's full name was\nElla Huldah Densmore.]\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 21\nNo one living could have known it. I hope I have destroyed\nthem\u2014I may have done so and forgotten it. There was\na time when I greatly cared for her, and I did not wish\nit known in the ears of others. I think she can corro-\nborate this. I am getting hazy. I must leave.\nOn June 5th, Mrs. William James and Mr. Dorr being\npresent, D. asked :\n\" Can you tell us anything more about\nHuldah Densmore ? You said the other day that she was the\nsame person as Ella ? Were you clear in saying that ?\nDid I say that 1 That was a mistake. She is a sister. Is\none of the three sisters, but not Ella. [She was Ella.]\nI know what I am talking about. I saw Huldah in\nChicago. I was very fond of her. I proposed marriage\nto her, but she refused me.\nThe statement about proposing marriage was not divulged\nto me by my wife, until I had already heard from the lady\ncalled Ella Densmore in this narrative, who was then in a\nforeign country, and to whom I had written to ascertain whether\nshe and Hodgson had ever corresponded, or whether she or\nany one in her family was christened Huldah. Both Mr. Dorr\nand I knew her, but I was ignorant that she and Hodgson\nwere acquainted. Great was my surprise when she wrote as\nfollows :\nRegarding the utterances of Mrs. Piper, I have no difficulty in\ntelling you the circumstances on which she may have founded her\ncommunications. Years ago Mr. H. asked me to marry him, and\nsome letters were exchanged between us which he may have kept.\nI do not remember how I signed the letters to him. I have\nsometimes used my middle name, Hannah, instead of Ella. [She\nknew of no \" Huldah \" in her family.]\nIn spite of the confusion that pervades Hodgson's veracious\nutterances here, it seems improbable that they should merely\nhave been lucky flukes. Two naturalistic explanations offer\nthemselves immediately.\n(1) He might have made Mrs. Piper his confidant at the\ntime ; but no one who knows Hodgson will regard this\nexplanation for a moment as credible.\n\f22 Professor William James. [part\n(2) Nothing spreads as fast as rumors of this sort; so\nthat if there had been a gossipy rumor, it might very well\nhave spread to Mrs. Piper's ears, although it had skipped over\nMr. Dorr's and mine. I accordingly inquired of a dozen of\nE. H.'s most intimate friends, saying :\n\" Suppose I were to\ntell you that Hodgson had been in love not long ago, and\nhad offered himself to a certain lady\u2014would any particular\nperson's name arise in your mind in consequence of such a\nsuggestion ?\n\" Not a single one of these friends thought of\nthe name of Miss Densmore, although three of them suggested\nother names very wide of the mark. Evidently no gossip\nhad got into circulation, and E. H. had covered his tracks\nwell. He was indeed the most singular mixture of expansive-\nness and reticence I have ever known ; and the reticence had\nbeen increased professionally, as I may say, through his long\ntraining in having to guard the private affairs of sitters, and\nto watch himself with Mrs. Piper. I was Hodgson's earliest\nAmerican friend, and until his death always imagined myself\nto enjoy an almost perfect intimacy with him. Since his\ndeath I have nevertheless found that whole departments of\nhis life were unknown to me. In this \" Huldah \" matter\nin particular, not only was I unaware that lie and she were\nacquainted, but if any one had described him to me as being\nin love with her, I should have scouted the story as inherently\nimprobable, from the character of the two parties.\nNevertheless the story was true, barring the false name\nHuldah and a certain vacillation about the real Christian name.\nThe sister of the so-called \" Huldah \" has told me, moreover,\nthat besides herself, she thought that no living person knew\nfrom her sister's lips of E. H.'s state of mind. As Hodgson\nhimself had apparently told no one, the incident seemed an\nexcellent one to count in favor of spirit-return, unless, indeed,\nit should turn out that while it was happening, he had been\nled to consult the Piper- controls about it himself, and to use\n\" Huldah's \" name as a test of their telepathic or clairvoyant\npowers. But that even then he could have given them the\nreal name seems unlikely, in view of his habitual methods.\nThe records taken to England have not yet been looked over\nfrom this point of view, and no one knows just what they\nmay contain, but fortunately one of the sittings with Mrs.\n\flviii] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 23\nPiper after Hodgson's decease throws decisive light upon the\nmatter. Hodgson did consult the Imperator group at the\ntime of his disappointment, and the reasonable conclusion is\nthat the revelation which so surprised Mr. Dorr and myself\nwas thus a product of Mrs. Piper's trance-memory of previous\nconversations with the living Hodgson.\nThe sitting to which I allude was held on January 27th,\n1906, by Prof. Newbold. In the course of it the Hodgson-\ncontrol suddenly says :\nLet me ask if you remember anything about a lady in\n[Chicago] to whom I referred.\nW. R, N. Oh Dick, I begin to remember. About eight or nine\nyears ago, was it, Dick ]\nYes.\n[Note by W. JR. N. \u2014Such a lady was frequently mentioned\nat sittings in 1895, and H. was told he would marry\nher. I was present when these statements were made,\nif my memory serves me.]\nW. R. N. Tell me more, so I won't tell you !\nAnd my position regarding her.\nW. R. N. I wasn't sure it was in [Chicago].\nDo you remember .... Densmore 1\nW. R. N. Was it Jessie Densmore 1\nYes, Good.\n[Mr. Dorr, who was present, here interjects :]\n\"Do you mean the name was Jessie Densmore, Hodgson?\"\nNo, no, no, no. [Jessie was the first name of K. H.'s\nAustralian cousin, \"Q\".\u2014W. J.]\nW. R. N. Dick, you told me years ago about a lady you were\ninterested in, but 1 have forgotten her name and where\nshe lived.\nShe lived in [Chicago].\nW. R. N. Dick, it comes back to me as a cloud.\nShe was a Miss Densmore j I loved her dearly.\n\f24 Professor William James. [part\nW. R. N. You used to tell me about her years ago.\nYes, and she afterwards married. Yes, I told you, and\nyou are the only man I ever told. [Correct, apparently,\nsave for the possibility of his having told Myers. See\nbelow.]\nW. R. N. I'm not sure you told me her name.\nYes, I did.\nW. R. N. The name is the least likely thing for me to remember\nWhat is the married name of Miss Densmore ?\nHeaven knows ! It has gone from me and I shall soon go\nmyself.\nSo much for Dr. Newbold's evidence. He has sent me a\nletter written to him by Hodgson in 1895, from which it\nwould appear that the Piper controls had prophesied that both\nhe and Newbold would ere long be made matrimonially happy,\nbut that whereas the prophecy was being verified in N.'s case,\nit had been falsified in his own, he having that day received\nformal announcement of the marriage of Miss Densmore to\nanother. The only other material which 1 shall quote is\nthe following dialog, at a sitting of nay own, October 24th,\n1906. Inquiring about \" Huldah,\" I ask:\nW. J. Did you make any one your confidant'?\nNo, though I may possibly have given a hint of it to\nNewbold.\nW. J. Did you tell anybody on the other side of the water ?\nI may possibly have hinted it to Lodge.\nW. J. Her sister tells me she thinks you may have told Myers\nwhen he Avas alive.\nI think not : I may have hinted it to Myers.\nW. J. She denies any knowledge of the name Huldah.\nI used that name instead of the right christian name [he\nhere gives the latter correctly] to avoid compromising\n\u2014 it was a very delicate matter, and caused me great\ndisappointment. Have you communicated it to her ?\n\fLVIII.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 25\nW. J. Yes, and she corroborates\n[R. H. displays no further curiosity, \u2014a living person would\nprobably have asked whether the lady had said nothing\nabout him, etc.]\nDo you remember a lady-doctor in New York? a member\nof our Society 1\nW. J. No, but what about her?\nHer husband's name was Blair, ... I think.\nW. J. Do you mean Mrs. Dr. Blair Thaw?\nOh yes. Ask Mrs. Thaw if I did not at a dinner party\nmention something about the lady. I may have done so.\n[Mrs. Thaw writes in comment upon this:\n\u2014\"Fifteen years\nago, when R. H. was visiting us after his operation for\nappendicitis he told me that he had just proposed to a\nyoung lady and been refused. He gave no name\/'\u2014Mrs.\nThaw is the only living person beside Newbold to whom\nI can certainly find that he ever spoke of this episode,\nand the clue to Mrs. Thaw comes from the control !\nW. J.]\nW. J. Do you remember the name of Huldah's present husband 1\n[To which R. H. replies by giving his country and title\ncorrectly, but fails to give his name.]\nThe entire incident shows the importance of completeness\nin the records. Without Professor Newbold's sitting we\nshould have no present assurance that the trance-memory\nmight have furnished the facts which seemed at the first\nblush to suggest so strongly the return of a \" spirit \" in a\nstate of confused memory. Compatible with the return of such\na spirit the facts indeed are. The possibility of the more\nnaturalistic explanation doesn't make the supernatural one\nimpossible ; and if spirit-return were already made probable\nby other evidence, this might well be taken as a case of it\ntoo. But what I am sifting these records for is independent\nevidence of such return ; and so long as the record in this\ninstance lends itself so plausibly to a naturalistic explanation,\nI think we must refuse to interpret it in the spiritistic way.\n\f26 Professor William James. [part\nA couple of smaller veridical incidents which have seemed\nto the sitters to make rather strongly for spirit-return are\nconnected with E. H.'s financial history. I shall call them,\nThe Pecuniary Messages.\nThe American Branch had never fully paid its expenses\nand although the Secretary's salary had always been very\nsmall, Hodgson had, after the first years, been reluctant to\nhave any part of it charged to the mother-country. The\nresult had occasionally been pecuniary embarrassment on his\npart. During his last visit to England, shortly after Myers's\ndeath, this embarrassment had been extreme ; but an American\nfriend, divining it in the nick of time, rescued him by an\nimpulsive and wholly unexpected remittance. To this remit-\ntance he replied by a letter which contained some banter\nand, among other things, cited the story of a starving couple\nwho were overheard by an atheist who was passing the house,\nto pray aloud to God for food. The atheist climbed the roof\nand dropped some bread down the chimney, and heard them\nthank God for the miracle. He then went to the door and\nrevealed himself as its author. The old woman replied to\nhim: \"Well, the Lord sent it, even if the devil brought it.\"\nAt this friend's sitting of Jan. 30th, E, H. suddenly\nsays\nDo 3'ou remember a story I told you and how you laughed,\nabout the man and woman praying.\nSitter: Oh, and the devil was in it. Of course I do.\nYes, the devil, they told him it was the Lord who sent\nit if the devil brought it. . . . About the food that\nwas given to them. ... I want you to know who is\nspeaking.\nThe sitter feels quite certain that no one but himself knew\nof the correspondence, and regards the incident as a good\ntest of E. H.'s continued presence. Others will either favor\nthis interpretation of it, or explain it by reading of the\nsitter's mind, or treat it as a chance coincidence, according\nto their several prepossessions. I myself feel morally certain\nthat the waking Mrs. Piper was ignorant of the incident and\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 27\nof the correspondence. Hodgson was as likely to have\ninformed me, as any one, of the affair. He had given me\nat the time a vivid account of the trouble he had been in,\nbut no hint of the quarter from which relief had come.\nOf the other pecuniary message no written record exists,\nbut the sitter has acquainted me with the incident, which\nran as follows :\nTo assure Hodgson a salary, Mr. Dorr had acquainted a\ncertain wealthy friend (who believed in the cause and in\nthe value of the Secretary's work) with the situation of the\nBranch, and with E. H.'s reasons for not wishing to be\nindebted to the parent Society. This friend had agreed to\npay into the Branch-treasury the amount of deficit in the\nyearly salary-account, provided the operation should remain\nanonymous, and Hodgson should ask no questions. Hodgson\nagreed to this. But upon the first sitting which this friend\nhad after his death, the \" spirit \" of E. H. immediately\nreferred to the matter and thanked the sitter warmly for\nthe support given. The donor is of opinion, as I am also,\nthat Hodgson may have suspected the source of the aid while\nreceiving it, and that his \" spirit \" may therefore naturally\nhave thanked the right person. That Mrs. Piper's waking\nconsciousness should have been acquainted with any part of\nthe transaction is incredible. The donor's name had been\nkept from me, who was Vice-President of the Society, and\nhad yearly to know the accounts. I had known that the\ndeficit in Hodgson's pay was made up by anonymous American\nbelievers in his work, but had supposed that there were\nseveral of them. I cannot well understand how Mrs. Piper\nshould have got wind of any part of the financial situation,\nalthough her controls may have got wind of it in trance from\nthose who were in the secret.\nFew persons will ascribe the affair to chance-coincidence, but\nwith both thought-transference and trance-memory as possible\nexplanations, the incident cannot be deemed to furnish proof\nof Hodgson's personal survival.\nIn a later report I shall quote sittings at greater length\nand discuss briefly some of the control's peculiarities. The\n\f2S Professor William James. [part\nconclusions I shall then draw will probably not be different\nfrom those which I now draw as follows\n(1) The case is an exceptionally bad one for testing spirit-\nreturn, owing to the unusual scope it gives to naturalistic\nexplanations.\n(2) The phenomena it presents furnish no knock-down\nproof of the return of Hodgson's spirit.\n(3) They are well compatible, however, with such return,\nprovided we assume that the Piper-organism not only transmits\nwith great difficulty the influences it receives from beyond\nthe curtain, but mixes its own automatic tendencies most\ndisturbingly therewith. Hodgson himself used to compare the\nconditions of spirit-communication to those of two distant persons\non this earth who should carry on their social intercourse by\nemploying each of them a dead-drunk messenger.\n(4) Although this Hodgson-case, taken by itself, yields thus\nonly a negative, or at the best a baffling conclusion, we have\nno scientific right to take it by itself, as I have done. It\nbelongs with the whole residual mass of Piper-phenomena,\nand they belong with the whole mass of cognate phenomena\nelsewhere found. False personation is a ubiquitous feature in\nthis total mass. It certainly exists in the Piper-case ; and\nthe great question there is as to its limits. If, when lavish\nallowance has been made for this strange tendency in our\nsubliminal life, there should still appear a balance of probability\n(which in this case can only mean a balance of simplicity)\nin the view that certain parts of the Piper-communications\nreally emanate from personal centres of memory and will,\nconnected with lives that have passed away ;\nif, I say, this\nbalance of probability should appear decisively anywhere\nin the mass, then the rest of the mass will have to be\ninterpreted as at least possibly similarly caused. I admire\ngreatly Hodgson's own discussion of the Piper-case in Volume\nXIII. of our Proceedings, especially in sections 5 and 6,\nwhere, taking the whole mass of communication into careful\naccount, he decides for this spiritist interpretation. I know\nof no more masterly handling anywhere of so unwieldy a\nmass of material ; and in the light of his general conclusions\nthere, I am quite ready to admit that my own denials in\nthis present paper may be the result of the narrowness of\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 29\nmy material, and that possibly R. H.'s spirit has been\nspeaking all the time, only my ears have been deaf. It is\ntrue that I still believe the \" Imperator-band \" to be fictitious\nentities, while Hodgson ended by accepting them as real ; but\nas to the general probability of there being real communicators\nsomewhere in the mass I cannot be deaf to Hodgson's able\ndiscussion, or fail to feel the authority which his enormous\nexperience gave to his opinion in this particular field.\n(5) I therefore repeat that if ever our growing familiarity\nwith these phenomena should tend more and more to\ncorroborate the hypothesis that \" spirits \" play some part in\ntheir production, I shall be quite ready to undeafen my ears,\nand to revoke the negative conclusions of this limited report.\nThe facts are evidently complicated in the extreme, and we\nhave as yet hardly scratched the surface of them. But\nmethodical exploration has at last seriously begun, and these\nearlier observations of ours will surely be interpreted one\nday in the light of future discoveries which it may well\ntake a century to make. I consequently disbelieve in being\ntoo \" rigorous \" with our criticism of anything now in hand,\nor in our squeezing so evidently vague a material too hard\nin our technical forceps, at the present stage. What we\nneed is more and more observations. Quantity will probably\nhave to supplement quality in the material. When we have\nthe facts in sufficient number, we may be sure that they will\ncast plenty of explanatory backward light. We can therefore\nwell afford to play a waiting game.\n\f30 Professor William James. [part\nPAET II.\n1\n\" Believe me, I am not rubbish.\" The Hodgson-Control.\nRichard Hodgson had always seemed and felt so robust that\nthe possibility of his death had been thought of by no one,\nand no provision against it had been made. He had worked\nthe American Branch of our Society practically alone, for many\nyears, and although Prof. Hyslop and I were vice-presidents,\nwe had no minute acquaintance with details at the office,\nwhere Miss Lucy Edmunds, the assistant secretary, was now\nleft in charge alone.\nWhat was to be done about the Branch ? what was to be\ndone with its mass of records ? what with Hodgson's private\nproperty ?\u2014these were so many problems requiring immediate\nsolution. Last, not least, there was the problem of Mrs. Piper's\nfuture.\nThe question of E. H.'s property was easily answered by\nthe legal appointment of Messrs. Dorr and H. James, Jr., to be\nadministrators of his personal estate, he having left no will.\nThe great mass of Members and Associates of the Branch\nbeing inert and indifferent, the handling of the other questions\nfell to a small group of more acutely interested persons, of\nwhom Dr. Hyslop and I were the only ones with official\nauthority.\nAbsent in California for about five months, I found on my\nreturn that certain differences of opinions had been developing\nat home.\nProf. Hyslop, who had expended so much labor already on\nthe Piper material, wished, if possible, to secure the records for\nthe new American Society which he was founding. Others,\nwhose sittings had been of a peculiarly intimate nature,\nclaimed that the records of those sittings were their private\n1\nPart I. of this report was written to be read at the S.P.R. meeting in\nLondon, January 28th, 1909.

In some quarters an objection was felt to such a\nmass of American material going to England. One person\nprotested rather vehemently against the prominent part played\nby a certain other person in the deliberations. There being\nno one officially empowered to succeed Hodgson in taking\ncharge of Mrs. Piper's sittings, differences of opinion regarding\nher future relations to the S.P.K. had arisen.\nThere was, in short, a state of strain which I have to\nmention here, for the trance-utterances of that period refer to\nit, and its peculiarities must be taken account of in estimating\ntheir significance.\nIn the end, however, since we all had fair minds and\ngood-will, and were united in our common love for Hodgson,\neverything got settled harmoniously. Mr. Piddington was sent\nfor to represent the English Society; it was decided to extinguish\nthe American Branch, and to carry the Piper-reports to England,\npractically complete, while Hyslop's Society should take pos-\nsession of the other records ; workable arrangements were found\nfor Mrs. Piper ; the situation, in short, smoothed itself out,\nleaving nothing but a new system of friendships among persons\nwho before Hodgson's death had for the most part been\nunacquainted with one another.\nThe records of the Piper trance show that during all this\nperiod the \" controls \" had cognizance of the main factors of\nperplexity. There were, however, so many sources of leakage\nat this epoch that no part of this cognizance can be counted\nas evidence of supernormal knowledge. Whether in or out\nof trance, the Medium may well have come into possession\nof what was essential in the facts, and the gaps could be\nfilled by her imagination, either waking or somnambulistic.\nThe result, however, was that those who held sittings at this\ntime had a lively feeling that the control-personality they\ntalked with, whether Eector or Hodgson, was an intelligence\nwhich understood the whole situation. It talked appropriately\nwith Dorr about certain records not being made public ; with\nHenry James, Jr., about the disposition of K. H.'s books and\nother property; with Piddington and Dorr about Hyslop's desires\nand how best to meet them ; with Hyslop about his responsi-\nbilities and about mediums in whom he and Hodgson had\nrecently been interested : with Dorr, James, Piddington, and\n\f32 Professor William James. [part\nMrs. Lyman about whom to induce to manage the sittings\nwith more than one of us about a certain person who was\nunduly interfering, etc., etc. ; the total outcome being that\neach sitter felt that his or her problems were discriminatingly\nperceived by the mind that animated the sleeping medium's\norganism.\nMore than this\u2014most of us felt during the sittings that\nwe were in some way, more or less remote, conversing with\na real Eector or a real Hodgson. And this leads me to make\na general remark about the difference between reading the\nrecord of a Piper-sitting and playing an active part in the\nconversation recorded.\nOne who takes part in a good sitting has usually a far\nlivelier sense, both of the reality and of the importance of\nthe communication, than one who merely reads the record.\nActive relations with a thing are required to bring the reality\nof it home to us, and in a trance-talk the sitter actively\nco-operates. When you find your questions answered and your\nallusions understood ; when allusions are made that you think\nyou understand, and your thoughts are met by anticipation,\ndenial, or corroboration ; when you have approved, applauded, or\nexchanged banter, or thankfully listened to advice that you\nbelieve in ; it is difficult not to take away an impression\nof having encountered something sincere in the way of a\nsocial phenomenon. The whole talk gets warmed with your\nown warmth, and takes on the reality of your own part in\nit ; its confusions and defects you charge to the imperfect\nconditions, while you credit the successes to the genuineness of\nthe communicating spirit. Most of us also, when sitters, react\nmore, prick our ears more, to the successful parts of the\ncommunication. These consequently loom more in our memory,\nand give the key to our dramatic interpretation of the\nphenomenon. But a sitting that thus seemed important at\nthe time may greatly shrink in value on a cold re-reading\nand if read by a non-participant, it may seem thin and\nalmost insignificant.1\n1\nA striking example of this was furnished me lately by a manuscript which\na friend sent me. She had been one of Mrs. Piper's most assiduous clients.\nHer conversations with a certain spirit-control had been copious, fluent and\nveridical, and to herself so comforting and elevating, that she had epitomized\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper s Hodgson-Control. 33\nSomewhat similar fluctuations are noticed in the reality-\nfeeling which the records may awaken at different times in\none and the same reader. When I first undertook to collate\nthis series of sittings and make the present report, I supposed\nthat my verdict would be determined by pure logic. Certain\nminute incidents, I thought, ought to make for spirit-return\nor against it in a \" crucial \" way. But watching my mind\nwork as it goes over the data, convinces me that exact\nlogic plays only a preparatory part in shaping our conclusions\nhere ;\nand that the decisive vote, if there be one, has to be\ncast by what I may call one's general sense of dramatic\nprobability, which sense ebbs and flows from one hypothesis\nto another\u2014it does so in the present writer at least\u2014in a\nrather illogical manner. If one sticks to the detail, one may\ndraw an anti-spiritist conclusion ; if one thinks more of what\nthe whole mass may signify, one may well incline to spiritist\ninterpretations.\nThis was the shape in which I myself left the matter in\nmy recent preliminary report. I said that spirit-return was\nnot proved by the Hodgson-control material, taken by itself,\nbut that this adverse conclusion might possibly be reversed\nif the limited material were read in the li<dit of the total\nmass of cognate phenomena. To say this is to say that the\nproof still baffles one. It still baffles me, I have to confess\nbut whether my subjective insufficiency or the objective in-\nsufficiency (as yet) of our evidence be most to blame for\nthis, must be decided by others.\nThe common-sense rule of presumption in scientific logic is\nnever to assume an unknown agent where there is a known\none, and never to choose a rarer cause for a phenomenon when\na commoner one will account for it. The usual is always more\nthem in this manuscript which, she thought, ought to be published. Strictly\nevidential matter was ruled out from it as too minute or private, and what\nremained was ethical and human matter only. Never having known the\ncommunicator, and reading passively and critically, I felt bound to dissuade\nfrom publication. I could not believe that readers would find in the com-\nmunications a twentieth part of the importance which their receiver had found\nin them. The vital heat was absent, and what remained was ashes. I may\nwell have been wrong in this opinion, but the incident brought vividly home\nto my own mind the contrast between the inside view of the sitter, and the\noutside one of the mere critic.\nC\n\f34 Professor William James. [part\nprobable, and exceptional principles should be invoked only when\nthe use of ordinary ones is impossible. Fraud is a form of\nhuman agency both known and common, though much less\ncommon than cynics suppose ;\n\" personation \" is unquestionably\ncommon in the whole realm of our subconscious operations\n\" telepathy \" seems fairly established as a fact, though its\nfrequency is still questionable ; accidental coincidences occur,\nhowever rarely ; but \" spirits \" of any grade, although they are\nindeed matters of tradition, seem to have shown themselves (so\nfar as concrete evidence for them goes) nowhere except in the\nspecific phenomena under investigation. Our rule of presump-\ntion should lead us then to deny spirits and to explain the\nPiper-phenomena by a mixture of fraud, subconscious persona-\ntion, lucky accident, and telepathy, whenever such an explanation\nremains possible. Taking these Hodgson-records in detail, and\nsubjecting their incidents to a piecemeal criticism, such an\nexplanation does seem practically possible everywhere ;\nso, as\nlong as we confine ourselves to the mere logic of presumption,\nthe conclusion against the spirits holds good.\nBut the logic of presumption, safe in the majority of cases,\nis bound to leave us in the lurch whenever a real exception\nconfronts us ; and there is always a bare possibility that any\ncase before us may be such an exception. In the case at\npresent before us the exceptional possibility is that of \" spirits\n\"\nreally having a finger in the pie. The records are fully com-\npatible with this explanation, however explicable they may be\nwithout it. Spirits may co-operate with all the other factors,\nthey may indeed find that harnessing the other factors in their\nservice is the only way open to them for communicating their\nwishes. The lower factors may, in fact, be to a spirit's wishes\nwhat the physical laws of a machine are to its maker's and\nuser's aims. A spectator, confining his attention to a machine's\nparts and their workings, and finding everything there explicable\nby mechanical push and pull, may be tempted to deny the\npresence of any higher actuation. Yet the particular pushes\nand pulls which the form of that machine embodies, would not\nbe there at all without a higher meaning -which the machine\nexpresses, and which it works out as a human purpose. To\nunderstand the parts of the machine fully, we must find the\nhuman purpose which uses all this push and pull as its means\n\ft-viii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 35\nof realization. Just so the personation, fishing, guessing, using\nlucky hits, etc., in Mrs. Piper, may be, as it were, the\nmechanical means by which \" spirits \" succeed in making her\nliving organism express their thought, however imperfectly.\nAs soon, therefore, as we drop our routine rule of presumption,\nand ask straight for truth and nothing but truth, we find that\nthe whole question is as to whether the exceptional case con-\nfronts us. This is a question of probabilities and improbabilities.\nNow in every human being who in cases like this makes a\ndecision instead of suspending judgment, the sense of probability\ndepends on the forms of dramatic imagination of which his mind\nis capable. The explanation has in any event to be dramatic.\nFraud, personation, telepathy, spirits, elementals, are all of them\ndramatic hypotheses. If your imagination is incapable of con-\nceiving the spirit-hypothesis at all, you will just proclaim it\n\" impossible \" (as my colleague Miinsterberg does, Psychology and\nLife, p. 130), and thus confess yourself incompetent to discuss\nthe alternative seriously.\nI myself can perfectly well imagine spirit-agency, and I find\nmy mind vacillating about it curiously. When I take the\nphenomena piecemeal, the notion that Mrs. Piper's subliminal\nself should keep her sitters apart as expertly as it does, remem-\nbering its past dealings with each of them so well, not mixing\ntheir communications more, and all the while humbugging them\nso profusely, is quite compatible with what we know of the\ndream-life of hypnotized subjects. Their consciousness, narrowed\nto one suggested kind of operation, shows remarkable skill in\nthat operation. If we suppose Mrs. Piper's dream-life once for\nall to have had the notion suggested to it that it must personate\nspirits to sitters, the fair degree of virtuosity it shows need not,\nI think, surprise us. Nor need the exceptional memory shown\nsurprise us, for memory seems extraordinarily strong in the\nsubconscious life. But I find that when I ascend from the\ndetails to the whole meaning of the phenomenon, and especially\nwhen I connect the Piper-case with all the other cases I know\nof automatic writing and mediumship, and with the whole record\nof spirit-possession in human history, the notion that such an\nimmense current of experience, complex in so many ways, should\nspell out absolutely nothing but the words \" intentional humbug \"\nappears very unlikely. The notion that so many men and\n\fProfessor William James. [part\nwomen, in all other respects honest enough, should have this\npreposterous monkeying self annexed to their personality seems\nto me so weird that the spirit-theory immediately takes on a\nmore probable appearance. The spirits, if spirits there be,\nmust indeed work under incredible complications and falsifica-\ntions, but at least if they are present, some honesty is left in\na whole department of the universe which otherwise is run by\npure deception. The more I realize the quantitative massive-\nness of the phenomenon and its complexity, the more incredible\nit seems to me that in a world all of whose vaster features\nwe are in the habit of considering to be sincere at least,\nhowever brutal, this feature should be wholly constituted of\ninsincerity.\nIf I yield to a feeling of the dramatic improbability of this,\nI find myself interpreting the details of the sittings differently.\nI am able, while still holding to all the lower principles of\ninterpretation, to imagine the process as more complex, and to\nshare the feeling with which Hodgson came at last to regard\nit after his many years of familiarity, the feeling which Prof.\nHyslop shares, and which most of those who have good sittings\nare promptly inspired with. I can imagine the spirit of E. H.\ntalking to me through inconceivable barriers of obstruction, and\nforcing recalcitrant or only partly consilient processes in the\nMedium to express his thoughts, however dimly.\nThis is as candid an account of my own personal equation\nas I can give. I exhibited it in my treatment of special\nincidents in the preliminary report, and the reader will make\nallowance for it in what is to follow. In the end he must\ndraw his conclusions for himself; I can only arrange the\nmaterial.\nThe best way perhaps to do this will be to begin with\ncertain general characteristics, Hodgson's mannerisms, for\nexample.\nHodgson was distinguished during life by great animal spirits.\nHe was fond of argument, chaff, and repartee, a good deal of\na gesticulator, and a great laugher. He had, moreover, an\nexcessive appetite for poetry. I call it excessive, for it was\nanything but fastidious,-\u2014he seemed to need sonorous rhyme and\nmetre for his daily food, even if the quality and sentiment were\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 37\ncommonplace. All these traits were manifested from the outset\nin his appearances as a \" control \"\u2014some examples are given\nin my preliminary report. Chaff and slang from a spirit have\nan undignified sound for the reader, but to the interlocutors\nof the E. H.-control they seem invariably to have been elements\nof verisimilitude. Thus T. P. writes, a propos of a bantering\npassage in the record of Jan. 16, 1906: \"T. P. and R H.\nwere such good chums that he was saucy to her, and teasing\nher most of the time. E. H.'s tone towards T. P. in all his\ncommunications is absolutely characteristic, and as he was in\nlife.\" Similarly, Dr. Bayiey appends this note to a number of\nultra- vivacious remarks from E. H. :\n\" Such expressions and\nphrases were quaintly characteristic of E. H. in the body, and\nas they appear, often rapidly and spontaneously, they give the\nalmost irresistible impression that it is really the Hodgson\npersonality, presiding with its own characteristics. To fully\nappreciate this, of course, one would have had to have known\nhim as intimately as I did.\" 1\nFor these rollicking observations the control chose his sitters\nwell in accordance with his habits during life. This, however,\ndid not exclude very serious talk with the same persons\u2014quite\nthe reverse sometimes, as when one sitter of this class notes :\n\" Then came words of kindness which were too intimate and\npersonal to be recorded, but which left me so deeply moved\nthat shortly afterwards, at the sitting's close, I fainted dead\naway\u2014it had seemed as though he had in all reality been\nthere and speaking to me.\"\nThe extracts given in the earlier report or to be given soon\nwill show what I mean by Hodgson's rollicking manner. The\nlater communications show more of it than the earlier ones\nand it quickly manifested the tendency, characteristic in the\nmedium's utterances, to become stereotj'ped. Whatever they\nmay have been at the outset, they soon fall into what may\nbe called the trance-memory's \" stock,\" and are then repeated\nautomatically. Hodgson quickly acquired a uniform mode of\nannouncing himself: \"Well, well, well! I am Hodgson.\nDelighted to see you. How is everything ? First rate ? I'm\nin the witness-box at last,\" etc., with almost no variety. This\nhabitual use of stock-remarks by Mrs. Piper may tempt one\n1\nSitting of April 3rd, 1906.\n\f38 Professor William James. [part\nto be unjust to the total significance of her mediumship. If\nthe supernormal element in it, whatever it is, be essentially\ndiscontinuous and flash-like, an utterance that to-day belongs\nto the regular trance-stock may have got into that stock at a\nformer moment of supernormal receptivity. Supernormal\nreceptivity of some kind is certainly involved in the total\nphenomenon, but I believe that information that originally came\nthus quickly ceases to be supernormal. The control G. P.,\nat the outset of his appearance, gave supernormal information\ncopiously, but within a few years he has degenerated into a\nshadow of his former self, dashing in and quickly out again,\nwith an almost fixed form of greeting. Whatever he may\nhave been at first, he seems to me at last to have \" passed\non,\" after leaving that amount of impression on the trance-\norganism's habits.\nI will now cull from the records a number of extracts\nrelative to particular sitters, which show the control's familiarity\nwith their affairs, calling the first of these extracts\nThe Oldfarm Series.\nOldfarm is the name of Mr. George B. Dorr's place at Bar\nHarbor, Maine, where B. H. had often been a summer guest.\nMrs. Piper at the time of these sittings had never been at\nBar Harbor; and although she had had many interviews, as well\nwith Mr. Dorr as with Mr. Dorr's mother before the latter's\ndeath, it is unlikely that many of the small veridical details\nin what follows had been communicated to her at those\ninterviews. At Mr. Dorr's sitting of June 5th, 1906, he\nasks the B. H.-control for his reminiscences of Oldfarm :\n\" Do\nyou remember your visits to us there ?\nCertainly I do. One night we stayed out too long and\nyour mother got very nervous, do you remember 1\nMinna was there We stayed out much too\nlong. I felt it was a great breach of etiquette but we\ncouldn't help it ! I fear as guests we were bad [laughs],\n[R.

H.'s boyish delight in doing\nit and at the scoldings they all used to get for it next\nday, would naturally be one of the first things he would\nrecall, associated as those evenings were with people\nwhom he cared for.\u2014D.]\nAnd do you remember the discussion I had with Jack,\nwhen he got impatient 1 You were much amused !\n[His recollection of his discussion with Jack, who used, to-\ngether with M., to be at our house with him a great\ndeal in the old days, is characteristic. I do not myself\nremember the special occasion to which he refers, but\nthe incident, including my own amusement at the heat\nthey used to get into in their talk, falls in most naturally\nwith all my own recollections of that time. \u2014D.]\nAnd I remember your mother's calling me out one Sunday\nmorning to see the servants go to church on a buckboard.\n[I cannot now recall my mother taking R. H. out to see\nthe servants off on any special day, but he was with us\nmany Sundays, and I have no doubt that the memory\nof this is absolutely accurate, nor is it anything of which\nMrs. Piper might know,\u2014it is not the sort of thing that\nany one would have spoken to her of, or mentioned at\nthe trance. The buckboard is quite correct. It was a\nbig buckboard that carried six people and was the only\nwagon which we had big enough to take all the people\nup, but its use is not sufficiently universal at Bar Harbor\nto injure the evidential value of his recollection of it.\nAgain, the people used to go off from the kitchen,\nwhich is at an end of the house and cannot be seen\nfrom the living rooms or piazzas, so that his statement\nthat my mother called him out to see them off, while a\nsmall point, seems to me of value; and the event itself,\nwith the arrangements that had to be made to make it\npossible, was quite enough of a circumstance in our\nfamily life to make recollection of it natural. \u2014D.]\nI can see the open fireplace in the living room.\n\f40 Professor William James.

Do you remember where you used to sleep ?\nOut in the little house just out across the yard, where we\nused to go and smoke.\n[His recollection also of the little house is good. The only\nmistake in reference to it is in speaking of it as \" across\nthe yard,\" it being in fact across the lawn and garden,\nupon a hillside opposite the house. We always kept\nsome rooms in it for our guests, over-flowing into it\nwhen the house was full, and R. H. liked it better than\nthe house itself in the greater freedom that it gave him.\nWe used to close the house itself early in the evening,\nand R. H. was very apt then to go up to the cottage\nwith some other man or men and sit up and smoke\nand talk, \u2014often until quite late. \u2014D.]\nI remember the bathing and the boats and a walk through\nthe woods.\n[The bathing was one of the incidents at Oldfarm which\nR. H. would have best remembered. We used to take\nlong walks over the mountains and go down for a\nplunge when we returned from them. There were often\nthree or four men or more going in together when the\nhouse was full, and it was something in which R.

H.'s\nstrongest recollections of the place seems to me most\nnatural, while at the same time the piazza itself, which\nis not a conspicuous object in the house from without,\nand which was only familiar to my mother's more\nintimate friends, is not a thing which would occur\nnaturally to any one not familiar with our life down\nthere.\u2014D.]\nMr. Dorr then asks B. H. if he remembers a walk he\nonce took with a young friend from New York, where B. H.\noutwalked the other man and was very triumphant about it\nafterward, and whether he could recall the man's name. He\nalso asks him if he remembers the name of the man who\nlived in the farm house, where E. H. used generally to sleep\nwhen staying at Oldf'arm. Both of these names would have\nbeen quite familiar to E. H. in life. E. H. cannot give them\nand makes no attempt to do so.\nR. H. Names are the hardest things to remember ; it's extra-\nordinary but it's true. The scenes of my whole life\nare laid open to me but names go from one's memory\nlike a dream. I remember walking through the woods\nthere and sitting down and lighting my pipe and coming\nback late to lunch.\nOn June 20th, 1906, at a sitting of Miss Bancroft's, at\nwhich Mr. Dorr was present, the E. H. control suddenly\nwrites :\nDo you remember anything about Celery-root'? about\nC e 1 1 e root 1\nMiss B. (to G. B. D.)\u2014Do you remember anything about it ?\nG. B. D.

It was the Minturns.\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 43\nOh ! the Minturns ! [repeated eagerly and emphatically].\nThere was Gertrude and Robert, a brother named Robert\nand Mary. They lived in New York. I remember them\nwell. [Correct, save that Mary should have been May.]\nG. B. D. There was another sister, who used to walk oftenest with\nus\u2014can you recall her name ?\n[R. H. makes one or two ineffectual attempts, giving wrong\nnames.]\nG. B. D. Now, Hodgson, can't you tell me something about the lady\nyou were interested in, whose letters you asked Pidding-\nton to find'?\nThis was Hulclah Densmore.\nG. B. D. But there is no Huldah in the family, that I know, nor can\nwe learn of any. We have asked her sister, and she\nhas never heard the name of Huldah.\nWait a moment. Let me think. It is most difficult to get\nearthly memories. They go from one, but I find that\nthey come back to me as I think of things. She married\na [name of nationality given correctly]. If you will\nwrite to her, you will find I am right. Write to her !\nG. B. D. Did you want to marry her 1\nYes, I did. And I remember what a disappointment it was\nto me.\nG. B. D. Was she out of sympathy with your work 1\nShe wanted me to give it up\u2014it was a subject she did not\ncare to have to do with. [Correct as to the lady's\nanimus. \u2014W.J.]\nG. B. D. Was it at our house you met her'?\nI met her there, at Bar Harbor. Your mother ought to\nremember it well. She introduced us to each other.\n[Correct.\u2014I).]\nG. B. D. But my mother is on your side.\nOh yes, I had forgotten. It has troubled me over here,\nthinking I might have left her letters among my papers.\nSo I spoke to Piddington about it.\n\f44 Professor William James. [part\nG. B. D. I think you must have destroyed them. We didn't find\nany.\nI think I must have destroyed them\u2014I hope I did.\n[This \" Huldah \" episode is treated in a separate section of\nPart I. of this report, see above, pp. 20-\"26. \u2014W. J.]\nI recall the pansies your mother used to place over the table.\nI remember that well\u2014delightful to see them ! I can\nsee them now.\n[My mother used to have pansies spread loosely over the\ntable-cloth, when she had people to dine or sup with us\nat Bar Harbor, where we had a large bed of them planted\nnear the house so that we could get them freely for this\npurpose. The custom is not common enough to let H.'s\nstatement pass for a happy guess, nor do I think it likely\nhe would have spoken of it to Mrs. Piper, either awake\nor in trance. It came out quite suddenly also, and with\na positiveness which made me feel that it was a true\nrecollection, something seen at the moment in a mental\npicture. \u2014D.]\nOr. B. D., endeavoring to extract Bar Harbor names from\nPt. H., again tries to get that of the man who occupied the\nfarmhouse at which R. H. used generally to sleep when at\nOldfarm. He was not able to give that, but gave the name\nof the gardener, Miller. \" It is possible,\" Mr. Dorr writes,\n\" that Mrs. Piper may have heard of Miller's name as that of\nthe manager of my plant-nurseries at Bar Harbor. I remember\nI once meant to send her some plants from the nurseries for\nher garden, and think it probable they went. It is also\npossible that the name may have come up at the trance in\nmy own past sittings.\"\nI remember a beautiful road, a bicycle-road you made, going\nthrough the woods.\n[A dozen years ago I made a bicycle-road on my own back-\nland, which ran through the woods beneath a mountain\nover which we often used to walk. It was a pleasant\nand familiar feature in our summer life there, and it\nwould naturally be one of the pictures that would come\n\flviii.J Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 45\nback to K. H. in thinking of the place, \u2014like the view\nfrom my mother's balcony of which he spoke at the former\nsitting. But it is not a thing of which either' he or I\nwould have spoken to Mrs. Piper, whether in trance or\nawake. \u2014D.]\nG. B. D. then tries again to get the name of the man who\noccupied the farmhouse, describing him to E. H. without\nmentioning his name.\nOh yes, I remember him well\u2014I remember going off with\nhim once fishing\u2014going down the shore in a boat. . . .\nI remember one evening, and it impressed me so vividly\nbecause your mother did not like it, and I felt we had\ndone wrong and hurt her\u2014M. and I were smoking to-\ngether and we talked too late, and she felt it was time\nto retire\n[This would be remarkably good if the incident should\nprove not to have come up already in R. H.'s own\nsittings after M. died. She used to smoke cigarettes\noccasionally, and was the only person of the feminine\nsex whom I now recall as having done so at our house.\nUnless in possibly referring to this incident to her\n'spirit' at trances, after M. died, Hodgson would have\nbeen most unlikely to speak of it to others, \u2014certainly\nnot to Mrs. Piper, either in trance or awake.\u2014D.]\nG. B. D. Do you remember where you went with John Rich when\nyou went fishing with him\u2014Oh I forgot ! I did not\nmean to give you his name !\nJohn Rich, John, that is his name ! But I am sorry you\ngave it to me too\u2014it might have come to me. We\ngot a boat and went over to an island. Coming back\nwe had some difficulty in getting our fish in. We had\npoor luck in catching them, and then we lost them.\nAsk him, he will remember it, I think.\n[R. H.'s recollection of going off with Rich seems to be\ngood, as I think it over. That he should go off with\nRich only and neither alone nor with me or other guests,\nis exactly what happened,\u2014and yet not what might\nhave been expected to happen. His going to an island\nis descriptive also. \u2014D.]\n\f46 Professor William James. [part\nDo you remember what you used to put over your back\nthat had a cup in it 1 And there was a little brook\nwhere we used to stop and drink. And then I used\nto stop and light my pipe \u2014the whole scene is as vivid\nto me ! If I could only express it to you !\n[I used to carry a little canvas bag slung over my shoulder\nand a cup in it, when we went on long tramps. This\nmay be what R. H. refers to, though I think that he\nwas rather apt to carry a folding leather cup of his\nown in his pocket. The whole recollection is rather\nvague in my memory, going back a number of years.\nThe picture is a good one of just what used to happen\nwhen we were off on our tramps together, though of\ncourse what he describes would be always apt to happen\non walks through woods and over mountains. The\npicture of the little brook we used to stop and drink\nat is good\u2014I can see it now. \u2014D.]\nAfter some talk about the Tavern Club, about Australia, and\nabout the state of things in the other world\u2014some of which\nwill be noticed later, R. H. goes on as follows\nDo you remember one summer there was a gentleman at\nyour house who had a violin. I had some interesting\ntalks with him about these things, and I liked to hear\nhim play his violin. A little gentleman\u2014I remember\nhim very well.\n[This describes a man named von G., who was an excellent\nviolinist and who also talked interestingly on psychical\nresearch matters, in which he professed to have some\nfaculty. As R. H. himself was also fond of the violin,\nit seems natural that some memory of von G. should\nstand out now. That Mrs. Piper should have any know-\nledge of this gentleman seems most improbable. \u2014-D.]\nMy earthly memories come only in fragments. I remember\nquite well this little gentleman and how interested I\nwas in talking with him about psychics, and in his\ninstrument as well. I remember a man Royce visiting\nyou.\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 47\n[Prof. Koyce says that he has been at Oldfarm along with\nHodgson, but adds that that might be a natural\nassociation in Mrs. Piper's mind, since he thinks that\nthe only time he ever saw her was at the Dorrs' in\nBoston.\u2014W. J.]\nThis is, I think, the whole of the matter relative to\nOldfarm which the R H.-Control has given. The number of\nitems mentioned is not great, and some inability to answer\nquestions appears. But there are almost no mistakes of fact,\nand it is hardly possible that all the veridical points should\nhave been known to Mrs. Piper normally. Some of them\nindeed were likely a priori ; others may have been chance-\nhits ; but for the mass, it seems to me that either reading\nof Mr. Dorr's mind, or spirit-return, is the least improbable\nexplanation.\nThe fewness of the items may seem strange to some critics.\nBut if we assume a spirit to be actually there, trying to\nreach us, and if at the same time we imagine that his\nsituation with regard to the transaction is similar to our own,\nthe surprise vanishes. I have been struck over and over\nagain, both when at sittings myself and when reading the\nrecords, at the paralyzing effect on one's ready wit and\nconversational flow, which the strangeness of the conditions\nbrings with it. Constraint and numbness take the place of\ngenial expansiveness. We \" don't know what to say,\" and\nit may also be so \" on the other side.\" Few persons, I\nfancy, if suddenly challenged to prove their identity through\nthe telephone, would quickly produce a large number of facts\nappropriate to the purpose. They would be more perplexed,\nand waste more time than they imagine.\nI next pass to what I will call\nThe Owl's Head Series.\nOwl's Head was the name of the summer place of Miss\nBancroft, overlooking Rockland Harbor, in Maine, where Mrs.\nPiper had never been. E. H. had very greatly enjoyed visits\nwhich he had made there on two successive summers. Miss\nBancroft had been a sitter of Mrs. Piper's and was a convert\nto spiritism, with some degree of \" psychic \" susceptibility\n\f48 Professor William James. [part\nherself. At her first sitting after Hodgson's death, Feb. 19th,\n1906, Mr. Dorr also being present, the following dialog took\nplace :\n1\nI am Hodgson! Speak! Well, well, well, I am delighted\nto see you. How are you 1\nMiss B. I am all right. How are you?\nFirst rate.\nMiss B. I can scarcely speak to you.\nBut you must speak to me.\nMiss B. Will you give me some definite message 1\n?\nSurely I will. I have called and called to you. Do you\nremember what I said to you about coming here if I\ngot a chancel\nMiss B. Yes, I do.\nI wish you to pay attention to me. [The sitter and Mr.\nDorr were together trying to decipher the script.] Do\nyou remember how I used to talk about this subject,\nevenings 1 You know what you said about my writing\nI think I am getting on first-rate.\n[Everything accurate so far ! Miss B. can herself write auto-\nmatically, and since R. H.'s departure, has thought that\nhe might have been influencing her subconsciousness in\nthat and other ways. The words \" I have called,\" etc.,\nshe interprets in this sense. Rector, however, already\nknew of her automatic writing. \u2014W. J.]\nDo you remember what a good time we had at Head? I\nam so glad I went. . . . Do you remember a little talk\nwe had about the lights and satellites 1 Do you re-\nmember how interested you were ? Do you remember\nwhat I used to say about returning if I got over here\nfirst?\n1\nHere, as in all the rest of the records reprinted, I omit repetitions and\nremarks not connected with the recollections. Nothing is omitted, however,\nwhich in my eyes might affect the interpretation of what is printed. \u2014W. J.\n\fLVIII.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 4!)\nMiss B. Yes, I remember all that.\n[Accurate again. The \"Head\" must mean Owl's Head,\nwhere during two successive summers Hodgson had\nvisited the sitter, and been supremely happy. The\n\" lights \" refer to the lights of Rockland, across the bay,\nof which he greatly admired the effect, and at night on\nthe piazza he had often spoken about the planets and\nstars, and the question of their habitation. \u2014M. B.]\nWell, here I am, now fire away, now fire.\nMiss B. Can you tell me the names of some who were with you\nthere last summer 1\n?\nRemember Miss Wilkinson\n1\n?\nMiss B. No.\nYou ask me about whom ? Not understand. How are the\nchildren ? [The house had been full of school children,\nof whom R. H. was fond.\u2014M. B.]\nMiss B. They are well.\nGood ! Do you remember the day I walked across to the\nMountain 1\nMiss B. No, I don't remember.\nAsk Putnam if he and I\u2014My watch stopped.\n[For this reference to a watch stopping, compare pp. 11 and\n116 of this report. I suspect some confused memory of\na real incident to be at the bottom of it. \u2014W. J.]\nMiss B. Can you not recall something you did at the Head ?\nThat is just what I am trying to do. Don't you remember\nhow I had to laugh at you, laugh on that boat, about\nthat boat?\nThis last word, being wrongly deciphered as \" hat,\" Miss B.\nasks :\nMiss B. Whose hat blew off?\nMy hat, do you not remember the day it blew off? Yes,\nyou are not following me very clearly.\nD\n\f50 Professor William James. [part\nMiss B.

Yes, I think I do.\nI should say you did. Oh my ! but I am not so stupid as\nsome I know. I have not forgotten anything. Get my\nPoem ?\nMiss B.

H. went\nfishing in a gasolene launch, and on their return had\nmuch riotous laughter about some happenings in the\nboat. Miss B. can remember nothing definite about a\nhat, but is inclined to interpret the allusion as referring\nto this incident. The \"poem\" she conceives to be the\nverses \" It seems as if the wondrous land,\" etc., written\nat Miss Pope's sitting of Feb. 5th. See Part I. of this\nreport, p. 11. \u2014W. J.]\nOn the following day Miss B. had a second sitting, and R. H.\nasked \" How is Nellie ?\n\" [Nellie is a member of Miss B.'s\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 51\nhousehold, presumably unknown to Mrs. Piper, about whom\nE. H. always used during his lifetime to inquire.]\nOn the night of Hodgson's death, Miss B., whom I described\nabove as having \" psychic \" aptitudes, had received a strong\nimpression of his presence. She now asks\nMiss B. Yesterday you said you had \"called and called\" me. When\ndid you ever call me 1\nJust after I passed out I returned to you and saw you\nresting . . . and came and called to you telling you I\nwas leaving. . . .\nMiss B. Did I not answer 1\nYes, after a while.\nMiss B. What did I do 1\nYou arose and seemed nervous. I felt I was disturbing you.\nI then left.\nMiss B. Do you not recall another time when I was sure you were\nthere and I did something ? . . . What did I do at one\no'clock, Christmas morning 1\nI saw you, I heard you speak to me once, yes. I heard you\nspeak to some one, and it looked like a lady. You took\nsomething in your hand, and I saw you and heard you\ntalking.\nMiss B. Yes, that is true.\nI heard you say something about some one being ill, lying\nin the room. [Nellie was ill in my room.\u2014M. B.]\nMiss B. Yes, that is true. I also said something else.\nYou said it was myself.\nMiss B. Yes, I said that. Anything else 1\nI remember seeing the light, and heard you talking to a\nlady. [Correct.\u2014M. B.]\nMiss B. The lady did something after I talked to her.\nYou refer to the message, she sat down and wrote a\nmessage for me. [I do not understand what is meant\n\f52 Professor William James.

J.] 1\nThere was nothing more of interest from Hodgson at this\nsitting. Dr. Bayley, to whom reference was made in con-\nnexion with Owl's Head, at Miss Bancroft's first sitting, had\ntwo sittings in April, in which the hearty and jocose mannerisms\nof B. H. were vividly reproduced ;\nbut there was a good deal\nof confusion, owing to Dr. Bayley's lack of familiarity with\nthe handwriting ; and the evidential material, so far as the\nHodgson-control (whom we are alone concerned with) went,\nwas comparatively small. One passage was thus\nR. H. Get that book I sent you ?\nDjr. B. I received the book right, after your death.\n[Hodgson had addressed some books and some cards to be\nsent to friends as Christmas presents. They were mailed\nafter his death on December 20th. It should be added\nthat Miss Bancroft had at her sitting of Feb. informed\nBector that such a book had come to her, and Bector\nassociated her and Doctor Bayley as friends.]\nHave you seen Billy ? [My friend Prof. Newbold.\u2014B.]\nDr. B. No, have you any word for him ?\n1\nA propos to Miss Bancroft's \" psychic \" susceptibility, at a sitting on\nOctober 17th, 1906, which Mrs. M. had with Mrs. Piper, the following words\nwere exchanged :\nMrs. M. Any other messages, Dick?\nR. H. Not for him [the person last spoken of], but tell Margaret it was I who\nproduced that light she saw the other night.\nThe sitter immediately wrote to Miss Margaret Bancroft, with whom she\nhad recently become acquainted, to ask (not telling her of the message)\nwhether she had had any special experiences of late. Miss B. answered\n\"I had a very curious experience on the morning of the 14th. At four o'clock\nI was awakened from a sound sleep, and could feel distinctly the presence of\nthree people in the room. I sat up and was so attentive that I hardly breathed.\nAbout nine feet from the floor there appeared at intervals curious lights, much\nlike searchdights, but softer, and there seemed to be a distinct outline of a\nfigure. . . . This lasted probably from fifteen to twenty minutes . . . when I\nwent into a sound sleep.\"\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 53\nAsk him if he remembers the day we went to the seashore\nand we sat on the beach, and I told him how I hoped\nto come over here any time, only I wanted to finish\nmy work. And ask him if he remembers what I told\nhim about my getting married.\nDr. B. I don't know anything about it. That's a good test.\n[Proves to have been correct. \u2014W. J.]\nAlso ask him if he remembers what I said about the\nchildren of my old friend Pilly.\n[W. R. N. remembers R. H. telling him of a certain\n\"Pilly,\" but forgets about the children.]\nNo one living could know this but Billy. . . .\nI ask if you recall the fishing process.\nDk. B. Why, Dick, it will be very sad fishing without you.\n[R. H. and I had done much deep-sea fishing together, but\nmy supposition that this was meant may have deflected\nhim from some explanation of the \" fishing \" process of\nthe controls at the sittings. \u2014B.]\nI wonder if you remember Miss Nellie.\nDr. B. Perfectly.\nGive her my kindest regards. . . . Got your feet wet\nDr. B. Tell me more about that, Dick.\nDo you remember how I put my pipe in the water ?

Yes indeed !\nALL.\n\f54 Professor William James. [part\nBe. B. Who was along with us, Dick 1\nJess\u2014. . . I got it in my head. [Dr. Jessup is correct. \u2014B.]\nDo you remember the Head 1 Oh I think it was the best\nsummer I ever had. Best, best, best. . . . Do you\nremember laugh about Mitchell 1 Laugh ?

Of course I don't remember about your passwords ; but you\nwrote Mrs. Bayley a charade of your own making, and if\nyou can give the answer to that it will be a splendid\ntest.\nShoo fly, shoo fly 1 [It runs in my head that these words\nwere answers to charades propounded last summer, but\nI can get no confirmation and may be mistaken.\u2014B.]\nDr. B.

B.]\nMiss Bancroft had two more sittings, on Dec. 2nd and 3rd,\n1907. On Dec. 2nd Hodgson seemed to be cognizant of\ncertain changes in the Owl's Head place, that there was a\nnew wall-paper of yellow colour, a new bath-house, a new\npier and platform, etc., none of which facts Mrs. Piper was in\na way to have known.\nHe also showed veridical knowledge of a very private\naffair between two other people, that had come under Miss\nBancroft's observation. There was, however, some confusion in\nthis sitting, and E. H. was not \" strong.\" The results were\nbetter on Dec. 3rd, but the evidential parts do not lend\nthemselves well to quotation, with one exception, as follows\nMiss B. Don't you remember something that happened that you\nhelped us in 1\nI remember that one evening\nMiss B. What happened that evening 1\nWe got a little fire and I helped. Yes.\nMiss B. Yes, that is true.\nPut it out the fire I remember it well.\nMiss B. What did you tell us to get before the fire occurred 1\nBefore the fire ?\nMiss B. You told us to get something for the house.\nI said you ought to get a in case of fire pail,\nyes.\n[Here the hand drew three long horizontal lines, which\nmight have meant shelves, and beneath them the outline\nof a vessel with a cover.]\n\f60 Professor William James. [part\nMiss B. What are they for ?\nWater pails water pails yes, fire buckets fire\nYes, I did.\n[He told us in Maine, when we were experimenting with\nMrs. Austin by automatic writing, to get fire buckets\nand put them up on the shelves, which we did long\nbefore the fire occurred. He warned us of this fire many\ntimes, but no one seemed to pay much attention to it\nbut myself.\u2014 M. B.]\nMiss B. What did you tell us to put on them 1\nGo on you will find that I am not asleep.\nMiss B. I never thought you were asleep.\nSo much for the Owl's Head record, which, as the reader\nsees, follows a not incoherent thread of associated facts.\nFew of the items were false, but on the other hand it\nmust be remembered that a mind familiar with Hodgson's\nO\ntastes and habits might have deduced some of them (swimming\nand fishing, for example) a priori by combining the two abstract\nideas \" Hodgson \" and \" seaside.\" Leakages impossible now to\nfollow might also account for the medium's knowledge of such\nitems as the names Nellie, Jessup, etc., for her connecting\nDr. Bayley with \" Billy,\" etc. For the \" fire-buckets,\" \" watch,\"\n\" sincerity,\" and other items, it would seem necessary to invoke\neither lucky chance or telepathy, unless one be willing to\nadmit spirit-return. I should say that I have condensed the\nrecord considerably, leaving out some matter irrelevant to Owl's\nHead memories, some repetitions and all the talk that grew out\nof slowness in deciphering the script.\nDr. Bayley himself wrote me after his sittings :\n\" They are\npretty good, and have about convinced me (as evidence added\nto previous experience) that my much loved friend is still\nabout. I had had either four or six sittings, some of them\nin conjunction with Miss Bancroft, before R. H.'s death. I\ndo not think that Mrs. Piper normally knew me by name,\nor knew that I was from Philadelphia or that I knew\nISTewbold. I realize that the average reader of these records\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Piper s Hodgson-Control. 61\nloses much in the way of little tricks of expression and per-\nsonality, subtleties impossible to give an account of in language.\nAs I look over the sittings and realize my own blunders in\nthem, I cannot always decide who was the more stupid, the\ncommunicator, or myself.\"\nThe message given to Dr. Bayley for \" Billy \" (i.e. Prof.\nWm. B. Newbold) makes it natural to cite next the experience\nof this other intimate friend of B. H. Brof. Newbold had two\nwritten sittings, on June 27th and July 3rd, 1906, respec-\ntively, Mr. Dorr being present both times. On June 27th,\nafter a few words with Bector, Hodgson appears, and the\ndialog continues as follows\nR. H. Well, well, of all things ! Are you really here ! I am\nW. R. N. Hallo, Dick !\nHello, Billy, God bless you.\nW. R. N. And you, too, though you do not need to have me say it.\nI wonder if you remember the last talk we had together\nW. R. N. I do remember it, Dick.\nI can recall very [well all I said to you that glorious day\nwhen we were watching the waves. [Our last talk was\non a splendid afternoon of July, 1905, at Nantasket\nBeech.\u2014N.]\nI told you of many, many predictions which had been\nmade for me.

Do you remember something \/ told you on the boat going\nto Nantasket ?\nYes of course. Long ago you wrote me of your happiness\nand I wrote back and asked you if you were trying\nto make me discontented.\nW. E. N. I don't remember, but I have your letters and will look\nit up.\n[This allusion to my \" happiness \" is very characteristic.\nHe often spoke to me of it. \u2014N.]\nLook over your letters and you will find my memory\nbetter than yours.\nW. R. N. Like as not ! Like as not\nI have hoped to boss things on this side. [R. H. had often\ntold me of his belief that if he could \"pass over\" and\ncommunicate, many of the difficulties of the spiritualistic\ntheory would disappear. I can mentally see him now\nshaking his pipe at me threateningly and saying :\n\" If\nI get over before you, Billy, I'll make things hot\nfor you.\"\u20141ST.]\nW. R. N. Yes, Dick, so you did.\nTherefore if I seem bossy pardon me Bossy\nPardon.\nW. R. N. Go ahead, Dick, be as bossy as you will. I have nothing\nto say to you until you get through.\nGood. That's what I wish. I remember telling you how\nyou must not write more about your happiness.\nW. R. N. Did you tell me this on the trip or in the letter 1\nIn the letter.\nW. R. N. First-rate ! I have piles of letters. I will go through them.\nIf you do you will find it all. [I cannot find it in the\nletters. \u2014N.] Oh, I am so delighted to see you of all\npersons.\nW. R. N.

Yes, that's right, we wish a test.\nI remember how delighted I was with your experiences.\nW. R. N. You were !\nYou told me much about them which I recall most clearly\u2014\nrecall.\nW. R. N. Right ! [What follows refers to the trip to Nantasket and\nwas probably preceded by some reference to it on my\npart which the record omits. \u2014N.]\nYou and I had smoked [Correct.] until I got a dip\nW. R. N. Right\nand we walked along the shore\nW. R. N. Right, Dick !\nand waited until the boat returned. [We had to wait\nperhaps twenty or thirty minutes.\u2014-N.]\nW. R. N. Dick, what did we do while waiting 1\nWe took a dip and went to hear some music.\nW. R. N. No, we did not ;\nyou took a dip.\nI say \/ took a dip and you sat and watched me.\nW. R. N. After that what did we do ?\nWe went and got some let me think !\nW. R. N. I can't read that, Dick.\nA drink drink. I asked you to have cigar. Cigar\nand something else.\nW. R. N. That is true about the cigar. Go on.\nAt the moment I do not think what it was.\n\f64 Professor William James. [part\nW. R. N. All right, it is not worth the trouble.\nDo you remember anything about sausages I cooked ?\nW. R. N. Indeed I do ! Many a one you cooked for breakfast.\nYes, and how you laughed about them.\nW. R. N. I said they were the best I ever tasted, Dick.\nYes, I remember.\n[A passage is omitted here in which veridical reference is\nmade to a private subject of which we had talked. \u2014N.]\nI do not catch all you say, Billy, too bad. Speak\nslowly, old chap, and I shall understand. I asked\nyou about your [word undecipherable] and you said\nyou thought you were not half worthy of all you had\nreceived.\nW. R. N. Well, I thought it ; I don't remember saying it to you.\nYou did say it once in my room.\nW. R.N. I can believe it, Dick; I have thought it a thousand times.\n[A remark was next ascribed to me which exactly expressed\nwhat I had thought, though I am forced to omit it. \u2014N.]\nI gave you a long explanation of the whole modus operandi\nand you were a very good listener. Do you remember\nthe day 1\nW. R. N. I do not remember the details. I remember in a general\nway talking about it. [I recalled the details clearly as\nsoon as I had thought it over. The \" long explanation\n\"\nwas made in H.'s room in June, 1904.\u2014N.]\nAll right. Good, listen. And you and I met in New York\nand I advised you what to do 1\nW. R. N. Was it in New York or Boston ? In Boston, wasn't it ?\nYou and I went to the theatre.\nW. R. N. Certainly we did.\nAnd then to my club.\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 65\nW. R. N. Right, yes, that is right, Dick.\nAnd to my rooms where I cooked sausages and made tea.\nW. R. N. Yes, you gave me the first good tea I ever tasted !\n[Statements are here omitted relating to a person deceased.\nTrue on the whole, but not evidentially significant. \u2014N.]\nDo you remember that clergyman\nW. R. N. Try the last word again.\nWho was a medium in Philadelphia\n1\n?\nW. R. N. I do, I think I do . A clergyman who was an\nEpiscopalian.\nYes. Went into trance. Yes.\nW. R. N. Yes, I know what you are thinking of, but he was not a\nclergyman.\n[Word name perhaps written several times but\nundecipherable.

R. N. No, I don't remember that, Dick.\nYou have them mixed up in your mind.\nW. R. N. Very likely.\nI saw a young man who went into trance.\nVV. R. N. That's right, yes.\nAnd do you remember my opinion of him ?\nW. R. N. Yes, Dick, I remember your opinion of him. Tell me\nwhat it was !\nI thought he was hysterical and induced his trances through\nhysteria.

His ideas 1\nYes, all about it. The devil?\nW. E. N. He thought it was the devil?\nYes. The devil has nothing to do with it. I laughed when\nyou told me about it.\nW. R. N. Now, Dick, have you any more to say 1\nDo you remember the story I told you about the girl who\nsaid her prayers?\nW. R. N. No, I do not remember. Perhaps I might if you told me.\nYes. And when she got through she said she was sure\nshe thought the devil was prompting her prayer. [I\nremember no such anecdote. \u2014N.]\nW. R. N. No, Dick ; but I want you to tell me, if you possibly can,\nsomething I told you on the boat going down to\nNantasket, just before we got there.\nAbout your home-life ?\nW. R. N. No, it was about my work, Dick.\nOh yes, I recall you said you would like to give it up.\nW. R. N. No, Dick, I did not say that.

[Seemingly meant to suit my answer.\n_K]\nDo you remember our talk about hypnotism ?\nW. R. N. Yes, we talked about hypnotism.\nAnd hypnotising students. You said your mind was on\nyour work and how much you liked it.\nW. R. N. Yes, I said that. There was a lot more I said, but never\nmind it. Let it go.\nI will give it all eventually\u2014eventually. Yes. I am in\nthe witness-box.\n\fLvrn.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 67\nW. R. N. Poor Dick !\nPoor Dick ! Not much ! Poor Dick ! Not much ! Fire\naway !

You told me\nyou were working on some interesting work which you\nenjoyed better than anything you had done in years.\nYou said you would not give it up for anything !\nW. R. N. Right, Dick. Now before we got on the boat, to go out\nto Nantasket, what did we do 1\nI believe we went to the hotel and got some bite [word\nnot clear] to eat.\nW. R. N. No ! No !\nDrink [word not clear] No ! Do let me think what I\ngave you. I asked if you would get weighed.\nW. R. N. I believe you did. I am not sure now. Don't bother\nabout it any more. It is not worth the trouble.\nI did ! You said I and joked about your weight.\nDon't you recall 1\nW. R. N. I don't remember, but I often have joked about my\nweight and I dare say I did with you then.\nI remember drinking Yes, and I said I did not\ntake beer. Yes, you asked me, I remember well. I re-\nmember the water well. You smoked cigar, and I\nalso pipe [I smoked a cigarette, but not a\ncigar. \u2014N.]\nW. R. N. No, let us drop the trip to Nantasket, Dick. I think you\nhave told me all you remember about the trip to\nNantasket that you can.\nI have it surely right as it was the last time I saw you !\nI remember it as it was the last time I saw you.\n\fG8 Professor William James.

[Word undecipherable.]\nW. R. N. No, it's long since I have had experience in the writing.\nI understand. Therefore I am doing my best to make it\nclear.\n[The communicator now professes to report a conversation\nwhich I had with a definitely named person who died\nsome years ago\u2014N.]\nHe told me he did not approve or believe in your having\nanything to do with this subject.

When it was referred to the \"men who pretended\nto give manifestations,\" I doubtfully acknowledged it, supposing it referred\nto the so-called \"physical phenomena,\" especially those of Stainton Moses.\nThe objections upon which I used to lay most stress in my talks with H.\nwere (1) the astonishing ignorance often displayed with reference to subjects\nwhich the supposed communicators must have been acquainted with ; (2) the\nwhole Imperator group, its historical and philosophical teachings, its supposed\nidentity with the similar group in the Stainton Moses case and its connection\nwith the seed-pearls, perfumes and other physical phenomena which Moses\nprofessed to produce. To these objections H. could never give an answer\nthey are not here mentioned. \u2014N.\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 75\nWait a moment.

Go on.\nI remember we were together one summer and we went to\nthe woods or and lay under some trees and had a\nsmoke and discussed several problems. Where was it,\nBilly?\nW. R. N. Not with me, I think, Dick, unless it was somewhere in\nBoston.\nI think it may have been in Boston.\nW. R. N. Go on to something else, Dick.

By jingo ! that is true, Dick. It was ten years ago.\nDo you remember a woman named Wright ? [Name not\nclearly written.]\nW. R. N. No, not at this moment.\nDid I not tell you about her the day we were at the\nshore 1\nMV. R. N. Ah, Dick, I think you did, but I do not remember it\nwell enough to make it a good test.\nDo you remember my remark about the way in which\nthe name was spelled 1\nW. R. N. No, I don't remember it, Dick.\nAlso about her giving me some very interesting things ?\n\f76 Professor William James. [part\nW. R. N. No, Dick, I do not remember it.

That is just the word you used Dick. [I am not now\nsure the word was \"shake you up,\" but it was some\nsuch colloquial expression. \u2014N.]\nYes, I did.

Remember\nme to her. Adieu. \u2014E. H.\nSome persons seem to make much better \" sitters \" than\nothers, and Prof. Xfewbold is evidently one of the best. The\ntwo sittings of his from which I have quoted are more\nflowing and contain less waste matter, perhaps, than any others.\nIf the E. H. who appeared therein be only a figment of Mrs.\nPiper's play-acting subconscious self (compare E. H.'s words\n\"I am holding on to a figment\" on page 69 above), we must\ncredit that self with a real genius for accumulating the\nappropriate in the way of items, and not getting out of the\nright personal key. Not many items were certainly wrong in\nthese sittings, and the great majority were certainly right.\nIf two of the omitted communications could have been\nprinted, they would have greatly increased the veridical effect.\nProfessor Newbold gives me his own resultant impression\nin the following words :\n\" The evidence for H.'s identity, as\nfor that of other communicators, seems to me very strong\nindeed. It is not absolutely conclusive ; but the only alterna-\ntive theory, the telepathic, seems to me to explain the facts\nnot as well as the spiritistic. I find it, however, absolutely\nimpossible to accept the necessary corollaries of the spiritistic\ntheory, especially those connected with the Imperator group,\nand am therefore compelled to suspend judgment.\" 1\nAfter Dr. Newbold's, it would seem natural to cite Dr.\nHyslop's sittings, which were six in number during the period\nwhich this report covers. But he has himself given an account\nof them, with inferences,2\nso I refrain. It may suffice to say\n1\nCompare Newbold's previous account of his experience of the Piper-\nphenomena, in the S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 6-49.\n2\nIn the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, 519 West\n149th Street, New York, Vol. I., No?. II., III., and IV.\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 79\nthat Hyslop had already been converted, largely by previous\nexperiences with Mrs. Piper, to the spiritist theory 1\nof such\nphenomena, and that he held it in a form similar to that\nto which Hodgson had been led, supposing namely that at the\ntime of communicating, the communicating spirits are themselves\nin a dreamy or somnambulic state, and not in full possession\nof their faculties.\n2\nDr. Hyslop's sittings in the present series, although they\nseem to me to contain no coercive evidence for a surviving\nHodgson, as contrasted with the field of alternatives\u2014I doubt\nif Hyslop would make any such claim for them\u2014yet lend\nthemselves easily to the notion that Hodgson, in a somewhat\namnesic and confused state, was there. They pursued a train\nof ideas most natural for such as Hodgson to have followed,\nand they confirmed Dr. Hyslop in the theory which he had\nalready reached as the line of least resistance in these\nmatters :\n\u2014Hodgson was probably communicating as best he\nmight under the available conditions. He led the conversation\nback to his and Hyslop's earlier experiences, recalled the\ndifferences of opinion they had had over the proofs of Hyslop's\nreport on Mrs. Piper in 1901 ; alluded to a meeting which\nthey were to have had in New York if Hodgson had not\n\" passed over,\" and to what Hyslop wished to discuss there\nreminded Hyslop of some experiments on mediums which they\nhad made together in earlier days, and of messages purporting\nto be from II. H. which Hyslop was receiving through another\nmedium at present ; discussed other mediumistic persons, and\nespecially the aptitudes of a certain young \" light \" in whom\nHyslop was interested; sent a veridical message to Dr. ISTewbold\nrecalled a certain \" cheese \" of which he and Hyslop had\npartaken on a unicpae occasion together ;\ngave advice regarding\nHyslop's practical perplexities in the crisis of S.P.E. affairs\nexpressed his sympathy in the most appropriate fashion ;\netc.,\netc.\u2014most of this in an exceedingly scanty way, to be sure,\nbut with such naturalness of tone, and following such\n1\nSee his Report on Mrs. Piper in Vol. XVI. of the S.P.E. Proceedings.\n2\nCompare with this Mrs. Sidgwick's well-argued theory that they are not\ntrying to communicate at all, but that the medium in trances is able tele-\npathically to tap their minds in spots, just as she taps the minds of the\nsitters.

[part\ncharacteristic lines of association with the sitter, that the\nlatter's view was, as I said, only confirmed.\nA reader of the records, not having Dr. Hyslop's Mental\nApperceptionsmasse to interpret them by, might fail to find\nthem convincing. My own feelings towards these sittings is\nwhat it is towards all the others. The interpretation of them\nwill depend on that of the whole larger mass of material with\nwhich they belong.\nW. J.'s Sitting.\nThe evidence is so much the same sort of thing throughout,\nand makes such insipid reading, that I hesitate to print more\nof it in full.

Well,\nnow, tell me, \u2014I am very much interested in what is\ngoing on in the society, and Myers and I are also\ninterested in the society over here. You understand that\nwe have to have a medium on this side while you have\na medium on your side, and through the two we com-\nmunicate with you.\nW. J. And your medium is who ?\nWe have a medium on this side. It is a lady. I don't think\n.she is known to you.\nW. J. Y~ou don't mean Rector 1\nNo, not at all. It is do you remember a medium whom\nwe called Prudens?\nW. J. Yes.\nPrudens is a great help. Through Prudens we accomplish\na great deal. Speak to me, William.

Hyslop is going\nto, \u2014well, perhaps you can find out for yourself what he\nis going to do.\nF\n\f82 Professor William James. [part\nI know what he is going to do, and we are all trying to help\nHyslop, and trying to make him more conservative, and\nkeener in understanding the necessity of being secretive.\nW. J. You must help all you can. He is splendid on the interpreting\nside, discussing the sittings, and so forth.\nI know he is, but what a time I had with him in writing\nthat big report. It was awful, perfectly awful. I shall\nnever forget it. [Hodgson had tried to get Hyslop's\nreport in S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. XVI, made shorter, a\nfact possibly known to the medium. \u2014W. J.]\nThere is one thing that troubles me. Harry [James] asked\nme about a letter which he had received [at a previous\nsitting, from a certain C. B., asking whether E. H. had\ntried to appear to her since his death]. I have not got\nthat cleared up in my mind yet. It was regarding some\none to whom I have returned since I passed over.\n(A letter from a certain H 1 asking a similar question,\nwas here offered as an \"influence;\" and held on the\nmedium's forehead.)\nI did not return to C. B. Did you get her message?\nW. J. I have not got her message. Harry may have it.\nI also gave a message to Mrs. C. Did you gettthat?\nW. J. Either George Dorr or Harry must have got that. You\nsee I have not seen everything yet, having been in\nCalifornia.\nOh, yes, I forgot. William, can't you see, don't you under-\nstand, and don't you remember how I used to walk up\nand down before that open fireplace trying to convince\nyou of my experiments'?\nW. J. Certainly, certainly.\nAnd you would stand with your hands in your trousers\npockets. You got very impatient with me sometimes,\nand you would wonder if I was correct. I think you\nare very skeptical.\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 83\nW. J. Since you have been returning I am much more near to\nfeeling as you felt than ever before.\nG-ood ! Well, that is capital.\nW. J. Your \"personality\" is beginning to make me feel as you felt.\nIf you can give up to it, William, and feel the influence of\nit and the reality of it, it will take away the sting of\ndeath.\nW. J. But, R. H., listen a moment. We are trying to get evidential\nmaterial as to your identity, and anything that you can\nrecollect in the way of facts is more important than\nanything else. For instance, do you recollect a Churchill\ncase, Mr. Churchill, who came on from New York or\nfrom the West with some materials, and you and I had\nsome discussions ? I have just had that worked up in\nthe laboratory. Can you remember anything of that ?\nOh, yes. I had Osier in my mind also and I was preparing\nsome answers for that. [Piddington on May 2nd had\ntold the controls that some MS. notes of a reply to Osier\nhad been found among Hodgson's papers. \u2014W. J.] I\nthink perhaps you have heard about that, have you ?\nW. J. Yes, I have heard about that.\nWell, Sanger, or Zangler ? the clergyman, do you remember\nhim?\nW. J. No, I don't remember. [Impossible to identify. \u2014W. J.]\nDon't you remember a young man whom I was going to\nsee 1 I think I told you about it, William, \u2014quite sure\nI did, \u2014who was a clergyman, and who was afraid of\nhis condition, going into the trances. Don't you remember\nthat at all ? Ask Alice. Perhaps she remembers.\nMrs. J. No, I don't remember that account of the clergyman. I\nthink perhaps Hyslop may remember it. I remember\nsomething about dream-cases and what we called death-\nbed experiences. [Possibly the case mentioned to\nNewbold, see above, p. 71.]\n\f84 Professor William James. [part\nW. J. Yes, this clergyman had had some of those, had hel\nHe had had some experiences in dreams. And then there\nwas a case in Washington that I was anxious to look up.\nDo you remember my speaking anything about that'?\nW. J. No, I am not so sure of that. Do you remember a\nGower case 1\nOh yes, you recall that to my mind. And do you remember\nthe description of the man whose finger, \u2014there was\nsomething peculiar about his finger 1\nW. J. Yes, I do remember that. I remember that incident.\n[I seemed to, at the moment, but the memory has failed to\nbecome distinct. \u2014W. J.l\nWell, have you found anything more about that?\nW. J. No, I have not. If you could recall what kind of a case\nthe Gower case was, it would be interesting. [For this\ncase, concerning which R. H. had been in correspondence,\nsee Miss Johnson's report in S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol.\nXXL, p. 94.]\nWasn't that a case of hysteria ?\nW. J. No, not hysteria. He corresponded with you and wanted\nyou to come and see the phenomena. Do you remember 1\nI do remember a physical-manifestation case, and I remember\nan aural case,\u2014the voices came. And I think the Gower\ncase was physical manifestation, if I remember. [No\nvoices. \u2014W. J.]\nW. J. That is correct. Can you remember what the physical mani-\nfestations were 1\nWell, I hope I will not get these mixed up in my mind,\nbecause I have several that are passing through my\nthoughts. There was one where they had the table\nmanifestations, and they had also some experiments in\nknocking about the room after retiring. Do you remem-\nber those 1 [The table had moved without contact, but\nI fail to remember any \"knocking.\"\u2014W. J.]\nMrs. J. Yes.\n\fr\nin.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 85\nI think I had those correct in my mind, and then I think\ndo you remember the case where the hands appeared, as\nthough they were in phosphorescent light 1\nJ. I don't remember that case.\nI have those two now just on my mind at the moment. I\nthink they will come to you clearly presently. Now tell\nme a little bit more about the Society. That will help\nme keep my thoughts clear. I think, William\u2014are you\nstanding ?\nJ. Yes, I am standing.\nWell, can't you sit?\nJ. Yes.\nWell, sit. Let's have a nice talk.\nJ. The society is going to disband. Hyslop and Piddington\nand George Dorr and I have agreed to that, and we have\nwritten a circular, which we have signed, to the members,\nand I don't think there will be any objection. The\nAmerican work will have to go on apart from the English,\nwork in some way.\nW ell, then about Hyslop's society. I think he will succeed\nin that. I feel very much encouraged in regard to that.\nJ. I certainly hope he will succeed.\nI want to ask you if you have met at all Miss Gaule 1\nJ. Maggie Gaule? I have not met her. [A medium known\nto E. H. during life, probably also known by name to\nMrs. P.\u2014W. J.]\nI am very much disappointed in some respects. I have tried\nto reach her. [In 1908, Hyslop got messages from R. H.\nthrough Miss Gaule.\u2014W. J.] I have reached another\nlight and I did succeed in getting a communication\nthrough.\nJ.

Can you recall anything about that 1 It is very hard to\nremember those things.\nIt is sealed, if I remember rightly. Now wait a moment.\nThat is one you will find in the office \u2014in my rooms,\nrather\u2014and I think I left it in a book.\nW. J. This one that you just spelt out ?\nYes.\nW. J. Did you make that word up %\nI spelt the word, made the word up and spelt it out\nbecause I knew no one living could guess at it or hit it.\nW. J. It does not mean anything in particular 1\nNothing at all.\nW. J. Just a password 1\nYes. And the one I gave to you, I shall have to think\nthat over, William.\nW. J. Think that over, Hodgson. Think it over carefully. Take\nyour time and see if you can get it, because it is very\nimportant.\nI shall do so, and I want to do it in a way to exclude if\npossible the theory of clairvoyance. Now I want to ask\nyou a question, may I, while it is on my mind 1 Have\nyou ever asked Harry if he asked Dr. Bayley about that\ncharade 1 [Reference to a former sitting with H. J., Jr.]\nW. J.

J.]\nW. J. How did you get this message to her 1\nAppeared to her and thought she saw me. She put her\nhand up. She had just retired.\nW. J. What time of day was it %\nJust retired.\nW. J. Gone to bed ? Do you remember, Hodgson, any one by the\nname of H tl\nA medium ?\nW. J. No, not a medium, a friend.\nYou mean lived in Providence 1 [The letter was from a\nMr. H 1 in England.\u2014W. J.]\nW. J. No, I don't think he lived in Providence.\nOh yes, I remember Mr. H 1 who used to live in Pro-\nvidence and from whom I received a great many letters.\n[Unknown, as yet, to W. J.]\nW. J. Have you tried to have any communication with him?\nNo, I don't think I have. 1 think I shall try, though. I\nhave had some communications, you know, here. I have\nmet several people. But independently I have gone to\nvery few.\n[The conversation then goes on about the lost ring (compare\nPart I. of this report, pp. 13-18), and about the \" cheese \"-\ncharade. Then I, thinking of a certain pitfall which the\nchildren and I had dug for Hodgson, asked :]\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 91\nW. J. Do you recall any incidents about your playing with the\nchildren up in the Adirondack^ at the Putnam camp 1\nDo you remember, \u2014what is that name, Elizabeth Putnam 1\nShe came in and I was sitting in a chair before the fire,\nleading, and she came in and put her hands, crept up\nbehind me, put her hands over my eyes, and said \"who\nis it ?\n\" And do you remember what my answer was 1\nW. J. Let me see if you remember it as I do.\nI said, \"Well, it feels like Elizabeth Putnam, but it sounds\nlike\n'\nW. J. I know who you mean. [R. H. quite startled me here\nbecause what he said reminded me of an incident which\nI well remembered. One day at breakfast little Martha\nPutnam (as I recall the fact) had climbed on Hodgson's\nback, sitting on his shoulders, and clasped her hands\nover his eyes, saying \"Who am I?\" To which R. H.,\nlaughing, had responded: \"It sounds like Martha, but\nit feels like Henry Bowditch\"\u2014the said H. B. weighing\nnearly 200 lbs. I find that no one but myself, of those\nwho probably were present, remembers this incident.\nW. J.]\nDo you realize how difficult that is 1\nW. J. It is, evidently ;\nyet you were just on the point of saying it.\nIs it a man or a woman ?\nA man.\nW. J. Have you any message for that man now 1\nDr. \u2014not Putnam\u2014Dr. Bowditch !\nW. J. That is it, Bowditch.\n\"Sounds like Dr. Bowditch.\"\nW. J. It was not Elizabeth Putnam, but it was Charlie Putnam's\ndaughter.\nCharlie Putnam, yes. Now do you remember that 1\n\f92 Professor William James. [part\nW. J. But what is the name of Charles Putnam's daughter?\nOf whom ? Annie 1 Oh, she is the youngest. She is the\nyoung lady. And there was a Mary\u2014Mamie. [False\nname?. \u2014W. J.]\nW. J. But you must remember Charles Putnam's daughter's name !\nI have got it now in my mind. I could not think of it at\nfirst. Well it has gone from me at the moment. Never\nmind. That is less important than the thing itself.\nW. J. Do you remember another thing? We played a rather\npeculiar game. Possibly you may recall it. Had great\nfun.\nI remember playing leap-frog with the boys. Do you\nremember that 1\nW. J. Yes, that was frequent.\nYes, that is a very\u2014and then do you remember how I\nplayed bear.\nW. J. Yes, bear is first-rate. I was not there, but I heard them\ntalking about your playing bear. I remember one\nmorning you and I had a very\nWell, what you remember I might not remember at all.\nW. J. Of course not. You played so often with them that you\nmay have forgotten.\nBesides all that, I am trying to avoid things that are in\nyour mind if possible, to remind you of other incidents.\nWell, let me see\u2014-what were we playing\u2014we were\nplaying\u2014you remember at all playing marbles with the\nchildren 1\nW. J. No.\nThat is another game I played with them. [False.] Oht\nsuch fun, such days as those were. You say you and\nI were playing with them particularly 1\nW. J. Yes, perhaps that will come to you.\nThat may come to me at some other time. But all those\nthings you ask me about the children, \u2014well, that is\n\fxviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 93\nthe first thing I can remember. That is all right so\nfar as it goes. Now let me see what other thing I\ncan tell you that no one living knows but myself.\nDo you remember a place where we used to go, where\nI used to go and smoke? I used to go with Billy\n[my son..\u2014W. J.] a great deal, and it was high up.\nW. J. Doubtful.\nYes, do you remember that at all 1 By the way, how is\nBilly ?\nW. J. Billy is first-rate.\nHe has gone away, hasn't he 1 [Correct, but not evidential.]\nW. J. Yes.\nI think he is now on the right track and hope he will\nkeep so. Give my deepest love to him and tell him\nhow much I think of him and also the rest.\nW. J. Yes.\n[Some non-evidential matter here is omitted.]\nExcuse me, it seems to me you are peculiarly dull concerning\nmy affairs at my rooms. I suppose Harry knows more\nabout them than you do.\nW. J. Do you think it would help you to have the \" light\ntaken to your room there in your old surroundings ?\nDo you think you could get more influences and feel\nnearer ?\nPerhaps I could. I left everything so suddenly, I had so\nlittle time to make my plans and my arrangements. I\nsuppose you understand that\n1\n?\n\"W. J. Yes, indeed. Would it be advisable to take the \"light\" to\nyour rooms 1\nWell, I should rather come here and mention my individual\nthings from time to time and then take her there\nlater, . . . because there are many things which I wish\n\f94 Professor William James. [part\nto locate and point out and dispose of from time to\ntime and things I would like to mention. I wish you\nwould repeat to me those letters, to see if you have\ngot them correct.\nW. J. Zei vorn.\nThat is right. It is written in cipher, the one word, and\nwritten by itself, on a large sheet of paper, carefully\nfolded and placed in one of my books, and it is in\na book of poems I think, and I think it was Longfellow's,\nand the book has a scroll up and down the back, and\nthe binding is green in color, and I don't think any\none living knows that but myself. [Not found.\u2014W. J.]\nW. J. Yes, are there any particular things that you would like\nto have sent to Australia?\nI have talked that over pretty carefully with Piddington\nand I think those arrangements are already made.\nW. J. Yes, that is right.\nI wanted to recall, \u2014Alice, perhaps you can help me to\nrecall, \u2014what was that balcony where we used to go\nand smoke ?\nMrs. J. Why, yes, it was up-stairs, the upper story of the piazza.\n[If Chocorua were meant, Mrs. Piper had seen this\n\"balcony.\"\u2014W. J.]\nThat is all right. That is perfectly clear. She always did\nhave a clear head. . . . Now I want, \u2014William, I want\none thing. I want you to get hold of the spiritual\nside of this thing and not only the physical side. I\nwant you to feel intuitively and instinctively the spiritual\ntruth, and when you do that }'ou will be happy, and\nyou will find that I was not idling and was not spending\nmy time on nonsense ; and as I thought over all, as\nit came to me after I entered this life, I thought\n\"What folly! If I could only get hold of him!\"\nW. J. I wish that what you say could grow more continuous.\nThat would convince me. You are very much like your\nold self, but you are curiously fragmentary.\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 95\nYes, but you must not expect too much from me, that I\ncould talk over the lines and talk as coherently as in\nthe body. You must not expect too much, but take\nthings little by little as they come and make the best\nof it, and then you must put the pieces together and\nmake a whole out of it. Before I lose my breath, is\nthere any other question you want to ask me ? What\ndo you think of that bust, William 1 I don't quite\napprove of it. I think it is all nonsense. [On March\n12th Mr. Dorr had 1\ntold the 11. H. control that Mr.\nBiela Pratt had begun to model a bust of him for the\nTavern Club.]\nW. J. I do not know anything about it. I have not seen it. But\nit is a natural thins; \"for the Tavern Club to want of\nyou, they were so fond of you, all of them.\nI want to know, William, what is that you are writing\nabout me 1\nW. J. I am not writing anything about you at present.\nAren't you going to?\nW. J. Perhaps so.\nCan I help you out any?\nW. J. Yes, I want you to help me out very much. I am going\nto write about these communications of yours. I want\nto study them out very carefully, evei'ything that you\nsay to any sitter.\nWell, that is splendid. You could not have said anything\nto please me more than that.\nW. J. I am glad you approve of my taking it in hand.\nYes, I do. Of all persons you are the one.\nW. J. I'll try to glorify you as much as I can !\nOh, I don't care about that. I would like to have the\ntruth known, and I would like to have you work up\nthese statements as proof that I am not annihilated.\n\f9b' Professor William James. [part\nW. J. Precisely so. Well, R. H., you think over that \"nigger\nminstrel\" talk. [Compare Part I., p. 18.] If you get\nthe whole conversation in which that nigger-minstrel\ntalk was mentioned by me, it would be very good proof\nthat it is you talking to me. [He failed to get it.\nW. J.]\nWell, I shall do it. I want you to understand one thing,\nthat in the act of communicating it is like trying to\ngive a conversation over the telephone, that the things\nthat you want to say the most slip from you, but when\nyou have ceased to talk they all come back to you. You\ncan understand that.\nW. J. I understand that they come back.\nBut I shall give that out to some one here, you may be\nsure, and I hope to see you\u2014this is only the beginning,\nand I shall be clearer from time to time, but the\nexcitement of seeing you and all has been very beautiful\nto me.\nW. J. If you can manage to get a little more hold of the conditions\non the other side, it will be very good.\nYes, that I shall do. You must remember I have not been\nover here an endless number of days 1 but I wish they\nwould all try as hard as I have tried to give proof of\ntheir identity so soon after coming over.\nW. J. I wish you would more and more get Rector to let you\ntake his place. You do all the talking and let Rector\nhave a rest. And it would be much better, I think, for\nyou to take control of the light, and for me particularly.\nYes, that is a very good suggestion, very good.\nW. J. Because I want to write this up, and the time taken by\nRector is so much lost from you.\nBut he repeats for me very cleverly, and he understands\nthe management of the light. I want to speak with\nAlice a moment, and their I shall have to leave you, I\nsuppose.\n\fLVIII.] Report on Mrs. Piper s Hodgson-Control. 97\nMrs. J. Mr. Hodgson. I am so glad to know that you can come\nat all.\nWell, you were always a great help to me, you always\ndid see me, but poor William was blind. But we shall\nwholly straighten him out and put him on the right\ntrack. ... I am sorry to be off so soon, but I know\nthere are difficulties in remaining too long. They often\ntold me too frequent communication was not good for\nany one. I understand what that means now better than\never. I am going to look up one or two cases and put\nyou on the track of them, William, when I can com-\nmunicate here, \u2014at the same time repeat the messages\nelsewhere.\nW. J. That is first-rate.\nI think that is one of the best things I can do. Now I\nam going to skedaddle. Good bye, William. God bless\nyou. Give my love to the boys.\nAs I review this somewhat diluted sitting, the only evidential\npoint in it seems to me to be the anecdote about the Putnam\nchild (see above p. 91). The incident was very distinct in\nmy own memory, but seems to survive in no one else's. I\nwas hoping for another answer altogether, about a certain\n\" pitfall,\" namely, and this one was a surprise. Either tapping\nmy subconscious memory, or a surviving B. H., would be possible\nexplanations of it, unless it were more reasonable to assume\nthat some one had told the anecdote to Mrs. Piper at the\ntime, and that her memory was now reproducing it. Obviously\nthe reader's solution will depend on his sense of \" dramatic\nprobability,\" and that will differ with the line of his previous\nexperiences. For myself, considering the possibilities of leakage,\nimpossible to trace, in the whole case, I cannot be positively\nsure that Mrs. Piper's knowledge of this anecdote was super-\nnormal at all. The rest of the sitting, although quite, compatible\nwith the spiritual explanation, seems to me to have but little\nevidential force.\nThe same is true of the second sitting which I had a\nfortnight later. Much of it went over the same matters, with\nno better results. I vainly tried to make Hodgson remember\nG\n\f98 Professor William James. [part\na certain article he had written for Mind in 1885, and to\ngive the name of Thomas Brown, whom he had praised there.\nNeither could he remember anything about the American\nSociety for Psychical Research, as he found it on arriving in\nthis country. He rightly mentioned his brown dress-suit and\nhis broad-toed boots when questioned about his costume at\nthat time, but these facts were known to Mrs. Piper. He\nnamed a \" Grenier \" whom my son should have met at Paris,\nbut whom we could not identify. He insisted much on my\nhaving said of a certain lady \" God bless the roof that covers\nher.\" I trust I may have said this of many ladies, but\nE. H. could lead me to no identification.\nThe only queer thing that happened at this sitting was\nthe following incident. A lady had sent me a pair of gloves\nas an \" influence \" to elicit, if possible, a message from her\nhusband, who had recently committed suicide. I put the gloves\ninto Mrs. Piper's hand, naturally without a word of information\nabout the case, when \" Hodgson,\" who had been speaking,\nsaid, with a rather startling change of his voice into a serious\nand confidential tone, that he had just seen the father (known\nto us both in life) of a young man who a few years before\nhad made away with himself. \" I never knew it till I came\nover here. I think they kept it very quiet, but it is true,\nand it hastened the father's coming.\" The apparent suggestion\nof a suicide, even though it were another one, by the gloves,\nand the instantaneous change of tone in the communicator,\nforcibly suggested to me the notion that the gloves were\nshedding an influence of the kind called \" psychometric.\" The\nfacts given by E. H. about the suicide were veridical ;\nbut,\nwith the possibilities of leakage in the case, they cannot\ncount in any way as evidential.\nAfter middling or poor sittings like these of my own, it\nseems hardly worth while to quote a bad one, to show the\nfull range of the phenomenon. Were I to do so, an appropriate\none for the purpose would be that of Miss Anne Putnam.\nThere is no doubt that certain persons are good \" sitters\nnaturally, while others seem to impede the telepathic flow.\nOn certain days, also, communication may be less free.\nHodgson had sent repeated messages to the Putnams to come\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 99\nand talk with him, and he had been so extremely intimate a\nmember of their family group, that the best results might\nhave been expected. Miss Putnam's sitting, but for one item\n(see below, p. 114), was nevertheless extremely poor; and Dr.\nJames Putnam's was hardly to be called good, although he was\nintroduced to Mrs. Piper by name. The sitter's difficulty in\nreading the written record may perhaps account for R. H.'s\nlack of fluency in this latter case. There was one apparently\nsupernormal item which unfortunately I must omit.\nI will end my specimens by some extracts from two sittings\nof Miss M. Bergman [pseudonym]. Miss Bergman had been\nin previous years an excellent sitter, and was known by name\nto Mrs. Piper. She dwelt in another state, and her social\nconnections were not in Massachusetts. At her first visit,\nDecember 31st, 1907, the communications were in writing and\nshe had much difficulty in deciphering them. At the second\nsitting, January 1st, 1908, the voice was used and things ran\nmuch more smoothly.\nAt the first sitting E. H. quickly appeared, spoke of having\nseen two brothers of the sitter in the spirit-world (names\nknown to trance-personalities, and non-evidential), made a\nwrong statement about Christmas at the cemetery, and then,\nbeing asked to recall his meetings with Miss Bergman on\nearth, said\nI will. Do you remember one evening when I came to\nthe hotel where you were staying aud I sat and told\nyou of my experiences till it got very late and I asked\nyou if you would not [illegible] I told you so very\nmany jokes, you and Miss Pope were convulsed with\nlaughter over it. [Correct, Hotel Bellevue, Boston,\nMarch 1905.\u2014M. B.]\nAfter a while, Hodgson reappears, saying\nDo you remember my telling you about my German friends 1\nMiss B. No.\nPerhaps Miss Pope remembers.\n[I found later that Miss Pope well remembered Dr. Hodg-\nson's telling about his \"German friends\" and that it was\n\f100 Professor William James. [part\nthat which \" convulsed us with laughter \" the evening-\nhe had stayed so late when calling at our hotel. At\nthis point I had become so discouraged by the great\ndifficulty of reading the writing and the confusion in\nmaking things clear that I felt very indifferent and\ninert in mind.\u2014M. B.]\nBosh.\nMiss B. What do you mean by that 1\nYou understand well.\nMiss B. Bosh ?\nYes, I say bosh. BOSH BOSH\nMiss B. What do you mean by that ?\nOh I say it is all bosh.\nMiss B. What is bosh 1\nWhy the way you understand. It is simply awful.\nMiss B. That sounds like you, Dr. Hodgson.\nI could shake you.\nMiss B. How can I do better ?\nPut all your wits to it, you have plenty of them.\nMiss B. I will do my best. Go on.\nDo. Do you remember I used to chaff you.\nMiss B. Indeed I do.\nWell I am still chaffing you a bit just for recognition.\nMiss B. It helps.\nAmen. Now you are waking up a bit.\nMiss B. I am.\nCapital. So am I. Don't you remember I told you I\nwould show you how to manage if I ever came over\nbefore you did.\n\fLVIII.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 101\nMiss B. Indeed I do. [Sitter had often heard Dr. Hodgson say\nthis.] 1\nWell now I am trying to show you. I used to scold you\nright and left and I shall have to keep it up, I think,\nunless you do better.\nMiss B. I deserve it.\nIf you do not who does 1\nMiss B. You are your old self.\nOh I am the [two words not deciphered] I was. You'll\nfind it out before I finish.\nMiss B. Have you a message for Theo [Miss Theodate Pope] 1\nYes indeed give her my love and tell her I am not going\nto forsake her. I do not think she has been keeping\nstraight to the mark.\nMiss B. What do you mean by that'!\nI think she has been getting a little mixed up in her\nthoughts and ideas of us over here. I am the same\nold sixpence and I wish she were the same. I want\nto see her very much.\n[\" Theo \" had had no sitting for a long time, her interest\nbeing lessened by the circumstance that records of\nseveral sittings had not been kept systematically, as\nbefore Dr. Hodgson's death. At this point the hand\nwrote comments relating to circumstances which had\narisen in Theo's life since Dr. Hodgson's death. These\ncomments were singularly appropriate. \u2014M. B.]\nAt the second sitting, when 11. H. appeared, the voice began\nspeaking very rapidly and heartily.\nWell, well, well, this is Miss Bergman ; hullo ! I felt as\nthough I could shake you yesterday.\n1\nThe' bracketed comments in the third person are Ly Miss Bergman\nherself.\n\f102 Professor William James. [part\nMiss B. Well, I was pretty stupid. I think we can do better to-day.\nPlease repeat some of the messages you wrote and left\nsealed to be opened after your death.\nOne message I gave to Will. If I remember correctly it\nwas \" there is no death.\"\nMiss B. Who is Will 1\nWill James.\nMiss B. Are you sure you are now giving this quotation correctly\nas you wrote it?\nOf course I am. [There followed an outburst spoken so\nrapidly that the sitter could not get it down, declaring\nthat the speaker had not lost his memory any more\nthan had the sitter, etc.]\nMiss B. Did you leave other messages ?\nYes, another. \"Out of life\"\u2014how did I quote it\n\u2014\"Out of\nlife, into life eternal.\" ... I know positively what I\nwrote. I have promised Piddington to repeat through\nMrs. Verrall all the messages that I give through this\nlight. Every message given at this light must be repeated\nthrough Mrs. Verrall before any one opens any of my\nsealed messages. Mrs. Verrall is the clearest light except\nthis which I have found. Moreover she has a beautiful\ncharacter and is perfectly honest. That is saying a great\ndeal. [The reader will notice that Mis. Piper had been\nin England and returned, at the date of the sittings with\nMiss Bergman. \u2014W. J.] Do you remember my description\nof luminiferous ether, and of my conception of what this\nlife was like 1 I have found it was not an erroneous\nimagination.\n[The above words were spoken with great animation and\ninterest. The sitter, although remembering Dr. Hodgson's\ndescription of \"luminiferous ether,\" felt that she was not\nqualified to enter into a conversation of this character and\nbegan to say something else. The voice interrupted her :]\nIt is never the way to get the best results by peppering\nwith questions. Intelligences come with minds filled and\nquestions often put everything out of their thought. I\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 103\nam now going to give you a test. Mention it to no one,\nnot even to Theo. Write down, seal and give to Alice\nor to William.\n[Directions here followed regarding such a test. After these\ndirections the voice spontaneously took up another\nsubject.]\nYour school was\u2014[correct name given], was it not 1 [Already\nknown to controls, but probably not to Mrs. Piper when\nawake.] You are changing, your brother tells me, and he\nis very pleased. He thinks you are going to broaden out\nand do a better work. He is very glad. Do not under-\ntake too much. Make use of assistance in the work.\nMiss B. Where were your lodgings in Boston 1\nWell, now, that has brought back to my mind Boston\u2014.\nCertainly \u2014there were some doctors in my building\nGeorge Street \u2014no \u2014not George \u2014Charles Street \u2014I\u2014\nbelieve. Now let me see, Charles Street. Up three\nflights, I think I was on the top. [Correct, but known\nto Mrs. Piper.\u2014W. J.]\nMiss B. Do you know when I was at your lodgings ?\nYou were there 1 Didn't we have tea together ? [False.]\nMiss B. No.\nDid you come and read papers ?\nMiss B. No.\nDid you go there after I passed out\n1\n?\nMiss B. Yes. I went to get some articles belonging to you, and\ndid them up in rubber cloth.\nCapital, that is good. Lodge and Piddington consider it good\nwhen I can't remember what did not happen ! What was\nthe name of that girl who used to work in my office 1\nMiss B. I do not remember.\nEdmund\u2014Edwards\u2014I am thinking of her going to my rooms\nto read papers. [Her name was Edmunds, known to the\nmedium.\u2014W. J.]\n\f104 Professor William James. [part\nNow I want to ask you if you remember Australia, remember\nmy riding horseback 1 Remember my telling you of\nriding through the park in the early morning with the\ndew on the grass and how beautiful it was.\nMiss B. Yes, yes, I remember that very well. That is fine.\nI am Richard Hodgson. \/ am he. I am telling you what\nI remember. I told you, too, about my preaching. I\nbelieved I was in the wrong and I stopped. It hurt\nsome of my people to have me.\nMiss B. Tell me about your riding.\nI remember telling you about my dismounting and sitting\nand drinking in the beauty of the morning.\nMiss B. Tell me any experiences that befell you while riding.\nOh, I told you about the experience with the fiery horse.\nYou remember he dismounted me. It was the first\nexperience I had in seeing stars. I lost consciousness.\nI experienced passing into this life. I remember my\nbeing unconscious and recovering consciousness. I re-\nmember telling you this at the hotel.\n[Sitter's mind was filled here with recollections of how Dr..\nHodgson had once told her all this when talking with\nher at the Parker House in Boston, in 1 904. He had\nrelated just this experience and had said that when he\nrecovered consciousness after being unconscious for some\ntime, it seemed to him he had been in a spiritual universe.\nHe also told her at that time of his having given testimony\nin Methodist meeting as a lad in his teens, and after-\nwards giving it up because he became skeptical in matters\nof faith. This, he said, had troubled some of his kinsfolk.\n\u2014M. B.]\nMiss B. What did you use to order for luncheon when you lunched\nwith us at the hotel 1\nOh, I have forgotten all about eating\u2014m\u2014m\u2014I was very\nfond of protose.\n[The sitter did not have \" protose \" in mind, but remembers\nDr. Hodgson sometimes askiug the waiter for one of the\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 105\nprepared breakfast foods, but does not recall its name.\n\u2014M. B.]\nWhen I found the light it looked like a tremendous window,\nopen window. The canopy \u2014do you remember how they\nused to talk about the canopy 1 It is an ethereal veil.\nIf your spiritual eyes were open you could see through\nthis veil and see me here talking to you perfectly.\n[The sitter did not care to talk about this, although she\nremembered perfectly Dr. Hodgson's telling her \"how\nthey talked about the canopy,\" so she asked a question\nreferring to the intimate personal affairs of one of her\nfriends. The replies showed a strange knowledge of the\ncircumstances known only to the sitter and her friend,\nand were entirely a propos. The voice then went on\nspeaking, and burst out with what follows, in a tone of\nmingled indignation and amusement:]\nWill thinks I ought to walk into the room bodily and shake\nhands with him. I heard him say \" Hodgson isn't so\nmuch of a power on the other side.\" What does he\nthink a man in the ethereal body is going to do with a\nman in the physical body 1 [Seems to show some super-\nnormal knowledge of the state of my mind.\u2014W. J.]\nMiss B. To whom did you speak first from that world?\nTheodate, yes, Theodate, she was the one to whom I first\nspoke. [Correct.]\n[The sitter now asked to talk with another spirit, and reply\nwas made that R. H. would continue talking until he\ncame. E. H. did this by again referring to the accident\nin the park. He spoke of being seated when he first\ntold us of the incident, and of getting up and walking\naround the room as he talked. He said it chanced that\nthis incident had been told to few people, and again\ndwelt upon having seen stars after falling, having been\nunconscious, having had visions while unconscious, as if\nthe spirit had left the body and passed into another\nworld. All of this corresponded exactly with fact. Dr.\nHodgson had commenced the story seated, and had risen\nand walked about as he talked. \u2014M. B.]\n\f106 Professor William James. [part\nThe accurate knowledge thus displayed of E. H.'s conversa-\ntions at the hotels in Boston where the ladies stayed, seems\nto me one of the most evidential items in the whole series.\nIt is improbable that such unimportant conversations should\nhave been reported by the living E. H. to Mrs. Piper, either\nawake or when in trance with other sitters ; and to my mind\nthe only plausible explanation is supernormal. Either it spells\n'\nspirit-return,' or telepathic reading of the sitter's mind by\nthe medium in trance.\nI now pass to E. H.'s\nAustralian Eecollections.\nE. H. has sent many messages, both of affection and for test\npurposes, to his sister Annie in Australia. Mrs. M., Mr.\nPiddington, my wife, myself, Mr. Dorr, Miss Pope, Miss Hillard,\nall received such messages, which were duly transmitted to\nthe sister, on whose replies what follows is based. Some of\nthese messages were too general to serve as good tests {e.g. \" Do\nyou remember my reading Fenimore Cooper ?\n\") ; some had\nbeen spoken of at previous trances (e.g. \" Cousin Fred Hyde,\"\n\" Q,\" \" fly-the-garter,\" etc. Compare report of Hodgson's own\nsittings in S.P.E. Proceedings. Vol. VIII., pp. 60-67); some\nawoke no corresponding memory in Miss Hodgson.

Miss Annie\nHodgson writes of the whole collection of messages sent to\nher :\n\" To my mind there is nothing striking in any of the\nstatements.\" She propounded in turn three test-questions of\nher own to which no answer was forthcoming ; and E. H.,\nquestioned by a sitter, couldn't remember the name of his\nschoolmaster in Melbourne. In interpreting responsibly these\nAustralian messages, tapping the mind of the sitters and normal\nacquaintance with the facts on Mrs. Piper's part 1\nmust probably\n]\nI wrote to Mrs. Piper for the names of H.'s Australian relatives. Here is\nher answer, which I take to be sincere\n\"Boston, Jan. 11, 1909. Dear Mr. James, \u2014In replying to your letter of\nthis morning I will say I am very sorry I cannot help you in finding Dr.\nHodgson's relatives in Australia, as I do not know any of them or anything\nabout them, except that he had one sister whose Christian name was Annie,\nand this was unknown to me until some time after Dr. Hodgson's death.\nMrs. [Lyman] might be able to tell you, as it was she who told me. She had\nsome photographs of Dr. H. which I admired, and she said she would give me\none later, but those she had she was going to send to his sister Annie in\nAustralia. I was struck by the familiarity with which she used the name\nand concluded that she must have known her. Dr. Hodgson never talked with\nme about his relatives or anybody else's ; on the contrary he most carefully\navoided all such subjects when talking with me. I haven't the slightest idea\nwho 'Q.' was, I have never heard the name so far as I am aware.\n\"I am sure my daughters do not know any more than I do about Dr. Hodgson's\nfamily. \u2014I am very sincerely yours, L. E. Piper.\"\n\f108 Professor William James. [part\nbe excluded as explanations. If a naturalistic interpretation\nwere insisted on, fictitious construction of incidents probable in\nany boyhood, and accidental coincidence of a certain number\nof these with fact, would have to be chiefly relied upon.\nAgainst fictitious construction is the fact that almost none of\nthe names that had figured in Hodgson's own sittings in 1887\nand 1888 (S.P.E. Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 60-67) were used\nfor reproduction. \" Enid,\" \" Ellen,\" \" Eric,\" were added rightly ;\nand the three names of \" Q.\" (Hodgson had apparently given\nonly the first one to Phinuit\u2014see loc. cit., p. 60) slipped out\nin full, as it were inadvertently, on May 29th, 1906, Hodgson\ninsisting at the same time that her identity must never be\nrevealed to the outside world. The possibility that Hodgson\nhad given \" Q.'s \" entire name to later controls than Phinuit\ncannot, however, be eliminated.\nOn the whole this series baffles me as much as the rest.\nIt may be spirit-return ! it may be something else ! Leaks of\nvarious sorts are so probable that no sharp conclusion can be\ndrawn.\nI think that by this time the reader has enough documentary\nmaterial to gain an adequate impression of the case. Additional\ncitations of sittings would introduce no new factors of solution.\nThe entire lot of reports, read verbatim, would, it is true, give\na greater relative impression of hesitation, repetition, and boggling\ngenerally ; and the \" rigorously scientific \" mind would of course\nrejoice to find its own explanatory category, \" Bosh,\" greatly\nconfirmed thereby. But the more serious critic of the records\nwill hold his judgment in suspense ;\nor, if he inclines to the\nspiritistic solution, it will be because an acquaintance with the\nphenomenon on a much larger scale has altered the balance\nof presumptions in his mind, and because spirit-return has\ncome to seem no impermissible thing to his sense of the\nnatural dramatic probabilities.\nBefore indulging in some final reflections of my own on\nNature's possibilities, I will cite a few additional evidential\npoints. I will print them in no order, numbering them as\nthey occur.\n(1) Eirst of all, several instances of knowledge that was\nveridical and seemed unquestionably supernormal. These were\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-Control. 109\nconfidential remarks, some of which naturally won't bear quota-\ntion. One of them, plausible after the fact, could hardly have\nbeen thought of by any one before it. Another would, I think,\nhardly have been constructed by Mrs. Piper. A third was to\nthe effect that E. H. thought now differently about a certain\nlady\u2014she was less \" selfish \" than he had called her in a\ncertain private conversation of which he reminded the sitter.\n(2) Again, there was intense solicitude shown about keeping\nthe records of a certain former sitter from publicity. It\nsounded very natural and Hodgsonian, but the trance-Mrs.\nPiper might also have deemed it necessary.\n(3) The following incident belongs to my wife's and Miss\nPutnam's sitting of June 12th, 1906 :\u2014Mrs. J. said: \"Do\nyou remember what happened in our library one night when\nyou were arguing with Margie [Mrs. J.'s sister] ?\n\"\u2014\" I had\nhardly said '\nremember ',\" she notes, \" in asking this question,\nwhen the medium's arm was stretched out and the fist shaken\nthreateningly,\" then these words came\nR. H. Yes, I did this in her face. I couldn't help it. She was so\nimpossible to move. It was wrong of me, but I couldn't\nhelp it.\n[I myself well remember this fist-shaking incident, and how\nwe others laughed over it after Hodgson had taken his leave.\nWhat had made him so angry was my sister-in-law's defence\nof some slate-writing she had seen in California.\u2014W. J.]\n1\n1\nPrima facie, the following incident also sounds evidential:\nR. H. Ask Margie if she remembers chaffing me about sitting up late to\nentertain people.\nThis happened, as I well remember, at Chocorua, but at this distance of\ntime it is impossible to be sure whether it was not on the occasion when\nHodgson and Mrs. Piper were there as visitors together. The evidence is\ntherefore \"leaky.\"\nAnother case of leaky evidence is the following, which prima facie seems\nstriking enough :\nIn Hodgson's rooms a quantity of MS. was found, in a cipher probably\ninvented by himself. In the sitting of Jan. 23rd, this cipher was spontaneously\nmentioned by the control :\nR. H. Is this the Piper-case ? the Piper phenomenon ? . . . There are some\nprivate records which I should not wish to have handled. Let\nGeorge and Piddington go through them and return them. The\n\f110 Professor William James. [part\n(4) At a written sitting at which I was present (July 29th,\n1907) the following came:\nYou seem to think I have lost my equilibrium. Nothing of\nthe sort.\nW. J. You've lost your handwriting, gone from bad to worse.\nI never had any to lose.\nMrs. M. It was a perfectly beautiful handwriting [ironical].\nAhem ! Ahem ! William, do you remember my writing\nyou a long letter once when you were ill ? You had\nto get Margaret [my daughter\u2014W.

How I laughed over that, but I was\nreally sorry to make you wade through it. Ask Mar-\ngaret if she remembers it. [Perfectly\u2014it was in London.\n\u2014M. M.

H., came out at a sitting of Miss Pope's on\nFeb. 7th, 1906.\nI am not going to make a botch of anything if I can help\nit. Not I. Do you remember my telling you what I\nwould do if I got over here first.\nMiss P. You said several things about it.\nI said if I couldn't do better than some of them I was\nmistaken.

Of course I remember.\ncipher\u2014let Harry and George take care of them. That was my\ncipher and no one living can read it. I shall explain it later.\n[He never has explained it, though it was spoken of later several\ntimes.]\nI think it probable here that a question about the cipher from the sitter,\npreceding the control's reference to it, has been accidentally omitted from\nthe record. If so, there is nothing remarkable in the incident. The record\nwas not stenographic, and neither my wife nor the son who took the notes,\nis now confident that the cjuestion was not asked.\n\flviii.] Re-port on Mrs. Piper s Hodgson-Control. 1 1\nDo you remember a story I told you about my old\nfriend Sidgwick 1 Don't you remember how I imitated\nhim 1\nMiss P. Yes, what word did you say about Sidgwick % [I had not\ndeciphered the word \"imitated.\"\u2014T. P.]\nIf I believed in it they would say I was in the trick.\n[Still not understanding, T. P. said :]\nMiss P. What about Sidgwick?\nI imitated him.\nMiss P. What did you do 1\nI said s-s-s-should-be i-n th-e t-r-i-c-k.\nMiss P. I remember perfectly, that's fine.\nNo one living could know this but yourself and Mary Bergman.\n[It was most interesting to see the hand write these words\nto imitate stuttering, and then for the first time it\nflashed over me what he had some time ago told Mary\nand me about Sidgwick, imitating at the same time\nSidgwick's stammer :\n\" H-Hodgson, if you b-b-believe in\nit, you'll b-be said to be in the t-trick.\" I cannot\nquote the exact words, but this is very nearly right.\nSidgwick referred to Hodgson's belief that he was actually\ncommunicating, through Mrs. Piper, with spirits. He\nmeant that people not only would not believe what\nHodgson gave as evidence, but would think he was in\ncollusion with Mrs. Piper. \u2014T. P.]\n(6) At a sitting of Miss Pope's and mine, Oct. 24th, 1906,\nE. H. said of Miss P.\n\u2014\" She goes on and puts on bays and\npiazzas, changes her piazzas, her house, makes it all over\nagain.\" As this was literally true, and as no one in Boston\ncould well have known about it, it seemed like mind-reading.\n[E. H.'s saying is possibly explained, however, by a previous\nsitting (April 16 th) of Miss Pope's, in which another of\nMrs. Piper's controls had already of his own accord made\nthe same veridical remark, so that the fact had got, however\ninexplicably, into the trance-consciousness, and could be used\nby the controls indiscriminately.]\n\f112 Professor William James. [part\n(7) On Jan. 30, 1906, Mrs. M. had a sitting. Mrs. M.\nsaid\nDo you remember our last talk together, at N., and how,\nin coming home we talked about the work 1\n(R. H.) Yes, yes.\nMks. M. And I said if we had a hundred thousand dollars\nBuying Billy !\nMrs. M. Yes, Dick, that was it\n\u2014\" buying Billy.\"\nBuying only Billy 1\nMrs. M. Oh no\u2014I wanted Schiller too. How well you remember\nMrs. M., before E. H.'s death, had had dreams of extending\nthe American Branch's operations by getting an endowment,\nand possibly inducing Prof. Newbold (Billy) and Dr. Schiller to\nco-operate in work. She naturally regards this veridical recall,\nby the control, of a private conversation she had had with\nHodgson as very evidential of his survival.\n(8) To the same sitter, on a later occasion (March 5th,\n1906), the control showed veridical knowledge of R. H.'s pipes,\nof which two had been presents from herself. She asks him\nat this sitting about the disposal of some of his effects. He\nmentions books and photographs in a general way, then says\nI want Tom [his brother] to have my pipes, all except\nany that nry friends wish.\nMrs. M.

The last one I gave you.\nLast season, last season, yes.\nMrs. M. A year or two ago, I think it was.\nI recall it well. You gave me what I call a briar pipe. [A\nnumber of years ago I gave R.

The one I mean was an odd-looking pipe.\nI know it well, a big large bowl.\nMrs. M. Wasn't that the meerschaum?\nYes, Billy is to have it.

I mean the pipe bowl.\n[I had seen such a pipe, the whole thing a face, at the\nCharles Street rooms a short time before. I never\nremember seeing Mr. Hodgson use it. The pipe of\nwhich I was thinking was a carved Swiss pipe which\nhe evidently does not remember. \u2014M.]\n(9) Among my own friends in the Harvard faculty who\nhad \" passed over \" the most intimate was F. J. Child.\nHodgson during life had never met Professor Child. It looks\nto me like a supernormal reading of my own mental states (for I\nhad often said that the best argument I knew for an immortal\nlife was the existence of a man who deserved one as well\nas Child did) that a message, to me about him should have\nbeen spontaneously produced by the E. H. control. I had\nassuredly never mentioned C. to Mrs. Piper, had never before\nH\n\f114 Professor William James. [part\nhad a message from his spirit, and if I had expressed my\nfeelings about him to the living E. H., that would make the\nmatter only more evidential.\nThe message through E. H. came to Miss Bobbins, June\n6th, 1906.\nThere is a man named Child passed out suddenly, wants to\nsend his love to William and his wife in the body.\nMiss R. Child's wife ?\nYes, in the body. He says ... I hope L. will understand\nwhat I mean. I [i.e. E. H.] don't know who L. is.\n[L. is the initial of the Christian name of Professor\nChild's widow.\u2014W. J.]\n(10) Miss Putnam had been consulted about the disposition\nof certain matters left undone by Hodgson at the date of his\ndeath. At her sitting, much later, these words came out. I\ncopy the record as it stands\nR. H. Did you get my Christmas present 1 [A calendar addressed\nby him to me before his death. \u2014A. C. P.] I heard\nyou in the body say you didn't want them sent. [Mr.\nHodgson had left some Christmas cards addressed, but\nunenclosed. I had expressed unwillingness to mail them\nunenveloped. \u2014A. C.

You loaned it to me at C .\nI remember, but you have it still\nMrs. M. I returned it to you.\nYes, but isn't it the one I loaned you 1 And the poems I\nused to love so well, I recall. [The book contained\npoems copied or composed by Hodgson, and after having\nbeen returned to him ere he died, had been taken from\namong his effects and brought to the sitting by Mrs. M.]\n\flviil] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 115\nThese eleven incidents sound more like deliberate truth-\ntelling, whoever the truth-teller be, than like lucky flukes. On\nthe whole they make on me the impression of being super-\nnormal. I confess that I should at this moment much like\nto know (although I have no means of knowing) just how\nall the documents I am exhibiting in this report will strike\nreaders who are either novices in the field, or who consider\nthe subject in general to be pure \" rot \" or \" bosh.\" It seems\nto me not impossible that a bosh-philosopher here or there may\nget a dramatic impression of there being something genuine\nbehind it all. Most of those who remain faithful to the \" bosh \"-\ninterpretation would, however, find plenty of comfort if they had\nthe entire mass of records given them to read. Not that I\nhave left things out (I certainly have tried not to!) that\nwould, if printed, discredit the detail of what I cite, but I have\nleft out, by not citing the whole mass of records, so much\nmere mannerism, so much repetition, hesitation, irrelevance,\nunintelligibility, so much obvious groping and fishing and\nplausible covering up of false tracks, so much false pretension\nto power, and real obedience to suggestion, that the stream of\nveridicality that runs throughout the whole gets lost as it\nwere in a marsh of feebleness, and the total dramatic effect\non the mind may be little more than the word \" humbug.\"\nThe really significant items disappear in the total bulk.\n\" Passwords,\" for example, and sealed messages are given in\nabundance, but can't be found. (I omit these here, as some\nof them may prove veridical later.) Preposterous Latin sen-\ntences are written, e.g. \" Rebus merica este fecrum \"\n\u2014or what\nreads like that (April 4th, 1906). Poetry gushes out, but how\ncan one be sure that Mrs. Piper never knew it ? The weak\ntalk of the Imperator-band about time is reproduced, as where\nE. H. pretends that he no longer knows what \" seven minutes\n\"\nmean (May 14th, 1906). Names asked for can't be given,\netc., etc.\n1\nAll this mass of diluting material, which can't be\nreproduced in abridgment, has its inevitable dramatic effect\n1\nFor instance, on July 2nd, the sitter asks R. H. to name some of his\ncronies at the Tavern Club. Hodgson gives six names, only five of which\nbelonged to the Tavern Club, and those Ave were known to the controls\nalready. None of them, I believe, were those asked for, namely, \"names of\nthe men he used to play pool with or go swimming with at Nantasket.\" Yet,\nas the sitter (Mr. Dorr) writes, \"He failed to realize his failure.\"\n\f116 Professor William James. [part\nand if one tends to hate the whole phenomenon anyhow (as I\nconfess that I myself sometimes do) one's judicial verdict\ninclines accordingly.\nNevertheless, I have to confess also that the more familiar I\nhave become with the records, the less relative significance for\nmy mind has all this diluting material tended to assume. The\nactive cause of the communications is on any hypothesis a will\nof some kind, be it the will of E. H.'s spirit, of lower super-\nnatural intelligences, or of Mrs. Piper's subliminal ; and although\nsome of the rubbish may be deliberately willed (certain hesita-\ntions, misspellings, etc., in the hope that the sitter may give\na clue, or certain repetitions, in order to gain time) yet the\nmajor part of it is suggestive of something quite different\u2014as\nif a will were there, but a will to say something which the\nmachinery fails to bring through. Dramatically, most of this\n\" bosh \" is more suggestive to me of dreaminess and mind-\nwandering than it is of humbug. Why should a \"will to deceive\n\"\nprefer to give incorrect names so often, if it can give the true\nones to which the incorrect ones so frequently approximate as\nto suggest that they are meant ? True names impress the sitter\nvastly more. Why should it so multiply false \" passwords\n\"\n(\" Zeivorn,\" for example, above, p. 86) and stick to them?\nIt looks to me more like aiming at something definite, and\nfailing of the goal. Sometimes the control gives a message\nto a distant person quite suddenly, as if for some reason a\nresistance momentarily gave way and let pass a definite desire\nto give such a message. Thus on October 1 7th, \"Give my\nlove to Carl Putnam,\" a name which neither Mrs. Piper nor\nthe sitter knew, and which popped in quite irrelevantly to\nwhat preceded or followed. A definite will is also suggested\nwhen P. H. sends a message to James Putnam about his\n\" watch stopping.\" He sends it through several sitters and\nsticks to it in the face of final denial, as if the phrase covered,\nhowever erroneously, some distinct \" intention to recall,\" which\nought not to be renounced.\nThat a \" will to personate \" is a factor in the Piper-pheno-\nmenon, I fully believe, and I believe with unshakeable firmness\nthat this will is able to draw on supernormal sources of infor-\nmation. It can \" tap,\" possibly the sitter's memories, possibly\nthose of distant human beings, possibly some cosmic reservoir in\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 117\nwhich the memories of earth are stored, whether in the shape\nof \" spirits \" or not. If this were the only will concerned\nin the performance, the phenomenon would be humbug pure\nand simple, and the minds tapped telepathieally in it would\nplay an entirely passive role \u2014that is, the telepathic data would\nbe fished out by the personating will, not forced upon it by\ndesires to communicate, acting externally to itself.\nBut it is possible to complicate the hypothesis. Extraneous\n\" wills to communicate \" may contribute to the results as well\nas a \" will to personate,\" and the two kinds of will may\nbe distinct in entity, though capable of helping each other\nout. The will to communicate, in our present instance, would\nbe, on the pirinia facie view of it, the will of Hodgson's sur-\nviving spirit ;\nand a natural way of representing the process\nwould be to suppose the spirit to have found that by pressing,\nso to speak, against \" the light,\" it can make fragmentary\ngleams and flashes of what it wishes to say mix with the\nrubbish of the trance-talk on this side. The two wills might\nthus strike up a sort of partnership and reinforce each other.\nIt might even be that the \" will to personate \" would be\ncomparatively inert unless it were aroused to activity by the\nother will. We might imagine the relation to be analogous\nto that of two physical bodies, from neither of which, when\nalone, mechanical, thermal, or electrical activity can proceed,\nbut if the other body be present, and show a difference of\n\" potential,\" action starts \\ip and goes on apace.\nConceptions such as these seem to connect in schematic\nform the various elements in the case. Its essential factors\nare clone justice to ; and, by changing the relative amounts\nin which the rubbish-making and the truth-telling wills con-\ntribute to the resultant, we can draw up a table in which\nevery type of manifestation, from silly planchet-writing up\nto Eector's best utterances, finds its proper place. Personally,\nI must say that, although I have to confess that no crucial\nproof of the presence of the \" will to communicate \" seems to\nme yielded by the Hodgson-control taken alone, and in the\nsittings to which I have had access, yet the total effect in\nthe way of dramatic probability of the whole mass of similar\nphenomena on my mind, is to make me believe that a\n\" will to communicate \" is in some shape there. I cannot\n\f118 Professor William James. [part\ndemonstrate it, but practically I am inclined to \" go in \" for\nit, to bet on it and take the risks.\nThe question then presents itself : In what shape is it\nmost reasonable to suppose that the will thus postulated is\nactually there ? And here again there are various pneuma-\ntological possibilities, which must be considered first in abstract\nform. Thus the will to communicate may come either from\npermanent entities, or from an entity that arises for the\noccasion. R. H.'s spirit would be a permanent entity ; and\ninferior parasitic spirits (' daimons,' elementals, or whatever their\ntraditional names might be) would be permanent entities. An\nimprovised entity might be a limited process of consciousness\narising in the cosmic reservoir of earth's memories, when\ncertain conditions favoring systematized activity in particular\ntracts thereof were fulfilled. The conditions in that case might\nbe conceived after the analogy of what happens when two\npoles of different potential are created in a mass of matter,\nand cause a current of electricity, or what not, to pass\nthrough an intervening tract of space until then the seat\nof rest.\nTo consider the case of permanent entities first, there is no\na priori reason why human spirits and other spiritual beings\nmight not either co-operate at the same time in the same\nphenomenon, or alternately produce different manifestations.\nPrima facie, and as a matter of \" dramatic \" probability, other\nintelligences than our own appear on an enormous scale in the\nhistoric mass of material which Myers first brought together\nunder the title of Automatisms. The refusal of modern\n\" enlightenment \" to treat \" possession \" as a hypothesis to be\nspoken of as even possible, in spite of the massive human\ntradition based on concrete experience in its favor, has always\nseemed to me a curious example of the power of fashion in\nthings scientific. That the demon-theory (not necessarily a\ndevil-theory) will have its innings again is to my mind\nabsolutely certain. One has to be \" scientific \" indeed, to be\nblind and ignorant enough to suspect no such possibility.\nBut if the liability to have one's somnambulistic or automatic\nprocesses participated in and interfered with by spiritual\nentities of a different order ever turn out to be a pro-\nbable fact, then not only what I have called the will to\n\flviii.] Report on Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control. 119\ncommunicate, but also the will to personate may fall outside\nof the medium's own dream-life.

A certain theory of Fechner's helps my own imagina-\ntion here, so I will state it briefly for my reader's benefit.\nFechner in his Zend-Avesta 1\nand elsewhere assumes that\nmental and physical life run parallel, all memory-processes\nbeing, according to him, co-ordinated with material processes.\nIf an act of yours is to be consciously remembered hereafter,\nit must leave traces on the material universe such that when\nthe traced parts of the said universe systematically enter into\nactivity together the act is consciously recalled.

The bodies (including of\ncourse the brains) of Hodgson's friends who come as sitters,\nare naturally parts of the material universe which carry some\nof the traces of his ancient acts. They function as receiving\nstations, and Hodgson (at one time of his life at any rate) was in-\nclined to suspect that the sitter himself acts \" psychometrically,\"\nor by his body being what, in the trance-jargon, is called an\n\" influence,\" in attracting the right spirits and eliciting the\nright communications from the other side. If, now, the rest\nof the system of physical traces left behind by Hodgson's\nacts were by some sort of mutual induction throughout its\nextent, thrown into gear and made to vibrate all at once, by\nthe presence of such human bodies to the medium, we should\nhave a Hodgson-system active in the cosmos again, and the\n\" conscious aspect \" of this vibrating system might be Hodgson's\nspirit redivivus, and recollecting and willing in a certain\nmomentary way. There seems fair evidence of the reality of\npsychometry ; so that this scheme covers the main phenomena\nin a vague general way. In particular, it would account for\nthe \" confusion \" and \" weakness \" that are such prevalent\nfeatures : the system of physical traces corresponding to the\ngiven spirit would then be only imperfectly aroused. It tallies\nvaguely with the analogy of energy finding its way from higher\nto lower levels.

The con-\ntent of that material is no more veridical than is a lot of\nearlier Piper-material, especially in the clays of the old Phinuit\ncontrol.1\nAnd it is, as I began by saying, vastly more leaky\nand susceptible of naturalistic explanation than is any body of\nPiper-material recorded before. Had I been reviewing the\nentire Piper-phenomenon, instead of this small section of it,\nmy tone would probably give much less umbrage to some of\nits spiritistic friends who are also valued friends of mine.\n1\nSee, in proof of this assertion, Hodgson's and Hyslop's previous reports.\n\f122 Mrs. Sidgwick and J. G. Piddington. [part\nII.\nNOTE ON MRS. FIEEE'S HODGSON-CONTROL IN\nENGLAND IN 1906-7.\nBy Mrs. H. Sidgwick and J. G. Piddington.\nWe think it may be useful to complete the account of the\nHodgson-Piper control (HodgsonP)\nup to January, 1908, by\ngiving here a brief risumi, of our experience of it during Mrs.\nPiper's visit to England, which interrupted in 1906-7 the\nsittings dealt with above by Professor James.\nThe Hodgson control appeared frequently at Mrs. Piper's\nEnglish sittings, but was seldom the most prominent control.\nIn explanation of this he stated that he was engaged in helping\nMyers and others to communicate, and thought it better to\nkeep himself in the background.1\nOn the one hand his style\nand expressions in communicating resembled those described\nby Professor James, and were dramatically suitable to Hodgson.\nMoreover, he referred appropriately and characteristically, though\nrather generally, to private matters with which Hodgson and\nthe sitter (Miss Alice Johnson on one occasion and Mrs. Sidg-\nwick on another) had been concerned. (These references, however,\nthough impressive, cannot be regarded as quite satisfactory\nfrom an evidential point of view, because the knowledge of\nfacts unknown to Mrs. Piper which they primd facie seem to\ninvolve, might have been derived from facts which Hodgson,\nwhen alive, had mentioned to the trance-personalities.) On the\nother hand, the attempts made by HodgsonP to recall trivial\nincidents were not convincing, and were, in fact, often wrong.\nTo Mrs. Sidgwick it seemed that such attempts in relation to\n1\nThus on February 6, 1907, Hodgson^ wrote: \"You must pardon me if I\ndo not appear here often personally, as I feel I can be of better service by helping\nothers for a time at least.\"\n\flviii.] Mrs. Pipers Hodgson-Control in England. 123\nher were either guesses or, if referring to real events at all,\nreminiscences appropriate not to her but to some other friend.\nThe communications so far spoken of are those which came\nspontaneously and unsought in the course of sittings with\npersons known to be present both by Mrs. Piper's normal self\nand by the trance personalities. But a systematic attempt was\nmade to obtain evidence which should be free from the sources\nof leakage and possibilities of naturalistic explanation, which,\nas Professor James points out, were largely though inevitably\npresent in the body of evidence with which he had to deal.\nWe introduced anonymously, and after the trance had begun,\nintimate English friends of Hodgson's hitherto unconnected\nwith the active work of the Society for Psychical Research,\nand who had never met Mrs. Piper either in her normal or\nher trance state ; about whom, moreover, it was unlikely that\nHodgson in this life would have spoken in any detail, if indeed\nat all, either to Mrs. Piper or the trance personalities. Unfor-\ntunately the results were almost purely negative. Three such\nintimate friends had among them seven sittings, and all went\naway disappointed. Even after clues had been given by the\nsitters, nothing that could be regarded as adequate evidence of\nrecognition was said, and there was a great deal of what looked\nlike guessing and fishing, and much said that was inappropriate.1\nA fourth friend of Hodgson's had five sittings under what\nmight be supposed to be very favourable circumstances\u2014in\nthe very rooms in which Hodgson had dined with him the\nlast time that they had met in England. Nevertheless there\nwas no good evidence that there were any associations for\nHodgsonP either with the friend or with the room. This is\nall the more remarkable because these sittings afforded very\ninteresting evidence of supernormally acquired knowledge.\nWhat happened was that another friend of the sitter's, long\ndeceased, professed to communicate, gave his name correctly,\nand correctly said that he had promised to communicate if he\nshould die first. Other correct statements, though also some\nincorrect ones, were made.'2\nAll this time HodgsonP professed\n1\nCompare, however, in this connexion Section XIII. of Mr. Piddington's\npaper in Proceedings, Vol. XXII. pp. 179-192, where portions of some of\nthese sittings are dealt with.\n-It is hoped that it may be possible some day to publish details.\n\f124 Mrs. Sidgivick and J.

G. P. It would, of course, have been very good if you had\nrecognised the friend ; but it will still be very good if,\nwhen you go out, you could talk it over with Hudson\nand then say things to prove you know who the\nfriend is.\nExarth\/. I understand, and I will certainly do so, but I\nhave told you already that I know him.\nAt later sittings there were what we took to be attempts\nat this sitter's name, though not explicitly referred to him, and\nreminiscences that may have applied to him were connected by\nHodgsoiip with another sitter ; but there was nothing that can\nbe claimed as proof that Hodgsoiip really remembered anything\nabout him.\nThis failure on the part of Hodgsoiip to recognise Hodgson's\nfriends is the more remarkable because HodgsonP had been\ntold first by Mr. Piddington at Boston and later by Sir Oliver\nLodge at Edgbaston that friends of Hodgson's (not specified, of\ncourse) would come to the sittings, so that it was natural to\nsuppose that HodgsonP would be on the look-out for them.\nA fifth person who had sittings with Mrs. Piper in\nEngland was \" Mrs. Eorbes,\" known to readers of the Pro-\nceedings as an automatist who has had veridical communications,\nand some cross-correspondences with Mrs. Verrall. Mrs. Forbes\nhad not previously seen Mrs. Piper, but she knew Hodgson,\nwho on one of his later visits to England had stayed at her\nhouse to discuss psychical matters. Like the other sitters, she\nwas introduced anonymously and after the trance had begun,\nbut her name was inadvertently mentioned to the trance\npersonalities before the end of the series of four sittings.\nThe sittings were not on the whole satisfactory, though the\nreal name of Mrs. Forbes's son \" Talbot \" (see Proceedings,\nVol. XX., p. 220) was gradually arrived at by Kector before her\nname had been revealed. HodgsonP communicated in the course\nof the first sitting and after a sufficient interchange of remarks\n\f12G Mrs. Sidgwick and J. G. Piddington. [part\nto suggest that the sitter had been acquainted with Hodgson,\ntried to remind her of the story about the old man and woman\npraying for bread told by Professor James above (p. 26).\nThis the sitter failed to remember, but she remembers having\nhad discussions with Hodgson about prayer. There was not,\nhowever, enough verifiable specific detail to make it certain\nthat the conversation referred to by HodgsonP was really a\nconversation with Mrs. Forbes.\nFrom what we have said it is clear that our attempt, by\nintroducing Hodgson's friends, to obtain evidence of continuity\nof memory between HodgsonP and Hodgson must be regarded\nas a failure. The same, it may be remarked, is true of the\nsimilar experiments we made in connection with Henry Sidgwick.1\nHis communications in the trance were much rarer than\nHodgson's, but they did not occur at all when friends were\nintroduced whom it was hoped he would recognise. What\nthe inference to be drawn from these negative results should\nbe\u2014whether the failure is to be attributed to the absence of\ncontinuous memory or to the absence of conditions essential\nto its manifestation\u2014it is not possible in our present state\nof ignorance about the whole subject to decide.\n1\nSince 1901 a control calling itself Henry Sidgwick has put in occasional\nappearances in Mrs. Piper's trance. The personation has been, however, of\nthe feeblest description ; a fact all the more strange because Mrs. Piper was\npersonally acquainted with Dr. Sidgwick.\n\flviii.] Report on some Trance Communications. 127\nIII.\nEEPOET ON SOME TBANCE COMMUNICATIONS\nEECEIVED CHIEFLY THROUGH MBS.

For this purpose\ntherefore I do not limit myself to the consideration of evidential\nmatter, but regard the non-evidential and the trivial as sometimes\nequally instructive. I do not propose to argue as to the nature\nof these same controls, although that constitutes the main problem\nbefore us. The time hardly appears ripe for useful discussion of\nthat kind, and I feel myself in agreement with Professor William\nJames when he says (see above, p. 29) :\n\"The facts are evidently complicated in the extreme, and we\nhave as yet hardly scratched the surface of them\nI consequently disbelieve in being too 'rigorous' with our criticism\nof anything now in hand, or in our squeezing so evidently\nvague a material too hard in our technical forceps, at the\npresent stage. What we need is more and more observations.\nQuantity may have to supplement quality in the material.\nWhen we have the facts in sufficient number, we may be sure\nthat they will cast plenty of explanatory backward light. We\ncan therefore well afford to play a waiting game.\"\nThere is one kind of criticism which had better be met and if\npossible countered from the first. The method of a Piper sitting\nis a conversation \u2014usually written on one side, spoken on the\nother, \u2014and in a conversation it is natural and necessary, if the\ncolloquy is to be maintained, to deal with the utterances at their\nface value, and accept the speaker or writer for what he purports\nto be at the time. The only alternative is to refuse to continue\nthe conversation. When therefore a critic objects to \" Hail Myers,\n\f(Lvm.] On Trance Communications, Introduction. 129\n.glad to see you,\" as a response to the greeting \"Well well Lodge\nI am Myers,\" or when he ridicules such phrases as \"Glad to see\nyou at last,\" and \"I expect so,\" as responses to the boisterous\nsalutation \"Hello Lodge, I am Hodgson,\" \"I am very much alive,\"\nhe shows himself deficient in imagination. In the same predicament\nthe most carping critic would himself instinctively respond some-\nwhat in the same vein ; unless he declined to respond at all and\nthrew the whole thing up. But we could have managed that still\nmore simply by not inviting Mrs. Piper over !\nIn answering a telephone call, the object of an ordinary communi-\ncator is to ascertain who his correspondent pretends to be. A\nconversation would soon languish if friendly advances were met by\naccusations of fraudulent impersonation. Caution should of course\nbe constantly exercised not to give gratuitous information, and every\npiece of information given should be carefully recorded, but the\n\u2022contention that a hostile or squeamish attitude should be taken by\nevery unprejudiced investigator is quite absurd; it would only be\nappropriate to one who so despises and sneers at the whole subject\nas to refuse an opportunity of learning anything about it. Doubt-\nless there are many such people in existence, and with them I have\nno quarrel ; but they are not asked to read or review these and\nother such reports.\nOne other preliminary remark may be made. Communications are\nnow conducted by writing, and the script is not at all easy to read.\nThere are only a few cases where there is any ultimate doubt as\nto the correctness of the reading, when it has been deciphered, but\nit cannot always be deciphered on the spot. This difficulty has\nperhaps hardly been sufficiently emphasised in the other papers on\n~the subject\u2014for instance, in Mr. Piddington's. In many cases the\ntemporary misunderstandings recorded must seem stupid to a reader\nwho has printed sentences before him : but I can assure him that\nif he saw the script he would in some cases be surprised at the\namount of intelligence shown by readers. The long experience of\nDr. Hodgson and Mr. Piddington enables them to decipher the\nscript with fair promptitude, though Rector is rather liable to discount\nthis advantage by writing more quickly, and therefore still more\nillegibly, when dealing with a skilled reader. So the contemporary\nreading is always a strain, and mistakes will occur wdiich interrupt\nanything like easy conversation\u2014such a conversation as you might\nexpect to carry on with a perfectly dumb person who is not deaf.\nI\n\f130 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nCHAPTER I.\nExplanatory and Historical.\nMy first acquaintance with Mrs. Piper dates from 19 Nov. 1889,.\nand my first experience of a sitting with her was at Cambridge on\nNov. 30 of the same year.\nBetween Dec. 18 and Dec. 27, 1889, she stayed in my house at\nLiverpool ; and again between Jan. 30 and Feb. 5, 1890; on which\nlatter date she returned to America.\nAt that time she was accustomed to give sittings as often as\ntwice a day.\nA full account of my experiences on these occasions is recorded\nin the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research for December\n1890, Part XVII, Vol. 6, pp. 413-557. This is preceded by an\nintroduction, pages 436-442, written by F. W. H. Myers, and is\nfollowed by a report on further sittings by Dr. Walter Leaf, together\nwith short supplementary statements by Prof, and Mrs. Sidgwick,\nProf. Richet, and Prof. Wm, James.\nI saw Mrs. Piper again on 9 Nov. 1906 at Liverpool, where she\nhad just arrived from America, and was staying in the house of\nMrs. Isaac Thompson of Liverpool, whose acquaintance she had made\non her previous visit to this country. Another series of sittings\nthen began, but at a rate of only two or three per week instead\nof two a day, and of the general character of these I now propose\nto give an account.\nIt has been described by Mr. Piddington in his recent paper,\nbut an independent description may supplement his in a few\nparticulars. In so far as there is repetition, it will presumably be\nrepetition of salient points, and as such is not altogether to be\ndeprecated. It is not easy to make a reader as familiar with the\nwhole procedure as an experimenter becomes who has undertaken\nthe labour of supervising a number of sittings.\nSince our first English experience with Mrs. Piper a great mass\nof material had been accumulated in America, under the manage-\nment of Dr. Hodgson, and the manner of the sittings had somewhat\nchanged. In the old days communication had always been made with\nthe voice, and any writing done was only brief and occasional. Now\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter I. 131\ncommunications are almost entirely in writing, and only under\nexceptional circumstances is the voice employed.\nThere was an intermediate stage, reported by Dr. Hodgson in\nVol. 13, pp. 358 and 398, during which both hand and voice were\nseparately employed at the same time, \u2014a sort of duplex telegraphy\n\u2014so that two sets of independent messages could be going on\nsimultaneously, and two different sitters accommodated, one talking\nto the voice and the other to the hand. Once or twice even the\nleft hand seems to have been independently employed as well.\nThis condition was one of great interest, but it must have been a\nstrain and it did not very long continue. Gradually the G.P. control\nmonopolised the right hand, and Phinuit was gradually ousted from\nthe voice.\nIn the old days Mrs. Piper sat upright in her chair, with head\nsomewhat bowed and eyes closed, and with both hands available\nfor holding objects or a hand of the sitter. Now her head reclined\nthroughout on a cushion, with her face turned away. The right\nhand alone was active, being engaged nearly all the time in\nwriting, with intervals of what looked like listening. The dramatic\nactivity of the hand was very remarkable : it was full of intelligence,\nand could be described as more like an intelligent person than a\nhand. It sometimes turned itself to the sitter, when it wanted to be\nspoken to by him ; but for the most part, when not writing, it\nturned itself away from the sitter, as if receiving communications\nfrom outside, which it then proceeded to write down ;\ngoing back\nto space i.e. directing itself to a part of the room where nobody\nwas\u2014for further information and supplementary intelligence, as\nnecessity arose.\nThe manner of preparation was as follows. A quiet room was\nselected in which interruption need not be feared ; a fire was pro-\nvided for warmth, and the windows were open for ventilation. A\ncomfortable chair was placed near a table, on which was a pile of\nfrom four to six cushions or pillows, on which the medium sitting\nin the chair and leaning forward could securely rest the side of\nher head when sleep came on, \u2014not burying her face in the cushions,\nbut turning it to the left side so as to be able to breathe during\nthe trance. If it ever happened that the pillows incommoded the\nbreathing, they had to be adjusted and pressed down by the experi-\nmenter in charge, so that air obtained free access to the mouth\nand nose. On the right hand side of the pillows, either on the\nsame or on a small subsidiary table, the writing materials were\n\f132 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART\narranged, namely a large pad or block-book (10\" x 8\") of 100 blank\nsheets all numbered in order, and four or five pencils of soft lead,\n2 b or 3 b, properly cut and ready.\nIt was the duty of the experimenter in charge to record all that\nthe sitter said. This could generally be done sideways on the same\nsheet without interfering with the medium's hand. He also had\nto arrange the pad so that the hand could conveniently write upon\nit ; and to tear off the sheets as they were done with. No attempt\nwas made to economise paper ; the automatic writing was large\nand scrawling, and did not often begin at the top of the page.\nSometimes a good deal of writing was obtained on a single page,\nsometimes only a few lines, and occasionally only a few words.\nThe tearing off of the old sheet was quickly done; and the hand\nwaited the moment necessary : though sometimes, when in the\nmidst of an energetic message, it indicated momentary impatience at\nthe interruption.\nMrs. Piper and her daughters often had breakfast with the family,\nthough occasionally she breakfasted in her room. On ordinary days\nshe went shopping or sight-seeing, or was otherwise ordinarily occu-\npied ; but on sitting days she went back after breakfast to her\nown room to be cpiiet. At the time fixed for the sitting, say\n10 or 10.30 a.m., Mrs. Piper came into the arranged room and seated\nherself in the chair in front of the pillows ; then the experimenter\nin charge sat down on a chair near the table, leaving a vacant chair\nbetween him and the medium, for the Sitter ; who at my sittings\nwas sometimes present from the first, but at those held in London,\nwas introduced only after the trance had come on. Mrs. Piper sat\nwith her hands on the pillows in front of her; about five minutes\nof desultory conversation followed, then heavy breathing began, and\nthe head of the medium presently dropped on to her hands on\nthe pillows and turned itself with its face to the left.\nThen almost at once the right hand disengaged itself and fell on\nthe table near the writing materials. After about 30 seconds of\ncomplete quiescence, this hand alone '\nwoke up ' as it were ; it\nslowly rose, made the sign of the cross in the air, and indicated that\nit was ready to write.\nThe experimenter then gave the hand a pencil, placing it between\nfore and middle fingers ; it was at once grasped, and writing began.\nFirst a cross was drawn, and then the word \"Hail\" was written,\nfollowed usually by \" We return to earth this day with joy and\npeace \" ; or \" We greet you friend of earth once again, we bring\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter I. 133\npeace and love\"; or some such semi-religious phrase, signed \"R,\"\nwhich stands for '\nRector ' the ostensible amanuensis.\nIn the old days the control had styled itself 'Phinuit'; now Phinuit\nnever appears, and the control calls itself Rector.\nI am aware that all this is familiar to a great number of members\nof the Society ; but new members join, and if I were to begin to\nallow for previous information I should be very uncertain where to\nstop allowing. I should probably omit the whole of this introductory\nportion.\nIn the old days the tone was not so dignified and serious as it\nis now : it could in fact then be described as rather humorous\nand slangy ; but there was a serious under-current constantly present\neven then ; the welcomes and farewells were quaint and kindly\neven affectionate at times\u2014and nothing was ever said of a character\nthat could give offence. I judge that stupid familiarity or frivolity\non the part of a sitter\u2014for which, however, there was no excuse\nwould have been at once rebuked and checked.\nIn the old days the going into trance seemed rather a painful\nprocess, or at least a process involving muscular effort ; there was\nsome amount of contortion of the face, and sometimes a slight\ntearing of the hair; and the same actions accompanied the return\nof consciousness. Now the trance seems nothing more than an\nexceptionally heavy sleep, entered into without effort\u2014a sleep with\nthe superficial appearance of that induced by chloroform ; and the\nreturn to consciousness, though slow and for a time accompanied\nby confusion, is easy and natural.\nA sitting used to last only about an hour ; and on the rare\noccasions when there is a voice sitting now, an hour is the limit\nbut a writing sitting seems less of a strain, and was often allowed\nto last as much as two hours, though not more.\nIn the old days, when sittings were more frequent, there were\ndegrees of intensity about them. Occasionally, though rarely, they\ndeclined to come on at all ; and sometimes, even when they did,\nthe loss of consciousness seemed less than complete. Under present\nconditions the trance was undoubtedly profound, and the suspension\nof normal consciousness unmistakably complete. Once, but only\nonce in my recent experience, the trance refused to come on, and\nthe attempt at a sitting had to be abandoned till next day.\nUsually after purposely placing herself under the familiar condi-\ntions to which she is accustomed, Mrs. Piper is able to let herself\ngo off, without trouble or delay.\n\f134 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nGreat care was taken of the body of the medium, both now and\npreviously, by the operating intelligence. She was spoken of usually\nas \"the light,\" sometimes as \"the machine,\" though the word\n\" machine \" commonly signified only the pencil.\nIf anything went wrong with the breathing, or if there was\ninsufficient air in the room, or if the cushions slipped so as to\nmake the attitude uncomfortable, the hand wrote \" something wrong\nwith the machine,\" or \" attend to the light, \" or something of that\nsort ; and the experimenter amended the arrangements before the\nwriting went on. The whole thing was as sensible and easy as\npossible, as soon as the circumstances and conditions were under-\nstood. Each experimenter, of course, handed down all the informa-\ntion and Hodgsonian tradition of this kind to the next, so that all\nthe conditions to which Mrs. Piper was accustomed could be supplied\nbeforehand, and so that no injury would happen to her bodily\nhealth.\nThe following illustrates the care taken of the physical conditions\nand the way they are spoken of. It is an extract from a sitting\nheld by Mr. Dorr at Boston in 1906.\n(Rector interrupting a \" Hodgson \" communication)\nFriend, you will have to change the conditions a moment.\n[At the beginning of the sitting only one of the two windows\nin the room was open a very little way. A few moments\nprevious to this time H. J. Jr. noticing that the room\nwas a little close had opened the other window, and\nG. B. D. had nearly closed it again.]\nG. B. D. What is wrong with the conditions 1 Do you want more\nair or less 1\nWell, there will have to be a change in the surroundings,\nthere will have to be more strength, what is it, air,\nyes, air. And a good deal more just now. Hodgson\ntakes a good deal of strength when he comes, but he is\nall right, he understands the methods of operation very\nwell. (The window was now opened wide.) That is\nbetter. Now the light begins to get clear. All right,\nfriend.\nAs the time drew near to the two-hour limit, which has been set\nas a period beyond which it is undesirable to persist, and some-\n\f1,viii.] On, Trance Communications, Chapter I. 135\ntimes at the end of about an hour and a half, or an hour and three\nquarters, from the commencement, the experimenter in charge gave\na hint that the sitting must terminate soon ; or else the controls\nindicate the same thing, and they then begin to clear up and take\nfarewell. A sitting usually concludes as it began, with the writing\nof a serious sentence invoking the blessing of the Most High upon\nthe sitter and the group.\nThe coming out of the trance was gradual, and semi-consciousness\nlasted for several minutes, during which muttered sentences were\nottered, and the eyes, if open at all, only glared in sleep-walking\nfashion, until almost suddenly they took on a natural appearance, and\nMrs. Piper became herself. Even then, however, for half an hour\nor so after the trance had disappeared, the medium continued\nslightly dazed and only partly herself. During this time her eldest\ndaughter usually took charge of her. But the trance itself was so\nfamiliar to them all that the daughters were not the least anxious,\nand in another room went on with their letters or needle-work\nunconcerned. After a sitting, one of them was usually called and\n\u2022took her mother for a stroll in the garden. Then everybody had\nlunch together and talked of ordinary topics, nothing being said\nabout the sitting, and no ill result of an)' kind being experienced.\nIt seemed a normal function in her case. The experimenter mean-\nwhile had collected the papers and arranged them in order, and had\nremoved the pencils and other appliances. Subsequently it was his\nbusiness to write out legibly all the material accumulated during the\ntwo hours of sitting, to annotate it sufficiently, and send it to a\ntypewriter.\nThe actual record is of course preserved for exact reference\nwhenever necessary. A record was also made of the remarks of\nMrs. Piper during the period of awaking from trance. These were\nmore or less mumbled and difficult to hear, but they were often a\ncontinuation of what had been obtained during trance, and generally\ncontained useful passages ;\nthough part of them nearly always con-\nsisted of expressions of admiration for the state or experience she\nwas leaving, and of repulsion\u2014almost disgust\u2014at the commonplace\nterrestrial surroundings in which she found herself. Even a bright\nday was described as dingy or dark, and the sitter was stared at\nin an unrecognizing way, and described as a dull and ugly person,\nor sometimes as a negro. Presently, however, the eyes became\nintelligent, and she recognised some one\u2014usually Lady Lodge first\nand then with a smile welcomed her by name, and speedily\n\f136 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\ncame to. Some examples of these waking utterances will be found,\non pages 169, 185-7, 232, 276, 277.\nComing to ordinary social details : it is not an impertinence, but\nis justified by the special circumstances of the case, to state that the\nfamily is an admirable one, and that we regard them as genuine\nfriends.\nAt the time of Mrs. Piper's first visit her daughters were children..\nNow they are grown up, and are very useful to their mother. Nothing\nin any way abnormal or unusual is to be noticed about them, and their\nmother expresses it as her sincerest wish that they will not develop her\npower. For though she must realise the value of her services to\nscience, she cannot but feel that it to some extent isolates her and\nmarks her out as peculiar among her neighbours in New England,\nand that the time spent in the trance state must have made a distinct\ninroad on her available life-time. This however must to some extent\nbe the case with any occupation, and it is as the duty specially allotted\nto her that she has learnt to regard her long service, now extending\nover a quarter of a century. She became acquainted with Professor\nWilliam James\u2014who from our point of view may be said to have\ndiscovered her\u2014in 1885, but by that time her powers were already\nfully developed and well known to a group of admirers. They appear\nto have been noticed in 1884,-\u2014see Proc. S.P.R. Vol. 8, p. 46.\nIn May, 1887, Dr. Richard Hodgson, who was over in the States\nas Agent or American Secretary of the S.P.R., was introduced by\nProf. William James, and had his first set of sittings with her. On\nthe strength of these experiences he proceeded energetically to investi-\ngate and subject her to tests, in case he might be able to discover\nsome fraudulent procedure. There was none however to detect,\nand gradually lie became one of the most convinced and enthusiastic\nof her supervisors. He held and superintended an immense number\nof sittings\u2014the first series of which are reported on by him in\nVolume 8 of the Proceedings of the S.P.R. (the details beginning on\npage 59) ; and this report constitutes the second large batch of\nmaterial on the subject published by the Society.\nThere is a large amount of unpublished material accumulated\nin America, which remains still to be edited some day : but some\nportions have already appeared in the Society's Proceedings from,\ntime to time.\nVol. 13 contains a further report by Dr. Hodgson of occurrences\nin the year 1892-4, and herein is recorded the first appearance of\nautomatic writing through Mi s. Piper\u2014Phinuit being still in customary\n\flyiil] On Trance Communications, Chapter I. 137\npossession, but beginning to be displaced by the other controls. On\npage 295 is a history of the George Pelham control, and on page 408\nis related the first appearance of Stainton Moses, which before long\nled to the development of some controls like his, though with some\ndissimilarities. Phinu.it gave place to them altogether in 1897.\nVol. 14 contains a record, by Prof. W. R. Newbold, of a con-\nsiderable collection of sittings held by him in conjunction with Dr.\nHodgson in 1894-6.\nVol. 16 consists entirely of a Report by Professor Hyslop on his\nseries of sittings in 1898-9.\nMr. Podmore discusses Piper sittings in Vol. 14, p. 50, and Mrs.\nSidgwick discusses them in Vol. 15, p. 16.\nFinally, Mrs. Verrall's own automatic script, which only began after\nMr. Myers's death, is analysed by herself in a paper which constitutes\nthe whole of Vol. 20. Part LV. of the Proceedings S.P.R. (Vol. 21)\ncontains Miss Johnson's report on the script of Mrs. Holland, and\nVol. 22 consists of Mr. Piddington's report on Mrs. Piper.\nGeneral Remarks on Piper Controls.\nLast time, viz. in 1890, I gave a full chronological series of all the\nsittings, and it would be easy to continue that process on this\noccasion also. But it would be rather tedious, and seems likely to\nserve no useful purpose. It is a more laborious plan, but probably\nmore serviceable, to dissect out the parts relating to certain main\nepisodes, or received from certain chief communicators, so as to collect\nand arrange together all the messages which purport to come from a\nsingle control, free from the interleaved communications from others.\nIn this way the reader will be able to get a better grasp of the\npersonality, or of the impersonation, as the case may be, than if his\nutterances were scattered about through the sittings as in the old\nrecord.\nIt is even desirable, I think, to extract from those old records a\nfew of the utterances which purported to come then from the same\ncommunicators ; and likewise to record a few of the messages given\nby these communicators through other mediums, so far as they\nhave come directly to myself and are concerned with the same\ngeneral sort of topics.\nOn the cross-correspondence messages I shall touch only very lightly,\nthough I recognise their great importance ; because this part of the\nsubject requires the collation of the contemporary records of several\nsitters, and the labour of doing this has been left to Mr. Piddington,\n\f138 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nOne curious circumstance I feel constrained to mention\u2014though it\nwill seem absurd\u2014and that is that the controls seem to do best in\ntheir own country. For instance, long ago, before any of us on this\nside of the Atlantic had seen Mrs. Piper, a control calling itself\nGurney sent messages through that medium while she was still in\nAmerica ; which messages, when recorded on this side, were thought\nfeeble and unworthy, so that the control was spoken of both by\nProf. W, James and by those in England as \" the pseudo-Gurney.\"\nWhen, however, Mrs. Piper came over here the \"Gurney\" messages\nbecame better, and could be described as quite fairly lifelike. Con-\nversely, the Hodgson control, which seemed rather brilliant and\nactive over there, when it appeared on this side did not sustain\nthat character to the full extent. It was robust and lively, and in\nmanner like Hodgson, but it was not so successful in furnishing\ntests or in recognising old friends. Again, the Myers control, which\nhad seemed rather weak over there, on this side gained strength\nand vivacity, and gave some admirable tests.\nThe fact of the difference here suggested may be doubted, and I\ndo not dogmatise about it, but that is my impression ; and I see that\nsomething similar has already struck Mr. Piddington, and is remarked\nupon by him at the beginning of his Introduction. I have no\nexplanation to offer, beyond the obvious suggestion that familiar\nand friendly surroundings\u2014greater intimacy of friends and relations\nin the proximate neighbourhood \u2014all make for strength and reality\nand give assistance to the impersonation. This indeed is a conceiv-\nable possibility on any hypothesis, whether the control is merely a\npersonation by Mrs. Piper's subliminal consciousness, or is a telepathic\ninfluence from living persons acting upon it, or whether it is really\nsome surviving influence of the departed intelligence who is the\nostensible communicator.\nIn speaking of messages received from a certain control, it is not\nto be understood in general that that control is actually manipulating\nthe organism ; it may be always, and certainly is in general, merely\ndictating through an amanuensis as it were,\u2014the actual writer or\nspeaker being either 'Rector' or 'Phinuit,' who again may or may\nnot be a phase of Mrs. Piper's personality.\nIn the old days, undoubtedly, the appearance was sometimes as\nif the actual control was changed\u2014after the fashion of a multiple\npersonality ; whereas now I think it is nearly always Rector that\nwrites, recording the messages given to him as nearly as he can,\nand usually reporting in the first person, as Phinuit often did. I\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter I. 139\ndo not attempt to discriminate between what is given in this way\nand what is given directly, because it is practically impossible to do\nso with any certainty; since what appears to be direct control is liable\nto shade off into obvious reporting. That is to say, if a special\nagency gets control and writes for a few minutes, it does not seem\nable to sustain the position long, but soon abandons it to the more\naccomplished and experienced personality, Rector. In the recent\nseries there appeared very little evidence of direct control other\nthan Rector.\nWe shall speak however of the 'Gurney control,' 'the Hodgson\n\u2022control', etc., without implying that these agents\u2014even assuming\ntheir existence and activity \u2014are ever really in physical possession\nof the organism ;\nand, even when they are controlling as directly as\npossible, they may perhaps always be operating telepathically on it\nrather than telergically\u2014operating, that is to say, through some\nstratum of the mind, rather than directly on any part of the\nphysical organism. It is rather soon as yet to make definite\nassertions regarding the actual method of control : there are too\nmany unknown quantities about the whole phenomenon ; at the\nsame time Dr. Hodgson has thought it worth while to report\nthe general aspect of the phenomenon as it is said to appear to the\n\"communicators\" themselves; he does this on page 400 of Vol. 13\n{a portion is quoted below on page 147). And in the next few\npages he goes on to indicate his own independent view of what is\noccurring, giving a detailed description which my own smaller ex-\nperience, as far as it goes, tends in a general way to confirm. Readers\ninterested in these particulars may here conveniently refer to further\nremarks on the subject in Chapter II., pp. 161, 147.\nOne other point deserves to be here mentioned :\nIn the days of Phinuit considerable facility was shown in dealing\nwith strangers. Persons introduced anonymously had their relations\n\u2022enumerated, and their family affairs referred to, in a remarkably\nquick and clever way : so much so that they sometimes thought that\ntheir special case must have been \"got up\" beforehand. The facility\nfor dealing with strangers in this way is now much less marked.\nThe introduction of a stranger now makes things slow and laborious,\nand is on the whole discouraged ; for although the old characteristics\ncontinue to some extent, the tests now given are mainly of a different\nkind. The early procedure was useful at the beginning, and it\n\u2022continued useful for a good many years till a case for investigation\nwas firmly established ; but it must have seemed tedious to prolong\n\f140 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nthat method further, so the group of controls associated with Rector\nassured Dr Hodgson that they would take the trance in hand and\ndevelop it on better and higher lines.\nAs to how far the change is an improvement, there has been at\ntimes some difference of opinion ; but in view of the remarkable\ntests recently given under what, though of several years' standing,\nmay be called, the new regime\u2014tests which have been dissected\nout by Mr. Piddington\u2014there can be but little doubt about the\nimprovement now, however imperfectly or doubtfully it may manifest\nitself in my small portion of the whole report. I shall begin, how-\never, not with messages received under the new conditions, but with\nsome received under the old.\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Gurney Control.\nSome of the messages purporting to come directly or indirectly\nfrom the late Edmund Gurney were received by me in 1889, and\nare partially reported in the Proceedings, Vol. 6, already referred\nto ; but part was ignored as unverifiable, and another part suppressed\nas too private ;\nmoreover, even the part published is disguised under\nthe pseudonym of \" Mr. E.\" This anonymity seems no longer\nnecessary ; and I shall no longer trouble myself as to whether\nthe communication refers to verifiable subjects or not, but shall\ngive what was said as completely as possible\u2014that is to say as-\nfar as it could be taken down by a moderately expert note-taker\nwith an excellent memory\u2014in order to convey some idea of the\nconversation.\nOn the whole, it was rather a lifelike impersonation, and now\nthat we have determined to make the working hypothesis that\ndeceased members of the S.P.R. may conceivably have something\nto do with the messages, I propose to republish the old Gurney\ncommunications, so as to make a more complete set.\nIt should be remembered, however, that the communications in\nthe earlier sittings were by word of mouth, which, although the\neasier and livelier and more interesting method, is not so con-\nducive to exact record as the writing plan.\nThe report aims at being a correct representation, but cannot be\nregarded as verbally precise, since it necessarily suffers from defect\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 141\nfrequentl}', and there is no guarantee against occasional mishearing.\nBut the chief fault is omission of connecting words and such like,\nresulting in a jerkiness of style not necessarily characteristic.\nWith regard to the influence of the medium herself upon the\nmessages, there is in all cases bound to be a certain amount of\nsophistication attributable to this cause, and some hesitation and con-\nfusion, owing to the cropping up from time to time, or perhaps the\nconstant superposition, of idiosyncracies of the medium herself. In\nother words, the impersonation, however good, cannot be perfect;\nand this we say with the more confidence now that we have the\nsame control purporting to communicate through different mediums.\nThe manner, and even partly the matter, is coloured by the medium ;\nso that, for instance, we have to speak of the Piper-Myers, the\nVerrall-Myers, and the Holland-Myers, as to some extent different\npeople, though also to a great extent similar.\nFor instance, one and the same sentiment or fact can be expressed\nthrough Mrs. Verrall by classical language and allusions, through\nMrs. Holland with some poetic composition and literary style, and\nthrough Mrs. Piper in simple English.\nIf a child were the medium, it would be reasonable to expect\nsome childish turns of phrase ; whereas the brain of a scholar natur-\nally furnishes an instrument of greater power and scope.\nThe communications which immediately follow are all from the\nPiper Gurney, or, as Mr. Piddington denotes it, from GurneyP.\nA few episodes are said by the control to be private, he did not\nwant them told to others or published, and accordingly these are\nperforce omitted. They were of an identifying nature, and conveyed\ninformation as to facts previously unknown to me ; I was per-\nmitted to mention them to Mr. Myers, and they turned out to be\ntrue. I am informed however that they had already come out in\nthe presence of sitters aware of the facts ; so that they had not\nthe evidential importance that might attach to them if they had been\nmentioned a first time while only one who was ignorant of them was\npresent. Of some I have no record, and these I have practically for-\ngotten. But I remember this, \u2014that I learnt in this way more about\nthe life and thoughts of Edmund Gurney than I had known in his\nlifetime. My acquaintance with him was not intimate, and its history\ncan be briefly given. It began in the early seventies, when in order to\nproceed with his study of Sound, he came as a senior student and\nsat on the benches of University College, London, to listen to my\nregular college lectures on Mechanics and Physics, in classes\n\f142 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nwith which I was entrusted at that time by Professor Carey\nFoster. He was good enough to strike up a friendship with his\nyouthful instructor, and I occasionally lunched with him, and once\nor twice saw him in his rooms at Clarges Street.\nThe talk gradually turned upon psychical matters, concerning\nwhich I was\u2014as were most young physicists in those days\nentirely sceptical and completely ignorant. Though he did not\nlet it consume the whole of his time, I recollect that Mr. Gurney\nwas even then at work on systematic preparation for the book,\nPhantasms of the Living, and that his room was strewn with papers\nand printed slips. Before long he introduced me to his friend,\nF. W. H. Myers, who, like Mr. Gurney, was patience itself in trying\nto inspire my superficial and dogmatic materialism with an element\nof larger sense.\nA few years after all this the S.P.R. was founded, but I was not\none of the original members. I joined, I suppose, after the Liverpool\nthought-transference experiments in 1883 and 1884. I had migrated\nto Liverpool in 1881, and remained there till 1900. Professor Barrett\nI had of course known all along as a physicist, and in the eighties\nwe had some conversations on thought-transference in connexion with\nthe Liverpool experiments, in some of which I took part, and on\nwhich I reported in the Proc. S.P.R., Vol. 2.\nUntil 1884 I was unconvinced of the possibility of telepathy;\nand not till the end of 1889 did the evidence for survival of\npersonality beyond bodily death make any serious impression upon\nme, though I recognised the force of some of the arguments\nemployed. The subject did not trouble me however. I knew that\nthe facts must be in one direction or another, and there I was\ncontent to leave them ; under the belief that real knowledge was\nimpossible. So if anyone represents that I was keenly anxious to\nbelieve and be assured on this subject, at this or any other time,,\nthey are unintentionally representing a falsehood. 1\nI did not get to know Myers really well till about this date, and\nit was later still before I gained any genuine acquaintance with\nHenry Sidgwick. Before his death, Myers had become perhaps my\nmost intimate friend; but Edmund Gurney died in 1888, at a time\nwhen I was entirely absorbed in orthodox physical experiments and\ntheory, in connexion with electric waves.\n1\nSee, for instance, some anonymous gossip quoted by Mr. Edward Clodd in,\nhis book called Pioneers of Evolution, page 66.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 143>\nOld Piper Sittings.\nSitting on evening of 21 Dec, 1889, with Mrs. Piper.\n0. J. L. alone.\nThe first mention of Gurney in my sittings occurred on Saturday\nevening, Dec. 21, 1889, at a sitting which I had alone, taking notes\nas best I could ; for at that time it was the custom for the medium\nto hold one of the sitter's hands. It is only very partially reported\non page 493, Vol. 6.\nAfter the messages already reported, ending, \"It is the one who*\ndoesn't paint who is married,\" Phinuit went on :\nYou have got a mighty good life before you. You are\ngoing to be very rich. I wish I had your life. It is\nthrough your work. There will be a change of work\nin two years, and you will go out of present sur-\nroundings.\n[This is quoted as an example of the style of some of\nPhinuit's humorous attempts at fortune-telling predic-\ntions, to which every now and then he shamelessly\nresorts when gravelled for lack of matter (Cf. top of\np. 497 of Vol. 6, also p. 525 and elsewhere).]\n(A photograph of my late Demonstrator Mr. Clark was\nhere handed in.)\n0. J. L. Can you tell who this is 1\nWell I will try. Edmund will help me. A vessel burst\nin his stomach, and he passed out very suddenly. He\nwas away, not at home. A clever fellow and a great\nhelp. He fell. . Edmund sends his love to you.\n(A letter from Edmund Gurney was handed in.)\n0. J. L. Can you read this 1\nOh, I don't know. I can't read it word for word. I can\ntell you what it is about.\nIt has got Edmund's influence on it.\nSo had that picture. Had you kept it with Edmund's\nletter?\n\f144 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nO. J. L. Well it had been in the same pocket.\nYou must not do that. You mix things up if you do that.\nNo, I can't read this letter. It is something about\nsome books, and asking you about something. There is\nan illness described in it and a person in trouble. It\nis about an experiment or for a meeting, and about\nsome experiments. No, I give it up.\n[Here the personality seemed to change and to represent\nEdmund Gurney, He spoke so naturally that for a\ntime I forgot to take notes, but nothing evidential\nwas said. The notes go on thus:\u2014\nThey are henceforward very imperfect, i.e. fragmentary.]\nI am here, I etherially exist. I wrote to you about some\nbooks for the Society.\nI have seen a little woman that's a medium, a true medium.\nI have written to Myers using her hand. I did do it,\nI, Edmund Gurney, I.\nO. J. L. Is this a medium here now ?\nYes, she's a medium. Very few you will get like Dr.\nPhinuit. He is not all one would wish, but he is\nall right.\nYou are Lodge. I know you. Lodge we shall beat them\nyet. There is no death, only a shadow and then\nLight. Experiment and observation are indispensable.\nWe have to use some method like this to communicate.\nMy extant notes here come to an abrupt end, the lower half\nof the paper being cut off, presumably because something concern-\ning Gurney's private affairs was said which I was asked not to\nremember.\nAt any rate I do not remember what it was. One of the ad-\nvantages of a lone sitting like this is that the controls seem to\nfeel freer, and more willing to enter upon more private, and\ntherefore more really evidential, subjects, than when a reporter is\npresent. Before closing we discussed Phinuit's powers a little, and\nI told the Gurney control that I had arranged a special clair-\nvoyant experiment which I wanted to try with the Phinuit control.\nThat is to say I wanted to see if he could read some letters\nwhich, in that grouping, were not and never had been in anybody's\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 145\nmind,\u2014namely some cardboard letters pinched by me at random\nfrom a child's alphabet box and forthwith sealed up. I doubted\nif it was of much use, but wanted to try in order to test for clair-\nvoj^ance as against telepathy. The voice said :\nBy all means try. All these experiments must be tried.\n0. J. L. Well, tell him it's very important.\nYes. Here he is coming back. (Change of control.)\nNow then, what is it you want of me '?\n0. J. L. I want you, doctor, to tell me what's in this box, please.\nNo one knows.\nGive me a pencil (putting the box on top of medium's\nhead).\nA pencil was handed to him and he wrote on cardboard,\nslowly,\nLK Q U C N\nand then dropped the pencil.\nI am getting too weak.\nTry me earlier on another time. I am going now.\nThis was the end of the sitting, and Mrs. Piper speedily came to.\nI may as well repeat that this clairvoyance experiment, as reported\nin Note B on p. 494 of Vol. 6, entirely failed. The letters were\nnot read. It is true that this matter has nothing whatever to do\nwith the Gurney episode, but I think it better to exhibit con-\ntinuity between the portion previously reported and the portion\nwhich I now report more fully. So I give a little bit at the\nbeginning and a little bit at the end, each time.\nI have no particular comment to make upon this sitting ; the\npublished parts of which are not remarkable.\nSpecimens of unverijiable communications.\nPeople constantly ask why the communicators do not deal with\nsubjects that are important, or which give us new information. I\nsee no reason to suppose that we are here in contact with a trust-\nworthy source of general information, or that the controls know more\nabout things than we do. When an opportunity is occasionally given\nfor miscellaneous conversation, the following is the kind of thin\"\nK\n\f146 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nobtained \u2014at least in the case of this medium at that time ; and it\nis not encouraging, nor does it make us greedy for more. It must\nbe remembered that it was obtained twenty years ago, and that it\nis rather exceptional ; so if any critic selects this rubbishy portion\nas a fair specimen of what comes through under ordinary circum-\nstances, he will be criticising unfairly.\nThe sensory nervous system is the foundation of all\netherial substance recall mundane\nexperience. the sensory nervous system is a medium\nthrough which the etherial intellect like mine must\noperate.

It is difficult to know\nthings when in it.\nIs evolution true ?\nYes, God is in Nature, all Nature is God. We are a\nreflexion of God. Don't give up a good thing. The\nworld will know, and our Society will know, that there\nis no death. I didn't know. I would have given\nanything to have had you come and speak to me, if\nyou had passed away first, as I am speaking to you\nnow.\nIs it good to be where you are 1\nYes, it is good,\u2014the only good thing.\nLife in material world is beautiful.\nMarriage is beautiful, but this is far better.\nIs there no marriage ?\nNo, no, Swedenborg was all wrong.\nJesus Christ was right ; he knew.\nHe was a reflexion of God.\nMore than any one else 1\nYes, more than any one else. And why 1\nBecause he was purer and better in every way .....\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 147\nAll this does not amount to much, and it would be quite easy\nto suppress this portion ;\nbut, as it was at that time a part of the\nphenomenon, it is thought fairer to quote a specimen of what could\nbe got when rein was given, as in this instance, to anything that\ncame. Usually unverifiable utterances of this kind were not\nencouraged.\nHere also I might insert the summary made by Dr. Hodgson in\n1897 of what the communicators themselves say as to what appears\nto them to be occurring on the physical side while they are com-\nmunicating. Their statements, he says, may be put in brief general\nterms as follow (I quote from Vol. 13, p. 400).\n\"We all have bodies composed of '\nluminiferous ether' enclosed\nin our flesh and blood bodies. The relation of Mrs. Piper's etherial\nbody to the etherial world, in which the 'communicators' claim to\ndwell, is such that a special store of peculiar energy is accumulated\nin connection with her organism, and this appears to them as '\na\nlight.' Mrs. Piper's etherial body is removed by them, and her\nordinary body appears as a shell filled with this 'light.' Several\n'\ncommunicators ' may be in contact with this light at the same\ntime.\n\" There are two chief '\nmasses ' of it in her case, one in connection\nwith the head, the other in connection with the right arm and\nhand. Latterly, that in connection with the hand has been 'brighter'\nthan that in connection with the head. If the 'communicator' gets\ninto contact with the 'light' and thinks his thoughts, they tend to\nbe reproduced by movements in Mrs. Piper's organism. Very few\ncan produce vocal effects, even when in contact with the '\nlight ' of\nthe head, but practically all can produce writing movements when\nin contact with the 'light' of the hand. Upon the amount and\nbrightness of this '\nlight,' aeteris paribus, the communications depend.\nWhen Mrs. Piper is in ill-health, the '\nlight ' is feebler, and the\ncommunications tend to be less coherent.\n\" It also gets used up during a sitting, and when it gets dim\nthere is a tendency to incoherence even in otherwise clear com-\nmunicators. In all cases, coming into contact with this '\nlight ' tends\nto produce bewilderment, and if the contact is continued too long,\nor the '\nlight ' becomes very dim, the consciousness of the communicator\ntends to lapse completely.\"\nNeedless to say that in thus making a jirtcis of a number of\nstatements, Dr. Hodgson is not to be supposed as in any degree\nvouching for their accuracy, nor even for their reasonable sense\n\f148 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nhe goes on, in fact, to give his own independent view of the matter\n\u2014but such statements are interesting and deserve study as part\nof the phenomenon. They must certainly represent a subjective or\ndream-like imjjression of some true and ultimately intelligible kind.\nAs a further example of non-evidential statement I quote a state-\nment made about the difficulty of recalling old memories, which I\nfind among some reports made to me by Mr. Dorr of remarks made\nto a lady during a sitting in America in 1906 (cf. pp. 202-5).\n(The Hodgson control communicating by the voice.)\nSitter. I want you to tell me something that you do on your side.\nYou saw Mr. Dorr yesterday. Now what have you done\nsince you saw him 1\nOh, Myers and I, we have formed a society over here. I\nsuppose you know that ?\nSitter. Yes.\nAnd we are investigating the conditions that constitute a\nmedium, and I have been studying that very carefully\nsince I was here yesterday, and that is the work in\nwhich I am engaged now. I am also looking up mediums\non the earthly side and trying to find those through\nwhom it would be safe to speak. Is that clear 1\nSitter. Perfectly.\n(Rector communicating.) Oh, I hear his voice just as plain\nas I ever heard anything. It is very clear. Some things,\nwhen dissolution takes place, go so completely out of\none's mind that it takes time to recall those incidents.\nThe impressions and thoughts in the mortal mind are\nremoved when the spirit is released, temporarily. It takes\ntime to recall those memories. Is that clear 1\nIncidentally, and as a continuation of non-evidential matter, I\nwill also quote a little bit of Phinuitesque assertion about Christmas\nday which was previously omitted from the report on page 516,\nVol. 6. I insert it now because it is not now my object to deal\nwith verifiable incidents alone, which by this time are numerous,\nbut to give an idea of the manner and method of the whole\nbusiness\u2014especially as it was in the old days.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 149\nThe sitting opens with a curious episode, characteristic of the\nrelation between the controls and the medium. They sometimes\nspeak of 'seeing a woman going away' as they come in. A new\ncontrol often does not know who she is, or what she has to do with\nthe business. For instance, on page 453, Vol. 6, a '\nMr. Wilson ' is\nsupposed to be controlling, and to him I am explaining the\ndesirability of eliminating the hypothesis of telepathy from the\nsitter \" whose mind might be influencing that of the medium \"\nwhen he replies :\nI see your idea, but what do you mean by the '\nmedium ' 1\nThat woman I saw just now 1\n?\n0. J. L. Yes.\nPhinuit of course knows her well. Sometimes the control\nspeaks of having tried to grasp the 'spirit of the light' and\ngive it a message as it was returning to its body. (See p. 96 of\nJ. G. P.'s Report, Vol. 22.) Whether the same kind of thing\nhappens sometimes in pathological cases of multiple personality I am\nnot sure.\nEvening of 25th Dec, 1889. Control at first Phinuit.\nPresent\u20140. J. L. anil Professor Alfred Lodge.\nCaptain, do you know that as I came I met the medium\ngoing out, and she's crying. Why is she crying ?\n[\" Captain \" was the humorous nickname employed by Phinuit\nto designate 0. J. L.]\n0. J. L. Well the fact is she's separated from her children for a few\ndays, and to-day being Christmas day she is feeling\nrather low about it.\nChristmas day ! Do you think we don't know that 1\nO. J. L. Oh do you 1\nCertainly, it's the day Christ was born isn't it, and he\nalways appears to us on that day.\n0. J. L. Do you not often see him ?\nNo, he's much higher. I have only seen him two or three\ntimes. He's very high up.\n\f150 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nI have got your mother's influence very strong : she's been\ntalking to Edmund Gurney\u2014a nice fellow he is \u2014she's\nvery fond of you ; he'll tell her all about you. She has\ngot on a good way since she passed out. Do you know\nwhat we mean by Christ's appearing 1\n0. J. L. No.\nWe have to express it in your language. He comes to-day\nwith a basket of flowers, forget-me-nots, and gives them\nto the little children. They are awfully pleased when\nthey see him coming. (Cf. a somewhat similar statement\non p. 545, Vol. 6.)\nHow are you Alfred 1 I've your mother's influence strong.\n[And so on as already reported, p. 516, ending,]\nConvince yourself, and let others do the same. We are all\nliable to make mistakes, but you can see for yourself.\nHere's a gentleman wants to speak to you.\n(Phinuit now seemed to leave, and another control, speaking\nin a more educated voice, took his place ; the change\ntaking place with a little uncertainty and difficulty\nas to how to manage it, and a seeming colloquy\nbetween the departing and entering controls, \u2014Phinuit\ngiving sotto voce instructions. After the change was\nover, the voice said)\nLodge, how are you ? I tell you Edmund Gurney is living,\nnot dead. Edmund Gurney that's me : you know me\ndon't you ?\n0. J. L. Yes Gurney, delighted to see you again.\nDon't give it up Lodge. Cling to it, it's the best thing\nyou have. It's coarse in the beginning but it can be\nground down fine. You'll know best and correct (?) It\ncan only come through a trance. You have to put her\nin a trance. You've got to do it that way to make\nyourself known.\n0. J. L. Is it bad for the medium 1\nIt's the only way Lodge ; in one sense it's bad, but in another\nit's good. It is her work. If I take possession of the\nmedium's body, and she goes out, then I can use her\norganism to tell the world important truths. There is\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 151\nan infinite power above us. Lodge believe it fully,\ninfinite over all, most marvellous.\nOne can tell a medium she's like a ball of light. You look\nas dark and material as possible, but we find two or\nthree lights shining. It's like a series of rooms with\ncandles at one end. Must use analogy to express it.\nWhen you need a light you use it, when you have\nfinished you put it out. They are like transparent\nwindows to see through.\nLodge, it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle to us here in a way\nthough we understand it better than you. I work at\nit hard. I do. I'd give anything I possess to find out.\nI don't care for material things now, our interest is\nmuch greater. I am studying hard how to communi-\ncate ; it's not easy. But it's only a matter of a short\ntime before I shall be able to tell the world all sorts\nof things through one medium or another. \u2014Who's that 1\n0. J. L. It's my brother. He's taking notes.\nMake experiments, observe, record, Lodge. Observation and\nexperiment are indispensable.\nI have seen your father, but am not very well acquainted\nwith him.\nI suppose people thought I was well, but I wasn't. No, far\nfrom it. Lodge if I could take the same body and be\nthe same as before I wouldn't take it. I would far\nrather be as I am than as I was.\nWhat was that letter you shewed the Doctor 1 [i.e. Phinuit]\n0. J. L. Oh, one you wrote to me about taking the chair for you at\nLiverpool.\nI have met an aunt of yours ; was introduced. A delightful\ncharacter. Not had the advantages many have, but\nthoroughly good and sensible.\n0. J. L. How is it they see their things 1\nI don't know, there is something about articles worn by\nspirits which retains their personality (?) and a spirit\ncontrolling a medium is sensitive to such. In nine cases\nout of ten they will recognise their things ; it doesn't\ncome from your mind.\n\f152 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\n0. J. L. Then it's not ordinary thought transference.\nNo, it's not that. Investigate. You can verify with patience.\nFrom time to time you will hear from me and I will\nadvise you.\nI met a lady in America\u2014a Mrs. Dorr. [A lady well\nknown to Mrs. Piper, but I did not happen to know\nthe name then. 0. J. L.~\\\n0. J. L. Daw ?\nNo, Dorr, D (\no,r,r, a very nice lady; very intellectual spiritual\nand good. I had a long talk with her, and through her\nI found the medium. She is a medium. These people\nare links between the material and spirit worlds. Their\nspiritual body is stronger than their material body.\nThe light is given to them and to us. Using her\norganism may be bad for her in one sense, but not\nin another. She will never allow herself to be dis-\nhonest. Sometimes she is not well. If the physical\nis ill and depressed you cannot come easily.\nWhere's Myers\n1\n? Give him my love. I want to help him.\nLodge, when I passed out at first I didn't know who\nI was, nor where I was. I hunted about for my friends\nand for my body. Soon however my sister welcomed\nme. Three of them, all drowned. If I see Myers I\nwill talk to him. No spirit in the spirit world is more\nanxious to let friends know than I was.\n[Some private matter here.] Don't mention this.\nTell Myers if you like.\nMyers is my confidential friend.\nThere is nothing I wouldn't have him know.\nKate is my wife my sister is Ellen, [abbreviated]\nLodge keep up your courage ; there is a quantity to hope for\nyet. Hold it up for a time. Don't be in a hurry. Get\nfacts ; no matter what they call you, go on investigating.\nTest to fullest. Assure yourself, then publish. It will\nbe all right in the end\u2014no question about it. It's\ntrue.\n0. J. L. You have seen my Uncle Jerry, haven't you 1\nYes. I met him a little while ago\u2014a very clever man\u2014had\nan interesting talk with him.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 153\n0. J. L. What sort of person is this Dr. Phinuit?\n[It is noteworthy that all the Controls treat Phinuit as a\ngenuine person of whom they have to speak circumspectly\nwhen he is likely to be able to overhear what they are\nsaying or read what they are writing. Compare, for\ninstance, statements about him made by 6. P. in the\nHodgson Eeport; footnote to page 369, Vol. 13.]\nIn the present instance the Gurney Control replied to my question\nthus :\nDr. Phinuit is a peculiar type of man ; he goes about con-\ntinually and is thrown in with everybody. He is eccentric\nand quaint but good hearted. I wouldn't do the things he\ndoes for anything. He lowers himself sometimes ; it's a great\npity. He has very curious ideas about things and people,\nhe receives a great deal about people from themselves (?).\nAnd he gets expressions and phrases that one doesn't care\nfor, vulgar phrases he picks up by meeting uncanny\npeople through the medium. These things tickle him\nand he goes about repeating them. He said to me the\nother day '\nMr. Gurney what you think a gentleman said\nto me the other day : he said \" put that in your pipe and\nsmoke it Dr.\"' He picks up this sort of thing and it\ntickles him. He has to iuterview a great number of\npeople and has no easy berth of it. A high type of\nman couldn't do the work he does. But he is a good-\nhearted old fellow. Good-bye Lodge. Here's the Doctor\ncoming.\n0. J. L. Good-bye Gurney. Glad to have had a chat with you.\n(The Control here changes back again.)\nThis [ring] belongs to your Aunt.\nYour Uncle Jerry tells me to ask . . .\nBy the way, do you know Mr. Gurney 's been here ; did you\nhear him 1\n0. J. L. Yes, I've had a long talk with him.\nwants you to ask Uncle Bob about his cane.\n[And so on as already reported on page 517, Vol. 6.]\nThe Gurney control appeared only once more in that year 1889,\non the evening of Dec. 26, and speedily disappeared, \u2014as we were, so\n\f154 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nto speak, engaged. It seems to have been the third sitting held on\nthe same day, and the last before Mrs. Piper went on to London.\nThis crowding of three sittings into one day now seems extraordinary,\nand cannot have been wise. However, they were by no means bad\nones\u2014in fact they were distinctly good.\nThe following is the report : it has already been given on p. 524,\nVol. 6.\nEvening of 26th Dec, 1889. Present\u20140. J. L., M. L., and\nMr. and Mrs. Thompson.\n(Dr. Phinuit speaking and reporting in the first person.)\nI could almost come back and die over again to see you.\nYou tell Mary that her sister Isabel still lives \u2022\ntell her\nshe has done nobly ; tell her William and I are together.\nThat lazy gardener !\n(Then the voice and manner changed to that of the Gurney\ncontrol.)\nDon't give up a good thing, Lodge. . . . Who is here ?\n0. J. L. This is my wife.\nHow do you do, Mrs. Lodge (shaking hands).\nI remember having tea with you once.\n[It was true that Mr. Gurney had done so.]\n0. J. L. (Introducing) Mr. and Mrs. Thompson.\nYes, I remember you, I think. [They had once met.]\nGood-bye, Lodge ; don't divulge my secrets.\n0. J. L. No, all right ;\ngood-bye.\n(Then Dr. Phinuit appeared again and said to Mr. T.)\nTed is asking about George.\nDon't forget to tell him I asked about him, and send my love.\n[And so on as reported on page 524, Vol. 6.]\nThe point of this short episode is the sudden and natural stoppage of\nthe conversation directly the control realises that strangers are\npresent. That and the introductions that followed were all just as\nif the Gurney control were a person really present.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 155\nMrs. Piper returned to Liverpool, from London, at the end of\nJanuary, 1890, and we held sittings again until it was time for her\nto depart to America.\nThe Gurney control appeared again on Feb. 3rd, and the following\nis the report.\nAt a sitting with Mrs. Piper, on Monday Evening, 3 February,\n1890. Present\u20140. J. L. and E. C. L., afterivards Mr. and Mrs.\nTlwmpson.\nThis sitting began with conversation with Phinuit and messages\nto Miss E. C. Lodge, who was present, and a final communication\nalso from \"Mr. Wilson\", as reported on page 552, Vol. 6. (It\nmay be interesting now to record that this \" Mr. Wilson,\" junior,\nthere spoken of as travelling, was my friend the Rev. John Watson\n\u2014afterwards known as Ian Maclaren \u2014at that time on a tour in\nEgypt.) Then Phinuit suddenly said, \" Here's Mr. Gurney.\"\n(Thereupon the control appeared to change, the impression\nsomehow conveyed being very much as if Phinuit were\nleaving and another coming in his place. The voice also\nbecame different and more educated than before. No\nlonger was I called '\nCaptain ', nor were people's relations\nand personal affairs any more regarded as objects of\ninterest.)\nHere's Mr. Gurney \u2014(change of control).\nLodge don't loose hold of a good thing. I could have done\nmuch for the Society if I had lived, but I can do still\nmore now. It is wonderfully difficult to communicate.\nAll the time I've been here I have only found two\nmediums beside this one. More people might be mediums,\nbut many won't when they can.\n0. J. L. What constitutes a medium ?\nNot too much spirituality and not too much animalism, not\nthe highest people and not the lowest. Sympathetic and\nnot too self-conscious, able to let their minds be given up\nto another\u2014that sort of person\u2014easily influenced. Many\ncould, but their pride and a sense of self comes in and\nspoils it.\n\f156 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\n0. J. L. Gurney, what about those table-tilting and physical things 1\nIs there anything in them ?\nMostly fraud. The rest electricity. A person's nerves are\ndoing they don't know what. They are often not\nconscious when they move things.\n0. J. L. It's like automatic writing then 1\nSomething. Often the tilts and noises are made by them\nwhen under the control of some other spirit, and then the\nmessage may be genuine. Trance things and automatic\nwriting are good. Often good. Other things sometimes,\nbut mostly fraud.\n0. J. L. Can things be moved without contact ?\nNo. All bosh.\n0. J. L. Then that Eglinton writing, with bits of pencil untouched 1\nTrickery Lodge. Not worth a thought. Most of this I have\ngone into, and it's as false as that elf, that fiend I might\nsay. She bewitched me once. What's her name, that\nwoman who smoked 1\n0. J. L. Blavatsky 1\nThat's her name.\n0. J. L. And what about those Indian tricks ? Mango and basket\ntricks 1\nI do not know about the mango, don't remember it ; but you\nmean that cutting up a child and flinging its legs and\narms about.\nO. J. L. Yes, that's one of them.\nIt's a veil Lodge, an etherial veil between the thing and the\nspectators. They can't see what really happens. It's a\ndelusion, it's done through ether. It's not true spiritualism,\nit's a gap in ether p] But true spiritualism has been real\never since the first life that had any humanity in it.\nWhat are you, Lodge ?\n0. J. L. I don't know.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. lo7\nYou've not made it out. You are a reflexion of Christ, and\nChrist's a reflexion of God. We praise and bless him\nwithout tiring. Lodge, I wouldn't be back for anything.\nI was not happy, and I was not well. Not at all\nwell.\nLodge, I told Myers what I told you. It's secret.\n0. J. L. Yes I know, I am forgetting it.\nThat's right. Myers is the soul of honour, a real friend, a\ntrue man. I told it you as a test. Forget it.\n0. J. L. Eight, I have promised you before.\nYes, I know. Who is this?\n0. J. L. It's my sister, a young girl.\nOh ;\npleased to make your acquaintance.\nI didn't meet you I think.\nE. C. L. No, I never saw you.\nGlad to see you now. I wrote a little book once, \"The\nPower of Sound.\" Did you ever read it 1\nE. C. L. No.\nYou might by chance be interested in it.\nLodge I will shew you some verses I have written up here\nsome day.\nPhinuit will be coming back soon.\nHe's a good old man. He has a hard place. I wouldn't\ndo the work he does for anything. Seeing all manner\nof people and hunting up their friends, and often he has\nhard work to persuade them that they are really\nwanted.\n0. J. L. Is he reliable \\\nNot perfectly, he is not a bit infallible. He mixes things\nterribly sometimes.\nHe does his best; he's a good old man but he does get\nconfused, and when he can't hear distinctly he fills it\nup himself. He does invent things occasionally, he cer-\ntainly does. Sometimes he has very hard work.\n\f158 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\n0. J. L. Are his medical prescriptions any good 1\nOh, he's a shrewd doctor. He knows his business thoroughly.\nHe can see into people, and is very keen on their\ncomplaints.\nYes, he is good in that way, very good.\n0. J. L. Can he see ahead at all 1 Can any one 1\nI can't. I haven't gone into that.\nI think Phinuit can a iittle sometimes. He can do wonder-\nful things ; he has studied these things a good deal\nhe can do many things that I can't do. He can look\nup people's friends and say what they are doing some-\ntimes in an extraordinary way. But he is far from\nbeing infallible.\n0. J. L. The Thompsons are waiting in next room. Shall I call them\nin 1\nThe Thompsons? Oh, I know, I met them at your house\nonce at dinner I think. No, I don't specially want to\nsee them.\nWell Lodge I must be going. Good-bye. Stick to a good\nthing and don't give it up. Go on with the investi-\ngation. I will help you. This will be the thing of the\nfuture, and will increase people's happiness. More\nmediums will arise, and communication will be easier.\nGood-bye.\n(Here the medium seemed to sleep -a few moments, and\nthen woke up again in the Phinuit manner, putting out\nhand and feeling sitter's head.)\nEh, what. Oh, yes. All right. [This was internal colloquy.]\nLook here, Mr. Gurney has been here ; he told me to express\nhis regret that he had not said good-bye to Miss\nLodge.\nE. C. L. Oh it doesn't matter a bit.\nI'm to tell him that, am I. Very well.\n(Mr. and Mrs. T. had come in.)\nHere's Dr. Thompson [etc. as reported in Vol. 6, page 553].\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 159\nAgain it was the dramatic character of the speaking that was\nimpressive \u2014rather than the things said. The conversation was\ncarried on in an exceedingly easy and natural manner. I attach no\nimportance to what is said concerning physical phenomena : it does\nnot pretend to represent more than an individual opinion, whoever\nthe individual may be ; but it seemed to me interesting to ask this\nsort of question, to see what would be said.\nThe casual reference of unknown phenomena, part to fraud the\nrest to \"Electricity,\" though quite common with uneducated people,\nwas especially unworthy of Edmund Gurney, and not in the least\nthe sort of thing he would have said to me when alive. In\nPhantasms of the Living he writes humorously of the excellent\npeople who are ready to jump lightly from the hypothesis of\n\"fraud\" to that of \"electricity\", and suggests that they are equally\ninnocent of either form of energy ! But the little friendly speeches\nto my sister were quite appropriate to Mr. Gurney, and so especi-\nally was the readiness to depart the instant he heard that the\nThompsons were waiting to come in.\n\" The Thompsons 1 Oh, I know. I met them at your\nhouse once at dinner I think. No, I don't specially\nwant to see them. Well, Lodge, I must be going.\nGood-bye.\"\nNot that he had any objection to them ;\nbut, besides the dislike\nof keeping anyone waiting, he had the natural unwillingness of the\nman of sensitive temperament to be thrown with strangers needlessly.\nIt will have been observed that several times in the record I have\nemphasised the change of control. I have done so all the more ex-\nplicitly because now it seems a comparatively extinct, or at any rate a\nless pronounced, feature. The whole business of 'control' seemed more\ndifficult then, and it is possible that a personality really changes now\nwithout our noticing the change so much. Then, however, the change\nof control was a distinct operation, sometimes appearing to be really\na difficult one, that could not be managed in a hurry ; and once I\nremember it occupied a minute or two, with a muttered internal\ncolloquy going on, as if there were a tangle or a hitch somewhere.\nThe naturalness of the change in manner and memory was very\npronounced. Even a reader can perceive that; but a reader may\nthink that this is due to the perfection of conscious acting, while a\nsitter of any experience will hardly think that. The fluctuation of\nmemory is certainly not artificial, it is a genuine change of personality\n\fIGO Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\n\u2014whatever that may be. People may legitimately hold that the\nchange is some kind of subliminal modification\u2014that depends on\nthe view they take as to the meaning and nature of control in\ngeneral \u2014but it is unmistakably analogous to multiple personality,\nwhether that be ever due to control by actual possession or not.\nUndoubtedly actual control or telergic possession used to be claimed\nfor some of the more experienced communicators. For instance, at\na sitting on the morning of February 3rd, 1890 (as reported on\np. 550, Vol. 6), I asked for a certain person to come and control\ninstead of only sending messages, and was told that it was too\ndifficult. I pleaded 1;\nMr. G-urney does.\" To which Phinuit replied,\n\"You are greedy. Yes, Mr. Gurney does, but Mr. Gurney is a\nscientific man, who has gone into these things. He comes and\nturns me out sometimes. It would be a very narrow place into\nwhich Mr. Gurney couldn't get.\"\nThe appearance of direct control is even now preserved, and at\nvoice sittings held in 1906, after Hodgson's death, must have seemed\nrather realistic. Moreover, the Hodgson control often says that the\nconditions are stuffy and confusing, and that he must go away to\nget air sometimes,\u2014the extracts on pp. 134 and 236 suggest that he\nand Rector were interchanging places ; \u2014and yet, when questioned,\n\" Hodgson \" disclaims the exertion of immediate control.\nThe following, for instance, is an extract from a sitting with Mr.\nDorr, who is speaking to the Hodgson control.\nG. B. D. I wanted to ask whether you ever controlled the organism\nof the light yourself, or whether it is wholly done by\nRector.\nIt is wholly done by Rector and it will continue to be. I\nshall take no part in that.\nG. B. D. Then it is he who is speaking 1\nIt is Rector who is speaking and he speaks for me. I have\nno desire to take Rector's place. I trust him implicitly\nand absolutely.\nG. B. D. And he constantly reports for every one ?\nEvery one. There is no question about that. In the first\nplace he is more competent to do it, he understands the\nconditions better than any individual spirit; he is fully\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter II. 161\ncapable and is under the constant direction of Imperator.\nWhen I finished with the conditions in the earthly life\nI finished with ray control over the light.\nSo it would appear that the changes of control claim to be now\nusually dramatic rather than real.\nBut, as said before, these dramatic changes of personality are much\nless marked and less frequent features in the sittings of to-day.\nThey still appear to occur occasionally, but they are not so striking\nand vivid as they used to be.\nIt was on the strength of the experience gained by a number of\nsuch transitions of personality that I wrote in 1890 my introduction\nas printed on p. 453, Vol. 6, from which I will now quote a small\nportion :\n\" On reading the record it will be apparent that while '\nPhinuit\nfrequently speaks in his own person, relating things which he\nhimself discovers by what I suppose we must call ostensible\nclairvoyance, sometimes he represents himself as in communication\n\u2014not always quite easy and distinct communication, especially\nat first, but in communication\u2014with one's relatives and friends\nwho have departed this life. The messages and communi-\ncations from these persons are usually given through Phinuit\nas a reporter. And he reports sometimes in the third person,\nsometimes in the first. Occasionally, but very seldom, Phinuit\nseems to give up his place altogether to the other personality,\nfriend or relative, who then communicates with something of\nhis old manner and individuality ;\nbecoming often impressive and\nrealistic. This last I say is rare, but with one or two person-\nages it occurs, subject to reservations to be mentioned directly\nand when it does, Phinuit does not appear to know what has\nbeen said. It is quite as if he in his turn evacuated the body,\njust as Mrs. Piper had done, while a third personality uses it\nfor a time. The voice and mode of address are once more\nchanged, and more or less recall the voice and manner of the\nperson represented as communicating.\n\" The communications thus obtained, though they show traces\nof the individuality of the person represented as speaking, are\nfrequently vulgarised ; and the speeches are more commonplace,\nand so to say cheaper, than what one would suppose likely\nfrom the person himself. It can, of course, be suggested that\nthe necessity of working through the brain of a person not\nL\n\f162 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nexceptionally educated may easily be supposed capable of\ndulling the edge of refinement, and of rendering messages\non abstruse subjects impossible.\"\nEnd of the Owrney set.\nCHAPTER III.\nTHE ISAAC THOMPSON CASE.\nThe next case I shall take will be that of the late Isaac C.\nThompson, F.L.S., for a long time my neighbour and friend in\nLiverpool. His family made the acquaintance of Mrs. Piper during\nher stay with me there, and had several sittings. They are specially\nreferred to on pages 455 and 523 of Vol. 6, and all the sittings\nthen held with them are fully reported (pp. 508, 523, 544, 553).\nWe owe them thanks for allowing the report to be printed without\nreserve or anonymity. It is always more interesting when this\ncan be done ; and in practice it has been found that people of\na low order, who from mischief or malice might possibly cause\ntrouble and annoyance, are not sufficiently interested in our Pro-\nceedings to take any notice of them.\nExcessive reticence, therefore, seems to be unnecessary ; and it was\non that basis that I drew up the whole of my 1889-90 report.\nIt must be understood that the wife of the above Isaac Thompson\nhas no connexion whatever with the (to S.P.R. members) better known\nMrs. Thompson, formerly of Hampstead, whom I shall have to\nmention in some portions\u2014especially in chapter IV. \u2014of my report.\nAs an introduction to this set, I will first quote what I said for\nthe same purpose in 1890 as printed on p. 455, Vol. 6.\n\"One of the best sitters was my next-door neighbour, Isaac\nC. Thompson, F.L.S., to whose name indeed, before he had\nbeen in any way introduced, Phinuit sent a message purporting\nto come from his father. Three generations of his and of his\nwife's family living and dead (small and compact Quaker families)\nwere, in the course of two or three sittings, conspicuously men-\ntioned, with identifying detail ; the main informant representing\nhimself as his deceased brother, a young Edinburgh doctor, whose\nloss had been mourned some 20 years ago. The familiarity and\ntouchingness of the messages communicated in this particular\ninstance were very remarkable, and can by no means be repro-\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 163\nduced in any printed report of the sitting. (Nos. 45, 50, 80,\n81, 83, Vol. 6.) Their case is one in which very few mistakes\nwere made, the details standing out vividly correct, so that in\nfact they found it impossible not to believe that their relatives\nwere actually speaking to them. This may sound absurd, but\nit correctly represents the impression produced by a favourable\nseries of sittings, and it is for that reason that 1 mention it\nnow. Simple events occurring elsewhere during the sitting were\nalso detected by Dr. Phinuit in their case, better than in any\nother I know of.\"\nTo this I have only to add that in 1906, when the recent series\nof sittings was held, one of the three daughters, who in 1889 were\nchildren, was married, and the son engaged ; that the grandmother,\nalive in 1889, was now dead ; and I regret to say that Isaac\nThompson himself had suddenly died of an apoplectic seizure in his\nown house on the 6th November, 1903.\nThe interest of the family at the present time therefore lay in\nreceiving communications if possible from him : and it is the episodes\nconnected with that very natural desire, and with the corresponding\nappearance of an Isaac Thompson control, that I now proceed to\ndeal.\nThe first attempt at reaching this control through Mrs. Piper\noccurred during a business visit of the son, Edwin Thompson, to\nAmerica; when Dr. Hodgson introduced him as a stranger\u2014not by\nname\u2014to Mrs. Piper in trance at her house near Boston.\nThe effort was, I consider, unsuccessful ;\npartly in all probability\nowing to the inexperience of the sitter. The position is a very diffi-\ncult one. He had had no previous experience of the sittings ; because\nin 1889, when Mrs. Piper was in Liverpool, he was only 8 years\nold. Besides, the character of the sittings had changed, and the\nwriting of Rector is not at all easy for a novice to read.\nSuffice it therefore to say that Edwin Thompson was introduced\nanonymously by Dr. Hodgson after the trance had begun on Monday,\n11 December, 1905, at Boston. Messages purported to come from\nhis father, who seemed to wonder how his son had \" managed to\nfind him.\" It was however a bad sitting and evidentially blank.\nUndoubtedly there ought to have been another sitting without\ndelay, to clear up this unsatisfactory interview, which clearly estab-\nlished nothing whatever ;\nthough I believe that Mr. E. Thompson\nis on the whole more satisfied with it than these remarks of mine\nwould suggest ; but unfortunately he had to return to England\n\f164 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nimmediately, and at the next sitting he was not present. From\nsome points of view\u2014however unfortunate it undoubtedly was\u2014this\nabsence of any connecting link at ensuing sittings held by E.\nHodgson or others in America may be held to strengthen the\nevidence, provided anything further was obtained\u2014as it was ; since\nnow the facts could hardly be supposed to be obtained from the\nSitter ; American strangers naturally knowing nothing about\nthe family, and Dr. Hodgson being a complete stranger to\nthem all, except E. T., whose slight acquaintance he had only just\nmade.\nThe Sitter on 12 Dec. 1905, was a Miss M., who the same evening\nsent a Special Delivery letter to Dr. Hodgson conveying a message\nentrusted to her by the control George Pelham, She wrote:\n\"'There was a message for you,' George saith. 'Tell Hodgson\nthat name the gentleman in the spirit tried to get was\nAgnes.' They said you would know, and it was the\nday before.\"\nThis evidently refers to a name '\nAnna ' attempted near the end\nof the omitted sitting. The name Agnes is quite appropriate\u2014being\nthe name of a daughter\u2014and would have been jumped at by Edwin\nThompson if it had occurred while he was present as sitter. It is\nnoteworthy that Agnes was a name that Phinuit in the old days\nhad always boggled over, pretending he could not pronounce it\nhis best attempt being something like Annese or Anyese, see Vol. 6,\np. 478 ; but when taken unawares he could pronounce it well enough,\nthough he quickly changed it to Adnes before repeating it. See\np. 509.\nOn the next day, 13 Dec, 1905, Dr. Hodgson had a sitting; when\nEector, after script relating to other matters had been obtained, wrote\nas reported below :\nSitting with Mrs. Pijjcr in America, 13 Dec, 1905.

[part\nThis is a great improvement on what had been obtained at\nthe sitting before, and indicates considerable anxiety on the part\nof the Isaac Thompson control to manifest himself, since this time\nhe had to overcome the difficulty of talking to a complete stranger;\nand save for the mention of my name as a common friend of Hodgson\nand himself, it is doubtful if anything could have been got. The\nexcitement which the hand displays, as here at the mention of\nLodge and Liverpool, is characteristic. On such occasions it twists\nand squirms about and frequently breaks the point of the pencil by\npressure against the paper. It is as if the nerves conveyed too strong\na stimulus to the muscles, so that until the excitement abates no\nwriting can go on.\nThe bottles and drugs mentioned are symbolic of his profession.\n(See p. 525, Vol. 6, and cf. a similar case near foot of page 554,\nVol. 6.) The things said are all true and appropriate.\nOne of the most curious episodes is the way in which Mrs. Piper's\nname is introduced. R. Hodgson says, in order to introduce\nhimself,\nR. H. I am interested in psychical work and sent Mrs. Piper\nmany years ago to England, \u2014don't you remember seeing\nMrs. Piper?\nPiper 1\nR. H. Yes, and the . .\n(Perturbation in hand.)\nOh yes I remember Piper. Was Mrs. Piper a Medium an\nAmerican lady ?\nR. H. Yes.\nOh yes oh yes I do I do, but I'll find her and come to you\nif it is a possible thing. What is your name 1\nR. H. My name is Hodgson, Richard Hodgson.\nCan't you spell it for me 1\nR. H. Hodgson.\nOh he is telling me thank you greatly.\"\nThe perturbation in hand thus begins again when the name Piper\nis remembered, and then the Thompson control speaks of her as a\n\fLvni.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 171\nmedium he had known, and says he will try to find her now in\norder to communicate.\nWhen it is remembered that the whole thing is being obtained\nthrough Mrs. Piper's body, the curiosity of the position is obvious.\nThe sentence \" oh he is telling me, thank you greatly \" signifies that\nwhereas the Thompson control had been trying to understand with\ndifficulty what Dr. Hodgson was saying, he was now being told on\non his own side by G. P., whom he thanks\u2014all this by-play being,\nnow as often, automatically recorded by the writing hand.\nThe way in which he receives the information that Hodgson\nis in America, \u2014where in 1884 Isaac Thompson had been with me\nalone for nine weeks, \u2014is also very natural ; and his enquiry as to\nwhether Hodgson is a living person or not is curious.\nIt is quite true that Mrs. Thompson wore spectacles, though of\ncourse this was within Mrs. Piper's own knowledge. In the previous\nset (p. 524, Vol. 6) a sister of Mr. Thompson's was represented as\nunfamiliar with them and wanting them taken off. This also was\na correct apprehension of fact at the date referred to.\n\" The lady with my boy \" may well refer to his son's engagement\nthough that was not in Mrs. Piper's normal knowledge, and pre-\nsumably not in Dr. Hodgson's either. But of course this sort of\nthing can be guessed; and E. T. had clearly hinted it. (Cf. p. 176).\nIn fact although there is nothing very much obtained, and little\nthat can be called really evidential, because of Mrs. Piper's previous\nnormal knowledge, \u2014provided any clue to the particular family had\nbeen conveyed during Edwin Thompson's sitting, in the course of\nwhich I observe that he had mentioned the name \" Theodora \" and\nalso spoken of \"the business,\"\u2014 there is nothing that is inapplicable\nor foreign to the person represented, or in the least untrue, as soon\nas communication really began ; and there is much in the dramatic\ndetails that I find distinctly interesting.\nSittings in 1906.\nIt may be that when the American records of this period are\nhunted through, a few other brief manifestations of the Isaac Thompson\ncontrol may be found in them, For a record has been sent me by\nMr. Piddington of an incident which was unexpectedly interpolated\nin a sitting of his during a visit to America in the spring of 1906.\nIt should be premised that Mr. Piddington was ignorant of and\nnot interested in the Thompson family.\nThe following is the relevant extract :\u2014\n\f172 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nPortion of a Sitting held by J. G. P. with Mrs. Piper in Boston\non 23 May, 1906.\nYes, we have much to say to you and we have a message\nto give you from a spirit whom we call Thompson.\nHe wishes to send his love to his wife and children\nand says he is anxious to meet Teddy again.\nJ. G. P. To meet Teddy 1\nThat is what he said.\nJ. G. P. Yes, I think I understand. Could he give any fact?\nHe says he is delighted with the change which has come\nto him and believes it will be a great help to him.\nJ. G. P. By the \" change that has come to him \" does he mean to\nEddy, or Freddy, his son 1\nTed. Ted, Ted.\nJ. G. P. Yes, I will give that message to Ted.\nTell him not to feel anxious about the business as I am\nhelping him constantly.\n(Hand seemed to listen and then wrote)\nI was sorry about Theo's headaches but I know [she] will\nbe better now.\n(J. G. P. read \"Ted's\" instead of \"Theo's.\")\nNot Ted's. Listen. Theodore's. Theo's. (read)\nYes, correct. Oh my, I hardly realized I could speak so well.\nJ. G. P. Was that the spirit Thompson who said that 1\nIt was I myself. I have been waiting this opportunity a\nvery long time.\nJ. G. P. Now can you tell me some incident in your past life that\nmight be a proof of identity? And 1 will send it to\nyour family.\nYes, gladly. I was writing some letters to an uncle hoping\nI might be able to help him just before I came over here.\nTed will U.D. this. [It does not seem to be specially\nappropriate.]\nJ. G. P. Yes ?\nI am very anxious to keep in touch with all my family.\nMore later.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 173\nIt will be observed how natural it is for a sitter or for the ex-\nperimenter in charge to challenge a control to furnish some evidence\nof his identity, or to demand from him a sudden answer to a specific\nquestion.\nIt is quite natural and I suppose inevitable : but that it also is\nto some extent unreasonable must be admitted. Trivial domestic\nincidents are not constantly in one's thoughts, and only when in a\nreminiscent and holiday mood, or under the stimulus of friendly\nchat, does any vivid recollection of such incidents normally occur.\nIt is a common experience that characteristic touches, specific\nphrases, and sparkling sayings, are most likely to come out in the\ngive and take of lively conversation. Silent and solitary brooding,\nthough it may generate valuable and even brilliant ideas in a few\ncases, does not as a rule lead to anything specially personal or\nidentifying\u2014rather the contrary,\u2014such ideas seem to spring up\nimpersonally, or to be supplied from outside, so to speak.\nIt is proverbially difficult to control thoughts to order, and a com-\nmunicator suddenly asked to remember an identifying circumstance, or\nto send an appropriate message, may feel rather as a person feels\nwhen set in front of a phonograph and told to \"say something\nbrilliant for posterity.\" Under these conditions any one with the\ngift might compose some half-doggerel verse perhaps, or might\nremember some poetry more or less accurately,\u2014and indeed that\nis what it appears the controls sometimes actually do\u2014but usually\nthere would be hesitation, requests for delay, and fishing for sugges-\ntions, \u2014something like what we find in the records. The controls\ncannot, unfortunately, be assisted by the give and take of friendly\nand stimulating conversation ;\nfor, under the conditions of a sitting,\nthe intercourse on our side is nearly all \" take \" and very little\n\"give.\" It is admittedly dangerous for a sitter to talk freely, because\nthe conditions then become \"loose,\" and more may be inadvertently\ngiven away than was intended, so that thereafter nothing obtained,\nhowever otherwise good, can be considered evidential. But then\nit must also be admitted\u2014no conversation can be in the full sense\nstimulating or satisfactory if its animation is hampered by a constant\ndesire to keep back as much as possible, lurking in the background.\nIn order to be human a conversation should be whole-hearted\nand free from arrihes pensdes on both sides : but under evidential\nconditions that seems quite impossible. It is one of the many\ndisadvantages under which the investigation of the subject inevitably\nlabours.\n\f174 Sir Oliver Lodge, [part\nSittings in England.\nWe now skip to Nov. 1906, when Mrs. Piper was brought over\nby the S.P.R. to England ; and on landing in Liverpool was met\nby Edwin Thompson on behalf of Mrs. Isaac Thompson, and was\ntaken with her daughters to their home for a few days. On the\nevening of Nov. 9th I went over to Liverpool from Birmingham for\nthe Saturday and Sunday, and we had a couple of sittings, in which\nagain it is the dramatic character of the recognition that can alone\nbe treated as of any interest.\nIn America it was a question, and a minor test, whether the family\ncould be identified. Here in Liverpool of course no test of that\nkind was possible. The getting into communication at a strange\nhouse in America was evidently difficult and tiresome, as the first\n[omitted] sitting, held on 11 Dec. 1905, shows: but here in Isaac\nThompson's own home, so to speak, and with his own family,\nrecognition is easy enough,\u2014though even there, after the interval,\nnot quite sudden. The change of locality seems a barely recognised\nincident, he continues at first to talk to his son much as he had\ntried to do before; but the excitement, when at a certain stage in the\nsitting the widow let her presence be known and her voice heard,\nwas very great and remarkable.\nHere is the record, or so much of it as need be printed.\nI think it desirable to report in full the initial stages of this\nfirst English sitting of the new series, although some of it may be\nconsidered dull and dispiriting ; because it illustrates the difficulty\nthat apparently exists, even under these exceptionally favourable\ncircumstances, at getting into what purports to be clear communica-\ntion with a deceased member of a family, \u2014the difficulty being not\nwholly on one side. And the ultimate vivid recognition, when the\nrecognition stage is reached, is likewise instructive : indeed to persons\npresent it is more than instructive, \u2014it is, in its accessory way,\nwhat may be called 'convincing', \u2014perhaps for the moment more\nconvincing than it ought to be.\n\fLvm.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III 175\nFirst Recent Piper Sitting, Liverpool, 1906.\nHeld at 19 Waverky Road, Liverpool, on Saturday, 10th\nNovember, 1906, beginning at 10.50 a.m., ending about\n12.50 p.m.\nPresent\u2014Mrs. Isaac (Susan) Thompson, Edwin Thompson, and sister,\nwith 0.

Can you give any message that I can tell mother?\n[Note, interpolated by the recorder. The interesting feature in this\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 177\npart of the record is the conscientious anxiety of the sitter not\nto give any clue or assistance to the control. This attitude\u2014the\nresult of instruction from Dr. Hodgson on the other side the\nAtlantic\u2014was specially appropriate at the Boston sitting to which\nE. T. was introduced as an anonymous stranger, though it is less\nuseful and may indeed seem hampering here in his own house at\nLiverpool, with Mrs. Piper staying with the family and knowing them\nall well. It illustrates, however, what is always very marked, how\nnaturally a sitter ignores the normal knowledge of Mrs. Piper and\ntreats it as non-existent. It seems to me that the controls likewise\ntreat it as non-existent, and that her normal knowledge has in reality\nvery little if any influence on the information that is obtained during\nher trance. The trance personalities appear to be ignorant of, or to be\ngroping after, a number of things that Mrs. Piper knows quite well,\nand, on the other hand, to attain knowledge of which she is and\nremains entirely ignorant until she reads these records ;\n\u2014which it is\nto be presumed she does when they are printed and published,\nnot before. (See further remarks on this subject below, page 181.)\nNow, however, the sitting enters on a more natural phase] :\nTell her I am sorry I did not understand about coming here.\nHad I, I should have arranged things differently for her.\nTake good care of her will you\n1\n?\nE. T. She is here, would yon like to speak with her?\nOh yes, oh yes, oh yes. Why did you not tell me before ?\nMes. T. Do you see me ?\nI hear her speak.\n(Excitement. Breaks pencil.)\nIsa\nMrs. T. Do you see me 1\nI do, I do, I do, I do.\nIsaac.\nMes. T. Can you call me by my name 1\nSSSA.\nLet me free my mind and tell you how I feel.\nI am not dead now, but I am speaking with you.\nIsauc. I am he. Do you remember\nIssa. Issa.\nSusa. Susa.\nM\n\f178 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nMrs. T. Can you help me about Theodora 1\nYes I can now, but I did not before.\nDear, are you tired ? Are you tired and discouraged at\ntimes ?\nMrs. T. Yes, Isaac, since you went.\nBetter I came. Think it so.\nCan't you see me ?\nMrs. T. No, I cannot.\nSusar Susan Susu Susin\n(Excitement, scrawls.)\nMrs. T. Shall Theodora come in ? Would you like to see her ?\nYes, more than you think.\nMrs. T. Here is Theodora.\nShe is going to get well and get stronger and better than\never before in all her life.\nShe has light, she has light, but do not use it. It isn't\ngood for her.\nMrs. T. You mean she could write automatically, but is not to try !\nCorrect. Do not let her do so, I beg of you.\nFather. Papa. I wish you to get all good out of that\nlife : that let me desire for you. [1]\nDear Theo, you have a claim to health\u2014it is your right.\nT. T. Can you tell me anything I should do to get strong?\nYes, I'll ask the Doctor, I'll call the Doctor.\n(Change of control.)\nCome here.\n(Then the control calling itself \"Doctor\" entered into long\nmedical details and precepts.)\nThen the Isaac Thompson control returned and talked of business\nmatters with his son, and was much interested to hear about the\nresult of a lawsuit, begun before he died, and other matters concerning\nwhich Edwin Thompson gave information. The reception of the\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 179\ninformation was perfectly appropriate and natural. It concluded\nthus :\nGood for you. [?] I shall be happier to understand.\nI tried to tell that man who helped me reach you in America,\nand who is now with me. Did he tell you *?\nI told\nhim before he came over that I was troubled about\nsomething and hoped it would be all right. [Meaning\npresumably the lawsuit which was bearing on his mind.]\nE. T. Are you happy now ?\nYes, I am, very, because I understand and see you all, and\nI am so near you. I spoke of you all to him.\nE. T. Who is that 1\nHis name is Hodgson.\nE. T. Oh yes, Dr. Hodgson. I understand.\nAnd he is helping me now.\n(Interpolation by recorder.)\nI find all these episodes instructive, and the portion about the\nlawsuit was as good as it could be ; but it would be tedious to\nstrangers. The anxiety to be told about it\u2014a matter which had\nweighed on his mind and caused him a good deal of worry just at\nthe end of his life \u2014seemed quite genuine.\nE. T. Have you any messages for mother ?\nAsk her if she understands what I meant by Agnes.\nE. T. Have you any message for Agnes 1\nYes, I love you all so much, so very much.\nI wish you to know it well. Agnes.\nE. T. Would you like to speak to Agnes 1\nI should, I should, I should.\n[Agnes is the married daughter, living in another town. 0. J. L.]\nE. T. Shall she come to-morrow or next day t\nI do not understand. Ask Eector.\n\f180 Sir Oliver Lodge, [part\nMks. T. Would you like her to come to see you ?\nOh yes, much. Do you remember, clear Susan,\n(There appeared now to be some confusion.)\nWhat are you talking about 1 Something is troubling me\nvery much just now. Something. You are all talking\nat once, and I do not understand you.\n0. J. L. Shall we all go out of the room except one 1\nNo, stop talking. What is that fellow doing'?\n(An organ-grinder was playing outside in the street, and\nthe sound coming in through the open window evidently\nintroduced confusion. This must have been what was\nspoken of as \" all talking at once.\")\nWhat are you doing? Stop it, stop it. Rector.\n0. J. L. We have sent out to stop it.\nWhat is he talking about 1\n0. J. L. It was a man outside, we have sent out to stop the noise.\nOh, I understand.\n(The noise ceased.)\nYour father is not quite satisfied with the way in which I\nspelt that name, but I cannot understand it very well. R.\n[This probably referred to some name mentioned in connexion\nwith the business. 0. J. L.]\nE. T. Has my father gone away now ?\nHe is here, but he is getting weak.\nGood-bye for the present, I will speak again. Good-bye\nchildren, I will speak again. Darling S. Are you getting\non well without me? I am looking after you, and when\nyou think of me I am nearest you. You are a part of\nme always. I am a part of you always, a part of you\nalways. Nearest you dear.\n(End.)\nThere was nothing of special interest in the waking stage this time.\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 181\nComment.\nComment on this sitting is not specially necessary : it was a sound\nand satisfactory sitting with a quite realistic impersonation of the\ndeceased, as soon as communication was once established. The\nincidental episode of the disturbance caused by the organ-grinder\noutside is interesting. The sitting was in a room high up, on the\nsecond floor, with the window open. The noise from the outer world\nperturbed the control, as if it were a sort of general conversation\nthat was going on. We, the sitters, were not specially annoyed ; but\nthe fidget of the hand increased until it rebelled, and called for\ncessation of whatever it was that caused the disturbance, \u2014as recorded.\nI am told that Mrs. Piper, in trance, was similarly disturbed by\npassing vans, and by the noise of coal being put on the fire, at\nsittings in London.\nIn continuation of what I have said above (page 177) about the\nnormal knowledge of Mrs. Piper having little or no influence on\nthe knowledge shown by the controls, the instance of the surprise\nand eagerness shown by the Isaac Thompson control when told\nthat Mrs. Isaac Thompson was present is a case in point. For of\ncourse Mrs. Piper had known perfectly well the people likely to be\npresent at the sitting, and had seen them assemble ; it was no\nnews to her. But indeed everything tends to show that during\nthorough trance the normal consciousness is in abeyance. And,\nalthough it is true that we cannot claim anything as evidential\nwhen it comes out in the trance if it had ever been known to Mrs.\nPiper, I myself am unable to trace much, if any, connexion between\nthe trance knowledge and her normal knowledge. For instance, a\nsitter introduced by name is no more likely to have his name\nmentioned during a sitting than one who is introduced as an anony-\nmous stranger. I make a general statement of this kind believing\nthat careful analysis will bear it out, and as a challenge to anyone\nwho will bestow time and labour upon the work of analysing the\nrecords from this point of view. It seems to me a desirable piece\nof work for someone to undertake.\nOf course a sceptic may say that this kind of kenosis is due to\nmere cunning ; but the time for suspicion of that kind is over with\nmost of us investigators. It is a genuine piece of psychological\ninformation that we now desire, not anything analogous to detective\nwork. Detective work is necessary in its proper time and place,\nbut there are cases which have run that gauntlet, and require\nmore advanced treatment. The Piper case is one of them.\n\f182 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nWhen I speak of \"Mrs. Piper's normal knowledge,\" I mean of\ncourse knowledge acquired in her ordinary state. Knowledge acquired\nwhile in the trance state is of course reproducible when in that\nstate, but it appears not to be accessible iu her ordinary state ; and\nvice versa. I do not call that \"normal knowledge.\"\nTo illustrate that the controls themselves feel that their only\naccess to the normal Mrs. Piper is through the agency of her\ndaughter, with whom they can communicate during trance, I extract\na small fragment from a quantity of serious conversation which took\nplace between them and Dr. Hodgson's executors soon after his death.\nMr. Dorr, I think, was conducting the sitting and speaking the\nremarks printed in parentheses.\n\"(We are anxious that the light in the future should not\nbe adrift and astray, and anxious that past relations\nshould not be wholly interrupted by any change of\nenvironment or other.)\nWell, no one could be more anxious about these things or\nmore concerned than we ourselves are, and it hath dis-\nturbed us not a little to see the conditions on the earthly\nside. We are not quite pleased with them because the\nlight cannot know itself, it cannot understand itself. It\nis shut off from communication with us on our side and\nit must remain in ignorance of the methods which we\npursue in our endeavors to reach the mortals on the\nearthly side.\n(But through the daughter, Alta, I have felt that you might\nin a sense reach her.)\nYes, that is the only way.\"\nI do not adduce this as evidence, but as illustrative of how the\nphenomenon represents itself j for when it does so consistently it is\nreasonable to suppose that something true is indicated.\nSitting No. 2 of the Thompsons in Liverpool, on Sunday, 11 Nov.\n0. J. L. again present.\nAfter a brief interlude with the Myers control talking to 0. J. L.\n(see further on), the Isaac Thompson control appeared and continued\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 183\nto the end. There was plenty of family talk of a reasonably\nsatisfactory kind. The following may suffice :\n[In reply to some question.]\nI do, I do, and remember my brother who was lame.\nJoe.\nE. T. Did you say Joe 1\nYes.\nE. T. Is he with you now ?\nNo, no.\nE. T. Is Joe my uncle 1 It is Ted speaking. Do you mean Ted's\nuncle 1\nI do, Yes. Tell him I send my love to him, also greetings\nfrom this life [?] Tell him I thank him for all his kind-\nness to you all, and I will do all I can to help him in\nreturn.\nDo you understand 1 Why do you not repeat after him ?\nRector.\nE. T. We were trying to read it.\nI will now read it over, (does so).\nIs that right ?\nYes, all is well.\nE. T. Do you wish him thanked ']\nYes, I thank, I thank.\nHave you got it ?\nE. T. Can you explain further who Joe is ?\nYes I can. Where is mother? She will understand.\nMrs. T. Do you mean Joe Coventry 1\nYes.\nMrs. T. Is he helping now ?\nNo, not now.\nMrs. T. Did he help us before 1\nI thought so.\n\f184 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nE. T. Yes it is quite true that he did when you went away and we\nwere in trouble. He did help us a good deal.\nGood. I like you to understand, and I like it very much.\nIt helps me much to recall, recall, recall, things for\nyou.\nI want you to know I live.\nI want you to know I live. (Repeated because misread.)\n0. J. L. Can you send something to prove your identity 1\nHello Lodge. Well if I ever saw anything so strange.\n0. J. L. Hullo Thompson. Glad to see you again.\nGood. Do you remember a talk, in fact many, we had about\nthis ?\n0. J. L Cannot read that.\nA talk, in fact many.\n0. J. L. Yes, I do indeed.\nI used to wonder how much I could believe, and now I am\nto prove it for your world.\n0. J. L. Yes, that is what we want.\nHello.\n0. J. L. We want you to prove your identity.\nGood. I am getting clearer every minute.\nI see you all better than ever before.\nMay I speak to my wife alone ]\n(All go out but Mrs. T.)\nMrs. T. Do you see me Isaac ?\nYes I do see you dear, and I love you dearly. I see it\nclearly. I know you are, dear, and when you think of\nme I know it. I see. [Etc. No questions being kept,\nthis part is unintelligible. Two sheets are removed by\n0. J. L. from the script, numbered 40 and 41.]\nThe omitted part of the record is appropriate but not strictly\nevidential, as the remarks of the Sitter are not preserved, and some\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 185\nof it is private but I may say that she was called by the right\nabbreviation of her Christian name which he always used. It is\nworth noting that in a previous set the '\nUncle Edwin ' called her\nby another abbreviation\u2014which was the appropriate one also in his\ncase. See pp. 523, 4, Vol. 6.\nSubsequently there was much talk with his daughters, and more\nbusiness talk with the son, whom he called Ted as usual, but whom\nhe did not call by a childish nickname which was asked for and\nnot given.\nWaking Stage.\nWhile coming out of trance Mrs. Piper spoke, or rather muttered\nat intervals, as usual ; and her words were taken down, or such of\nthem as could be heard (cf. p. 135). It is worth while to quote one\nrecord of these ejaculations\u2014say this one, since it was a fairly\ntypical case of an unimportant and unevidential but characteristic\ncoming to.\nNotes intruded in square brackets are added merely in order\nto place the reader in the same sort of position as regards under-\nstanding the significance of these sub-conscious utterances as a\nrecorder finds himself in after an experience of many sittings.\nI am aware that such explanations may irritate a certain group of\npeople who have been all their lives familiar with trance speeches\nof one kind or another ; but in the first place I must beg them to\nobserve that when I explain things to members and associates I am\nnot assuming ignorance on the part of specialists. It would be\nimpossible to write in an explanatory fashion on any branch of\neven the most orthodox science if thereby one ran the risk of\noffending specialists. In ordinary subjects it is safe silently to\nassume that experienced people will understand that their know-\nledge is taken for granted. Again, trances are by no means identical.\nEach has distinctive features. Mrs. Piper's trance has itself under-\ngone modification in the course of the nineteen years since I first\nknew her ; and it may be useful to quote the kind of phrases\nemployed by her during recovery\u2014if only as a psychological study.\nThey are seldom or never identical, but they have a strong family\nlikeness. Here then they are on this occasion :\n\" I saw you before. It is fearful. [This means that she\ndislikes changing from her trance state and coming back\nto ordinary surroundings.]\n\f186 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nThey are going away. It's awful. Too bad. Snap. [This\nrefers to a sensation which she calls a snap in the\nhead, which nearly always precedes a return to con-\nsciousness. Sometimes it heralds almost a sudden return ;\nand she is always more conscious after a snap than she\nwas before ; but often it takes two snaps to bring her\ncompletely to. AVhat the snap is I do not know, but I\nexpect it is something physiological. It is not audible\nto others, though Mrs. Piper half seems to expect it to\nbe so.]\nWhat are all the people doing ?\n[Probably some of the sitters were moving about and\nleaving the room, under the mistaken impression that\nthe snap meant that interest was over.]\nI saw a man in the light, which looked like Mr. Thompson.\nKept waving his hand. The man with the cross was\nhelping him out.\n[\"The man with the cross\" is intended to signify Imperator.]\nThe moon was shining [or it may have been the '\nsun.' It\nonly signifies that her recent surroundings have been\nbright and luminous.]\nHas an old lady with him.\n[This no doubt means Isaac Thompson's mother. See Vol. 6,\npages 523-544.]\nShe is helping him read something. I could see his face\nperfectly.\nNoise, [probably something going on outside.] They were\ntalking to me. I came in on a cord, a silver cord.\nThey were trying to tell me something about the\nchildren in the body. Lovely place.\nBuzzing in my head. Another snap.\nMiss Thompson. I thought you were small. Looking\nthrough opera glasses at wrong end. You grew larger.\nDid you hear my head snap ? It breaks.\nI forgot where we were sitting.\nWhy Mrs Thompson, I didn't know you were there. My\ncold.\"\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 187\n[Mrs. Piper was troubled with a cold at this time. Her\nintelligence was now normal.]\nIn further illustration of the waking stage, showing how similar\nit was in 1906 to what it is now, and as a further description of\nthe curious \" snap \" sensation, I subjoin an extract from the\ntermination of a sitting with Henry James, Junior, and Mr. Dorr\nin America in 1906.\nI thought you were a stranger.\nWell, did you hear my head snap ?\nH.J.Je. No.\nDidn't hear it 1 It is a funny sound. Don't you hear it at\nall 1 Sounds like wheels clicking together and then snaps.\nThere it is again.\nG. B. D. Now you are really back.\nThird Sitting of the Thompson Family with Mrs. Piper at\nLiverpool on 12 November, 1906.\nWith regard to sitting No. 3, held on 12 Nov. \u2014at which I was\nnot present, though all the Thompson family were, including the\nmarried daughter Agnes\u2014there is not much in the record to interest\nan outsider. The Hodgson control put in a short appearance, but\nthe Thompson control appeared to be present nearly all the time, and\nsaid many appropriate things, though in my judgment the record\ndoes not show that it was a specially good sitting.\nIt may be sufficient to copy here Edwin Thompson's letter to me\nthe next day.\nLetter from Edwin Thompson about Sitting No. 3.\nTo us the sitting was most satisfactory : the most convincing part\nbeing the last few answers. Mother asked if he recognised the\nroom, and you will see the answer is correct (the hand looked round\nfor some time) : and then when we said Good-bye, he said he never\ndid like Good-bye; which is perfectly true, although at the time,\nwhen we said it, we did not think of it.\nAre the original writings kept ? If not I should be very much\nobliged if I might have the originals of this sitting.\nI cannot remember the stick to which Father refers.\n\f18S Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nDr. Hodgson [i.e. the Hodgson control. 0. J. L.] seemed most\nemphatic in [his part of] the writing. With regard to \"Dinner at\nClub \" [to which he refers] he had been most pressing for me to dine\nwith him there, when I was in America, and had also written and\nasked me to du so. It never came off, however, as I was so pressed\nfor time.\nI will send a full report of the sitting by to-night's post.\nYours sincerely,\n(Signed) Edwin Thompson.\nThe following are the passages in the script referred to in this\nletter [Isaac Thompson supposed to be communicating] :\nDo you remember a stick I gave you one Christmas 1\nAgnes. No I do not, what kind of a stick 1\nI got it in the Canary Islands.\nAgnes. I don't remember the stick, but I remember your going to the\nCanary Islands.\nThat's what he said. R.\nAll right I am glad you remember that.\n[And then later in the sitting]\nMrs. T. Can you remember this room ?\nGive me time and I'll see. (Hand waves about and seems\nto look round everywhere.) Can it be the nursery, Sue\ndear ?\nMrs. T. Yes it's the old nursery, where we have been so often\ntogether.\nI am so glad to know and see you all here.\nE. T. Imperator, Rector, it is time for us to close.\n+ We are about to cease.\nAll tue Family. Good-bye Good-bye.\nDo not say it more [or now], I am with you although I\nspeak not. I never did like Good-bye.\n\flviij.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 189\nMrs. T. May we say au revoir.\nYes au revoir.\nGod bless you and keep you in his holy keeping.\n+ R.\nWe cease now and may the blessing of God rest on you all.\n+ Farewell R.\nSittings at Edgbaston.\nMrs. Piper thereupon came from Liverpool to my house at\nEdgbaston ; where the first sittings were occupied by other matters\n\u2014fragmentary talks with the Myers and Hodgson controls, arrange-\nments about future sittings, and plans for the London visit. For it\nwas as necessary to secure the good-will and consent of the responsible\ncontrols as it was to conciliate Mrs. Piper herself, in making future\narrangements ;\nthey would not see everybody, nor could it be assumed\nthat they would consent to appear unless the}' approved the conditions\nof time and place. (Parenthetically I may here remark that on one\noccasion I had a total failure ; the trance would not come on. See\npage 238.) But they frankly discuss the proposed arrangements and\nare as amenable to suggestions as real people are. They were\nevidently desirous that the conditions should be good, and that no\nundue tax should be put upon the medium. Of course their atti-\ntude in this respect may be taken as a natural self-preservative\nattitude of the subconcious part of Mrs. Piper's intelligence.\nOther friends also appeared, and more than one important stranger\nwas introduced during this short series.\nNot till the fifth Edgbaston sitting (the 8th of this English series)\ndid the Isaac Thompson control again put in an appearance. I do\nnot assert that he actually controlled\u2014probably not\u2014but he sent\nmessages through Rector.\nThe ostensible reason for his coming was because Mrs. Isaac\nThompson had just sent me through the post an object connected\nwith a living brother of his, concerning whose health anxiety was\nfelt. I opened the packet and handed what turned out to be a\nnecktie to Mrs. Piper's hand, after she was entranced, giving her no\nclue whatever. Before long it was said to belong to \" the family\nwith Agnes Teddy . . .\n\"\n; and when I admitted that it had to do\nwith the family of Isaac Thompson, I was told (what I knew) that\nit belonged to one of his living brothers, whose name was correctly\ngiven.\n\f190 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nMedical statements were made, concerning facts not in my know-\nledge, which were said to be correct when reported ; and advice was\ntendered, especially concerning the visits of some specified local\ndoctor. This apparent obtaining of information from an object is\nvery remarkable, though common enough. I have remarked on it\nelsewhere. It seems to strengthen the case for general telepathic\nactivity as opposed to personal identity.\nThen '\nIsaac Thompson ' spoke to me of a few incidents during\ntravels which we had taken together; but those which he best\nrecollected for the most part I did not, or only partially, and vice versa ;\nso that there is nothing much worth recording. Among other things,\nhe tried to remind me of a knife\u2014a paper knife \u2014which he had\ngiven me. I could not remember it ; but it has since turned up\na carved red-wood paper knife which I did not use, and so had\nforgotten. He had brought it, I think, from the Canary Islands\u2014\nvisit to which had been mentioned by the control in an evidential\nmanner. Other things which I had forgotten may be true ;\nbut, save\nin exceptional cases, these reminiscences do not seem of much value.\nAppropriate\u2014though, under the circumstances of previous normal\nknowledge, non-evidential\u2014messages were sent to his family, and\nto his brother; which were duly delivered.\nMrs. Isaac Thompson wrote to me, after receiving a record of the\nstatements made in connexion with the necktie which she had sent\nme, saying that the brother (who had never seen Mrs. Piper) ad-\nmitted the general correctness of the medical diagnosis, that he was\nmuch interested in the message sent to him, and that he was going\nto the Doctor recommended. Also that a \"picnic,\" referred to as\namong the reminiscences of the Isaac Thompson control, suggested\nto her one at Coniston ;\nthough I had failed to remember it.\nIn a still later Edgbaston sitting, in May 1907, after Mrs. Piper's\nreturn from London, Isaac Thompson again sent messages to the\nfamily, with further reminiscences of events in which I was concerned\nbut nothing of special importance.\nLast English sitting with the Thompson family at Liverpool.\nFinally\u2014to finish up the Isaac Thompson series\u2014when at length\nMrs. Piper went back to Liverpool, on her way to America (after\na holiday in Scotland, which she had spent in the neighbourhood\nof the Thompson family who were also in Scotland and with whom\nshe and her daughters were on very friendly terms) they had a\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 191\nfarewell sitting, at which I was not present, from which a few extracts\nmust be made.\nIt must be stated that a brother of Mrs. Thompson, named Charles,\nhad died in the interval, namely on May 22nd ; this final sitting\nbeing held on July 3rd, all in the year 1907.\nThe following is a sufficient extract from the record.\nSitting called No. 17. The Thompson family with Mrs. Piper,\nat Liverpool, on 3 July, 1907. Annotated chiefly by Edwin\nThompson.\n[After Eector's introductory remarks.]\nE. T. Have you anything you wish to communicate to anyone\npresent 1\nYes we have much. We bring a spirit who says he's your\nfather.\nE. T. Is he present now 1\nHe is.\nGood morning my boy, I am glad to see you again ; did\nyou and mother receive my message ? you and mother.\nE. T. Yes, we did.\nI want to tell you that I have a new friend here whom I was\nvery glad to meet. Chas.\nHe says Chas. Chas Chare Charl\nE. T. We do understand, but can you spell that word correctly ?\nI'll ask your father. R\n[Thereby indicating that Rector is really conveying the\nmessages. 0. J. L.]\nYes. Chares Chares\nCharles\n[Charles E. Stevens, brother of Mrs. T. died on 22 May, 1907.]\nsends love to M.\n[Probably Mary his sister.]\n\f192 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nE. T. Is that M ?\nYes.\nI didn't realise I was coming over.\n[He died suddenly from apoplexy.]\nOh dear I am so glad to understand it now.\nIsaac has been so kind, so very kind to me.\nI can't tell you how kind.\n(Then he expresses anxiety about his other surviving sister,\nMary, and begs that she may be looked after. Then\nhe says he has something on his mind.)\nI want you to look up a picture I ordered before I left, and\nit never came.\nE. T. Can you tell us from whom you ordered it?\nThat would be difficult to get through to thee, but I ordered\nit from a friend of mine, who used to take my orders,\nand get them for me.\nTell Mary she dreamed I was there and I was.\nThat picture must be looked up.\nE. T. Can you tell us whether it was a water-colour or an oil ]\nWater, yes.\nMrs. T. Yes, Charlie, the picture did come after you left, and Mary\nsent the bill of it to Mr. Alsop to pay.\n[E. T. did not know anything about this.]\nOh I am so glad to understand.\nMrs. T. That is good, and all done with. Is there any other message\nthou would like to give about anything?\n(Then again he refers to his sister.)\nTake good care of her and do not let her go off alone.\nMrs. T. We will do our best.\nShe will come over to me some time but before she comes I\nwant you all to look after her.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 193\nMrs. T. But you have no reason to think that she will join you\nshortly 1\nI have reason for asking you to take good care of her.\nTed, is this you 1\nE. T. Yes it is, Uncle Charlie.\nI am glad to see you.\n(Then he gives his nephew business advice and again refers\nto family matters, mentioning names quite familiarly\nand correctly, though some of them were also men-\ntioned by the sitters, in a fairly natural conversational\nway on both sides, \u2014though of course all rather of the\nanxious and telephonic order necessitated by the diffi-\nculties incidental to the situation.\nThen 'Charles' disappeared, and his brother-in-law,\n'Isaac Thompson,' once more sent messages and advice\nabout business\u2014showing rather detailed knowledge on\nsome points. Then he addressed Mrs. Thompson\nagain :\n\u2014\nOh dear Sue, did you understand my message 1\nMrs. T. Do you mean the message that came through Sir Oliver 1\nYes I do.\nMrs. T. Yes I did get it. Did you see Charlie when he went over ?\nOh yes, I was by his side and helped him to find his way.\nMrs. T. We were so sorry to part with him.\nYes I was so glad to see him ... he is always near you all.\nMrs. T. And Isaac, we want to send our love to thee and Charlie.\nTheodora is here and Agnes is downstairs.\nTheodora dear are you better. (Theodora had just come into\nthe room.)\nI say you. R. Because I understand it better. Rector. He\nsays Thee, but I say you. I understand it better.\nMrs. T. We understand.\n(Then after long medical advice from \"Doctor \" to Theodora\nAgnes comes in and says)\nN\n\f194 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nA. Here is Agnes.

They\nare reported because of their simple domestic character and the\nappropriate knowledge and anxiety they show ;\nthough few of them\ncan be regarded as technically evidential.\nRemarks on Belies.\nIn this last sitting the unexpected, though rather hoped for,\nappearance of the uncle (brother of Mrs. Isaac Thompson) recently\ndeceased, is rather striking ; and his messages are all quite appro-\npriate. (Of course Mrs. Piper had heard of the death, since she was\nin friendly relation with the Thompson family.) It need not be\nsupposed that he was actually in control : presumably it was\nRector who was reporting in the first person all the time.\nIt will by some people\u2014who might otherwise be in favour of some\nform of spiritistic hypothesis\u2014be thought absurd that reference\nshould be made under such circumstances to trifles like ordered but\nundelivered pictures, and to trivialities like the possession of a hand-\nkerchief or other relic. The usual excuse is that these things are\nmentioned for purposes of identification ; but though there may be\nsome truth in that view, there is, in my judgment, more reason than\nthat for such incidents, and they are not contradictory of the notion\nof survival. The fate of objects once regarded with affection,\nor even interest, and possessing any kind of personal association,\ndoes not seem to have suddenly become a matter of indifference.\nScattered through all the sittings are innumerable instances of this\nsort of curious memory of and interest in trifles ; so that it would\nbe merely tedious to refer to pages where they occur. Every experi-\nenced sitter knows that such references are the commonest of all.\nWhat is the explanation 1 I am not prepared with a full explana-\ntion ;\nbut, granted the most completely spiritistic hypothesis, it\nwould appear that the state after death is not a sudden plunge\ninto a stately, dignified, and specially religious atmosphere. The\nenvironment, like the character, appears to be much more like what\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter III. 197\nit is here than some folk imagine. This may be due to the effort\nand process incidental to the condition of semi-return, under which\nalone communication is possible : it appears to involve something less\nthan full consciousness. But it goes rather further than this, since\na few of the controls, when recently deceased (a pious old lady in\nparticular is in my mind), have said that the surroundings were more\n\"secular\" than they expected; they have indeed expressed themselves\nas if a little disappointed, though they nearly always say that the\nsurroundings are better than they are here. Anyhow, there appears\nto be no violent or sudden change of nature ; and so any one who\nhas cared for trinkets may perhaps after a fashion care for them\nstill.\nBut there must be more than that even. Objects appear to serve\nas attractive influences, or nuclei, from which information may be\nclairvoyantly gained. It appears as if we left traces of ourselves, not\nonly on our bodies, but on many other things with which we have\nbeen subordinately associated, and that these traces can thereafter\nbe detected by a sufficiently sensitive person. This opens a large\nsubject which I have touched upon once or twice already in other\npapers\u2014never with any feeling of certainty or security \u2014and which\nrequires careful handling lest its misunderstanding pave the way for\nmere superstition.\nBut to return to common sense, and without assuming anything\nof this kind, even hypothetically, how do we know that we are right\nin speaking of some things as trifles and other things as important 1\nWhat is our scale or standard of value 1\nNo one expects people to be wholly indifferent as to the posthumous\ndisposal of their property, provided it amounts to several thousand\npounds. They make careful wills, and would, if they knew, be\nperhaps displeased if the provisions were not adhered to, or if\ntheir final will was lost.\nVery well, on what scale shall we estimate property, and how\nshall we measure its value ?\nIt is conceivable that, seen from another side, little personal\nrelics may awaken memories more poignant than those associated with\nbarely recollected stocks and shares.\nThat at any rate is the kind of idea which naturally suggests itself\nin connexion with the subject. Our terrestrial estimate of the\ncomparative importance of things is not likely to be cosmically\nsufficient or perennially true.\nHowever that may be, it is clear that the various Piper controls\n\f198 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\ndo not estimate the importance of property by any standard dependent\non pounds sterling. As a variant on old lockets, old letters, and\nother rubbish, in which Phinuit seemed to take some interest, I once\ngave him a five-pound note. It was amusing to see how at first he\ntried to read it\u2014in his usual way by applying it to the top of the\nmedium's head ;\n\u2014and then on realising the sort of thing it was, how\nhe crumpled it up and flung it into a corner with a grunt, holding\nout his hand for something of interest. Needless to say, I did not\nshare in this estimate of value, and, after the sitting, was careful to\nrescue the despised piece of paper from its perilous position.\nEnd of comment upon the Isaac Thompson Series.\nCHAPTER IV.\nMESSAGES RECEIVED THROUGH MRS. THOMPSON.\nThe 'Myers' Controls.\nNow let us enter upon the episodes where F. W. H. Myers was\nsupposed to be controlling, or at least communicating, while I was\npresent. I shall begin, however, with communications received not\nthrough Mrs. Piper, but through other mediums. Most of the Piper-\nMyers messages were obtained, and must be dealt with, by Mr.\nPiddington ; because they often involve cross-correspondences, which\nbelong to his department of the work. Moreover, in the recent series\nof sittings I had but few conversations with the Myers control as\nmodified or represented by Mrs. Piper\u2014what we call the \" Piper-\nMyers \" or Myersp. I fear I did not give him many chances, and one\nday was rather rebuked by Rector for not affording the MyersP control\nmore opportunity for utterance. This was because I usually had some-\nthing else ready that I wanted to try. So neither from MyersP nor\nfrom HodgsonP did I get very much in these recent sittings.\nAnd of course in the old days, 1889-90, both had been in full\nvigour of life.\nBut it so happens that long before Mrs. Piper arrived, and very\nsoon after Mr. Myers's death, I had had a couple of unexpected\nand exceptional sittings with the well-known Mrs. Thompson, at\nthat time still living at Hampstead. She had suspended sitting\naltogether; but she kindly allowed myself and my wife to sit twice\nwith her, \u2014she said she felt impelled to do so, \u2014on two occasions\nwhen she happened to be visiting friends in or near Birmingham.\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV. 199\nAccordingly the first, and certainly the most striking, of the com-\nmunications that I have to report are not from the Piper-Myers, but\nfrom the Thompson-Myers or Myersx.\nThere was a certain amount that was dramatic in these sittings\nand a little substantial information concerning unknown facts which\nI subsequently verified, together with a few which are not yet\nverified and therefore perhaps erroneous.\nSittings with Mrs. Thompson.\nSittings with Mrs. Thompson are first reported on by several\nmembers of the Society in Vol. 17; where there is first an\nintroduction by myself, with a posthumously published paper by\nMyers (giving a history of this case on p. 69) ; then papers by Dr.\nvan Eeden, Mr. Piddington, Dr. Hodgson, Miss Johnson, and a long\n.and important discussion with details by Mrs. Verrall.\nA fairly full account of Mrs. Thompson's sittings and controls is\ngiven by Mr. Piddington in Vol. 18, Proc. S.P.R. His remarks on\nthe trance are on pp. 106-7; also on pages 147 and 157. Those\nwho have read his report will know that her chief control repre-\nsents itself as her deceased daughter Nelly, and that it talks in\nsemi-baby language, and with the kind of intelligence appropriate\nto a clever child. Instances of '\nNelly's ' occasional modes of speech\nare quoted on page 158, and again on p. 162, with further instructive\ndetails on and about p. 209 and p. 221, Vol. 18.\nOther controls are described on pp. 126-135. Some inter-relation\nbetween '\nNelly ' and Miss Eawson are referred to about p. 207, and\na Gurney control on p. 301.\nMrs. Thompson was so well acquainted with Mr. Myers and his\nfamily that no evidential importance can be attached to remarks and\nmessages concerning that family, obtained through her mediumship,\nhowever natural they may be. These are therefore all omitted.\nReference to trivial facts and domestic affairs are good as evidence\nonly in the case of unknown strangers : in other cases they are\nonly of use as contributing to the dramatic character and personal\nexpression of the whole. From this point of view I regret some\nomissions, which nevertheless have been considered necessary.\nA further statement can be made. It may be recollected that\nDr. Hodgson experienced only poor sittings during his few oppor-\ntunities of meeting Mrs. Thompson, that he accordingly formed an\nunfavourable estimate of her powers, and published his views in\n\f200 Sir Oliver Lodge, [part\nProc. S.P.R., Vol. 17, p. 138. But, speaking for myself, I form\nmy own opinions on the subject, and do not agree with his\ncriticisms ;\nthough doubtless the reader may be influenced thereby.\nI now return to the description.\nMrs. Thompson's trance is an easy trance, not so complete or\nstriking as Mrs. Piper's, but it is a state of suspension, or partial\nsuspension, of ordinary consciousness, and is accompanied by a change\nof voice and manner.\nIn the sitting which follows, '\nMyers ' was represented as controlling\nand speaking for part of the time, but the sittings began with the\n\" Nelly \" control, and when the Myers control is not manifestly\nintended to be speaking, the words may be taken as emanating\neither from Nelly or from one or other of Mrs. Thompson's ordinary\ncontrols\u2014it does not matter which, since I am not studying Mrs.\nThompson's phenomena, but am giving what appear to be messages\nfrom or about Myers, who died on 17 January, 1901.\nThe first sitting was on Thursday, 19 Feb. 1901, that is to say\njust about a month after his decease. Present, only myself and wife\nwith Mrs. Thompson. At 6 o'clock the control Nelly began talking\nabout Myers, about whose death she had been for some time\nincredulous. Indeed she had declared that she could not find him\nanywhere and did not believe that he had come over. See J. G. P.'s\npaper, Vol. 18, p. 240, also 238. But now she was just beginning\nto admit the fact.\nTuesday, 19 February, 1901. Sitting with Mrs. Thompson at\n225 Hagley Road, Birmingham. Notes by 0. J. L. and M. L..\n6.0 p.m. I was allowed to go on his birthday to see him. They\nwill have plenty of work to do, for he has promised\nto send messages to 74 people.\nAll the people said he was dead, but I did not believe\nit ; and though I saw him, I thought he only came\nover for his birthday like in a vision. But I see him\nnow. It is the truth, it is the truth (excitedly). Let\nus see if he can talk sense. He was talking on the\nplatform with you. It was at a station by a race-course.\n[I had met him at Liverpool ; seen him off from the\nlanding stage to America. But this is unimportant.]\nHe will come when he is more wakened up\u2014before\n9 o'clock. You be ready at 25 minutes to 9. He will\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV. 201\nbe awake by then. He would rather think and realise\nfor a little space by himself.\nHe is sensible, for a spirit.\nBefore you came, mother was praying. She said \"Come\nand tell the truth for truth's sake.\"\n(At 6.30 Mrs. Thompson came to.)\nThen we had dinner, and at 8.30 the Control Nelly appeared\nagain, saying\nWhat is the matter with the little girl's throat 1 her ear\nseems to have made her throat ache. One of yours\u2014\ntwinkle one.\n[This is of course a mere friendly interlude. One of my\ntwin daughters was often troubled with ear-ache about\nthis time.]\n(Here there was an incipient attempt at a Myers control,\nand an incident at a Club was referred to. Then\nanother control said)\nDo you know he feels like the note-taker, not like the spirit\nthat has to speak. I think he will speak presently.\n(A short interval of apparent discomfort, and then '\nMyers\n'\npurported to communicate)\nLodge, it is not as easy as I thought in my impatience.\nGurney says I am getting on first rate. But I am\nshort of breath.\nOh, Lodge, it is like looking at a misty picture. I can\ndistinctly feel I ought to be taking a note of it. I do\nnot feel as if I were speaking, but it is best to record\nit all.\nTell them I am more stupid than some of those I had to\ndeal with. Oh, Lodge, what is it when I see you ?\nWas it the Albemarle Club we went to when I talked\nabout oh, it leaves off.\nSidgwick knows I am with him. He said that he saw me\nin the morning of Oh, dear, it always leaves off\nin the interesting places.\nI can hear myself using Rosa Thompson's voice.\n\f202 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nI want to convince Sidgwick. He says \" Myers, now we\nare together, you convince me that I am sending my\nmessages, and that she is not getting them from us some\nway.\" He still wants me to show him. He says he saw\nme in the morning of the day he went to Trevelyan.\nHe met Trevelyan, and he saw me first. I am trying\nto show him the way. It is funny to feel myself talking\nwhen it is not myself talking. It is no*- my whole self\ntalking. When I am awake I know where I am. Do\nyou remember the day I was with you here % When\nI went home that day I was ill. I had such a bad\nnight. It is in my diary. It was in May, I think. I\nAvas very ill. [This about Trevelyan seems to refer to\nan incident dealt with by Mr. Piddington. See Proc.\nVol. 18, pp. 239, 241.]\n[The description of the feeling of the control while engaged\nin communication agrees closely with that of Dr.\nHodgson based upon his experience of Mrs. Piper.\nSee for instance Vol. 13, pages 366, 380, 404, 405.\nAnd the forgetfultiess immediately following may be\ncompared with Rector's statement, p. 148 above.]\n0. J. L. Do you want to say anything about the Society 1\nWhat Society?\nO. J. L. You remember the S.P.R.\nDo not think that I have forgotten. But I have. I have\nforgotten just now. Let me think. You know, Lodge,\nwhen you have wanted a thing thirty or forty years,\nand at last got it, you do not think of much else beside.\nLet me think, and bit by bit give it you. I used to get\nbetter evidence when I let them say what they wanted\nto say.\nThey tell me it was my best love that Society. They will\nhelp me.\nWhat did Battersea say about itl\nO. J. L. I do not know.\nI am going to talk to you clearly and very distinctly in\nApril. I do not know my Mother's name now\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV. 203\nWhat James gave me to make me sleep did not do me any\ngood.\nThere is plenty of good matter in those papers that I left,\n.... if it is gone through. You remember the dis-\ncussion there was over Hyslop's paper and its length ?\nIf it is put in too much detail, there is too much of\nit; and yet if you put it fully it is there for those\nwho want it full ; and you can pick out the points\ntoo\nI was confused when I came here. I groped my way as if\nthrough passages, before I knew I was dead. I thought\nI had lost my way in a strange town, and I groped\nmy way along the passage. And even when I saw\npeople that I knew were dead, I thought they were\nonly visions.\nI have not seen Tennyson yet by the way.\nI am going to be bold and prophesy already. I am going\nto see you in April. I am going to know who I am\nby then.\n0. J. L. And will you then read what you wrote in the envelope 1\nWhat envelope 1 \u2014I shall be told.\nErnest does not mind now. What do they mix me up with\nhim for? (Jocularly.) Do they think I want to shine\nin his glory ?\n[This was evidently a reference to the \" Times \" obituary\nnotice, which I had written, but to which some one in\nthe \" Times \" office appended a supplementary state-\nment that F. W. H. M. had been a joint translator of\nHomer together with Walter Leaf and Andrew Lang\nwhereas it is public and general knowledge that this\nwas only true of his brother Ernest.]\nI wanted you to do for me what I did for Sidgwick. [i.e.\nwrite a notice in the Society's Proceedings.]\n0. J. L. I am going to ; and so are Eichet and James.\nAh, Richet : Yes, Eichet knows me ; and James will do it\nwell.\n\f204 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART?\nI never finished those letters I was writing\u2014letters to be\npublished.\n[Probably meaning the book \" Human Personality.\"]\n[Then the control seemed to change, and it went on] :\nHe says he must stay and try and help. He says, Bless him\nwhen he has so much to do. He says \" Brothers I have\nnone excepting Lodge.\" He wants Lodge to be President\nif he dare spare the work ; but he says \" Do not rope\nyourself, but keep the group, keep the group together.\nIt will soon take care of itself.\"\n0. J. L. We are trying to get Rayleigh.\nThat will be splendid, but that is too good to hope for. I\nthink it will be you. Thank you for being helpful to\nhim. You have helped him. Man's sympathy is more\nhelpful than anything else, and with sympathy every-\nthing slips into place. Among the things which are not\nevidential you get things which are. They must take\nit all. Those that seek only the evidential things will\nnot get them.\nThere are so many he would like to help. He promised, and\nhe will have to.\nWhen he comes in April he will remember a great deal more.\nHe will remember what he wrote for you in the envelope.\n(Trance ends about 10.30 p.m.)\nThe impersonation at this sitting was really a remarkably vivid\nand lifelike one. It occurred only a month after the death of\nF. W. H. Myers, and the state of confusion in which the Myers\ncontrol found itself seemed very natural. Indeed, it would be\ndifficult for me to invent an experience or a communication more\nreasonable and natural under the supposed circumstances than what\nwe actually got. The necessity for still \"convincing Sidgvvick\nstruck us as amusingly characteristic ; so did several other little\ntraits, such as that Myers \" felt as if he ought to be taking notes \"\na point on which F. W. H. M. was always specially insistent. And\nas to his temporary forgetfulness of the existence of the S.P.R.,.\nthough it will probably be pounced upon as an absurdity by scoffers,,\nand though it was of course quite unexpected, yet even that struck.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV.\nus at the time as humanly natural and interesting. And indeed so\nit does now. (Compare Rector's statement on p. 148.) With the\nportions omitted and everything taken into account, this sitting seems\nto me about the best of the Myers sittings in which I have been\nimmediately concerned. \"Without being strictly evidential, it was in\nfact as convincing as anything that could be imagined of that kind.\nThis was in February, 1901. A further communication was pro-\nmised for April, but no opportunity for another sitting came until\nMay 8th, and then it came quite unexpectedly and without being\narranged for. In fact at that time it was unlikely that any sitting\nwould occur, since we had all been definitely told that they were\nsuspended, or rather that they were intended henceforth to cease.\nSecond Thompson Sitting at Edgbaston.\nOn May 8th, 1901, Mrs. Thompson happened to come to Birmingham\nagain to see her connexions there ; and she incidentally visited us\nat our temporary house in the Hagley Road.\nI made the following contemporary notes, and it seems to me\nworth while to reproduce them as a representation of the circum-\nstances of the case at this time.\nFrom 0. J. L's Note-booh, 9 May, 1901.\nAfter dinner Mrs. Thompson spontaneously asked Mrs. Lodge to\ntake her up into my study, saying as she went upstairs that she\nfelt only half conscious, and as if she were going off.\nUpstairs we three alone sat and talked for some time.\nAt last \" Nelly \" appeared and notes began : Mrs. Lodge taking\nthem as well as myself. Mrs. Lodge spoke no word during the\ntrance from first to last.\nThe sitting was dim and unsatisfactory and in most respects\napparently at the time a failure. It lasted about an hour and a\nhalf, one continuous trance, and at the end Mrs. Thompson was\nmuch agitated j not exhausted, but weepy ;\nsaying how much she\ndisliked the idea of coming back to consciousness and leaving the\nconditions in which she had just been. She said she had no re-\ncollection of what had been said ; and this appeared to be the case.\nShe also told me, before the sitting began, that of late she had\nbeen quite unconscious of any communications, that is to say, she\ncould not remember their contents, but that she was under the\n\f206 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nimpression that during the last month or so she had had three or\nfour trances when no one was there, at different times, and that\nonce she found herself waking on the floor with a feeling of great\nsatisfaction and contentment.\nShe further said that the sudden cutting off of all attempts at\ncommunication had been a great blow to her and seemed to upset\nher physically to some extent. Also that she had been promised\nsomething for her birthday, April 22nd,\u2014evidently connecting it\nwith me. 'Nelly' had indeed promised me a sitting in April,\n[as recorded in last sitting] though not for any particular date.\nBut it seems she had expected it on the 22nd. However I had\nno sitting in April\u2014nothing till this May 8th.\nThe difficulties of clear utterance at times rendered it necessary\nfor me to help the ideas out, or anticipate them as far as I could.\nMy notes aim at recording the sense of what was intended, and can\nonly be of interest to those who understand.\nAdditional Note written on 11 May, 1901.\nThe above was dictated before copying the notes, and gives my\ncontemporary impression of the sitting ; but on reading over the\nnotes I find them better than I expected ; and now think that\nthough at the time it seemed a bad sitting to everybody concerned,\nit is not really bad ;\nthough the utterances were so feeble and\nconfused that to a novice it would have been nearly all gibberish.\nA little gibberish remains undeciphered in places ; but is recorded\nin case any meaning can be attached to it. I do not think it is\ngibberish really, \u2014only as heard and taken down. It probably had\nsense if it could have been heard and understood, though most\nlikely not at all important sense.\nSecond Sitting with Mrs. Thompson at 225 Hagley Road,\nBirmingham, 8 May, 1901, from 9.0 till 10.30 p.m.\nPresent\u2014O. J. L. and M. L., both taking notes.\n(Nelly speaking.)\nProfessor Lodge, what is that umbrella they have put up\nand made it all dark ? I wish they would take it away.\n(Further indications followed that she had tried to com-\nmunicate but found it dark.)\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV. 207\n[This evidently refers to the suspension of sittings ; Mrs.\nThompson, for some private reason, having declined to\nsit for the last few months, and only doing it now\nas a special favour, and because she felt internally urged\nto do so.]\nI have not seen Mr. Myers, not once ; I have not seen him\nsince they put that umbrella up.\nNelly then appealed to me to try and believe her and receive\nher statements sympathetically and not with an undercurrent of\nsuspicion, explaining that such undercurrent befogged her, and that\nshe could give me better things if I was sympathetic. I asked her\nnot to regard me as in any way hostile, and she said \"No, I do\nnot feel like that to any of the Marshall family.\" This remark was\nnot amplified, nor did it seem understood by Nelly herself.\nIt is perhaps worth noting incidentally that my grandmother and\nmy wife's father were both Marshalls, though no relation whatever\nto each other, nor to Frederic Myers's relations of that name.\nNelly then sent a few messages to Mr. Piddington, and incidentally\nremarked that she felt as if in a pound in the middle of a field,\nand as if she could not see clearly the people on the other side of\nthe enclosure, and that communication was very difficult and not\nclear to-day.\nThen followed some convulsive movements and a sort of internal\ncolloquy of which only fragments were audible. They appeared\nhowever to indicate a confused conversation between Nelly and Mr.\nMyers, Nelly asking him to come in, and Mr. Myers saying that\nhe had been told not, \u2014that he had understood the communications\nwere suspended for a time.\nBut this was only an impression gathered from the confused\nmutterings. A further impression was that Mr. Myers mistrusted\nthe presence of a third person and was being reassured by Nelly\nthat it was only Mrs. Lodge.\nIt's only Mrs. Lodge whom you love.\nNo I don't love her.\nIt's only Lodge's wife, who will help.\nMore than I anticipated much more.\nWith other barely intelligible fragments of internal colloquy.\n\f208 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nUltimately the conversation with me began again but in a very-\nhalting and indistinct fashion, no marked personality at all, some-\nwhat as if Nelly were half giving messages and half personating\nMr. Myers, and doing both badly and with difficulty.\nThe following however are my notes of what was said :\u2014\nMr. Myers is worrying about something connected with Mr.\nSidgwick, something that was not understood or that\nwas not put down. He [H. S.] had some Jews in College\nand he could not do it on a Saturday.\nTell Feilding that he is doing something that is waste of\ntime. The Times said something about it and said it\nwas valuable.\n[But I understood the communicator to mean that it was\nnot. I do not know what Avork is being referred\nto.]\nThe first shock to my dearest hopes.\nSo stupid not to tell them what I wished.\nThe time was gradually passing.\nYou know Sidgwick and I had many disappointments like\nthis [when communications would not come clear?]\nI thought I should do better, but I cannot, [cf. p. 227.]\nWe had many, a year, a hundred, at Newcastle.

He has got an impression that Mr. Myers\nhelped him to call me. Mr. Myers said \"Let us go\nand see '\nold Whiskers ' in his little bed and laugh at\nhim.\" He is much more lively when he is talking to\nme, and much more wakened up than when he is talk-\ning down that stick. [Cf. Proc. S.P.E. Vol. 18, p. 201.]\nBut he does seem worried, he gets no rest. Some one has\ncalled him in a glass bottle\u2014yes, a crystal.\nOh yes, and he said it was not he that wrote when Miss\nKawson wrote and said he told her. But it was not\nhe that was writing. You know when ; Miss Rawson\nwrote two very full sheets in the middle of a Gurney\nletter. [Perhaps referring to the incident recorded on\np. 224.] He said it was not he, but neither was it fraud.\nHe does not want you to stop the phenomenon. He\nwants to study it. You are not to say that it was\nwrong and get it stopped. He likes to watch the\nsomnambulistic thing at work. It is not he that is\ndoing it, and yet he is looking on.\nHe does not see how it is worked, but he finds this more\ninteresting than the genuine communications.\nHe did not rattle the curtains either.

It is not cheating, and yet it is\nnot him doine; it. . . . There was no stick that went\nthrough any one's body there.\nHe says that others tell him it was just the same with\nthem. Sometimes when he thought they were com-\nmunicating they were not, and yet they knew about it.\n\" He says he is finding out how honest non-phenomena are\nto be accounted for.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV. 213\nApparently dishonest phenomena are phenomena of extreme\n[interest ?] apart from the spirit which purports to be\ncommunicating.\"\n[This last part was slowly recited by Nellie, like a lesson\nnot understood by her.]\nI can't help what he says.\nI must go now.\n(End of sitting 10.30 p.m.)\nNotes on this Sitting.\nSome of the remarks reported above seem to indicate a connexion\nwith statements made in Mrs. Verrall's automatic writing of the same\nperiod, about which Mrs. Thompson knew nothing. Thus there\nappears a certain similarity between the remark \" Mr. Myers is\nworrying about something connected with Mrs. S.\" and the attempts\nmisunderstood at the time\u2014in Mrs. Verrall's script between April 19\nand May 8, as related in Proceedings Vol. 20, pp. 195-198, to\ndescribe where Mrs. Sidgwick was to look for something of the\nnature of a book. Again \" I tried on the Sunday with\u2014I saw\nthe receptacle but not this one \" may perhaps be connected with\nthe sudden impulse on Sunday, March 17th {Proceedings, Vol. 20,\np. 221), which induced Mrs. Verrall to write automatically and\nwhich produced the first reference to Mrs. Forbes in what eventually\nbecame a long series of cross-correspondences between those two\nautomatists.\nFinally, there seems a close correspondence between the above\nremarks as to difficulties produced by simultaneous efforts at com-\nmunication and similar observations in Mrs. Verrall's script of the\nsame day and approximately the same hour (Proceedings, Vol. 20,\npp. 207-209). Thus in Mrs. Thompson's sitting the Myers control\nspeaks of \" the noise of you all calling makes me feel I cannot.\nSomeone is calling me now\"; he also says \"false things may creep\nin\"; and the Nelly control describes how, just before, \"someone came\nup and touched\" the stick through which communication was being\nmade, \"and it all got confused.\" While Mrs. Verrall's automatic\nscript of Monday, May 8th, 10-10.30 p.m., concludes as from the\nMyers control with the words: \"falsehood is never far away, What\ndo you want with me. I cannot No power, doing\nsomething else to-night. Note hour.\" The initial '\nH ' with which\nthe message is there signed was a substitution for the real initial,\n\f214 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nbecause that purported to represent F.W.H.M.; and in those early-\ndays of Mrs. Verrall's writing it was thought safer to treat this as\nmere impersonation.\nThe correspondence can be shown by a statement in parallel\ncolumns, as follows :\nMay 8, 1901.\nMrs. Thompson Mrs. Verrall\nBirmingham Cambridge\n9-10.30 p.m. 10-10.30 p.m.\n1. \"I cannot.\" 1. \" Non possum (I cannot).\"\n\"No power.\"\n2. \" Some one is calling me now.\" 2. \" Doing something else to-night.\"\n3. \"Let me be at rest.\" 3. \"Desine (leave off).\"\n4. \"False things may creep in.\" 4. \"Falsehood is never far away.\"\nThe utterances of Mrs. Thompson were not known to Mrs. Verrall\nwhen she wrote the script reported in her paper, Proc, Vol. 20 ; but\nthe correspondence is mentioned there on pages 207 et seq.\nFurther Notes on the Thompson Myers Sittings.\nThe rather strikingly worded complaints and requests recorded\nabove (p. 210), as received through Mrs. Thompson,\n\" They keep on calling me. I am wanted everywhere ....\nDo appeal to them not to break me up so ... .\nHow easy to promise and how difficult to fulfil. Make one\nappeal to them to let me be at rest for two or three\nweeks.\"\nalso correspond with something to the same effect independently\nreceived through Miss Rawson three months earlier ; and constitute\nwhat may be fairly considered another cross-correspondence. This\nmessage, received on Feb. 7th, 1901, purported to come from\nEdmund Gurney, who was represented as speaking through Miss\nRawson as follows, (see for fuller report below, pp. 223-5).\n\" I have come to warn you for my friend to implore you\nnot to let them call him. He gets no rest day or night.\nAt every sitting '\nCall Myers ! Bring Myers '\n; there's\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV. 215\nnot a place in England where they don't ask for him\nit disturbs him, it takes away his rest. For God's sake\ndon't call him. It is all right for him to come of his\nown accord. . . . What Ave want for him now is to\nrise, and to forget the earthly things.\nHe can't help any more. His life was given to it, and that\nmust be the help. He was allowed just to say that he\ncontinued. That was his great desire, but it will help\nnobody that he should be called back, and made to hover\nnear the earth. In fact it will only make him earth-\nbound.\nI am tempted to quote here, from page 213 of Proc, Vol. 21, a\ndifferent though not altogether dissimilar extract from the script\nof Mrs. Holland in India which was written on January 5th and\n\u20226th, 1904, by the MyersH control:\n\" Oh if I could only get to them\u2014could only leave you the\nproof positive that I remember\u2014recall \u2014know\u2014continue\nI have thought of a simile which may help you\nto realise the '\nbound to earth condition ' which persists\nwith me. It is a matter very largely of voluntary choice\n\u2014I am, as it were, actuated by the missionary spirit\nand the great longing to speak to the souls in prison\nstill in the prison of the flesh\u2014leads me to '\nabsent me\nfrom felicity awhile.'\n\"\nThis clearly expresses the idea of service to which I refer later,\n-and it is a reverberation and later expansion of the thought expressed\nin the extracts already quoted, which had not been published and\nwere not known to Mrs. Holland. But the long post-dating of this\nlast communication destroys any claim to consideration as a cross-\ncorrespondence. Besides it was only an explanation of why the\nmessages still willingly continued ; whereas the other two\u2014so soon\nafter the death\u2014are full of earnestness and anxiety.\nGeneral Remarks, addressed to religious objectors.\nGood and earnest though moderately intelligent religious people\nsometimes seek to pour scorn upon the reality of any of these\napparent communications\u2014not for any scientific reason, but for\nreasons born of prejudice. They think that it is not a worthy\noccupation for \"just men made perfect\" \"who have entered into\nfelicity \" to be remembering trivial and minute details, under\n\f216 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\ncircumstances of exceptional difficulty, for the purpose of proving\nto those left behind the fact of survival and the continuance of\npersonal identity. It is taken for granted that saints ought to be\notherwise occupied in their new and lofty and favoured conditions.\nWhat may or may not be possible to saints, it is hardly for me\nor other gropers among mere terrestrial facts to surmise: nor am I\nanxious to imagine that all our communicators belong to the cate-\ngory of '\nperfected and glorified saints,'\u2014it seems to me, I confess,\nsingularly unlikely ; nor is it necessary to suppose that such exercises\nas we report\u2014even if they are fully and entirely what they pretend\nto be\u2014constitute any large proportion of the activity of the people\nwho are professedly concerned in their production\u2014people who are\nconfessedly far from perfection and who have still much to learn.\nAnd as regard dignity and appropriateness, does it not sometimes\nhappen that an Archbishop or a Savant is found willing to play a\nfrivolous childish game, and otherwise to disport himself, in spite\nof his being on the brink of eternity in a world of sorrow and\nsin 1\nBut seriously, is it not legitimate to ask these good people\nwhether, if an opportunity of service to brethren arises, an effort\nto seize it may not be made even by a saint ? Whether this notion\nof perennial service is not in accordance with their own doctrines\nand beliefs 1 and whether they are not impressed by that clause\nin the creed of most Christians which roundly asserts that their\nMaster descended into Hades 1 for purposes which in another\nplace are suggested. Whereby they may learn that, even after\nsuch a Life and Death as that, Felicity was not entered into\nsave after an era of further personal service of an efficient kind.\nThose who interpret the parables in such a way as to imagine\nthat dignified idleness is the occupation of eternity \u2014that there\nwill be nothing to do hereafter but idly to enjoy the beatific con-\ntemplation and other rewards appropriate to a well-spent life or to\nwell-held creeds, \u2014free from remorse of every kind, and without any\ncall for future work and self-sacrifice, \u2014such people will probably\nsome day find themselves mistaken, and will realise that as yet\nthey have formed a very inadequate conception of what is meant\nby that pregnant phrase \" the Joy of the Lord.\"\nRemarks concerning the nature of the record.\nFor the purpose of making the record, which was written out\nvery soon after the sitting, notes were taken continuously both by\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV. 217\nmy wife and by myself. The record is built out of both these,\neked out by memory, and is substantially true, though I \\>y no\nmeans guarantee verbal accuracy everywhere.\nWhen anything depends on verbal accuracy, as it does in some\ncases of cross-correspondence, the writing sittings are far better\nthan oral ones, and the original script must always be referred to\nfor doubtful or specially interesting points.\nMy record aims at giving a true representation, and at conveying\nto the reader, as far as possible, an impression of the circumstances,\nthe substance, and the manner of the communications,\u2014an impression\nwhich shall be fairly correct even though not lifelike and vivid.\nI have not the slightest interest in attempting to coerce belief\nof any kind. The facts will make different kinds of appeal to\ndifferent people, and to some they will not appeal at all. These\nwill regard the whole business with contempt and pity. They are\nwithin their rights in doing so if they have conscientiously read\nthis and the other records. As a rule however that is where they\nare apt to fail ; and when a person's knowledge of a subject is\nminute, we may be pardoned for holding his opinion concerning it\nin light esteem.\nThose who think that there is anything sensational or specially\nemotional in this sort of conversation are mistaken. The conversa-\ntion is conducted on the same lines as a telephonic conver-\nsation : it is liable to the same sort of annoying interruptions, and\nlikewise to the same occasional surprising gleams of vividness,\na happy turn of phrase, for instance, a tone of the voice, and other\nunmistakable and unexpected revelation of identity\u2014forged or real\nsuch as may be conveyed by an appropriate nickname or by some\ntrivial reminiscence. When this happens, and when relatives are\npresent, their emotions are certainly perturbed.\nThese remarks are general, and are applicable to this whole group\nreported on by me : they are not limited in their application to\nany one particular series.\nSpecific Comments by 0. J. L.\nTo me the most interesting of the whole are the concluding\nobservations, part of which were carefully and laboriously reported\nby the \"Nelly\" control, \u2014the words sounding odd in a childish\nvoice.\nWhatever their origin, they do, in my judgment, represent the truth\nabout a good many of these phenomena\u2014that is to say, that they\n\f218 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nare not precisely what their surface-aspect implies, yet neither are\nthey fraud. They are attempts at doing something rather beyond\nthe power of the operators, \u2014who arrive approximately at their\naim without achieving what they want exactly. They are trying to\nget something definite through, let us say, and something like it comes.\nOccasionally they hardly know how it comes, it is a puzzle to them\nas to us, and often they don't know what it is that we have got ; but\nsometimes they too seem to be spectators, aware of the result, and\nto be worried by the misconception and misunderstanding which they\nsee will arise, but which they are powerless to prevent, \u2014except, as\nhere, by trying to instruct us and awaken our intelligences into a\ncondition in which we too can understand and grapple with the\nunavoidable difficulties of the situation.\n\"I can only think the things\": seems to me likely to be an\naccurate description of the method. It is a telepathic method, and\nthe reproduction by voice or pen is a supplementary and only\nbarely controllable process. And, as reported above, the process of\ncommunication is instructively described as from that side thus : \u2014\n\" I could not say it, but they were translating like a school-\nboy does his first lines of Virgil\u2014so terribly confused\nand inaccurate. But somehow I could not help it. It\nwas not me communicating, yet I saw it going on. . . .\nI can only think the things, and false things may creep\nin without my knowing it.\"\n\" He said it was not he, but neither was it fraud. He does not\nwant you to stop the phenomenon, he wants to study it.\nYou are not to say it was wrong and get it stopped. He\nlikes to watch the somnambulistic thing at work. It is not\nhe that is doing it, and yet he is looking on. He does\nnot see how it is worked, but he finds this more interesting\nthan the genuine communications. He did not rattle the\ncurtains either . . . but it was not cheating, and he does\nnot want you to make them think that they are cheats.\nHe does not know how it is worked, but he is studying\nand he thinks it will help a great deal if he can understand\nhow the cheating things that are not cheats are done.\n[And then came the laborious sentences]\nHe says he is finding out how honest non-phenomena are to\nbe accounted for. Apparently dishonest phenomena are\n\flviit.] On Trance Communications, Chapter IV. 219\nphenomena of extreme [interest] apart from the spirit\nwhich purports to be communicating.\nIt was characteristic also of Myers to feel as if he were the note-\ntaker, not the communicator, and that he ought to be putting it all\ndown (p. 201). Another amusing episode was the persistence of\nProf. Sidgwick's incredulity (p. 202), so that he was represented\nas asking to be convinced that he was himself communicating, and\nthat the medium was not \" getting it out of him somehow.\"\nThe coincidence in time between the termination of this sitting\nat Birmingham and some writing obtained by Mrs. Verrall at\nCambridge, as exhibited in the analytical statement above, on\npage 214, is very remarkable and worth careful notice\u2014especially\nwhen the unexpected character of the Thompson sitting is taken\ninto account. It really makes an effective cross-correspondence.\nThese observations terminate this account of communications\nreceived through the mediumship of Mrs. Thompson.\nAn immense mass has been obtained through her in the past\n(see Reports in Vols. 17 and 18), but so far as I know these are\nthe last two sittings or among the last sittings which she has given.\nWe owe her thanks for the time and opportunity which she has freely\naccorded to members of the Society for scientific purposes.\nI now pass to messages received through a lady known to leading\nmembers of the Society, but who desires to remain anonymous.\nCHAPTER V.\nMessages Obtained Through Miss Rawson.\nIt is perhaps doubtful whether the following series of messages,\nwith the reception of which I was in no way concerned, ought to\nbe included in this paper or reported at all. Doubtless a great\nnumber of communications ostensibly purporting to come from Mr.\nMyers have been received through many mediums, and some of\nthem I have seen. For the most part I regard these as valueless,\n\u2014as not even plausibly lifelike representations of the person sup-\nposed to be communicating. But on the spiritistic hypothesis it\nmust be admitted as likely that Miss Rawson\u2014a lady well known\nto Mr. Myers, whose hand sometimes writes while she remains\nconscious\u2014would be one of the channels of communication employed\nby a posthumous Myers-like activity ; and accordingly when com-\n\f220 Sir Oliver Lodge, [part\nmunications coming through this channel are specially sent to me,\nI do not feel at liberty to suppress them. They do not in fact\nfall into the category of things which we may safely ignore : they\nmust be regarded as part of the psychological evidence ; and in so\nfar as they differ in tone with what is received through the two\nentranced mediums with whom I have been myself chiefly concerned,\nwe can, as before, discriminate and attribute them to what we may\ncall a MyersR.\nUntil there is evidence to the contrary we are bound to assume\nthat writings done by people who are not in any kind of trance\ncan hardly fail to be greatly influenced by their own normal con-\nsciousness, as well as largely controlled by their normal sub-conscious-\nness. It may be instructive therefore to interpose among the trance\ncommunications a specimen of this other kind of perfectly honest\nand sincere record.\nThe following is an extract which I have been kindly allowed to\nmake from one of the note-book records kept of Miss Rawson's trance\nspeech and script. I received and had it copied out of the book\nin March, 1901.\nFor a brief account of the lady called Miss Rawson, see Mr.\nPiddington's paper in Vol. 18, p. 294.\nExtracts from Note-book of Miss Rawson's trance utterances, as\nrecorded by the Experimenter in charge (who is anonymous but\nknown to me).\nThe extracts which follow are entirely of the unevidential order\nbut since the book is an honest record of what purported to be a\nseries of communications, I think it wise to publish some, since it\nforms part of my scheme to illustrate the general character of the\ncommunications, in so far as it can be done in moderate compass.\nThe hypothesis that all this matter is a product of the subliminal\nactivity of the medium is a feasible one ; no one hypothesis fits all the\nfacts. But, of course, if Miss Rawson had never given evidential\nmatter on other occasions, and in respect of other persons and events,\nher script and utterances would be totally disregarded.\nDec. 22, 1900. Message from H. S., with F. W. H. M. himself\npresent, (unimportant).\nJan. 11, 1901. Message from H. S.

I thank you a thousand times for making\n[this] meeting . . . possible, for it confirmed what I had\nbeen told, which I was never quite certain of, how far\nmy desire controlled the spirit speaking. But when I\nwas assured . . . then calm and content came to me,\nnever to leave me again.\nAnd through the last great struggle those blessed words\n.... were ever present with me, and made my physical\nsuffering a thing to be borne to obtain the greatest\ndesire of my heart.\nThank God, it was and is true.\nLater I can do more.

I prepared Mrs.\nThompson, and she will carry on the work, but it will\nnot be for long that I shall come back.\nI understand now the full meaning of what I had only half\nrealised in the subliminal consciousness. I can separate\nthe two now, and know how far conscious thought and\nunconscious thought are dependent one on the other,\nand I can fully apprehend their indivisibility. That's\nwhere I made my mistake. I believed them to be separate,\nbut now find they are merely two sides of the same thing\n\u2014the unconscious self is the sleeping conscious self, and\nthe conscious self is the reflection of the spiritual man,\nand that light, reason, and discernment come from one\nand the same source.\nI want to thank you for what you did for me.\nI was unable to, then, but my wife will give you my messages,\nthey were left with her.

When she sat down again, I took the letter and\nfound to my surprise it was addressed to me at [a certain address].\nThe letter runs as follows :\n\"My dear ... I spoke to you at our last meeting of my\nintense wish to [be] on the other side\nMy wish is accomplished. I am now at peace.\nI am sending you a message later through Mrs. Thompson\nand you will then understand all I said to you.\nF. W. H.

The lamp was turned down and she at\nonce saw a bright mist in corner of room, out of which gradually\nemerged the face of a tall man with moustache, blue tie, black coat\nhe advanced towards her waving his hand and evidently most anxious\nto communicate. She repeated the alphabet and he waved his hand\nat the right letter. She spelt out Edmund Gurney.\nThe friend then came in and the sitting began.\nE. G. at once controlled the medium.\n\" I have come to warn you for my friend to implore you\nnot to let them call him. He gets no rest day or night.\nAt every sitting 'Call Myers! Bring Myers,' there's not\na place in England where they don't ask for him ; it disturbs\nhim, it takes away his rest. For God's sake don't call\nhim. It is all right for him to come of his own accord.\nYou might send a letter to Light to say that when a great\nperson passes you mustn't call for him.\nDon't mention Myers' name, our people wouldn't like it. . . .\nHis heart is tender and when he hears them call, he tries\nto come. If they leave him to rest, in time he'll come\nback again more strong, but if they call and call it will take\naway the power and help and everything else. . . .\nFeb. 9. 1901.\nF. W. H. M. \"Really, really this is delightful.\n. . . , I never thought to meet you here. It was all true\nwe had not deceived ourselves. Thank you for giving me\nthe power to come. We wrote and sat so often together\nin the old days ; sometimes the results were good, sometimes\nnot at all. You are strong, very strong. Thank you so\nmuch. I could not thank you at the same time.\nhas iny message for you. I believe in the touch now.\nYour testimony, . . . , was most valuable\u2014you've done a\ngreat deal for the cause \u2014I gave my life for it. It must be\ncarried on.

[part\nThey don't know how one consciousness can merge into\nanother . . . our lives are only given us to learn how to\nhelp humanity, but it will take us thousands of years to\nlearn it . . . we must ignore the conscious self sometimes, and\nlet the unconscious self have a chance . . I implore you\nnot to lose the least scrap of evidence. It is only by\nputting down all the scraps you make a mosaic.\nFeb. 10. 1901.\nF. W. H. M. (by raps)\n'Your friend is here.' Then the medium saw F. M. in Mr.\n[White's] body. She went into a trance and spoke.\nHe's there. He's in Mr. [White.] He is lying on a brown\nbed, and he has got violets, and his eyes are shut, and\nbeside him is standing another Mr. Myers, and the other\none has picked up some of the violets,\n\u2014That's the curious experience\u2014He is tied\nto it yet, and has to hold the cord of light in his hand\nhe can't leave go. He is in you Mr. [White] still, but\nhe is in bed, and standing beside the bed. He dictated\nthree letters the day before he died\u2014important letters,\nand left a paper for Richet. ( . . ) You'll hear through\nanother source in 10 days' time a curious circumstance\nof his illness and death. You'll hear it at a place you'll\ngo to after a little from here. [The gentleman here called\nMr. White is generally recognised as possessor of some\noccult powers.]\nFeb. 16. 1901.\nDuring the sitting Miss Eawson suddenly got up and went across\nthe room to the writing table, and wrote a note in pencil pur-\nporting to come from F. M. We could not read it.\nMar. 17. 1901. London.\nEdmund Gurney.\nIt will be no advantage to my friend to be kept down for\ncommunication with the groups he prepared.\nWhat we want for him now is to rise, and to forget the\nearthly things. He can't help any more. His life was\ngiven to it, and that must be the help. He was allowed\njust to say that he continued. That was his great desire,\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter V. 225\nbut it will help nobody that he should be called back,\nand made to hover near the earth. In fact it will only\nmake him earthbound. So tell all those who tried to\npersuade him to come, ... to receive the messages that\nwill be sent now and again, but never permanently.\nAnother control.\nThe mistake Myers made was, he thought the finite could\ncontrol the infinite ; so he gathered groups and did his\nbest to train them into working order, to carry out his\ndesign. This was not a good thing to do \u2014mapping out\nwork to do under different conditions which he did\nnot understand. He made promises, but did not know\nif he could fulfil them or not ; and now he knows\nthese different groups will have to go on as they\nbegan, not with communications direct from the other\nside, but communications attracted to a centre and\ngiven out in a revised form.\nIf you pass over with a fixed idea of which you have sown\nthe seed, and which you have nourished up until it is a\ntree, you must wait till the tree withers and dies, you\ncan't sweep away the idea in a second.\nI have seen Myers, he is perfectly happy ; he finds many of\nhis theories difficult to work.\nI believe Mrs. T. to be quite honest and straightforward.\nMarch 19.\n\" Myers is here, but will not be able to speak himself.\nI shall speak for him. He is not so near, and not so real\nas he was. This means that he is soon leaving the earth\nplane and going to rise higher.\nHe is being personated right and left.\nHe is being used as a peg to hang innumerable hats and\ncoats on. He came to thank you and to say that as\nyou prayed for others at a sitting when he was present,\nso he hopes you will pray for him now.\n\"\nIn concluding this chapter I must once more call attention to the\ncaution and explanation with which it opened. These scripts repre-\nsent a genuine phenomenon, and are therefore of interest to students\nof psychical matters, although it is quite possible that a hostile critic\nP\n\f226 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nmay here find part of the pabulum necessary for making every effort\nof the kind appear ridiculous. Whether this portion, or the subsequent\ncommonplace dialogue carried on through Mrs. Piper, or such of the\nunverifiable communications as were reported, in Chap. II., will appear\nthe more humorous when regarded from the scoffer's point of view,\nI am unable to judge. Nor need the question deeply concern us.\nCHAPTER VI.\nMessages of the Myers and Hodgson controls received\nby 0. J. L. through Mrs. Piper.\nAutumn Series.\nComing now to communications obtained through Mrs. Piper, the\n\" Myers \" messages were, as I said before, not specially useful or\nimpressive : partly perhaps because I did not give this control much\nchance. They were far less interesting than those reported in\nChap. IV.\nThe dramatic aspect of the \" Myers \" communications, being not\nspecially striking, I shall no longer trouble to quote what imme-\ndiately preceded or followed them, but shall give as a rule only\nthe substance of the message ;\ntogether with such facts of date\nand circumstance as shall enable easy reference to the original MS.\nwhenever necessary.\nI had at first thought of collecting the MyersP and the HodgsonP\nscripts separately, but inasmuch as they deal with a similar class\nof subject, as a rule, there seems no particular gain in separating\nthem ; and perhaps there may be some convenience in retaining\nthem in the actual order in which they occurred \u2014omitting only the\nirrelevant parts and such as were concerned altogether with other\ncontrols. If a Gurney or Sidgwick control had appeared in this\nset, it would likewise be included.\nTo save the reader trouble \u2014that is to say what seems to me\nunnecessary trouble\u2014I introduce punctuation and other trivial clari-\nfication into the script. It must be understood that it is not by\nany means always easy to read. Occasionally it is necessary to\nillustrate the superposition of words and other accidental defects,\nbut this is not so necessary in my report as it was in Mr.\nPiddington's.\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter VI. 227\nProceeding now to the record, we may as well quote the initial\nparticulars of the first sitting of the Edgbaston series, which followed\nthe few Liverpool sittings, reported on pp. 175-189; but all that can\nbe published is confessedly very poor, and is preliminary only.\nFOURTH ENGLISH SITTING WITH MRS. PIPER.\n(First at Edgbaston.)\nHeld at Mariemont, Edgbaston, on 15 Nov., 1906, 11.0 a.m.,\nending 1 p.m.\nPresent\u20140. J. L. and M. L.\n(Hand raised. Cross in air.)\n+ Hail.\n0. -T. L. Hail, Imperator and Rector.\nWe are glad to return once more to earth this day. -f- 11.\nWe desire that you should understand and know the truth.\n0. J. L. All right. (Then began a \"Myers\" message.)\nWell well Lodge. I am Myers.\nO. J. L. Hail Myers, glad to see you.\nI have not forgotten you in the least.\n0. J. L. Nor I you. (Some private matters were here referred to.)\nDo you remember a talk I had with you in which I\npromised to do better than others 1 [Cf. a similar remark\nmade through Mrs. Thompson on page 208.]\n0. J. L. Yes, you always thought you would do better.\nIn case I came first.\nO. J. L. Yes.\nI wish you to remind me of something.\n0. J. L. What we are anxious to get is correspondence messages\nbetween this medium and others.\nGood. I U.D.\n\fSir Oliver Lodge. [part\nWell, will you now give one to some one 1\nVery well ;\ngive me a message.\nSuppose you say 'Julius Caesar.' Can you send that?\nYes, I believe I can, but let me repeat the message that I\nmay be quite certain of it.\nGood.\nSpell it. (O. J. L. spells it.)\nJulius C e s e a r\nO. J. L. Yes, very near, not quite right.\nSpell it. (0. J. L. spelt Csesar again.)\nCoesar.\n0. J. L. Yes, it is really JE diphthong, not OE.\nI said 0, it is intended for 0.\nO. J. L. Very well then, I quite understand.\nI will give it her within five minutes,\n0. J. L. That would be excellent.\nHe has gone.\nI need not point out how absurd all this need for spelling, and\nother signs of apparently rudimentary ignorance, would seem, if we\nwere to assume that we were in effective touch with the intelligence\nof F. W. H. Myers; even though intercourse be, as it is repre-\nsented as being, conducted through the intermediate agency of an\namanuensis,\u2014namely the control calling itself Eector, who purports\nto be ignorant of everything but simple English. Our business is\nto record the facts, and to make deductions from them afterwards.\nThese trivial signs may be an indication of something which will\nhelp towards a theory of the phenomenon some day. Meanwhile it\nmust be regarded as curious on any hypothesis that there should\nhave been hesitation at taking a couple of words so simple as these,\nsince it cannot be urged in this case that such words are foreign to\nthe brain of the medium. All that we can say, I think, is that\nthey are treated as a '\ncode '\nmessage, which must be received and\nconveyed with scrupulous precision, in order to be efficient. As to\n228\n0. J. L.\n0. J. L.\n\fLviir.] On Trance Commtmications, Char\npter VI. 229\nthe ce instead of the a?, it would have been characteristic and satis-\nfactory if the misspelling had reappeared in Mrs. Verrall's script.\nFor if it had so appeared it would have been a good case of\nthe simplest kind of cross-correspondence. But as a matter of fact\nthis particular message did not succeed in getting through at all.\nReturning to the record, I omit a long interlude and talk between\nsome other controls and M. L. on various subjects, chiefly medical,\nand take it up again at a later stage of the sitting.\nMyers.\n0. J. L. Yes, well J\nHere I am I have given j'our message to Mrs. Verrall and\nshe will record it in black and white within a few hours.\n[It is noticeable here that the controls discriminate between\nthe delivery of a message and the actual record of it.\nThe interval mentioned here is \" a few hours.\" In\nour actual experience there is sometimes an interval\nof a few days or even weeks between the claim and\nthe performance.]\n0. J. L. I hope she will not forget it.\nNo, I will see to that. Good-bye.\n0. J. L. Good-bye for the present.\n(Another short interlude. Then scrawls of a curiously\nenergetic nature, ending)\nI am Hodgson.\n0. J. L. Glad to see you at last.\nHello Lodge. I am not dead, as some might suppose : I\nam very much alive.\n0. J. L. Good, I expect so.\nI wish to correct a statement I made some time ago to\nPiddington.\n0. J. L. Whatever you say I will send to him.\nI did not send you a posthumous letter, but I gave one to\nWilliam James, which I will re-read to you before we\nget through.\n\f230 Sir Oliver Lodge.

But I never saw you in the flesh.\n[They were not acquainted.]\nI wish of all things to do the very best thing to prove my\nidentity.\n[A few private matters are here omitted.]\nOh yes, well get Mrs. S. to verify it.\nO. J. L. You mean Mrs. Sidgwick?\nYes, and it will be good. Better use judgement.\nGive my love to Piddington and tell him I shall try cross\nmessages.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VI. 231\n0. J. L. And also we shall introduce some of your friends to you,\nand see if you recognise them.\nGood. I wish Feilding to meet me.\n0. J. L. Yes, but he is not in England just now.\nYes, I will see him later on.\n0. J. L. They wish your medium to sit in the rooms of the\nSociety.\nWhy?\n0. J. L. Well, because of the difficulty of lodgings, and because the\nsittings will be more under control.\nAll right; it may be good. If not, I will tell them.\nYou understand me wonderfully well.\n0. J. L. Well I have been practising reading this writing, in readiness.\nCapital.\n0. J. L. I have to arrange the days to suit us both. I am very\nbusy. To-morrow and Sabbath [see page 175] will suit\nme best. Can we have '\nvoice '\nto-morrow ?\nVoice, yes certainly. Good ; all right.\nI hope Piddington will get into the spiritual truth of this\nthing. If he does, all will be very good. It is very\nimportant not to crowd in too many.\nO. J, L. He will introduce people only after the trance has begun.\nVery good, I U.D. ; there can be no objection to that.\n0. J. L. And only one at a time.\nYes, better probably for most who meet me.\n0. J. L. We want you to recognise your friends, and to take cross\nmessages.\nYes, very good ; we are willing to do anything we can.\n0. J. L.

It is so nice to\nwaken up and see you and know you.\n(End of trance.)\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VI. 233\nThe next was a voice sitting\u2014that is a talking, not a writing,\nsitting\u2014as promised. It is the only one of the kind we had during\nthe whole of this English series : and it was less unlike those of\nthe old Phinuit days than I had expected. In fact there was\ndistinct recurrence of what in the old days used to be called \" fishing,\"\nwhen Phinuit was groping in tentative fashion for a name and hoping\nfor help from the sitter. More fishing is reported on pp. 266-7.\nBut in truth I have long wanted to exonerate Phinuit from most\nof the blame in this matter. The 1\nfishing ' procedure had to be\nadmitted, and indeed emphasised, like all other weak spots ; and\nPhinuit had not been trained to eschew normal help and to take\nprecautions against it, as Mrs. Thompson's '\nNelly ' control had been\ntrained ; but I always felt that his haziness and tentative approach\nto things probably represented a genuine difficulty, and was part of\nthe phenomenon which needed study ; so I am interested in reading\nin Dr. Hodgson's Report, page 382, Vol. 13, the following judicial\npronouncement\n\" It was out of the automatic dreameries of persons in some\nsuch conditions as those which I have illustrated above, that\nPhinuit in my present view so often had to fish his facts,\nand I think that assent to correct statements and other clues\nfrom the sitters, besides helping the '\ncommunicator,' were prob-\nably of great service to Phinuit, enabling him to '\ncast his line\nfor those mental automatisms that specially concerned the sitter.\nMuch light seems to me to have been thrown upon Phinuit's\nmistakes and obscurities and general method of trying to get\nat facts, in what were on the whole bad sittings, by comparison\nof the results obtained from the various communicators writing\ndirectly or using Gr. P. as amanuensis ; and I feel pretty sure\nthat much of Phinuit's '\nfishing ' was due to the confusions of\nthe more or less comatose communicators, whose minds had let\nloose, so to speak, a crowd of earthly memories.\"\nFor the voice sitting all preparatory arrangements, with the\ncushions etc. (p. 131), were made as usual, and when trance super-\nvened, the head sank upon them ; but instead of the right hand\nslipping off and ultimately holding a pencil, both hands remained all\nthe time on the cushion, while the head raised itself and emitted\nspeech in a rather deep voice. The manner was solemn, without any\nof the ejaculations and humorous slang of Phinuit; and although up\nto this time I had thought that a voice sitting would be easier\n\f234 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nand better (as it is certainly more interesting and less strain to\na sitter) I perceived that really it possessed but little advantage\nover a writing sitting\u2014now that the lively Phinuit control, who\nwas specially competent in this kind of manifestation, had disappeared;\nwhile for evidential purposes, and permanent record, the writing\nmethod is indisputably better.\nAs this was the only voice sitting, however, I think I had\nbetter report sufficient to give some idea of the manner of it.\nFIFTH SITTING.\n(Voice.)\nHeld at Mariemont, Edgbaston, on 16 November, 1906,\n11.0-12.0 a.m.\nPresent\u20140. J. L. and M. L., with Mrs. Grove.\nI come to take up the voice as I promised thee.\nI bring to thee this day a message from Imperator that\nthat for which thou dost ask can be granted [meaning\nabout London arrangement].\n[It is rather curious that Rector speaking for himself should\nemploy the second person singular for his pronoun,\nwhereas when giving messages from a member of a\nQuaker family he explains that he translates from\n\"thou\" to \"you\" because he \"understands it better.'\nSee p. 193.\u2014O.J.L.]\nI see all well. I shall conform to those requests if they\ninvolve no injury to physical conditions of Medium,\nwithout injury to the brain. We understand the con-\nditions and must be obeyed.\n(Others spoke here, but I only report the short 'Myers'\nportions.)\nHere is Myers. I must express myself to Lodge with\ndeepest affection. I have not succeeded in getting it\nthrough to Mis. Verrall, but I will persist. [This may\nbe regarded as a warning of the failure otherwise referred\nto in Mrs. Verrall's script of same date. See J. G. P.'s\npaper, Vol. 22, p. 306.]\n(Messages from others here intervened.)\n\fLVIII.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VI. 235\n\" St. Paul \" has been given. Ask Piddington if he remembers\nanything about a church at Mrs. Holland's. Ask him if\nhe gave a message to be recorded here about a church\nif he said \" church \" to Mrs. Holland. [See Proc. S.P.R.,\nVol. 22, p. 46.]\n(Messages from others again intervened.)\nIt would be wise to give Prudens a message to take to\nanother lady. Give it to me to give to Prudens, who\nwill take it to Mrs. Forbes.\nO. J. L. I understand. Well, suppose you suggest \" Botanic Gardens.\"\nBotanic Gardens. Very well, Prudens will take this.\nThat was all that came through of that hind, on this occasion.\nThe ladies whose names here and elsewhere in the Proceedings are\nprinted as Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Forbes were really spoken of by\ntheir right names.\nIt will be of interest to those familiar with the script of Stainton\nMoses to see the names of his old Controls cropping up. Not\nonly Imperator and Rector, but 'Prudens' also, who appears to act\nas an accomplished messenger. I conjecture, however, that whatever\nrelationship may exist between these personages and the correspond-\ning ones of Stainton Moses there is little or no identity. For\ninstance, a '\nDoctor ' is represented as communicating or controlling,\nbut he appears neither to have nor to claim any connexion with\nthe non-medical 'Doctor' of Stainton Moses; sometimes at any rate\nthis Piper one is called '\nDr. Oliver,' and is probably intended to\nrepresent a deceased medical man of Boston. It is rather a puzzle\nto me why Mrs. Piper's personalities should have assumed the\nsame set of names. In general characters they are similar ; but I\nsee no very close resemblance in detail. And hitherto the Piper\n'Imperator' has not given to us the same old earth-name as did\nthe original '\nImperator ' to Stainton Moses. So that it would\nappear as if they did not very seriously pretend to be identical.\nThat gives a meagre idea of a voice sitting at the present day\nand some of what is temporarily omitted may appear later in another\nconnexion. In no case was there any marked change of control,\nsuch as occurred with Phinuit sometimes. It appeared to consist\n\f236 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nof first-person-reporting on the part of Rector, who spoke after the\nfashion of a dignified and gentle old man.\nThere has been no recent experience so far as I am aware of any\napparent control except Rector during a voice sitting. Whether or\nnot other controls speak now, they certainly appear to have done so\nas late as 1906, and when they did it was evidently impressive: so\nmuch so that, as Professor James records, a lady sitter was cpiite\novercome on one occasion by the apparent identity of the Hodgson\ncontrol with R. H. and fainted. No such excitement would be\njustified by anything that has come within my experience, but even\nnow it seems to me that personality can loom out more obviously in\na voice sitting, and when clear can more thoroughly satisfy a sur-\nviving friend who is present. The record may be less exact, but\nthe impression made at the time is more vivid ; at least when the\nsitting is a personal one with only an intimate friend present.\nIt may be noted that in America with the advent of the Stainton\nMoses control the atmosphere of a sitting sometimes became rather\nmarkedly \"religious.\" This can be illustrated by the following close\nof an American voice sitting in 1906, reported to me by Mr. Dorr;\nwhich also indicates that a change of control occurred, in spite of\nthe statement on page 160 :\n(\"Hodgson\" terminating his communication.)\nWell, I will be off. Goodbye for the present.\n(Rector resumes.) All right. That is first rate. Took him\na long time to turn round and get out. He dislikes to\ngo more than anybody I ever saw. The last moment\nhe kept talking to me and talking to me. He could not\ngive it up.\nPrayek.\nFather, in Thy kindness guide Thy children of earth, bestow\nThy blessings on them, teach them with Thy presence\nand Thy power to receive suffering, pain, illness and\nsorrow, teach them to know that Thy presence is always\nwith them. May Thy grace and everlasting love be and\nabide with them now and evermore.\nFarewell. We depart, friends, and may the blessings of\nGod be bestowed on you. Farewell.\nIt is only occasionally that the atmosphere of a sitting is serious\nand solemn\u2014usually it is of an even tenour, and sometimes it is\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VI. 237\nhearty and jovial. The following is a characteristic \"Hodgson\"\ngreeting extracted from a sitting with Mr. Dorr and Henry James,\nJr., at Boston in 1906:\nHa! Well, I did not expect to see you so soon. Good\nmorning, Harry !\nI am delighted to see you.\nH. J. Jr. Is that you, Mr. Hodgson 1\nYes, it is a great delight to me to see your face once more.\nHow is everything with you, first rate ?\nH. J. Jr. Very well.\n(An \"influence\"\u2014a glove formerly belonging to Hodgson\nwas now given to Mrs. P. A brief remark, of greeting\napparently, was lost by the stenographer while this was\ngoing on.)\nWhy, I feel as though I was one among you. Hello, George !\nG. B. D. Hello !\nYou people don't appreciate my spirit of fun ! But I am\nHodgson, and I shall be Hodgson to the end of all eternity,\nand you cannot change me no matter what you do.\nH. J. Jr. I think we appreciate it, Mr. Hodgson.\nWell, I hope you do\u2014if you don't, you have lost something,\nbecause I am what I am, and I shall never be anything\nelse, and of all the joyous moments of my whole existence,\nthe most joyful is when I meet you all.\nG. B. D. That is first rate.\nThis sort of thing is of course not in the least evidential, and yet\nif I were asked to invent some scheme of salutation more natural and\ncharacteristic of Hodgson's personality I should not be able to improve\nupon it.\nEeturning now from this interpolation to the record of our both\nless solemn and less jovial English experience, \u2014although another\nvoice sitting was promised for next time, it did not turn out so,\nfor at the next trial nothing happened at all, and the attempt had\nto be abandoned.\nThe record of the beginning of the next sitting shall be printed,\nin order to exhibit the manner of it.\n\f238 Sir Oliver Lodge.

Well I do not think so.\nMy own. Much in little. Yes I used this before in my\nown writing.\n[Multum in parvo was an attempted Piper-Verrall C.-C. of\ndate 1901 ; but it had never been published, and Mrs.\nVerrall had forgotten all about it.

L. repeats word.)\nYes I have it, R., and he will understand shortly.\n0. J. L. There is a friend outside ; shall I ask him in 1\nI shall be glad to see him. presently.\nDo you remember a friend of mine named Browning 1\n0. J. L.

About four years ago Hodgson wrote to me that\nMyers had been asking after me and wanted to know what I was\ndoing. Hodgson said that he must mention something known to\nboth of us and he talked about a battle in the centre of Africa,\nof which I have no recollection whatever. It is rather curious if\nMyers has mentioned me because, although the connection between\nhim, Sidgwick, and myself was very close indeed, it is scarcely at\nall known to the external world, at least I never see any allusions\nto it.\n240\n0. J.

Hodgson, wrote thus (Rector communicating)\nAt last. At last we meet.\nB. H. Articles?\n(Hand assents.)\nE. H. Whose]\nS.\n(Articles of H. S. presented.)\nA wondrous change.

It is better so.\nGood morning. H. Sidgwick.\n\f242 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nOn the 22nd April, 1901, at 9.45 p.m. in Dr. Verrall's study at\nCambridge, Mrs. Verrall wrote thus :\nVerax quod dixi hesterno die.\nTu autem non comprensa deformasti illud. Cur non credis 1\nOmnia plana credenti.\n(Here I went to the drawing-room, as A.W.V., who\nwas in the study, moved and disturbed me.)\nmultum in parvo capax omnum [sic] sermo deest anarith-\nmetos 4'ctti ravra. . . .\nwhich being translated is :\nWhat I said yesterday is true. But you, not being understood,\nspoilt its shape. Why do you not believe\n1\n? All is plain\nto the believer.\nMuch in little\u2014capable of all [i.e. holding all] words fail\nunnumbered. This is it. . . .\nOn this matter the following comments are made by Mrs. Verrall\n(1.) Gomp-ensa is perhaps intended to mean \"having understood,\"\nnot \"being understood.\" The Latin past participle passive seems\nto be occasionally used in my early script after the fashion of a\nGreek middle participle, i.e. with an active sense.\n(2.) The script of April 22 goes on to refer to (a) the \"gate of\nCancer,\" (b) a lost paper, (c) the importance of \" superposition \" as\na help to interpretation [Notes on these points will be found in\nProc. Vols. XX. pp. 39, 195-8, 289; XXI. 377 et foil], and is signed\nwith three forms of the Greek sigma (s).\n(3.) The first automatic writing obtained by Mrs. Verrall was on\nMarch 5, 1901 ;\nprevious attempts, between Jan. 23 and Feb. 13,\nand again on March 3, having produced only disconnected words\nand some Greek letters. Thus a clear cross-correspondence between\nMrs. Piper's trance and Mrs. Verrall's writing was obtained within\n7 weeks of the inception of Mrs. Verrall's automatic script.\n\flviii.] On Trance Commitnications, Chapter VI. 243\nEIGHTH SITTING.\nAt the Eighth Sitting on 23 Nov. 1906 (present : O. J. L. alone),\n\"Isaac Thompson\" wrote a good deal, but the following came from\nHodgsonP .\nI am Hodgson, but I cannot take Rector's place to-day.\nHowever I will make a poor attempt to speak through\nhim.\n0. J. L. Very glad to see you.\nHere's ditto. Do I understand that Mrs. Piper is in England 1\n0. J. L. Yes, she is, and is staying in my house.\nCapital. If I were in the body it would not be so.\nHowever I am glad it is so.\n0.\\T. L. She is here, well and happy, with Alta and Minerva.\nGood, first rate. I am glad.\nWill you take a message to Billie Newbold for me, safe ?\n0. J. L. Yes, I will send it through William James.\nHe asked me about the name of a poem ; it was in Hindustan,\nand meant love.\n0. J. L. Meant what 3 Is that \" love 1\nCorrect. Do you remember a place in England where Gurney\nand I went to see a medium, and a long walk we had\nsoon after midnight?\n0. J. L. A long what ?\nWalked home.\n0. J. L. Oh, a long walk after midnight.\nI cannot recall her name, but I told you about it.\n0. J. L. Do you mean Gurney 1\nYes, I do, and I have never mentioned it to anyone except\npossibly Pid.\n\f244 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nVery well. [J. G. P. does not recall this.]\nDo you remember it 1\nI do not.\nDo you wish me to take a message for you 1\nAsk slowly ; remember we cannot hear as well as you can.\nI am so glad to be on this side.\n0. J. L. Well, Hodgson, I do want to ask you something. You know\nwhen I am talking to you I am talking to the hand ; but\nI want to know whether it is through the hand you\nhear. Suppose I stopped up your medium's ears with\ncotton wool, would it make any difference 1 Would the\nmessage still come ?\nI think it would, try it.\n0. J. L. Very well, I will another time.\nFirst rate, I permit it ; first rate.\nBut after all I did not try the experiment ; for it is exceedingly\ndifficult to secure complete deafness by plugging the ears\u2014even with\nputty. Moreover the necessary manipulation of the medium's head\nduring trance seemed rather repellent. It is an experiment worth\ntrying, however, if we could be sure of a clear result. If I could\nhave been sure of a crucial test I would have had it done ; but\nhyperaesthesia would have to be allowed for in the positive direc-\ntion\u2014possibly also inhibitory suggestion in the negative, \u2014and on\nthe whole I felt that no definite deduction could be made, whatever\nthe result. Nevertheless the experiment ought to be made by some\ncompetent person.\nAfter this came some private matter which is omitted, and there\nwas more talk about London arrangements and choice of room\nsuitable for the sittings there ; but nothing of permanent interest.\nThe ninth and eleventh sittings were entirely occupied with the\nsecond and third visits of Prof. J. H. Muirhead.\nAt the tenth a lady was introduced.\nAt the twelfth Mrs. Grove sat with Lady Lodge but without me.\nNothing from the S.P.R. group came at any of these.\n0. J. L.\n0. J.

Hullo, Hodgson, I want to ask you something.\nFire away at me, I am in the witness box.\n0. J. L. Well, you told me to give a message to \" Billie Nevvbold.\"\nRight.\n0. J. L. About the title of a Hindustan poem, but you did not tell\nme anything in Hindustani. That is, I expect, what he\nwanted.\nNo, I beg your pardon ; he asked me to translate into\nEnglish the name of a poem I wrote, now in his possession.\n0. J. L. And you said it meant 'love.'\nYes, I do say so, and that is correct.\n0. J. L. Very well ; and is that all I am to say to him ?\nYes, about that. But you will please tell him that he is\nnot to feel disturbed about that Medium's message : it\nis all rot. He will understand about it; i.e., his going\nto the bottom with his wife ;\ni.e., going to the bottom\nof the sea. U.D.\n\f246 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\n0. J. L. Yes, I supposed so.\nLodge, do you remember a medium I went to see long\nago with Gurney, and we walked home late at night,\nand the laugh we had about it 1 I told you about it,\nand you ought to remember it.\n0. J.fL. I am afraid I do not.\n[This probably refers to an incident he tried to recall to\nmy recollection at a previous sitting. I begin to have\nsome recollection of walking through the semi-under-\nground passage at Berkeley Square with Gurney and\nHodgson, but whether it is a case of true or false\nmemory I am not sure. The medium may have been\nEglinton, to whom I went many times fruitlessly with\nGurney ; but I had not recollected any connexion of\nHodgson with that particular series of attempts. On\nreferring to the Journal S.P.R., Vol. 2, p. 290, where\nthese experiments are recorded, however, I see that it\nmay quite well have been possible. See also page 491\nof the same volume.]\nI left a posthumous letter with W. J.\nIn it I said ....\n[This is kept back for the present, for evidential reasons.]\nI will refer to it again.\n0. J. L. Yes, we will not be in a hurry.\nDid you ask Piddington about the church ?\nHe said something to me through Mrs. Holland about church.\nO. J. L. Very well, that is a C.-C. message.\nYes, have you heard about the others yet\n1\n?\n0. J. L. No, but they will all be recorded, and collated in due time.\n0. J.L. Very well, it is getting time to stop now.\nMyers has had very little opportunity or encouragement to\nprove his identity.\n\fLVIII.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VI. 247\nO. J. L. Yes, that is fairly true so far.\nAnd now if the opportunity can be given him, no one on\nour side is more desirous of proving his identity than\nMyers. U.D.\nO. J. L. Yes, I quite understand.\nHe understands, and wishes very much to communicate with\na few of his real friends. R. It should be given him in\nany case, as he is intelligent, clear, and understands the\nnecessity of so doing.\nO. J. L. I think that this will be the last time in these surroundings\nfor the present.\nYes, we doubt if we can return\u2014again here, but hope for an\nopportunity somewhere while the light burns.\nNow, friend, we are about to depart.\nWe cannot remain here ; our utterances are fragmentary but\nthey are earnest and sincere. This must be the case\nhowever until the veil is lifted, with all made clear to\nyou. Your mind cannot help us. If you think of a thing\nseriously it cannot convey anything to us. We go, and\nmay God be with and watch over you always.\n+ Farewell E.\nj[The waking stage is reported in another connexion. See p. 276.]\nThis was the last of that particular set of Edgbaston sittings,\nand soon afterwards Mrs. Piper went to London.\nAfter her return in May, three more sittings were held, from\nthe records of which I again extract the writings of the S.P.R.\ngroup ; and since the beginning after a break is usually rather\ninteresting, I report the introductory portion also in this case.\n\f248 Sir Oliver Lodge.

PIPER.\nThe Joseph Marble Series.\nA CURIOUS, and withal distinctly evidential, series of communications\nwas obtained, partly in my presence and partly without me, by a lady\nknown to me and to a few other members of the S.P.R., whom\nI will call Mrs. Rupert Grove. There are several reasons for con-\ncealing identity : one is that people still alive would resent publication,\nand another is that it would tend to spoil some possible future\nevidence which at present remains in the form of prediction as yet\nunfulfilled.\nMrs. Grove herself is an intelligent lady of middle age, open minded\nas to the genuineness of psychical phenomena of all kinds, but in her\nown judgment tending towards scepticism, which it requires frequently\nrenewed experience to counteract. Such renewal of experience, from\n\f256 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\ntime to time, she has had through her husband, who has been more or\nless familiar with such things for years. But his attitude to them is\nunimportant, since he does not enter into this series except by incidental\nmention. He knew Mr. Marble slightly, since he also had lived for\nsome years in the same neighbourhood ; but he had at that time no\nknowledge of the great and affectionate intimacy between Mr. Marble\nand his future wife. He is still living, and I think I am right in\nassuming that he knows about it now and has learnt not to resent\nit. Nevertheless the possibility that he might dislike it is another\nreason for anonymity. And, after all, names in this case are of no\nimportance, since none of the people primarily concerned is of any\npublic notoriety or importance.\nI shall begin with a statement written down by Mrs. Grove on the\n14th June, 1907, and kept by me till the present time.\nStatement by Mrs. Grove, made 14th June, 1907,\nwith reference to earlier incidents.\nMr. Joseph Marble and his sister, Mrs. Kate Sandford, were neigh-\nbours of each other and also neighbours and old friends of my mother,\nnear Ashton ; and he had a small '\nworks ' not far from Stalybridge.\nBoth were well-read, clear-headed, somewhat sceptical people. They\nknew me better than any one else, and were interested in everything\nthat concerned me. In fact there was a strong and very deep affection\nbetween us, unknown to any one else. Some years after my marriage,\nwhen I had gained a little experience of psychical matters through\na few visits to a medium in 1896, I often spoke to them separately,\nbut especially to him, on the subject, trying to make him realize\nand see things as I was beginning with a good deal of hesitation\nto see them ; but without success. He listened as he would have\nlistened to anything I told him, but more with amusement than\nacceptance.\nMrs. Sandford was equally incredulous, and said, rather distinctly,\nthat she did not like such things. So I never really expected to get\ncommunications purporting to come from them.\nNevertheless, in two sittings with Mrs. Thompson, during the\nSpring of 1900, about three years after Mr. Marble's death, I did\ntry for something of the kind, by taking with me an object that had\nbelonged to him. And communications seemed to come from Mr.\nMarble almost the whole time : giving many facts that could not\nbe known by anyone else. His sister (a widow) was then alive.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VIII. 257\nThe communications included a short piece of writing, in which\namong other things he wrote\u2014very naturally\u2014\"I never thought I\nshould attempt in so rubbishy a manner to demonstrate the truth of\nyour own strange belief, but I live, I live, etc.\" (See p. 263.)\nThe communications just received through Mrs. Piper from him and\nhis sister are in many ways quite appropriate to their individuality.\nMrs. Sandford went by the name of Aunt Kitty among her nieces\n(his daughters, \u2014the ablest of whom is named Peggy), with whom I\nwas on affectionate terms.\nThe family still retains the old incredulity and strong repugnance to\nanything spiritistic, but the two deceased members of it seem most\nanxious to make up for their scepticism by giving a carefully considered\nkind of proof, which if it comes off (but this seems at present past\nbelief) will be to me most wonderful and satisfying.\nAlick F.

[This phrase is distinctly charac-\nteristic of Mr. Marble.]\nNOTES BY 0. J. L.\nAll this J. M. business is extraordinarily good. It is really more\nlifedike than the subsequent quieter Piper impersonation, some six\nor seven years later. At that time, however, the attempt to\ngive evidence, here foreshadowed, is really made : and the Control\nshows some knowledge of what was said here, e.g. by writing that\n\f264 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\n\"lie does believe in God now.\" (Cf. p. 261 just above.) If it be true\nthat any J. M. material comes, or has come, through Mrs. Verrall,\nor other strangers, it will be excellent. At present telepathy from\nthe sitter is the least strained hypothesis that will account for\nit. No more normal explanation than that will serve.\nThe substitution on one occasion of '\nMr. Limestone ' for Mr.\nMarble is characteristic of the '\nNelly ' control, and recalls the\nsubstitution of 'Happyfield' for Merrifield, as reported in Vol. 17,\np. 208. These small things are of interest as tending to throw light\non the mechanism of the process ; at least in this instance. But\njust as people differ in power of visualising and other methods of\nreminiscence, so each case of automatism should be studied as likely\nto possess individual features.\nThese materials were sent to Mr. Myers in the year 1900, who\nreplied as follows :\nCambridge,\nMay 30\/0 [1900].\nMy dear Lodge,\nWith many thanks for enclosed, I think it need not\nbe typewritten in my series. A sentence from Mrs. Grove's letter\nas to general impression\u2014will suffice, and I think we will now\nwait and see what the '\nspirits ' suggest of themselves after a year.\nMrs. T. had another somewhat disturbing impression of this 'spirit,'\nwhich, as she thought, roused her from the trance at my last sitting\nwith van Eeden.\u2014He said something about returning in a year,\nin a tone which rather roused her opposition. We had better just\nwait and let matters develop themselves\u2014no need to say anything\nabout the matter as yet.\nF. W. H. M.\nAfter this the same Control sent occasional messages through other\nmediums, to whom Mrs. Grove occasionally went anonymously, hoping\nto get some more evidence. These communications are hardly worth\nreporting; but as no clue of any kind was given, they seemed beyond\nchance, since they clearly had reference to the same personality\nand incidents. But of course they were \u2014like most of this series\nwell within the scope of telepathy. The few incidents outside the\nscope of telepathy remain for the future to verify. These were\nobtained through Mrs. Piper\u2014from whose script on this subject\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VIII. 265\nI now extract portions ; but for evidential reasons it is necessary to\nwithhold the not yet verified portions for subsequent publication.\nThey are all carefully kept. In the interim, between 1900 and 1906,\nMrs. Kate Sandford, sister of Mr. Joseph Marble, had died in her\nown house.\nThe main difference between the communications received through\nMrs. Thompson, as reported above, and the communications which\nfollow, obtained through Mrs. Piper, lies in the fact that one was\nconversational and therefore easy, whereas the other was hampered\nby the difficulty of deciphering a more or less illegible script. Even\nwhen a skilled reader is present it is not easy, but to a sitter who\nis comparatively a novice at the work the difficulty is extreme.\nFor part of Mrs. Grove's time I was present and assisted with the\nreading, but the presence of an outside person is naturally perturbing,\nand hence the opportunity for referring to intimate matters was not\nso complete as during the previous voice sittings with Mrs. Thompson\nalone. Another difference seems to be due to the fact that at the\nlater date communication begins not directly with Mr. Marble\nhimself but with his now deceased sister ; and the presence of this\nadditional communicator exerted another restraining influence\u2014not\nonly on the other side, so to speak, but even 1 thought on Mrs.\nGrove.\nAnxiety to communicate in an evidential manner if possible, and\ngenuine affection, were manifested now as strongly as before ; but\nthe tone was somewhat more sedate, and more what may be called\n'religious.' Probably most of this is due to the intervention of\nRector, but it is represented as indicating some progress in the\ncommunicator himself.\nIn Mis. Grove's opinion, the communicator seemed the same person\nin the main, and not more different in detail than the different cir-\ncumstances might reasonably be held to justify.\nLet it be remembered then that the remaining communications\nare obtained, not as heretofore through Mrs. Thompson by the voice,\nbut through Mrs. Piper by writing.\nSitting of Mrs. Grove vritli Mrs. Piper in November, 1906.\nThe first appearance of anything in connexion with Mr. Joseph\nMarble or his sister Mrs. Kate Sandford\u2014frequently known as Aunt\nKitty though she was no relation\u2014 occurred in the midst of other\n\f260 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nmatter, when Mrs. Grove was present and had handed in a brown\ntie belonging to the late Mr. Marble, thus :\nWho is Kate ? Sends her dearest love. All is well, and\nhopes it is with j'ou. Wants you to remember her as\nshe was glad she came over.\n(Feeling shawl worn by sitter.)\nShe made it. She gave it to you.\nMrs. G. Yes, she did. [It was the last thing that Mrs. Sandford\nhad made ; she had given it to Mrs. G., who happened\nnow accidentally to have it on.]\nWants you to keep it always.\nThere is the same influence about these two, (tie and\nshawl) they are connected, and yet they are not. I will\nget it clear. She does love you so. She thinks as much\nof you as of anyone now in the body. Do you remember\nher father?\nMrs. G. No.\nHe came a long time ago.\nLawrence, no Lorenz ;\nno, I cannot get it. A lady whom\nshe knew who nursed her in the body. [A lady com-\npanion used to live with Mrs. Sandford in her last\nyears ; but the name was not at all like Lawrence.]\nShe was with her when she passed out. This is a\ncompanion. These two influences, ihis is the sister, and\nthis is the brother.\nMrs. G. Right.\nShe (feeling shawl) was not far from your mother's sur-\nroundings.\nMrs. G. True. [They all lived near together.]\nKate's is an excellent influence. This object (brown tie) is\nnot quite what I like.\nThe influence of the body is not quite so clear. A dimmer\nlight.\nThy presence attracts both.\nThis (brown tie) influence is a little puzzling.\nI think I might get this another time clearer.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VIII. 267\nI will speak to him myself.\nGive me these when I return.\nI often get best results by speaking to someone on our\nside and then speaking directly I return.\nMrs. G. All right ; Kate will help you.\nThe next sitting was held specially for Mrs. Grove, and the subject\nwas developed during most of the time. It would, however, be tedious\nto quote it all, for some of the incidents mentioned could not be\nrecalled by the sitter, and others were given only vaguely. I take\nthe beginning, and then a bit out of the middle : the beginning of\nMr. Marble's appearance, as a communicator through Mrs. Piper,\nbeing perforce included. It is very hazy and confused at first, but,\nas soon as it is properly established, this impersonation will be\nrecognised as fairly consistent with the hitherto unpublished repre-\nsentation through Mrs. Thompson recorded above, and obtained six\nand a half years previously. The opening words of the following\nrecord purport to be from Mrs. Sandford :\nI am well and happy in this life, so is my brother Martin\nwho greets you with great love. [This name Martin\nseems to be merely a muddle of Rector's.]\nKate and Martin [ 1 ] are both here to greet you. He asks\nme to remind you of a ring which you had a long\ntime ago.\nMrs. G. I am glad to meet Kate again, but I do not know Martin.\nSpeak to me.\nMrs. G. I have the ring on my finger now.\nI wish I could speak to you as I feel. I think of the days\nthat are gone and the joy I had in life.\nHave you seen mother since I came over or do you under-\nstand anything about her 'I Jane.\nMrs. G. No I don't understand.\nShe came to this life many years ago.\nMrs. G. I don't know anything about her.\nAll right. Speak. Don't let me get confused\u2014that sign.\nNo one could recall better than myself that ring (not\nread) but myself would remember that ring.\n\f268 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nMrs. G. No. [A ring given by Mr. Marble to Mrs. G., long ago, was\non her finger, as said above.]\nI am really near you now, and so glad to have found my\nway here. [This purports to be Mr. Marble communi-\ncating.]\nMks. G. Can you quote to me a line of Eossetti's that you said to\nme\u2014a sort of farewell poem 1\nI am not sure about that, but I will try my very best to\nrefresh my memory with it, and repeat it if possible\nhere. Do you remember Halstead Hall ?\nMrs. G. No : no I do not.\nHall Hall Hall.\n0. J. L. (Thinking to help matters on) Hell Hall ?\nNo No No friend, Halstead Hall where I used to ... .\n[illegible] in part of the writing.\nDid those lines go like this,\n\"All day for day drift far apart'\"?\nMrs. G. No, those are not the lines.\nNot quite right friend.\nOur lives apart.\nMrs. G. No.\nI do not recall the exact poem, but don't trouble about it\nit will all be clear in time, and I will give it you. I\ncertainly will. [It was never given. Mrs. G. herself\nquoted it later.] Do you remember anything about Hall ?\nMrs. G. A hall we used to pass in walking, where the Jeffersons\nlived?\n(Excitement in hand) Not far from that hall.\nMrs. G. Do you mean Casford Hall?\nYes I do. I told Eector again and again.\nHalsford Hall. M.\nThere is something on his mind.

No, not there [but if he meant another hall it would be\nright].\nNo, but we stopped at Hall on our way and sat.\nMrs. G. I don't recollect.\nThink a moment friend, he is surely right.\nThink a moment.\nMrs. G. I cannot remember it.\n(And so on with other ineffective reminiscences for about five\nor ten minutes more, then)\nDo you remember Singing 1 [or possibly a portmanteau attempt\nat Sunday morning.]\nMrs. G. Singing 1 Yes, very badly.\nI remember well. Sunday ming [clearly meant for either\nevening or morning].\nRepeat. Not singing. I was going to progress and go on in\nthis life.

It must have seemed cruel not to\nunderstand. I thought he referred to \"singing,\" so he\ngoes to that at last.]\nMrs. G. I want you to say something that I may know it is you.\nOh yes. Yes, you used to sing occasionally sing when\nI came to your house. You sang evening evening the\nlast time I heard you.\n0. J. L.

How shall I get her to do this ? Do you mean pray 1\nYes, and she will always hear you.

Yes, I do.\nI tried, Alice, to love many times\u2014 a good many times,\nbut could not, but I could not.\n[This is intelligible also, but the explanation would be long.]\nAt a much later sitting Mrs. Grove again sat, and again had the\nshawl with her. Messages came from Kate Sandford, the sister of\nJoseph Marble.\nMes. G. Is Kate here ?\nYes I am here dear. Joe feels so bad to think that he\ncould not understand what you said better. He says\nhe does understand you about the last dance at his\nhouse, and going home with you.\nI understand also all that.\nI never knew when I was in the body. . . . [This is true.\nShe did not know of the terms of affection we were on.\nNor indeed did anyone.]\nI am Kate, Joe's sister.

Can you tell me whom you have met in your world 1\n[This question was intended to extract a reference to her\nhusband, who long pre-deceased her ;\nbut, instead, a\ncurious introduction of a deceased friend, well known\nto both, occurs. 0.

L.\nWe are surrounded by your friends.\nThey long to reach you friend of Earth, and unburden their\nminds.\nThe first to greet you is Kitty, Kitty.\n[This is Mrs. Kate Sandford, commonly called \"Aunt Kitty,\"\nsister of Mr. Joseph Marble.]\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter VIII. 273\nMrs. G. Ah, at last the right name. Why did you call yourself Kate\nbefore ?\nBecause I did it for Rector's understanding.\nI am with you dear Alice. I see and understand all your\nenquiry, so does Joe. . . .\nAlice he loves you dearly, etc.\n(Then he was represented as saying,)\nHave you any idea of my joy at meeting you 1\nI feel it must mean much to me as life goes on.\nWith you in the body this privilege of speaking to you is\neverything to me. It helps me to free my mind. And\nmy sister has been so patient and kind to me. She has\nhelped me to find you dear, as she came to this life after\nI did. [Correct.]\nPray for me always, etc.\n(Then some messages for identification, such as)\nHe used to go down to those buildings, his works, and mix\nthe materials [to some extent specified] for the workmen.\nHe supervised it himself and used to judge of their work\nafter they were completed. [This was all correct.]\n(Then a communication about one of the late workmen, not\nyet verified.) [A great number of details were given,\nbut there appears no means of verifying them at\npresent, though an attempt has been made. 0. J. X.]\nMrs. G. I am going home soon and will enquire.\nGood I am glad. Bridge. Bridge.\nHe is spelling it out to me. Sounds like Stale Stale Bridge\nStale.\nMrs. G. Yes that's right.\nWorks at Bridge Staly.\nNow dear I am not sure that I can give you further proofs\nof identity, because I am Marble, and I am serious and\nin earnest. I love you dearly. I always did, and my\nlife would be a barren waste, he says a barren waste,\nwithout your prayers and love.\ns\n\f274 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nMrs. G. A barren waste ? I thought you were happy.\nOh yes, I am absolutely happy.\nI understand so much better now.\nMrs. G. What should I pray for ?\nFor a re-union of our souls, for my peace, and for me to be\nable to reach you in this meagre and simple way.\nMrs. G. Do you wish to come ?\nIt has helped me more than you can ever realise ; and if I\ndo not speak again it will not injure me, as I have\npractically freed my mind, as I have practically freed my\nmind. It has been such a help to me and to Kitty also.\nMrs. G. Dear 'Aunt Kitty.'\nThat sounds so natural to me.\nI love to hear it.\nDo you love me, and do you understand how blind I was ?\nForgive me.\nMrs. G. You mean your incredulity ; but you cannot make people\nbelieve.\nYes, but I was so stupid, I would not believe dear.\nNow I understand I am sorry I did not.\nMrs. G. Does it make any difference 1\nOnly I feel I hurt you dear.\nMrs. G. Not much.\nBut I did not have the opportunity, did I really dear 1\nMrs. G. No.\nIt is time to close now. E.\nThe few opportunities afforded by later sittings were utilised for\nreiterated communications, intended to be evidential, regarding the\npresent state of an old workman whom the Marble control wanted\nfound and helped through the agency of his daughter Peggy, whom\nhe correctly named. But hitherto it has been impossible to ascertain\nthe facts or to get any co-operation from this source.\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter VIII. 275\nIf verified in the future, this part may be extremely good, but at\npresent it would be absurd to quote it. So\u2014though carefully re-\ncorded and filed\u2014it is left unreported. The mingled restraint and\nutterance of the Marble control, throughout, were exceedingly natural,\nand practically overcame the incredulity of the sitter\u2014at any rate\nfor the time.\nExperiment on the recognition of a Photograph of one of the Controls.\nThe waking stages of the last sitting of the first Edgbaston series\nin December, 1906, and of the first of the second series in\nMay, 1907, \u2014with an interval between them of five months,\nare worth recording because of an experiment I made in connexion\nwith the likeness of a person supposed to have been communicating\nduring the trance (in this case Mr. Marble) : the point being to see\nwhether there would be any recognition of a photograph by the\nautomatist before her state had become entirely normal, \u2014that is\nduring the sort of period in which it is customarily possible dimly\nto remember dreams. This stage is referred to by Dr. Hodgson on\npage 401 of Vol. 13\u2014where he calls it Mrs. Piper's subliminal stage,\na,nd says that it is a condition in which she frequently has visions\nof the distant or departing \" communicators.\"\nOn the first occasion I waited rather a long time before trying\nthe experiment,\u2014something more than an hour, and the recognition\nwas uncertain; but faint as it was, it seemed to be a residual effect\nof the trance ; since it was not permanent, and by next day had\nentirely disappeared.\nOn the second occasion I tried directly after the waking-stage\nwas complete ; and then the recognition was immediate and certain.\nBut in a few minutes it had become vague and dim, and before\nthe end of the day it had again completely ceased.\nThe following is the complete contemporary record of Mrs. Piper's\nsomnambulic utterances during the first of these two waking stages.\nThe ejaculations happen to be foreign to the present case, since\nthey refer to the concerns of a stranger who had recently had a\nsitting but who was now absent. Incidentally I may mention that the\ndescription now given of this sitter's deceased mother, who had been\nrepresented as communicating during the sitting, is correct and\nevidential.\nMr. Marble had also been represented as communicating during a\nportion of the same sitting, and that is why I tried the experiment\n\f276 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nwhich in the sequel is described ;\nthough I tried it under better\nconditions after the waking stage of the next ensuing sitting, as\nsubsequently reported.\nWaking Stage of No. 13.\nMyers, Myers.

I do not like to come back\nhere.\nWhen the light shines in I see all sorts of things in the\nroom.\nSequel to No. 13.\nSitting lasted from 11.10 to 1.10.\nAfter lunch I took eleven photographs of men, and asked Mrs.\nPiper if she had ever seen any of them. She looked over them,\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter VIII. 277\nhesitating on the one representing Mr. Joseph Marble for some\ntime, and then picked that out and said she had seen that man\nsomewhere, but she could not remember where. Nothing was said\nby me during the process, of course.\nNext day, in the evening, I tested Mrs. Piper again with another\nset of photographs of men, partly the same and partly different,\nbut containing among others the critical one. This time, however,\nit was looked at without comment and without interest, and no\nremembrance of the appearance seemed to persist. She remembered\nthe fact of having recognised one before ; but when asked to do it\nagain, she picked out, after much hesitation, a different one as a\npossibility, and said that she thought it had been found in America\nthat the memory evaporated in time, and that it was strongest\nwithin an hour of the sitting. The test made the day before had\nbeen made about an hour and a half after the sitting.\nAnd this is the record of the second of the two waking-stages, five\nmonths later : the '\nJoe ' here referred to is Mr. Marble, who had\nbeen represented as communicating during the sitting :\nIFaking Stage of No. 14.\nAll right.

Mr. Piddington used to tease me.\nHe was a large man and then all of a sudden he went out.\nHe was a nice looking man.\n(A number of men's photographs were now placed in a\nrow before her : she immediately pounced on one\nwithout the slightest hesitation.)\nThat is the man I saw. I saw him. That is the man I\nsaw. I saw him up there : such a nice face. I could\nsee him. I could see Mr. Hodgson pushing him up to\nthe front.\n[The selection was correct; the photograph was one of the\nperson she calls Joe, i.e. of the late Mr. Joseph Marble.]\nSequel to No. 14 an hour or so later.\nA sitting, was it not? Perhaps my going to London was a\ngood thing for me.\nWhen Mrs. Sidgwick said she was glad, I was very much\nastonished, because she does not say anything at all.\nMr. Piddington told me he was a medium too.\n(I now again put the photographs in front of her. She\nlooked at them as if for the first time, and said)\nI do not know the photographs.\n(She then hesitated long over the right one, saying she had\n'seen him somewhere,' but finished up by saying)\nNo, I do not know.\nComment.\nThe result of this experiment, with other experiences relating to\nthe description of the personal appearance of a person spoken of\nin the trance, has satisfied me that \u2014whatever may be the cause\na visual likeness of the people supposed to be communicating in\nthe trance is sometimes really impressed at the time upon the\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter VIII. 279\nsubconscious mind of Mrs. Piper. A veridical dream impression\nseems to be caused in these cases; but like other dream impressions\nit fades. The visual impression is merely an extension of the\nimpression of character and of speech, which is also impressed upon\nthe same stratum of her subconsciousness, and is of a similarly\nevanescent character.\nDuring trance undoubtedly her subconsciousness is thus, at least\noccasionally, in touch with a simulacrum or hallucinatory representa-\ntion of a deceased person, \u2014whatever be the cause\u2014a telepathic\nimpression received from the sitter perhaps, or as appears more\nlikely, from the surviving influence of the deceased person.\nThat much is certain; and to deny that, is merely to refuse to\nbe informed by facts of experience. But of what nature this\nevanescent but for a time vivid impression of appearance and character\nand personality really is, is a more difficult question, on which at\npresent I do not feel competent to express an opinion. For what\nit is worth, however, my instinct leads me to judge that it is not\nsolely due to a telepathic impulse from the sitter\u2014in spite of the\nfact that the sympathy and understanding of the sitter is a great\nhelp, and indeed a determining cause why one set of impressions is\nproduced and not a totally different set. Undoubtedly the existence\nof real interest and affection on the part of a person present is the\nawakening cause of any particular veridical impression. It is that\nwhich determines the selection out of the infinite multitude of other\nimpressions which otherwise might equally well be produced. But\nalthough sympathy of this kind is the selective and determining\ncause, I do not feel that it is the creative or constructive cause.\nIt appears to me that there is an agency or energy lying ready,\nwhich is capable of arousing in the subconsciousness of an entranced\nperson, or of persons endowed with automatic faculty, a vast multi-\ntude of impressions\u2014good bad and indifferent; and that out of this\nmultitude of possible impressions some are selected with more or\nless discrimination as appropriate to a particular case, \u2014the presence\nof a sitter being the detent or trigger which liberates or guides the\nenergy in one direction and not in another.\nEnd of the present report on the Joseph Marble series.\n\f280 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nCHAPTER IX.\nSUPPLEMENTARY REMARKS.\nPhinuit.\nIt was of some interest to me to see what the Controls of recent\ntimes had to say about the ancient Control calling itself Phinuit\nand accordingly I asked questions in Sitting No. 11, of which the\nrecord stands as follows :\n0. J. L. May I ask a question ? Does '\nPhinuit ' mean anything to\nyou 1\nYou mean Dr. Phinuit. Oh yes, we see him occasionally,\nfriend ; he is in another sphere of this life, no longer\nearth-bound, and he is very well and very happy.\n0. J. L. He was a friend of mine. [By this I meant that during the\nold Piper sittings I was on friendly and even affectionate\nterms with this curious and not universally appreciated\nimpersonator.]\nCould you by any possibility be the friend on earth whom\nhe called '\nCaptain ' ?\n0. J. L. Yes indeed, that is me.\n(Excitement in hand.)\nWould you like to see and speak with him 1\n0. J. L. I should if it did him no harm.\nOh no harm in the least ; he is beyond harm, friend ; he\nhas so progressed. He will no doubt be glad to return.\nWe will speak with him and report his doings. This\nalso.\n0. J. L. Will you give him my love 1\nI will give him your love certainly with great pleasure.\nHe is a much better spirit than he was thought to have\nbeen. He fell in with the wrong element to begin with.\nU.D. Wrong i.e. on the earthly side. I will see him\nand report at our next meeting. R.\n\flviii ] On Trance Communications, Chapter IX. 281\nAnd at the next sitting at which I was present the following\ncame :\nWe found Phinuit, and gave him your message. He sends\nhis love in return and says if you would like to speak\nwith him, really, he would endeavour to return to you\nthrough the light at our next meeting ; and he says\nhe remembers you and your companion\u2014with deepest\naffection and appreciation of his anxious efforts to tell\nof our world and its inhabitants \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n0. J. L. Well, I do not know that it would be good for the machine\nto ask him to return ; moreover I am not sure that we\nshall have another sitting here.\nYou must speak to + about his returning next time through\nthe voice, which he would be glad to do himself. U.D.\nR.\n0. J. L. Please thank him, but I do not know that there is any\nobject in getting him to speak.\nOh yes. Well friend, we were about to say that he, Dr.\nPhinuit is not in the least anxious to return to earth\nagain, as he had quite enough while he was there.\n0. J. L. Very well then, please remember me to him kindly.\nYes, we certainly will do so.\nI don't know whether it was wise thus to discourage a temporary\nreturn of Phinuit. The fact is, I felt it to be rather too much of a\nresponsibility to interfere with the conditions of control ;\nespecially as\nthe entry of Phinuit, in past times, had been usually accompanied\nwith contortions and some slight apparent discomfort. Tiie oncoming\nof the trance is now-a-days so placid that I thought it best to leave\nwell alone ; but I confess that it would have been interesting to see\nwhether the Phinuit personality would have reappeared, with all its\noriginal peculiarities unchanged.\nConcluding Observations.\nI have not reported all the sittings at which I was present\u2014it\nwould be tedious to do so. Those held with Prof. Muirhead are\nomitted because they were not specially good, and it is a tax upon\nthe reader to introduce him unnecessarily to a further set of relatives.\n\f282 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nThe controls did not treat him from the Professorial point of view,\nbut from the domestic, just as they used to in the Phinuit days.\nI need hardly point out how much more easy it would be to \"get\nup \" Professorial details than obscure family incidents. Those how-\never are what are still attended to : so every series of sittings with\na stranger involves trouble analogous to that which must be taken\nwhen beginning to read a new novel ; and unless the novel is fairly\ngood, the trouble is not worth while.\nThe sittings omitted do not appear to me to throw any additional\nlight upon the procedure ; and the question arises\u2014what is the\noutcome of it all, so far as my own impression of the above series\nof facts is concerned.\nOn the whole, they tend to render certain the existence of some\noutside intelligence or control, distinct from the consciousness, and\nas far as I can judge from the subconsciousness also, of Mrs. Piper\nor other medium. And they tend to render probable the working-\nhypothesis, on which I choose to proceed, that that version of the\nnature of the intelligences which they themselves present and favour\nis something like the truth. In other words I feel that we are in\nsecondary or tertiary touch\u2014at least occasionally\u2014with some stratum\nof the surviving personality of the individuals who are represented\nas sending messages.\nI call the touch secondary, because it is always through the medium\nand not direct; and I call it generally tertiary, because it represents\nitself as nearly always operating through an agency or medium on\nthat side also\u2014an agency which calls itself 'Rector' or 'Phinuit.'\nThat these latter impersonations are really themselves individuals I\ndo not venture either to assert or deny ; but it is difficult or impossible\nto bring them to book, and an examination of their nature may be\ndeferred : it is the impersonation of verifiable or terrestrially known\nindividuals to which it behoves us in the first instance to pay\nattention.\nVery well then, I feel bound to say that in the old days when\nconversing with the Gurney control through Mrs. Piper, as reported\nin Chapter II., I felt very much as if I were conversing under diffi-\nculties with Edmund Gurney. And he appeared to be in real '\ncontrol\nfor the time\u2014so that lapses and uncertainties and occasional con-\nfusions, in his case, were rather rare.\nBut when the Myers and Hodgson controls now send messages\nthrough Mrs. Piper, as above reported, I have very little feeling of\nthat kind. They seemed in my case rather shadowy, and so to\n\flviil] On Trance Communications, Chapter IX. 283\nspeak uninteresting, communicators. It is true I did not give them\nmuch chance or encouragement, and under better treatment they\nflourished and blossomed as reported by Mr. Piddington ; but if my\nopinion had to depend on my own Piper sittings alone, I should not\nbe strongly impressed by these personalities.\nWhen '\nIsaac Thompson ' was the communicator, however, I was\nfavourably impressed on the whole, and consider that this part of\nthe record strengthens rather than weakens the case not only for\nsurvival but for intelligent and affectionate intercourse. In particular\nI think that the sitting reported by Dr. Hodgson from America,\nwhen '\nIsaac Thompson ' appeared on the scene after his son had left\nfor England, was sjaecially good and dramatic (pp. 166, 7).\nThe \"Myers\" utterances which have impressed me most were those\nobtained at two sittings with Mrs. Thompson (then of Hampstead)\nsoon after his decease, \u2014as reported above in somewhat abbreviated\nform, in Chapter IV., which is perhaps one of the most notable\nportions of this whole document. It is of course to be admitted\nthat few things\u2014perhaps nothing\u2014obtained through a medium so\nwell acquainted with Mr. Myers as Mrs. Thompson was can be\nregarded as strictly evidential ;\nbut, in spite of that, the dramatic\nverisimilitude was very marked\u2014especially in some of the omitted\nfragments.\nThere remains the Mrs. Grove case, at some of which I was present.\nThis series, for several reasons, must be regarded as the most strictly\nevidential of all ; and a decided unity of character and of message\nis preserved, no matter through what medium the communication\ncomes. But the hypothesis of telepathy from the sitter, if stretched\nsufficiently, will cover all the reported portions : and in such a case\nthis notion constitutes a difficulty which can hardly be avoided.\nAt the same time I must say that I find this hypothesis not very\nprobable, \u2014it does not at all satisfy my mind as an explanation. On\nthe whole the surviving and communicating intelligence hypothesis\ncommends itself to me as the most likely.\nReaders who happen to know that I myself am convinced of the\nfact of the survival of human personality beyond bodily death may\nbe surprised at this critical attitude, since they may think such an\nattitude inconsistent with that belief. But the main question before\nus is whether the additional evidence now adduced strengthens the\nprevious verdict in favour of the possibility of conscious communi-\ncation. It is not easy to strengthen it, because it was already-\nstrong.\n\f284 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nA careful analysis and examination of the facts both for and against\nthe genuine activity of deceased communicators has been made by\nDr. Hodgson, and will be found in his Report in Proc. Vol. 13,\npages 357-412. He is led distinctly to countenance, and indeed to\nchampion, a cautious and discriminating form of spiritistic theory,\nnot as a working hypothesis only, but as truly representing part of\nthe facts. His experience was so large, and his critical faculty so\nawake, that such a conclusion of his is entitled to the gravest con-\nsideration. If I had to pronounce a prematurely decided opinion,\nmy own view would agree with his.\nThe old series of sittings with Mrs. Piper convinced me of survival,\nfor reasons which I should find it hard to formulate in any strict\nfashion, but that was their distinct effect. They also made me\nsuspect\u2014or more than suspect\u2014that surviving intelligences were in\nsome cases consciously communicating, \u2014 r\nes in some few cases con-\nsciously ;\nthough more usually the messages came in all probability\nfrom an unconscious stratum, being received by the medium in an\ninspirational manner analogous to psychometry.\nThis Report's usefulness, if it has any, must chiefly lie in the\nadditional information to be gleaned from it regarding the process\nand the difficulties of conscious inter-communion between our own\nminds and whatever stratum of consciousness is operating on them\nfrom the other side. The hypothesis of surviving intelligence and\npersonality, \u2014not only surviving but anxious and able with difficulty\nto communicate, \u2014is the simplest and most straightforward, and the\nonly one that fits all the facts. But the process of communication\nis sophisticated by many influences, so that it is very difficult,\nperhaps at present impossible, to disentangle and exhibit clearly the\npart that each plays.\nOne thing that conspicuously suggests itself is that we are here\nmade aware, through these trivial but illuminating facts, of a process\nwhich by religious people has always been recognised and insisted\non, namely the direct interaction of incarnate with discarnate mind,\nthat is to say, an intercourse between mind and mind in more\nthan one grade of existence, by means apart from, and independent\nof, the temporary mechanism of the body.\nThe facts indeed open the way to a perception of the influence of\nspirit generally, as a guiding force in human and terrestrial affairs,\nactive not under the exceptional circumstances of trance alone, but\nalways and constantly and normally, \u2014so uniformly active in fact\nthat by ordinary people its agency is undetected and unperceived.\n\flviii.] On Trance Communications, Chapter IX. 285\nMost people are far too busy to attend : they are too thoroughly\noccupied with what for the time are certainly extremely important\naffairs. A race of inspired people would be hopelessly unpractical,\nthough Society is usually grateful for the existence and utterance of\na few individuals of this type.\nThe fact that these communications are obtained through sub-\nconscious agency is sometimes held to militate against their importance\nas a subject of study. But have not men of genius sometimes testi-\nfied that brilliant ideas do surge up into their consciousness from\nsome submerged stratum, at a time when they are incompletely\nawake to the things of this world\n1\n? And ordinary people are aware\nthat a brown study favours the conscious reception of something\npresumably akin to inspiration, by relegating ordinary experience to\nthe background, and thereby enabling new and unfamiliar ideas to\nenter or germinate in the mind.\nA trance, or any state of complete unconsciousness, renders the\nnormal though obscure activity of an unfamiliar psychical region\nstill more manifest. Not indeed to the patient, \u2014who is unaware of\nthe whole phenomenon, or remembers it only after the indistinct and\ntemporary fashion of a dream, \u2014but to an observer or experimenter,\nwho is allowed to enlarge his experience and to receive impressions\nby deputy ;\nthereby attaining, at second hand, some of the privileges\nof intuition or clairvoyance, or even of genius, while he himself\nremains in an ordinary and businesslike condition. His experience\nin fact may be regarded as an undeserved, and therefore only\nmoderately valuable, kind of vicarious inspiration.\n\f286 Professor A. C. Pigou, [part\nIV.\nPSYCHICAL RESEARCH AND SURVIVAL AFTER\nBODILY DEATH.\nBy Professor A. C. Pigou.\n1. The question whether men and women survive bodily\ndeath contains three ambiguities. There is ambiguity in the\nterm survive ;\nambiguity in the term man or woman ; and\nambiguity in the use of the plural \" men and women.\"\nThe ambiguity connected with \" survive \" is philosophical.\nIf any one asks whether cats survive immersion in water, it\ndoes not occur to us to bring to bear on that problem a\nmetaphysical discussion concerning the reality of time ; we\nassume, in fact, that time is real, and we mean by \" surviving\nimmersion \" being alive after immersion. When, however, our\nquestion relates to men and women and bodily death the\nidealist philosopher enters the arena and claims that time,\nwith all that therein is, is a purely subjective condition of\nhuman perception ; that in reality there is no after and no\nbefore ; that survival and death alike are appearance ; that\nmen and women, as spirit, neither survive nor die, but in\nsome sense eternally are. This doctrine I do not propose to\ndiscuss here. To any one who accepts it the question of\nsurvival in the ordinary sense must seem trivial, if not mean-\ningless. For my own part, I provisionally hold the opinion\nthat time is real, and I address this paper only to persons\nwho share that view.\nThe second ambiguity in our question concerns the term\nman or woman. In ordinary life this term carries with it an\nidea of physical bodies. From the present standpoint it is\nobvious that that idea must be eliminated. The thing about\nwhich debate should turn is, I suppose, what we somewhat\nvaguely term the conscious mind. But what, for our purpose,\n\flviil] Psychical Research and Survival. 287\nis this entity ? When we ask whether a seed survives burning,\nthe answer may be different according as seed is understood\nto mean, on the one hand, a mere quantity of matter or, on the\nother hand, matter in a special form with special properties.\nWe are in the same difficulty with regard to \" conscious mind.\"\nThe idea of absorption of the individual consciousness into a\nlarger Whole, and its survival somehow in the Whole, is no\nless familiar than that of personal survival. This complication\nis the more serious, at least for me, on account of my complete\ninability to grasp or understand the notion of absorption of\none conscious mind into another, I do not, however, wish to\ndebate this complication. Perhaps for the present purpose we\nmay so far compromise as to say that conscious mind survives\nif, after the death of a person, there is added to the Whole,\nwhether absorbed in it or not, a conscious mind that has some\nsort of continuity in memory and quality with the person who\nhas died. I am quite aware that this is exceedingly unsatis-\nfactory and vague, but the difficulty seems to be inherent in\nthe subject.\nThe remaining ambiguity, that involved in the use of the\nplural, \" men and women,\" is obvious. \" Men and women \" may\nmean either \" all men and women \" or \" any men and women.\"\nIt seems to me plain that psychical research can never give\na direct answer to the question whether all men and women\nsurvive death. A proof that some survive would give but\nslight warrant for the wider thesis. In what follows, there-\nfore, I shall understand by \" men and women \" \" any men and\nwomen.\" Do any men and women survive bodily death ?\n\u00a7 2. The question thus framed and limited is believed by\nsome persons to be answered affirmatively by an appeal to\nrevelation or to the beneficence of God. In like manner it is\nbelieved by other persons to be answered negatively by legiti-\nmate inference from the science of physiology. I am not\nmyself able to accept either of these lines of argument. The\nquestion of survival seems to me to be on a par with the\nquestion whether some entity that we are able to conceive\nexists in fact in the real world. The answer to this cannot\nbe found by a priori but only by a posteriori study : it is a\nmatter of evidence and probabilities of the sort commonly\ninvestigated by science.\n\f288 Professor A. G. Pigou. [part\n\u00a7 3. In recent publications of the Society for Psychical\nResearch there is material that, in the opinion of several com-\npetent persons, makes it probable that Frederic Myers, Henry\nSidgwick, and others have, in some sense, survived bodily\ndeath. This material it is the business of my paper to\nexamine. Before, however, that task is attempted, it is\nnecessary to see, so far as we can, how the problem stands\napart from this new evidence. Let us suppose\u2014what is\napproximately the case\u2014that, apart from these data, there\nis no direct evidence whatever for the survival of any\ndead man or woman. Should we, in that case, say that\nit is an even chance whether people survive or not, or\nthat survival is exceedingly improbable, or that there is no\ndeterminate probability about the matter\u2014no alleviation what-\never to our ignorance ? I have no confident opinion on this\ndifficult point. The interdependence of mind and brain in\nlife as we know it does not, of course, logically imply that\nthe two perish together, but it does, as it seems to me, make\nthat event in some small measure probable. On the strength\nof this\u2014the one relevant fact in our deep ignorance,\u2014I am\ninclined to say that initially, and apart from the new evidence,\nsurvival is somewhat improbable. The hypotheses of survival\nand of non-survival do not start exactly on a level : the scales\nare inclined in favour of the latter.\n\u00a7 4. The evidence that psychical research has to offer is\nof two sorts : first, the provision of information unknown to\nany living person, but known to some person who is dead\nsecondly, the performance of some act not easily explained as\nthe result of the agency of living persons, and claiming to be\ndue to a dead person. Of these two sorts of evidence the\nformer is at present practically non-existent. The tests pre-\npared by means of sealed envelopes have not been successful\nthere is nothing substantial enough to afford the basis for an\nargument. With the second sort of evidence, however, the\ncase is different. It again may conveniently be separated\nunder two heads : first, the impression of individuality con-\nveyed, to those who knew Myers and the other alleged controls\nwhen alive, by the general form and content of the automatic\nspeech and script claiming to come from them ;\nsecondly, the\ncross-correspondences recently discovered between the script of\n\fLVIII.] Psychical Research and Survival. 289\nvarious automatists. The former sort of evidence I shall not\nconsider here. What I have to say refers exclusively to the\nlatter.\n'\n\u00a7 5. The three volumes of the Society's Proceedings which\ndeal with the automatic writing produced by Mrs. Holland,\nMrs. Verrall, and Mrs. Piper under the alleged influence of\nvarious discarnate intelligences make a case for survival that\nis prima facie sufficiently strong to warrant careful study. The\nphenomena observed consist mainly of cross-correspondences\nbetween the contents of the scripts of two or more automatists\n\u2014cross-correspondences announced in the script themselves and\nclaiming to be the deliberate work of Myers, \" Talbot Forbes,\"\nor some other \" control.\" The cross-correspondences that have\nbeen discovered may be divided, according to Mr. Gerald\nBalfour's nomenclature, into two groups, simple correspondences\nand complementary correspondences.\n1\nAn ideal simple corre-\nspondence would occur if an idea given through one automatist\nwere transferred directly to another : an ideal complementary\ncorrespondence if ideas unmeaning individually, but significant\nin combination, were given through several automatists. In\nthe concrete, o'f course, it may not always be easy to decide\nwith which of these two groups any assigned correspondence\nshould be classed. In the opinion, however, of Miss Johnson\nand other investigators there is a fair number of cases that are\nnot marginal, but can be labelled definitely as belonging to\nthe one or the other kind.\n\u00a7 6. The question whether the facts that have been obtained\nmake it probable that Myers and the others really survive\nbreaks up naturally into three parts : first, we have to\ndecide how probable it is that there is any common cause\noperating on the different scripts and responsible for their\ncorrespondences ;\nsecondly, if there is such a cause, how prob-\nable it is that this cause is some discarnate mind ;\nthirdly,\nif the cause is some discarnate mind, how probable it is that\nit is the mind of that deceased person with whom it claims\nto be identical. These questions I shall discuss in order.\n\u00a7 7. First : suppose that there are two novels written by\ntwo different people. Three things are possible : the plot\nand the language of each may have been fashioned by causes\n1\nThe Hibbert Journal, Jan. 1909, p. 247.\nT\n\f290 Professor A. C. Pigou. [part\nentirely independent of one another : they may have been\nfashioned by some independent and some common causes ; or\nthey may have been fashioned entirely by common causes.\nLet us imagine that the two novels are identical throughout\nword for word. We should then reason in this way : if\nthey have been fashioned by independent causes, this result\nis extremely improbable. Hence, unless the existence of a\ncommon cause is also extraordinarily improbable a priori,\nsuch a cause has almost certainly been at work. The proba-\nbility of this conclusion is not, except in a special case,\nmeasured by the improbability of the correspondence arising\nunder a regime of independent causes ; for its magnitude is\naffected by the a priori probability of the existence of a\ncommon cause. Still, in such a case as I have supposed,\neverybody would judge, and that rightly, that there was\nalmost certainly a common cause in operation. The problem\nis, however, more complicated in the concrete. Let us imagine\nthat the novels are not identical, but have some measure of\nresemblance. We know that there are some common causes\naffecting contemporary novelists in the same country :\n\u2014they\nspeak the same language ;\nthey live in the same atmosphere ;\nthey move among the same events ;\n\u2014and we wish to know\nwhether the resemblance is sufficient to make it probable that\nany further common cause has been at work. To such a\nproblem no precise answer can be given in general terms\nwe have to balance up in our minds the degree of observed\nresemblance, the importance of the known common causes,\nand the a priori probability of the existence of an unknown\ncommon cause, and having clone this, to judge as best we\nmay. This is the class of problem presented by the corre-\nsponding scripts of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Piper, and Mrs. Holland:\n\u2014is the measure of correspondence sufficient to make probable\nthe operation of some common cause over and above that\nprovided by similarity of environment and interests ? This is\na cpuestion which everybody must answer for himself after a\nstudy of the scripts. Personally, I agree with the judgment\nformed by practically all those who have investigated the\nmatter, that the presence of some special common cause is\nprobable in a fairly high degree\u2014the sort of degree in which\nI should judge it to be probable that there was a common\n\fLYIII.] Psychical Research and Survival. 291\nsource to which both St. Luke and St. Matthew had access\nin writing their gospels.\n| 8. If so much be granted, we have next to ask how\nprobable it is that this assumed common cause is the influ-\nence of a discarnate mind. I shall simplify the problem by\nexcluding at once the hypothesis of conscious fraud or collusion\nbetween the various automatists concerned. This hypothesis is\nnot, of course, impossible, but it is (as I think) iu view of\nall the circumstances, so improbable as not to deserve serious\nconsideration. We are, therefore, left with the alternative\nhypotheses of the influence through some supernormal channel\nof an incarnate mind or of the influence of a discarnate mind.\nIt is not permitted, be it observed, at this point to turn round\nand declare that both these hypotheses are grotesque and im-\npossible. Anybody who takes that view must have parted\ncompany with me earlier. If collusion and fraud are ruled\nout, to concede that some common cause is probable is prac-\ntically equivalent to conceding that one of these causes is\nprobable. What we have to do, therefore, is simply to consider\nthe relative probability of supernormal incarnate and of dis-\ncarnate agency.\n\u00a7 9. At this point we are confronted directly with a logical\ndifficulty that has long been haunting the discussion. When\nwe have to judge whether it is more probable that our gyp\nor our bedmaker's son is responsible for the abstraction of\ncigarettes, we in general start fair. We know that they are\nboth agencies who might have performed the deed. But imagine\nthis case. Suppose it to be certain that the cigarettes were\ntaken either by the gyp or by the son of our bedmaker, but\nthat it is a priori somewhat improbable that our bedmaker has\na son. Suppose, furthermore, that our cigarettes are so care-\nfully concealed and our gyp is of such mean intelligence that\nit is a priori very improbable he could discover them. In\nsuch a case as that, how are we to determine the relative\nfinal probability that our bedmaker has a son who took the\ncigarettes or that our gyp took them ? That problem\u2014it has\nits parallel in the speculations of physical science\u2014is closely\nanalogous to the one with which we are now dealing. The\nsubliminal self corresponds to the gyp : a discarnate intelli-\ngence, Myers or another, to the hypothetical bedmaker's son.\n\f292 Professor A. C. Pigou. [part\nThe argument in favour of the discarnate intelligence endeavours\nto show that the subliminal consciousness is not sufficiently\ncompetent to bring about the effect that has in fact occurred.\nIn such a discussion it seems almost impossible to lay down\nany canons of judgment. The gyp, since we know him to\nexist, has some initial advantage ; the bedmaker's son may not\nexist at all, and, if he does exist, may, for all we know, be\neven less intelligent than the gyp, and less competent than he\nto discover where the cigarettes are concealed. On the other\nhand, a bedmaker's son, particularly a bedmaker's discarnate\nson, may possess powers of discovery and abstraction undreamt\nof in a gyp's philosophy. The only conclusion to which I can\ncome is that, if the problem is presented in the general form\nin which I have stated it, no solution can be found.\n\u00a7 10. The actual problem which the new facts published by\nthe Psychical Research Society present does not, however,\nseem to me so difficult as this. If the abstraction of cigarettes\nfrom places similar to that in which I had concealed mine\ncould be shown to be an act of the same class as many acts\nwhich my gyp was known to perform, I should conclude at\nonce that he was the probable culprit, and should certainly\nnot, on the evidence, suspend judgment between him and a\nhypothetical and a priori somewhat improbable bedmaker's\nson. In like manner, if the subliminal consciousness can be\nshown to be responsible for the same class of phenomena as\nthese recent correspondences, it is, and should be judged, the\nprobable cause of them also. This conclusion would be in\nconformity with the recognised methods of science, and is, I\nthink, logically correct. The new arguments for survival\ndepend largely upon the thesis that the correspondences which\nhave recently occurred are not paralleled by any known\noperations of the subliminal self. If the thesis is incorrect,\nthe argument dissolves. I propose to contest the thesis.\n8 11. Simple correspondences between the impressions of two\nautomatists are well known to occur under conditions which\nmake it probable that the agent is the subliminal conscious-\nness of one of the persons concerned. If proof of this is\nrecpuired, I may cite the experiments recently conducted at a\ndistance, sometimes of 20, and sometimes of 400 miles between\nMiss Eamsden and Miss Miles. The experiments were not\n\fLVIII.] Psychical Research and Survival. 293\nconcerned with automatic writing, but consisted in attempts\non the part of Miss Miles to transfer impressions of objects\nto Miss Eamsden, Miss Miles arranging to concentrate atten-\ntion on some object, and Miss Eamsden to sit for impressions\nat times previously arranged. Had it merely happened that\nthis experiment partially succeeded in its direct object, that\ncircumstance would not perhaps have much bearing on our\npresent discussion. Curiously enough, however, as Miss Eams-\nden has observed, \" those (impressions) which are the most\nsurprisingly correct are some which were not intentionally\ntransferred at all.\"\n1\nMiss Eamsden's impression would refer to\nsomething that had happened to Miss Miles in the course of\nthe day, and not to the object of which she sought to transfer\na picture at the time of the sitting. This circumstance seems\nto me to show that the subliminal self of one person is\nsometimes capable of influencing the perceptions of another\napart from conscious will. Hence, the subliminal self of, say,\nMrs. Verrall, could probably bring about a simple correspond-\nence between her automatic script and that of some other\nscribe. In explaining the simple correspondences that have\noccurred by the hypothesis that this is what has in fact\nhappened, we should not need to assign to the subliminal self\nany powers beyond those which we already have strong reason\nto believe that it sometimes possesses. If, therefore, we had\nto do only with simple correspondences, the proper conclusion,\nas I have already indicated, would be that the subliminal self\nof one of the automatists was probably responsible. The fact\nthat the correspondences are claimed in the scripts themselves\nto be the work of discarnate intelligences is, in view of the\nfrequency with which the subliminal consciousness is known to\nimpersonate real or imaginary people, quite inadequate to rebut\nthis conclusion.\n\u00a7 12. It is by no means my intention to suggest that\nthose who have been responsible for the recent investigations\nhave ignored this consideration. On the contrary, they have\nfully realized its importance, and, because they have realized\nthis, have laid very little stress upon cases of simple cor-\nrespondence. The weakness of such cases as evidence of the\naction of a discarnate mind is explicitly admitted by Miss\n,\n1\nProceedings, Yol. XXL, pp. 92-3.\n\f294 Professor A. C. Pigou. [part\nJohnson in her report on The automatic writing of Mrs. Holland.\n\" If,\" she writes, \" we simply find the same idea expressed\neven though in different forms\u2014by both [of two automatists]\nit may most easily be explained by telepathy between them\"; 1\u2014\nor, as I should prefer to put it, by the agency of the sub-\nliminal self of one or both of them. The cases which, in the\nview of Miss Johnson, Mr. Piddington, and others, do possess\nevidential value are cases, not of simple, but of complemen-\ntary correspondences. \" The characteristic of these cases,\" Miss\nJohnson writes, \" or at least of some of them, is that we do\nnot get in the writing of one automatist anything like a\nmechanical verbatim reproduction of phrases in the other ; we\ndo not even get the same idea expressed in different ways. . . .\nWhat we get is a fragmentary utterance in one script, which\nseems to have no particular point or meaning, and another\nfragmentary utterance in the other, of an ecjually pointless\ncharacter ; but when we put the two together, we see that\nthey supplement one another, and that there is apparently one\ncoherent idea underlying both, but only partially expressed in\neach.\"\n\"\n2\nThe question whether the production of those cor-\nrespondences of this class which have hitherto been recorded\nis outside the powers that we know in other ways sometimes\nto belong to the subliminal self cannot be answered so easily\nas the analogous question concerning simple correspondences.\nNevertheless, it can (as I think) be answered quite decidedly\nin the negative.\n\u00a7 13. In the discussion of this problem there is some\ndanger of confusion between the two questions, (1) whether\nthe complementariness in complementary correspondences is\nintentional, and (2) to what agent the correspondences are\nprobably due. The logical connection between these questions\nseems to me to be as follows. If it can be shown that the\ncomplementariness in any particular complementary correspon-\ndence is probably the result not of intention but of accident,\nthe correspondence in question must be regarded, when we\ncome to investigate the probable agent, as equivalent to a\nsimple correspondence. The manufacture of simple correspon-\ndences does not, however, as has already been argued, lie\noutside the known powers of the subliminal consciousness.\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XXL, p. 375. -Ibid., p. 375.\n\fLVIII.] Psychical Research and Survival. 295\nTherefore, to show that intention is probably absent in any\nset of complementary correspondences is equivalent to showing\nthat the manufacture of these correspondences does not lie\noutside the said known powers. This sort of reasoning affords,\nI think, a convenient method of eliminating from the dis-\ncussion a number of complementary correspondences in which\nthe element of complementariness is small. It is a characteristic\nof thought-transference that the percipient often fails to get\nthe word which the agent is endeavouring to transfer by a\ndirect process. Something like the idea embodied in the word\nmay come first, or something like the sound embodied in it,\nor something connected somehow with either the idea or the\nsound. In Miss Kamsden-s and Miss Miles's experiments\nthere are two cases of this sort. On one occasion, when\nMiss Miles attempted to transfer Sphinx, Miss Ramsdeu\nobtained, among other things, Luxor in Egypt 1\non another\noccasion when Bishop was the object of the experiment,\nMiss Eamsdeu concluded in sequence \" latme, Bishop Latimer,\nArchbishop.\" 2\nThe same characteristic is observable in\nnumerous cases recorded in Mr. Piddington's study of Mrs.\nPiper, where the controls undertake to transfer a particular\nword from Mrs. Piper to Mrs. Verrall. The word is not\ngiven directly, but there is an evident groping towards it,\n\u2022attempts to get at it now along the route of sound, now\nalong that of sense. In view of this quality in\nthought-transference we are entitled to claim that, if the\nsubliminal self of, say, Mrs. Verrall, were trying to impress\nany given idea upon the automatic script both of Mrs.\nVerrall herself and of some other automatist, the correspon-\ndences actually achieved would often not be exact. The two\nscripts would, indeed, be orientated about the same idea\nbut they would be very far from identical. If we compare\nthe word aimed at to the bull of a target, it is in a high\ndegree probable that attempts to hit the bull would result\nin shots scattered widely round it. In other words, mildly\ncomplementary correspondences are likely to result from\nattempts at simple correspondences. The complementariness is\nprobably not intentional, and its presence has no significance.\n\u00a714. I do not myself feel, however, when we come to\nProceedings, Vol. XXI., p. 62. 2\nIbid., p. 75.\n\f296 Professor A. G. Pigou. [part\nmore complicated cases, that this roundabout method of\napproach is the best. The question of intention is a\nsecondary one. A more satisfactory method, as it seems to\nme, is to leave it aside altogether and to ask quite directly\n\" Do the complementary correspondences, the authorship of\nwhich is now under investigation, differ in any marked\ndegree from other complementary correspondences that we\nhave grounds for attributing to subliminal agency ?\n\" This is\nall that we need : for, if the answer is in the negative, we\nknow, without delving behind the facts for explaining intentions,,\nthat the phenomena we are studying fall within the capacity\nof subliminal agents, and, therefore, on the principles here\nadopted, are probably due to them.\nIn order to a perfect application of this test, two con-\nditions would be necessary, one of which, from the nature of the\ncase, cannot be attained, while the other has not, as a matter\nof fact, been attained hitherto. The first condition is that we\nshould know for certain that no discarnate intelligence had\na hand in those complementary correspondences which we\nattribute to subliminal agency and use as a standard of com-\nparison for the others. Now, it is evident that we can never\nknow this for certain. In the case, to which I shall allude\npresently, in which Dr. Verrall endeavoured to impress three-\nGreek words upon Mrs. Verrall's script, it is jwssiMe that the\ndiscarnate intelligence of Dr. A. T. Myers took part in the\nexperiment, and that, but for his co-operation, the complement-\nariness that occurred between the different scripts would not\nhave come about. This is, no doubt, possible. I do not,\nhowever, attach much importance to such suggestions. We\nknow that Dr. Verrall's subliminal consciousness and Mrs..\nVerrall's subliminal consciousness were agents ; we have no\nevidential ground for believing that Dr. Myers was an agent\nat all, or that, if an agent, he was likely to be responsible\nfor the complementary element in the scripts. I hold, there-\nfore, that, on the evidence, the complementariness that emerged\nshould be assigned, with a high measure of probability, to the\naction of the incarnate subliminal intelligences which we know\nto have been at work, and that the bare possibility of co-\noperation \" from the other side \" is not of material significance.\nThe second condition required to make our test perfect is\n\flviil] Psychical Research and Survival. 297\nthat the coroplementariness which we have grounds for attri-\nbuting to subliminal action should occur between the scripts\nof different automatists. If we had cases in which someone\nattempted to impress the same idea upon several different\nwriters, the records of such cases would constitute an excellent\nstandard with which to compare those complementary corre-\nspondences that claim to flow from a discarnate mind. Un-\nfortunately, however, though experiments of this kind no doubt\nwill be, they have not yet been, made. The best case that\nis available for our purpose is one in which the complement-\nariness which occurs is between different scripts of the same-\nautomatist. I grant that the use of this case leaves room for\nthe reply that the essential peculiarity of the Holland-Piper-\nVerrall cross-correspondences is just the fact that it is between\nthe scripts of different automatists that complementariness occurs.\nSuch a reply, however, seems unsound. If the subliminal con-\nsciousness can produce complementariness between the different\nscripts of one automatist, that seems to me to give strong\nground for holding that it can produce at least an equal\nmeasure of complementariness between the scripts of different\nautomatists. Indeed, if the complementariness arises in any\nmeasure out of a succession of attempts, that fall short of\nsuccess in different ways, to bring some single idea to the\nsurface, we should expect a 'priori somewhat greater diversity\nand more recondite complementariness when the attempts are\nmade through several persons of different characteristics and\nenvironment than when they are made through one person\nonly. Hence, though experiments with several automatists of\nthe kind suggested above are much to be desired, it would\nseem that, meanwhile, the use, as a standard of comparison,,\nof Dr. Verrall's experiment with one automatist is thoroughly\nwell warranted. In short, the absence of the two conditions\nthat I showed to be required in order to make our test perfect\ndoes not prevent that test from being very good.\n,\n\u00a715. This then is the test proposed. In Mrs. Verrall's paper\nupon her own automatic writing, published in October, 1906,\nthere is an account of an attempt made by Dr. Verrall to\ntransfer telepathically to her automatic script the three Greek\nwords fxovoirwkov k aw, \" to the one-horse dawn,\" a phrase\nconnected with an incident of his undergraduate clays about,\n\f298 '\nProfessor A. 0. Pigou. [part\nthirty years before. 1\nThe result of this experiment is traced\nby Mrs. Verrall in her script for six months following. We\nthus have a series of attempts\u2014or, at least, it is extremely\nprobable that we have\u2014by the subliminal self of one or both of\nthe persons concerned to reproduce a single definite idea in\nthe script of one automatist. The test which I propose to\napply to Mr. Piddington's and Miss Johnson's records is to\nsee whether the degree of complementariness in the corre-\nspondences found in them is in any decided way more striking\nthan that which appears in the different efforts of Mrs.\nVerrall's script to produce Dr. Verrall's words. If there is\nno decided difference it seems to me that the Holland- Piper-\nVerrall cross-correspondences are also probably the result of\nsubliminal activities. I will first set out two cases of cross-\ncorrespondences from Miss Johnson's and Mr. Piddington's\nrecords, and will then make an analysis, on the same plan as\ntheirs, of Mrs. Verrall's attempts at Dr. Verrall's Greek words.\nThe first case I shall take is that called in the records Ave\nRoma Immortalis. The reason I take it is that Miss Johnson\nwrites in regard to it\n\"\n' Ave Eoma Immortalis ' is the clearest\ncase of what I regard as a typical cross-correspondence.\"\n2\nThe case is quite simple. There is a picture in the Stanza\nd'Eliodoro in the Vatican which Miss Johnson describes as\nfollows :\n\" The picture is the well-known one in the Stanza\nd'Eliodoro in the Vatican. The Pope sits on a white palfrey,\na cross-bearer riding on his left and cardinals on his right.\nAttila on a black horse is in the middle of the picture, with\na standard-bearer in the background on his right and a group\nof mounted Huns beyond. St. Peter and St. Paul are\ndescending from the sky, both bearing swords, and St. Peter also\nholding a large key or keys in his left hand. In the back-\nground is seen the city of Home, with the Coliseum and\naqueducts.\" 3\nThe following passages occur in Mrs. Verrall's script\nMarch 2 :\n\" Primus inter pares ipse non nominis immemor.\nCum eo frater etsi non sanguine animo consanouineus.\"\n(First among his peers, himself not unmindful of his name\nwith him a brother related in feeling, though not in blood.)\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XX., p. 156. -Proceedings, Vol. XXI., p. 387.\n3\nProceedings, Vol. XXI., p. 299.\n\fLVIII.] Psychical Research and Survival. 299\nMarch 4 :\n\" Pagan and Pope and Reformer all enemies as\nyou think.\"\nIn Mrs. Holland's script of March 7 there occurs\n\" Ave Eoma immortalis. How could I make it any clearer\nwithout giving her the clue ?\n\" 1\nThere are other details, but the above quotations give the\nessence of the process. This is well described by Miss Johnson\nin her comment. \" A number of details of the picture, cmite\nunintelligible to herself, were given by Mrs. Verrall, while a\nsingle other important detail, clinching the whole matter, was\ngiven by Mrs. Holland, accompanied by a remark implying\nthat Mrs. Verrall had been purposely kept in the dark.\" 2\nI shall now set out a case from Mr. Piddington's records.\nThe one I select is that dealing with Abt Vogler. I choose\nit because, since it has been summarised by Mrs. Verrall, I\ncan use her words and need not make a summary of my\nown. She writes\nIn the case of \"Abt Vogler\" we have a cross-correspondence of\nthe complex type desired. The dates here are important. On\nJanuary 2nd the delivery of the \"Latin Message\" was complete.\nOn January 16th Mr. Piddington spoke to the Piper controls of the\nimportance of cross-correspondences, and suggested the drawing of a\ntriangle within a circle to show that a script formed part of a cross-\ncorrespondence. On January 23rd and 28th my script contained\nallusions to Hope, Star and Browning's Abt Vogler, and on February\n3rd and 17th Miss Verrall's script alluded to star and Browning.\nOn February 11th, before the completion of Miss Verrall's allusion,\nbut after its beginning, the Piper controls announced as a cross-\ncorrespondence \"Browning, Hope and Star,\" and on March 6th and\nthenceforward persistently they claimed that this particular cross-\ncorrespondence was \" an answer to the Latin Message \" ; in other-\nwords, a cross-correspondence of the complex type.\nIs this claim justified 1 Is something discoverable by putting the\nstatements together that is not discoverable from any single one\nof them 1 I think this is so. Mrs. Piper describes the cross-\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XXI., pp. 295-8. Primus inter pares is appropriate to the\nPope. If we take the Pope as St. Peter, the brother in feeling might well be\nSt. Paul. Pagan and Pope is appropriate to Attila and the Pope (cf. Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXI., p. 300.)\n2\nOp. cit., p. 387.\n\f300 Professor A. C. Pigou. [part\ncorrespondence as \" Browning Hope and Star.\" Hope appears in my\nscript as a mis-quotation in a line of Alt Vogler, but does not appear\nin the poem at all. Browning and Star appear in both my script\nand my daughter's. The emphasis in my script among Browning's\npoems is plainly on AM Vogler, but there is no indication in my\nscript as to which, if either, of the lines in that poem which refer\nto a star underlies the general thought. The lines are :\nStanza IV.\n\" Not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star.\"\nStanza VII.\n\"That out of three sounds he frame not a fourth sound but a star.\"\nBut, given that one of these two lines is to be indicated, Miss\nVerrall's script settles the point beyond dispute. The star is \" the\nsign \"\n; there is \" heavenly harmony,\" \" the diapason,\" \" the mystic\nthree,\" \" above it all is the star.\" Thus, while my script\ndetermines the poem, my daughter's script determines the line.\nBut her script alone does not determine the poem. It is only\nby combining her script with mine, and by interpreting them\non the lines suggested by the three words of the Piper controls,\nthat we see the point of this complex cross-correspondence, and find\nthat the whole is something more than the sum of the parts. 1\n\u00a7 1 6. I shall now analyse Mrs. Verrall's different attempts\nat Dr. Verrall's Greek words on a plan similar to the preceding.\nMy point is to show that between these different attempts\nthere is exactly the same kind of complementariness as between\nthe different correspondences in the Piper case ; that the\nisolated passages make no sense separately, but have meaning\nwhen properly combined. The words aimed at, it will be\nremembered, are \/j.ov6-jtw\\ov e$ aw, meaning either \" to the one-\nhorse car of dawn \" or, as Dr. Verrall thinks may be the\ncase, \" to the solitary dawn.\" They are contained in a passage\nfrom Euripides set for the Classical Tripos in 1873 when Dr.\nVerrall was a candidate. In April, 1901, Dr. Verrall wrote\nthem down with a view to seeing whether they would appear\nin Mrs. Verrall's script. I now give the chief relevant passages.\nMrs. Verrall wrote as follows\nJuly 4 : Yellow is the colour of the dawn.\n1\nJournal S.P.R., January, 1909, pp. 29-30.\n\fLVIII.] Psychical Research and Survival. 301\nSept. 2 : Two syllables es to (following what seems like an attempt\nat es on Aug. 9).\nSept. 11 : fj.ovos \/zera Oeov ovSe a\\Xov Tti'os.\n(alone with God, and none other).\nSept. 18 : \u00abs t--os (one horse).\nNow, if we suppose these four passages to have occurred in\nthe writings of separate automatists, we have all the conditions\nof a typical cross-correspondence. Separately they have no\nmeaning, but properly fitted together, they combine into the\nfull meaning of Dr. Verrali's words. This, however, is not all.\nOn August 20, Mrs. Verrall wrote: \"The long room with\nthe many windows is near this hot room, he was outside.\" On\nSept. 20: \"There were others there, but he knew more than\nthe rest.\" Here we have a further elaboration. Dr. Verrali's\nGreek words formed the subject of a conversation between him,\nDr. A. T. Myers, and others on the steps of the Senate House\nafter the examination. The two sentences in combination give\nthe idea, wholly veiled in either of them singly, of a group\non the steps of the Senate House, of whom Dr. Verrall \" knew\nmore than the rest.\" When they are combined, further, with\nthe words already quoted we have this group identified with\nthe party that discussed there the problem of the \" one-horse\ndawn.\" I have kept for the last one passage of that recondite\nallusive type to which Mr. Piddington, in discussing his cross-\ncorrespondences, attributes especial importance. On Sept. 9,\nMrs. Verrall wrote :\n\" Find the herb moly, that will help\u2014it\nis a clue.\" The bearing of this passage has most fortunately\nbeen discovered by the care and ingenuity of Mrs. Verrall.\nI cpiote her words: \"In the spring of 1905, when I was\nwriting this paper, and had ascertained that the passage of\nthe Orestes was set in the last paper of the Classical Tripos\nof 1873, it occurred to me to look at the other papers set in\nthat year, and I found that the subject for Latin Hexameters\nin the Tripos of 1873 was the passage from Coimis ending\n\"And yet more med'cinal is it than that moly\nWhich Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.\" 1\nCould anything be more typical than this of the general\nmanner of the cases recorded in Mr. Piddington's paper ?\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XX., p. 163 and pp. 3S7-90.\n\f302 Professor A.

All the characteristics\nof the best cross-correspondences seem to me to be produced\nin this experiment. Since, therefore, there are strong grounds\nfor believing that the agent here was the subliminal conscious-\nness of Mr. or of Mrs. Verrall, or of both together, there are\nalso strong grounds for believing that the manufacture of\ncross-correspondences of the required type falls within the\ncompass of incarnate mind. In view of this fact I conclude\nthat the occurrence of these correspondences in other cases\ndoes not make probable the operation of any discarnate mind.\n\u00a717. This conclusion, of course, deprives of the greater\npart of its interest the third question which I distinguished\nat the beginning ; if the cause of the correspondences is some\ndiscarnate mind, how probable is it that it is the mind of\nthat deceased person with whom it claims to be identical.\nMy answer to this question would be that the general practice\nof living men and women makes probable the proposition that\na person announcing himself as Mr. A. really is that person.\nSince we have no ground for believing that discarnate intelli-\ngences are more likely than incarnate to adopt aliases, I,\ntherefore, conclude that, if the personality acting through\nMrs. Piper and purporting to be Frederic Myers is a dis-\ncarnate intelligence at all, he probably is Frederic Myers. As\nI have said, however, the evidence seems to me to make it\nprobable that this personality is not a discarnate intelligence,\nbut is a product of the subliminal activity of some living\nperson.\n8 1 8. This conclusion, it should be remembered, refers\nexclusively to the evidence of the cross-correspondences that\nhave so far been recorded. The evidence that consists in\nwhat Mr. Dickinson calls the vraisemblance of the impersona-\ntions of Mrs. Piper's various controls has not been considered.\nIts value cannot, I think, easily be estimated except by intimate\nfriends of the alleged controls who are prepared both to under-\ntake a large number of sittings with Mrs. Piper, and also to\nstudy known cases of fictitious impersonations by secondary per-\nsonalities. What the result of that kind of investigation will\n\fLVIII.] Psychical Research and Survival. 303\nbe I do not venture to forecast. It may be that the manu-\nfacture of vraisemblanccs of the type that has been obtained\nwill not be found to fall within those powers that we have\nevidence for assigning to the subliminal self. It may be,\nagain, that new cross-correspondences will be recorded in the\nfuture that do not fall within those powers. If either of\nthese things happens, we shall be confronted with a problem\nin the logic of probability the solution of which is not likely\nto be easily found.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nPART LIX.\nNovember, 1909.\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETING.\nThe 134th General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nQueen's (Small) Hall, Langharn Place, London, W., on Friday,\nJune 18th, 1909, at 3.30 p.m.; Sir Oliver Lodge in the\nchair.\nThe Hon. Everard Feilding read a paper on \" Some Sittings\nwith Eusapia Palladino,\" the full report of which sittings is\nprinted below.\nu\n\f306 Introductory Note to the [part\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE \" REPORT ON SITTINGS\nWITH EUSAPIA PALLADINO.\"\nThe following paper contains an account by Mr. Eeilding,\nMr. Baggally and Mr. Herewarcl Carrington 1\nof the results\nof their investigations at Naples of the well-known medium\nEusapia Palladino. It seems necessary to introduce it with\nsome explanation of the reasons which have induced the Council\nof the Society for Psychical Research to depart in this instance\nfrom its usual practice of not concerning itself with mediums\nwho have been detected in trickery of a seemingly deliberate\ncharacter, and have led it to send the three above-named\ngentlemen\u2014all experienced investigators well acquainted with\ntricks practised at seances\u2014to Naples to hold sittings with\nEusapia. This explanation is the more needed as it is by no\nmeans the intention of the Council to change its general practice.\nThe reasons against employing fraudulent mediums are very\nobvious. It encourages a mischievous trade, the existence of\nwhich stands in the way of scientific investigation. If it is\ntrue, as alleged, that in the presence of specially endowed\npersons movements of objects and other physical phenomena\nare produced by forces unknown to science, it is of course\npossible and even probable that these forces may sometimes\nbe manifested in the case of persons who are ready to simulate\nthem when it suits their convenience to do so. Proved trickery\ndoes not exclude the possibility of genuine phenomena even\nin connexion with the trickster. But it reduces the value\nof evidence obtained through such a medium, since even if\na competent investigator convinces himself that he has not\nbeen deceived by any conjurer's arts, it is difficult for him to\nproduce the same conviction in others. Moreover, the prevalence\n1\nAuthor of The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism, a book giving a useful\naccount of trick methods.\n\fLix.] \" Report on Sittings ivith Eusapia Palladino.\" 307\nof proved trickery tends to discredit the whole subject and to\ndeter honest persons who think they may have these special\npowers from lending themselves to investigation. And further,\nit tends to foster a belief, likely to fulfil itself through\nsuggestion, that conditions which are favourable to fraud are\nthose favourable to phenomena.\nIt is therefore of the utmost importance, in the interests\nof Psychical Eesearch, that fraudulent mediumship should be\nstrongly discouraged by making it clear that trickery leads\nto loss of employment. So long as the fees of investigators\nand of convinced spiritualists flow with unabated abundance\ninto the pockets of mediums who have been detected in\ndeliberate trickery, this trickery will also remain unabated.\nIt is for these reasons that those guiding the affairs of the\nSociety for Psychical Eesearch have as a rule abstained from\nemploying mediums known to have resorted to deliberate\ntrickery, and they believe that in this they have the approval\nof most of the members of the Society.\nIn the case of Eusapia Palladino, however, another considera-\ntion comes in, and has led the Council to decide that it would\nbe advisable that some persons specially practised in the\ninvestigation of mediumistic physical phenomena, and who had\nthemselves detected trickery in other cases, should carry out\nan investigation with her on behalf of the Society. When\nin 1894 and 1895 certain members of the Society had sittings\nwith her privately, first at the ile Eoubaud and at Carqueiranne\nby invitation of Professor Eichet, and afterwards at Cambridge,\nEusapia had already been detected in what might legitimately\nbe called fraud, though there was room for supposing that it\nmight be occasional only. The Cambridge sittings proved, in\nthe opinion of the sitters, that the deceptive methods adopted\nby her indicated skill and practice on her part, and at these\nsittings she also showed unwillingness to experiment under\nconditions dispensing with the need of continuous observation.\nAccordingly the investigation was dropped. On the other hand,\nhowever, those engaged in Psychical Eesearch abroad have\ncontinued their investigations, and Eusapia has been observed\nby probably a larger number of scientific men than any other\nmedium, and can produce a larger number of witnesses whose\nopinion would carry weight in other subjects, who have been\n\f308 Introductory Note.

In\nparticular Sir Oliver Lodge has always strongly adhered to\nhis view that this is true of some of the phenomena observed\nby him at the ile Eoubaud, and that, further, these were not\nthe result of any trick. (The record of his investigations\nwas printed at the time in the Journal S.P.E., Vol. VI.,\npp. 306-336, and 346-347.)

It may seem a remarkable thing that\nwith all the wealth of opportunity for investigation that\nappears ready at hand no final answer to the question of\nwhat these pretensions amount to should yet have been\nreached.\nIt is understating the case to say that the vast majority\nof these modern wizards and witches are the merest charla-\ntans\u2014sometimes, indeed, using mechanical and scientific apparatus\nof extreme ingenuity,1\nbut as a rule relying merely upon the\nsimplest devices, with an insolent confidence in the avid\nsimplicity of their dupes. Yet every now and then a person-\nality arises whose claims to something beyond such manifest\n1\nA good notion of the dimensions to which this conspiracy of fraud has\nattained in America can be obtained from David P. Abbott's Behind the Scenes\nwith the Mediums (London : Kegan Paul) and H. Carrington's Physical Pheno-\nmena of Spiritualism (London : Werner Laurie).\n\fLix.] Sittings with Eusapia : Introduction. 311\nimposture it has seemed impossible to dismiss thus curtly.\nOf such it would be possible to compile a fairly formidable\nlist, but for present purposes it is sufficient to mention but\ntwo, D. D. Home and Eusapia Palladino, concerning whom a\nmass of material exists from authorities of competence and\nintegrity, of such a kind as to place their case in a wholly\ndifferent category. It may almost be said that by the\nevidence for the possession of supernormal faculty by these\ntwo persons, the whole controversy regarding the existence of\nsome hitherto unascertained and unrecognised force affecting\nmatter and apparently operating, whether directly or indirectly,\nthrough the organism of particular individuals, must be decided.\nIf ultimately the evidence for its display by these \" mediums\n\"\nbe judged invalid, there remains little to be said for the less\nwell-attested claims of any others. If, on the other hand, the\nexistence of a telekinetic force in them can be proved beyond\nreasonable doubt, a great impulse towards credibility is given\nto a number of historical phenomena which have hitherto\nfailed to achieve it, less on account of the weight of evidence\nby which they were supported than of the inherent improba-\nbility of their occurrence. D. D. Home has passed away, a\nlasting marvel to those who witnessed the events of his\ncareer, and a still unsolved mystery to those who are familiar\nwith them through the records only. Eusapia Palladino is,\nhowever, still active, and, owing to an increasing interest among\nmen of science on the Continent in the strange phenomena\nalleged to take place in her presence, may be said to have\nreached the zenith of her fame.\nHistorical.\nWithout attempting a complete history of this remarkable\nwoman, it may be useful to give a short outline of the events\nwhich have made her so interesting a figure in the discussion\nof this obscure question.\nEusapia was the daughter of a peasant, and was born in\n1854 in the province of Bari. Her education was of the\npoorest, and even now she is unable to read, or to write more\nthan her own name. According to her own account, her\nfather having been killed by brigands, she was, after certain\n\f312 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nvicissitudes, taken in a menial position into a family given\nto spiritualistic practices. Being called one day to make up the\ncircle at a seance, certain new and surprising manifestations\ntook place, and she was pronounced to he herself a \" medium.\"\nShe states that for many years she was merely frightened by\nthese occurrences and sought to evade the importunity of\npeople who constantly tried to induce her to attend seances.\nShe eventually made the acquaintance of Cavaliere Ercole\nChiaja of Naples, who, partly overcoming her prejudices, per-\nsuaded her to develop her \" power.\" It was through this\ngentleman that Eusapia owed her first introduction to the\nscientific world, by the publication in 1888 of an open letter\nto Professor Lombroso stating that the writer had become\nconvinced that certain phenomena took place in her presence\ncontrary to all natural physical law, and inviting Lombroso to\ninvestigate the case for himself. Lombroso did so three years later,\nwith the result that he was convinced of the non -fraudulent\ncharacter of the phenomena. Professor Tamburini, however,\nwho was associated with him in the experiments, did not\nconsider that the evidence was sufficient to give conclusive\nproof of the production or transmission of force in modes\nother than those known to science, though he apparently\nadmitted that it pointed strongly in that direction, and was\nprepared to grant the possibility, or even the probability, of\nLombroso's view that cerebral movements might be transmitted\nby means of the ether to surrounding objects, and act upon\nthem as force, without the intervention of muscular action\n(Lombroso, Annales des Sciences Psychiques, 1891, p. 326, and\n1892, p. 143; Tamburini, Spiritismo e telepatia, reviewed in\nProceedings S.P.E., Vol. IX., p. 224;.\nLombroso's confession of faith had the effect of inducing\nanother group of scientific men to undertake fresh experi-\nments, and 17 sittings were held in 1892 in Milan by a\ncommittee consisting of Professor Schiaparelli, Director of the\nAstronomical Observatory of Milan ; Professor Eichet, Professor\nof Physiology in Paris ; Carl du Prel, D.Ph. of Munich ;\nAngelo\nBrofferio, Professor of Philosophy ;\nthree physicists, Professor\nGerosa and Drs. Ermacora and Finzi, and M. Aksakoff, the\nwell-known spiritualist (see Annates des Sciences Psychiques, 1893,\npp. 39-64). The phenomena were of the kind that have since\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Introduction. 313\nbeen so frequently described in connection with Eusapia ; in\nfull light, levitations of the table, movements of objects, and\nthe alteration by as much as 21 lbs. of the medium's weight\nin a balance ; and in darkness or semi-darkness, the appear-\nance and contact of hands, etc. The Committee, with some\nreserve as to the frequently unsatisfactory nature of the holding\nof Eusapia's hands, came to the conclusion that none of the\nphenomena which were obtained in good light could have\nbeen produced by trickery, and that this was equally true of\nmany of the others.\nEeferring to the appearance of a hand, they say, \" It is im-\npossible to count the number of times that that hand appeared\nand was touched by one of us ; suffice it to say that doubt\nwas no longer possible ; it was, indeed, a living human hand\nwhich we saw and touched, while at the same time the bust\nand arms of the medium remained visible and her hands were\nheld by those on either side of her.\"\nProfessor Eichet did not sign the report, but preferred to\nissue a more cautious one of his own (Annalcs des Sciences\nPsycMqioes, 1893, pp. 1-31). He points out various unsatis-\nfactory features of the control of the medium's hands, as well\nas the inconclusive nature of the experiments in the reduction\nof her weight. In regard to the hands that were seen and felt,\nhe thinks that the only normal explanation of them (the hypothesis\nof an accomplice being apparently out of the question) was that\nEusapia got one of her hands free, and he discusses in detail\nthe way in which this might have been done by substitution.\nHe gives, however, cases where substitution seems impossible,\nand says that they never detected it. M. Eichet states his\nown conclusion as follows :\n\" Absurd and unsatisfactory though\nthey were, it seems to me very difficult to attribute the\nphenomena produced to deception, conscious or unconscious, or\nto a series of deceptions. Nevertheless, conclusive and indis-\nputable proof that there was no fraud on Eusapia's part, or\nillusion on our part, is wanting. We must therefore renew our\nefforts to obtain such proof.\"\n1\nA series of 40 sittings were held in Warsaw by Dr. Ochorowicz\nin 1893-1894, the reports of which were published in the\n1\nA full discussion by Mr. Podmore of these Milan experiments will be found\nin Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IX., p. 218.\n\f314 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nPolish newspapers and are summarised by de Krauz in the\nRevue de VHypnotismc, July-December, 1894. There were\nconsiderable differences of opinion as to the results among those\nwho took part in the sittings. Out of twenty-three experi-\nmenters, ten, including Ochorowicz himself, were convinced of\nthe supernormal character of the phenomena ;\nseven, while\nexpressing certain doubts as to the honesty of the medium and\nthe method of experimentation, thought they could not all be\ndue to an ordinary mechanical agency. Two, on the other\nhand, were inclined, with certain reservations, to deny the\nsupernormal character of the manifestations, and three attributed\nthem all to fraud. One declined to express any opinion\nat all, being dissatisfied with the method of experimentation.\nWhile certain observations of Dr. Eeichmann, one of the three\nwho denied the genuineness of any of the phenomena, irre-\nsistibly point to fraud on certain occasions ; on certain others\nthe correctness of his observation is strongly disputed by Dr.\nOchorowicz. It appears that Dr. Eeichmann detected, among\nother more occasional tricks, the substitution of hands or feet\nwhich afterwards played so prominent a part in the Cambridge\nexperiments, as will be noticed later.\nIn 1894 Sir Oliver Lodge and Mr. Myers, on Professor\nEichet's invitation, took part in four sittings at the ile Eoubaud\nin the Mediterranean ; Sir Oliver Lodge being given control of\nthe seance room. A few weeks later, Professor and Mrs.\nSidgwick, also as Professor Eichet's guests, assisted at eight\nsittings, at six of which Sir Oliver Lodge was again present.\nA full report by him of the first series is printed in the\nJournal S.P.E., Vol. VI. (pp. 306-336 and 346-7). Sir\nOliver Lodge and Mr. Myers were convinced by these sittings\nof the supernormal character of some of the phenomena\nand Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick, who did not witness the\nphenomena that most impressed Sir Oliver Lodge, expressed the\nopinion that if the medium's hands were, as they appeared\nto be, adequately controlled, there seemed no way of accounting\nfor the phenomena except by supernormal means. At these\nsittings, some of which were held in darkness too great to\nadmit of the hands being seen, no fraud was actually\ndiscovered.\nIn the Journal S.P.E. for March-April, 1895, Vol. VII.\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia : Introduction. 315\n(pp. 36-55), there appeared an analysis and criticism of Sir\nOliver Lodge's report by Dr. Hodgson, who complained that a\nnumber of important points, chiefly relative to the conditions of\ncontrol and, in particular, to the way the hands and feet of\nEusapia were held, were omitted from the report, leaving the\ndoor open for various suppositions as to the way in which\nthe phenomena might have been produced by normal means.\nAs a result of this criticism it was felt that further experiment\nwas necessary, and in the summer of 1S95 Eusapia came to\nCambridge, where she gave a series of twenty-one sittings.\nVery early in the sittings suspicious circumstances were\nobserved, especially in regard to the limitations imposed by\nEusapia on the 'holding of her hands and feet, and the coin-\ncidence of the phenomena with the moment of least satisfactory\nholding. What was still more suspicious was the precautions\napparently adopted by Eusapia to avoid any detection of fraud.\nShe would not allow the sitters to feel about in the darkness\nwith their hands, and any \" grabbing\" of the supposed material-\nised hand that performed the touches or movements of objects\nwas strictly forbidden. After vainly attempting through the\ngreater part of the sittings to obtain genuine phenomena under\nunimpeachable conditions, the investigators were obliged to\nturn their attention to ascertaining exactly what methods of\nfraud were used. Dr. Hodgson had been invited over from\nAmerica to attend these sittings, and his observations, with\nthose of other sitters, ended in convincing all those who had\nany prolonged experience of the sittings that the substitution\nof hands and feet described by Prof. Eichet as possible, and\nalready detected by Dr. Eeichmann, constantly occurred and\ncould be observed if attention was directed to it. At the end\nof the series, the investigators responsible for conducting it\nunanimously arrived at the conclusion that systematic fraud, of\na kind that must have required long practice, had been used\nin many cases and was to be inferred in others, and that there\nwas no adecpuate reason for concluding in favour of any super-\nnormal agency having been at work during the course of the\nsittings. (See Journal S.P.E., Vol. VII., pp. 131-5, and 14S-159.)\nNone of the present writers had the advantage of being-\npresent at these Cambridge sittings, which appear to have\ndiffered markedly in certain respects from those which form the\n\f316 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Cdrrington. [part\nsubject of the present report. The chief points of difference\nlie in the condition of light and in the degree of control of\nher hands permitted by Eusapia. For the most part the seances\nappear to have taken place either in complete darkness or in\nlight so poor as not to ensure the visibility of the medium's hands,\nwhile she seems never to have allowed her hands to be properly\nheld. This, as will be seen later, also occurred at some of the\nNaples sittings, and our experience was that the sense of\ntouch was so little to be trusted on the occasions when Eusapia\nrefused to allow the complete control of her hands, that observation\ndepending on it alone is quite useless. Had our own sittings\nbeen conducted throughout in these conditions it is quite\ncertain that we should have felt ourselves unable to come to\nthe conclusions at which in fact we arrived.\nThe net result of the Cambridge experiments was not to\nshow any hitherto unsuspected method of trickery, but to\nshow that certain already discovered methods, substitution of\nhands or feet in the dark, were far more frequently resorted,\nto than the Continental observers had up to then ascertained.\nThe Cambridge series is, we believe, the only published\nnegative series in the experience of Eusapia, though we have\nknowledge of at least one other series of 14 or 15 sittings\nin which the fraudulent devices already mentioned played an\nextremely prominent role. It should, however, be added that\nin these sittings, as in a certain proportion of those at Cam-\nbridge, opportunities for cheating were, for experimental purposes,\ndeliberately given, of which the medium took suitable advantage.\nIt would be wearisome to attempt to review all the series\nof experiments undergone by Eusapia since the issue of the\nCambridge report. The bibliography of the reports and dis-\ncussions on her rnediumship which have appeared between\n1895 and 1907 cover 29 pages in Prof. Morselli's recent\nbook. She had been dropped by this Society as a fraudulent\nmedium, notwithstanding the fact that there appeared to be a\nfew phenomena, even in the Cambridge sittings, for which the\nascertained fraud could not account, to say nothing of the\nprevious observations by Sir Oliver Lodge at the ile Roubaud,\nand by numbers of other qualified experimenters. Continental\nobservers were by no means satisfied that the Cambridge\nreport could cover the whole ground of Eusapia's case, and\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia: Introduction. 317\nthey renewed their investigations with increased energy. As a\nresult, the opinion of practically all the scientific men and\nothers (apart from the Cambridge investigators) who have given\nany attention by personal experiment to the subject, is that,\nafter making every allowance for such fraud as she may occa-\nsionally permit herself to indulge in, Eusapia is nevertheless\npossessed of faculties of some supernormal kind. The most\nimportant contributions to the study of the case are perhaps\nM. Camille Flainmarion's Les forces naturelles inconnues, in which,\nas part of a general discussion of alleged supernormal pheno-\nmena, an elaborate description of Eusapia's case is contained ;\nthe large work, in two volumes, Psicologia c Spiritismo, by\nEnrico Morselli, Professor of Pathology in the University of\nGenoa (reviewed in Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. XXL, pp. 516-25); the\nreport by M. Courtier, issued by the Institut Gtniral Psychologique\nof Paris as the result of experiments extending over three\nyears, and attended, among others, by Professor and Madame\nCurie, M. d'Arsonval, M.

They\nmention the practice of certain frauds, saying that it is difficult\nto indicate exactly the extent of them, and point out that of\ncourse such frauds, adequately proved, tend to throw suspicion\nupon everything. They state that the objectivity, at all events,\nof the phenomena has been proved by self-registering instru-\nments ; that movements and liftings of objects appear to take\nplace by simple contact with the hands or the dress of the\nmedium, and also without contact; that although muscular\ncontractions on the part of the medium take place at the time\nof such movements, no direct mechanical action upon the object\nso moved was observed ; that in the neighbourhood of the medium\nluminous phenomena were observed of which the character was\nundetermined : that forms of human appearance were seen and\nsensations of contact felt, in the production of some of which,\nhowever, fraud was ascertained, and that apparently the medium\ncan from a distance discharge an electroscope and produce in\nobjects molecular vibrations (raps and other sounds).1\nThe report of Prof. Bottazzi \" Dans Us regions inexplorSes de\nla biologic hitmaine \" in the Annalcs referred to above is of an\nabsolutely positive character. It is lively reading, and, granting\nthat the phenomena are genuine, is of much interest as a descrip-\ntion of Eusapia's seances, and of the results attending the use\nof various scientific apparatus. But as the dull details of the\nactual control existing are not insisted on, it is of little help\nas a solution of the problem whether the phenomena in them-\nselves were or were not fraudulent.\nObject of the Present Investigation.\nIn the face of all these reports from scientific men of\nhigh standing and accustomed to experimental research, which,\ni A full discussion of this report will be found in Count Solovovo's review\nbelow.\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia : Introduction. 319\nwhether wholly favourable or not, at all events suggested\nthat the case of Eusapia could not be lightly dismissed with\nthe explanation that all the phenomena occurring in her presence\nwere due to common fraud, it seemed desirable that this\nSociety, one of whose objects is to investigate physical phenomena,\nshould not maintain its attitude of aloofness on the mere ground\nthat Eusapia was, on certain occasions, detected in trickery,\nand the Council accordingly, after some consideration, deter-\nmined to reopen the case. A statement of their attitude in the\nmatter is contained in the Note which prefaces the present\nEeport.\nCount Solovovo, in his review printed below, criticises the Paris\nreport on the ground that while it proves the objectivity of the\nphenomena, sufficient regard was not paid to proving their\nauthenticity. The phenomena themselves are elaborately described,\nbut not the exact conditions under which they occurred. With\ncertain exceptions, the same criticism may, indeed, be made of\nmost of the reports which have hitherto appeared. The experi-\nmenters have been more solicitous of stating their conclusions\nthan of assisting readers to form conclusions for themselves.\nWe decided, therefore, to furnish as complete a record as\npossible of the conduct of our seances, and while it is true that a\nreport consisting mainly, as does the present, of mere details of\nhand-holding, foot-holding, and conditions of light, is intolerably\nwearisome and unreadable, a report of this kind is necessary for\nthose who are prepared to take the trouble of following at least\na part of it with attention, if anything more than the mere ipse\ndixit of an observer as to the adequacy of the control is to be\nprovided.\nThe Investigating Committee.\nAs regards the personnel of the Committee appointed by\nthe Council to undertake the investigation, it was felt that as the\nobject of it was merely to attempt to determine whether the\nphenomena were due to trickery or not, the assistance of\npersons well versed in the available methods of trickery should\nbe invoked.\nMr. Carrington has been for some time the investigator for\nthe American Society for Psychical Research, and is the author\n\f320 E. Feilcling, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nof a book, The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism (London\nWerner Laurie), in which is a detailed exposure of the tricks\nemployed by fraudulent mediums, of which he has made a\nspecial study. For many years Mr. Garrington has been an\namateur conjurer, and is able to reproduce almost any of the\nslate writing and other \"tests\" offered by the average \"medium.\"\nIn the course of his work for the American Society he has\ninvestigated many cases . of poltergeists, physical phenomena,\netc., etc., and in all the ten years of such work had never\nseen anything that he was unable to account for by trickery,\nwhich in many cases he could improve upon.\nMr. Baggally has similarly been for many years an investi-\ngator of the phenomena of spiritualism and has been\nspecially interested in the physical phenomena. He, also, is\nan amateur conjurer of much experience. Notwithstanding the\nfact that he had investigated nearly all the mediums who\nhave appeared upon the spiritualist horizon since the days of\nD. D. Home, he, like Mr. Garrington, had never yet met with\nwhat appeared to him a genuine example of any agency\nother than that of more or less easily discoverable trickery, and\nbefore the experiments with Eusapia, had come to an entirely\nnegative conclusion as to the probability of any genuine physical\nphenomena.\nMr. Leilding, though not himself a conjurer, had had a\nreasonably extensive experience in the investigation of physical\nphenomena and the advantage of a fairly complete education\nat the hands of fraudulent mediums. While preserving an\nopen mind as to the possibility of the existence of some\nhitherto unascertained force in nature whereby the manifesta-\ntions testified to by so many observers of high standing were\nproduced, the discovery of repeated fraud had produced in him\nan attitude of complete scepticism as regards the probability\nof his ever finding any examples of the exercise of such a\nforce.\n\f\fFig. I.\nFacing p. 321.\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia: General Account. 321\nII.\nGENEEAL ACCOUNT OF THE SITTINGS.\nThe Stance Boom.\nOn receipt of the Council's commission to hold further\nexperiments with Eusapia, a wire was sent asking if she\nwould consent to a series of seances, and an affirmative reply\nbeing received, two of us, E. and C.,\n1\nwent to Naples. We\nchose adjoining rooms on the fifth floor of the Hotel Victoria,\none of the principal hotels in Naples, and decided to hold the\nseances in E.'s room, of which a plan is given facing p. 346.\nF. and C. then visited Eusapia and made arrangements with\nher for a series of five seances, to be extended to ten if re-\nquired. Enquiries were next made for an English shorthand\nwriter, who was eventually, on the suggestion of Messrs. Thos.\nCook & Son, discovered in the person of Mr. Albert Meeson, a\ngentleman in the employ of the American Express Co., and hither-\nto unknown to Eusapia.\n2\nA group of electric lights of variable illuminating power\nwas arranged and hung from the ceiling at a distance of\n6 feet from the position of the medium's head.\nAs paraphernalia for the proposed seances, Eusapia desired\nus to procure a pair of black curtains and a small deal table.\nAlternatively, she offered to provide them herself. We accepted\nher offer expressly with a view to seeing if she would provide\nanything in the nature of a trick apparatus. The curtains,\nwhich were her own, proved to be of very thin black cashmere\nand concealed no mystery ; while the table which she procured\nfor us, and of which a photograph is given opposite, was on\ncareful examination found to be an absolutely plain structure,\n1\nFrom this point onwards the investigators, Messrs. Feilding, Carrington, and\nBaggally (who later joined the first two), are designated by their initials.\n2\nWe wish to take this occasion of expressing our acknowledgments to Mr.\nMeeson for his invaluable assistance in what proved a most laborious under-\ntaking.\nX\n\f322 E.

The\ncurtains were, at Eusapia's request, stretched across a corner of\nthe seance room on a wire fastened to nails in the walls, so as\nto enclose a small triangular space, the depth from the angle\nof the walls to the middle of the curtains beino- 2 ft. 8 ins.\n(80 cm.), and the space so enclosed will be referred to through-\nout this report as the '\ncabinet.'\nEusapia also requested us to procure various small objects\nto be placed inside the cabinet. We purchased accordingly\na couple of tambourines, a guitar, a toy trumpet, a flageolet,\na toy piano, and a tea bell. These objects were disposed about\nthe cabinet, some on a small round table which we generally\nplaced inside it, and some on the floor, leaning against the\nwalls or against the small table (see Eig. II.).\nThe scene, in fact, was set according to Eusapia's usual\nhabit ; and if a criticism be made (a criticism the justice of\nwhich we are ourselves prepared partly to concede) that we\ndid not in this setting or in the subsequent conduct of the\nexperiments seek to introduce a variation from her accustomed\nprocedure, our reply must be that our time in Naples was\nlimited, and that after due consideration we preferred to adopt\nconditions to which the medium was used and in which there-\nfore it was probable that effects would be produced, rather\nthan impose others which might possibly impede the produc-\ntion of what we had gone to study. We conceived our\nfunction to be, not the scientific examination of the nature\nof the force involved in the production of possibly supernormal\nmanifestations, but, by means of the technical experience in\n'\nspiritualistic ' conjuring possessed by two out of our number,\nto attempt to determine the preliminary question of whether\nthe manifestations themselves were or were not merely at-\ntributable to legerdemain.\nRightly or wrongly, we believed, and still believe, that the\nsimplest plan would be to allow matters to take their accus-\ntomed course, while adopting every precaution that occurred\nto us as necessary to the end we had in view. We felt that\nif, in a reasonable number of experiments, persons specially\nversed in conjuring tricks and already forewarned concerning,\nand familiar with, the particular tricks to be expected, were\n\fFig. II.\n\f\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia : General Account. 323\nunable to discover them, it would not be presumptuous to\nclaim as a probable consequence that some other agency must\nbe involved.\nConduct of the Seances.\nBefore the arrival of Eusapia, the room was examined, un-\nnecessary furniture removed, the cabinet was prepared, the\nvarious objects put in position, and the curtains drawn together.\nOne of us then went down to receive her. She came\nattended by her husband, who then left, and she came up\nto our rooms alone. The door was then locked, and she\nimmediately took her place at the narrow end of the seance\ntable, with her back to the curtains of the cabinet, the back\nof her chair being a foot or a foot and a half distant from\nthem. One of us sat on each side of her, holding or held by\nher hand, with his foot under or on her foot, his leg generally\npressing against the whole length of hers, often with his free\nhand across her knees, and very frequently with his two feet\nencircling her foot.\nThe degree of control permitted by her varied very much,\nand appeared to depend upon her mood. If she was in a good\ntemper she would generally allow us to control her as we\npleased, that is, to hold the whole of her hand, to tie her\nhands and her feet, or to encircle her feet with ours. If,\nas happened on two or three occasions, she was in a\nbad temper, she made difficulties about everything, com-\nplained of our suspicious attitude, allowed the poorest light,\nand was generally intractable. We never found, hoivever, that\nthe adequacy of the control influenced unfavourably the pro-\nduction of the phenomena. On the contrary, it was on the\nnights when she was in the best humour, and consequently\nwhen our precautions were most complete and the light the\nstrongest, that the phenomena were the most numerous. On\nthe other hand, when she seemed in bad health, or was in a\nbad humour or indisposed for the seance, she appeared to try\nto evade our control : she would not allow us to grasp her\nhands fully, but merely rested them on ours ; she asked for\nthe light to be reduced, and her movements were furtive and\nhard to follow. The phenomena on these occasions were rarer\nand of small account, and ive did not find that the reduction\n\f324 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nof light, and the consequent increased facility for fraud had\nany effect in stimulating them.\nHer own condition varied greatly. She exhibited three\nstages of consciousness. During the continuance of the brighter\nlight in which the stance generally opened she remained per-\nfectly normal, and it was in this state as a rule that the\nlevitations 1\nof the seance table, which will be later described,\ntook place. She would then gradually sink into a condition\nof half-trance, preluded as a rule by numerous yawns and\namazing hiccoughs. In this state she still speaks and answers\nquestions, though her manner is quieter than in her normal\nstate, her speech oppressed and plaintive, and her eyes\nclouded. She professes to have no recollection of events that\ntake place in this state. It is difficult to distinguish the\nexact moment of the beginning of this amnesic condition, but\nwhen questioned she stated that as a rule she remembers\nnothing after the light is reduced for the first time.\nOf her third state, that of deep trance, we did not have\nmany examples. It was, however, generally coincident with\nthe more complex phenomena. Ex hypothesi, while in this\nstate she is under the complete influence of her '\ncontrol,' 2\n'\nJohn King.' She speaks sometimes in a deep voice, refers to\nherself in the third person as 'my daughter' or 'the medium,'\nand addresses the sitters as '\nthou.' She laughs occasionally\nin a raucous, almost diabolic manner, and her expression is at\ntimes fierce and forbidding. But as a rule she is apparently\noverwhelmed by sleep, throws herself often into the arms of\nher neighbours, remains entirely passive, and surrenders herself\n1\nSee footnote, p. 347. We use the word '\nlevitation ' merely because it ha?,\nso to speak, become consecrated by practice in this sense. The word 'lifting'\nwould be more correct. The Paris experiments, referred to above, show con-\nclusively that the lifting of the table does not involve any modification of\nthe laws of gravity, but that it is produced by some force having its point\nd'appui in the medium, whose weight as registered in a scale increases by the\nweight of the table at the moment of lifting. This is of course consistent with,\nthough not necessarily demonstrative of, a fraudulent lifting by her hands or\nfeet. The conclusion that the lifting is not produced by normal means can only\nbe arrived at by observing that in fact no mechanical contact exists.\n2\nThe word 'control' is used in two senses, as meaning (1) the precautions\nprevailing at the moment as to the holding of the medium's hands and feet\n(2) when printed in inverted commas, the entity, or whatever it may be, calling\nitself generally 'John King,' which purports to 'possess' her.\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia: General Account. 325\ncompletely to their control. We did not attempt to make\nany physiological study , of her condition in these varying\nstages, this having already been the subject of elaborate obser-\nvation by many previous experimenters.\nOf the two trance conditions it is that of half-trance which\nis the more complex, as it appears to exhibit the characteristics\nof a form of divided consciousness, namely, her own trance\nconsciousness and that of the soi-disant '\ncontrol,' which co-\noperate, though by no means with complete agreement, in\ndirecting the proceedings. The former communicates through\nher own speech, the latter by means of an established code\nthrough tilts of the table. Thus, two tilts signify '\nno '\nthree, 'yes'; four, 'talk'; five, 'less light'; seven, 'the seance\nis ended.' In the early stages of trance the directions for\ndiminution ot the light are usually given through tilts or levi-\ntations (sometimes apparently without contact) of the table.\nEusapia herself frequently opposes these directions, but as a\nrule the table continues, by repeated series of five tilts, often\nof great violence, to demand a reduction of light to which\nshe ultimately gives way. In the later stages of trance, when\nEusapia is entirely under 1\ncontrol,' the directions for less light\nare given by her verbally, as is always the case for an in-\ncrease of light, for which there is apparently no accepted\ncode of tilts.\nThe Control.\nThere appears to be no feature of Eusapia's seances upon\nwhich observers differ more than upon the question of the\ndifficulty or otherwise of properly controlling the move-\nments of her feet and hands. By comparing accounts it is\nevident that this must vary to a marked extent, not only as\nbetween individual stances, but as between series of experi-\nments. We can, of course, only speak of our own experience.\nWe can readily understand that if experimenters have had\nthe misfortune of assisting only at what may be called her\n'\nbad nights,' they would rise with a sense of profound dis-\nsatisfaction. Of such we had several examples, notably the\nthird seance of our series. Eusapia was in a nervous, anxious\nmood, perpetually interrupting to ask if the control was satis-\nfactory, and perpetually rendering it as difficult as possible\n\f326 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nfor us to make it so. The conditions were precisely those\nwhich seem to have chiefly prevailed at the Cambridge\nsittings. Her hands played about on the top of those of\nher controllers in a furtive and elusive manner, and the\nlight during a considerable portion of the seance was ex-\ntremely dim. It was, however, not so dim as to prevent C.\nfrom twice observing the substitution of hands which has\noccupied so large a space in the general discussion of Eusapia's\nmediumship. There was room to suppose that this trick was\nagain resorted to in complete darkness in the fourth stance; and\nit was certainly performed once in the eleventh, when however\nthe light was amply sufficient to foredoom it to failure, if her\nintention in performing it was fraudulent. (See note, Seance\nXL, 10.30-10.34 p.m.)\nWhether fraudulent or not, the skill with which the sub-\nstitution was performed was remarkable. The tactile sensation\nof continuity of contact was unbroken. On neither occasion\nin Seance III., when the substitution was performed, was F.\naware of it, though it was immediately seen by C, on whose\nside the hand was released ; while in Seance XL, though\nvisible to F. from the other side of the table, the release was\nnot felt either by him or by Mrs. H., who was controlling on the\nside on which it happened. It is therefore possible, if not\nprobable, that substitution may have taken place on other\noccasions when the darkness was sufficient to prevent its being-\ndetected visually, that is, chiefly during Seances III., IV. and X.\nWe consider, however, that the conclusions to which we\nhave come regarding the character of Eusapia's phenomena\nare in no way affected by this admission. These conclusions\nwere formed as a result of seances in which, on account of\nthe degree of light and of the adequacy of control, substitution\nof hands was not possible and,\u2014unless our coincident sensations\nof both sight and touch were constantly hallucinatory,\u2014cer-\ntainly did not take place, and of such seances the bulk of our\nseries of experiments was composed.\nOur own experience, therefore, is that, whereas in certain\nconditions absolutely no reliance can be placed on the control\nof Eusapia and the phenomena obtained,\u2014even when there is\nno direct evidence to show that they are fraudulent,\u2014are\nwholly inconclusive and unsatisfactory: in other conditions the\n\fLix.] Sittings with Eusapia : General Account. 327\ncontrol of her is not a matter of difficulty, nor can the\nphenomena observed therein be explained by any such method\nas substitution or release of hands or feet.\nOf substitution of feet we discovered no instances. It is\ntrue that the method of controlling her feet preferred by\nEusapia, namely the placing of her feet on those of her con-\ntrollers, is in itself unsatisfactory. This method was, however,\nby no means invariable. Sometimes, though rarely, she allowed\nthe controllers' feet to be placed on hers ; sometimes she\nallowed both their feet wholly to encircle hers ; sometimes she\nencircled the leg of one of the controllers tightly between her\nown or rested both her legs across his knees ; and sometimes\nher feet were held beneath the table. Nearly always the\ncontrollers' knees pressed closely against the outside of her\nknees, so that her leg was felt and imprisoned from the knee\nto the foot, and very frequently (and whenever he wished)\na controller's free hand was laid across her knees.\nWe notice in other reports references to Eusapia's insistence\non the '\nchain ' being strictly maintained, that is, that all the\nsitters should join hands in a circle. During our seances,\nexcept during Seances IV., VIII., X. and XL, when our num-\nbers were increased by the addition of persons whom we had\ninvited, this was rarely done, and, except on a very few occa-\nsions, was not asked for. She never objected to our moving\nour free hands about as we wished, placing them on her\nknees, head or shoulders, or feeling about behind her, or\npassing them up and clown the whole length of her arms and\nlegs.\nOn certain occasions, as will be seen by reference to the\nRemarks on the various seances, she permitted us, and on\nothers, invited us, to tie her hands to our own and to one\nanother, and her feet to her chair or to ours. But as already\nstated, the occurrence of the phenomena appeared to depend\nentirely upon her own condition, to the '\npsychic trim ' in which\nshe happened to be, and not at all upon the severity or laxity\nof the control or the degree of light permitted at the time,\nor upon the closeness of our attention.\nOur observations on the above head are positive and are\nunaffected by those of other observers derived from less satis-\nfactory conditions. It appears unquestionable that, given the\n\f328 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nopportunity, Eusapia will seek to produce her manifestations\nnormally, that is, by a substitution and momentary release of\nher hands, and that if unchecked, she will continue to do this\nfor long periods together. It is also unquestionable that her\nskill in effecting this substitution is so great that in poor\nconditions of light it is practically impossible to rely upon\nmere tactile sensation to determine whether she has or has\nnot resorted to it. Had our experiences been limited to our\nthird, fourth and tenth seances we should undoubtedly, even\nthough unable to demonstrate the fraudulent character of the\nphenomena or to explain the mode of their production, have\nremained wholly unconvinced that we were not the victims\nof some clever trick. We did not, however, willingly permit\nany imposture, and on the occasions when, in poor conditions\nof control, we detected a substitution, we notified her that we\nhad done so. A general discussion of Eusapia's fraud and of\nthe impossibility of considering it applicable to the phenomena\non which we rely for our own conclusions will be found in C.'s\nand F.'s notes to Seance III. and F.'s supplementary note to\nthe same seance ; F.'s note to Seance V.; all the notes to\nSeance VI.; B.'s note to Seance VII.; F.'s note to Seance\nX.; and B.'s final note.\nThe Phenomena.\nThese took place apparently according to a certain pro-\ngramme. At the earlier seances, phenomena of a simple kind\nonly were produced. As the series progressed, new phenomena\nwere added at almost every stance, some of the former mani-\nfestations being eliminated, so that the proceedings appeared\nto shift, as it were, along a kind of scale.

Not only did they present nothing exceptional, but\nmany of the more remarkable phenomena described by Sir\nOliver Lodge, by Prof. Morselli, and by M. Courtier in his\nreport of the sittings held by the Institut Ge'ne'ral Psychologique\nof Paris, and others, did not occur.\nWe proceed to a description of the various classes of phe-\nnomena, with references to the shorthand notes of each seance\nfor examples which appear to us especially worthy of attention.\nFurther descriptions of the more interesting cases will generally\nbe found in the preliminary Eemarks to the respective seances\nor in the notes at the end.\n(1) Movements and levitations of the stance table.\nA series of these movements generally occurred at the be-\nginning and end of each seance, while occasional levitations\noccurred during its course. They were among the most frequent\nphenomena, and were produced in the strongest prevailing light,\nviz. a light in which we were able to read small print. As a\nrule the table began to rock in a manner explainable by the\nordinary pressure of Eusapia's hands. It then tilted in a\nmanner not so explainable, that is, in a direction away from the\nmedium while her hands were resting lightly on the top, and\nfinally it would leave the ground entirely and rise to a height of\nfrom six inches to two feet rapidly, remain there an appreciable\ntime and then come down. Sometimes there would be slight\ncontact of the medium's hands on the top, but very frequently\nno apparent contact whatever, her hands being held by us at\na distance of a foot or two from the table, either in her lap\nor above the table. No precautions that we took hindered\n\f332 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nthese movements in the slightest. Eusapia had no hooks,\neither at her wrists or under the front of her bodice, and we\ncould never discern the slightest movement of her knees or\nfeet. We very often had our free hands on her knees, while\nher feet were controlled either by our feet or by one of us\nunder the table, and were generally away from the table legs,\nan absolutely clear space being sometimes discernible between\nher and any part of the table. The total levitations in our\nseries lasted as a maximum two or three seconds, though other\nobservers have reported levitations lasting a much longer space\nof time.\nPartial\n1\nlevitations, on the other hand, when the table re-\nmained tilted at an angle on two legs, generally away from\nor sideways to the medium, were often of very much longer\nduration, half a minute or even a minute.

For these she generally,\nthough not always, demanded a reduction of the light, but it\nstill remained sufficient to enable every movement of the\nmedium to be clearly seen, even from the further end of the\ntable. She would generally hold out one of her hands towards\nthe curtain, always held by or holding one of ours at a dis-\ntance of about 8 or 12 inches from it, and the curtain would\nballoon out towards it in a bulge. Sometimes the same effect\nwould be produced if one of us held our own hands towards\nthe curtain at her request. The bulge was a round one, as\nif the curtains were pushed out from behind. If we made a\nsudden grab at the bulge, no resistance was encountered, and\nthe bulge subsided as though one had pricked the surface of\na balloon. There was no attachment to her hand, as we\nconstantly verified by passing our hands between her and the\ncurtain. Nor would any attachment produce the same effect,\nas the curtain was so thin that the point of attachment of\nany string would at once have been seen. Besides these bulges\nin response to her or our gestures, there were spontaneous\nmovements of the curtain, often very violent, and frequently\nthe whole curtain would be flung out with so much force\nthat the bottom of it came right over to the further end of\nthe table. This occurred notwithstanding that Eusapia herself\nwas perfectly visible and motionless, both hands held and\nseparately visible upon the table, her feet away from the cur-\ntain, in front of her, and under the table.

Either the raps were produced while\nthe medium's hands were resting on the table, or the exact\nposition of her feet at the moment of their production was\nnot determined, or the place where they sounded was uncertain.\nAt the end of Seance XL, when the light had been turned up\nand the seance was thought to be ended, there occurred, in\nresponse to gestures by the medium, a series of raps on an\ninternal door at a distance of 6 inches to 3 feet from her,\nwhich appeared to fulfil all the necessary conditions. See\nSeance VIII. 11.19.\nXI. 1.15, and B.'s Final note.\n(5) Bangs on the sdance table.\nThese bangs may be considered separately from the raps,\nthe quality and quantity of the sound being absolutely different.\nWhereas the raps (except those which occurred in Stances\nVIII. and XI.) were seldom louder than if made by a gentle\nrap with a knuckle on the table, and were unaccompanied by\nany apparent movement on the part of the medium, the bangs\nsounded like a heavy crash with a wooden mallet, and were\nalways accompanied by a sudden movement either of the\nmedium's head or leg, though without any apparent contact\nwith the table.

It was sometimes shaken with such vigour\nthat the objects all fell off. On three or four occasions it\nthen appeared over the medium's shoulder, as though lifted\nby some one within the cabinet, and landed upon the seance\ntable horizontally, that is, with its top resting on our table\nand its legs pointing into the cabinet. It would then some-\ntimes appear to hang in that position, for half a minute or a\nminute (possibly, though not apparently, supported by Eusapia's\narm, or ours as we held her hand on the seance table), and\ntry to climb on to the seance table.

In the latter case, it was twice violently\nshaken, lifted and let go with a bang, by some force which,\nconsidering the tightness of the fastening, must have been\nvery considerable. The attention which apparently had hitherto\nbeen directed chiefly to the table was now diverted to the\nobjects on it, and these were in turn transported by some\nunascertainable agency on to the seance table.

See Seance XL 12.56 and B.'s Final note.\n(12) Abearance of hands outside the curtain.\nThe next development was that these hands became visible\noutside the curtain. They generally, though not always, appeared\nbetween the parting of the curtains over Eusapia's head. They\nwere of different appearances, dead paper white, or of a\nnatural colour. Sometimes they shot out rapidly and were\nimperfectly seen, sometimes they came with a slow deliberate\nmotion, and sometimes carried objects with them. On one\noccasion a grasp was felt by a hand seen at the same time.\nSee e.g.\nSeance V. 11.10.\nVI. 12.23.\nVII. 11.20 and F.'s note, 12.9 (F.'s control not given),\nand B.'s note.\nVIII. 1.5 and F.'s note.\nY\n\f338 E.

At one time\nthey would appear like shadowy objects which shot out with\nextreme rapidity and silence from the side of the curtain,\nlooking, from the position from which they were seen, like\ntwo-dimensional faces in profile, made of cobweb. At another,\nthe appearance was as though the curtain had itself been\nformed into the likeness of a head with very pronounced\nfeatures by being drawn tightly over a large hand with its\nfingers crooked to imitate a face. On other occasions they\nappeared like a square head at the end of a long stalk-like\nbody, which shot out over the medium's head, turned sharply,\napproaching within a few inches of the sitter's face, and\nthen shot back. Sometimes they looked like the medium's own\narm, pivoted on her shoulder, and wrapped up in something\nblack, producing the effect of folds (or, as we described them\nhurriedly at the time, '\nwarts '). The movement of these latter\n'\nheads ' was slow, and on the occasions when they appeared,\nthey emerged from the side of the curtain, came right across\nthe table (bringing the curtain also, as would be the case if\nthey had really been the medium's arm), bowed two or three\ntimes with deliberation, and then retired. Their appearance\nwas obviously suspicious, but the control existing at the time\nseemed adequate to exclude the possibility of her having freed\nher arm for their production. See e.g.\nSeance II.

They were\nof different shapes, sometimes square, sometimes round, in the\nlatter case looking like a white handkerchief rolled up, or a\nhandful of white muslin. Here again the actual appearance\nwas obviously suspicious.

It either jumped about where it stood, or approached the\nmedium or receded from her in response to gestures made with\nher hand at a distance from it of several feet. In Seance XI.\nit was also seen to climb very slowly up the curtain from the\nfloor to the level of her head, at a distance of about 3 feet\nfrom her body. There were also movements of a tambourine\non the floor at a distance of 2 or 3 feet from the medium.\nExamination for an attachment of some kind was made in the\nintervals between movements of this kind, but none was found.\nSee e.g.\nSeance IV. 12.23 (control imperfectly noted).\nIX. 10.30, 10.33, 10.37, 10.40, 1145, 11.58, 1.5.\nXL 10.19, 10.23, 12:26.\n(17) Lights.\nOf these we had but few examples, but these few must be\nranked among the more interesting phenomena.

After termination of seance, see C.'s note.\n(19) Untying of knots.\nApparently sudden and mysterious untyings of knots have\nalso been reported by other experimenters. We had only one\ninstance of this. Unlike most of the other phenomena, it\noccurred casually and unexpectedly, after the manner of a con-\njuring trick. We record its occurrence without further comment.\nSee Seance VIII. 1.5 and F.'s note.\nConclusions.\nThe evidence for the foregoing phenomena varies considerably\nboth in quantity and quality, and we are of opinion that any\nattempt at an analysis dividing them into classes for which\nthe evidence may be regarded as sufficient or insufficient would\nbe of purely academic interest and of no real value.\nIt was only through constant repetition of the same phe-\nnomenon, in a good light and at moments when its occurrence\nwas expected, and after finding that none of the precautions\nwhich we took had any influence in impeding it, that we\ngradually reached the conviction that some force was in play\nwhich was beyond the reach of ordinary control, and beyond\nthe skill of the most skilful conjuror. But though we have\ncome to that general conclusion, we find it exceedingly difficult\nto say to which particular phenomena, or even to which\nparticular kind of phenomena, we have sufficiently strict evidence\nto apply it.\nSo while each of us could indicate, and in our various notes\nhas indicated, cases of special evidential value to himself, we\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia : General Account. 341\nhesitate to select either any particular individual phenomenon\nas providing absolute proof of some supernormal agency, or\nany individual class of phenomena as exhibiting more certainly\nits action.\nWe think there is no conceivable form of evidence which,\nif relating to one phenomenon only, would have convinced us,\neven as eye-witnesses, of its supernormal character. The mind\nconfronted with an obviously absurd isolated fact merely rebels,\nas with us was (and remains) the case in, for example, the\nisolated instance of untying of knots reported in Seance VIII.\nEvery possible and impossible form of doubt suggests itself\nunder such circumstances. And to persons who were not eye-\nwitnesses, the evidence regarding any special phenomenon will\ninevitably appear still less conclusive.\nThus our conclusions are based on the resultant impressions\nderived from the whole series, since we are unable to say to\nwhat special phenomena these conclusions extend, and we limit\nourselves here to a statement of opinion, amounting in our\nown minds to certainty, that to explain Eusapia's manifesta-\ntions some agency of a kind wholly different from mere physical\ndexterity on her part must be invoked.\nThe conditions in which the seances were held render\nabsolutely inadmissible the supposition that there was any\naccomplice. There remains therefore, in our opinion, only one\npossible alternative to the hypothesis of some supernormal\nphysical force, namely, the hypothesis that in some way we\nwere collectively hallucinated.\nThe hallucination theory has been repeatedly suggested and\nhas lately been urged with much ingenuity by Miss Johnson 1\nas the probable interpretation of this class of phenomena, and\nespecially of the phenomena occurring in the case of D. D. Home,\nwhich it would seem impossible to explain normally on any other\nhypothesis.\nIt appears to us that this hypothesis must involve the\npossession by Eusapia of some supernormal psychical force,\nacting upon our perceptions\u2014without systematic suggestion,\nwithout preparation, irregular in its procedure, but invariably\nproducing the same results\u2014in such a way as constantly to\n1\nSee her paper on \"The Education of the Sitter,\" in Proceedings S.P.R.\nVol. XXL, pp. 483-511.\n\f342 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\ninhibit our power of deriving any accurate information through\nour ordinary channels of sense, visual or tactile.\nThe theory of hallucination in this case must apply to one or\nboth of the following incidents : namely, the fact of the\nphenomenon itself, or the character of the control existing at\nthe moment of its production ; that is, either we imagined that\nthe phenomenon took place when in fact it did not, i.e. the\nphenomenon was subjective, not objective ; or we imagined that\nwe both saw and felt Eusapia's hands in a particular place\nwhen in fact they were elsewhere ; in other words, we were\nconstantly '\nglamoured.'\nWe think ourselves justified in discarding the first of these\nalternatives at once, without further discussion. The mere fact\nthat, when such a phenomenon as the transportation of an\nobject occurred, it was afterwards found in the place to which\nit had appeared to be moved is alone sufficient to show its\ninapplicability. Further, the flash-light photographs of M. de\nFontenay and others, and the records of the self-registering\ninstruments used by the Institut Gindral Psychologique or by\nProf. Bottazzi, supply absolute proof of the objectivity of the\nphenomena,1\nalthough, of course, affording no evidence of their\nsupernormal character.\nThere remains, then, the theory that we were hallucinated\nas to our control.\nIt is clearly insufficient to suppose that we were merely\ndeceived, an explanation which, in unfavourable conditions of\nhand-holding and of light, would be more than plausible. The\ndeception, in the conditions which prevailed at the bulk of\nour seances, must amount to a complete hallucination.\n1\nOne hears much of hallucination as a possible explanation of physical\nphenomena ; but I can say that, after attending many stances, I have never\nseen a single trace of hallucination in any single instance. In some cases,\nI have seen illusions propagated, but never a full-blown hallucination. In\nmany cases, hallucination has been urged as a possible explanation for facts\nwhich I knew and saw to be perfectly fraudulent. Fraud is always a far\nsimpler and more rational hypothesis than hallucination ; and I may say in\nthis connection that I have never met a conjuror who believes in hallucination\nas an explanation of any conjuring or mediumistic trick, though his whole\nperformance depends upon a series of illusions. I think that, on account\nof my long experience as an amateur conjuror and investigator of fraudulent\nmediumistic devices, my testimony should have some weight in this connec-\ntion.\u2014H. C.\n\fLix.] Sittings with Eusapia : General Account. 343\nThis is undoubtedly the theory which will be held by the\nmost serious of our critics, and it is the oidy one we think it\nworth while attempting to meet. To do so adequately is by its\nvery nature impossible, just as it would be impossible for a\nperson, by mere assertion, to meet a charge that he was not\ntelling the truth. We can but attempt to show its improbability\nIt would involve the assumption not only that each of us\nwas subject to fully externalised hallucinations both of touch\nand of vision, but that we were concurrently and concordantly\nhallucinated. When, for example, at 1.0 a.m. in Seance XL, B.\nreports that he is holding both the medium's thumbs in different\nhands, and F. from the further end of the opposite side of the\ntable shortly afterwards spontaneously reports a change of B.'s\ncontrol and says that he now sees B. holding both her thumbs\nin his right hand, it would have to be supposed, first, that B.\nwas hallucinated when he reported that he held both her\nthumbs in separate hands, and secondly, that F. was hallucinated\nwhen he reported the change of the thumbs to B.'s right hand,\nand that both remained collectively hallucinated during the con-\ntinued touches on B.'s left hand by a hand within the curtain.\nThe hypothesis would imply, further, not only that we our-\nselves were subject to such hallucinations, but that the majority\nof all the other experimenters with Eusapia were similarly subject\nto them. Also, that such hallucinations could be induced with-\nout words on Eusapia's part, on persons who, while they had\nfrequently assisted at performances at which professedly super-\nnormal occurrences were to take place, had never yet been\nhallucinated into a belief in them.\nWe should again have to suppose that this state of '\nbe-\nslatnourment ' could co-exist with a decree of attention which\no o\nwas constantly being stimulated by the necessity of having to\nreport momentary observations to the shorthand writer ; that\nit was strong enough to prevail against an attitude, at all\nevents in the earlier seances, of hostility, and in all of\nthem, of suspicion ; that while it was sufficiently effective to\nprevent us from observing the modus operandi of tricks per-\nformed in a reasonable light, requiring the greatest boldness of\nexecution, and often continuing for a considerable space of\ntime, it was not effective enough to preclude us from perfectly\nwell noticing the machinery of substitution when no tricks\n\f344 E.

[part\nwere performed whatever (Seances III. 10.28; XI. 10.30), or\nfrom contemporaneously speculating upon its performance in\nconditions of darkness, when illusions of sensation might, as\nwe were well aware, easily take place. (Seances IV. 12.9 ;\nX. 12.11).\nFinally, we must suppose that this abnormal condition of\nconsciousness had supervened without any of the victims to it\neither being aware of any change in himself, or noticing it\nin the others. While familiar through experiment with the\npossibilities of hypnotic and other suggestion, whereby halluci-\nnations even in the waking state may occasionally be produced,\nwe believe that long continued and collective hallucinations of\nthis kind, without either previous hypnosis or verbal suggestion,\nbut purely spontaneous, are wholly outside those possibilities.\nThe question therefore seems reduced to a choice between\ntwo improbabilities. Either we were constantly thrown into a\nstate of hallucination by means of a mysterious suggestive\ninfluence exercised by Eusapia, for the existence of which,\neither in her or in anybody else, there is otherwise, in our\nview, no evidence whatever ;\nor, on the other hand, the\nordinarily recognised laws of dynamics have to be enlarged by\nthe assumption that there does actually exist some hitherto\nunascertained force liberated in her presence and for the exist-\nence of which, both in her and certain other persons, the body\nof evidence is, we think, not inconsiderable.\nWith great intellectual reluctance, though without much\npersonal doubt as to its justice, we adopt the latter alternative.\nMaking, then, a reservation for the possibility of some form of\nhallucinatory influence of such a kind as fundamentally to in-\nvalidate the trustworthiness of all evidence and for the existence\nof which we believe there is neither warrant nor parallel, we\nare of opinion that we have witnessed in the presence of\nEusapia Palladino the action of some telekinetic force, the\nnature and origin of which we cannot attempt to specify,\nthrough which, without the introduction of either accomplices,\napparatus, or mere manual dexterity, she is able to produce\nmovements of, and percussive and other sounds in, objects at a\ndistance from her and unconnected with her in any apparent\nphysical manner, and also to produce matter, or the appearance\nof matter, without any determinable source of supply.\n\f\fFig. III.\nFacing p. 345.\n\fSittings ivith Euswpia: Detailed Report. 345\nIII.\nDETAILED BEPORT.\nMeasurements.\nRoom} Width, 11 ft.

They were written\nindependently and supply a progressive record of the state of\nmind of the individual sitters and of the effect produced on\nthem by the seances, as well as a more detailed description\nof specific occurrences.\nIn the shorthand reports, the descriptions of phenomena are\nprinted in large type, and the descriptions of the control\nprevailing during each particular phenomenon in small type,\nwhile alterations in the general conditions, or casual occurrences,\nor remarks not specifically concerning the preceding phe-\nnomenon, are indicated by italics. In no case has the exact\nshorthand report been added to or altered, otherwise than\ngrammatically, except as follows : when, on transcribing the\nshorthand notes, it was found that the interpretation of a\npassage describing either a phenomenon or the accompanying\ncontrol was not clear, the passage has been omitted, with the\nresult that the case is then understated, and the phenomenon\nin question is described under the general heading of \" non-\nevidential.\" The transcribing of the shorthand report was\nusually done the following day, and in the presence of the\nsitters. Any additions made by them either then or at a\nlater date are enclosed in square brackets, initialled and dated.\nThe description of each phenomenon is given in the exact\nwords dictated by one of the sitters, usually, though not\ninvariably, by the one to the medium's left. Any dissent\nfrom, or amplification of, the description by any other sitter\nis also given. The condition of the light is given in black\ntype in the margin.\nRemarks on Seance I.\nNovember 21s\/\n1\n, 1908.\nThe phenomena at this seance were of three kinds only,\nmovements of the table, raps on the table, and bulging move-\nments of the curtain, behind the medium, as though blown\n\fSittings toith Euscqna : Seance I. 347\nout from within at a spot about on a level with her head.\nThese movements or raps went on almost without intermission\nthroughout, rendering proper description of them, as well as\nof the control, almost impossible. Various degrees of light\nprevailed, but these differences did not appear to have much\neffect upon the movements, which were about as frequent and\nstrong in the good light as in the feeble. The seance began\nat 10.35 p.m. Five minutes afterwards the table began to\ntilt, sometimes in a way that could be explained by the\nordinary pressure of the medium's hands, but often in a\nmanner not thus explainable, either because her hands were off\nthe table altogether, or because they were only touching it on the\ntop in such a way as to be unable, normally, to produce the move-\nment. A very large number of partial and complete levitations\n1\ntook place under these conditions. As the light was ample\nduring many of these, it was easy to see that no hook or\nother form of attachment was used, nor, notwithstanding close\nwatch, could we ever detect the slightest trace of her\nusing either her knees or her feet. At the beginning of\nthe seance, the stenographer was in the adjoining room and,\nwhat with our difficulty in keeping pace with the phenomena,\nand his difficulty in hearing what we said, the shorthand\nnotes of this portion proved so inadequate that they are not\ngiven in detail, only a few extracts being made. Even after\nthe stenographer entered the seance room and took his place\nat another table, our inexperience as to the best and shortest\nway of describing our control, and his in recording it, resulted\nin the notes being very incomplete. From this point, however,\nthey are given more or less in detail for what they are\nworth. Owing to all the details of control not having\nbeen stated, a reader who can judge of the conditions only\n1\nThroughout the reports, the terms \"complete\" and \"partial levitation\"\nconstantly recur. By \"complete levitation,\" we mean the lifting of the table\noff all four legs simultaneously. A levitation of this kind was seldom\nless than 6 in. off the ground, and frequently a foot or more. By \"partial\nlevitation \" we mean the raising of the table on to two, and sometimes on\nto only one, leg. In complete levitations the table generally went up horizon-\ntally, sometimes momentarily, but occasionally for several seconds. A partial\nlevitation would often turn into a complete levitation\u2014the table, after having\nbeen poised on one or two legs for a certain time at an angle, ultimately\nleaving the ground altogether and going up into the air, usually at the same\nangle.\n\f348 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nfrom the actual records will naturally not be so impressed\nwith the difficulty of supposing that these levitations were\nproduced by hands or feet or some mechanical device as we\nwere, both at the time and since. Special attention may be\ndirected to the levitations occurring at 11.26, 11.43, and 11.44,\nwhich occurred in good light, sufficient to enable us to read\nfrom where we were seated. The levitation occurring under\nthe time 11.58, though in poor light, is of interest.\nThroughout the seance, Eusapia's hands were held by\nus, and her feet were controlled, sometimes by our feet\non the top of hers, or hers on ours. It is evident that\nfoot control of this kind is unsatisfactory in the case of long-\ncontinued observation of sparse phenomena. During this\nsitting, however, the levitations often followed one another\nwith such rapidity that dictation of them was almost impos-\nsible, and notwithstanding that every kind of foot control was\ntried, such as encircling her feet separately between our feet\nand encircling the legs of the table with our legs, nothing\nseemed to impede them.\nOf raps there were many examples. The medium generally\nheld one of our hands in hers and made a gesture with it\ntowards the table, and a rap, apparently on the top of the\ntable, followed shortly after. The quality of these raps varied,\nbut as one of her hands was generally on the table, and her\nfeet were not in view, they could not be regarded as evidential.\nThe bulging of the curtain behind the medium, though\noccurring at this seance in fairly poor light coming through\nthe slightly open door from the next room, were very remark-\nable. The medium sat well in front of the curtain : her feet\nand hands were absolutely controlled. She would approach\none of her hands, held by one of ours, to within about a\nfoot of it, and the curtain would bulge out, sometimes gently,\nbut sometimes with considerable force. The bulge was a\nround one, as though blown from within, and not in the least\nappearing as if any string or attachment were made to the\noutside. The coming out of the curtain happened generally\nas she approached her hand towards it, not as she withdrew\nit, as would be the case if there was an invisible attachment.\nDuring and between some of these movements C. passed his\narm between Eusapia and the curtain, and along the floor,\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance I. 349\nand found no attachment, and indeed, as the curtain was\nextremely thin, its movement, if any attachment had existed,\nwould have been obviously due to such, and of a wholly dif-\nferent character from what actually occurred.\nShorthand Report of Seanck I.\nNovember list, 1908.\nPresent\u2014F., C, and If., shorthand writer.\n[Dictated] C. on right of medium and F. on left.\n1\nM., the steno-\ngrapher, in the next room with the door open, cdearly seeing the\ntable.

[part\nLight I.\n[The seance began at 10.35 p.m. Five minutes afterwards, the\ntable began to tilt, sometimes in a way that could be explained\nby the ordinary pressure of the medium's hand, but often in a\nmanner apparently not thus explainable. These tilts took place\nfrequently away from the medium, while her hands were off the\ntable and perfectly visible. They followed one another very\nrapidly, but, owing to our inexperience, we found it extremely\ndifficult, in our first seance, to describe them and the accom-\npanying control of the hands and feet properly. This difficulty\nwas increased by the distance of the stenographer from ourselves.\nThe result was that the shorthand notes proved so inadequate\nthat they are not given in detail during the first part of the\nseance.

There is no contradiction, however. As the table was\nbeing levitated, the medium lifted my hand off the table, with hers ;\nbut, while the table was still in the air, she placed my hand on the\ntable, asked me to press, and pressed herself.

My right leg was between her leg and the leg of the table.\n12.30 a.m. Seven raps tell us to end the stance and the lights\nare turned up.\nNote by E. Feilding.\nIt must not be thought that we are not painfully conscious of\nthe shortcomings of the report of this first seance. On re-reading\nthe notes after a lapse of a few days, it is mortifying to find in\nhow many cases the control, especially of the feet, is not stated.\nHaving frequently criticized the reports of others, we set out with\nthe intention of supplying a record which would be proof against\nthe attacks of absent critics ; and we have failed egregiously. The\nseance was, in fact, far more remarkable than the report suggests.\nThe light, which, while the electric light in the seance room was\nlit, was sufficient to enable us to see everything with almost as\nmuch clearness as in an ordinary well-shaded sitting-room, was at\nall times sufficient to show the medium's face and hands with\nperfect distinctness. Notwithstanding the frequent lapses in our\ndescription of the control, we were, in fact, at no time conscious of\nthe slightest suspicion of its adequacy. The movements of the\ntable or curtain were almost continuous. It was not as if Eusapia\nwaited for a favourable moment of inattention on our part to produce\na phenomenon, but the phenomena happened, and went on happen-\ning, in spite of our best efforts to prevent them. It is unthinkable\nto us that for two hours two reasonably intelligent and active men,\nboth fairly well posted in the tricks of mediums, closely clinging\nwith arms and legs about this elderly lady, could be baffled by\nmere methods of substitution of feet or hands, for which they were\nconstantly on the look-out. The shorthand report has given us\nso much trouble that though it was written out as well as possible\nin long-hand the day after the seance, we have delayed till to-day\ntyping it in its final form. It is therefore in the light of the fraud\npractised in the third seance that we are able still to look back\n\f358 E. Feilcling, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nwith astonishment on the first, and record our unchanged impression\nof its remarkable character.\nE. F. Nov. 29th, 1908.\nNote by H. Carrington.\nThere is little I can add to F.'s note, with which I wholly concur.\nThe weak point of the seance, of course (to outsiders, not to our-\nselves), is the frequent lapse of recorded control of one hand or\none foot. This was due partly to our inexperience of this particular\nkind of dictation and to the rapidity with which, on occasion, the\nphenomena succeeded one another. We would dictate an account\nof a phenomenon and, say, the control on one side, when another\nphenomenon occurred and prevented the opposite sitter from giving\nhis control. When several phenomena thus occurred in rapid succes-\nsion the control was almost invariably the same for all, so that, by\nreading the record, and piecing together the various controls of\nhands and feet as stated, a correct idea may be gained of the\ndegree of its efficacy. I need only add that the control in this first\nseance struck me throughout as almost perfect, while the light,\nduring the greater part of the time, was so good that we could\nclearly see both the medium's hands, and we should almost have\nbeen content not to hold them at all, so clear was her every\nmovement.\nH. C. Dec. 7th, 1908.\nRemarks on Seance II.\nNovember 23rd, 1908.\nIn the second seance the programme of phenomena was\nsomewhat enlarged. Besides a very large number of levita-\ntions of the table and raps upon it, there were touches by\ninvisible or unseen finger tips, or what felt like such, on both\nF. and C, while there were also, as before, many movements of\nthe curtain. There were, further, movements of the objects\nbehind the curtain ; noises and raps behind the curtain ; the\nplucking of the string of the guitar on the floor in the\ncorner of the cabinet ; the upsetting of the small table in the\ncabinet, and the transportation of it over the medium's shoulder\nhalf on to the stance table; and the appearance to C. of the\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance II. 359\nsilhouette of a kind of head which shot out to a distance\nof about two feet from the curtains.\nAs a result of practice with the shorthand writer during\nthe day, the descriptions of the control, though still in many\nimportant cases inadequate, were not only much better given,\nbut better recorded, so that the shorthand report gives a\nfairly accurate summary of the proceedings. The same dif-\nficulty of keeping pace with the phenomena was, however,\nexperienced as at the first seance, for occasionally they\nfollowed each other so rapidly that the description of\none was interrupted by the happening of another and\nthen another. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this\nseance was the number and interest of the phenomena which\noccurred in the bright No. 1 light, a sixteen candle power\nlamp shaded with three thicknesses of tissue paper, and which\nwas strong enough not only to enable us to see every object\nall over the room, but even to read, at our places at the\ntable, small print. The sitting began in this light, and the\ntable almost immediately started tilting with contact, and\nraps were produced in it while the medium knelt in her\nchair, with her feet away from the table, and only touching\nthe table with one hand. We were not afterwards able to\nimitate these raps, but, owing to the contact of the medium's\nliand with the table, felt unable to come to any conclusion\nas to their origin.\nAware of the objections to the character of the foot\ncontrol at the previous seance, we asked the medium\nif she would allow her feet to be tied. She made no ob-\njection, and they were accordingly secured round the ankles\nto the legs and rung of her chair, leaving her a play of\nabout four inches. There then followed a series of tilts of\na remarkable character, sometimes without contact of the\nmedium's hands, and no apparent contact of her feet; some-\ntimes with a hand resting on the table, but in such a way\nas could not account normally for the particular movement.\nHer body was always motionless during these tilts, a clear\nspace of generally about 6 inches being visible between her\nchest and the table. Under the conditions of light in which\nthese tilts and the subsequent complete levitations occurred,\nany hook or attachment to her body would have become\n\f360 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nimmediately visible. Nor was there, so far as we were able\nto see, any action of her knees or feet. It is true that the\nfastening of her ankles was not close enough to prevent her\nfrom getting her feet under the legs, and raising the table\nat one corner or another by ankle movement, and so pro-\nducing a very easily detectable \" partial levitation.\" We\nwere, however, of course, specially and constantly on the\nwatch for action of this kind. The hands of one or other\nof us were frequently over both her knees, and during a great\npart of the stance F.'s leg was completely between hers and\nthe leg of the table.\nOccasionally, when the table was tilted or entirely levi-\ntated, it resisted considerable pressure downwards by C.\nsee shorthand notes at 10.45 p.m. and 10.58 p.m. Sometimes\nthe table would start upwards while the medium's hands,\nholding or held in ours, were on the table ; but sometimes\nshe would pull our hands high above the table, or one above\nand the other below on her lap, and then the table would\nrise a second or so later\u2014see shorthand notes at 11.0, 11.1\nand 11.13 p.m. Total levitations alternated with partial ones-\n\u2014see shorthand notes at 10.58, 11.0 and 11.5 (three in\nrapid succession) and 11.11 p.m. (two).\nIt was not till after successive diminutions of light had\nbeen made that movements of the curtain occurred. These\nreached a climax in the whole of one of the curtains blowing\nright over the full length of the table (11.30 p.m.), after\nwhich noises took place in the cabinet under what appeared\nto be perfect conditions of control.\nAt 11.42 the small table in the cabinet was lifted up and\ncame over Eusapia's left shoulder, with the curtain enveloping\nit, on to the seance table and remained hanging there, its\ntop on the seance table and its legs downwards at an angle\nof about 45\u00b0, over Eusapia's and C.'s joined hands. C. felt\nit pushing against his hand as though it were trying to climb\nfurther up on to the seance table, and eventually it fell back\non to the ground, where it lay horizontally, its legs pointing\noutwards. At a later period of the seance (11.55 p.m.) in a\npoor light, though sufficient for both C. and F. to see it from\ntheir places, it began to retire back into the cabinet towards\nthe corner, away from Eusapia, in a series of little jumps, a\n\fLIX.] Sittings tvith Eusapia: Seance II. 361\nmovement which it continued to make after Eusapia had\ndirected the electric light to be turned up again.\nAt 11.44 p.m. there commenced a short series of touches\non both sitters given in different places in immediate response\nto requests, the medium's head being visible, her hands visible\nand held, and her feet tied. Whatever it was that produced\nthe touches remained, however, unseen.\nThe appearance, at about 11.52 p.m., of a square head on\na long neck which shot apparently from the curtain between\nEusapia and C, cannot, perhaps, be considered in itself as\nevidential, as F. had ceased to control the medium's right\nhand while engaged in releasing the fastening of her right\nfoot. It was, however, the first of many subsequent similar\nappearances which occurred while the control was adequate,\nand is of interest on that account.\nAfter more noises in the cabinet synchronising with muscular\ntensions of the medium's hand (11.55 to 12.0 p.m.) Eusapia\nasked for more light, and the electric light of the seance\nroom was turned up as at the beginning of the sitting.\nThen followed a series of manifestations which must be\nregarded as amongst the most remarkable that occurred through-\nout the seances, on account of the excellence of the light and\nthe absolute ease with which every movement of the medium\ncould be followed. Eusapia sat about a foot away from the\ncurtain, which was withdrawn in such a way that on different\nsides of it C. and F. could see right into the cabinet.

The plucking of the guitar string alone, under\nthe conditions prevailing, appeared to us practically convincing. It\nmust be remembered that, at this time, the light was excellent,\nallowing us clearly to see the whole body of the medium, and to\nread small print. Her head and her two hands were plainly visible ;\nher feet controlled; in addition to which there was a space of about\n\f.374 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\na foot between her body and the cabinet curtains. Further, the\nsmall table was lying on the floor in the cabinet, forming a sort\nof \" fence \" between Eusapia and the guitar. The guitar was upside\ndown, in the corner, and at least four feet from the medium. Yet,\nunder these conditions, a string was clearly and forcibly plucked\non the guitar. We were absolutely positive at the time, and remain\nso still, that Eusapia could not have reached the guitar by any\nnormal means. H. C, Dec. 7th, 1908.\nNote by E. Feilding.\nIn preparing the report for press I perceive that I wrote no\ncontemporary note to this seance. I think I shirked it. My mind\nwas not prepared to accept the phenomena which occurred,\nand yet I was unable to suggest any loophole for fraud in the\nproduction of any of them. Re-reading the shorthand report after\nthis lapse of time, and studying it critically, I can appreciate what\nan absolutely different impression it must make on the mind of any\none not present, who is naturally justified in doubting whether,\nwhen some obvious precaution is not mentioned in the report, it\nmay not perhaps have been neglected.\nThis seance, although the phenomena were less complicated than\nthose at later seances, ranks in my memory as among the most remark-\nable of the whole series. We were still fresh at the game, still alertly\nsuspicious of every movement of Eusapia; somewhat annoyed, to\nspeak frankly, at our failure to detect any fraud at the first seance,\nand determined to get even with her. We tied her feet, and then\npresently forgot that we had tied them, and to judge by C.'s somewhat,\nelaborate note at 11.19, did not even remember it the next day. This\nattitude of suspicion must be read, therefore, into the report, which\nof itself, as a complete record of events, is very imperfect.\nAs it is inevitable that critics will talk of excited and emotional\nwitnesses, I should like to state that throughout the whole series of\nseances it was only on two occasions that I experienced the slightest\nemotional thrill. The cause of the second of these occasions was the\nphenomenon occurring at 12.11 a.m. in the sixth seance; while the\ncause of the first was the plucking of the guitar string during the\nseance under consideration. The matter itself was simple enough,\nyet it was precisely one of the things which one knew could not\nhappen, but which did. E. F., Feb. 9th, 1909.\n\f\f\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance III. :J7o\nRemarks on Seance III.\nNovember 26th, 1908.\nFor this seance we had prepared an apparatus, referred to in\nthe report as the \" stocks,\" with a view to preventing the\nfraudulent use of the medium's feet in levitating the table. A\nreproduction of a photograph of this apparatus is given\nopposite. It consisted of two wooden tubes, shaped like\ninverted cones, into which were inserted the legs of the table\nat the end at which the medium sat. The tubes were joined,\nat the bottom, by a board which rested flat on the floor, and at\nthe top, by another board so placed as to go over the medium's\nknees when she sat at the table. The lower board extended on\neach side so as to enable one leg of the. chair of the sitter on\neither side of the medium to be placed upon it. The conical\nshape of the tubes permitted the table to tilt fairly freely.\nIt is evident that as the medium could not get her feet\nunder the legs of the table, nor her knees either against the\nlegs or, owing to the upper board, against the top of the\ntable, it was impossible for her to levitate it fraudulently with\nher feet or knees, except in one way, viz. by sitting very low\nin her chair, thrusting her legs far under the knee-board of\nthe stocks, and kicking upwards in the middle of the table.\nThis would involve a form of acrobatic contortion which would\nnot only have been very obvious, but was of a kind to which\nthe robust physique of the medium certainly did not appear to\nlend itself. While, however, effectively eliminating leg action, the\nstocks, we found, facilitated that of the hands, since a direct\npull at the front of the table caused its legs to slide along\nthe sloping sides of the conical tubes and produced a bad\nimitation of a total levitation.\nA change was made in the lighting arrangements by the\nfitting up of a group of four electric lamps hanging in the same\nposition as the original lamp. By means of a commutator\nstanding on the shorthand writer's table, the light could be\nsuccessively reduced from the ordinary light of the room\ndown to a rather faint glow.\nThe programme of phenomena at this seance consisted of\nlevitations of the seance table ; movements of the curtains\ntouchings and pullings of the sitters as if by an unseen hand\n\f376 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\ncoming from behind the curtain ; movements of objects inside the\ncabinet, including the upsetting of the small table within it, and\nlevitations of the small table while standing outside the curtain.\nOwing to the poor light that prevailed during a great part\nof the seance the conditions were not nearly so satisfactory as\nthose of the first two seances. Further, during the darkness, the\nmedium twice effected the substitution of hands detected at\nthe Cambridge sittings and elsewhere. A discussion of this\napparently fraudulent action will be found in the notes\nfollowing the shorthand report.\nLevitations of the table were far fewer than at the previous\nseances, the table remaining motionless for long periods\ntogether. Whether or not this was due, as at the time wo\nsupposed it was, to the use of the stocks, it is impossible to\nsay. It may, however, be remarked that at several of the\nlater stances, though no stocks were used, there were scarcely\nany movements whatever of the table, the phenomena appear-\ning merely to have progressed to another part of the programme.\nAt this seance the most frequent phenomena were movements\nof the curtain, which began after about a quarter of an hour,\nin the faintest of the four lamps, which, however, was still\nbright enough to enable us to see the grain in the wood of\nthe table. These movements followed one another rapidly from\n10.3 till 10.13, when the light was turned out, leaving only the\nphotographic lamp on the stenographer's table. After a few\nmore movements of the curtain the light was further reduced,\nat 10.24, by shading the photographic lamp on to the steno-\ngrapher's book, leaving the faintest possible illumination, just\nenough to distinguish the whereabouts of the medium's face.\nJust after 10.27 she made the substitution of hands\nalready referred to. This was immediately detected and\nprotested against. After touches on F.'s side and hand, the\nmedium gave warning that something was going to happen,\nand asked for careful control. The table was then completely\nlevitated (10.52) under what appeared to be unimpeachable\nconditions. Owing, however, to the state of suspicion into\nwhich we had been thrown by the fraud referred to above,\nand to the poor light, we were not at the time impressed.\nThe upsetting of the small table within the cabinet, at\n10.55, must be regarded as non-evidential owing to the\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance III. 377\nshorthand report omitting to state whether the control had\nbeen relaxed during the moment of rest immediately preceding it.\nAt 10.56 C. was pulled on the sleeve at a time when\nboth hands are accounted for separately, while the light was\nsufficient for the head to be clearly distinguishable. At 11.2\nthe medium asked for No. 4 light to be turned up again,\nand shortly afterwards asked for her feet to be held under\nthe table by F., M. taking his place meanwhile. Two complete\nlevitations of the table immediately followed. At the time\nwe attributed her wish for a change merely to a hope that\nshe would find M. a less experienced controller.\nAt 11.30 the medium, apparently realizing our dissatisfaction,\nasked for her hands to be tied to those of the sitters on either\nside of her. Further movements of the curtain and, after the\nlight had been further increased to the No. 3 lamp, touches on\nthe sitters continued unchecked, and at 11.45 there occurred an\noutburst of phenomena of various kinds at once, accompanied\nby the typical muscular contractions which we began to notice\nthat the medium usually exhibited either shortly before or\nat the moment of production of her strongest manifestations.\nThese contractions consist of strong pressure of her hands on\nthose of the sitters, or of spasmodic movements of her feet\nand legs, accompanied by those of the sitters under the table\nin front of her. The effect is as though muscular pressure\nproduced a discharge of some kind of energy which took effect\non objects at a distance from her. We have never been\nable to trace any normal physical connection between these\nmovements and the phenomena which are precipitated by them.\nAt 11.50 the small table from the cabinet emerged and\nattempted to climb first on to C.'s chair and then on to\nthe seance table ; but the control is inadequately stated in the\nreport, though a note made by the shorthand writer shows\nthat the conditions of light were sufficient for him to see the\nposition of the medium's hands as well as her feet under the\ntable. A series of movements of the small table followed,\nincluding several levitations, but the control of the medium's\nleft foot was felt by C. at the time to be unsatisfactory. His\nnote, as well as F.'s, on this subject should be referred to.\nIt seems possible, in the light of subsequent experience, that\nthe unsatisfactory impression made upon us by this seance was\n\f378 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggcdly, and H. Garrington. [part\nclue chiefly to the attitude of extreme hostility into which\nwe had been thrown by what we believed to be the fraudulent\nconduct of the medium in the early part of the seance, and\nto the fact that the light was so much less good than at the\nprevious seances.\nNo deliberate conscious fraud was proved, and the utmost\nthat can be said is that, taken by itself, the seance must be\nregarded as inconclusive.\nA group of four clear glass electric lights has been arranged in the\nsame position as the single burner in the previous stances, and by\nmeans of a commutator, the, light can be varied through lamps of\n110, 150, 3:?0 and SJ\/,0 volts, the current being 110 volts.

She thereupon said that she would like to repeat them.\nSee C.'s note below.\nNote by H. Carrington.\nA complete description of our third seance is extremely difficult.\nNot only were the phenomena of a somewhat different order, but the\nwhole conduct of the seance was altered. Further, our subjective\nsensations\u2014the whole atmosphere of the seance \u2014were entirely different\nfrom those which we experienced on the two previous occasions. On\nlooking back on this seance, I cannot help feeling that some, at least,\nof the phenomena were genuine, \u2014notably the blowing of the curtains.\nBut on the other hand, I must record the fact that the seance reads far\nbetter than it appeared to me at the time. Throughout the whole of\nthe latter part of the seance, we were certainly dissatisfied with the\nphenomena and the control, though the notes would not seem to\nindicate this, I, especially, was dissatisfied with my foot control,\nand there seemed to me to be a long continued effort on the part\nof the medium to substitute one foot for the other. Also, on two\noccasions, there were perfectly clear substitutions of hands, followed\nin one case by a fraudulently produced phenomenon which was\nobvious to me, on whose side it took place. The difference between\nthe apparently genuine and the spurious phenomena struck me very\nforcibly at the time, and I felt that it would be quite impossible to\nconfound the two.\nThe seance was, on the whole, a bad and disappointing one.\nIn the first place, the medium insisted on almost total darkness\nduring the greater part of the seance, whereas she had permitted\nvery good light on both the previous occasions. In the next place,\nshe held our hands under the table instead of upon its surface, as\nduring the former seances. The position of the hands was often\nthe most favourable for substitution. Moreover, the whole bearing\nand manner of the medium were different. Instead of her usual\nlanguid condition, she remained, during the time of the suspected\n\f392 E. Feilding, W. W.

[part\nphenomena, quite bright and energetic, with no tendency, apparently,\nto go into trance, and was not in the least fatigued at the termina-\ntion of the seance, as she had been on the two previous occasions.\nMy own impression is that she was endeavouring to see how far she\ncould carry fraud without detection, \u2014to \"test\" us, in fact, \u2014and to\u00bb\nascertain whether it would be necessary to produce genuine phenomena\nin the future. That, of course, is a mere supposition. But it is\ninteresting to note in this connection that Prof. Morselli also dis-\ncovered fraud during his third sitting.\nThroughout the seance, the control of the left foot was not perfect.\nTowards the end three complete levitations of the small table took\nplace, my hand resting fiat upon the surface of the table, and the\nmedium's hand just touching it. The small table stood to the left\nof the medium and only about a foot away from her. It was,\nhowever, too dark to see whether her foot touched it or not. 1\nI\npressed down firmly with my right hand, but the table went up in\nspite of this. The upward pressure must have been considerable.\nWhen pressing downwards, I noticed that the upward pressure\ncame from the leg of the table nearest the medium, and not from\nits centre.\nAt the same time it is difficult to conceive how she could have\nreached so far with her left foot unperceived, and it is especially\ndifficult to conceive this in the third levitation, when both our hands\nwere completely removed from the table. It then appeared to rise\nup all by itself, and with no visible contact. We subsequently\nascertained by experiment, that it was impossible (for us) to levitate\nthe small table in this manner by one foot alone and without the\nassistance of the hands. During the above manifestations and\nimmediately before them, the medium kept asking me if my foot\ncontrol was good. I invariably replied that it was ; and it was very\ngood, at those moments. But during the actual levitation of the table,\nthe control became very poor, and I could only feel the pressure of\nthe toe of her foot. At this point the regular seance ended, and\nM., the stenographer, left.\nWe explained to the medium that the control of the left foot\nhad not been good, whereupon she immediately insisted on re-\npeating the experiment. She made me put my right foot across\nthe toes of both her feet, and her left hand was held in my right,\nher right hand was held by F., and her head was clearly visible.\nThe medium kept raising each foot in turn under mine, saying,\n1\nOn account of the shadow thrown by the seance table. \u2014F., Feb. 11\/09.\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance III. 393\n\" One, two ;\none, two,\" as she raised them. Yet despite all this, I\ndid not feel that the control was perfect. She would count and\nraise her feet several times, and then, suddenly, I would feel only\none foot, the right, and the left foot would be missing. I replied\nto her question by saying that the control was not good, whereupon\nI immediately felt both her feet under mine again. This happened\nseveral times. It seems only fair to add, however, that muscular\nmovements almost invariably take place during the production of\nlarge phenomena, and these, when occurring in good light, have\nevidently no direct physical bearing upon their production. It is\nperhaps unfair to assume that they are necessarily evidence of fraud\nmerely because they happen in the dark.\nNo movements of any evidential value took place, and after about\nten minutes of futile attempts the seance was abandoned and the light\nturned up. The net result of the seance is to leave on my mind\nthe impression that very skilful trickery had been employed at various\ntimes, but that fraud alone could not account for all the observed\nfacts, while it seems absolutely inadequate to account for the pheno-\nmena in the former seances, which appear to me as remarkable as\never. H. C.\n[The above note is undated, but was written within a day or two\nof the seance.]\nNote by E. Feilding.\nOn reading through, last night, the translation of the shorthand\nnotes of the third seance, we were both surprised to find what an\nentirely different impression we had retained of what had taken place\nfrom that which we derived from the notes. All the more remarkable\nmanifestations had receded in our memory, driven back by the\ncertainty that the medium had been detected in fraud ; and if, before\nreading the notes, we had been asked to give an account of the\nseance, we should certaiidy have said that it had been almost barren\nof results. This seance is largely of the same character as those\nof the Cambridge series. The light was, during a great part of it,\nvery poor ; the control of the feet was difficult ; and her hands\nwere often invisible, and in a position where substitution would be\npossible.\nFurther, the medium frequently resisted our attempts to hold\nher hands properly ; and whereas, in the former stances, they had\nbeen almost constantly in view, or firmly grasped in ours, during\n\f394 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nmuch of the third seance they were for ever moving about furtively\nin and over our hands, apparently seeking any opportunity that\nmight be presented to get free. The shorthand notes do not show\nthis, for while these manoeuvres were going on nothing happened,\nas will be seen from the long periods which elapsed without the pro-\nduction of any phenomena,\u2014notwithstanding the occasional outbursts\nresembling a feu de joie at a firework display. On two occasions she\nsucceeded in freeing her right hand. Only one of these appears in\nthe notes, for though the release of the hand was each time perceived\nat once by C, on whose side it took place, he preferred to watch\nevents silently ; as on the first occasion it occurred no phenomenon\nfollowed it.\nThe introduction of the stocks apparatus had also a marked\neffect on the behaviour of the table. This, during the first two\nseances, had been in almost constant movement, and levitations, whole\nor partial, had followed one another closely. During the third seance,\non the other hand, it remained motionless for long periods together,\nand the impression upon our minds was that the use of the apparatus\nhad floored the medium. The notes, however, show that several\ncomplete levitations did, in point of fact, take place, which cannot be\naccounted for by any substitution of hands. Substitution of feet,\neven if it took place, could not have assisted the production of a\nlevitation of the seance table guarded as it was by the stocks; besides\nwhich, two levitations took place while I held her feet and could see\nher knees under the table. The only other conceivable method by\nwhich the table, under the conditions, could have been lifted, would\nbe by a hook under the skirting board that runs round the top of\nthe table. A pull diagonally upwards with a hook so placed would\nhave the effect of steadying the front legs of the table against the\nstocks, and would raise all its four legs from the ground. The\nobvious suggestion that Eusapia uses a hook can, however, only be\nmade by some one who has not assisted at her better stances, and\nis of a cast with most of the other suggestions made by absent critics\nof her more remarkable phenomena. She certainly used no hook in\nthe two previous seances. The conditions of light at the third were\nso bad that I cannot affirm, with certainty, that she did not use\none then, and I prefer to come to no conclusion as regards these\nlevitations.\nThere remain the touches on my hand and side, and the pulls on\nC.'s sleeves; also the movements of the curtain, the noises within\nthe cabinet, and the levitations of the small table. The fraud and\n\fLix.] Sittings with Eusapia: Stance III. 395\nthe constant apparent attempt at fraud which had been noticed had\nso affected our minds that we had completely forgotten a great por-\ntion of these until we read the notes. It appears from the notes,\nhowever, that only the levitation of the small table can be accounted\nfor by any manoeuvres of substitution, whether of hands or feet.\nIf we assume, therefore, for the present, that genuine phenomena\nexist, the conclusion to be drawn from the third seance appears to be\nthat to which many other observers have previously come : namely,\nthat on certain occasions Eusapia seeks to produce simple phenomena\nby the easiest method,\u2014fraudulent substitution, \u2014and when prevented\nfrom doing so, succeeds in producing far more difficult ones by\nsome means unascertainable.\nE. F., Nov. 28th, 1908.\nSupplementary Note by E. Feilding.\nOn re-reading the foregoing notes while preparing the report\nfor press, I wish to state, in fairness to Eusapia, that in the light\nof subsequent seances, I, personally, am now disposed to give an\nentirely different interpretation to the incidents of this one. It is\nnevertheless a satisfaction to me that these notes exist as a record\nof our critical, indeed hostile state of mind. The first two seances\nhad in fact left no enduring mark upon us. They had astonished\nus, puzzled us, vexed us. They had shown us that the problem\npresented by Eusapia's phenomena was not the simple matter\nwhich, before we witnessed them, we had, in the invincible conceit\nof every new critic of such things, supposed it. Conviction is,\nafter all, an emotional and not an intellectual process; and the\nimpression left by the first two seances was purely intellectual.\nThe ordinary effect of the sudden confrontation of a fairly balanced\nmind with a merely bizarre fact is a reaction : the mind rejects\nit, refuses to consider it. And the more bizarre the fact, the\nstronger the reaction. If the possessor of such a mind were, for\nexample, in the course of a walk down Piccadilly, to see a\npoliceman levitated across a motor omnibus, no permanent impression\nas to the mutability of the laws of gravitation affecting policemen\nwould remain with him. The emotional certainty produced by his\nlong continued previous experience that policemen do not do\nsuch things would be stronger than any degree of intellectual\ncertainty that this particular policeman did, and would presently\nefface it. And so it was with ourselves. Tables, we knew, or\n\f396 E, Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nthought we knew, do not go into the air by themselves, curtains\ndo not bulge out without some mechanical agency ; and although\nwe saw them do so, we still refused to believe that they did.\nWe preferred to believe that we had been deceived in some way\nunknown, that we had been hallucinated, or had wrongly observed.\nWe doubted our senses rather than our experience ; were guided,\nin fact, by our emotions rather than our observation. Hence, at\nthis seance we hailed with a kind of relief the fact that Eusapia\nhad been caught substituting one hand for the other, and we\nregarded all the incidents that followed through the atmosphere\nof suspicion which this discovery had fortified. The result was\nthat not only did we colour up certain possibly quite innocent\nactions into almost clear evidence of fraud, but certain other\ninteresting and indeed inexplicable phenomena, such as the outburst\nat 11.45, occurring in light III. which ensured the absolute\nvisibility of her head, while her hands were bound and her feet\nseparately accounted for, passed out of our memory completely.\nLet me now consider the fraudulent action which produced on us\nsuch marked psychological consequences and see what it really\namounted to. She approached her hands to one another, used\npart of her left hand held imperfectly by me to cover part of\nC.'s hand, raised her right hand from his and lifted it aver her\nhead to touch the curtain. C. not only heard the action by the\ncracking of her dress, but saw it. If the action was fraudulent in\nintent it was remarkably ill-done. She then replaced her hand ;\nand presently again removed it, took hold of the curtain to her\nright, and pulled it, very obviously to C. (though not to me, as I\nwas on the other side of her) over the table. We at once told her\nthat she must not do this kind of thing and during the rest of\nthe seances she apparently did not again attempt it, except on two\noccasions, once in the 11th seance, when, after making a similar\nsubstitution, she removed her left hand, in a light good enough\nto enable me (sitting on this occasion to her right) as well as\nthe lady controlling on her left, at once to see it, waved it\nslowly in the air towards the curtain, and returned it; and once\npossibly in the 4th, in complete darkness, when I am not certain\nthat in fact she did do it, and when, in any case, no phenomenon\naccompanied it.\nWe subsequently observed that it was a habit of hers occasionally\nto wish either to touch the curtain, or to put it over the seance table.\nWith the exception of the cases above mentioned she invariably either\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance III. 397\nasked permission to do so, or called our attention to the fact that she\ndid do so, a fact, for the rest, which was anyhow quite sufficiently\nobvious. I cannot explain why she wished to do these things, any\nmore than I can explain many other items in her procedure, such\nas why she should wish to have a table, or why she should require\na curtain at all. I find, in talking with friends, that when I\nmention the curtain, they inevitably say, \" Ah, a curtain ! Why\na curtain'? What a suspicious fact!\" I agree that it may be\nsuspicious, but it is not necessarily so. It is suspicious when\nused by a materializing medium who goes behind it, and, when a\n\"spirit\" comes out, refuses to allow spectators to ascertain whether\nhe is himself still there. But in Eusapia's case, where she sits\noutside it, I cannot see that, given certain obvious precautions,\nit is necessarily suspicious. She says it helps to \"concentrate\nthe force.\" Perhaps it does. I do not know what the \"force\"\nis, nor what it requires to \"concentrate\" it. Nor does an}' one\nelse. To a person ignorant of photography it is possible that\nthe use by the photographer of a black cloth over his head\nwould be suspicious. In dealing with an unknown force one can\nonly judge empirically of the utility of certain conditions. That\nthe curtain does have some bearing on the phenomena is clear,\nas nearly all of them seem to radiate from behind it. Eusapia\nappears to be en rapport with something within. And she constantly\nseems to experience the necessity of establishing this rapport by\nmomentary contact with the curtain or by enveloping the table\nor part of herself in its folds. We never perceived, however,\nthat the phenomena which followed this action had any normal\nrelation to it whatever. I have come, therefore, to feel it possible\nthat, so far as our own series of experiments is concerned, the cases\nof hand-substitution practised were innocent in intent, though\nfraudulent in appearance ; that she wished to do what, after\nobtaining our previous consent, she otherwise frequently did, \u2014touch\nthe curtain or pull it over the table, \u2014and did it, half automa-\ntically and without consulting us, though without any intention of\nproducing a spurious phenomenon. It is necessary to say that never\nonce, in the course of hundreds of phenomena, did we detect a single\ncase of undoubted fraud, and it is my personal belief at present that\nthough there were many phenomena which must be classed as non-\nevidential, there were in fact none which we should be justified in\nthinking to be probably spurious. I do not know how far C, who\nis now in America, or B., will endorse this opinion. But I think\n\f398 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Cwrington. [part\nit probable that C. will now admit that in his above note to\nthis stance, in which he contemplates the possibility of Eusapia\nhaving produced the levitations of the small table with the foot\nwhich he was intently attempting to control, he did himself\ninjustice as an observer ; as he must also admit that in writing\nthat the 'greater part of the s6ance took place in almost total\ndarkness,' when as a matter of fact the darkness only endured\nfor 38 minutes (10.24 to 11.2) out of a period of more than\ntwo hours, he did so under the influence of the psychological\nimpression produced by Eusapia's behaviour rather than in accordance\nwith the exact facts.\nE. F., Feb. 12th, 1909.\nSupplementary Note by H. Carrington.\nA few additional words are necessary from me in reply to F.'s\nnote.\nOne of the most essential things to learn in connection with\nEusapia's sittings is that there is on the medium's part a constant\nsemi-automatic attempt to produce phenomena, which, if checked and\ncontrolled, will result merely in a synchronous movement of the\nhands or feet ; but which, if allowed full play, will result in an\nautomatic movement, which might well be mistaken for conscious\nfraud. That was the interpretation we put upon all such actions\nof hers in our early stances, \u2014perhaps naturally enough. Looking\nback on the seances in the light of what I can only think a fuller\nknowledge of the medium and her phenomena, I must say that I\nam disposed to construe these acts of hers in very much the same\nway as F. ; and that I now consider my earlier hyper critical attitude\nunwarranted. Having heen convinced by later seances that genuine\nphenomena do unquestionably take place, I think it probable that\nmany of the earlier phenomena, put down by us as \" non-evidential,\"\nwere in point of fact genuine. Still, of course, for purposes of con-\nversion, the phenomena must be regarded as valueless, and cannot\nbe taken into account when discussing the seances.\nBriefly, then, I wish to say that I am now disposed to retract\nand repent my earlier critical, indeed hostile attitude; and think\nthat we should all have obtained better and more conclusive pheno-\nmena had we been less severe with the medium, and known better\nhow to conduct her seances. When one is convinced of the reality\nof the phenomena, the fascinating study of their causes, nature and\n\fLix.] Sittings with Easapia: Seance IV. 399\nconditions becomes possible. That is the point from which I should\nnow stud}' the facts, were I again to observe them. But at the\nperiod under review, we were still uncertain whether such facts\noccurred at all, or whether they were one and all produced by fraud.\nH. C, May 23, 1909.\nEemarks on Seance IV.\nNovember 29th, 1908.\nAlthough the stocks apparatus in use at the last seance\nhad rendered impossible any action of the medium's feet or\nknees in levitating the table, it did not exclude action of the\nhands, assuming that she could succeed in freeing them, or the use\nof a hook attached to her body and bearing under the skirting\nboard round the top of the table. In fact, the apparatus had\nthe effect of actually facilitating a total levitation, if either of\nthese suppositions be granted. In order, therefore, still further\nto obviate the necessity of continuous control, and to meet\npossible objections that it had not been efficient, we pasted\nnewspaper round the front and part of the sides of the table,\n1\nreaching from the top to the knee board forming the top of\nthe stocks, and also fastened Eusapia's feet to and between the\nstocks, leaving a play of about 3 to 4 inches laterally. In\nthese conditions it was impossible to lift the table except by\nthe use of both hands, one on each side of the top ;\nin other\nwords, except in the way in which a table might ordinarily\nbe lifted, or by thrusting one hand below the line of paper\ninside the tube of the stocks and seizing the leg, an easily\ndetected manoeuvre.\nThere were present, besides C. and F., Professors Bottazzi and\nGaleotti of the Naples University, Signor De Santi, a friend\nof Eusapia's, and Signori Morelli and Falanga, two friends of\nhis invited in accordance with the circumstances described in F.'s\nnote below. At the beginning, C. controlled on the medium's\nleft ; F. on her right. Eusapia showed much dislike to the\nprecautions taken and especially to the paper. She also seemed\nin bad health, and in the early part of the seance coughed\nconstantly. The table movements for a long time were feeble\nand non-evidential, except one tilt at 9.39 p.m. which was\n1\nSee photograph, p. 375.\n\f400 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and If. Carrington. [part\nwithout contact and in good light. The light was constantly,\neither in obedience to raps asking for less light or at the\nmedium's request, lowered down and up again, during the first\n25 minutes, and was eventually, at 9.54, reduced to nothing-\nexcept the shaded photographic lamp on the stenographer's\ntable, i.e. practically complete darkness. Shortly afterwards she\nasked F. to change with Prof. Bottazzi. Then followed a\ncomplete levitation. It is unfortunate that owing to the general\nconversation which constantly went on at this seance, the notes\nfail to report the position of the medium's right hand, though\nProf. Bottazzi always expressed himself satisfied with his control.\nThe prevailing darkness renders the evidence for this and a\nsubsequent repetition of the same phenomenon unsatisfactory.\nHaving performed two levitations, Eusapia showed her annoyance\nat the paper by tearing it, and the table was reversed. She\nthen made C. and Prof. Galeotti change places.\nExcept as taken in conjunction with others held under better\nconditions, the first part of this seance, by reason of the dark-\nness and the insufficient reporting of the control, must be dis-\nregarded for evidential purposes, though an exception may fairly\nbe made for certain individual phenomena, e.g. the appearance\nof something white in better light at 10.55 p.m. and 11.2:\nthe transportation of the small table from the cabinet over the\nmedium's shoulder partly on to the seance table at 11.9 p.m.\nThe action of head and hands is clearly eliminated by the\ncontrol described: the left foot alone remains as a possible normal\nagency, the feet having by this time been released. Owing to\nthe balance and weight of the table, it seems to us, after practice,\nan impossible feat to perform in this way, even supposing that\nProf. Galeotti could fail to notice the removal of the left foot\nfrom his right, and the strong effort necessary to put her foot\nbehind her chair between the curtains and raise the table so\nhigh witli it. The improbability of this is also greatly increased\nby the fact that the small table was lifted in this way three\ntimes in seven minutes.\nAt 11.35 Prof. Bottazzi and also Eusapia's friend and the\ntwo gentlemen who accompanied him left. F. resumed control\nof the medium's right, Prof. Galeotti remaining on her left.\nThen followed some very prolonged and remarkable partial\nlevitations of the table, of which, however, on account of the\n\fltx.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance IV. 401\npoor light and the possibility of at least some of them being\nmerely effects of balance (though, at the time, this certainly\nappeared not to be the case), we prefer not to offer any\nopinion. A very remarkable complete levitation under appar-\nently perfect conditions of control, while C. was under the\ntable holding the medium's feet, her hands being well accounted\nfor, and all standing up, occurred at 12.5 a.m.\nAt 12.9 an apparent attempt to make a substitution of hands\nis reported. F. was, however, by no means sure of this, and\nnothing followed. Shortly afterwards, but under conditions of\napparently complete control, Prof. Galeotti experienced a series\nof touches. The head control is, it is true, not mentioned, but\nwe are convinced that these touches were not and could not\nhave been thus produced, the position of the medium's head\nbeing, even in this faint light, clearly visible. At 12.16 a\npartial levitation of a remarkable kind took place, and at 12.18\na series of movements in the cabinet followed by an attempt\nof the tambourine to jump from the floor to the medium's\nright on to F.'s lap, which appeared quite unaccountable by\nnormal means.

F.,\nDec. 1\/08.]\nNote by H. Carrington.\nThe general impression left on my mind by this seance was one\nof uncertainty and general irritation, due more, however, to the fact\nthat we were not ourselves controlling during the actual production\nof the phenomena than to the character of the phenomena themselves.\nHad we been controlling, we should certainly have considered the\nseance a remarkable one ;\nbut, absurd as it may appear, we did not\nfeel the same degree of confidence in the results as if we had been\ncontrolling the hands and feet ourselves. Doubtless this was partly\ndue to the extremely poor light upon which Eusapia insisted ;\npartly\nto the difficulty of extracting descriptions of the control from her\nholders ;\npartly to the constant talking of one or more of the other\nsitters, who sat at the far end of the circle. It is perhaps excus-\nable that under these conditions, we should not feel the same degree\nof confidence in the results as we might otherwise have done.\nSome of the phenomena that took place at this seance, especially\ntowards the end, were certainly remarkable. It is of great interest\nto note that all the best phenomena were obtained after Eusapia's\nfriends had left, and when only Prof. Graleotti and F. and myself\nremained. When F. and I were controlling the right and left sides,\nrespectively, the very best phenomena of all took place. It is\nhardly necessary to point out that such a state of things is precisely\nwhat we should not expect, had the medium resorted to fraud, or\nhad her friends been in collusion with her. Under the very best\nconditions of control the veiy best phenomena of all occurred. This\nwould seem to confirm most strongly the conclusion to which I\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance IV. 417\nhave been driven by a study of Eusapia, viz. : that so long as\nsuspicion of the medium's honesty is not openly manifested, the\ncloser the contact and the more perfect the control, the better will\nbe the results. H. C, Dec. 7th, 1908.\nNote by E. Feilding.\nIf Eusapia's psychology is a puzzle to us, we find that our own\nis scarcely less so. The mythopoeic tendency of the mind appears\nto act with us inversely. Instead of the marvellous becoming\nexaggerated in our memory, we discover that the slightest unfavour-\nable elements tend to obliterate the recollection of it altogether.\nFor this reason, except for the evidence of the notes, the fourth\nseance has left in our minds no enduring impression of any\nphenomena of interest whatever. The reason for this is as follows :\nEusapia had told me that if we really wished to see higher\nmanifestations of materializations, etc., we should have to provide\nourselves with a larger circle, and should include in it someone\nwho was accustomed to her methods, who could direct the seance and\ncould supply the necessary sympathetic \"current.\" She mentioned,\nas one possessing a \" current \" beyond reproach, a friend of hers, a\nchemist, who would, if asked, bring two of his friends, in conjunction\nwith whom surprising results had been obtained. Her argument\nwas this : If full materializations took place, while we should\nsacrifice proper scientific control of the minor phenomena, we should\nbe favoured with evidence of such a kind as would obviate the\nnecessity of detailed control altogether.\nWe accordingly visited the chemist to make a preliminary inspection.\nHe proved to be a person of cultivated intelligence, and appeared pos-\nsessed of a thoroughly reasonable temper. He said that while he thought\nit would be better that we should first come to some conclusion as to\nthe possession by Eusapia of some supernormal gifts by experiments of\nour own, and alone, he would be quite willing, if we wished him to do\nso, to come himself and to bring his friends, and see if he could assist\nin the production of the \" higher phenomena.\" Under the glamour\nof his account of these, we decided to set aside scientific caution\nand accept his offer, and we further invited Professors Bottazzi and\nGaleotti, Professors of Physiology and Pathology respectively at the\nNaples University, who had conducted, with the utmost scientific\nelaboration, a number of sittings with Eusapia, and were much\ninterested in her case. We thus had an addition of five to our\nusual number.\n2d\n\f418 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [pakt\nAfter a short time Eusapia requested the Professors to undertake\nthe control in our places. Owing to their unfamiliarity with our\nmethod of dictating, and to a natural hesitancy in doing so in\na foreign language, but owing chiefly to the loquacity of the\nchemist's two friends, who talked loudly throughout the sitting,\nand to the fact that the light was lowered gradually to the merest\nglimmer, the shorthand writer was presently reduced to a state of\ndespair, ourselves to one of exasperation. The table had been\nplaced in the stocks, Eusapia's feet tied elaborately, paper had been\nso adjusted at her end that a fraudulent levitation seemed impossible.\nIn the course of the seance Eusapia complained that the paper\nworried her, and the table was accordingly turned round. Of course,\nwe regarded this as suspicious : we again believed we had cornered\nher. The discord of the proceedings was complete, and at their\ntermination we were fully under the impression that practically\nnothing had occurred, until after the departure of all except Prof.\nGaleotti, when many remarkable levitations followed one another\nrapidly. On reading the notes we were greatly surprised to find\nthat two full levitations of the table had taken place before it was\nturned round. For strict evidential purposes, these levitations, owing\nto the presence of Eusapia's friends, should perhaps not be relied\nupon. I have every reason, however, both ocular and experimental\nand otherwise, for believing that these gentlemen were in no way\nconcerned with the production of these phenomena. It is also\nnoteworthy that, with the exception of these two levitations and\nthose of the small table, all the more interesting phenomena took\nplace after their departure.\nNevertheless, not only for strictly evidential purposes, but also\nso far as the progress of our own convictions, in whatever direction,\nis concerned, I fear that we must write down this seance as wasted.\nE. F., Dec. 4th, 1908.\nRemarks on Seance V.\nDecember 2nd, 1908.\nThis was the first seance attended by Baggally, who had\ncome out from England in consequence of a telegram inviting\nhim to do so. At the request of the shorthand writer, Meeson,\nthe attendance of Mr. Gibson, a friend of his, resident in\nNaples, hitherto unknown to the medium, was also invited.\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance V. 419\nIn order to provide a more gradual diminution of light, and\nto lessen the chances of having to sit in almost complete dark-\nness, as had occurred at the 3rd and 4th seances, a new lighting\narrangement was adopted. The original No. I. light, (i.e. the\nordinary light in the room, which during seances I. and II.\nhad been shaded with 3 thicknesses of tissue paper, and\nat the 3rd and 4th was not used at all), was discarded,\nand in its place the former jSTo. II. light, shaded with one\nthickness of tissue paper, was substituted. The light was some-\nwhat less than the former No. I. thrice shaded, but it was\nstill possible to read the Baedeker and Italian dictionary at\nour places at the table, though with some difficulty, while from\nthe furthest end of the room, distant about 13 ft., the face of a\nperson and its varying expression, closing or opening of eyes,\netc., was distinguishable. The No. II. light was the former\nNo. III. (see Seance III., p. 378). Nos. III. and IV. were two\nruby glass bulbs of 110 and 140 volts respectively. The\nmedium objected to the red glare of the former, and it was not\nused at this seance, while light No. IV. which prevailed during\na great part of the seance, gave a light sufficiently strong for\nC, seated about 4 feet from the medium, to see her features\ndistinctly.\nNo apparatus to guard the table was used, nor was the\nmedium tied in any way, yet there was only one total levita-\ntion of the seance table, and that a non-evidential one, towards\nthe end of the seance. The phenomena were of a different\nclass, and showed a progression.\nFrom 9.50, 6 minutes after the seance began, till 10.37,\nthere was a series of partial levitations of the table of a very\nremarkable character, often very prolonged, the table rising on\none or two legs, frecpiently without any contact on the part\nof the medium, and remaining tilted at an angle, sometimes\nresisting downward pressure of considerable force, against which\nit rose in an elastic kind of manner. See the shorthand report,\nespecially at 10.32, when C. was holding the medium's feet\nat her request (she having apparently become annoyed at his\nobviously suspicious attitude) under the table.\nFrom 10.37 to 10.44 a series of movements of the right\ncurtain occurred: hitherto, except on the occasion at Seance III.\nwhen the medium herself pulled the right curtain over the\n\f420 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\ntable after making substitution of hands, it had always been\nthe left curtain which moved.\nFrom 10.5 'J onwards there were a series of movements of\nthe small table and of other objects behind the curtain, cul-\nminating at 11.8 by the small table striking B. on the\nshoulder and upsetting completely, the medium being rigorously\nheld, visible and motionless.\nAt 11.10 an entirely fresh phenomenon occurred, viz. the\nappearance over the medium's head, from between the two\ncurtains, of a hand, dead white in colour. It came somewhat\nslowly out, palm downwards, then clenched its fingers and\nwithdrew again between the curtains, the medium's own hands\nbeing held separately and distinctly by B. and F.\nAt 11.18 a black head with large features shot rapidly out,\napparently from the further side of the right curtain.\nAt 11.22 the small table in the cabinet again began to\nmove, and presently came over the medium's right arm and\nlanded on the seance table, both the medium's hands and legs\nbeing under control and her head visible.\nAt 11.28, the small table having been replaced on the floor\nby C. outside the curtain to the left of B., it made a series\nof movements fully described in the shorthand report, which\nshould be referred to.\nAt 11.38 another new phenomenon occurred, viz. the pro-\nduction of something solid and tangible within the curtain,\nlike a hand, which, while C. held his own hand against the\ncurtain two feet above the medium's head, pressed against it\nfrom within, at intervals through a space of about 10 minutes.\nThe medium, while this was going on, was lying, apparently\nin a state of deep trance, in F.'s arms, and her hands were\nheld separately by F. and B.\nAt 11.51 the small table, which had receded again behind\nthe curtain near B., to the right of the medium, was suddenly\nlevitated over her head and came down on the seance table\nto her left, between her and F., her hands being held, her\nlegs and feet separately controlled, and her head visible and\nmotionless.\nAt 12.03 a further series of partial levitations of the seance\ntable, including one total levitation under not very good\nevidential conditions, occurred, and the seance terminated at\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance V. 421\n12.12. At its close, the medium appeared extremely exhausted,\nand remained for some time in a semi-trance-like state. During\nthis, she called attention to a breeze, which apparently issued\nfrom a scar under her hair on the left side of her brow. Of\nthis singular incident a fuller description will be found in the\nshorthand report and in the notes.\nShorthand Report of Seance V.\nDecember 2nd, 1908.\nArrangement of objects in the cabinet: Small table, standing.\nLittle stool to left and behind medium in cabinet.

Feilding.\nThroughout the whole of our previous seances, Eusapia had been\nconstantly in a state of nervous anxiety to know, at every moment,\nwhether we held her properly. \"E buono il controllo ? E buono il\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance V. 437\ncontrollo?\" (\"Is your control good?\") was repeated often many times\na minute, especially during the third seance. In vain we urged her to\nleave that to us, and to go quietly off into her trance, and let come\nwhat might. At the third seance, when we actually caught her playing\nher old trick of substituting one hand for two, we immediately told\nher of it. She discussed the matter with seeming frankness. She\ntold me of an occasion when Colonel de Rochas had caught her in a\nsimilar manner, and said that she was unaware that she had done\nit. In view of the Cambridge sittings, it seems probable that this\nis something less than the truth. Nevertheless, from conversations\nwith her, her husband and her friend Signor de Santi, who at once\nadmitted that he had often noticed this trick, as well as from the\nreports of former observers, we gathered the impression that it is,\nat all events, a hypothetical possibility that her frauds, skilfully as\nthey are performed, are resorted to in a spirit of mischief while in\nher waking state, and perhaps half unconsciously while in her semi-\ntrance state, and that no very severe moral blame, in a woman of\nher temperament, is necessarily attachable to them. We therefore\npromised her, if ever we actually caught her tricking, at once to\ntell her.\nOn Nov. 30th the Report of the Paris Institut Glniral Psycho-\nlogique on their experiments with Eusapia reached me. She had\nasked me about this and expressed interest to know whether it was\nfavourable or the reverse. I accordingly went to see her and told\nher frankly that while, on the whole, the conclusions must evidently\nbe read as implying a belief in the possession by her of some\nabnormal faculty affecting matter, the report nevertheless stated\nthat, on a few occasions, she had been caught resorting to fraud.\nShe was in no way disturbed and merely said, when I offered to\nshow her the Report, that she did not want to hear the details, as\ncharges of this kind might produce a suggestive effect which would\nbe harmful to her and tend to make her repeat the offence.\nThe result of our conversation, however, was satisfactory. She did\nnot, as in the third seance, constantly keep asking if the control\nwas good, but appeared never to trouble about it at all, resigned\nherself quietly to our keeping and for the first time went off into\nwhat appeared to be a deep trance state. Nor did she, as in the\nthird seance, constantly attempt to evade control. She allowed\nher hands to be firmly held : her feet were generally motionless,\nand the light was always sufficient to see the exact whereabouts of\nher face, as well as of her hands, even from the further side of the\n\f438 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\ntable. Whatever be the means by which the white hand and the\nblack face seen by C. and me, and the hand felt by C. within\nthe curtain, were produced, I am absolutely certain that the use of\nher head or of the hand or foot on my side was not in question.\nB. is equally certain so far as the hand or foot of his side are\nconcerned.\nThere remains the hypothesis of an apparatus concealed about\nher, and actuated in some manner inconceivable to me. We\nshall be told we ought to have searched her. We ought. She\nherself suggested, after the seance, that we should. Whether it was\nthe fact that she herself proposed it that disarmed us, or a not\nunnatural disinclination to submit her, while just recovering, with\nevery symptom of exhaustion, from a state of deep trance, to what\nwe understand from other reports has invariably proved a vain\nquest, I cannot say. It is clear that another time, we must, in the\ninterests of accuracy of evidence, harden our hearts.\nE. F., December 4th, 1908.\nNote by H. Carrington.\nHaving yielded my control to B. early in the evening, I am\nnot in so good a position to speak of that as he : but there can be\nno doubt that it was exceptionally good throughout the seance.\nI can, however, speak with certainty of the levitations of the small\ntable and of the touches through the curtain towards the end of\nthe sitting. With F. and B. closely guarding her hands and feet,\nher head being visible, and with a clear space between the table\nand her body, the small table was completely levitated several times\nunder my hand, in a way quite inexplicable by me, and in a peculiar\nmanner impossible to duplicate by fraudulent means, so far as I can\njudge. The touches, also, were certainly effected by a material and\nresponsive agent, which pushed strongly against the curtains, just\nunder my hand, and, later, against my hand, through the curtains.\nMy hand was held up at a distance of quite 2h feet above the\nmedium's head, and both B. and F. were positive of their separate\ncontrols, which they several times verified, during the actual pro-\nduction of these touches. There was also a clear space between\nher body and the curtain. The phenomena appeared to me very\nremarkable at the time, occurring, as they did, under what I must\nconsider exceptionally fine conditions, as regards hand and foot\ncontrol. H. C, December 7th, 1908.\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance V. 439\nNote by W. W. Baggally.\nNo perfect levitation of the table (that is, the rising of the four\nlegs of the table from the floor at the same time) took place at\nthis seance, and most of the levitations that occurred could not be\nconsidered evidential, since one or both hands of the medium were\nin contact with the table when it was rising.\nThere were, however, two cases which offered, to my mind, good\nevidence of a supernormal force being at work ;\nviz., those which\noccurred at 10.13 and 10.24 (vide Report) when Eusapia had not her\nhands in contact with the table, and her feet were under control of F.\nand C. in one case, and of F. and myself in the other. It is doubtful\nwhether the levitation that took place at 12.6 (when the legs of\nthe table close to Eusapia were off the floor and the side of the\ntable further away from her rose up in the air), was produced super-\nnormally, since, although she was standing up at the time, and both\nher feet were controlled, I found, subsequently that while holding the\nrim of the table in the same manner that the medium did, I could, by\nplacing my bent knees against the table legs, or pressing the sides\nof my knees against the interior sides of the table legs, cause the\nfurthest side of the table to rise when pulling the table with my\nhands towards me. I cannot assert that Eusapia resorted to this\nmethod. My impression is that she did not,\nI feel positive that the medium's right hand and right foot\nwere not used in the production of any of the phenomena which\ntook place in the cabinet. I continuously kept control of her\nright foot and right hand and also kept my knee against her\nknee, with the exception of the experiment at 10.57 when F. had\ncontrol of both her legs. On two or three occasions when I felt\nthat her knee was not touching mine, I broke the \" chain,\" that\nis, I released my right hand from Mr. Gibson's hand and then\npassed my right hand under the table and felt with it Eusapia's\nright leg, from the knee downwards, to assure myself that no\nsubstitution of feet had taken place, and that it was the foot of\nher right leg that was resting on my left foot.\nNo substitution of hands took place at this seance. I frequently\nverified that it was the medium's right hand that I held in, or that\nwas resting on, my left hand, by feeling her thumb and the palm\nof her hand. Moreover, the light was sufficiently good for me to\nsee her right hand when it rested on the table. It is also to be\n\f440 E. Feilcling, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nobserved that her hands were too far apart from each other to\nallow of substitution.\nThis was the first seance of the series that I attended. I formed\nno opinion as to the character of the phenomena, but was much\nimpressed by the results obtained under the strict conditions that\nwere imposed. W. W. B., Dec. 3rd, 1908.\nRemarks on Seance VI.\nDecember ith, 1008.\nThis seance, by reason of the number of phenomena and\nthe rapidity with which they followed one another, the\nremarkable character of many of them, and the complete con-\ntrol permitted by Eusapia, proved one of the most interesting\nof the whole series. For an hour practically nothing occurred.\nThe medium appeared vexed and suggested an alteration of\nthe light, which was accordingly changed to No. 3, the bright\nruby lamp shaded with tissue paper and a white silk hand-\nkerchief hanging over it, a light sufficient to enable F., sitting\nat the further end of the table from the medium, to see her\nhead and hands. Still nothing occurred for a further half\nhour, till at 11.35 B. was touched on the shoulder, and the\ncurtain blew out over the table.\nAt 11.38 there appeared one of those strange objects seen\nfrom time to time at Eusapia's seances, to which, for want of a\nbetter name, the word \" head \" is applied, though they are only\nvery distantly suggestive of human heads. They are of different\nsizes and shapes, sometimes shooting out of the curtain and\nback with great swiftness, sometimes with a certain deliberate-\nness, but always with absolute silence, like shadows. They are\nimpossible to describe verbally. After the seance C. attempted\nto draw his impression of this one, with approximately the\nfollowing result :\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance VI. 441\nIt shot straight out from between the curtains, turned\na sudden right angle, approached close to C.'s face, and then\nretired. This object was black ; the next appearance, a\nfew minutes later, at 11.41, coincident with a touch on\nC.'s head, was white. In both these cases the medium's\ntwo hands were separately held and under complete control.\nFurther touches followed, and at 11.50 the curtain flew out\nwith such violence that it reached the further end of the\ntable.\nIt seems unnecessary to go through the details of the\nphenomena, which are adequately described in the shorthand\nreport, but attention may be called to some of the more\nremarkable. Although touches had frequently been felt at\nprevious seances, this was the first seance at which the\nsensation of the grasp of a complete hand was experienced.\nThis occurred to all three sitters, to both C. and B. between\n11.58 and 12.5, and to F. just before and after 12.11,\nwhen he was holdino- his hand 2 J- feet above the medium's\nhead (her hands being held one on the table and one in her\nlap) and was seized by apparently living fingers, of which\nhe felt the nails, through the curtain. At about 12.18 B.\nwas seized by a hand which came from behind the curtain,\nand pulled him by the sleeve so violently that it almost\nupset him off\" his chair into the cabinet, both the medium's\nhands being separately and distinctly held by C. and B.\nVarious other appearances of objects, sometimes white, some-\ntimes grey, took place, occasionally coincident with touches\non the sitters.\nAt 12.26 F. went to stand beside the medium and held\nhis hand high over her head, with a view to ascertaining\nhow far from her the touches could be obtained. The\nattempts made to produce the touches were instructive.\nThe medium first appeared to wish to establish a rap-port\nbetween her and F.'s hand, and releasing her hand from B.'s,\nput it within the curtain and took hold of F.'s through it.\nShe then replaced her hand on B.'s on her lap. After a\nkind of head visible to C. and F. (the notes do not state\nwhether B. also saw it) had shot out and retired, a series\nof attempts were made by something within the curtain to\ntake hold of F.'s uplifted hand. Something solid pushed out\n\f442 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garringtou. [part\nover and over again aqainst the inside of the curtain against\nCO o\nthe lower side of F.'s hand, or against his wrists, but\napparently could not reach quite high enough to grasp the\nhand itself. Meanwhile, Eusapia appeared to strain upwards\noutside the curtain, raising her two hands, still held by C. and\nB., as though a sympathetic physical effort were required in\norder to direct the \" force,\" and explaining at the moment that\nthat was in fact the case. The effort, it is true, failed, and no\nactual grasp was given, but the conditions under which the\ntouches occurred and the opportunity for careful observation\nduring the long continued attempts to reach F.'s hand, the\nadequate control which existed in consequence of the visibility\nof Eusapia's head and hands and the proximity of F. to the\ncurtain, make the incident one of high interest.\nImmediately afterwards, a further appearance of a black\nhead, apparently similar to the one seen during the earlier\nportion of the seance, occurred, followed by a light inside the\ncurtain, the first luminous phenomenon that had been per-\nceived by us. This, from its position, was visible only to C.\nThe white Light II. was then, at Eusapia's request, turned\nup, and a further short series of curtain movements and of\ntouches took place. The \" cork experiment \" mentioned at\n12.55 refers to a small apparatus devised by B., consisting of\na cork suspended perpendicularly on an elastic stretched\nhorizontally between two nails fastened on a board. The\nlower surface of the cork was covered with indigo, and the\nobject of the experiment was to see if without contact\nEusapia could succeed in depressing the cork so as to leave\na mark of the indigo on the board. She tried, holding\nher hands above the cork for 2 or 3 minutes, but failed to\nproduce any effect, and, it being very late, she abandoned the\nattempt.\nThe seance then broke up and the original Light I. was\nturned up. The phenomena, however, as described in C.'s\nnote, continued. The table continued to tilt about as though\nthe \"force\" were not yet expended and it occurred to F. to\nask for a repetition of the phenomenon which had taken place\nat the 2nd seance when the guitar had been plucked. We\nwere all standing round the curtain, B. and M. talking and\nnot paying attention ; F. and C, however, listening to see if\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance VI. 443\neffect would be given to F.'s request. They both simultane-\nously heard a light twanging of the guitar which stood as in\nthe 2nd seance on the floor in the ancrle of the walls, distant\nO }\nabout a metre from the curtains.\nA description is given in C.'s note of a further experiment\nwith the \" breeze \" which, after the fifth seance, appeared to\nissue from the scar on Eusapia's brow. It may be added\nthat, witli a view to determining the objective character of\nthis breeze, we had meanwhile bought a small paper flag\nsimilar to those used for Christmas tree decoration.\nShorthand Eeport of Stance VI.\nDecember 4th, 1908.\nPresent : F., C, and B., and If., shorthand-ivriter, cd separate table\nas before.\nNo small table was put inside the cabinet.\nThe various toys were, placed, on the floor inside the curtain along\nthe walls, with the guitar standing upright in the angle.\nLights as before, except that No. 3 was shaded with one thickness\nof brown tissue paper and silk handkerchief, to diminish the\nunpleasant red glare.\n10.3 p.m. Seance began.\nM\n\f414 E.

Further phenomena,\nhowever, still occurred. See C.'s note below. F., Ap. 13\/09.]\nNote by H. Garrington.\nThe sixth seance has left on my mind an indelible impression of\nthe reality of at least some of the phenomena occurring in the presence\nof Eusapia. This relates more particularly to the touches of human\nhands, which are, in one sense, the most extraordinary and the\nmost incredible of any of the phenomena produced through Eusapia's\nmediumship. That human hands\u2014having all the peculiarities of\nhands, even to the presence of finger nails, should become visible\nand tangible during a seance\u2014these hands not being Eusapia's nor\nany of the sitters' \u2014this is so utterly at variance with common sense\nthat one finds it next to impossible to believe it. And yet these\nhands are real, and by no possible means could they have been\nEusapia's. During almost the whole time when the touches were\ntaking place she was resting her head against mine, my right\nhand being around her shoulders, her body resting against my\nbody. Her left hand, passive, was lying in my left hand, firmly\ngrasped by me, while I frequently pressed the whole of her left\narm against my body, lifted the hand to the light to make sure\nthat it was really her hand, and traced its connection with her\nbody. The hand was certainly hers, and could not possibly have\nbeen any dummy left in my care. I frequently verified that\nfact. This left hand rested the greater part of the time on\nEusapia's left knee, and was at least two feet away from her\nright hand, which B. was firmly holding tqwn the table. At no\ntime did she attempt even to approximate the hands, far less\nto effect any substitution. That was out of the question.\nBoth B. and I are absolutely certain that we continuously held\none hand of the medium (which we constantly verified was\nhers), and during the actual moment of the touch, we frequently\ndisregarded the phenomenon and turned our whole attention to\nthe control of the hands. Her feet were meanwhile held securely\nby ours under the table. But there is no doubt whatever\nthat- the touches were made by a hand and not by a foot, nor by a\n\fLIX,] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance VI. 457\nnon-living thing. I frequently felt the separate fingers and the\nthumb during the touch, and F. on one occasion distinctly felt the\nfinger nails, which pressed into the upper side of his outstretched\nfinger. Whatever may be the nature and origin of these hands, I\nam absolutely positive that they are not produced by Eusapia's\nown hands and equally certain that they were not produced by\nher head, her feet or any part of her bod}-. The theory of dummy\nhands, manipulated somehow by the medium during the trance\nstate, is the only possible normal hypothesis, but I consider that also\nquite excluded for the following reasons :\n(1) A careful search of the medium, after the seance, failed to\nreveal the presence of any such hands.\n(2) The sensation of the touch was distinctly human, and quite\nunlike the sensation that would result from a touch by a dummy hand.\n(3) Some part of the medium's body must be free in order to\nwork such an apparatus. No part of her body, however, was free,\nand no suspicious movements of the kind necessary to manipulate\nsuch an instrument were ever perceived by us.\n(4) It is almost impossible to conceive the elaborate apparatus\nthat would be necessary to produce all the effects observed by us.\nSeveral important phenomena took place at the conclusion of the\nsixth seance, after the stenographic record ends. The reason for this\nij that the stenographer ceased taking notes when the light was\nturned up, owing to the lateness of the hour (it was getting on\nfor 2.0 a.m.), but phenomena continued to take place in the light,\neven when we considered the seance closed. The right hand curtain\nblew out strongly towards B., who thereupon stated that he felt a\nhand, playing with his left side, under his arm, as though finger\ntips were gently stroking him. At this time, both the medium's\nfeet were controlled, and her head and her two hands were clearly\nvisible, in good light, above the table. She was just coming out\nof the trance state, and still somewhat bewildered.\nThe table then tilted several times, our hands resting upon it.\nThereupon F. asked \" John \" to try and pick one of the strings of\nthe small guitar, still standing in the corner of the cabinet. We all\nstood up, including the medium, who was about six inches in front\nof the cabinet curtains, her skirt not touching them, her two feet\nwere controlled by those on either side of her, and her two hands\nheld. The light was very bright and good\u2014good enough for\nus to read small print. We stood thus for about a minute, while\nB. and M. exchanged remarks upon some subject bearing on the\n\f458 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nseance. At that moment, F. and I, who were listening closely,\nclearly perceived a slight twanging sound of the strings of the\nguitar, as though fingers were playing with them lightly, but were\nunable to pull one of them with sufficient force to make it resound.\nThe attempt to play these strings was, however, quite clear and\naudible to F. and myself, who heard it at the same instant.\nAfter the medium had resumed her seat, we felt her head with\nour hands, to see if the famous \"cold breeze\" was again issuing from\nher forehead. We all clearly perceived it with our hands, placed at\na distance of about 3 inches from the medium's head. F. held\nhis hand over her mouth and nose and we all held our own\nnoses and mouths and refrained from breathing, but the breeze\nwas still distinctly perceptible. B. then held a small paper flag\nto the medium's forehead\u2014her nose and mouth, as well as our\nown, still being well covered. The flag blew right out several\ntimes, and then out so forcibly that it turned completely over and\nwrapped itself once round the flag-staff to which it was attached.\nThe objective nature of this breeze seems thus established, though\na thermometer, held to her head, failed to record any lowering of\ntemperature.\nAt the conclusion of the sixth seance, we asked the medium if\nwe might search her. She at once consented, and proceeded to\ntake off her bodice and skirt, and hand them to us for examination.\nThere was certainly no slit or other contrivance in the skirt or in\nthe bodice, and we also examined her petticoats and other under\ngarments, and felt over her body with our hands, through the few\nremaining clothes. So far as we could discover, nothing was concealed\nabout her person or her clothes.\nI have already remarked that unless the medium could succeed\nin releasing one hand, such devices would be quite useless to\nher. I am quite positive, however, that, not only were no such\ndevices concealed about her, but that her hands were not free\none instant during the actual production of any phenomenon,\nunless it is so especially stated in the Iveport : and in these cases\nthe hands were invariably visible to us. It would have been an\nexcellent occasion for the medium, had she been dishonest, to have\nconcealed such objects about her person, since our refusal to search\nher at the previous seance (owing to her extreme fatigue) might\nhave suggested to her that we should not want to search in future,\nand so she would most certainly have concealed apparatus about\nher at this particular seance, if at all.\njj q j-)\nec 7^ 1908\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance VI. 459\nNote by W. W. Baggally.\nDuring the production of the phenomena which occurred at this\nseance, the light in the room was at times lowered and raised, but\nwas always sufficient to allow of the sitters' faces being seen, and\ntheir hands also when resting on the table.\nPrecautions against the substitution of hands or feet were taken\nby C. and myself. C. had control of her left hand and foot and I\nhad control of her right hand and foot. I assured myself that no\nsubstitution of hands took place during the whole sitting by con-\ntinually feeling the thumb and palm of the medium's hand that I\nhad under control, and by this means I was certain that it was her\nright hand that was held in, or rested on, my left hand. I also\nassured myself that no substitution of feet took place by feeling the\nwhole of her right leg against my left leg, and by touching her\nknee with mine, and also feeling her right foot on my left foot.\nAs an additional precaution, I sometimes felt her two knees with\nmy right hand which I placed under the table, and her two feet\nwith my right foot.\nNo movement of objects in the cabinet took place. The\nphenomena consisted principally of the appearance of a hand, the\ntouching, grasping and pulling by it of the sitters, the appearance\nof a head, and of objects of an indefinable nature of different\ncolours, white, grey and black. I am of opinion that under\nthe conditions of strict control (and of light) described above, it\nwas not possible for Eusapia to produce these phenomena with\none of her hands, as any suspicious movement of it would have\nbeen felt or seen. Neither could she have produced them with one\nof her feet, even assuming that by substitution she had got one of\nthem free. She continued quietly seated in a natural position in\nher chair and it would have been a physical impossibility for her\nto raise one of her feet to the height above her head at which\nsome of the touches were felt. It would be absurd to imagine that\nshe had been able to transform the form of one of her feet\ninto that of a hand. F. clearly felt the fingers and nails of this\nhand. C. felt the form and movements of the fingers, and I also\ndistinctly felt the grasp of the thumb and four fingers. The pheno-\nmena followed each other rapidly. If they had been carried out\nby means of one of the medium's hands or feet, they would have\nnecessitated a series of releases and replacements of her hand or\nfoot which would have been detected at once.\n\f4G0 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nThe pivoting on Eusapia's shoulder of the lower part of the\nbody belonging to the black head which appeared after 12.40 was\ncertainly suspicious. It would suggest that one of her arms, covered\nwith some material like black cloth, was being used by her for the\nproduction of the manifestation, but as both C. and myself were\nquite sure that we had her left and right hands under perfect\ncontrol at the moment that the figure appeared, it is difficult to\nunderstand how she could have had one of her arms free. The\nfigure appeared and disappeared quite noiselessly.\nI noticed that the force or whatever it may be that produces\nthe phenomena, is capable of acting only within a limited area\nround Eusapia's body. This fact of course suggests the suspicion\nthat the limitation is determined by the distance from her body\nthat she can reach to with her arms and legs after she has effected\na substitution of hands or feet. The instance when F. placed his\nhand on the curtain above Eusapia's head (while she was under\ncomplete control of both hands and feet) in order to see how far\nfrom her his hand could be touched by the hand within the cabinet,\nspecifically proved, however, that the limitation did not depend on\nthe length of her arms or legs.\nThe phenomena were not produced by any method of conjuring\nknown to me. I have made a study of this art from my boyhood.\nJust before the occurrence of a manifestation Eusapia often observed\nthat it was about to take place, and she frequently described the\nnature of the anticipated phenomenon, and asked the sitters to be\nsure that they had, at the same time, proper control of her hands\nand feet. This procedure on her part is contrary to one of the\nfundamental rules of the conjuring art, which enjoins that the atten-\ntion of the audience should not be directed to (nor their vigilance\nincreased at) the actual moment that the necessary steps for the\nproduction of a trick are being carried out. The result on my\nmind of the two seances of Dec. 2nd and Dec. 4th is that I find\nmyself being driven to adopt, as a provisional explanation of the\nphenomena, either that they are brought about by some mechanism\nwhich is hidden about the person of Eusapia, which she is able to\nmake use of in some unaccountable manner, while her hands and\nfeet are under control, or that they are produced by some super-\nnormal means.\nAt the conclusion of the seance, we requested Eusapia Palladino\nto allow us to search her. She readily consented, divested herself\nof all her outer clothing and, while she stood on a chair, allowed\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance VI. 461\nus to feel over her body and to examine the clothing that she had\ntaken off. No mechanism (threads, hooks, wires) or anything of a\nsuspicious nature, was found upon her.\nThe supernormal explanation appears therefore to be the only\none that will meet the case, but I hesitate to accept it until I\nhave had further experiments with this remarkable medium.\nW. W. B., Dec. 6th, 1908.\nNote by E. Feilding.\nIt is singular that the impression made upon our minds by any\nparticular seance seems to vary inversely with the effectiveness of\nthe shorthand notes. Certain it is that the report of the sixth\nseance, which we went through last night, while doubtless accurately\nrecording what took place, gives a most inadequate account of the\nemotional effect of it all. We were all three completely bowled over.\nEusapia had arrived very late owing to the non-arrival of her cab.\nWhen she did come she was in a very talkative mood, and button-\nholed me at every landing of the five flights of stairs to our rooms\nto give a fresh instalment in Neapolitan dialect (I do not understand\nNeapolitan dialect) of a burglary which she had once endured.\nOur journey upstairs occupied about 25 minutes ; but it was not\nenough for the dimensions of her story, which continued long after\nwe sat down at the table. Every device failed to distract her, and\nit was very late before the first symptoms of the oncoming mediumistic\ncondition, stertorous yawns and amazing hiccoughs, gladdened our\neyes and ears. Silence at last prevailed : but nothing happened.\nWe waited patiently. The table occasionally tilted feebly; sparse\nraps, or rather bangs, were heard on the table ;\n\u2014nothing else. \" The\nphenomena lag much,\" said Eusapia. We were almost disposed to\nabandon the attempt for the night, when suddenly things began.\nI shall not, in this note, go through the seance in detail, but wish\nto record the fact that it has certainly had a very profound effect\non our mental attitude. My own frame of mind, when starting on\nthis investigation, was that, in view of the concurrent opinion of\npractically all the eminent men of science who have investigated\nEusapia's phenomena, it was inconceivable that they could, in turn,\nhave been deceived by the few petty tricks that have, from time\nto time, been detected, and that it Avas therefore probable that the\nphenomena were real. At the same time I could not believe in\nthem. All my own experiments in physical mediumship had resulted\n\f462 E. Fcilding, W. W. Baggally, and, H. Garrington. [part\nin the discovery of the most childish frauds. Failure had followed upon\nfailure. While, therefore, I tended to accept the general hypothesis\nthat the facts of so-called spiritualistic physical manifestations must,\non the evidence, be regarded as probably existent, my mental habit\nhad become so profoundly sceptical, when it came to considering\nany given alleged instance of them, that I had ceased to have any\nexpectation of finding it able to bear examination. The first seance\nwith Eusapia, accordingly, provoked chiefly a feeling of surprise\nthe second, of irritation\u2014irritation at finding oneself confronted with\na foolish but apparently insoluble problem. The third seance, at\nwhich a trumpery trick was detected, came as a sort of relief. At\nthe fourth, where the control of the medium was withdrawn from\nourselves, my baffled intelligence sought to evade the responsibility\nof meeting facts by harbouring grotesque doubts as to the com-\npetency of the eminent professors, who took our places, to observe\nthings properly ; while at the fifth, where this course was no longer\npossible, as I was constantly controlling the medium myself, the\nmental gymnastics involved in seriously facing the necessity of con-\ncluding in favour of what was manifestly absurd, produced a kind\nof intellectual fatisrue.\nAfter the sixth, for the first time, I find that my mind,\nfrom which the stream of events had hitherto run off like rain\nfrom a macintosh, is at last beginning to be capable of absorbing\nthem. For the first time I have the absolute conviction that our\nobservation is not mistaken. I realise, as an appreciable fact in\nlife, that from an empty cabinet I have seen hands and heads come\nforth, that from behind the curtain of that empty cabinet I have\nbeen seized by living fingers, the existence and position of the very\nnails of which could be felt. I have seen this extraordinary\nwoman sitting visible outside the curtain, held hand and foot by\nmy colleagues, immobile, except for the occasional straining of a\nlimb, while some entity within the curtain has over and over again\npressed my hand in a position clearly beyond her reach. I refuse\nto entertain the possibility of a doubt that we were the victims of\na hallucination. I appreciate exactly the fact that ninety-nine\npeople out of a hundred will refuse to entertain the possibility of a\ndoubt that it could be anything else. And, remembering my own\nbelief of a very short time ago, I shall not be able to complain,\nthough I shall unquestionably be annoyed, when I find that to be\nthe case. I shall be told that this sudden declaration of conviction\nis absurdly hasty, highly unphilosophical and unworthy of a student\n\fLIX.] Sittings ivith Eusapia : Seance VI. 463\nof psychical science. Perhaps it is ; but the precise moment at\nwhich conviction is reached differs in individuals not, I think, according\nto the cogency of the facts presented to them, but according to\ntheir willingness to abandon a position which they feel to have\nbecome untenable. Now, I have no prejudices whatever in favour\nof a set of ideas to which my own previous experiences, limited\nenough, happen to have led me, and am prepared to abandon\nthem at once as soon as fresh experiences come along to lead to a\ndifferent conclusion.\nSince writing the above I have read the notes of C. and B. The\nformer has apparently submitted with the same completeness as\nmyself to the evidence of facts. B., who is evidently passing through\nthe same stages as I did in my earlier seances, toys with the sug-\ngestion of an apparatus, by way of easing his mind. It would be\nan interesting problem to set before a manufacturer of conjuring\nmachines to devise an apparatus capable of producing alternatively\na black flat profile face, a square face on a long neck, and a 'cello\nlike face on a warty nobbly body two feet long; also, a white hand\nwith moveable fingers, a yellowish hand, and a hand invisible\naltogether, \u2014all these for use outside the curtain. Further, for use\nwithin, a hand with practicable living thumb and fingers having\nnails, capable of reaching high above the medium's head, of patting,\npinching and pulling hair, and of so vigorously grasping B. by the\ncoat as almost to upset him into the cabinet. Our manufacturer\nmust so construct the apparatus that it can be actuated unseen by\na somewhat stout and elderly lady clad in a tight plain gown, who\nsits outside the curtain held visibly by hand and foot, in such a\nway as to escape the observation of two practical conjurors clinging\nabout her and on the look-out for its operation. It must further\nbe of such dimensions as to be concealed about the lady while\nparading herself for inspection upon a chair, clad in her stays and\na short flannel petticoat,\nR p>> Dec 6th> 19QS_\nRemarks ox Seance VII.\nDecember 7th, 1908.\nThis seance proved remarkable in several respects ; in the\nfirst place, for a long-continued exhibition of the curious\n\" dress-swelling \" phenomenon which has been so often described\nby other observers, but which, though we had on several\n\f464 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\noccasions witnessed it, we had hitherto not had any good\nopportunity of adequately examining. This phenomenon, which\noccurred in the No. 1 light (light sufficient to read small\nprint by), continued for about a quarter of an hour, and is\ndescribed in detail in the shorthand report and B.'s note.\nIn the second place, it was the first seance, indeed the only\none, at which a hand came out from within the curtain and\nwas both felt and clearly seen. This occurred at 12.9 a.m.,\nwhen B. was grasped on the shoulder by a hand visible to\nhimself and C. (see B.'s note). Further, at 11.20 p.m. a hand\ncame out over the medium's head, visible to F., C. and M.\nfrom the stenographer's table, ringing a large tea-bell which\nhad been placed on the table inside the curtain. It attached\nit with extraordinary rapidity to the medium's hair, leaving it\nthere, and disappeared, to return about a quarter of a minute\nafterwards, detach it, ring it over the medium's head and throw\nit on to the seance table. Both the medium's hands were\nseparately and adequately controlled at the time.\nAgain, this was the only seance at which brilliant lights\nwere visible to all present. See shorthand report at 11.36 p.m.\nIt will be noticed that whereas three of the lights seen were\nof one kind, viz. a steady though very bright blue-green light\nof a certain size, the fourth was wholly different, viz. an\nintermittent sparkling light accompanied by a cracking sound,\nlike the spark between the poles of an electric battery.\nFinally, the seance was remarkable for the exceedingly suspicious\ncharacter of certain of the phenomena taken by themselves and\njudging by their appearance only, though not by the control which\nexisted at the moment of their production. Among these must\nbe included the white object like a ball of white muslin which\nappeared at 11.32 p.m.; and the persona who professed to kiss\nB. through the curtain at 12 o'clock and onwards, and shortly\nafterwards appeared twice, looking like an arm wrapped up in\nsomething black, and moving just as the medium's arm would\nif free, pivoted on her shoulder. A discussion of these pheno-\nmena will be found in B.'s note.\nMany other phenomena of great interest occurred, e.g. the\n\" white thing \" with apparently a white arm attached to it, at\n10.57 p.m.; the loud bang and three subsequent thumps of a\ndifferent quality of sound which were made on the table at\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance VII. 465\n11.1 p.m. in response to four vigorous nods of the medium's\nhead ; and the stroking by fingers of F.'s hand while behind\nthe medium's head, at 11.17 p.m., both her hands being\nseparately held in front of her.\nShorthand Report of Seance VII.\nDecember 1th, 1908.\nPresent\u2014F., C, B., and 31, shorthand writer.\nThe smcdl table has been tied to steeples in the cabinet to prevent\n\" John \" from pulling it out and upsetting things.

Feilding.\nIt is difficult to say precisely why, but last night's seance marks\na certain set-back in the process of my mental absorption of these\nphenomena. It is not that we have the impression that our\nobservation left any loop-hole for fraud on the part of Eusapia, for I\nhave never been more absolutely certain of the efficiency of our\ncontrol. More than this, owing to the disposition of the silk\nhandkerchief which hung about and below the red lamp, producing\na larger radiant surface, the light was somewhat better than at the\npreceding seance; while the manifestations themselves appeared with an\nunhurried deliberacy which admitted of far more detailed observation.\nThe set-back is probably due to the preposterous character of the mani-\nfestations themselves. For example, Eusapia had announced that some-\nbody was going to kiss B. through the curtain. Presently, the curtain\ndid approach his face, making a clicking sound, a thoroughly bad\nimitation of a kiss, such as would be made by clicking the thumb\nnail against that of the middle finger. This happened two or three\ntimes, and I asked if it were \"John.\" \"No,\" said Eusapia, \"it is\nun' altra persona.\" I then tried, with sweet words, to lure this\n\" altra persona\" to show his face outside the curtain. \"He will\ndo so,\" said Eusapia, and he did. From the extreme right of the\ncurtain there appeared a thing like a knobbed nine-pin, or like an\narm with a closed fist, wrapped up in something black. It came\nslowly towards me (who was sitting on Eusapia's left) as though\npivoted on her right shoulder, made a kind of grotesque reverence,\nabout a foot above the level of my head and retired with deliberation,\n\fLIX.] Sittings uith Eusapia: Seance VII. 479\nhaving been visible at least three seconds. I asked Eusapia who it\nwas. She said she did not know the name, but that it was a man,\nclean shaved. I complained that it didn't look in the least like a\nman, that its head was too small. As an acquaintance it would\nbe, in fact, preposterous, a face fit only for a cocoanut shy. It\nimmediately reappeared, this time larger, but still an outrage on\nany kind of humanity. I am absolutely certain of the control of the\nhand held by me. B. is equally certain of the medium's right hand,\nwhich, if the head were any arm of hers, could alone have been\nin play. What then was this ridiculous \"altra persona?\" B. has\na provisional theory. For myself I can suggest none.\nThe incident of the bell was remarkable. By measurement\nmade subsequently, the bell was situated behind and slightly\nto the right of the medium, about 2 feet from her right shoulder.\nIt announced itself by ringing for a moment in the cabinet ; it\nthen came out, appeared over the medium's head, ringing as\nit came, and remained dangling over her left ear within one\nfoot of my face. \"It's tied on,\" she said. I felt with my\nleft hand, and found that something, which, in the dim light\nseemed like a strand of muslin, but which I afterwards ascer-\ntained was probably a loose piece of velvet ribbon she wore in her\nhair, was passed through the handle of the bell and attached it to\nher hair. I watched the bell for a moment or two, and was just\nabout to untie and detach it, when I saw a naturahlooking hand\nappear quietly from behind her neck, undo the bell, ring it over\nher head and throw it on the table in front of her. While the\nhand was detaching the bell, I made no doubt but that the medium\nhad found it uncomfortable, and had freed her right hand to take\nit away. When, however, it was rung and thrown upon the table,\nit struck me as a curious action for the medium to do herself,\nand I asked B. whether he still held her right hand. He said\nhe had done so all the time. That he was mistakenly holding her\nleft hand was impossible, as this was on my corner of the table, in my\nright and perfectly visible. It must be noted that the light was\nsufficiently good for the stenographer, seated at the further side of\na separate table, and distant from the medium about six feet (by\nsubsequent measurement), to see the hand while the bell was being\ndetached.\nOf the lights sufficient description has been made in the report.\nThe first one, visible to me and to the stenographer, about a foot\nor eighteen inches above Eusapia's head, and within the curtains,\n\f480 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nas I immediately ascertained with my left hand, had the appearance\nof a brilliant self-luminous aquamarine ; of the second, on her lap,\nI only caught a glimpse ; the fourth, visible to the stenographer\nand myself, was of a wholly different character from the first, and\nresembled the sparks given off between the poles of a battery. That\nthe manufacture of these luminosities is subject to volition seems\nshown by the readiness with whicli a light appeared, at request, in a\ndifferent place, so as to be visible to the other members of the\ncircle.\nIt will be gathered from the notes that, notwithstanding the\ncareful description of the control, and our precautions in ascertaining\nthat we each held separate hands, and real hands, were unremitting\nseveral of the phenomena wore a most suspicious appearance. I\nrefer especially to the Aunt Sally kind of head, to the imitation\nkiss bestowed upon B., and to the white muslin ball and the movement\nof the curtain accompanying its movement (though the glance I\nhad of this was so fleeting that I cannot be quite sure of my\nobservation). Eusapia took a long time coming to herself when\nthe light was turned up, though she had never, during this seance,\nappeared to be in as deep a trance as during the previous one. As\nwe walked downstairs she said that she did not feel nearly so tired,\nbut that her mind was very confused and she feared that the\nseance had not been a good one. Notwithstanding the fact that\nthe programme of phenomena had been added to by the appearance\nof hands outside the curtains which did things, and of so-called\nheads which offered themselves for more detailed observation, it\ncannot be said that the impression left by this seance was nearly\nso strong as that we received from the 6th, though we are as far\naway as ever from finding the slightest ground for imputing fraud\nto Eusapia. The singular lights, of two different kinds, and appearing\nunder conditions which seem to preclude their having been produced\nby trickery, were, however, of very great interest.\nE. F., Dec. 8th, 1908.\nNote by W. W. Baggally.\nThe results obtained at this seance tend to strengthen my growing\nconviction of the supernormal nature of some of the phenomena\nproduced by Eusapia. Others, however, occurred under circumstances\nwhich, although they in no way diminish our increasing assurance of\nthe occasional exhibition of a supernormal force, suggested an element\n\fLIX.] Sittings loith Eusapia: Seance VII. 481\nof fraud, since they were not what Eusapia asserted them to be.\nThus at 12.5J- she said that the object that presented itself from\nout of the curtain was a head ; whereas in appearance it more\nresembled an arm with a closed fist, covered by some black material.\nAgain, at 12 she remarked that the sounds like the clicking together\nof a thumb and finger heard by me when my cheek was touched\nfrom behind the curtain, were kisses. The reason why we did not\nconclude that these particular phenomena were fraudulent was that\nwe were quite sure that the control of the hands and feet of\nEusapia was perfect at the time. I will return to these special\nmanifestations later on.\nAs regards the nature of my own personal control, it will not be\nnecessary to describe it in detail, as I have already done so in my\nnotes of the seances of the 2nd and 4th December. I will only say\nthat I took the same precautions to assure myself that it was really\nEusapia's right hand and right foot that I had under my charge,\nand that I did not relax my vigilance for a moment, but concen-\ntrated my attention, at the critical moment when each phenomena\noccurred, more on the control than on the manifestation.\nIt should be noted that equally remarkable results were obtained\nwhen F. and C. controlled as when F. and I, or C. and I did so.\nI attach great importance to the phenomenon that occurred at the\nvery beginning of the seance, viz. the \" gonfiamento \" or swelling\nout of Eusapia's dress which took place before and after F. had\nplaced the little stool on the floor on the left side of the medium\nin order to try and repeat the experiment which he had witnessed\nwith the late M. Curie and his colleagues of the Institut Gdndral\nPsi\/chologique in Paris. If the stringent conditions under which these\nmovements of Eusapia's dress took place are considered, it will be\nseen that this phenomenon, although not of a startling character,\nwas of great evidential value. She had hardly sat down when she\ncalled our attention to the movement of her dress. The light had\nnot been lowered : it was the strongest that we used at these\nseances\u2014not shaded. By it I could read small print and see every\nobject in the room clearly. The medium's hands rested quietly on\nthe table in full view of us all, and her feet were under the strictest\ncontrol of F. and C. We all watched the peculiar movement. The\nforce under the dress made an evidently intelligent effort to reach\nthe stool. The bulge in the garment was not a pointed one, but\nmore like what a breeze of wind would produce. The dress did not,\nhowever, swell out en masse ; it only did so at a certain part, as if a\n2 a\n\f482 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggaily, and H. Garrington. [part\nsmall balloon under the garment were pushing it towards the stool.\nF. felt right down the dress at the time of the bulging and did\nnot feel any hard object under it. Eusapia laughingly asked us to\nfind \" la macchina,\" and thereupon lifted her dress and petticoats. No\napparatus, such as a rod, which the late Dr. Hodgson suggested could\nhave been employed by her, or an india rubber tube, through which\na gust of wind could have been blown, or anything else, was found.\nAfter Eusapia had lowered her dress, the movement recommenced.\nAfter the swelling occurred the lower edge of the dress touching\nthe floor slid towards the stool in a peculiar manner. This lower\nedge repeatedly advanced and retired slowly ; at each successive\nadvance gradually diminishing the distance between it and the stool.\nI compared this sliding motion in my mind, at the time, to the\nmovement of a protuberance from the body of a unicellular organism.\nF. felt with his hand several times between the dress and the stool\nand found no attachment. Thus, the conditions of this phenomenon\nwere :\n(1) It was carried out in good light.\n(2) It was seen by all members of the Committee at the same\ntime. \u2022\n(3) No hard object was felt causing the bulge.\n(4) No attachment was found between the dress and the stool.\n(5) No mechanism was discovered under the dress.\n(6) The hands of Eusapia were in full view resting on the\ntable.\n(7) The feet were under absolute control.\nThe thumps on the table, which took place at 11.1 p.m.,\nfollowing the nods of Eusapia's head, were very remarkable. Her\nhands, at the time, were on her right lap, under control, and her\nfeet under control also. I fail to see how, under the prevailing\nconditions, she could possibly have produced a very loud sound, as\nof a blow struck with a mallet, and the thuds which followed.\nThe light that I saw at 11.45 p.m. was a bright one of a\nbluish-green colour, and of an intensity greater than that produced\nby the head of a match when rubbed between the fingers, or by\nphosphorised oil. It was a steady light. Neither F. nor myself\nperceived any indications of the smell of phosphorus.\nI had felt the touch and grasp of a hand at the previous seances.\nFor the first time, at this one, I clearly saw a hand. It appeared\nfrom behind the right-hand curtain at about 1\\ feet from the floor,\n\fSittings with Eusapia: Seance VII. 483\nadvanced towards my right shoulder and gave it a strong grip,\nafter which it disappeared behind the curtain. The hand appeared\nto be a man's hand of a natural colour, larger than Eusapia's, which\nI subsequently examined. I cannot, however, be sure of the size\nof the hand, as it is difficult to judge of the size of objects in a\nweak light.\nI will now return to the suspicious phenomena. First, before\nthe black object appeared, viz., at 12.5| a.m., the medium had\nsaid that a head was about to appear. When the object came\nout of the cabinet, it looked more like an arm covered with\nblack material, (possibly part of the cabinet curtain wound round\nit), than a head. This gave rise, in my mind, to the suspicion\nthat it might have been the arm of the medium covered in this\nmanner, but I explain below the difficulties of this supposition.\nF. made the remark that the apparition was not large enough to\nbe a head, whereupon it came out again, but was now of an\nenlarged size. Both F. and myself noticed the increase in its bulk.\nAgain, when Eusapia had said that some one was coming for\nme who would kiss me, I certainly, immediately after she had\nmade this remark, felt some hard object pressing through the curtain\nagainst my cheek, but it did not feel like a face. It felt like a\nclosed hand, and the sound that was emitted by it did not resemble\nthat of a kiss, but was more like the clicking of the nails of a\nthumb and of a finger. The difference in the sound was noticed\nby F., C, and myself. Doubtless the above phenomena have an\nelement of a suspicious nature attached to them, but in trying\nto explain them by normal means I have to ask myself how,\nunder the kind of control described in the Report, when exchange\nof hands could not take place owing to the medium's hands\nbeing kept too far apart, and when the successive phenomena\nwould require a series of releases and replacements of her hands\nwhich could not fail to be detected, it was possible for Eusapia\nto produce fraudulently the appearance of a black arm first of\none size and then of another, and also, at the same seance,\nthe appearance of a white arm, while she is dressed in a tight\nfitting black dress with tightly fastened sleeves down to her wrists.\nI also ask myself how it was possible for her, under the strict\ncontrol above indicated, to introduce her hand, undetected, behind\nthe curtain and produce the imitation of a sound of a kiss with\nher fingers. I cannot, in fact, see any way of accounting for\nthese incidents by normal means. ^ g jj ec 9^ 1908\n\f484 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nRemarks on Seance VIII.\nDecember 10th, 1908.\nTo this seance four friends of F.'s were invited. These were :\nMr. Ryan, a gentleman with a medical training whom F. judged and\nwho proved to be a particularly painstaking and shrewd observer,\nLord Sudeley and two American ladies, Signora X. and Miss Y.,\ndaughters of an eminent literary man. These ladies were asked\nto examine the medium prior to the seance in a more com-\nplete way than had previously been attempted. On her\narrival upstairs Eusapia was invited by them to submit to\nan examination in their room, to which she was first taken.\nTheir detailed report of this examination will be found\nappended to the shorthand report. On its conclusion, nothing\nof a suspicious character having been found, Eusapia was\nimmediately brought into the seance room. The small table\nwithin the cabinet was tied down as during the previous\nseance, and the disposition of the objects within the cabinet\nwas the same. The medium's feet were tied to the rungs\nof the controllers' chairs, but in such a way only as to\nprevent her reaching with them behind her own chair.\nThe seance began at 9.25, and after about 20 minutes\nvarious minor phenomena, movements and levitations of the\nseance table, began. More than an hour, however, elapsed\nbefore the manifestations became at all powerful, but once\nthey did start, they followed one another with extreme rapidity,\nmaking adequate description and note-taking extremely difficult.\nAt first they were of the usual character, movements of the\ntable, sometimes without any apparent contact by the medium,\nmovements of the curtain, often of great violence, touches on |\nthe controllers to either side, and loud noises within the\ncurtain.\nJust after 11.55 the first of a series of transportations of\nobjects which had been placed on the small table behind the\ncurtain took place. R. was controlling to the medium's left,\nand F. to her right. A violent movement of the left curtain\non R.'s side occurred, ending in its being thrown over to\nthe further end of the seance table, and the trumpet came out\non to R.'s shoulder and slid down his right arm ; the medium's\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance VIII. 485\ntwo hands being separately held at a distance from one\nanother, while the light (No. Ill,) was sufficient to enable\nher head to be continuously visible. A few minutes after-\nwards, the toy piano followed the trumpet, striking E. gently\non the head and falling violently to the ground ; and again\nat a later period, about 12.23, the board carrying a lump\nof wet clay which had originally been placed on the small\ntable in the cabinet, directly behind the medium, emerged\nfrom the extreme left of the curtain, behind R.'s right shoulder,\nlanded upon his shoulder, slid slowly down his right arm to\nthe table on which the medium was holding his right hand,\ncrossed the table, a distance of about 10 to 12 inches, and\nstopped on the top of F.'s right hand, under which was the\nright hand of the medium. '\nOf the three transportations this\nwas the most interesting, owing to the size of the object\nlifted (the board was about 12 ins. x 8 ins., and the lump\nof clay standing on it about the size of an ordinary Genoa\ncake while the total weight was 1 k. 700 gr. = 3\n-\n6 lbs.), and\nthe deliberacy of its movement, as well as to the fact that\nits progress was followed by at least one observer, C, from\nthe moment that it first appeared outside the curtain. C,\nwho was standing behind F.'s chair to the medium's right,\nfirst saw the clay at the side of the curtain near the window,\nand reports (see his note attached to the shorthand report)\nthat he saw a white opaque object about 6 ins. x 3 ins.\napparently carrying it. The degree of light can be judged by\nthe distance (6 to 8 ft.) from which he was able to see the\nclay at its first appearance, a degree of light which makes it\ninconceivable that it could have been carried by either of the\nmedium's hands, which were resting, perfectly visible, on the\ntable.\nAt 12.46 a.m. the flageolet came out, unseen however, rapped\nthree times on F.'s head, and fell on his shoulder, at a time\nwhen F. was holding the medium's right hand close to his\nface, and R. reported that he had thorough control of her left\nand very shortly afterwards the bell began ringing inside the\ncurtain and was deposited on the top of the medium's head\nfrom between the parting of the curtains, F. seeing it arrive\nthere. The only distinctly new phenomenon that happened at\nthis seance was one which took place at about 1.7 a.m. It\n\f486 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nhas already been stated that the medium's feet had been tied\nby cords attached to the rungs of the controllers' chairs. Just\nafter 1.5 a.m. (though not noted at the time) the medium,\nevidently foreseeing the phenomenon (whether fraudulently\naccomplished or not), asked F. to verify the fastenings of her\nleft foot. He stooped under the table and verified the fastenings\nof both feet and then resumed his place, with his hand on\nEusapia's head, supporting it, as she said she was tired, and\nseemed to be falling into a deeper state of trance. About\n2 minutes afterwards, a hand appeared between the parting of\nthe curtains over the medium's head and dropped upon it,\nclose to F.'s hand, a coil of rope. This proved to be the\nend of the cord which B. had originally fastened with four\ntightly drawn reef-knots round the medium's left ankle, and\nwhich F. thought he had verified just previously. See the\nshorthand report and F.'s note attached.\nIn addition to these transportations of objects, many other\ninteresting phenomena took place in the course of the seance.\nSee especially the appearance of a large white object at\n12.14 a.m., seen from opposite by F. and C, and sideways\nby E., thus probably accounting for the varying descriptions\ngiven of it by the different observers. Further, many touches\nand grasps of hands, some of them (e.g. those on C. occurring\nat about 12.47 a.m. and 1 a.m.) at a distance of about 3 feet\nfrom the curtain, and about the same from the medium in\nconditions of light and control which made it inconceivable\nthat she could have produced them fraudulently.\nShorthand Report of Seance VIII.\nDecember 10\/\/\/, 1908.\nPresent: F., B., C, Ryan, Lord Sudeley, Signora X., Miss Y.,\nand M., stenographer.\nLights as in Stance VII.\nMediums legs tied to the legs of the controllers' chairs, leaving\nfeet play.

Twt, minutes before this had happened she had asked me to\nfeel the cord of her left leg to see whether it was fastened. I put\nmy finger through the loop of her left leg and found that the cord\nwas still round it. I did the same thing to the right leg. Shortly\nafter that I put my right hand on the medium's head, and she said\nthat she was going to rest. I continuously kept my left hand on\nher right. There then appeared a white hand through the curtain\nwhich dropped something on the top of her head. It proves to be\nthe cord which had previously been fastened to the left leg.\n[\/ had tied the medium's left leg, at the narrowest part of the\nankle, with tins cord. I made four reef knots. The other end\nof the cord, I had attached to the leg and rung of the controller s\nchair in the same manner, with four reef knots, .pulled tightly.\nB., Dec. 12\/08.]\n[It did not occur to me when the medium asked one to verify\nthe fastening of her feet, tivo minutes before this incident, to do\nmore than ascertain that the ropes were still fast round her\nankles, which tvas the case, nor did it occur to me when the coil\ndropped on her head that it could possibly be the same cord.\nWhen traced by R. to the left leg of Ids chair, her leg was\nfound free. The rope was of such a kind as to be difficult to\nuntie. Similar knots on the other foot took B. about two minutes\nto untie, using both, hands. Even supposing that the medium\nhad freed her hand from R., unperceived and unremembered\nby him, it is to me inconceivable that she could have stooped\ndown and untied the knots with her left hand between the time\nthat I verified the fastenings and the appearance of the rope on\nher head, unnoticed by R. and me, the light beivg amply sufficient\nto follow any action of the kind. \u00a5., Dec. 12\/08.]\n[The rope used throughout for tying the medium was one I had\nbrought with me specially for that purpose. It was very soft\nand pliable, and a most difficult rope to untie, as the knots, when\ntied, sank deeply into the cord. C, June 30\/09.]\n1.8 a.m. C.

Baggally.\nAt this seance I did not sit at the table by the side of Eusapia\nI cannot therefore speak with the same assurance respecting the\nstrictness of the control as in my notes to the previous seance.\nThe conditions were different, owing to the introduction of other\nsitters than the members of the S.P.R. Committee. After F. and\nC. had sat for some time controlling the medium, she complained\nthat C.'s current was feeble owing to temporary ill health, whereupon\nR. took his place.\nI judged from the conversation that I had with R. that he was\na careful observer not easily deceived. His taking a part in the\nseance had this advantage, that it served to confirm the opinion of\neach of the members of the Committee that the phenomena that\ntook place in the cabinet were not produced by the hands or feet of\nEusapia.\n\f502 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nSignora X. and Miss Y. undressed the medium before the seance\nbegan and found no mechanism concealed about her person, so that\nthe seance was carried out under good test conditions. I detected\none suspicious circumstance, viz., the pulling of the curtains by\nEusapia when I was kneeling on the table and feeling for the touch\nof a hand at the time I placed my hand against the curtain high\nabove Eusapia's head. This is mentioned in the report, but I agree\nwith F. that the pulling on the part of the medium may have been\ndue to her anxiety that a hand should touch mine. At the time,\nshe kept calling, in an appealing manner, apparently to some entity\nwithin the cabinet, \" La mano, la mano.\" We have observed that\nmotions of the medium's body are often followed by phenomena at\na distance. Thus she would extend her hand or foot, while held by\nthe controller, towards the cabinet, without touching the curtains,\nexclaiming at the time \" Voglio toccare colla mano,\" or \" Voglio\ntoccare col piede \" (\"I want to touch with my hand,\" or \"my\nfoot\"), and immediately some object in the cabinet would move.\nA notable instance of this occurred during the 7th seance, when\nEusapia nodded her head, saying at the time, \" Coipo colla testa\n(\"I am going to hit it with my head\"), and, without her bringing\nher head in contact with the table, a very loud blow, as if struck\nwith a hammer, was heard, followed by three thuds synchronizing\nwith the nods of her head, her hands and feet being under control\nat the time. W. W. B., Dec. 11th, 1908.\nNote on Seance VIII. by H. Garrington.\nAlthough there were a large number of persons present at this\nseance no confusion existed, as before under similar conditions, and\nsilence and good control were maintained throughout. I gave up\nmy control early in the evening to R., who retained it during the\nrest of the evening. An exceedingly long wait before anything took\nplace ushered in some of the most remarkable phenomena we had\nas yet seen. I refer to the carrying of the board of clay on to\nthe seance table, the carrying out of the toy piano, the trumpet, the\nflageolet, etc., the details of all which phenomena are fully described\nin the report. Not being in control on this occasion, I speak\nmerely as an onlooker; but the latter part of the seance\u2014 after\nthe phenomena began\u2014appeared to me about as remarkable as any-\nthing one could well wish for or conceive.\nI was in an exceptionally good position, standing behind F., for\nseeing the transportation of the clay from the cabinet to the seance\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusoupia: Seance VIII. 503\ntable, shortly after 12.22 a.m., and, as I happened to be closely\nwatching the curtain at the time, I saw the movements of the board\nand clay very clearly. The clay appeared first at the opening on the\nextreme left, next to the white window curtains, and at a distance\nof at least three feet from the medium's chair. It must have been\nmoved to that point, (2) from its former position on the small table\nin the cabinet, (1). [It was transported from (2) to the right\nshoulder of R. H. C, June 30\/09] and then slid gently down\non to the table, until it rested at the point (3). I saw a white,\nopaque substance, about two inches broad and six inches long,\napparently carrying this clay, which came across the medium's\nleft arm, her left hand being on R.'s right. The movement of the\nclay was peculiar. It travelled slowly as though carried through the\nair, and was most certainly not thrown. It would have been an utter\nimpossibility for the medium (even supposing that she had her left\nhand free) to have placed the clay in the position in which I first saw\nit, (2), and then to have moved it on to the seance table. Had\nshe done so, the left-hand curtain, behind which her left arm must\nhave been thrust, would have been crumpled together and carried\nforward some considerable distance over her arm. Such, however,\nwas not the case. I clearly saw that the left hand curtain did not\nmove, and I am consequently quite sure that her left arm and hand\ndid not and could not have transported the clay from the left opening\nof the cabinet curtain to the seance table.\nNote by E. Feildtng on the Transportation of the Clay.\nI find I wrote no contemporary note to this seance. My recollec-\ntion is, however, perfectly clear as to the transportation of the clay.\nEusapia's two hands were both visible, her left on R.'s right near\nthe middle of the table, her right hand under my right about a\nH.

I am absolutely certain that\nneither of Eusapia's hands carried them.\nE. F., April 14th, 1909.\nSupplementary Note by E. Feilding.\nI remember rising from this seance in a spirit of acute indignation.\nOur minds had become gradually attuned to the ordinary run of\nphenomena in which the seance had been specially rich, and to the idea\nof the non-fraudulent character of some, at all events, of which we had\nbecome convinced. But it seemed little short of offensive on the\npart of Eusapia's \"spirits\" or \"fiuidic force,\" or whatever the agency\nmight be which produced them, to intrude into a series of respectable\nphenomena one of such indubitably Davenportish associations as\nthe untying of the cord. I feel sensitive to the reproach which\nwill certainly be levelled at us :\n\" If you can be so easily deluded\nby the repetition of such a fly-blown trick, your observation in other\nmatters cannot be worth much.\" The only plausible suggestion that\nI can offer is that when Eusapia asked me to verify the tying of\nher left foot, she had already contrived to release it, and crossed her\nfeet under the table, making me believe I was verifying the fastening\nof her left foot, when in reality I was verifying that of her right.\nYet the four reef-knots had been made by B., an expert knot-tier, in\na soft cord specially brought by C. for the purpose. The knots had\nbeen verified at 10.54 when R. and C. changed places, and at the\nonly other time when control might be considered relaxed, i.e. when\nE. changed places with me, I remember distinctly holding both\nEusapia's hands till E. assumed control of them. Further, the light\nwas at all times sufficient to detect any manoeuvrings on the part\nof Eusapia to untie the knots, even supposing an unreniembered\nlapse in our physical control of her. There were no knots in the\ncoil which appeared on her head, but upon the manner of their\ndisappearance I find it only possible to reserve judgment.\nE.

She then slipped over her head a\nwhite knitted cotton stay-cover. She also drew off her neck a\nwhite linen scarf a little over a foot in length and about four\ninches wide. Next came a long dark blue petticoat with white\nembroidery round the bottom. After that she took off a short white\nflannel one, and a pair of pink and brown stays.f|She then removed\na long shift of coarse white linen and stood in what one might\ncall a pair of grey, woolly, divided combinations, that is to say,\nbody and drawers, a pair of white stockings, black elastic garters\nunder her knees, and a pair of brownish coloured boots, with heels,\nwhich were only buttoned by the top button.\nEvery one of these things was thoroughly examined, including\nthe linings of bodice and skirt, and nothing was found anywhere.\nHer hair, too, was simply drawn up, tied by a narrow bit of\nblack tape, and done into a bun.\nDec. 10\/08.\nRemarks on Seance IX.\nDecember 13th, 1908.\nIn some ways this seance was the most remarkable of the\nwhole series, not indeed on account of the variety of the\nphenomena, which was small, but of their boisterous exuberance.\nThe light was altogether unshaded at the start, yet levitations\nof the table began immediately and followed one another\nwith extreme rapidity, no less than six complete levitations\ntaking place within five minutes (10.13 to 10.17 p.m.).\nThe conditions under which these levitations took place were\nso exceptionally good as to light and control that it seemed\nunnecessary to go on repeating them. Eusapia was, however,\nasked to produce one more while F. held her feet under the\ntable. She consented, and placed her hands on her lap, held\nby B. and C, and sat motionless while F. gathered her\nskirts about her feet and encircled them with his hands.\nThe light, it is true, was reduced to the No. 3 ruby light,\nbut this was sufficiently bright for us to see an absolutely\n\f06 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nclear space between her and the table, which, as soon as she\nwas told that we were ready, was again levitated off all four\nlegs. See the shorthand report at 10.23 p.m.\nShortly after this commenced a series of movements of the\nlittle stool which had been placed outside the curtain to the\nright rear of B. and to Eusapia's left, distant from her about\n3 feet. In response to gestures made towards it with her\nleft hand holding B.'s, the stool advanced towards her several\ntimes, and was also levitated while B.'s hand was resting on\nits surface, her hand being on top of his. See report from\n10.30 p.m. to 10.40 p.m. A series of touches on both C.\nand B. followed at 10.47 p.m., but the description of the\ncontrol in the report is not very adequate.\nIt is difficult to say whether this seance, which began so\nauspiciously, would have added to the general programme\nof phenomena. A development of some kind had taken\nplace at every stance up to now, and owing to the extreme\nvigour displayed by the \" force \" at this one, and the extreme\ngood humour of the medium, it seems probable that some\nfurther and more startling manifestations might have followed,\nhad it not been for the unfortunate '\nmisunderstanding ' that\ntook place at 11.6 p.m. and to which further reference is made\nin C.'s and F.'s notes. The discussion which arose in consequence\nlasted nearly three-quarters of an hour.\nAt the resumption of the seance at 11.45 p.m. further move-\nments of the stool of a particularly interesting character took\nplace in the No. 2 light. The medium made gestures with her\nhand at a distance from it of about three feet, sometimes with one\nhand and sometimes with the other, and gestures of attraction\nmade the stool approach, while gestures of repulsion made\nit recede from her. See B.'s note. During this series of\nmovements, the stenographer left his place and examined the\nstool, putting his arms right round it and feeling along the\nfloor, several times, and found no attachment.\nAt 12.0 began a series of the usual curtain movements, and\nat 12.23 a.m. of touches on C. by something from within the\ncurtain.

The same may be said of the\ngrasp of a complete hand through the curtain, experienced by\nC. at 12.38 a.m., while both the medium's hands were visibly\non the table.\nAt 12.43 a.m. began a series of movements of the\ntambourine within the cabinet. Shortly afterwards the tam-\nbourine came out of the cabinet along the floor and remained\nthere quietly for a time while C. was pulled about and\ntouched in various places a very large number of times.\nAttention may be directed to a touch occurring at 12.51,\nwhen a whole hand was felt by C. at a time when he was\nholding both the medium's hands. At 1.5 a.m. the tambourine\nbegan to perform a kind of tune. F., who was standing close\nto it, felt around it and found no attachment, and shortly\nafterwards it appeared to try and jump on to C.'s lap, both\nthe medium's legs encircling C.'s left leg, while her hands\nwere under thorough control, and also tied in such a way\nas to put the tambourine out of her reach.

Feilding.\nThis seance began under the most favourable circumstances.\nEusapia was in the best of humours, and submitted to having her\nhands and feet tied with perfectly good grace. They were tied by\nB. and myself. The tying of the hands, however, is not of any\nspecial importance for those who are present at the seances, and whose\nattention has constantly to be on the alert from the necessity of\ndescribing the control at every moment to the stenographer. At\nscarcely any time has the light been so poor as not to enable the\ncontrollers to see, as well as feel, the hands they were holding. And\n\f520 E. Feilcling, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nit is especially to be remarked that it has been just those seances\nwhere the light has been the poorest that the phenomena have been\nthe least remarkable and frequent. The tenth seance, which has\ntaken place before I have finished this note, has been the worst\nof the whole series. Compared, indeed, with the performance of\nother mediums, the manifestations which occurred were remarkable\nenough ; but compared with its predecessors, the tenth seance was\nalmost blank, though darkness, more or less complete, prevailed\nalmost throughout. The same thing may be said of a great part\nof the third and fourth seances. The implication appears to be\nthat when the force, whatever it is, which produces Eusapia's pheno-\nmena, is strong, nothing will interfere with it, and phenomena, at\nall events of a certain class, hurry one upon another even in the\nbrightest light. When, however, the force is weak, she seeks to\nimprove the conditions for its development by reducing the light;\nbut even then, though a few sparse manifestations will occur, the\nresults, with some exceptions, are generally feeble and of small\ninterest, and certainly far from convincing.\nWe tied Eusapia, then, more for the sake of being able to say\nthat we had done so, than for our own satisfaction. The tying of\nher hands would not have been close enough to prevent her from\nfraudulently producing the many touches which C. experienced at the\nlatter part of the seance, but she could not have touched either the tam-\nbourine or the stool, which were the only objects moved at this seance,\nat any time. The tying of her right foot was close enough to prevent\nher from reaching within about a foot from the tambourine in its\noriginal position within the cabinet, though she might possibly have\ndone so after it came out and jumped about on the floor. Had she\nnot been otherwise controlled, with her knees under the table, while\nthe small stool was moving about on the floor, it is possible she\nmight have reached it at some part of its progress. It is difficult,\nwhen a seance is over, exactly to fix the positions of chairs and other\nmovable objects. But as a matter of fact, she did not use her feet.\nThe tambourine and the stool stood free of her, a clearly visible space\nbeing between her and them while they moved.\nThe proceedings started in the light of an unshaded 10 candle\npower 150 volt lamp. The current being 110 volts, the lamp of\ncourse is less brilliant than if it had been a 110 volt one, but it was\ngood enough for me to be able, while standing at the entrance door,\nten feet from under the light and holding my book edgeways, not\ndirectly towards it, to read small print without the least discomfort.\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance IX. 521\nIt was thus the best light that we had yet had at any seance.\nLevitations began immediately. The table bounded about as if it\nwas on springs. In some respects these levitations were less aston-\nishing than those we had at seances 1 and 2, as there was usually\nsome slight contact with the medium's hands, though not of such\na kind as could produce the levitations by normal means. They\nended by boring us, and we asked for them to stop, except for one\nfinal levitation which we wished her to produce while her feet, which,\nhowever, had been hitherto quite visible under the table to the\nstenographer and myself (I sat opposite Eusapia), were actually\nbeing held. I went accordingly under the table, gathered Eusapia's\nskirts together and enclosed them and her feet within my hands\nand between the table legs. It appears that the application of a\nspecial test produces a psychological effect on Eusapia, and even\nthough she still produces the phenomenon, its performance seems\nmade more difficult ; she asked for the light to be reduced twice, i.e.\nto the ruby light, and seemed to collect herself for an effort. I\nrequested the others to remove their legs so that I could get a clear\nview, as well as hold, of Eusapia's, which even in the reduced light\nwere still perfectly visible to me. B. and C. placed their hands on\nher knees and she placed her hands on their hands. She asked if\nour control was quite satisfactory, and up went the table. We felt\nthat there was no more to be said, and I resumed my place opposite\nher.\nWith regard to the storm which arose later on, I may make\na few remarks. When Eusapia is in the deeper stage of trance\nwhich usually accompanies the production of the more advanced\nphenomena our experience is that she always allows her hands\nto be fully enclosed in those of her neighbours. When, how-\never, she is only in a state of half-trance, she frequently seeks\nto keep her hands on the top of theirs, and moves them restlessly\nabout. When her two hands are near together, it is obvious\nthat a substitution of hands becomes easy, but when they are far\napart, \u2014and, as a rule, she keeps them at a considerable distance\nfrom one another, \u2014no substitution is possible. I have complained to\nher more than once that she ought to allow her hands to be fully\nenclosed. She said that during a seance she became very hyper-\naesthetic and nervous, and that the touch of certain people's hands,\nespecially if these are at all moist or hot, is so acutely unpleasant\nto her that she cannot endure her hands being held inside them.\nShe said that this sensation had no connection with her liking for\n\f522 E. Feildivg, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\npeople otherwise, and that there were certain persons to whom she\nwas greatly attached in her normal condition who were profoundly\nantipathetic to her as neighbours during a seance, and vice versd.\nAs regards her feet, especially her left foot, she said she was still\nmore sensitive. Her left foot, she told me, had once been run over\nby the wheel of a cab, and she cannot stand pressure on the instep,\nwhile both her feet have a tendency to go to sleep, so that she gets\na sensation of pins and needles in them, and has to press violently\nevery now and then with them so as to restore sensation. This\ncertainly accords with our experiences, and we have all of us\narisen from seances with mangled feet, the result of the vigorous\napplication of her exceedingly sharp heels. It is, in any case, not\nunnatural that during a long seance she should be restless with\nboth hands and feet, and although her knees are almost always\npressing against ours, and well under the table, which is very\nnarrow, thus making it impossible for any ordinary person, as we\nhave found by trial, to get the foot outside the table leg in such a\nway as to perform tricks without the movement immediately being\nperceived, we have always been extremely suspicious of a substitution\nof feet being performed. Nevertheless, though the actual sensation\non our feet was frequently that of only part of one of hers, heel\nor toe, leading us to verify, with the free hand, the fact that we\nwere really controlling the foot which we ought, none of us has\never once, excepting at this seance, detected the slightest attempt\nat foot substitution.\nDuring this seance, however, C. did notice a change, and forgetting\nthat, owing to the fastening, she had only a certain range of action,\nhe stooped down to feel, and found that Eusapia had crossed her\nfeet. He told me in English that the foot control was not good.\nEusapia, who detests English, and is always annoyed when she does\nnot know what is being said, yet has a flair for the meaning of\nthings so remarkable as to amount almost to the dignit}' of tele-\npathic perception, was furious. She worked herself up into a\npassion and covered us with rich Neapolitan reproaches for our\nsuspicion and inexperience of her phenomena. The storm raged\nfor about an hour, and when at length calm was, to a certain extent,\nrestored, and we all expressed unfeigned astonishment at the activity\nof the stool, which performed a pas seul outside the cabinet, she said\nsarcastically :\n\" You have spoiled all the better phenomena, and now\nyou are amazed at a straw (paglia) like that.\"\nE. P., Dec. 17th, 1908.\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance IX. 523\nNote on Seance IX. by H. Carrington.\nThis seance started most propitiously, and it was possibly owing\nto what was perhaps a blunder on my part that we did not get\nmany more startling phenomena than we did. The medium arrived\nin very high spirits, and consented to have her hands as well as\nher feet tied with rope, which she had refused at the previous\nsitting. B. \u2014who is an expert at knots and tying generally \u2014under-\ntook to tie the medium's feet and hands, which he did. I then\ncontrolled the right side of the medium, B. the left.\nThe table began to move almost at once, as at our first seances.\nSeveral complete levitations followed one another in good light, and\nunder excellent conditions of control. The little stool was then\nmoved and levitated, and moved again under absolute test condi-\ntions, as the record will show. Several important and evidential\ntouches through the curtain followed this, also other phenomena.\nIt was shortly after this that I began to feel dissatisfied with\nmy foot control, and later with the hand control also. I forgot,\nfor the time being, the limitations put upon the medium's move-\nments by the tying of the hands and feet, and felt I should have\nthe same amount of control as formerly for two reasons: (1) touches\non my side would be non-evidential if the hand control were not\ngood; and movements of objects on her right side, on the floor,\nwould also be non-evidential, for the same reason. (2) We had\nagreed to tell the medium at once as soon as any laxness of the\ncontrol became apparent. Further, the light had now been lowered\nvery considerably, and the right-hand curtain was covering part of\nher body. I accordingly manifested some signs of unrest, as soon\nas the control became markedly poor, and finally sought to verify,\nwith my hands, the exact position of her feet. It was at this that\nshe became angry, and a long intermission resulted, in which she\nexplained that, owing to the tying, she did not consider that such\nstrict conditions of control were necessary, and she wished to be\nmore free to move about, etc. We consented to this at once,\nwith the result that, although the control of hands and feet through-\nout the rest of the seance was not so good as formerly, still I\ncould usually follow her movements quite clearly, and am assured\nthat some of the phenomena at least could not have been produced\nby her, even had she effected a substitution of one hand and one\nfoot, as I think the account will show.\nH.

Baggally.\nThe numerous complete levitations of the table at this seance\nafforded further evidence of the existence of a telekinetic force\nexercised by Eusapia. The light was sufficiently good to enable us\nto see her hands and legs at the moment that some of the levita-\ntions took place, and no suspicious movement on her part was\ndetected. Her feet were also under control, and could not have\nbeen inserted under the table legs, and the hand of one of the\ncontrollers was on both her knees. The complete levitations, the\nswelling out of the medium's dress already referred to, and the bulging\nof the curtains of the cabinet, afforded me the strongest evidence\nso far obtained by us for the existence of this force, owing to the\nexcellent test conditions under which I observed them.\nDuring the production of these phenomena, and when the objects\nwere outside the cabinet, the movement could be watched from the\nmoment of its initiation. If this movement were due to a super-\nnormal force, as the test conditions under which it Avas produced\nsuggest, it is not impossible that this same force is also at work\nwhen objects are brought out of the cabinet, \u2014although their initial\nmotion is not then perceptible, \u2014if the test conditions in this latter\ncase are equally severe. This supposed force appears to be able\nto attract matter, as when the medium held her hands above\nthe table (her feet being under control), the table was completely\nlevitated with all four feet from the ground. It appears also able\nto repel it, as when she placed her hands below the table, though\nnot touching it (her feet being under control), the table rose in the\nsame manner.\nThe movements of the little stool which was placed on the ground\noutside the cabinet, on her left, at a distance of three feet from\nher left hand and two and a-half feet from her left foot, illustrated\nthe double action of this force. When she made a motion of\nher hand high above the stool, as if pushing it away from her,\nit retired ; and when she made the motion, also high above the\nstool, as if drawing it towards her, it advanced in her direction.\nAt the time these motions were taking place I was sure I had a\ngood control of her left leg. My right foot was not only against\nher left, but the whole length of my right leg was between hers\nand the stool. The light was sufficient to enable us to see the\nlittle stool as it moved in different dhections.\nW. W.

Whereas in the\ncase of phenomena taking place in Eusapia's presence the\nproblem, reduced to its simplest form is \" conjuring or\nspooks ?\n\" in the case about to be described the problem\nappears to be \" spooks, or a practical joke ?\n\" It is impossible\nto say which of the alternatives appears the more blankly\nimprobable. E. E.\nBell Incident.\n8.45 by C.'s watch. 15th December, 1908.\nAt a certain moment when B.\u00bb was working up our clay\nat the small table in the centre of the room, C. being in\nthe next room, with the door open, the small bell hanging\nfrom the string in the cabinet rang violently. It struck\nagainst the wood of the doorway\u2014a good 2 1 feet from the\nbell. The ringing continued for several seconds, with violence,\nand then stopped. B. was at least nine feet from the bell,\nat the time of ringing, and C. could see he did not approach\nit. Nobody else was in the room at the time. As soon\nas the bell ceased ringing, we called in Mr. Ryan from the\nnext room, who opened the curtains and saw (as did we all)\nthat the bell was still swinging on its suspending string.\nThe cabinet was empty save for a chair, standing inside it.\nWe all three heard and saw this remarkable bell phenomenon.\n(Signed) W. W. Baggally.\nHereward Carrington.\nI was adding my final note to my previous evidence when\nI heard the bell in the next room ring. I attached no\nimportance to this (thinking that B. and C. were testing the\napparatus). Mr. Baggally just then rushed in, made me come\nround and open the curtain. I then saw that the bell was\nstill swinging on its string. Mr. Baggally's hands were\ncovered with clay, which he was puddling.\nJames Ryan, Dec. 15th, 1908.\n[Written immediately after the curtain had been opened.]\n\f526 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nNote by W. W. Baggally.\nI was standing alone at 8.45 p.m., on the evening of the 15th\nDecember, by the side of a table in the seance room preparing\nsome clay for the purpose of obtaining, if possible, impressions of\n\"John's\" fingers or hand at the sitting which Eusapia was to\ngive us on that evening, when suddenly a bell in the cabinet gave\na bang against some woodwork, and rang loudly. I was standing\nat the time 2f metres from the closed curtains of the cabinet.\nI looked at C, who was just within the open doorway of his room,\nand said to him \"Do you hear that?\" He exclaimed \"By\nJove.\" I then rushed into my room where Mr. Ryan was seated\nwriting some notes, and I told him what had occurred. He came\nwith me into the seance room, opened the curtains, and we all\nsaw the bell swinging violently with the string that it was\nsuspended by. I had anticipated that this string had broken and\nthat the bell had fallen to the ground; my surprise was great to\nsee the bell still hanging and swinging violently. I asked C.\nto make a note of the occurrence at once, and also Mr. Ryan.\nAfter the swinging of the bell had ceased it occurred to me\nthat possibly some one had hung or balanced it on the horizontal\ncord to which the string (by which the bell hung) was attached,\nand that if this were so, a jerk might cause the bell to fall and\nring. I found by experiment that I could not balance the bell on\nthe cord, but that I could balance it on a nail in the cabinet or\nhang it on the cord by a small ornamental knob that was on the\nside of the handle. When so balanced or hung, the bell required\na jerk to cause it to fall. No one was near the cabinet to give\nthis jerk. The incident has no evidential value, but is very\nperplexing. It is strange that it should have occurred during the\ncourse of the seances.\nw w Rj Dec 15tb> 1908\nNote by E. Feilding.\nAs to this bell incident, I can express no opinion, not having\nbeen present. I came in amid the general consternation. It is\ninfinitely painful to me, as Hon. Sec. of that most staid body,\nthe S.P.R., to record the state of emotion in which I found my\ncolleagues.\nAs to who was responsible for it, we shall never know. If it\nwas \"John,\" playing poltergeist, he reveals a sense, of humour on\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia: Seance IX. 527\nwhich he deserves sincere congratulation ; if a more fleshly jester,\nthe chambermaid and the boots must divide my homage. The\nonly way that I can imagine the bell ringing as it did (it was\nstill swinging as I came in) was by its having fallen from a position\nof unstable suspense, from which it was dislodged by some\nconcussion. It may have occurred to the chambermaid or the\nboots to balance it on a certain nail in the hopes that it might\ntumble dramatically later on. Long practice has failed to disclose\nany other method. The chambermaid and the boots, delicately\nquestioned, deny blankly. The chambermaid, indeed, is terrified\nat our cabinet and could barely be persuaded to play \"Eusapia\"\nin some imitation photographs' of phenomena we took yesterday.\nThe boots is too stolid for such imaginative leaps. \"John\" himself\nis unquestionable. Taking it all round it is the most perplexing,\nindeed, annoying dilemma of this most perplexing month.\nAn additional plausibility would perhaps be lent to a super-\nnormal explanation if this occurrence be taken in conjunction with\nan incident which took place after, I think, the fifth seance,\nhitherto not mentioned. I had gone to bed and to sleep. I was\npresently awakened by C. who came in saying that from his bed in\nthe next room he heard rappings in my room through the open\ndoor. They still continued, and I rose and went with C. to the\ncabinet, whence they came. They were slow, deliberate raps\napparently on the wood-work near the window. They went on\nfor about -J\nminute while we stood there. Unfortunately the\nlight was then turned up and the curtain withdrawn and they\nimmediately stopped.\nEusapia, when told of this, declared it must have been her\n\"fluid\" which sometimes stayed behind. Perhaps;\u2014or a beetle.\nI do not know.\nR ^ Dec ^ 190g_\nRemarks on Seance X.\nDecember loth, 1908.\nIn this, which was to be last seance of the series, we had\narranged for a photographer to come and take a photograph of\na table levitation, Eusapia having readily consented when this\nwas proposed to her. As among the many photographs of levi-\ntations that have already been published, there are hardly any\nthat show adequately the control of the medium's feet, we asked\n\f528 E. Feliding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nher to use the stocks apparatus, which would render any kind of\nfoot control unnecessary. We also invited Prof. Galeotti and\nMr. Ryan to attend the seance. The night was wet and stormy.\nEusapia arrived late and in a bad humour. She said that she\nhad been ill all day, and had intended to send word to say\nshe could not come, and that it was only because she had\nheard from F. in the afternoon that Prof. Galeotti was coming\nthat she changed her mind.\nThe photographers were placed in the next room with the\ndoor closed, Eusapia saying that when she felt that a levitation\nwas going to happen she would give notice so that they might\nopen the door and get ready. The seance began at 9.40. It\nhad been suggested that until the \" force \" worked up she\nshould operate with the table free of the apparatus, but she\npresently said that it would only cause disturbance if a change\nwere made after the manifestations had begun, and asked\nthat the stocks should be put into use at once. Peyond a\nfew unimportant tilts nothing whatever occurred for an hour.\nThe light was altered several times without result. Eventually,\nat 10.34, the stocks were removed, and F. and P. lay on\nthe floor to control the medium's feet. Still no result, and,\nat 10.45 p.m., the light was altogether put out. Shortly\nafterwards, a complete levitation took place to which, owing\nto the darkness, no attention was paid. Some violent curtain\nmovements and touches, in what appear to be complete con-\nditions of control, except as regards the medium's head, then\nfollowed. At 11.42 the faint red light was again lit, and\nanother complete levitation occurred under what seemed good\nconditions, but the light was again shortly afterwards extin-\nguished. From 12.11 ami. till the seance ended at 12.28\na.m. P. continued to experience a series of touches on the\nback (as to which see his and F.'s notes). They were note-\nworthy owing to the fact that both the medium's hands were\nheld during part of their continuance by both the controllers.\nThis seance proved, on account of the bad conditions of\nlight and the sparseness of the phenomena, the least interesting\nof the series. Two alternative explanations offer themselves.\n1st. That the medium feared the test of photography, and\ntherefore limited her activity ; 2nd. that owing to her fatigue\nand ill-health, and possibly to the bad weather, the \" force\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance X. 529\nwas weak. She seemed greatly annoyed at the failure of the\nstance, and afterwards offered us another one, gratis, to make\nup. She frequently asked for the light to be raised, but tilts\nof the table invariably insisted on its being lowered again.\nHer demeanour was at least consistent with her sincerity. It\nwill be seen that no new kind of phenomenon was added to\nthe general programme, with one possible exception, an imprint\nin the clay, of which no mention is made in the Shorthand\nEeport. This was found on the clay being examined on one\nof the occasions in the early part of the seance when the light\nwas turned up. Five finger marks had been made at random,\ni.e. not in the shape of a hand. A real finger mark, in the\nsame surface, shows the papillae markings ; but these did not.\nEusapia's own fingers on examination showed no trace of clay.\nThe imprints were produced under entirely non-evidential\nconditions, unexpectedly, and at a time when attention was\nconcentrated on securing a photograph of a levitation, and no\nparticular care was being exercised against the medium's gaining\naccess to the cabinet. Except, however, that it is strange that\nthis particular phenomenon, often unsuccessfully attempted\nbefore, should have been produced on an evening when the\n\" force \" was otherwise so weak, and that it was produced\njust at the period of the seance when fraud could easily have\nbeen employed, no safe conclusion can be drawn.\nShorthand Report of Seance X.\nDecember 16th, 1908.\nPresent, F., C, B., Ryan, Professor Galeotti, and M.. shorthand\nwriter.

Feilding.\nI think that the incident reported at 12.11 a.m. may be somewhat\ninstructive, and that it may throw some light on the vexed question\nof the frequency of Eusapia's fraudulent substitution of hands. In\nview of the Cambridge report, and the reports of other observers,\n\fLix.] Sittings with Eusapia : Seance X. 535\nit is clearly impossible to deny that she resorts, at times, to this\ntrick.\nMy own experience on this occasion, however, leads me to think\nit is not impossible that it is often, in the darkness, thought she\nhad resorted to it when, in fact, she has not, and that her hands\nhave, through weariness or carelessness, got into what may be called\nthe \" substitution position,\" without its being taken practical advan-\ntage of. I noticed that I only had half her hand, and immediately\nfelt for the other half, and found it on B.'s left hand. I at once\njumped to the conclusion that she must have produced the touches\non B.'s back with her other hand. In accordance with my promise\nI told her my control was not good. She agreed ; but lifted\nmy hand to feel her other hand, which I found was under B's\nright. Even then, had not the touches continued at intervals for\nabout a quarter of an hour on B's back, I should still have felt\ndissatisfied, but our attention being called to the close position of\nthe hands, we took especial pains to control them, and the touches\ncontinued without the least interruption.\nE. F., Dec. 19th, 1908.\nNote on Seance X. by W. W. Baggally.\nThere was a good deal of confusion at this seance owing to the\nrepeated opening and shutting of the door between the seance room\nand C.'s room, where the photographic camera had been placed with\nwhich it was intended that a photograph of the seance table should\nbe taken at the moment of its complete levitation. The accidental\nflash, at one time, of the magnesium powder was also a cause of\ndisturbance.\nNotwithstanding these disquieting incidents (which had a dis-\nturbing effect on the mind of Eusapia), good phenomena took place\ntowards the end of the seance.\nThe repeated touches on my back between 12.11 and 12.23 were\nto me of great evidential value, notwithstanding the prevailing\ndarkness at the time, as I not only assured myself that I had\ncontrol of the medium's left hand and left foot, by feeling them\nwith my right hand and my right foot, but also by repeatedly,\nwhile I was being touched, passing my left hand all up her left\narm to her shoulder, thus verifying that it was really her left hand\nthat rested on my right, and by also continually passing my left\nhand down her left knee to the foot which rested on mine, thus\nverifying that it was her left foot that rested on my right.\n\f536 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nThe touches could not, by any possibility, have been produced\nby her head, as when I passed my left hand up her left arm, I\nverified the position of her head.\nThe touches were not produced by the hand or foot that I had\nunder control, nor by her head. The medium's right hand and\nright foot were under perfect control of F., therefore the touches on\nmy back appeared to me evidential.\nW. W. B., Dec. 16th, 1908.\nRemarks on Seance XI.\nDecember 19th, 1908.\nThis was the extra seance which Eusapia had offered, to\nmake up for the failure of the tenth. C. had been obliged\nto leave Naples. F. and B. decided to make another attempt\nto get the '\nhigher phenomena ' of materialisation, and to\ndiscard the recording of the details of control of the less im-\nportant manifestations. They also invited Signor Zingaropoli,\na gentleman of high official position in the avvocatura of the\nmunicipality, very well known to Eusapia and thoroughly\nfamiliar with her phenomena ; and also Mrs. and Miss Hutton,\ntwo English ladies, friends of his, and who had attended a\nfew of Eusapia's seances. Although, it is true, the '\nhigher\nphenomena ' did not appear, the stance proved an extremely\nfruitful one, and the shorthand report, not very complete in\nitself, but amplified by subsequent notes, should be carefully\nread. It will be sufficient if attention is here called to the\nmore remarkable occurrences.\n(1) The very remarkable curtain movement at 10.11 p.m.\nwhich occurred in the bright No. 1 light, shortly\nafter F. had carefully examined the curtain, gathered\nit together and placed it away from the medium.\n(2) The movements of the stool at 10.19 p.m., outside the\ncabinet, within a minute or two after it had been\nplaced on the floor at a distance of two or three feet\nfrom the medium, with the express purpose of seeing\nwhether she could cause it to move. Note that the\nmovements were occasionally sideways, that the short-\nhand writer, who had placed the stool, was standing\nclose to it while the movements were taking place,\n\fLix.J Sittings with Eusapia : Stance XI. 537\nand on several occasions felt around the stool to show\nthat there was no attachment.\n(3) The appearance of an object like a head with large\nfeatures, or a hand with the finders crooked so as to\nsimulate a head, wrapped up in the curtain, at 10.54\np.m. and at 11.33 and 11.34 p.m.\n(4) The repeated graspings of B., kneeling on the table from\n11.02 p.m. to 11.09 p.m., by a hand through the curtain,\n(5) The white thing which appeared 3 ft. to the medium's\nleft, i.e. from the corner near the window, at 11.16 p.m.\n(6) The touches that occurred simultaneously on both the\ncontrollers' laps at 11.45 p.m., when both the medium's\nhands were visibly on the table.\n(7) The levitation of the clay at 12.15 a.m., from the floor\nbehind the medium's chair, inside the curtain, and its\nappearance between Mrs. H. and the medium at a\nheight of about 3 \\ ft. from the ground, wrapped up\nin the curtain, held there as if by some one behind\nthe curtain until taken by Mrs. H. and F.\n(8) The levitation, at 12.26 a.m., of the stool, which, on\naccount of its extreme slowness, was perhaps the most\nremarkable of all the transportations of objects which\nwe had yet witnessed. The inception of this movement\nwas seen by the shorthand writer, who was standing\nclose to the stool as it began its upward climb.\n(9) The long series of touches, lasting almost continuously\nthrough a period of half an hour (12.34 a.m. to 1.6\na.m.), experienced by B. as of a hand playing about\non his left hand or wrist as he held it against the\ncurtain. It will be noticed that during part of this\ntime B. held both the medium's thumbs in front of her\non the table, at one time in both of his hands which\nhe kept far apart and at another time in his right\nhand, the medium's thumbs and hands being visible.\n(10) Finally, the series of raps produced on the door leading\ninto B.'s room, at the side of the cabinet, at the close of\nthe seance, which must be regarded as the only really\nevidential raps obtained throughout the whole series.\nThe No. 1 light was on, and the room additionally flooded\nwith light through the open door of the next room.\n\f538 E.

When, after the seance, and after success-\nfully producing the raps on the door, Eusapia failed to produce\nthem again, she seized my right hand in her left and squeezed\nmy hand with great force. At the same time, she took the\ncurtain in her right hand and squeezed it tightly, as if she\nwere pressing a wet sponge. She .retained both my hand and\nthe curtain (the latter between her thumb and forefinger, extending\nthe other fingers), and then made the usual gestures towards\nthe door, and produced the raps, though feebly. On again attempt-\ning to do so\u2014without either my hand or the curtain\u2014she failed.\nIt seemed almost as if the curtain were impregnated with some\nfluid, and my own sensation is that of my strength being drawn\nout of me, leaving a feeling of great exhaustion.\"]\n\fMX.] Sittings with Eusapia : Conclusions. 555\nIV.\nINDIVIDUAL CONCLUSIONS OF THE INVESTIGATORS.\nFinal Note by Hereward Carrington.\nAs a result of the ten sittings held by us at Naples, November 21st-\nDecember 15th, 1908, \u2014being the ten seances attended by me, \u2014\nhave to record my absolute conviction of the reality of at least\nsome of the phenomena ; and the conviction, amounting in my\nown mind to complete certainty, that the results witnessed by\nus were not due to fraud or trickery on the part of Eusapia. It\nwould be impossible to impart this feeling of certainty to others,\nsince that could only be obtained by a series of personal sittings\nand the critic must depend for his conviction upon our record of\nthe seances, \u2014as we have had hitherto to depend upon the records of\nothers. This is a very different thing from attending the seances\noneself. Just as one can only gain a correct idea of a fraudulent\nspiritualistic seance by attending it in person, so, I think, can one\nonly reach a defnrite conclusion in favour of the phenomena by\nattending genuine seances. The curious fact recorded by Mr.\nFeilding that the incidents seemed to roll off our minds and\nthat we lapsed back into scepticism on each occasion until we had\nheld four or five seances, was noticed by all of us ; and it is only\nwhen one is controlling the medium oneself, and when one has\nabsolute confidence in the controllers on the other side, that one\nreaches that state of complete conviction which it would be impos-\nsible to reach in any other manner.\nOne or two of the phenomena occurred under what I was\nforced to regard as ideal conditions of control. The touches during\nthe latter part of Seance VI. were among these, when I was\nholding the medium's left hand in her lap, and controlling practically\nthe whole of her body, while Mr. Baggally was controlling the\nright hand on the table, and these were the cases that con-\nvinced me finally and conclusively that genuine phenomena occurred,\nthough I could see no definite reason for refusing credence to many\nof the phenomena of the previous seances. Still, there is a differ-\nence between intellectual and emotional conviction, and, whereas\n\f556 E. Feilcling, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nthe first of these states had been reached by the end of the second\nseance, the second did not result until the sixth seance, as I have\nsaid. Never were the two degrees more clearly marked than on this\noccasion in my own mind ; and it is probable that the second\nof the two stages will only be reached by the majority when\npsychical science assumes a more definitely experimental form.\nThus, on several occasions, I verified my own control and found\nit perfect ; I also verified the control of my colleague. I then\nstretched my disengaged hand out towards the curtain, saying,\n\" Now, if I am touched under these conditions, I shall consider\nthe phenomenon definitely and finally proved.\" On several such\noccasions, I did receive touches apparently of hands, and I was\nconsequently forced to the conclusion that these phenomena were\nabsolutely genuine, and not the results of fraud on the part of\nEusapia.\nH.

[part\nFor the strict purposes of the S.P.R. investigation, perhaps only\nthe phenomena which occurred when the members of the Committee\nalone controlled should be taken into account. At the time that\nthese took place (except on the occasion when a current of\nair issued from Eusapia's head) the medium sat outside the cabinet\nwith her back to the curtains, and a member of the S.P.R. Com-\nmittee sat on each side of her controlling her hands and feet.\nThese 305 phenomena may be explained by one of four hypotheses :\n(1) That they were all fraudulent.\n(2) That they were all genuine.\n(3) That some were genuine and the others fraudulent.\n(4) That some were genuine and the others not proved to be\neither genuine or fraudulent.\nI proceed to consider these hypotheses in their order: (1) If all\nthe phenomena were fraudulent they must have been produced\neither by the liberation of one of Eusapia's hands or feet,\nafter she had carried out a substitution ;\nor, when she was not able\nto resort to this method, owing to her hands or feet being too far\napart, by the removal of one of her hands or feet from the hand or\nfoot of the controller (he, after such a removal, continuing under\nthe impression that he still felt her hand or foot in contact with\nhis own), or by the use of her head or other part of her body,\nor some mechanism concealed about her person, or by the help of\nan accomplice.\nNow it is a remarkable fact that (excluding the three occasions\non which substitutions of hands took place, which were followed by no\nphenomena. 1\nEusapia was not detected resorting to any fraudulent\nmethods during the production of any of the 305 phenomena. 2\nI cannot accept the theory that the members of the Committee\nwere suffering from a collective hallucination. The fact that they\nwere able to verify that the objects which they saw brought out\nof the cabinet remained outside at the termination of the sit-\ntings is sufficient to disprove it. Taking into consideration the\nmanner of the control, that no mechanism was found on the\nmedium's person, that no accomplice was present, and also that\nI\nI do not include among the 470 phenomena the occasion when Eusapia\nmade a substitution of hands and then brought the curtain forward and placed\nit on the table (see p. 383), because, in the view of F. and C, this incident\ndid not purport to be supernormal.\n- The non-detection of fraud also applies to all the other phenomena of the\neleven seances which are not included in the above 305.\n\fLIX.] Sittings %vith Eusapia : Conclusions. 559\nthe three S.P.R. investigators were men who had been accustomed\nfor years to the investigation of so-called physical phenomena of\nevery variety, and who had detected fraud after fraud, I find it\nimpossible to believe that Eusapia could have been able to practise\ntrickery constantly during the many hours that the seances lasted\nand remain undetected.\n(2) As regards the second hypothesis, \"that all the phenomena\nwere genuine,\" I cannot positively assert that this is correct.\nThe chances of occasional mal-observation on the part of the\ninvestigators should not be excluded. Eusapia was detected practis-\ning the trick of substitution on three occasions ; it is therefore\npossible that she may have been able unobserved to liberate one\nof her hands or feet on other occasions, and by this means\nto produce fraudulently some of the phenomena ; but neither my\ncolleagues nor I had proof that she resorted to fraud in the pro-\nduction of any one of the phenomena.\n(3) Regarding the third hypothesis, \" that some of the phenomena\nwere genuine and the others fraudulent,\" the second part of this\nis negatived by the remark just made ; it only then remains to\nconsider the first part \"that some of the phenomena were genuine.\"\nOn this point I feel that I can speak with assurance, though\nI am aware of the difficulty of imparting to a critic, by a mere\ndescription, the same conviction of the supernormal character of the\nparticular phenomena in question as I gained from personal obser-\nvation. One cannot easily accept as genuine phenomena which\nappear to contravene the known laws of Nature, and before doing\nso, one must be assured that by no possibility could they have\nbeen produced by normal means. A knowledge of the conjuring\nart is obviously of great use in enabling an investigator to judge\nwhether a medium is practising fraud or not, and two members of\nthe S.P.R. Committee possessed this knowledge. I have already\nmentioned the only normal methods which under the circumstances\nEusapia, in my opinion, could have used for the fraudulent pro-\nduction of the phenomena, viz., the unobserved liberation and use\nof one of her hands or feet, the unobserved use of her head or\nother part of her body, or of some mechanism concealed about her\nperson. The help of a confederate need not be considered, as the\nseances took place in our own room with locked doors. 1\n1\nIt has been suggested to me that possibly M., the stenographer, assisted\nthe medium as a confederate. To this suggestion I would reply that M. is a\ngentleman whose services F. engaged without previously informing Eusapia that\n\f560 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nIf certain phenomena take place when both hands of the\nmedium are distinctly seen, above, or quietly resting on, the seance\ntable, or both hands are clearly seen when being held by the con-\ntrollers, and at the same time her body is in view down to her\nfeet, while the controllers are assured, by tactile examination or by\ntheir sense of sight, that no mechanism is being brought into play,\nand when it is certain that there is no accomplice ; if certain\nphenomena, I say, take place under the above conditions, which\nseem to exclude all conceivable normal means of producing the pheno-\nmena, there is then a strong presumption that they are produced\nsupernormally, and it was the phenomena which occurred under\nthese strictly test conditions that first convinced me of this. I will\nnow give a few examples of such phenomena.\nI have already (in my note to Seance VII.) recounted in\ndetail the remarkable movement of Eusapia's dress. This took\nplace at the beginning of the seventh seance, in the strongest\nlight (unshaded) that we used from the time that I joined in the\ninvestigation, when the medium's hands were resting on the seance\ntable in full view of all the members of the S.P.R. Committee,\nwhen her whole body was seen (I stood quite close to Eusapia\nintently watching her), and when her two feet were securely held\nby F. and C, there being no possibility of a substitution of feet\nnor the use of any mechanism nor attachment, as the medium\nshowed us, at the time, that her two feet were separately held and\nthat no mechanism was concealed under her dress. F. felt with his\nhand several times, and found no attachment.\nAnother phenomenon which greatly impressed me was the bulging\nof the curtain after the conclusion of the sixth seance at about 2 a.m. 1\na stenographer would be present at the seances, and that he had never met the\nmedium before. During the whole time that the seances at which I was\npresent, lasted, M.'s face was lit by the lamp which he used for the purpose of\ntaking the notes. His face was clearly visible to the controllers, and therefore\nhis position in the seance room was never lost sight of. The table at which\nhe sat was several feet away from the end of the seance table farthest away\nfrom the medium. He never moved from his table except when he was asked\nto come near Eusapia the better to witness a few of the phenomena.\nAs regards the possibility of a confederate gaining access into the cabinet\nby a trap door, I may say that I examined the interior of the cabinet and\nfound that the floor was made of tiles closely cemented together. The walls\nwere at right angles to each other ; one consisting of thick masonry gave on\nto the street, the other of thin masonry, brick or plaster, separated the stance\nroom from my bedroom. There was no trap door.\n1\nSee C.'s note to Stance VI.\n\flix.] Sittings with Eusapia: Conclusions. 561\nThe light had been raised to No. 1 light. Eusapia released both\nher hands from control and placed them on the table. They were\nperfectly visible to all of us. Both her feet were under control. I\nnoticed that the curtain, which was on the medium's right, but not\nin contact Math any part of her body, made a slight movement. I\nimmediately realised that if the curtain bulged out at that time\nthere could be no possibility of her being able to produce\nthe movement by normal means without detection, as owing to\nthe good light and to my position, I could distinctly see at the\nsame moment her head, her two hands, her body down to her\nfeet, and the curtain which was close to me and not touching her.\nA very short time after this thought crossed my mind, and while\nI was intently watching Eusapia, who did not move, the curtain\nbulged strongly out, as if pressed from within the cabinet by a\nballoon. The bulge was about a foot and a half from the medium's\nhead and on a level with it. Eusapia was examined shortly after-\nwards, at this seance, and no mechanism was found concealed about\nher body.\nThere was a curious parallelism between the bulges of Eusapia's\ndress and those of the curtains. Those that I saw were all globular\nin form and they did not show themselves close to the ground. 1\nThe remarkable nature of these bulges should be kept in mind.\nWhen they were felt by the hand of a sitter they offered no resist-\nance, but gave the impression of being caused by a current of air\nblown from behind the curtain. They were never pointed or irregular\nin form, as would have been the case had they been brought about\nby a thread attached to the curtain or by a hand or foot pushing\nthe curtain forward. The bulges of the curtains were sometimes on\na level with Eusapia's head and sometimes higher or loAver. Her\nhead was, as I have said, visible when the bulges took place.\nA notable phenomenon of a different character was one that was\nwitnessed at 1.15 a.m. after the termination of Seance XL when Mrs. H.\nhad ceased to control. This lady retained her seat on the left of the\nmedium and I retained mine on her right. The other persons who had\nbeen present at the seance (with the exception of the stenographer, who\nremained seated at his table) had retired into C.'s room. They had\nleft the door wide open so that the seance room was now not only\nlit by Light 1 (the strongest light used at the seances), but also by\n1\nAs regards the movement of Eusapia's dress, to which I have referred, the\nbulges occurred before the lower edge of her dress began to creep along the\nfloor in the manner described in my note to Stance VII.\n2N\n\f562 E.

She tightly closed the fist of the left hand, as if by\nnervous tension, and made three motions with it towards the closed\ndoor which was behind my back (I was seated between the medium\nand the door and had a full view of her hands and the right side\nof her body from her head to her feet), whereupon three loud raps\nwere heard on the door. After this she made several gestures with\nher hand, and each time raps were heard on the door, finishing with\nfour large gestures followed by four loud raps. These raps were\nheard by Mrs. H. and myself. They distinctly came from the door\nbehind me and not from where Eusapia sat in front of me. The\nmedium then held my right hand in her right and scratched the\nback of my right hand with the finger nails of her left and, syn-\nchronously, a rasping sound was heard on the door. The distance\nbetween the medium's hand and the door when she made the gestures\nand scratched my hand was about 3h feet, and the distance between\nher feet and the door about 3 feet. I was much impressed by\nthese phenomena as they were taking place, and, without leaving\nmy seat, called F. from the other room. His note, in the steno-\ngraphic report, is as follows :\n\"B. called me in from the other room. I asked medium to\nrepeat raps. It seemed as though the force were expended. She\nmade three or four gestures and no raps followed. Then she made\na final gesture and a loud rap followed. It appeared to me dis-\ntinctly to come from the door beside which I was standing. Her\nfeet were at least three feet from the door, and her hand, as she\nmade the gesture, did not approach within six inches of it. There\nwas a clear space between the whole of the medium and the door.\"\nWhen F. came into the seance room Eusapia did not succeed in\nobtaining a rap until she brought her hand within a distance of\nsix inches from the door, whereas when I first heard the raps her\nhand was about 3| feet from it. F. placed himself between the\nmedium and the door in a similar position to my own, and was thus\nable to confirm the fact, which I have stated, that Eusapia's hands\ncould be clearly seen, in the excellent light, that the whole of her\nright side was in view down to her feet, and that the loud rap that\nhe heard, like those that I heard, came distinctly from the door\nand not from where the medium sat.\nThe apparently supernormal agency was not only able to produce\npercussive and other sounds at a distance from Eusapia's body\n\fLIX.] Sittings with Eusapia : Conclusions. 563\nand to move comparatively light objects, such as her dress or the\ncurtains of the cabinet, but could also affect heavy objects, as was\nshown by many of the complete levitations of the seance table\nwhich occurred when one of my colleagues of the S.P.R. Committee\nand I controlled.\nI would refer the reader to the complete levitations which took\nplace during Seance IX. at 10.14, 10.16, and 10.17 p.m. The\nstrongest Light, No. 1, was then on ; the medium's hands were\nplainly visible in such a position that she could not make use of\nthem for raising the table, and at the same time a space was seen\nby C. and myself between the table legs and the dress of the\nmedium on either side of her. As an additional precaution I had\nmy right hand across her two knees, which remained motionless\nduring the levitations. All the above phenomena occurred under\nthese stringent test conditions. I am therefore convinced that\nEusapia did not (for their production) make use of her hands, or\nher feet, or any part of her body ; neither did she resort to any\nmechanical means, nor was she assisted by a confederate, and I am\ncompelled to ascribe these phenomena to some supernormal cause.\nSo far I have only treated of phenomena which were due to\nthe action of some force of a telekinetic nature. My mind did\nnot, a priori, reject the possibility of its existence owing to the\nfact of its neAvness to me, but that this force should be able to\nmanifest itself as tangible matter and assume an organic form like\na hand, capable of grasping, was a phenomenon of such a complex\nnature that I was not able to give it acceptance with equal ease.\nThe phenomena, however, that I am about to describe, although\nlacking in one of the specific test conditions (inasmuch as the\nlower part of the medium's body was not in view at the time of\ntheir occurrence), offered me strong evidence that this force did\nmaterialise itself, to use a spiritualistic term, and did assume the\nform of a hand.\nDuring the time that I controlled Eusapia, at the seances, I was\ncertain that the hand that I had in contact with mine was her\nright hand (or her left hand as the case might be), as I continually\nassured myself of the fact by feeling the relative position of her\nthumb and palm, and also that it was a living hand by the\nresponses that it gave to my pressure. The controller who sat on\nthe other side of the medium was equally certain that the hand\nthat he had in contact with his own was her other hand, for the\nsame reasons. I had, therefore, the assurance that it was not\n\f564 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\ncne of Eusapia's hands which issued from the cabinet and occasion-\nally grasped me. This assurance was greatly increased at the\neleventh seance at 12.51-12.54 a.m., as at the moment that I felt\nthe squeezes and grasps I could see both the medium's hands on the\nseance table ; and especially so at 1 a.m., when I alone controlled,\nand not only saw both Eusapia's hands, but held them separately\nby her thumbs in both my hands, which I kept apart on the\nseance table; and subsequently at 1.3 a.m., when I held both her\nthumbs in my right hand, the foot control being verified by me\nat the time.

Neither could she have lifted her foot to the\nheight of my hand and arm without a contortion of her body,\nwhich would have been immediately seen, whereas she sat quietly on\nher chair in a natural position. I am therefore convinced that it was\nneither Eusapia's hand nor her foot that squeezed and grasped me, and\nas I am positive that it was not the hand nor foot of any one of the\nsitters, I am driven to the conclusion (preposterous though it appears\nto me) that the supernormal force, which had given me conclusive\nevidence of its existence through the phenomena previously described,\nwas able to produce the effects of tangible matter and assume the\nform of a hand. 1\nIt is not, however, the above phenomena of\ntouches and grasps that I would bring forward as crucial evidence\nfor the existence of a supernormal force, as some of the test con-\nditions which I have specified were lacking in these cases. I would\nrather depend on the phenomena which took place in light when\nthe medium's hands were distinctly seen simultaneously with her\nwhole body down to her feet.\nI refer here only to phenomena which occurred while I was person-\nally controlling. The reader will find in the Report others of equal\nevidential value, during the occurrence of which the same crucial\ntest conditions prevailed, when F. and C. controlled.\nI am compelled to accept as true the first part of the third hypo-\nthesis, \"that some of the phenomena were genuine\" (the second\npart I have already dealt with) ; it follows that the fourth hypothesis,\n\"that some of the phenomena were genuine and the others not\nproved to be either genuine or fraudulent,\" is that which represents\nmy attitude.\nIn previous investigations with other so-called physical mediums, I\nhad formed the opinion that, as I had detected them resorting to fraud\n1\nThe conditions under which I felt grasps and touches on other occasions at\nthese seances than those referred to above offered me also strong evidence that\nthe touches and grasps were independent of the physical organism of Eusapia.\nThe numerous touches on my back between 12.11 and 12.20 in Seance X. occurred\nunder what were to me excellent test conditions, as at the very time that I\nwas feeling them I was constantly passing my left hand all up her left arm to\nher shoulder and down her left leg to her foot, thus verifying that I had\nundoubted control of her left hand and foot with my right hand and foot, and\nthat the touches were not produced by her head. F. had control of her right\nhand and foot. See my note to that seance.\n\f\u2022566 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Garrington. [part\nin the majority of their phenomena, the other phenomena in which I\ndid not detect fraud were presumably also fraudulent. As regards\nEusapia's phenomena at these seances, my opinion is that, as some\nof the phenomena appear to me to be undoubtedly genuine, others\nin which I did not detect fraud were (considering the manner and\nstrictness of the control and the amount of light in the seance room)\nalso genuine. I do not maintain this of all the phenomena, as the\nchances of occasional mal-observation on our part, at such rare times\nas when darkness prevailed or when the controllers were changing\ntheir seats, cannot be excluded. At the same time I must repeat that\nEusapia was not detected in fraud in any one of the 470 phenomena\nthat took place at the eleven seances.\nMy general opinion of these phenomena is that they were due\nto some supernormal force resident in the organism of Eusapia,\nthough some few of them would appear to point to the action of an\nindependent energy.\nWhatever explanation is advanced can only be a theoretical\none. It is not theories that are required at this stage of the investi-\ngation of this medium, (who so far has only been examined by one\nEnglish and a few foreign eminent men of science), but the recognition\nby the scientific world at large of the occurrence of supernormal\nphenomena. It is greatly to be regretted, in view of the reports of\nthe eminent scientific men just referred to, that British men of\nscience do not take the opportunity of an investigation into Eusapia\nPalladino's mediumship,\u2014an opportunity which, if not taken soon,\nmay, in nature's course, be lost for ever.\nW.

I propose to allow myself only a few words as to\nthe character of the Report itself.\nIn preparing it for press I have speculated much as to what\nmeasure of success we have attained towards achieving the\nmodest object we have had in view, namely, to present to\nreaders who have never assisted at seances of the kind described\n\fLix.] Sittings ivith jEusapia : Conclusions. 567\na complete record of the conditions which prevailed, and an\naccurate account of the occurrences, so that they might them-\nselves come to a conclusion as to whether these occurrences\nwere due to conjuring, or to a display of telekinetic force.\nOur intention at the outset was not to obtrude our own views,\nbut to let the facts speak for themselves.\nIn both of these respects our intention has been largely\nmodified in practice. There is no question but that the short-\nhand reports give in most cases an inadequate account of\nthe proceedings by constantly understating the number of the\nphenomena and insufficiently recording the adequacy of the\ncontrol which prevailed, with the result that a critical reader,\nloth to accept the hypothesis of a supernormal agency having\nbeen at work, will find the proportion of phenomena which\nhe is able to dismiss as inconclusive, by reason of the omission\nfrom the report of some important detail, far larger than we\nourselves, from our contemporary observation, could so dismiss.\nIt was perhaps because we so often found, when reading\nthe reports through the day after the seance, that we had\nfallen thus far short of our ideal in the way of reporting, and\nhad, in a sense, done the phenomena an injustice, that we\nwere forced from our proposed colourless attitude into one of\nalmost proselytizing affirmation. The result is that the Report\nis far more positive in its conclusions and dominated by a far\nmore personal note than, for example, the admirably balanced\nreport recently issued by the Institut Giniral Psychologique\nof Paris, a report which, though dealing with experiments\nlasting through three years and marked by more remark-\nable incidents than any in our own experience, is nevertheless\ndrawn up with such a wealth of scientific caution and reserve\nas almost to leave a reader in doubt as to the character of its\nown conclusions.\nIt has constantly, and in my opinion most absurdly, been\nsaid that no one is so easy to deceive as a man of science.\nI think it would be nearer the mark to say that if in fact\nthere be such a thing as a supernormal physical force, no one\nis so easily converted to a belief in it as a conjuror. The\nsavant, steeped in his experience of the normal forces of nature,\nis constitutionally averse from the conception of an apparently\nbizarre departure from them. Aware of his own lack of know-\n\f568 E. Feilding, W. W. Baggally, and H. Carrington. [part\nledge of the possibilities of mere legerdemain, he naturally prefers\nto suspect himself of having been the sport of some undiscovered\nform of deception rather than to remodel his philosophy. The\nconjuror, on the other hand, has the experience, not only of the\npossibilities, but also of the limitations of his own art, and\nhaving no particular philosophy beyond that of an ordinary\nlayman regarding the forces of nature, has no special difficulty\nin remodelling it, if necessary, when confronted with a series\nof events which he knows his art is incapable of explaining.\nMy colleagues, then, having come to the deliberate opinion\nthat a large proportion of the manifestations of which we were\nthe witnesses in Naples were clearly beyond the possibilities\nof any conceivable form of conjuring, entertain no difficulty in\nsaying so in precise terms, and so far as my own position as\na layman entitles me to it, I associate myself entirely with\ntheir conclusions without apology for our seeming lack of scien-\ntific caution.\nI permit myself to finish with a quotation from a paper\nwhich I read before the Society when introducing to it the\nsubject of this Eeport.\n\" While I have convinced myself of the reality of these\nphenomena and of the existence of some force not yet generally\nrecognised which is able to impress itself on matter, and to\nsimulate or create the appearance of matter, I refrain for the\npresent from speculating upon its nature. Yet it is just in\nthis speculation that the whole interest of the subject lies.\nThe force, if we are driven, as I am confident we are, to pre-\nsuppose one other than mere conjuring, must either reside in\nthe medium herself and be of the nature of an extension of\nhuman faculty beyond what is generally recognised ; or must\nbe a force having its origin in something apparently intelligent\nand external to her, operating either directly from itself, or\nindirectly through or in conjunction with some special attribute\nof her organism. The phenomena then,\u2014in themselves pre-\nposterous, futile, and lacking in any quality of the smallest\nethical, religious, or spiritual value, \u2014are nevertheless sympto-\nmatic of something which, put at its lowest by choosing the\nfirst hypothesis, must, as it filters gradually into our common\nknowledge, most profoundly modify the whole of our philosophy\nof human faculty ; but which, if that hypothesis is found\n\fLIX.] Sittings ivith Eusapia : Conclusions. 569\ninsufficient, may ultimately be judged to require an interpre-\ntation involving not only that modification, but a still wider\none, namely, our knowledge of the relations between mankind\nand an intelligent sphere external to it. Although one may\napproach the investigation of the phenomena themselves in a\nlight, shall I say, even a flippant spirit,\u2014(I sometimes think\nthat in this way alone one can preserve one's mental balance\nin dealing with this kind of subject), \u2014one must regard them\nas the playthings of the agency which they reveal, and the\nmore perfect revelation of that agency, whatever it may be,\nthrough the study of them, is surely a task as worthy of the\nmost earnest consideration as any problem with which modern\nscience is concerned. If our report, by reason of its form and\ndetail, is found to do something towards supplying a further\nevidential basis for, and therefore directing the attention of\nmen of science in this country towards, the far more important\nand elaborate published investigations of many of our more\neminent predecessors, and of inducing them to take a part in\nthe research, I shall feel that it has amply served its purpose.\"\n\f570 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nSUPPLEMENT.\nM. COURTIER'S REPORT ON THE EXPERIMENTS WITH\nEUSAPIA PALLADINO AT THE PARIS \" INSTITUT\nGENERAL PSYCHOLOGIQUE \" AND SOME COMMENTS\nTHEREON.1\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nThis long expected, very interesting and copiously illustrated Report\nembodies the results of forty-three sittings in all: thirteen in 1905,\nsixteen in 1906 and fourteen in 1907-1908. Prior to the first series\nMessrs. Courtier (\" Chef des services du Secretariat general \" of the\nInstitute) and Yourievitch (Secretary General) had in May, 1905,\nattended eight seances with Eusapia Palladino in Naples, which\nsays M. Courtier, \"are among the strongest we have ever had\"\n(p. 418). Immediately afterwards, a \"General plan of research\" was\ndrawn up by the two investigators. It embraced \" observation,\ncontrol and registering of the phenomena,\" \"physical researches\" and\n\" psycho-physiological researches.\" It was in fact a very exhaustive\nprogramme, and the investigators have honestly endeavoured to\ncarry it out in every particular, whether with uniform success is\nanother question.\nThe Parisian seances (held partly at M. Courtier's, in 1905,\npartly in the library of the Institute, and finally in M. Yourievitch's\nhouse) were attended by many persons of scientific eminence ; some\nnames will be given below. The general conditions of the sittings\nwere the usual \" Eusapian \" conditions, which are too well known\n(it may be supposed) to readers of the Proceedings to need repetition\n\u2014a special feature being, however, the use of self-registering\ninstruments of various descriptions, these instruments being placed\nin an adjoining room and communicated with by means of electric\nleads and air-tubes passing through the wall.\n1\nBulletin de Vlnstitut Giniral Psychologique, No. 5-6 (Novembre-Decembre,\n1908).\n\fLIX.] Review. 571\nAt all the sittings held in Paris a stenographer was present who\nnoted down every word said by the sitters and by the medium.\nOther appliances were also used to make the record of the investi-\ngation as complete as possible.\nIn the course of the experiments different systems of light were\nemployed, the most perfect being as follows : a group of six electric\nlamps was placed in a wooden reflector closed below ; it was then\nraised to about thirty centimetres from the ceiling ; the room was\ntherefore lit up with reflected light, whose intensity could be\nmodified at will. At another series of sittings a gas-burner sur-\nrounded with movable wooden shutters was in use, and at another\nstill an oil-lamp, placed in another room.\nAfter these preliminary details the Report proceeds (Part I.) to\nthe phenomena themselves, every class of them being illustrated with\nexcerpts from the original stenographic records.\nIt first cites instances of blows, and scratchings on or in the\ntable, and remarks that these different sounds generally occurred\nin imitation of corresponding movements made by Eusapia and\nsometimes by the sitters. Exact localisation of sounds is admittedly\nvery difficult; but it must be remarked that in some cases simul-\ntaneously with the noises the table was felt to vibrate under the\nsitter's hands (pp. 434-436).\nThen come movements and tiltings of the table ; then full\nlevitations of the same. This last category is the most important.\nIn many instances the conditions under which the levitations\noccurred seem to have been very good, and one need not wonder\nthat this particular phenomenon has apparently dealt a serious\nblow to the scepticism of such a savant as M. dArsonval, not to\nmention M. Courtier himself, and others. I will give a few instances :\n\" (1905-IV-3.) Eusapia serre ses poings et les tend vers la table;\nelle remet ses mains sur la table, puis les leve. La table se souleve\ndes quatre pieds. L'appareil enregistreur a indique le soulevement\nde la table. M. dArsonval et M. Yourievitch (qui controlent a\ngauche et a droite) declarent que les pieds et les genoux d'Eusapia\nn'ont pas bouge \"\n(p. 437).\n\" (1905-X-4-5) 9 h. 58. La table est soulevee des quatre pieds\na environ 30 centimetres du sol et elle reste en Pair sept secondes.\nEusapia n'avait qu'une main sur la table ; la bougie placee sous la\ntable permettait le controle des genoux qui n'ont pas bouge.\"\n\" 10 h. La table est soulevee des quatre pieds a une hauteur\nd'environ 25 centimetres et reste en l'air quatre secondes, M. Curie\n\f572 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\ntouchant seul la table, la main d'Eusapia etant sur la sienne. Eusapia\na geint et a paru faire un grand effort. Le controle etait excellent\ngrace a la bougie placee sous la table \"\n(pp. 437-438).\n\" (1906-IV-3). La table se leve de deux, puis des quatre pieds ;\nune main d'Eusapia est au-dessus de la table et son autre main sur\nla main de M. Curie. Les pieds d'Eusapia sont attaches aux pieds\nde la chaise sur laquelle elle est assise. Controleurs a gauche M.\nCurie, a droite M. Fielding [Feilding] \"\n(p. 438).\nAnother time the table is levitated when an additional weight of\nten kilogrammes has been placed upon it. Messrs. Ballet and\nd'Arsonval were controlling \" absolutely \" Eusapia's feet and knees\n(besides the hands). The table was also once levitated, no one\n(apparently) touching it and one of the sitters holding the medium's\nfeet under it. Levitations were also obtained when two of the\ntable-legs (those nearest the medium) were protected with wooden\ncovers (\" jambieres \") joined by a cross-bar above the medium's\nknees (pp. 438, 445).\nThese levitations were registered in a manner which left no\ndoubt whatever as to their objective character. Each leg separately\nhad been provided with a contact key which completed an electric\ncircuit when the leg ivas off the ground. Each of these circuits\noperated a Desprez indicator writing on a revolving drum. If then any\nleg experienced a pressure from below\u2014either from the floor or from\nthe medium's foot\u2014the corresponding index would not work. So\nwhen all four scribers worked together it was certain that the legs\nwere really off the ground and not otherwise supported by or resting\non anything else.\nThe investigators also tried to ascertain what became of the\nnatural weight of the table during these \"levitations.\" It was\nfinally proved that in each and every case everything took place\n\" as if the fulcrum of the force were in the subject himself\"\u2014and\ntherefore in perfect accordance with orthodox mechanics (p. 441).\nThis, says the Report, is one of the most important results arrived\nat during the sittings (p. 441).\nApparent decrease in Eusapia's weight was also observed and\nautomatically registered, she being seated upon a chair placed on a\n\" Marey balance,\" and under control. Alteration of weight even to\na considerable extent was also proved in the case of a small table\nwhen moved and raised into the air seemingly without contact.\nA small table with a movable upper surface being placed upon the\nseance-table and Eusapia having brought her head close to it, the\n\fLIX.] Review. 573\nsurface was twice lifted up. The second time Madame Curie held\nher hand between the small table and the medium's head (p. 447).\nThe Report next mentions briefly movements and bulgings of the\ncurtain and of the medium's dress (the latter circumstance greatly\nimpressed M. Curie) ; then various cases of movements of objects in\nthe cabinet. A notable instance was the bringing upon the seance-\ntable of a basin full of clay weighing seven kilogrammes. Some\nobjects were broken, for instance, a wooden lath and an India-\nrubber tube (pp. 447-471).\nThe peregrinations of another small wooden table (\"gueridon\")\n(also graphically registered through a specially devised apparatus)\ndeserve more attention from the evidential point of view. Here\nis one good instance\n\" (1906-IV-10). \"Le gueridon place a la gauche d'Eusapia, a\n50 centimetres environ de sa chaise, est completement souleve alors\nque les pieds d'Eusapia sont attaches aux pieds de sa chaise par\ndes lacets et que ses poignets sont attaches aux poignets des\ncontroleurs. Arrive dans son ascension a la hauteur des epaules de\nM. Curie il est retourne les pieds en l'air, puis pose plateau contre\nplateau sur la table. Le mouvement n'a pas ete rapide, mais comme\nattentivement guide\" (pp. 472-473).\nApparent alterations of weight were also observed with this\n\" gueridon.\"\nWith such \" phenomena \" as \" touches \" and the appearance of\nhands and \" black limbs,\" \" comme des silhouettes d'ombres chinoises\n(pp. 473-475, 478, 479) the Report deals very briefly. An instance\nis given of a touch through the curtain at a considerable height\nabove the medium's head and two cases of apparently simultaneous\ntouches.\nThe Report then describes various luminous phenomena witnessed.\nBluish and phosphorescent lights were observed to appear on Eusapia's\nforehead and also on the curtain. When Eusapia was lying in the\ncabinet upon a \"chaise longue\" to which she had been tied from\nhead to foot, M. Courtier, who sat inside the cabinet, observed on\ntwo different occasions cloudy lights, \"as if phosphorescent or white,\"\nwandering over the medium's body. They were also noticed at the\nopening of the curtain by the other sitters.\nSparks and luminous points above the medium's head are also\nrecorded. The most interesting episode is described as follows :\n\" (1907-X-10-12). . . . Eusapia demande qu'on aille chercher la\nmachine electrique et que Ton en tire trois etincelles. M. Courtier\n\f574 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nva dans la piece voisine prendre la machine electrique et se placant\nen face d'Eusapia, environ a 2 metres, en tire trois etincelles. On\nvoit successivement a la hauteur de la tete d'Eusapia trois petits\npoints lumineux imitant les etincelles electriques et Ton entend en\nmeme temps le petit bruit sec de l'etincelle electrique. A la\nseconde experience ces points lumineux sont beaucoup plus faibles,\net le bruit se produit quelques instants apres leur apparition au\nlieu d'etre simultane\" (p. 477).\nM. Branly, in the course of the discussion of M. Courtier's\nreport, referred to this incident as \" one of the most curious\nexperiments I have seen \" (p. 558).\nPart II. of the Report is devoted to a very short biography\nof the medium and to various psycho-physiological and purely\nphysiological researches to which she was subjected. Here are the\ntwo points most worthy of attention : though some incidents\nduring the sittings seemed to point to another conclusion (p. 487),\nspecial experiments made on her (supposed) sensibility at a\ndistance gave negative results (p. 482), and in the course of some\nexperiments on her ctynamometric strength it was ascertained that\nits fall was invariably instantaneous, thus reminding one of the fall\nof the table after a \" levitation \"\n(p. 483).\nA few pages devoted to \" Eusapia en seance \" (pp. 484-490)\nare particularly interesting. She seems to be in a genuine\n\" secondary state \" during the sittings. The level of her hypnosis\nappears, however, to be most variable. The hyperesthesia to which\nher hands are subject will sometimes persist long after a sitting.\nShe seems to remember the incidents of a seance up to a certain\npoint only and then amnesia apparently sets in.\nShe maintains that the phenomena are produced by \" la densita\ndella volonta di medio \" and sometimes asks the sitters to concen-\ntrate their will on a certain phenomenon. The movements and\nlevitations of objects are accompanied on her part by strong\nmuscular contractions. Eusapia's own ideation seems to have a\nconsiderable influence on the things which happen at the sittings.\nA friendly attitude of the sitters is apparently a very important\ncondition for the success of the experiments.\nThe Report deals next with the \" investigation of the physical\nenvironment in the subject's proximity\" (pp. 505-514).\nThe investigators tried to ascertain Eusapia's possible action on\nphysical instruments. The experiments made dealt chiefly with\nmechanical force, heat, electricity and magnetism.\n\fLIX.] Review. 575\nEusapia having been placed in front of a lever-balance and under\ncontrol, the index marks first one kilogramme-and-a-half, then three,\nseven and ten. Part of her skirt was at her request placed on\nthe edge of the base of the balance.\nDifferent experiments were made on the movement in good light\nand without contact of various small weighing balances. The experi-\nment succeeded several times without any imposture\u2014such as the\nuse of a hair or thread\u2014being detected. It is, however, particularly\nnoteworthy that after one such instrument (a balance for weighing\ncocoons) had been covered with lamp-black (so as to reveal the trace\nof any contact) the medium was unable to affect this \" pese-cocon\nany more. (On this point see also further on.)\nA glass was made to vibrate in full light, giving oft' \"strong\nsonorous waves,\" then fell down on the table and broke.\nObservations made by three of the investigators tended to show\nthat the medium could discharge an electroscope without contact.\nIn other circumstances, however, electroscopes remained unaffected.\nExperiments made to ascertain whether Eusapia's muscular efforts\nwere accompanied by abnormal thermal or magnetic phenomena led\nto negative results, and chemical examination of the atmosphere in\nthe medium's proximity during the seances revealed nothing abnormal.\nI pass on to the most attractive part of the Report\u2014that entitled\n\"Critical Considerations\" (pp. 514-546).\nThe attitude of men of science towards the problems in question\nhas undergone, says M. Courtier, a serious change. They have ceased\nto look with contempt on those researches. On the contrary, they\nregard them with serious and keen curiosity. But they have banished\nfrom them the supernatural element and wish to investigate with\nrigorous experimental methods. The time is not far away when the\nsame point of view will prevail in the public mind.\nBefore everything else\u2014and in particular before the building up\nof new hypotheses\u2014it is, however, necessary to examine how far\nthe phenomena themselves may be considered authentic and the\nconditions of control and observation adequate.\nFrom this point of view many circumstances are unsatisfactory.\nThe light is generally poor, and is usually diminished gradually\nas the seance is in progress, \u2014which gives rise to new and various\nsources of error. Moreover, the greater the darkness, \u2014the more\nthe medium as a general rule complains of cutaneous hyperesthesia\nand throws difficulties in the way of controlling. On this point\nthe Report says :\n\f570 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\n\" En ce qui concerne les mains d'Eusapia, le controle n'est pleine-\nment satisfaisant que si Ton en serre le pouce et si la main ainsi\ntenue repose sur le plateau de la table en bonne lumiere. Mais\nsouvent Eusapia place ses mains sur ses cuisses et le controle\ndevient deja moins satisfaisant, puisque ses mains cessent d'etre\nentitlement visibles. . . . Lorsqu'on ne tient plus le pouce il est\ndifficile dans une obscurite relative de savoir nettement si Ton\ntouche la main droite ou la main gauche. Mais que dire du controle\nquand Eusapia se plaignant d'hyperesthesie cutanee POSE SA main\nsur la votre, en l'appuyant plus ou moins fortement ? . . . Pis\nencore est le controle lorsque Eusapia ne fait plus que toucher\nlegerement la main du controleur qu'elle tapote \" (p. 517).\nBesides the hand the medium's neighbour has to look after her\nknee and her foot. When his foot is upon the medium's and his\nleg against hers the conditions of control may be considered\nsufficient. But it often happens that Eusapia herself insists on being\nallowed to put her foot upon the controller's :\n\" La surveillance est alors si precaire qu'un observateur demanda\nun jour a defaire sa bottine pour mieux sentir le contact du pied\nd'Eusapia\" (p. 518).\nShe also objects \u2014as a general rule at least\u2014to certain \" tests\nbeing applied to her, which, though very effective, could not have\ncaused her any inconvenience\u2014and this on pretences which are\nobviously inadequate.\nSince controlling the phenomena is one thing and observing another,\nit would be preferable to have during the sittings some one standing\nclose to Eusapia without either holding her or taking part in the\n\" chain \"\n\u2014merely for purposes of observation. To this, however, she\ndecidedly objects in most cases. 1\nThe result is that the controllers are in a perpetual state of division\nof attention. Observation is, moreover, the more difficult as the\n\"phenomena\" occur now in one place, now in another, generally\nin an \"instantaneous and fugitive fashion.\" If a phenomenon has long\nbeen expected attention becomes worn out and sometimes slackens\nin spite of energetic efforts.\nIn addition to this cause of distraction the sitters generally talk\nduring the seance, and are often expressly invited by raps to start\na general conversation. This naturally leads to their attention\nbecoming divided.\n1\nFor an apparent exception, see Annates des Sciences PsycMques, No. 10,\n1907, pp. 683, 687, 691, 692, 703.\n\fXIX.] Review. 577\nThen there is suggestibility to beware of;\u2014one must be careful\nnot to affirm more than what was really perceived (with this point\nS.P.R. members are of course particularly familiar). The elements\nof emotion and excitement may also come into play now and then,\nand vitiate observation and judgment most seriously.\n\" Combien on est loin des patientes experimentations de laboratoire\noil les conditions des phenomenes sont reglees et calculees a l'avance,\noil Ton n'observe qu'un seul fait a la fois, dans un etat d'attention\ntrancmille et silencieuse !\n\" (p. 520).\nThe report next deals with Eusapia's \"supercheries\" (pp. 521-540).\nThese are unfortunately very numerous. At one time, having failed\nwith the phe-cocon, after it had been covered with lamp-black (as\ndescribed above) she moves the leaf of a gum-tree up and down\nby the aid of a hair. Another time she moves the scale of the\naforesaid \" pese-cocon \" in the same way.1\n1\n1 am not aware when hairs and threads were first found to play so\nobjectionable a part in E. P. 's performances, but similar observations appear\nto have been very often made. So often indeed that some six years ago an\ningenious hypothesis was started according to which these supposed hairs or\nthreads were merely harmless \" fluidic filaments\" (Revue des Etudes Psychiques,\nMarch, 1903, pp. 86-97). Quite recently such a hypothesis has been sanctioned\nby no less an authority than Dr. Ochorowicz himself. In Annates des Sciences\nPsychiques for the current year has appeared a series of articles by him, giving\nan account of some experiments with a young Polish lady called Stanislawa\nTomczyk. Among other things this mediumistically gifted young person would\nnow and then \"levitate\" various small objects\u2014which \" levitations \" were in\nsome cases photographed. A book-shaped calendar being thus privileged (the\nmedium holding her hands to the right and left of it), Dr. Ochorowicz noticed\nat a certain moment \"quite distinctly\" \"a black thread, not a very thick\n\u2022one, going from one of the medium's hands to the other; its right end, not\nbeing stretched out, was hanging down under the medium's right hand in\nthe shape of an irregular spiral.\" At the same moment the medium began to\nbring her hands down on the table, the calendar fell flat \u2014and no thread could\nbe detected (Annates, March, 1909, p. 68). Subsequently examination of a\nphotograph showing an arrow \"levitated\" revealed \"on the forefinger of the\nmedium's left hand a small line not corresponding to the natural fold of the\nphalanx \" which might be due to a tightened hair or thread pressing against\nthe skin ;\nmoreover, two of the fingers were suspiciously joined together as if\nretaining the end of the thread (Annates, April, p. 100). Dr. Ochorowicz thinks,\nhowever, that the thread in question was a \"materialised\" one (ibid, footnote),\nand he sums up his \"general impressions\" as follows:\n\"It is possible medianically to create between the medium's hands a kind\nof thread presenting during a few minutes a certain consistency which\ndecreases and disappears when his hands have been moved asunder. This\nthread created by the medium's unconscious imagination seems to present a\n20\n\f578 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nIn the course of an experiment with a manoraetric apparatus,\ninvented by M. Courtier, a little nail (which might well serve its\npurpose) is found where no nail should have been, \u2014that is, drops\n(apparently) from Eusapia's left hand.\nSubstitution of the medium's hands was once very clearly noticed\nat a sitting outside the Institute by M. Courtier. It would seem\nthat at this same seance the medium managed to liberate herself\nfrom both her neighbours for a moment (p. 525).\nIn the course of the seances some photographs were taken. The\nmedium, however, objected to their being taken unexpectedly, on\nthe ground that this might injure her : and this injunction was\ndeparted from in one case only when a partial levitation of the\ntable occurred in full darkness. The photograph this time revealed\nnothing particular, one way or the other. Some other photographs\nare, however, distinctly unfavourable to the medium's claims. They\nwere taken when the \" gueridon \" was being carried out of the\ncabinet : they show it in an exactly similar position three times in\nsuccession, and it is obvious that it is supported by the medium's\nhead. It is important to note that after Eusapia had seen the most\nsignificant of the photographs in question, this small table was never\nagain moved out of the cabinet, though this had constantly occurred\nbefore.\nA little strip of cloth which was found one day on the floor of\nthe seance-room, was ascertained from details of internal construction\nto correspond pretty closely (though, it is true, not completely) to\nthe \" spirits' veil,\" whose presence in impressions of \" materialised\nhands \" on clay and putty had been often noticed before. \" Nous\nl'enroulames sur nos doigts. Nous tenions un secret des empreintes\n\"\n(p. 538).\ncase of objective material ideoplasty : a vivid desire to lift a small object\nat a distance brings by association the idea of a thread which would answer\nthe purpose. This idea realises itself in a monoideio moment. In ordinary\nlife the siyht of a thread, that is certain vibrations of the ether, raise the\nidea of a thread ; here by virtue of the law of reversibility the contrary\nhappens ; the idea of a thread leads up to the sight, the objective ghost of\na thread, that is to certain vibrations of the ether. ... Is it a thing\ncreated from nothing? Is it the etheric body of a real thread? Is it idea\nmaterialised\u2014and with what matter ? Ether particles ? Atoms of the medium's\nbody? Of her dress? It is a mystery\" [Annates, March 1909, pp. 69-70).\nIt is sad to think that with such boundless horizons opening before their\neyes most people will doubtless wickedly prefer the most prosaic explanation\nof the incident !\n\fLIX.] Review. 579\nI pass over some other points of secondary or not decisive\nimportance.\nIt is of course quite possible (says the Report) that Eusapia's\npowers are now on the wane. M. Courtier himself noticed from\nyear to year a gradual weakening of her powers. Professional\nmediums would do wisely if they gave up their trade at a certain\nage, but as most. of them are poor and are not used to any other,\nthey must needs persevere.\nThe Report then goes on to consider whether certain occurrences\ndo not after all present in themselves \" some internal proof of\nauthenticity or fraud \"\n(pp. 540-544). A table weighing 7 kilogrammes\nby itself, and with an additional weight of 10 kilogrammes, was in\n1905 twice raised off the ground for several seconds. At another\nsitting, in the same year, it was levitated again, when the legs\nnearest the medium were protected with wooden sheaths. Messrs.\nCourtier and Yourievitch tried to imitate this phenomenon now\nwith one hand, now with both, now with the hands and feet,\nnow with the feet and knees only. Some measure of success was\nobtained, but the conditions at the sittings were different, the steno-\ngraphic record showing that when the levitation occurred, the\nmedium's feet and knees were \" absolutely under control \" and\nthere was no contact with the legs of the table; apart from this,\nthe latter remained in the air a good many seconds. Moreover, Messrs.\nCourtier and Yourievitch are much stronger physically than Eusapia.\nThen certain levitations which took place at the end of the seances\nand with everybody standing up, have also to be accounted for. Some\nreached as much as one metre, the medium's hands and feet being\n\" rigorously \" controlled.\nSome of the movements made by the \"gueridon\" also deserve\nattention. Sometimes, when placed at the medium's left, about one\nmetre from her, it moved either towards her or away, in accordance\nwith Eusapia's gestures. In the former case we cannot perhaps\nexclude altogether the possible action of a thread : but how about\nthe other kind of movement 1 A rod could not have been used\nwithout detection.\nAt the sitting of April 6, 1906, Eusapia had\u2014as already men-\ntioned \u2014allowed her feet to be attached to the legs of her chair\nwith strings. Her wrists had also been tied to those of Messrs.\nCurie and Feilding. Under these conditions M. Courtier, who was\nseated some distance behind M. Curie, distinctly saw the \" gueridon\n\"\nrise from the ground and could detect no hand touching it. The\n\f580 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nlittle table then went up as high as M. Curie's shoulders, was turned\nupside down and then gently placed in this position upon the central\ntable. None of the four investigators (M. Yourievitch besides those\nmentioned) under whose eyes the \" phenomenon \" took place could\ndetect any suspicious movement on the medium's part (p. 543).\n\" Des faits aussi nets donnent matiere a reflechir,\" remarks the\nReport a propos of this and similar incidents.\nOn the other hand, it notes the suspicious character of the\ntouches, of the movements of various objects in the cabinet and\nof the appearances of hands. It thinks that the sparks may have\nbeen due to \" peculiar electrisation of Eusapia's body discharging\nitself in the proximity of the other bodies.\"\nThese are the general conclusions arrived at\n\"(1) Les deplacements (avancements ou reculs) et les soulevements\n(partiels ou complets) de certains objets pesants (tables, gueridons)\nau voisinage d'Eusapia pendant les seances sont prouves par des\nenregistrements.\n\" (2) Certains de ces mouvements semblent se produire au simple\ncontact des mains ou des vetements du sujet et meme sans contact.\n\" Pendant les soulevements complets de la table devant laquelle\nil est assis ou des gueridons places a proximite de son corps, le\nsujet contracte la plupart du temps puissamment ses muscles.

No a priori conditions will be imposed upon them.\n\" We shall seek to discover in the facts, such as they present them-\nselves to us during the experiments, the antecedents necessary for\ntheir production.\"\nThese conclusions were discussed by the \" Section des recherches\npsychiques et psychologiques \" of the Institute on November 30th,\n1908 ; there being present Messrs. d' Arsonval (in the chair), Branly,\nCourtier, Favre, Comte A. de Gramont, Matisse, Maxwell, de Varigny,\nde Watteville, Vaugeois, and Yourievitch. The details of the dis-\ncussion (a most interesting one) are given, pp. 547-578.\nSo far as one can judge, some of the investigators (among them\nM. d'Arsonval) undoubtedly incline to believe in the genuineness\nof a few phenomena, chiefly the table-levitations and the movements\nof the \" gueridon,\" whilst remaining sceptical otherwise.\nI will not analyse this discussion here, one point excepted, to\nwhich I will return presently.\nSo much for M. Courtier's report on a most scientific series of\nexperiments carried out by a most eminent company.\nTo many it will probably appear that it might have been more\naffirmative. And it is certainly a matter of regret that after forty-\nthree seances extending over three years and some 25,000 francs\nspent, no more categorical pronouncement has been deemed possible.\nAs just mentioned, some of the phenomena have favourably impressed\nsome of the experimenters ; but nothing more. As stated by M.\nd'Arsonval himself (p. 563) \u2014\" nous n'avons pas de certitudes.\"\nSurely this is a pity. And in view of the importance of the\neffort made, more might have been expected.\n\f582 Count PerovsJcy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nBut on the other hand, if we take into account the extraordinary\ndifficulties inherent to such an investigation ; the a priori improbability\nof some of the phenomena ; the evasive and fugitive character of all of\nthem; the numerous frauds discovered; the unsatisfactory character of\nthe conditions at the sittings for adequate investigation, etc., etc.,\netc. \u2014the extreme cautiousness of the conclusions of the Report\nbecomes intelligible, and M. Courtier's remarks on the subject\ndeserve our approval (p. 546).\nIf I may be allowed an innocent joke, Eusapia's \"spirit-guide\"\nis primarily responsible for such a state of things. Let him improve\nhis methods first, \u2014and then we shall see. It may not, however,\nfollow that the method of the investigators themselves left nothing\nto be desired.\nConscious as I am of my extreme audacity when it comes to\ncriticising the modus procedendo of so distinguished a body, I will still\nask : What was the aim of the experiments 1 Was the authenticity\nor the objectivity of Eusapia's phenomena the subject of the inves-\ntigation 1\nIf the objectivity, then\u2014at first sight at least\u2014the aim was bril-\nliantly attained. For the very numerous experiments made with\nthe aid of various scientific apparatus made it absolutely certain\nthat the movements and \" levitations \" of tables, great and small,\nand some other things were most undoubtedly objective.\nThis is something. But it is not all : and the main question\nis, I submit, not whether the \" phenomena \" did occur, but what\nproduced them.\nHere the question assumes a different aspect. For we are told\nagain and again in the Report that all this scientific registering\n\"left the question of the genuineness of the phenomena themselves\nentirely untouched \" (p. 445 ; see also p. 553). This was indeed\nobvious already ; but these repeated assertions are characteristic.\nTo give an instance: when at the sitting of June 12th, 1905, the\n\"gueridon\" was repeatedly moved backwards and forwards, these\nmovements were registered by an ingenious mechanism and corre-\nsponding traces obtained. This is very satisfactory, of course\nbut the Report is careful to point out that \"ces traces n'indiquent\npas, bien entendu, de quelle maniere ont ete effectues les mouve-\nments successifs du meuble\" (p. 472). I confess it seems to me\nthat, if so, the experiment loses almost all its value. For the\nquestion to be answered was :\n\" What moved the '\ngueridon '\n1\nThe answer is: \"It really did move.\" Now this is no explanation\n\fReview. 583\nat all. And this sort of thing occurs again and again and to my\nmind is very unsatisfactory.1\nOn the other hand, the all-important question as to what among\nthe phenomena observed could and what could not have been duplicated\nby conjuring has received on the investigators' part comparatively\nlittle attention, if we except some valuable experiments by Messrs.\nCourtier and Yourievitch on artificial levitations of tables (pp. 540-\n542). The Report says (p. 539) that application was made in 1907\nto two professional conjurers, but nothing came of it, one being\nabsent from Paris and the other too busy ; and it does not seem\nthe attempt was renewed. I should have thought it was very\nwell worth renewing.\n1\nOther experiments conducted with Eusapia by scientific men seem to me\nto lie open to the same objection to a still greater extent. Take, for instance,\nthe experiments of Prof. Bottazzi, published in Annates des Sciences Psychiques,\n1907, No. 8-11. Here also we have most ingenious appliances for the graphic\nself- registering of the phenomena, both ''direct\" and \"indirect\" (see No. 8,\npp. 560-568 and passim). So far, so good ; but when it comes to ascertaining\nthe precise nature of the phenomena\u2014their authenticity or otherwise \u2014it is\naltogether another matter. In the very great majority of cases no details at\nall are given as to the way in which the medium was controlled. So-and-so\n\"was in contact\" with her\u2014this is an expression very often used; but as to\nhow this \"contact\" was realised\u2014whether E. P. allowed her hands to be held\nor not, etc. \u2014on these all-important points, on which, as a matter of fact, the\nwhole question has been turning for many years, the report is extraordinarily\nreticent. Such an attitude on the part of a man of science is not easily\nintelligible. Cf. also No. 11, p. 766, text and footnote, where the whole problem\nof the tricks played by Eusapia's hands and of their possible bearing on the\nnature of the phenomena is dismissed in seven lines and a half, it being asserted\nthat \" unconscious trickery consists simply (!) in the fact that as the mediumistic\nphenomena depend immediately on the psychical and physiological organism of\nthe medium, sometimes it is the natural limb which, instead of the mediumistic\nlimb, endeavours to execute the movement, to produce the phenomenon. And\nit seems as if this exchange were noticed by the medium herself, for she often\nsays: 'I have touched it myself, I have moved it myself\u2014when speaking of\nthe object touched or moved.\"\nImpartiality compels me, however, to say that among the episodes of these\nseances there is one (occurring three times in succession) similar to those to\nwhich I have repeatedly called attention in the case of D. 1). Home (Proceed-\nings, Part LV., page 401, Part LVL, pp. 441, 445) : that is\u2014the gradual melting\naway of the \"spirit hand\" when grasped (No. 11., pp. 760-761). As to whether\nsuch a circumstance tends to enhance Eusapia's reputation or to detract some-\nthing from Home's, opinions will probably differ. There are also other incidents\nwhich seem prima facie remarkable, but against these must be set not only\nthe remarks I have made but also the general tone of this report, which strikes\nme as being somewhat too lyrical.\n\f584 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nIn the course of the discussion of the Report's conclusions we\nfind M. Courtier saying\n\" Nous avons cause aujourd'hui meme avec des prestidigitateurs.\nlis nous ont dit qu'ils faisaient soulever des tables des quatre pieds\nsans contact apparent. Est-ce avec l'aide de comperes ou autrement ?\nlis ne nous l'ont pas revele \"\n(p. 567).\nSurely this is not a very encouraging postscript to all the detailed\naccounts of what was thought the most conclusive of Eusapia's\nperformances. Could not and ought not much more to have been\ndone in this direction 1\nNote also that all the imposing scientific machinery used on the\none hand did not prevent the learned investigators from adhering\non the other to methods of control which they admit themselves\n(pp. 517-518) to be altogether inadequate. I refer chiefly to the\nmethod of controlling Eusapia's hands. All the history of the\nexperiments conducted with her since 1892 abundantly shows that\nfor scientific purposes the method at present in use is valueless.\nWith a medium who, like the late Sambor, allowed his hands to\nbe constantly grasped in the strict sense of the word, the conviction\nof two separate persons that they were holding two separate hands\nmight have been sufficient for establishing the genuineness of the\n\" phenomena.\" With Eusapia Palladino, in view of the numberless\nfrauds practised and of the very unsatisfactory way in which her\nhands are \"held,\" we want something else. Otherwise investigation\nof the phenomena becomes a mere waste of time.\nI am well aware that (as stated in the Report) Eusapia will\nobject to certain methods of control, as a general rule ; and yet\nthis same report shows that at times she will give in (pp. 472, 518)\nand that positive results may yet be obtained. Why, I ask,\nwere not such exceptions generalised ? Would Eusapia's reluctance\nhave been really insuperable 1 Could not certain inducements have\nbeen used which she would not have withstood?\nShould mediums in the future always refuse to submit to such\nmethods of control as allowing both hands to be grasped by one person ;.\nor luminous strips to be pinned to their sleeves so as to make them\nvisible to all ; or their hands to be divided (on the table) by some\nkind of partition (so that one could not do duty for two)\u2014not to-\nmention possible tying or electrical \" tests,\" etc. \u2014a presumption\nagainst the authenticity of the \" manifestations \" would d la tongue be\nestablished which would finally outweigh all the positive evidence^\nwe possess.\n\fMX.] 585\nWhy, I ask, was not a decisive step made in this direction during\nthe Paris experiments 1\nThere are also other important omissions : for instance, it does\nnot appear whether the medium was ever searched, whether before\nor after the seance. Surely this ought to have been done in most\ncases at least.\nThen another remark. I suppose excerpts from the original\nstenographic records are given not only for the sake of \"illus-\ntrating\" such or such a \"class\" of phenomena, but also in order\nto enable the reader to appreciate the evidential character of certain\noccurrences. If so, I think these excerpts strangely incomplete\nat least in some instances. Here is a sample. At the sitting of\nJune 10th, 1907, Eusapia tries to lift up (\" supernormally \") the\n(movable) surface of a small table which had been placed on the\nseance-table. The record says: (p. 417)\n\" Elle approche sa tete de la petite table et le plateau de la\ntable se souleve.\n\"Mme. Curie. \u2014Elle a maintenant un souffle tres net sur la tete.\n\" Mme. Curie debout a cote de M. Yourievitch, met sa main sur\nle front d'Eusapia qui approche sa tete de la petite table. Le\nplateau mobile est souleve, la main de Mme. Curie se trouvant\nentre cette table et la tete d'Eusapia.\n\" (Controleurs : a gauche M. Yourievitch, a droite, M. Debierne.)\nn\nThis episode may or may not have seemed conclusive to the\neye-witnesses, but the reader is left in the dark as to the most\nessential details. Nothing is said either about the amount of light,\nor the position of Eusapia's hands, or about the \" curtain \"\u2014whether\nit was partly upon the table (and perhaps covering the medium's\nhands) or otherwise. Many more such instances could be adduced.\nI will now revert to the discussion of M. Courtier's Report by\nthe \"Section des recherches psychiques et psychologiques,\" and will\ndwell on some very instructive remarks of M. Favre's (pp. 572-574).\nA propos of some suggestions made as to the modus procedendo to\nbe adopted in future experiments with Eusapia, M. Favre insisted on\nthe desirability of investigating \" constantly or as much as possible\n\"\nin full light ; and formulated four hypotheses as to the reasons why\nlight should (supposedly) interfere with the phenomena\nFirst hypothesis. \u2014Some think that the medium objects to full\nlight because he is a mere fraud and because the light will reveal\nhis tricks. \" If this hypothesis is the true, the only true one, one\ncannot hope to succeed in operating in full light.\"\n\f586 Count Perovslcy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nSecond hypothesis. \u2014-Others think that light does really hinder the\nproduction of the phenomena by acting more or less directly on\nthe form of energy at work. Those who hold to this theory are\nneeds bound to experiment in attenuated light.\nBoth suppositions are discouraging ; but others may be imagined\nwhich, if true, would enable us to modify the experiments and\nfinally to achieve success with the condition of full light realised.\nThird hypothesis. \u2014Light interferes neither with the medium's tricks,\nnor with the energy producing the phenomena, but gives incon-\nvenience to the medium, \" who during the experiment is in a state\nof ocular hyperalgesia or hyperaesthesia,\" and is prevented by\nsuffering from displaying his special powers.\nTo obviate this difficulty some kind of bandage or opaque eye-\nglasses should be used and all the details of the protective\napparatus should be made the subject of special research.\nFourth hypothesis. \u2014Light interferes neither with the cheating, nor\nwith the phenomena, nor with the medium from a physiological\nstand-point. The reason is a psychological one. The medium on\naccount of his previous training is convinced that he CANNOT\noperate in full light. And such a suggestion (whether consciously\nor unconsciously made, coming from without or from the subject\nhimself) is an obstacle to his placing himself in the conditions\nnecessary for the experiment to succeed.\nIf this hypothesis be the true one, sittings might be conducted\nin the light, the unfavourable impression having been previously\ndestroyed by a counter-suggestion. To achieve such a result it\nmight be necessary to use hypnotism. In the case of Eusapia it\nwould not be difficult to find a man in whom she would feel con-\nfidence and who would have a sufficient knowledge of hypnosis.\nM. Favre added that he was inclined to believe that none of the\nfour hypotheses represented the whole truth and that the failure\nof the light seances was due to all the four factors combined. Still\nhe hoped that after the two last ones had been removed, experi-\nments in full light would be very near succeeding \" normally and\nconstantly.\"\nThe use of hypnotism to remove the medium's objection to sitting\nin the light seems to me well worth trying, though I am by no\nmeans hopeful as to the results. In any case M. Favre's idea is\na very ingenious one.\nBut is not all this insistence on \"light,\" however natural, some-\nwhat exaggerated 1 In the first place darkness may after all be a\n\fLix.] Review. 587\nnecessary condition of the supposed phenomena, or at least most\nof them. There is nothing d priori improbable in this. If so,\nfurther insistence on this point becomes a mere waste of time.\nSecondly, light at a sitting does not by any means afford us a guarantee\nthat the phenomena are genuine. With Eusapia herself many things\nwere observed to occur in the light (as stated by several of the\ninvestigators in the course of the discussion); more than this, her\nseances are seldom if ever held in total darkness ; and yet the\ncontroversy as to the authenticity of the \"manifestations\" or other-\nwise is still going on and I am afraid is not likely to cease soon. And\nhow about such a \"phase\" of the \"Physical Phenomena \"as \"Indepen-\ndent Slate-writing,\" which invariably takes place in the light, with\nwhat results the psychical researcher well knows 1 It is not so\nmuch light we want, as a radical change in the general conditions.\nI want to hold the medium, not as he or she allows me, but as I\nchoose to ; I want him or her to be searched whenever the idea\nenters into my mind; if an object is being \" supernormally \" moved,\nI want to ascertain exactly how it is moving; if levitated, I\nwant to make a whole circuit round it with my hand, nay, a\nseries of circuits to make sure there is nothing which supports it \u2014\nnot even a \"ghost of a thread,\" anywhere; if a \"materialised form\"\nappears I want to press it tenderly to my bosom and then patiently\nwait until it gently fades away in that position. I want all this and\nmuch more ; but if all these conditions were granted to me, or\neven only the most fundamental of them, I should be ready not\nto insist too much on light.\nIt should also be remembered that when insufficient, \"light\" is\nfor evidential purposes as bad as\u2014and may be worse than\u2014total\ndarkness. When sitting in a dark room I am able to give the whole\nof my attention to controlling through two senses only, \u2014touch and\nhearing. And there is about a \"dark\" seance a certain unpre-\ntentiousness which makes it almost sympathetic ! Accounts of a\n\" dark \" seance are not calculated to create a very favourable im-\npression as to the medium's claims ;\nnajr\n,\nthe very fact of his or her\ngiving \"dark\" seances puts people on their guard. With the \"light\"\nsittings as they are now given, the case is different. The room\nbeing soi-disant lighted, I am expected first to see what happens\nand then to describe what I have seen to others. In the first\nstage I \u2014in most cases\u2014merely strain my eyes and do damage to\nmy eye-sight, broadly speaking, to no purpose ; in the second I\nallow my imagination full play, and mislead others, if I have only\n\f588 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nbeen in the slightest degree favourably impressed ; and even if I\nhave not I am likely to help in creating about the medium a\nfavourable reputation as a \"light-lover.\"\nTo return to Eusapia : a \" light seance \" of hers with the curtain\nis, I think, evidentially, at least, equivalent to a totally dark seance.\nWhen first introduced this curtain was supposed to serve a reason-\nable purpose ; it would ensure for part of the room the necessary\ncondition of darkness whilst allowing the medium to remain in full\nview. As a matter of fact it simply complicates matters, hampers\ninvestigation and, generally speaking, plays a part, which\u2014with all\ndue respect to the medium\u2014I may be permitted to call simply\ndisreputable !\n1\nA serious improvement is needed here also.\nI note by the way that in the course of the same discussion\nreference was more than once made to another medium\u2014a Pole\nnamed \"Janek\" (or rather Jan Guzik ;\nProceedings S.P.E., Part\nLIL, p. 409), M. Yourievitch recommending him to the Institute's\nattention and remarking that his absolute \" placidity \" makes him\nvery suitable for investigation (p. 577).\nI therefore think it appropriate for me to state that I believe\nthis medium to be a fraud, and this not only because he has been\nrepeatedly exposed and because he is admitted to cheat by his\nmost ardent admirers, but also from personal experience\u2014not very\nexhaustive, it is true, but careful and sufficient. (See pp. 231-237\nof my \"Appendix\" to my Eussian translation of Mr. Podmore's\nModern Spiritualism.) In my opinion \" Janek \"\u2014unless he thoroughly\namends\u2014does not deserve the honour of a scientific investigation\nand his case is instructive chiefly as showing what kind of evidence\nwill satisfy the average Spiritualist.\n1\nIt has in particular a certain way of being thrown over the table and cover-\ning the medium's hands which may very well serve a certain purpose, only it\nwill not be the purpose of scientific research. When its lower end is thus\nspread over E. P.'s hands she will still keep on moving them, at times showing\none or both, at times concealing them again. And while this is going on,\n\"phenomena\" will occur now and then, and it requires a certain straining of\nattention to note whether both hands were visible simultaneously with such\nand such \"manifestations\" or not. At times a hand will also appear between\nthe two halves of the curtain ; and as the result of all this hand-moving the\nsitters may very easily be led to believe that they saw all the three hands at\nonce, whilst in fact they did not. At some sittings with E. P. in St. Petersburg\nin the spring of 1898 I specially noticed that this was just the case ; and yet\nat least one other sitter was found to believe and assert the contrary, until I\npositively assured him that he was mistaken. In the present instance, therefore,\nlight engenders an error for which there would have been no room in the dark.\n\fLIX.] Review. 589\nWere I now asked to sum up in one word the impression all these\nrecent Eusapian investigations have left on me I would answer\n\" DISCOURAGEMENT.\"\nThe main question has not progressed. Results tangible and posi-\ntive have, it is true, been obtained ; but only in a region where\nthere was no need for them. And even here I doubt whether\nthere is not in the evidence a serious logical flaw. The objective\nreality of the occurrences has been established ; but is it not open\nto those who will cling to the hallucination theory quand meme to\nmaintain that as these occurrences may after all have been fraudulent,\nproof of the objectivity of genuine phenomena is still lacking? And\nI confess I do not well see how such an argument could be met\nSo that even in this direction real progress is more doubtful than\nwould at first sight appear. As for the authenticity\u2014well, we are\ncertainly no more advanced than, say, after the lie Eoubaud, nay\neven after the Milan experiments, which laid, seventeen years ago, the\nfoundation-stone of Eusapia's reputation. The great bulk of the\nphenomena has not by any means been proved to be due to fraud\nunmitigated\u2014far from it ! aud a few have come within measurable\ndistance of the required standard. But not one of them has after all\nbeen clearly shown to he authentic.\nNor do I see good reasons for feeling very sanguine as to the\nfinal outcome of future investigations.\nP.S. \u2014Since writing the above I have read in the July Journal\nS.P.R. the abstract from the report by Messrs. Feilding, Baggally,\nand Carrington on their recent investigation at Naples. After reading\nit, I certainly feel in a more optimistic mood on the subject. The fact\nthat such experts in the domain of conjuring should have been\nconverted by what they saw to a belief in the genuineness of E.P.'s\nphenomena is eminently significant and satisfactory. I also heartily\nwelcome their methods of investigation, and think the absence of\nimposing technical appliances more than compensated for by some\nof the results obtained. In view of the latter circumstance I confess\nI should be happy to see a similar course of action uniformly adopted\nin the future, even by scientific stars of the first magnitude.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nINDEX to VOL.
