Publisher: Tantrik Press.\n\n Corporate author:  Tantrik Order in America \/ International Tantrik Order.  The only issue known is called vol. 5, no. 1 which is probably the only one since the name of the organization was copyrighted the same year.  In some printings this is called \"external Issue.\"   This was the journal published by \"Oom the Omnipotent\" (Dr. Pierre Arnold Bernhard, 1875-1955).  On him and his Tantrik Order, see Hugh B. Urban,  \"The Omnipotent Oom: Tantra and Its Impact on Modern Western Esotericism,\" Esoterica: journal of Esoteric Studies 3 (2001): 218-39, online at http:\/\/esoteric.msu.edu.  The volume is rather an extended (almost 200 pages) nosegay of quotations on the virtues of tantra and of phallicism generally and was obviously intended to introduce and promote Bernhard's order.
