His book The System in Which We Live (1998)&nbsp;seeks to reconcile paranormal phenomena with scientific methodology.

He joined the RAF, then in 1942 left to work on financial investigations in industry for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, which involved extensive travel. His professional skills were notable in the field of accountancy and statistics. &nbsp;He was a management consultant for Unilever for many years and a member of the Royal Institution.   Psychical Research\n\nOram joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1946 and was co-opted to its governing council in 1953, where he served for ten years before resigning to focus on his management consultancy. He later returned, becoming honorary secretary in 1984 and then a vice-president.\n\nHe was a member of the Astrological Society and spent time collecting astrological data (unpublished).  ESP\n\nOram was intrigued by accounts of card-guessing experiments in JB Rhine\u2019s Extra-Sensory Perception (1934). He decided to try doing such experiments himself in his hotel room during long periods of travel in connection with his work. He carried out personal but formal testing and discovered significantly high scores in his guesses (p = 0.00006). He wrote-up his experiments in a paper and sent it to the magazine Nature which, to his surprise, published it.1  Mediumship and Survival\n\nOram devoted considerable energy into the investigation of mediums. His wife had mediumistic abilities, and he believed she made contact with him after her death.2\n\nIn his 1998 book The System in Which We Live, Oram discusses his belief in the existence of the mind as a separate entity and rejection of \u2018materialistic interpretations of the mind-body relationship [and] Cartesian dualism\u2019.3 &nbsp;He discusses alleged communications from the dead, approving claims by Konstantin Raudive to have discovered a new channel of communication in so-called \u2018electronic voice phenomena\u2019 (EVP) and also defends Helen Duncan\u2019s mediumship. He argues that, \u2018Once we can all agree on the importance of the world of mind and its position in a set of dimensions utterly different from those of physics, we shall be on the most vital road to a fundamental understanding of our subject.\u20194  Works  Books\n\nThe System in Which We Live (1998).
