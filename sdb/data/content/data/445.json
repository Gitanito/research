(a friend of the\nEditor's), of various phenomena, obser\\'ed by herself and others, in the\nhouse, in a country village, where she and her mother reside. Before\nthe events recorded, Miss S. had no belief in the posllibility of such\nphenomena, and she long resisted the idea of their having any abnormal\norigin.\nThe undated accounts were a.ll written during the winter of 1887-8.\nThe dates on the left side of the page are not the dates of writing.\nFOOTSTEPS, &0.\nMIss S. writes:-\nThe first thing that struck us as peculiar about our house was hearing\nfootsteps in empty roOmB.\nJanuary 8th, 1885.\u00b7-We had been in the house about six montAs. My\nmother and I were in the dining-room; there was one maid in the houseand\nno one else. I was lying half asleep on the sofa. I heard someone walking\nup and down in the room overhead, which was then a spare bedroom (now\na drawing-room). I was too sleepy at first to think it strange, though my\nmother more than once tried to caJl my attention to it. At last IIhe roulled\nme and said someone was in the house. The hells were ringing for Evensong,\nso it must have been between half-past four and five. I got up and listened,\nand I then noticed the footsteps were heavy, like a man's, and that they\nwent backwardsand forwards as if he were going from the washhand-stand to\nthe dreaaiDg-table and back again, not hurriedly, and not slowly; in fact, for\nthe moment, it gave one the impression someone was dreaaing for dinner. I\ncaJled the maid and we a.ll three heard the steps. We took our dog, a Skye-\nterrier, knowing he would make a noise at a stranger, and went upstairs. I\nput the dog iBto the room fint; he was quite quiet. I do not remember if\nhe seemed frightened, but I think he ran out again. The room was quite\nempty. I was so certain someone must be there that I even looked in a\nlarge cupboard, but that, too, was empty. Still, my mother was not\ncontented, but sent for the gardener to come and aee if anyone could be on\nthe roof. He said no one could be there ; the roof slants. As we went\ninto the room my mother said abe heard a sound like acrash of glaaa; there\nwas no broken glaaa anywhere.\nThe next time, as nearly as I can remember, was on the 22nd of January;\nsince then we have not kept much count.\nLast winter a lady was staying with us. She caJled me into the dining-\nroom to ask who wu in the drawing-room. I heard the footsteps but I was\nDigitized by Google\n\f242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1888.\nnearly certam no one could be in there, as I had put two boxes on the step\nleading to the drawing-room ready for the maid to take to the box-room.\nHowever, to make sure, I went and looked, and the boxes had not been\nmoved.\nAt nights I have heard footsteps in the passage outside my bedroom (blue-\nroom).\nI was sleeping in the green bedroom, one night last winter, when I heard\nfootsteps like a child, with bare feet, running acrosa a piet'.e of oilcloth\nthat goes from one door to another.\nI cannot say how often I have heard footsteps at one time and another in\ndifferent parts of the house.\nOne afternoon I was quite alone in the houae. Miss Blencowe had come\nto stay with me. I was obliged to leave her while I went into the village for\na few minutes. She was sitting in the pink sitting-room. She afterwards\ntold me she had heard someone walking about in the room overhead, which\nwas the green-room.\nThe other day our German maid, who knows nothing about the ghost, came\nand told me someone had been walkingabout in my bedroom. I told her there\nwas no one in the house to do so, but she persisted in what she said.-F. S.\nAccount from EMILIE THORNE, a servant, as to whom Miss S. writes, \u2022\u2022 Emilie\nwas the last of us to give in and acknowledge that she could not under-\nstand what she saw and heard.\" She has never had abnormal\nexperiences in any other place.\nI was in the passage upstairs. There waa no one elae in the houae but my\nmistresa. I heard the hall door open and close, and heavy footsteps. Thinking\nsomeone had got into the houae I ran downstairs, but found the hall door\nlocked.I went through the bottom of the house and found aU the doors locked_\nIt was impo88ible for anyone to have got into the houae. I then went and\ntold my miatreas.\nIn October,1887,I was aleeping in the green-room. A little girl was sleeping\nwith me; there was no one else in the houae. I was awoke by hearing some-\none walking about the room; the room shook with the footateps; I atarted up\nthinking it was the childwalking in her aleep. The gas was up enough for me to\nsee around the room. Thereare two doors; I had locked themboth before going\nto bed. I said, \"Winnie, ia thatyou7\" I then saw the child was asleep. lheard\nthe door leading into the bathroom creak, and saw it open and clole again.\nI have often, both day and night, heard footstep. in the hall, drawing-\nroom, passage upstairs and green-room.\nI was sitting in the pink-room last autumn, when both doors (it ia a\npassage room) openedtwice. I got up and closed them, and they opened again.\nMy siater, Polly Trays, and I were sitting in the same room. Both doors\nopened together. There was no wind. It was about half-past nine. The\nhoule was locked up for the night. There was no one in the house but my\nsister'. baby. Polly said, \"Who can that be walkingabout in t.he green-roemf'\nI heard the footsteps, but knew no one could be in the konae.\nI was writing a letter, one evening; the candle was on the table, the doors\nand window were closed. There was no draught. The candle suddenly\nwent out.-EKn.m THORNE.\nDigitized by Google\n\fApril, 1888.] Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. 243\nAccount from MRS. S.\nI was in the bathroom; one door was closed, the otker open. 1 sa.w the\nclosed door open, and heard footsteps pas\" through.\nI was sitting in the dining-room. 1 was alone in the house ; everyone\nhad gone to church. I heard footsteps, and a child laugh and clap Its hands\njust behind my chair.\nI have seen the door leading from the green-room into the bathroom\nopen and close.\nI have heard footsteps in the drawing-room, green-room.-C. A. M. S.\nAccount from MIss AUOBMUTZ, of 12, Montpellier Grove, Cheltenham.\nMarch, 1888.\nI was sitting ill the dining-room one morning a few days ago talking to\nEmilie Thome. The only other person in the house was Miss S., who\nwas up in her room. 1 distinctly heard someone coming down the stairs\n(whicli. Me just outside the dining-room door). Whoever came down stopped\noutside the door for a second or two, then walked across the hall, and back\nagain upstairs. Of course, I thought it was Miss S., until she came in a\nfew minutes after, and told me she had only then come out of her room\nfor the first time.\n1 have three or four times heard noises as of people walking up and down\nthe drawing-room, when in the room underneath, knowing that there was\nnobody upstairs.\nMISS S. continues:-\nSTRANGE NOISES, WHISPERINGS, &0., &0.\nOne n4tht, when I was sleeping in the green bedroom, I felt my bed,\nwhich is a very large, heavy one, shake, and then I heard sometlling knock-\ning on it.\nAnother time I was awoke just as tho clock struck three by hearing a\nloud noise, a8 if some heavy substance were being struck by a pibce of iron;\nthero were about 25 blows. The next morning one of the maids told\nEmilie that she had not been able to sleep since three o'clock, as\nMiss Humble, .who slept over her, had been knocking about her iron\nbedstead. Miss Humble, before I spoke. complained that she had been\ndisturbed, and described the sa.me kind of noise.\nDecember 10th, 1887.-My mother and Emilie were both with me in the\nblue bedroom; the other maid was in bed. We heard a door bang down-\nstairs. A few minutes after, I went into the passa.ge and heard some one\ncrushing a piece of paper. I looked up and down, but could not see anyone.\nSome nights ago there was so much noise downstairs. between 11 and 12,\nthat 1 lit a candle and went down to see, but all was quiet.\nJanuary 24th, 1888.-1 was cioming upstairs, and heard something coming\nup after me. I thought it was one of the dogs, and kept looking first on ono\nside and then on the other, but I could not see anything; I could only hear.\nI was in the drawing-room (it was then my mother's bedroom), in the\nwinter ot 1885 or 1886, about eight o'clock one evening; the gas was lighted\nenough for me to see round the room, when I heard a gruff voice behind me.\nx 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f244 Journal of &ciety for Psychical Research. [April,1888.\n1 could not distinguish the words, but thought it was the parrot mocking\nsomeone she had heard ill the street. I turned quickly and there was no one.\nI then remembered the parrot was downstairs. I remained a few minutes,\nbut heard nothing more.-F.S.\nAccount from EMILIB THORNE.\nAbout the spring, three years ago, I was sitting sewing in the room that\nis now a drawing-rooul. I heard some whispering behind my chair. I\njumped up to see what it was. I said, .. Is that you, ma'am 1\" thinking it\nmust be my miatreaa, when I found I was alone. I felt nervous, so took my\nwork downstairs.\nI was sitting working in the pink bedroom when something shook my\nchair. Thinking it was the dog, I took no notice, and it happened again. I\nthen got up and looked for the dog, and found the room quite empty abd the\ndoor shut. I sat down again, and heard )Vhispering and footsteps. I then\ncalled my sister to sit with me.\nI have heard noises as if the furniture were being knocked about, and\nmy name, Emilie, has been called several timea.-EMILIB THORNE.\nAccount from MIss AucHMUTz.\nMarch,I888.\nOne night just after the clock had struck 12 (I was occupying Mias\nS.'s room with her) we both heard the garden gate open and slam, and\nthen a good deal of talking, which appeared to be in the next room to us,\nwhere Mrs. S. and Emilie Thorne were. We both thought they had\nheard the noise and were looking out of their window to see what it was.\nThe talking went on for somo minutes. In the morning they told us they\nhad not talked at all. There was no one elae in the house. We heard the\ngate wm again when the talking had ceased. I have never seen anything\nsupernatural, or heard anything either, until this month, when I have been\nstaying with Mrs. S. While I was saying my prayers one night in the\nblue-room, which is the room next the drawing-room, where I heard the\nwalking about, I heard someone breathing hard, almost like snoring.-\nHBLBN AuClnlUTz.\nMIss S. continues:-\nAPP.A.lI.ITIONS, &C.\n1 was coming down the p&BBage, one afternoon, about half-past four. I\nI&W a fair\u00b7haired girl standing on the top of the stairs. It was dusk. I did\nnot notice her face, but supposed it to be the maid; she was dressed in a\ngreyish or mauve dress, such as would have been very common for servants\nsome years ago. AI we were in mourning at the time, I was surprised that\nthe girl should have had 011 a coloured dress when she knew it wo~d be\nagaiDst our wish. In a minute or two I weDt downstairs and found the\nmaid, &I usual, in black ; nor had she been uplltairs.\nIn Ootober, 1886, I was, one afternoon, quite alone in the house. My\nmother and the maids were out, but I sent for Miss Blencowe to come and\nstay with me. Before she came I had locked the doors (three) leading into\nme garden, leaving only the hall door unlocked. We were sitting in a little\nroom out of the hall, when I thought J heard some one walk across the hall.\nThinking i' must be the gardener, who, unable to get in at the back door, had.\nDigitized by Google\n\fApriI,1888.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 245\ncome through to unfasten one of the pantry doors, I went out to make sure,\nand, I suppose, to see what he wanted; but the hall was empty, and the\npantry door leading into the garden locked. I went back and sat down a\nsecond, and a third time. I thought someone was in the house. I said to\nmy friend, \"I must go upstairs and see if all be safe; I am afraid someone\nis in the house.\" Miss Blencowe followed 'me. I went into the rooms,\nclosing the doors and windows as I went. When I came out of my own\nroom, I said to Miss Blencowe (without looking round), half in fun, \"It must\nbe the ghost.\" I then went down the back stairs, and so back to our room\nwhere we had been sitting. When we got there MlBB Blencowe said to me,\n\" What do you mean by saying it is the ghost 7\" I answered, still half in\nfun, \"This house is haunted.\" Miss Blencowe said, \"Is it haunted by a\nwoman dressed in mauve, and does she stand at the top of the stairs 7\"\nWondering what she meant, but never thinking for a moment she had seen\nanything, I said, \"Yes, it is; but, why do you ask 7\" She said, \"I have\nseen such a figure.\" She then went with me and showed me the place\nwhere I had seen the girl some time before.\nAccount from MISS BLENCOWB, 37, Montpellier Terrace, Cheltenham.\nN O1Jember 24th, 1887.\nOctober lBt, 1886, 6 p.m., I was spending the afternoon with MiBB S.,\nat . There were only ourselves in the house, Mrs. S. and\nthe maid being from home for a few hours. We were startled by the\nbanging of doors, BO much BO we thought we would go round the premises and\nfasten the doors, even going into cellars to satisfy ourselves that all was safe.\nWe then returned to the kitchen and turned our attention to making some\ncotree, but not finding all the necessary things, MiBB S. went up to her\nroom to fetch the store-room keys. Being quite dark, she lighted the gas, 1\nhaving followed her, she left me in the room, going down by the back staircase\ntothe kitchen. I called to her t.o know if I should turn the light out, and stood\nbetween the door and the passage while' waiting for the reply.\nI saw the figure of a young girl, dreBBed in a lilac print dress, about\nlift. 3in. in height, standing on the top of the front stairs, looking in the\ndirection of where I stood. The principal thing I noticed about her was the\nwhiteness of the parting of her hair, and the peculiar colour of her gown.\nI looked at her till she gradually faded away, not feeling the least bit\nfrightened, but only intensely cold and numb while she was visible.\nAfter the disappearance of the figure, I went down and told Miss S.\nof the occurrence. She then said it was one of the ghosts I had seen.\nMy second experience was on the evening of February19th,I887, between\nthe hours of eight and nine o'clock.\nOn this occasion there were 12 people present, including myself.\nI was seated by the fireplace, Mrs. S. on the BOfa directly opposite, facing\nthe open door. A lady was sitting by her, and the dog ,Bruce was lying\nat his mistress's feet.\nOne of the company was playing at the time, when all at once the dog\nuttered a piercing shriek and rushed madly down the stairs into the hall.\nDigitized by Google\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1888.\nI, feeling the same coldness and numbness as before, turned my head,\nand saw the figure of the girl within a few feet of where I was simng,\nlooking straight at me.\nIt remained for a second or so, then gradually disappeared. I went down\nand asked Mrs. S. and the lady who had been sitting by her, if they\nhsd seen anything, to which they replied in the negative.\nMIss S. continues:-\nDecember lOlli, 1887.-Not foeling well, I was lying in bed about half-\npast eight in the morning. Emilie came into my room in a hurry and asked\nwhat was the matter, as I was knocking about the furniture. I told her I was\nnot doing anything of the kind; as 1 was in bed 1 could not boo About 20\nminutes passed and she came up again to know if I called, saying some one\nhad called her three times. Soon after, my mother came in to speak to me ;\nthere was no one else in the house bllt the German maid, and she was down-\nstairs. In a few minutes Emilie ran back into my room, looking frightened,\nand saying she had seen a figure standing on the top of the stairs, dressed in\nwhite, which alie thought to be my mother till she heard her talking in my\nroom.-F. S.\nAccount from EMILIE THORNE.\nI was in the hall, which is under the blue bedroom. I heard a knocking-\nabout, such as a chair banging on the floor. I went upstairs to see what W&B\nwanted. Twice more 1heard the noises, but took no notice ; then th ree times\nI hoard some one ca.ll Emilie. 1 went upstairs but no one had ca.lled. Going\nup the back staircase, 1 went to my mistress's room. Not finding her there,\nwalked down the passage and,as 1 thought, saw her standing on the top olthe\nstairs looking down. The figure was about my mistress's height (6ft. 3in.),\nand dressed in light things. I did not notice her .very closely, for when I\nheard voices in the blue bedroom 1 knew it was not my mistress I saw, and,\nI got frightened and ran back into the bedroom.-ElIIILIE THORNE.\nAccount from MRs. S.\nOne Dlght 1 was awakened about 11 o'clock (I was then sleeping in\nroom over dining-room) by a voice calling \"Mother.\" nelieving it to 1?e my\ndaughter's voice, I went to her room and listened outside her door. Hesring\nnothing I went to the maids' room, and found them both asleep. I returned to\nbed and was again roused by footsteps coming up the steps outside my room,\nand immediately after heard \"Mother\" .repeated. I again got up and\nwithout a candle proceeded again to my daughter's room. I opened the door,\nkeepin~ ~he handle in my hand, and asked \"Did you call 1\" She answered,\n\"No; yCJ)J. have woke me, why have you come 1 What time is it 7.. I\nanswered 11, and then left her. During the few minutes in my daughter's\nroom, I never left the handle of the door out of my hand.\nMIss S. continues, with respect to the same occa.sion :-\nA few seconds elapsed after I had asked what o'clock it was; time enough\nfor my mother to leave the room. She then-or someone like her-a\nwoman with dark hair, and wearing a red (what I believed to be a) dressing-\njacket, bent over me. The figure held a candle in her hand, and said,\n\" Won't you kiss me 1.. I had been lying with my face to the wall, but I\nturned round, sat up, and kissed something which I quite believed toO be my\nDigitiZ~d by Google\n\fApril, 1.888.] J owrnal Of Society' for Psychical Research. 247\nmother. Since then my mother has again and again been roused.. Now she\ndoes not come unleBB she hears my bell.\nLast New Year's eve, December, 1887, my mother, Emilie, and I were in\nthe drawing-room putting up some brackets. Suddenly, Emilie ran to the\ndoor saying someone was standing on the top of the stairs. I followed her,\nbut no one was to be seen. It would have been quite impoBBible for any\nhuman being to have gone downstairs so quickly; we could see up the passage\nand down the stairs.-F. S.\nAccount from EMILIE THORNE.\nI was in the drawing-room a little after six on New Year's eve, and I saw\na figure dressed in light things (I thought it was the cook) standing on the\ntop of the stairs, looking down. She had her hand up beckoning me. I ran\nto the door, but no one was to be seen. In that second no one could have\ngot out of sight.-EMiLm THORNE.\nMIss S. continues:-\nJanuary, Sunday, 22nd, 1888.-1 was in the drawing-room about\n11 o'clock in the evening. The door was open; our German maid was in bed\nand my mother had gone into my bedroom. I heard Emilie come upstairs and\npause outside the door, and then go down the passage to her own\nroom. I did not look up. There was a screen between the door and myself ;\nDOt a high screen. I was surprised Emilie did not come right into the room\nand see if I wanted anything. Soon after, I went to bed, but, on looking out\nof my window, I saw the reflection of gas, so went into the passage and saw\nthe light was left quite up ; the one on the top of the stairs. I turned it\nout and went back to bed. The next morning Emilie mentioned that she was\ncoming into the drawing-room the previous evening, but that, as my mother\nhad croBBed the room and pushed the door to while she was there, she\nsupposed we wanted to be alone, and so had turned out the gas on the top of\nthe stairs and gone to bed. I told her my mother had not been in the room\nwhen she came upstairs, but she kept repeating that someone had pushed to\nthe door while she was there; it did not seem to strike her for a moment\nthat she had seen one of the ghosts. I asked her what made her so certain\nit was my mother, and she said because she had on her light dreBBing-gown.\nMy mother happened not to have on her light dressing-gown at all, but was\u00b7\nin red ; besides, as I said before, she was in my bedroom at the time. The\ndreBBing-gown is not uulike, in colour, the dress worn by the girl who stands\non the top ofthe stairs, and might easily be mistaken for it. It is strange\nthat Emilie turned out the gas and I found it up.-F. S.\nAccount from EMILIE THORNE.\nI came upstairs, and was going into the drawing-room. I saw Miss FloBB\n[Miss S.] but did not at first notice my mistreBB. Just then she (as I\nthought) came and pushed to the door in my face. It was a figure in a\nlight garment. I did not notice the face. I felt quite certain it must be my\nmistress, because there was no one else in the house it could be. I then\nturned out the gas on the top of the stairs and went to bed. I am quite\ncertain I turned out the gas.\nThe following is another mention, written some weeks earlier, of two\nof these experiences :-\nDigitized by Google\n\f248 Journal of Society \/0'1' Psychical Resea!1'ch. [April, 1888.\nOn December 10th last I saw a figure dressed in light clothes standing\non the top of the stairs, and again last Saturday, at about 10 minutes put\nsix, I saw the fi~ure in the same place; then it had its hand raised.\nAccount of other ApparitioDB from EMILIE THORNE.\nI was standing in the garden one Sunday afternoon, and, looking up to\nthe attic window, I saw a man, a dark, swarthy-looking man, with long\nblack whiskers; his coat was buttoned up tightly, and he was dressed like a\nmerchant sailor. I have often seen that man in the same place.\nIn September, 1887, Miss Blencowe came in one evening after church;\nmy sister Polly was in the pink bedroom. I heard the gate open and close with\na bang. Polly came down and asked me to come to bed. After MilS Blencowe\nwas gone I went upstairs. Polly said to me, \u2022\u2022 Whata shame, Miss Blencowe's\nsister waiting outside at this time of night, and dressed in white.\" I said,\n\" What do you mean 1Miss Blencowe's sister has not been outside.\" Polly\nsaid, \"I heard the gate open, and looking uut of the window saw someone\ndressed in white, walking quickly up and down the garden; she then went\nout of the lower garden gate. I then closed the window, but wondering if\nshe were gone, because then Miss Blencowe would be gone as well. I looked\nout again, and saw her walk from our gate to the gate of the house on the\nother side of the road. and there stand.\nAbout be o'clock in the evening [very recently, but date is forgotten]\nI thought I saw Miss Flo standing with her head. leaning against the dining-\nroom door. The figure had on a light dress, and her hair down. As I came\nthrough the hall nearer to her, she vanished. The dining-room door was\nclosed at the time.-EMILIB THORNE.\nAccount of MARy TRAys,* sister of Emilie Thorne, sent to Miss S.\nin February, 1884 :-\n18, Claremont Street, Plymouth.\nYou asked me on your last letter to relate to you all that I saw that was\nodd. When I was up with Emilie, the first thing I saw was in the garden\nwhen Emilie was to church. It was like a man with a long, dark beard. [This\nwas in the middle of the day.] And one evening when Mias Blencowe came\nrather late, Emilie went and left me upstairs. I heard the garden gate\nopen, and I went to the window, and I saw a white figure walk up and\ndown, and I was frightened. The strange footsteps Emilie, perhaps, can\nl'elate to you better than I can write.-MARY TR.us.\nMISS S. sends her Mother's account, dictated, as follows :-\nMy mother says :-\" On the 29th of December, 1887, I was alone in the\nhouse, except the German maid, who was downstairs. I was coming down the\nattic stairs; my littleYorkshire-terrier Will.! in front of me. A girl with fair hair,\nin a lilac dress, passed me ; ahe looked right into my face ; she was very pale,\nand had something the matter with one of her eyes. The dog gave a howl,\nand dashed down to the dining-room. By the time I got into the passage she\nwas gone. As I went down the stairs to the dining-room the German came\nto ask if L had rung, as the bell had been pulled violently.\nI trU coming down the pU&age some time ago. I saw a woman before\n* As to this witness, we learn, on good authority, that she\" might fancy\nthings,\" and her flvidence must be estimated accordingly.\nDigitized by Google\n\fApril, 1888.1 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 249\nme. I thought it was one of the maids ; she went into the blue bedroom. I\nfollowed; but the room was empty. My little dog, a Skye-terrier, ran back\ninto thesitting-room, and jumped up on to a chair, where he sat shivering.\nAbout the end of December, 1887, I was lying awake, when I saw a\nwoman, with brown hair hanging down her back. (My bedroom is a double\none, with curtains between.) She was standing, holding back one of the\ncllJ'tains. She had on a slate-coloured silk dress and a red kind of opera\ncloak. She remained three or four minutes.\"\nAccount sent to Miss S. by MISS HUMBLE, from 15, The Terrace,\nGrosvenor Street, St. Heliers, Jersey.\nJarvuary 25th, 1888.\nI send the account of what I saw at two separate times while we were\nwith you, but it is not very much I have to tell. The first time I sa.wanything\nwas one night (1 think in February), somewhere between 11 and 12\nwhen I had been fast asleep, and woke up suddenly broad awake as if I had\nbeen forced to do so. I noticed the fire still burning brightly, and was then\nattracted by the figure of a woman standing close to me, and leaning against\nthe chimney-piece comer. I could hardly see the face, as it was turned from\nme, but she had hair reaching halfway down her back, and seemed to be\ndressed in a sort of loose Garibaldi body, and ordinary gathered skirt of a\ngreyish tint. I noticed all that at a glance, and even the burnish the fire-\nlight gave to the hair, which seemed of \" light brown colour, and wavy. If\nI had not been afraid of waking mother, I think I should have spoken, for I\ndid not feel afraid, but the figure vanished and did not reappear. The next\ntime was two days before we left, when I woke up suddenly, also to see, not\na woman, but, at the comer of the fireplace furthest from me, a very evil-\nlooking man dressed in what might be a white working suit. The eyes\nwere dark and fixed on me, and I own I was frightened,their expression was\nso horrible, and I dared not look up again at once, and when I did he had\ngone. But I could not forget it for soine days, and don't like to think of it\nnow. Those were the only times I ever saw anything, and I know for\ncertain that I was awake, and not dreaming I Mother heard the heavy\nfootsteps in the drawing-room when we knew nobody could be there, as the\ndoorway was barred. And I also heard the piano being played that Sunday\nmorning, as perhaps you may remember, when I thought it was Miss\nBlencowe practising a chant, and on inquiry afterwards found no one had\nbeen near the room at all. 1heard it distinctly as I walked along the passage,\nand opened the door expecting to find someone at the piano, when to my\nsurprise the room was empty. I also heard that strange noise which woke\nyourself and myself up one night, when it sounded like someone beating the\niron curtain-rod in your room with a broom-handle, and you said the noise\nwas dreadful, being so close to where you were.\nAccount sent to Miss S. by MRS. SEBPELL, of 152, King Street, Plymouth,\na former servant of Mrs. S.\nI will give an account of what I saw and heard in the house a t -\n88 near as I can. It was in the year 1885. I was stopping there for July and\nAugust, but I cannot tell which month or what day of the month it was as I\ntook no notice at the time. I only know that Miss S. and I had been\nDigitized by Google\n\f250 Journal of Society fOT Psychical Research. [April, 1888.\nsitting up rather late talking, and it must have been quite 12 o'clock when I\nwent to bed. How long I had been asleep I don't know, but the first thing\nI remember was someone leaning over me and talking very softly. She (for\nit was a woman's voice) seemed to be pleading with me to do something for\nher, but I was too sleepy to know what it was. Then she asked me to kiss\nher. I answered, then, \"No, I won't.\" She gave a sigh, then-such a\nsigh I shall never forget it. I was wide awake then, and sprang up in bed and\nlooked all round the room. I thought at first that some one had been playing\nme a trick, but I am quite sure no one went out of the room, for there was\nonly one door leading out of it, and that was facing the foot of the bed, and\nthe room was quite light. I never saw it, for when I looked up it was gone,\nnor did I have another visit from it while I was there. The next time I was\nthere, in February, 1886, I slept in the same room I had before, but the house\nhad been altered since I was there before, and this time there were two doors\nin my rOODl, one exactly facing the other. The one I locked when I went to\nbed, the other was only shut. I had been to sleep then, it seemed to me,\nsome time, when I woke with a start. I felt as if someone had given me a good\nshake. It frightened me so I sprang straight up in bed, and standing quite\nclose to me was-well, I don't know whatit was-but the moat horrible, devilish\nface. I could see nothing but the face and hands, which kept working as if\nthey were trying to get at me and something kept them back. I was so\nfrightened I did not dare to take my eyes off its face, and for a moment I did\nnot know what to do. Then the thought came into my mind to make tIie\nsign of the cross and say some prayers. That had the effect, it vanished in a\nsecond. Of course, the whole thing only lasted a moment, but it seemed\nages to me ; but the look of ba1H.ed rage I never shall forget. I did not go to\nsleep again that night. That is all I really saw or heard during my stay in\nthe house. But there are two things I never could understand, one was the dog:\nhe would stand and stare into a corner and shake all over, and once or twice\nI saw him go up the passage II.nd then run back again, jump on a chair, and\nshake all over, and look quite frightened. The other was, that whether you\nwere reading or working you must keep looking behind you as if you\nexpected to see some one standing there.\nMISS S. continues:-\nLOUD NOISES.\nJanuary 31st.-Last night I was awoke by feeling my room shake. I\nroused myself and heard someone walk across the room twice. I looked\nabout, but could not see anything; the steps seemed to be in the next room.\nI then listened and heard voices. At first I thought my mother must be ill,\nand it was one of the maids with her. I was going to get up and go in to her,\nwhen I heard someone crying. I then satisfied myself it was not my\nmother, but I thought it might be one of the ghosts. When I heard the\ntalking and walking about, and fancied something was the matter with my\nmother, it made me feel so ill that I could not go to sleep for some time; 80\nthere is not the least doubt but that I was wide awake; besides, when I went\ninro my mother's room, this morning, the first thing she asked me was if I had\nbeen disturbed, as she had been roused by hearing a loud crash, as if a sack\nDigitized by Google\n\fApril, 1888.J Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 251\nof coals were being emptied. She also told me that she had not been out of\nbed, nor had she spoken in the night.\nSome tune ago, about two years, I think, I was roused by a loud crash\noutside my door. A child was sleeping in a room over the drawing-room at\nthe time, and my idea was that she must have been walking in her sleep,\nand fallen downstairs. For a minute I was afraid to open my door for fear I\nshould find her lying there. As I came out of my room mother and Emilie\ncame out of theirs. All was quite quiet. We went upstairs and found\nWinnie sitting up in bed. What had startled us, I suppose, had startled her.\nOnce or twice in the daytime we have been disturbed by hearing a crash,\nas if something had been broken.\nLater, Ml88 S. adds :-\nConstantly the doors shHoke as if someone had struck against them, or as\nif something heavy had fallen in some part of the house. The piano is heard\nat times.\nFebrtw,ry 14th,I888.\nThe house is locked up for the night and Emilie is with my mother and\nme. We have just been startled by a loud noise. I was at first afraid to\ngo out of tho room for fear someone had got into the house, for it seemed\nas if someone had come in at the hall door and banged it. The room we are\nin was shaken when the noise came. There have been two more noises.\nMarch 28th, 1888.\nBoth last night and to-night, from eight to nine, I have been alone in\nthe house, the others being at church. There has been one noise after another.\nOnce or twice I thought someone had got into the house. To-night I was so\nfrightened I felt I must go out into the garden. Though I know there is some-\nthing supernatural about the place at the time, the noises are so like those\nmade by living people, I cannot bring myself to believe it is not a living\nperson making them. I am terrified of thieves breaking in. The ghosts\nmight make as much noise as they liked, if I were certain at the time it was\nonly the ghosts. Sometimes weeks and weeks have passed without one\nhaving noticed anything unusual.\nTHINGS LOST.\nLast Easter we were having some private theatricals. A great deal of the\nplay depended on a rinlt I had to wear. Between the acts I went up to make\nsome alteration in my dress. Miss Blencowe WRS with me. I took off the\nring and laid it down. At the end of a few minutes, when I wanted it, it\nwas gone. Miss Blencowe and I hunted high and low, but it could not be\nfound, and I was obliged to wear another. The next morning, the first\nthing, almost, that met my eyes was my ring lying on the dreasing-table. I\nhave IQst that ring again and again.\nThe Christmas before last I had some money sent me for the church. I\nput it in two-shilling pieces in my purse. When I went to get it, one of the\ntwo-shilling pieces was gone. Of course, I replaced it with another, and\nsent it away. I then put the empty purse back in my pocket. After that day,\nthe dreas, which was an old velvet, was put away. The next day I had a\nnew purse given to me, so forgot all about myoid one. When we were\ngoing to have the theatricals at Easter, it struck me the dreas might be made\nDigitized by Google\n\f..\n252 Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. rApril. 1888.\nof 118e. Before altering it, Emilie turned out the pocket and brought me my\nold purse. I opened it, to see if there were any papers inside it, and I found\na two-shi1lirur piece.\nJust before Christmas, this year, I have again lost a two-shilling piece,\neven more strangely. I had sent out for change for a sovereign. Both my\nmother and' I counted the change. I laid the purse on the table beside me;\nin the evening I missed the two-shilling piece. Once I had been out of the\nroom for a few minutes, but there was no one in the house to steal it. I have\nat other times lost two-shilling pieces, but I have found them again.\nI have lost several things at clliferent times, but they come back again.\nFebruary 13th, 1888.-A book my ,mother bought for a Christmas box\nwas lost on Christmas Eve, and since we h!l.ve hunted high and low for it.\nThis momipg Emilie went into one of the bedrooms. No one slecps there,\nbut we are constantly in and out as we keep a number of thiLgs in the room\nthat are in use. She found tho book lying on the bed. At present there is\nno one in tJle house but my mother, Emilie and myself, as our German maid\nhas left; she has been gone BOme days.\nTRB DOGS, &C.\nOur little Skye-terrier has run in from the passage, shivering\nallover, and the other day the other' little dog would not come\nthrough the green bedroom, though both doors were open; one of\nthe maids had to go up for him.-F.S. [See p. 245, bottom.]\nAccount from EMILIE THORNE.\nI was sitting working, one day; the dog was in a chair beside me; he\nsuddenly jumped off and began to howl. I took him out of the room, and,\nafter, he would not go back again, but remained shivering for BOme time. '\n..Q 315\nt\nWe have received the following case from the Oxford Phasmatological\nSociety.\n(1) MRS. ALDERSON's Account.\nMy BOn and I were staying in town, Bonchurch (Isle of Wight), last\nEastel' vacation (1886). Our lodgings were quite close to the sea, and the\ngarden of our hOI18e abutted on the beach, and there were no trees or bushes\nin it high enough to intercept our view. The evening of Easter Sunday waa\nBO fine that when Miss Jowett (the landlady's daughter) brought in the lamp,\n1 begged her not to pull down the blinds, and lay on the sofa looking out at\nthe sea, while my son was reading at the table. Owing to a letter I had just\nreceived from my sister at home, stating that one of the servants had again\nseen\" the old lady.\" my thoughts had been directed towards ghosts and such\nthings. But I was not a little astonished when, on presently looking out 0\nthe window, I saw the figure of a woman standing at the edge of the verandah.\nShe appeared to be a broad woman, and not tall (Mrs. A. is tall), and to wear\nan old\u00b7fashioned bonnet, and white gloves on her closed hands. As it was\ndark the figure was only outlined against the sky, and I could not distinguish\nany other details. It was, however, opaque, and notin any way transparent,\njust as if it had been a real peraon. [See Note 1 below.] I looked at it for\nDigitized by Google\n\fApril, 1888.] Journal of Society for P8ychical ReBp,o,rch. 253\nsome time, and then looked away. When, after a time, I looked again, the\nwoman's hands had disappeared behind what appeared to be a white marble\ncross, with a little bit of tho top broken oft', and with a railing on one side\nof the woman and the cross, such as one sometimes sees in graveyards.\nAfter looking at this apparition, which remained motionless, for some\ntime, about 20 minutes, perhaps, I asked my son [then an undergraduate at\nB.N.C.] to come and to look out of the window, and tell me what he saw.\nHe exclaimed, \" What an uncanny sight,\" and described the woman and\nthe cross exactly as I saw it. I then rang the bell, and when Miss J.\nanswered it, I asked her also to look out of the window and tell me\nwhat she saw, and she also described the woman and the cross, just as they\nappeared to my son and myself. Some one suggested that it might be a re-\nllection of some sort, and we all looked about the room to see whether there\nwas anything in it that could cause such a rellection, but came to the conclu-\nsion that there was nothing to account for it. My son then went through the\nopen side of the (low) window (we had seen the figure through the closed\nside [see Note 2]) only a few feet distant from the figure, to see whether it was\npossible for a real woman to be thdra, but found nothing. My impression is,\nthat to us also the figure disappeared when my son went out, but as I was\nspeaking to Miss J. at the time, I cannot be quite certain about this. Yet\nwhen he returned into the room the woman and the cross still appeared in\nthe same place. We still continued to discuss what it could be, Miss J.\nhaving a strong idea that it portended death or misfortune to some one, and\nbeing very anxious that the apparition should not be in any way connected\nwith herself and herfamily ; and when we looked again all had disappeared.\nAltogether, from the time when I first saw it, the figure must have lasted for\nnearly an hour, from about 9 to 10 p.m., and nothing has occurred since\nthat would throw any light upon the appearance. I have never had any\nsimilar experience. [See Note 3.]\n(Signed) JANE S. ALDERSON.\nThe following notes are from Mr. Schiller, the member of the Oxford\nSociety, who procured this case for us:-\nNote I.-Mrs. A. never from the first thought that the figure was that\nof a real woman.\nNote 2.-0wing to the locality, it could not have been soen through the\nopen window. .\nNote 3.-With the exception of hearing heavy footsteps and an aUempt to\nring the bell at home (about 1881). If this was an auditory_hallucination, it\nwas, however, to all appearance shared by the dog.\nThe following is Miss J.'s account (in answer to a letter fronl Mrs.\nAlderson, written at Mr. r:;chiller's suggestion) :-\nThe Baltic, Bonchurch.\nMarek 11th, 1887.\nI remember, distinctly, the visiou of a woman in black, kneeling before\na white croBB, with her hands before her face, as if weeping, with a bonnet on\nher head. I do not think there could have been anything in the room to\ncause the reflection. If you remember, at the time we looked well about the\nDigitized by Google\n\f254 Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. [April, 1888.\nroom to see if there was anything that would have caused it. We have none\nof us ever seen the same thing since-indeed, it had quite gone from my\nmemory until your letter recalled it, and now it seems as distinct to me as if\nI had only seen it an hour ago. (Signed) S. JOWETT.\nI first heard the story from Mrs. A., on 7th March, 1887, and made a\nnote of it in my diary. It was read before the Phasmatological Society\nnext term, and questions were asked. The foregoing account is an exa.ct\ncopy of an account compiled by me from Mrs. A.'s first account, heranswers\nto the questions, and various oral remarlu, and was signeci by her as correct.\nI have \"lao seen the originals of Mrs. A.'s letter to Miss J., and her answer.\nMrs.A. impressed me as highly intelligent and sensible about these\nmatters. C. SCHILLER, B.A.,\nHon. Member of the Phasmatological Society.\nMR. ALDERSON'S AQCount.\nStaying at B. (Isle of Wight) during the Easter vaca.tion of 1886, I\nremember distinctly seeing an apparition in the form of a woman with her\nhands clasped on the top of a cross. The cross looked old and worn, as one\nsees in churchyards. My mother drew my attention to the figure, and after\nwe had watched it for some time we rang t.he bell and asked the servant if\nshe saw the figure. She said she did. I then went out on to the verandah\n(where the figure was), and immediately it vanished.-E. H. ALDERSON.\nIn answer to M.r. Schiller's questions, Mr. A. wishes to state :-\n(1) That he did not notice when the figure vanished.\n(2) That he did traverse where the figure apparently was, but saw\nnothiBg; those inside the room still seeing the figure.\nL 322\n-t-\nFrom CAPTAIN R. E. W. CAMPBELL (2nd Royal_Irish FUlliliers),\nArmy and Navy Club, Pall Mall, S.W.\n.February 21st, 1888.\nDEAR Sm,-I have much pleasure in enclosing you an account of a\nremarkable dream which occurred to me in the year 1886, together with\nthree other accounts of the same, written by officers to whom the facts of the\ncase are known. You are at liberty, in the interests of science, to make\nsuch use of them as you please.-I remain, yours faithfully,\nR. E. W. CAMPBELL,\nCaptain 2nd Royal Irish Fusiliers.\nFebruary 21st, 1888.\nI was stationed at thE' DepOt Barracks, Armagh, IreL.nd, on the 30th\nNovember, 1886, and on the night of the same date, or early in the morning\nof the 1st December (I cannot tell which, 81 I did not refer to my watch), I\nwas in bed in my room, 'when I was awakened by a most vivid and remark-\nable dream or vision, in which I seemed to see a certain Major Hubbersty,\nlate of my regiment, the 2nd BattalionRoyal Irish Fusiliers, lookiug ghastly\npale, and falling forward as if dying. He seemed to be saying something to\nme, but the words I could not make out although I tried hard to understand\nDigitized by Google\n\fApril, 1888.] JO'Urnal Of Society for Psychical Re8earch. 255\nhim. The clothes he had on at the time appeared to me to, have a thin red\nthread running through the pattern. J was very deeply impressed by my\ndream, and so much did I feel that there was something significant in it that\non the 1st December, when at luncheon, in the mess, I related it to three\nbrother officers, telling them at the same time that I felt sure we should soon\nhear something bad a.bout Major Hubbersty. I hadalm08t forgottenallabout\nit, when, on taking up the Times newspaper of the following Saturday on\nthe Sunday morning following, the first th~ng that caught my eyes was the\nannouncement of Major Hubbersty's death at Penzance, in Cornwall, on the\n30th November, the very date on which I had the remarkable dream concerning\nhim.\nMy feelings on seeing such a remarkable fulfilment of my dream can\nbe better imagined than described. Suffice it to say that on their return from\nchurch of Messrs. Kaytl and Scott I asked them to try and recollect anything\npeculiar which had happened at luncheon on the 1st December, when after a\nfew moments' deliberation, they at once recounted to me the whole circum-\nstancea of my dream, as they had heam them fl'C,lm my lips on the 1st\nDecember, 1886. On seeing Mr. Leeper a few days afterwards at his father's\nhouse, Loughgall, Co. Arma17h, he at Ol1ce remembered 811 I had told him\nabout the dream on the let December, on my questioning him about it.\nI, of course, can assign no possible cause for the remarkable facts related, as\napart from the difference of our standing in the service, the late Major\nHubbersty and I were in no wise particularly friendly to one another, nor\nhad. we seen very much of each other. I had not seen him for 18 months\npreviously\u2022. A very curious fact in connection with the dream is that it\noccurred to me in the very same room in the barracks as Major Hubbersty\nused to occupy when stationed at Armagh, several years previously.\n&. E. W. CAMPBELL.\nThree friends of Captain Campbell supply the following cOl'Toboration .-\nRavensdale Parsonage, Co. Louth, Ireland.\nOn the 1st of December, 1886, J was at lunch in the mess-room, Armagh\nBarracks, with Mr. Campbell and Mr. Leeper, of the 2nd Battalion Royal\nIrish Fusiliers, and Mr. Kaye, of the 3rd Battalion of the 81.me regiment.\nWe were talking about various things, when Mr. Campbell remarked that he\nhad a very strange vision of a Major Hubbersty, who used to be in his\nregiment. He thought he saw him on the night before, or early on the\nmorning of that day, standing in his room, looking very pale and ghastly,\nand that he seemed to fall lorward. He also described the clothes worn by\nthe vision. As well as J remember, he said they were a sort of spotted cloth,\nwith a red thread running through it. He then said he felt sure w~ should\nhear something about him very soon. On the following Sunday, when I\nreturned from church with Mr. Kaye, we found Mr. Campbell in the ante-\nroom, and he read to us out of the Times newspaper the death of Major\nHubbersty, late 2nd Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers, the same man that had\nappeared to him in a vision a few nights before.\nT.

[April, 1888.\nThe Barracks, Armagh.\nDecember 13th, 1887.\nMr. Campbell has asked mb to write my recollections of an extraordinary\ndream he told me of last winter. I remember distinctly being at lunch with\nhim here on the 1st December, and in talking of several things in connection\nwith the regiment. Major Hubberaty's name was mentioned, when Mr.\nCampbell told me that he had had a moat extraordinary dream about\nHubberaty the night before, that he had seen him looking very pale and ill,\nand the dream had evidently made a very strong impression on Mr. Campbell\nas he told me he felt sure we would BOon hear of poor Hubberaty's death or\nsome other misfortune happening to him.\nI did not see Mr. Campbell till three days afterwards, when he came out\nto dine at my father's house at Loughga.ll, and had forgotten a.ll about his\ndream, when, to my astonishment, he told me that since he had seen me last\nhe had heard of Major Hubberaty's death, and that it had occurred on the\nvery day that he had the dream he told me or, and it greatly surprised me as\nit seemed just like the fulfihnent of a prediction.\nR.

During our conversation Major Hubberaty's name was mentioned,\nand Campbell told us that he had & dream about him the night before, howhe\nhad seen a vision ofMajor Hubberaty looking very pale and seeming to be fa.ll-\ning forward, and sa.ying something to him which he could not hear; alao, he\n(Campbell) told us he was sure -we would hear something about Major\nHubberaty very BOOn.\nOn the following Sunday, when Scott and I returned from church and\nwent into the ante-room, Campbell, who was there, asked us both to try and\nremember anything peculiar that he had told us on the 1st. After a little time,\nwe remembered about the dream, and he (Campbell) then showed us the\nTimea newspaper of the day before, containing the notice of Major\nHubberaty's death, at Penzance, on November 30th, 1886, the sa.we date &8\nthat on which he had the dream; also, I remember, he (Campbell) told us\nthat in his vision he seemed to see the clothes which Major Hubberaty had\non, and that there was a red thread running through the pattern of the\ntrousers.\nA.
