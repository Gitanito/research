B. Rhine\nABSTRACT: ESP is generally considered to consist of telepathy and clair-\nvoyance, either of which may be precognitive. ESP and precognition are re-\ngarded as established capacities. But it is submitted here that we have no\nclear proof that a truly telepathic form of ESP ever occurs. It is even hard to\ndesign a sure test for true telepathy. Precognitive clairvoyance can account\nfor all the \" evidence \" on record for telepathy. On the other hand, there is\nevidence of true clairvoyance that cannot be explained byprecognitive telepathy,\nand there are methods available for testing true clairvoyance further. These\nconsiderations have far-reaching significance, even on the survival hypothesis.\nThey do not in any way alter the case for ESP, but they zvill have much to do\nmth its explanation. \u2014Ed. Jour. Parapsychol.\nWhen a subject succeeds to a significant degree in identifying objects,\nsuch as the cards in a shuffled deck, by some extra-sensorial means, we\ncommonly call the performance clairvoyance, or the extra-sensory percep-\ntion of objects. If there is similar success in identifying the order of sym-\nbols being thought of by a sender, but with no objective target such as a\ncard, we speak of telepathy. If both the card and the sender's thought are\npossible targets for the subject's extra-sensory perception, the test is one of\nundifferentiated or general extra- sensory perception (GESP).\nBut there has long been a fairly common question asked concerning\nclairvoyance : Do we need the hypothesis of clairvoyance to account for\nthe results of clairvoyance tests? Can we not suppose that telepathy\njxplains the results even when there is no sender looking at the cards,\nsince the experimenter zvill look at them at the time of checking up.? In\nv'levi of the considerable evidence of precognition now published, it has\naecome all the easier to suppose that precognitive telepathy can explain\n:he card-calling test results commonly ascribed to clairvoyance.\nAs a matter of fact, we can easily turn the tables by asking whether we\nleed the hypothesis of telepathy to account for the results of telepathy\n:ests\u2014whether the evidence for that phenomenon cannot be equally well\niccounted for by precognitive clairvoyance. Is it not possible that the\n^By kind permission of Dr J. B. Rhine we are reprinting with considerable\nibbreviations an article which appeared originally in the Journal of Parapsychology\nor September 1944, together with comments by several of our members and a\nlumming-up of the discussion by Professor C. D. Broad. Hon. Ed.\n\f\\ .\n2 \\ J- B. Rhine [Part\nsubject simply goes ahead in time by clairvoyance to the point when the'\nsender records what he has just been thinking? Thus he would not need\nto use telepathy at all but would rely on clairvoyance-plus-precognition. !\n[Rhine goes on to say that, in his experience, most people have a distinct'\nbias towards telepathy as against clairvoyance, which he thinks is because\nit is easier to draw an analogy between telepathy and physical effects such\nas radio and the electrical vibrations from the brain.]\nYet in plain truth we must all concede at the outset that we have no\nscientific justification for any bias one way or the other. We are as\nignorant of hozv to explain telepathy as we are of how to explain clairvoyance\n\u2014no more and no less\u2014and we cannot compare two \" ignorances.\"\nRequirements for Proof of Telepathy\nTo show evidence of telepathy (and exclude clairvoyance) a subject\nwould have to do significant scoring in tests in which he tried to identify\nthe thoughts of a sender extra-sensorially when those thoughts had no\nobjective record anywhere at any time. The sender could not even write\ndown his thought later, for then it would be available to precognitive clair-\nvoyance. All the sender could do within the limits allowed him would be\nto count mere hits and misses as such without any record being made of\nthe symbols or target objects of which he was thinking.\nThus the entire accuracy of the true telepathy test depends upon the\nunrecorded personal judgments of the sender, and the room for error is\naccordingly greater than most critical readers will tolerate. It is true that\nthe danger of error can be somewhat reduced by the use of a code, known\nonly to the sender, and of some device, such as a list of random numbers\nto determine the selection of the target or symbol to be \" sent \". But this\nwould call for an objective expression, either orally or in writing, of the\ncode to be used by the sender, which would violate the conditions required\nfor pure telepathy.\nIt seems very doubtful if any test for pure telepathy has ever been con\nducted. There were a number of \" pure telepathy \" experiments conducted\nat this laboratory in the early 'thirties in which the sender recorded his\nthoughts (one of five symbols) only after the time had passed for the subject\nto record his call. But in our more critical frame of mind to-day, we see\nclearly that precognitive clairvoyance was a distinct possibility in that par-\nticular test situation and that our term \" pure telepathy \" was little more\nthan a mark of the degree to which we were influenced by existing concepts.\nSoal and Goldney (5), reached the conclusion that precognitive telepathy\nwas demonstrated. They believe that clairvoyance was ruled out by the\nfact that the subject did not score significantly when the sender did not\nlook at the symbols during the run, and by the further fact that only certain\npersons could successfully act as senders. These facts may be regarded as\nsuggestive in their bearing; but obviously they cannot be taken as conclu-\nsive, since we know now that the subject's attitude or belief is a very great\nfactor in determining success and failure. The recent report of Schmeidler\n(4) gives fresh evidence that this is true. The mere fact that their subject\nbelieved his ability was telepathy could have inhibited his success (which\nmight well have been due to precognitive clairvoyance) whenever the con-\nditions did not conform to his beliefs or preferences. It is true that he\n\f172] Telepathy and Clairvoyance Reconsidered 3\nfailed in clairvoyance tests and succeeded in tests allowing for telepathy\nwith a successful sender, even when he was not told which of the two con-\nditions would be imposed at a particular time. But if ESP is a part of his\nequipment, it cannot safely be concluded that the subject was wholly\nignorant as to which of these two alternating conditions prevailed. That\nwould be to ignore the principle we are testing.\nIn the light of the present reshuffle of values, there is a temptation to\nturn for evidence of telepathy to the reports of spontaneous parapsychical\nexperiences\u2014for example, instances of similar dreams. But this evidence\ncould hardly be conclusive since the experience is necessarily objectified\nin the telling and precognitive clairvoyance (or clairaudience) is a possi-\nbility in all such cases.\nOne thing is clear : If we are to bring the telepathy hypothesis to crucial\ntest, new experiments will have to be designed and conducted. Until then\ntelepathy can be regarded only as an unestablished hypothesis having some\nfavouring evidence, none of which is conclusive.\nRequirements for Proof of Clairvoyance\nSomething of a contrast is presented by the analysis of the case for clair-\nvoyance. The requirements for such a test can be put very simply : If a\nsubject significantly identifies cards extra-sensorially when no one knows\nthe order at the time the test is made and no record of that order is taken,\nthen no opportunity is provided for precognitive telepathy, and the test is\none of true clairvoyance.\nThe first point to make is that our earlier tests were \" purer \" than we\nrealised when they were being conducted. While no thought was being\ngiven to precognitive telepathy at the time, and we were alert only to the\nexclusion of telepathy of the present, some of the conditions approximated\nthe requirements. The various card-matching techniques probably fall\nwithin the limits of acceptable clairvoyance tests, and there was a great\ndeal of this matching work done. [Here Rhine describes, inter alia, the\nScreened-Touch-Matching experiments of Pratt and Woodruff {2). These\nwere on the same lines as the Chutes series described next.]\nThe matching test which was probably most conclusive in its bearing\non the clairvoyance hypothesis is the Chutes Series of Humphrey and\nPratt (i). In this work the subject dropped cards, each enclosed in a\n\u00ab sealed, opaque envelope, down appropriate chutes instead of piling them\nup opposite the key cards. As the envelopes dropped into the compart-\nments in the next room, they were invisible to the subject and unobserved\nby the experimenters, who were occupied. The cards did not fall in orderly\npiles, and their sequence was often not preserved. The experimenters made\nno effort to keep the cards in the order in which they fell; they merely sorted\nas\n3ut the hits, counted them, and dropped all the cards back in the compart-\nment. Thus the memory-plus-precognitive-telepathy hypothesis hardly\nseems applicable here, although there is perhaps still a technical possibility.\nA second type of evidence of clairvoyance may be found in the significant\n;ct|\nresults of the ESP-shuffle experiments (3). \"in these tests the subject\nck shuffled a deck of cards a given number of times (or a given number of\nn- seconds), aiming to make it match as fully as possible another similar deck\n>r a list of symbols concealed from the subject's view. The important\n\f4 ' J.B. Rhine [Part\noperation was the shufRe (actually the last shuffle since that usually changes\nthe entire order) and, of course, the ESP capacity guiding it. In placing a\nbatch of cards in a certain position the subject was \" calling \" them to\nmatch the cards in the corresponding positions in the other deck. To\nplace them intelligently (as against chance) requires some kind and degree\nof knowledge of present arrangement before the shuffle is made. But this\nknowledge cannot be drawn from the subsequent check-up by precogni-\ntion-plus-telepathy because once the shuffle is made the present order of\nthe cards is destroyed and they will not then be in that order when the check-up\nis made. Thus it is not possible to explain the ESP-shuffle results as due\nto the subjects precognitive telepathy of the experimenter's thoughts as\nhe records the shuffled deck.\n[This argument is expanded in the original paper.]\nBut even if we assume precognitive telepathy of the hidden deck and\nassume that the subject gets a glimpse of a card (or several cards, altogether,\nin the various shuffles) as he handles the deck he is shuffling, we have to\ngo on to explain how he can place the card accurately in the right position\nby shuffling. He is merely taking an ESP test, unconcerned as to whether\nit is clairvoyance or telepathy. We can hardly suppose that without clair-\nvoyance of the deck he holds he would know where and how to place the\ncard which we assume he saw ^o as to match the one which we assume he\nperceived by precognitive telepathy.\nThus while the ESP-shuffle experiment does not offer an undebatable\ncase for true clairvoyance, it does, to my judgment at least, represent a\nhighly plausible one. With the addition of screening of the deck that is\nbeing shuffled from all possible sensory cues, this research method would\nbe quite satisfactory.\nTyrrell's electrically operated ESP test machine (6) appears to meet the\nrequirements for a pure clairvoyance test. His machine has five small\nboxes, any one of which may be lit by a small electric bulb. The box to\nbe lit is selected by a complex mechanical device. The subject is instructed\nto choose one of the five boxes, trying to hit the lighted one. If he does, a\nhit is automatically recorded. In any case a record of the trial is automati-\ncally made. Now if there is only the record of trials and hits without a\nrecord of which box is selected, there is no future observation by anyone to\nwhich the subject may go forward precognitively for information as to\nwhich box to open. Precognitive telepathy is thus not a possibility. The\nsubject himself, when he opens one of the boxes as his way of indicating\nhis choice, sees the light at once if he is right, and thus knows which box\nwas the target for that trial. And if he is wrong, he discovers that fact too.\nBut since he has first to make his choice before he could possibly predict its\noutcome, the knowledge of the success or failure of the choice could not\nguide the choice\u2014that is, as far as can be seen on the basis of present\nknowledge. Tyrrell's significant results, then, reported for these conditions\nmay be safely regarded as evidence of true clairvoyance.\nOther and even simpler machines for testing clairvoyance are now either\nunder construction or have been recently brought into use here and in\nEngland (7). These types of apparatus allow the subject to try to identify\na coloured disc or marble by pressing a lever and dropping the marble into\na compartment which automatically registers the subject's impression as\n\f172] Telepathy and Clairvoyance Reconsidered 5\n^ to the colour. In the end, the check-up is made by counting the number\n'\nof objects of the right colour in the five compartments. The order is lost\ntrack of completely, provided the machine is closed in and the marbles are\n\" invisible until the time of checking up, and hence any kind of precognition\n* or precognitive telepathy is excluded.\nCuriously enough, by far the most extensive (if somewhat indirect)\nevidence of true clairvoyance\u2014evidence in which there is no suggestion of\n'\/ telepathy or precognitive telepathy\u2014comes from, the researches on PK,\nor the psychokinetic effect. In the PK tests thus far reported, a subject has\n\" endeavoured to influence the falling of dice by direct mental action,\nwilling a specified face or combination of faces to turn up.\nNo one as yet pretends to understand the working of the PK effect, but\nas soon as one becomes aware of the occurrence of this phenomenon, one\n^ thing is fairly obvious to him : In order to succeed, the PK process has to\n^1\nbe guided by some orienting, directing influence\u2014some cognition of the point\n\" in the space-time continuum at which the die is located at a given instant,\n\" some way of knowing v\/hich face is up, and other details. Knowledge of\nthe rolling die seems absolutely necessary to allow purposive action upon\n'\nit. Now this knowledge has to be gained extra-sensorially because visual\n* perception is much too slow to follow dice which are rolling and bounding\nagainst padded tables or down through w^ire cages. With larger numbers\nof dice\u2014published experiments report up to 24, 60, and 96 per throw\n\u2014\nthe inadequacy of sensory perception is still more apparent. And the type\n' of ESP that is required here is pure clairvoyance ;\nprecognitive telepathy\n'5\ncould not fill the need.\n^ Thus the case for clairvoyance is found to have a firm foundation in the\nPK work, and what is probably a firm one in the matching studies and the\n\" ESP-shuffle experiments. The total evidence is sufficient to raise clair-\n\" voyance out of the realm of unestablished hypotheses where we must, for\n^\nthe present at least, leave telepathy.\nJ\nGeneral Bearing of the Conclusions\n' One thing should be made plain to everyone : The total effective evidence\n\" for ESP is not affected by this discussion. The issue is entirely an internal\n\" affair. [Here Rhine discusses the significance to parapsychology of his\n\" re-appraisal of telepathy and clairvoyance, and refers again to the general\n'6\ndifficulty in the acceptance of clai'rvoyance as compared to telepathy.]\nI?\nWhat specific difference does it make whether ESP is all clairvoyance,\nall telepathy, or partly both.? What real change in the interpretation and\nbearing of ESP does the shift of telepathy from a preferred to a lower and\ndoubtful status make Wherein does it matter that we shall now have to\ntake clairvoyance with full seriousness and, at least for the present, con-\nit\nsider it as the one form of ESP fully established\n'S\nThe most immediate consequence is that we must face in earnest the\nfact \\hzt psychophysical interaction ofperceptual character may occur without\nthe known intermediating organs of the senses. This joint function between\nJi\nmental and material systems resulting in cognition may no longer be\ny dodged by speculative recourse to the telepathy interpretation. This\n\" relation is the counterpart of the interaction between the psychical and\n^ physical involved in the PK effect.\n\f6 J. B. Rhine [Part 1\/\nThe drastic shifts in point of view which are called for in this reconsider- .\nas\nation of the facts about telepathy and clairvoyance induce another sobering If,\nthought : May there not be other claims of parapsychical abilities that aW\nneed to be given the same kind of re-appraisal ? What other concepts, '\nn\nsimilar to telepathy and clairvoyance, are we using in ways which cannot iai\nbe justified when we subject them to critical analysis ? Already in the o\ncourse of the discussion of telepathy and clairvoyance the concept of pre-\ncognition has met with some new problems.\nThe Hypotheses of Telepathy and Survival\nThe telepathy hypothesis has been regarded as one of the main counter- pla\nhypotheses to that of survival in explaining the mediumistic utterances k\nthat have been among the primary data bearing on the issue of personal i eve\nsurvival.\nFor the present it would be wishful thinking to apply the telepathy ,\nhypothesis as a counter-argument against the survival hypothesis while\n''\nthere is no clear evidential case for the occurrence of telepathy. Only if\ntelepathy is reliably known to function as a human ability can we properly\n^'\nsuppose the medium is using such a parapsychical capacity in acquiring her\nknozvledge. In many instances it may make little real difference about 3'\ntelepathy if the medium is to be credited with unlimited clairvoyance\n(including precognitive clairvoyance), but it would be logically possible to\nhave cases occurring in mediumistic practice in which only telepathy \"t'\ncould serve as an alternative to survival (for example, cases in which only\nthe sitters' notation of \" right \" or \" wrong \", entered on a stenographic 5'\nrecord, registers the fact that the mediumistic utterances seem to reflect\nthoughts which could have originated only with the sitter or the purported\ncommunicator). There can be no objective confirmation for such in-\nstances, but at least there can be unlimited multiplication of instances.\nAnother close association between the telepathy and the survival\nhypotheses is indicated in the familiar suggestion that if there is spirit\ncommunication it is telepathy between the living and the dead. The sup-\nposition is that the medium acquires her \" messages \" through telepathy!\nwith the minds of the deceased personalities purporting to communicate, i\nIn related fashion the hypothesis is extended to cover the explanation ofr.\ncommunication between spirit personalities. According to the speculation |\nof the spiritist, thought-transference from mind to mind is not possible\non a sensory, mechanical basis since the spirits are incorporeal. Tele-\npathy is the only means of inter-communication possible. According to\nthis line of thought, then, telepathy is essential, not only to the communi- \\\ncation of the spirits with the living, but to their intercommunication among\nthemselves. In this suppositional instance precognitive clairvoyance could\nnot substitute in any way for the role attributed to telepathy. The question-\nof the occurrence of telepathy thus becomes of very great importance to the ;\ninvestigation of the spirit hypothesis. ;\nProspect for Telepathy Research\nIf these reflections on telepathy are sound, we may perhaps rightly hope\nfor a strongly renewed interest in telepathy research. One of the goals\nwould be to settle once and for all the status of the telepathic hypothesis\n\f172] Telepathy and Clairvoyance Reconsidered 7\nas a coiinterhypothesis in the investigation of the question of survival.\nIf, as so many people have long believed, telepathy does occur, it is reason-\nable to hope it will meet the new experimental demands that have to be\nmade and will eventually be firmly estabhshed. As a matter of fact, I\nhave a degree of the same personal bias toward telepathy that most students\n'of parapsychology seem to have. But the situation must be franklv faced :\nthere is at the mom.ent no adequately reliable case for telepathy. If a\ncorrect approach is made to the problem, and if telepathy occurs, the evi-\ndence will presumably come in time. If it does not, new insights and\nadjustments will be in order. Whatever is disco^-ered, it will help to ex-\nplain the nature of ESP, and its discovery will almost certainly improve\nthe reach of the human mind in its effort at self-understanding and the\neventual control of its world.\nReferences\nHumphrey, B.

Whately Carington\nWith Dr Rhine's general approach I could hardly be more heartily in\naccord. Nothing is more salutary than radically to challenge views that\nare usually taken for granted ; and valuable results may often be obtained\nby seeing what happens when we turn them inside out. In particular, few\nthings would please me more than to be forced to the conclusion that it is\ninherently impossible to distinguish experimentally between the so-called\n\" telepathic \" and \" clairvoyant \" explanations of paracognitive pheno-\nmena. We should then have to admit that the alleged distinction is strictly\nmeaningless, and that the supposed alternative hypotheses were no more\nthan alternative linguistic ways of describing the same events. If we were\nthen to cast out, as necessarily meaningless, the terms on which the\napparent distinction depends, we should, I think, find that we had made\nan important step forward in our understanding of the relation between\nwhat we call \" mind \" and what we call \" matter \".\nAs I shall explain below, 1 fancy that something very like this conclusion\nwill, in fact, be forced upon us, though the argument will not follow pre-\ncisely the course just indicated, or the line taken by Dr Rhine.\nMy immediate reaction to t'ne content of Dr Rhine's remarks was one of\nstrong dissent ; but I suspect that this was mainly a matter of prejudice,\ndue to my having thought so long about, and in terms of, telepathy and to\nhaving (as I believe) produced a not implausible theory of its mechanism.\nI now think that 1 was probably wrong in this, and am provisionally pre-\npared to go even further in certain directions than Dr Rhine does, though\nI cannot assent to his basic view (as I understand it) that clairvoyance is a\nprocess radically different from telepathy and alternative to it.\nIt seems fairly clear to me that, once we concede the claims of clair-\nvoyance as ordinarily understood, we can never formally demonstrate\n\" pure \" telepathy, though the difficulties are not, I think, quite those\nenvisaged by Dr Rhine. I see no sort of objection in principle, though\nthere would be a few technical problems to be solved in practice, to the\ntype of experiment he mentions, in which the experimenter merely images\nor \" thinks of \" a succession of card symbols, say, and records no more\nthan whether the subject's guess was right or wrong. It is true that we\nshould have to rely exclusively on the experimenter's statements, but I do\nnot think that any one who is prepared to accept paranormal cognition in\nany form would cavil seriously over this.\nThe trouble is rather that the proponents of clairvoyance would be, so\nfar as I can see, perfectly entitled to claim that any process of imaging,\netc., by the agent is bound to be accompanied by corresponding and pre-\nsumably characteristic changes in the brain, or perhaps by innervations\nof speech mechanisms, eye movements, etc., of subliminal intensity, and\nthat these may be clairvoyantly cognised. Against this line of argument no\nexperiment that could possibly be conducted by incarnate man could be\nS\n\f[Part 172] Comments on Dr Rhine's \" Telepathy \", etc. 9\nproof. I agree that such an hypothesis would be extremely far-fetched,\nnot to say fantastic, and I do not believe a word of it ; but it does not seem\nto me more fantastic than the kind of thing we are implicitly asked to\naccept in connection with clairvoyance of more ordinary type, assuming\nthat the evidence is strong enough (as it probably is) to warrant us accept-\ning this at all.\nIn the \" chutes \" experiment, for example, and mutatis mutandis for\nothers, we are required to believe that the subject identifies a black symbol\non a white card when that card is in the dark. But to say \" such and such\na card, now in the dark, is now white \" is absurd, because \" white \" can\nonly mean \" reflecting light of all frequencies \", whereas ex hypothesi\nthere is no light to reflect. And the same, of course, for coloured counters,\netc.\nThe clairvoyantist must therefore fall back on some story to the effect\nthat it is the \" inner nature \" of the pigment or the like that is cognised.\nBut the words \" inner nature \", if held to refer to something that is\nessentially unobservable, yet in some way responsible for the observable\nproperties of an object, etc., means exactly nothing at all ; for no con-\nceivable process can distinguish between the hypothesis that an object\nconsists of properties plus an inner nature, and the hypothesis that it con-\nsists only of properties.\nSo far as this is concerned, I should, and do, remain an unrepentant\ntelepathist, on the ground that although I cannot devise an experiment\nformally to exclude the clairvoyant alternative, I am not called upon to\nexclude alternatives that mean nothing.\nBut although I should like to see much more and more direct evidence\nin favour of pure clairvoyance than has yet been adduced\u2014in particular\nstrong positive results from Mr Parsons' machine or some close equivalent\n\u2014I think we must even now cater for the probability of its being ^ fact in\nnature. But in doing so we must strenuously refuse to fob ourselves off\nwith pseudo-explanations based on the use of such logically meaningless\nterms as \" inner nature \", \" essential quiddity \" or the like.\nThe only way out of the tangle that I can see is to say firmly that a thing\nis the totality of the observations that can be made upon it, and nothing\nmore ; more accurately, perhaps, that it is a certain sequential pattern of\nsensa (or sense-data, sensibilia, cognita, or like terms). This does away\nwith all meaningless non-sense about \" direct awareness of its inner\nnature \", but it involves divesting our irreducible \" sensa \" of any ex-\nclusively sensational (physiologically speaking) connotations.\nIt also inwlves the more revolutionary notion that a red sensum, say,\n(I should prefer to call it simply a cognisable), exists even when, as we\nwould ordinarily put it, the object to which it belongs is in the dark ; but\nthis appears much less objectionable than at first sight when we reflect that\nwe can easily enough retain or recall a red image when the so-called\n\" object \" is darkened.\nThe real key to the difficulty seems to me to lie in the meaning to be\nattached to the word \" exists \". So far as I can see no meaning whatever\ncan be assigned to the proposition \" X exists now, although no-one is\ncognising it (or can observe it) \" except by making it identically equivalent\nto the proposition \" X will be cognised (or observed) under such and such\n\flo W.

The notion that the continued existence of X, not at the\nmoment cognised, impHes that X is lurliing somewhere behind the scenes\nwaiting to take its cue and come on the stage again, is natural enough, hut\nnon-sensical, because it could only be verified by observing {i.e., cognising)\nX in its hiding place.\nTo bring telepathy and clairvoyance into line, then, I think that we must\nfirst eject with ineluctable finality our old but tiresome friend the thing-\nin-itself, Ding-an-sich (or Ding, as we might call it for short). We must say\nthat what we commonly call a material object is no more and no less than a\ncertain sequentially patterned aggregate of cognisables, the individual\nexistences of which do not depend on their being actually arranged in that\npattern at any particular moment (or something very like this\u2014no doubt\nthe wording could be improved). Various circumstances may lead (I\nspeak somewhat colloquially) to their being brought into certain relations\nwith other groups of cognisables forming what would usually be called\nmental contents or the like (but, according to me, just minds or sub-\nsystems thereof), and they are then said to be cognised by those minds.\nThey are then, of course, if not before, subject to associative processes,\netc. If the cognitive relation is brought about by associative mechanisms\ninvolving another mind or minds, we call it telepathy ; if it is direct, and\ndoes not involve anything that would ordinarily be called another mind,\nthen we call it clairvoyance.\nThus it would be fundamentally waste of time, I submit, to wrangle\nwhether telepathy is explicable in terms of clairvoyance, or clairvoyance\nin terms of telepathy. Such disputations can arise only from the tacit or\nexplicit postulation of logical monstrosities such as Egos and Dings. I\nthink that if we stick resolutely to what alone we know, namely ordered\nsequences of cognised cognisables, if I may so put it, we shall find that\ntelepathy and clairvoyance are not mutually exclusive alternatives, or even\nrival hypotheses, but only closely related varieties of the same fundamental\nprocess.\nI need hardly say that the foregoing remarks are to be taken as highly\ntentative ;\nbut I feel it would be a pity to squander our energies on un-\nprofitable controversy, and I believe that what I have said indicates ap-\nproximately the lines along which we may most advantageously try to\ndevelop our thinking on these topics.\nTHE LOCUS STANDI OF TELEPATHY\nH. By J. Hettinger\nHaving no personal experience of the various methods used in the card-\nguessing and dice-rolling experiments, I lack the necessary background for\nexpressing an opinion as to whether the conditions of clairvoyance or of\ntelepathy were present in the specific series carried out by Dr Rhine and\nothers. For the same reason, 1 am unable to pass any comments on the\nissue : precognitive clairvoyance versus precognitive telepathy. However,\n\f172] Comments on Dr. Rhine's \" Telepathy \", etc. 11\nin view of Dr Rhine's reconsidered opinion, that clairvoyance is now an\n\" estabhshed \" and telepathy still an \" unestablished \" hypothesis, I feel\nthat the assertion ought not to be left unchallenged.\nPsychic experiences often referred to as \" clairvoyant \" and \" telepathic\"\nhave been known long before the present experimental stage. Many of\nthem have been carefully investigated by the S.P.R. and the American\nS.P.R., and they carry a certain amount of conviction, which, in my\nopinion, compares favourably with the conviction which the significant\nresults of statistical tests are supposed to lead to. Although I mj^self am a\nprotagonist of statistics whenever they can be easily applied and readily\nunderstood by others, I feel certain that an abundant collection of striking\nexperiences and striking results of qualitative experiments tends to carry\ngreater conviction than the results of mathematical calculations. I am\nmentioning this, because of Dr Rhine's statement :\n\" To show evidence of\ntelepathy (and exclude clairvoyance) a subject would have to do significant\nscoring . .\n.\". Significant scoring is not the only evidence in science ;\nmoreover, based, as it is, on \" hits \" and \" misses \", it does not diff'er-\nentiate among the individual successes, which of them are due to chance\ncoincidence and which to a transcendental faculty.\nAs I assume, and hope, that others will take up the challenge by dealing\nwith the evidence provided by the collection of the spontaneous cases of a\ntelepathic character, I will confine the evidence I wish to bring forth in\nsupport of telepathy to some of the instances reported in the two volumes^\nof my experimental work on psychometry, carried out at King's College,\nLondon University. Before doing so, however, I submit that the defini-\ntions of \" clairvoyance \" and \" telepathy \" given by Dr Rhine require to\nbe slightly amended for the sake of greater precision and accuracy. They\nought to read as follows : When a percipient succeeds in identifying\nobjects by means transcending ordinary sensory and intellectual percep-\ntion, and those objects are not known to any mind, we commonly call the\nperformance clairvoyance. If there is similar success with respect, not to a\nconcrete object, symbols and illustrations included, but to the mental, viz.\npsychological, make-up of a person, the subconscious included, we speak of\ntelepathy. If both the object and the mind are possible targets, we are\nunable to differentiate whether the interrelation between the percipient\nand that which is perceived is one of clairvoyance or telepathy.\nThe experiments described in the first volume revealed a number of\ninstances of a striking or exceptional character accepted as veridical.\nSome of these applied to the actual time of the test and some to the more\nor less recent past. Adhering strictly to the above definitions, I fail to see\nhow any of the instances wherein that which was perceived belonged to the\npast can be claimed as being cases of clairvoyance, seeing that they were\nmerely in the mental make-up of the subject and not a concrete target. In\nmy submission, all identified memory targets come within the definition\nof telepathy.\nI do not dispute that some of the instances hereinafter selected may\npossibly be of a clairvoyant character but, as will readily be appreciated,\nthe conditions of telepathy are also present. As regards many of the other\n^J. Hettinger, The Ultia-Perceptive Faculty and Exploring the Ultra-Perceptive\nFaculty, Rider, London.\n\f12 y.

Hettinger [Part\nThe following instances belong to the collection of results obtained in\nthe experiments with illustrated magazines :\n8. llie subject was contemplating the picture of a guide whose cap was\ninscribed :\n\" SIGHT-SEEING GUIDE \" ; the caption of the picture\nwas :\n\" AND HERE ARE THE HIGH SPOTS \".\nSensitive : \"A mountain in the distance and boys roped together going\nup.\"\n9.

The only explanation I can think of is,\nthat one of them got the impression by some association of ideas first, and\nthe other one then perceived it telepathically. The sensitives were miles\napart from each other.\n12. I cannot resist adding the following instance from my further collec-\ntion, secured since the publication of the work referred to.\nThe subject was looking at a caricature of the ex-Prime Minister Baldwin.\nThe sensitive :\n\" A joke about an umbrella.\"\nThis obvious reference to Chamberlain, Baldwin's successor, is a striking\nillustration of that which I endeavoured to expound above regarding the\nreality of telepathy, as contrasted with clairvoyance ; for there was no\numbrella on the picture contemplated by the subject, and a joke as such\ncannot be seen clairvoyantly.\nGeneral comments on the problem as a whole.\n\" Clairvoyance \" and \" telepathy \" being only definitions of the con-\nditions under which the transcendental perception takes place, and not the\nexplanation of its modus operandi, of which we are still ignorant, I submit\nthat it is premature to speak of either of them being the hypothesis account-\ning for the perception under the two differentiated conditions. I am\nmaking this assertion, because of the apparent evidence that can be put\nforward in support of both clairvoyance and telepathy, based on the\nconditions prevailing at the time of the experience or experiment.\nThe bias we all have for telepathy\u2014not excluding Dr Rhine, according\nto his own admission\u2014is probably due to the fact, that a good many of us\nhave had personal experience of telepathy, at some time or other, but-\nhardly, if at all, of clairvoyance in the sense above defined. Irrespective\nof such bias, however, I submit in conclusion, as I hope to have proved by\n\f<1\n172] Comments on Dr Rhine''s \" Telept^hy \", etc. 15\nciting the above instances, that the nature of that which is perceived is\noften such, that a clairvoyant interpretation loses its locus standi owing to\nthe absence of the concrete counterpart of the perception, whilst the tele-\npathic one seems to be fully justified by the perception identifying some-\nthing that is purely mental at the time of the test.\nIII. By R. H. Thouless ,\n'\nThe points raised in Professor Rhine's article are deserving of attention by\nall experimentalists in the field of psychical research. The question of\nwhether telepathy has been proved by an experiment or observation in\nwhich all other paranormal explanations have been ruled out is obviously\na different question from that of whether telepathy is the most probable\nexplanation of many results which have been obtained. I also agree with\nRhine that the apparent impossibility of clairvoyance is not a reason for\ndeciding that it does not take place. If the results of experiments excluding\nall other paranormal explanations are positive (as appears to be the case),\nthen they require us to revise our ideas of what is and what is not possible.\nIt seems to me that a very great simplification of the issues would result\nif we could begin by discarding the terms \" telepathy \", \" clairvoyance \",\n\" pre-cognitive telepathy \", etc., and stating the various conditions under\nwhich psi-cognitions might occur. The problem is then to determine, by\ninvestigating the success of various combinations of these conditions,\nwhich are effective in producing psi-cognitions. The conditions to be\ninvestigated would seem to be the various combinations of (a) an event\noccurring or being merely thought of (b) normal knowledge of the event\nbeing or not being possessed by some other person, and, (c) the event, or\nknowledge of the event being present (or past) at the time of the experi-\nment or being then in the future.\nThe possible combinations of these conditions give us the following\npossibilities for investigation :\n(1) The event has taken place at the time of the subject's response but\nit is not then known by normal perception either to the subject or to any-\none else and will not be so known at any time afterwards.\n(2) The event has taken place at the time of the subject's response and\nit is known then by some other person or persons but is not known by any\nnormal process either then or at any time afterwards to the subject.\n(3) The event has taken place at the time of the subject's response but\nit is not known then by any normal process to the subject or to anyone else\nand will not be so known afterwards- to the subject although it will be by\nsome other person or persons.\n(4) The event has taken place at the time of the subject's response and is\nnot known then to the subject or to anyone else but will be known by\nnormal perception to the subject at some time afterwards.\n(5) The event will take place at some time after the subject's response\nand will not be known by normal perception either to the subject or to any\nother person at any time.\n(6) The event will take place after the subject's response and will be\n355452\n\f:\n^\nr . - !\ni6 > R. H. Thoidess [Part\nknown by normal processes of perception to some other person or persons\n;\nbut not to the subject.\n|\n(7) Tlie event will take place after the subject's response and will be;\nknown to the subject then by normal processes of perception.\n(8) No external event will take place but what is cognised will be an\nunrecorded thought in the mind of some other person or persons than the\nsubject which thought is contemporaneous with the subject's response.\n(9) No external event will take place but what is cognised is an un-\nrecorded thought in the mind of some other person or persons which\nthought is not determined until after the subject's response.\nThese correspond to all possibilities that seem at present to require\ninvestigation. Some have been done. No. i for example, is what\nRhine calls \" pure clairvoyance \" the evidence for which he considers in\nthe present article. Others are discussed in the later article which he has\nkindly sent me on \" Precognition reconsidered \". Other possibilities than\nthose listed above might be considered later, e:g. one might discriminate\nbetween the case when the event is past and when it is present as well as\nbetween present and future events.\nAny of the above conditions might be found to be necessary to para-\nnormal cognition in the sense that, without it, paranormal cognition did\nnot take place at all. Alternatively, a number of them might be found to\nbe sufficient conditions in the sense that with them alone paranormal cog-\nnition could take place although it might also take place in other com-\nbinations of conditions. Lastly, it might be found that certain of these\nconditions, although not necessary to paranormal cognition, were favour-\nable to it in the sense that better scores occurred with them than without.\nSo I should like to restate the problem as the experimental determina-\ntion of what are the necessary, the sufficient, and the favouring conditions\nfor paranormal cognition. This is, of course, essentially no more than a\nverbal restatement of the problem, but I think it helps to make the issue\nclearer and to strip it of many possibilities of misunderstanding.\nWith respect to the possibility of devising a test of pure telepathy (No. 8\nabove), this seems to me less difficult than Professor Rhine suggests.\nThe conditions he requires are that no external event shall determine the\nthought to be cognised and that no record of it shall be made. That the\nexperimenter should simply think of an object or card will not do, since\nmethods of assessing the chance score in a test of this kind are not valid if\nneither the sequence of events nor that of guesses is a random one. The\nproblem is to devise a method of getting a random sequence in the cards\nthought of by the experimenter without any external event determining\nthe card thought of. This can be attained by a combination of a random\nexternal determination producing randomness and an internal determina-\ntion destroying any exact correlation between the external event and the\ncard thought of.\nI am now carrying out an experiment designed to satisfy Rhine's criteria!\nfor an experiment in \" pure telepathy \". The method is as follows. The\nsubject has before him ten drawings : Anchor, Bone, Cat, Dagger, Ele-\nphant, Fish, Glass, Horse, Insect and Kangaroo. I sit behind him with a\npack of 20 cards containing two each of the numbers from i to 10. Before\nstarting the experiment I draw out four cards and record their numbers.\n\fthe\n:dif\nrhe\nirds\nling\n72J Comments on Dr Rhine's \" Telepathy \", ete. 17\n3y a means known only to myself, I derive from these cards a number\n'rem o to 9 which I shall add on to each of the numbers drawn from the\n)ack during the experiment. Since there are 80 possible ways of deriving\n. number from the four numbers recorded (by all possible combinations\n)f ignoring, adding, or subtracting each of them), no one can tell from the\nour numbers recorded what is the final number I have chosen. Yet it is\nietermined externally and not by me so that no successful result can be\nttributed to my precognition of the subject's guess. After these four\nards have been shuffled back into the pack, I draw a card and record its\nlumber. I then add to its number the number previously determined and\nhink of the picture corresponding to the sum so obtained (after subtracting\n|en if the sum exceeds ten) : of the anchor if the sum is one, of the bone\nf the sum is two, and so o'n.\nThe subject writes down the name of the picture he guesses that I am\nhinking of. After the whole twenty cards have been used, I copy the sub-\nset's responses on to my own sheet, recording how many he has guessed\night but making no record of which particular responses are right. There\n3 thus no external event either during the experiment or subsequent to it\nrom which the subject could know what were the right responses by\n* clairvoyance \" or by \" precognitive clairvoyance \". Although the ex-\neriment is completely recorded, the record would not tell anyone who\naw it which picture I was thinking of at any point unless he also knew\nomething which exists only in my own mind\u2014the method by which I\nerived the number to be added to each number drawn. Success can,\nherefore, only be explained as due to paranormal cognition of my thought,\nhat is, to telepathy. This experimental method could obviously be easily\ndapted for the detection of condition 9 (pure pre-cognitive telepathy) by\nhe subject making his guess before the experimenter turned up his card.\nIV. By G. N. M. Tyrrell\nr must have been obvious for some time, to others as well as to myself,\nlat the modern tendency to pin all faith to quantitative and statistical\nkthods of experiment in psychical research, with a neglect of qualitative\nhenomena, must lead to an unbalanced view of the subject. How un-\nalanced that view can become is illustrated by Professor J. B. Rhine's\nrticle, Telepathy and Clairvoyance Reconsidered, epitomised above. The\nsue raised in the article of whether certain apparently telepathic pheno-\nlena are in reality clairvoyant is relatively unimportant. What is of vital\nnportance is that Professor Rhine has been led, through an unconscious\nias, to deal with the evidence in a completely distorted manner.\nThe fundamentally erroneous assumption that Professor Rhine makes is\nlat evidence yielded by experiments of the card-guessing type is adequate\n) reveal the essential nature of extra-sensory perception. It may be\ndequate to demonstrate its existence and to illustrate some of its features ;\nut not to provide a general theory of it. Professor Rhine however, pro-\n'\"'^ds on the assumption that for theory-building it is virtually the only\ni^idence that need be taken into account.\n\f1 8 G. N. M. Tyrrell [Part\nWe all know the arguments in favour of experiments which can be com-\npletely controlled and mathematically evaluated, and we all know how\nsuccessful they have been in the physical sciences. What we have no right\nto do, and what so many people have hastily done, is to assume that they\nmust be equally successful in psychical research. In psychical research,\nthe method which is completely adequate in physics can only be applied to\nborder-phenomena. It cannot be carried right through the subject. Arti-\nficially simplified conditions can be obtained on the periphery ;\nbut we\ncannot go on simplifying situation after situation until we get to the heart\nof the phenomena. Also what we discover by examining the periphery\ndoes not appear to be representative of what happens further in. Tc\ngeneralise from peripheral evidence, as Professor Rhine does in his article,\nis to plunge headlong into errors.\nProfessor Rhine makes the startling statement that \" there is at the\nmoment no adequately reliable case for telepathy \". He appears to mean\nthat statistical evidence provides no adequately reliable case for telepathy ;\nbut he has so over-estimated the importance of statistical evidence, and\nuRcIer-estimated the importance of qualitative evidence, that he ignores\nthe latter altogether.\nIf we turn our attention for a moment from the advantages of controlled,\nstatistical experim.ents, and think instead of the kind of material to which\nthese experiments are confined, we shall see things more clearly. That\nmaterial consists of occasional faint, feeble and sporadic paranormal\nimpulses interjected into a series of pure, conscious guesses. These faint\nimpulses are slipped in here and there. But for them, the experiment is\none in normal psychology. There is the least possible interference with\nnormal conscious processes\u2014just a flickering infiltration from time to\ntime. That is precisely why the experiment is controllable. Introduce\nconditions under which the paranormal element becomes strong enough\nto reveal something of its true nature, and it at once becomes spontaneous\nas well. Then the experimenter's power of control is diminished and\nmathematical estimation of results becomes extremely difficult if not im-\npossible. The choices before us are two. (i) We may rely chiefly or\nqualitative research and obser v ation for our knowledge of the paranormal,\nusing statistical experiment as an auxiliary to elucidate special features\nand to act as a cast-iron hinge of indisputable evidence. (2) We may relj\nsolely on statistical evidence, condemning ourselves to remain on the fringe\nof the paranormal, thereby building theories about it based on a total mis-\napprehension of the facts. Professor Rhine in his article leads the wa)\ntowards the latter.\nThe fact is that the evidence for telepathy consists of three branches:\n(i) spontaneous items of evidence, (2) evidence occurring in trance and\nautomatic writing, (3) experimental evidence, which is not entirely\nstatistical, (i) There are hundreds of cases in which the straightforward\nexplanation is that they are telepathic in the sense of resulting from some\nkind of inter-mind relation (although we do not know fundamentally what\ntelepathy is). Why, if someone sees a vision or hears the voice of a distant\nperson, should it be supposed that this is done by the clairvoyant percep-\ntion of material objects ? There is nothing whatever to suggest it. (2) Or,\nif, at a trance-sitting, the sitter obtains an accurate description of some\n\fm\n:iia\nam\n172] Comments on Dr Rhine's \" Telepathy \", etc. 19\npast incident in the life of a dead friend, or obtains a reproduction of the\nmannerisms of that friend, why should this be put down to clairvoyance ?\nHow are the cross-correspondences to be explained by clairvoyance, and\nwhy should the attempt be made ? And the masses of apparently tele-\npathic information contained in automatic writing\u2014why attempt to torture\nthis into evidence for clairvoyance ? Professor Rhine does not attempt to\nshow how or why. He merely says that if the telepathic explanation is\npreferred, this is \" plainly not a matter of the weight of the evidence \" !\nWorkers in psychical research have been so hypnotised by the success\nof the completely controlled experiment in physics and in normal psycho-\nlogy that they are blind to the sixty years' accumulation of non-statistical\nevidence which lies before their eyes.\nSpontaneous cases of telepathy cannot be explained by clairvoyance,\neven if precognition is added to it, because the percipient in such cases is\nitji iunaware that extra-sensory perception is in progress. Being unaware,\nthere is nothing to guide his clairvoyant faculty towards what Prof. Broad\nM calls the \" cognitum \". There is no reason why an unassisted clairvoyant\nore faculty should seize upon the contemporary cognitum rather than upon\nany other contemporary event which interests the percipient. Even if we\ncd add precognition to clairvoyance, the same applies. There is no reason\nhid why the percipient should seize upon the subsequent record of the relevant\nevent rather than upon any other document or record which will enter his\nlal normal cognisance m the near future, such as a letter or newspaper article\nor a future page of his novel, unless telepathy is there to guide him. Indeed,\niti if Prof. Rhine's hypothesis were true, sensitives would frequently precog-\nivitl tiise such documents. But they do not.\n: ti Again, the hypothesis becomes an obvious absurdity when we consider-\nk the record of a case of telepathy which runs into several words, for it\nluj: issumes that this record is read by the percipient with complete verbal\neoii iccuracy. There is no evidence for anything like a completely accurate\nan \"acuity of precognition. If it existed, sensitives would be able to spread\nim jefore us a complete map of the future. Card-guessing is too restricted\nI'o\nm experiment to show this absurdity, and Prof. Rhine has bhnded him-\nma ielf to the facts by considering only card-guessing. He has actually been\njjR ed by this self-imposed blindness to put forward a general hypothesis\nrel vhich is contradicted by a large part of the evidence. His view of the\nino vhole field of paranormal phenomena is out of focus,\ntnis\nIt is profoundly to be hoped that investigators in psychical research\nvill restore some measure of balance and perspective to the subject by\nurning to neglected lines of qualitative research. They alone are to any\n;onsiderable degree informative, because the kind of paranormal event\nvhich is amenable to statistics is too restricted in character to tell us much\nbout the nature of the elusive faculty of paranormal cognition.\nI wish to emphasise that this is not a personal attack on Prof. Rhine,\non vho has always been most willing that his work should be freely criticised,\niii\nt is a protest against a point of view which is rapidly gaining ground\nsiai\nmongst workers who have failed to look all round the subject and take its\nce|\nneasure before applying to it the methods of physics. The result is that\n)0\nhey have formed a completely false perspective. ...\niOll -. .\nn\nk\nan\nirel\njar\n\f20 C. D. Broad [Part\nV.

(2) The person who is conducting such an experiment\nwill be called the Experimenter. (3) The event or thing or state of affairs\nwhich the subject in such an experiment is trying to cognise paranormally\nwill be called the Target. (4) If the subject succeeds in cognising a certain\nevent or thing or state of affairs, whether that was his target or not, the\nlatter will be called the Cognition. (5) If the target or the cognitum should\nbe a thought or other experience or a disposition in the mind of a certain\nperson, that person will be called the Subjective Container.\nThe same person might happen to play several of these parts in an ex-\nperiment. Suppose, e.g., that an individual were making observations on\nhimself in order to find out whether he could foresee to a significant extent\nwhat his experiences would be in certain assigned future circumstances.\nThen he would be at once the subject, the experimenter, and the sub-\njective container.\nProfessor Rhine's main Contentions. Using this terminology, we may, I\nthink, state the main contentions in Prof Rhine's paper as follows, (i)\nThere is adequate experimental evidence for the occurrence of paranormal\ncognition in cases where (i) the cognitum is something which is in principle\ncapable of being perceived at some time by normal sense-perception, i.e.,\nis an external physical thing or event, but (ii) it in fact never has been and\nnever will be normally perceived or inferred either by the subject himself\nor by anyone else.\n(2) There is at present no adequate experimental evidence for the\noccurrence of paranormal cognition in cases where (i) the cognitum is a\nthought or other experience in the mind of some subjective container, and\n(ii) there never has been or will be a physical thing or event which is either\n(a) the object of that experience, or (b) a record which would give rise to\nthat experience if cognised and interpreted by the subject, or (c) a datum\nfrom v\/hich the subject could acquire that experience by normal inference\nor by association if he were to cognise it.\nI shall describe cases which answer to the conditions laid down in\nProposition i as \" cases where telepathy is excluded \", and those which\nanswer to the conditions.Jaid down in Proposition 2 as \" cases where\nclairvoyance is excluded \". S\"o Proposition i asserts that there is adequate\nexperimental evidence for the occurrence of paranormal cognition in cases\nwhere telepathy is excluded ; and Proposition 2 asserts that there is not\nadequate experimental evidence for the occurrence of paranormal cognition\nin cases where clairvoyance is excluded.\nI\n\f172] Comments on Dr Rhine's \" Telepathy \", etc. 21\n(3) The evidence for Proposition 2 depends on the acceptance of Pro-\nposition I in its most extended form. Suppose it is granted that there is\nadequate experimental evidence that a subject can at a certain moment\nhave paranormal cognition of a physical event that has not yet happened\nor of a physical thing that does not yet exist, but which will do so later,\n'a even though neither he nor anyone else will ever cognise that object by\n\u2022^1'\nnormal sense-perception or inference. Then obviously a great many\nsuccessful experiments which seemed to be cases excluding clairvoyance\nhave not certainly fulfilled that condition. Suppose, e.g., that a record,\neither in speech or in writing, will be made afterwards ; and that it is of\nsuch a nature that the subject, if aware of it, could infer from it that such\nand such an event has happened. Then it is possible that the subject was\naware, at the time when he made his response, by clairvoyant precognition\nof the as yet unmade record. And, if so, it is possible that his cognition\nof the event which will aftenvards be recorded is due to normal inter-\n^'i'o\npretation of this clairvoyant precognition of the subsequent record,\nthe Legitimate and illegitimate Conclusions. Since such possibilities as these\nwere not envisaged, it is not surprising that past experiments have not been\ntail designed to exclude them ; and it is obviously desirable that new experi-\nments should be designed with that object in view. It should be noted\nthat, if paranormal cognition of an event is ever in fact accomplished by\ninterpreting one's clairvoyant precognition of an as yet unmade record of\nit, we have a separation between the target and the cognitim. The target\nis the event ;\nbut this is cognised by normal interpretation of paranormally\nub- acquired data. The cognitum is the as yet ynmade record. This is para-\nnormally cognised, but it is not the target at which the subject was\naiming.\nSuppose that there is adequate evidence for paranormal cognition in\ncases where telepathy is excluded. And suppose that it should be found\nthat, when experiments are done under conditions where clairvoyance is\nexcluded, there is not evidence for paranormal cognition. Then the con-\n; elusions which could legitimately be drawn are the following, (i) In an\nii\nexperimental set-up of this nature, and with such subjects as have been\njused in the experiments, the presence of clairvoyant ' conditions, is both\ntill\nnecessary and sufficient to ensure a detectable amount of paranormal\nIS I\n;ognition. (ii) With the same qualifications, the presence of telepathic\nn conditions is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure a detectable amount\nk of paranormal cognition. The following conclusions would be quite\net illegitimate, (i) That either of these propositions would hold good with-\nm out the qualifying clauses with which they are prefaced. It would remain\n;nc possible, e.g., that either or both of them would break down in certain\nspontaneous cases or if the subjects were mediums or other persons in\n1\nii\nwhom the power of supernormal cognition was highly developed, (ii)\nbid That, even when the qualifying clauses hold, the telepathic conditions are\nber causally irrelevant. In the vast majority of the successful experiments\nuat neither telepathy nor clairvoyance was excluded. It would be quite il-\nase :egitimate to argue that in these cases the simultaneous normal cognition\nM }\u00a3 the cognitum by other persons, or the subsequent normal cognition of\nMl it by the subject, had nothing to do with the subject's paranormal cognition\npf it. As Dr Thouless points out, we have to consider conditions which\n\f22 C. D. Broad [Part ;\nfavour or check a phenomenon as well as those which are necessary or :\nsufficient to produce or to inhibit it.\nj\nThe Evidence for Propositions i and 2. As regards the evidence for Pro- ,\nposition I ,\ni.e., that paranormal cognition has been experimentally established\nin cases where telepathy is excluded, I would make the following remarks.\n(i) The evidence must be of a rather peculiar kind. In order to have\nreason to believe that paranormal cognition has taken place someone or\nother must have reason to believe that events corresponding to the sub-\nject's guesses have happened. But in order that telepathy may be ex-\ncluded no-one must ever normally perceive or infer those events.\n(ii) It seems to me that Prof Rhine's procedure in such cases is always of\nthe following form. He infers that the subject must have known certain\nthings, which are not then and cannot now be normially known by anyone,\non the ground that he did certain things which he could not have done un-\nless he had been guided by such knowledge. An example is provided by\nthe shuffling experiments. The subject shuffled pack A and got it to agree\nwith the target pack fi to a significantly greater extent than might be ex-\npected by chance. This required something more than paranormal cog-\nnition of the arrangement of the cards in pack B, which he might have got\nby telepathic precognition. It required also paranormal cognition of the\narrangement of the cards in pack A just before he made his last series of\nmovements. For, unless he had known how the cards in A were then\narranged, he would not have known how' to shift them about in such a way\nas to conform to the arrangement of the cards in B. The argument is\nsimilar, mutatis mutandis, to show that paranormal cognition is involved in\nthe dice-throwing experiments.\nNow this kind of argument strikes me as somewhat naive. The position\nis as follows. The subject in each case is trying to bring about a certain\nspatial arrangement of physical objects, in the one experiment by handling\nthem in the normal way and in the other by some paranormal action called!\n\" psychokinesis \". The assumption which Prof Rhine makes is that the\nsubject must know how they are arranged immediately before he interferes\nwith them if he is to be able to take the appropriate action to secure the\nkind of rearrangement at which he is aiming. Now this is doubtless true\nof normal voluntary action guided by normal sense-perception or inference.\nBut we have already thrown over the rules which we normally assume to\nlimit human cognition so far as to allow that a person may have non-\ninferential knowledge of a physical event which has not yet happened and\nof which no-one ever has had or will have normal cognition. And we have\nalready thrown over the rules which we normally assume to limit human\nvoluntary action so far as to allow that a person can voluntarily affect the\nposition and motion of a foreign body without either (a) direct handling,\nor (b) indirect manipulation through some kind of mechanism which he\ncontrols by direct handling. When two of the most fundamental principles!\nor prejudices of commonsense have thus been rejected it seems to nie a\nlittle simple-minded to assume that the one at present under discussion,\nwhich is so closely connected with them, can be relied upon as the premiss\nof an argument. For my part, if I am forced to accept things which are so\nshocking to my common-sense as precognitive clairvoyance and psycho-\nkinesis, I shall feel no confidence in any of the other limiting principles\n\fiRT 172] Comments on Dr Rhine's \" Telepathy \", etc. 23\nor which common-sense and ordinary natural science have always presup-\nposed. And therefore I shall feel no confidence in the conclusion of any\nargument which takes one of these principles as a premiss.\nI pass now to the evidence for Prof Rhine's Proposition 2, viz., that\nparanormal cognition has not been experimentally established in any case\nm in which clairvoyance is excluded. About this I would make the following\nor|remarks.\n(i) Taking two of the best series of English experiments, I think we can\nsay that (a) in the Tyrrell experiments telepathic conditions v\/ere not\nnecessary to secure a significant degree of success, and (b) in the Soal-\nGoldney experiments telepathic conditions were necessary to secure a sig-\nnificant degree of success.\nIn the case of the Soal-Goldney experiments the utmost that Prof Rhine\ncan suggest is that conceivably the telepathic conditions were necessary\nonly in a secondary, and not in a primary, sense. That is to say, he suggests\nthat perhaps what was necessary was the agent's knowledge or belief that the\ntelepathic conditions were fulfilled, and not the fact itself. The suggestion\nis that, when this knowledge or belief is replaced by its opposite, this\ngot particular agent's power of paranormal cognition is inhibited so far as\nth( concerns the target at which he is aiming.\nAbout this there are two remarks to be made, (a) The suggestion re-\nquires that the agent's power of paranormal cognition remains uninhibited\nvajj in other directions. For we have to assume that he knows paranormally\nwhen the experimenter switches over in the course of an experiment from\nthe telepathic to the non-telepathic conditions, (b) The utmost that can\nbe said for the suggestion is that it is just logically possible. It is not, so\nfar as I know, inconsistent with the reported facts that all the successes\nshould have been due to pure precognitive clairvoyance ; that the fulfil-\nment of the telepathic conditions should have been primarily irrelevant\n;\nand that the failure when the telepathic conditions are absent should be\ndue merely to the inhibiting effect on the subject of his purely clairvoyant\nknowledge of their absence. But the suggestion is far-fetched to the\ntt\nhighest degree ;\nand, so far as I am aware, there are no positive grounds\nfor thinking it likely. There is one and only one motive for making it, viz.,\nice|a praiseworthy desire to stimulate experimenters to devise experiments in\nwhich telepathic conditions are present and clairvoyant conditions com-\npletely absent, in order to find out whether paranormal cognition can then\ntake place.\n(ii) I think that the difficulty of ensuring the complete absence of relevant\nclairvoyant conditions has been in one respect exaggerated. It seems to be\ntil\nforgotten that it is useless for the agent to have clairvoyant cognition,\nwhether simultaneous or precognitive, of a set of sounds or marks which\nare in fact symbols for a proposition unless he also knows how to interpret\nthe symbols. Suppose, e.g., that the records of an experiment were made\nin Sanskrit, and that the agent, like most of us, does not know that language.\nThen he may have as much purely clairvoyant knowledge and foreknow-\nledge as you like of these records ; but it will not help him in the least un-\nless he can tap the mind of some person who knows what the sentences\nmean.\nFor this reason it seems to me, e.g., that Mr Whately Carington's remark\n\f24 C. D. Broad [Part\nthat the clain^oyant explanation is never theoretically eliminable because\nthe subject might be held to be clairvoyantly aware of the brain-states, etc.,\nwhich accompany a thought in the mind of a subjective container, is need-\nlessly pessimistic. Such knowledge, so far as I can see, would not be of\nthe least use to the subject unless supplemented by knowledge of the laws\nof correlation between brain-states and thoughts ; and these laws ex\nhypothesi could not be known by pure clairvoyance.\n(iii) Suppose there were a case in which a person has a mistaken belief\nabout the details of a certain event ; and suppose that a subject has para-\nnormal cognition, not of the actual details of that event, but of the features\nwhich that person mistakenly believes it to have. This would prima facie\nbe a case of telepathy, simultaneous or precognitive, and not of clair-\nvoyance. Some well-attested cases of precognition fall, I think, under this\nheading.\nProf. Rhine on Spontaneous and Mediumistic Cases. I think it would be\nbreaking a butterfly upon a wheel to take very seriously the remarks which\nProf Rhine throws out under this heading. Only a person with an exten-\nsive knowledge of the literature of the subject, who had gone very carefully\ninto the details of a large number of well-attested cases of various kinds,\ncould make any useful pronouncement on whether any of them occur\nunder non-telepathic conditions and any of them under non-clairvoyant\nconditions. I see no evidence that Prof Rhine has the necessary equipment\nor has taken the necessary trouble to qualify him to pronounce on such\nquestions. And, to do him justice, I do not think that he would seriously\nclaim in the present paper to have done more than suggest that such an\nenquiry might be worth while.\nI think that the position is roughly as follows. The founders of the\nS.P.R. considered that telepathy had been established by experiment with\nnormal persons under normal conditions. They therefore felt justified in\ntreating it as a vera causa, and they felt that it ought to be pressed as far as\nit would go in explaining spontaneous phenomena and those occurring in\npresence of mediums. Only when the hypothesis of an extended telepathy\namong the living had been tried and had been found inadequate should\ncommunication from the spirits of the dead be admitted as an hypothesis.\nIf that methodological principle was ever sound, it remains so still ; but it\nneeds to be modified in detail in the following way. We must substitute\nthe wider phrase \" paranormal cognition \" for the more special phrase\n\" telepathy \" ; we must recognise that there is now experimental evidence\nfor precognition and for pure clairvoyance ; and we must admit that,\nwhen these possibilities are allowed for, it becomes uncertain whether\nmany well-attested cases of paranormal cognition which were counted as\ninstances of telepathy really were so. I doubt whether this does much\neither to strengthen or to weaken the already existing case for the spiritistic\nhypothesis ; but only a detailed investigation of a wide selection of the\nbest cases would justify one in making any confident pronouncement on\nthis point.\nSome Points in the other Papers. The following remarks are perhaps\njust worth making.\n(i) I am very much in sympathy with Dr Thouless's approach by way of\nmaking a systematic analysis of the conditions under which paranormal\n\u00ab1\n\f\u00ab1 172] Comments on Dr Rhine's \" Telepathy \", etc. 25\nlist cognition takes place or fails to take place. We must remember, however,\ntc, that conditions which are necessary with one subject and one experimenter\ned- might prove to be superfluous or even detrimental with another subject or\n:ol another experimenter.\nm (2) I am puzzled to know whether islr Tyrrell really thinks that there is\nfi any known alternative method of discovering the laws of phenomena be-\nside that of experiment. I understand by that method the attempt to\nk analyse and control conditions and to vary them one at a time. There is\nra obviously n^othing in the experimental method as such which compels us\nre to confine it to the investigation of feeble instances of paranormal pheno-\n10 mena. Our trouble is that we do not at present know how to produce at\nlir will strong and persistent instances. Unless and until we can do so we\nhi shall remain in the position of persons v\/hose observations on electrical\nphenomena were confined to (i) the feeble effects producible by rubbing\nb glass with catskin, and (ii) occasional thunder-storms. We shall get going\nid if and only if we can devise means, analogous to the Wimshurst machine,\n;n the electric cell, the intensity-coil, and so on, of getting reasonably strong\nill\neffects whenever we want them. If ever and whenever we do this we shall\nbe able to carry out experiments in psychics analogous to those which we\nji now do in physics. But until this is possible I do not believe that we shall\nin make very much further progress. Meanwhile we must do our best with\nin our regular catskin and our occasional thunder-storms, and there is nothing\ncl\nto be gained by pretending that either is the only method or that either\nsi\nalone or both together offer any very bright prospects,\nai (3) Mr Whately Carington raises the following theoretical difficulty\nabout pure clairvoyance. It is meaningless to say, e.g., that a person per-\nil ceives a red spot on a white card in the dark. For to say that a card which\niti\nis in the dark is white and has a red spot on it means simply and solely that\n11\nany normal person would have visual sensations of a certain kind if ever and\na\nwhenever he were to view that card in white light. Now a conditional pro-\nii\nposition, such as this, is not an object which could intelligibly be said to be\nh] perceptible. Suppose, on the other hand, we say that what is clairvoyantly\nperceived in the dark, is not this conditional proposition, but a certain per-\nj; sistent property which is the categorical ground of the conditional pro-\nii\nposition. Then, Mr Whately Carington asserts, this is meaningless because\niti\nsuch a property by hypothesis could never be perceived by any of the senses,\ns\nAnd what is in principle incapable of being perceived is a mere fiction,\nci\nIf I have understood this argument correctly, it seems to me to beg the\nIt\nquestion. Either it is or it is not conceivable that there should be direct\ne:\nacquaintance with particulars by other means than ordinary sense-\na;\nperception. If we say that it is not conceivable, then we rule out the possi-\n;r bility of clairvoyance by definition. If, on the other hand, we admit that it\ni(\nis conceivable, we must widen our criterion of \" existence \" and say that\nI,;\nwhat exists must in principle be capable of being perceived either by the\n,[\nsenses or clairvoyantly. But in that case we cannot maintain the present\nobjection to saying that what the clairvoyant perceives in the dark is the\np,\npersistent categorical ground of a certain conditional proposition about\nnormal visual perception. Certainly this is in principls^ incapable of being\n0\nperceived by the senses ; but that is only one of the two alternatives which\n; the extended principle admits.\n\f26 Denys Parsons [Part\nVI. NOTES ON DR RHINE'S \" TELEPATHY AND\nCLAIRVOYANCE\"!\nBy Denys Parsons\nRhine has not given \" spontaneous \" cases the attention they deserve.\nSome of these support telepathy and some support clairvoyance. In the\nlatter class we have the well-known case of Mrs Titus, which finally con-\nvinced William James of the reality of psychic phenomena (Richet \" Le\nSixieme Sens \", p. 55). A young girl disappeared. Two or three days\nlater Mrs Titus who lived about 5 miles away, dreamt that she saw the\nbody in a particular spot. Later she explained to a diver that the body\nwas wedged in a certain position under a bridge. The diver went down\nand found the body exactly in the position described. A similar case\n{Jour., S.P.R. 1889, IV, 93) deals with the finding of the bodies of two\nmen and their dogs.\nTo explain these cases by telepathy one could argue that the message\nwas sent before death and remained latent for some time in the percipient's\nsubconscious mind. Clairvoyance gives a more direct explanation, but\nthe survival hypothesis will also fit.\nParticularly impressive as evidence for clairvoyance are cases in which\ninanimate objects are located in unexpected places. Dowsing comes into\nthis category, although in my opinion the evidence for this phenomenon\ncannot yet be considered satisfactory.\nPowerful support for telepathy is provided by Soal's \" John Ferguson\n\"\ncase (\" A Report on Some Communications received through Mrs Blanche\nCooper \"\u2014Prof. S.P.R. 1925, XXXV). Soal's private conjectures about\na purely fictitious character of his own invention were confirmed at his\nnext sitting with the medium, often with considerable accuracy and detail.\nReferring to these experiments Soal says :\n\" No written notes were made\nof my conjectures about '\nJohn Ferguson '\nuntil after I had recorded the\nmedium's confirmatory statement. At the time I had not the remotest\nidea of any future publication. If therefore these conjectures were\naccessible to clairvoyance it could only be a kind of '\nprecognitive\n'\nclairvoyance.\"\nBut it is highly probable that Soal would not have made any notes if\nthe medium had been wrong, therefore the medium had to be right before\nthe records which would permit precognitive clairvoyance could come into\nexistence. Since Rhine has used an exactly analogous argument to sup-\nport clairvoyance in Screened Touch Matching of card decks, he can\nhardly deny its validity here as a strong argument for telepathy.\nIn discussing the Soal and Goldney experiments Rhine argues that the\nfact that only certain persons were successful agents is only suggestive of\ntelepathy, since the subject's attitude or belief is a great factor in deter-\nmining success or failure. But it was not quite so simple ; the significant\nfact from the point of view of telepathy was that different agents caused\nnot major differences in scores but major differences in the nature of the\ndisplacement effects.\n^ The following comments were received after Dr Broad had written his summing-\nup, and therefore are not included in his observations. Hon. Ed.\n\flya] Dr J. B. Rhine s Reply 27\nSoal and Goldney's subject failed when the conditions began to approach\nthose of clairvoyance. Rhine argues that this is not necessarily good\nevidence for telepathy since \"the mere fact that the subject believed his\nability was telepathy \" could have inhibited his success. I must put it on\nrecord that Shackleton was equally confident in his ability to demonstrate\nclairvoyance with the coloured counters in my own apparatus. (The\nresults of both telepathy and clairvoyance tests with B. S. agreed with\nchance expectation.)\nNow Shackleton failed in clairvoyance and succeeded in telepathy even\nwhen he did not know which of the two conditions the experimenters\nwere using. Rhine argues that he might have known (clairvoyantly)\nwhich technique was being used. But is it not strange that he should get\n100% success in detecting a change in technique, considering that his\ntrue cognitions of the card symbols never rose above 30% ? (Rhine's\nreply to this is that there may have been some inherent factor in the clair-\nvoyant conditions themselves which caused the failure.)\nTurning now to the American work, I consider Rhine has made out an\nexcellent case for clairvoyance, and if the empirical facts are accepted, I\ndo not think that it profits us much to argue that clairvoyance is a contra-\ndiction in terms or that there is no place for it in our philosophy.\nDR. J. B. RHINE'S REPLY\nIt was a generous arrangement which permits me to reply to the comments\ngiven above. First, it should be said that, if my article had to be abridged\nin the interests of space, a better condensation could hardly have been\nmade. I am naturally pleased, too, that this paper is regarded as worthy of\nreproduction in the S.P.R. Proceedings, although as an experimenter I\nwould naturally not have chosen a non-experimental article such as this to\nrepresent me in your pages.\nThe aim of my discussion was mainly to urge that experiments of better\ndesign be directed toward the problem of the occurrence of telepathy. As\nit turned out, no one, I believe, has questioned the need for these. There is\ndisagreement only on the question of how badly we need the new experi-\nments. By far the most important development resulting from the article\nis the fact that Professor Thouless has already begun a newly designed\nexperiment in pure telepathy. His procedure seems to be an excellent one.\nHere at Duke University we think we have now found it possible, as a\na result of group thinking stimulated by these discussions, to apply an\nindependent check on the accuracy of the experimenter's observations, and\nthus to put the test on a par with the best clairvoyance tests. In using this\nprocedure the experimenter communicates his code to an assistant through\nsubjective associations based upon common memories and having no\nobjective link that could be traced by clairvoyance even by precognitive or\nretrocognitive clairvoyance.\nProfessor Broad's article has a number of suggestions likely to be of\nvalue in experimental work. One of these is his remark about the useless-\nness for clairvoyance of objective signs. He uses the illustration of the\n\f2^ DrJ. B. Rhine's Reply [Part\nrecords of an experiment being made in Sanslcrit, if the agent does not know\nthat language Also his comment on Mr Carington's remark about the\nclairvoyance of bram states appears to take care of a troublesome aspect of\nthe telepathy problem. ^\nOne could %vish that so clear and effective a statement of the possible\ncombination of the condition for ESP experiments as that given by\nUr Ihouless had been before our minds back through the years of\nfuturetes\u00b0 arch''\nP\u2122^'\"\"\"'' '^\"\"^^ be of great help in\nThere is much that I have found of interest and value in the comments\non my article, and which I should like to discuss at length with the com-\nmentators ;\nwe should, I believe, find much general agreement For\nexample, I expressed in my first book, published in 193^, a view of the\nunity of telepathy and clairvoyance, such as that described by Mr Caring-\nton.

The percipient\ncan thus make clairvoyant trials at his leisure, a few in the morning, a\nfew more at night, when he feels in the mood.\nThe apparatus is prepared for use in clairvoyance tests according to a\nrigid routine. The quantity of counters decided on (50, 100, or 200) is\nplaced in a 16 oz. narrow-necked glass bottle. From this moment on\nuntil the final counting of hits the experimenter neither sees nor handles\nthe counters. He retires alone to an adjoining room and sits down at a\ntable under which the apparatus is placed. Leaning well forward over\nthe table he holds the bottle underneath it in a horizontal position. Then,\nwith fingers and thumb loosely round the neck of the bottle, he gives it\nICQ rapid half-turns with the other hand to shuffle the counters. Still\nkeeping the bottle under the table, he removes the cap and delivers the\ncounters into the chimney hopper by slowly .rotating and shaking the\nbottle over it. The chimney is then corked up and the apparatus may\nthen be lifted up and taken back to the room where the percipient\nis waiting. The percipient may sort the counters himself or he may\ncall out his guesses to a neutral operator. (The latter procedure was\nrarely used.)\nAfter the sorting the apparatus is opened ^ and the number of successes\nis counted (i.e. the number of blue counters found in the blue compartment\nplus the reds in the red, etc.). The procedure satisfies the conditions for\nclairvoyance.^ Neither the experimenter nor the percipient, nor any\nliving thing knows, or ever will know what was the order of the counters\nin the tube, or the result of any individual trial. The only figures obtained\nare the total number of trials and the total number of successes.

The\nsort of results hoped for were either :\n(a) the subject scores significantly on Telepathy and Clairvoyance,\nor (b) the subject scores significantly on Telepathy but gets only chance\nscores on Clairvoyance, or vice versa.\nUnfortunately all results were in accordance with chance.\nSchmeidler (\" Predicting good and bad scores.\" J.

The sheep\nscored positively and the goats negatively. The results of the sheep were\nindependently significant and the difference between the scores of the\ntwo groups was highly significant. This procedure was foUov\/ed with the\n44 percipients of the present series of experiments. At the conclusion of\nthe experiments the percipients were divided into sheep and goats, without\nreference to their scores, as accurately as was possible from a personal\nestimate of their character and philosophy of life, and from memory of\nthe attitude they had shown to the experiments. (Most of the percipients\nwere friends or acquaintances.) The experimenter classes himself as a\nsheep, but lists his own results separately since they far outnumber those\nof any other individual.\nTable II : Results\n(E = Expected on chance basis 0 = observed)\nClairvoyance Telepathy\nTrials Successes Trials Successes\nE 1,090 E 200\nExperimenter S.452 1,000\n0 1,062 0 194\nE 1,162 E 929\nOther Sheep only -\n5,812 4,646\n(25) 0 1,163 0 959\nAll Percipients\nE 3>i72 E 1,670\n15.859 8,348\n(44) 0 3>i7i 0 1,674\nNineteen percipients were tested for Clairvoyance only, ten for\nTelepathy only, and fifteen for both.

Firstly, it contains\nvaluable data on the problem of the Duncan mediumship. Secondly, it\nconstitutes a first-rate study of human testimony in relation to psychic\nphenomena. Thirdly, the trial is directly concerned with the law relating\nto psychic phenomena, with which it is our duty to be familiar.\nThere are, therefore, three important problems to be considered in the\nlight of the Duncan trial, and they are dealt with separately in the three\nbrief articles immediately following this review. It is hoped that readers\nof these articles will be encouraged to obtain the book under review and\nstudy it for themselves.\nThe report of the trial occupies over three hundred pages and constitutes\nthe major portion of the book. It is introduced by an editorial, in which\nthe course of the trial is summarised and discussed, apparently from the\npoint of view of the lay sceptic. A report of the judgment at the Court\nof Criminal Appeal, to which the case was eventually taken, is included,\n'\nand a brief historical note on the Old Bailey by Helena Normanton appears\nat the end. The book is illustrated by photographs of the chief characters\nconcerned.\n\/. HELEN DUNCAN : A BRIEF HISTOR Y OF HER MEDIUM-\nSHIP\nHelen Victoria Duncan is unquestionably the most famous member of\nthat rare species, the contemporary British materialising medium. It\nwould be a defiance of our proverbial national pride not to give her a\nplace in the Proceedings.\nMrs Duncan was born in Callander, Perthshire, in 1898. She is of\nworking-class antecedents and married a cabinet-maker, who blessed her\nwith a large family and then retired from work for many years.\nScotland was the scene of Mrs Duncan's earliest exploits, but her fame\ninevitably spread and soon reached the pages of the London Spiritualist\njournal Light.\nMajor C. H. Mowbray had some sittings with the Duncans in Scotland,\nand wrote, an account for the British College of Psychic Science in London.\nHe was of the opinion that she was fraudulent.\nINVESTIGA TIONAT THELONDONSPIRITUALIST ALLIANCE\nThe first systematic investigation of which we have a record is that\n'\ncarried out by the Research Department of the London Spiritualist\nAlliance in the course of some fifty sittings extending from October 1930\nto June 193 1. The investigators included Dr Fielding Ould, Sir Ernest\n^ The Trial of Mrs Duncan. Edited, with a Foreword, by C. E. Bechhofer\nRoberts. London : Jarrolds, 1945. 125. bd.\nc\n\f34 Donald J. West [Part\nBennett, Lord Charles Hope, Miss Mercy Phillimore, (Secretary to the\nL.S.A.) and Dr Rust. They were not all present at ever}? sitting. Oc-\ncasional visitors included Sir Oliver Lodge, Dr E. J . Dingwall, Mrs K. M.\nGoldney and other S.P.R. members.\nTwo interim reports were published in Light (Feb. 28th and May i6th,\n193 1\n) which were favourable to the mediumship, but the third and final\nreport {Light, July 17th, 1931) was written in a completely different tone\nand accused Mrs Duncan of fraudulent practices. The Committee had\ncome to the conclusion, as the investigation proceeded, that Mrs Duncan\nresorted to fraud, but they were never agreed as to the proportion of\nfraudulent to genuine phenomena. By the kindness of the Secretary and\nCouncil of the L.S.A., we have been allowed to study the original accounts\nof these Duncan seances and to see the specimens of purported ectoplasm\nwhich were obtained. *\nAt a typical Duncan seance the sitters are seated in a single or double\ncrescent with the medium in a corner of the room that is curtained off and\nknown as the cabinet. The room is illuminated with red light, sometimes\nfairly strongly, but inside the cabinet there is deep shadow. Suspicious\nas these conditions are, Mrs Duncan caijnot be held responsible for them,\nsince they are traditional among phj'sical mediums. I\nMrs Duncan is stripped, searched, dressed in specially designed seance\ngarments and led to her chair within the cabinet. Mr Duncan is usually |\nsomewhere at the back of the room, behind the sitters, operating a gramo-\nphone, i\nMrs Duncan passes into her trance state and the voice of Albert Stuart,\nj\nher spirit control, is heard. Albert is said to have been a pattern-maker\nof Dundee, who emigrated to Sydney, Australia. There appears to be no i\nevidence that Albert's voice is independent of the medium's larynx. His i\nfunction is to direct the proceedings, and no sitter may move, or touch the\nmanifestations, without his permission.\nThe phenomena consist of purported ectoplasm and materialisations.\nThe ectoplasm is in the form of sheets and coils of white material, seen\ndraped about the medium when the cabinet curtains are pulled apart. On\noccasion the medium walks right out of the cabinet with yards of this\nstrange material draped all over her and trailing in a train behind her.\nAt the L.S.A. the materialisations were white shapes, dimly seen through\nthe gap between the curtains and roughly approximating to human forms,\nbut with faces absent or else hardly recognisable. i\nThe main problem of the Duncan mediumship is how the white material\ngets into the cabinet when medium ^nd cabinet have been searched\nmeticulously beforehand. The sceptic's answer to the Duncan ectoplasm\nis that the stuff consists of fine-mesh material, that is cheese-cloth or\nbutter-muslin, which is capable of being compressed into comparatively\nsmall volume. The tulle is swallowed by the medium prior to a seance,\nregurgigated under cover of the cabinet curtains when ectoplasm is re-\nquired, and swallowed again at the end of the sitting.\nThis explanation sounds so fantastic that unless there had been some\nvery good supporting evidence it need hardly have been taken into con-\nsideration. Anyone who has had experience of the time and effort required\nto swallow a narrow rubber tube for the purpose of a stomach examination\n\fiy2] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 35\nmust marvel at Mrs Duncan and her yards of cheese-cloth. Although\nchoking noises have been reported at Duncan seances, often enough the\nregurgitation must have been accomplished swiftly and silently.\nThere is, of course, the possibility that the medium could have evaded\nthe search and produced the cheese-cloth without regurgitation. Doubt-\nless the search was sometimes performed by modest persons, who might\nbe somewhat perfunctory, in which case the packet of '\nprops '\ncould be\nconcealed by passing it quickly from one part of the body to another. The\nmedium could never be sure of this, however, and she could never be\ncertain that a vaginal and rectal examination would not be requested.\nMoreover, the methods of search adopted at the Harry Price sittings have\nbeen described to us in some detail, and they appear to preclude the regular\npractice of this type of fraud.\nAnother possible explanation, which would do away with the necessity\nfor assuming regurgitation, is that a confederate passed the cheese-cloth\nto Mrs Duncan during the course of the seance. Mr Duncan's continual\npresence is suspicious. The only time Mr Duncan was not present during\nthe London investigations at the L.S.A. and the National Laboratory was\nat one of the Harry Price sittings, and on that occasion no cheese-cloth\nappeared. However, it is only fair to state that there may have been other\nreasons for its absence on this occasion. Moreover, having regard to the\ngood lighting conditions at some of the seances, and the fact that Mr\nDuncan was at the back of the room, this explanation also seems to be\nruled out. Whatever method of fraud Mrs Duncan used, if fraud it was,\nwas absolutely dependable, for hardly a sitting went by without some\n'\ncheese-cloth '\nappearing.\nAt some of the L.S.A. sittings '\nAlbert '\nleft behind specimens of\n'\nectoplasm '\n\u2014five in all\u2014for the investigators to examine. The last speci-\nmen, obtained on April loth 193 1, was cut away as it protruded a few inches\nout of the medium's mouth. At this seance, the medium had been\nsearched as usual and dressed in a one-piece suit with neck, arms and ankles\ntied with tapes and sealed to her chair. She wore gauntlets fastened at the\nwrists with surgical tape. Two of the earlier specimens were found to be\n\" paper, cloth, and such everyday materials\", mixed with an organic\n, substance in every way similar to white of egg. The last two specimens\ni were pads of surgical gauze soaked in resinous fluid. They were identical\nwith a sanitary towel which Mrs Duncan left behind one day in a dressing-\nroom which only she had used.\nMrs Duncan also gave the L.S.A. specimens of abnormal urine, which\nwere loaded with absurdly large quantities of albumen, said to be due to\nthe effect of the materialisation phenomena on her metabolism. Shortly\nafter this, Mrs Duncan had occasion to attend St. Thomas's Hospital,\nwhere her urine was tested and found to be normal.\nWhen it is remembered that these adverse findings are recorded by a\nSpiritualist Association, there can be no doubt that Mrs Duncan resorts to\nfraud of one sort or another on certain occasions.\nTo return to the regurgitation hypothesis, the L.S.A. investigation\naffords the sceptic several pieces of evidence that this was the method of\nfraud employed. Although it was not photographed, the appearance and\nfeel of the '\nectoplasm '\nwas compatible with the assumption that it was\n\f36 Donald y. West '\n\"\n[Part\nordinary cheese-clotli, and under the conditions of some of the sittings\nregurgitation may have been the only method whereby such material could\nhave been introduced into the cabinet.\nMany times the stuff was seen apparently issuing from the medium's\nmouth. At the sitting on May 29th 1931, the medium came right out of:\nthe cabinet and stood under the light. The substance was seen comin.\"\nout of her mouth in a strip about i\\ inches wide and 12 inches long. It\n'\nwas slowly drawn back into the mouth to the accompaniment of swallowing\nmovements of the lower lip and throat.^ This incident is only evidence\nfor regurgitation provided one is willing to assume that the manifestation\nin question was not genuine ectoplasm. One must also bear in mind\nthat the piece seen to be swallowed was small compared with the yards of\n'\ncheese-cloth '\nthat had been witnessed at other times.\nBetter evidence for regurgitation was obtained at the last L.S.A. sitting\non June 12th 193 1. Mrs Duncan was made to swallow a pill containing\nmethylene blue, which would stain any material that might be lying in her\nstomach. This was the only one of all the L.S.A. sittings at which no\nectoplasm was produced. During the sitting the medium put out her\ntongue and this was claimed by Albert to be ectoplasm.\nDr Margaret Vivian reports (in a letter to Mr Abdy Collins) that on\ntwo occasions at Bournemouth Mrs Duncan produced white ectoplasm\nafter swallowing methylene blue, but it is possible that the conditions were\nsuch as to allow her to conceal the stuff without swallowing it.\nUnfortunately for the sceptic, regurgitation and skilful manipulation of\ncheese-cloth will not explain all the happenings at the L.S.A. seances. The\nconditions were variable and often informal, but at times the control was\nvery stringent. The medium was completely stripped, searched, and put\ninto a one-piece suit. The trouser legs ended at the bottom in bags which\nenclosed her feet. The hands were enclosed in stiff buckram mittens,\nwhich were sewn to the sleeves of the suit. The opening at the back'\nthrough which the medium entered the garment, was sewn up to the neck.\nOn two occasions a code stitch was used, that is, the stitches were ar-\nranged in a special pattern which would be difficult to imitate. The neck\nband was strong, close-fitting and inelastic.\nThese were the conditions obtaining at the seance on May 12th 1931,\nat which large masses of ectoplasm were seen coming, apparently, from the\nmedium's mouth. Dr Dingwall was allowed to touch the stuff. Albert\nasked if it fek like rubber, but Dr Dingwall said it was warmer and harder\nthan rubber. Another time during the same seance, the cabinet curtains I\nwere parted, and while both Mrs Duncan's hands, enclosed in the buckram\nmittens, were visible to the sitters, a light switch inside the cabinet was\nturned on and off by invisible means. At the end of the sitting the\nstitching on the back of the seance suit was examined and found intact.\nAt a sitting on May 8th 1931, Mrs Duncan was stripped and searched\nas usual. A vaginal examination was performed, and she was put into a\n^ It was this incident which led the L.S.A. to think that Mrs Duncan might be\nregurgitating. Although we have discussed the possibility of regurgitation on a\nmuch larger scale, the L.S.A. is not responsible for the suggestion that Mrs Duncan\nconcealed or regurgitated large masses of ectoplasm on the occasions when yards\nof the material were seen.\n\fPLATE II\n\fPLATE III\nA \" mask and coat-hanger \" type of \" spirit \", produced by Mrs. Duncan in her\nDundee home.

At this sitting, while the medium's\nhands were held by Miss Phillimore and Dr Fielding Ould, there was a\nsound of splashing within the cabinet. Some wax and a bowl of water\nhad been placed there for the purpose of obtaining wax impressions. A\nwax '\nglove '\nwas left behind, but it did not bear any skin markings. At\nthe same sitting, while both the medium's hands were said to be visible.\nMiss Phillimore was held by a third hand, which was wet.\nUnder the conditions described, if regurgitation be the correct explana-\ntion, the medium would have had to add to her cheese-cloth meal a rubber\nglove and probably a collapsible rod as well. (See Plate III.)\nRemarkable feats of rope tying were witnessed at some of the sittings.\nThe most noteworthy incident of this nature took place on Nov. 28th 1930.\nThe medium was stripped and dressed in dark coloured shoes, stockings,\nknickers and coat. She was then lead into the seance room and placed\ninside a net bag, which was tied at the neck and the tape sealed to her\nchair. A length of rope was left lying in the cabinet, and during the course\nof the sitting the medium was found to be securely bound inside the sack\nwithout breaking the seals, the rope being wound tightly round each ankle,\nand a loop carried round her neck, while her wrists were tied together\nbehind her back. It is not suggested that these eifects were necessarily\nparanormal, but if not, they indicate considerable skill and dexterity on the\nmedium's part.\nFurther demonstrations of agility were given on the several occasions\non which the medium was released from her seance-suit and brought out\nnaked. The stitches at the back of the suit looked intact, but on one\noccasion Lord Charles Hope discovered a needle and thread, which the\nmedium might have surreptiously introduced for the purpose of restitching\nthe gap made by her bursting out of the suit.\nOn May 5th 1931, code-stitching was used to sew up the back of the\nmedium's suit. The arms were fastened to her chair with surgical tape,\nbut Albert insisted on this being loosened so -many times that it ceased to\nbe an effective control. At one point on each side of the collar of the\nseance-suit there was sewn the end of a broad band of tape. The other\nends of the tapes were sealed to her chair. The ankles were also sealed\nto the chair with tapes.\nMrs Duncan emerged from all this, leaving the seals apparently intact.\nLater examination revealed that the code stitching at the back of the\ngarment had been undone and sewn up differently. Still the gap would\nhave been too small to let Mrs Duncan out unless the neck fastenings and\nseal had also been undone and replaced in some way. On this occasion\nno needle and thread were found in spite of the allegedly diligent search.\nDuring the course of the same seance, the ectoplasm accidentally caught\non something outside the cabinet. A series of piercing screams, most\ndisconcerting to the investigators, came from the medium in the cabinet.\nAlbert said she was hurt, and after a pause he ordered the sitters to help\nher out of the cabinet. Mrs Duncan was found, as already described,\nfree of her seance-suit and completely naked.\nOn examination, Mrs Duncan was found to have sustained what ap-\npeared to be a burn. Such an appearance might have been produced by\nfriction or other means. In fact, Mrs Duncan had been given a cigarette\n\f38 Donald J. West [Part!\nbefore the burn was noticed, and the injury was just sych a round mark as'\nmight be expected to result from the touch of a hghted cigarette end, but\nif that were the case she must have been wilHng to submit herself to con-\nsiderable pain.\nAfter the last L.S.A. sitting on June 12th, Mr Duncan made a statement\nin which he declared he had come to the conclusion that the '\nectoplasm '\nwas produced by regurgitation.\nTHE HARRY PRICE INVESTIGATION\nWhile the last series of L.S.A. sittings was drawing to a close, Mr Harry\nPrice procured Mrs Duncan's services for five sittings at the National\nLaboratory of Psychical Research.\n^\nThe National Laboratory investigators did not adopt any form of control\nof the medium's person ;\nthey relied entirely upon the rigorous search\nthat was carried out before and after each sitting. Mrs Duncan would\nbe stripped naked and the surface of her body thoroughly explored in the\npresence of several suitable investigators. Vaginal and rectal examinations\nwere performed at two of the sittings. The medium would then be dressed\nin a black one-piece seance-suit, taken to the room, where the sitters\nawaited her, and led directly to her chair in the cabinet.\nSpecial precautions were taken to prevent collusion with Mr Duncan.\nDuring the preliminaries of searching etc., man and wife were in separate\nrooms. In the seance room itself, Mr Duncan was never allowed near the\ncabinet. He was kept at the far back of the room, behind the sitters. The\nlight was fairly good, and it seems absurd to suggest that he could have\nthrown a package to his wife over the heads of the sitters or between their\nlegs.\nCollusion between medium and one or more of the investigators is a\npossibihty always raised by the resolute sceptic, but once a critic has been\nforced into this position, all discussion ends, because it is impossible to\ndrive him further.\nThe National Laboratory seance-suit had trouser legs which enclosed\nthe medium's feet, like the one at the L.S.A. The sleeves ended in mittens,\nwhich were in one piece with the rest of the garment. Unfortunately, this\nsuit was ineffective as a means of control. Mrs Duncan was seen to free\nan arm with the greatest of ease. She could wriggle the arm out of its\nsleeve and then push the hand out at the neck.\nThe theory of regurgitation was once again the key-note of the investi-\ngation. The best evidence for it lies in the flashlight photographs taken\nby Harry Price, which prove conclusively that the ectoplasmic manifesta-\ntions were only cheese-cloth. They show the medium variously adorned\nand draped with a big sheet of the material. The interlacing warp and\nwoof and the selvedge marks are plainly visible. (See Plate II.) There are\nrents and tears and even the marks of folding. One particular tear, iden-\ntified by its size, shape and position, appeared at two seances, proving that\nthe same piece of cheese-cloth was used for both.\n^ See \" Regurgitation and the Duncan Mcdiumship.\" {Bulletin <if the Nat. Lab.\nof Psy. Research, London, 1931.)\n\fI\n172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 39\nI\nThe manifestations were not entirely restricted to crude cheese-cloth,\nbut in all cases the mundane origins of the phenomena were revealed by the\ncamera and stereoscope.\nAt the first seance the conditions were informal. Mrs Duncan was\ndressed in her own seance garments, and a pin was used to fasten them.\nDuring the sitting, a piece of ectoplasm was seen stretched out at right\nangles to the medium, but she moved a little and there was a click. The\nectoplasm fell and both Mrs Goldney and Mr Barry Richards were able to\nsee the pin with which it had been attached to the cabinet curtain.\nA pin appeared in the photographs taken at the third seance, and\nafter the fourth seance a small gilt safety-pin was found concealed in a\ntuck inside the seance suit. Safety-pins had been discovered previously\nby the L.S.A. investigators, so they must be a fairly constant feature of\nthe ectoplasmic machinery.\nAt the third seance, a hand was materialised, but in the photographs it\nwas revealed as a rubber glove. At the fourth seance, Mr Duncan said he\nsaw a materialised face, which he described. The light was too poor for\nthe others to see any face, but the camera showed that there had been a\nflat, cut-out picture of a girl's head, seen in profile and draped in cheese-\ncloth.\nThe investigators concluded that all these objects had been regurgitated.\nThe stomach was the only place that had not been searched. The naso-\npharynx was also suggested, but that would be too small and not very\nsafe. On several occasions at London, doctors examined Mrs Duncan's\nthroat before the sitting. Harry Price thought a secondary stomach or\noesophageal diverticulum might be the solution, but it is difficult to see\nhow such a peculiarity would assist her. Regurgitation from a diverti-\nculum would be even less likely than from a normal stomach. In point of\nfact Mrs Duncan has been given a barium meal and an X-ray taken of her\noesophagus and stomach,^ but no abnormality was seen.\nAt the end of the fourth seance permission was asked for an X-ray of\nher abdomen to be taken. It was thought that some radiologically opaque\nconstituent of her '\nprops '\nmight be detected. Mrs Duncan proved un-\nwilling, becoming restless and finally running out into the street followed\nby her husband. When she was brought back, she then demanded an\nX-ray, but nothing was revealed. Mr Duncan was asked if he would\nsubmit to a search, since his wife had had the opportunity of passing\nsomething to him in the street. He excused himself on the grounds of\ndirty underwear, but later explained that at the time of the seance his\nwife was having a menstrual period and on the way to the laboratory she\nhad passed him a couple of sanitary towels, and the presence of these\nobjects might have been misinterpreted by the investigators. Mrs Goldney\nstated that the medium was not menstruating when she was searched\nbefore the sitting.\nAt the last sitting (the only one at which Mr Duncan was not one of the\nsitters) no cheese-cloth appeared. A few inches of ' ectoplasm '\nprotruded\nfrom the medium's mouth and a small piece was amputated by one of the\ndoctors present. It proved to be layers of lavatory paper stuck together.\nIt is interesting to note that whenever a specimen of ectoplasm was given,\n^ Psychic Science, July 1942, xxi, p. 49.\n\f40 Donald J. West [Part\neither at the L.S.A. or the National Laboratory, it never came from the\nlarge mass of drapery that was the usual manifestation.\nAfter a consultation with Mr Duncan, at which the regurgitation theory\nwas explained to him, it was agreed to hold one more seance and to have\nMrs Duncan fastened to her chair. Before the appointed day arrived,\nMrs Duncan fled to Scotland. Mr Duncan was promised \u00a3iooii he would\ninduce his wife to regurgitate in front of a cinematograph camera, but the\noffer was never taken up.\nIn February 1932, a certain Mary McGinlay, who had been Mrs Duncan's\nmaidservant at the time of the London sittings, contacted Mr Harry Price\nand made a statutory declaration implicating her former mistress in fraudu-\nlent practices. In this document, the maid swears that Mrs Duncan sent\nher out to buy a length of butter muslin, which was returned to her to\nwash after some of the seances. She could even recognise the very same\npiece in Price's photographs ! She also claims to have discovered in Mrs\nDuncan's possession rubber gloves, cut-out pictures from magazines and\nother implements of deception. As confirmation of every single surmise\nof the National Laboratory investigators, this document is very remark-\nable. There is one curious discrepancy. Mary McGinlay implies that\nMrs Duncan deceived her husband with her tricks, whereas there is ample\nevidence in Mr Duncan's behaviour and statements at both the L.S.A.\nand the National Laboratory that he was aware of what was going on.\nMr Mclndoe states that two days after her return to Scotland this same\nservant girl assured him she had never at any time seen anything to suggest\nthat Mrs Duncan was acting fraudulently.\n^\nSo much for the evidence for regurgitation. Though circumstantial, it\nis strong, and is supported by the weak evidence for any other normal\nexplanation. Mrs Duncan is not the only person to have had a reputation\nfor regurgitating powers. A regurgitator of Prague is reported to have\nswallowed and brought up again as many as twenty live frogs.\" Swallowers\nof glass, nails and miscellaneous ironmongery are comparatively common,\nbut they are unable to regurgitate. A demonstration of chewing and\nswallowing (without regurgitation) of an electric light bulb, razor blades, a\ngramophone record and some flowers was given by Mr Arthur Haylock\nat the S.P.R. on May 5th 1944. Regurgitation has also been suggested as\nan explanation of some of the phenomena of Eva C.\nSpiritualist Experiences\nAfter Harry Price's formidable armaments had brought about her retire-\nment into the provinces, Mrs Duncan's career entered a phase which can\nonly be described as a scientific blackout. Shielded by a horde of uncritical\nsympathisers, Mrs Duncan was able to carry on her activities unhindered\nby X-rays, cameras or surgical strapping, with the result that she became\nthe most famous British materialising medium.\nMr J. B. Mclndoe, President of the Spiritualist National Union,\nchampioned Mrs Duncan, proclaiming her a martyr to the cause. She\nbecame more and more prosperous, travelling about and holding sittings\n^Psychic Science, xxi, p. 50.\n-Proc. S.P.R. xxvii, p. 348.\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 41\nin the homes of the faithful all over the country. Stories of her wonders\nwere broadcast far and wide. The sheets of ectoplasm developed into\nfully built-up materialisations, and accounts of spirit recognitions at Duncan\nseances became almost a regular feature in the popular spiritualist weekly\nPsychic News.\nIn November 193 1, Dr Montague Rust, an ardent Duncan supporter,\nwrote to Mrs Goldney, who is an S.P.R. member and who had taken a\nprominent part in the Harry Price sittings. Dr Rust's letter is so typical\nof the claims and attitude of Mrs Duncan's followers that it is worth\nquoting extracts. He writes :\n\" There are very few people who have had the honour of sitting with\nMrs Duncan as often as I have. ... I have had unbounded opportunity\nof examining her and the material and beings whom she '\nregurgitated '.\nIn fact she '\nregurgitated '\nmy brother-in-law, Charles Ross, and my\ndriver, Andrew Barclay, and my dog. Hector. We had long conver-\n^tions with them in their own characteristic voices and varying memories.\nHector was life-like in all his actions and ran about the floor as he did\nin life. Forms came out and sat on some of the sitters' knees and spoke\nand ate apples and drank water. One spirit form removed my boots\nforcibly and put them on and walked about with them.\nMrs Duncan also dematerialised in my presence wholly and partially\nin decent red light. She was also levitated 3 feet off the ground, chair and\nall. ... I have seen a lump of what you call cheese-cloth the size of a\nfootball thrown on the ground with such force that we thought the floor\nwas broken. I have had a rope of this cheese-cloth thrown round my\nneck with such force and rapidity that I was hauled off the chair. I have\nseen a huge form '\nswallowed '\nback by the medium in the fraction of a\nsecond, causing obvious bleeding and injury. ...\"\n\" The theory in Mr Price's books that she regurgitated cheese-cloth\netc. is absolutely preposterous and is the most fantastic theory ever\nbrought forward. If she really can do this, the wonder of her powers is\nfar in excess of any mediumship that I know of. She can make this\ncheese-cloth talk, move like lightning, take different shapes and have\nenormous force.\"\nDr Rust's response to a proposal for further scientific investigation is\nalso typical. He writes :\n\" With hostile people the phenomena won't appear. I doubt very\nmuch whether Mrs Duncan would ever again go through what she had\nto endure in London. Your suggestion of the violent physical exami-\nnation before and after the sittings is out of the question, and there is a\nsimple way out of the difficulty which is much more effective. When I\n'\nhave time I shall make enquiries and see what can be done, if it is at all\npossible and if all the people concerned will allow her.\"\nIt would be possible to fill an enormous tome with illustrations of this\ntype, but a very few more must suffice. The first is taken from a letter\nby Neil Seath in The Tzvo Worlds in December 193 1.\nIt is time that those of us who have had some experience of the\nremarkable manifestations obtained through Mrs Duncan rallied in\ndefence. . . .\n\f42 Donald J. West [Part\n\" The writer, with ten friends, has had the privilege of witnessing\nsome of the materiaHsations. . . . The sitting took place in the home\nof the sitters in a small room measuring 12 feet by 12 feet, illuminated\nby a thirty watt electric red bulb. . . . Mrs Duncan was minutely\nexamined by two ladies well qualified for the task, and was under close\nobservation from the time of the examination until she was brought into\nthe room and placed in the cabinet in full view of everybody. . . .\n\" Albert requested us to observe closely, the amount of teleplasm he\nwould show us, and asked us to use our judgement as to whether even\nMr Harry Price could swallow and regurgitate such an amount of tele-\nplasm as rapidly as it was made to appear and disappear before our\neyes. In my own judgement, the stream of teleplasm would be quite\nten feet long, and fell in several folds at the foot of one of the sitters.\nIt flowed with some rapidity, and disappeared almost instantly, suggesting\nthe swallowing powers of a crocodile. . . .\n\" Amongst other phenomena, Albert told us that he would endeavour\nto show himself standing side by side with his medium. We heard him\nrequest Mrs Duncan to stand up. The curtain was pulled apart, and\nthere in full view of us all stood the tall form of Albert, with Mrs Duncan\n(shorter in stature) standing at his right side. It was a most convincing\nand impressive spectacle.\"\nMr B. Abdy Collins, CLE., I.C.S., an S.P.R. member, has recorded^\nanother instance in which Albert and Mrs Duncan were seen together.\nThis was at Bath in December 1 93 1 , in the presence of Dr Margaret Vivian\nand others, and it is of special interest because an attempt was made to\nphotograph the manifestation. Although the sitters were sure they could\nsee two figures, Mrs Duncan and Albert, the photograph showed only one\nwhite, draped form. This is strongly suggestive of hallucination.\nThe next two illustrations of spiritualist testimony bear witness to how\nextensive is Mrs Duncan's repertoire when in the presence of a favourable\naudience. The first quotation is from some notes by Dr Reid, in the\npossession of Mr Abdy Collins.\n\" Of all the remarkable manifestations which occurred at these Duncan\nsittings\u2014the appearance of spirit lights impressed me most. . . .\n\" At the very next sitting the first thing to happen was the dramatic\nappearance of Albert holding a large luminous disc\u2014about 9 inches\nsquare. It had a dark centre from which a circle of bright rays projected\nfor about two inches into a surround of glowing pearl-like opalescence,\nilluminating Albert's fingers as he slowly moved the object before one\nsitter after another. It came within a foot of my face and seemed to\nhave a solid appearance\u2014then it gradually melted away. At the same\ntime small sparks of light like live flies wandered about the curtains.\nOne of these commenced to enlarge and grow in brilliance and a beauti-\nfully shaped arm and hand projecting from between the curtains was seen\nto be holding it\u2014the fingers, long and tapering, were bathed in its bluish\nglow. Then it, too, slowly faded away.\"\n' \" Mrs Duncan : Enigma,\" (Psychic Science, Jan., 1942, vol. xx, p. 120.)\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 43\nThe next quotation, even more dramatic, is taken from an article by\nMr Mclndoe, one time President of the Spirituahst National Union.\n\" During the sittings Mrs Duncan wore a two-piece black suit pro-\nvided by us, stockings, also black, and her own slippers. These clothes\nshe put on in an adjoining room, in the presence of Dr Hutcheson and\nMrs Drysdale, who made sure that she had no white material of any\nkind, not even a handkerchief, in her possession when they brought her\ninto the seance room. She went immediately into the cabinet, and as\nsoon as she was seated the curtains were closed. . . .\n\" The medium was in trance almost immediately she was seated\n\u2014\nas shown bv her stertorous breathing. Immediately the prayer was over\nAlbert said, '\nDo not sing yet, Mclndoe, I am gqing to show you how\nabsurd this regurgitation theory is.' And there was scorn in his tones\nas he spoke the last three words. '\nFeel her garments, Doctor,' he said\nto Dr Rust, who was seated next the cabinet to the medium's right. Dr\nRust put his hand behind the curtains.\n\" '\nWhat do you mean, Albert? '\nhe said. '\nThat is her black seance\nrobe.'\n\" '\nI know it is,' said Albert. '\nBut I want you to know that she has\nit on. Feel her garments, lady,' to Mrs Drysdale, next to the cabinet at\nthe other side.\n\" '\nYes. I can feel her seance robe all right,' she replied.\n\" '\nNow sing,' said Albert.\n\" Before we had sung more than two or three lines, the curtains were\nparted and some things thrown straight out. They fell on me, sitting\nopposite the curtain opening, not three feet from it.\n\" '\nMrs Duncan's clothes,' I said ; and indeed they were.\n\" Then the curtains were thrown wide open, not by any of the sitters.\nMrs Duncan was standing, one foot on the chair, nude, without even\nher stockings, though still wearing her slippers.\n\" Those who knew Mrs Duncan at all intimately at that time will\nappreciate that she was almost if not quite incapable of putting on her\nown slippers. Certainly, inside the cabinet, she could not have removed\nher rather tight-fitting seance garments, taken olT her slippers and\nstockings, and replaced the slippers in an incredibly short time, without\nthe sitters being aware of her movements. She stood there, in trance,\nwhite material of some sort streaming apparently from her eyes, her nose\nand her mouth. It seemed a white jelly-like substance right up to the\norifices from which it seemed to be flowing. But even more weird and\nfascinating was the spectacle of a liquid spurting from the nipples of her\nbreasts, apparently transparent as it left them, then becoming white' as it\nfell, condensing into threads which somehow seemed to merge into some\nsort of fabric which draped the lower part of her body and hung like a\nkilt down to her knees. The two doctors peered closely at this particular\nphase of the phenomena, describing and commenting on it. After a\nminute or two, the curtains were closed, but were almost immediately\nagain thrown open revealing Mrs Duncan standing erect, facing us,\ncovered from head almost to feet, with a huge expanse of white material,\nlike an immense piece of what might quite reasonably from its appearance\n\f44 Donald J. West [Part\nbe described as cheese-cloth. That material had what appeared to be\nquite substantial hems along its edges. Albert made Mrs Duncan turn\nround so that we could see that the material covered her back also. It\nwas clean whitish material, which seemed to have a faint luminosity of\nits own. There was no offensive odour about it. We watched that for\na minute or two, then the curtains were closed and the seance was over.\"^\nProsecutions\nIn spite of the strength and vigour of her following, Mrs Duncan has\nbeen twice prosecuted and convicted for fraud. The incident which led\nto her first conviction took place in 1933 at a seance in Scotland. The\nspirit of a little girl named Peggy, who is one of Mrs Duncan's regular\ncontrols, materialised and came right out of the cabinet. One of the sitters.\nMiss Maule, made a grab at the figure, saying, \" Come here and let me\nsee what you are made of.\" Miss Maule 's hand caught and ripped some\nmaterial. The lights were switched on and the medium was discovered\ntrying to stuff a torn white u'ndervest up her dress. It was with difficulty\nthat the vest was wrested from the furious Mrs Duncan and produced in\nevidence at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court. She was charged with\n\"... having pretended . . . that she was a medium through whom the spirits\nof deceased persons were openly and regularly materialised. . .\n.\" This\nwas on May 3rd 1933. She was convicted and fined \/^lo. Of course,\nto her supporters, she became a martyr.\nThe events leading to her second conviction were somewhat similar.\nShe was giving sittings at Portsmouth at the house of some spiritualists\nby the name of Homer. The seance room was on top of a drug store run\nby Mr Homer, and was registered as \" The Master Temple Psychic\nCentre \".\nOn January 14th 1944, two young naval officers, Lieutenant Worth and\nSurgeon-Lieutenant Fowler, attended one of these Portsmouth seances.\nThere were about twenty sitters, and Worth and Fowler were placed to-\ngether in the second row. Mrs Duncan's seance clothes were passed\naround for inspection, and two ladies went outside to watch her dress.\nIn the course of the seance, Albert said, \" I have here a lady who passed\nover with some trouble in the lower part of her body.\" Worth was\nprompted to ask, \" Is it for me ?\n\" and Albert answered, \" That's the\nvoice \". Worth repeated several times the formula \" Will you come out,\nplease \", and then he saw a white form appear between the curtains. He\nsaid, \" Are you my aunt ?\n\" and the reply came in a husky whisper, \" Yes \".\nThe figure then retired behind the curtains.^\nLieutenant Worth was disgusted. As far as he knew he had no deceased\naunt. Later in the seance another figure appeared, claiming to be his\nsister ; but his only sister was at that moment alive and well. When he\ndisputed the identity of this figure the control said, \" You don't understand,\nshe was premature \". Worth asserted that his mother had assured him\nthat she had never had a premature child.\n^ Psychic Science, xxi, pp. 46-47.\n^ The Trial of Mrs Duncan, p. 42.\n\ft\n172J The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 45\nWorth got in touch with the Portsmouth pohcc after this sitting, and on\ntheir advice he booked another two seats for a seance on January 19th.\nThis time Worth went in the company of War Reserve Constable Cross,\nincognito, and they sat together in the second row. They allowed two\nmanifestations to come and go unmolested then as the third form appeared\nbetween the curtains, Cross sprang forward, overturning Mr Homer who\nwas sitting in front of him, and made a determined grab. Simultaneously\nWorth switched on a torch. According to their evidence, Mrs Duncan\nwas seen standing in front of the curtains engaged in throwing on to the\nfloor a sheet of flimsy white material, which was draped about her.\nCross grabbed Mrs Duncan with one hand, and the material with the\nother, but the stuff was whisked away from his grasp in the direction of\nthe sitters. Worth's torch was jerked down by a sitter, and by the time\nthe electric light was switched on the white material had disappeared.\nConstable Cross blew his whistle and a band of waiting policemen, led\nby Inspector Ford, entered the room. The place was searched for the\ncloth. The accused sitters clamoured for a search of their persons, but\nthe police, in spite of the presence of a woman member of the force, refused\nto accede to the request, and the cloth, or whatever it was, was never found.\nIf a sheet of slimy, regurgitated cheese-cloth had been found, there could\nhardly be a doubt in anybody's mind about the way the fraud was accom-\nplished. As it was, the exposure was incomplete, and believers can still\nmaintain that the '\nsheet '\nwas a genuine ectoplasmic manifestation, even\nthough it was used to disguise the medium. On this topic Schrenck-\nNotzing has written as follows :\n\" The photograph (of Eva C.) ... is interesting as throwing a light on\nthe genesis of the so-called transfiguration, i.e., in the spiritistic sense, the\nmedium takes upon herself the part of the '\nspirit,' endeavouring to drama-\ntise the character of the person in question, by clothing herself in the\nmaterialised fabrics. This transition stage is found in nearly all materiali-\nsing mediums. The literature of the subject records a large number of\nattempts at the exposure of mediums thus impersonating '\nspirits ', e.g.,\nthat of the medium Bastian by the Crown Prince Rudolph, that of Crooke's\nmedium Miss Cook ; that of Mrs d'Esperance, etc. ... In all these cases\nthe medium was seized, but the fabrics used for masking immediately\ndisappeared, and were not afterwards found.\nOn the basis of the evidence briefly described above, Mrs Duncan, her\ntravelling companion Mrs Brown, and Mr and Mrs Homer were all charged\nwith contravening Section 4 of the Witchcraft Act by conspiring together\nfalsely to pretend that Mrs Duncan could get into communication with\nspirits of the dead. The case was tried at the Old Bailey, before Sir Gerald\nDodson, Recorder of London, and a jury of six men and one woman.\nThe trial began on March 23rd 1944, and lasted over seven full days.\nIt created quite a stir at the time, rivalling the war news in the headlines\nof the daily papers. Mrs Duncan was given a first class defence, financed by\na special spiritualist fund, but it did not succeed in procuring her acquittal.\nAll four defendants w-ere convicted. It was established that Mrs Duncan\nhad received \u00a3112 in six days for seances at Portsmouth, and she was\nsentenced to nine months' imprisonment. Mrs Brown was given four\n^Phenomena of Materialisation, (London, 1923), p. 97.\n\f46 Donald J. West [Part\nmonths, and Mr and Mrs Homer were both bound over for two years.\nThe case was brought before the Lord Chief Justice of England, at the\nCourt of Criminal Appeal, but the verdict was against the appellants.\nIn the course of Mrs Duncan's long defence, a host of witnesses was\ncalled to testify to the genuineness of her materialisations. While most of\nthe testimony was valueless from the psychical researchers' point of view,\nthe narrators being obviously credulous and gullible, some was most\ninteresting.\nJane Rust, a retired municipal midwife, was questioned about the\nPortsmouth seance of January 17th 1944 :\n\" O. Tell my Lord and members of the jury what happened. . . .\nA. . . . the spirit guide announced that there was a gentleman there, and\nhe thought it was for me\u2014an elderly gentleman\u2014and he gave the\ndescription. I said, '\nIs it you. Daddy ?\n'\nmeaning my husband,\nand he said, '\nYes '. I invited him out and said, '\nCome out\ndear', and he came out.\nQ. How far out of the cabinet did he come A. He came on the out-\nside of the curtain. I immediately got up from my seat and went\nright up to him. I said, '\nKiss me, dear '.\nQ. Did you recognize anybody ? A. Of course I recognized him.\nQ. Do not say, '\nOf course ', I want you to tell us. A. I did, sir.\nQ. Who was it ? A. My husband.\n0. Had you any doubt about it being your husband ? A. No doubt\nwhatsoever.\nQ. How close up to him were you ? A. As close as I am to this. (Indi-\ncating the ledge of the witness-box.)\nQ. Did he speak to you ? A. He spoke to me.\nQ. Did you recognise his voice ? A. I did.\nQ. Were you certain of his voice }. A. I was perfectly certain.\nQ. Did he say anything to you in particular that struck you as of impor-\ntance ?\nA. Just spoke about the family. He said that he was always with me,\nand that he would be on the other side waiting for me ; he would\nnever leave me until I joined him.\nQ. The only thing that matters for the purposes of this case is : Are\nyou absolutely certain that it was your husband } A. 1 have never\nbeen more certain of anything in my life before.\nThe Recorder : For how long has he been dead ? A. Five years, my Lord.\nQ. Had he altered in appearance at all ? A. No, sir, he had not altered\n\u2014^just a wee bit thinner, perhaps, than he was in health, but my\nhusband was very ill for three years before he went.\nMr. Loseby : When your husband showed himself to you, was he as he\nwas\u2014I do not know the answer to this\u2014before, or shortly before,\nhe died ? A. No, he was the same as he was probably a year or\ntwo before he died.\nQ. Were you allowed to touch him ? A. 1 asked him to kiss me.\nQ. Did he kiss you ? A. He said, '\nPut your hand in mine, dear ', so I\ngave him my right hand. He took hold of it with his right and\nclasped my hand very tightly.\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 47\nThe Recorder : It was flesh and blood, was it ? A. It was very cold, my\nLord, but it was his hand.\nO. You could hold it, could you ? A. I held it firmly. I felt the\nknuckles. He suffered from rheumatism, my Lord, and I felt the\nnobbly knuckles.\nMr Loseby : We must face up to things. Nurse Rust. Are you quite sure\nthat it was not Mrs Duncan ? A. Oh, perfectly certain, perfectly\nsure. My husband is not quite so big ; he is not such a stout man.\nQ. You said you asked your husband to kiss you. A. I did, sir.\nQ. Did he kiss you ? A. He did, sir, right on the mouth.\nThis witness went on to state that at the same seance her mother mani-\nfested and was recognised on close inspection by two moles, one in the\nhollow of her chin and one above her left eyebrow, which were reproduced\ntrue to life. Then an Aunt Mary came and spoke in Spanish, saying,\n\" I am very pleased to see you. I wanted to come before, but they did not\nunderstand.\"\nThis evidence is extraordinary. Granting its veracity, either the witness\nmust have been hallucinated and deluded to an astonishing degree or else\nthe phenomena were genuine. It is all the more puzzling, since Mrs Rust\nappeared to be a level-headed and honest narrator.\nMr. Abdy Collins has pointed out that although Mrs Rust stated in her\nevidence that she was present at the seance on January 19th, when Constable\nCross seized Mrs Duncan, she is not shown as present in the oflicial plan\nof the disposition of sitters at that seance.\nAnother interesting witness was Dr John Winning, Assistant Medical\nOfficer of Health of Glasgow, who said he had witnessed upwards of four\nhundred materialisations at Duncan seances, many of them in his own\nrooms at Glasgow. He had heard voices speak in a number of different\ndialects and languages. He had clearly recognized a dozen materialised\nrelatives.\nAt the request of this Society, Dr Winning was later interviewed by\nLady Ruth Balfour, who has a medical degree and is a member of the\nS.P.R. Dr Winning appeared to her to be an ardent believer in Duncan\nphenomena, and who considered it an insult to question her genuineness.\nHe had taken photographs of some of the manifestations, and these he\nshowed to Lady Ruth, stressing his view that no photograph could be\njudged genuine or otherwise until one took into consideration the condition\nof the sitting at which it was taken. One of the photographs depicted a\ntall figure, shrouded from head to foot in white drapery. The features\nwere indistinct, the lower half being covered by some black stuff represent-\ning a beard.- The rest of the photographs were similar to those taken\nby Harry Price years previously. Dr Winning stated he was hoping to\nobtain some time a photograph showing Mrs Duncan and a spirit form on\nthe same photograph but entirely separate from each other.\n^ Op. cit., pp. 171-1J2.\n^ I have seen this photograph and have no hesitation in saying that it shows\nevery sign of fraud. It might well be Mrs Duncan wrapped in a sheet. The\nappearance of height is given by drawing the sheet high up round the neck. One\nshoulder only is in view, and it might be artificially raised by Mrs Duncan's hand\nbeneath the sheet.\u2014D.J.W.\n\f48 Donald J. West [Part\nIt would be possible to go on quoting this sort of testimony to the crack\nof doom, but we might be no nearer a conclusion at the end. It is im-\npossible to come to a decision on Mrs Duncan without first deciding what\nweight to attach to human testimony to physical phenomena. This is the\nsubject of the next section. It will suffice for the moment to cite the words\nof Professor H. H. Furness of the Seybert Commission on Spiritualism.\nThey are very pertinent to the present issue.\n\" Again and again have I asked those who have returned, from an inter-\nview with a spirit at the cabinet, to their seats beside me, whether or not\nthey had recognised their friends beyond a peradventure, and have always\nreceived an affirmative reply, sometimes strongly affirmative. I was once\ntaken to the cabinet by a woman and introduced to the Shade of her dead\nhusband. When we resumed our seats, I could not help asking her :\n'\nAre you sure you recognised him ?\n'\nWhereupon she instantly retorted,\nwith much indignation, '\nDo you mean to imply that I don't know my\nhusband ?\n'\nAgain, at another seance, a woman, a visitor, led from the\ncabinet to me a materialised spirit, whom she introduced to me as '\nher\ndaughter, her dear, darling daughter,' while nothing could be clearer to\nme than the features of the medium in every line and lineament. Again\nand again, men have led round the circles the materialised spirits of their\nwives, and introduced them to each visitor in turn ; fathers have taken\nround their daughters, and I have seen widows sob in the arms of their\ndead husbands. Testimony, such as this staggers me. Have I been\nsmitten with colour-blindness } Before me, as far as I can detect, stands\nthe very medium herself, in shape, size, form, and feature true to a line,\nand yet, one after another, honest men and women at my side, within ten\nminutes of each other assert that she is the absolute counterpart of their\nnearest and dearest friends, nay, that she is that friend. It is as incompre-\nhensible to me as the assertion that the heavens are green, and the leaves\nof the trees deep blue. ...\"\n\" In any statement of this problem we should bear in mind all the attend-\ning circumstances : the darkened room ; the music ; the singing ; the\npervading hush of expectation ; the intensely concentrated attention ; the\nstrained gaze at the dark cabinet and at its white-robed apparitions ; and\nfinally, the presence of a number of sympathising believers.\"^\nAt the Duncan trial, emphasis was laid on the way nearly all the spirits\n'\ndematerialised '\nby sinking to the floor. In this connection also Professor\nFurness' remarks are still topical.\n\" Not infrequently a materialised spirit is seen to subside into the floor\nbetween the folds of the curtain at the opening of the cabinet. This is\ntermed '\nde-materialisation ', and not a little mystery is ascribed to it.\nThe mystery vanishes when we reflect how easy it is for a lithe and active\nyoung woman so to bow down quickly, even to the very ground, as to\nconvey the impression, when her white garments are alone visible against\na black background, that she has sunk into the floor. I have at times\ndistinctly felt the faint jar caused by the medium's falling backward within\nthe dark curtains a little too hastily. At times, when the spirit is wholly\nwithin the cabinet, and visible only through the parted folds of the curtain,\n^ Preliminary Report of the Commission appointed by the University of Pennsylvania,\netc., (Philadelphia, 1887), p. 150.\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 49\nthe semhlancf of a gradual sinking is obtained by simply uniting slowly the\ntwo folds of the black curtains, beginning at the head and gradually closing\nthem down to the feet ; the room is generally so dark that the dark curtain\nis indistinguishable at a little distance, and the effect of slowly falling is\nadmirably conveyed.\"^\nScepticism is certainly justified. It is hard to conceive the cheese-cloth\nphenomena and the re-stitching of the seance garment as due to super-\nnormal agency. It is possible that the Duncan phenomena are only partly\nfraudulent, but that hypothesis is, prima facie, less likely than that they are\nall fraudulent, and there is the difficulty of how the medium knows when\nto prepare for fraud and when to expect the real thing.\nOn the other hand, if Mrs Duncan is never genuine, one has to go to\nfantastic lengths to account for all that has been observed by investigators.\nHer powers of swallowing and regurgitation must be nothing short of\nmiraculous, and her powers of manipulation in the dark must be almost as\nextraordinary, including sewing in the dark and breaking out of seals and\ntapes without leaving any trace of damage.\nAnother possibility is that the miracle lies in the sitters and investigators,\nwho, once across the \" enchanted boundary \", cease to observe and record\ncorrectly. Only laboratory investigation with automatic recording instru-\nments can hope to settle the question. Perhaps even now Mrs Duncan\nmight be induced to sit for properly equipped investigators, this time for\nthe production of full blown spirit forms and not just cheese-cloth drapery.\nAs soon as she was released from prison, Mrs Duncan recommenced her\nmediumistic activities. She refused to allow the Spiritualist National\nUnion to take charge of her sittings and they withdrew the diploma they\nhad granted her. It is reported that since then she has resorted to\nadvertising her wares on sandwich-boards on Blackpool Promenade. Her\nrecent seances are much inferior to what she used to do in her prime. Mrs\nDuncan's ultimate fate is a matter for speculation.\nAn Enigmatic Personality.\nLaying aside for the moment the question of whether Helen Duncan, or\nindeed any other physical medium, has ever produced genuine phenomena,\nwe are left with the indisputable conclusion that she resorts on occasions\nto conscious, carefully premeditated fraud. Some of the frauds were very\nskilfully executed : the manipulation of the cheese-cloth phantoms and\nrubber gloves, the tying up with ropes and the escape from sealed seance\ngarments were all very cleverly accomplished. Mrs Duncan must be a\nfirst class artist to be able to deceive so many people for so long by these\nmethods.\nIt is difficult to reconcile this obvious skill in the art of deception with\nsome of the very crude methods of fraud sometimes used. One finds it\nimpossible to understand why she should have foisted specimens of fake\nectoplasm upon investigators who were sure to expose it, while at the same\ntime she was producing absolutely baffling phenomena, which, if fraudulent,\n1 Ibid. pp. 152-153-\nD\n\f5\u00b0 DomildJ. West [Part\nmust have required infinitely more subtle methods of deception. The\nspecimens of loaded urine, also, were utterly incongruous.\nMrs Duncan has a convincingly innocent air. People who have associated\nwith her a long time, and have come to believe they know her intimately,\ndeclare her to have the appearance of a simple, truthful, honest woman.\nIn short, Mrs Duncan is extremely clever and cunning. (The same cannot\nbe said of her husband, who cheerfully asserts that his wife is fraudulent\nor genuine as the occasion suits him.) But there are features in Mrs\nDuncan's personality that strike one as out of place in an accomplished\ncharlatan.\nIn appearance, Mrs Duncan is far from prepossessing, being very fat\nand coarse-looking with a deep red face. In speech, she has a pronounced\nScottish accent, but this is not shared by Albert. One of her most ardent\nsupporters describes her thus :\n\" She was in a brown tight-fitting dress ... a large, obese, ungainly\nwoman, who moved slowly as though she suifered from heart-troujjle or\nglandular affection and had not to hurry. She had by no means a magnetic\npersonality . . . rather a repellent one that aroused one's critical faculties.\"^\nVery far removed indeed is Mrs Duncan from her compatriot D. D.\nHome, the versatile and mysterious artist, who moved so urbanely midst\nthe glitter and intrigue of the now extinct courts of Russia, Germany and\nFrance. Different too from Margery Crandon, the charming and vivacious\nAmerican who mystified the scientists of a later day.\nMrs Duncan has no glamour. Put on the spot, she is apt to seek refuge\nin the crudest form.s of hysteria as on the occasion when she was confronted\nby Harry Price's formidable X-ray apparatus. She fled into the street,\nclad in her one-piece seance suit, and clung to some railings, screaming\nobscenities at the investigators and narrowly escaping arrest.\nThe scene must have been ludicrous indeed. A London street. In the\ncentre, a group of eminently respectable investigators and specialists, their\nevening dress contrasting strangely with Mrs Duncan's informality of\nlanguage and attire. To complete the picture, a phlegmatic London\nconstable, expostulating mildly, and greatly increasing the gentlemen's\nanxiety for their reputations.\nWhen the L.S.A. came to the conclusion that she was a fraud, Mrs\nDuncan indulged in what her doctor described as \" an hysterical histrionic\nperformance \", namely swallowing half a bottle of Eusol. She was visited\nby representatives of the L.S.A., who were received at her bedside with\ncries, screams and threats. Although they had treated her from first to\nlast with the utmost consideration and generosity, Mrs Duncan lost no\ntime in spreading stories of how they had maltreated her.\nMrs Duncan's temper in difficult situations was never of the best.\nWhen she was exposed at Edinburgh, she used words that were repeated\nin evidence against her twenty-one years later.\n\" A. C. West (Chief Constable, Portsmouth) : I am coming to this point\nwhere she uses blasphemy. When she was challenged\nshe said to Miss Maule :\n'\nI will brain you, you\nbloody bugger.'\n''Psychic Science, April, 1944, xxiii, p. 17.\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 51\n\" The Recorder : That was in 1933 ? Have there been any complamts\nsince ?\n\" West : Not as far as I am aware. I cannot rtnd any redeeming feature\nin her character.\"^\nIt is extremely difficuk to reconcile all this with the high leve l of intelli-\ngence and resourcefulness that she must have required for some of her\nfrauds. It has been suggested that Mrs Duncan is possessed of a secondary\npersonality, which is responsible for all her mediumistic operations. The\ndifficulty with this explanation is that Mrs Duncan would have to prepare\nher frauds, go out and buy cheese-cloth, etc., before the sitting, while she\nis presumably her normal self and not under the control of any secondary\npersonality. A more likely explanation v. ould seem to be that her persona-\nlity is subject to some degree of dissociation at all times, but that at her\nseances it is so extreme that her whole character may change from, that of\nan ordinary, dull, rather clumsy woman, to a very deft and resourceful\ncheat.\nThe truth is that Mrs Duncan is an unsolved riddle, and likelv to remain\nso until we know more about physical mediums.\n\/\/ THE TRIAL OF MRS DUNCAN AS A STUDY LN HUMAN\nTESTIMONY.\nThe Duncan case is a mass of irreconcilable contradictions. An appar-\nently sane and reliable witness comes along with a tale of miracles that\nmakes the mind boggle, and the next moment another witness is giving\nevidence of crude and common fraud. No impartial judge would pretend\nto know who or what to believe.\nFor this reason, Mrs Duncan, like all other physical mediums of any note,\nis an inscrutable enigma. Margery\u2014after various impudent protestations\nof injured innocence\u2014passed on to join her spirit friends, taking many of\nher secrets with her. Home also succeeded in carrying his cherished\nmysteries safely to the grave, leaving behind several volumes of supercilious\nmemoirs, which, like the sphinx, remain to mock us for all time.\nMrs Duncan is unlikely to go down to posterity in the same way, but\nshe too can afford to laugh. The fact that she has been able to pursue\nher lucrative vocation almost undisturbed for so many years, in supreme\nindifference to the thoughts or opinions of psychical researchers, is just\nas much a mockery of our futile attempts at investigation as the smug\nreminiscences of D. D. Home.\nThe day of reckoning will come. When sufficient money and enterprise\nare devoted to the subject, all the methods of modern instrumental controls,\nincluding infra-red cinephotography, will be applied to the investigation\nof physical phenomena. The phenomena will be lifted out of the atmo-\nsphere of perpetual darkness and emotional stress, and examined in the\ncalm dispassionate light of day. Then there will be no more question of\ngenuineness. If materialisation be true, the process will be seen and\nfollowed. If the whole thing be deception, materialisation will never be\nheard of again.\n^ The Trial of A'Irs Duncan, p. 337.\n\f52 Donald J. West [Pari\nWhen this goal is reached, either of two things may happen. If fraud\nbe exposed, present day critics wiU be lauded as right-minded resisters\nof gross ignorance and superstition. If materialisation be vindicated,\nthe doubting Thomases will acquire a reputation akin to that of thei\nSpanish Inquisitors. Those who have sat on the fence will be blamed inj\neither event.\nUntil that happy time arrives, we have to depend upon the narrativesi\nof witnesses, so that the degree of accuracy and reliability to be expected\nfrom human testimony becomes a problem of immediate importance. It\nis not an easy problem, since concrete assessable facts are hard to come by\nand a priori opinions differ widely.\nIn this, as in all other psychological topics, we are apt to run into\nmembers of the school of inveterate misanthropists. According to these\nexperts in the dregs of human nature, altruism is a myth, and behind the\nscenes we are all slaves to the compelling impulses of crude, selfish and\namoral animal instincts. Extending this conception to human testi-\nmony, they would naturally say that truth and reason in witnesses' state-\nments are only an outward fa9ade, a superficial veneer ; that in fact we\nsee, hear and testify only to that which satisfies our instinctive predilections.\nTruthfulness is reduced to the minimum necessary to maintain an appear-\nance of consistency and plausibility. Moreover, in twisting facts to suit\ntheir emotional preconceptions, witnesses may be completely unaware of\nany deviation from the truth.\nIn ordinary matters these ideas might be safely rejected as far-fetched\nfancies, but in the world of psychical research they are only too readily\napplicable. A witness at a law court, giving an account of some familiar\ndomestic happening, knows he will not be believed if he says something\nhighly improbable ; but in describing a \" psychic \" phenomenon the\nsame witness might almost swear that the moon fell down and still be\nbelieved by some people. The temptation to the subconscious, or what-\never part of the personality is responsible for misstatements and fabrications,\nmust sometimes be irresistible.\nIn the observation of everyday affairs that have no special emotional\nsignificance, the witness is on familiar ground, with all his wits about him\nand his senses alert. The scope for illusion, delusion and hallucination\nis relatively slight.\nVery diff erently situated is the witness at a seance for physical phenomena.\nVision is obscured by darkness and the shadow of curtains. Hearing is\ndulled by the monotonous discord of the sitters' vocal efforts. The sense\nof touch is eliminated, as the sitter is not allowed to move about or feel\nthe manifestations. At the same time the atmosphere is tense and sug-\ngestive, pregnant with the expectation of imminent miracles. Excitement\nreaches its peak with the appearance of a spirit form, said to be the living,\ntangible re-materialisation of some long decayed, worm-eaten corpse.\nRecognition of features under such conditions is a risky business. While\nwaiting out of doors for the arrival of a friend, most people will have had\nthe experience of recognising in some approaching stranger the familiar\nform of the expected individual, only to be disappointed on closer inspec-\ntion. More serious mistakes have been made by witnesses attempting to\nidentify police suspects. If errors of recognition are liable to occur under\n\f172] ,\nThe Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan S3\n:hese circumstances, they must be infinitely more common under the\n;onditions of the dark seance. The relative insensibility of the fovea in-\njemi-darkness makes recognition peculiarly uncertain.\nHaving followed these general arguments, the reader may be in a better\nposition to consider some of the direct positive evidence of extensive\ndelusion, gross inaccuracy of observation and amazing lapses of memory\nDn the part of the sitters.\nAn early experimental investigation was undertaken by the S.P.R. in\n1886, with the cooperation of Mr S. J. Davey, a slate-writing conjurer.\nDavey gave seances for \" spirit writing \" in every way similar to those of\nEglinton and other mediums of the day. Some of the sitters were informed\n:hat the performances were conjuring tricks, others were under the\n.mpression that they were genuine spiritistic phenomena.\nThe sitters were asked to write careful reports shortly after each session,\nwhile the incidents were still fresh in their memory. Their accounts were\nfound to contradict each other on many vital points, and some of the\nwriters had no doubt but that the phenomena were genuine. Davey and\nRichard Hodgson, who knew the secrets of the tricks employed, were able\nto expose the mistakes and inaccuracies that had led the sitters astray.\nGross errors in the appreciation of time intervals were evident, and\ndeceptive expressions such as \" immediately \" and \" hardly a moment \"\nled to some of the worst faux pas. Failure to remember unobtrusive\n'\nassistance \" by the conjurer in the arrangement of the slates was a very\ncommon fault ; but there is no necessity to quote Dr Hodgson's detailed\nanalysis of all the errors in the accounts of these mock seances, because\nanyone interested can read the full report in our Proceedings}\nA somewhat similar investigation was carried out by Besterman in 1931.^\nA dummy seance was held, but without a conjurer and with all the sitters\nwell aware that the proceedings were only for the purpose of testing their\npowers of observation. A lady was posted in front of a curtained cabinet\nto represent the medium. There was a table bearing miscellaneous seance-\nroom paraphernalia, including a trumpet and a hand-bell. Forty-two\n3.P.R. members took part as sitters.\nBesterman went through a prearranged routine, brightening and dimming\nthe lights, switching on a flashlight, answering a knock at the door, turning\n1 gramophone on and off and so on. When he had finished, the sitters\nwere asked to answer a questionnaire relating to what they had just seen.\nThirteen sitters were discovered to be the subjects of illusions or halluci-\nnations. Three of them reported non-existent movements of the table.\nOne referred to a candle that was not present. Tw'o sitters described the\n\u2022\nhand-bell as a glass of water. Faults of omission were very common.\n'\nOnly four people were able to describe correctly the incident in which\niBesterman opened the door in answer to a knock and then came back into\nthe room putting a white card in his pocket.\nAs Denys Parsons so aptly remarks in his excellent little article Truth\nand Testimony,^ \" It must be emphasised that these marked defects of\nobservation and memory, and the illusions, took place on occasions when\n^ Proc.

West [Part\nthere was no suggestive atmosphere, no emotional stress, and when every\nsitter was on the qui vive in expectation of the questionnaire. How much\nrehance then are we to place on the statements of emotionally tense persons\nsitting in dim light, in an atmosphere of religious fervour, and actuated by\nthe powerful desire to get in touch with their departed relatives ?\n\"\nAt actual seances delusion and deception reach an incredible peak.\nAnyone who doubts it should read the book. Revelations of a Spirit\nMedium} An ex-medium describes how he purchased a wire-gauze\nmask, behind which he put a luminous handkerchief, so that a luminous\nface was presented. \" That wire mask has been recognised by dozens\nas fathers, mothers, brothers, cousins, sweethearts, wives, husbands ...\"\nThere is another book, the authenticity of which is not quite so certain,\nentitled \" Confessions of a Medium.\"- The author recounts how he was\nfirst deceived and then taken into partnership by a famous materialising\nmedium. The reader is made to realise the ease with which the public\ncan be gulled, to understand the methods employed and to appreciate the\nthrill that is experienced in applying them. Not least important among the\npsychological tricks is the adoption of a false air of stupidity or simphcity.\nComing now to the Duncan trial, it is only to be expected that witnesses\nshould disagree and contradict each other. None the less, it is worth\ntracing some of the details of the divergencies, because this is a method of\nmaking a rough estimate of the reliability of such evidence.\nIt will be remembered that interest centred on two seances, on January\n14th and January 19th 1944 respectively, which were attended by Lieu-\ntenant Worth.\nFirst, as to how much light there was and how distinctly the figures\ncould be seen. According to Worth, white forms could be discerned\nbetween the cabinet curtains, but the features were invisible. There was\nonly a dark patch apparently cut away in the material which corresponded\nto a face (p. 41).^\nMrs Jennings said the room was very dark and nothing could be seen\nplainly. At all the various manifestations on January 14th, she saw no\nfeatures whatever (p. 97).\nWorth's aunt was supposed to have materialised at this seance, and\nseveral witnesses described her as a little old lady ; but Worth said, \" I\ndefy anyone to say that she was a little old lady, because it was so dark\nyou could hardly see anything at all \"\n(p. 61).\nWorth was flatly contradicted by Wing Commander Mackie and Mrs\nCole, both of whom were present on January 14th. Mrs Cole said the\nlight was sufficient to see quite plainly, and everyone in the room could\nsee everyone else (p. 157). Mackie claimed he could recognise the faces\nof the materialisations at a distance of three or four feet. On the 14th of\nJanuary he recognised his brother, even to the tan on the face. When\ngiving this evidence, Mackie remarked, \" I know what ridicule there is\nfor all these things and I know how my brother officers are going to respond\nto this, but I want to have my say \"\n(p. 144).\n^ Edited by H. Price and E. J. Dingwall, (London, 1922).\n2 Griffith, London, 1882. The author is Chapman. The medium '\nThompson '\nis Firman.\n= The page references are to the book The Trial of Mrs Duncan.\n\fij2] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 55\nMr Homer explained that the seance room was illuminated by a 40 watt\nred lamp covered with a red silk handkerchief (p. 124). '\nHe claimed that\nat three feet distance he could see clearly. Albert's beard would be visible\nfrom the second row of seats, some five feet from the cabinet (p. 134).-\nConstable Cross, present on January 19th, said the materialised forms\nwere just a white blur (p. 100).\nMr Gill, questioned about the seance of January 19th, said he could see\nthe face of the member of the audience next but one to him on the same\nrow of seats, but further than that was not clear (p. 150).\nMrs Alabaster, present on January 19th, said she could recognise faces\nat the opposite side of the room (p. 163).\nNurse Rust, also present on the 19th, explained that one ought to get\ntwo feet or nearer to the figures to recognise them and see every detai\nclearly (p. 178).\nIn view of the great differences in individual adaption to semi-darkness,\nthe different statements as to how much could be seen is not very good\nevidence for conflicting testimony. However, it is very significant that\nin the present case the degree of brightness alleged is almost an index of\nbelief, varving from the complete scepticism of Lieutenant Worth, who\nsaid that hardly anything could be seen, to the faith of Mrs Cole, to whom\neverything in the room was plainly visible.\nOne of the highlights of the prosecution was the materialisation of some\nbogus relatives for Lieutenant Worth on January 14th. The episode\nbegan by Albert announcing that there was a lady present who had passed\nover with some trouble in the bowels. Mrs Homer prompted Worth to\nask, \" Is it for me ?\n\" Albert replied, \" That's the voice \", and the figure\nforthwith made its appearance between the curtains.\nAccording to Worth, it was a bulky form shrouded in white right down\nto the ground (p. 42). Urged to speak up, he asked, \" Are you my aunt ?\n\"\nThe figure said \" Yes \", although Lieutenant Worth's aunts were all living.\nThe supposed aunt immediately retired behind the curtains. That was\nall that was said and nothing more could be seen.\nHomer's testimony was completely different. He described V\/orth's\naunt as a slim old lady, about 5 ft. i in. in height, who came some three\nor four feet from the cabinet. Her features could be seen clearly. She\nhad a very old face with a pointed chin and her hair was greying (p. 127).\nWorth, according to Homer, asked, \" Are you an aunt of mine }\n\" The\n\u2022old lady replied, \" Trying to act strange, are you not ?\n\" She then disap-\npeared down through the floor and not behind the curtain (p. 128). When\nshe had gone Albert said, \" I have a sailor boy here \". \"I know no\nsailor\n'\n'\nWorth replied. There was no materialisation and Albert reminded\nWorth that there was no rank and file in the spirit world. This remark\nwas taken as a rebuke to Worth for being too proud to acknovdedge a\ncommon sailor.\nWorth denied the incident about the sailor (p. 60), but all the defence\nwitnesses who were questioned on the point remembered it and confirmed\nHomer's account. They included Wing Commander Mackie (p. 145),\nMrs Cole (p. 156), Mrs Taylor (p. 181), Mrs Tremlett (p. 188), and Mrs\nJopling (p. 195).\nMrs Cole's evidence as to the aunt agreed with Homer's and contradicted\n\f56 Donald J. West [Part i\nWorth's. She claimed that the figure came right out of the cabinet, looked i\nWorth in the face and said, \" Trying to be strange \"\n(p. 156).\nMrs Irene Taylor described the figure as an oldish lady, rather thin and i\nbent, with long features, who came out of the cabinet and peered right into\nWorth's face (p. 181).\nMrs Tremlett asserted that a woman came out of the cabinet and Worth\nasked if she were his aunt. She replied, \" You are acting strangely \". I\nThen she just disappeared from where she was standing, right away from\nthe cabinet (p. 188).\nMrs Jopling also remembered the aunt who had said, \" You are acting\nstrangely, are you not ?\n\" The figure then sank to the floor. She had not j\ncome very far from the curtains (p. 195). I\nOn the question of Worth's aunt, the believers were in agreement with\neach other and in unanimous opposition to Worth. This might be simply\na case of lying by one or both sides, but that need not necessarily be the\nexplanation. It seems highly probable that what is seen and remembered\nof these seances depends on what one believes to start with, in which case\nwitnesses could be perfectly honest and still contradict each other. All the\nsame, if nothing of the kind had occurred, it is strange that several witnesses\nshould all see the form of an old lady come out and peer into Worth's face.\nIt is also odd that witnesses should agree in ascribing the same, or almost ,\nthe same remark to the alleged spirit. j\nWorth maintained that after the aunt had gone Albert said, \" Here is a |\ngentleman who passed away with some trouble to his chest \". A white\nshrouded figure with no describable lines about it then appeared before the\ncurtams. Not knowing what to say he asked, \" Are you my uncle }\n\"\nThe voice replied, \" Yes.\" The figure gave a nondescript salute and\ndisappeared (p. 42).\nNone of the defence witnesses remembered Worth's alleged uncle. Both\nHomer and Mrs Tremlett denied all knowledge of the incident, although\nthey were able to give a full account of Worth's other communicators\n(pp. 127, 192). Neither Mrs Taylor nor Mrs Jopling mentioned Worth's\nuncle in their accounts of his communicators.\nThe next manifestation began with Albert saying, \" I have here for the\nsame gentleman his sister \" ; Worth said, \" I have no sister \", and the\nvoice rephed, \" Perhaps you don't understand, but she was premature.\"\nWorth said he was quite sure there were no premature children in his\nfamily, but the voice answered, \" You can ask the question \". No form\n'\nmaterialised.\nFor a wonder, all the other witnesses are in agreement with Worth as to\nthe general substance of this verbal exchange, which rather suggests that\nhearing is less readily deceived than sight.\nAhhough a great deal of attention was paid to Worth's experiences on\nJanuary 14th, the real crux of the case against Mrs Duncan lay in the alleged I\nexposure of January 19th. At _the seance on this date. War Reserve I\nConstable Cross was sitting next' to Lieutenant Worth in the second row\nof seats. The seance was not allowed to continue for long. When the\nthird form appeared, Cross jumped out of his seat and made a grab at it.\nAccording to Cross' own description of what took place, he overturned\nthe chair in front of him, on which Mr Homer was sitting, and sprang\n'\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helot Duncan 57\nforwards. Simultaneously Worth switched on a torch, exposing Mrs\nDuncan standing between the curtains in the act of hurriedly trying to\npush a piece of white material, which was draped in front of her, down to\nthe floor. When he reached Mrs Duncan, Cross seized her by the arms.\nShe stepped a little to one side, and Cross, still holding her with his right\nhand, bent down and grasped the white material with his left hand. It\nfelt flimsy, like butter-muslin. He grasped it for a moment, and then it\nwas pulled out of his grasp in the direction of the left of the front row of\nthe audience (pp. loo-ioi).\nCross stood up again, pulled the curtains apart and exposed the empty\ncabinet. Mrs Duncan was then seated in a chair outside the cabinet (p. 105).\nWorth corroborated Cross' testimony. He too had seen the standing\nfigure of Mrs Duncan trying to dispose of the cloth. Someone in the\naudience tried ineffectually to knock his torch away. As he redirected it\non to the scene, someone in the front row was pulling the cloth out of the\nconstable's grasp. Cross cried, \" Did you get the cloth ?\n\" \" No, it has\ngone into the audience \", repHed Worth. \" Of course it has gone, it had\nto go somewhere \", commented the enigmatical Mrs Duncan (pp. 53, 67).\nMrs Duncan was standing in her bare feet. She bent down and put on\nher shoes, which were on the floor behind her, and then sat down.\nAccording to Homer, a brilliant torch suddenly shone upon the \" spirit\nfriend \" who had materialised in the centre of the cabinet. The next\nmoment he was knocked off his chair and fell sprawling on the floor, from\nwhich vantage point the exciting events higher up were lost to him. By\nthe time Homer got back to another seat, Mrs Duncan was sitting on an\nupturried chair outside the cabinet. Constable Cross was very nervous\nand agitated. He glared and said, \" Sit down. Homer \", when Homer\nmade to go to Mrs Duncan's assistance (p. 131).\nMr Gill, who was sitting on Homer's left, said that Cross dived forwards,\nclawed the curtains and fell through into the cabinet on top of Mrs Duncan,\nwho could be seen sitting in her chair. The spirit form vanished down\nthrough the floor as Cross came forward. Cross got up and pulled Mrs\nDuncan out of her chair into the room. (No mean feat in view of their\nrespective sizes.) He seemed scared (p. 148).\nMrs Gill, who sat on Homer's right, said that a boy materialised and\ncame out of the cabinet. He then disappeared, all but a small piece of\nectoplasm about the size of a pocket handkerchief to be seen on the floor.\nThe next thing. Constable Cross leapt forward. Thinking he was ill and\nwanted to get out, Mrs Gill took hold of his arm, but he went straight on,\nclinging at the curtains and sprawling over Mrs Duncan. He could be\nseen with legs stretched out, one on either side of Mrs Duncan who was\nsitting in the cabinet. Mrs Gill cried out, \" Oh, don't do it \", and rushed\ninto the cabinet after the policeman, throwing her arms round his waist.\nShe then felt that they had all stood up and taken a turn, and she found\nherself holding Mrs Duncan, who was on an upturned chair, outside the\ncabinet (p. 152).\nThis evidence is curious. Mr Gill mentioned that his wife had grabbed\nhold of Cross as he sprang forwards, but neither he nor any of the other\nwitnesses mentions anything about seeing her on top of the pile of bodies\nin the cabinet.\n\f58 Donald J. West [Part\nMrs Alabaster, next but one on Homer's left, saw a man rush forward\nand make a grab at a disappearing spirit form. She heard the curtains\ndrawn apart, and looking into the cabinet she saw Mrs Duncan lolling in\nher chair. This statement seems entirely contrary to the evidence stating\nthat Cross fell straight through the curtains on top of the medium. Mrs\nAlabaster went on to say that Cross pulled at Mrs Duncan's chair. There\nwas a scuffle, and at the end of it Mrs Duncan was sitting outside the\ncabinet on an upturned chair with one shoe off.\nMr Coulcher, who sat at the end of the row on Mrs Alabaster's left,\nsaw Cross dart out and claw at the curtains. The spirit form vanished\ninstantly down through the floor. A light was flashed and the next moment\nMrs Duncan was outside the cabinet on an upturned chair with one shoe\noff (p. 167).\nNurse Rust saw Cross jump out on to a spirit form which vanished\nthrough the floor. There was nothing left to grasp and Cross clutched\nat the curtains and fell through into the cabinet. Mrs Duncan's chair\nwas dragged away from the corner, and she was found sitting with one\nshoe off just within the cabinet. This is the only witness who said that\nMrs Duncan was still in the cabinet.\nOnce again we find two schools, prosecution and defence, diametrically\nopposed to each other. Unfortunately this is a common feature of court\ncases, and need not be due to the allegedly psychic nature of the events.\nIt will be noted that the prosecution maintains a high degree of self-\nconsistency, whereas the defence witnesses flounder somewhat. However,\nwe know that considerable confusion is only to be expected of genuine\nwitnesses at Duncan phenomena.\nAt the seance of January 14th, which ran its course undisturbed, there\nwere a great many materialisations, and we will close by noting a few of\nthe more outstanding of these phenomena.\nMrs Barnes described how her father, who had been in the Madras\npolice force, materialised a yard away from her. On his head was a white\ntropical helmet with a red band, which of course appeared black (p. 199).\nBy this statement the witness apparently intended to convey that she\npresumed that the band was red, as in life, but that under the lighting\nconditions of the seance it seemed black. If the red light were really\nnot strong enough to show up a red colour, it must have been very dim\nindeed.\nMrs Jopling agreed that there was a foreign-looking white helmet with\na dark band (p. 198).\nWorth said that Mrs Homer exclaimed, \" Look at the Helmet \", which\nhe did as hard as he could, but there was nothing to be seen (p. 47).\nHomer saw a white helmet, like a topee (p. 129).\nMackie thought the figure was wearing an ordinary blue policeman's\nhelmet (p. 147).\nMrs Sullivan said it was a dark helmet, but not of English style (p. 180).\nMrs Barnes gave an account of a second materialisation, this time of her\ngranddaughter, Shirley. This was a little girl, some three feet high, who\ncame out to the extreme left of the curtains. She stood a foot away and,\ntaking hold of Mrs Barnes' hand, recited, \" This little piggy . .\n.\" in a baby\nvoice (p. 199).\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 59\nAll the defence witnesses were agreed on these points. Homer said he\nsaw the child clearly. She was about three feet high and took hold of\nMrs Barnes' fingers as she recited, \" This little piggy went to market . .\n.\"\nMrs Cole said the same (pp. 129, 155). Mrs Sullivan had noticed the\nbaby fingers (p. 179). Mrs Tremlett said the child was about three years\nof age (p. 189). In defiance of all these witnesses, Worth swore he remem-\nbered no such incident (p. 63).\nAnother supposedly girlish manifestation was Mrs Duncan's guide\nPeggy. Worth described her as a bulky, white-shrouded figure that came\nout of the cabinet and jumped about (p. 45).\nDr Fowler, one of the prosecution witnesses, was more interesting. He\nsaid Peggy was a white form about five feet high. He could not see her\nvery well or tell how bulky she was, because the forms had a habit of\npulling out the curtains with them, so concealing part of their figure. The\ncurtains were draped in front of the figures, and if wide open the manifes-\ntation seemed bulky, but if the curtains were drawn closer together it\nappeared slim (p. 73).\nMrs Jennings, a prosecution witness, admitted that Peggy came right\noutside the cabinet and danced about, but the room was very dark and it\nmight have been Mrs Duncan impersonating a slim young girl (p. 98).\nMrs Tremlett said she saw Peggy clearly as a young girl, about eighteen\nto twenty, not particularly fat (p. 189).\nThus, once again, and for the last time, we have traced the whole gamut\nof possibilities, from the witness who steadfastly heard and saw nothing,\nthrough the more doubtful witnesses, right down to those out and out\nbelievers to whom everything was as clear as noonday, every face was\nrecognisable, and every detail vividly remembered.\nWithout the example of the trial before us, it would have been hard to\nbelieve that honest witnesses could be so biased in their observations. In\ncircumstances of excitement, accident, unexpected happenings, etc., com-\nplete coincidence of testimony and awareness of detail is not to be expected.\nOur experience of everyday life in such circumstances show that the human\nmind is not constituted to be aware of minor details. Only the salient\nfact, with a minimum amount of detail, is remembered. Cross-examina-\ntion demonstrates that different witnesses to the same situation take in\ndifferent items and remember different details afterwards.\nIn the conditions of Mrs Duncan's seances, with the sitters emotionally\nimplicated, the correct answer to a majority of the questions put by\nCounsel at the trial should have been, \" I don't know, I did not notice\nthat point \". The fact that, on the contrary, defence witnesses coincided\nin detailed evidence favouring the Defence, and prosecution witnesses\ncoincided in detailed evidence favouring the Prosecution, gives us a forcible\nobject lesson of how little the human mind in such circumstances is dis-\npassionate and unbiased. No doubt the witnesses at the trial felt them-\nselves to be giving honest evidence, but all the same their testimony was\nalmost entirely governed by previous bias.\nAnyone wanting further evidence of human fallibility will find plenty\nmore illustrations in this informative book The Trial of Mrs Duncan.\n\f6o Donald J. West [Part\n\/\/\/. THE LAW RELATING TO PSYCHIC PHENOMENA.\nThe Treatment of Mediums.\nBefore plunging into the perilous morass of legal theory, we might first\nconsider the Duncan trial as a purely practical illustration of the treatment\na medium and her associates may expect to receive at the hands of the law\nof the present day.\nThe spiritualists lent Mrs Duncan every support in her legal battle.\nNever before had a medium been tried before such high authorities, and\nthe spiritualists were naturally anxious to see how she would fare. They\nmade her trial a test case, hoping for a successful issue that would establish\na favourable precedent.\nJudge and counsel at the trial were experts of high standing, so we must\npresume that as a piece of legal investigation it was a model of judicial\nfairness. As laymen we are not competent to express any other opinion,\nbut as psychical researchers, with standards of evidence peculiar to our-\nselves, we are entitled to contrast our own methods of judging psychic\nphenomena with those of the law.\nIn the first place, in psychical investigations, it is usually the medium\nalone who stands to suffer after an exposure ; but when Mrs Duncan was\ntackled by the law three other people were charged with her on grounds\nof conspiracy. They were Mrs Brown, the medium's travelling companion\nand Mr and Mrs Homer, the spiritualists who employed Mrs Duncan.\nAll were found guilty. Mrs Brown's guilt was established mainly on the\ngrounds that she was present as Mrs Duncan's friend and showed some\nof the visitors spirit photographs of a type the police were able to imitate.\nMr and Mrs Homer brought to the court receipts to show that money left\nover from the takings of the seances was given to charity. Mrs Homer's\nchief crimes were encouraging the sitters to speak up and making remarks\nupon the wonder of the '\nphenomena '. The couple were by all accounts\nsincere spiritualists and respectable citizens, but in the eyes of the law\nthey were guilty of conspiracy and must have known Mrs Duncan was a\nfraud.\nNeither Mrs Duncan, nor Mrs Brown, nor Mrs Homer elected to go\ninto the witness-box to give evidence in their own defence, but Mrs\nDuncan's counsel called witnesses to try to prove that she had been a\ngenuine medium before and after the 19th of January 1944. The judge\ndecided that this was putting Mrs Duncan's character in evidence and that\nthe jury had therefore a right to know about her previous conviction at\nEdinburgh (p. 265). He also refused to admit the evidence of alleged\ntest seances held after February 29th 1944, the date on which the accused\nwere committed (p. 236).\nThe main evidence against Mrs Duncan was the testimony of Lieutenant\nWorth and Constable Cross. Great emphasis was placed on Worth's\ndescription of the bogus aunt and the non-existent sister who appeared to\nhim on January 14th. We have noted in the last section how widely\nWorth's version of this episode differed from the descriptions of the defence\nwitnesses. His statements remained totally unconfirmed^ because the\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan\nlegal experts failed to question his companion, Surgeon-Lieutenant\nFowler, on any of the essential points.\nAs a witness. Worth was not entirely satisfactory. He admitted to\ndeliberately deceiving the Homers into thinking he was convinced. He\nhad told them that the sitting of the 14th was \" amazing \"\n(p. 54). In\ngiving evidence he said he had rung up his mother and confirmed the\nspirit message about a premature sister. Later on he had to admit in\nactual fact his mother had had no premature child and was not even on\nthe telephone. When first questioned, Worth also said he had only been\ncarrying out police instructions, but later he recanted again and confessed\nto acting on his own initiative (p. 70).\nEven if we accept Worth's testimony without dispute, there still seems\nnothing in it to prove fraud when the evidence is considered from the\npsychical research standpoint. Poor quality communications are not\nproof of fraud, and in any case the communications have little to do with\nthe nature of the materialisations, which was the main point at issue.\nThe suggestion of the prosecution was that the materialisations were Mrs\nDuncan wrapped in a sheet. Cross claimed to have seen and touched\nthis sheet when he pounced on Mrs Duncan at the seance of January 19th,\nbut the alleged sheet was not found and no systematic search of the sitters\nwas made. Much of the evidence of the defence was utterly at variance\nwith the sheet hypothesis. Mrs Duncan was proffered for the purpose of\na test seance in court, so that the jury could see the materialisations for\nthemselves. The judge first of all said he would not allow the jury to be\ntroubled with a matter of that sort. Later he asked the jury if they wished\nto have the opportunity of witnessing such a demonstration. They replied\nthat they did not (p. 305).\nWith our experience as psychical researchers, and with the whole of Mrs\nDuncan's chequered histor}' before us, we have some right to doubt the\naccuracy of the witnesses to her genuineness. Little of this information\nwas officially available to the court, and it is a problem how without it\nthey were able to come to the decision to over-rule the evidence for the\ndefence. One cannot help but feel that their verdict may have been largely\ndecided on a^non grounds, or, in common parlance, by personal prejudice.\nIt is no secret that the police rarely take action against spiritualist\nmediums unless they become a public nuisance, or unless a member of\nthe public registers an ofiiciaI\\;omplaint against them. In the case of Mrs\nDuncan, it came out that at one of her seances she or her spirits had\nrevealed the sinking of a British warship before its loss had been officially\ndisclosed (p. 337). Were this the true complaint, it is a pity she was not\ntried on another charge.\nThe Word of the Law.\nThere are two acts in the Statute Book of direct concern to everyone\ninterested in psychic phenomena. They are the Witchcraft Act of 1735\n(9 Geo. 2, c. 5) and the Vagrancy Act of 1824, 2 (5 Geo. 4, c. 83) with its\nsubsequent amendments. As British Law presumes itself known to all,\nwe had better be familiar with the provisions of these acts, if only for our\nown protection.\n\f62 Donald J. West [Part\nThe tone of the Vagrancy Act has all the obnoxiousness of the old\n\" Poor Laws \". It was introduced for the swift and certain punishment\nof idle and disorderly persons. A whole list of ofl'ences is covered by the\nActs, including obscenely exposing the person in a public place, procuring\nalms by the exhibition of deformities, a male person living on the proceeds\nof prostitution, being armed with an offensive weapon with intent to\ncommit a felony, etc. etc.\nEvery member of the public has the right to apprehend and deliver into\nthe hands of the police any person found offending against the Act. Any\nvehicle or personal effects in the offender's possession may be taken into\ncustody with him and searched. Any money found on him may be used\nto pay the expenses of the arrest and the cost of maintaining the offender\nuntil the time of committal. If his cash is insufHcient for the purpose,\nthe police can sell his belongings.\nOnce charged as a rogue and vagabond under the Vagrancy Act, the\noffender can be dealt with summarily in a magistrate's court. He is liable\nfor up to three months' imprisonment and is not allowed the right of trial\nby jury. Once convicted, his name is placed for all time on the list of\n\" rogues and vagabonds \".\nFor a second offence under the Act, the offender can be tried again at\na Court of Petty Sessions without a jury, but he must wait for the next\nQuarter Sessions for his sentence of one year's imprisonment and a\nwhipping. The Spiritualists are not the only people who have sought for\na revision of the Vagrancy acts.^\nThe clause by which mediums are classed as rogues and vagabonds reads\nas follows :\n\" Every person pretending or professing to tell fortunes, or using any\nsubtle craft, means or device, by palmistry or otherwise, to deceive and\nimpose on any of his Majesty's subjects.\"\nMediums are not specifically mentioned in the wording of the clause,\nbut it has been held to include them by a decision of the High Court of\nJustice in 1877 ^^e appeal of a medium named Monck. Monck, who\nhad been charged under the Vagrancy Act, appealed on a point of law.\nThe accident of a deficiency of judges in the Divisional Court of Appeal\nwas the cause of the case being heard in High Court. Monck claimed\nthat his mediumistic demonstrations did not come under the jurisdiction\nof the Act, but his appeal was quashed on the grounds that the words\n\" subtle craft \" included supposed communication with spirits.\nEfforts have been made to relieve spiritualists and mediums from prose-\ncutions under the Witchcraft and Vagrancy Acts, but so far without success.\nIn 1930 a Bill entitled the Spiritualism and Psychical Research Exemption\nBill was discussed in the House of Commons. It Vv'as ordered to be\nbrought in by a number of supporters of the spiritualist' case, among them\nbeing Sir Ernest Bennett, Mr Oliver Baldwin, Mr D. G. Somerville, and\nMiss Wilkinson. But it failed to attract sufficient attention and was finally\ndropped.\nUnder this Bill no person was to be prosecuted or convicted under the\nStatutes relating to witchcraft or vagrancy in respect of any act done or\nwords spoken in the promulgation or exposition of the teachings of\n'\nSee, for instance, Justice in England, by a barrister, (London), 1938.\n\f172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 63\nspiritualism, or in the pursuit of psychical research. Thus promoters,\nchairmen, lecturers, clairvoyants and mediums were to be protected, but\nany immunity was not to apply where intention to defraud was proved.\nMediums and clairvoyants were defined as persons holding a certiiicate or\n\" licence of fitness to practise,\" such certificates to be issued by \" registered\nor properly constituted spiritualistic or psychical societies, or such other\ncertifying or licensing body \" as might be approved by one of His Majesty's\nPrincipal Secretaries of State.\nThe Spiritualists' National Union have also made attempts to obtain\nsome modification of the Vagrancy Act in its application to mediums. A\ndeputation to the Home Office in 1930 included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,\nHannen Swaffer and the Rev C. Drayton Thomas. Another in 1943 had\nMr Loseby, barrister, as chief spokesman, and included Lord Dowding\nand Dr S. J. Peters, M.P. They failed to secure any amendment to the\nVagrancy Act, but in November 1943 Mr Morrison, at that time Home\nSecretary wrote to Dr Peters as follows :\n\" I appreciate, however, the feelings of spiritualists on this subject, and\nI have made enquiries as to prosecutions under this Act. I understand\nthat it is the practice in some Police Forces in cases of this kind to institute\nproceedings only against persons whose activities have been the subject of\ncomplaint by members of the public, and where there is evidence that the\nperson is an impostor and taking money or other valuable consideration.\nAlthough I have no power to issue any directions to the police as to the\nmanner in which they should enforce the law, I have asked the Chief\nConstables to consider the adoption of this practice in their Forces. Fur-\nther than this I cannot go, but, if the practice I have described is generally\nadopted, persons bona fide engaged in the ministrations of the spiritualist\nchurches and in psychical research should not find themselves hampered\nby the provisions of the law.\"^\nWith this semi-assurance they and we must rest content.\nThe Witchcraft Act of 1735 repeals the previous Act of King James the\nFirst against Conjuration and Witchcraft. It forbids proceedings against\nany person or persons for witchcraft, sorcery, inchantment, or conjuration,\nand goes on :\n\" And for the more eff^ectual preventing and punishing of any Pretences\nto such Arts or Powers as are before mentioned, whereby ignorant\npersons are frequently deluded and defrauded ; be it further enacted by\nthe Authority aforesaid. That if any Person shall, from and after the said\nTwenty-fourth Day of June, pretend to exercise or use any kind of Witch-\ncraft, Sorcery, Inchantment, or Conjuration, or undertake to tell Fortunes,\nor pretend, from his or her Skill or Knowledge in any occult or crafty\nScience, to discover where or in what Manner any Goods or Chattels,\nsupposed to have been stolen or lost, may be found \" they shall be guilty\nof an offence against the Act. The penalty is a year's imprisonment.\nWe may note in passing the specific reference to finding lost articles by\npsychic means, a feat that has been recorded many times in the annals of\npsychical research.\nMrs Duncan was tried under the Witchcraft Act on a charge of conspiracy\n* See \" Report of the Deputation from the Spiritualists' National Union to the\nHome Office \", (Manchester), 1944, p. 16.\n\f^4 Donald J. West [Part 172]'\nto pretend to exercise or use a kind of conjuration. Sir Gerald Dodson\nwas at pains to explain that the emphasis was on the word \" pretend \".\nThe Lord Chief Justice, Viscount Caldecote, made the same point in his\njudgement on the appeal (pp. 321, 348). Presumably if Mrs Duncan's\nmaterialisations had been considered genuine, and not a pretence, they\nwould not have constituted an offence, although this was not stated in so\nmany words.\nThe grounds of Mrs Duncan's appeal included one important point of\nlaw, namely whether the word \" conjuration \" in the Act applied only to\npersonal conference with the Devil or Evil Spirits (p. 347). It was decided\nthat the word had a wider meaning and applied to converse with any kind\nof spirit. The appeal was quashed.\nPossibly as a result of the publicity given to the Duncan trial, questions\nwere asked in the House of Commons on May 3rd 194s regarding the law\nrelating to the activities of spiritualist mediums. Mr' Herbert Morrison\nreplied that, while he had no power to determine questions of law, he had\nbeen advised that the provisions of the Witchcraft and Vagrancy Acts\nmade it quite clear that the mischief aimed at was fraud and imposture\nHe reaffirmed that the police had been advised by the Home Office to\nmstitute proceedings only where there is sufficient evidence that the person\nis an impostor.\nIn reply to a question by Mr Montague, the Home Secretary said he\nhad been advised that it was not criminal to undertake spiritualist seances.\nThe Lord Chancellor had written to Lord Dowding expressing that view.\nThis very rough survey of the state of the law with regard to psychic\nphenomena brings to a close our resume of the main points raised by Mrs\nDuncan and her sensational trial.\n\fPROCEEDINGS OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nPART 173\nTHE MODUS OPERANDI OF PARANORMAL COGNITION\nABSTRACT\nThe object of this paper is twofold. It is in the first place an attempt to\ndeduce something of the nature of paranormal cognition from an examina-\ntion of the collected evidence, and secondly to show that the completely\ncontrolled type of experiment is misleading if employed alone. The\nreason for the latter is that experiments in paranormal cognition, if\ncontrolled as rigidly as in physical science, and if amenable to statistical\ntreatment, must make use of extremely restricted events, such as card-\nguessing. Such events serve to demonstrate the existence of paranormal\ncognition, and to show certain of its minor features, but not to elucidate\nits nature : they are too devoid of qualitative content. It is here pointed\nout that by selecting their evidence, workers in the field of statistical\nexperiment have reached erroneous conclusions ;\nand the plea is put\nforward that theoretical conclusions should not be based on selected\nevidence but on all the evidence treated impartially.\nIf the material quoted, and its significance, has been dealt with at some\nlength, this is because it was felt that the points arising in an issue of such\nimportance for psychical research must be made abundantly clear.\nThe method of approach here used to the problems of paranormal\ncognition is different from that now in vogue. It points to the conclusions\n(i) that paranormal cognition is known to consciousness only by means of\nan entirely secondary phenomenon, (2) that it is not a faculty akin to sense-\nperception, and (3) that experiment in a neglected field is needed to reveal\nmore of its nature.\nA suggested experimental programme is briefly summarised at the end\nof the paper.\nThis Society has now carried on its work for sixty-four years, and it is\nnatural to ask what progress has been made towards establishing an under-\nstanding of the faculty which was at first called \" thought-transference \",\nand later \" telepathy \", and which has now been subsumed, together with\nthe faculties called \" clairvoyance \" and \" precognition \", under the term\n\" extra-sensory perception \".\nThe term, \" extra-sensory perception \", which was proposed by Prof.\nJ. B. Rhine, is written with a hyphen between the words \" extra \" and\n\" sensory \". This suggests a faculty akin to sense-perception, though\nbeyond it. It suggests, in fact, that we know that this faculty can properly\nE .65\n\f66 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nbe called \" perception \", and in this, I think, we are allowing assumption\nto outrun evidence. On the other hand, if the hyphen he placed between\nthe words \" sensory \" and \" perception \", the term implies no more than\nthat we are dealing with something which is beyond sense-perception.\nIt gives no hint as to what that \" something \" is ; and the title becomes\nunnecessarily negative. For this reason I have preferred to speak of\n\" paranormal cognition \" rather than of \" extra-sensory perception \" or\n\" extra sensory-perception \". But even this title is not altogether satis-\nfactory, for sometimes it is paranormal action or paranormal feeling with\nwhich we have to do rather than with paranormal cognition. Moreover, it\nmay be doubted whether the whole of the phenomenon can properly be\ncalled \" paranormal \".\nDr R. H. Thouless, with Dr B. P. Wiesner, has proposed the term\n\" psi-phenomena \", which has the advantage of avoiding the word\n\" perception \" ; but I believe that he intends this term to apply to a wider\nrange of phenomena than that covered by paranormal cognition. On the\nwhole, the latter seems to me, for the present purpose, to be the best term\nto use.\nIf progress is to be made towards understanding something of the nature\nof paranormal cognition, and if we are to avoid blind alleys and false and\nmisleading hypotheses, it is absolutely essential that all the relevant\nmaterial should be examined. Assumptions should not be made unless\nchecked against all the available evidence. Reference to our Proceedings\nshows that this kind of critical examination was made more often in the\nearlier days of the Society than it is to-day. For example, Mrs Sidgwick's\npaper On the Evidence for Clairvoyance was published in 1891 ; her paper\nOn the Evidence for Premonitions in 1888 ; On the Trance Phenomena of\n^\nMrs Piper between 1908 and 191 1 ; F. W. H. Myers's paper On the\nSubliminal Self before 1901 ; Edmund Gurney's work on Hypnotism,\nTelepathy and Apparitions before his death in 1888. Attempts of this\nkind to extract the significance of the collected evidence by critical analysis\nare far fewer in later volumes of the Proceedings. A new technique has\nbeen introduced in recent years, that of the experiment which can be\ncompletely controlled and statistically evaluated. This has been designed\nto render psychical research more \" objective \". It is all to the good as\nfar as it goes ; but unfortunately those who pursue it have neglected to\ncompare their results with past work or to apply critical analysis of the\nabove kind. Workers in statistical experiments assume that they have\nmade a new start\u2014and that the previous work was only preliminary and\nneed not be taken into account either in planning further experiments or\nin formulating hypotheses. To what erroneous conclusions this attitude\ncan lead will be shown presently. It is a mistake to think that psychical\nresearch can be carried out in sections and that the investigator can build a\ncomprehensive hypothesis based on one section of the evidence only,\nwhile ignoring the rest. Also, in my view, it is necessary in this subject\nnot only to examine the whole of the evidence but also to step frequently\noutside the laboratory and survey the whole field of the paranormal in\norder to get one's perspective right. The extent to which workers in\nstatistical research have ignored other evidence is shown in certain recent\npublications. v\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 67\nFor example, in the book entitled Extra-Sensory Perception after Sixty\nYears (1940) by Prof. J. B. Rhine, J. G. Pratt, Burke M. Smith, C. E.\nStewart and J. A. Greenwood, bearing the sub-title, A Critical Appraisal\nof the Research in Extra-Sensory Perception, only 2\\ pages out of 409 are\ndevoted to spontaneous cases of extra-sensory perception, and only one\npage to experimental work of a non-statistical kind. All the rest of the\nbook is devoted to a discussion of evidence derived from the statistical\ntype of experiment. Mr Whately Carington published in 1945 a book\nentitled Telepathy, bearing as its sub-title An Outline of its Facts, Theory\nand Implications. Seven pages out of 170 are devoted to spontaneous\ncases and none at all to non-statistical experiment. He also propounds in\nthis book a theory of telepathy based almost entirely on the results of\nstatistical experiments, and appears to be unaware that these experiments\ndo not reveal the most important features of telepathy.\nIt is necessary here to make a somewhat tiresome digression in order to\njustify the use of the term \" statistical experiment \". It has been pointed\nout that there is in theory no \" statistical method \" of experiment in the\nsense of a separate principle of research which alone makes use of statistics.\nStatistics are applied wherever they are needed, and they are particularly\nneeded in dealing with chance-coincidence. This is quite true in general.\nBut in psychical research the most important phenomena are not of a\nnature which lend themselves to statistical treatment, because they concern\nthe spontaneous behaviour of human beings, and their essential charac-\nteristics are qualitative. If statistics are to be applied to coincidences in,\nthe field of psychical research, this involves the selection of paranormal\nevents to which statistics can be applied ; and so long as the investigators\ninsist on applying statistics, they limit themselves to an examination of these\nevents. Experiments made with these restricted events lead to different\nconclusions about the nature of paranormal cognition from the conclusions\npointed to by less restricted paranormal events, and the experimenter who\nattempts to theorise on the basis of statistical experiments alone is likely\nto be misled. This will be demonstrated later. My point for the moment\nis that it is legitimate, as well as convenient, to speak of \" statistical\nexperiments \" because they stand apart as a class on account of the fact\nthat the events they comprise have been chosen in order to suit a pre-\ndetermined method of research.\nI shall now consider what light the evidence in general throws on the\nnature of paranormal cognition.\nThe Relation of Paranormal Cognition to Consciousness\nThe first thing to be noticed is that paranormal cognition is not a con-\nscious process. No percipient of telepathy, clairvoyance or precognition,\nso far as I can gather, has ever been consciously aware of a telepathic,\nclairvoyant or precognitive process at work within him. No one has been\nable to say : Now I am conscious that a telepathic message is coming to\nme from origin X ; or : Now I am aware of the process of clairvoyantly\nperceiving an object Y ; or : Now I am conscious that knowledge of a\nfuture event Z is reaching me. It is always the product and never the\nprocess of paranormal cognition of which the subject is aware. In this\n\f68 The Modus Operandi of [PariI\nrespect paranormal cognition resembles normal sense-perception and also\nmemory. ,\nPerhaps some percipients, if asked, would at first be inclined to claim'\nawareness of the process ; but I do not think they would persist in this\nclaim when once they had grasped the difference between process and\nproduct.\nIf it be agreed that there is valid evidence for paranormal cognition\nand if It be also agreed that the process of paranormal cognition is not\nopen to conscious inspection, it follows that that process does not take\nplace in consciousness. It takes place, therefore, outside consciousness \u2022\nthat is to say, in the language of psychical research, it takes place in the\nsubliminal self \". I have heard this referred to as an \" assumption \"\nand as\na speculation \" ; but what other conclusion is possible?\nWhat is it, then, in a case of paranormal cognition, which takes place in\nconsciousness.? It is awareness of the product of the paranormal cognitive\nprocess.\nThe Principle of Mediation\nIf we approach paranormal cognition from the angle adopted in this\npaper, two important facts strike us at the outset, (i) The product of the\nparanormal cognitive process is not paranormal, (ii) The product of the\nparanormal cognitive process is also the product of cognitive and other\nprocesses which we are not in the habit of calling paranormal These\nstatements will be best understood in the light of a few examples I will\ndeal with the second statement first.\nI. Normal Cases. An instructive case is that of Mr A. {Proc xviii 7o8)\nThough normal in every other respect, Mr A. had very bad eyesight\nOne day, while walking along a country road, he saw the stone wall\nbeside the road with extraordinary clearness, each separate stone being\nvisible with the mortar between the joints. Here and there broken\ngranite stones showed felspar and quartz reflected in the sun's rays Mr A\nthought he had never seen a wall so minutely before. When he came to a\npart of the road where there was no wall in reality but only an iron railing\nhe still saw the wall, but he did not see the railing. Then he shut his eyes\nand found that he continued to see the wall with the sun shining on it\njust as clearly as before. Presently the wall disappeared from his visual\nheld ;\nbut flowers and various coloured designs took their place, and these\nvisual hallucinations lasted for some days. Then they ceased but\nreturned the next year. These visual hallucinations had two m'arked\ncharacteristics : they were extremely bright, being almost luminous \u2022\nand they were quite clear, having none of the haziness which marred\nMr A. s normal vision.\nI do not wish to enter into problems of sense-perception, which properly\nbelong to the fields of philosophy and psychology ; but I would stress the\nview that the cause of Mr A.'s visions, whatever it may have been lav\nentirely within Mr A. himself. The objective part of Mr A 's vis'ions\nhad no physical existence in the space surrounding him ; neither had the\nvisions any cause residing in external space. The cause of them lay within\nthe totality of Mr A.'s psycho-physical personality.\n\fjy^] Paranormal Cognition 69\nPerhaps the word \" hallucination \" should not be applied to such com-\npletely constructed visions as these. It may be that, following '\nProf\nH. H. Price's suggestion {Perception, p. 198), they should rather be called\n\" apparitions \". But the apparitions I shall have to deal with m the\nexamples following have varying degrees of perfected constructability and\nvarying kinds of externality, and it will be more convenient to call these\n\" hallucinations \". The important point is that these sensory hallucina-\ntions are constructs or creations for which some factor in the percipient\nhimself is responsible, though that factor is excluded from normal\nconsciousness. .\n-a n\n2. The following is another case of visual hallucination. Mr U.\nConstable {Proc. xxi, 510) wrote :\n\" I have frequently to walk from my\nhouse to the village club. The road outside the house runs for perhaps\ntwenty yards, with trees on one side and iron fencing on the other. Then\ncomes a five-barred gate, which I have to open to pass through into an\nopen field. The road is naturally very familiar to me. At nightfall, when\non leaving the light of the house, I can at first see nothing and, later on\nonly the path very dimly, and objects definite but at a yard or two, the\nfollowing false visualisation is of almost common occurrence. I see the\nbars of the gate before me crossing my path before I come to the material\ngate This false visualisation has occurred, very possibly twenty or thirty\ntimes during the last three years, and carefully dissecting my experience,\nI am of opinion that the false visualisation is, to me, as real and definite as\nvisualisation resulting from the material. I should perhaps state that this\nfalse visualisation is unique in my experience.\" Later Mr Constable added:\n\"\nLast night walking to the club, I determined to '\nbilk '\nthe hallucination.\nAs I walked I marked a tree on my right and said to myself :\n'\nNow the\ngate is within three feet of me.' I looked. There was the gate. I walked\nto it. It was not there, but some six or seven feet distant. I looked again\nat the tree (remember it was but a dim shadow in the darkness) and I saw\nI had mistaken it for another.\"\nThe hallucinatory gate was as real and definite to Mr Constable as the\nhallucinatory wall was to Mr A. But the Constable case reveals another\nfeature. Something resembling a motive appears. There was an expecta-\ntion, amounting to a subconscious idee fixe, that the gate was in a different\nposition from that which it really occupied ; so the constructor of the\nhallucination responded to this suggestion by causing the gate to appear in\naccordance with the expectation.\nThe motive in Case i is not very obvious. We are told that the beautiful\nand highly coloured designs which Mr A. saw were a source of great\npleasure to him, so that the motive may have been a subconscious desire\nto compensate the percipient for his bad sight.\n3. A very similar case was recorded by Miss Ina Jephson [Journal,\nxxvii, 184). While staying with friends. Miss Jephson received a letter\nfrom her lawyer saying that a cheque for \u00a310 was enclosed. Having no\ntime to deal with it at the moment, she says : \"I carried it about, peering\ninto the envelope occasionally to see whether the cheque was safely there.\nIt was finally packed with special care and I had pleasing memories\nthroughout the day of seeing the marbled pale colours of the cheque\nand the look of the writing on it.\" When she arrived home, Miss Jephson\n\f7\u00b0 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nlooked into the envelope but found no cheque. She searched for it every-\nwhere in vain, and at last wrote to her lawyer saying that she must have\nlost it and asking him to stop payment. By return of post he answered\nwith an apology, saying that he had omitted to enclose the cheque but\nwould forward it at once. Miss Jephson says that she could hardly bring\nherself to believe that all this had been a hallucination. She adds :\n\" If\ncross-examined in a court of law I would have said with complete and-\nabsolute conviction that I had seen and handled the cheque in the first\nletter.\" The apparitional cheque was as good an imitation of reality as in\n'\nthe previous cases ; and this time the sense of touch seems to have been\nhallucinated as well as that of sight. The motive is again strong expecta- |\ntion generated by the statement made in the letter that the cheque was\nenclosed. !\n4. The following case, though of the same type, shows an interesting\ndilTerence {Proc. xi, 423). The percipient of this hallucination went into\nhis office one night after dark, and, wishing to pass from the front room\nto the back along a narrow passage, which was usually kept free from\nobstructions, he started to walk rapidly along it.\n\" I had proceeded six or\neight feet in this rapid manner,\" he says, \" when suddenly I saw a bright\nyellow light lighting up very plainly the back of the chair which was in the\npassage. The light was confined to the chair, and at the same time I |\nstopped short. The stopping was quite involuntary on my part. The\nlight lasted for but a second, but it had shown me the chair distinctly,\nespecially the carving on the back of the chair.\" He searched in vain for\nsome explanation of the light, which had shone only in one place so as to\nilluminate the chair. In this case the constructor of hallucinations,\ninstead of creating a hallucinatory object which was not there, created a\nhallucinatory light to illuminate a real object, which shows adaptation to\ncircumstances. The motive was to give warning of danger.\n5. So far the hallucinations have been visual. But the following case\nillustrates a different kind of appeal to consciousness. A man had landed\nfrom a steamer {Proc. xi, 422) and was attempting to make his way along\nthe dock-side to his hotel. It was night, and the darkness was increased\nby the shadow of a warehouse which fell across his path. After following\nfor a short distance the edge of the quay, the narrator says :\n\" I suddenly\nfelt so strong an impulse to turn and go the other way that I instantly\nobeyed. I saw nothing, heard nothing ; I did not even have an impression\nof danger, though I did have a feeling that it must be in some way better\nto turn. I distinctly remember that my reason protested, and berated me\nfor a fool for taking a roundabout way to my destination when the straight\nway lay before me, with the added prospect of losing myself in the railway\nyards with perhaps a ten-foot fence to climb. I laughed aloud and articu-\nlated or at least mentally formed the words, '\nYou fool! What are you\ndoing this for.? '\nHowever, my impulse proved stronger than my reason.\nI persisted in '\ngoing round Robin Hood's barn ', reached my hotel, and\nthere the matter passed from my mind.\" Next day he came back to the i\nplace and found that just beyond the point at which he had turned back \\\nthe dock was cut away to form a steep slope, and, if he had gone on he\nwould have fallen onto this and have slid into the river and most probably\nbeen drowned.\n\f1-73] Paranormal Cognition 7^\nHere the motive is again a warning. One must suppose that the sense\nof sight had perceived the danger by such hght as there was, but so faintly\nthat the signal never reached consciousness. Hence the subliminal self\ncreated this impulse to return as a means of stopping the percipient\nquickly. The impulse to take a certain course of action was a message-\nbearer to consciousness just as were the visual hallucinations in the other\ncases.\n6. Another case was that of a dentist {Proc. xi, 424), who was bending\nover an apparatus for vulcanising rubber, when he heard a voice calling\nto him in quick and imperative tones, \" Run to the window, quick!\n\"\nThis was twice repeated and the dentist ran to the window and looked out\ninto the street. At that moment the vulcanising apparatus exploded so\nviolently that it broke the bench on which it stood and went through the\nceiling. No one else was in the room at the time. Again the motive was\nto warn the conscious mind. We may suppose that the danger was sub-\nconsciously observed by the dentist ; but the method of mediating the\nsubconscious knowledge to consciousness was this time by means of\nan auditory hallucination, probably the best way of eliciting a quick\nresponse.\n7. A more complex way of conveying subliminal knowledge to con-\nsciousness is reported in Journal xxx, 1 80. Mrs Max West had lost a ruby\nout of her ring while she was washing some clothes in a sink. Thinking\nthe ruby had gone down the drain, she gave it up for lost. \" The following\nmorning I was in the same room \", says Mrs West, \" when I seemed to\nhear somebody say, '\nWhat about that ruby? '\nand without thinking that I\nwas alone audibly replied, '\nOh, that's gone for good, it is of no use\ntroubling about that.' By that time I realised that I was replying to no\nvisible person, but before I could think further, I seemed to be grasped\nby the shoulders and twisted round and the first thing my eyes rested upon\nwas the ruby on the floor, shining in a shaft of sunlight made by the outside\ndoor being open a crack. I do not wish it to be thought that I felt my\nshoulders grasped any more than I heard any particular person's voice,\nbut that I was aware of myself as a person inside my body but the same\nshape which heard and felt quite well without my body.\"\nHere the motive, which was the desire to find the ruby, is obvious ;\nbut the method of informing consciousness was this time a good deal more\ncomplex. It was both auditory and tactile and was, in fact, a little drama.\nThis time the hallucinations do not seem to have been quite like normal\nperceptions.\n8. The Rev. P. H. Newnham, who was an entomologist, reported the\nfollowing experience (Proc. xi, 41 1). \"I have on many occasions through-\nout the last thirty-five years at least experienced the sensation of a soundless\nvoice speaking words distinctly into my ear from outside of me. Whenever\nthis has been the case, the information or advice given has invariably\nproved correct. ... In July 1858 (I believe, but it may have been June\n1857), I was visiting friends at Tunbridge Wells and went out one evening\nentomologising. As I crossed the stile into a field, on my way to a neigh-\nbouring wood, the voice distinctly said in my right ear, '\nYou will find\nChaonia on that oak.' (This was a very scarce moth which I had never\nseen before and which most assuredly I had never consciously thought of\n\f72 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nseeing.) There were several oaks in the field, but I intuitively walked up\nto one, straight to the off side of it, and there was the moth indicated.\"\nThe motive here was Mr Newnham's interest in rare moths. The mode\nof informing consciousness was again an auditory hallucination, which was\nthis time fully externalised in distinction to the partially externalised\nhallucination of Case 7. We may suppose that Mr Newnham subcon-\nsciously saw the moth flying towards one particular tree ; but the sup-\nposition is rather far fetched, since the moth was found on the off side of it.\nThese eight cases are examples of mediation to consciousness of sub-\nconscious knowledge by means, chiefly, of sensory hallucinations. They\ndo not involve the paranormal. The sensory and impulsive experiences\nwere not in themselves paranormal ; and the information conveyed may\nbe explained as originating in a normal source. But in cases 6 to 8 the\ninformation might have been acquired paranormally. There is of course a\nvery wide field of sensory hallucination which is not regarded as paranormal-\nhypnotic, eidetic, pathological and occurring incidentally in ordinary life.\nIt is unnecessary to deal with this here. The cases quoted are sufficient to\nshow (i) that sensory hallucinations are unconsciously constructed by the\npercipient, (2) that the senses of sight, hearing and touch can be hallucinated\nwith great perfection, and also with varying degrees of perfection. (Prob-\nably taste and smell can also be hallucinated if occasion arises.) (3) that\nan impulse to action may take the place of a sensory hallucination, (4) that\nall these are messages from the subliminal self to consciousness, (5) that\nall are created in response to something which may be broadly called a\nsubconscious \" motive \". In all this we are concerned with psychological\nprocesses which may be called \" normal \", since they are produced by\nstanding mechanisms forming an integral part of every normal human\nbeing.\nIn the above cases it was not only the mechanism of mediation that was\nnormal : the subject-matter of the hallucinations and the motives which\ngave rise to the phenomena were normal also. But the whole of the\nphenomena originated in the subconscious region of the percipient's\npersonality. So far we have not left the field of normal psychological\nhappenings.\nThe Mediating Vehicle\nThe function of these hallucinations and impulses was to mediate\nsomething to consciousness\u2014some urge or desire or motive existing in\nthe subliminal portion of the self. I shall in future call them \" Mediating\nVehicles \". One important thing to notice is that the full-blown hallucina-\ntions we have been considering (more properly called \" apparitions \")\nare only the end term of a series. Visual hallucinations may be fully\nexternalised in space and may appear to be exactly like normal, visual\npercepts. But they may also appear like a picture framed in a hole in the\nwall, or may take the form of a vision seen in a crystal or of a vivid semi-\ninternal image, or of a dream. There are all gradations, and the fully\nexternalised hallucination differs from the others only in degree and not in\nkind. With auditory hallucinations it is the same. The voice may be\nfully externalised, as in Cases 6 and 8, or partially externalised as in\nCase 7. A tactual hallucination may be fully externalised, as in Miss\n. \\\n\fly^]\n'\nParanormal Cognition 73\nJephson's apparent handling of her cheque in Case 3, or partly exter-\nnalised, as in Case 7. All are constructs, and all are mediating vehicles,\nwhose function it is to bear some kind of message to consciousness.\nParanormal Cases. In examples 4 to 8 the view was taken that the\nknowledge mediated was obtained from faint, unnoticed registrations made\nby the normal senses. This explanation wore rather thin in Cases 7 and 8.\n9. The following case takes us over the border. I will call the per-\ncipient in this case Mrs \" Field \". Members of the Society will find\nher real name in Journal xxxi, 53. She says :\n\" Early in January I was\nstaying with my sister. The day before I left I had a letter from my\ndaughter R. in which I read, '\nNanny is in bed with bronchitis.' I read\nit out to my sister. I wrote to my daughter V. to tell her. When I got\nhome next day my first question was, '\nHow is Nanny? '\nR. : She's all\nright, I suppose. I : You said she was in bed with bronchitis. R. : No,\nI never said such a thing. Next morning I went to see how things were\nand found N. just out of bed and very sadly indeed, having had bronchitis.\nI : Miss R. told me you had had bronchitis. Miss R. ! But she didn't .\nknow! I wouldn't tell her to trouble her. Getting home I looked again\nat the letter. I knew exactly the place on the page where I had seen,\n'\nNanny is in bed with bronchitis '\n; it wasn't there or any\\vhere else in the\nletter, nor was there room in it for a single extra line. Nanny had been\ngreatly longing to see me to pour all out but wouldn't write, as I was on a\nholiday.\"\nThe motive in this case was of course Nanny's intense desire to see\nMrs Field and pour out her troubles to her, a motive which may have been\nintensified by having been repressed. Mrs Field's daughter says that\nNanny was \" rampant \" to see her mother. The mediating vehicle was a\nvisual hallucination of exactly the same kind as in Cases 2 and 3. The\nonly difference is that in this case the motive was in someone else's mind\nand not in that of the percipient. That makes the case paranormal. But\nthere is no difference in the psychological mechanism which mediates the\nidea to consciousness. That is no more paranormal in this case than it\nwas in the other^s. Indeed, if one compares Cases 3 and 9, the impression\nis strong that the paranormal element in 9 is only incidental. If it is\ndesirable that something be notified by the subliminal to the supraliminal,\nthe former just ignores the fact that sometimes the information may be in\nwhat we call \" another \" mind.\n10. A very similar case was reported in Journal xxvii, 326. Permis-\nsion to quote this has not been given, but members will find the case\nat this reference. The brief facts were that a person died in the night\nand her friend, living in another place, awoke in the morning to see a\npiece of paper lying on her pillow with a message on it saying that so-and-so\ndied last night. From the name given there could be no doubt about the\nperson meant. The paper and message were hallucinatory and vanished.\n11. All these cases illustrate the function of the mediating vehicle. .\nThe next case, however, tells us something else about it. A certain\nMrs B. {Journal x, 162) had a son H., who was in the army and in West\nAfrica. One night she dreamt that she saw a young sergeant look in at\nthe door of a room she seemed to be in, and she asked him, \" Where is\nH.? \" He replied, \" Don't be alarmed ;\nthey are carrying him along all\n\f74 The Modus Operandi of - [Part\nright. He has broken his leg. You cannot see him yet but you will bye\nand bye.\" The fact was that H. at the time was ill and was being carried\nin a palanquin. He became worse and died early the following month.\nBut he had not broken his leg. That accident had happened to him years\nbefore when he was five. So the dream, which was in this case the\nmediating vehicle, was called upon to do double duty, first to mediate to\nthe percipient's consciousness the paranormally acquired knowledge of her\nson's critical illness, and secondly to mediate a remembered fact which\nwas emotionally linked with it. Notice that the two facts, derived from\ndifferent sources, are not kept apart in the mediating vehicle. The young\nsergeant is made to weave the two facts into one and the same message.\nThus, different motives can make use of one mediating vehicle. This\nshows that we should be careful how we speak of a \" telepathic dream \".\nIt would be more correct to speak of a dream which contains a telepathic\nelement. Similarly telepathic experiments should be planned, not merely\nto yield a significant number of successes, but to afford a means of studying\nhow the successes are obtained. They should be planned to help us to\nstudy the formation of the mediating vehicle. Once its presence and\nfunction are grasped, we are saved from the mistake of regarding para-\nnormal cognition as a kind of \" sixth sense \" working in a way analogous\nto sense-perception.\nThere is no need to quote other examples of a mediating vehicle which\nhas been pressed into service for more than one purpose. The principle\ncan be seen in a large number of cases. We have merely to remember that\nthe mediating vehicle, like a taxi, can be shared by two or more passengers.\nThe above cases are all spontaneous. I will now quote an instance of\nexperimental paranormal cognition.\n12. A series of experiments in telepathy was tried by Dr S., a physician\nof San Francisco, and his wife, when the two were nearly a hundred\nmiles apart {Proc. xi, 455). The case was investigated by Richard Hodgson.\nAt a fixed time each day Dr and Mrs S. arranged to sit for thirty minutes\nfor telepathic results, each acting alternately as agent and percipient. The\nexperiment taken as a whole shows that chance cannot reasonably account\nfor the coincidences obtained (unless more potency is attributed to chance\nin a telepathic experiment than would be attributed to it in other connec-\ntions). Sorne of the results suggest precognition. A single day's record\nwill be sufficient for the present purpose :\n\" May 1 2th.\u2014 May 12th.\u2014Received.\nTransmitter, Mrs S.\nArrived safely. Pleasant Had a good trip, B. slept well. House\ntrip. B. feels fairly well. squarely built and plain ;\nporch sur-\nWe have a nice place in an rounded by trees ; not fronting the road ;\nold-fashioned house. rooms very sunny. [All accurate. What\nfollows was seen clairvoyantly, apparently.\nEd.] Landlady wears sunbonnet with\njacket of same. Little boy three years old.\n[Boy expected, but did not arrive until\nnext day. The description accurate.] Fire\nin north east. [Fire occurred next night.]\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 75\nThe mediating vehicle apparently took the form of visual hallucinations\nvery slightly externalised, for Dr S. says in' the course of his account that\neverything he received came to him in the form of mental pictures. The\nmotive, as in all experimental cases, was of course the desire to obtain a\ntelepathic result.\nOne thing shows clearly here, which it is of importance for anyone who\nexperiments in paranormal cognition to notice, and that is the large amount\nof veridical material which the percipient produced over and above that\nwhich the agent endeavoured to send. Some of these items were pre-\ncognitive. This shows that telepathy does not consist in the transmission\nof the conscious thoughts of the agent to the percipient. Any suggestion to\nthis effect that experiments in card-guessing and the like may present\nshould be regarded very critically. There is not sufficient content in the\ncard-guessing event to reveal this feature, which is further demonstrated\nin Case 13.\nThe process of mediation of paranormal cognition to consciousness by\nmeans of a mediating vehicle is precisely the same in experimental as in\nspontaneous cases. The event, if it is to be informative and not mis-\nleading, must possess a certain amount of qualitative content. The\nexperiments in telepathy carried out by Miss Miles and Miss Ramsden\n(Proc. xxi, 61) are well worthy of study from the point of view of medi-\nation. They show the often symbolical nature of the mediating vehicle\nand the part played by association of ideas in the formation of one\nvehicle after another. I shall not occupy space by quoting these experi-\nments here in detail, but would point out the necessity for carrying\nout experiments of this kind if we are to learn more about paranormal\ncognition.\nMany more cases, both spontaneous and experimental, could be quoted\nto illustrate the fundamental fact that paranormal cognition is mediated to\nconsciousness by means of psychological constructs. I began by quoting\neight cases in which these constructs were shown mediating subconscious\nknowledge which was not paranormal because it had been acquired (or so\nwe assumed) by normal means. I then passed to a case (No. 9) in which a\nprecisely similar construct mediated subconscious knowledge which was\nparanormal because it had been acquired from the mind of another person.\nThere was no difference whatever in the mechanism of mediation.\nExactly the same type of visual hallucination was employed, in the one\ncase as in the others. I then quoted a case in which the mediating vehicle,\nthis time a dream, conveyed a piece of paranormal knowledge and an old\nmemory at the same time. The same piece of mechanism embodied both.\nA study of these cases shows that there is a motive, or something com-\nparable with a motive, behind the creation of these vehicles or messengers\nto consciousness. In Case i this may have been an impulse to artistic\nexpression and a subconscious wish to give to the percipient a pleasure\nwhich he normally lacked ; in Cases 2 and 3 a fixed expectation found\nself-expression : in Cases 4, 5 and 6 the motive was a desire to warn\nagainst danger : in Cases 7 and 8 the motive was to satisfy the percipient's\nnormal interest : in Case 9 the motive was a suppressed desire to confide\na trouble to another. They are psychologically the same type of thing.\nThe fact that in Case 9 the motive originated in someone else's mind and not\n\f76 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nin that of the percipient seems to be incidental. It certainly carries us\nacross the partition which we place between the \" normal \" and the\n\" paranormal \" ; but it suggests at the same time that this partition may be\nartificial. When in Case 1 1 we find the same vehicle used to mediate both\nwhat we call the normal and the paranormal, this suggestion is intensified.\nIn any case, whether we choose to call the matter which is mediated normal\nor paranormal, it is clear that the mediating vehicle itself is in all cases\nnormal. It is produced by psychological mechanism which is an integral\nfactor in us all.\nApproached from the point of view which I have selected, paranormal\ncognition is clearly seen to consist of two quite distinct factors, (i) para-\nnormal cognition in its essence, which is a function of the subliminal self,\nof whose nature and processes consciousness knows nothing, and (2) the\nmediating vehicle, which is a psychological construct contrived by some\nfactor of the personality, which lies outside consciousness, in order to\nconvey to consciousness at second hand some knowledge of the genuine\nparanormal cognition.\nThis is the fundamental fact to bear in mind when formulating\nhypotheses about this faculty.\nIt is customary to speak as if we know that there are difierent kinds of\nparanormal cognition, [a) telepathy, [b) clairvoyance, (c) precognition and\n{d) retrocognition. But if the above facts are grasped, we shall realise that\nwe do not know anything about the nature of paranormal cognition itself.\nStarting with the assumption that there are these different subdivisions\nof the faculty, we may, by varying the conditions, appear to find support\nfor the view that one or other of them is operating separately. How\ncareful we have to be in drawing such conclusions will appear presently.\n13. A Simple Case of Paranormal Cognition.\nThe following case of paranormal cognition, which would on the face\nof it, be usually classed as a case of spontaneous telepathy, has been chosen\non account of its simplicity. It will be useful to examine it carefully.\nIt is, indeed, little use accumulating such cases unless we extract from\nthem what light we can on the processes involved. Can it be explained\nby telepathy? If so, by what sort of telepathy? Or can it be explained by\nclairvoyance, that is to say by a faculty of paranormal perception which\nreveals physical objects and events in a way which is comparable with that\nof normal sense-perception ?\nA certain lady, a Mrs Conner {Proc. vii, 35) when going up the steps of\nher house in Washington, D.C., stumbled and fell, her hat going one way\nand the papers she was carrying another. At or about the same time, a\nfriend of hers, a Mrs B., while sitting sewing in a room of her house a mile\nand a half away, had a waking vision of the accident. The separation in\ntime between the accident and the vision cannot have been more than an\nhour and was probably less than half an hour.\nMrs B.'s account, written on the evening of the day of the occurrence\n(which took place between 2 and 3 p.m.) and before she had heard of it, is\nas follows. \" I was sitting in my room sewing this afternoon about two\no'clock when what should I see but your own dear self ; but Heavens!\nin what a position. Now, I don't want to excite your curiosity too much,\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 77\nor try your patience too long, so will come to the point at once. You were\nfalling up the front steps in the yard. You had on your black skirt and\nvelvet waist, your little straw bonnet and in your hand were some papers.\nWhen you fell your hat went in one direction and your papers in another.\nYou got up very quickly, put on your bonnet, picked up the papers and lost\nno time in getting into the house. You did not appear to be hurt but looked\nsomewhat mortified. It was all so plain to me that I had ten notions to one\nto dress myself and come over and see if it were true, but finally concluded\nthat a sober, industrious woman like yourself would not be stumbling\naround at that rate and thought I'd best not go on a wild goose chase.\nNow, what do you think of such a vision as that.' Is there any possible\ntruth in it? I feel almost ready to scream with laughter whenever I think\nof it ;\nyou did look too funny spreading yourself out in the front yard.\n'\nGreat was the fall thereof.' I can distinctly call to mind the house in\nwhich you live, but for the life of me I cannot tell whether there are any\nsteps from the side walk into the yard, as I saw them or not. Now do tell\nme, dear, if I saw correctly or not, or if the thing was shown me simply to\ngive me something to laugh about.'\n\"\nIn reply to questions, Mrs Conner affirmed that the description of her\nclothing was quite correct ; that when she fell on the steps the time was\nalmost exactly nineteen minutes to three. Mrs B. did not notice the exact\ntime, but states that her experience occurred \" about two o'clock \". The\ntwo events were probably not separated in time by more than forty\nminutes and may have been more nearly coincident. An experience so\nvivid that the percipient sat down at once to write an account of it, co-\ninciding with the event in such detail and so nearly in time, cannot reason-\nably be attributed to chance. Also the vision was not a dream but a rare\nwaking experience. Mrs B. was not familiar with the house as Mrs\nConner had only moved into it a few days before.\nThis is a simple case of apparent telepathy ; but we have also to consider\nwhether it might not be a case of clairvoyance. Regarding it as a case of\ntelepathy, we are confronted at once with a difficulty. Mrs B., in this\nvision which was \" all so plain \" to her, saw Mrs Conner as the latter\nwould have appeared to an outside observer standing nearby at one par-\nticular point in space. But no one is consciously aware with any degree of\naccuracy of his detailed appearance as an outside observer would see it.\nPeople who, by means of an arrangement of mirrors, see themselves from\nunwonted angles, are often much surprised at their own appearance.\nIt is not in the least likely\u2014in fact it is impossible\u2014that Mrs Conner, even\nhad she been a superlative artist, could, without the aid of mirrors, have\npainted a portrait of herself exactly in every detail as Mrs B. saw her in\nthe vision. No one knows consciously all the details needed to make such\na picture. Can we suppose that these details are known subconsciously\nand can be telepathically transmitted to a percipient.' I think if we\nassume subconscious knowledge of the full details of anyone's personal\nappearance as seen from one particular point in space, we must assume that\nthis knowledge also extends to every other view-point. This would imply\nsubconscious knowledge of an infinite amount of detail, all so precise and\nclear that when objectified in sensory hallucinations the result is in-\ndistinguishable from normal percepts. This is surely a large order. In\n\f78 The Modus Operandi of [Part\naddition, there is the evidence of the cases already cited that it is the per-\ncipient who constructs these hallucinations ; and we know that they may\nbe partly symbolical in character and need not by any means faithfully\nportray the real details. In the light of this it seems more likely that the\nsubliminal self of the agent is not aware of an unlimited quantity of detail,\nbut is aware of his bodily appearance in some more general fashion, and\nthat the percipient is able to abstract from this general knowledge the\nspecific and limited aspect he requires.\nIt may help us here to remember that we think of the world about us in\none way and perceive it in another. We think of it in terms of propositions :\nwe perceive it in terms of sensory images. Suppose that -Y, a friend of\nours, is about to leave London, we think : X is now in Paddington\nstation. That is a proposition which we cannot convert, as such, into\nsensory terms. We cannot see X in Paddington station with the degree of\ngenerality that the propositional statement implies. We can see him only\nin much more restricted ways, at the booking-office, or at some particular\nspot on the platform, or getting into the train. And we can see him in any\none of these positions from an indefinite number of points of view. But\nwe cannot, by the use of our senses, perceive the propositional situation\nthat we think of. That propositional situation comprises an infinite set\nof disjunctive sense-situations. It is by means of sense-perception alone\nthat we become aware of the surrounding physical world ; that is to\nsay, knowledge of the world we live in, as we gain it, is of a much more\nlimited, piecemeal and unintegrated kind than is thought.\nNow, the direction in which it seems to me that the evidence for para-\nnormal cognition points is that the subliminal self is capable of something\nwhich is more like an immediate awareness of propositions than it is like\nsense-perception. I do not wish this statement to be taken too literally.\nIt is only a groping attempt to get a little nearer to the truth. Quite\npossibly the nature of paranormal cognition is beyond our understanding.\nThe proposition, \" X is in Paddington station now,\" covers {a) an\ninfinite number of physical situations, any one of which X might be\noccupying now in the station, and {b) each one of which could give rise to\nan infinite number of groups of sense-data, since in each position he\noccupies. A' may be sensed in an infinite number of ways. Also, {c) X in\nany one of these physical situations could be represented by any one of an\ninfinite number of sets of mental images or hallucinatory pictures.\nI suggest that Mrs Conner's subliminal self was aware of her bodily\nappearance and situation in a way analogous to an awareness of a proposi-\ntion, and that in this way the awareness was shared by the subliminal self\nof Mrs B. This subliminal sharing constitutes telepathy. But this\npropositional awareness must be of such a nature as to be able to supply\nthe materials out of which any one of an infinite number of hallucinatory\nrepresentations of itself can be constructed. Mrs B. subconsciously\nconstructed one of these and presented it to her own consciousness.\nThat I am being vague about the nature of this propositional awareness,\nand also about the way in which it contains, potentially, an infinite number '\nof specific, hallucinatory self-representations of itself, I freely admit. All .,\nI say is that the evidence seems to me to point in this direction. The\npropositional awareness need not be mediated to consciousness by means\n\fParanormal Cognition 79\nof a sensory hallucination. As we saw in Case 5, it may be by an impulse :\nit may also be by means of words. In automatic speech and writing the\nmediating vehicle assumes a verbal form.\nIt might, perhaps, be urged against the view I have suggested that in a\nverbal form the mediating vehicle would be itself propositional. But are\nthere not propositions of varying degrees of generality, and may not the\ngenerality of a verbal mediating vehicle be of a lesser degree than the\ngenerality of the subliminal knowledge which it mediates?\nWe thus see that if telepathy is the explanation of this simple spon-\ntaneous case, it is a telepathy which is very dilferent from thought-\ntransference as usually understood. It was not Mrs Conner's conscious\nthoughts which were transmitted to Mrs B. but a general, subconscious\nawareness which we are far from understanding. That Mrs Conner was\nconsciously aware of her situation was an attendant feature of the case,\nwhich may have been quite irrelevant. Certainly a conscious intention\nto produce telepathy is not essential to its production ;\nfor Mrs Conner\ndid not intend to make herself visible to Mrs B., and in the numerous\nspontaneous cases of telepathy, the intention to produce it is as a rule\nabsent. We must not, therefore, approach experimental telepathy with\nthe idea that the conscious thought of the agent impresses itself on the\npercipient. The most that we can legitimately assume is that the desire\non the part of both agent and percipient to produce a result has some\ndirectional effect on the process. I shall in future call the kind of tele-\npathy, or thought-transference, in which the agent's conscious thoughts\nare supposed to be transmitted to the percipient \" naive telepathy \".\nCan we explain Case 13 by means of clairvoyance? This would mean\nthat Mrs B. paranormally perceived Mrs Conner's prostrate body as it lay\non the steps. This suggestion meets with a difficulty at once. The case\nis a spontaneous one and therefore Mrs B. knew nothing about it before-\nhand, or at the time, until she experienced the vision. Supposing, there-\nfore, that she possessed a clairvoyant faculty which was capable of revealing\nto her physical objects, what was there to direct the faculty to this par-\nticular object? Had she received a telepathic message from Mrs Conner,\nthat would have enabled her to direct her supposed clairvoyant faculty to\nMrs Conner's body? But if we assume telepathy there is no need to\nassume clairvoyance. Having defined the clairvoyant faculty as a form of\nsense-perception, we cannot endow it with a power of self-direction which\nenables it to seek out particular situations which have the appearance of\nbeing telepathic. A clairvoyant faculty, as defined, might just as well\nhave lit upon any other physical object as upon Mrs Conner's body at the\nprecise moment when it lay on the steps of her house.\nIt may be, however, that we ought to allow that if there is such a thing\nas a clairvoyant faculty, it might have a particular habit of browsing among\nthe physical things which particularly interested Mrs B. I am not quite\nsure to what extent we could assume that the faculty could do this without\nbeing consciously directed by its owner. We do have to direct our vision\nconsciously to this or that object. Perhaps it might not be quite the same\nwith clairvoyance. But let us suppose that the clairvoyant faculty is\nconfined to those physical objects and events which particularly interested\nMrs B. It will then be equally likely to fall at any moment on any one of\n\f8o The Modus Operandi of [Part\nMrs B.'s friends, on any one of her books, papers, household possessions\nor the distant things and places which interest her. It was a remarkable\ncoincidence if it fell on Mrs Conner at the precise moment when it looked\nas if she might be in a position to send a telepathic message to her friend.\nAnd again, if it is equally likely to fall on any of the objects which interest\nMrs B., it must surely have fallen on many such objects again and again.\nWhere are the sudden visions of her relations in all sorts of positions, of her\nbooks, of her silver spoons, of her bank-book, of her furniture and of a\nhundred other things? How is it, if it is due to clairvoyance, that this\nvision of Mrs Conner is almost unique in her experience.'' This case of\nMrs Conner's does not differ from dozens of other examples of apparent\nspontaneous telepathy. Such cases evidently cannot be explained by\nclairvoyance, because clairvoyance, if it is to explain them, would need\ntelepathy to direct it.\nWhile we are considering this case, it will be as well to examine another\nhypothesis, that of a non-physical body which can travel through space.\nThe idea that there is such a body has given rise to the term \" travelling\nclairvoyance \". In spiritualist circles it is usually referred to as the\n\" etheric \" body. Whether there is in fact a non-physical body of some\nkind is really a separate question from whether such a body could explain\nthe facts of apparent telepathy or apparent clairvoyance. With regard to\nthe latter problem, can we suppose that there is a non-physical body which\ntravels through physical space and perceives (or causes its owner to per-\nceive) a physical object or scene at a distant place.' Mrs B.'s non-physical\nbody must have disengaged itself from her material body and travelled a\nmile and a half through physical space to look at Mrs Conner's material\nbody. Anything which can travel through space must have a position in\nspace, since to travel is to change spatial position. But how can a non-\nmaterial body occupy a definite position in space.' How would you\nmeasure the number of inches to a non-material body from the four walls\nof a room? If the body is non-material, there is nothing to define the\nposition of its outline. With what speed does the body travel? This is a\nlegitimate question, since it is said to travel through space. What propels\nit? By what means does it steer a definite course to its destination? Why,\nif non-material bodies are sometimes observable, are they never observed\nen route} And when the non-physical body arrives, what happens? How\nis the object seen? Do physical light-rays enter the non-physical eyes of\nthe body and produce non-physical effects on its non-physical organs and\nbrain ? Surely physical light-rays must produce physical effects on physical\nobjects. And even if the non-physical brain is affected, why should that\nproduce the same sensations in the mind of its owner as are produced by\neffects in the physical brain? It seems that we must postulate a non-\nphysical space for the non-physical body to travel in and non-physical\nlight-rays to affect it, while these non-physical light-rays must be reflected\nfrom non-physical duplicates of the physical objects perceived\u2014in fact\nthe physical body and the physical world must be provided with non-\nphysical duplicates. Everything physical must have a non-physical\nparallel down to the last detail. It is true that we must not reject a\nhypothesis because it is strange ; but can we really duplicate the entire\nphysical world and then put \" non \" before it? Besides, there is another\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition . 81\nfact which points against this space-traveUing view. The distant scene is\nnot by any means always seen accurately. There was a case in which a\nclairvoyant was asked to give the position of the body of a person who had\nbeen drowned in a lake. She said that if one stood at given position\non the bank, the body would be found so many yards to the left.\nActually the distance given was correct, but the body was to the right.\nThis sort of thing points much more to the creation of a scene which\nrepresents the events than to any direct vision of them. Of course a\nsubject who has the experience of seeing a distant scene has the feeling of\nbeing physically present there, just as a spectator of a film depicting scenes\nin a distant country has to a certain extent the feeling of being there and\nwould have that feeling much more strongly if the film were able to present\nthe scene in three dimensions as extending all round him. But this feeling\nis not necessarily veridical.\nThe most plausible hypothesis to account for Case 13 is the telepathic\nhypothesis ;\nyet it is a telepathy which is not like thought-transference.\nThe clairvoyant hypothesis we have found untenable ; and also the\nhypothesis of a non-physical body which travels through physical space.\nA More Complex Case of Paranormal Cognition.\n14. A complex reciprocal case, which is often quoted {Proc. vii, 41 ), is that\nof Mr and Mrs Wilmot. The essential facts are that Mr Wilmot was\nvoyaging home to America in a ship in which he shared a peculiarly\nshaped cabin with a companion, a Mr Tait. One night he \" dreamt \" (at\nany rate he calls it a dream) that he saw his wife, who was then in bed in\nher home in the United States, come to the cabin door, pause irresolutely\non the threshold as if embarrassed by the sight of a stranger in the cabin,\nthen advance to his bedside and caress him. This scene was also witnessed\nby Mr Tait, who was awake, and was occupying the berth above Mr\nWilmot. So real was Mr Tait's vision that he challenged his companion\nin the morning with having received a visit from a real woman. On\narriving home, Mr Wilmot discovered that on that very night his wife had\nhad the experience of seeming to travel across the ocean to a ship, of\nentering a cabin, whose peculiar shape she described, and of visiting her\nhusband in the manner he had experienced. She was also aware of the\npresence of Mr Tait in the upper berth.\nCan this case be explained by clairvoyance? Mrs Sidgwick when\ndealing with the case remarks : \"I should still hold with Mr Gurney\nthat this [the fact that Mrs Wilmot had tried to establish voluntarily\ncommunication with her husband at the time of the experience] is no\nreason for regarding the incident as other than telepathic, for there is as\nlittle ground for supposing that Mrs Wilmot could have perceived psychi-\ncally any cabin as there is for thinking that Mrs Paquet [a case previously\nquoted] could have had a vision of any death-scene. In other words, it is\nprobable that the presence of the husband and brother respectively were\nessential conditions of the percipience, which, therefore, depended on\nsome unknown process of communication from mind to mind. The\nfact that Mr Wilmot at the same time dreamt of his wife seems to me,\nif anything to strengthen the telepathic hypothesis because it shows that\nthere was actually a community of mental impressions.\" This is precisely\n\f82 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nthe point we have been discussing. Without guidance, the clairvoyant\nfaculty would never have hit upon the appropriate target at the appropriate\nmoment ; and how could this guidance have been given without telepathy?\nThe clairvoyant explanation of this case involves the preposterous view\nthat three clairvoyant faculties, belonging to Mr Wilmot, Mrs Wilmot\nand Mr Tait, respectively, all converged upon the same scene at the same\nmoment without anything to direct them. Clairvoyance as an explanation\nis surely here out of the question.\nIt is true that this case, when superficially regarded, does suggest a\ntravelling, non-physical body. We have seen the difficulties this view\ninvolves ; but it is worth while bearing it in mind while we look at some\nfurther examples of paranormal cognition.\n15. Mr J. Kirk carried out some experiments in which he tried to make\nhimself visible to a distant percipient {Journal \\, 21-30). He was successful\nin doing this : the percipient saw his apparition. As Mr Kirk sat in his\nroom acting as agent in these experiments, his attention was attracted by a\nstrong disc of light coming from the under part of the lamp-shade. This\nwas so conspicuous that he thought he would try fixing his attention on it.\nHe did this, and the percipient then saw a luminous cloud which con-\ncentrated into a bright disc. Here we see that, without any change of\nmethod, a case of apparitional appearance changes into an ordinary case of\nexperimental telepathy. Some would regard the appearance of Mr Kirk's\napparition in a distant room as proof of his non-physical body having\ntravelled there. Would they say that when he concentrated his attention\non the disc of light from the lamp that its non-physical body travelled\nthere as well.' Would they say that in every telepathic experiment the non-\nphysical body of the object thought about travels to the percipient.'\nIf not, is it not clear that in all cases, whether the percipient perceives\nan inanimate object or a human being, what he perceives is his own\nunconscious construct} It may be fully externalised and appear to\noccupy a place in the room ; or it may be only partially externalised ; or\nit may be merely a mental image. In all cases it is a construct and acts^\nas a mediating vehicle to consciousness.\nIn the Wilmot case I suggest that it is the same. All the visual hallucina-\ntions, whether of the cabin or its occupants or of Mrs Wilmot herself, were\nconstructs. There was no real travelling through space, and no clairvoyant\nperception of physical objects. If we must classify these cases, they were\ntelepathic in the sense that there was no paranormal perception of physical\nobjects or e\\ ents. But, although in a sense telepathic, they were not cases\nof simple thought-transference.\nA Further Difficulty for Clairvoyance.\n16. Another difficulty which confronts us when we try to explain cases of\nostensible telepathy by clairvoyance is the fact that the event sometimes\ntakes place a good deal earlier than the percipient's experience. Mrs\nPaquet's case afl^ords an example of this (Proc. vii, 32). She had a vision\nof the death of her brother, complete with veridical details, about six\nhours after it occurred. If clairvoyance is a kind of paranormal sense-\nperception, it must surely reveal what is happening in the present and not\nwhat has happened in the past. To account for its presenting the past,\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 83\nwe should have to suppose that the act of perception was subconsciously\nperformed at the time of the event, and that it was iitted with a delay-\naction which only allowed it to reach consciousness at some later period.\nBut this would in reality take away from clairvoyance the character of\nbeing a perceptual sense, which is given to it by definition. It could no\nlonger be held that the percipient, by means of clairvoyance, perceives a\ndistant physical event. It would have to be admitted that what he con-\nsciously perceives is a hallucinatory scene constructed for him here and\nnow. In other words clairvoyance becomes, not a faculty of perception,\nbut a mechanism for mediating and relaying to consciousness knowledge\nwhich has been acquired we know not how. As such, it is no longer\n\" clairvoyance \" as that faculty is defined. I shall in future refer to\nclairvoyance, defined as a faculty of paranormal perception of physical\nobjects and events, as \" naive clairvoyance \".\nThe time-lag, which so often accompanies paranormal cognition, seems\nequally difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis of a travelling, non-\nphysical body.\n17. \" Travelling Clairvoyance \".\nSome of the most suggestive evidence in paranormal cognition occurs\nunder the heading of \" travelling clairvoyance \". Most of this evidence\nhas been obtained with a particular kind of subject who passes easily into\nlight hypnosis. One of these sensitives, called \" Jane \", was \" mesmer-\nised \" at intervals during a long period from 1845 onwards for the sake of\nher health. Jane was by all accounts a simple and honest woman, the\nwife of a Durham pitman, and her case was witnessed by the Rev. C.\nGreen and his two sisters, one of whom married a cousin of F. W. H.\nMyers. The latter, who was interested in the case, says that Jane never\nreceived any fee or made any exhibition of her faculty, which she concealed\nas much as she could {Proc. vii, 53). When in the hypnotic state, Jane\nwould begin to talk in childish language and would ask to \" travel \".\nDr F., who hypnotised her by looking at her steadfastly, was the principal\nwitness. Jane was a sensitive who naturally, and without any elaborate\nprocess of being hj'pnotised, fell into a suggestible state. When in it, she\ncould be verbally directed to \" go \" to any desired place and to describe\nwhat she saw there. The value of such a sensitive for research does not\nseem to have been realised at the time, and the case was not as carefully\nconducted as it should have been. Dr F. 's notes were not taken with\nsufficient care. Still, Jane did just the same kind of thing as is recorded of\nseveral other sensitives of the same type. When \" hypnotised \" (though\nthe state seems to have been more like spontaneous trance) and told to go\nto a certain house and report what was going on there, Jane did so with a\nconsiderable degree of success, though she also produced a certain amount\nof failure. She was verbally directed from point to point in an imaginary\njourney by the investigator, and questioned as to what she saw as she\nprogressed. The scenes she perceived were extremely real to her. We\nread that \" in the spirit she still feels in a body and expects people to see\nher and resents being jostled by a crowd, was nearly run over by horses\nand a carriage. Once when told to go and see a friend, she called out,\n'\nWhat a rude man, he has nearly run over me with his prancing horses.\n'\n\"\n1\n\f84 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nWe are told that she did not know the man with the prancing horses, who\nactually lived in the south of England while Jane lived in the north ; but\nishe described his profession of homoeopathic medicine, and when she\nreached his front door, read the name \" Williams \" correctly on the door-\npost.\nIn one house to which she was told to go, she described a cradle which\nwas rocking with no one near it. It turned out that the baby had a habit of\nrocking itself. In another house she read the word \" Salve \" on the tiles\noutside the door ; and in case after case she described details which she\ndid not normally know, and which could not reasonably be ascribed to\nchance.\nOn one occasion Dr F. tried an experiment with a patient of his, Mr\nEglinton, which shows how experiments in paranormal cognition could be\nplanned with this kind of subject, which might throw real light on its\nnature. He told this patient to be in a particular room in his own house\nat a certain time. Jane was then verbally led to the house and, on her own\ninitiative, supplied correct details of the surroundings on the way, which\nsupplemented those she was told of. For example, she asked :\n\" Is it\nthe red house with a brass knocker? \" Dr F. replied ;\n\" No, it has an iron\nknocker.\" But, he adds, that he afterwards looked and found that the door\nhad an old-fashioned brass handle in the shape of a knocker.\nDirected to Mr Eglinton's room, Jane described a very fat man with a\ncork leg coming into the room and seating himself at the table with papers\nbefore him and a glass of brandy and water. Asked if she could see his\nname on any of the letters, she spelt out letter by letter the word \" Eglin-\nton \". Dr F. thought the whole of this description wrong, because Mr\nEglinton was very thin and had no cork leg. Actually it was, in a curious\nway, true ; for Mr Eglinton had made a dummy by stuffing his clothes\nto produce the appearance of a very fat man and had seated the dummy at\nthe table with the papers and the brandy and water as described. Jane was\nfirm on the point that it was brandy in the glass and no other liquid. She\ntook the dummy for a living man with a cork leg. There was no cork leg ;\nbut the mode of representation supports the view that the whole scene was\na sensory construct, the cork leg being inserted as a kind of compromise\nbetween the superficial inference that the man was alive and the deeper\nknowledge that the figure was counterfeit. Jane's spelling of the name\n\" Eglinton \" was correct, whereas Dr F. had thought till then that it was\nspelt \" Eglington \".\nThere is no suggestion in all this that Jane's non-physical body travelled\nto Mr Eglinton's house and took up a post of observation in his room. The\ninformation was all paranormally accessible in the knowledge of Dr F.\nand Mr Eglinton, and the scene could easily have been a sensory construc-\ntion. But there is still the question of whether the information was\nacquired from these two minds or by naive clairvoyance. The false details\nof the fat man coming into the room by the door, and the cork leg perhaps\ntell a little against the clairvoyant view ; but the question needs much more\nconsideration. On either the telepathic or the clairvoyant view, it must,\nI think, be agreed that what Jane saw was a constructed vision of the type\nwe call \" hallucinatory \" ; that is to say it was what I have called a\n\" mediating vehicle \".\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition '\n85\nI do not wish to lay too much stress on the \" Jane \" case, since it is not\nas strong evidentially as might be wished. But Dr Alfred Backman, of\nKalmar in Sweden {Proc. vii. 199-220 and 370-73) carried out experiments\nwith several subjects of a similar type to Jane, and there seems to be no\nreasonable doubt that he was a careful and conscientious investigator.\nHe was visited in 1891 by F. W. H. Myers, Dr A. T. Myers, Prof. Richet\nand M. Houdaille, who were allowed to witness and to conduct certain\nexperiments. F. Myers says :\n\" Perhaps the most important outcome of\nour visit was the conviction that all of us gained as to the absolute candour\nand disinterested desire for truth with which Dr Backman 's experiments\nare conducted and the simplicity and good faith of the subjects whom he\nemploys.\"\nBackman's sensitives were Anna Samuelsson, Alma Radberg, Miss\nH. L., Ebba Lundberg, Hilda Ljunggren, Agda Olsen and \" Cecilia \".\nThey mostly came to him as patients. It is noteworthy that he says :\n\" In\nthe first place I have found that unless I have been unusually fortunate in\nmeeting with clairvoyants, they are not so rare as is generally supposed.\nOn the contrary, a great number of persons capable of being hypnotised\nhave clairvoyant faculties.\" It is extraordinary that this hint should\nnever have been followed up by those who later made experiments in\nparanormal cognition.\n18. Alma Radberg, when \" lightly hypnotised \", was given a folded\nletter written in French, a language she did not know, and at once\ndescribed the writer and, in general terms, the contents of the letter.\n\" Alma was then awakened ; but (as usual with Dr Backman's subjects)\nshe remembered her trance-sensations, and was able to add further\ndetails.\" We are told that the description of the writer of the letter was\n\" practically correct \" and the gist of the letter was also true. Like \" Jane \",\nBackman's sensitives were directed verbally. The conditions for investi-\ngating \" extra-sensory perception \", or paranormal cognition, were almost\nperfect. Not only could Alma describe what she saw while in her light\nhypnotic trance, but she could amplify her descriptions after waking.\n19. Another subject, Anna Samuelsson, was directed to \" go to\nKalmar \", 13 miles away, and to go to Backman's house there. She\ndescribed the town and the house and its inmates, seeing a little boy\n\" double \". There v.'ere actually twins in the house. She then described\na young girl so exactly that Backman recognised a Miss H. W., whom he\nhad not supposed to be in the house. It was afterwards revealed that she\nwas not, but that his wife had been speaking to her at the time on the\ntelephone.\nAnna was \" led \" in the usual verbal way to the house of the Quarter-\nmaster and described correctly who was there and what the Quarter-\nmaster was doing, mentioning a long stick leaning against the wall.\nLottery numbers were foretold and half were right.\nAlma Radberg is described as being a pious and good girl with some\nintelligence and not hysterical, but highly suggestible both when awake\nand when hypnotised. She was so suggestible that it is stated that a blister\nwas produced on her skin by cold water, which, it was suggested, was\nburning sealing wax.\nAlma was usually asked to describe the interiors of distant houses and to\n\f86 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nsay what was going on there. She was \" sent \" to the house of the Director\nGeneral of Pilotage at Stockholm, where neither she nor Dr Backman\nhimself nor his wife, who was present, had ever been. She described the\ninterior of the principal room minutely and correctly. She then described\nthe house of Captain Smith in Norrkoping. After waking, she described\nthese two houses still more distinctly.\nOn another occasion. Alma was \" sent \" to the Director General's\nhouse at Stockholm while he was there. She saw a bunch of keys on his\ntable and was told to shake them and to put her hand on his shoulder.\nThis was repeated two or three times. The Director General, before he\nheard of the experiment, said that his attention had been fixed on the day\nand hour because he had then had a strange experience. While occupied\nwith his work, he began to notice the keys. Then he caught a glimpse of a\nwoman. This was repeated, and he got up to look but found no one there.\nThe keys did not rattle or move. He discovered that no woman had really\nbeen in the room.\nIn another experiment. Alma was asked to describe a prepared room at\nStockholm, and the people who were in it. A pair of scissors had been\nhung by a rubber otoscope from the chandelier, which Alma described\napproximately. She got the number of persons in the room right and\nsome other things wrong, but correctly described some of the furniture.\nDr Backman says that he sent his notes about the experiments made to\nDr Kjellman at Stockholm before he knew anything about the results, and\nthese notes were sent to the Editor of the S.P.R. Proceedings.\nTwo subjects together, Alma and Miss H. L., tried to describe the\ninterior of a prepared room in Stockholm. Miss H. L.'s statements were\nall wrong, and Alma's were only partly right. It is worth while noticing\nthe vague kinds of approach which Alma makes to the appearance of the\nobjects in the room. For example a dead hen with a silver spoon in its\nbill had been placed on a tray. Alma says : \"on one corner of the table\nthere was a tray with small objects on it, long and yellow \". The hen was\nyellow in colour. (See Proc. vii, 210-1.) All this suggests the creation of\nmediating vehicles which only approximately convey the paranormal\nknowledge.\nIn one experiment a paper with the word Hiitid written on it was placed\nin his room by Dr Kjellman at a certain time every day for a week, and\nAlma was asked to try to read it ivithout being hypnotised. Under these\nconditions, she only got the first letter, H.\nAgda Olsen, another sensitive of the same type, also remembered her\nhypnotic experiences after waking. There had been a murder, and Agda\nwas told to see the murder, the murderer, his house and his motive. She\ngave a fairly detailed account of these, afterwards corroborated by the\npolice. One statement, that a certain church could be seen from the\nmurderer's house, was said by the police to be incorrect. But Agda\nsaid :\n\" The church of Wissefjerda is situated obliquely on your right\nwhen you are standing in the passage.\" Backman says that this statement\nis correct as to the bearing of the church. Agda did not say that it could be\nseen from there.\nWhen told to look in a crystal, Agda saw several things correctly.\nThere is an interesting account of an achievement by another sensitive\n\fjyj] Paranormal Cognition 87\nof the same type, Cecilia. A tiny silver revolver had been apparently\nhopelessly lost in the sand. Cecilia was suggested with the idea that she\nwould be able to go and find it. She did so and brought it.\nF. W. H. Myers and his party were not able to be with the sensitives\nlong enough to overcome their shyness in the presence of strangers.\nNevertheless they had two successes which they^ described as being\n\" decidedly corroborative of Dr Backman's results \".\nAt the beginning of his account, Dr Backman says :\n\"The experiments\nto be recorded do not claim to be considered strictly scientific, but 1\ndescribe them simply as I have made them, in the hope that others may be\nincited to carry out similar attempts in a more systematic and scientific\nmanner than my practical occupations have given me time for.\" {Proc. vii\n109.) This was written not later than 189 1. It is extraordinary that\nscarcely any attempt should have been made since that date by our Society\nto carry out experimental work on these lines.\nOther experiments, somewhat casual in type, but all of the same kind,\nare the following.\nMr T Criswick {Proc. vii, 94) said :\n\" I tried to send some persons to\nsleep, etc. by gazing into their eyes, by passes from the head downwards,\netc and found several sensitive. One of those that was susceptible to the\ninfluence was a Miss R. After falling into the so-called mesmeric sleep,\nit was easy to induce her to talk, to get up, etc., and in her, as well as in\nothers, I was always struck by the improvement of expression during the .\nsleep.\" He used verbal direction.\n1, j t?\nMr J. J. T. Glover {Proc. vii, 95) hypnotised a young man called Cr. .\nand obtained results by verbal direction.\n\u201e , r- - j\nMr H T. Humphreys {Proc. vii, 96) hypnotised a man called bdward\nMaguire. He says :\n\" I put him to sleep, and it then occurred to me to\ntry if he were clairvoyant.\" He was ; and \" went \" where directed.\nMrs Stella of Chieri {Proc. vii, 99) describes a visit to a sensitive who\nwas placed in a\n\" state of trance or mesmeric sleep \", and described her\nstepson with details when given some of his hair as a psychometric object\nThere is also the remarkable Mexican sensitive, Senora Z., who worked\nentirely with psychometric objects and who was visited and examined by\nDr Walter Prince {Proc. A.S.P.R. xv, 189-314 and xvi).\nAn important feature of these experiments lies in the mistakes and\ninaccuracies of the sensitives. They are helpful in the study of the con-\nstruction of the mediating vehicle. In Case 19 Anna described a woman\nas present in a house when she was really 20 kilometres away and was\nspeaking on the telephone. Here it looks as if the constructor of the\nmediating vehicle, when in uncertain touch with paranormal knowledge,\nwas influenced by a rationalising faculty or by inference, and allowed this\nfaculty to play a part in the construction of the mediating vehicle. All this\nis very unlike naive clairvoyance. The next case is interesting from this\npoint of view. .. .\n20. An experiment was tried by Dr A. S. Wiltse {Proc. vu, 77) with a\nsensitive named Fannie G. A man, well known in the part of Kansas\nwhere he lived, as Uncle Julian Scott, had ridden into the Emerald River\nand been drowned. Fannie G. was a servant girl whom Dr Wiltse\ndescribes as being \" an excellent subject for hypnotism\". Having hypno-\n\f88 The Modus Operandi of [Part\ntised Fannie, Dr Wiltse asked her what had become of Uncle Julian. He\ndirected her verbally to the river, and took her slowly along it in an imag-\ninary boat, telling her to look down into the water. At a certain place\nshe said there was a hat. \" Soon after this she announced an object near\nthe left bank of the stream and asked to be paddled over there. Then asked\nif we did not see an old tree-body under the water near the bank. Q. :\n'\nAll right! Here we are! '\n.... :\n'\nWhat is it Fannie.? '\nF, :\n'\nSome\nbig dark thing ; I can't see what. There is a saddle there. Don't you\nsee it? '\nQ. :\n'\nYes, Fannie, what else.?' F. :\n'\nSomething, but I can't\nsee it good ; the water is muddy. The saddle is there. I can see it, and\none stirrup is gone.' Q. :\n'\nAll right. Can you see anything on the bank\nthat we may know the spot as we come back? '\nF. :\n'\nWhy, of course.\nDon't you see how the sand is worked up in that low spot around the roots\nof that tree?' \" All this is not very valuable as evidence for paranormal\ncognition, for Wiltse does not seem to be quite sure that the saddle was\never found in the place described although it was generally supposed to\nhave been. But it is evidence of the circumstantial realism which the ex-\nperiences had from the percipient's point of view. It has the appearance\nof clairvoyance.\nWiltse himself, however, witnesses to the accuracy of the rest of Fannie's\nstatements. They passed down the river on their imaginary journey until\nFannie said :\n\" '\nIt will be no use ever to look below right here! '\nQ. :\n'\nAll\nright, Fannie. We will go back, but first show us some mark by which we\nshall remember the place, can you? ' '\nWhy, don't you see? '\nshe ex-\nclaimed in a tone of seeming disgust. Q. :' What is it, Fannie? '\nF. :\n' Oh,\ndon't you see that tall bridge? '\nQ. :\n'\nWhere, Fannie? '\nF. :\n'\nWhy,\nright there! We just now passed under it, right there it is.' \" There was\nonly one bridge across the Emerald River in those parts, an iron railway\nbridge, which Dr Wiltse says he was sure Fannie had never seen. It was\nat a wild and almost inaccessible spot in the mountains several miles\naway. When asked what kind of a bridge it was Fannie said it looked as if\nit were made of iron. The body was actually found some dscys, later by a\ntrain-hand, who saw it from a train crossing the bridge. It had lodged\nupon an old drift just below the bridge. So Fannie was right in saying\nthat it would be useless to look for it lower down the river. This looks like\nclairvoyance. But the interesting part of the case is yet to come. As\nFannie was being verbally directed home again after her imaginary voyage\non the river, a rumour was started that the body had been recovered and\ntaken to the house of Uncle Julian Scott's son. This rumour was whis-\npered to Dr Wiltse. Thereupon, in order to try an experiment, he said to\nFannie :\n\" Let's go into the Scott's and warm.\" Fannie agreed, and when\nshe seemed to herself to have entered the house, she said :\n\" Why, they\nhave found Uncle Julian and got him laid out.\" She then described the\nrelatives and friends who were there, and how they were crying, etc.\nThe whole of this scene, just as apparently real to Fannie as the river\nscene, must have been obtained telepathically from the minds of the by-\nstanders, as there was no truth in it. But Fannie knew nothing of any\nchange in the source of her information. Can we really suppose that in the\nriver scene Fannie was clairvoyantly seeing the physical peculiarities and\ndetails of the river by a kind of paranormal sight, while in the Scott's\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition \"\n89\nhouse she was witnessing a scene constructed to convey a general but\nerroneous beUef in peoples' minds? Surely it is clear that in both cases\nwe are dealing with the same process, the creation of a hallucinatory\nmediating vehicle which conveys information somehow held by the\nsubliminal self or selves of those concerned. Whether we call it \" clair-\nvoyance \" or \" telepathy \" is a matter of choice ; but it is not naive\nclairvoyance or naive telepathy\u2014it is neither thought-transference\nbetween conscious minds nor paranormal perception of physical objects.\nWe do not know what paranormal cognition is behind the mediating\nprocess, which is all that consciousness is concerned with.\n21. The next is a remarkable dream-case reported to the Society by\nMr Dudley F. Walker {Journal xxiv, 379). It was a dream of a very\nextraordinary kind, for the percipient says of his experience : \"I might\nmention it has made a deep impression on my mind, and although I have\nnever given serious thought to this subject, I am now perfectly convinced\nthat this was no ordinary dream. It was so remarkably true to life that it\nseemed more like a vision of events taking place than an average dream.\"\nThis must be taken into account in any estimate of the probability that\nchance might account for the coincidence between the dream and the\nevents. The question would be : How many dreams of railway accidents\nhad Mr Walker had which were so vivid and realistic that he felt compelled\nto recount them on getting up in the morning, which made him say that\nif he had had to make a railway journey that day he would have postponed\nit, which impelled him to make a note of them in his diary, and which\nmade him feel too unwell to eat any breakfast, but which yet did not\ncorrespond with any real events? It is clearly no use estimating (even if it\ncould be done) how often the subject of trains or railway accidents may\nhave flitted through Mr Walker's ordinary dreams, because this dream was\nevidently not in the same category as ordinary dreams. Any statistical\ncalculation made on that basis would be merely misleading. In answer\nto the question, \" Have you ever had a similar dream? \" Mr Walker\nreplied, \" No. Never of an event which has actually taken place.\" Also\nin reply to another question, Mr Walker added :\n\" I can most emphatically\nassure you that I have never before dreamed of either a railway smash or\nany other kind of violent accident, and, as a matter of fact have all my life\nbeen a very rare dreamer. This has been a subject of remark in my family,\nfor I have often passed for months without ever dreaming at all\u2014or at any\nrate never having any remembrance of dreaming after waking. ...\"\nBut the question is not merely how many^dreams of railway accidents\nMr Walker had had which had corresponded with no reality, but how\nmany he had had which contained all the details which this dream shared\nwith the reality. It is surely obvious to common sense that chance is an\nabsurd explanation, and to demand a mathematical demonstration of this\nfact would be equally absurd.\nAs to the time-coincidence, the collision occurred about 11.20 p.m.,\nand Mr Walker began to dream about it soon after he fell asleep at 10.30\np.m. and he seems to have gone on dreaming about it at intervals through\nthe night.\nThe following is Mr Walker's account of the dream. \" I was in an\noverhead signal-box extending over a railway line I had never seen before.\n\fgo The Modus Operandi of ^ [Part\nIt was night, and I saw approaching what I knew was an excursion train,\nfull of people returning from some big function. I knew it was my duty to\nsignal this train through, which I did, but at the same time I had a feeling\nthat the train was doomed. (I have nothing to do with railway work.)\nIn my dream I seemed to hover in the air and follow the express as it\nslowed round a loop line. As it approached a station I saw, to my horror,\nanother small train on the same line. Although they seemed both travel-\nling slowly, they met with terrible impact. I saw the express and its\ncoaches pitch and twist in the air, and the noise was terrible. Afterwards,\nI walked beside the wreckage in the dim light of dawn, viewing with a\nfeeling of terror the huge overturned engine and smashed coaches. I was\nnow amid an indescribable scene of horror, with dead and injured people,\nand rescue workers everywhere.\nMost of the bodies lying by the side of the track were those of women and\ngirls. As I passed with some unknown person leading me, I saw one man's\nbody in a ghastly state lifted out and laid on the side of an overturned\ncoach. . .\n.\"\nI am here concerned only with the light which cases of this kind can\nthrow on the modus operandi of paranormal cognition. There are features\nin this case which assimilate it with cases of \" travelhng clairvoyance \".\nMr Walker seemed to be in the overhead signal-box from which he saw\nthe train approaching. Then he seemed to be hovering in the air following\nthe express as it went round the loop line. Then he seemed to be walking\nbeside the wreckage. We have already dealt with the arguments against\nthe view that a non physical body, travelling through space and obtaining\na close-up view of events, can account for cases like this, and found it\nunplausible. The question lies between a telepathic and a clairvoyant\nexplanation. In favour of the telepathic view we must note that all the\ninformation which entered into the dream could have been obtained from\nthe minds of the signalman or others on the spot. Also, Mr Walker had a\ncurious feeling of being identified with the signalman. He says :\n\"... I\nhad an awful feeling of horror, and that it was my fault ; due to the fact,\nno doubt, that I was under the impression that I was the signalman who\nlet the train through.\" Again, Mr Walker says :\n\"... I dreamt again\nabout being in the signal-box after having attended some official enquiry\nin which I saw a number of men seated down each side of a long table.\"\nMr Walker says that in his dream he had a feeling that something was\nwrong in the signal-box, owing to a clicking noise ; and the signalman,\nGarrett, said that his attention was drawn to a clicking noise in the lever\nframe. This feeling of being identified with the signalman strongly\nsuggests telepathy. The dream throughout was, of course, a dramatic\nconstruct\u2014a mediating vehicle\u2014which conveyed the paranormally\nacquired knowledge to consciousness.\nAgain, in this case the telepathic hypothesis does not suggest that any-\nthing like naive \" thought-transference \" is taking place. It suggests that\nthe whole situation has been grasped, including both physical events and\nmental or emotional states. Knowledge of the physical events need not\nhave been acquired by direct perception of physical objects, so long as any\nminds were aware of these events. Had the dream been precognitive, it\nmight have been said that no one was aware of the events, and therefore\n\f1 73] Paranormal Cognition 9^\ntelepathy could not be invoked. But, by similar reasoning, it could be said\nthat the physical events had not yet happened, and therefore clairvoyance\ncould not be invoked either. From this point of view naive telepathy and\nnaive clairvoyance are on a par. Actually, Mr Walker thought that he fell\nasleep about 10.30 and began to dream about the accident at once, that is\nabout fifty minutes before it occurred. But I do not think we can be sure\nthat any part of the dream was really precognitive.\nIf we try to explain the dream by clairvoyance, we arrive at no explana-\ntion of the feeling of identity with the signalman, and of sharing his\nemotions. That, on the clairvoyant hypothesis, would have to be a\ndramatic element imported to give atmosphere by the dream-constructor.\nBut the chief argument is that which we find in all spontaneous cases.\nWhy should Mr Walker's clairvoyant faculty have pitched on this event?\nIf the answer given is, Why should it not?, the counter reply is obviously\nthat if it did so it would surely pitch on a great many other events as well.\nOne can scarcely imagine that a clairvoyant faculty would emerge from\noblivion once in a lifetime, coincide with a remarkable event by chance,\nand then retire again. For in this railway accident, the percipient had no\npersonal interest. There was nothing to guide a faculty of naive clair-\nvoyance to its goal. We have found nothing so far to suggest that clair-\nvoyance, in the sense of direct paranormal perception of physical events,\never takes place. And I think it may be questioned whether information\nreceived in the form of a dream is compatible with clairvoyance as ^bove\ndefined.\nPrecognition\nIf precognition be admitted to be a fact, naive telepathy and naive\nclairvoyance at once become suspect. Precognition breaks away from\ncausality somewhere. Does it seem likely then, that telepathy and clair-\nvoyance, if they exist, are normally causal processes? Since telepathy is\napparently sometimes precognitive, and naive clairvoyance (if it exists) is\nsimilarly sometimes precognitive, is it likely that these two forms of the\nparanormal cognitive faculty are processes taking place in the world of time\nand causality while precognition is a totally different kind of process which\nbreaks away from time and causality?\n22. The following case of spontaneous precognition contains some infor-\nmative features {Proc. v, 322).\nMrs J. Schweizer wrote as follows : \"On the i8th July I had the\nfollowing dream or vision (I can't say which) :\u2014I was walking on the\nedge of a high cliff, the open sea in front, dear Fred and a stranger a little\nin advance, when Fred slipped suddenly down the side of the cliff, and in\ndoing so gazed with the most intense anguish into my very soul. I shall\nnever forget that look. I turned to the stranger and said, '\nMay I ask who\nyou are and what is your name? '\nHe replied, '\nMy name is Henry\nIrvin.' I said, '\nDo you mean Irving the actor? '\nHe said, '\nNo, not\nexactly : but something after that style.' I said, in reply, '\nNow that I\nlook at you, you have the same agonized expression in your face that I have\nso often noticed in Irving's photographs in the shop windows.' So I\nawoke in a miserable state of mind. It was between 5 and 6 a.m. The\nservants came down soon after. The dream seemed to haunt me ;\nI\n\f92 The Modus Operandi of [Part\ncould think of nothing else. When I met my eldest son, John, at breakfast,\nI asked at once where was Fred? (I must state here that Fred was the\ntravelling partner of three brothers, and then in the north of England on a\njourney.) His brother, after hearing the dream, said, '\nOh, Fred is all\nright ; he is in Manchester.' He saw how miserable this dream made me\nfeel, and he promised at my request to '\nwire '\nto me when he got to his\ncounting house in case there was no letter from Fred, who was in the habit\nof writing to the firm daily. There was, however, a letter as usual, and\nwhen I received no telegram as arranged, I judged that dear Fred was all\nright. Still the dream was present to my mind, and I thought of it con-\ntinually. I begged of his brother to tell him to come home. In a day or\ntwo I heard that he was at Leeds, and the ne.xt day after that, John, the\neldest brother said, '\nFred says he is going to take a week's holiday in\nScarborough ', when I at once exclaimed, '\nI wish he were at home ; do\nwrite to him to come back ; he has had holidays enough this year. I shall\nwrite to him myself.' John said, '\nOh, don't ; let him enjoy himself.'\nOn this day, before I got out of bed at the same hour between 5 and 6 a.m.,\na person seemed to pass the side of my bed, and said into my ear in an\naudible voice, '\nYou are not done with trouble yet.' I started up and\nawoke, and related the matter at breakfast while talking of Fred to John,\nand said, '\nI think it was your father.' He said, '\nOh, nonsense, that is like\nthe dream you bothered me about a few days ago.' This was on the 23rd.\nOn the 24th John mentioned that he had a telegram from Fred to send on\n^10, that he was enjoying himself immensely, that the weather was\nglorious. I again wished he were at home, and John said, '\nHe will be\nhere on Friday next.' In the morning on the 26th I went to the letter-box\nand found a telegram for John, which announced an accident to Fred.\nJohn, however, did not like to tell me, and hurried off to the office. I\nasked John the nature of the telegram, but he said '\nBusiness '. On\narriving at his office there was a telegram of a similar kind from the hotel\nproprietor at Scarborough. Poor Fred was dead at the time, as he only\nsurvi\\'ed the accident three hours. John and I set off at once, and found\nall over, and next day it was proposed that we should visit the fatal spot.\nHis companion in that unfortunate excursion accompanied us. He sat\nopposite to me in the carriage, and when I looked at him I remembered\nthe dream of the i8th and recognized the stranger who had the agonized\nexpression, and asked him at once if his name were '\nHenry '. He said,\n'\nYes, my name is Henry,' when I told the dream. He then said, '\nThe\nmost extraordinary part is, I am connected with the volunteers, and we\nhave private theatricals, and I recite, and am always on those occasions\nintroduced as Henry Irvin, jun.'\n\"\nThe account of the accident was recorded in the York Herald of 28th\nJuly, 1882, as follows :\n\" Scarboro', Sad Death of a Gentleman Visitor.\u2014\n\u2022\nAn accident of a melancholy character, and which unfortunately has been\nattended with fatal results, occurred on Wednesday evening to a London\ngentleman named Frederick Schweizer, who for the past few days has been\nstaying at the Grand Hotel. It appears that on the afternoon of that day\nthe deceased, along with a casual acquaintance named Deverell, who is\nstaying at the Castle Hotel, went for a ride on horseback along the beautiful\nForge Valley rides. When near Ayton, the deceased was somewhat in\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 93\nadvance of his companion, and it is surmised that his steed shied at a white\ngate ;\nanyhow he was thrown onto the road, and the horse galloped away.\nHis friend on getting up to him dismounted, and a passing carriage was\nutihsed to convey him to his hotel. This was at six o'clock and three hours\nsubsequently the deceased expired, it is supposed from concussion of the\nbrain.\"\nIt will be seen that the dream occurred on the i8th July and the fatal\naccident on the 26th, eight days later. During all this time Mrs Schweizer\nwas in a miserable state of anxiety about her son Fred and urged her other\nson, John, to induce him to come home. On the 23rd she had the second\ndreain or impression of a presence and a voice, which she thought was\nthat of her husband, warning her that her trouble was not over.\nEdmund Gurney, in an interview with Mrs Schweizer, was favourably\nimpressed with her as a witness and says that the dream \" certainly made\na very powerful impression on her \". In fact, like Mr Dudley Walker's,\nit was no ordinary dream. As she says :\n\" The dream seemed to haunt\nme ; I could think of nothing else.\"\nFrom the point of view of the nature of paranormal cognition, one very\ninteresting feature of this dream is that it was so unlike the event to which\nit corresponded. The scene of the dream-event was fictional, the high\ncliiT, the open sea in front, her son, Fred, slipping down the side of the\ncliff\u2014none of this occurred. Yet its correspondence with the real event\nis undoubted, partly because of the double warning and of the anxiety\nwhich lasted till Fred's' death occurred, and partly because of the \" Henry\nIrvin \" incident. This shows beyond all doubt that the drama on the\ncliff was a dramatic creation, in other words a mediating vehicle, and not\nany kind of direct perception of physical or conscious mental events. The\nmotive for this radical departure from physical fact is obscure. It suggests\nthat a dream-like association of ideas may have taken a part in constructing\nthe mediating vehicle. Fred was known to be at Scarborough, by the sea.\nThis was normal knowledge. Paranormally, his impending death by\naccident was accessible in the subliminal. Perhaps the two kinds of\nknowledge got together and created a picture of the most likely kind of\naccident by the sea (especially if knowledge that there was a fall and con-\ncussion was included), namely a fall from the cliffs. Horses were excluded\nfrom the picture, perhaps because the presence.of horses on the edge of a\ncliff would be incongruous. But the one thing that would connect this\nvague dramatic construct with the real event quite unmistakably was\nincluded, namely the face of Fred's companion (afterwards recognised by\nMrs Schweizer in the carriage) and his acting name, Henry Irvin.\nNot only does this case show very clearly the existence of a mediating\nvehicle : it also shows its \" portmanteau \" character. The paranormal\nknowledge of Fred's impending death was certainly the instigating motive\nand the dynamic force behind the experience. It set the mediating\nmachinery to work ; but it was only one factor in its actual construction.\nCases like this teach us not to regard precognition as a kind of time-\ntravelling vision which goes into the future and takes a peep at physical\nevents which have not yet happened. They teach us to look at it as a\n\" something \" deep in the subliminal region, probably beyond time and\ncausality, and something therefore that we cannot grasp intellectually,\n*\n\f94 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nwhich makes it possible for mediating vehicles to be created which have\nreference to the future.\nI shall not go on to quote other cases of precognition here, but shall pass\non to another phenomenon which sheds light on paranormal cognition.\nBefore doing so it will be well to summarise the conclusions to which the\nevidence so far cited points.\n(1) There is no valid evidence for the existence of a faculty of\" thought-\ntransference \" in which thoughts or ideas pass from one conscious mind to\nanother. The evidence points to a sharing by subliminal selves of a very\nwide and general kind of knowledge which can be mediated to conscious-\nness by means of various types of psychologically created vehicles\n\u2014\nsensory, impulsive, emotional, verbal.\nThe faculty can be called \" telepathy \", but only in a sense greatly\nextended from that implied by the term \" thought-transference \".\n(2) There is no valid evidence for the existence of a faculty of \" clair-\nvoyance \" in the sense of a paranormal, perceptual faculty by means of\nwhich physical objects or events can be directly perceived. This hypo-\nthesis fails, on the whole, to explain both spontaneous and experimental\nevidence.\n(3) There is valid evidence for the existence of a faculty of precognition.\nThis rests on a large amount of spontaneous and experimental evidence,\nof which only one example has been cited above. Once precognition is\ngranted, it is in itself a powerful argument against the existence of what\nhave here been called \" naive telepathy \" and \" naive clairvoyance \",\nsince both of these presuppose that paranormal cognition deals directly\nwith events in the space-time world (assuming conscious thought to have\na physical counterpart in the brain), while precognition points to the view\nthat paranormal cognition takes place (or exists or has being of some sort)\noutside the space-time world, and is mediated into it by means of a\nsecondary process.\nThese conclusions apply to the types of evidence we have so far been\nconsidering. The evidence of statistical methods of research will be\nconsidered presently, and the question of whether their results agree with\nthe above, and, if not, why they diifer, will be discussed.\nPSYCHOMETRY \"\nSeveral things in the experimental field which would throw light on\nparanormal cognition have been left almost untouched. One of these is\n\" psychometry \". In psychometry, a material object plays an uncom-\nprehended part in the production of paranormal cognition. Here, surely,\nis something to be followed up. What part does it play? What is the\nconnection between paranormal knowledge and a piece of matter.? Most\nof the sensitives who took part in the experimental work referred to above\n\u2014\n\" Jane \", Anna Samuelsson, Alma Radberg, Agda Olson, Cecilia, and\nFanny G.\u2014were verbally directed to their objectives. But other sensitives\nhave been directed to their objectives by holding or being otherwise\nassociated with an object. Two cases of this kind were reported by Mr\nA. W. Dobbie, an Associate of the S.P.R. living in Adelaide. When he\nwas in England, we are told that Mrs Sidgwick examined his note book.\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 95\n23 . Mr Dobbie practised hypnotism for ten or twelve years and found him-\nself to be a very successful operator. He says that he hypnotised more than\n500 persons, chiefly with a view to alleviating suffering, and found that a\nfew of his patients were capable of clairvoyance (Proc. vii, 64). The sensi-\ntives employed in the following experiments were Eliza and Martha Dixon.\nIn cases of psychometry, the sensitive holds, or becomes otherwise\nassociated with, an object which some person has previously touched, and\nis then able to give information concerning the past history of the object\nand of the person who has touched it. It is convenient to have a name for\nthis person, and I shall call him the \" contactor \". It is unfortunate that\nthe second of these cases, which contains a very significant feature, is less\nwell evidenced than the first. But the way in which the lost pencil-case\nwas found can scarcely be untrue. Witnesses of the first case were the\nHon. Dr Campbell, M.L.C., the Hon. David Murray, M.L.C., and Chief\nSecretary of South Australia, Mr Lyall, and Mr Fleming, solicitor.\nDr Campbell handed Mr Dobbie a gold sleeve-link, whose fellow had\nbeen lost, and asked if a clairvoyant could find the missing one. Mr\nDobbie says :\n\" I should state that neither of the clairvoyants had ever\nseen either of the rooms they referred to, nor did they know the names of\nthe children, or anything in connection with this case. . .\n.\" The link was\nfirst handed to Martha Dixon who began by giving an accurate description\nof Dr Campbell's features (the contactor). She then spoke of a little fair-\nhaired boy called \" Neil \" who had the link in his nursery and dropped it\ninto a hole which had been torn in the breast of a toy elephant.\nThen occurred an interval of two or three days, during which the missing\nlink was found, but left untouched. At the next sitting Eliza and Martha\njoined hands, and Eliza immediately spoke as follows, this time in Dr\nCampbell's presence :\n' \" I am in a house, upstairs, I was in a bathroom,\nthen I went into another room nearly opposite, there is a large mirror just\ninside the door on the left hand, there is a double sized dressing-table\nwith drawers down each side of it, the sleeve-link is in the corner of the\ndrawer nearest the door. When they found it they left it there. I know\nwhy they left it there, it was because they wanted to see if we would find it.\nI can see a nice easy chair there, it is an old one, I would like it when I am\nput to sleep because it is nice and low. The bed has curtains, they are a\nsort of brownish net and have a fringe of darker brown. The wall paper\nis of a light blue colour. There is a cane lounge there and a pretty\nJapanese screen behind it, the screen folds up. There is a portrait of an\nold gentleman over the mantelpiece, he is dead, I knew him when he was\nalive, his name is the same as the gentleman who acts as Governor when the\nGovernor is absent from the Colony, I will tell you his name directly\u2014it is\nthe Rev. Mr Way. It was a little boy who put the sleeve-link in that\ndrawer. He is very fair, his hair is almost white, he is a pretty little boy,\nhe has blue eyes and about three }'ears old. The link had been left on that\ntable, the little boy was in the nursery, and he went into the bedroom after\nthe gentleman had left. I can see who the gentleman is, it is Dr Campbell.\nDoesn't that little boy look a young Turk, the link is quite a handful for his\nlittle hand, he is running about with it very pleased ; But he doesn't seem\nto know what to do with it. (A)\n(Dr Campbell was not present from this point.)\n\f96 The Modus Operandi of [Part\n\" Now I can hear someone calling up the stairs, a lady is calling two\nnames, Colin is one and Neil is the other, the other boy is about five years\nold and is darker than the other. The eldest, Colin, is going downstairs\nnow, he is gone into what looks like a dining-room, the lady says, '\nWhere\nis Neil? ' '\nUpstairs, Ma.' '\nGo and tell him to come down at once.'\nThe little fair haired boy had put the link down ; but when he heard his\nbrother coming up, he picked it up again. Colin says\n\u2014' Neil, you are to\ncome down at once.' '\nI won't,' says Neil. '\nYou're a goose,' replies\nColin, and he turned and went down without Neil. What a young\nmonkey! Now he is gone into the nursery and put the link into a large\ntoy elephant, he put it through a hole in front which is broken. He has\ngone downstairs now, I suppose he thinks it is safe there. Now that\ngentleman has come into the room again and he wants that link ; he is\nlooking all about for it, he thinks it might be knocked down : the lady is\nthere, too, and they are both looking for it. The lady says\n\u2014' Are you\nsure you put it there? '\nThe gentleman says, '\nYes.'\n\" Now it seems like next day. The servant is turning the carpet up and\nlooking all about for it, but. can't find it. The gentleman is asking that\nyoung Turk if he has seen it, he knows that he is fond of pretty things.\nThe little boy says, '\nNo.' He seems to think it is fine fun to serve his\nfather like that. Now it seems to be another day and the little boy is in the\nnursery again, he has taken the link out of the elephant, now he has dropped\nit into that drawer, that is all I have to tell you about it, I told you the rest\nbefore.\"\ni8th July, 1886. \" Since writing the above pages I have handed them\nto Dr Campbell for perusal, so that he might check the account and ratify\nit or otherwise, and after going carefully through it, he has returned it to\nme accompanied by a complete ratification in writing, which I herewith\nenclose. A. W. Dobbie.\"\nMemo, by Dr Campbell.\n\" Adelaide, 9th July, 1886.\n\" At the point (A) the seance was discontinued till the next sitting when,\nI was absent. The conversation reported as passing between the children\nis correct in every point. The portrait is that of the late Rev. James Way.\nThe description of the children and their names are true. The fact that\nthe link was discovered in the drawer, in the interval between one sitting\nand the final one, and that the link was left there pending the discovery of\nit by the clairvoyant is also correct, as this was my suggestion to Mrs\nCampbell when she showed it to me in the corner of the drawer. In fact,\nevery circumstance reported is absolutely correct. I know, further, that\nneither of the clairvoyants has ever been inside of my door. My children\nare utterly unknown to them, either in appearance or by name. I may say\nalso that they had no knowledge of my intention to place the link in their\npossession, or even of my presence at the seance, as they were both on each\noccasion in a mesmeric sleep when I arrived\u2014Allan Campbell.\"\nIn a later letter, dated i6th December, 1887, Dr Campbell writes :\n\" Dear Mr Dobbie,\u2014Your London correspondent asks if I had any\nknowledge of the conversation that the clairvoyant stated had passed\nbetween the children. I have no knowledge whatever of this conversation,\nnor the circumstances attending it, until she repeated it. It was subse-\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 97\nquently confirmed to me in part by Mrs Campbell, such part as she\nherself is reported to have taken in the tableau. With respect to the large\ntoy elephant, I certainly knew of its existence, but was not thinking of it\nat the time the clairvoyant was speaking. I did not know even by suspicion\nthat the elephant was so mutilated as to have a large opening in its chest,\nand on coming home had to examine the toy to see whether the statement\nwas correct. I need hardly say that it was absolutely correct. \u2014I am. Yours\nsincerely, Allan Campbell.\"\nWith regard to the difference between this method of experimenting on\nparanormal cognition and the commoner method of voluntary telepathy,\nin which the agent thinks of the thing to be transmitted to the percipient,\nthe following remark of Mr Bobbie's is relevant. \" I have scores of times\ntried my level best to cause clairvoyants to see pictures and visions by\nconjuring up in my own mind the most vivid pictures imaginable, but up\nto the present moment I have never succeeded in making my clairvoyants\nthink one thought or say or see anything I have tried to make them see in\nthat way.\"\nI have quoted this rather lengthy case because it shows that the para-\nnormal cognitive faculty is not like naive telepathy or naive clairvoyance.\nA good deal of the information lay within the knowledge of Dr Campbell.\nSome of it was unverifiable. The conversation between the children was\nnot known to him, but some of it was verified by Mrs Campbell. The\nhole in the toy elephant was, at the time, only known to the child. The\ntelepathic hypothesis therefore involves a kind of dipping into minds just\nas is convenient to piece together the entire episode. I suggest that the\nkind of telepathy which really exists (if it merits the name at all) is not a\nfaculty which dips into this conscious mind and that and fits together the\nisolated pieces of information it finds, but that the knowledge exists in a\nwide and general form in the subliminal selves of those concerned, as was\npointed out when dealing with Case 13. The scenes and the conversations\nwhich the percipient experienced were constructed to mediate this general\nknowledge to her consciousness.\nCan this case be explained by naive clairvoyance.' The correct descrip-\ntion of the details of the interior of a house unknown to the percipient\nmay seem at first to suggest it. But the events described as if the per-\ncipient were witnessing them were in the past, not in the present, and this\nrules out naive clairvoyance, as was pointed out on p. 82. The source\nof the knowledge is very obscure. We can, if we like, stretch either term,\ntelepathy or clairvoyance, to cover it : but the faculty is quite unlike\n\" thought-transference \" and it is quite unlike sense-perception of\nphysical events.\nThe really novel feature about this case, however, as compared to the\ncases we have previously considered, is that the faculty of the sensitive was\ndirected by the sleeve-link which she held.\nAnother case with the same sensitive contains an extremely interesting\nfeature. Unfortunately it was not so carefully noted at the time as was the\nabove case ;\nyet this interesting feature must surely have occurred.\n{Proc. vii, 68.) Mr. Dobbie says :\n24. \" One evening, whilst I was busy with several of my clairvoyants,\nMr Adamson, J. P. (one of the leading citizens of Adelaide), called, in\nG\n\f98 The Modus Operandi of [Part\ncompany with his daughter, and, handing me two or three trinkets which\nhad been suspended to her watch chain, simply remarked, 'We have lost\nsomething. Will you kindly see if your clairvoyant can help us in the\nmatter? '\nMy clairvoyants all being asleep, I quietly placed the trinkets\nin the hand of the one called Miss E. Dixon without remark. In a moment\nor two she proceeded to give an accurate description of the young lady\nwho owned the trinkets. I then said, '\nNever mind the young lady,\nsomething is lost ;\ntry and find it.'\n\" In a few moments she commenced to describe a gold pencil-case\nwhich she saw '\nlying on the road in one of the suburbs, not in the city,\nit is not there now, it is in a comfortable looking one-storey house with a\ngarden and iron railings opposite.' She then described the gentleman who\nhad possession of the pencil-case, whom she saw with his wife, and also\nquoted a remark he made, '\nWe will lay it aside and see if anyone claims\nit,' and stated that it was placed '\nin a small box '. My clairvoyant seemed\nunable to give me the locality of this gentleman and his house ;\nhowever,\nin reply to an advertisement next day or day after, a gentleman answering\nthe description given by my clairvoyant brought the lost pencil-case to\nMr Adamson, who, naturally enough, was so astounded at the correct\ndescription of a person none of us had ever seen or known, that he took the\ntrani and visited the neighbourhood and house in which the gentleman\nresided, and to his astonishment he found that the description was exact,\nin fact, it was the only house in the neighbourhood having iron railings,\nalso that there actually was a two-storey house opposite, which was also\nthe only one in the neighbourhood. Mr Adamson, on questioning the\ngentleman, found that the pencil-case was found on the road as described ;\nalso that it has been placed in the small box and the remark made re\nwaiting to '\nsee if it would be claimed '\nby the gentleman.\n\" To still further test the genuineness of the clairvoyance, I arranged\n(quite unknown to my clairvoyant, of course) to have the said gentleman\npresent with about twelve other persons, who all entered the room after I\nhad put my clairvoyant to sleep, and, on placing the trinkets and pencil-\ncase in her hands again, she immediately found herself at the same house\nagain and saw the same gentleman. I then instructed her to remember\n(my subjects never remember anything when they wake up unless I\ninstruct them to do so) the features of this gentleman, so that if ever she\nshould meet him in the future she would recognize him. I then woke her\nup, and to the astonishment and delight of all present, she at once volun-\ntarily recognized the gentleman as the one she had seen when mesmerised.\nOf course you will see at once that the fact of the clairvoyant recognizing\nthe gentlemian is not of itself of much scientific value because the fact\nthat I by this time knew the features of the gentleman makes it possible\nto bring that part of the\" experiment under the category of thought-\ntransference, but taken in conjunction with the previous parts, I think the\nidea of thought-transference may be discarded. ... A. W. Dobbie.\"\nThe following statement, Mr Dobbie tells us, was handed to him by Mr\nAdamson on 8th March, 1886 :\n\" Dear Sir . . . Passing your house one\nevening, in company with a daughter, who had lost a trinket off her watch-\nchain a week or so previous, and who lamented its loss, not on account of\nintrinsic value, but as an old keep-sake, I said to her :\n'\nCome in and see\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 99\nif Mr Dobbie can find it for you.' You had three clairvoyants asleep when\nwe entered your room ;\nshortly afterwards you placed the trinkets in the\nhand of one of them, a female. Soon after which she began a fair descrip-\ntion of my daughter ; this you stopped, informing her that something was\nlost which we wanted to find. She was silent for a minute or two, and\nthen said :\n'\nI think I see it now. It was in the dust and a man has found\nit.' The question was put :\n'\nWhat is it.-\"\n'\nShe answered, '\nA ring ;\nthere is something on it ; it is not a key, Oh! it's a pencil-case ; its bright\nand shining.' She was then asked to follow the man home. This caused\na long silence. At length she said :\n'\nI am there now ; he is showing it to\na woman. I think it is his wife. He is putting it in a box and saying, '\nWe\nwill leave it there and see what comes of it.' \" She then said more than\nonce, '\nThey would give it up if they knew who it belonged to, they do not\nwant to keep it ;\nOh, I wish I could take it away, they seem honest\npeople.' She then, in answer to questions put, described the house in\nwhich the people lived, and the neighbourhood exactly, but could not give\nthe locality, as she had never been there before\u2014described the house as\nold and comfortable, like within a garden, a wrought-iron railing in front;\nno church could be seen from the gate, but a large two-storey building\nopposite. She described the man accurately who had the pencil-case, and\nadvised advertising for its recovery, as she was sure of its return if it was\nknown who was the owner. A. Adamson.\"\nThe remarkable feature of this case is that the sensitive never had the\ngold pencil-case in her hand or anywhere near her until after it had been\nfound. She only held the trinkets which had been suspended from the\nsame ring as the pencil-case before it was lost. Whatever guiding influence\nthe trinkets exerted in the matter of finding the pencil-case must, according\nto our way of thinking, have been exerted backwards in time through the\nmoment when the trinkets and the pencil-case were last on the ring\ntogether. The trinkets had never been through the experience, which, so\nto speak, the pencil-case had ;\nthey had never been in contact with the\nfinder of the pencil-case and therefore could not directly link the sensitive\nwith him. On the other hand, the pencil-case, which had been in contact\nwith him, had not been seen or touched by the sensitive at the time when\nshe described his finding it.\nIf the pencil-case was causally efficacious in directing the sensitive's\nfaculty to the man who found it, the cause must here have been acting\nin a very peculiar way. It must have been acting backwards in time to the\nmoment when the pencil-case and the trinkets were last together, and then\nforwards in time through the trinkets. Apparently, this would involve a\ncausal sequence passing from the time of the finding of the pencil-case\nback through the moment when it and the trinkets were last on the ring\ntogether, and then forwards to the moment when the sensitive held the\ntrinkets in her hand. This is quite different from the condition under\nwhich \" psychometry \" usually takes place. Usually, the sensitive is\ngiven an object to hold and then speaks of a person who has touched this\nobject in the past. Notice that the first thing Eliza Dixon did in this case\nwhen given the trinkets to hold, was to describe Miss Adamson, their\nowner. It was only by a lucky chance that the case brought to light the\nfact that the influence of the object, whatever it is, can act backwards as^\n\flOO The Modus Operandi of [Part\nwell as forwards in time. Note too, that verbal direction works here in the\nsame way as it did with \" Jane \" and with Backman's subjects, only now\nit is superimposed on the influence of the object. Eliza Dixon first speaks\nof the owner of the trinkets. Then, being verbally directed to look for\nsomething which had been lost, she switches on to the guiding influence of\nthe pencil-case and trinkets combined. Yet I do not think we can say it is\na case of verbal direction only. To all appearance, the lost pencil-case\nreally was eifective, through its association with the trinkets, in bringing\nabout its own discovery.\nI shall now quote another case illustrating this retrograde temporal\naction of the psychometric object, and I would direct special attention to it.\nIt is an experiment carried out by Dr Eugene Osty.\nBefore leaving the evidence of our own Proceedings and Journal, and\nturning to that of Osty, I must, however, say something about the legiti-\nmacy of doing so. The work done by Osty, and published in a summarised\nform in his book La Comiaissance Supra-Normale, translated (not too well,\nit seems to me) under the title Supernormal Faculties in Man, throws\nmuch light on paranormal cognition. It is a misnomer to call this work an\nobservation of \" spontaneous \" phenomena. It was, on the whole,\nexperimental, although the phenomena were by no means under the\ncomplete control of the investigator. If they had been, the results would\nhave lost nearly all their value. But undoubtedly Osty's work was of a\npreliminary nature. His somewhat rough and sketchy experiments could\nhave been followed up more carefully and more according to plan. In\nfact, a careful study of them should have preceded any subsequent\nexperimental work in paranormal cognition. Statistical workers made a\ngreat mistake, in my opinion, in breaking with the past and attempting\nto make a new start along novel lines. At any rate, they made a great\nmistake in regarding their new start as a main attack on the' problems of\nparanormal cognition.\nThe above book of Osty's was rather unsympathetically reviewed by\nDr F. C. S. Schiller in Proc. xxxiv, 333. Schiller complains that Osty\nhas merely given condensations of his cases and that in no case has he\npublished his full notes. It is not possible, of course, to include the full\nnotes of cases in a book which is intended to be generally readable and of\nreasonable length, but he might, perhaps, have published the full notes of\na sample case. In any case, it is a pity that Osty's executors should not\nhave made his notes available to students of psychical research. Perhaps\nthe war was responsible for this.\nOsty himself regarded his work and his theoretical interpretation of it\nas tentative. Speaking of the latter, he says : \"I put it forward for the\nsake of the fruitful work that it suggests. ...\" He recognizes, too, the\ngaps in his work. \" I might have filled in these serious gaps,\" he says,\n\" by continuing my solitary work. But the matter of this study is so\nextensive and of such high interest, that I have thought it better to publish\nat once the verifications hitherto made, and thus to indicate to other\nexperimenters a main line and various branches of research, by which they\nmay, without waste of time and effort, proceed to the exploration of the\nlatent and transcendental zones of human thought.\" This was written in\n1922. It is extraordinary that investigators should have turned away from\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 10\n1\nthis promising lead, and, without studying its implications, have introduced\na new and altogether different line of experimental research.\nI shall in this paper regard Osty's work and the conclusions he comes\nto as valid guides.\n25. A highly significant experiment is recorded in an article entitled\nPremonitions a Longues Echeance, which appeared in the Revue Meta-\npsychique for November and December, 1936, p. 470. The experiment\ntook place in the rooms of the Institiit Metapsychique International in the\nAvenue Niel, Paris, on 21st April, 1926.\nAt 2.30 p.m. on that day, M. Humblot, a Member of the French Senate,\nMme Camille Flammarion, and Dr E. Osty were together in the Lecture\nHall, in which were about 150 chairs. M. Humblot walked down the gang-\nway and pointed out a chair at random, when asked by Dr Osty to do so.\nThe latter then marked it by sticking a piece of gummed paper under it.\nM. P. Forthuny, the sensitive, was then summoned. The marked chair\nwas pointed out to him, and he was left with Dr Osty's secretary and a\nstenographer, who were instructed to admit no one and to take down all\nthat passed. Forthuny sat in the marked chair and felt it and the neigh-\nbouring chairs on each side with the object of trying to learn something\nabout the persons who would sit in them at the coming meeting, to be held\nin about an hour's time. Never, we are told, had he spoken so fast as when\ndescribing his impressions. He had much to say about the future occupant\nof the chair he was sitting on. All he said was taken down in shorthand.\nThen, at 3.30, Forthuny went upstairs to Dr Osty's private room on the\nsecond floor and stayed there with him and Mme Flammarion, while all\nhe had said was typed out by the secretary in the adjoining office.\nAt 3.30 p.m. about fifty people were waiting outside the lecture hall and\non the first-floor landing, and when the doors were opened, they poured in.\nBy 4 o'clock, about 200 people had arrived and found seats where they\ncould. M. Humblot left the I.M.I, before Forthuny quitted the lecture\nhall. \" The six persons who knew the selected chair remained until\n4 p.m. without having any contact with the audience and took their places\nin the hall at their choice, according to the free chairs.\"\nAt 4 p.m. Dr Osty told the audience about the experiment, and indicated\nthe marked chair, whose occupant was, not unnaturally, \" quelque\nemue \". The mark on the chair was verified. Then M Forthuny read\naloud his remarks about the occupants of the chairs with which he had\nbeen in contact. Mme M., the occupant of the chair he had been sitting\non, was a very intelligent young woman, having a practical mind (d 'esprit\npositif), who was not content with \" nearly \", but anxious that the case\nshould be rendered as accurate as possible.\nForthuny had the following to say about her :\n(1) A statement about something which Mme M. said corresponded\nabsolutely with the reality, but which she asked should not be made\npublic.\n(2) Your project of going away in the summer has been stopped, and will\nbe again. Think no more of the east ; for the time it is over.\nMme M. had two projects for the summer holidays, a fortnight's motor\ntour, already abandoned, and another to the Vosges, also abandoned.\n(3)\n\" Before everything, take care of your graves. . .\n.\"\n\fI02 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nMme M. was not fond of visiting graves. Although her mother had\ndied tvi'O years ago, she had only once visited her grave, eight days after\nthe funeral.\n(4)\n\" Leon ... is given to me : the chemist, I do not know why . .\n.\"\nThis meant nothing, and was the only erroneous statement.\n. (5)\n\" Take care of your liver. ...\"\nMme M. was under treatment for liver trouble. ,\n\u2022\n(6)\n\" Don't wear that belt ; it has already hurt you. . .\n.\" \u2022\nMme M. was wearing an elastic belt, which had hurt her skin.\n(7)\n\" What a disturbance! You have been almost thrown to the ground\nmorally. You have been trampled on and dragged in the dust. You have\ndone very well to get up by yourself. The capital letter M. ... If you\ncould recover all your poise, you could live your life without emotion. ...\"\nMme M. had a business partner, a woman M. R., who was unjustly-\njealous and had attacked her violently. She had morally thrown her down,\ntrampled on her and rolled her on the ground. She had even threatened\nto kill her. At first Mme M. had thought of going away to escape, but in\nthe end she reacted and defended herself, showing her enemy and others\nhow unjust the indictments were. After having lost her poise, she had\ngradually recovered it, which enabled her better to re-establish calm all\nabout her. \u2022\n(8)\n\" Pay attention to a return of the affection of your ears, throat and\nnose. Your neuralgia arises only from that. . .\n.\"\nMme M. had suffered from neuralgia for a long time. A few days\npreviously she had seen a nose, throat and ear specialist who had said that\nif these organs were put right, the neuralgia would disappear.\n(9)\n\" So much the worse for the one in prison, I mean a moral prison\nin which he is shut up. He will come out of it by himself from-the know-\nledge that he is making others suffer. Then you will find all your free-\ndom.\"\nBecause of the unjust attacks on his wife, the husband of Mme M. had\nretired completely into himself, only speaking when strictly necessary.\nThis had put Mme M. into a state of painful constraint. Her husband\nsaid that his behaviour had been excessive, and he gradually came out of\nhis voluntary, moral imprisonment. Mme M. gained in proportion\nfreedom from her constrained attitude.\n(10) \" Do not complain that this title had been withdrawn. All that is\nonly human vanity.\"\nMme M. was at that time interested because several clairvoyants had\ntold her that she came of a titled family. Knowing that her mother was\nan abandoned child, she was intrigued by this and had made some in-\nquiries to check the statements of the clairvoyants.\n(11) \" Beyond the equator, far across the seas, beyond the seas, a scent\nof vanilla. . . . Very astonished to see someone return from Brazil or from\nthe Argentine . . . from South America in any case. . . . You were in\nclose contact with that person. ...\"\nEight days before the meeting, Mme M. had been visited, without\nnotice, by a very good friend of her fami ly, who, after four years, had arrived\nfrom Brazil.\n(12) \" The threat of an operation will return. ...\"\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 103\nTwo months before the meeting, Mme M.'s doctor had said to her,\n\" You will have to have an operation one day.\"\nI do not think it is necessary to waste time over the suggestion that all\nthese coincidences might be due to chance. For those who say that they can\nform no estimate of what may be due to chance unless they have a proba-\nbility-figure to guide them, it would be possible to carry out a control\nexperiment by getting someone to make twelve statements about the life\nof a person and then seeing how they applied to some person taken at\nrandom. Also the above is only a bald summary. Osty says : \"A relire\nici les indications metagnomiques, confrontees avec les evenements qu'ils\nsignaleront, ils vont se rendre compte combien les mots exprimes par le\nmetagnome contiennent plus de signification qu'ils semblaient en avoir.\"\nHaving confirmed Forthuny's statements, Mme M. was asked to\ndescribe how she got to the marked chair. Her account was given verbally\nand in writing and confirmed in part by her business partner, M. R.\nShe said that both Dr Osty and M. Forthuny had been completely\nunknown to her, and that it was by reading a case in the Reviie Meta-\npsychtque that M. Forthuny's sittings were disclosed to her and her business\npartner. On the day of the meeting, up to 12.30 p.m. she had no intention\nof going to it, and did not even know on which day the meeting was.\nM. R. (her partner) told her of it during lunch, and she decided to go to\nthe I.M.I., cancelling for the purpose an appointment with her nose-and-\nthroat specialist. About 2.30 she was seized with shortness of breath, a\nthing as a rule she never had, and it upset her. She told her colleague of\nthis, who advised her to rest. About 3 o'clock, although she was busy, her\nattention was constantly attracted to the hands of the clock. She felt as if\nsomething was hurrying her to go. Nevertheless, her indisposition\ncontinued and made her wonder whether it would not be better to rest in\nher office. At 3 o'clock, however, she started out for the Avenue Niel,\nand her breathing trouble stopped at once. At 3.20 she arrived at the\nI.M.I., and found a crowd of people assembled at the closed door of the\nhall. She took her place in the crowd and at about 3.30 the doors were\nopened. Caught in the crowd, she brought up, having been carried along,\njostled and encountering some difficulty, at a chair which she found within\nreach. As it v\/as, someone else nearly sat in the chair before her. Reflect-\ning on this fact, she thought how man)^ incidents could have prevented the\nthing from happening. Her indisposition nearly kept her from coming.\nShe was also expecting on that day important foreign clients, who actually\narrived, but after her departure from her office. Had they arrived while\nshe was still there, they would have prevented her from coming. The\nunexpected refusal of the business colleague to accompany her to the\nAvenue Niel nearly stopped her as well, since she disliked going about\nalone. Besides this, it was the jostling of the crowd which determined\nthe chair she ultimately reached. And if her colleague had accompanied\nher they would have required two chairs, and that would have meant\ngoing to one of the back rows.\nThis experiment, it should be noted, would have been very difficult to\n\" rig \". If one thinks of what normal explanation would have been\nreasonably possible, it is very hard to find one. Mme M. declared that she\ndid not know M. Forthuny before the experiment ; but suppose that he\n\f104 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nknew her, and that Mme M.'s account of how she came to the meeting\nand reached the chair was a tissue of falsehoods, still we have to admit that\nnothing could have been planned beforehand. The experiment was\nsuddenly sprung on M. Forthuny soon after 2.30 p.m., when he was asked\nto come into the hall and sit on a particular chair. He remained there till\n3.30 and then went straight upstairs to Dr Osty's private room, where he\nstayed in the company of Osty himself and Mme Flammarion until every-\none was seated in the lecture hall. If the case is to be explained by fraud\nand collusion, it must be assumed that Forthuny, as he sat in the chair,\ndecided to describe Mme M. whom he knew intimately. He would have\nto trust to luck that he would be able to get in touch with her in time and\npersuade her to come to the meeting and sit in that particular chair, whose\nposition he must have memorised by number and row. To do this under\nconstant supervision would have been difficult indeed. One would\nhave to suppose that he managed somehow to slip away and telephone\nto her. Even then, the chances were that someone else would have sat\nin the chair before she got to it, as, indeed, nearly happened according\nto her account. To all this, Mme M.'s partner, M. R., must have been a\nconfederate, for she corroborated part of the former's statement of how\nshe went to the meeting. How could he persuade M. R..? He must have\npersuaded Mme M. to persuade her during the supposed telephone\nconversation.\nWould a sane and reputable person, as M. Forthuny undoubtedly was,\nhave risked his reputation on a chance so extremely unlikely to come off,\neven if we admit Mme M.'s willingness to be his confederate.? The fact\nis that this case must be a sound piece of evidence, unless we regard the\nwhole account as a piece of deliberate fiction, which, in view of our know-\nledge of Osty, would be unreasonable to the point of absurdity. Also, if\nthe account had been untrue, the persons named in it would have protested.\nAccepting the case, we have in it a parallel to the previous example,\nwithout the complication of the trinkets ; that is to say, the cases would be\nparallel if Eliza Dixon had held the pencil-case before it was lost and told\nthe story of its loss and recovery before it happened. In the marked-chair\ncase, causality appears to have acted backwards in time from the moment\nwhen Mme M. sat on the chair to the earlier time when M. Forthuny sat\non it. Mme M. was the contactor of a psychometric object, which was the\nchair. Usually, the contactor touches the object first and the sensitive\ntouches it afterwards. Then the sensitive is able to give information\nabout the contactor and about the previous history of the object. In this\ncase the order of events was reversed, but still the sensitive was able to\ngive information about the contactor. This is what makes the case so\ninteresting. The difficulty about causality acting baclcwards in time,\nalways present in cases of precognition, is present in a case like this in a\nmore inescapable form ; for in ordinary cases of precognition it is some-\ntimes possible to argue that the information may have been due to subtle\ninference or the like, but here the causal efficacy of the object, whatever\nit may be, seems to be much more clearly exerted from future to present.\nOne other feature of the case is worthy of notice. At about 2.30 Mme\nM. was seized with a mysterious shortness of breath which cured itself\nat once when she started for the Avenue Niel. Also she had a feeling of\n\fI \"7^]\n'\nParanormal Cognition 105\nbeing hurried off : something kept urging her to look at the clock. All\nthis sounds very much like telepathy from M. Forthuny. But if so, it\nmust have been directed by the link, still in the future, of the moment\nwhen Mme M. would sit on the chair that M. Forthuny was then sitting\non.\nOsty had much experience of sensitives who worked with a psycho-\nmetric object, and he summarises his conclusions about the function\nfulfilled by the object on pp. 13 1-2 of Supernormal Faculties in Man.\nThe gist of these conclusions is as follows :\nIn the first place, the object fulfils the same function as bodily contact\nbetween sensitive and contactor, but does not have so powerful an\neff'ect.\n(1) The essential thing is that the object should have been touched by\nthe person in question.\n(2) Duration of contact does not matter. The degree of success\nattained by the sensitive depends on the character of the contactor,\nalthough with one sensitive, Mme Morel, frequency of contact by the\ncontactor did seem to improve the results.\n(3) Each of the persons who has touched the object is perceived\nseparately. One is not confused by the sensitive with another.\n(4) If a person touches an object, his whole life is thereby thrown open\nto the sensitive. He may have touched it twenty years ago, yet his fife\nsince that date is perceived by the sensitive. Even events in his life which\nare still in the future at the moment when the sensitive touches the object\ncan be foreseen.\n(5) Persons who are connected with the contactor can also be perceived\nby the sensitive, though more rarely.\n(6) As soon as the sensitive has begun to perceive the contactor, the\nobject can be destroyed. The sensitive can still give information as if he\nwere still touching the object, and about events after it was destroyed.\n(7) The physical and chemical nature of the object appears to make no\ndifference.\n(8) Lapse of time since the contactor touched the object does not appear\nto lessen the efficacy.\n(9) If objects are placed in contact with one another, this does not\naffect their efficacy : nor do objects placed in contact with one another\nappear to convey their efficacy for the sensitive to each other.\n(10) An error made about a person during a sitting with bodily contact\nbetween sensitive and sitter will persist if an object is afterwards used\ninstead.\nThe following conclusions seem to be justified:\n(i) Bodily contact between a certain type of sensitive and a sitter\nfacilitates paranormal cognition of the whole life of that sitter.\n(11) A psychometric object fulfils the same function as direct bodily\ncontact, though less efficiently.\n(iii) The object does not convey information which has been in some\nway engraved on it ; it merely canalises the paranormal cognitive faculty\ninto a given channel.\n(iv) The psychometric object is a part cause in the result, since the\nobject determines what kind of information the sensitive will give : also\n\fModus Operandi o\/ .\n'. '\n[Part\nsome sensitives can do nothing without such an object. But this causality\ncan act either from past to present or from future to present.\nThis last statement sounds rather preposterous. It is worth while\nshowing Osty's conclusions and the results of cases 24 and 2? in the form\nof simple diagrams.\nI. Osty's Conclusions\n'0 t t 2 t\n3 t\n\/q is the moment at which the contactor was born.\nh \" >. ,, the contactor touches the object.\n^2 .. ,, ,, the sensitive touches the object.\n^3^ >' \" >> the object is destroyed.\n^2 >. ,, the sensitive makes further veridical state-\nments about the contactor after the\nobject has been destroyed.\n^4 \" >> the contactor dies.\nWhen the sensitive touches the object at U the whole of the contactor's\nhie is laid open to him throughout the periojd t^~t^. It would be interesting\nto discover by experiment (since the fact of the contactor's touching the\nobject at appears to be a crucial condition) whether the entire period\n^4-\/0 is laid open to the sensitive.\n'\nThe view that events are in some normally causal way stamped on the\nmaterial substance of the object could only apply to those occurring during\nthe period t^-t^, and would only seem to be plausible during the period\nti-to if . the contactor had had the object in his possession during\nthat period and had worn it or constantly touched it. Events occurring\nduring the period \/.-\/.j could not by any stretch of imagination be accounted\nfor in that way.\nAll events perceived by the sensitive which occur during the period\n^4-\/3 involve precognition.\nThe fact that events occurring during the period t^-t^ can be perceived\nby the sensitive suggests that the function of the object may be to establish\na rapport which, once established, functions without further assistance\nfrom the object.\nII.

This has an obvious bearing on\nthe assumption that if a sensitive knows what is happening to an object\nwhen there is no normal means of knowing, this involves clairvoyance.\nThe conclusion is not necessarily valid.\nIncidentally, an often quoted case from Osty's Supernormal Faculties in\nMan (p. 104) in which Mme Morel traced an old man, Etienne Lerasle,\nby using his scarf as a psychometric object, does not need discarnate\nagency to explain it, as is sometimes alleged. The scarf was left at home\nby Lerasle when he wandered out and died, and his body could not be\nfound. With the aid of the scarf, Mme Morel correctly described the\nplace where his body lay. This is merely a case of knowledge by the\nsensitive of an event occurring in the interval t^-t-^, diagram I, of which\nthere are many other instances. There is no reason to suppose that the\nfact that the event was the death of the contactor makes any diiference.\nI should now like to apply the central fact of paranormal cognition to\nthese psychometric cases also\u2014I mean the fact that there is a mediating\nvehicle. The scandal about all precognition is that it appears to involve\ntemporally retrograde causality. Now, it does seem to me that it is a help\nto our minds, if we cannot abolish the scandal, at least to get it out of our\nown house. This, I venture to suggest, the mediating vehicle allows us\npartly to do. Let us say that when we make the statement that a case of\nparanormal cognition has \" occurred \", we have gone too far. All we\nknow is that we have become consciously aware that it has occurred. No,\neven that is going too far. All we know is that we have become consciously\naware of a mediating vehicle. That vehicle has been created for, or by,\nthe sensitive, and the sensitive has become aware of it. This vehicle is\nthe mediator of paranormal cognition. We know that the vehicle has\noccurred. We do not know enough to say that the paranormal cognition\nitself has occurred. We do not even know that the latter is the sort of\nthing that can occur. I do not think that we can even say that the para-\nnormal knowledge of a future event is \" acquired \". Is paranormal\nknowledge, as it exists in its essence, even strictly \"knowledge\"? I\n\fio8 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nthink it is very salutary to realize that we can scarcely make any assumptions\nat all about the paranormal faculty itself. All we know is that there is\nsornething beyond our sensible world which supplies themes for mediating\nvehicles (themselves normal psychological constructs), and that these\nthemes correspond with themes which manifest themselves in the normal,\nphysical world. These correspondences appear to be indifferent to the\ndistinctions between present, past and future.\nI suggest that when we say that a case of paranormal cognition has\n\" occurred \", this may not be strictly true. What has occurred is the\nmediating vehicle, which comes into existence in accordance with the\nnormal laws of time and causality. A theme has been supplied to the\nconstructor of this vehicle, which comes from a paranormal source where\ntime and causality do not function in the normal way. This theme is often\nof a nature such that it could not have been supplied by normal sense-\nperception or by rational inference from it. How the information comes\nto be obtainable from the paranormal source we do not know ; and I think\nthat it would be going beyond our knowledge to say that an act of para-\nnormal perception has occurred, or that any paranormal process has\noccurred. We are certainly going far beyond the evidence when we\npostulate a faculty of mind-reading, which taps conscious thoughts ; and\nanother faculty of clairvoyance, which perceives objects in the physical\nworld. These ideas are suggested by experiments of the card-guessing\norder, which, taken alone, are delusive. The evidence shows clearly that\nparanormal cognition is not an extra sense, or a plurality of extra senses,\nwhich operate in the physical world. The faculty itself lies outside the\nphysical world, as we know it ; and that is why its disregard of causality\nis less of a scandal than it would be if it occurred in the world of causality\nand physical time. But I do not pretend that the scandal is banished.\nThere still remains the question of how events in the physical world can be\n'\nforetold. We still have to face the possibility that our whole idea of\nduration and becoming may be wrong.\nPersonally, I deprecate the habit of trying to describe the paranormal\nsource by calling it a \" universal reservoir of knowledge \". Let us frankly\nadmit that it is uncomprehended by us. It is perhaps incomprehensible.\n\" Psychometry \", and those cases in which the faculty of the sensitive\nhas been directed verbally instead of by the use of a physical object, may\nconveniently be classed together as \" rapport phenomena \". Rapport\nphenomena provide an alternative explanation of evidence which seems\nsuperficially to point to naive telepathy and naive clairvoyance. The\nevidence for rapport phenomena is still of a preliminary kind. It has been\nneglected by investigators, and it is urgently necessary that it should be\nactively pursued. In psychometry I would suggest that the function of the\npsychometric object may be to influence the construction of the mediating\nvehicle. It would seem that there must be more belonging to a physical\nobject than appeals to the senses and more, even, than lies within the\nscope of physical research. At present we have no idea what this \" more \"\nconsists of. But the subject has been greatly neglected and there is a wide\nfield for experiment.\n\fParanormal Cognition 109\nStatistical Experiments\nOwing to the special character of statistical experiments, and to the\ntendency which has arisen to treat them in isolation from other evidence,\nit is necessary to deal with them separately. The use of the term \" statis-\ntical experiment\n'\n' was justified on p. 67 above. It forms a kind of research\nwhich has monopolised the attention of investigators in recent years. If it\nwere true that we could rely on the results of statistical experiments alone\nas a safe guide for the interpretation of the phenomena presented by para-\nnormal cognition, I should be inclined to agree that we might as well\nconcentrate on this type of experiment and leave other evidence in abey-\nance until more progress had been made. But this is not the case. One\nsmall point first needs to be cleared up. \" Experiment \" is frequently used\nto mean \" statistical experiment \" only, other types of experiment being\nclassed as \" spontaneous \". This use of the word \" experiment \" is\nconfusing, and in this paper I have called any deliberate attempt to produce\nparanormal cognition an \" experiment \".\nThe plan of devising experiments to be completely under the investi-\ngator's control, which can be repeated at will, and in which the results\ncan be dealt with mathematically is, of course, perfectly sound so long as\nthese desiderata can be obtained without cramping the experiment to a\npoint which renders its conclusions misleading. Even if the results of\nsuch experiments used in isolation are misleading where they concern\nthe 7iature of paranormal cognition, they are not untrustworthy when they\ndemonstrate its occurrence ; and I urge that these experiments should be\ncontinued as repetitive proofs that paranormal cognition occurs.\nIn order to show clearly how statistical experiments, when used alone,\ntend to mislead, it will be necessary to deal with a salient example\nat considerable length. I will cite two articles published by Professor\nJ. B. Rhine. One is the article entitled Telepathy and Clairvoyance\nReconsidered in the Journal of Parapsychology for September, 1945 ;\nthe other is the article entitled Precognition Reconsidered, published\nin the Journal of Parapsychology for December, 1945. An abstract of the\nformer article was printed in Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. xlviii, together with\ncomments by Mr W. Whately Carington, Dr J. Hettinger, Dr R. H.\nThouless, Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell, Prof. C. D. Broad and Mr Denys Parsons.\nIn the Abstract at the head of this article. Prof. Rhine says :\n\" E.S.P. is\ngenerally considered to consist of telepathy and clairvoyance, either of\nwhich may be precognitive. E.S.P. and precognition are regarded as\nestablished faculties. But it is submitted here that we have no clear proof\nthat a truly telepathic form of E.S.P. ever occurs. It is even hard to\ndesign a sure test for telepathy. Precognitive clairvoyance can account for\nall the '\nevidence '\non record for telepathy.\" Again, at the end of the\narticle, on p. 192, he says :\n\" But the situation must be frankly faced :\nthere is at the moment no adequately rehable case for telepathy.\"\nThese statements are quite unqualified and general, and there is no\nreason to suppose that Prof. Rhine intends them to apply to the evidence\nof statistical experiments alone. Indeed, there would be very little point\nin suggesting a hypothesis which was intended to apply to a part only of\n\fno TAe Modus Operandi 0\/ [Part\nthe evidence, since it might be contradicted by the other part. That the\nstatements are intended to apply to all the evidence generally is confirmed\nby a passage (the only one) in which Prof. Rhine refers to non-statistical\nevidence. On p. 180 he says :\n\" In the light of the present reshuffle of\nvalues, there is a temptation to turn for evidence of telepathy to the reports\nof spontaneous fi3rapsychical experiences\u2014for example, instances of\nsimilar dreams. But this evidence could hardly be conclusive, since the\nexperience is necessarily objectified in the telling and precognitive clair-\nvoyance is probably a possibility in all such cases.\" But he does not\nattempt to justify this conclusion by examining either spontaneous or\nnon-statistical experimental cases.\n'\nLet us examine Prof. Rhine's statement that \" precognitive clairvoyance\ncan account for all the '\nevidence '\non record for telepathy \". At the same\ntime we may examine the alleged evidence for clairvoyance without\nprecognition ; for on p. 177 of his article, Telepathy and Clairvoyance\nReconsidered, he says : \"... the experimental evidence of clairvoyance is\nbetter and more extensive by present standards and viewpoints than is\nthat for telepathy.\"\nTo deal first with non-precognitive clairvoyance, can it explain the\nevidence for ostensible telepathy? We have already considered, in Case 13\nabove, an example of spontaneous, ostensible telepathy ; and on pp. 79-80\nwe examined the view that it might be due to clairvoyance. The\nconclusion reached was that cases of spontaneous, ostensible tele-\npathy cannot be explained by clairvoyance because there is nothing\nto guide the supposed clairvoyant faculty to the particular target.\nTelepathy would have to be invoked to direct the clairvoyant faculty.\nThis has escaped Prof. Rhine's notice because he goes on the prin-\nciple of refusing to take spontaneous evidence into account. Here,\nthen, is one class of evidence which is ostensibly telepathic and cannot be\nexplained by clairvoyance.\nCan clairvoyance explain experimental, ostensible telepathy.? Case 12,\nquoted above on pp. 74-75, was an extract from an example of experi-\nmental telepathy. How does Prof. Rhine suggest that it is to be explained\nby clairvoyance? There are two records, one made by the agent and the\nother by the percipient. Since the percipient must have arrived at the\nfacts before he recorded them, he cannot have obtained his information\nby clairvoyantly reading his own record ; for we are now considering non-\nprecognitive clairvoyance. He must have clairvoyantly read the agent's\nrecord, then. Here we are faced with a difficulty. We are not sure that\nthe agent's record was made before the percipient received his information.\nWe are only told that agent and percipient sat at the same time. We will,\nhowever, suppose that the agent's record was made before the percipient\nreceived his impressions, and that the latter clairvoyantly read this record.\nBut then we have to explain the fact that there is a good deal of veridical\ninformation in the percipient's record which was not in the agent's. The\npercipient cannot have read it in the agent's record because it was not\nthere. What does Prof. Rhine suggest? We might suppose, perhaps, that\nthe information about the house was in the agent's mind before the experi-\nment and that she had objectified her thoughts by speaking about them\nthen, and that the agent clairvoyantly heard the sound of her voice before\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition III\nthe experiment began. But this involves us in the difficuky that clair-\nvoyance has to be provided with a delay-action, and we saw when dis-\ncussing Case 1 6 (pp. 82-83) that this involves the abandonment of the\nhypothesis of clairvoyance as it is at present defined, that is to say of what\nwe have called \" naive clairvoyance \".\nAnd there is another difficulty. If the percipient got his information by\nreading the agent's record clairvoyantly, why did not this supposed per-\nceptual faculty bring the image or the sound of the actual words to the\npercipient's mind.'' Why did it transcribe what it found written down into\ndifferent words? It is surely a curious thing for a faculty of perception to\ndo. When we listen to a lecture, our auditory faculty does not paraphrase\nthe lecturer's words and give us the sense in different verbal clothing.\nWe should be very surprised if it did ; and I doubt if we should call\nhearing a faculty of sense-perception.\nClairvoyance, then, cannot give a plausible explanation of even a simple\nexample of experimental telepathy, in spite of the fact that in experimental\ntelepathy the percipient knows where and when the experiment is being\ncarried out, and might be supposed to have the power of directing his\nclairvoyant faculty to the target, which 'he cannot do in spontaneous cases.\nNo doubt special cases might be found in which the clairvoyant explanation\ncould be made to seem a little more plausible. But on the whole it is\nextremely unplausible, and we have to ask why Prof. Rhine is so certain\nabout the power of clairvoyance to explain ostensible telepathy. Why is he\nso certain that there is any valid evidence for naive clairvoyance at all?\nIt is obviously because he is only thinking of card-guessing and similar\nexperiments. There the explanation does seem plausible. A card has\nbeen shuffled into a pack so that no one knows where it is ;\nyet the per-\ncipient correctly guesses it. What more natural than to suggest that he\nclairvoyantly perceives it? The pitfall has been set by the experimenter\nhimself when he chose card-guessing as a suitable instance of the working\nof the paranormal cognitive faculty. He chose it because he could control\ncard-events conveniently and because with them he could deal statistically\nwith chance. But the fact is that the card-event has not enough qualitative\ncontent to show what is going on. There is no verbal record to indicate\nfrom where the information comes or does not come : it does not even\nshow the fundamental fact that paranormal cognition is mediated to the\npercipient's consciousness by means of a constructed vehicle. (Mr\nWhately Carington's simple pictures were better than cards, counters or\nelectric lights as events to study, because enough spontaneity and freedom\nwas allowed to enable the mediating vehicle to show itself. Sometimes\nthe percipient's drawing approached the form of the target-picture, and\nsometimes the significance. But unfortunately Mr Carington gave very\nlittle attention to this aspect of his experiments ; and in any case the\namount of freedom, though greater than in card-guessing experiments,\nwas not great enough.)\nLet us now consider precognitive clairvoyance, which Prof. Rhine says\ncan account for all the \" evidence \" on record for telepathy. What does\nhe mean by \" precognitive clairvoyance \"? Clairvoyance is defined as a\nfaculty by means of which physical objects and events can be paranormally\nperceived. By precognitive clairvoyance it is presumably suggested that\n\f112 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nphysical objects and events can be paranormally perceived in the future.\nBut clairvoyance, we have seen, is no longer clairvoyance if we have to\nassume that it works in the past. How can it be clairvoyance if it works in\nthe future.-* We deny the definition we have given to clairvoyance if we\nmake it either retrocognitive or precognitive.\nBut if we somehow muddle past this difficulty and admit for the sake of\nargument that there can be such a thing as precognitive clairvoyance, will\nit even then explain ostensible telepathy.' Consider a case of spontaneous\nostensible telepathy, such as Case 13 above or any other. The difficulty\nwhich rules out non-precognitive clairvoyance as an explanation also rules\nout precognitive clairvoyance. The percipient does not know that there is\nany particular target to which his alleged clairvoyant faculty should be\ndirected and therefore cannot direct it to one physical object rather than to\nanother. The fact that this time the target is in the future makes no\ndifference. We may suppose if we like that the percipient is particularly\ninterested in future records of paranormal experiments. But he is also\ninterested in other future records, papers, books and objects of all kinds.\nIt is not plausible to suggest that the clairvoyant faculty can pick out the\nright paper without some guidance ; and its owner has not the knowledge\nto guide it, unless we postulate telepathy. And if this faculty was nosing\nround among future physical objects, it would certainly light on many\nothers besides the particular one in question, and we should have many\ninstances of precognitive clairvoyance which had nothing to do with\nostensible telepathy ; but these we do not get. Precognitive clairvoyance,\neven if we could plausibly postulate such a thing, is just as incapable of\nexplaining spontaneous, ostensible telepathy as is non-precognitive\nclairvoyance.\nCan it explain experimental cases of ostensible telepathy.? Here the\npercipient knows that an experiment is in progress and might be supposed\nto direct his faculty to the right target. But let us look at a piece of concrete\nevidence. Any experiment would do which has a verbal record running to\nsome length.\n26. Here is a portion of the record of a book-test. The case is recorded\nin Journal xxvii, 60. The book-test was carried out with Mrs Leonard,\nthe sitter was the Rev. W. S. Irving, and the recorder Mr Theodore\nBesterman. One item from the record will be sufficient. Mr Besterman's\nrecord reads as follows :\n[Feda] [i] Dora says I have to ask you a question here because of that\nlittle problem of not being sure, not being sure, as to what is present or\nimmediately past or immediately future. I want to know have you\nbeen doing anything with red books [book Th. B.] thinking of books\n[book, Th. B.] with rather particularly vivid shade of red on the cover or\ncovers? You need not answer particularly (I don't know) but she had to\ntell you that. It was in the form of a question in case you remembered\nhaving seen one, after. Let him write it! [Repeated six times]. Wait\na minute Dora! \" Well,\" she says, \" I have an impression of a red book.\nI see you looking at it.\"\nWe need not trouble about the result of the book-test as a whole. It was,\nin fact, an interesting and successful one. Nor need we trouble about the\n\f1 73] Paranormal Cognition 113\nquestion of whether a discarnate personality had anything to do with it.\nNor, again^are we now concerned with the question of whether it may\nhave been due to non-precognitive clairvoyance. Perhaps this latter\nexplanation seems a little more plausible in cases of this kind than it does\nin cases of spontaneous and experimental telepathy. We are only con-\ncerned with the explanation of precognitive clairvoyance. According to\nthis, Feda (or Mrs Leonard if preferred) read precognitively the verbal\nrecord which Mr Besterman was about to make and reproduced it by\nword of mouth. That is to say Feda read, clairvoyantly and precognitively,\nwith complete verbal accuracy, and then pronounced, every word that\nMr Besterman was about to write down at her dictation. Since the case is\nan experiment, there is no difficulty about the direction of the clairvoyant\nfaculty. Feda (or Mrs Leonard) knew that a book-test was being tried,\nand would, it might be supposed, direct the precognitive clairvoyant\nfaculty to the right target. The difficulty now is that the hypothesis\nobliges us to accept precognition which is absolutely accurate and word-\nperfect. There is a good deal of evidence for precognition, but none that I\nam aware of for precognition that is completely accurate. On the con-\ntrary, in every case of veridical precognition that I am acquainted with,\nthe facts as given are inaccurate and incomplete. Feda's way of getting\nout her facts is particularly like that. She beats about the bush. One\ncan see it here in her description of the red book. She describes the\n\" Bell \", the publisher's mark on the spine of the book, in a way which\nleaves no doubt about what she means ; but it is the usual ragged and\nrather wandering description. But now Prof. Rhine asks us to believe\nthat Feda suddenly abandons her habitual woolliness and reads a future\ndocument with rigid accuracy, word for word as it is going to be written.\nBut what about the words in square brackets? On two occasions, Mr\nIrving thinks that Feda says \" books \", while Mr Besterman thinks she\nsays \" book \", and inserts \" book \" with his initials in square brackets.\nSince Feda is assumed to have been reading the record with dead accuracy,\nwe must suppose that when she came to the square brackets, she ceased\nreading verbally and chose one of the words to pronounce. Why did she\ndo this? Why did she not go on reading and say :\n\" Books, square\nbrackets, book Th. B.\"?\nAgain, Feda pronounced the words, \" Let him write it! \" six times over.\nBut that was not what she found in the text. She found in the text, \" Let\nhim write it, square brackets, repeated six times.\" Why did she not say it\nas written?\nThere is surely no need to insist that the hypothesis of a verbally\naccurate reading of a future record, which obligingly ignores insertions,\nand goes back to its usual wooliness and inaccuracy when the test is over,\nis fantastically absurd. Yet wherever there is a verbal record of an experi-\nment, the precognitive-clairvoyant hypothesis presupposes this sudden\nverbal accuracy. Why is Prof. Rhine so confident that this absurd hypo-\nthesis can account for all the experimental evidence for ostensible tele-\npathy? Clearly because he has waved all the evidence aside except that\nderived from statistical experiments. And why does the hypothesis appear\nplausible in the case of statistical experiments? Because card-guessing,\nor whatever other event has been chosen in order that it shall be amenable\nH\n\f114 Modus Operandi o\/ [Part\nto statistical treatment, is so restricted and devoid of content that it does\nnot show the absurdity of the hypothesis. There is not enough quahtative\ncontent in a card-event to give a record which can be studied. All that\ncan be derived from a probability-figure is a judgment as to whether or not\nchance can reasonably be held to account for the result. There is nothing\nto give any information about the nature of paranormal cognition. To\nspeculate about the nature of paranormal cognition on the basis of statis-\ntical experiments alone is to make certain that you will be snared by delusive\nhypotheses. It is a pure illusion to suppose that statistical experiments are\n\" safe \"if used alone as an instrument of research into the nature of para-\nnormal cognition. They are safe only as far as the probability-figure-\nindicates that the number of successful guesses cannot reasonably be\nattributed to chance.\nThus naive clairvoyance, whether assumed to be precognitive or not,\ncannot account for the evidence for telepathy, spontaneous or experi-\nmental. It has the delusive appearance of accounting for it in statistical\nexperiments only.\nI will now make another quotation from Prof. Rhine's article. Telepathy\nand Clairvoyance Reconsidered. On p. i8i he defines the requirements for\na test of true clairvoyance thus :\n\" The requirements for such a test \", he\nsays, \" can be put very simply : If a subject significantly identifies cards\nextrasensorily when the order of the cards is never known and no record of\ntheir order is taken, then no opportunity is provided for precognitive\ntelepathy, and the test is one of true clairvoyance.\" But how can we be\nsure that this proves clairvoyance.? On p. 107 we saw that psychometry, or\nmore generally that \" rapport phenomena \" provide a strong reason for\ndistrusting this statement. If the sensitive has touched the cards at a\nmoment t, or even, if we take the evidence as a whole, if his interest has\nbeen directed towards the cards, there is strong reason to suspect that he\nmay know the situation that these cards will occupy at a future moment t^.\nWhen the moment \/i\narrives, no matter whether anyone else knows or ever\nwill know their situation, he will be able to say where the cards now are.\nThis will not involve clairvoyance ; it will only involve previously estab-\nlished rapport. The two are by no means the same. The latter does not\ninvolve the paranormal perception of physical objects, which clairvoyance\nasserts, although its modus operandi may still be obscure.\nIt may be true that in card-guessing experiments the subject is not, as a\nrule, allowed to touch the cards beforehand (although in some of Prof.\nRhine's matching experiments I believe that the subjects do handle one of\nthe packs used). The psychometric object, the evidence suggests, is only\none way of canalising the faculty in a given direction. Verbal direction\noften seems to have the same effect. Apparently anything which centres\nthe subject's interest on the object will do.\nPerhaps it may be argued that it is only a special type of sensitive who is\nopen to these \" rapport \" effects. It does seem to be true that the most\nsuccessful sensitives of this type are those who drop into a kind of light\nhypnosis ;\nbut in Prof. Rhine's experiments we have only to account for a\nfew sporadic successes in a very slight kind of event, and it is quite\nplausible to suggest that his subjects had enough \" rapport-faculty \" in\nthem to account for these. It is a defect of the statistical method of\n\flyj] Paranormal Cognition * .115\nresearch that very sHght traces of paranormal cognition are magnified and\ngiven an appearance of undue importance. This is not a defect if one\nmerely wishes to prove that paranormal cognition exists ;\nbut it is a defect\nif one wishes to study its nature. I do not see that we can rule out \" rap-\nport \" effects as a possible explanation of the evidence which Prof. Rhine\nconfidently asserts to be proof of clairvoyance in card-guessing.\nIt is the same with the alleged evidence for clairvoyance derived from\nProf. Rhine's experiments in psycho-kinesis. He argues that some of the\nstrongest evidence for clairvoyance is to be found in dice-throwing\nexperiments. He says that dice could not be made to fall in particular\npositions unless the subject were clairvoyantly aware of their positions as\nthey were rolling. Prof. Broad {Proc. xlviii, 22-3) has pointed to the\nnaivety of this assumption. I can only endorse this, and ask Prof. Rhine,\nand those who treat evidence as he does, to come out of their statistical\nisolation for a moment and consider the marked-chair experiment (Case 25,\np. loi above), and then to ask themselves whether they are justified in\nthinking of paranormal cognition in terms of additional senses which\nwork in the space-time world. The marked-chair experiment, and the\nother evidence I have quoted abovCj show that paranormal cognition is a\ntotally diff'erent thing from what statistical workers have made up their\nminds that it is. Even if we had to assume that knowledge of the positions\nof the dice were necessary for psycho-kinesis, a slight previously established\nrapport between the subject and the dice might be sufficient to provide it\nwithout the necessity for clairvoyance.\nI suggest that there is no clear evidence for what I have called \" naive\nclairvoyance \", that is to say for a paranormal sense by means of which\nphysical objects and events can be directly perceived.\nAgain, in his article. Precognition Reconsidered {Journal of Parapsycho-\nlogy, December 1945), Prof. Rhine speaks of Pcg-T (precognitive tele-\npathy), Pcg-C (precognitive clairvoyance) and Pcg-SP (precognitive\nsensory perception) as if these were separate faculties which could be\nreasonably supposed to exist. To make assumptions like this, without\nconsuhing the whole of the relevant evidence, is, I maintain, merely to get\noneself fogged.\nI do not wish it to be supposed that I am attacking Prof. Rhine or that\nI am attacking statistical experiments. I am.protesting against a wholly\nunscientific way of dealing with evidence. If they are not to be misled\nand are not to bring psychical research into disrepute, investigators must\ncease to isolate themselves in one particular type of experiment and must\ndeal with all the evidence impartially.\nProf. Broad, in the course of some remarks he makes on my comments on\nProf. Rhine's article {Proc. xlviii, 25) says that he is puzzled to know\nwhether I really think that there is any known alternative method of\ndiscovering the laws of phenomena beside that of experiment, when by\n\" experiment \" is understood the attempt to analyse and control conditions\nand to vary them one at a time. I certainly think that that is the best\nmethod of discovering the laws of phenomena where the method can be\napplied without obscuring the phenomena. I do not advocate the aban-\ndonment of experiment, but only the abandonment of a particular type of\nexperiment which does obscure the phenomena. I do not even advocate\n\f1 1 6 The Modus Operandi of [Part\nthe abandonment of that, but only that it should be regarded as an auxiliary\nand be supplemented by other forms of experiment which do not obscure\nthe phenomena. In psychical research the phenomena we wish to investi-\ngate have a spontaneity of their own, and it is only by allowing them to\nretain some degree of spontaneity that we can become acquainted with\ntheir nature. If we confine our attention to a type of paranormal event\nwhich excludes that spontaneity, we shall be misled as to the nature of\nparanormal phenomena.\nProf. Broad says :\n\" There is obviously nothing in the experimental\nmethod as such which compels us to confine it to the investigation of\nfeeble instances of paranormal phenomena. Our trouble is that we do not\nat present know how to produce at will strong and persistent instances.\"\nStrong and persistent instances all have too much qualitative content to be\ndealt with statistically ; and to control them completely would be to\neliminate their spontaneity. It is not the experimental method as such\nwhich has to be abandoned, but the particular type of experiment which\nobscures the nature of paranormal cognition. The experimental method\nneeds to be adapted to the nature of the subject-matter. In statistical\nexperiments the investigator is controlling the wrong things. He ought to\nbe controlling the formation of the mediating vehicle. Actually he sim-\nplifies the event to such an extent, in order to control it, that the pheno-\nmenon he wishes to investigate has no chance to reveal itself.\nOn p. 21, in a paragraph entitled \" Legitimate and illegitimate con-\nclusions \", Prof. Broad says :\n\" Suppose that there is adequate evidence\nfor paranormal cognition in cases where telepathy is excluded. And\nsuppose that it should be found that, when experiments are done under\nconditions where clairvoyance is excluded, there is not evidence for para-\nnormal cognition. Then the conclusions which could legitimately be\ndrawn are the following : (i) In an experimental set-up of this nature, and\nwith such subjects as have been used in the experiment, the presence of\nclairvoyant conditions is hotli necessary and sufficient to ensure a detectable\namount of paranormal cognition.\" This is the first conclusion, which I\nam alone concerned with. It seems to me to be sound only if we confine\nourselves to the results of statistical experiments. Suppose that there is\nevidence that paranormal cognition occurs when the conditions for clair-\nvoyance are presfent and the conditions for telepathy absent. Can we be\nsure that pre-established rapport does not account for the results? In\nthat case, the conditions for clairvoyance, though present, would be neither\nnecessary nor sufficient to produce the result. What right have we to\nignore the possibility of pre-established rapport? The only reason, so\nfar as I can see, which could be given, is that evidence for it is not produced\nby the kind of experiment which some of us prefer. It may be that the\nevidence for psychometric rapport is not at present very strong. That is\nour fault for having neglected the subject. But that could not be given as\na reason for refusing to examine and increase it. I maintain that it is not\nsafe to draw conclusions about the nature of paranormal cognition from\nthe results of statistical experiments alone.\n\f173]\nParanormal Cognition 117\nSummary of Conclusions\nThe main points of this paper may be summarised as follows :\n(1) Paranormal cognition is not a conscious process. Its product alone is\nrevealed to consciousness.\n(2) This product is here called a \" mediating vehicle \". It is sub-\nconsciously created by the percipient.\n(3) The mediating vehicle is not a paranormal phenomenon but is the\nproduct of psychological machinery which all possess. It may take the\nform of a sensory hallucination or of an impulse or of automatic verbaliza-\ntion or of a dream.\n(4) The same vehicle which mediates paranormal cognition also\nmediates subconscious expectations and beliefs or normally acquired\nknowledge which has not reached consciousness independently. In these\nlatter cases, neither the vehicle nor the material is paranormal.\n(5) Something which may be broadly called a subconscious motive\nunderlies the formation of mediating vehicles in normal and paranormal\ncases alike.\n(6) Telepathy does not consist in the transmission of the agent's\nconscious thought to the percipient. This supposed \" thought-trans-\nference \" is here called \" naive telepathy \".^\n(7) The subliminal awareness, which forms the core of paranormal\ncognition in cases of apparent telepathy, is not an awareness of the details\nwhich appear in the mediating vehicle but is more nearly akin to awareness\nof a proposition.\n(8) It was suggested that the evidence points to the view that paranormal\ncognition, in its essence, may not be an occurrence. It may be the mediating\nvehicle only which occurs.\n(9) The evidence for \" travelling clairvoyance \" and \" psychometry\n\"\nshows that distant mental and physical events, unknown to the percipient,\ncan be described by certain types of subject who {a) are verbally directed\nto the scene or {b) hold objects which have been touched by actors in the\nscene. These have been called jointly \" rapport phenomena \".\n(10) There is evidence to show {a) that some sensitives can know future\nevents which will happen to the psychometric objects they touch, and\n{b) that some can know future events which will happen to persons to\nwhom their attention is verbally directed.\n(11) Taken together, {a) and [b) in (10) suggest a possible alternative\nexplanation for evidence which apparently points to clairvoyance.\n(12) The hypothesis of clairvoyance, understood as the paranormal\nperception of physical events and objects (here called \" naive clair-\nvoyance \"), whether combined with precognition or not, cannot reasonably\nexplain spontaneous, ostensible telepathy, because in spontaneous cases\nthe subject has no knowledge of the event in question and cannot therefore\ndirect the supposed clairvoyant faculty to the appropriate target.\nWith regard to experimental telepathy, non-precognitive clair^^oyance\nis highly unplausible as an explanation because the percipient often\nmanifests veridical cognition of which there is no contemporary, physical\n1 The agent's role is probably directive rather than transmissive.\n\fii8 T\/je Modus Operandi o\/ [Part\ncounterpart. Precognitive clairvoyance is still more unplausible because\nit involves the hypothesis that precognition becomes, on occasion, suddenly\ncompletely word-perfect and accurate.\nA further and general objection to naive clairvoyance is that the physical\nobject or event which forms its subject-matter is often not contemporary\nwith the subject's experience. Naive clairvoyance, then, has to be com-\nbined with retrocognition or precognition, and in either case ceases to be a\nfaculty of sense-perception, which it is defined as being.\n(13) Statistical experiments, which appear, if regarded in isolation, to\npoint to the existence of naive telepathy and naive clairvoyance, are mis-\nleading because the events they employ are too restricted to reveal the true\nnature of paranormal cognition, and in particular the fact that it is mediated\nto consciousness.\n(14) The attempt at present being made to carry out statistical research\nin isolation from every other kind of research is in the highest degree\nunscientific, misleading and dangerous. All evidence bearing on para-\nnormal cognition should be treated impartially. Experiments should be\nplanned and hypotheses formed in the light of all relevant evidence.\nTwo Questions\nMy plea that it is useless to restrict research in paranormal cognition to\nless informative events, because these events enable us to exercise the\nparticular kind of control we wish to exercise, and to deal statistically with\nchance, is likely to be met by two questions. I shall probably be asked :\n(i) Can we afford to relinquish our control of the experimental conditions,\nand (2) can we afford to dispense with the mathematical evaluation of\nchance?\nThe main answer to both questions is simple. We must do so if we\nwish to make any genuine progress in understanding paranormal cognition.\nWith regard to the first question, we are not asked to relinquish all control\nof the conditions. If the right subject be employed, he is amenable to\nverbal direction and responsive to question and answer ; and this provides\nsufficient control for practical purposes. With regard to the second\nobjection, it is the qualitative poverty of the statistical type of event which\nrenders the statistical evaluation of chance necessary. Given experi-\nmental results by a good subject, they are as a rule sufficiently rich in\nqualitative, veridical items to rule out chance as a reasonable hypothesis,\nunless the proposition be deliberately held that a great deal more can be\nput down to chance when it occurs in connection with the paranormal\nthan can be put down to it in connection with any other subject. This\nproposition was dealt with in an address which I delivered to this Society\nin June, 1945.\nSurely no one would insist on experimenting with events which give\nrise to misleading theoretical conclusions because they enable him to\ndeal with chance statistically!\n\f173] Paranormal Cognition 119\nA Suggested Programme for Experiment\n(1) The first essential in research is that the evidence should be treated\nimpartially. It is useless to confine our attention to a particular type of\nexperiment, whose method appeals to us, and to ignore all phenomena\nwhich cannot be dealt with by its means.\n(2) Research should not be broken up or isolated. Experiments\nshould be planned in the light of past experience and should not start\nde novo. Every experiment should be framed to answer a particular\nquestion suggested by past evidence.\n(3) The pioneer work in paranormal cognition referred to above (which\nis admittedly sketchy) should be vigorously followed up. It shows that\nwhat is actually observed is a vehicle constructed within the subject's\npersonality to mediate paranormal knowledge to consciousness. The\nstudy of this vehicle should be the main task of investigators.\n(4) Definite experiments are needed to confirm and carry further\nthe pioneer work in \" travelling clairvoyance \" and \" psychometry \".\nThe study of errors should be helpful here, and the investigator would\nfind ch. V. in Part iv of Osty's Supernormal Faculties in Man instructive.\n(5) Experiments should be devised to throw light on the indirectness\nand symbolism introduced into the mediation of paranormal cognition.\nThese would probably establish the fact there is no such thing as naive\nclairvoyance, or direct paranormal perception of the physical world. For\nexample, a subject might be asked to describe the interior of a room un-\nknown to him. Then a person might be introduced into the room who\nwould carry on a conversation with himself in dialogue. It would then be\nseen whether the subject described the physical fact (one person talking to\nhimself) or the suggested physical fact (two people having a conversation).\nDetails of experiment, however, would soon suggest themselves.\n(6) The whole question of \"psychometry\" as well as of \"verbal\nrapport \" needs to be experimentally investigated. Osty's conclusions on\npp. 13 1-2 of Supernormal Faculties of Man, need to be verified. The\n\" Gold Pencil-Case \" and \" Marked Chair \" experiments (Cases 24 and 25\nabove), which indicate that a sensitive subject, by touching an object,\ncan know its future history, should in particular be verified.\n(7) The right type of sensitive for this experimental work appears to be\none who easily enters a light state of hypnosis. Such sensitiveness should\nbe sought diligently and selected with care.\n(8) Experiments are needed to reveal as much as possible of the nature\nof the paranormal source behind the mediating vehicle. This will\nprobably be difficult. I suggest that what is needed here is synthesis\nrather than analysis, and that information from various sources should be\nbrought to converge on the problem. The paranormal source, as it\nreveals itself in mediumship, in automatic writing, in artistic inspiration,\nand in mystical experience should be studied, since the problem is to\ngrasp the size of this source and to get it into something like a right\nperspective. Restricted laboratory experiments are of no use alone.\n(9) Statistical experiments have their value, but as a method of inquiry\ninto the nature of paranormal cognition, this is very limited. They can\n\fI20 The Modus Operandi of Paranormal Cognition Abstract [Part 173]\ndetect small traces of paranormal cognition and can give innumerable\ndemonstrations of its occurrence. Since this appears to make a great\nimpression on the scientific mind, it is desirable to go on repeating these\nexperiments and advertising them in scientific circles.\nThis paper may appear to some in the light of an attack on research.\nIt is far from being that : it is intended to be a stimulus to research of a\nmore constructive kind, while at the same time it is an endeavour to correct\nan unbalanced and unscientific method of dealing with evidence.\nMy thanks are due to Professor H. H. Price for kindly helping me to\ngive clearer expression to certain philosophical points which arose in the\ncourse of this paper.\n\fA NEW HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING TRANCE-\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nC.

Conclusion ; The Psychic emanation. The non-material body.\nPrevious Evidence from Trance which is not Explicable\nBY Telepathy from the Sitters\nMuch has been written about the mediumship of Mrs Osborne Leonard.\nThe Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research contain many\narticles on her sittings and, in addition to the evidence of identity which\nCommunicators have given, record successive types of evidence which\nwere apparently devised and carried through by the Communicators\nthemselves and not first suggested by sitters.\nOf these we find :\nBook Tests. See S.P.R. Proceedings for April 1921, pp. 241-400, and\nJournal ior December 1936, pp. 304-307.\nTests from the public press given previous to publication. See Journal\nfor May 1921, pp. 89-107, and February 1925, pp. 18-23.\nProxy Sittings. See Proceedings for May 1933, pp. 139-185 ;\nProceedings\nfor December 1935, pp. 439-519.\nAnd finally. Proxy sittings so arranged by an intermediary that the sitter\nhad no contact with the persons desiring messages from deceased friends.\nSee Proceedings for July 1939, pp. 257-306.\nStudy of the above shows that telepathy from sitters can no longer be\nheld to explain the results obtained.\n\f122 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nOther suggestions have been put forward in the endeavour to provide\nan alternative to the idea that purported Communicators are actually\npresent at the sittings and giving the information which comes from the\nmedium's lips. These suggestions include telepathic action of an almost\nunlimited character, whereby the information is supposed to be derived\nfrom any person, however unknown and distant, who might at any time\nhave possessed the information ; while other suggestions go to the\nextreme of positing universal consciousness, or unlimited community of\nmind, or a pooled memory of the human race from which the medium\nselects appropriate items!\nThe hypothesis we now put forward, together with an outline of the\nfacts on which it is based, substitutes for these vague suggestions a claim\nfor the accuracy of that which has been consistently stated by the Com-\nmunicators ;\nnamely, that the messages are given by discarnate persons\nwho come to the sitting for this purpose. It also supports the assertion\nof Communicators that they still have bodies\u2014bodies of substance\u2014\nalthough not formed of earthly matter.\nThese statements are stoutly supported by Feda, Mrs Leonard's\nControl, who, for the greater part of the sitting, voices through the\nmedium's lips what Communicators wish to say.\nHere I should remark that the question of Feda's personality does not\ncome into this paper. Whether she is an individual entirely distinct from\nthe medium, or combined with the medium, or only an aspect of the\nmedium's mentality\u2014none of these questions need detain us. Let it\nsuffice that when the name appears in this article it indicates the \" Con-\ntrol \" who speaks through Mrs Leonard's lips. Not that the question is\nunimportant, but simply that it is irrelevant to the hypothesis about to be\nset forth. Personally I believe Feda to be a distinct individual, usually\nresident in the Beyond, but allotting some of her time to work on earth.\nIn that aspect of her personality which one sees during her control I am\nmore familiar with her character, idiosyncrasies and habits of thought\nthan I am with those of the majority of my acquaintances on earth ; but\nthen I have listened to her at fairly frequent intervals during the last\ntwenty-eight years!\nThe Hypothesis now offered is based on New Evidence\nRELATING TO DiRECT-VoiCE WhISPERS\nIt may be convenient if the hypothesis is at once stated in brief outline,\nso that readers can appreciate more easily the links of evidence on which\nit is based.\nIt is as follows : the Communicator comes to the sitting in that body\nwhich is now normally his in the Etherial Realms. He takes up the posi-\ntion, some two or three feet in front of the medium, which Feda finds\nmost convenient for her reception of the messages. He speaks his message\nin words during those periods of the sitting which favour this method of\ncommunication, while for other periods it seems more eiTective to give it\nby telepathy. The difference between these periods in a sitting is caused\nby variations in the output of an emanation which flows from the medium,\nwith possible additions from sitter and note-taker. This emanation is\n\f173] ^ New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 123\ntermed by Feda \" The Power \" ; it varies in density from moment to\nmoment, and its gradual exhaustion brings progressive difficulty in com-\nmunication and finally stops it altogether. During the sitting both medium\nand sitter are within this field of psychic energy, which, although but\nrarely luminous itself, yet renders visible to Feda any object or person,\nincarnate or discarnate, who is also within its limited range. Hence\nFeda's ability to describe the personal appearance of Communicators.\nI have reserved until last that quality of the emanation or psychic\nenergy which is most important for my hypothesis, namely that it carries\nto Feda the spoken words which she hears more or less plainly, although\nthe sitter usually hears nothing whatever save what comes from the\nmedium's lips. I say \" usually \" because of the exception which will be\ndescribed hereafter at some length. This is an occasional utterance of\na word, or words, in a clear and distinct whisper, akin to what one is\naccustomed to hear from Communicators at Direct Voice (or \" Trumpet \")\nsittings with what are termed physical mediums.\nHow is it that, \\^hile the greater part of the message is unheard by the\nsitter, he is able to hear these occasional spoken whispers.' I believe that\nthe explanation will be found in the action of the before-mentioned\nemanation. This emanation seems to be a substance having relations with\nphysical matter and also with the etherial substance of the next stage of\nexistence. It is sufficiently akin to the latter for use by the discarnate\nCommunicator, and it is sufficiently akin to earth to affect the air of the\nseance room, not at all times, but when moved more violently than it is\nby the usual speaking of the Communicator. When the latter speaks with\nspecial vigour the vibrations of the emanation set up secondary vibra-\ntions in air, and it is these secondary vibrations which the sitter hears as a\nclear whisper.\nExamples of the Direct-Voice Whisper\nBefore giving a more detailed analysis of these whispered words it may\nbe well to offer some examples. I quote the few preceding words, then\nthe Direct Voice whisper, and add Feda's reaction to it.\nFeda : Part of it may happen earlier, but he feels\u2014What? The fill\n\u2014\nWhat?\nD. V. : Fulfilment.\nFeda : The actual fulfilment of the prophecy, etc.\nFeda : That is when we usually av\u2014 av\n\u2014\nD.

V. : Awareness.\nFeda : Awareness of the existence of all these opportunities.\nFeda: This touches on another aspect of our\u2014Our what? Our work?\nD. V. : Our group work.\nFeda : You cannot have sustained\n\u2014\n\f124 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nD.

V. : Company.\nFeda : a company present, etc.\n\u2022\nFeda : (Following an explanation came the remark\u2014\n)\nD. V. : You see, Charlie.\nFeda : You do see, Charlie, etc.\n(A new line of thought was commenced with the words\u2014\n)\nD. V. : Of course some individuals\nFeda : Of course some individuals obtain, etc.\nVery frequently the D. V. speaks the one word, \" Yes \", as in the following :\nC. D. T. : I have already done that.\nD. V. : Yes.\nMy Communicators rarely speak more than six or seven words in this\ndirect voice at one time, but my friends, Mr and Mrs Conan Shaw,\nreceived the following unusually long sentences, the Communicator being\nan old Clergyman.\nSitters asked a question which was answered thus :\nD. V. : \/ thought it was my duty\u2014custom, perhaps.\nSitter : But there must be essence of good in it?\nD. V. : \/ should not have stuck to it if it had ?iot been. It mav be it is\n'':\npaving the way to a universal knowledge of God, beyond the outside brick\nwalls or institutions.\nThe unusual length of the above, coupled with the fact that Mr and Mrs\nConan Shaw have had some initial success in their home sittings, where\nthey seek to develop for the direct voice, suggest that they contribute to\nthe circle of emanation much more than do other of Mrs Leonard's\nsitters.\nEvidence for the Reality of a Mediumistic Emanation\nWhen the late Dr Osty was studying Rudi Schneider in Paris he became\nconvinced that Rudi could, at times, produce something which, although\ninvisible and intangible, obscured infra-red rays.\nA group of investigators, wishing to verify this, invited Rudi to London\nfor a series of experiments at the rooms of the Society for Psychical\nResearch. Their findings are recorded in the Proceedings for June 1933,\nfrom which the following quotations are taken :\np. 274. On nearly every occasion many movements of the galvanometer\ncoil were recorded. . . . These movements of the galvanometer coil,\nwhich confirm Osty's discovery, are very remarkable. ... In addition,\nthe bell in series with a selenium cell rang on two or three occasions,\nindicating an absorption of at least 50% of the infra'-red radiation!\nWhatever it is that affects the galvanometer, or bell circuits, appears to\nemanate from Rudi, since the ray absorption sometimes synchronised\nwith his breathing and sometimes took place immediately after he said it\nwould.\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 125\np. 275. The many records of large movements definitely indicate a\nI\nconsiderable variation of the current in the galvanometer which cannot\n'\nbe due to any disturbance other than the absorption of the infra-red\nradiation. In view of the distance of the medium from the apparatus and\n1\nthe fact that he was always under vigilant control, it would appear that this\n'\nabsorption is due to some agency at present unknown, emanating from\nRudi himself.\np. 277. \" Rudi-OIga \", while controlled by Dr Fraser-Harris, was\nmoving various objects, including the curtains of the cabinet. I then\nheard a loud bump, which sounded as if the table in front of the cabinet\nhad been overturned. At the same instant the room was illuminated by\nthe lamp which was the source of the infra-red beam. (It was afterwards\ndiscovered that the table had in fact been turned upside down, and in so\ndoing had jerked a thread which was attached to the support block of the\ninfra-red projector, causing the filter to fall off). After an interval which I\nfind difficult to estimate\u2014but I should say it was of the order of one\nsecond\u2014I heard another crash almost immediately in front of me. I at\nonce rose from my seat, and found Rudi quite limply on his side on the\nfloor, and breathing very gently, slowly and regularly. After covering\nhim with some dark material which I was given, I assisted in lifting him\nback to his chair. During the whole of this period he made no movement\nof any kind, and appeared to be completely unconscious.\nThis incident relating to Rudi's fall when exposed to sudden light bears\nout what has been recorded by many investigators about the shock effect\nof sudden light- falling upon a medium in a dark sitting. It brings to\nmind an observation of my own which was due to an unusual accident.\nI had brought my friend, Dr Dyson, to a sitting for direct voice where we\njoined a circle of some ten other people. It was a summer evening and\nthere had been some difficulty in blocking the glass panels of the door to\nexclude the evening light. The window was more easily blacked out, and\nthe sitting proceeded for a time in the usual manner. The child Control\nspoke easily and frequently, not using the trumpet which served as a\nmegaphone for the Communicators. The medium had on this occasion\nchosen me to sit next to her and to hold her left hand, while another\nsitter held the right hand. At one time we heard two voices speaking\nsimultaneously. Many voices spoke to the various sitters. Presently I\nheard a voice speaking to Dr Dyson, who was sitting opposite me in a\ndirect line with the door. My face was turned in this direction while I\nlistened to his conversation with the voice. Suddenly a flood of light\nshone through the glass panels of the door where they were imperfectly\ncovered by the drapery we had hung over them. A cleaner had come to\nsweep the passage and had switched on the lights for that purpose. This\nlight enabled me to see part of the trumpet distinctly ; it was suspended\nin air some five feet from the floor and pointing to Dr Dyson. Then it\nfell, and the voice of the Control came from low down and feebly, asking\nus to sing. After the singing it said, \" We had better be going \" and the\nsitting closed. The incident of most interest for our present consideration\nis, that, at the moment when light shone into the room, I felt the medium's\nhand give a sudden jerk, followed by a violent trembling which continued\nuntil the sitting's close. Only when the light was turned on did I release\n\f126 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nthe hand, and I noticed that she snatched out a handkerchief and applied\nit to her mouth. On withdrawal it was red with blood. Whatever it was\nwhich had been drawn from her would seem to have snapped sharply\nback to her mouth and throat, causing superficial damage to the tissues.\nWhether this something was a dense emanation, or what is termed ecto-\nplasm, it was evidently something essential to the phenomena of levitation\nand of direct voice, whether the clear voice of the Control, or the loud\nwhispers of Communicators. Its withdrawal left no power for even the\nControl to continue speaking.\nA remark by my father, made eight years later, seems worth quoting\nhere :\nJ. D. T. With those mediums whose output of power has to be of a\nsudden kind, a great and very sudden projection of the etheric body takes\nplace, not a gradual one as it is with this medium. And whatever action\ntook place at that moment which might be in the nature of an interruption,\nanything which interfered with the requisite conditions for the production\nof the phenomenon, might have very disastrous eiTect on the physical\norganism of the medium, owing to the sudden indrawing of the etheric\ninto the aura again.\nEvidence for the emanation comes from movements without contact.\nFor illustration of this I might refer to the Report by a Committee of the\nLondon Dialectical Society. On p. 1 1 we find the description of movements\nobtained with an ordinary dining-table around which were a number of\nsitters maintaining a distance from the table of eighteen inches. On one\noccasion the eleven sitters saw this table move thirteen times, and this\nwithout contact, or possibility of contact, with anyone present. These\nmovements were in different directions and some of them were made as\nrequested by various members of the group.\nOr reference might be made to Dr W. F. Crawford's experiments with\nthe Goligher circle, as recorded in his books. Experiments in Psychic\nScience, and Reality of Psychic Phenotnena. In both these he describes\nthe levitation of a table without contact. The late Sir William Barrett,\nF.R.S., once visited the circle to watch Crawford's work, and he informed\nme that, on one occasion, he pressed forcefully upon the table in an endea-\nvour to prevent its levitation, but in vain. He then sat upon the table, and\nit raised him several feet from the floor. Lady Barrett, who had been\npresent at these experiments, told me that while Sir William was levitated\nwith the table she was feeling with her umbrella underneath the table legs\nand satisfied herself that no cords or implements of any kind were being\nused. All was clear ; the umbrella met with no obstructions.\nI was first personally impressed by the reality of an emanation when\nhaving a table sitting with Mrs Leonard. My wife and Mrs Leonard\nplaced their hands lightly on the bamboo table while I took down the\nletters as they were spelled out by tilts. Then my wife and I exchanged\nplaces. Messages of an evidential character were thus produced; When\nMrs Leonard suggested that my wife and I should sit at the table we did so,\nbut no movements followed. Mrs Leonard then placed her fingers\nlightly upon the exact centre of the table, where it would have been\ndifficult, or probably impossible, for her to move it by pressure. The\nresult was immediate ; for the tilts commenced and continued until the\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 127\nmedium gradually withdrew her hand. As she did so, the table slowed\ndown and quickly ceased all movement. Again the medium's hand was\nplaced on it as before and again the movements continued. It was a clear\ndemonstration that something essential to the table movement proceeded\nfrom Mrs Leonard and that neither my wife nor I could produce this\nmysterious something. When, some years later, an occasional word or two\nin the direct voice began to sound in my sittings, my attention was drawn\nto this mysterious something, and I proceeded to question both Control\nand my Communicators about it. Their replies may be summarised as\nfollows : .\n\u2022\nWhat Communicators say about the Emanation\nThere is a ring of power around the medium which may extend a\nvarying distance. It surrounds both Communicator and sitter.\nIt flows from the medium throughout the sitting, but fluctuates more or\nless and is exhausted towards the close, so bringing the sitting to an end.\nIt charges the atmosphere around the medium and sitter ; the medium\nproduces it and the Communicator uses it. Its outer limit may be some\nfew feet from the medium. (When I took my brother-in-law to a sitting,\nshortly after my sister's passing, she began to speak and then suddenly\nceased. It was explained to me by the Control that, as my sister moved\naway to where her husband was sitting, she passed out of the circle of\npower. The Control could not then hear her words.)\nExperienced Communicators can feel how near to the medium their\nbest results are obtained. Often, in moments of excitement, they approach\ntoo close and Feda then urges them to go further away because, when too\nnear, she gets a choking feeling and the medium begins to cough.\nCommunicators can rarely see the power ; but they feel its influence.\nOn one occasion, when I was questioning my father about it, Feda said,\n\" He keeps pacing backwards and forwards. What are you doing? He is\ndoing it purposely, and says, It is something which I suspected and am now\ntracing. I cannot see where the power ends here, but I do feel a diff'erent\nsensation when I move out of it and when I move into it again. I feel a\nslight tingling, but very, very slight, as I come into it.\" My father has\nrepeatedly mentioned that his mind is not so clear after entering the circle\nof power, yet only when within it can he transmit thought in words. The\nPower seems to have a slightly anaesthetising effect, not by any means a\ncomplete one, but sufficient to produce a slight numbing of his perception\nand memory.\nMy sister once said of her condition when within the circle of power :\nIt is a no-man's land between the two conditions, yours and ours. . . .\nIt is supposed that communication concerns earth people and spirit people,\nwhereas there is also the peculiar bridgeway which has to be used and which\nis neither one nor the other, but has some of the characteristics of each.\nMedium and sitter are, in part, working in a condition which is not entirely\nyours, and we work in one which is not entirely ours. It is a pooling of\nresources which creates the bridge.\"\nJ. D. T. :\n\" Our vibrations are not operative by themselves on your\nplane.

Drayton Thomas [Part\nwe have to make use of that in you which corresponds most nearly to ours,\nbut which is not ours.\"\nEtta :\n\" Sending words is more difficult than sending ideas ; for the\npower fluctuates like wind on windy days when you may hear a rush and it\ndies down again before gathering force and blowing up once more. So the\npower ebbs and flows. . . . Our trouble is that we cannot tell when it is\nebbing, and so we waste time trying to get something on when it is ebbing,\nwhich could only be done when the power is full.\" She added, \" I think\npower is weakest at the beginning and end of a sitting ; of course weaker\nat the end, but towards the middle of a sitting it is at its strongest.\"\n(This I have been able to confirm, as will be shown on a later page.)\nBefore commencing my sitting in November 1924 I asked Mrs Leonard\nif she knew what Feda meant when speaking of \" the power \". I found\nthat Mrs Leonard was familiar with the term but had no theory about\nit. She noticed that she was less alert in mind immediately after a sitting\nand if taking her ball exercises then would miss the ball much more often\nthan she would do before a sitting. In earlier days she had frequently\ngiven four sittings daily and could not suggest how the power was recovered\nbetween them, and supposed that Feda brought them to an end before the\npower was expended.\nFeda presently remarked that my father had heard the conversation\nbefore the sitting began and he would give his opinion. Among other\nthings he said the following :\nI have vocal organs and on my own plane my voice is heard, but that of\nwhich larynx and tongue are formed is not the same as yours. The power,\nthe mysterious power, helps just for a moment to clothe my larynx with\nmaterial sufficiently like yours, a kind of counterfeit of yours, so that I may\nuse it for communicating. But I do not use it at a distance from the\nmedium, I have to come very close to do it. This projection of power can\nonly travel a certain distance from the medium, so I have to come forward\nto catch it, as it were, or draw it. This cannot be done all the time. I\nnever know when I shall catch sufficient from the medium to clothe or\nthicken my larynx with it. This power from the medium is a very indivi-\ndual part of her, and that is the reason why, in many instances, the voice\nmay be tinctured with a tone of the medium's voice or by some peculiarity\nof hers.\n(Looking back it would seem that, at this early date of my inquiry into\nthe nature of the power and the occasional manifestation of direct voice,\nmy father was groping for the explanation and supposed that his direct\nvoice whispers were caused by direct action on air owing to the partial\nmaterialisation of vocal organs.)\nAt another early sitting I asked my father if he could see \" the power \".\nHe replied that usually he did not see it and was only conscious of its\npresence, but that there were certain conditions in which it might be seen.\nHe added. We feel, rather than see, the power.\nMy wife was with me at a sitting when we had a Communicator who,\nby various evidence, proved himself to be W. L. W., an old friend of my\nwife's family. He had been interested in science and had an alert mind.\nFeda (speaking for W. L. W.) : This is so interesting ; here I am in this\nwonderful condition and I can see you, not very clearly, but I see you are\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 129\nthere. Most extraordinary! You do not see me, do you? Yet it looks\ndarker where you are and lighter where I am, so you should see me. It\nlooks very misty, foggy, where you are.\nWhat is that spark? (Feda interjects that there is no spark, and I\nremark that possibly he is alluding to the lamp.)\nYes, I see you in a circle. (I suggest that it may be the circle of power.)\nYour father says that is what it is. Mr W. L. W. says, I do not know\nif you would call it that, or whether it is my circle of vision. I expect your\nfather is right, but I want to find out for myself and think it out for myself.\nOne thing that strikes me much is the absence of colour, not only as I see\nyou now, but as I saw you when I came to observe you address a meeting\nrecently. It seems so very dull and drab. There is more colour in the\nrealm where I now live. . . . My new clear vision operates on my own \u2022\nplane, but apparently needs a great deal of adjustment to enable me to see\nclearly onto yours. ... At this moment I see (here Feda interjects, \" It is\nnot smoke, but let him say what he calls it.\")\u2014I see smoke circling round\nyour wife. Mr John says, That is the power, the etheric power, which is\nnot very steady round Clara, and it looks to him to be moving about,\nwafting, and yet it is steadier around Feda. Your father says, that is not\naltogether due to a psychic cause, as Clara is sitting in a physical draught\njust sufficient to move the outer circle of the power ; but it is interesting\nthat W. L. W. should notice that the power is denser near the medium\nand also more luminous. It apparently has a self-luminous quality which\nI had not noticed.\nThen, at the next sitting :\nJ. D. T. : Our friend last time was wrong in likening the power to\nsmoke.\nC. D. T. : I was surprised that he could see the power, as I had under-\nstood that it was usually invisible to you.\nJ. D. T. : It is not always visible. Indeed he might come a hundred\ntimes and not be able to perceive it in that way.\nC. D. T. : Do you think he was mistaken about it?\nJ. D. T. : He was mistaken in likening it to smoke. He saw something,\nsay a corner of the power, which was concentrated round Clara and which\nwas being disturbed by a slight current of air which probably came from\nthe window by which she sat. It was a circumstance which might not\nfrequently happen.\nAt another time my father replied to a question as follows :\nTake this sitting, for sake of concrete illustration. When I arrived here\ntoday I came travelling through the atmosphere. On coming near, I look\nat the medium and at you, and see around you a circle looking like mist.\n(This would seem to hav^ been one of the rare occasions when it was\nvisible.) Now, I could stand outside this circle of mist and give messages\ntelepathlcally, as is often done. But I prefer to pass inside this circle of\nmist, which is etheric power given off by you two. Then my communica-\ntion commences. The dry atmosphere today enables Feda to hear my\nvoice-vibrations. I do not put myself into any particular mental frame,\nbut much depends on the conditions which I find awaiting me. The\ncircle of power varies both in quality and quantity ; if thick and heavy,\ncommunication is difficult and I try several times to get my ideas through ;\nI\n\f130 C. Drayton Thomas '\n[Part\nbut when clear, it is like telephoning over a clear line. Today I use voice,\nbut usually it is done telepathically and ideas are sent rather than words.\"\n25th April, 1924. Etta controlling.\nWith most people the power is so embedded in the physical that it\nnever gets sufficiently near the surface to be used by itself.\nC. D. T. : Then with this medium a certain amount is brought to the\nsurface?\nEtta : Yes, and used by us until it is exhausted. One would then have\nto wait until a quantity welled to the surface again. . . . This psychic\npower is in the etheric part of the physical body, the ether separating the\natoms. All have it, but development implies patient work to bring it to\nthe surface.\n\u00bb 14th November, 1924.\n\" The power is drawn from and through the etheric body of the\nmedium.\"\n2oth February, 1925.\nCommunicators had often spoken of a psychic cord which united the\nsoul with the sleeping body on occasions when the former journeyed away\nto some distance. At this sitting I was informed that the etheric cord,\nwhich maintained the connection between soul and body, was the same in\nsub'stance as \" the power \".\n6th March, 1925.\nC. D. T. : Can you say how the medium's etheric body, her aura, and\nthe power are related ?\nJ. D. T. : There is a close relation, and development consists in regulat-\ning the relationship. The etheric body lies within the aura, the power\nlies in both. . . . When a medium begins to develop, the etheric body is\nable to detach itself and this enables the power to flow from it more\neasily.\nAt a sitting in March 1946 I asked for more information as I was\nengaged on this paper and wished to know whether my Communicators\ncould confirm or enlarge upon what had been said several years ago.\nIt was stated that they were not always sure whether or not their words\nhad been heard in the direct voice. In discussing the subject among\nthemselves they had agreed in thinking that the direct voice was\nfavoured when a speaker expressed himself quite naturally and without\nany effort to arrange his thoughts or to express them in a particular way,\nbut was specially interested in the immediate topic. In short, something\nspoken forcefully, but without mental effort.\nIt struck me that this would include exclamations, contradictions,\ncorrections, and supplying a word over which Feda had stumbled.\nMy father then joined in, saying that he had listened to our conversation\nand agreed that the direct voice was most likely with \" rather forceful\npeople who expressed themselves in a strong, vital, forceful manner and\nso gave out energy \". He thought that the apathetic and lethargic Com-\nmunicator would be at a disadvantage with it.\nI then asked my father if he could tell me in what way the Communi-\ncator's body differed from the etheric body of a sitter.\nHe replied, \" I think there is a little difference ; for while you are in a\nphysical body some of the density or substance of your etheric body is\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 131\nbeing absorbed by the physical body. Therefore the Communicator's\nbody is the stronger, for there is nothing drawing on it, or \" feeding\n\"\nupon it.\nHe was certain that, during earthly life, the physical drew upon the\netheric body in some way which he could not explain ; also that there\nwas a reverse process, since the etheric body in some way drew sustenance\nfrom the physical body.\nIn short, while essentially alike, the Communicator's body was stronger\nand more vital, while the etheric body of the sitter was in some degree\ndependent on its physical body.\nNext I asked if the Communicator's body was identical in its substance\nwith the power emanating from the medium. He replied that it was, but\nwith the difference that the power was a part of the medium's etheric\nbody which all the time was depending on and drawing from the physical\nbody of the medium. This fact would explain why the physical organism\nof the medium determined in some degree the quality of the mediumship.\n\" When we say that the power is going, it may be that the etheric can\nno longer draw what it needs from the physical. The power is a difficult\nthing to define and we are trying from our side to understand it better.\nWe realize that both the bodily condition of the medium and her state of\nmind have an effect on what we try to do in the sitting.\"\nC. D. T. : Would it be correct to say that when you stand here in the\ncircle of power your body is clearly defined and isolated, but surrounded\nby something etherically much the same as your body?\nJ. D. T. : Yes, yes, yes.\nAnd I would add that this power comes from the medium now and\nagain ; one moment it seems rather stronger and at another more with-\ndrawn. I do not know whether it is subject to the mental effort of Feda\nor the medium, but we are sometimes aware, whether from your remarks\nor perhaps from our own feelings also, that we have contacted this power\ndirectly, so making what you term the direct voice. In that case our\ncommunications, which have been inaudible to you, are clothed and made\naudible by contact with this power. It is as if something billows out\noccasionally. You might liken it to this ;\nyou may be humming a fragment\nof song and suddenly you burst forth and give out a volume of sound\nwhich would move the air at a greater distance from you. It is something\nthat now and again is available at a greater distance from the medium.\nThe same power, you understand, but available at a greater distance.\nThat is what we think and I expect that, as we continue investigating, we\nshall be confirmed in that belief. We are not always sure what you have\nheard and what you have not heard.\nWe come here, of course, with the desire to speak to you and we wish\nyou to know all we say. Hence our desire-thought and its effect on the\npower, attracts it to us all the time. I think there is something automatic\nabout the process. Our desires and wishes are potent ; we attract the\npower by our natural desire to speak to you.\nThe subject was briefly touched on in S.P.R. Proc. for July 1928,\nsection The Power or Mediumistic Emanation, pp. 72-78 ; in reading\nwhich there is an error to be noted on p. 73, line 25, which should have\nrun, \" although not usually visible to Control or Communicator\u2014\".\n\f132 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nSuggestions from the Piper Records. A Promising\nLine of Research\nIt is convenient in this paper to use the term \" Power \" since it is so\nnamed in Feda's quoted remarks, but I should prefer to call it a psychic\nemanation. A study of Mrs Sidgwick's article on the Piper sittings shows\nthat the same thing is there termed \" light \". If readers study that article\nin S.P.R. Proceedings for December 1915, pp. 59 to 65 and Appendix\npp. 341 to 395, they will find numerous references which agree in substance\nwith what has been quoted above from Mrs Leonard's sittings.\nIt would seem that this, at present mysterious, substance calls for\nfurther research. It is tempting to suggest that it will eventually be found\nto play an important part in the processes of physical life, in the baffling\nregions of sensation and perception, and in all forms of psychic phenomena.\nIt may be a substance which links the material with the immaterial and\nfacilitates their interaction. One may even conceive of it as consisting of\nmany grades, some of which interact with matter while others more easily\ninteract with the substance of the realms awaiting our habitation after\ndeparture from the earthly body.\nShould these guesses be but partially correct we have in this psychic\nemanation a worthy object for determined and persistent investigation.\nMany less promising objects have richly rewarded the investigator, and it\nmight well be that here is the key for which Psychology, Philosophy,\nBiology and Psychical Research have long sought vainly.\nEvidence that Feda hears Actual Words spoken\nBY Communicators\nIn my earlier sittings I supposed that Feda received the thoughts of the\nCommunicator telepathically. It has been necessary to modify this sup-\nposition. There is much to convince me that the best parts of a good\nsitting are independent of telepathy, as Feda is listening to messages given\nin spoken words which are audible to her.\nWhat is the evidence for this?\n1. Feda's actions : She always looks directly in front of the medium\ntowards the place where she says the Communicator is. Her attitude is\nthat of one listening intently ; often she bends forward as if to catch the\nwords more distinctly, as when I ask a question and the medium bends\nforward in a listening attitude, Feda saying, \" I'll ask him what he thinks\nabout it.\"\n2. Feda's remarks : She often asks for a word or sentence to be repeated,\nor expressed in a different way. She complains of long or difficult words.\nAt times she seems not to understand what is being said although the\nmeaning is quite clear to me. When unable to catch the correct sound of\na proper name she will often give its first part according to its sound,\nalthough not according to its spelHng ; as C for Sidney, \" Buttons \" for\na name which should have been \" Butters \", and \" Ash \" for \" Nash \".\n3. My observations : Long passages are given a few words at a time,\nexactly as if they were being repeated by one listening to a dictated\nmessage ; in fact, I have long ago named this type of reception \" the\n\f173] ^ New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 133\ndictation method \". In the best sittings this dictation method is used for\nall the most important parts of a discourse.\nFeda frequently complains that she cannot hear and asks that it may be\nrepeated :\n\" What? What did you say? I've missed a word ;\nperhaps\nhe will say it again.\"\nShe puzzles over the pronunciation of an unfamiliar name, exactly as\none often does over the telephone.\nVery impressive are the little dialogues between Feda and the Com-\nmunicator. Feda will, at times, flatly contradict the Communicator and\nat other times the Communicator contradicts Feda\n!\nOccasionally a Communicator uses a word which seems new to Feda ;\nshe will assert that there is no such word, and when I explain its meaning\nshe will presently use it herself, often incorrectly!\nA Communicator may correct Feda's pronunciation, as when objection\nwas taken to Feda's way of saying interei\/ing :\n\" Don't say that. Say\ninteresting \"!\nFrequently when Feda has mis-heard a word it is corrected by the\nCommunicator.\nOf one Communicator Feda remarked, \" He is wonderfully persistent.\nHe keeps on about a thing until it is cleared up, when others might have\ndropped it. But he will not leave it, or let it go ; he keeps on till he makes\nme say what he means. He is clever at it and that makes a great deal of\ndifference to me. Some are much less helpful.\" That final remark bears\nout what I have repeatedly noticed in proxy cases\u2014that is to say, cases\nin which messages are given me by unknown persons to be passed on to\ntheir relatives. Some were capable, others were not, and some would not\ntake the trouble to stop for clearing up a sentence which Feda failed to\ntransmit at first attempt.\nA rather dignified speaker had alluded to his sister coming next year\nfor her spring sitting. Feda gave this as \" her spring chicken \". At this\nthe speaker expressed displeasure saying, \" Not spring chicken! I do not\nwant you to mix up my words. I said '\nspring sitting '. I had no idea\nof saying '\nchicken '.\"\nThe interplay between Feda and a Communicator is quite lifelike.\nIn the midst of one description the speaker interrupted and said, \" Get it\ncorrectly ;\nyou are making it out other than I mean.\" He then repeated-\nhis description in a way which corrected in an important particular what\nFeda had at first said.\n4. Here are some examples of passages in my notes which strongly\nsuggest Feda's actual hearing of words, and which do not so readily lend\nthemselves to the telepathic explanation.\nWords misheard by Feda :\nFeda : Week after week for fears\u2014(long pause as if the misheard\nword caused a check in the flow and a faltering). Years. Week after\nweek for years.\nFeda : I see greatly\u2014What did you call it? Something\u2014I've missed\nsomething. I'm sorry. Well, he says, I see great differences.\nFeda : We cannot as\u2014as\u2014 We cannot, What? Oh, I can't get that\nword. Well, say it another way, Feda, he says.\n\f134 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nOn another occasion Feda said \" feel \", afterwards correcting it to\n\" field \", which was the required word. An evident case of mishearing :\nas also when she said, \" What did you say? Mind?\u2014Remind \" ; the\nlatter being the word desired by the Communicator.\nDuring a talk by one well known to me in his earthly life, Feda caused\nthe medium to imitate his characteristic movements and ways of speaking.\nThis may have been a careful, or an unconscious, imitation, but it was\nimpressive.\n5. References to laughter.\nFeda : He says that this will solve many problems ... Is he\nmaking fun? He's laughing a little . . . problems of imports and\nexports.\nFeda : There will always be people who will prefer\u2014He's laughing\nagain, though he seems serious\u2014to travel by usual means of transit,\nrather than by\u2014etc.\nC. D. T. made a humorous remark to Communicator.\nFeda : Oh, he is laughing!\nFeda : In the midst of being serious he could think of something funny\nand laugh about it ; not being funny all the time. He could be quite\nserious and suddenly\u2014Ha, ha, ha, ha! like that. I notice he does it now\nand again. (This was very characteristic of the Communicator, whom I\nhad known intimately all my life.)\nIntonation imitated, says Feda.\nFeda : I have now got into a good habit of imitating the way their voices\ngo up and down, up and down.\nC. D. T. : That is most valuable.\nFeda : When they go up and down, up and down, I imitate them because\nit might have a meaning.\nC. D. T. : It has. It helps out the meaning very much.\nFeda : But I can't do it unless I hear the voices. Sometimes they show\nme things and sometimes they give it in thought, and then I don't hear.\n(This is a clear statement of the three forms of transmission. It is in\nagreement with what I have noticed in my sittings.)\n6. Direct Voice incidents pointing to actual hearing by Feda.\nFeda : Abstinence?\nD. V. : Abstinence.\nFeda: I'm getting that word abstinence. I don't know what that means,\nbut it means something or other special to him.\n(What Communicator wished to say was evidently this :\n\" It's like\nbeing put in charge of a Borstal institution \") :\nFeda : It's like being put in charge of a department of boars. Pigs?\nBoars in an institution?\nD. V. : Borstal.\nFeda : I'm not quite sure. It's something to do with boars.\nFeda : There was something neglected which should have been seen to.\n\" Bolt,\" he says. Now he says to Feda, \" Go on, give it to him.\" He says,\n\" Fastner, bolt.\" (This latter remark was given like an impulsive correc-\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 135\ntion and urging. It was exactly in the Communicator's manner as dis-\ntinctly remembered by me.)\nFeda : Willy\u2014What.? Who's he.? Willy somebody\u2014I can't get his\nother name. Willy\u2014somebody is compelling you. Wait a minute.\nI've mixed that up.\nD. V. : It is not that at all.\n'\u2022\nFeda : Willy-nilly? Is that right.' Willy-nilly you are being com-\npelled, etc., etc.\nFeda ; Stuart thinks he will have more important work later, though\nhe doesn't know quite what it is.\nD. V. : At present\u2014\nFeda : Present.' He doesn't know at present. What is it, then?\n\" No,\" he said. I don't know what it is quite. \" Full stop.\" Full stop?\nBut at present I am helping with, etc., etc.\n(How clearly this indicates speaker and listener. The latter had joined\nthe first two words of a new sentence to the end of the previous. She is\nthen pulled up by the speaker, who finally indicates his meaning by saying\n\" Full stop \" and proceeds to place the misused two words at the beginning\nof a fresh sentence.)\nThe following quotations are from my article entitled, \" The Modus\nOperandi of Trance-Communication according to descriptions received\nthrough Mrs Osborne Leonard.\" S.P.R. Proceedings, July 1928.\np. 51. At the commencement of Mrs Leonard's trance it seems as if her\nindividuality changes into that of another person, namely that of Feda the\nControl. Feda talks to me about my communicators who are said to be\nsomewhere in front of the medium. Feda (as I must now term the\nmedium) then begins to tell me what they say, and from time to time\nbends forward in the attitude of attentive listening. She often seems\npuzzled as to the communicator's meaning, and will question the invisible\npresence before completing the sentence.\np. 52. It is a noteworthy fact that for a period, rarely more than twenty\nminutes in any one sitting, Feda will speak as if she were receiving from\ndictation. I can often at these times catch a softly whispered sentence\nbefore hearing it repeated in the clear Feda voice. This dictation method\nalways reaches a high degree of accuracy, and I realize that I am receiving,\nnot merely the communicator's thoughts, but also the characteristic\ndiction.\np. 59.\n\" So many little identifications can be made when Feda can\nhear the tone of voice, with facial expressions, lip movement, etc. So at\nfirst we all try to speak in our accustomed way, so that little points of\nidentification may be given. If Feda only got things impressionally she\nmight miss many little points which help to convince you.\"\np. 61. \" Your father says there are times when Feda cannot see him,\nbut only hears him. He wants to point out that when Feda cannot see him\nbut only hears him, she must have some way of locating him. Is it not,\nhe asks, by a light or misty substance? Quite right, when Feda cannot see\nhim Feda can see something like a light near the sitter or going away.\nFeda has had two or three sittings with a person before seeing the com-\nmunicator, although getting the messages by feeling or hearing.\"\n\f136 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\np. 62. Feda : What? . . . Wait . . . Cannot hear you ... It is a\nnuisance. I was hearing him very well just then, but there is a vib-\nration of voices coming now which mixes it all up. Can you shut\nthe window?\nThis break came in the midst of an interesting passage which flowed\nwith ease and accuracy. I then noticed, for the first time, a sound of\nvoices in conversation outside the room where we were sitting. Two\npersons were talking on the lawn outside. I asked them to speak more\nsoftly and closing the window returned to my place. Feda then said :\nIt does not matter while your father talks mentally, but when he speaks\nin voice it does matter. Although you cannot hear his voice, it sounds\nlike a real voice to Feda while in the medium.\n(How clearly this distinguishes between the two methods of giving the\nmessages!) I\np. 69. \" Feda can hear part, and part not, is able to hear some of it\ntoday, but not all of it. . . . When he gives words and follows them up\nwith an impression, then Feda knows it is right.\"\nFeda : Do you know there are times when I really hear him, and yet\nonly get muddled sounds, not properly formed sounds. He says it again\nand if it does not get clearer he has to show it or get it through in some\nother way.\nFrom the above remarks one gathers that \" the power \" was often I\ninsufficient in quantity, or possibly unsuitable in quality, for the con-\nveyance to Feda of spoken words. Much more was it inadequate for\nproduction of the direct voice whisper. At the date of these sittings there\nhad been comparatively little direct voice.\nThe full significance of this speaking in actual words will be discussed\nlater after the direct-voice usages have been classified and illustrated.\nHaving alluded to my observing the medium's actions during a sitting\nit may be well to explain that there is plenty of light for this.\nwhereas in a direct voice \" trumpet \" sitting the darkness is complete\nand every precaution taken to exclude rays of light, it is far otherwise with\nMrs Leonard's sittings. It is true that she prefers to have the curtain\ndrawn, as this makes it easier to enter the trance state ; but she is not\nfastidious about excluding such light as may come from the side of the\ncurtain. Then, too, there is light from the lamp, which is merely covered\nby a red silk handkerchief. In winter, also, the electric stove gives some\nillumination. Within a few minutes of the commencement of a sitting\none's eyes, growing accustomed to the reduced light, can see around the\nroom, can watch the expression of the medium's face and every movement\nof her body.\nThe Direct Voice Whispers classified and illustrated\nFrom the hundreds of instances in which the Direct Voice (or whisper)\nappears in records of recent years, I have selected many examples and 1\n;\nclassified them under appropriate headings, as follows :\nThe Direct Voice supplies the required word : :\n\"> -\n'\n1.

V. sometimes commences a neiv topic, or gives assent, saying \" Yes \".\n6. D. V. sometimes expresses emphasis.\nIn illustration of this I quote from a record made by my friend, the\nRev. A. F. Webling, at his sitting of 26th August, 1942. His son is\ngiving what proved to be an accurate forecast of our victory at El Alamein,\nwhich came to pass two months afterwards.\nFeda : Father, I've got a date in my mind. As I told you, I don't\nalways know things about the future, especially about things' affecting us\npersonally. But in my mind recently a date keeps coming up. I ought to\nsay, two dates next to each other, something about 28th and 29th October,\nsomething to do with the war, and I feel a turning-point of a very, very\nvital kind. Very outstanding. I seldom get anything like that. It is as\nif a little door opens and something pops out, almost as if it were thrown\nout, saying, \" Take that.\" And this date comes, and my own mind has to\ninterpret. And I interpret it as having a grave bearing on the war, which\nwill prove to our advantage.\nD. V. : Father, I felt relief ! ,\nFeda : I would like you to underline that.\n7. The D. V. addresses Feda.\nFeda : A new Communicator was characterised by Feda, who spoke\nappreciatively of his sincerity and quickness in adapting himself to the\nconditions of his new life, adding, \" He was ready to do it.\"\nD. V. : Thank you.\nFeda : Thank you, he said.\nC. D. T. : For your flattering remarks!\nFeda : He says, I don't know that they were meant to be flattering, but I\nthink I may read a certain amount of truth in them.\n(Later in the same sitting Feda broke into the Communicator's discourse\nby citing another Communicator's way of expressing happiness), \" He\nwould do a little hornpipe dance.\"\nD. V. : \/ don't know what you mean !\nFeda : No, I didn't say you were doing hornpipes, but that person did.\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 139\n\" Oh, did he do hornpipes? \" he said. Well, yes, of course he did. Any-\nbody in their senses does.\nD. V. : I don't!\nFeda : You don't. Oh, he doesn't!\nFeda had expressed in her own words what she considered the Com-\nmunicator was intending by what he had transmitted to her in picture\nform.\nD. V. : Yes, put it that way.\nFeda : Yes, I have done. He says, \" Put it that way,\" as if I just\nhappened to get it as he would want to give it.\n8. D. V. corrects Fedas mistakes. These instances are possibly of\nspecial significance as one may suppose that Feda would not thus correct\nherself.\nFeda : At present it is clearer\n\u2014\nD. V. : As clear\nFeda : It is as clear\u2014\nFeda : Was there a path would go to some water? Would there be a\npath to some water, do you know? She keeps saying, \" path-water ;\npath-water.\" I don't see any water in the garden, but I get a feeling you\ncould go out of the garden and there would be some special path to the\ngarden\n\u2014\nD. V. : To the water\nFeda : No, not to the garden, she says, but from the garden to the\nwater ; as if it would be looked upon as a private path. (This was a highly\nimportant correction and saved an excellent piece of evidence, unknown\nto me at the time, from being a failure. It correctly described something\nno longer existing, but which I was able to verify from pictures in\narchaeological books more than a century old.)\nFeda : It is a break away of what you might call a grossly physical life\u2014\nD. V. : From\nFeda : From a grossly physical life.\nFeda : You couldn't pretend to be something other than you were not.\nD. V. : Other than you were\nFeda : Than you were, he says.\nFeda : Tell her that he is happy, that he can see nothing in ^is Hfe\nthat he would wish altered.\nD. V. : New life\nFeda : In the new life that he would wish altered.\nFeda : I am told I make\u2014\nD. V. : May make\nFeda : I may-make little or no impression, but we shall see.\nFeda : Is there someone, Jane?\nD. V. : Jennie\nFeda: Jennie, yes, that's right. He said it just as he was going. (The\nspeaker was my brother-in-law, who had always alluded to his sister as\nJennie. A fact which he would certainly remember.)\n\f14\u00b0 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nFeda : He talked to others about it, not just Mr John, but others, what\nhe calls his temptibles.\nD. V. : Contemporaries\nFeda : temporaries\u2014contemporaries, those of my own age and outlook.\n(In this case, as in some others, I am not sure that the mistaken pro-\nnunciation was not intentional, an instance of Feda's facetiousness or\nhumour.)\n9.

He said\nsomething else too, something also just before it. Never mind, I've lost it.\nI'm getting words now, so I lose them better.\nD. V. : Worse\nFeda : Oh! He says worse, not better.\n11. D. V. contradicts Feda.\nFeda : This gentleman is not quite used to fitting in with other people,\nand with what they wish him to do. If you suggest anything to him he\ndoesn't jump at it. He waits to see if it was what he wants to do. He's\njust like that.\nD. V. : \/ am not!\nFeda : Yes, you are. He's a good, kind man, but it's just a habit. I\nfeel he was an important person, that people thought a lot of and paid much\nattention to his words. He says they didn't always pay attention, but it\nwould have been better if they had done so sometimes. . . . He is a funny\ngentleman!\nD. V. : Not funny .\n'\n:\nFeda : Yes, you are.\nFeda : This man's idiosyncrasy had become a fixed habit, his self-\nindulgence in a habit\u2014 You mean habit of thought?\nD.

Drayton Thomas [Part\nThe name of Sir Oliver Lodge having been introduced, Feda remarked,\n\" You know he's the cleverest person ever lived \"\n\u2014\nD. V. : Not quite!\nFeda : Well, he nearly is anyhow. Mr John says, \" Not quite \", like\nthat, but Feda thinks he is.\n(It appears that Feda was acquainted with the fact that Miriam, the\nstenographer, was keeping rabbits.)\nFeda : Sometimes dull tasks are the breeding-ground of better things.\nBreeding? Yes, that's right\u2014of better things\u2014like Miriam's rabbits?\nD. V. : Rabbits? What's rabbits?\nFeda : Always breeding. Never mind. I was only telling him some-\nthing.\nFeda : I don't know what terms to use to convey to you the absorbing\ninterest of this life. Everything that one tackles and overcomes opens out\na vista of something else, even more interesting, that may be done. No\nstalemate here, he says. (Feda seemed struck by the word \" stalemate \",\nrepeating the word \" mate \" ; she then suggested it might mean an\nundesirable wife, and informed me she knew a gentleman who had one.)\nTo this the Communicator replied\n\u2014\nD. V. : \/ didn't mean that!\nFeda : You didn't mean that? Well, never mind. He wants to say,\nNo deadlock, but always something open, something open again through\nthat, and something opening again.\nFeda : She remembers about him, you see, and like when it's\u2014when a\nboy's been naughty and you wonder if he will be naughty again, do you\nsee?\nC.

V. : Latitude.\nFeda : Latitude to other people.\nWhisperings which are only partly heard by the Sitter :\nTheir Special Significance\nI have reserved until last a special class of D. V. whisper which seems\nof great significance. It is important evidence for the correctness of the\nhypothesis put forward in this paper.\nLet the reader recall some evening in the country when, in windy\nweather, he listened to the sound of distant bells. A gust of wind brings\nthe sound strongly for a moment ;\nthen, as the wind falls, the sound dies\naway into silence, although the bells are ringing steadily all the time.\n\" The sound upon the fitful gale\nIn solemn-wise did rise and fail ;\n.\nLike that wild harp whose magic tone ';\nIs wakened by the wind alone.\" (Scott.)\nIn like manner the sitter hears part only of some D. V. sentences,\npart only of some words ; the speaker is giving the whole, but a lull in\nthe emanation prevents the whole being voiced in air and so carried to the\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 145\nsitter's ear. Thus \" the fitful gale \" would seem an apt simile for the ebb\nand flow of psychic emanation which permits part of a word, or sentence,\nto be heard, yet fails to carry the remainder.\nHere are examples of D. V. which are incomplete, the beginning or the\nending having been inaudible to the sitter and to the stenographer.\nSingle words.\nFor the^word \" dogmatize \" D.

Drayton Thomas [Part\nThe Special Significance of these Partly-Voiced\nWords and Phrases\nIt would seem from the above examples that the Communicator speaks\nin the ordinary way while giving his messages and discourse to Feda.\nBut though he speaks in the ordinary way, as we do, his body is far\nother than ours ; it is not composed of matter, but of something which\nvve may term a physical substance, without venturing to affirm more\nabout it.\nBeing non-material, it cannot affect material things, not even the air.\nHence the Communicator's speaking, however audible to Feda, is usually\nquite inaudible to the sitter.\nWhat his speaking does is to cause vibrations in the field of psychic\nemanation, and it is these vibrations which bring to Feda the auditory\nimpression ; for her bodily form is of like substance with that of the\nCommunicator, and therefore sensitive to the vibrations of the emanation.\nBut what cannot be done directly can be accomplished indirectly.\nThe emanation, being a sort of go-between, linking the material world\nwith the realm beyond reach of our five senses, can, when acting with\nsufficient force, cause vibrations in air. These secondary vibrations are\nheard as whispered words.\nWere the emanation of suitable density, and moved with sufficient\nvigour by the speaker's vocal organs, we should hear his words as distinctly\nas if he were a mortal speaking in the room. And that is exactly what one\ndoes hear in the so-called Trumpet sittings : those sittings in the dark for\nthe Direct Voice with physical voice mediums. I have studied that\nphenomenon with eleven different mediums, attending, in all, twenty-\nseven Direct Voice sittings. From this number I would wish to subtract\nabout half, because they were unsatisfactory in that no good evidence was\nforthcoming, and in two of them I strongly suspected that the mediums\nwere themselves whispering through the trumpet.\nIn the six best cases there were splendid manifestations of voice. I\ndoubt if any adequate impression of it can be conveyed in description to\nthose who have had no experience of it. One hears from the Control a\nclear, ringing voice in the darkness, speaking from the further end of the\nroom ; then a loud whisper close in front which brings to your memory\nsome event of long ago in which the speaker took part. Then the voice\nof the Control again breaks in and makes some announcement about the\nconditions of the circle before introducing another speaker. The whisper-\ning voice of a Communicator usually comes from close in front of the\nperson addressed ; while the Control speaks from anywhere in the room,\nhigh up or low down, inside the circle of sitters or outside it, but never, I\nthink, quite close to the medium.\nNor are all the voices alike ;\nthey vary as would voices in any social\ngathering ;\nmen's and women's, young and aged. Sometimes one will\nsing with full and cultured voice, male singing with a woman medium, or\nthe whistling of tunes in masterly style. Foreign languages are spoken by\nsome Communicators while in dialogue with a sitter who can speak in the\nsame tongue. On the first occasion of hearing this I questioned the lady\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 149\nsitter afterwards, asking if the talk had \"been evidential. She replied that\nthe speaker was a Scandinavian whom she had known in her youth.\nAnother told me that the unseen friend had talked in dialect pronunciation\nwhich no Englishman could imitate without detection. This was said by\nan Indian Prince ; and a similar personal testimony was given about a\ndialogue in Scotch.\nIn general, the medium's Control, or Controls, speak the loudest and\nwith fullest voice, while the Communicators vary from hoarse whispers,\nnot too distinct in small circles or with an indifferently gifted medium, to\nclear, full voice with the best mediums.\nThis is a most inadequate description of what I have myself heard, but\nit may suffice to indicate that there is good ground for asserting that the\nDirect Voice does not proceed from the lips of the medium and is not to be\nmistaken for ventriloquism.\nIf, then. Direct Voice in dark seances is produced at distance from the\nmedium, there is nothing surprising in finding the same thing taking\nplace in Mrs Leonard's sittings. The conviction that it there emanates\nfrom some distance in front of her is thus supported.\nThe Foregoing Observations supported by Other Sitters\nThe evidence which has been adduced in support of my hypothesis\nwould be strengthened if it were reproduced with a number of other\nsitters. Others have indeed given me their impressions, impressions\nwhich, so far as they go, entirely agree with my own findings. But we\nrequire stenographic records which show clearly what was spoken by the\ndirect whisper and what preceded and followed it. This is, I fear, a\ndemand which cannot be met by many.\nHappily, there are two which have been brought to my notice. The\nfirst is from the late Robert Blatchford's book, More Things in Heaven and\nEarth, and the second is a paper written by Mrs Conan Shaw for my\ninspection when she heard that I was interested in the Direct Voice.\nMr and Mrs Shaw have had some sittings with Mrs Leonard in recent\nyears and were struck by this particular manifestation the more strongly\nas they were having home sittings in the hope of developing Direct Voice.\nRobert Blatchford\nRobert Blatchford in his book. More Things in Heaven and Earth, writes\nof a sitting with Mrs Leonard on 23rd September, 1923, as follows :\n\"Away from the medium and away from me, my wife spoke directly to\nme. She said, in an eager, anxious tone, '\nBob, I'm here. I am with you,\nBob.' Before I could recover my presence of mind Feda began to speak\nagain and I lost the chance to reply. But it was my wife's voice I heard\nand she pronounced the word Bob as she always did when with us. I\nthink it is suggestive that she spoke my name twice. I had always said\nthat if I heard a medium utter my name in that way I should think the\nevidence important.\n\" When I related that incident in The Sunday Chronicle several readers\nsuggested that I had imagined I heard the voice. . . . But my wife had\n\f150 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nbeen dead nearly two years, and I had never imagined I heard her speak\nuntil I sat with Mrs Leonard (pp. 92-3).\n\" It was on the 23rd of September, 1923, when my wife spoke to me.\nOn the I St of June, 1924, at my second sitting, I asked Feda if my wife\nreally had spoken to me, or if I had imagined it. Feda said. She spoke to\nyou.- It is a thing that does not happen in hundreds of sittings with me.\nThere was a lot of power, (p. 26.)\n\" On the 19th of November, 1923, at a sitting of the Johannesburg\ncircle, a message, purporting to come from my wife, was written automati-\ncally by Mrs Purchas. I quote the message in full as reported by Mr\nPurchas, and with it his note appended.\n'\nWill you tell Barb that I am now very happy, as he is of my faith?\nStrange that it should have taken your South African Circle to tell my\ndear husband that I am alive. We are most grateful. No, I will not sign\nyet\u2014can't have everything at once.'\n'\nNote.\u2014I have underlined the word above because it was written-\nexactly as transcribed here. Whether or not that was done to convey an\ninflexion known to you, but unknown to us, I cannot, of course, say.'\n\" My wife always pronounced my name as spelt in the above message.\nBut it was quite impossible for anyone in the circle to know that. How\nthen did the word Bob come to be written Barb.''\n\" At the sitting with Mrs Leonard on the 23rd of September, 1923,\nwhen my wife spoke directly to me, she pronounced my name Barb, and\nshe used the name twice, as if on purpose to convince me of her identity.\n'\nBarb, I'm here. I am with you. Barb.'\n\" Now one would suppose that Feda heard my wife speak to me. Yet,\non the ist of June, 1924, Feda repeatedly addressed me as '\nMr Bob '.\nShe had not picked up the inflexion. How then did the inflexion get into\nan automatic message given at a distance of 7,000 miles to a group of\nsitters not one of whom had ever heard my wife speak? \"\n(pp. 102-3.)\nVariation in the Direct Voice Phenomena\nDuring Robert Blatchford's sitting of 12th June, 1924 he asked Feda\nif his wife had really spoken to him. She said, \" It is a thing that does not\nhappen in hundreds of sittings with me.\" So it would seem that at this\ndate the D. V. was at its early beginning in Mrs Leonard's sittings. It was\nthen rare and did not much attract my attention ;\nmy notes merely record\nthat I could often hear my father's whispers, which Feda repeated aloud.\nIt is within the last dozen years that the amount of D. V. has so markedly\nincreased. Its frequency varies from sitting to sitting. In one it may be\nheard only six times, speaking a total of from twelve to fifteen words in\nall ; at another sitting it may be heard as many as twenty-five times,\nspeaking about sixty words. Calculation based on some thirty of the\nmore recent occasions gives an average of eighteen times and twenty-six\nwords.\nI think this difl^erence from sitting to sitting depends on the amount and\nquality of emanation given out by medium and sitter ; their physical\nand mental conditions vary according to circumstances. For instance, I\nam writing this on my return from a sitting which gave only nineteen\n\fI\n173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 151\nD. V. words, and several of these were whispered too faintly to be under-\nstood. This is most unusual, as one generally hears the whisper quite\ndistinctly, with no doubt whatever as to the word or words. What was\nthe reason for so poor a manifestation? I incline to attribute it to two\ncauses ;\nmy own weariness and the heaviness of the atmosphere. My\nfeelings on going to this sitting were of languor and sleepiness, increased\nno doubt by attendance during the night on a restless invalid. The day\nhad been damp, mild and enervating, and during the sitting Feda asked\nme to reduce the heat of the electric stove, as the Communicator was\ncomplaining of heaviness in the atmosphere of the room\u2014a most rare\nrequest! Hence I doubt if either Mrs Leonard or I could give out our\nusual psychic contribution.\nIn the majority of sittings the D. V. comes in patches. It will occur\ntwo, three or even four times on one page of my records, and not again for\nseveral following pages. At other times it appears on several successive\npages, after which many blank pages follow before it occurs again.\nWhat is the significance of this tendency of the D. V. to come in patches?\nI think it points to an unequal pouring forth of the emanation ; when this\ncomes freely there is more likelihood of the D. V. being produced. When\nit comes less freely the D. V. is difficult or even impossible.\nBesides this, there is evidence that something in the early part of the\nsitting facilitates the D. V., and that towards the latter part this something\nfails to act. This would agree with a slowing down of the output of\nemanation as the sitting passes the half-way point. It is as if power were\nvigorously produced shortly after the sitting starts, and reaches one or\nmore peaks, after which it fails, may be suddenly or gradually.\nThe figures given on an adjoining page (see sketch-plan showing wave\npeaks) bear out the statement of Communicators that the power varies in\nstrength from moment to moment and is all the time being used up, so\nthat towards the close of a sitting difficulties arise. They say that they\ncan give more easily when the power is strong and often fail in doing what\nthey attempt because the power has weakened.\nThe final minutes of most sittings are used by my Communicators for\ntaking personal control of the medium, and they usually remark towards\nthe end of their speaking that the power is failing and they must therefore\nstop. If I detain them longer by questions, an increasing slowness and\nfaintness of speech becomes marked, and they seem to be struggling\nagainst difficulties of expression as well as of recollection. They may even\nrefuse to continue, explaining that they might inadvertently say something\nsilly, or quite other than intended.\nWe may therefore conclude that this mysterious power flows with\nintermittent or irregular force, that it gradually diminishes as the sitting\nproceeds, and that its exhaustion inevitably brings the sitting to an\nend.\nIt seemed desirable to ascertain by counting whether the instances of\nD. V. were evenly distributed throughout a sitting, or whether they tended\nto come more frequently at some one or more parts.\nMy sitting records are uniformly typed on pages of the same size, and\nthat part in which Feda controls has an average of twenty-four pages.\nCounting the number of times the D. V. was heard, and also the total\n\fC. Drayton Thomas [Part\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 153\nnumber of words so spoken, I find that the first twelve pages of 50 records\nshow 452 instances of D. V. which produced 951 words ; whereas in the\nfinal twelve pages the figures were 156 times and 292 words.\nThis reveals the existence of some cause which favours thrice as much\nD. V. in the first half of a sitting as in its latter half.\nTo discover more minutely where the incidence fell, I divided the\ntwenty-four pages into four sets. The result was :\nIn pp. 1-6 the D. V. came 292 times, speaking 593 words.\n7-12 ,, ,, ,, 160 ,, \u201e 358\n13-18 ,, 106 ,, ,, 199\n19-24 \" \" \" 50 \u00bb \" 93\nThis shows that something favouring production of the D. V. rapidly\ndiminishes as the sitting proceeds towards its close.\nWishing to discover whether some Communicators had shown more\nability than others to produce words in the D. V., I examined a large\nnumber of the more recent records. Naturally those who spoke more\nfrequently and lengthily had most impressed me ;\nthey had undoubtedly\nproduced more D. V. than had the less frequent and less lengthy speakers ;\nbut would their average of D. V. words per page be less or more? I could\nnot guess.\nHaving obtained the average of D. V. words per page for seven chief\nCommunicators I found them arranged in the following order :\nE.C. T.N.K. Stuart Father Etta McD. Mother\n2-8 1-8 1-5 1-5 1-3 i-i i-o\nBut this result was inconclusive, since those who spoke most would\nmore frequently have spoken during periods when the power was un-\nfavourable. It seemed necessary to make another calculation, counting\nonly those pages on which D.V. words were recorded, and omitting\nall those during which the power was presumably insufficient to produce\nD. V. Here is the result :\nStuart T.N.K. E.C. Father Mother McD Etta\n27 2-3 2-2 1-9 1-8 1-6 1-2\nIt will be noticed that, by both methods, the same three Communicators\ncome first, while another three come last. This seems to indicate a\ndifference in ability to produce D. V.\nIs there any significance in the fact that E. C, T. N. K. and Stuart\nshow greater facility in producing D. V. than do others.'' This much is\ncertain ; E. C. is the one who always speaks under the greatest emotional\nstress. Stuart was a practised lecturer and, when deeply interested, very\nemphatic, whether on the platform or in ordinary conversation. Why my\ncousin, T. N. K., should score so well is difficult to say. He was an easy\ntalker ; but so were my mother and Etta! He was a medical specialist\nand therefore accustomed to give his opinion with authority, as also when\non the Bench as a London J. P. But I incline to think that his marked\nsuccess in producing the D. V. is more closely related to the subject\nmatter of his communications. This he evidently considered to be of\ngrave importance, and he may therefore have deemed that it merited more\n\f154 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nemphatic announcement than commonplace matter would have done. Be\nthis as it may, the figures show that the D. V. does not come by chance ;\nthe moods and mental characteristics of the speaker are decisive factors!\nThese Direct Voice Whispers do not proceed from\nTHE Medium's Lips\nI am aware that a critic's first reaction to this paper will be to suggest to\nhimself that I, and other of Mrs Leonard's sitters, have been misled in\nsupposing that the D. V. comes from some point in space away from the\nmedium ;\nthey will incline to think that, in fact, it came from her lips.\n1 hasten to assure him that there is no question possible in the mind of\nthose who have heard it often. The D. V. does not proceed from the\nmedium's lips, neither is it possible to confuse it with any whisper which\nFeda may make through those lips. I am always able, just before Feda\ngreets me, to hear her whispered mutterings in apparent conversation\nwith the Communicator. I can catch a word here and there, \" Yes, I'll\ntell him. Yes, Feda mustn't forget,\" but the grammar and characteristic\nis always distinctly and unmistakably Feda's own. Between this and the\nD. V. whisper of the Communicators there is wide difference.\nMoreover, the latter comes from a different place. Feda's whisper\nproceeds from Mrs Leonard's lips ; the D. V. comes from a spot some\n2 ft. to 3 ft. in front of the medium.\nImplications of D. V.\nHitherto it has always been possible for the critics to suggest that the\nevidence of identity offered by the Communicator was given telepathically,\n{a) coming from some mind or minds on earth which possessed the\ninformation, or {b) from a discarnate personality who was not necessarily\nin the seance room at the time, or (c) if in the room, not possessing any\nbodily form.\nI think it will be difficult to maintain either of these suppositions in view\nof the evidence above given for an actual presence of the Communicator,\nand the necessity for assuming that he has a bodily form by means of\nwhich he speaks to Feda and occasionally produces the D. V.\nThis conclusion brings with it a confirmation which supports the view\nusually arrived at by sitters who deem that they have been in actual\nconversation with departed friends. I know this conclusion seems too\nsimple to be true, and that therefore critics have exercised their imagination\nto devise alternative explanations. These alternatives have never seemed\nsatisfactory to me, and now, after my long experience with Mrs Leonard,\nand many other trance sensitives, they seem more than ever to be fancies\nbased on guesses, without foundation in observed fact or experimental\nresults.\nHow Direct Voice Whispers are produced\nThe Direct Voice Whispers are caused by vibrations in air ; these are\nsecondary results due to primary vibrations of the emanation set up by\nthe words which the Communicator speaks within it.\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 155\nLet me here repeat the hypothesis. Communicators can no more\nproduce a voice in air than they can move physical objects\u2014direct and\nwithout some intermediary. But there is an intermediary which is suffi-\nciently akin to the substance of the Beyond to be usable by discarnates,\nand sufficiently akin to our matter to affect it under certain conditions.\nThese conditions are in operation when a Communicator makes use of it\nto levitate, say, a table in the seance room, or to speak at a trumpet-voice\nseance. At the latter one hears the clear and ringing voice of the well-\npractised Control and the rather more laboured voices, or (in the poorer\nsittings) whispers, of the Communicators. In the Leonard sittings the\nCommunicators occasionally catch a denser wave of the emanation which\nproduces such vibration in air as results in vocal sound, much like a weak\ntrumpet sitting. I think the D. V. is also favoured by any special emphasis\nin a Communicator's speaking.\nThis secondary result is not difficult to understand. We know how the\nwind, which can make but little impression upon stone, can arouse such\nforce in waves of the sea that solid stone breakwaters are smashed. The\nsea waves are intermediate between air and stone. Similarly, in these\nsittings the impalpable emanation can be set into such violent action by\nthe Communicator's speech that it vibrates the air and so produces\nwords.\nPerhaps a better analogy is offered by electricity. The Induction Coil\nin its simplest form shows us how sound can be produced, by the action of\nan intermediary, from a current of electricity which, by itself, makes no\nsound. If wires connected with the poles of a torch battery are brought\ntogether and separated several times a succession of tiny sparks will be\nnoticed. These are either soundless, or only audible to very keen ears.\nBut if this slight current be passed through a coil of wire, which is sur-\nrounded by an insulated coil of very fine and very long wire, one gets an\naudible spark from the terminals of this secondary coil each time the\ncurrent starts or is broken in the primary coil. In the Induction Coil there\nis a contact make-and-break attachment which permits a very rapid\nsuccession of sparks which crackle in the air. In using this we have\n{a) the primary electric current of the inner coil which produces no clearly\naudible sound ; the make-and-break of this causes {b) an induced current\nin the outer coil, and the terminals of the latter, when brought close\ntogether, produce (c) a series of sparks which crackle loudly. Thus, by\nmeans of an intermediary, the soundless current {a), making use of the\ninduced current {b), causes sounds in air (c).\nThis may serve to illustrate my idea of the way in which the soundless\nwords of the Communicator, stir at times the intermediate circle of psychic\nemanation from the medium, which in its turn produces sufficient\nvibration in air to be heard as the direct voice whispers.\nAnother analogy is provided by electric traction. The make-and-break\nof electric current flowing round a magnet causes machinery to work by a\nsuccession of pulls. That electric current, by itself, is powerless to move\nwheels, but it produces a magnetic field by which the adjusted iron of the\nmechanism is pulled into motion. Thus we find electricity and magnetism,\nneither of which are perceptible to human senses, producing results in\nmechanical movement. This analogy seems particularly good, since\n\fC. Drayton Thomas [Part\nelectricity alone would be powerless ; the magnetism, however, is somehow\ninseparable from it, and is the intermediary by which mechanical action\ncan be produced.\nHave we any further confirmation of the actual bodily presence of\nCommunicators at the sittings? For such confirmation I recount a few of\nthe statements made by Communicators, with indications that Feda sees\nthe speakers and that they occupy definite places in the room.\nContributory Support for the Hypothesis :\nCommunicators claim to have bodies.\nIt would seem that Feda can see the Communicators.\nCommunicators are indicated as occupying definite places in the\nseance room.\nCommunicators claim to have Bodies\nFeda : He says, Now this body, this body in which one finds oneself\nafter death\u2014this body is indeed a body. It seems to be very much more\na body, a material body, than I had supposed would be possible.\nFeda : Your mother's here. She's in front and looking so well. She\nsays you will see her one day and she says you will be quite satisfied with\nher appearance and health and well-being. She thinks that was one of the\nvery first satisfying things that she felt when she knew that she had got\nto the other side\u2014to look at everyone, at your father and Etta and many\nothers, and to see how extremely well they all looked, how bodily well.\nThen she says rapidly, \" Do try to get people out of the idea that this life\nis a kind of vague thought-existence.\" She knows that many people have\na vague fear at back of their minds that it is only a thought-body. She\ndoesn't know what a thought-body means to them, but supposes it must\nbe an imaginary body. \" There is nothing imaginary about it, unless you\nwould call your present body an imaginary one. It would be equally\nwrong to call ours an imaginary body. Our bodies are our own bodies,\nthey belong to us.\"\nHad my mother been versed in philosophical thought it is possible that\nshe would have phrased the above distinction more clearly. As it is, her\nmeaning is at least clear in the sense that to her, and to those around her,\nthere is nothing dream-like about her body. To her it seems much as\nwhen on earth it felt firm to the touch and was visible to others. Also it\nremains so and does not appear and disappear like a mental picture.\nTheir life is not like a dream in which one lives in a world of one's own,\nbut like this world when we awake from sleep to share it and its experiences\nwith other people.\nThe hypothesis around which this paper is written may help us to\nrealize somewhat more clearly than before the nature of the other-world\nbody. For we find that when a Communicator comes to the seance room\nhis body can affect the air by producing audible words in it ; also that\nthis is accomplished by a temporary use of that which emanates from the\nmedium, and is itself akin to the other-world body, although still attached\nto the physical organism of the medium and, to that extent, in a somewhat\ndifferent condition.\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 157\nThis difference of condition (in the psychic emanation, as compared\nwith that of the other-world body), may be analogous to the different\nconditions of water. Water remains simply HgO whether used to blow\na steam whistle, or to float a ship, or when existing invisibly as dampness in\nthe air.\nIn our work-a-day thinking we use images supplied by earthly experience\nand we speak of these in terms of our native tongue. The learned, when\npressing into the unknown, formulate their conceptions in special terms,\nsuch as \" fourth dimension \" ; but for ordinary people this is usually\ndifficult to follow. Even to conceive of solid objects as expressing to our\nsenses just one aspect of the intricate patterns of electric energy requires a\nmental effort for which the age-long ancestral struggle for protection,\nprovender and progeny has but poorly equipped us.\nSuffice it that we can realize that there are certain aspects of reality\nwhich we find it difficult to understand. Among these are the other-world\nbody and the kindred mediumistic emanation, the two which chiefly\nconcern us in this paper.\nIf we accept the statements of Communicators about their bodily form\nand its substantial reality we need no longer be puzzled as to how Feda is\nable to describe a speaker with such accuracy that, on reading the descrip-\ntion, the relatives remark that it is more accurate than they themselves\ncould have given. As many of these descriptions are of persons entirely\nunknown to me\u2014people who came to give evidence for friends who had\nrequested me to hold a proxy sitting for them\u2014it is obvious that Feda is\nnot reading my mind or obtaining a mental picture of the deceased from\nme. The explanation is simple when we visualize the Communicator\nstanding before Feda and letting her describe him as she sees him there.\nIt would seem that Feda can see the Communicator\nRemarks by Feda, about to be quoted, imply that she can see Com-\nmunicators and observe their actions. Such sight would seem to refer to\nher own personal organism ; for the medium's eyes are fast closed\nthroughout the sitting. But since Feda, while in control, is making use\nof the medium's organism, the latter's sense of sight might possibly be in\naction despite the fast-closed eyes. One does not know.\nDuring the discourse of a Communicator who had been a tutor and a\nminister Feda several times remarked, \" Oh, dear, he is going like that,\"\nand the medium's hands moved up and down.\nFeda will mention that a Communicator is smiling, as in the following :\n\" Casting one's bread upon the waters with a due\u2014he is smiling\u2014and\nnecessary knowledge of the tides!\n\"\nBreaking off suddenly, Feda says, \" What did you want? Oh, well, I'll\njust tell him you're here, but you mustn't interrupt. It's that other\nMr John\u2014the Mr Lamond.\"\nFeda : May I say a little about the lady first? I see she's changed\nplaces with the boy.\nFeda (alluding to my father who seemed to think that my sister was\ntelling me more than was discreet) : Oh, what's Mr John pulling faces\nfor? Well, she's not saying too much, Mr John.\n\fC. Drayton Thomas [Part\nFeda will mention that someone is nodding the head, as in the following :\n\" I think he's been near you at times lately. He says he has. He is\nnodding his head.\"\nFeda : Your mother is nodding her head a little, like that ; she says\nit is quite true.\nFeda : The ancestor is here. I thought he was here before, but just\nthen he went like that to me. (Medium's hands make a signalling move-\nment.)\nFeda : Etta's just pulling Howard's sleeve ;\n\" You mustn't go on too\nlong! \" and he looked down and said, \" Quite! \" so it was all right.\nIn the midst of Feda's transmission for an old friend there came a\nrather faint but very clear \" Hallo! \" in the D. V.\nFeda : She says, You cannot see me? She is close to you.\nC. D. T. asked where exactly the lady was standing. In reply I was told\nto hold out my hand, which the medium then guided.\nFeda : Hold it there. She has hers pressing it. Perhaps you can feel\nit. (I was not able to feel anything.)\nFeda : Elsie is here. I don't know if she has been there or not, I\ncouldn't really quite see ; I didn't see her before. Is she coming in,\nMrs John? AH right. Elsie is being very polite to mother, letting her\nspeak and drawing back again when she thought I was going to cut mother\noff. Elsie's waving her hand to go on, so it's all right. (A little later on)\nAll right, Elsie. The others have drawn to one side a bit and I think\nElsie can come in and speak now.\nFeda : While she is talking I am getting a rather long name beginning\nwith \" R \" and I feel I ought to give it you just here. It is a name with\nseveral letters. She is nodding her head, so I know I've got something\nthat is right.\nFeda (in the midst of a discourse when the Communicator was about to\nmake a striking disclosure, Feda remarked) :\n\" And then he comes close\nto you and says\u2014.\"\nWhile T. N. K. was speaking Feda twice remarked that his hand was\ngoing up and down as he talked. She suited the action to the words by\nmoving the medium's arm, raising and lowering it several times in succes-\nsion.\nOn another occasion, and with a ditferent speaker, the medium's hand\nwas raised, as if in warning, while Feda said, \" I had to be awful careful\nbecause Etta kept saying, \" Wait, wait, don't try to explain,\" because of\nwhat I thought it was. She kept on, \" Don't explain. Wait! Wait!\n\"\nC. D. T. : Did she wave a monitory finger at you, holding up her hand\nlike that?\nFeda : Yes, like that.\nThen we have the following kind of picture, in which the doings of the\nCommunicators are described, together with their words.\nFeda : Now Sir Oliver is standing up\u2014and you know how polite he is.\nHe's bowing to your mother, do you see? because he found that he had got\na little in front of her. You see your mother was there\u2014(the medium's\nhand points). She generally comes here (hand points again), your father\nhere and Etta there (hand points for each, direction). And mother had\nmoved back a bit and Sir Oliver didn't know that he was in front of her,\n\f173] ^ New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 159\ndo you see? So he turned round and he went like that (medium bows)\nHke he did when he went up to ask ladies to dance with him. Mother isn't\ngoing to dance with him. I don't think mother does dance. But that's\nwhat he's doing. Your mother says, \" No, no, no ;\nyou go on.\" And he\nsaid \" No,\" because your mother hadn't even been able to say Good\nmorning. So mother says it now.\n(All this was very lifelike, exactly as, say, an observer for the B.B.C.\nwould describe what was taking place from moment to moment at some\nfunction.)\n^ - \u2022\nCommunicators are indicated as occupying Definite Places\nIN THE Seance Room\nFeda : Stuart's over there, but father's here, near me. That's why\nhe's talking.\nFeda (breaking off in the midst of my father's talk) : Oh! . . . What\ndoes she want? Do you remember Marion? She has just looked in.\nShe is there (pointing).\nFeda : Don't come so close, Fanny. Don't come quite so close. I\ndon't like them to come close, because I don't breathe so easily. (While\nsaying this the medium coughed and waved Fanny away by hand move-\nments.)\n(While transmitting for another Communicator Feda suddenly said,\namid a succession of little coughs by the medium) : She came awful close,\nand that made me cough ; it stops the throat. When they feel deeply\nthey get drawn close without noticing it.\nFeda : What did you say, please, Etta ? What did you say ? Oh,\nwait a minute. Yes, I see he's there. What does he want to say ? Wait\na minute. Oh, it's that Mr William, do you remember ? He sends his\ngreetings. I don't know why he is speaking to Stuart : he and Stuart\nseem to be rather friendly.\nWhile a Communicator named Marion was in ,the midst of discourse, a\nlady who had previously spoken in the sitting intervened to give an\nopinion. Feda seemed to realize that this interruption was likely to cause\nconfusion, and appealed to my sister, saying, \" Perhaps Etta will take her\nout into the garden a bit. Just take her away a minute. That's better.\nYes, that's all right. Now you go on, Marion.\"\nFeda had remarked on my mother's interest in watching an ancestor\nthen present, and I said, \" You are very observant, Feda.\" She replied,\n\" If you were where Feda is, and doing the work Feda's doing, you\ncouldn't help noticing these things. I notice things which your mother\ndoesn't know she is doing. When the ancestor is there and your mother is\nthere (hand points to right and to left) your mother sometimes moves two\nsteps that way so as to look at him better, so as to watch him. It's as if\nshe's watching him, Mr Draytie, to see if he means something more than\nhe's saying, because it has to do with you. Perhaps she doesn't know that\nshe does it, do you see? and\u2014What? No, she certainly hadn't been aware\nof doing it. Mr John thinks I am right.\nThe above remarks by Feda are selected from records covering several\nyears. They imply that she sees Communicators present in the room and\n\fi6o C. Drayton Thomas \u2022 .\n[Part\ncan both observe their movements and hear their spoken words. Mean-\nwhile all else goes to support this ; I notice nothing to cast a doubt on it.\nYet it would, of course, remain unconvincing were it not for {a) the\narresting accuracy of the many-sided and multiplied evidential portions of\nthe messages, and {b) a compelling sense of the presence and characteristics\nof the persons purporting to speak.\nThe combined result of these features gives much the same impression\nas does a conversation over the telephone, save that one does not hear that\nidentifying personal quality of voice which is usually recognizable over the\nphone. I do not suggest that talks through a medium are as free and\nunrestricted as over the phone ; for that would be to press the similarity\nunduly. But the similarity is there, as those who have enjoyed a really\ngood sitting (and not allowed its impression to fade with time!) will\nrealize.\nAdd this to the evidence provided by direct-voice whispers and it will\nbe realized that my hypothesis for the real presence of an embodied\nCommunicator is sufficiently strong to warrant my whole-hearted belief.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the course of my twenty-eight years of Leonard sittings there has been\nnothing to throw doubt on Feda's ability to see and accurately describe the\nCornmunicators, and also to hear their spoken words. This ability seems\nto differ from our use of eyes and ears in that Feda habitually uses only\none of these senses at a time, and not the two together as do we. Whether\nshe cannot see and hear at the same moment, or whether it is her habit to\nconcentrate on one at a time, I do not know, nor does it concern our present\nquest ;\nsuffice it that she certainly gives constant and abundant proof\nthat she can see, and equally compelling proof that she can hear actual\nwords, while the sitter hears nothing but her voice.\nAnd then, during the gitting, everything happens exactly as if the Com-\nmunicator were just in front of the medium and at the sitter's left shoulder ;\nthat means that he occupies a definite position in space.\nIt would be difficult to accept the above without admitting that the\nCommunicator is present in body, even if we are unable to picture exactly\nwhat kind of substance forms the body which to our senses remains\nintangible and invisible. We have quoted sufficient to show that Feda\nand Communicator stoutly assert such bodies.\nAt this point some readers will think that reference should have been\nmade to exteriorization of the etheric body and also to full-bodied\nmaterializations. But I think it best to deal only with those aspects of\npsychic manifestation which I have personally experienced, and experi-\nenced repeatedly year after year through more than 500 sittings. Those\nreaders who have studied the physical phenomena of the seance room will\nbe able to add support for my hypothesis.\nThe new evidence which is adduced in this paper concerns the direct\nvoice in Leonard sittings. It is difficult to believe that this voice could be\nproduced without a producer, and a producer who was using bodily organs\nof some kind for his speech.\n\f173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 161\nIt is unnecessary for the purpose of this article to allude to the view held\nby Theosophists that certain changes will take place successively in one's\nother-world body, or perhaps that it already consists of a succession of\nbodies one within the other like the skins of an onion. This paper does\nnot go beyond the view that the other-world body is essentially the one\nwhich we already possess, but which does not come into its full activity\nuntil it has broken free from the flesh at death.\nThe Psychic Emanation\nIt is obvious that the phenomena of good mediumistic sittings depend\non the presence of something which is either absent from the happenings\nof mankind's daily life, or is not acting there in the same' conditions and\nmanner. What is this mysterious something? In my view we find, in\nthe facts adduced above, sufficient to indicate that it is something pro-\nceeding from the medium. Although imperceptible and intangible, it may\nbe studied by the results which its presence makes possible. Modern\nscience has made great discoveries by inferring, from results observed,\nthe nature of invisible things ; in similar manner we can infer the presence\nof this psychic emanation and something about its nature. It would seem\nto differ from any substance known to science, and to be closely related\nto the nervous energy of the physical body. What is the difference between\na living body and the same body immediately after its life has been extin-\nguished by a stroke of lightning.-' \" Its life is gone,\" we say. But what\nexactly is that \" life \", the absence of which leaves but a corpse devoid of\nenergy and mental action?\nIt may be that we are correctly informed when Communicators assert\nthat the power, or emanation, coming from the medium brings with it,\nor contains, something of her living energy and therefore of her mind.\nIt is not exactly material, but seems on the border line between matter\nand spirit (Spirit being thought of as the energizing and life-sustaining\nfactor). If then this emanation partakes of both this world and of an\nexistence beyond it, we have here the intermediate substance which makes\npossible the interaction between matter in the brain and the Self v\/hich\ninterprets nerve impulses coming from the five senses. We see, feel, etc.\nand we perceive thereby our material environment. In lowly forms of life,\nsuch as insects and animals, this takes place in low degree. In higher\nforms of life, as with ourselves, it takes place in higher degree. In mentally\nalert and in spiritually minded people it would seem to act in a degree yet\nhigher. In the psychically sensitive it enables a mode of seeing, hearing,\nfeeling and impression which is independent of the five physical senses.\nThe Non-Material Body\nOur earth and its material objects are perceived by us because they are\nin a certain condition. Were they reduced to the gaseous state, or to their\nultimate electric forces, they would no longer be perceptible to our senses.\nWhen we change from our habitation in the physical body and find\nourselves in an etherial one, our etherial senses will no longer be in cor-\nrespondence with material objects, but with etherial environment.\n\fl62 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nHence visitants from the Beyond speak of our doors and walls as misty\nand penetrable ;\nthey speak of their ability to move through them without\nhindrance or inconvenience, much as mist blows through wire netting or\nthe leafless trees of winter. j\nBy analogy it might be said that, on the chessboard of reality, they move\n'\non the white squares while we move on the black ; hence each moves ,\nfreely without impeding the other. I\nIt is not easy to realize the real presence in our home of one who died,\n*\nand whose body we saw buried. Repeated evidence given through\nsensitives to whom we are strangers is arresting ; it often describes with\naccuracy objects in our private room, and conversations of which none\noutside the house could know. It is so difficult to picture the invisible\nCommunicator noting these trifles in order that he may off'er them as\nevidence of his visit ; so difficult, indeed, that every kind of alternative\nexplanation is toyed with rather than accept the simple truth. Some of\nthese guessed alternatives are ingenious, and the most effective of them\nembody such half-truths that it is, perhaps, the more scholarly and\nintellectual persons who are most influenced by them. j\nWe are so accustomed to depend on the senses of sight, sound and touch \\\nthat inference from observed facts, our own and those of others, seems\ntoo frail a cord on which to hang a stupendous fact.\nFor without doubt the presence with us, from time to time, of those\nwhom we have long regarded as \" departed \", gone for ever, would be as\npulverising to a multitude of accepted ideas as was the atomic bomb to\nHiroshima. I should not have said \" the presence \", but rather a firm ,\nacceptance of it as a fact based on adequate evidence. To conventional i\nminds such a revolutionary fact would require, not merely adequate\nevidence, but its general acceptance by society. Until clergy, doctors and\nscientists believe, and the Press broadcasts it, why should one risk ridicule i\nby professing belief.'' And so ulterior motives and fears are called in to\nexcuse hesitancy and incredulity.\nBut the prize is great! No unnecessary risks should be accepted ;\nyet\nindependent thought and conclusions, firmly based on ascertained fact,\nBhould be forthcoming by at least one here and there ; and where such an\none leads to-day the multitude will follow on some radiant to-morrow.\nFor myself, I have no trace of doubt. I know that the invisibles visit\nmy home ;\nyet I have not the sensitivity needed for clairvoyant glimpse of\nthem, the clairaudience, or the convincing feeling of their nearness! Some ;\nhave these gifts and I envy them ; the arduous path of study, argument\nand inference is not for these favoured souls. They can enter into a\nrealization of the truth as easily as do children into a realization of this\nworld of sense.\nBut it may be that those who pay m.ost for truth do most appreciate\nit when obtained, and also make the best use of it.\nSuch would be the convinced scientists, the philosophers, the biologists\nand the physicists. Something new would be added to that which they\nknow, something shedding light on dark problems, opening out a new\npath of understanding.\nBetween body and the Self, there would be recognized an intermediary\nwhich translates sense vibrations on the brain into perceptions by the\n\f173] A Neiv Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 163\nSelf ; a body whose form was the mould, or scaffolding, upon which the\ngrowing physical form was built up to maturity.\nThe hypothesis put forward in this article, namely, the real but non-\nphysical body of Communicators, seems to me a decided advance upon\nthe current ideas about materialization. Readers will be familiar with the\nwork of Baron von Schrenck Notzing and others on that subject ; the\ngeneral conception being that the materializing mediums supply from\ntheir own body the sheath, or covering, which protects the emanation,\nand that this combination (called ectoplasm) is built up into the form of a\nhuman body, in whole or part ;\nthat, in the best instances, this temporary\nbody can be somehow indwelt by a discarnate, even to the degree of\nmaking speech and movement possible.\nSimilarly in regard to Direct Voice seances, the general idea is that the\nectoplasm provided by the physical medium is built up into temporary\nvoice organs which the discarnate can use for speech.\nIn both cases it is surmised that, without these temporary loans from\nthe medium, a discarnate is devoid of a body, or at least of anything\ncorresponding to our idea of bodily substance.\nIt has always been a strain on the imagination to suppose that vocal\norgans could act on air without lungs, or that lungs and vocal organs\ncould be supported on nothing during their brief activities in the seance\nroom. On my hypothesis the vocal organs and the complete body are\nalready in existence, the Communicator comes to us in that body\u2014his\nother-world body\u2014and has but to make use of such conditions as the\nseance room offers. He can, for materialization, clothe or impregnate his\nbody with the ectoplasm ;\nv\/hile, for Direct Voice, he simply speaks and\nrelies on the vibration produced in the psychic emanation to effect a\nsecondary vibration in the air, so making his speech audible.\nThis hypothesis considerably simplifies the previous conjectures and,\nto that extent, makes credence more easy and intelligent.\nIf, then, my hypothesis should prove true to fact, we have a means of\nstudying, in some small degree, that bodily form which will be our only\none when at death we leave flesh and blood behind. And, furthermore,\nwe have means of investigating the extent of its functions here and now as\nan intermediary between the essential Self and this physical body which\nfor the time being we inhabit.\n\fSOME EXPERIMENTS IN WILLED DIE-THROWING\nBy J. Eraser Nicol and Whately Carington\nIntroduction (W. W. C.)\nSome time in the course of the year 1934, or thereabouts, I was informed\nprivately by Dr Rhine of the remarkable results he had been obtaining in\nwhat is now commonly known as Psychokinesis (PK), notably as regards\nattempts to influence the fall of a die by merely \" willing \" which face\nshould come uppermost. It seemed to me important that these experi-\nments should be repeated, and their outcome confirmed, if possible ; but\ncontemporary circumstances prevented my undertaking the necessary\nwork myself. I accordingly wrote to Mr Eraser Nicol, of Edinburgh, who\nhad already performed a large number of experiments of this kind in\nconnection with my experiments in Precognitive Guessing.^ In the\ncourse of the next three years, or thereabouts, Mr Nicol carried out a great\ndeal of work on these lines, involving a total of more than 139,000 throws.\nThe results obtained were highly suggestive of a positive effect ; but it\nwas felt that they were not strong enough, where a phenomenon of so\nnovel and startling a character was concerned, to warrant publication in the\nabsence of supporting evidence, especially as the most important effect\n(p. 172 below) was not discovered till quite recently. Moreover, Dr Rhine\ndid not begin to publish his own results until March 1943, and it might\nwell have been deemed improper for us to have published our lesser\ncontribution, even with due acknowledgments, before he felt that his\nmuch greater one was ready to be presented. The whole matter was\naccordingly put into cold storage, and until very recently no more than\nrelatively superficial assessments of the results were attempted.\nWith the publication of Dr Rhine's results, however, it has seemed\nworth while to re-examine the data somewhat more thoroughly, and an\naccount of the course of the experiments and their outcome is presented\nbelow. It is not claimed that the results obtained amount to anything\napproaching coercive demonstration of the phenomena, but it is felt that\nthey constitute useful collateral evidence tending to support Dr Rhine's\nmain conclusion.\nPART I. ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS (J. F. N.)\nThese attempts at willed die-throwing began on 7th October, 1934 ; the\nbulk of the work was carried through in two years, and the whole series\ncame to a conclusion on 15th August, 1938. In all there were 227 experi-\nments or \" runs \". With only some half-dozen exceptions a run comprised\neither 120 or 2400 throws. The total number of throws was 139,396. Of\nthis total, 133,756 throws were witnessed and 5,640 were unwitnessed.\nOnly one die was used in each experiment (in Group 2 two dice were\n^Journal S.P.R., Nos. 516 and 521, Vol. XXIX.\n164\n\f[Part 173] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwiitg . 165\nbrought intQ action, but only one of these had any direct relationship to\nthe PK side of the work).\nFrom start to finish the shaking and throwing were done by hand,\nwithout the use of mechanical contrivances. The same leather shaker\nwas used throughout. Its internal measurements were : height 7-8 cms.,\ndiameter of base 4 cms., diameter of mouth 4-5 cms.\nThe shaking and throwing were conducted in the most straightforward\nfashion. All those who so unsparingly gave their time and patience to the\nwork were well known to me, but even so a watch was kept for develop-\nments of \" tricky throwing \" and nothing of the kind was ever observed.\nIt was a rule that the die must be shaken in the box at least once ; in\npractice several quick shakes were generally made. The die was dis-\ncharged on to a table and might roll any distance up to several feet. A die\nfalling dead from the box\n\u2014\ni.e. without rolling on the table\u2014was dis-\nallowed, but this was a very rare occurrence. On occasions when the die\nfell to the floor the throw was recorded if the die came to a standstill in a\nlevel position and ignored if it were tilted, e.g. against the edge of a carpet\nor the angle of a wall.\nIt was also a rule that the die must get an unobstructed passage from the\nbox to the table without intermediately touching the thrower's fingers.\nThe throws were recorded in ink on suitably ruled sheets of foolscap\npaper.\nThe experiments may conveniently be subdivided into four groups.\nGroup I was not designed as an example of PK\u2014in fact psychokinesis\nhad not then been heard of on this side of the Atlantic, at any rate not by\nthe present writer. It was planned as a new approach to the problem of\nprecognitive guessing. My own efforts in that particular field were so\nfeeble that it occurred to me\u2014in an ironic hour\u2014that a die might be a\nmore successful prophet than myself. An experiment was therefore con-\nducted on the following lines.\nA die, afterwards known as the \" selector \" die, was thrown and the\nresult recorded. A second, \" working \", die was then thrown and the\nresult entered opposite the previous one. If the two figures coincided it\nwas supposed that precognition was at work (subject of course to statistical\nassessment).\nThe notion that one die may precognise the fall of another die is doubt-\nless as improbable an hypothesis as any thus far proposed in psychical\nresearch. The raw data were laid aside, and it was only at a much later\ndate that a less repellent hypothesis suggested itself. This hypothesis may\nbest be stated in the form of a question : Having seen the face shown by\nthe selector die, was it possible that\u2014unconsciously or otherwise\u2014I then\ntried or willed to throw the same face with the working die? If such were\nthe true course of events then the result, if statistically significant, would\nbe a successful experiment in psychokinesis.\nGroup 2 comprises a series of 1 14 runs carried through between January\nand December 1935. Twelve persons took part, most of them performing\nat least seven runs of 120 throws each (see Table i). In his first run the\nsubject tried to throw I's, in his second' to throw 2's, and so on to the\ncompletion of the sequence with experiment six. It will be seen, therefore,\nthat there was no liberty of choice. However, at the conclusion of this\n\fi66 J. Fraser Nicol and Whately Carington [Part\nrouline he had one extra run, trying to throw a face-number decided upon\nby himself. Plainly, these chosen-face trials, if the results proved\nsignificant, could more simply be interpreted as successful precognition,\nrather than as psychokinesis. There is no need to call in a PK hypothesis\nwhen a presumably simpler one will amply explain any non-chance results.\nAll jf this work was witnessed except for a second, extra, routine set of\nmy o^vn.\nWhen the throwing in this group had proceeded for some time, with a\ndie known as \" Die 2 \", it became evident that the poorest scores were\nreturned when the target was face 3. The final data for this die (see\nTable 4) show that it was, if anything, even more heavily biased against\n4 than 3 ; but at the particular time in mind there was no question that 3\nwas the most difficult face to \" will \". Because of the recalcitrance of\nface 3\u2014and for no other reason\u2014I determined to try' to subject that face\nto a prolonged session of willing. It will therefore be clear that such an\nexperiment was not a chosen-face experiment in the sense previously\nindicated.\nIt happened that on the night of this session no witnesses were available.\nThe box and die were shaken with the left hand and the results entered\nwith the right. The duration of the session was not fixed beforehand,\nand only the time on the clock (an early hour of the morning) brought the\nsession to a compulsory close.\nThe score for these 3's will be shown in Section 2 to be highly signi-\nficant. The whole affair is, of course, open to criticism, and this I think\nmay follow two lines.\n(1) That the throwing was prematurely stopped at a point where the\nscore happened to reach a satisfactory stage of significance, but that if the\nsession had continued longer the high scoring would have faded out and\nno significant result would have emerged. My own impression was, and is,\nthat if PK be a genuine phenomenon its manifestation is probably spas-\nmodic and variable (cf. Rhine's decline effect or certain variations\ndiscussed in Section 2 of this paper). To dismiss the present result as due\nto \" premature stopping \" may only blind us to the sort of thing that is\ngoing on.\n(2) That the throwing and recording were unwitnessed and are hence\nundeserving of serious consideration. This is the objection which I would\nmake against other experimenters finding themselves in the same plight, and\nI can hardly complain if the same criticism is directed against me\u2014even\nthough I have the fullest confidence that the results are substantially correct.\nSeveral other efforts were made to throw other faces, on the same lines\nand for much the same reasons as those already given. Most of the throws\nwere unwitnessed and the results were unimpressive. These were,\nhowever, recorded and have been included below.\nGroup 3 consisted of attempts by Mr Gordon L. N. Hadden and J. F. N.\nto throw specified faces with a Crown and Anchor die.\nGroup 4. Experience derived from Groups i to 3 seemed to point to\nthe conclusion that high scoring was most likely to be attained if each\nsession were continued over a rather long period, say an hour or two ; and\nespecially so if the throwing were carried out at a fairly high speed.\nAccordingly, Group 4 was conducted on the following lines:\n\f173] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwing 167\nEach run comprised 2,400 throws. At his first session the subject aimed\nat face i, at his second at face 2, and so on up to the 6th and last session\nwhen the target-face was 6. Each person therefore made 2400 x 6 = 14,400\nthrov.'s. As eight subjects took part the total number of throws was\n115,200.\nFrom a technical point of view this group forms the most satisfactory\nsection of the whole series. The conditions were tightened up and made\nuniform as far as possible. Thus the same die\u2014Die 3 \u2014was used through-\nout ;\nlength of side 9 mm., weight 1-50 gm. The same dice-box was\nemployed for all throws. The die being small and the box relatively large\nthere could be no doubt about the thorough disturbance of the die when\nshaken. On all occasions the die was ejected on to a special piece of green\nbaize stretched across whichever table was in use. All throws were wit-\nnessed.\nA serious mishap broke into the throwing at an early stage. \"\nAt the\n2930th throw the die\u2014Die 2\u2014bounced from the table across the room\nand into a blazing fire. Consequently a fresh start had to be made, this\ntime with Die 3, details of which have been given in the preceding para-\ngraph. Thereafter events proceeded smoothly.\nPART II. ASSESSMENT (W. W. C.)\nThe data collected have been examined with some approach to exhaustive-\nness ;\nbut, since most of the results have been null, there is nothing to be\ngained by going into details here. It will be seen, however, that there are\ntwo major effects, and one of these in the large block of witnessed throws\nforming Group 4, which strongly indicate the operation of a genuine\nPK effect.\nIt will be convenient not to take the four groups of throws in their\nchronological order, but to dispose first of the small contributions from\nI and 3 before dealing with the more important 2 and 4.\nTable i\nGroup I Group 2 Group 3 Group 4\nRoutine Chosen Face\nMiss A.

Fraser Nicol and Whately Carington [Part\nGroup I, as explained in Part I, was not strictly a PK experiment at all,\nin the sense that it was not intended as such ; but it is relevant because\nany significant result would involve supposing that PK factors were\noperative, even if precognition of how the second die was about to fall\nwere assumed.\nThe work consisted of 1200 double throws, i.e. 1200 of the \" selector\n\"\ndie and 1200 of the \" working die \", so to call them. The results are\nshown in Table 2.\nTable 2\nWhen\nselector Working die showed\ndie showed 123456 Total\n1 37 \u2022\n^ 184\n2 40 210\n3 33 202\n4 21 187\n5 37 204\n6 55 213\nTotal 195 190 198 177 195 245 1200\nThat is to say, the selector die showed i on 184 occasions, and on 37 of\nthese the working die also showed i, each of these 37 constituting a\nsuccess or \" hit \" ; the working die similarly showed 2 on 40 of the 210\noccasions when the selector die shov\/ed 2 ; and so on. And the working\ndie showed i on 195 occasions, 2 on 190 occasions, etc.\nThere are 223 hits (and 977 failures) altogether against an a priori\nexpectation of 200 hits and 1000 failures. This gives X- as 3 '174 and P\nslightly less than -08, which is not significant.\nBut it is evident by inspection that the selector die was heavily biassed in\nfavour of face 6, and the working die slightly so. To allow for this we do\nnot use the a priori expectation of one-sixth the total number of trials,\nbut calculate the sum of the products of corresponding marginal totals\n(195 X 184 + 190 X 210 . . . etc.) and divide by 1200. This gives a true\nexpectation of 200-7 successes and 999-3 failures. Note that this calculated\nexpectation would necessarily agree with the a priori value if the thrower\nmade equal numbers of attempts (viz. 200 here) at each of the six faces,\ninstead of a number dependent on the vagaries of the selector die.\nBut the bias of the dice also affects the variance ; so that, to obtain an\naccurate result, we make use of Stevens' method (Proc. S.P.R., Part 162,\np. 132) and calculate this quantity as 168-874. This, in conjunction with\nthe true expectation of 200-7 successes, gives as 3-051 and P very nearly\n-08. The difference is trivial, but the procedure is one which must be\napplied in all doubtful cases, since dice can never be safely assumed to be\nunbiassed.\nThe result is some way from significance ; but the odds are about 1 1 to i\nagainst obtaining this number of successes, or more, by chance alone,\nwhich is perhaps more promising than one would expect. The technique\nseems one which might be worth further development.\n\fI 73] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwing 169\nGroup 3 may be dismissed with even greater brevity. A total of 2067\nthrows was made by two subjects using a \" Crown and Anchor \" die.\nOf these 338 were successful against an a priori expectation of 344-5.\nThe deficiency is not significant, giving X'^ -125 with P -72. But the die\nwas heavily biassed, and more exact treatment gives an excess of 11-4\nhits above true expectation, with .Y^ -432 and P -52. There is no suggestion,\nhowever, that any PK factor is at work.\nGroup 2 is much larger and very mixed. It consists, first, of 14,280\nthrows, of which 8,640 were witnessed and 5,640 were not, by 1 1 subjects\nusing the die known as \" Die 2 \". Of the witnessed throws there are\nsix completed sets of routine work, in which the subject made 120 throws\nat each of the six faces in turn, one half-finished set, making 4,680 throws,\nand 33 runs of 120 throws each in which the subject was trying for some\nface chosen by himself, viz. 3,960 throws. The unwitnessed material, all\nby J. F. N., comprises two long series of 22 and 15 runs trying for faces\n3 and 5 respectively, 4 runs trying for face i, and one set of routine work.\nTotal 47 runs, or 5,640 throws.\nThen, with Die 4, there is a routine set and a chosen face run from each\nof four subjects, and a half set from another, making 28 runs or 3,360\nthrows. All these were witnessed. There is also half a witnessed routine\nset with Die 3.\nFinally, I have included in this Group a total of 2,929 throws with Die 2,\nwhich were originally intended to be part of the big block of 115,200\nthrows known as Group 4, but were interrupted by accidental destruction\nof the die, as explained in Part I.\nThe total for this Group is accordingly 20,929 throws. These may\nconveniently be summarized in tabular form as under :\nTable 3\nDie 2 Die 3\nR C R C\nWitnessed 7609 3960 360 \u2014\nUnwitnessed 720 4920 \u2014 \u2014\nDie 4 Total\nR C R C\n2880 480 10,849 4'44\u00b0\nTotal 8329 8880 360 \u2014 2880 480 11,569 9,360\nTotal 20,929\nIn this table R stands for routine work and C for chosen face trials.\nSince the results of chosen face trials, even if positive and significant,\nmight be attributed to the subject having precognised a face about to\nappear with above chance frequency (as J. F. N. points out), we may set\nall these aside for the mom^ent and begin by examining the witnessed\nroutine throws with Die 2. The full data are given in Table 4.\nIt will be understood that the first three lines include the three runs of\nthe half set mentioned above, and the top line also the 2,929 throv\/s\nintended as the beginning of the big block of Group 4, but interrupted as\nexplained.\nThe leading diagonal shows a total of 1,328 hits against an exact expecta-\ntion, calculated from the marginal totals, of 1274-7, showing an excess of\n53-3. The value of X'^ is 2-68 with P about -i, which is not significant,\n\flyo J. Eraser Nicol and Whately Carington f [Part\nthough not unpromising. The values of the expectations for the six cells\nare 635-5, 159-0, 125-0, 106-2, 127-6 and 121-5. It is noteworthy that the\nobserved number of hits exceeds the expected value in all six cases. The\nprobability of this occurring by chance is 1\/2^ or i in 64 ; but this must\nbe doubled as the same would be true if all six observed values were less\nthan expectation. Still, a value of P so small as -03 is by no means to be\ndisregarded.\nTo the total excess of 53-3, the six complete routine sets contribute\n29 points (749 hits against an expectation of 720), and the \" oddments \",\ntherefore, 24-3 points.\nTable 4 '\n\"\n,\nWhen Subjects actually threw\ntrying\nfor I 2 3 4 5 6 Total\nI 692 539 564 685 638 3769\n2 132 164 127 132 139 146 840\n3 155 165 134 \"3 135 138 840\n4 117 144 112 120 117 1 10 720\n5 119 134 102 102 135 128 720\n6 .\n109 141 118 91 137 124 720\nTotal 1283 1440 1132 1 122 1348 1284 7609\nNo individual subject in this batch gives a significant result ; the best\nvalue of is about 3-24 with P -07, and the second best is 2-88 with\nP about -09. The sum of X\"s for all nine subjects is 8-21 with nine d.f.,\nwhich is quite negligible.\nThe three witnessed routine runs with Die 3 show 58 hits ; the expecta-\ntion, calculated as one-third of the total observed frequency of the three\nfaces (4, 5, 6) tried for, is 56-7, so that the subject just, though negligibly,\ngives a positive result.\nThe four witnessed routine sets with Die 4 show a total excess of 10 hits\nover the exact expectation of 480, which is negligible, while no subject\ncomes anywhere near attaining significance. On the other hand, one\nsubject (J. A. S. W.) scores so high as 35 in one of his runs of 120, against\nan exact expectation of 21-82, giving A\"- as 12-915 and P less than -ooi.\nBut this is not maintained (he scores two points below expectation for his\nwhole set) and can hardly be taken as definitely significant in the context\nof the whole group, though very v\/ell worth noting. Perhaps we might\naccord it a value of about -02 as the best of 24 runs forming this subsection\nof the data.\nConsidering next the chosen-face trials, which, as already observed, are\nof lesser importance, we find that the 33 runs with Die 2 show an excess of\n37 hits above the expectation of 660, using the a priori value which will\nmake no appreciable diff^erence here ; this gives A'^ as 2-498 with P about\n\u202212. No subject is at all outstanding, but J. F. N. scores 187 hits in his\nfirst batch of eight runs against an exact expectation of 165-6, giving\nas 3 -34 and P about -07, which is mildly promising and of some interest in\nview of his later performance. The four chosen-face runs by the four\n\f173] Some Experiments in Willed Die- Throwing 171\nsubjects with Die 4 are of little interest, for they only succeed in scoring a\ntotal of six points below a priori expectation.\nWhen we turn to the unwitnessed material by J. F. N. working alone\nwe find results of considerably greater interest. The first item, chrono-\nlogically, is a set of six routine runs, and in no way noteworthy, for the\nscore is only five points above expectation.\nBut in his first attempt at concentrating on a single face (3), selected\nbecause the die seemed (and was) biassed against it, J. F. N. scores no\nfewer than 493 successes in 22 runs (2,640 throws). The exact expectation\nis 415-89, calculated from all the Die 2 data, so that the excess is 77'ii,\ngiving a value for A'- of 16-75 with P somewhat better than -oooi or one\nin ten thousand.\nThe distribution of successes within the runs is also remarkablfe. The\nscores in order are\n19, 17, 18, 18, 22, 20, 25, 18, 24, 16, 25,\n14. \/ 34> 25, 22, 29, 29, 27, 23, 21, 22, 25.\nThe first twelve runs (up to the dividing mark \/) are uneventful and show\nonly a score of 236 against an expectation of about 227, whereas the last ten\nare all above expectation and show a total of 257 against expectation of about\n189. If we arbitrarily divide the series into halves and compare the first\nwith the second, we find A'- as 5-75 with P less than -02. Note that all\n22 runs were done at a single session.\nIt is, of course, exceedingly unfortunate that this series of trials was\nunwitnessed, and anyone is entitled, if he insists, to disregard it altogether\non this account. But it seems difficult to understand why, if J. F. N.'s\nsubconscious suddenly elected to make him cheat, or discovered how to do\nso, it should not have kept it up in his subsequent attempts, also unwit-\nnessed, under substantially the same conditions. These consisted of 15\nruns (1,800 throws), also in a single session, aimed at face 5, which gave\nonly 323 hits for an exact expectation of 316-7, the excess of 6-3 being\nnegligible ; and four runs trying for face i, which yielded only 67 hits\nagainst exact expectaton of 78-4, which is also of no interest.\nNote also that the successes in the big session for threes cannot plausibly\nbe attributed to precognition, because the face was chosen on the express\nground that three was one of the least likely faces to be thrown.\nIt is believed that, despite their being unwitnessed, these runs may safely\nbe accepted as having considerable evidential value.\nGroup 4, consisting of 115,200 throws made by eight subjects, each of\nwhom made 2,400 throws in trying for each face of the die, is, in a way,\nthe piece de resistance of the work, and accordingly deserves especially\ncareful study ; but its compact form enables us to deal with it a good deal\nmore easily than the group just considered.\nThe total score in the leading diagonal amounts to 19,291 hits, while the\nexact expectation is, of course, 19,200. The difference of 91, though\npositive, is very far from significance. Its variance, calculated by Stevens'\nmethod is' 15,954-07 with standard error of 126-305, giving a normal\ndeviate of only -720 with P no better than about -47. Subjects clearly do\nnot, in general, succeed in throwing the faces they desire to any non-\nchance extent.\n\f172 y. Fi aser Nicol and Whately Carington [Part\nThe main results are given in Table 5 below :\nTable 5 .\nWhen\ntrying Subjects actually threw\nlor I\n4 5 6 Total\nI 3481 3421 2778 2961 2907 -j6t;2 19200\n2 3507 2735 2943 2854 19300\n3 3570 3571 2638 2881 2833 3707 19200\n4 3451 3601 2663 3016 2803 3666 19200\n5 3419 3559 2724 2904 2934 t66o 19200\n6 3568 3630 2739 2836 2712 3715 19200\nTotal 20928 21289 16277 17541 17043 22122 1 15200\nBut, logically speaking, the more fundamental question is whether\nthrows are wholly independent of intention, as they should be if chance\nfactors alone are operative ; for it might well be that subjects, exerting\nsome kind of influence over the fall of the die, but unable, through ignor-\nance, etc. properly to control it, might produce results other than those\nintended.\nTo investigate this we apply the ordinary test of independence for a\ncontingency table, calculating the values of -Y- for each of the 36 cells and\nsumming to obtain a A'' with 25 d.f. This comes to 38-371, with P\nsomewhat better than -05. We may conclude with fair assurance that the\nface thrown is not independent of the intention of the thrower, even\nthough that intention is not directly realized.\nThe principal way in which this non-independence shows itself becomes\nclear, if we tabulate the deviations from expectation for each cell separately,\nas in Table 6.\nTable 6\nWilled Thrown\nI 2 3 4 5 6\nI - 7-00 - 127-17 65-17 37-50 66-50 -35-00\n2 - 49-00 -41-17 22-17 19-50 13-50 35-00\n3 82-00 22-83 -74-87> -42-50 -7-50 20-00\n4 -37-00 52-83 -49-83 92-50 -37-50 -21-00\n5 - 69-00 10-83 1 1 -17 - 19-50 93-50 - 27-00\n6 80-00 81-83 26-17 -87-50 - 128-50 28-00\nThe deviations, of differing signs and magnitudes, are for the most part\nscattered erratically about the table ; but there is one feature that at once\nstrikes the eye, namely the fact that, in the leading diagonal, all three\ndeviations for the low valued faces, i,.2 and 3 are negative, and all those\nfor the high faces, 4, 5 and 6 are positive. The total for the low faces is\n-123-00 with mean -41-00, and for the high faces 214-00 with mean\n71-33. The difl^erence between the totals is 337-00 and between the means\nis 112-33.\n\f173] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwing 173\nNow, it has recently been shown by Stevens (unpubhshed result) that\nthe variance of any linear function\nC = ^iCi + ^2*^2 + h^z + \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 k^Cn\nof the leading entries, q, c^, . . . c\u201e of an n x n Contingency Table is\ngiven by\nVariance (C) = jiVf^ + N {Ekm) - Skhn [a\n+\u00bb|\nwhere mj=ajbj\/N ; M= k^m-^^+k.2m^+ . . . k\u201em.^ ;\na^, a^, . . . a\u201e,\n^2> ^3 . . . b\u201e are the row and column totals ; and N the grand total.\nTo test the significance of the ditference between the High and Low\nscores, we take = ^2 = ^3 = \" ^ '^^^ k^ = k-=kg = i and from the data of\nTable 5 find the variance to be 12,754-82 with standard error 112-935.\nSince the differenee, as noted above, is 337, this gives D\/s = 2-984, with\nP=*oo27, which is highly significant. It would remain significant at\n\u2022027, even if we were to multiply by 6 1\/2-3 '3 '\n= 1\u00b0' which is the number of\nways in which it is possible to divide six entries into two groups of three\neach ; but of these the only two sharp and natural divisions seem to be\ninto High and Low and Odd and Even, so that to multiply by 4 would\nappear to meet all reasonable requirements.\nThere seems no doubt that this is a genuine eff'ect, and it is not so\nrecondite or so \" senseless \", if I may put it so, that it can be dismissed as\njust one of those significant features which one is bound to find sooner or\nlater, if only one examines enough of them. It is not, so to say, a first\norder effect\u2014the total overall score, which was the prime object of the\nwork, is unique in that\u2014but it is a very good second order one ; for the\nquestion whether subjects do better with some faces than with others is\none of the most obvious to ask. And it is not particularly far-fetched to\nsuppose that some such factor as a subconscious antipathy to low values\nmight reverse the PK influence, and thus cause it to cancel out the positive\nresult obtained when trying for high faces.\nThe effect appears to be general rather than confined to a few subjects\nonly, as is shown by the contributions made to the deviations for low and\nhigh faces by individual subjects, as shown in Table 7.\nTable 7\nSubject Low High Total\nAH 40-38 40-63 81-01\nGH -40-62 -15-37 -55-99\nSM - 21-62 70-63 49-01\nFN 23-38 17-63 41 -oi\nJN -37-62 74-63 37-01\nWN - 36-62 -IO-37 -46-99\nJW -33-62 20-63 -12-99\nJY - 16-62 15-63 - -99\nTotal - 122-96 214-04 91-08\n(The minor discrepancies between these and previous figures are,\nof course, due to the arithmetical approximations used.)\n\f174 J. Fraser Nicol and Whately Carington [Part\nIt will be seen that six subjects out of eight score below expectation\nwhen trying for low faces, while the same proportion score high when\ntrying for high faces.\nIf we square and sum the totals for the different subjects (using the\nwhole number values) and subtract 91-\/8 = 1035-125, we obtain 16,491-875\nas the sum of squares of deviations from the mean. Dividing this by the\ntheoretical variance per subject (14,400 throws) of 2000, which is accurate\nenough for this purpose, we obtain 8-246 as a X~ with 7 d.f. representing\nthe extent to which subjects differ between themselves. This is negligible\nwith P about -3, from which we conclude that these subjects do not differ\nsufficiently between themselves in their over-all performance, for the\ndifference to be shown significant in this number of trials. Corresponding\nvalues of for the Low and High figures separately are, respectively,\n6-566 with P about -5 and 7-809 with P about -4. This confirms the\nconclusion reached by inspection that subjects do not differ except by\nchance in the contributions they make to either the low or high halves of\nthe leading diagonal.\nSubjects equally show no individual preferences for throwing certain\nfaces rather than others.

But all results\nhave been null, and there is nothing to be gained by going into details\nhere. Besides, one would in any event be naturally and properly some-\nwhat suspicious of results not admitting of relatively straightforward\ninterpretation, and obtained only by elaborate squeezings of the material,\nif they were not supported by others of a simpler type.\nWe may, however, notice the absence of any Quarter Page effect of the\nkind discovered by Rhine. The distribution of hits in the four quarters\n\f173] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwing 175\nof the scoring sheet (Upper Left, Upper Right, Lower Left, Lower\nRight) are shown in the fourfold table below :\n^\nLeft Right\nUpper - 4795 4883 9678\nLower - 4798 4815 9613\nTotal - 9593 9698 1 929\n1\nThe value of X\"^ is -259 with P about -51, which is quite insignificant ;\nand so is the sum of the corresponding XH for the eight subjects taken\nseparately, which comes to 6-oio with 8 d.f. and P about -6. The method\nis only rough, but sufficient in the circumstances.\nWhen we attempt to assess the work as a whole, I think we should,\nas a matter of strictness, set aside the chosen face trials for the reasons\nalready given, and regard J. F. N.'s remarkable performance in throwing\nthrees as in the nature of collateral though strong suppbrting evidence.\nRestricting ourselves thus to the witnessed routine trials, there are three\nmain features which seem to me to be worth noting.\nFirst, there is the fact that of the six main divisions of the work\n\u2014\nviz.\nTwo Dice, Crown and Anchor Die, Six complete sets with Die 2, Odd-\nments with Die 2, Four complete sets with Die 4, and the Block of 1 15,200\nthrows just considered, all show a positive result. So, indeed, does the\nhalf set with Die 3, but this is so small and the result so feeble that it seems\nhardly decent to count it. The probability of obtaining six positive results\nis only i in 32, as already noted.\nSecond, there is the similar fact that all six cells of the leading diagonal\nof Table 4 show positive deviations.\nAnd, third, there is the curious but quite significant contrast between\nthe low and high scores for the big Block of Group 4. I admit that I\nshould feel happier about this if I could think of some plausible and straight-\nforward explanation of it ; but perhaps this would be too much to hope\nfor in the present state of our ignorance, and I think there can be no doubt\nthat the effect is perfectly genuine.\nNo doubt it would be possible, though not very easy, to devise some\nplan for combining these three probabilities with due regard to the\ndiscounting appropriate to the contexts in which they occur ; but I think\nthat this would be definitely artificial, and very possibly misleading.\nFrom the common-sense point of view\u2014and common sense has a place\neven in statistical work, current beliefs and practices notwithstanding\u2014\nI\nthink a reasonable conclusion is this : That if this work stood alone, it\nwould not be sufficient to warrant the acceptance of so revolutionary an\nhypothesis as that of psychokinesis ; but that, in the light of the work\nreported by Rhine (and on a smaller scale by others) it may be regarded as\nhighly probable that J. F. N.'s subjects were in fact exerting, sometimes\nand in relatively low degree, some sort of influence on the fall of the die,\nthough this influence was erratic and uncontrolled, so that it did not in\ngeneral produce quite the effects desired.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nPART 174\nTHE PSI PROCESSES IN NORMAL AND \" PARANORMAL \"\nPSYCHOLOGY\nR. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner\nIt is perhaps desirable that we should begin by trying to make clear the\nobject of the present paper. Thinking about the accumulated results of\npsychical research is rather like playing with the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle.\nThere is a great deal there but it does not seem to fit together ; still less do\nthe bits seem to fit into the already largely completed pattern of scientific\npsychology, physiology, etc. spread out on the table beside it. That the\nfacts of psychical research are really odd bits which do not fit in anywhere\nis possible, but it is a possibility which we are unwilling to accept until we\nare forced to. So we must try to make a pattern of them somehow. If two\nor three pieces seem to belong together we must fit them together and see\nhow it goes. There is nothing final about this ; a promising start may turn\nout wrong and the bits must be torn apart again. Nor must we regard as\nfinal the patterns of the part of the jig-saw already on the table ; failure to\nfit our pieces in may be, due to mistakes in the already completed part of the\npattern ; we must be ready to consider the possibility also that this may\nneed altering.\nWe may succeed in fitting some bits together without seeing how the\nresulting groups themselves fit together. We may have managed to get\nright in some parts and wrong in others. It would have been better and\nmore satisfactory to have been able to present a complete and perfect\npattern without inconsistencies or untidy edges, but this may have to be\nleft to our grandchildren. In the meantime, we must be content if we can\nfit some bits together and get some indication of what kind of pattern it is.\nThat is the object of the present paper. We have made some hypotheses\nwhich seem to us to fit together some of the facts of psychical research and\nwhich also seem to make it possible to fit them into the pattern of the more\northodox sciences of psychology and physiology although not without\nsome change in the existing pattern of these. We make no claim to have\nproved the truth of the hypotheses we have put forward ; rather we have\ntried to suggest grounds for supposing that they are not altogether wrong.\nIt seems to us that we have some inkling of the kind of shape the pattern is\ngoing to take. We may not succeed in expressing this sufficiently clearly\nto create conviction or even understanding. We may be wrong ; whether\nor not this is so will be known by the extent to which our suggestions prove\nfruitful for future research and for future advances in theoretical under-\nstanding. If our hypotheses are unfruitful they will be forgotten. It will\nM 177\n\f178 R. H. Thoidess and B. P. IViesiicr [Part\nstill have been worth while to have made the attempt ; our failure may\nhelp others to explore more profitable lines of advance.\nThe nature of our aim will, we hope, be sufficient explanation of why we\nhave considered aspects of psychical research other than those whose\nreality is generally regarded as sufficiently established by laboratory ex-\nperiment. If the most rigid criteria of evidence are required before an\nalleged fact in psychical research can be considered as unquestionably\nestablished, there is no reason for requiring equal weight of evidence\nbefore we can allow ourselves to consider how that alleged fact would fit\ninto the general pattern. In trying to fit our jig-saw together it is necessary\nsometimes to try to fit. in bits which may not belong to the pattern at all.\nSo we have considered not only such respectable parapsychological facts\nas \" extra-sensory perception \" and \" psycho-kinesis \" but also materialisa-\ntions and faith healing. Clearly it would be of no interest to consider such\nthings unless there were considerable grounds for believing in their\ngenuineness, but it would be absurd to refuse to consider them because\nnot all psychical researchers are yet convinced of their reality.\nLet us begin by considering in the most general terms the facts referred\nto by such terms as \" extra-sensory perception \", \" paranormal cognition \",\n\" precognition \", etc. Normal perception can be expressed behaviouristi-\ncally {i.e. in terms of what can be observed by an outside observer) by say-\ning that an organism makes some response which is adapted to some feature\nof the external environment, this adaptation being produced by a process\nin the organism's sensory nervous system initiated by some stimulus from\nthe environment. E.S.P. can be similarly expressed as the fact that an\norganism makes some reponse which is adapted to some feature of the ex-\nternal environment although there has been no sensory process in the\norganism initiated by a stimulus from that feature of the environment. If\nthe organism in question is that of a human being, we may supplement this\nbehaviouristic knowledge and discover whether or not he was aware of that\nfeature in the environment to which his behaviour showed adaptation. We\nfind generally but not always that his adaptation of behaviour to environ-\nmental situation was accompanied by awareness in normal perception, and\ngenerally but not always that it was not so accompanied in extra-sensory\nperception. In both cases, the fact of correspondence between behaviour\nand environment may be regarded as the essential one ; awareness of the\nfeature of the environment causing the adaptation of behaviour as an un-\nessential one. In ordinary speech, we might express the fact that the be-\nhaviour of an organism showed adaptation to certain features of its en-\nvironment by saying that it behaved \"as if it were aware \" of those\nelements of its environment. The fact of the organism behaving as if it\nknew a certain range of facts about the environment can be expressed by\nsaying that that part of the environment is \" projected \" on to the be-\nhavioural system of the organism. [2] The sum total of these projections\nat any one time is what Koffka has called the \" behavioural environment\n\"\nof the organism [20].\nIn such an experiment as card guessing, what is observed is the fact of\ncorrespondence between environment and reaction. We find, for example,\nthat the subject says \" cross \" when the cross turns up, that is, a piece of\nhis behaviour appears to be determined by a fact of the external world.\n\f174] The Psi Processes in Xormul and \" Paranormal \" Psychology 179\nWe do not necessarily or even commonly also find that he is aware of that\nprojected fact ; he generally does not know whether he gives a correct\nresponse or not. It is, therefore somewhat misleading to use such a term\nas \" paranormal cognition \", since \" cognition \" would seem to imply\nmore than mere correspondence between behaviour and fact. It implies\nalso an awareness of the fact, and such awareness may or may not be present.\nIn order to avoid the misleading implications of such terms, we have\npreferred to adopt the symbol T (psi) which, to begin with, has no im-\nplications except that all that it is used to cover are supposed to be pro-\ncesses not essentially different from one another. The term W was\noriginally used by us to cover such processes as telepathy, clairvoyance,\nprecognition, etc. One reason for adopting this single symbol for a number\nof processes that had previously been known by different names was to\nsuggest that these were not essentially different processes only united by\nthe fact that they were \" paranormal \" (i.e. inexplicable on current theories\nof the psychology of cognition) but that they might be different aspects of a\nsingle process in which the organism was guided by environmental events\nnot known by ordinary perceptual processes. The different names for\n\" paranormal \" cognitive processes were regarded by us not as indicating\nessentially different processes but as distinguishing different situations in\nwhich the one process might be manifested\n\u2014\ne.g. presence or absence of\nknowledge in some other person's mind of what is cognised, and present\nor future happening of the event cognised. After the publication of the\nNorth Carolina work on psycho-kinesis [i] we extended our use of the\nterm W to include this also and we distinguished the motor aspect of !F\n(P.K.) from its cognitive aspect (E.S.P.) [2]. This extension, of course,\nalso implies the hypothesis that P.K. and E.S.P. may not be essentially\ndifferent processes but different aspects of one process. Professor Rhine\nhas now expressed acceptance of this hypothesis [14].\nIt seems convenient to make a further modification in this terminology\nwhich will both bring E.S.P. and P.K. under one generic term and also\ndistinguish them as different kinds of process of the same general class.\nWe, therefore, propose to use the symbol (psi-gamma) for the cognitive\npsi process (extra-sensory perception or paranormal cognition) and Wk\n(psi-kappa) for the motor psi process (or psycho-kinesis).\nBoth IFy and are generally regarded as abnormal processes found to\na marked extent in only a few people and perhaps to a negligibly small ex-\ntent in a larger number of people. This is obviously true of E.S.P. and\nP.K. We wish to suggest, however, that these are merely unusual forms of\nprocesses which are themselves usual and commonplace, and that in their\nusual and commonplace form, they are to be found as elements in the nor-\nmal processes of perception and motor activity.\nIn normal sensory perception, there is complete material causal con-\ntinuity from the light waves or other form of energy passing from the\nobject to the sense-organ of the organism, through the physical and\nchemical processes m the sense-organ and the electro-chemical field\nprocesses of the conducting system of neurons, to the resulting excitation\nin the sensory part of the cerebral cortex. But here there is something\nwhich appears to be other than a new link in a chain of material events :\nthe production by a material process in the cerebral cortex of a conscious\n\fi8o ' R. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner [Part\nmental event. The same situation arises on the motor side where material\ncausal continuity is complete except for the translation of the conscious\nmental event of volition into the material changes in the motor area of the\ncerebral cortex which are the material cause of a willed action.\nThe hypothesis we wish to suggest is that, i7i normal thinking and per-\nceiving I am in the same sort of relation to what is going on in the sensory part\nof my brain and nervous system as that of the successful clairvoyant to some\nexternal event, and that this relation is established by the same means {i.e.\nby \"Fy).\nIt would be simpler but obviously incorrect to try to express this by\nsaying :\n\" In ordinary thinking and perceiving, I know what is going on\nin my brain and nervous system by the same means as that by which the\nsuccessful clairvoyant knows some external event.\" This will not do be-\ncause in ordinary thinking and perceiving, I obviously do not know what\nis going on in my brain and nervous system. When I perceive an external\nevent,-I do not perceive any physico-chemical processes that may be taking\nplace in my brain. Yet these form one of the causal links in the total pro-\ncess of perception ; in the linked chain of causes between the external\nevent and the perception of that event, the physico-chemical processes of\nthe brain are generally considered to be the immediate causal ancestors of\nthe mental event of perception.\nThat the relation between me and the physico-chemical processes in my\nbrain is not that of knowing may appear at first sight to be a difi^erence\nbetween this relation and that of the successful clairvoyant to the external\nevent since we are inclined to say that the clairvoyant knows the external\nevent. This, however, is to allow oneself to be misled by the implications\nof the commonly used term \" paranormal cognition \". What we discover\nin a successful experiment in clairvoyance is, as has already been pointed\nout, not that the clairvoyant knows an external event but that some verbal\nor other behaviour response of his corresponds to the external event. He\nis, for example, guessing through a Zener pack. When the card turned up is\na rectangle, he says \" rectangle \" or points to the pile of cards with a rect-\nangle displayed above it. In spontaneous cases also, the immediately\nobservable fact is a correspondence between his behaviour and some ex-\nternal event. The external event seems to be a causal ancestor of his re-\naction without the usual intermediate links of stimulus and stimulation of\nthe sense organ. Whether it is the immediate causal ancestor of the re-\nsponse or whether there is here too a projection of the external event on\nthe sensory parts of the brain, is a question on which we cannot, of course,\nhave any direct evidence. We are assuming that there is no such brain\nprocess in clairvoyance and* that the relation of the percipient to the ex-\nternal event is the same as that of the percipient to his brain processes in\nnormal (sensory) perception.\nWe are hampered in the attempt to express this idea clearly by the fact\nthat we have no word in ordinary speech to express the relation between\nme and my brain processes in normal perception. We have the word\n\" cognition \" for the relation between me and the external event, but it\nwould obviously be an error to use this word for the relation between me\nand the corresponding brain processes. Let us then call this the y relation.\nSince it is not always convenient to use a technical vocabulary, we can ex-\n\f174] The Psi Processes in Normal and \" Paranormal \" Psychology 181\npress the same idea in more ordinary speech by saying that in ordinary\nperception I am informed of the external event by the perceptual brain\nprocesses.\nWe suggest also that there is a similar identity of relation in normal\nmotor control of the body on the one hand and the \" paranormal \" process\nof psycho-kinesis on the other. Our second hypothesis is : \/ control the\nactivity of my nervous system [and so indirectly control such activities as the\nmovements of my body and the course of yny thinking) by the same means as\nthat by which the successful psycho-kinetic subject controls the fall of the dice\nor other object [i.e. by Wk).\nHere also we may note that, just as the activity of the nervous system is\nnot itself cognised in normal perception, so also in normal bodily activity\nthe brain processes leading to action are not themselves willed. We will\nto move our arm, not to initiate the physico-chemical processes in the motor\narea of the brain which start the arm movement. In this case no difficulty\nis created for the verbal formulation of the hypothesis since the phrase \" I\ncontrol \" used of my relation to the activity of the nervous system is not\nlikely to be misunderstood as implying that these are directly the objects\nof volition.\nThe experimental investigation of psycho-kinesis has so far been con-\nfined to studying its effects on relatively large bodies and not on systems of\nthe order of size of a body cell. The primary reason for this limitation has\nno doubt been the practical one of the great difficulty of eliminating dis-\nturbing factors in studying effects on such small systems. If, however, the\neffect exists, it is reasonable to suppose that the ideal mechanism for study-\ning it would be one in which very minute forces could start processes in\nsystems of small size, which processes could act as triggers for subsequent\nprocesses involving sufficiently large forces to be easily observable. If\nindeed a physicist could construct for us a mechanism in which there\nwere delicately balanced systems of very small size, which balance could\nbe upset by small forces yet was protected from being upset by small\nforces accidentally impinging from outside, and if, moreover, any change in\nth-ese small systems could be automatically magnified to a large energy\nchange in some larger system, then we might hope to have the ideal\nmechanism for the experimental demonstration of psycho-kinesis. We\nhave not succeeded in devising such a mechanism for our laboratories.\nWe suggest that the brain is such a mechanism : that in its motor aspect\nit is a mechanism perfected by evolution not only for distributing impulses\nreceived from the sensory system but also for translating by Wk my in-\ntentions and volitions into action.\nWe have so far used the term \" I \" in order to defer decision as to what\ngeneral term shall be used to cover \" I \", \" you \" and \" he \" in the same\nsense. Interactionists have very often spoken of the \" mind \" controlling\nthe body, but this word will not do for our purpose. The word \" mind\n\"\nis not now most generally used for that which thinks and decides but rather\nfor the whole system of thoughts, memories, decisions, etc. Moreover, the\ncommon use of the phrases \" my mind \", \" your mind \", etc., implies that\nthe word mind is used in some other sense than that of \" me \" and \" you \".\nThe second objection applies equally to \" self \" as the general term for the\n\" I \" in the formulation of our hypothesis. The word which best expresses\n\fl82 R. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner [Part\nour meaning is undoubtedly \" soul \", and our hypothesis could be ex-\npressed as that the soul is in cognitive relation with what goes on in the\nsensory part of the nervous system by Wy and controls the motor part of\nthe nervous system by Wk.\nThe main objection to the use of \" soul \" in this connection is that this\nterm also has an already existing connotation and that some part of this\nconnotation may not be what is required for the present purpose. It\nseems better, therefore, as in the case of W, to use a mere symbol whose\nconnotation will be supplied subsequently by the observed facts.\nWe have used the Greek alphabet to supply symbols for the processes\nof parapsychology. Since, however, we are now dealing with something of\na different order, a postulated entity and not a process, it seems convenient\nto mark this difference by using a symbol drawn from another alphabet,\nand we suggest for this purpose the Hebrew letter ^ (Shin). The state-\nment, therefore, that Shin is in relation with the sensory part of the brain\nand nervous system by means of Wy and that Shin controls by Wk the\nmotor part of the nervous system, is the generalised form of the suggestion\nalready made that I am in relation with the sensory part of my brain and\nnervous system by means of Wy, etc.\nWhat is suggested may be expressed in other words. We suppose that\nwhat is unusual about extra-sensory perception and psycho-kinesis is not\nFig. I\nthat they are processes abnormal in themselves, but that they are exo-\nsomatic forms of processes which are normally endo-somatic.\n\f174] The Psi Processes in Normal and \" Paranorrnal \" Psychology 183\nThe supposed relationship of perceptual awareness with clairvoyance\nand of volition with psycho-kinesis can perhaps be made more clear by\nmeans of a diagram (Fig. i). The upper circle represents JJ' i.e. Shin\n(that which perceives and wills). The central oblong represents the ner-\nvous system which is divided by a line in the middle into the motor part of\nthe nervous system (M.N.S.) and the sensory part of the nervous system\n(S.N.S.). The circle below represents the external object which is being\nperceived or acted upon. The object sends light waves or other sensory\nstimuli which act on the sensory part of the nervous system. These are\nrepresented by the right hand half of the area between Object and Nervous\nSystem, while the left hand half of this area represents muscular action or\nother physical means by which the organism acts on the object. The\nareas which connect Shin with M.N.S. and S.N.S. represent respectively\nthe postulated normal processes of Wk and Wy by which we suppose Shin\nto control the activity of the motor part of the nervous system and to be\ninformed by processes in the sensory part of the nervous system. The\nparts of the and Wy areas which pass outside the area representing\nthe nervous system and directly connect the circles representing Shin and\nthe object, represent the postulated \" paranormal \" processes of psycho-\nkinesis and extra-sensory perception by means of which we suppose that\ndirect relations are established between Shin and the object without the\nintervention of the nervous system.\nWhile the diagram shows (for the sake of simplicity) only the postulated\nShin activity of one individual, we do not mean to imply that, in an experi-\nmental situation in which an experimental subject is showing successful\nparanormal cognition or psycho-kinesis, the situation is adequately repre-\nsented in such a simple manner. The experimenter may also be paranor-\nmally cognising the object or influencing it by fk, and there may be tele-\npathic interaction in either or both directions between Shin and nervous\nsystem of the kinds shown in later diagrams.\nOne reason for preferring to use the symbol ^ rather than the word\n\" soul \" for that which is postulated to be in cognitive relationship with\nthe organism and in motor control of it, is in order that we may not, by our\nchoice of a name, prejudge any empirical questions which may later arise\nin connection with it. We are trying not to imply any opinion as to whether\nShin ceases to exist at the time of death, whether if it survives death it is\nor is not still associated with an organism of some kind, whether it is\npeculiar to human organisms, whether it is simple or structured, change-\nless or changeable, separate or part of a larger whole. These questions are,\nno doubt, important and will go on being discussed. For us to express any\nopinion on them now would be, from the point of view of the present paper,\nan irrelevancy.\nNo doubt, the use of the term \" Shin \", like the use of \" psi \" does also\nimply a theory. As the use of \" psi \" implies that \" telepathy \", \" clair-\nvoyance \", \" precognition \", etc. are all names for the same process occur-\nring in different situations, so the use of the term \" Shin \" implies the\nrejection of the generally accepted view of the mind-body problem of the\northodox biologist, psychologist, and physiologist. This is the view that\nconsciousness is \" how the organism experiences the [i.e. its own] brain\nhappenings \" [18]. Rejecting the idea of a conscious being as \" a '\nsoul\n'\nI\n\fR. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner [Part\nimprisoned in a '\nbody ' \" [i8] it regards a conscious being as \" on the\ncontrary, a portion of the stuff of reahty organised so that it is intensely\nconscious \" [i8]. To all those who have been trained in the orthodox\nschools of biological psychology and physiology, any kind of soul theory is\nrepugnant as a backward step in thought. It does not, however, appear\nlikely that the current orthodoxy of biological psychology and physiology\ncan assimilate the facts of psychical research without drastic reconstruction\nof its mind-body theory. It seems, therefore, to be an adventure in thought\nworth taking to discard our prejudice against soul theories and to consider\nwhether the adoption of a theory of this type may not be the step necessary\nto make it possible to fit into the same theoretical framework the \" normal\n\"\nfacts of scientific psychology and physiology and those \" paranormal\n\"\nfacts which psychical research compels us to recognise.\nThe plausibility of the hypotheses we are suggesting depends in part on\nthe extent to which \" paranormal \" Wy and Wk resemble the normal inter-\naction between Shin and nervous system in perception and motor activity\nrespectively. Let us first consider two characteristics of \" paranormal\n\"\nWy processes\u2014temporal displacement and symbolism\u2014in which it appears\nat first sight that they differ from the processes of normal perception.\nIt was found by Whately Carington [3] and subsequently confirmed by\nSoal [4] that there may be a temporal displacement in extra-sensory per-\nception, commonly taking the form of reacting to a future event when a\npresent event is the one aimed at. There is also a feature of the y relation\nof Shin with our nervous systems which may be considered to be of the\nnature of temporal displacement. We are not merely in this relation with\nwhat is happening now in our organisms but also with what has happened\nand with what is about to happen. The displacement towards the future\nis expressed by saying that we are aware not only of our present activities\nbut also of our \" intentions \". The use of this word \" intention \", how-\never, with its implication of a present process, tends to make us overlook\nthe fact that what is known is a future event of the organism. In some cases\nat any rate, the fact of intending may be more correctly expressed by saying\nthat Shin is in the Wy relationship not only with present events in the\norganism but also with those of its near future. The 7 relation of Shin with\nthe processes of the nervous system may, therefore, resemble extra-sensory\nperception in showing temporal displacement. It is also, of course,\npossible that memory may not always be (as supposed in current psychology)\nconditioned by present \" traces \" in the nervous system but may some-\ntimes be a post-cognitive f relation with past states of the nervous system\nor directly with past events themselves.\nAnother characteristic of Wy is that the cognition is not in general of the\ncharacteristics of the object cognised (as these characteristics appear to\nnormal perception) but of something which is a substitute for this object,\nthat is, some symbol of it. This symbolic character of fy is obscured in\ncard guessing experiments as ordinarily performed, since the test of success\nis exact correspondence between the guess and the object. In spontaneous\nWy phenomena however, symbolic representation is very common, e.g. in\ndreams and when psychics cognise events present or future in the form of a\nvisual symbol which needs interpretation. Although we may regard normal\nperception as in a sense representative of the external object, it is not a\n\f174] The Psi Processes in Nortnal and \" Paranormal \" Psychology 185\nrepresentation of the physico-chemical processes in the central nervous\nsystem which are its immediate causal ancestors. In a sense then the per-\ncept may be regarded as a symbol of these events as the paranormal Wy\nprocess may be a symbol of the external object or event cognised.\nThese are respects in which normal perceptual processes may be con-\nsidered to resemble the paranormal Wy processes, or, at any rate, to differ\nfrom them less than may appear at first sight. We must also consider a\nrespect in which the laws of normal perceptual and volitional processes\nseem to be in sharp contrast with those of paranormal Wy and Wk. This is\nthe curious fact, often noted by experimenters, that effort to cognise in\nE.S.P. and effort to control the die in P.K. experiments is generally in-\neffective and tends even to reduce the rate of scoring. The most effective\ncondition seems to be one in which the subject of the experiment retains a\nrelatively casual attitude towards his successes, and one of the factors\ncausing decline in successive experimentation may be that the subject be-\ngins to care too much about succeeding and intensifies his effort with con-\nsequent falling off of score. But voluntary effort to cognise and to act\nfavours successful normal cognition and effective normal action, and\n(within limits) success and effectiveness are increased as effort is intensified.\nThese facts suggest that the effect of effort may be to, direct W into the\nnormal channels of being informed through the processes of the sensory\nner\\'ous system and of control of the motor nervous system, and con-\nsequently away from the paranormal channels of direct interaction be-\ntween Shin and object.\nThe adverse effect of volitional effort of !F success is illustrated by an\nobservation made by one of us (R.H.T.) accidentally in an experiment\ndirected towards other ends. When acting as experimenter in an experiment\non telepathy, he had the task of thinking of a number from one to ten and\nthen turning up one of a pack of playing cards and adding the number on\nthe card turned up to the one already thought of. No attempt was made to\nmake the number thought of the same as the one about to be turned up ;\nwhether it was or not was irrelevant to the purpose of the experiment.\nNevertheless it happened that the number thought of was identical with\nthe one immediately afterwards turned up 10 times in 40 observations,\nwhereas the chance expectation is 4. The probability of the chance\noccurrence of a deviation from expectation as large as +6 is -0005. That\nequal success would follow an effort to guess the next card seemed im-\nprobable from the relatively low rate of scoring in previous card-guessing\nexperiments with R.H.T. as subject [5]. To make sure on this point, the\nexperiment was repeated in exactly the same way immediately afterwards\nbut now R.H.T. was trying to guess the next card. Only chance results\nwere obtained. While too much weight must not be given to a single\nobservation showing a result which was not aimed at, the odds against\nchance of 2,000 to i suggest strongly that similarly designed experiments in.\nwhich the subject does not know that the object is to look for W effects\nmight give striking results.\nThere is less evidence that intensity of volitional effort has a bad effect\non success in psycho-kinetic experiments although this is the impression\nof some experimenters in this subject. A playful attitude towards the\nexperiments rather than one of serious intensity has been reported by\n\fi86 R. H. Thoiiless and B. P. Wiesner [Part\nRhine to be most favourable to success [21]. One may be led to suppose the\nopposite by the fact that instructions to the subject are commonly that he\nshould \" will \" the dice to fall in the required ways. It must not, however,\nbe lost sight of that there seems to be no experimental evidence that this\n\" willing \" is a necessary condition for success or even a favourable con-\ndition. The intention that the dice should fall in a certain way may be all\nthat is required. It may even be that any way of drawing aftention to a\ncertain die face {e.g. by counting the number of times it fell upwards while\nignoring the others) might be sufficient to determine the P.K. reaction.\nThese are matters for experimental enquiry ; we must not assume that\n\" willing \" is the cause of the reaction merely because subjects are often\ninstructed to \" will \". Plainly the instruction does not inhibit the re-\naction ; there is no evidence that it helps it and some reason to suppose\nthat strong volitional effort is unfavourable to success in psycho-kinesis.\nIf it is the case that effort directed towards W success tends to prevent\nsuccess, this may be simply explained if we suppose that voluntary effort\ndirects the W activity to its normal channel of communication with the\nnervous system. We may note that to direct subjects in W experiments not\nto try hard is merely a negative direction. It tells them one thing not to do ;\nit does not tell them what they ought to do. If there were any way of\ngiving them a positive direction, of telling them what attitude they should\nadopt to get W success, we should have solved one of the principal ex-\nperimental difficulties in psychical research. Perhaps those subjects who\nshow consistently positive results in W experiments (the \" psychics \")\nhave solved this problem for themselves. They too seem to be unable to\ncommunicate to others the secret of their attitude. It is not to be expected\nthat they could. How could any of us convey what was the nature of\nordinary volitional effort (trying to do something in everyday life) to some-\none who did not already know how to try or make an effort. ?\nThe diagram in Fig. i represents in one part the direct knowledge of an\nexternal object or event by a \u00a5^ process. Such direct knowledge is ordin-\narily now called \" clairvoyance \" (or \" psychometry \" when the situation\nis such that the use of an intermediate object to provide linkage with what\nis cognised is a salient feature of the situation). The suggestion that this\ntakes place by the same Wy process as that by which Shin is normally in\nrelation with the processes in the cerebral cortex in ordinary perception\ndoes not imply that such clairvoyant awareness is of the nature of a sensory\nperception obtained by extra-sensctf-y means. On our hypothesis, per-\nception of an object is a mode of awareness in which the brain process is an\nessential link : without that link one has a different mode of awareness.\nThe differences to be expected between \" paranormal \" and normal\nperception are, therefore, those due to the character imposed on normal\nperception by the characteristics of brain processes and by the physical\nand psychological conditions under which normal sensory perception takes\nplace.\nFor example, what objects we see and what sounds we hear are primarily\ndetermined by such physical facts as the position of the head, the intensity\nof the stimuli, their distance, the presence or absence of screening, the fact\nthat the stimuli reach the sense organs at the particular moment and not at\nsome other time, and so forth. If these factors are determined in a parti-\n\f174] The Psi Processes in Normal and \" Paranormal \" Psychology 187\ncular way, then we must see and hear more or less what we do see and hear\nand nothing else. It is not quite true that our present perceptions are\nwholly determined by such external factors since there are also internal\nfactors referred to as \" interest \" and \" attention \" which make a selection\nfrom the potential material of perception. The whole body of potential\nperceptual material is, however, determined by the above factors and if we\nknow that a man is at a certain place at a certain time and we also know all\nthe physical conditions of his environment and of himself, then we know\nmore or less what he is perceiving.\nBut these limitations are the result of the known characters of the sense-\norgans and the perceptual processes ; if these are short-circuited in \" para-\nnormal cognition \" we cannot say what will be the limitations of the result-\ning cognitions. We have clearly no right to assume that they will be the\nsame as the limitations of sensory perceptions. Are we then to expect no\nspatial and temporal limitations of paranormal cognitions? Clearly not,\nfor this would be equivalent in practice to no paranormal cognition at all.\nIf in a card-guessing experiment, a subject's responses were equally de-\ntermined by the order of every pack of cards in the universe whether past,\npresent or future, his results would be indistinguishable from a series of\nrandom guesses. If success in such an experiment is obtained, this means\nthat somehow the subject's responses have been determined by the parti-\ncular test set of cards. We may express this by saying that this test pack\nof cards has been, by some means, \" singularised \" for the subject, just as\nthe normal perceptual field is singularised by the physical and other\nconditions of perception.\nOf the factors which may determine this singularisation we know little.\nIt appears experimentally that the intention of the experimenter or of the\nsubject that this particular pack of cards will be guessed may effect the\nnecessary singularisation. Both spontaneous cases and experimental\nresults suggest that clairvoyant singularisation may take place by a tele-\npathic impulse. In some cases singularisation takes place by the subject\nof the experiment seeing or holding an object which has been in physical\ncontact with the object or person cognised. The process of W cognition is\nthen called \" psychometry \", but there seems no reason for regarding this\nas essentially a different process from other forms of clairvoyance. The\nnecessity for some means of singularisation is present in all \u00a5^7 phenomena\nand not only in those that take place under psychometric conditions.\nAnother way in which the nature of the perceptual process determines\nthe resulting perception is in its phenomenal character. A seen objective\nfield gives a visual pattern in an anisotropic three-dimensional pheno-\nmenal space ; the music of an orchestra is perceived as a different kind of\npattern of sounds with relatively indefinite localisation. There is no reason\nfor expecting that a pure W cognition will have any of the phenomenal\ncharacters of sight, sound, or any other modality of sense which depend\non the co-operation of the sensor}' perceptual apparatus. . We know, in\nfact, that a W cognition is often received as a \" symbol \", for example, as\na visual picture not representative of the thing cognised but requiring\ninterpretation. For example, a psychic has reported that she knew that\na friend was thinking of her (the psychic's) future because \" I suddenly\nsaw a beam of golden light shoot from the head of my friend in an arch\n\fi88 R. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner [Part\nwhich passed over my head and fell beyond. I knew from its colour and\ncomposition that it was of an intellectual order. I knew it concerned me\nfrom its direction, and because the farther end of the arch fell beyond\nmy aura I instantly deduced that it was not connected with the present\nmoment\" [lo]. Although this experience was phenomenally visual, it\nwas plainly not a visual perception since what was experienced was\nnot representative of what was cognised but symbolic of it. The mind\nresponded with one of its possible ways of experiencing [i.e. the visual)\nto a mode of cognition which had no characteristic form of experience\npeculiar to it.\nIt is not, therefore, to be expected that direct Wy knowledge of an event\nor object v\/ill generally appear to consciousness as a visual perception\nrepresentative of that event or object. On the other hand, it may do so\nsince perceptual representation is also a possible symbol by means of which\nthe W cognition may be presented to consciousness. This appears to be the\ncase in what is now called \" travelling clairvoyance \" or, in the Scots\nHighlands, \" second sight \", where the subject appears to see the scene\ncognised as if it were a present visual perception. In these cases also,\nthere seems to be no reason for believing that a true visual perception of an\nextra-sensory character is taking place. Rather it appears that they should\nbe regarded as symbolic presentations of the cognised data in which the\nactual visual appearance has been utilised by the cognising mind as the\nsymbol for their presentation to consciousness.\nLet us now consider the telepathic form of W. Telepathy has been\ngenerally regarded either as a process of one brain acting on another brain\nor as a process of one immaterial mind communicating with another\nimmaterial mind {i.e. in our terminology, one Shin communicating with\nanother Shin). There is a third possibility which we would suggest as a\nmore probable explanation : that telepathy is a process of Shin acting on\nor being acted on by a nervous system other than its own.\nThe first type of explanation (that which regards telepathy as an inter-\ncommunication between one brain and another without the ordinary\nphysical means of communication through the sense organs) remains within\nthe limits of explanation by interaction of physical systems. It has, there-\nfore, the advantage of requiring no radically new departure in thought.\nIt is, however, a universally accepted postulate of science that for one\nmaterial system to act on another material system, there must be a physical\nmeans of communication. Such a theory must, therefore, require the\npostulation of some unknown form of radjation to account for telepathy.\nFor this there is no evidence, and, in view of the long distances over which\ntelepathic communication has taken place, apparently without loss of\neffectiveness with increasing distance, the assumption must be regarded\nas highly improbable if not definitely disproved.\nNo such objection can be urged against the hypothesis of one mind\nacting on another mind if the mind is regarded as an immaterial entity (or,\nin our nomenclature, one Shin acting on another Shin). If there is such a\nprocess of communication, it is of a unique kind, and nothing can be said\nof the conditions under which it would be possible. All that can, we think,\nbe legitimately said against it is that there seems no reason to postulate such\na process since we can regard telepathy more simply as an interaction be-\n\f174] The Psi Processes in Normal a>id \" Paranormal \" Psychology 189\ntween Shin and another nervous system without assuming any other pro-\ncess of communication than those already postulated to account for\nnormal perception and clairvoyance on the one hand and normal volitional\naction and psycho-kinesis on the other.\nIf we regard the W processes as the normal means by which Shin is in-\nformed by and maintains control of its own nervous system, it does not\nseem unlikely that, in some relatively unusual cases, these processes may\nenable Shin to be informed by or to control some nervous system other than\nits own. The process of telepathy would then be of essentially the same\nnature as the processes by which I am in cognitive relation with my own\nnervous system and control my own actions. It would then be neither more\nnor less mysterious than these familiar normal processes.\nFig. 2 Fig. 3\nThis type of explanation would lead to two possible kinds of telepathy\nwhich may be found in different cases.^ These two possibilities are shown\nin figures 2 and 3. In both cases, A is the agent and B the percipient.\nIn the one case, there is a cognitive process on the part of i?\u2014Shin B being\nin cognitive relation by with the processes in ^'s nervous system (Fig.\n2). In the other, there is a motor process in B initiated by Shin A\u2014\nShin A influencing the motor part of 5's nervous system by *F\/c (Fig. 3).\nWe may conveniently refer to these two kinds of telepathic process as\ny-telepathy and \/c-telepathy respectively.\nIf telepathy is sometimes a process of the type we have called y-telepathy\n^ As has also been suggested by Driesch [13] who distinguishes between \" thought-\nreading \" (y-telepathy) and \" telepathy \" (x-telepathy).\n\f190 R. H. Thoiiless and B. P. Wiesner [Part\nwe have an explanation of the fact, observed frequently from the earliest\ndays of psychical research, that a percipient {e.g. a medium) may report\nsome memory of the agent of which the agent is not himself at the time\nthinking. That is, the percipient seems to be tapping directly the nervous\nsystem of the agent and not his consciousness ; he is able to become aware\nof latent memories of the agent just as the agent himself might become aware\nof them. This, we think, is an argument for regarding the process repre-\nsented by Fig. 2 as an essential part in such telepathic situations.\nFig. 3, on the other hand, seems to represent the type of thought\ntransference aimed at in such an activity as the \" willing game \" in which\nan action determined by A is carried out by B. It may also be the type of\ntelepathy involved in cases of spontaneous telepathy where a crisis in the\nlife of A seems to be a determining cause of a telepathic experiences of B.\nThis may not be Shin B becoming aware by of what is happening in\nthe nervous system of A. It seems more likely that A is the active one,\nand that he is affecting the thought of B by action on the brain pro-\ncesses of 5. In other words, this seems more easily explained as k-\ntelepathy.\nIn the experimental situation in which A turns up a card and B responds\nwith the name of that card, either type of process may be taking place.\nAs has been pointed out by Rhine [6], this experimental situation also does\nnot exclude the process commonly called clairvoyance which is represented\nin Fig. I, i.e. direct cognition by Shin B of the object by means of Wy.\nThe latter possibility may, however, be excluded by a suitably devised\nexperiment in which there is no external object to be cognised [7]. It does\nnot seem to be possible at present to devise an experimental situation which\nwould discriminate between processes of y- and \/c-telepathy.\nWe can, however, examine the nature of telepathic situations in order to\nobtain light on which of these processes is involved. It has already been\nargued that the fact that, in some cases, B may report a memory of A of\nwhich A is not at the time aware, is evidence that, in those cases, there is a\nprocess of y-telepathy. Similarly, we may consider the well-known fact\nthat, in card-guessing experiments, the subject may give right answers in\nexcess of chance expectation without knowing which of his answers is right\nand which wrong. This makes it unlikely that his response is a cognitive\none (y-telepathy) and indicates strongly that it is a motor response directed\nby the Wk of the agent, i.e. that it is K-telepathy.\nIndications of the same kind are found in the experiments on repro-\nductions of drawings found in the first volume of our Proceedings [8].\nOn p. 191, for example, there is the drawing of a bird reproduced as a\ngeometrical figure with remarkably similar outline but without any idea\nthat a bird was the object represented. A cognitive process by the per-\ncipient could not have failed to get the central fact in the agents' awareness\nthat a bird had been drawn unless it had failed altogether to hit on the\nobject. This reproduction must be regarded, therefore, as probably\ntelepathy of the k type in which Shin (agent) influenced the motor nervous\nsystem of the percipient to draw the required outline.\nThe evidence seems, therefore, to suggest that both processes of y- and\nof \/f-telepathy may be present in telepathic phenomena, possibly one or\nother being dominant in different situations.\n\f174] Processes in Xormal and \" Parunni nial \" Psvrhologv 191\nAnother direction in which we may find evidence of action of one\nShin on another organism is in some, at any rate, of the phenomena of\nhypnotism. Since the time of Liebault, it has become customary to regard\nhypnotism as entirely an effect of \" suggestion \", as the response of the\nhypnotised person to verbal or other signals given by the hypnotiser and\nperceived by the hypnotised person through normal sensory channels.\nThis explanation cannot, however be held to cover all the phenomena of\nhypnotism unless we ignore some well attested results of the investigation\nof hypnotism as, for example, the induction of hypnotism by the volition\nof the hypnotiser without perceptible signals and at a distance even of half\na mile [17].\nLet us now turn to a very different aspect of that found in the\nphenomena of materialisation. We have no personal experience of these\nand we know that there is controversy as to their reality. There seems,\nhowever, to be sufficient evidence that materialisation phenomena some-\ntimes take place. Much of the evidence is dubious and much is probably\nfraudulent, but all that is necessary to support this conclusion is that at\nleast one materialisation should have taken place under conditions pre-\ncluding fraud. There are probably more than one observation fulfilling\nthese conditions, but the observation of a hand-like protrusion observed\nduring a seance with Rudi Schneider on Dec. 23rd 1929 is sufficient to\nestablish the fact that such things can happen when the possibility of fraud\nis excluded [9].^\nThe phenomena described are of some material or quasi-material sub-\nstance apparently derived from the medium's body on which forms of\nhands, faces, etc. are imposed. The principle we have adopted before in\ntrying to understand Wy and processes is that of supposing that they\nalso occur normally, as relations of ^ to the organism. Their paranormal\noccurrence we have regarded as cases in which the processes are no longer\nlimited to the organism. In other words, we have supposed that any Shin\nrelation to the organism is a special case of a Wprocess. To try to explain a W\nprocess we consider whether there is a known Shin relation to the organ-\nism which may be a special case of it.\nApplying this method of thought to the phenomena of materialisation,\nwe are led to consider that this may be the more general process of which\nthe normal processes of bodily growth and regeneration are a special case.\nIn other words, materialisation phenomena may be regarded as relatively\nunfamiliar examples of the process whose normal and familiar form is to\nbe found in the growth of the organism or the healing of a wound. The\ntheory that growth and regeneration are processes of Shin acting on the\norganism is, of course, Driesch's theory of the entelechy. This theory has\nbeen generally rejected by physiologists and biologists who have pre-\nferred to regard growth and regeneration as processes entirely determined\nin a material manner by physico-chemical forces within the organism\nitself. The occurrence of exo-somatic form-producing activities {i.e.\nmaterialisations) suggests the possibility that this orthodox materialist\nview of growth and regeneration may not be a complete account of the\nmatter.\n^ Or the more extensive evidence of the wax moulds obtained by Geley from\nmaterialisations produced by Franek Kluski [19].\n\f192 R. H. Thoidess and B. P. Wiesner [Part\nIt is possible that the form-producing activity of Shin should be re-\ngarded as the same process as Wk. Provisionally, however, we prefer to\ntreat it as a separate W process and to label it 'Fe (psi-epsilon).\nWe have already considered the possibility that some cases of telepathy\nare examples of Shin A acting by Wk on the motor nervous system of B.\nThere is a parallel possibility that Shin A may act by fe on the structures\nof the organism of 5. Thus the organic injury of B might be repaired by\nprocesses initiated by the activity of Shin A. That this can take place is,\nof course, claimed by many people with high W capacities ; it is the pro-\ncess commonly known as \" psychic healing \". It has become usual for\nscientific psychology to dismiss all psychic healing as the healing of func-\ntional disorders by means of suggestion. That is, it is regarded as an action\nby the healer through normal sensory means on the nervous system of the\nhealed person and the removal from the patient of symptoms which have been\ncreated by his own thought, that is, by the activity of his own nervous system.\nThe opinion that psychic healing is merely the cure by suggestion of\nfunctional disorders is not, however, accepted by religious or other psychic\nhealers and there is some reason for doubting whether it can be supported\nwithout some arbitrary selection of the evidence. The hypothesis here\noutlined would explain psychic healing in a way different from that of the\nsuggestion theory, as the action of one Shin facilitating a healing process\nin the organism of another. In other words, it would be a healing process\nof the same kind as that normally taking place in the body under the\ntrophic influence of the central or autonomic nervous systems except that\nthe direction of the process would be from outside instead of from inside\nthe individual. This hypothesis does not, of course, imply an unlimited\npower of psychic healing but it does imply different limits from those of\nhealing by suggestion.\nFirst, healing by suggestion is limited to cases where the patient is aware\nby normal sensory means (generally by hearing) of the healing suggestions\nmade ; it cannot succeed if the patient is unconscious or is unaware of\nwhat the person making the suggestions is doing. There is no reason for\nexpecting psychic healing to be limited in this way if it is a We. activity\nfrom another Shin. It might well be successful when the patient was not\naware of the healer's intentions or even when he was unconscious.\nSecondly, healing by suggestion is generally supposed to be limited to\ndisorders of a psycho-neurotic type, i.e. those caused by the thought,\nexpectation, or unconscious volition of the patient. On our hypothesis,\npsychic healing should not be expected to be limited in this way. The\nlimitation to be expected is that psychic healing would be limited to pro-\ncesses in another organism which are, in one's own organism, under Shin\ncontrol\n\u2014\ni.e. not irreversible degenerative processes or injuries but those\nwhich under favourable conditions may heal spontaneously. The union\nof a broken bone might, for example, be accelerated by psychic healing,\nbut it could not be expected to have any influence on a lesion of the brain\nsince there are no true regenerative processes in injured brain tissue.\nA further limitation to be expected in psychic healing is that it is likely\nto be dependent on the healed person being in some way picked out or\n\" singularised \" by the healer. In practice, this singularisation is generally\neffected by the healer placing his hands on the person to be healed, but it is\n\f174] The Psi Processes in Normal and \" Paranormal \" Psychology 193\nalso claimed by some psychic healers that merely thinking of the person to\nbe healed is sufficient.\nWhat has been said above about Shin influence in regenerative or forma-\ntive bodily processes may be supposed also to apply to degenerative pro-\ncesses initiated by Shin, such as the formation of stigmata. It is possible\nthat these also might be produced in one organism by the We activity of\nanother Shin. We should then have a \" paranormal \" production of\ndegenerative processes such as has been attributed in the past to certain\npractices of black magic. Of such We efi^ects (except for minor lesions),\nwe know of no contemporary evidence, *although, if the possibility of\npsychic healing is admitted, there seems no reason for regarding a parallel\nproduction of degenerative eff^ects as impossible. It does not, however,\nseem necessary to discuss these further since the theoretical problems\ninvolved would not differ from those of regenerative processes.\nTo summarise the views here put forward. We have suggested parallel\nhypotheses relating : (a) paranormal cognition with normal perception,\n(b) psycho-kinesis with normal volitional activity, and (c) materialisation\nand psychic healing with normal growth and regeneration. In each case\nwe have supposed that these are processes depending on a non-material\nentity which we have indicated by the symbol ^ (Shin). The functions of\nShin involved we have labelled Wy, Wk, and We respectively. We have\npostulated that these normally relate Shin with its own bodily organism\n[i.e. that normally they are endo-somatic) but that also they occur excep-\ntionally in their \" paranormal \" forms acting exo-somatically.\nIt is obvious that these three hypotheses are logically not mutually de-\npendent ; the truth of any of them does not entail the truth of any of the\nothers. The relation between them is that all suggest the same general\nform of explanation. In each case we are trying to fit the pieces of the jig-\nsaw together in the same way, the way suggested by the very plausible idea\nthat perhaps the paranormal processes are not as odd as at first sight they\nappear but are familiar processes occurring in unusual circumstances. In\neach case, we have supposed that the \" normal \" process is a special case\nof the more general process which includes the \" paranormal \" form of the\nprocess, just as, for example, plane geometry is a special case of the more\ngeneral propositions of solid geometry, or as the Newtonian laws of motion\nare a special case of relativity laws of motion.\nThis view obviously implies that E.S.P. and P.K. are closely related\nprocesses, both being, as it were, occasional discharges into the outside\nworld of processes normally taking place between Shin and the nervous\nsystem. The implied relationship has in its favour the evidence of parallel-\nism between these two classes of phenomena. Thus Rhine speaks of : \"a\nlarge accumulation of experimental evidence which has given us much the\nsame picture of the conditions affecting performance in P.K. tests as it has\nfor success in E.S.P. experiments. Psychological, physiological, and social\ninfluences have had similar effects upon both types of ability. Position\neffects are much alike for both, and both are essentially unconscious\nfunctions. The general experimental results have thus made it easy for the\nlogical interrelation represented by a common name to find acceptance\n\"\n[14]. To a common name we now suggest the addition of a common\nhypothesis of origin. ', .\n\f194 ^- H. Thoiiless and B. P. Wiesner [Part\nThe suggested relationship between clairvoyance and telepathy is closer\nsince our suggestion implies that one form of telepathy (y-telepathy) is\nidentical with clairvoyance, except for the difference that the Wy process is\ndirected towards the nervous system of another person in the one case and\ntowards some other external object in the other.\nIf this suggestion be true, it explains the early observation of Rhine that\nthose subjects who were good in telepathy tests were also good in clair-\nvoyance tests to about the same degree [15]. It is true that what he then\ncalled \" telepathy \" and \" clairvoyance \" tests would not now be regarded\nas satisfactory tests for pure telepathy and pure clairvoyance since the\n\" telepathy \" tests did not exclude the possibility of precognitive clair-\nvoyance and the \" clairvoyance \" tests did not exclude the possibility of\nprecognitive telepathy. On the other h^nd, the telepathy tests did exclude\nthe possibility of straight {i.e. present time) clairvoyance and the clair-\nvoyance tests excluded straight telepathy. The fact that these two\nexclusions did not have any apparent differential effect on subjects' per-\nformances strongly suggests that, if the two conditions excluded were\neffective at all in favouring successful results (which later successes\nunder \" pure clairvoyance \" conditions make it impossible to doubt),\nthen they must have been about equally effective in producing suc-\ncessful results. This suggests that the processes involved under these\ntwo conditions were essentially the same, as is supposed by our hypo-\nthesis.\nIt should be apparent that there is nothing novel in the suggestion that\nthere is some entity which controls the organism in volition and which is\ninformed by the organism in perceptual processes. This was universally\nbelieved until comparatively recent times when the idea of a soul or self\nwas discarded by the physiologists and experimental psychologists, and all\nmental processes, including those of volition and cognition, came to be\nregarded as merely aspects of the material processes of the organism.\nIndeed, so late as the middle of the nineteenth century, Braid could write :\n\" I look upon the brain simply as the organ of the mind \" and could equate\nthe relation of the \" soul and the bodily organs \" to that of the musician\nto his musical instrument [11]. This way of thinking, which sounds old-\nfashioned to those whose minds are attuned to current psychological and\nphysiological conceptions, was the scientific orthodoxy of a century ago.\nIn this matter, we are only suggesting a return to a way of thinking which\nwas at one time generally accepted.\nThere is no such venerable ancestry for the other part of our hypothesis\nthat extra-sensory perception, psycho-kinesis, and materialisation are exo-\nsomatic examples of processes familiar to us in their endo-somatic forms\nas normal perception, normal volition, and normal growth processes re-\nspectively. Indeed such a hypothesis could not have been formulated\nuntil, in comparatively recent times, psychical research had demonstrated\nthe reality of these \" paranormal \" processes.\nOnce this reality has been demonstrated, the formulation of the hypo-\nthesis is an obvious step if we can overcome the barrier of the way of think-\ning which regards the \" mind \" or \" soul \" as a mere aspect of organic\nprocesses. In 1943, Rhine and Pratt suggested in an Editorial in the\nJournal of Parapsychology that psycho-kinesis was the process by which the\n\f174] The Psi Processes in Normal and \" Paranoniial \" Psychology 195\nmind acted on the body [12].^ While doubting the appropriateness of the\nword \" mind \" in this connection, for reasons already discussed, we recog-\nnise that this is essentially the same view as our suggestion that psycho-\nkinesis is an exo-somatic form of the same Wk process as that which con-\ntrols the organism in normal volition. The same idea with respect to the\nWk explanation of hypnotic phenomena was clearly suggested by F. W. H.\nMyers in 1886 when he wrote \" perhaps when I attend to a thing, or will a\nthing, I am directing upon my own nervous system actually that same force\nwhich, when I direct it on another man's nervous system, is the '\nvital\ninfluence '\nof mesmerists, or the '\ntelepathic impact ' of which Mr\nGurney and I have said so much \" [17]. A parallel idea to that in our\nsuggestion with respect to We was put forward by Driesch who referred to\nmaterialisation as \" a supernormal embryology \" [13]. We have not, so\nfar, met with any previous suggestion that normal sensory perception is\nthe relation that the mind or soul has by means of Wy with what is going\non in the sensory part of the nervous system of the organism. That also may,\nhowever, have been suggested by other psychical researchers before now.\nA further consequence of the views sketched here is that we become\ndoubtful of the appropriateness of the implications of the word \" para-\nnormal \" for such facts as E.S.P. and P.K. We are suggesting that they\nare examples of processes which are themselves normal and indeed familiar,\nbut occurring in other than the familiar situation. They may be no more\n\" paranormal \" than the facts following from Einstein's theory of relativity.\nPhysicists do not regard the Newtonian laws of motion as \" normal \" and\nthose motion and gravitation effects which follow the principles of relativity\nas paranormal ;\nthey regard the Newtonian principles as a special case of a\nmore general set of principles which includes also the relativity phenomena.\nThis special case happens to be more familiar than the exceptions to it\nbecause most observable phenomena of movement occur within the limits\nof velocity for which Newtonian principles are approximately true. If we\nhad been born in a universe in which all velocities of bodies were near\nthat of light, then the Einstein laws would have been the familiar ones.\nSimilarly most facts of cognition and volition occur under the limiting\ncondition that the W inter-action between Shin and the material world is\nrestricted to that part of the material world which is the nervous system of\nthe organism. This limitation also may be an accidental circumstance of\nthe world in which we live. We might have lived in a world in which the\nW action of Shin was not commonly so limited. Then what we now call\n\" paranormal \" cognition and \" paranormal \" movements of objects would\nbe as familiar as they are now uncommon. If the means of interaction\nbetween Shin and the material world is, as we have suggested, the same for\nits endo-somatic forms, the contrast between these is between processes\nthat are usual and those that are unusual, not between those that are normal\nand those that are in any sense not-normal.\nOct. 1 2th, 1947\n^ This may also have been in the mind of Barrett when he wrote in 1886 :\n\" mind,\noccasionally and unconsciously, can exert a direct influence upon lifeless matter. Upon\nthe living organised matter of the brain mind can and does act, i.e. if we admit mind\napart from matter \" [16].\n\fREFERENCES\n[i] \" The Psychokinetic Effect\u2014I the First Experiment \", Louisa E..\nRhine and J.

Salter, writes as follows :\nIn the middle of the First World War there joined the Society a young man,\nwhose science studies at Cambridge had been interrupted by Army Service.\nMr Whately Smith (as he was then called) was destined during the suc-\nceeding thirty years to be one of the leading figures in our Society, dis-\ntinguished by his originality in introducing methods new to psychical\nresearch, his ingenuity and pertinacity in applying them, and the lively\nskill with which he presented his results.\nDuring the first few years he was content to follow well-beaten trails.\nIn December 1916 he had a sitting with Kathleen Goligher in Belfast, and\nin Proceedings vol XXX he described the sitting, and at the same time\nreviewed the Goligher phenomena as a whole, summing up in favour of\ntheir genuineness. In 1920 he was a member of the S.P.R. committee,\nwhich investigated \" Eva C.\" on her visit to London that year and reported\ncautiously\u2014most cautiously\u2014in her favour. In the same year he published\nThe Foundations of Spiritualism, a small book containing an admirable\nsummary of the evidence for survival, as it then stood. In it he shows a\nthorough understanding of what may be called the traditional work of the\nSociety. He was, however, soon after to break with tradition, and launch\nout on lines of his own planning.\nIt was the freshness of his approach to old problems that must have\nstruck everyone who first met him soon after his return to Kings. There\nis nothing more attractive than a young, tall, good-looking intellectual,\nwitty, widely read and desperately keen on his chosen task. Science and\npsychical research divided between them his main intellectual interest.\nThe relations between them were not as cordial and intimate as he thought\nthey should be, and he made it one of his main objects to place them on a\nbetter footing.\nThere were, he recognised, faults on both sides. The materialist bias of\nmany scientists was repugnant to his philosophy, and his book The Death of\nMaterialism (1933) was written to combat it.\nIt is clear, however, that he considered the main fault to lie on the side of\npsychical research. The Society, when he joined it, had been in existence\nfor thirty-four years, long enough for nearly the whole generation that saw\nits birth to have passed away, and long enough, in many institutions, for\nthe process of fossilisation to have become well-advanced. As to some\ntime-honoured branches of psychical research he thought this had already\ntaken place, and he was at no pains to conceal his opinion that the collection\nof spontaneous cases, and qualitative experiments in telepathy, however\nuseful as pioneer work in the \" eighties,\" offered no promise of progress.\nThe great contributions which Myers and Gurney had made to the medical\npsychology of their generation seemed to have little bearing on the doctrines\nof Freud and Jung, which were then gaining publicity in this country. He\nwas not unaware that the Society had in its studies of automatic writing\nstruck out a new line of research, but though, as he showed in The Founda-\n197\n\figS W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. [Part\ntions of Spiritualism, he was familiar with this work and its implications, it\ndid not seem to him a work likely to convince, or even attract, men of\nscience. The Society, he urged, ought to make more use of quantitative\nmethods familiar to the scientist, in combination with recent developments\nin psychological technique. This led him, as early as 192 1, to suggest as a\n\" New method of research \" {Proc. XXXI) the application of the word-\nassociation test, to the investigation of the psychological status of medi-\numistic Controls, as it had already been applied by American psychologists\nto one case of abnormal secondary personality. It was not, however, till\nsome years later that it was found possible to apply the method to three\nmediums, Mrs Leonard, Mrs Garrett and Rudi Schneider, and their\nControls. In a series of later investigations the same method was applied\nto several communicators. The results were set out in a series of papers in\nProceedings, entitled \" The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\n\"\n\"\n(Q.S.T.P.) from 1934 on. The difficulties of interpreting the figures\naroused much controversy, but the method of. analysis strongly suggests\nthat in some instances at least Controls are secondary personalities of the\nmedium produced by repression. This was an important result, in itself,\nbut the uncertainty of interpretation attaching to most of the data of this\nvery elaborate investigation was a disappointment.\nIn 1933 Mr Whately Smith resumed the family name of Carington,\nunder which his later work is to be found indexed in our Proceedings and\nJournal.\nIt was a belief firmly held by him that the Society would make more\nprogress if it attempted fewer tasks at one time. He had for long been\ninterested in the implications of telepathy (see Journal XXVIII, 57), and\nwas anxious that the Society should concentrate its energies on demon-\nstrating telepathy to the scientist by methods the scientist would recognise\nas cogent. With this in view, as soon as the labours of Q.S.T.P. began to\nease off, he worked out a technique of repeatable, quantitative experiment.\nThis required the collaboration of a representative group or groups of\npercipients. It was not the least of Carington's merits as a psychical\nresearcher that he was able to inspire others with his own keenness, so that\nthe necessary groups were not lacking. Important data were obtained, but\nthe experimental side of the work was interrupted by the outbreak of war.\nThis did not, however, interfere with Carington's analysis of the data\nalready obtained.\nHis work on telepathy is too recent and too well known to need descrip-\ntion here. Mention may, however, be made of two matters which illustrate\nhis qualities as an investigator and as a man. He was very generous in\npassing on to other persons conducting research on similar lines points\narising in his own work which struck him as likely to be of interest to them :\nthe phenomenon of \" displacement \", for example. He was, again, most\nanxious that his readers should have every opportunity of following not\nonly his results, but the reasoning by which he arrived at them, and he\nsometimes credited his readers with an ability to master involved statistical\nargument which they were far from possessing. His book on Telepathy\ngained immediate recognition as an outstanding contribution to the theory\nof the subject.\nHe was the fortunate possessor of an extremely lively style. Quantitative\n\f174] Obituary 199\nwork inevitably tends to aridity, but Carington's reader is constantly\nrefreshed by passages of keen, sometimes pungent, wit and apt illustration.\nThese qualities appear in all his numerous writings, which in this respect\nconform to the best traditions of S.P.R. literature.\nCarington was a believer in survival of some kind, while having, he con-\nfessed, a strong repugnance to \" Spiritualism \" as frequently expounded.\nHe did not think that the problem could be usefully debated until various\nphilosophical difficulties had been cleared up. This was the task on which\nhe was engaged at the time of his death, but he left unfinished the book that\nwas intended to embody his solution. May we hope that it will be com-\npleted and brought to publication by some other hand?\nFrom his schooldays on everyone who knew Carington was struck by the\nthoroughness and pertinacity with which he carried out any work he under-\ntook. Without these qualities he could never have accomplished what he\ndid in the face of obstacles. First of these must be mentioned his health,\nwhich compelled him to live abroad for considerable periods. It is a mark\nof the high regard that the Council had for his work that he was retained\nas a member both of the Council and of the Committee of Reference and\nwas chosen as Myers Memorial Lecturer, during his long residence out of\nthe country. None the less, the lack of close personal contact with col-\nleagues during these years and still more during the war raised diffi-\nculties which were not wholly met by the fullness with which he was pre-\npared to discuss in correspondence matters relating to psychical research.\nLife abroad was congenial to him, and exclusion from it as the result of\nthe war would have depressed him, even if the alternative had not been the\ndiscomforts of a small Cornish cottage, which nothing could have made\ntolerable but the housewifely skill and devotion of Mrs Carington. For\nhis finances were not such as to permit him those amenities which the\nintellectual worker highly values.\nDr. Thouless, who was brought into close contact with his experimental\nwork, writes as follozvs: ,\nAfter the war of 1914, Whately Carington returned to Cambridge to do\nresearch on the psycho-galvanic reflex; his book The Measurement of\nEmotion (Kegan Paul) was based on this work. His main interest was not,\nhowever, in the reflex itself but in the possibility of using it as a means of\nstudying trance personalities. While doing this work at Cambridge, he\nhad already devised the plan of the method by which he hoped to find out\nwhether the spirits which communicated through mediums were genuine\nautonomous personalities, and also whether the controls were autonomous\npersonalities or merely dissociated parts of the medium's own personality.\nThis work was completed many years later and published in the Proceedings\nas a series of articles on \" The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\".\nThis was a brilliantly designed experimental plan which well displayed\nWhately Carington's gifts of boldness and originality. In its main purpose\nthe plan miscarried since critical analysis of his figures showed that he was\nmistaken in believing that they showed evidence that \" spirits \" were\nautonomous perspnalities. There were, however, clear indications of the\ntruth of the hypothesis that the controls were dissociated parts of the\nmedium's personality.\n\f200 W. Whately Caringion, M.Sc. [Part\nAfter a not very successful set of experiments on precognition in dice\nthrowing, Whately Carington started work on the paranormal cognition\nof drawings (also published as a series of articles in the Proceedings).\nEarly in this work he suspected that the straightforward methods of mark-\ning success were vitiated by the subjects being paranormally influenced by\nthe drawings exposed on nights before that on which they made their\nreproduction and also by those to be exposed on succeeding nights. The\ncorrectness of this surmise was amply confirmed and his discovery of the\nfact of temporal displacement in experiments on paranormal cognition is\nthe principal new fruit of this research. During recent years, he had been\nengaged in work on psycho-kinesis with the same energy and enthusiasm.\nThe results of these investigations have not yet been published.\nIn his attitude towards quantitative experimental work Whately Caring-\nton challenged tradition and showed himself a progressive. He was not\ninterested in the mere repetition of standard experiments already per-\nformed by other people in the hope of accumulating an ever increasing\nweight of evidence of the same kind. He regarded quantitative experi-\nmental investigation as primarily a means of making discoveries about the\nnature of psychical phenomena and not merely of proving that they exist.\n'\nThis function of quantitative experiment is commonplace in other branches\nof the biological sciences although it has been little employed in psychical\nresearch. When Whately Carington repeated his own experiments, his\nobject was not merely to accumulate proof but to obtain data the analysis\nof which would reveal something of the laws underlying psychical pheno-\nmena. He may sometimes have overestimated the revealing power of\nstatistical analysis but he never doubted that the function of quantitative\nexperimentation was to find explanations and not merely to increase the\nweight of evidence.\nThe two most obvious characteristics of Whately Carington as an ex-\nperimenter were his industry and his boldness. Both sometimes led him\nastray. His industry sometimes led him to embark on an elaborate mass of\nc^culations with only a trivial end in view ; his boldness sometimes led\nhim to try to extract significance from mere accidental peculiarities of his\nfigures. But these were also gifts which made him a fruitful experimenter.\nHis boldness led him to explore possibilities that a more cautious enquirer\nwould have ignored, and his industry led him to examine them with a\nthoroughness that extracted the last grain of information from them.\nThese explorations did not always lead to fruitful results and he was from\ntime to time misled by over-confidence in his conclusions, but they did\nsucceed often enough to justify his departure from the beaten track of con-\nventional experimentation. He might often go along a cul-de-sac with the\nconfidence that others would feel only when their feet were on the high\nroad, but his justification was that sometimes what appeared to be a cul-\nde-sac turned out to be really a path to something new.\nWe are indebted to Mr. Fraser Nicolfor thefollowing personal appreciation :\nMy tale was heard, and yet it was not told ;\nMy fruit is fallen, and yet my leaves are green ;\nMy youth is spent, and yet I am not old ;\nI saw the world, and yet I was not seen ;\n\f174] Obituary 201\nMy thread is cut, and yet it is not spun ;\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\nTiCHBOURNE, On the Eve oj Death, 1586\nWhately Carington once described himself as \" a member of the smallest\nprofession in the world\u2014the Profession of Psychical Research.\" He went\non to remark (surprised a little by his own reflections) that there were only\nhalf a dozen men whose only occupation and main means of livelihood was\npsychical investigation. I remember the occasion well, for it wis the first\ntime I had met him. He gazed into space in that curiously abstracted way\nof his, and began to reel off the names on the roll of the Profession. At each\nname he bent a finger, and having disposed of the whole of one hand he\npaused searching his mind for the sixth and last name. For a time it could\nnot be found ; then with a sudden smile of enlightenment he exclaimed,\n\" Of course\n\u2014\nmyself\\\n\" This momentary forgetfulness of self was the cause\nof some surprise to him, for he was presently confessing himself to be\n\" beastly egocentric \". A disarming candour was one of Carington's most\nattractive characteristics.\nAs a man he could be fitted into no known pattern or category. In his\ngreatness (and those who knew him well will scarcely question that he had\nthe stuff of greatness in him) and in his limitations he was unique of his\nkind. He could always be depended upon to do the unusual and unex-\npected thing. The occasion mentioned above was the culmination of a\nlong, and on one side at least, a lively correspondence, in the course of\nwhich I had invited him to visit me in Scotland. Nothing came of this\nproposal for many months\u2014I cannot remember that he even acknowledged\nit, such was the man absorbed in other things\u2014until one summer evening\nthe telephone rang and a distant voice announced itself as that of Whately\nCarington speaking from Amsterdam Airport. He badly needed a\nchange, he said, and (hesitantly) might he be allowed to arrive next\nmorning?\nSo, the following forenoon, he stood on the doorstep, smiling with a\ncurious shyness. He was immensely tall, somewhere over six feet two\ninches in height, and like many very tall men, slightly stooped. His eyes\nwere pale blue-grey and looked with a gentle penetrating gaze through\nthick glasses, and his fair hair crowned a head which seemed proportion-\nately greater than his body. He was then about forty years of age, but\neven at that time the complexities and strains of life had aged him beyond\nhis years.\nWith him he brought all he found necessary to pursue (on holiday) the\ndaily work of psychical research\u2014a massive and burdensome electrical\ncalculating machine, and an outsize in suitcases which he was soon dis-\ngorging of the greater part of its contents\u2014files of mediumship data,\nstationery, books and\u2014an ashtray which accompanied him on all his travels.\nHe was born Walter Whately Smith, but in later life reverted to the old\nfamily name of Carington, derived from Carentan in Brittany, the original\nhome of the family. Looking back on his life he could not remember a\ntime, even in early childhood, when his disposition was not shy and pain-\nfully sensitive. Those difficulties never left him, and he attributed some\nof the distress they caused him to early ethical teachings which were de-\n\f202 W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. [Part\nrived more from the rigorous outlook of the Old Testament than the com-\nparative gentleness of the New.\nHis days at Eton and Cambridge were memorable mainly\u2014and almost\nexclusively\u2014for the rapturous delights of Science. Sport, in most of its\nforms, interested him not at all : he had no competitive instinct. In\nscience he had all the physical and intellectual endowments that go to make\na great experimentalist and thinker\u2014an enquiring cast of mind, acute\npowers of observation, intelligence that was both analytic and constructive,\na pair of clever and sensitive hands, and not least a spirit of adventure\ntempered by a shrewd caution. In any piece of work undertaken by him\nhis thoroughness was extraordinary.\nIn the latter part of the first world war he served in the Royal Air Force\nand took some pride in having piloted twenty-nine types of aircraft. He\nwas involved, however, in a perilous and unnerving forced landing on the\nChannel coast which seriously disturbed his health. Illnesses thereafter\ninterrupted the course of his work.\nIt was during that war that his interest was drawn to psychical research\nby some experiences with mediums narrated to him by a relative. Soon\nafterwards, December 19 16, he had the first of several sittings with Mrs\nOsborne Leonard. As he wrote long afterwards, he was then \" a wholly\nobscure convalescent subaltern, unconnected in any public way with\nspiritualism or psychical research and only beginning to take a rather\ndilletante interest in them.\" The striking evidence off^ered by Feda\n(supported and strengthened by encyclopaedic reading of the literature\nthereafter) was sufficient to destroy the apologetic dilletantism.\nFrom that time forth\u2014and although for a period after the war he was\nengaged in psychological research at Cambridge and spent some years in\nacoustical research with special reference to psychological problems, for\nthe Air Ministry and War Office\u2014it may be said that the strongest urge of\nhis life was to explore and, if possible, to solve some of the most resistant\nproblems of the invisible world.\nHe made two journeys to Belfast to examine the telekinetic mediumship\nof Kathleen Goligher. On the first occasion he was convinced\u2014and never\nafterwards changed his opinion\u2014that the phenomena at that time were\ngenuine. But four years later (his second visit) he found a \" conspicuous\nand startling deterioration \" and he concluded that the mediumship had\nbecome fraudulent. In 1920 he was a member of the S.P.R. Committee\nwhich investigated the materialising medium Eva C, with inconclusive\nresults.\nMany years later I tried to attract his interest to physical mediumship,\nbut he was not to be drawn. You try scores of experiments with a medium,\nhe said in effect, and at the end of it all you do not know even whether you\nhave been testing a medium or merely a clever conjuror. He believed that\nprogress in psychical research was most likely to come \" at the present\nstage of our knowledge \" from the study of comparatively simple things\nlike telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition. Nevertheless he showed\ngreat interest in the telekinetic mediumship of Rudi Schneider when he\nsaw that the phenomena had a close bearing upon his own work in psycho-\nkinesis.\nIn the early nineteen-twenties his literary output was considerable. In\n\fly^] Obituary 203\n1920, when he was in his twenty-eighth year, he published A Theory of the\nMechanism of Survival and The Foundations of Spiritualistn. The latter\nconsisted for the most part of a summary of the evidence favourable to the\nsurvival hypothesis together with a note on his own' views at that date.\nBriefly, his opinion was :\nThe experimental evidence for Survival and Communication with the\ndeceased is distinctly good, and shows a tendency to become increas-\ningly so. But it is very difficult to set a limit to the potentialities of\nthe incarnate mind, and it would be rash to assess the chance of the\n\" spiritistic\n\" hypothesis at a value appreciably greater than one half.\nIn later years he came gradually to the view that some part of the\npersonality survives death.\nThe other book was more important and showed some of Canngton's\nqualities as a speculative thinker. For purposes of discussion he assumed\nthat consciousness survives physical death and proceeded to construct a\ntheory of Four-dimensional Space which would, he considered, go some\nway towards explaining the mechanism of survival and also some of the\nphenomena of sleep, trance, anaesthesia and other forms of insensibility.\nThe book seems to have attracted little attention\u2014it was not reviewed in\nour Proceedings or Journal. In the course of years the theory underwent a\ngradual modification at his own hands, due in part to a growing interest m\nmodern conceptions of Non-Euclidean Space. Those revised theories and\nviews would have found their place in a large-scale work on Survival which\nwas under consideration\u2014and a small part of it written\u2014at the time of his\ndeath. (Here, as in other matters of authorship and research, \" his thread\nwas cut, and yet it was not spun \".)\nThe year 1920 was a period of intense activity. He produced the two\nbooks already mentioned ; in April he was co-opted a member of Council\n;\nin July he issued the first number of The Psychic Research Quarterly ;\nhe\nwas engaged also in psychological research at Cambridge ;\nand the idea\nwas germinating in his mind for the future \" Quantitative Study of Trance\nPersonalities \". If high quality of contents could have ensured success the\nQuarterly would still be in existence today ; in fact after a year it was found\nnecessary to reconstitute it as Psyche, \"a quarterly review of psychology\nin relation to education, psycho-analysis . . . psychical research etc.\",\nCarington continuing as editor of the re-fashioned review for some years.\nSo far as his activhies as an investigator are concerned\u2014as distinct from\nhis work as a contemplative thinker\u2014Carington will best be remembered\nhereafter for his ingenious and vast application of quantitative methods to\npsychical phenomena. His first use of mathematical methods of assess-\nment goes back to the early nineteen-twenties when he was employing, in\nDr William Brown's words, \" highly original \" methods in the investiga-\ntion of emotion and affective tone in his Cambridge experiments with the\npsycho-galvanic reflex mechanism. Some ninety subjects were tested m\nthis way and more than 45,000 observations were made. The results of\nthose studies were described in The Measurement of Emotion. About the\nsame time he was proposing the use of the same procedures as \" an entirely\nnew line of attack \" for the investigation of the psychological status of the\n\" Controls \" of mediumistic trance.\n\f204 W. Whately Caringtott, M.Sc. [Part\nA dozen years were to pass before he was able to put the project into\naction. Carington's cogitations on the state of survival research at this\ntime {ca. 1933) were gloomy. The Society for Psychical Research had been\nin existence for half a century. In its early days there appeared to have\nbeen an expectation amongst its membership that some great new scientific\ntruth was about to burst upon the world. The Society had now published\nsome seventy volumes, a large proportion of whose pages contained evidence\nbearing upon the survival problem. But the world was no nearer accepting\nthe great new truth (if truth it were) than ever it had been.\nBy this time Carington had come very cautiously to the opinion that the\nsurvival hypothesis offered the most economical explanation of the pub-\nlished mediumistic evidence. He was quick to add, however, that that was\nno more than a personal opinion. It was a judicial judgement and as such\nwas a long way from being a scientific truth. He considered that so long as\n\" witness-box \" methods (a5 in the examination and study of ostensible\ncommunicators) continued to be used as the main instrument of research,\nthere was little prospect of bringing the matter to a critical issue.\nHe had no illusions as to the long and hard road that lay ahead for\npsychical researchers, but he firmly believed that the pace of their journey\nmight be quickened by the adoption and exploitation of new methods.\nThese methods were the instrumental methods of scientific men, the results\nbeing assessed by mathematics. But it had to be made clear that \" Outside\nof pure mathematics and other organised symbol systems there can be no\nsuch thing as absolute proof, but only the establishing of a greater or\nsmaller probability.\" It was likely, he thought, that a long time would\nelapse before the demonstrable probability of survival would reach so over-\nwhelming a value as to be universally coercive.\nDiscarding the old \" judicial \" methods of attack, he called in the pro-\ncedures of the laboratory. This was his \" Quantitative Study of Trance'\nPersonalities \". It occupied almost the whole of his daily life for five years.\nFour reports were issued between the years 1934 and 1939. It is scarcely\npossible to give an adequate summary of the work in a short space ; the\nreader may be referred tq Carington's own published accounts, or to Dr\nThouless's very lucid and valuable review of the first three reports, printed\nin Proceedings vol. 44. The general method employed was that of the Word\nAssociation Test of Jung, use being made of the Psycho-galvanic Reflex\nmechanism, the Reaction Time, and Disturbances in Reproduction.\nThose techniques were applied to four mediums (in their normal state)\u2014\nMrs Leonard, Mrs Garrett, Mrs Sharplin and Herr Rudi Schneider\u2014to\ntheir trance Controls, and to the ostensible spirit Communicators. By\nsuch means Carington hoped to show whether the Controls and Spirits\nwere independent of the mediums.\nOn only one point was he able to come to any firm conclusion\u2014that the\nso-called Controls were secondary personalities of the mediums. As for\nthe question of the autonomy of Communicators no certain answer could\nbe returned\u2014the statistical assessment did not permit of a plain yes or no\nreply. It appeared to Carington, however, that there was on the whole\ngood reason to suspect the operation of some \" non-medium \" factor and\nthat therefore the case for the independence of the communicators was\nstrengthened.\n\f174] Obituary 205\nWhately Carington was a pioneer. Never for him the well-worn paths\nnor the well-tried methods of approach. And as an audacious pioneer he\nencountered all the difficulties and suffered all the disappointments\nattendant on pioneering work. Shortly before the investigation began he\nhad almost no knowledge of modern statistics. He set himself to learn\n\u2014\nout of intolerably difficult books\u2014and the wonder was that he learned so\nmuch. When the books did not supply a valid method, Professor Fisher\nand Mr W. L. Stevens could be depended on to elucidate difficulties.\nAlmost any other man would have realised early on that the work was\ntoo much for one mind and one pair of hands, and would probably have\ncut it short on the not unreasonable excuse that the problems he had set\nwere impossible of solution. But Carington had unlimited powers of per-\nseveration.\nPhysically alone, the work was a serious strain. To begin with he worked\nmany thousands of calculations on a little hand-operated calculating\nmachine, which caused an affection of his elbow. The Society's Council\ncame to his aid with a magnificent electrically-driven calculating machine\nwhich greatly eased the labour and speeded up the work. \" It does more\nwork in a day \", he wrote with exultant exaggeration, \" than any six men\ncould do in a month\n\u2014\nand more accurately!\n\"\nBut even so, the anxieties were not removed. His health was in an\nindifferent state, and he was living in Holland at a village on the edge of the\nZuyder Zee, and subsisting on ^n income of \u00a3120 a year. The Society\ncame to his assistance with a grant (the first of a number of grants) which\nalleviated his situation but at the same time intensified his fears\u2014the\nhaunting fear that after all the award might be wasted on work which in\nthe end would produce no conclusive result. His extreme conscientious-\nness only added to his distress and may have contributed to the steady\nundermining of his health. At one period he was writing of \"an in-\ndescribably purgatorial time,\" of \" mistake after mistake \" being found ;\nand again, \" I have never had such a struggle in my life as with this work.\nThe drudgery alone, of which, I suppose not more than a fifth part is even\nsuggested by the final product, was formidable ... I won't write more or I\nshall start telling you all about how tiresome everything is ... If one insists\non grossly overworking for five months one must not be surprised at break-\ning down . . . (But) Phoenix is my middle name and I'm not (unfortunately\nI sometimes feel) dead yet ;\nthough I have no reason to suppose that the\nnext life will show any improvement on this.\"\nDuring an interval in the trance-personality work he conducted some\nexploratory experiments in Precognition. He recruited some forty subjects\nwhose task it was to forecast the fall of dice. The investigation was of a\nvery tentative nature, and the experience gained proved of great value when\nhe later conducted his very important research in the Paranormal Cognition\nof Drawings. It was in the course of the dice-work that the idea of the\nDisplacement Effect first occurred to him, and a hint of it is given in the\nJournal of June 1935, where he compared each guess\u2014there were 51,240\nguesses in all\u2014not only with the throw for which it was intended but with\nthe next and also with the next but one.\nThe results of the experiments were suggestive rather than significant,\nand they formed another example of Carington's vast and laborious spade-\n\f2o6 W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. [Part\nwork in previously unexplored fields. He would often say, with amused\nself-depreciation that he \" tried all the wrong ways first\". I do not think\nthat in so doing it ever occurred to him how much he was preserving later\nworkers from the innumerable pitfalls that beset his pioneering labours.\nIn the spring of 1938 Carington was married to a German lady, Hedda\nEnders. The circumstances were such as are not usually associated with\nsuch ceremonies\u2014though they do not appear surprising against the back-\nground of pre-war Germany. They had known each other for some years,\nand in recent times Hedda Enders had suff'ered the grim experience of being\njailed and put through the third degree by the German Secret Police.\nCarington's moral and physical courage never showed itself better than at\nthis time. He entered Germany in order to effect an escape and was well\naware of the risks he was running. He thought it would be advisable to\n^\nleave a \" life-line \" open to this country, and this precaution took the form\nof a simple but ingenious code based on the way he wrote the date on his\nletters\u20142. i. 38 as. compared with 2 January 38 and so on\u2014each form of\nwriting having its particular meaning. He laughed at this sort of arrange-\nment as being \" melodramatic \". Anyhow it was a frightening experience.\nPlans for the crossing of the frontier were laid in Frankfurt-am-Main by\nCarington, his wife-to-be and the husband of one of her friends. Carington\nthen lay low in Berlin, living in a room near the Potsdammerplatz, until the\nplans matured. What he saw and heard in Berlin during those weeks made\nhim (who had previously shown little interest in politics) a savagely angry\nenemy of National Socialism for the rest of his days.\nAs for himself, in Berlin, \" The mere fact that one did not know [whether\nthe secret had been uncovered by the authorities] was very wearing\u2014or so\nI found. For weeks I was scared stiff whenever I heard a male voice in the\nflat {e.g. telephone inspector, gas merchant, postman) fearing that it might\nbe a Secret Police agent come to interrogate or arrest. And, of course, at\none time I thought there was a distinct possibility of war and being cut off\nin hostile country.\"\nMrs Carington was eventually got across the frontier by a mountain pass\ninto Czechoslovakia, a journey greatly facilitated by the knowledge and\nguidance of her family friend. The latter turned back at the frontier ;\nthe Caringtons were married in Prague the same day. Mrs Carington's\nfriend perished in a concentration camp during the war.\nThe years following this marriage were the most fortunate in Whately\nCarington's life, and they also formed his most abundant period as a\npsychical research worker. If Carington was the restless worker and\nwriter, his wife was the adviser, critic and collaborator. On at least one\noccasion\u2014in the Paranormal Cognition of Drawings\u2014she was the origina-\ntor of an impressive piece of research.\nAt first they lived in Cambridge, but in 1940 moved to Cornwall.\nCarington's health rapidly improved, and for a year or two he felt himself\nstronger and his mind more at rest than at any time since he was young.\nA holiday spent in the south of France just before the war had also done\nhim a power of good. Years afterwards he used to look back, with a painful\nlonging, on one particularly memorable day of that holiday. It was spent\non a quiet, sunny beach, and\n\u2014\" I hadn't a care or thought in the world . . .\nIt was the only completely happy day of my life.\"\n\f1 Obituary 207\nTheir little cottage stood at the end of Sennen Cove, a stone's throw\nfrom Land's End. There was a cold water supply and electric light (part\nof which Carington had fitted up) ; there were no other of the ordinary\nrequirements of civilisation, but somehow the place had been made com-\nfortable, and Mrs Carington's garden in summer was a delight.\nHere Whately Carington passed the last years of his life, and most of\nthose years were spent in his study, which was a small, narrow room with,\nat one end, a tiny window that overlooked the Atlantic. He rarely looked\nout of the window, in my recollection\u2014the passing show interested him\nnot at all. (On the other hand, he followed with too much excitement the\nprogress of the war.) On a vast ex-dining table pushed against the window-\ncorner were all the tools of his labours\u2014the calculating machine, typewriter,\npens, rubber, multi-coloured inks, index cabinets containing summaries of\nthousands of calculations ; and at one side of him, as he sat at his table,\nwere well-thumbed sets of our own and other Societies' Proceedings.\nRound the walls and overflowing into his adjacent bedroom were row upon\nrow of thick files\u2014they must have numbered about 200\u2014containing com-\nplete records of his work in past years.\nHe worked with extreme care and precision, and treated his data with a\nthoroughness that at times seemed more a failing than a virtue. He light-\nheartedly excused this on the ground that he was \" a pathological per-\nfectionist \". Moreover, in psychical research it was a rare experience, he\nheld, to get a straightforward \" Yes \" or \" No \" answer to a question ;\nit\nwas therefore necessary to drag out of the data every particle of information\nthey could offer\u2014if only as a signpost for further work and for future\ninvestigators. He felt that his elaborate statistical methods were fully\njustified by his discovery of the Displacement Eff^ect in the Paranormal\nCognition of Drawings.\nTo collaborate with Whately Carington was an education in how\npsychical research should be done. Nothing but the best one could do\nwould satisfy him ; and having done one's best he would then propose\nimprovements. But if he imposed heavy demands on others he was no less\nsevere on himself. His own criteria were summarised in his own words\n\u2014\n\" We must always remember that the methods of orthodox science are not\nnecessarily good enough for psychical research.\" Without such rigorous\nstandards he would probably never have been able to enlist the co-operation\nof the many university psychologists who collaborated with him in the\nPNC research.\nBut the rigorous methods had an account to render. The care taken of\nhis health allowed him to write, in 1941, \" I'm working harder and better\nthan I have for years \", but in the same letter, \" I just can't keep abreast\nwith what has to be done.\" From 1942 onwards he worked at an ever\naccelerating pace. It had been his custom to work eight hours a day\n\u2014\n\" like an honest working man \". When this proved insufficient he stepped\nit up to ten hours, then to twelve, and sometimes until he fell asleep from\nexhaustion over his worktable. In his last years he began work about 7.30\nin the morning, and never later than 8 o'clock.\nHe refreshed himself with endless cups of tea\u2014a beverage which he\ndescribed as his only remaining pleasure\u2014poured from a half-gallon pot,\nwhich was replenished from time to time during the day. A short rest after\n\f2o8 W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. .. [Part\nlunch, then he returned to further calculations, or to deal with his large\ncorrespondence, or to write more pages to whatever manuscript was in\nprogress at the time. Most of his own experiments were carried out at\nnight in collaboration with his wife.\nThe sense of urgency grew more intense each year. \" Time is so short,\"\nhe would exclaim. When advised to rest he retorted, \" No, I must work\nand \/ must work, for the time cometh when no man shall work.\" The\nawards of the Perrott Studentship and later a Leverhulme Research\nFellowship gave him deep pleasure. Perversely, those marks of recognition\ncontributed to his worries, for his high sense of responsibility was always\nat the mercy of his nervous temperament, and the fear of failure (to fulfil\nhis undertakings) was very real to him.\nYet it was in such circumstances that he produced two papers by which\nhis name will be best remembered hereafter. The first was the highly\ntechnical paper called \" Steps in the Development of a Repeatable Tech-\nnique \", {Proc. A.S.P.R. vol. 24). The construction of an experiment that\nwould meet one of the prime requirements of all scientific work, namely\none which could be repeated at any time with approximately similar\nresults on each occasion, had long been Carington's aim in psychical re-\nsearch, and he considered that his Frequency-Catalogue invention fully\nmet such requirements. He conceded to critics that the method would\nrequire amendment, but he felt that it was fundamentally sound. The\npreparation of the catalogue, which occupies some thirty pages of the\nreport, entailed the re-examination of the work of 741 percipients and the\nindividual examination of 10,006 drawings. The mere physical labour\nalone was monstrous, it occupied Carington for many months, and during\nthe whole of this time his wife was seriously ill.\nIt would be a mistake to think of him as always borne down by duty and\nanxiety. He had periods of gaiety when his infectious laughter would\ninvolve the whole company. He was not a great talker\u2014the reading of a\npaper at the S.P.R. was invariably an ordeal to him\u2014but he was a witty\nand lively conversationalist. He had a genuine humour, for at times he\nwould joke at his own misfortunes. He was the perfect host, for in him\n\" the desire to please \" had no known limits.\nThe conception and development of the Association Theory of Psychical\nPhenomena was the cause of much lively correspondence. (The theory\nwas set forth in Proc. vol. 47, and forms the second of the two papers\nmentioned above.) One was forewarned to look out for the draft of a\npaper, \" in which I propose to plunge into theory feet first with a loud\nsplash, and try to produce one which is applicable not only to PNC but\n(in outline) to practically the whole range of psychic phenomena.\" The\npaper was duly received, and was returned to him accompanied by some\nminor suggestions and a word of doubt about the \" flippancy \" of some of\nhis paragraphs. To this he characteristically replied\n\u2014\" To a certain ex-\ntent this kind of thing is natural to me ; but also it is part of a deliberate\npolicy of debunking, and of a refusal to be intimidated by pundits or by the\nprofundities and awe-inspiringness of the subject.

EXPERIMENTS\nR. Wilson.\n, Abstract\nIn this paper is considered the use of random selectors for experiments in\nExtra-Sensory Perception. The fundamental principles upon which the\noperation of random selectors depends are discussed ; selectors devised by\nprevious workers in the field are criticised in the light of these principles,\nand a new machine which overcomes many of the disadvantages is de-\nscribed. Another machine to this design is being constructed for the\nS.P.R. Council ; it employs a reliable electronic valve circuit to select one\nof four lamps, though the same type of selector can be designed to select\none of any number of lamps.\nAutomatic counting of the scores in an E.S.P. experiment is described,\nand various precautions against false counts are enumerated.\nIntroduction\nIn statistical experiments in E.S.P. one of the most important features\nof the experimental technique is the method of obtaining a random\nsequence of cards. Unless the sequence is random, the use of statistics\nbased on the assumption of randomness is invalid. Shuffling cards has its\nlimitations : the shuffling must be very thorough, the pack of cards large,\nand precautions must be taken against fraud. Soal (Soal 1940 ; 1943)\nused preselected numbers, a method which necessitates additional pre-\ncautions against fraud and is in any case open to objection when used for\nprecognition or clairvoyance experiments. His alternative of using\ncounters drawn form a bag is tedious and open to the same objections.\nIf a method of selecting the cards is used in which the probabilities for\nthe various cards are not equal, it is possible to use Stevens' method (Soal\n1940) to obtain the chance expectation, whereby the material supplies its\nown probability. But it is still essential, for the statistics to be valid, that\nthe probability of any event occurring is independent of any previous\nevents. This is not true of the average human selector (Tyrrell 1936).\nTyrrell also showed that it is not true for the conventional pack of E.S.P.\ncards if it is of a finite size. In this paper it will be shown that the principal\ndifficulty in devising a satisfactory mechanical selector is to ensure this\nindependence the importance of which especially in precognition experi-\nments, is obvious.\nA machine that can produce reliably and quickly a random sequence\nwhich can be conveniently used for these experiments is therefore an\nasset. This has been the goal of two experimenters, (Tyrrell 1936 ;\nRedmayne 1940), who both describe electrical machines. A machine which\nis electrical in operation is most convenient, because a single such machine\ncan be made suitable for operation under various experimental conditions\n(telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, etc.) and the conditions may even\n213\n\f214 R. Wilson [Part\nbe varied during the course of a single experiment. It also facilitates auto-\nmatic recording of results.\nA simple and ingenious machine for testing E.S.P. has been devised by\nParsons (1946) ; this uses counters, and the random selection is obtained\nby shaking them together in a bottle. It is an improvement over the\nordinary technique only for clairvoyance experiments.\nRhine has stated in great detail the requirements he considers essential\nfor an E.S.P. machine (Rhine 1939). In this paper he suggests that the\nrandom selector is the most difEcult part of the machine to design. This\naccords with the writer's experience. Rhine's conditions, which include\nprovision for the recording of every light selected and every guess, and\ncounters which reset to zero and stop the machine after a \" run \" of 25\ntrials, are considered by the writer to be too extravagant. Though un-\ndoubtedly desirable, they are expensive luxuries, and are therefore regret-\nfully discarded. They may easily be connected at a later date if thought\nnecessary.\nMerritt has described an automatic card shuffler for use in clairvoyance\ntests (Merritt 1939).\nA selector which has produced 100,000 random numbers has been con-\nstructed by Kendall (Kendall 1938 ; 1939). This uses a continuously\nrotating disc, divided into ten equal sectors inscribed with the numbers\n0-9. One of the sectors was illuminated intermittently by a neon lamp.\nThe number illuminated on each occasion was written down by an ob-\nserver. This introduces an undesirable subjective element into the\noperation of the apparatus ; one result is that with some observers, a truly\nrandom sequence is not obtained. Also, automatic recording is not possible\nwith this apparatus. Both of these factors make the machine, as it stands,\nunsuitable for E.S.P. experiments, but the selection itself is based upon\nsound principles.\nTyrrell's selector consists of a Post Office Uniselector Switch, in which a\ncontact arm traverses in turn each of twenty-five contacts. These are\nwired in five groups of five, since a selection of only five lamps is required.\nThe supply current to the traversing ratchet is cut off by hand at ar random\ninstant. The selection of the switch contact to remain in circuit when the\nratchet mechanism stops, is random, if the time of traversal of the several\ncontacts be equal. (Inequalities tend to cancel, since there are five contacts\nfor each circuit.)\nRedmayne's machine incorporates a motor-driven rotary selector with\nfive vanes mounted at equal distances round the periphery. The selector\nis stopped at a random time by an attracting electro-magnet, and an\nelectrical contact made to one of the five vanes. In addition to the random\nvariation in time, Redmayne varies the speed of his motor.\nTyrrell's and Redmayne's machines have their disadvantages also.\nTyrrell's is not portable, and both use batteries. Redmayne's will not\noperate at the high speed required for use in some precognition experi-\nments (Soal 1940 ; 1943) ; it will be shown later that the randomness of\nTyrrell's machine is very dependent upon the regularity with which the key\nis depressed, especially at high speeds of operation. It may therefore work\nsatisfactorily with some operators but not with others. Also machines con-\nstructed by others on apparently identical principles have failed to reach\n\f174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 215\nthe same high standard possessed by the prototypes. This is unfortunate,\nbecause it makes one doubt whether the prototype is reliable under all\nconditions of operation, and continuous checking during the course of an\nexperiment is rendered desirable.\nThe need for a reliable machine is apparent : a desirable attribute is that\nof easy detection and repair of faults.\nIf the sequence fails to be random because of some fault, it is desirable\nthat the departure from the randomness should be sufficiently great to be-\ncome immediately obvious. To design a machine with these features it is\nfirst necessary to examine in detail the factors which cause a departure from\nrandomness.\nGeneral Theory of Random Selectors\nAll the Random Number Selectors considered in this paper work on the\nfollowing basic principle :\nA mechanical or electrical system traverses, in rapid succession, a num-\nber of distinct \" states \", each state potentially representing the lighting of\na corresponding lamp. The traversal may be by means of a motor-driven\nrotary switch, or by an electronic valve circuit. The \" cyclical period \", or\nthe time taken for all the states to be traversed once, depends on the speed\nof the driving motor (in the case of a rotary switch) or on the frequency of\nthe oscillator (in the case of a valve circuit), and may if desired be made\nrandomly variable.\nThe driving motor (or oscillator etc.) is switched on and off every few\nseconds, either at regular or at random intervals. The state of the system\nat the instant of switching off determines the lamp to be lit. A guess is then\nmade by the percipient in an E.S.P. experiment, the machine automatically\nrecording the success or otherwise of the guess, and the motor is switched\non again in preparation for the next selection. If the lamp is to be randomly\nselected, either the cyclical period, or the running time of the motor (or\noscillator), or both, must be random. The conditions of randomness are\ndiscussed in detail in Appendix I.\nThe problem is to convert a randomness in time into a randomness of\nselection of the lamp to be lit. If there are several cycles during which all\nthe states are traversed before the motor is switched off, and the running\ntime of the motor is made sufficiently irregular with respect to successive\nselections, the selection will be practically random. Theoretically an in-\nfinite number of cycles would be necessary for perfect randomness ; in\npractice, however, a perfectly random sequence is not required. So long\nas the effect to be observed is large in comparison with the deviations from\nrandomness, some small preferences, either for individual lamps, or for\nparticular sequences of lamps, can be tolerated.\nIt is shown in Appendix I that too great a cyclical period {i.e. too low a\nmotor speed) or too short a running time, gives rise to sequence preferences.\nFor a I per cent deviation from randomness, it is shown that t, the cyclical\nperiod, must not be greater than 0-12 AT, where AT is the \" spread \" of\nthe running time T, and is a measure of the randonmess of T. For a five\nper cent deviation, t must not exceed 0-27 AT.\nIt would be difficult for a percipient in an E.S.P. experiment to take ad-\nvantage of sequence preferences, which are difficult to detect unless they\n\f2l6 R. Wilson [Part\nare very prominent. Probably, therefore, a sequence preference of the\norder of five per cent should not introduce error provided that the per-\ncentage of \" true cognitions \" is of the same or higher order. It is best,\nhowever, to be on the safe side and reduce the cyclical period as much as\npossible.\nIt remains to be seen how we can achieve in practice the required spread\nin T. It is difficult to make a device that fulfils the condition quoted and\nat the same time is sufficiently reliable. A device which is reliable in\noperation is usually also consistent in its timing and therefore has a low\nvalue of \" spread \". This applies particularly to electronic switching\nmethods.\n*\nThe reader should clearly distinguish the time-scales involved here.\nThe rapid succession of states, which may occur many times per second,\nare best produced electronically ; it is difiicult to control electronically the\ntiming of the making of the selection, which occurs only once every few\nseconds.\nThree devices seem to have been in use in the past. Tyrrell used a\nmanual method : the time T was the time that a key was held down\n\u2014\ni.e.\nwas of the order of ^ sec. In estimating the efficacy of this method, the\nmost unfavourable condition must be postulated ; that in which the ex-\nperimenter endeavours to make the times during which the key is held\ndown in successive trials as nearly as possible equal. Experiments on\nresponse times (Woodworth 1939) indicate that this method may give a\nvalue for AT zs low as x&th sec. It is clear that this is too small to give an\nadequately random selection with Tyrrell's Machine, for which t is xffth\nsec. An alternative method, which improves the position slightly, is to take\nfor T not the time of holding down the key but the time between the\noperation of the trial recorder for the previous guess, and the time the key\nis pressed for the new selection. This method is used in the writer's\nmachine, giving a time T of the order of a second or more.\nA fully automatic method is used by Redmayne. He uses the variability\nin the time of heating up of a Thermal Delay Switch to produce the varia-\ntion A T, in conjunction with two relays for resetting. The relays and the\nThermal Delay Switch turn each other on and off with a period determined\nby the heating time. The particular type of switch used (Bulgin) is rather\nerratic in its action, especially when adjusted to give a short repetition time.\nThis produces a large \" spread \", but in the writer's experience at the cost\nof reliability. It is liable to flicker at the moment of making or breaking\ncontact ; with high-speed recorders there is a possibility of double counts.\nWhile adequate for Redmayne's purposes, it would be unsuitable for\noperation at a higher speed.\nAlternative types of Thermal Delay Switch which are free from this\ndefect do not give a sufficiently high value of \" spread \".\nOne relay could if desired be replaced by a contact operated by the Trial\nCounter, so that the Repetition Time could be adjusted automatically to the\npercipient's requirements without the advantages of automatic control\nbeing lost.\nKendall's method probably gives the highest value for AT. The time\nT is the time taken for a condenser to charge to a given value (the flashing\npotential of a neon lamp). The charging resistance is a crisscross of pencil\n\f174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 217\nlines on a piece of paper ; the circuit is not completed till the operator\ntouches the pencil lines with a metallic pointer. As he moves the pointer\nacross the paper, the charging resistance varies in a random manner, and\nproduces the required variation AT m the charging time.\nThis method is, however, tedious to operate and, therefore, unsuitable\nfor E.S.P. investigation.\nAnother alternative, which the writer intends to try, is to use a contact\noperated by a clock. The type suggested is the Air Ministry type contactor\nmaster type 2 (10A\/10994). It makes a contact once per second for about\nI second, and seems to give a \" spread \" of i\/50th sec., which is adequate\nwhen used in conjunction with a sufficiently low cyclical period.\nRandom Variation in Motor Speed\nIf the switching time T remained absolutely regular [i.e. AT=o), and\nthe cyclical period (and motor speed) were made to vary in a random\nfashion, a random sequence would still be obtained. The cyclical period\nwould still have to be small in comparison with the interval T. We require\nthat the mean cyclical period, as measured over a time interval T, should\nhave no correlation with the mean cyclical period measured during the\ninterval T immediately succeeding. This requires a motor to be accelerated\nand retarded many times during the interval T, and this condition Red-\nmayne's machine does not fulfil. If this were the only factor in Redmayne's\nmachine producing randomness, very strong sequence preferences could\nbe expected.\nIf an electronic valve circuit is used, a random variation of cyclical\nperiod might be obtained in one of several ways. A simple method would\nbe to amplify the random voltages produced by thermal fluctuation in a\nhigh resistance or by a noise valve. Such a source has been used to simu-\nlate the random pulses which cause interference in radio sets (Licklider\n1947). An alternative, which would probably prove less reliable, is to use\nthe pulses obtained from a Geiger counter when counting the rays from\nsome radioactive material. This has been suggested as a method of obtain-\ning a random sample from a collection of punched cards (Vickery 1939).\nBoth are fundamentally good ways of obtaining a random sequence ;\nthe\nformer depends upon the random motion of a large sample of molecules\nand electrons (of the order of lo^^), and the latter depends upon the un-\ncertainty of radioactive decay. But caution should be observed : it is\npossible, by observing a random sequence in the wrong way, for it to appear\nto be a regular sequence. This occurs when the resolving time of the scaling\ncircuit or the band-width of the amplifier is inadequate. The matter is dis-\ncussed fully by Fiirth and MacDonald (1947). Nuclear physicists often\nhave a suitable apparatus already set up, and the writer has verified that\nsuch a system works well, and because of its great flexibility uses it for\ndemonstrating the principles of these devices.\nChangeover Time\nAnother important detail to be considered is the time taken by the\nmachine to change from one \" state \" to the next. There is a short tinie\nwhen the machine is, as it were, poised between two states ;\nif the motor is\n\f2l8 R. Wilson [Part\nstopped at that instant, there may be uncertainty as to which of the lamps\nis to be Ht. If this time varies sHghtly as between different pairs of states,\nand the variation is comparable with the cyclical period, then departure\nfrom randomness will be observed {e.g. one lamp will be. selected more\nfrequently than others). This effect occurs in all selectors from Roulette\nWheels onwards. During the changeover time the factors which otherwise\ndetermine the selection of the lamp are small, so that the selection may be\naffected by extraneous factors, such as irregularities of construction, the\ninertia of the motor and apparatus, etc.\nThe concept is most easily understood by reference to a particular\nmachine, for example in Redmayne's type.\nFig. I\nSuppose the five vanes occupy 60\u00b0 of the circle each, so that there is 12\u00b0\nof insulation between each pair. Then, if at the instant when the attracting\nmagnet stops the rotation of the selector, the magnet is over the insulator,\nwe cannot predict which lamp will be selected, since this will be affected\ncritically by small inequalities of the system. The effect will be further\nconsidered below in connection with the writer's machine.\nThe Writer's Electronic Selector\nThe writer's Selector makes use of an electronic valve circuit, extensively\nused in Nuclear Physics, called a Scaling Circuit. There are several types,\nwith various complications and frills, but basically the operation is simple.\nThe circuit has a number of positions of stable equilibrium, determined by\nwhether certain valves conduct heavily or not at all ; but on application of\nan external pulse the circuit changes to the next position.\nIn Nuclear Physics the circuits are used to produce one output pulse for\nevery, say, eight or ten, input pulses. This will occur whatever the rate of\narrival of the input pulses. It is used in particular for counting random\npulses which are arriving too fast to actuate directly a mechanical counter.\nInterpolating lamps are often arranged to indicate the intermediate\npositions of the circuit.\nIn the Selector built by the writer, the input pulses are of constant fre-\nquency and are provided by a Transitron oscillator. They are then applied\nthrough a switch to a Scaling Circuit with four states (a \" Scale of 4\nCounter \"), with four interpolating lamps. The oscillator is disconnected\nfrom the scaling circuit at a random instant by pressing a \" Selector Key \".\n\f174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 219\nThe scaling circuit remains in the state in which it happens to be at the\ninstant of pressing the Selector Key, and the corresponding lamp lights.\nA scale of four counter is used in preference to a scale of five (the number\nfive being traditional in E.S.P. experiments) because the electronic circuit\ninvolved is simpler. Reliable circuits have, however, been devised for any\nnumber of states (Lifschutz 1940). It might be an advantage to have a\nlarger number of choices than four, to decrease the chance successes, but\nthere would be a tendency to lose the motor response which makes this\ntype of experiment successful. In view of the increased complexity of an\nincreased number, it was not considered worth while to make provision for\nthis.\nThe oscillator frequency used is 3200 pulses per second. With four\nlamps, the cyclical period is i \/800th sec. and therefore a spread AT oi\ni\/200th sec. or more should produce a random sequence. The spread of\ni\/ioth sec. given by hand operation, or i\/soth sec. given by the Air\nMinistry contactor, should be satisfactory.\nThe changeover time is the time taken for a valve to pass from the\nnon-conducting to the fully conducting state. It cannot be greater than\nthe width of the pulse from the transitron, which, after sharpening, is of\nthe order of 10^^ seconds. This is negligible in comparison with the cyclical\nperiod i \/800th sec.\nThe circuit is described fully in Appendix II.\nAnother Possible Method of Random Selection\nAnother method of obtaining a random selection electronically was tried\nby the writer. Four biassed back thyratrons were arranged to be triggered\nrespectively by the phases of a four-phase A.C. supply. The phase\nwhich happens to be the most positive at the instant of switching on,\ntriggers the corresponding thyratron and lights a lamp.\nThis method was rejected because of the high changeover time, which\nrenders the circuit unduly sensitive to changes in bias voltage, and so pro-\nduces departures from randomness.\nOperation in E.S.P. Experiments\nThe operation of an electrical E.S.P. machine is quite simple. A de-\nscription of the operation of the writer's machine is given, but each type\nhas its own peculiarities.\nThe Selector is in a small portable box which contains also the recording\ncounters. The lamps are in a separate box on the end of a short lead from\nthe Selector. This box can be covered for use in clairvoyance tests, or\nobserved by an agent in telepathy tests. Over each lamp can be placed a\ntransparency bearing an appropriate symbol : cross, square, etc.\nThe percipient has a \" Guess-Box \" connected by a long lead to the\nSelector Box. On this box are mounted the four \" Guess Keys \" and the\n\" Selector Key \". The keys used in the prototype are telephone jack\nswitches, but button switches are to be used in the model under construction\nfor the S.P.R. The Guess-Box should be operated at a distance from the\nSelector, and the same precautions taken against hyperaesthesia etc. as in\n\f220 R. Wilson [Part\nother E.S.P. experiments. The experimenter should not relax his caution .|\nbecause he is using a machine.\nThe machine takes about thirty seconds to warm up, after which it\nshould be tested for randomness over ten or fifteen trials. Any defect\nshould be instantly observable at this stage : a failure of a valve, for ex-\nample, cause a complete breakdown, e.g. a failure of two of the lamps to be\nselected at all. A fault leading to only slight \" preferences \" is almost im-\npossible with this machine.\nBefore starting a run of trials, any one of the Guess Keys is pressed, so\nsetting the Selector in operation. The two Recording Counters are then\nread. The percipient presses the Selector Key, which makes a random\nselection, and lights one of the four lamps. He then presses one of the four\nGuess Keys, to guess which lamp is lit. The Counters automatically\ncount the number of guesses and the number of successes. The percipient\ncontinues, alternately pressing the Selector Key and one of the Guess Keys\ntill the end of the run, when the counters are again read giving the result\nof the experiment.\nIf it is desired to count a definite number, say twenty-five, of guesses,\nthe experimenter must watch the trial counter and stop the percipient or\nswitch off the machine when sufficient guesses have been made. It is a\nmajor disadvantage of the machine that no automatic provision is made for\nthis. In telepathy tests the agent sees the lamp selected by the machine\nbut plays no active role.\nIt is possible for the experimenter to alter certain conditions during the\nrun, e.g. to cover up the lamp box in order to change from telepathy to\nclairvoyance conditions without the percipient being aware of the fact by\nany normal means. .\nPrecognition Tests t\n\u00ab\nFor experiments in precognition, one switch is changed on the Selector\nBox, and another on the Guess-Box ; these cut out the Selector Key and\nthe selection is then made by auxiliary contacts on the Guess Keys. Since\nthe key has to be pressed by the percipient before the selection is made by\nthe machine, the guess is before the event and is truly precognitive. The\nonly possible alternative to precognition in producing correct guesses\nwould seem to be a P.K. faculty influencing the selection.\nClairvoyance Tests\nFor tests in absolute clairvoyance, it is desirable that no indication of the\nselection be made to any person at any time, in order that the possibility\nof precognitive telepathy (as suggested by Tyrrell) may be eliminated.\nIt is held by some that no indication even as to which particular guesses\nare successful should be given, and the machine is therefore designed to\nrecord only the total number of trials and of successes in a series.\nUnfortunately, the Success Counter used at present is somewhat noisy\nin action, although the sound is partially swamped by the simultaneous\noperation of the Trials Counter, and still gives an auditory indication of\nsuccess. A more silent counter might be employed ; but the only real safe-\nguard is to ensure that the counters are at a considerable distance from any-\n\f174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 221\none. A morse inker or other device recording individual guesses (as used\nby Tyrrell) is inadmissible.\nPrecautions against False Counts '\nRedmayne has considered possible causes of false counts in fair detail.\nHis device for preventing two keys from being pressed simultaneously has\nbeen adopted by the writer. This is a Trip Relay, which is of higher\nspeed than the Counters, and which operates on a current of 10 mA., but\nnot on 5 mA. When one key is pressed, a current of 5 mA. is passed through\nthe relay ; when two keys are pressed simultaneously, 10 mA. is passed\nthrough the relay, which therefore trips, and the Trip Relay Meter registers.\nThe run in progress must then be discarded ; this usually occurs the first\ntime the percipient has operated the machine, so unfortunately terminal\nsalience effects may be missed. A Trip Relay Reset Key is provided on the\nSelector Box to reset the instrument for the next run.\nAfter each guess the oscillator is automatically reconnected and the\nsupply voltage to the Counters cut off, so that only one guess can be made\nfor each selection. When an attempt is made to record a guess before the\nSelector Key has been pressed, the Trial Counter will operate but the\nSuccess Counter will not. This is an unfortunate feature of the apparatus,\nsince it will reduce the proportion of recorded successes ; but it is an\nerror on the right side, and it would require an additional relay to avoid it.\nRedmayne provides a device for precognitive trials to prevent guesses\nbeing made more frequently than one every two seconds. This is not\nnecessary in the writer's machine, because the hysteresis of the relay con-\ntacts prevents the oscillator from being connected for less than i\/50th sec.\nThis represents some sixteen cyclic periods, which is sufficient to ensure\nrandomness. This is another advantage of the high oscillator frequency.\nAnother possibility, not specifically mentioned by Redmayne, is that the\nGuess Key might \" make \" the various contacts at slightly different times ;\nthus, by pressing the key only lightly, it might be possible to operate the\nSuccess Counter and not the Trial Counter, or not to operate the Trip\nRelay contact. In order to obviate this possibility, the Guess Key contacts\nhave been arranged to operate in the following order : {a) Trip Relay con-\ntact ;\n{b) contact making selection (in precognition tests only) ;\n(c) contact\nconnecting the Success Counter to the appropriate circuit ; and {d) the\ncontact actuating (simultaneously) the two counters. The order {b) or (c)\nis inimaterial.\nIt is inVportant that the Trial Counter should not take longer to operate\nthan the Success Counter, otherwise, again, it might be possible, by flicking\nthe key quickly, to operate the Success Counter and not the Trial Counter.\nResults so far Obtained\nVarious percipients have been tested for various forms of E.S.P. with\nthis machine. The writer scored significantly at first but the effect de-\nclined to zero after 4,000 trials. Two others have given strong positive re-\nsults. All these experiments have been exploratory : the precautions\nagainst false counts were not all in operation when they were carried out.\n\f222 R. Wilson [Part\nFurther experiments with the same, percipients will be carried out as\nopportunity occurs.\nSome statistical tests of the randomness of the machine are given in\nAppendix III.\nAPPENDIX I\n' '\nMathematical Analysis of the Conditions for Randomness\nSuppose the system changes from one state to the next times per second.\nIf there are n states, each state is traversed \u2014 times per second, so that the\nn\nn\ncyclical period ^ = Suppose the time the motor is running for each\nselection is T seconds.\nThen during the time T the system will have changed its state p times,\nwhere p is the nearest integer below TN. It will come to rest at the ^'th\nstate, where q is the remainder after dividing p by n.\nNow if T is the same for each trial, the lamps will come on in regular\nsequence, each time moving to the ^'th lamp counting from the lamp lit in\nthe previous trial. For a random selection, T must be slightly different for\nsuccessive trials. Suppose that the frequency of occurrence of a value T\nis distributed about a nriean value T with a Gaussian distribution. (This is\na reasonable approximation and a convenient way of specifying numerically\nthe spread of the values : but it is not valid if the spread is of the order of T\nitself.)\nThe frequency V is then given by an equation j =3^0 . e~(^~^)*\/''\\\nLet the width of this curve for values of y at half the maximum he AT :\nthen we require zl T to be large compared with t, in order that the proba-\nbilities of q having values from i to \u00ab may be equal to within the required\naccuracy. If this is so, the probabilities of selection of the several states\nwill be equal.\nThis analysis assumes that each value of q is obtained from one range of\nvalues of T at the top of the error curve. In fact each value of q can be\nobtained from a number of ranges of values of T distributed on either side\nof the error curve ; but provided that the above condition is satisfied, the\nranges on opposite sides of the curve will roughly cancel each other in their\neffects, and the method therefore gives a sufficiently close approximation\nfor our present purpose.\nThe value of T for half maximum is given by putting y\/y^ = \\ . This\ngives {T-Xy^a^ AoggZ.\ni.e. {ATjzy = log,2 .\n:.AT = aj2^ = l-6-]G.\nSuppose we put the requirement that the probabilities for each lamp\nshall be equal to within i per cent.

The Selector will show a definite sequence habit, or, in a\nspecial case, just repeat the same lamp. If J T is too low, a deviation from\nrandomness will be observed, in the form of sequence preferences. There\nwill be a tendency to shift from one sequence to another : thus, with four\nlamps, we might have 131312424313242413134...\nThis will clearly lead to the same mean expectation for each lamp as a\npurely random sequence ; the standard deviation will, however, be\nincreased. ,\n.\nAPPENDIX II\nDescription of the Circuit of the Writer's Machine\nThe scaling circuit used in the prototype (Fig. ii) uses a pentode trigger\npair (Reich 1938). Vi, a transitron oscillator, generates negative pulses at\nthe suppressor grid, which are sharpened by the differentiator circuit C3\nR6, giving a pulse-width of about 2 micro-seconds, and a \" time of rise\n\"\nof less than \\ micro-second. They are then fed through a contact of the\nrelay P3 to the grids of the first trigger pair V2 V3. These are so biassed\nthat only one of the two valves can conduct : an input pulse cuts off both\nvalves, and at the end of the input pulse the valve which was originally\nnon-conducting draws current, and the two valves have changed places.\nThe pair has been \" triggered \". At the next input pulse, the pair triggers\nback again.\nAt alternate input pulses, therefore, positive and negative pulses are\npassed to the next trigger pair V4V5. The positive pulses have no effect,\nbut the negative pulses trigger the pair.\nThe trigger valves V2V3V4V5 operate the lamps through the relays\nP1P2. The relays cannot be inserted directly into the trigger circuits\nwithout upsetting the operation, so an isolating valve V6 is incorporated.\nIt will be seen that there are four states of stable equilibrium of the sys-\ntem, and the following cycle of events occurs on receipt of successive input\npulses.\nInitially V2 V4 conduct ; Pi off, P2 off.\nAfter I St pulse V3 V4 conduct ; Pi on, P2 off.\nAfter 2nd pulse V2 V5 conduct ; Pi off, P2 on.\nAfter 3rd pulse V3 V5 conduct ; Pi on, P2 on.\nAfter the fourth pulse the system returns to the original state. By the\narrangement of relay contacts shown, each state corresponds to the lighting\nof one indicator lamp.\nWhen the oscillator is connected to the Scaling Circuit, the relays cannot\nfollow the rapid change of state. To prevent a buzz, which wears out the\nrelay contacts, condensers Cjg, are placed across the relays.\n\f\f174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 225\nOn de-energising P3, the contact is broken, and the oscillator is discon-\nnected from the Scaling Circuit, which remains in the state in which it hap-\npens to be at the instant of breaking contact, and the appropriate lamp is\nselected. During the time that the Scaling Circuit is changing its state, it\nis undesirable that any lamp should be lit, and the lamps and counters\nare therefore switched off by means of another contact of P3.\nThe power pack is conventional, and in addition to supplying L.T. and\nH.T. for the valves, supplies 35 v. D.C. for the counters and lamps, by\nconnection of a rectifier between the taps in the primary of the mains\ntransformer. .\nGuessing and Recording Circuit\nThe switches S^, S2, S3, S4 are the four Guess Keys. Each has four con-\ntacts A, B, C, D. These are adjusted to work in the order A, B or C. D,\nSwitch S5, the Selector Key, has two contacts, A and B, which operate in\nthat order.\nContact A of all five switches operates the trip relay P4. This relay is\nadjusted so that it will trip with a resistance oi i \\ kw. in series but not with\na resistance of 3 kw. in series, so if two keys are pressed simultaneously,\nthe relay will trip, providing an alternative path to keep P4 closed after the\nkeys are released, and passing a current through the indicating meter.\nContact B of the guess and selector keys, de-energises the relay P3.\nThe relay is energised by the selector key for direct trials, and by the guess\nkey for precognitive trials. For direct trials the selection remains on re-\nlease of the key, but for precognition trials the instrument is made ready\nfor the next selection on release of the key.\nP3 disconnects the oscillator from the scaling circuit, as already described,\nthus making the selection, and applies the voltage to the lamps and counters.\nOn making a guess contact C operates before contact D ; contact C con-\nnects the success counter to the appropriate circuit, but neither counter\ncan operate till contact D is made.\nThe operation of the trial counter prepares the instrument for another\nselection when operated for direct trials.\nCondensers C16 C17 C19 C20 are inserted in order to prevent switching\nsurges caused by the relays breaking the counter circuits. These pulses\nmay otherwise cause spurious operation of the scaling circuit, and cause\nfalse results.\nSg and S7 switch from direct operation to precognitive operation.\n,\nAPPENDIX III\nStatistical Analysis of the Selection\nTest for Sequence Preferences.\nThe first thousand numbers selected by the machine, were tested in the\nusual way (Soal 1937). A number was arbitrarily assigned to each lamp,\nand the sequence of lamps lit was taken down by hand. They were then\narranged in a ring, and the number of times that the lamp r follows the\n\fR. Wilso7t [Part\n3\no\ntn\na\n\u20223\no\no\n-a\nc\nTO\nM\nc\n3\no\nd\nc\no\n\f174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 227\nlamp ^ was counted. These sixteen numbers were arranged in a 4 x 4\narray as follows :\n\"\nY\nT\nX 3 4\nI 71 59 64 62 256\n2 63 53 60 59 235\n3 62 65 69 63 260\n4 60 57 67 65 249\nTotal 256 235 260 249 1000\nThe mean expectation for each of these numbers is\n62J. On analysis it\nis found that = 5- There are four linear relations between these sixteen\nnumbers \u00ab\u201e, so there are 16-4 = 12 degrees of freedom. The probability\nof exceeding this chance deviation is 0*95.\nTest for Frequencies.\nA more sensitive test for frequencies can be made by considering the\ndeviations of the totals for each lamp from the mean. These deviations\nare : 6, - 15, 10, - i. The standard deviation is 14, so that none of these\ndeviations are significant.\nTest for Repeats.\nLet the number of occasions any one lamp is lit x times in succession be\nSj.. Then the observed values for S^; can be compared with the expected\nvalues for a chance distribution. The comparison is shown below :\nObserved Expected\nS5 2 2\n84' 5 9\nS3 not 35\nS2 computed 140.5\nS2 + 2S3 + 3S4+4S5+ 258 250\nThis is a sufficiently close agreement.\nFurther Tests.\nFurther tests are made from time to time for frequencies alone, by count-\ning automatically the total number of selections made, and the number of\nselections of one individual lamp. Also a system for testing sequence pre-\nferences using the automatic counters, has been devised ; this depends\nupon the eifect discovered by G. W. Fisk (Tyrrell 1936). The tester\noperates the guess buttons, continually pressing the same button till a\nsuccess is scored. He then changes to the next lamp till he scores a success\nwith that lamp ; and so on. With a deficiency of \" repeats \" this gives a\nhigher probability of success. With too many repeats a lower probability\nis obtained, and with sequence preferences, the probabilitity is either\nhigher or lower, depending on the sequence.\nWhen testing automatically, the machine is usually tested in runs of 100\nto enable comparisons to be made between runs, and to make sure there\nI\nare no faults of short duration. Sometimes 10 1 trials were made by mis-\n\f\f174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 229\ntake. In order to avoid wasting these readings, the percentage of successes\nwas taken as the score.\nThe number of successes for each run of 100, for all methods of testing,\nwas tabulated. 157 runs were included. The frequency of occurrence\nvof a score x was plotted against x. The expected value of ^ is given by\nthe formula\nwhere ^^^C^ is the coefficient of p'' in the expansion of ( i +py\u00b0^.\nThe agreement is shown in Fig. 4.\nThere is a large preponderance of the value a; = 25. This is not signifi-\ncant, since it is the only large deviation in the table, and it is only worth\nI\nmention in case some plausible non-chance hypothesis can be found to\nexplain it.\nReferences\nFiirth and MacDonald (1947). \" Statistical analysis of spontaneous\nelectrical fluctuations.\" Proceedings of the Physical Society, 59, 388.\nKendall and Babington Smith (1939). \" Randomness and Random\nSampling Numbers.\" Journal Royal Statistical Society, loi, 147.\n(1939), Ibid.

Drayton Thomas\nIn the winter of 1930, my aunt Margaret residing at Tenterden, wrote that\nshe wished to give me a volume of Byron's poems which had belonged to\nmy grandfather and contained marginal notes in his handwriting.\nTo the best of my belief this was the first time I had heard of this annotated\nbook ;\nknowing how interested my father had been in his father's literary\nwork, I took occasion at the next sitting to mention the expected gift,\nhoping that it might be made the subject of an experiment. My father re-\nmarked \" I wonder if Grandfather will remember anything about his notes \",\nAt my sitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard on December 24th, 1930, my\nuncle Alfred (aunt Margaret's husband) speaking through Feda (the Con-\ntrol) said:\n\" Do you say Aunt is giving you one book? I thought she was giving\nyou two. There was something in her mind that suggested you were to\nhave two books . . . See if she has put in it the page which used to be\nkept in that book and could be slipped in and out.\"\nAfter some remarks about the book, he added :\n\" Tennyson\u2014has this book been placed near the Works of Tennyson?\nor has Aunt been thinking a good deal about Tennyson lately? I get the\nthoughts so mixed\u2014Tennyson and Byron ;\nyou might try to unravel this.\"\nA few days later I visited Tenterden and, having exchanged greetings\nwith my aunt, immediately asked to see her books. This I did lest she\nshould bring the Byron to me and thus prevent my ascertaining what books\nhad stood near it. I was not familiar with the house, into which my aunt\nhad recently removed, and did not know where her books were kept.\nMy aunt led me into a room which I do not remember to have previously\nentered and pointed to a shelf on which stood some forty volumes. The\nByron was only one-quarter of an inch distant from a volume of Tennyson's\nComplete Works, the two books being separated only by a thin manuscript.\nI confess to a feeling of surprise on seeing this, but that surprise was\nincreased by my aunt's next words. She said, \" During Christmas I\nwished to find Tennyson's lines, '\nRing out wild bells ', and could not find\nthem.\" I found the page for her and, while she was reading it, thought\nover this double fulfilment of the test. Alfred had spoken of two thoughts\nor ideas mingled\u2014Tennyson and Byron. Those names had, as I now heard,\nbeen in my aunt's thought recently ; and not only so, but the Works of\nthose poets were standing side by side on her shelf. This would account\nfor the uncertainty as to whether the linking together of the two poets was\ndue to the position of their books or to thoughts in Margaret's mind.\nMy aunt now took the Byron from the shelf and placed it in my hands,\nand next she found a volume of Whittier asking if I would accept that also.\nIt was then that I recalled Alfred's remark that he thought Aunt proposed\ngiving me two books, as he had found something in her mind to that effect.\n230\n\f[Part 174] The Volume of Byron : A Significant Book-Test 231\nThus he had rightly interpreted two different thoughts, one relating to\nTennyson and the other to the gift of a second book.\nThis indicates cognisance of facts both physical and mental. My com-\nmunicator had not only found the position of books on a shelf, but had\nbeen aware of thoughts and intentions in Margaret's mind.\nFurther descriptive statements about the Byron book had been made at\nthe sitting :\n\" Inside are two coloured sheets, as if the paper were of two qualities.\nOn opening the book you distinctly see this deeper shade.\"\nThis I found correct : the first and last pages are brown, and made of\npaper different in quality from the rest of the book.\n\" Alfred has an idea that this book has illustrations. He remembers\nsomething of them.\"\nThe Byron had been in Alfred's keeping after my grandfather's death.\nThis statement about illustrations proved to be correct ; there were two\npictures in the book as published, and a third, showing Byron as a youth,\nhad been pasted inside the cover.\nI now come to what proved to be the most interesting remark of all.\n'\n\" Has she put the page in? Do you mind looking to see? There used\nto be something kept in the book that could be slipped in and out. He\nhas forgotten what it was, but wonders if it is still there.\"\nWhile standing by the bookshelf and turning the pages of the Byron, I\nnoticed something which might have been intended by this remark. It\nlooked like a sheet of paper gummed in position between two pages. I\nhastily closed the book without examining this leaf ; because it occurred\nto me that I could ask for further information about it at a subsequent\nsitting.\nTaking the Byron home I put it away and did not look at it again until\nfurther information had been given about this special page.\nAt my next sitting Grandfather was said to be present and giving the\nfollowing. I state the items singly, adding to each the verification dis-\ncovered when examining the book at home.\nI began by asking if Grandfather would speak about his Byron.\nFeda : There was a loose page and he thinks it was not quite the same\nsize as the other pages. There was quite a dissimilarity, different texture\nand class of paper too. It did not seem to belong and yet it was there . . .\nIf you felt its surface you would know at once that it was not really part of\nthe book.\nA perfectly correct statement. This added page is smaller than the\nothers, different in shade and texture, and feeling irregular to the touch\nwhere two pieces of paper had been gummed over the original surface.\nFeda : Grandfather's impression was that this page had been creased or\nfolded. He thinks you will find it so.\nThis, too, is correct. There is a deep crease running from top to bottom,\nowing to the page having been cut from a double sheet of previously used\nsermon paper and still showing the original centre fold.\n\f232 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nFeda : This is important : there are hnes going the opposite way to\nthose in the book. Something on the paper makes you feel it ought to be\nthe other way about.\nThis is so ; the writing of the notes is horizontal, whereas the original\nsermon writing runs perpendicularly.\nI then asked if Grandfather knew what was on the paper and why it had\nbeen inserted. The answer was :\nFeda : Yes, he knows. There should be something on it which is not\nstrictly connected with the book. Something is, but something is not.\nHe thinks there is something on that paper which will indicate to you\nsomething different from Byron.\nI found both sides of the inserted page covered with historical notes\nabout Napoleon, while such words of the original sermon as are visible\nrefer to Babylon and the Pope.\nWe now come to the final and most important remark :\nFeda : I wonder whether he had numbered the page ; for there is some- 'i\nthing in his mind about a number. He thinks when you look at it you will\nsay, \" I wonder why this was put in here.\"\nThis conveyed nothing to me. It must be remembered that I had\nnot examined this inserted page. The momentary glimpse when the book\nwas first placed in my hands had shown merely a sheet of paper with\nwriting on it. I had instantly closed the book so that I might obtain no\ninformation. This left the way clear for further inquiry ; it seemed\npossible that if Grandfather had thought it sufficiently important to add a\npage, he might recollect his reason for doing so. When, after this final\nsitting, I came to scrutinise the page I was considerably puzzled. As\nalready remarked, the leaf had been cut from a double page of writing paper, .\none side of which was originally covered in my grandfather's handwriting\nby sermon material. I can read, for instance, the words \" Babylonian\npunishment . . . Pope Adrian VI and the Catholic Princes . . . Downfall of\nancient Babylon.\" The side of the sheet on which this sermon was written\nis almost completely covered by two pieces of paper which have been\ngummed over it. These, together with the reverse, are filled with historical\nnotes about Napoleon, his battles and the condition of France at that\nperiod.\nHaving satisfied myself about the contents of this inserted leaf I pro-\nceeded to read the pages of Byron between which it was affixed. And it*\nwas indeed a puzzle why it had been inserted there. The leaf stands be- -\ntween pages 558 and 559, and the headings of those pages are, Windsor ;\nPoetic Stanzas for Music ; Address intended to be recited on the Cale-\ndonian Meeting ; Fragments of an Epistle to Mr. Thomas Moore ; Con-\nsolatory Address to Sarah, the Countess of Jersey.\nWhy then had this leaf been placed amid such irrelevant material? I\ncould not say. Following a hint given in the sitting I examined the in-\nserted page for a number.

This page numbered 560 had been inserted by mistake be-\ntween 558 and 559. I therefore turned to see in what company it would\nhave been if placed overleaf, and I found that it would then have been in its\nright place, facing the poem, Napoleon's Escape from Elba, and another\nentitled Ode to the French.\nLet us sum up the information so correctly given :\n1. The Byron and Tennyson were standing close together.\n2. A second book was to be given me.\n3. My aunt had been recently thinking of Tennyson.\n4. The Byron volume had two pages of a colour different from the rest,\nalso illustrations, and an inserted special page.\n5. One page was of a size different from those of the book and of\nanother texture. (This I had probably noticed on first finding it and it may\ntherefore be disregarded as evidence).\n6. It had been creased or folded.\n7. Some of its writing ran in a direction other than that of the book\n\u2014\n8. and alluded to a subject not strictly connected with Byron.\n9. Examination would raise the question why it had been placed in its\npresent position.\n10. There was, or should be, a number written on this page.\nOne cannot think that such information, some of it relating to notes\nwritten sixty years previously, could have been discovered by the medium's\npsychic faculty, and most certainly it was not discovered by me. I had\nknown nothing of these facts, and it is highly improbable that the majority\nof them would ever have been noticed but for my following up the reference\nto a special page and the hint that it was inserted in the wrong place. The\nonly explanation that seems acceptable is the one given in the sitting ;\nnamely, that this evidence was devised and carried through by the memory\nand observation of my grandfather, assisted by my father and by Alfred,\nin whose possession the book had been.\nSurveying the above material we find Memory, Telepathy and Sight.\nMemory. It is an instance of memory by one who left earth some 60\nyears previously. This is not uncommon in first-class sittings. It in-\ndicates that memory is independent of the material brain, although so\nclosely associated with it in our mundane experience. The claim of com-\nmunicators that their present non-material body includes a non-material\nbrain, suggests that even now man's etherial counterpart, which is said to\ninterpenetrate his physical body, is essential to the exercise of intelligence\nand memory.\nTelepathy. The ascertaining by the communicator of thoughts and in-\ntention in my aunt's mind may be classed with mind-reading or telepathy\nas known to us in spontaneous or experimental cases ;\nthough how it takes\nplace is unknown.\nClairvoyant sight. The ascertaining of the position of the Byron book\nby the side of Tennyson's Works would appear to be an example of clair-\nvoyance. And the weight of evidence points to that clairvoyance having\nbeen exercised by the communicator rather than by the medium or her\ncontrol. Grant that the communicator visited Tenterden to make his ob-\nservations, one asks. How did he see the titles and position of the two books\nstanding together on that book-shelf? This question about sight and per-\n\f234 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nception always faces us in book-test experiments ; for that something tanta-\nmount to sight has been employed is evident from the accurate description\nso frequently given.\nRemarks by communicators on this subject may be thus summed up :\nSometimes they can see physical objects clearly, but at other times not\n;\nmy father says he has occasionally revisited a room to verify or extend his\nprevious observations and found that he could now see practically nothing.\nTheir vision for material objects depends on the presence of a psychic\nemanation, similar to, or possibly identical with, that which Feda (Mrs\nLeonard's control) terms \" the power \". This emanation would seem to be\na go-between substance which is sufficiently akin to the Other World sub-\nstance to be employable by our visitants, despite its earthly origin. It\nfacilitates, or makes possible, the processes of communication, and its\ngradual exhaustion towards the end of a sitting progressively hinders re-\nsults. A control is able to see all objects and persons within the area im-\npregnated by this emanation. It would therefore seem that, while not itself\nluminous, the emanation makes visible to discarnates anything within its\narea. Hence the reason why mediums are often alluded to as \" the light \".\nSince much evidence exists for communicators having perceived events\nand material objects in one's home, it seems that this emanation, in small\nquantities, is given off by ordinary people. Hence, in the case under con-\nsideration, we may suppose that my aunt's constant presence in her sitting-\nroom had provided sufficient traces of the emanation to enable Alfred to\nperceive the juxtaposition of the books.\nCommunicators say that their etherial senses are adjusted to the realms\nwhich they now inhabit but not to our material world ; hence it may well\nbe, as they assert, that some are better able than others to surmount the\ndifficulties of observing physical objects and that, as with ourselves, some\ncan exercise clairvoyance for material things while others entirely fail to do\nso despite persistent endeavours.\nConsiderable experience of proxy cases, in which unknown communica-\ntors came to my sittings to give evidential material for their friends on\nearth, has shown that some do well, others indifferently, while others com-\npletely fail. (See my article on Proxy Cases, S.P.R. Proceedings for May,\n1933. P- 140-). .\nThe probability is that my grandfather, after completing this particular\npage of notes, left it in the Byron at the appropriate place ; that he sub-\nsequently deemed it better to fasten it there and inadvertently fixed it on\nthe wrong side of the right page. This mistake he may have noticed after-\nwards and seen no need to rectify, since the notes were for his use alone.\nBut how can this be harmonised with Alfred's reference to something\nwhich \" used to be kept in the book and could be slipped in and out\nsomething which he queried if I should find still there? The explanation\ncame later, when, some months after these sittings, my cousin, the son of\nAlfred and Margaret, visited us. While telling him of this book test I\nplaced the Byron in his hands, indicating the special page above described.\nAfter looking at it he turned over the leaves and finally found the \" loose\npage \" of which his father had spoken, one that could be \" slipped in and\nout.\" Tfiis was a double sheet of exceedingly thin, blue writing paper, and\nwas entirely covered by our grandfather's handwriting\u2014some twenty\n\f174] The Volume of Byron : A Significant Book-Test 235\nquotations from poets ancient and modern embodying ideas and phrases\nwhich Byron had used in his works.\nThis was something entirely different from my grandfather's description\nand evidently not the page which he had so minutely recollected. It\nwould seem therefore that, while Alfred had remembered the loose page\nof blue paper, my grandfather had recollected another, one which he had\ncarelessly gummed between the wrong pages, or rather on the wrong side\nof the right page of his Byron!\nIn this test we find three communicators successively taking their several\nparts. First my father, who questions whether his father will be able to\nremember anything about his notes. Secondly, my uncle, who recalls\nseveral facts about the volume which he had treasured after his father's\ndeath, and who referred to a \" loose page \" which could be slipped in and\nout. Thirdly, with my father came my grandfather, who, ignoring the\nloose blue page, spoke of another which he had better cause to remember,\nsince he had fastened it in its wrong position. In giving his description of\nthis he relied entirely on memory, having refused the opportunity of in-\nspecting the volume in my study. That his recollection should have been\nso accurate after the lapse of some sixty years is remarkable.\nRecords from Sittings relating to the Byron Book\nDecember ^th, 1930. My father controlling.\nC. D. T. : I often wonder what Grandfather is doing now.\nJ. D. T. : He is leading a very satisfactory life and active in matters con-\nnected with earth.\nC. D. T. : Especially with the Churches?\nJ. D. T. : Yes, and also in spiritualism, especially the growth of spiritual\ncharacter. If that comes through psychical research, then Grandfather\nwill be interested in that ; but he helps everything which he thinks will\nopen the mind to the spiritual. He is interested in the welfare and pro-\ngressive work of the Church, and in so far as he thinks psychic research\nwill help the ministry generally, he works for it.\nC. D. T. : Aunt Margaret writes that she has found Grandfather's old\nedition of Byron in which he had written marginal notes ; and she offers to\ngive it to me.\nJ. D. T. : I think, Charlie, that will be very interesting. I wonder if he\nwill remember anything at all about his notes.\nC. D. T. : They would probably seem very unimportant to him now,\nsomething like our school spelling book would be to us.\nJ. D. T. : It is all very difficult ;\nthings that seemed so very important\nwhen we were children we simply don't take the trouble to remember in\nadult life ; and so with much that seemed important on earth. If we are\ncoming back for purposes of identification we try to remember them, but it\nmust be difficult for some people to do so.\nC. D. T. : And yet I understood that your memory on that side is per-\nfect!\nJ. D. T. : We could do it, but we don't waste time ; we remember those\nthings which are vital to us now. The mere fact that we can remember\ncertain things does not make us remember them. We should only recall\nthose unnecessary things for purposes of identification.\n\f236 ,\n. C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nC. D. T. : So recollection with you, as with us, is an act of will?\nJ. D. T. : Certainly, else the whole thing would have to be written on\none page and one would have to see every word of it at one glance. The\ndifferent things and remembrances of life are on different pages, and we\ncan turn them more easily than you can. So many of your pages are stuck\ntogether.\nDecember z^th, 1930. The communicator is my Uncle Alfred, Aunt\nMargaret's husband.\nFeda : Uncle Alfred is here.\nC. D. T. : I am hoping to visit Aunt shortly. She has promised to give\nme Grandfather's volume of Byron.\nFeda: Do you say she is going to give you one book.? I thought she was\ngiving you two.\nC. D. T. : She only mentioned one.\nFeda : Of course, if she only gives you one you can't say, \" You were\ngoing to give me two,\" but perhaps you can somehow ascertain. There\nwas something in her mind that suggested that you were to have two books.\nAnd, Oh! has she put the page in? Do you mind looking to see if she has\nput it in? There used to be something kept in the book that could be\nslipped in and out. He has forgotten just what it was, but he wonders if it\nis still there. Inside the book are two coloured sheets, as if the paper was\neither of two qualities or faded and tinted a little ; on opening the book you\ndistinctly see this deeper shade.\nC. D. T. : It will be interesting to look for that, because I have never yet\nseen the book.\nFeda : Uncle Alfred has an idea that this book has illustrations ; he re-\nmembers something of them. Byrons are not usually illustrated. So\nnotice that. He would like you to.\nWait a minute. Tennyson, has it been put near works of Tennyson, or\nhas Aunt been thinking a good deal of Tennyson lately, or has Aunt got\nthem mixed up ? They are very dissimilar, but I got the thoughts so mingled\n\u2014Tennyson and Byron. You might try and unravel this, would you?\nC. D. T. : Yes, I will remember that when I go to see Aunt Margaret.\nFeda : Your father says that Uncle Alfred is not so much in touch with\nAunt as he, your father, is with your mother and with you. But Alfred has\nbeen with Aunt recently in the hope that you would be seeing her. And\nAlfred was very good about some things.\nJanuary 2,0th, My grandfather communicating.\nFeda: Your grandfather has come.\nC. D. T. : Is he going to speak about his Byron?\nFeda : There was a loose page and he thinks it was not quite the same\nsize as the other pages. There was quite a dissimilarity, and was it not of a\ndifferent texture, a different class of paper too? It did not seem to belong,\nand yet it was there. It was just placed in, but did not really belong to it.'\nIf you felt its surface you would know at once that it was not really part of\nthe book.\nHad it got creased or folded? Grandfather's impression was that it had\nbeen creased or folded, and he thinks you will find it so.\n\f174] The Volume of Byron : A Significant Book-Test 237\nNow this is important ; he says \" Hnes going the opposite way to 'the\nbook, something on the paper makes you feel it ought to be the other way\nabout.\" He can't get it any better than that.\nWould you see if something is sUghtly uneven near to the edge of the\nloose page, not quite perfect and square cut.\nYour father is glad that Grandfather has said those things about it, else\nit might have seemed as if an ordinary page had broken loose, which was\nnot the case. Grandfather did not wish to leave that impression; and he\nthinks of nothing else at the moment.\nC. D. T. : Does he know what was on that paper and why it was placed\nin the book?\nFeda : Yes, he knows. There should be something on it which is not\nstrictly connected with the book. Something is, but something is not.\nHe thinks there is something on that paper which will indicate to you\nsomething different from Byron.\nI wondered whether he had numbered the page ; for there is something\nin his mind about a number. He thinks that when you look at it you will\nsay, \" I wonder why this was put in here.\" It is long ago and he can't at\nthis moment quite recollect it himself. That is all he recalls.\nC. D. T. : Are these recollections from olden days, or have you looked\nup these items?\nFeda ;\nNo, this is recollection. He would be afraid to try picking this\nup in your study. Your father suggested that, but Grandfather preferred\nnot to try ; he said he would only go back in his memory.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nPART 175\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS\n1948\nBy W. H. Salter\nMy sense of the great honour which the Council have done me in placing\nmy name on the distinguished roll of Presidents of this Society, would be\noverwhelming, if I did not regard it, as I am sure I may, as a tribute to\nthe work done for the Society by all who from its foundation have held the\noffice of Hon. Secretary, and particularly by such of my predecessors in\nthat office as through early death or other accident of circumstance never\nsat in the Presidential Chair. I would ask you then to bear in honoured\nand grateful memory today the names of Edmund Gurney, one of our\nFounders and the principal author of the first classic of our subject.\nPhantasms of the Living ; Frank Podmore, whose chief book is still, after\nmore than forty years, the best account of the early history of psychical\nresearch ; and Everard Feilding, in his own line the best investigator that\nthe Society has known.\nIt would be fitting, when remembering them, to recall to mind also\nRichard Hodgson, for many years Secretary of the American Branch, as\nit then was, and Alice Johnson, whose long service to psychical research\nincluded work as Secretary, Editor and Research Officer. How much\nrather would I now be listening to a Presidential Address from any of\nthem, than launching out on one of my own!\nWidely as they differed in opinion, on one matter they would have been\nunited, namely in affirming that their individual efforts in psychical\nresearch\u2014distinguished as these were\u2014gained immensely in effectiveness\nfrom being part of an organised, corporate activity. They would one and\nall have repudiated any suggestion that the time and experience they so\nfreely gave to the administrative side of the Society's work, humdrum as\nmuch of that is, were in any sense wasted.\nIt is a great advantage for any study, whatever the subject, to have the\nsupport of an established Society with good prospects of future continu-\nance, a Society which can provide funds for research and publication,\nmaintain a library and give those engaged in the study opportunities to\nmeet and discuss their work. For a study not closely connected with any\nacademic curriculum or professional interest the backing of such a Society\nis almost indispensable.\nPsychical research is in that detached position now, and likely to remain\nQ 239\n\f240 W. H. Salter [Part\nthere for some time to come, nor in my opinion should we regret it. On\nthe contrary, no worse fate could, I believe, befall psychical research than\nfor it to become a sub-division of some more orthodox branch of learning,\nor for it to lose its independence too soon, before it has more completely\nexploited its own domain, and before there is a better understanding of\nits problems and methods in those provinces of science on which it abuts.\nIt was only because psychical research from the start claimed to be an\nautonomous study that men and women trained in many different\nbranches of learning\u2014philosophy and scholarship, as well as science in its\nmore restricted meaning\u2014and with varied experience of life, were able\nto unite for its advancement on an equal footing, and to contribute that\nwealth of knowledge and thought drawn from many sources, from which\nour enquiries have profited.\nThe psychical researcher cannot be an expert in all the branches of\nspecialised knowledge that from time to time his enquiries may demand.\nOne and the same man cannot reasonably be expected to be a fully qualified\nphysicist, psychologist, statistician, conjurer, doctor and photographer on\nsuccessive days of the week. If he knows what expert to consult on each\noccasion, and how to employ the technical knowledge that expert can give\nhim, he has the proper equipment, so far as concerns the auxiliary technique\nof his subject. But in one thing he must be himself a specialist all the\ntime, and that is psychical research, and only by the practice of psychical\nresearch can he become a specialist in it. If in addition he has specialised\nknowledge of any of the other subjects above mentioned, so much the\nbetter. One of the advantages of a Society such as ours, which draws its\nmembers from so many walks of life, is that the investigator can find within\nour own ranks someone skilled in almost every auxiliary technique he is\nlikely to need.\nIt is for psychical research, not only in this country, but wherever it is\npursued as an impartial enquiry, that autonomy is claimed. We may,\nhowever, fairly congratulate ourselves that our Society has contributed a\nvery large share to those achievements by which that claim can be justified.\nThat it has the longest unbroken history of all Societies engaged in the\nsame enquiry is partly due to world events, which have been less unkind\nto our country than to many others, but partly, I like to think, to that\n\" uncompromising matter-of-factness \" of the English mind, whose func-\ntion our first President, Henry Sidgwick, suggested would be \" to put the\nfinal question to the Universe with a solid passionate determination to be\nanswered that must come to something \".\nWe should, however, temper our insular pride by the reflection that\nour membership has included men and women of distinction from many\nlands, and that for about sixteen years (1889- 1905) the American Society\nand our own were united, facts which should be borne in mind in consider-\ning our Society's record.\nI ask you to note how much of the Society's achievement is due to\ncorporate effort and organisation. First to be mentioned are the spon-\ntaneous cases, apparitions and the like. The systematic collection and\nanalysis of these was a new venture, initiated at Cambridge and taken up\nsoon after at Oxford, by groups of friends of whom some took the lead in\nfounding the Society, and others joined it shortly after its foundation.\n\f175] Presidential Address 241\nThe first fruits of their labours are to be sought in Phantasms. A fev\\^\nyears later the Census of Hallucinations was undertaken on the recom-\nmendation of an International Committee, and cases were collected fti\nseveral countries. The organisation, however, was entrusted to the S.P.R.,\nwhich followed up enquiries, tabulated the cases and was responsible for\nthe Report. But it was not merely the machinery for conducting the\nCensus that the Society provided. Much of the value of these cases\n\u2014\nand the same is true of the large number collected in the half-century\nthat has passed since the Report was published\u2014is due to the fact that a\nhighly competent Committee set up standards of evidence which were\nimpersonal, and not framed to meet the subjective peculiarities of any\nindividual mind.\nNext in time comes the investigation of Mrs Piper, beginning of course\nin America, but continued by the joint labours of British and ^\\merican\ninvestigators, who worked together so closely and so harmoniously, that\nit would be absurd to partition the credit between them. We may, how-\never, claim for the Society the glory of having produced, in Mrs Sidgwick's\nstudy of Mrs Piper, the most complete psychological analysis of any\nmedium so far published {Proc, XXVIII).\nMrs Leonard's mediumship followed close on that of Mrs Piper.\nWhile it is not the subject of any single paper in Proceedings comparable to\nMrs Sidgwick's study above mentioned, it is second only to that of Mrs\nPiper for the thoroughness with which it has been investigated by our\nmembers from many angles. At various stages, as for instance, in the\nstudy of the book-tests, the investigation was one in which the Society's\nofficials were in close collaboration with groups of members. I do not\nbelieve that anything like the same advance in knowledge of this type of\nmediumship could have been achieved by students not welded together\nin one Society.\nI do not propose to discuss here the bearing of the cross-correspondences\non the problem of survival : but quite apart from that, their psychical\nand psychological interest is obvious. The group of automatists that\nproduced them had its origin in the S.P.R., although it spread beyond\nour borders. The work of interpretation\u2014and a colossal piece of work\ntoo\u2014was done entirely within the Society, by a collective effort surpassing\nthe powers of any single investigator.\nTo complete the account of the mental phenomena the experiments in\ntelepathy and allied faculties remain to be mentioned. This work has\nbeen shared by workers in many lands, the American share being in\nrecent years particularly notable. We cannot claim that the share of the\nSociety in this department of research has been quite as large as in some\nothers, but we certainly have no reason to be ashamed of it.\nIn every branch therefore, of that great attempt to extend the knowledge\nof the human mind to which psychical research is committed, our Society\nhas done a large, in some branches an overwhelmingly large share of the\nwork, the ability to do the work and the value of the work done being\nboth enhanced by the support the investigators have received from the\nSociety's organisation, and by the willing co-operation of their fellow\nmembers. No result could have been more gratifying to the long line of\nbrilliant investigators, extending from the first Presidency of Henry\n\f242 W. H. Salter [Part\nSidgwick in 1882 to Mrs Sidgwick's Presidency of Honour in the year of\nour Jubilee, and including those whom I mentioned at the beginning of\nmy Address, who willingly spared time from their own researches to make\nand keep the Society's machinery as efficient as possible.\nOn various occasions, when conferring with psychical researchers from\nforeign parts, I have heard the comment that, as practised in England,\npsychical research seemed to be a dreadfully dull business, and I have\nbeen commiserated with for having so few opportunities to enjoy those\ndramatic episodes which enliven night by night the seances of our confreres\nin other lands. I have, however, at no time regiietted that our Society has\nchosen the path of \" matter-of-factness \" backed by \" passionate deter-\nmination \", or seen cause to think that the record of our achievements\nwould be the brighter if it were adorned with the names of all the physical\nmediums who have been boosted one day, exposed the next, and forgotten\nthe day after, but lacked all mention of Phantasms of the Living, the Census\nof Hallucinations, Mrs Piper, Mrs Leonard, \" the S.P.R. group of\nautomatists \", and that long series of experiments into paranormal cogni-\ntion begun in the early days of the Society and still being pursued among\nus with undiminished vigour.\nThe Society has certainly not neglected the physical phenomena and\nhas made considerable contributions to their exploration. In any history\nof psychical research prominence should be given to two pieces of work\ndone by leading members of the Society in its early years, Hodgson and\nDavey's study of the relation between mediumistic deception and mal-\nobservation on the sitter's part {Proc, IV and VIII), a text-book for\nsitters which is not yet out of date, and Podmore's review of poltergeist\ncases in Proc, XII. The latter did more than give a rational account of a\ntype of occurrence that had long puzzled mankind : it showed a great\nadvance in the understanding of psychological factors that are found at\nwork in many branches of psychical research.\nWhen this Society was founded, much destructive work was needed\neverywhere to clear away the accumulated lumber of uncritical ages, and\nnot till that was done could constructive work in any department begin.\nAs regards the mental phenomena, the Society soon found plenty of\nmaterial yielding positive results, from among its own members and the\npublic at large, in cases of spontaneous telepathy. It was also so fortunate\nas to make contact with a remarkable mental medium, Mrs Piper, very\nsoon after her mediumship began. On this side of its work the construc-\ntive stage was accordingly soon reached.\nFor the physical phenomena both the conditions and the results were\nvery different. They are not widespread, as \" phantasms \" are, and no\none has even suggested taking a Census of Materialisations. Nor have we\never succeeded in repeating with any physical medium the experience we\nenjoyed with Mrs Piper\u2014that of being practically the first in the field.\nIt has been through all our history a discouraging chronicle of finding\nthat mediums who had achieved fame in the production of phenomena for\nother investigators, failed hopelessly when sitting with researchers who\ncould be guaranteed to combine with tact the maintenance of proper\nconditions of control. In a few instances some very meagre positive\nresults have been obtained, but it is unlikely that the constructive stage\n\fly^] Presidential Address 243\nwill be reached as long as control conditions elsewhere are so much laxer\nthan those on which we insist.\nBut if the course of our enquiry be viewed as a whole, we have no\nreason to be dissatisfied with the progress made. We may not yet be in a\nposition \" to put the final question to the Universe \" with a right to demand\nan answer, but it is becoming clearer in what terms that question will have\nto be put, and that in itself is a result not unworthy of the very eminent\nmen and women\u2014philosophers, scientists and others\u2014who have been\nactive members of our Society. It would take the whole afternoon to\nrecite the list of them, with a summary of the work, in psychical research\nand in the world at large, for which each name is memorable. But, while\nit is not on the eminence of individual members, however noteworthy,\nbut on its success in extending our knowledge of human personality that\nthe Society will be judged, we may at least remind our critics of the\nimprobability that so many men and women, so highly distinguished in\nso many different ways, should have been mistaken either as to the import-\nance of our enquiries or as to the validity of the methods by which they\nhave been pursued.\nThere has been a good deal of discussion lately as to our methods and\nstandards of evidence, and the suggestion has been made that we should\nmodify our procedure in order to attract the interest of persons whose\ntraining has been in more orthodox departments of learning. The object\nis praiseworthy, but the means proposed require scrutiny. Every form of\norganised enquiry is conducted in accordance with its own procedure and\nits own methods of ascertaining facts : law, physics, history, psychiatry,\nare a few examples that can be named. Each has worked out the method\nwhich it finds most satisfactory in solving its particular problems, having\nregard both to the subject matter of the enquiry, and to the course of\nevents to which the enquiry is intended to lead. Clashes between them\nare not unknown ;\nlawyers and doctors are in perpetual disagreement\nabout insanity as a defence in criminal proceedings. It is impossible to\nswitch over a system designed for one form of enquiry to another without\ncreating confusion. But every specialised system, however complete the\nsatisfaction it may give to those who use it, must justify itself as a legitimate\noffspring of common-sense, and must show that any divergences it may\nmake from other systems are neither capricious nor arbitrary. Particu-\nlarly incumbent is it on a relatively small body of enquirers, as we\nadmittedly are, not to adopt methods peculiar to ourselves, and unused by\nlarger and more highly organised groups, unless we can show good reason\nfor doing so.\nWe are sometimes invited to make our researches conform to the\nprocedure of science, to use that word in its popular, restricted meaning.\nI have heard and read many discussions on this subject which seemed to\nme wide of the point. Insufficient consideration seems to me to be given\nto the variety of ways in which psychical research and science are related,\nand I hope you will pardon me for taking up a little of your time in\ndwelling on them.\nSeveral auxiliary techniques which the psychical researcher may from\ntime to time need to use have been mentioned. Some of these are part\nof the domain of natural science, physics for example. Others, such as\n\f244 W. H. Salter [Part\nmedical psychology, claim a place within the scientific fold, but seem to\nhave met with a mixed reception from those already in possession. Then\nthere are highly organised bodies of knowledge, which can properly on\nthat ground claim to be sciences, though not part of science in the\nnarrower sense, as they may, like statistics, be applicable to many forms of\nactivity not usually accounted scientific, such as business or public affairs.\nHowever useful any of these may be to the psychical researcher, none of\nthem are an integral part of psychical research, and their applicability or\notherwise to any type of psychical enquiry has no bearing on the question\nwhether that type of enquiry is valid or not. If, however, the enquiry is\nsuch that one of these techniques, when applied to it, will produce\ninformation that could not be obtained otherwise, then the psychical\nresearcher should use it, and if he uses it, he must use it as it would be\nused by an expert.\nNext to be considered is the case where the same subject matter, and\npossibly the same facts, are under the examination of two groups of\nenquirers, each studying them from a dift'erent angle. An example\nfamiliar to members of this Society will be the study of hypnotism and\ndissociations of personality by psychical researchers and medical psycholo-\ngists. If you take the men who were most prominent in the early years of\nthe Society, here, on the Continent and in America, men such as\nFrederic and Arthur Myers, Gurney, Richet, William James, you have a\ngroup each and every member of which had some knowledge, considerable\nknowledge in fact, of medicine, and psychology, and psychical research,\nin whichever of those subjects he might have specialised. Is there any\nbetter way to ensure rapid progress in investigation than for the same\nmaterial to be examined from several angles by groups each of which is at\npains to keep acquainted with the aims, methods and results of the other\ngroups\nEnquirers, however, seldom confine their opinions to the facts ascer-\n'\ntained by their enquiry. There is usually some admixture, large or small,\nof inference, and this is where trouble often develops. Two bodies of\nenquirers each have a mass of ascertained fact, from which they launch\ninferences as to facts that they have not been able to bring under direct\nexamination, and the inferences may be in conflict. The old dispute\nbetween physicist and biologist as to the span of time to be allowed for\nthe development of life on the earth's surface, is an example. Each of the\ndisputants had plenty of facts to back him, but not facts which extended\nto personal observation of the time, place and conditions under which life\narose. So they had to make inferences, and for a time the inferences did\nnot agree.\nThat was an instance of conflict between two highly organised scientific\ngroups. But to leave this example and speak generally, in a dispute\nwhere each side relies partly on fact and partly on inference, two questions\nare material, which party has on its side the largest body of fact, and which |\nparty has on its side the body of fact, whether large or small, most directly\nbearing on the dispute and requiring the least amount of inference to\nmake it relevant. The most diflicult disputes are those where quantity\nis on one side and relevance on the other.\nFor psychical researchers this problem has arisen in different forms with\n\f175] Presidential Address 245\nregard to both physical and mental phenomena. The reality of physical\nphenomena has been accepted after investigation by a few scientists of\nthe highest eminence, such as Crookes and Lodge, but not accepted by the\nworld of science at large. Why this difference? First, as to fact, scientists,\nincluding Crookes and Lodge, had a very large body of fact which they\nall of them accepted : there was a much smaller body of fact, or alleged\nfact, which Crookes and Lodge accepted after examination, but which\nscientists in general, with splendid exceptions such as the late Lord\nRayleigh and his father, did not even bother to examine. Now as to\ninference, Crookes and Lodge had no need to draw any ; if their facts\nwere right, they took them the whole way. Those scientists who refused\nto examine the evidence on which Crookes and Lodge relied seem to have\ndrawn the inference from facts common to Crookes and Lodge and them-\nselves, that there were general principles or \" laws \" governing the\nphysical universe of such wide applicability as to make any exception to or\ntranscendence of them impossible. But so many supposed \" impossi-\nbilities \" are continually being proved true, that this inference was not a\nvery safe ground for refusing even to examine what men of the status of\nCrookes and Lodge accepted. The alleged phenomena were within the\nscientists' own province : they had resources of personnel, of equipment,\nof finance far superior to any at the command of the small band of psychical\nresearchers to whom they relinquished the task. If these resources had\nbeen brought to bear with an open mind, the problem of physical\nphenomena might by now have been settled.\nTelepathy does not seem to be much more popular with science than,\nsay, telekinesis, though here again, the supporters include a number of\nscientists of the highest rank. But the evidential status of the two subjects\nis widely different. Telekinesis, if it occurs, is a physical event, and is\npresumably governed by some physical laws ; if not by laws already\naccepted, then by others not perhaps yet discovered. Telepathy, on the\nother hand, is not on the face of it a physical event at all. It exists when\ntwo minds have a common content, in such conditions and to such an\nextent that normal communication, e.g. by speech or writing, cannot be\nsupposed to have produced it. Whether or not a situation of this kind has\noccurred is not a matter for natural science at all. It is much more like\nthe problems with which the lawyer and the historian are concerned, but\nthe procedure which in this matter holds the field is that of psychical\nresearch and no other. It was designed to deal with it, and has successfully\ndealt with it for more than sixty years. In defining this situation I have\nnot mentioned the question whether the community of content between\nthe two minds is attributable to chance. That is a separate issue,\ndeterminable in some instances by statistical method : but statistics,\nwhile much used in science, are also, as already mentioned, used in other\ncormections.\nIf anyone chooses to explain telepathy by some physical law, such as\nradiation, the physicist and the physiologist are within their respective\nprovinces in criticising that explanation. But they have no special claim\nas physicists or physiologists to sit in judgment on telepathy, or on any\nexplanation of it that does not invoke physical processes. If the subject\ninterests them, let them join our ranks, as several of their most eminent\n\f246 W. H. Salter [Part\ncolleagues have done, and learn our well-tested methods. That the\nresults of our enquiries have won neither a knowledge nor an acceptance\ncommensurate with their importance is a fact we all deplore. To set it\nright we must boldly appeal to Caesar, to that wide community of educated\nopinion from which are derived all specialised systems of enquiry, our\nown and those of the natural sciences alike.\nWe are all familiar with the sort of questions our friends ask when we\ntry to explain telepathy to them, or to interest them in it. The questions\nvary from person to person, but, so far as my experience goes, they fall\nunder three main heads : (i) Can you prove it? (2) how does it work? (3)\nwhat is the use of it? Now, each of these questions seems to me to call\nfor a different kind of evidence.\nFirst, where proof is concerned, there is nothing to equal experiment,\npreferably quantitative experiment. That was the position taken up by\nthe founders of the Society who experimented on those lines themselves,\nand would have warmly welcomed the great extension of such experiment\nin recent years, and the improved technique now available. They were,\nhowever, far from neglecting or undervaluing the qualitative evidence\nobtainable by other methods. In almost every branch of psychical\nresearch sceptics are to be found within the Society, but I do not know\nof a single member who is familiar, whether by investigation or by study of\nthe literature, with the evidence, qualitative and quantitative, for telepathy,\nwho does not regard this faculty as proved, however little else he may\naccept. Outside the Society, disbelief, so far as my experience goes, is\nusually grounded on a priori objections divorced from study of the\nevidence on its own merits.\nThe second question, how does it work? is ambiguous. If it means,\nwhat is the process? all that can be done is to mention certain processes\nin order to indicate their improbability. Of these the most popular is\n\" waves \", and although this view does not lack weighty support, it seems\nto me most improbable if applied to the complex images and messages\nthat are the content of spontaneous experiences, and have been the\nmaterial for qualitative experiments. This is a notable instance of the mis-\nconceptions likely to arise if the more complex manifestations of this or\nany other psychic faculty are ruled out because they do not readily\naccommodate themselves to statistical analysis. There is not, as far as I\nknow, evidence of any physical process capable of producing all the\nmanifestations of telepathy with which we are familiar, and it seems to\nme quite possible that none will ever be discovered.\nIf, however, it is meant, what conditions favour telepathy? experiment\nof many kinds and spontaneous cases of the kind printed in Phantasms\nand later volumes of our Journal and Proceedings both seem to throw a\ngood deal of light on it. I stress the spontaneous cases because in these\nthe faculty is seen at work in its natural surroundings, and the effect of\neven the best experiments may sometimes be to produce an artefact, in\nwhich some of the essential features of telepathy are incompletely repro-\nduced. But both types of evidence have their value. The spontaneous\ncases suggest that certain conditions of mind and body in the percipient,\ncertain relations between agent and percipient, favour positive results.\nIn experimental work, as Dr Soal has recently emphasised, classification\n\f175] Presidential Address \u2022\n247\nof percipients according to recognised psychological types has already in\nAmerica provided valuable information, and might advantageously be\nmore generally used.\nThe third question, what is the good of it? is the most difficult of all,\nbut it must be faced, as the most rigid demonstration of the existence of\na faculty will fail to carry full conviction, unless either its working is so\nfamiliar to us all as to need no further proof, or it can be shewn to serve\nsome purpose, past, present or future. The type of evidence best adapted\nfor proof is that which appears to exclude chance by pronounced deviation\nfrom the normal course of events, whether this evidence consists of out-\nstanding scores at card-guessing, or of crisis-apparition's. Both of these\nare rare, relatively to the occurrences of everyday life, although there are\nnow on record several hundred instances of each.\nThese being the conditions under which proof of the existence of\ntelepathy must be established, can we reinforce the effectiveness of the\nproof by some indication of purpose ? If there is one thing which on the\nface of it seems more purposeless than the ability, attributed to a few\nfavoured persons, to acquire knowledge of the death of an uncle at the\nAntipodes by seeing his apparition an hour or so before they would have\nlearnt of it by cable or wireless, it is the gift, apparently confined to even\nfewer, of being able to guess correctly whether the card which an experi-\nmenter is holding up in an adjoining room bears the picture of a zebra\nor a giraffe.\nWere the only manifestations of telepathy of this kind, with no closer\nconnection with the experiences and purposes of ordinary life, many of\nus might be inclined to suspect that, however perfect the proof might\nlook, there was a catch in it somewhere. But those of us who belong to\nthis Society know that more has to be taken into account than card-\nguessing and crisis-apparitions. Colour is added to the bare outline of\nthe more strictly evidential matter by a large number of occurrences\nexamined by our observers, by unpublished experiments, and, for many,\nby the spontaneous experiences of themselves and their friends. I see\nnothing objectionable in anyone allowing his opinion of the nature and\npurpose of telepathy to be influenced in this way, provided he can\ndistinguish, as all members of this Society must be supposed to do,\nbetween impression and fact. Unless indeed we are sensitive to these\nundertones, we are likely to let many opportunities for investigation pass\nunnoticed.\nThe material with which the officers of this Society are called on to\ndeal is astonishing. Letters have to be answered from all sorts and\nconditions of men and women all over the world, often relating the oddest\nincidents and asking the oddest questions. Personal interviews are some-\ntimes even more extraordinary. Nearly all the material is of the greatest\npsychological interest, and much of it of psychical interest too. More of\nit would have been of value to psychical research if the narratives could\nhave been verified earlier. In what follows I am referring to the residue\nof experiences which seem to contain a genuine paranormal element, but\ntoo small an element to bring the case \" up to Journal standard \". The\nfacts are all right, but a reasonable person might doubt whether they\nshowed any departure from the normal course of events, as determined\n\f248 W. H. Salter [Part\nby chance-coincidence or the ordinary mental processes of the persons\nconcerned.\nYou have been so good as to allow me the opportunity, as one of your\nofficers, to see a good deal of this material at close quarters for several\nyears, and perhaps the best return I can make for your kindness is to say\nwhat impression it has made on me, in what way it has added colour for\nme to the evidence for paranormal cognition as set out in our Proceedings\nand Journal, and what inferences I would draw from it, as pointers to\npossible future investigation.\nThe cases printed in the Journal vary a good deal in the degree in which\nthey seem to require some explanation beyond chance or normal mental\nprocess. They may be arranged in a graded series, extending downwards\ninto the cases which are reported to the S.P.R., but not printed. In some\nof these latter\u2014and this is a point of some interest\u2014the persons reporting\nthem, ordinary sensible people, evidently see some significance which they\ncannot \" put across \" to the Society's representative, who is bound to\ntemper personal sympathy with critical detachment. It is very probable\nthat the series does not end there, but might be continued to the point\nwhere the percipient himself is uncertain whether his experience has any\nparanormal element in it. He may have an indefinite feeling that it has,\nbut if he has, he is inclined to keep it to himself.\nIn spontaneous cases we have no exact means of measurement to test\nwhether paranormality does indeed \" tail off \" to the vanishing point, but\nthe refinements of statistical analysis show that in experiments this does\noccur. The further question then arises, what justification have we for\nstopping the series at any point short of that where the normal and the\nparanormal merge, not only in appearance but in fact, or for assuming\nthat communications between any two persons may be either normal or\nparanormal, but cannot conceivably be both at the same time?\nWhen we see cases as they are set out in the Joimial, with a descriptive\nlabel and serial number attached, we are inclined to think of each case,\nassuming the evidence to satisfy us, as a separate outbreak of paranormal'\npower, and to overlook indications that the faculty operates continuously\nfor considerable periods. Where successful experiments in E.S.P. with\nthe same agent and percipient are spread over months or even years, it is\nhardly reasonable to suppose that the \" rapport \" (whatever that may be)\nbetween agent and percipient, which has given positive results throughout\none evening, breaks off completely at its close, to re-establish itself on the\nnext occasion that an experiment is tried. Continuity emerges even more\nclearly from the cross-correspondences. Let these be considered merely\nas complicated examples of telepathy, regardless of whether it be telepathy\nbetween the living or due on one side to discarnate agency. The automa-\ntists are sometimes kept busy for years on end developing some particular\npart of the pattern.\nWe have therefore a good deal of evidence suggesting that telepathy is,\nin one form at least, a continuous process, for long periods indistinguish-\nable from normal mental processes ; sometimes slightly but perceptibly\ndivergent from them : and only very occasionally developing into such\nstartling manifestations as crisis-apparitions.\nBut this view has its own difficulties. Why, it is sometimes asked, if\n\fI75] Presidcniial Address 249\ntelepathy is so common, are we not receiving telepathic impressions all\nthe time? Life would be unlivable if we were, and either they are not\nbeing transmitted or else some protective and selective mechanism has\nbeen evolved, that prevents their penetrating our conscious minds. It is\nhere that it is useful to consider further the cases where the participants\nin an experience see more in it than they can get a benevolent but detached\ncritic to see. We are all aware that members of groups,, of the same family,\nfor instance, or even persons more loosely connected by professional or\nlocal ties, can understand each other with much less explicit statement\nthan would be needed if they were conversing with persons outside the\ngroup. That is a quite normal, everyday alTair. We might say that for\nideas of one kind the tracks between A.'s conscious mind and B.'s have\nworn smooth by frequent use, and for other ideas those between B.'s and\nC.'s. As each conscious idea has many subconscious ideas connected\nwith it, this may mean that similar, but (to continue the simile) wider\ntracks are worn smooth in the subconscious minds of A. and B., and of\nB. and C, tracks wide enough to take a flow of paranormal as well as\nnormal traffic.\nThis may give rise to those curious cases, usually called \" taking the\nwords out of one's mouth \" with which many of us are familiar, in which\nA. says something which his friend B. was on the point of saying, but\nwhich neither A. nor B. regard as the natural outcome of what either had\npreviously said, a point on which A. and B., if persons of average intelli-\ngence, must be taken as the best judges. Perhaps in these cases we have\na valuable opportunity, if we care to use it, of observing the normal and\nparanormal at the point of divergence.\nConscious contacts between mind and mind through the normal means\nof communication are by the circumstances of life discontinuous and of\nshort duration. When the normal contact is broken, the after effects of it\nmay be to keep the minds of both parties\u2014their conscious and their\nsubconscious minds\u2014moving on parallel lines for some time. But each\nparty has his own conscious experiences, unshared in the normal way by\nthe other, and these may deflect his mental processes so that, when normal\ncontact is resumed, it is not established as completely as on the previous\noccasion. This, we know, frequently happens. If however, there may\nbe supposed to be subconscious contact of longer duration, effective both\nduring the periods of conscious contact, and also in between, the conscious\ncontacts would be strengthened and made more complete, and the deflec-\ntions due to the intervening changes and chances of life would be minimised.\nWe need not suppose that for every conscious normal contact between\ntwo minds, however slight or temporary, there is developed a correspond-\ning, but more durable, subconscious contact. That may be true, but it\nseems to me more probable that subconscious contacts arise only from\nconscious contacts that count for something with the minds concerned.\nIf, however, the subconscious mind be considered, so far as telepathy is\nconcerned, not as a vacuum into which casual impressions from all\nquarters can crowd, but as at any given time occupied by, and in fact\nmainly composed of, a network of established contacts, it would seem to\nbe well protected against stray intruders. The network would be a most\ncomplex affair, as it would need to accommodate reciprocal transmission\n\f25\u00b0 W. H. Salter [Part\nbetween A. and B., A. and C, and so on, and also to allow for the connec-\ntions between A. and every other member of the group influencing the\nconnections between all other pairs within the group and being reciprocally\ninfluenced by them ; not to mention connections between one group and\nanother, for few men and women limit their interests to a single group.\nIt has often been pointed out that to call telepathy \" extra-sensory\nperception \" or \" paranormal cognition \" may be convenient for lack of a\nbetter phrase, but conveys far too limited a conception. As Mr Tyrrell\nhas shown with regard to apparitions, and as is obvious from the cross-\ncorrespondences (if these be regarded for the moment as instances of\ntelepathy without prejudice to other interpretations of them), there is\noften a great deal of constructive work in which the subconscious minds of\nagent and percipient participate.\nThe view of telepathy outlined above is, of course, speculative. It is\nintended, that is to say, to place in perspective not only the more striking\nevidence, spontaneous and experimental, on which alone ^roo\/ of telepathy\ncan be based, but also those other rudimentary and marginal phenomena,\nwhich inevitably come to the mind of anyone who has had experience of\npsychical research in its many forms. If these occurrences depended on\nthe report of any single individual, or but a few individuals, they would\nproperly be discounted as subjective. But they are numerous and wide-\nspread enough to rank as part, and in my opinion a fairly important part,\nof the evidence bearing not so much on the question whether telepathy is\nreal, but on the secondary issue of its nature and purpose. The evidence\nfor this view is at any rate more substantial than for the conception of\ntelepathy which seems to be popularly prevalent, that it is a collection of\nrare, disconnected, purposeless examples of the one-way transmission of\ninformation through space by some process akin to wireless, a conception\nof which every constituent item is almost certainly wrong.\nAt each stage I could, I believe, have quoted previous authority that\nwould carry weight in this Society, the final passage for example of the:\nlate Lord Balfour's Presidential Address {Proc, XIX, p. 396), but on the\nmain conclusion, you will remember that in Hmnan Personality (Vol. I,\np. 112) Myers described the passion \" which binds hfe to life, which links\nus both to life near and visible, and to life imagined but unseen \" as \" the\ninward aspect of the telepathic law \". If I have from the material accrued\nsince his day cited some that in however slight a degree adds substance\nto his prophetic vision, I am more than content.\nWith the conception of personality as something more than a simple\nunit we are all, mainly through Myers's writings, familiar. The internal\nstructure of this composite entity, whether consisting of \" strata \" or of\nindependent \" selves \", has been discussed fully by Lord Balfour,\nMcDougall, Mitchell and others. I wish I could refer you to equally\nauthoritative and illuminating discussions of the problem of the external\nstructure of personality, as affected by telepathy.\nMuch has indeed been written on the \" Group Mind \", but the groups\nwhich seem to have been most studied, the crowd, the primitive tribe,\nthe nation, are none of them groups within which telepathy, as distinct\nfrom mass emotion, would be expected to be effective. Hence even a\nwriter as conversant with the case for telepathy as McDougall does no\n\f175] Presidential Address 251\nmore than mention it briefly in this connection.^ It is not, however, with\nany supposed collective consciousness that we are now concerned so much as\nwith the effect of telepathy within the group on the personality of each\nmember ; on what in Samuel Butler's phrase may be called his \" vicarious\nexistence \". Butler, when he used this phrase, was thinking not of any tele-\npathic linkage, but of the influence which a man, a great writer, or painter or\nmusician, exercises over people unknown to him personally and even\nperhaps unborn during his own bodily life. It is a conception of respectable\nantiquity, of which Horace's non onuiis moriar is a famous expression.\nBut while a man's \" vicarious existence \" may affect more people for a\nlonger time than any influence he could exert in the flesh, it is only by a\nfigure of speech that it can be regarded as his existence. Political parties,\nfor example, seldom carry out their founders' intentions even while their\nfounders are still alive\n\u2014\" Wilkes was never a Wilkesite \", as he protested\n\u2014\nand the regularity with which within a generation they turn into something\nfundamentally different is so notorious as to absolve me from the invidious\ntask of quoting examples. And indeed the limitations of \" vicarious\nexistence \" are implicit in the form in which Horace expresses the idea.\nBut the case is different if we turn to the more intimate groups of\nfamily, friends and acquaintances which play so large a part in an ordinary\nman's life, and consider the possible effect of the interplay within each\ngroup of telepathy of the kind I have tried to describe. Where the group\nconsists of mere acquaintances, the effect might be nil, but where the\nmembers are bound together emotionally, we cannot disregard the possi-\nbility that the normal communications within the group are supplemented\nand strengthened by telepathic linkage. This linkage may seldom be\napparent even to members of the group, and may be quite incapable of\nproof to outsiders, but, as Dr Gardner Murphy has shown in recent\narticles in the Journal of the American S.P.R., it cannot be disregarded in\nassessing evidence for survival, since its effect may well be to create what\nhe calls \" a static surviving entity \" on which the power of unconscious\ndramatisation frequently shown by mediums may confer a misleading\nappearance of personal activity. Everyone must judge for himself how\nfar this conception accounts for such material, prima facie suggestive of\nsurvival, as he is himself familiar with, whether through the' literature of\npsychical research, or in the form of the unpublished experiences of\nhimself or his friends. As regards the material that has come to my notice\nfrom many sources, it seems to me that much is covered by this conception,\nbut far from all. Until the \" interpersonal field \" has been explored, it\nwould be idle to attempt to distinguish with any assurance between\nexamples of paranormal action which could reasonably be supposed to\noriginate there and those for which some other origin must be sought, but\nthere have been incidents reported with Mrs Leonard, and I think with\nMrs Piper, too, that have had a particular appropriateness to the occasion\nwhen they occurred, and are in that way not at all suggestive of ideas\ndrifting into the medium's subconscious mind from the \"psychic field \" and\nreceiving a dramatic form there. Nor does the element of design in the\ncross-correspondences seem to me accounted for on this theory.\nTwo most important tasks for psychical research are, in my view, first\n^ See his The Group Mind, pp. 28-30.\n\f252 W.H.Salter [Part 175]\nto define as clearly as is practicable the extent of the constructive ability\nof the individual subconscious, for which purpose it will be necessary to\nbring under survey much matter not entirely within our province, review-\n'\ning, for example, in the light of later psychological knowledge, the\nimportant chapter on Genius in Human Personality ; and secondly to\nascertain how far minds can collaborate on the entirely subconscious level\nin devising a pattern or design, and in carrying it out.\nIt is not, however, clear to me that in examining any piece of evidence\nthat seems to point to some form of survival we are entitled to say, this is\neither z manifestation of an active personality, or of an \"interpersonal\npsychic field \", and to exclude the possibility that it may be both, any more\nthan, in my view, we are justified in rejecting the possibility that an\nincident may be at the same time telepathic, and also part of a normal\nprogression of mental events.\nAnd just as in assessing evidence for a supposed case of telepathy, the\ncorrect and objective method is to assess that evidence on its merits,\nwithout importing complications arising from any hypothesis of the re-\nlations between mind and body, so in assessing supposed evidence for\nsurvival, the case should be judged on its merits without reference to\nthose or any other extraneous complications. When the assessment has\nbeen made will come the stage of considering whether the result conflicts\nwith any external system of fact, which is possible, or with some system\nof inference projected from fact, which is probable. No useful purpose is\nserved by attempting to coalesce the two stages.\nI began this Address by laying emphasis on the part that the corporate\nactivities of this Society have played in promoting psychical research.\nThe effect of the collective effort has been to enhance, and not to obliterate,\nthe effort of each separate worker. In conclusion I sometimes wonder\nwhether we are sufficiently alive to the importance of the collective factor\nin paranormal activity also. It is from Mr Whately Carington's group\nexperiments that some of the most interesting developments in extra-\nsensory perception have arisen, and by general agreement it is through\n\" the S.P.R. group of automatists \", whose scripts claimed to be inspired\nby a group of communicators, that some of the most striking evidence for\nsurvival has-been obtained. And now that our researches have made\nprecognition respectable, I would hazard the prophecy that if the problems\nof telepathy and survival were approached in a less individualistic spirit,\nthe supposed antithesis between them would be found to be illusory.\nIf you think I have been too speculative, I would claim the indulgence\nof a first-offender, and plead the encouragement given by Professor Price\nin his Presidential Address, when he said, \" If people accuse us of being\nspeculative ... we must refuse to be frightened. We must postulate\nunverifiable entities and processes if we cannot get on without them.\"\nIf you retort that I have claimed for myself a liberty of prophecying more\nproperly belonging to trained philosophers, I would most heartily agree,\nknowing well that this Society has many members better equipped for\ntheoretic discussion than myself, and enjoying longer prospects of activity\nin its work. \u2022\n.\n\fA TEST OF SURVIVAL\nBy Robert H. Thouless\nThere have been many attempts to prove survival after death which have\ntaken the form of depositing a sealed envelope containing some object or\nmessage v^'hich the depositor hopes to be able to describe through a medium\nafter his death. The intention is that the correctness of his description\nwill be verified by the subsequent opening of the package and if it turns\nout to be correct this is taken to be proof that the description came from\nhim and that, therefore, he must have survived his bodily death. There\nare, however, objections to this experiment. It is proof of survival of the\ndepositor only if it is assumed to be impossible that the medium should\nobtain a direct psi cognition (clairvoyance) of the contents of the package.\nSince we do not know this to be impossible and indeed have good grounds\nfor believing it to be possible, a correct description is not completely\nsatisfactory evidence for the survival of the depositor. There is also the\nobvious practical difficulty of knowing when to open the package for\nverification. Many different descriptions may come (perhaps through\ndifferent mediums) and we do not know which is authentic. Once the\npackage is opened, the experiment is finished ; no second attempt is\npossible. This would be satisfactory only if messages received through\nmediums were always unambiguous and always accompanied by un-\nquestionable proof of the identity of the communicator.\nThese are obviously difficulties of different kinds. The first makes\ndoubtful the value of a positive result as a proof of survival ; the second\nmakes it possible that one might fail to get a positive result even though a\nsurviving spirit were able to communicate the contents of the package and\nwere trying to do so. A satisfactory experiment should be, as far as possible,\nfree from both kinds of difficulty. Ideally, the departed spirit should be\ntrying to communicate something which could not be known to sitters or\nmedium by any psi process, and it should be something which can be\nrecognised as right when it comes however many false attempts have been\nmade.\nI have tried to devise and construct a test which seems to me perfectly\nto fulfil the second condition and to come as near as seems at present\npracticable to fulfilling the first also. Instead of having an object or\nwritten message in a sealed package, the test I suggest is an enciphered\npassage of which the communicator is to supply the key. The enciphered\npassage need not be in a sealed package ; I suggest that it should be\nprinted. Without the key, the passage cannot be read ; the object of the\ncommunicator {i.e. myself after my bodily death) will be to supply the key.\nThe test of the correctness of the key communicated will be that by its\nmeans the test passage will become meaningful.\nThe passage I have prepared is the following : CBFTM HGRIO\nTSTAU FSBDN WGNIS BRVEF BQTAB QRPEF BKSDG MNRPS\nRFBSU TTDMF EMA BIM. It uses one of the well-known methods\nof encipherment with a key-word whiqh I hope to be able to remember\n253\n\f254 Robert H. Thouless [Part\nin the after life. I have not communicated and shall not communicate\nthis key-word to any other person while I am still in this world, and I\ndestroyed all papers used in enciphering as soon as I had finished.\nMy intention is to see whether after my death I can give evidence of my\ncontinued existence by communicating the key necessary for the passage\nto be deciphered. It is the key and not the meaningful passage itself that\nI intend to communicate. I could not indeed hope to be able to give the\noriginal passage since I have largely forgotten it already and I shall probably\nhave forgotten even what it was about in a few years ; the key I hope\nalways to remember. I do not think that any special sittings with mediums\nshould be necessary. Some members of the Society will have sittings with\nmediums in any case, and it is to be supposed that I shall ostensibly come\nas communicator to those who know me well. If they will then remind\nme of this test and ask me for the key to the cipher, I will do my best to\nsupply it.\nAn obvious advantage of this test over the sealed package test is that\nany number of attempts at communication of the key-word can be made\nand tried out. Testing the truth of a single false communication finishes\nthe sealed package test, since once the package is opened, its contents are\nknown. In the present test, on the other hand, a false key may be given\nin a communication and may be found to be false by the fact that it does\nnot give a meaningful interpretation of the passage without, however,\ngiving any clue as to what is the correct key. The second of the conditions\nmentioned above is, therefore, fulfilled.\nThe other objection to the sealed package test was the possibility of a\ncorrect answer being obtained by psi processes on the part of the medium\nor sitters without any necessity for the co-operation of the spirit of the\nperson who made up the package. Let us consider this difficulty in more\ndetail.\nAssuming that, in the sealed package test, all normal means by which\nthe medium (or sitters) might know the contents of the package have been\neliminated, there seem to remain two possibilities of paranormal cognitive\nprocesses leading to a positive result of the experiment without the\nnecessity for supposing that the description of the contents of the package\nhas been supplied by the spirit of the person who made up the package.\nThese are : (i) the possibihty that there might be direct psi cognition of\nthe contents of the package (clairvoyance), and (2) the possibility of psi\ncognition of the past mental processes of the person making up the package\n(retro-cognitive telepathy).\nIn the present test, the first possibility is plainly eliminated by the fact\nthat there is nothing in the enciphered passage itself to be paranormally\ncognised. In the sealed package test, an object or message is concealed\nin the package. This object or message could be described by the use of\nnormal perceptual processes if the package were opened and the contents\nlooked at. The hypothesis of clairvoyance is that the clairvoyant person,\nwithout opening the envelope, can obtain the same information about its\ncontents as would a normal person by looking at them. There is no\nparallel possibility in the cipher test. The enciphered passage is open to\ninspection by normal perceptual processes to clairvoyant and ordinary\npersons alike, and there is nothing more for a psi process to discover in\n\f175] A Test of Survival 255\nthe passage itself. The key is in my mind and not in the object. A psi\nprocess which could discover the key must be a cognition of the content\nof my mind {i.e. it must be of a telepathic nature).\nThat someone might discover the key-word by psi cognition of my\nthought during my lifetime is undoubtedly a possibility. That would be\nmerely a nuisance, and would necessitate reconstructing the test on a more\nelaborate plan. There might, for example, be a process of double en-\nciphering by two people each ignorant of the key-word used by the other,\nor a serial encipherment made by any number of people all ignorant of the\nkey-words used by the others. It would be far more difficult to bring\nsuch a more elaborate test to a successful conclusion since it would require\na number of independent communications which could not, of course, be\nobtained until all the collaborators in the test had died. It does not,\ntherefore, seem desirable to complicate the test in this way until the\nnecessity for it is proved.\nMore serious is the difficulty that it is conceivable that there might be\nthe possibility of a psi cognition of the key-word after my death even\nthough nothing of my mind survived my bodily death. Plainly such a\npsi cognition must, in this case, be retro-cognitive {i.e. a knowledge of a\npast process in my mind), but there seems reason for supposing that retro-\ncognitive telepathy is a possibility.\nI do not see how any test can be devised which completely eliminates this\npossibility. There is, however, a way in which such an explanation of a\npositive result can be rendered very improbable. I suggest that repeated\nattempts should be made during my life-time to obtain information as to\nthe key-word through mediums. Suppose that these were all unsuccessful,\nwhile similar attempts after my death were followed by success. Then it\nwould be reasonable to conclude that the factor producing success is not\none that exists both before and after my death (the power of medium or\nsitters to obtain the key by telepathy) but is the respect in which the two\nperiods differ\u2014that after my death I am willing to communicate the key.\nIt is undoubtedly an understatement of the matter to say that the possi-\nbility of obtaining the key by telepathy exists both before and after my\ndeath if my mind vanishes at the time of death ; it should be far easier to\nobtain knowledge by a psi process from a mind still existing than retro-\ncognitively from one that has ceased to exist.\nIt is, therefore, an important part of the test that attempts should be\nmade while I am still alive to obtain the key through mediums. I hope\nthat members of the S.P.R. will co-operate in the test by making such\nattempts. I suggest that when this is done, whether or not there is any\nresponse, a note of the fact that the attempt has been made should be sent\nto the Research Officer of the Society, so that there may be a record of the\nnumber of attempts that have been made. If there have been a sufficient\nnumber of such attempts during my life and all have been unsuccessful\nwhile an equal or smaller number of attempts after my death have led to\nsuccess, the conclusion that the key has been supplied by me as a still\nexisting communicator and not through a retro-cognitive telepathic process\nof the medium or sitters will be very strongly indicated.\nA further doubt may be felt as to whether the key might not be found\nby the normal process of rational inference, since it is commonly supposed\nR\n\f256 Robert H. Thouless [Part\nthat a sufficiently skilled cipher expert can decipher any passage without\nknowing the key if he is given long enough time. This idea is, howeverj\nerroneous unless certain conditions are fulfilled. The cipher must be a\nsimple one (such as a mono-alphabetic monographic substitution) or else\nthe passage enciphered must be of considerable length. A short passage\nenciphered by a simple type of substitution does not indeed need an expert\n;\nthe reading of such passages is often made a puzzle to amuse children.\nA long passage (or a number of passages) enciphered by a more complex\nmethod is more difficult to decipher without knowledge of the key, but it\nis said that an expert can do so with messages enciphered by most (but\nnot all) systems if he is given sufficient time. The passage I have given is\nneither enciphered by a simple process of substitution or transposition\nnor, I think, long enough for it to be possible to use the methods adapted\nfor breaking the less simple systems. I do not think that it could be\ndeciphered by a cipher expert without knowledge of the key while it could\neasily be deciphered by anyone with an elementary knowledge of ciphers\nif he were told the system and given the key.\nThe possibility of the key being discovered by a cipher expert need not,\nhowever, depend on my opinion. The enciphered passage is open now to\nany who have expert knowledge of methods of reading cipher messages. I\nhope that members of the Society who know such experts will now, while\nI am still alive, submit the passage to these experts. If even cipher experts\ncannot discover the key while I am alive, no normal intellectual process\ncould enable a medium (who is not a cipher expert) to do so after my death.\nThere is a further possibility which must be guarded against since it\nmight make the test unworkable. It might prove to be possible for a\nsufficiently ingenious cipher expert to discover some system of deciphering\nthe passage which made it into sense although he was not using my key\nand did not make it into the same sense as that of my original passage.\nThis possibility is suggested by consideration of the fact that by simple\nletter transposition, the word honorificabilitudinitatibus has been converted\ninto an assertion in Latin that the author of Loves Labour Lost was Bacon.\nIndeed it is theoretically possible that any short collection of letters could\nbe made into a sensible passage by a sufficiently ingenious system of\ndeciphering, even if the collection. were really a random one. One way of\ndealing with this difficulty would be to make the passage longer, but\nalthough this would make an arbitrary system of decipherment more\ndifficult, it would make it easier for a cipher expert to discover its real\nmeaning. A better way seems to be to define within narrow limits what is\nthe correct solution. When correctly deciphered my passage will be found\nto be an extract from one of Shakespeare's plays. This leaves the solution\ntoo wide for it to enable a cipher expert to be likely to be able to decipher\nthe passage without knowledge of the key while making it too narrow for\nan erroneous system of decipherment to be mistaken for the true one.\nConsideration of possible failure of this test to provide rigid proof would\nnot be complete if we did not mention the possibility of fraud. I might,\nwhile still living, tell a medium or some future sitter what the key-word\nwas with instructions to produce it as coming from me in a seance after\nmy death. This is certainly theoretically a possibility and I cannot see\nthat any form of test would completely exclude it. It is, however, very\n\f175] \" A Test of Survival 257\nimpi'obable for several reasons. First, I happen to be an honest man, and\nI think I am known to be scrupulously so in connection with my scientific\nwork. Secondly, I should have no motive for the deception. Even\nsupposing that, if I were anxious to prove a case, I should be willing to\nemploy dishonest means to do so, no hypothesis about my convictions with\nrespect to survival would seem to give a reasonable motive for cheating\nhere. I must either believe in survival, or not believe in survival or regard\nthe matter as doubtful If I do not believe in survival, I shall not want to\nproduce spurious evidence for its truth, unless for the eccentric and im-\nprobable reason that I suppose it desirable that men should believe in\nsurvival and am willing to lie to promote this end. If I do believe in survi-\nval, I have good grounds for hoping that the experiment will succeed\nwithout any cheating, and it would be unreasonable for me to try to produce\nfalse evidence. If I regard it as a matter of doubt, I have no motive for\nwishing dishonestly to establish a case one way or the other.\nThe improbability that I would cheat even if I had a motive for doing\nso, and the fact that I have no motive make this explanation a very im-\nprobable one but not impossible. Success of this test would not, therefore,\nbe coercive proof of survival, since it might be judged by some that\nsurvival was of the same order of improbability as a motiveless deception\nby an apparently honest ex-President of the Society for Psychical Research.\nIt is, however, somewhat unreasonable to suppose that any single test can\nproduce coercive evidence of anything, since it does not seem possible to\ndevise a test which does not at some point depend on the reliability of\nsome person or group of persons. The strength of the evidence need\nnot, however, depend on a single test. If this test is successful, I hope it\nwill be repeated. If there were a number of similar successes, the proba-\nbility that all were due to a number of independent and motiveless frauds\nwould become negligibly small.\nFinally, let us consider one possible obstacle to the success of any such\ntest as this if survival is a fact and my surviving spirit is able to communi-\ncate through a medium. It may be difficult for the departed person to\nremember what he has to communicate. The communicator is sufliering\nfrom the disadvantage that he can no longer have the use of his material\nbrain. It may well be true that brain traces are not essential to remember-\ning, but there is good reason for supposing that it is by using them that\nwe commonly do remember. If any of us had formed the habit of\nremembering things by recording them in a pocket book and we then lost\nthe pocket book we should be likely to show many lapses of memory.\nWe could have trained ourselves to remember by other means, but in fact\nwe have learned to rely on the pocket book, so its loss is a serious inter-\nference with our capacity to remember. The departed communicator\nwho has lost his material brain may be in a similar situation, so, although\nhe can correctly remember a number of things, he may find it difficult to\nremember particular things that he wants to remember. I have some hope\nthat this is likely to prove a less serious obstacle to the present test than to\nthe sealed package test since the key to a cipher may be more easily\nremembered than a message, perhaps of some length, sealed up in an\nenvelope. But it may happen that I shall find it difficult to remember the\nkey when I want to communicate it.\n\f258 Robert H. Thouless [Part\nIn order that my memory may be jogged if necessai-y, I will also deposit\nwith the Society a sealed envelope which contains a clue which should\nremind me of the key although it should not suggest it to anyone else.\nI should want this to be opened and the contents communicated to me\nonly if I failed to give the key without this help. I should indeed very\nmuch hope that this necessity would not arise since the opening of the\nenvelope would decrease the rigidity of the test. However peculiar to\nmyself might be the knowledge which led from the contents of the sealed\nenvelope to the key, it is theoretically possible that anything which\nreminded me of the key might also suggest the key to some other person.\nAlso the opening of the envelope would violate one important condition\nof the test\u2014that the situation with respect to both normal and paranormal\nmeans of discovering the key was the same after my death as before\nexcept for the one fact that after my death I should have the intention (if I\nsurvived) of communicating the key to whoever asked for it.\nAppendix\u2014A Supplementary Test\nIt is theoretically possible, although I think unlikely, that a sufficiently\nskilful cipher expert may decipher the passage I have given as my first\ntest without previous knowledge of the key if he works at the problem\nhard enough. The cipher system used is not theoretically \" unbreakable\n\"\nalthough the shortness of the passage will be, I hope, an insurmountable\nobstacle to the breaking of it. It seems, therefore, worth while to add a\nsecond message in an absolutely unbreakable cipher system, i.e. in one\nwhich cannot be deciphered without knowledge of the key although the\nsystem of ciphering is fully known. A system fulfilling this condition,\nwhich also fulfils the condition that the key can be easily communicated\ncannot be a simple one. I will give the passage and then explain the\nsystem used and the kind of key that should be communicated after my\ndeath.\nThe passage is the following: INXPH CJKGM JIRPR FBCVY\nWYWES NOECN SCVHE GYRJQ TEBJM TGXAT TWPNH\nCNYBC FNXPF LFXRV QWQL.\nThe system of the above cipher is based on the Vigenere letter square :\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n.\nbcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza\n'\ncdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab\ndefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc\nefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd\nv >\nfghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcde\nghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzAbcdef\nhijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefg\nijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefgh\njklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghi\nklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghij\nlmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijk\nmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijkl\nnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm\ni\nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmn\n\f175] A l^est of Survival 259\nPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNO\nQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP\nRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQ\nSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQR\nTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS\nUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST\nVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU\nWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV\nXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW\nYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX\nZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY\nThe usual method of using this system is to choose a key-word which is\nwritten repeatedly over the passage to be enciphered. The letter used in\nthe cipher is that found at the intersection of the row starting with the\nletter in the original message with the column headed by the letter of the\nkey-word immediately above it. Thus if the key-word were crab and the\nmessage to be enciphered were There is no death, the process of encipher-\nment would be as follows :\nCRABC RA BC RABCR\nTHERE IS NO DEATH\nVYESG ZS OQ UEBVY\nwhich written in the usual five-letter blocks becomes : VYESG ZSOQU\nEBVY.\nThis, however, is far from an unbreakable system since the periodicity\nimposed on the enciphered message by the constant length of the key-\niword makes it fairly easy to decipher a not too short passage without\nI previous knowledge of the key. This periodicity may be avoided by using\nas key a continuous passage of length equal to or greater than that of the\npassage to be enciphered, but this also does not avoid the possibility of\nbreaking the cipher by rational processes, since use can be made of the fact\nthat both the key and the enciphered passage are meaningful and will have\nthe frequency characteristics of meaningful material.^\nThis difficulty may be avoided by using a continuous key composed of\na random sequence of letters. Some way must, however, be adopted of\nobtaining such a random sequence by a method which can be communicated.\nI have used the following method. Each word in a continuous passage is\nreplaced by a single letter which is obtained by adding up the serial\nnumbers of the letters in the word (i.e. i for a, 2 for b, etc.), and then\ntaking the letter whose serial number is this total or, if the total is greater\nthan 26, taking the letter whose serial number is the remainder after\nI\ndivision by 26, In order to prevent any single letter frequency characteris-\n|tics resulting from the varying frequencies of words, all second and later\nj\nrepetitions of words already used are omitted. Words joined by a hyphen\njare treated as two words.\nI\nLet us, for example, suppose that the key passage is Hamlet's speech\nbeginning :\n\" To be or not [to be], that is the question. Whether 'tis\n^ I am grateful to Mr D. Parsons and another critic for demonstrating the\npossibility of breaking such a cipher.\n\f26o Robert H. Thouless [Part\nnobler in [the] mind [to] suffer . .\n.\". The words enclosed in square'\nbrackets are repetitions which must be omitted in constructing the key-\nletter series. The serial number of i is 20, while that of 0 is 15. 20 + 15 =\n35 = 26 + 9 ; the first letter of the key is, therefore, the ninth letter of the\nalphabet which is \/. Similarly the word be must be replaced by G since\nthe serial numbers of b and e are 2 and 5 respectively, and the sum of\nthese is 7, the serial number of G. In the same way \" or \" will be replaced\nby G and \" not \" by W, and the series of letters goes on : WBGPIVNW,\netc.\nIf we used this series as key to encipher the passage already discussed,\nwe get the following result :\nKey-letter series : IGGWW BG PI VNWNU\nOriginal passage : THERE IS NO DEATH\nEnciphered passage : BNKNA JYCWY RWGB\nIt is to be noted that any enciphered passage obtained by this process\nfrom a given original could also have been derived from any other original\npassage whatever of the same length by the use of a different series of key-\nletters. For example, the enciphered passage already obtained BNKNA\nJYCWY RWGB might equally well have been derived from the original\npassage \" Bloaters for tea \" if the key-letter series had been ACWNHFH-\nKRKADCB. Thus:\nKey-letter series : ACWNHFHK RKA DCB\nOriginal passage : BLOATERS FOR TEA\nEnciphered passage : BNKNA JYCWY RWGB\nFrom this possibility of a given enciphered passage being derivable\nfrom any original passage by means of some key-letter series, it follows\nthat a passage enciphered on this system is absolutely unbreakable unless\nthe key series is known, provided that two conditions are fulfilled : (i)\nthat the key series of letters is a random one, and (ii) that only one\npassage is enciphered by the key series used. The second condition has,\nof course, been fulfilled in this test. It is clear that this is necessary since\na cipher expert might theoretically discover the key if he had two passages\nenciphered by the same key, since he could utilise the fact that the key\nseries was one which gave a meaningful content to both messages and it is\nextremely improbable that more than one key series could be found\nwhich fulfilled this condition.\nA more difficult question is whether a series of letters obtained in the\nway described above is a truly random one. This can only be settled by\nfinding out how closely the conditions for randomness are fulfilled. It is\nto be noted that it is not necessary to demonstrate that a long series of\nletters derived in this way would show no departure from randomness.\nAll it is necessary to show is that the series actually used does not show\nsignificant departure from randomness. In the letter series I have used,\nI have counted the number of letters which appear once, twice, etc., and\ncompared these with the expected distributions in a random series. I have\nalso done the same for the frequency of the first 78 letter pairs. The\nexpected distributions are those of the Poisson series which are a close\n\f175] A Test of Survival 261\napproximation to the more correct logarithmic series. The results are as\nfollows :\nSingle letter distributions\nFrequency 0123456\nObserved 0585313\nExpected 1-3 3-9 5-8 5-8 4-4 2-6 1-3\nDistribution of letter pairs\nFrequencies o i 2 3 >3\nObserved 603 '\n69 3 i o\nExpected 602-5 69-3 4-o- -15 o-o\nIn both cases it is clear that there is no significant departure from\nrandomness. The key series is, in the length used, effectively a random\none. The conditions for unbreakability are, therefore, fulfilled.\nIt is not in this case necessary to give any indication of the nature of the\noriginal passage. The possibilities of arbitrary decipherment are un-\nlimited, but the distinction between a correct and incorrect decipherment\nis sufficiently indicated by the fact that the key-letter series in a correct\ndecipherment must be a series of letters obtained in the way described\nabove from some identifiable passage in a printed work. That more than\none such passage would give a meaningful interpretation of the en-\nciphered passage is almost infinitely improbable. My aim will be to\nindicate after my death the passage from which the key series of letters\nhas been derived.\nI think it should be regarded as strong evidence for my survival if I\nmanage to communicate the key for either passage after my death, if also\nattempts made by similar methods before my death have failed. It would\nbe still better if I could communicate both, particularly if they were\ncommunicated through difli^erent mediums to different sitters.\nI have already suggested that this test should not depend on any single\ncommunicator, and that it would be worth while for other members of\nthe Society to prepare similar ciphered passages to which they may hope\nto supply the key after their deaths. It has been suggested to me by Mr\nD. Parsons that my method of encipherment may involve too much\ncalculation to appeal to other members of the Society, and he suggests a\nsimpler method. This would still use the Vigenere square but the key-\nletters would be obtained by taking the third letter of every word in the\nkey passage, words of three letters or less being ignored. Thus from the\npassage :\n\" To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler\nin the mind to suffer . . .\", one would derive the key series AEEBNF, etc.\nThis would not be a truly random letter series since single letter fre-\nquencies would be much the same as those of ordinary meaningful\nmaterial. On the other hand, frequencies of two letter and three letter\ncombinations would probably be near enough to randomness to be of no\nhelp in breaking the cipher. While, therefore, not demonstrably un-\nbreakable, this system would probably give a cipher not breakable in\npractice provided that the passage enciphered was not too long, and the\nkey series was not used more than once. Those intending to make this\n7 > 7\nI o\n\f262 Robert H. Thouless [Part\ntest should also consider ease of remembering and communicating in\nmaking choice of the key passage.\nAdditional note. I have received some remarks on my second passage\nfrom a cipher expert. He agrees that a passage enciphered with a truly\nrandom letter series as key would be theoretically unbreakable. On the\nother hand, he considers that, although a short simple message enciphered\nby my system is likely to be secure in practice, it is not theoretically un-\nbreakable. He suggests two possibilities of breaking : (i) by listing the\ncommonest words in the English language with their letter equivalents\nand combining these with the commonest plain-text letters, or the\ncommonest word pairs combined with the commonest plain-text letter\npairs ; (2) by considering that the person making the cipher is more\nlikely to choose passages from some sources than others, e.g. the Bible or\nShakespeare is a safe bet, and a team of people working for a long time\ncould try out the whole of the Bible and Shakespeare. I think it is clear\nthat the second method would take a far longer time than anyone is going\nto devote to this task. To work through Shakespeare and the Bible would\ntake a number of man-years to be reckoned in centuries without mechanical\naid, and it would be large even with mechanical aids. Then it might fail\nbecause the author may not have done the obvious thing but have chosen\na passage from Moliere or the Analects of Confucius. Nor does the first\nmethod seem really practicable for a short passage. The number of possible\ntwo-word combinations is so enormous that a process of trial and error\nmight be continued for years without any certainty as to any letters in the\nenciphered message.\nI must, however, agree that the system is not theoretically unbreakable.\nIt seems to me, however, that all that is important in the test is that the\ncipher should not have been broken and, for this purpose, practical\nunbreakability is all that is required. I do not, therefore, propose to add\na third passage in a theoretically unbreakable cipher system since I think\nit would reduce the chance of the success of the experiment if I tried to\nburden my memory with a third key.\nIn case, however, somebody else wants to try the experiment with a\ntheoretically unbreakable cipher, I will here suggest a method which the\ncipher expert referred to above agrees to be theoretically as well as\npractically unbreakable. What is required is a truly random letter series\nfor key, which however depends on some supplementary key to be\ncommunicated by the spirit of the person making the cipher. This can\nbe attained by making, first, a random series of letters, and second, a\nseries derived from some passage in the manner described above, and by\nsome means combining the two series. Suppose, for example, the random\nletter series is : BHRFYJWJBRIATY (derived from a table of random\nnumbers), while the supplementary key-letter series is that derived above\nfrom \" To be or not to be, etc.\". These two series can be added together\n{i.e. the corresponding numbers can be added and 26 subtracted from the\nsum if greater than 26). Thus :\nBHRFYJWJBRIATY (random letter series)\nIGGWWBGPIVNWNU (letter series derived from key passage)\nKOYCVMDZKNWXHT (sum of above two series)\n\f175] A Test of Survival 263\nThis sum, which is itself a truly random series however great may be\nthe departure from randomness of the series derived from the key passage,\nis then used for enciphering the text in the manner already explained.\nIf the text to be enciphered is, as before, \" There is no death \", the\nenciphered passage becomes :\nKey letter series : KOYCV MDZKN WXHT\nOriginal passage : THERE ISNOD EATH\nEnciphered passage : DVCTZ UVMYQ AXAA\nHowever long the passage might be, it would be absolutely unbreakable\nwhile the random series and the key passage were unknown. It would\nalso, of course, be unbreakable if the key passage were known but not the\nrandom series. If the random series were known but not the key passage,\nthe position would be the same as that of my second passage, not theoreti-\ncally unbreakable but practically so.\nThis brings us to the main practical difficulty of this method. It, to\nsome degree, gives up the advantage of the possibility of repeated attempts at\nverification without altering the conditions. For the random series could\nnot possibly be remembered by the communicator so it must be deposited\nin a sealed package at the rooms of the S.P.R. This sealed passage must\nbe broken after the communicator has ostensibly given the key passage in\norder that verification may take place. The random series is then no\nlonger unknown. I do not think this matters much in practice since the\nopening of the sealed package containing the random series could be done\nby a few responsible officials of the Society who would seal it up again\nwithout making a copy and who would not try to remember it or be at all\nlikely to succeed if they did try. So the position for a second attempt at\nverification is virtually the same as for the first. The business of verifica-\ntion would, of course, be much more trouble than by the method I am\nusing.\nSince I am trying to encourage other people to carry out this experiment\nas well as myself, I ought perhaps to emphasise that it is a necessary condi-\ntion of unbreakability that only one message should be enciphered with\none key. Even a random letter series would not give an unbreakable\ncipher if the same letter series were used to encipher more than one\nmessage. I should also perhaps add that the cipher expert comments on\nthe system proposed by Mr Parsons (deriving a key from the third letters\nof words in a running text) that, in his opinion, it would be quite insecure.\n\f(All opinions expressed by contributors to Proceedings, whether they\nare officers of the Society or not, are solely the personal responsibility of\nthe authors.

J. West\nINTRODUCTION\nPsychical research can be divided conveniently into three classes of\ninvestigation : experimental E.S.P., mediumship and spontaneous pheno-\nmena. The last group\u2014which includes premonitory dreams and visions,\ndeath wraiths, hauntings and the like\u2014is in many ways the most instructive\nand certainly the most exciting.\nIn ordinary sciences, planned experiment has replaced passive observa-\ntion. In psychical research, analysis of spontaneous happenings plays a\nlarge part still, for the simple reason that we are as yet so ignorant of the\nnature of apparitions that they cannot be produced at will for the purpose\nof experiment.\nThis cardinal fact tends to be overlooked in discussion on the evidence\nfor the supernormal, in which mediums and experiments are given\nprominence, while spontaneous phenomena are forgotten. In point of\nfact, spontaneous cases have been known and commented upon through\nhistory, long before experiments were thought of and before anyone had\nheard of a medium. It is in such cases that the clearest instances of\napparent telepathy have been recorded, and we certainly cannot afford to\nneglect them while experimental work is yielding such uncertain results.\nArguing from the analogy of other sciences, it would be natural for the\nearly psychical investigators to regard the collection of cases as no more\nthan a means of drawing attention to the possibility of E.S.P. No doubt\nthey thought that experiment would confirm the stories they had collected.\nNowadays it is clear that the results of experimental work are meagre\ncompared with what is reported in spontaneous incidents.\nIt is important, therefore, that spontaneous cases should be investigated\nwith a view to obtaining clear-cut independent evidence for the paranormal.\nIn discussing spontaneous cases with people who have read reports in\nProceedings and Journal, the present author has been surprised by the\nwide difference of opinion on their cogency as evidence for the super-\nnatural. One reader of Mrs Sidgwick's collection of cases in Proceedings,\nVol. XXXIII, said she could never doubt again, but another, equally\nintelligent and scientific in outlook, said he was bitterly disappointed to\nfind the famous S.P.R. cases so pitifully inadequate.\n264\n\f[Part 175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 265\nThe reason for this wide difference in the assessment of case reports is\nthe difficulty of deciding what allowance should be made for normal\npossibilities, such as chance coincidence and unconscious exaggeration.\nThe investigator cannot influence the course of the phenomena, he cannot\ncontrol the circumstances in which they occur, his role is in fact hardly\nmore than an amanuensis for the people whose experiences he is studying.\nHowever well set out the material of the final report, the fact remains that\nit is based upon the testimony of unskilled observers who are often\nemotionally implicated in the phenomena they describe. In such circum-\nstances it is extremely difficult to form a balanced judgment. Some\npeople discount far more than others, and it is impossible to say who is\nright.\nIt will be seen that the obstacles in the way of making out a water-tight\ncase for the supernormal on the basis of spontaneous incidents are\nformidable. In this paper, some of these obstacles are considered in\ndetail, with the purpose of finding out how far they have really been met\nalready by past records, and what else is needed in the way of investigation\nbefore the present prima facie case can be said to be scientifically estab-\nlished. It is too much to expect any sort of post-mortem analysis of\ncontroversial questions of evidence to result in general agreement, but that\nshould not stop us studying the pros and cons of the situation and trying\nto formulate a reasoned policy for future research.\nThere is need for a survey of this kind. Since the Society for Psychical\nResearch was founded over three-score years ago, many avenues of\ninvestigation have been explored and countless facts collected. Although\nan enormous body of evidence has been built up, it is unfortunately not\nvery accessible. The results of many years of patient labour are bound up\nwith innumerable arguments and counter-arguments, criticisms and counter-\ncriticisms, forming a great mass which is scattered among some eighty\npacked volumes of Proceedings and Journal.\nIf we are to appreciate the meaning of all this material, if we are not to\nlose sight of the general trend, we need from time to time to review the\nposition and take stock of the salient lines of evidence.\nPART ONE .\n'\nPRECOGNITIVE DREAMS\nPrecognitive dreams deserve treatment in a separate section because the\nproblems of evidence involved are rather different from those in other\ntypes of cases.\nIn the first place, the precognitive dream is by far the commonest\nreported psychic incident at the present time. This has not alwavs been\nso. The records of fifty years back are predominantly apparitions of the\ndying, but since then the emphasis has transferred from apparitions to\ndreams.\nIn Proceedings, Vol. XLII, p. 94-98, there is a list of all the cases of\nprecognition printed by the Society for Psychical Research. Some of\nthese precognitions came as dreams, others were in the form of hallucina-\n\f266 D.J. West [Part\ntions. If this list be divided into two equal parts, the ratio of hallucinations\nto dreams in the first chronological half is twice what it is in the second half.\nIt may be that the change is only apparent. Early investigators were\ninclined to dismiss dream cases as unevidential, and it is possible that\nmany more cases were actually reported at that time than the published\nrecords suggest. If there really has been a change, it may be due to\npeople taking more notice of their dreams as a result of the attention paid\nthan in psycho-analytic literature. Whatever the reason, the fact is that\nthe majority of cases sent to the Society of Psychical Research nowadays\nare dreams.\nAn interesting point about psychic dreams is that they are so often\nclaimed as precognitions. Other kinds of psychic experience, particularly\nthe apparitional cases, are usually said to coincide with some internal event\nrather than to precede it. The common saying, \" you've broken my\ndream \", is an expression of the widely held idea that dreams anticipate\nthe dreamer's future experience.\nThe outstanding argument against allegedly precognitive dreams has\nalways been that of chance coincidence. Millions of people are having\ndreams every night and it would be surprising indeed if now and then\nthey did not correspond with a future event. In his analysis of dream\ncases, (i),^ Saltmarsh disposes of this argument very briefly. \"Although,\"\nsays Mr Saltmarsh, \" millions of people dream every night, comparitively\nfew remember their dreams, and still fewer have dreams of the very\nimpressive character which so often marks the premonitory cases.\"\nThis is not a very satisfactory counter-argument. For one thing, many\napparently precognitive dreams are in no way different from ordinary\ndreams. They are only recognised as precognitive after they have been\nfulfilled. It is true that the majority of dreams are forgotten very quickly,\nbut those that happen to \" come off \" will be more fixed in the mind and\nretained much longer. The very fact of paying attention to dreams and\nlooking for a precognitive element, will cause them to be remembered\nmore easily. In certain cases, it mdy be that a chance resemblance recalls\na dream that would otherwise have been permanently forgotten. These\npoints are well illustrated by a lady correspondent who wrote to us in\nMay, 1947 after hearing broadcast on precognition by Professor Broad.\nShe wrote as follows :\n\" I have had [precognitive] dreams for many years\u2014since 13 or 14\nyears of age ... I am now 44. . . .\n\" I dream very extensively every night and can remember details for\nmany years. Naturally it is not until the event fulfils the dream that I\nrecognise it\u2014one could not walk about expecting every dream to come\ntrue.\"\nThe correspondent was asked if she would make a note of her more\nstriking dreams and post them to the Society before the fulfilments. To\nthis suggestion she replied :\n\" I feel it would be very difficult to send an account of a dream before\nthe event\u2014as it would mean keeping a day to day account of every dream\none had\u2014just in case one should be fulfilled.\n^ Figures in brackets refer to the list of sources given at the end of this paper.\n\f175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 267\n\" It is not usually the most striking ones that come true. . . . Some\npeople might say that it is all coincidence\u2014but apart from the fact that\nthey happen too often to be coincidences\u2014there is the feeling that goes\nwith them [when they are fulfilled].\n\" As a young child I always used to think I had done the things before\n\u2014\nbut when I got to the age of 14 or 15 I got it more clearly and realised that\nI had dreamed it before.\"\nThis last comment, about the feeling of going through an experience\nthat has happened before, raises another point. There is a common\nillusion of memory\u2014referred to as the sense of deja vu, (2), which is a sort\nof false recognition\u2014the person thinks he has seen the situation before\nwhen, in fact, he has not. It is a recognised phenomenon of mental\nillness, (3), but also occurs in the normal person in states of fatigue. The\npresent writer has experienced the illusion when on occasions a person\nhas said something to him which he felt he had heard before. Without\nasking a direct question, it has been impossible for him to tell whether the\nsentence had been repeated because of his inattention, or whether it was\nactually being spoken for the first time. It is possible, when a person\nremembers a dream for the first time on encountering the reality, that the\nmemory is a false one\u2014a case of deja vu.\nTo return to the other points in the letter, this particular dreamer is\nquite clear that her premonitory dreams are no different in quality from\nher other dreams. In this she is in agreement with most dreamers. The\ndream which is unusually vivid, almost an hallucination, is the exception\nrather than the rule in precognitive cases.\nAgain, this particular lady says she remembers her dreams well, and that\nis the experience of quite a number of the people who report precognitive\ncases.\nIn assessing reports of precognitions, the scope for chance coincidence\nis very wide if the premonitory impression does not come in some form\nthat is exceptional for the person concerned. Otherwise, the suspicion is\nthat the reported case which was fulfilled is a selected coincidence from a\nlarge number of instances which were not fulfilled. It is important to\nbear in mind that when the premonitory impression is said to be of a vivid\nand exceptional character we have only the unsubstantiated word of the\npercipient for it. Although a very vital point in the chain of evidence, it is\none on which corroboration is by the nature of things impossible.\nFrom the point of view of critical assessment, therefore, we are more or\nless bound to regard all dream fulfilments as drawn from an indefinitely\nlarge population of non-veridical cases.\nMr Saltmarsh, in discussing further the hypothesis that dream fulfil-\nments are only chance coincidences, says that even supposing there are\nmillions of dreams remembered, the number of subjects which may be\ndreamed about is practically infinite. The chances that any particular\nsubject will enter into a dream on any particular night is very small.\nNow this is a doubtful argument. The fact that a particular subject is\nunlikely to be dreamt at a particular time has little bearing on the question.\nEven taking one individual, if he has the usual quota of dreams, and a good\nmany waking experiences, there are bound to be some chance fulfilments in\n\f268 D.J. West [Part\nthe course of a lifetime. In actual fact, there are thousands, if not millions\nof people having dreams every night, and the chances are correspondingly\nmultiplied. It is difficult to realise how large an allowance must be made\nfor chance coincidence. The simple experiment of reading an article and\nlistening to a broadcast talk simultaneously will show how often quite\nstartling correspondences are produced by chance.\nIt is sometimes said, where a dream is mentioned to an independent\nperson before its fulfilment, that this rules out the possibility of chance\ncoincidence. We know then that the case has not been selected from a\nnumber of dreams, only one of which was fulfilled. The fallacy in this\nargument is that the dreamer may be in the habit of relating her dreams\nto different people, in which case it is still possible that the reported case\nhas been selected. Only if a number of dreamers all send their predictions\nto a single authority\u2014the Society for Psychical Research for instance\n\u2014\ncould a reliable assessment be made. In that event, it could be possible\nfor the authority to publish an unselected collection of predictions and find\nout what proportion had come true.\nUnfortunately, this ideal is hardly ever realised in practice. Like the\ncorrespondent who has been quoted, most dreamers, however sure they\nmay afterwards claim to have been about their premonition, hardly ever\nthink of sending their prediction to the Society. However, there are a\nfew cases in which predictions based upon psychic impressions have been\ndepositied with the S.P.R. before fulfilment.\nThe present writer has found 32 such cases in the S.P.R. files. Not all\nwere dream cases, but that does not matter for our purpose. The interest-\ning thing is that not one of the predictions deposited with the Society\ncame true ; even though some of the people making the prediction were\nsupposed to be almost invariably correct in their forecasts. Various\npredictions related to the two great wars. There were eight false predic-\ntions of the time the 1914-1918 war would end, and two about the end of\nthe 1939-1945 war. Two psychic predictions sent up in 1938 were to the\neffect that there would be no war. There was one incorrect forecast of\nthe circumstances of Hitler's death. Nine forecasts of horse racing\nwinners made in 1946 and 1947 were all wrong. During 1938 and 1939\none lady sent up a great number of forecasts of horse races, but with only\nchance results. Two predictions related to political events which never\nmaterialised, one of them asserting, with extreme confidence that Great\nBritain would have a general election in 1946. There were three unfulfilled\npredictions of deaths, one of marriage, one of meeting a certain friend at\na club and one of winning a large sum on the football pools.\nA negative finding of this sort lends support to the theory that published\ninstances of precognition would be reduced to statistical insignificance if\nanyone were able to collect all the unfulfilled premonitions. The best\nway to settle the matter would be for more people to post their premonitory\nimpressions to the Society as soon as they are received. A request to this\neffect is now sent to every person who presents the Society with an account\nof a fulfilled precognition.\nAnother way to tackle the problem of selection is for individuals to\nrecord their dreams immediately on waking, to take particular care to\npreserve all their notes, an to find out what proportion of their recorded\n\flys] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 269\ndreams comes true. This procedure was actually carried out by J. W.\nDunne and reported in his book An Experiment with Time. Mr Dunne\nhas, however, been criticised because he refused to acknowledge the\nnecessity for certain elementary precautions in the collection of evidence\nfor the supernormal. The experiment was repeated in 1933 under the\nauspices of the Society of Psychical Research, when a number of people\nwere persuaded to keep a record of their dreams. 430 records of dreams\nwere collected, but the result in no way confirmed Mr Dunne's conten-\ntions (4). The Dunne experiment gained wide publicity, and by all accounts\nit has since been tried by a good many people. The fact that no successes\nhave been published rather suggests that Mr Dunne's \" experiment \",\nlike so many other experiments in psychical research, is not repeatable.\nIt would need to be done by someone who was in the habit of experiencing\napparently precognitive dreams before any positive result could be\nexpected ; but it is an experiment well worth doing under properly\ncontrolled conditions.\nRetrospective investigation of cases reported after the fulfilment can\nnever properly dispose of the chance coincidence hypothesis, but it\nis possible to imagine an example in which so many unlikely details are\nfulfilled as to provide a strong prima facie argument against chance co-\nincidence, however many unfulfilled cases there may have been. For\ninstance, if someone were killed in unexpected circumstances, and it were\nfound that this was in fulfilment of a prophecy which gave the name of the\nperson, the hour of his passing, and described in detail the unusual manner\nof his death, that would be, to say the least, strongly suggestive of pre-\ncognition. In all the reported cases, however, there are few, if any, which\ncome up to this standard of perfection.\nA case which is as good as any one comes across in the literature was\nthat reported by Dr Tenhaeff, in which a Dutch lady foresaw in a dream\nthe motor accident in which Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands was\ninjured in 1937 (5). The percipient, Mrs B., said to be a very simple\nperson, wife of a house-painter, consulted Dr Tenhaeff on the advice of\nsome friends. She was in a state of nervous tension which some people\nhad attributed to developing mediumship.\nTen days after the interview with him, Dr Tenhaeff received a letter\nfrom Mrs B. in which she related a vivid dream that had come to her the\nprevious night. In her dream she saw a motor accident at a level crossing.\nA car, which was in a hurry to cross, burst a tyre and ran into a lorry and\na gate. Someone was killed outright and she saw it was Prince Bernhard.\nTwo days later Prince Bernhard did, in fact, meet with a motor accident.\nThe circumstances were not quite as in the dream. The accident was not\nfatal and there was no burst tyre or level crossing. On the other hand,\nthe Prince's car did, in fact, collide with a lorry which had emerged from a\ngate at the foot of an embankment in front of a railway viaduct.\nThis case is good, both on account of the corroborative evidence and\nbecause of the seeming improbability of a chance fulfilment. Some people\nwould say it was sufficient proof of precognition, others would say it was\nnot. Dr Tenhaeff tells me he \" has asked a great many people to record\ntheir dreams \" so that we must regard this as a particularly striking\ninstance selected from a large number of cases. Then again. Prince\n\f270 D.J. West [Part\nBernhard was known to be a fast driver, and many people in Holland\nmay have had dreams of such a disaster. One only hears of this particular\ncase because it happened to take place a day or two before the accident.\nThat the details of the dream were vaguely similar to the actual occurrence\nmay well have been pure chance. And so the argument goes on ad\ninfifiitum.\nAnother very striking case of premonition of accidental death was sent\nto the Society by Mrs Schweizer in October, 1882 (6). The premonition\nconcerned the accidental death of her son Frederick in July, 1882 when\nhe was thrown from a horse and fatally injured. Eight days before the\naccident, Mrs Schweizer had a dream that she was walking along the cliff\nedge of a sea-front with her son Frederick and a stranger a little in advance.\nShe saw her son slip and fall down the cliff, gazing up at her in anguish as\nhe did so.\nIn her dream, Mrs Schweizer approached the man who was with her\nson and asked his name. \" Henry Irvin,\" he answered. \" Do you mean\n'\nHenry Irving, the actor? ' \" she asked.\nMrs Schweizer was very worried and told her elder son John about the\ndream. Frederick was at the time in business in Manchester, but instead\nof coming home when he had finished, he proceeded to Scarborough for a\nholiday. While there, Frederick Schweizer was introduced to a Mr\nHenry Deverell, and they went out riding together one afternoon. It was\non this occasion that the accident happened, but it was a fall from a horse\nand not down a cliff\" as in the dream.\nMrs Schweizer visited the spot and spoke to Mr Deverell, who she\nrecognised as the stranger in her dream. When she told him about it, he\nappeared much affected and explained that although his real name was\nDeverell, he took part in private theatricals at which he was invariably\nintroduced as Henry Irving, junior.\nNow this prediction is striking enough to make anyone stop to think.\nChance coincidence is clearly possible, but seems remote. The real point\nat issue is whether the account is accurate and well corroborated.\nThe version quoted here was sent to the Society by Mrs Schweizer three\nmonths after her son's death, and she had already given particulars to the\njournal Light. The essential features of the case were so clear cut and\ndramatic it does not seem probable that her account could be substantially\ndifferent from what actually took place.\nA search through the original records of the S.P.R. files revealed that\nseveral investigators had interviewed Mrs Schweizer, including both\nMyers and Gurney (the latter only a day or two before his death). It\nseems that the whole family was spiritualistic. Mrs Schweizer said that\nfor years after her husband's death he seemed to accompany her in her\nwalks. Her three sons were all mediums and on the day of Fred's burial\nboth his brothers were \" controlled \" by his spirit. Mrs Schweizer\ndescribed many other dramatic experiences. Psychic visions and striking\nexperiences with mediums were common with her. Eglinton had given\nseances at her house.\nA history of this kind usually means unreliable witnesses, but all the\ninvestigators seem to have been impressed by Mrs Schweizer and to have\naccepted the case without reserve.\n\f175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 271\nFor corroboration Mrs Schweizer says that her son John and Henry\nDeverell both signed an account written by her, and substantially the same\nas that given to the Society. This other account, obviously a most import-\nant document, was never sent to the Society and none of the investigators\nmention seeing it. This is a serious deficiency, and hardly remedied by\nI John Schweizer's letter of July, 1884, in which he gives consent to his\nname being used in connection with the case.\nThere seems to have been some confusion over the name Irvin, which\n! Mr Myers said was really Irvine, but that is perhaps not a very important\nslip. The important point is that the entire case rests upon the accuracy\nand truthfulness of the narrator, Mrs Schweizer and of her son John, who\nwas the only person who could testify to hearing about the dream before\nthe accident happened. In view of what is known of the excessive un-\nreliability of human testimony in psychic matters, this is not enough.\nThe Schweizer case has been quoted and discussed at length here because\nI\nit is the best example of apparent precognition that the present writer has\nbeen able to discover. Even this exceptional case is not quite conclusive.\nThe fact is, the perfect case is a myth. There is always a flaw somewhere,\neither in the circumstances of the experience or in the supporting evidence.\nEvery case in which there is the slightest flaw can conceivably be due\nto faulty reporting. This will always be the trouble until we have suflicient\nrecords of premonitory impressions sent to us before the fulfilment,\nto enable the argument to be refuted. In future investigations, this\nshould be kept clearly in view. No opportunity should be lost to impress\nupon the public the importance of posting to the Society for Psychical\nResearch, accounts of vivid dreams or impressions\u2014which might turn\nout to be precognitive\u2014as soon as they are received. If the impression is\nstrong enough for the percipient to tell other people about it at once (as is\noften the case, according to the published accounts), there is no reason\nwhy he should not also tell the Society.\nOne cannot do better in this connection than quote the words of Mrs\nHenry Sidgwick given at the end of her paper on premonitions, published\nin 1888 (which contained the case just quoted). So little have we progressed\nsince then, that her words are as applicable to the situation at the present\ntime as they were when she wrote them :\n\" It is clear from our evidence that many people, rightly or wrongly,\nbelieve themselves to have tolerably frequent premonitions. Here,\nperhaps, lies our best hope of obtaining certainty, one way or another, on\nthis at present perplexing question. These persons have it in their power\nto make a quasi experimental investigation of the subject. If they could\nmake a point of recording before fulfilment all dreams or other experiences\nwhich appear to be premonitory\u2014their records would, in a few years, go\nfar towards settling the question whether genuine premonitions exist or\nno.\"\nOf course, there are many more difliculties than that of eliminating\nchance coincidence, although a lot of space has been devoted to this\naspect because of its particular application to dream cases. There are\nseveral other snags attached to the investigation of dreams, some of them\ninherent in the subject matter of the premonitions.\ns\n\f272 D.J. West [Part\nIn his analysis of published instances, Mr Saltmarsh observed that:\nabout 34 per cent, of precognitive dreams were related to deaths. In the\nsearch for evidence this is a disadvantage if one only hears of the dream\n;\nafter its fulfilment, for all who have studied normal dreams are agreed that i\ndeath is a common topic. On the other hand, it becomes an advantage if\nthe prediction is sent in before the fulfilment, because the probability of\nthe death of a healthy individual within a given space of time can be\nestimated roughly from insurance statistics.\nIn the case of a prediction of accident or death, if the person involved\nis told about it, he may develop a subconscious apprehension which brings\nabout his own undoing.\nA case that might well have been caused in this manner is the follow-\ning (7):\nIn February, 1921, a lady had a dream of her husband breaking his arm\nand collar-bone. Next day, when he was setting off on a fox-hunt, she\ntold him her dream and asked him to take care. At the first fence his\nmare stumbled and he sustained a fracture\u2014-dislocation of his arm, but\nnot his collar bone. He denied being worried, or even thinking about his\nwife's dream.\nIn this case there is a second possibility. The wife herself may have \\\nbeen apprehensive. We are not told whether the gentleman was a reckless \\\nrider, in which case the wife might have had some cause for anxiety. In i\ncertain predictions of death it may be that some hint has been picked up\nnormally which later comes out in the form of a dream. For instance,, in\nanother case (8), a lady dreams of her fiancee's death a day or two in advance\nof its actual occurrence. Although she was with him only the day before\nhis death, she noticed nothing wrong, and she and her family had no idea !\nthat he was not in the best of health. The cause of death was angina\npectoris. It seems likely that during their association the lady must have\nobserved some signs of ill-health in her fiancee. Possibly their significance\nwas too awful for her to recognise them fully in her waking state.\nAnother fairly common topic for premonitory dreams, on an altogether\ndifferent plane from death, is the horse-race. In conversation it is not\nuncommon to hear of people dreaming of winners of races, but this is not\nthe kind of case that often finds its way into psychic literature. Even\nmore than in the case of deaths, horse-racing predictions have the\nadvantage that there is available a rough assessment (starting odds) of the\nprobability of chance fulfilment.\nThe great difficulty, of course, is that there must be so many people\ndreaming of horses just before an important race some of the dreams are\nbound to come true. In an amusing contribution to the Proceedings (9) an\neditor of an Australian paper recounts how faith in prophetic dreams grew\nto such an extent that people used to take heavy pork dinners in the hope\nof inducing dreams in which they would foresee the winner of the\nMelbourne Cup. On a very different footing is the case of a Quaker, Mr .\nJ. H. Williams, who had a vivid dream in which he foresaw correctly the\nfirst two horses of the 1933 Derby. (10) Mr Williams said he had no interest\nin racing, was opposed to betting, and did not know the names of any of\nthe horses running. In his dream, which he told to two independent\nwitnesses before the race, Mr Williams heard, as if in a wireless com-\n\f175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 273\nmentary, the name of the winner, Hyperion, and the second, King Salmon.\nThis sounded a very good case of precognition, but it lost its force when\nMr Beechofer Roberts pointed out that Hyperion started as a favourite,\nwith King Salmon firmly established as second. If anyone were going to\nforecast the result on normal grounds, they might reasonably have\npredicted in the same way as Mr Williams's dream.\nA much better case, in fact the best instance of racing forecasts the\nSociety has printed, appeared in the JoMraa\/ recently (11). Mr John Godley\nhad four dreams of winners, all of which came true. Three of the dreams\nwere well substantiated, in fact considerable profit was made by people\nbacking his forecasts and the combined odds were significant. Mr Godley\ndeclared that these were the only dreams of the kind he had had. We\nhave to take his word on that point, but even granting that, the case is still\narguable. The odds were not so long as to exclude coincidence and it is\nalways possible that John Godley, who studied racing, had picked up\nsome good hints which came out in the form of dreams. There is no\nproof that Mr Godley did not have unfulfilled dreams which were not\nsent to the Society. Incidentally, a fifth dream, sent in to the Society some\nmonths later, was not fulfilled.\nOnce again we see how essential it is that the prediction should be sent\nto the Society as it is made. Furthermore, the subject matter must be\nsuch as the dreamer could neither infer by a normal process of deduction\nnor bring about by any action of his own.\nThere is a line of argument, often raised in connection with spontaneous\ncases, which purports to prove their supernormality by demonstrating\ntheir consistence of character. On a suggestion of Whately Carington's,\nSaltmarsh tried to apply this form of argument to precognitions. He\nobserved, and demonstrated (by means of a 2 x 2 table and a chi squared\ncalculation) that the proportion of precognitions relating to deaths was\nsignificantly different in dream cases than it was in cases in which the\npremonition came in the form of a hallucination (12).\nGranting this interesting difference, it is not clear that it must necessarily\nhave a supernormal explanation. It may be that very emotional impres-\nsions, such as deaths, whether they be psychic impressions or normal\nimpressions, whether they be fulfilled or not, are specially favourable to\nthe production of visions and hallucinations. Until it can be shown that\nthis normal explanation is untrue, Saltmarsh's observation cannot be\nclaimed as evidence for the supernormal.\nIn the sections which follow, various other normal hypotheses are\ndescribed. Some of these, such as faulty memory, bad reporting, hoaxing\nand deception, are also applicable to dream cases. They are dealt with\nlater for the sake of convenience of arrangement.\nPART TWO\nAPPARITIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS\nI. A Classic Example\nThe appearance of a phantom is a more striking occurrence than a\ndream, for the simple reason that it is much more unusual. Like the\n\f274 D.J. West [Part\nprophetic dream, the hallucinatory phantom is often said to herald\ndisaster. The person whose apparition is seen may be at the point of death,\nor undergoing some terrible crisis, at the very moment that his apparitional\ndouble is making its appearance elsewhere. Such cases, known in the\nliterature as death coincidences or crisis apparitions, are much more\nconvincing than dreams ;\nthey are, in fact, the very back-bone of the case\nfor the supernormal. Where the percipient is expecting nothing, and both\nthe ap]>arition and subsequent news of the death come as a complete\nsurprise, some sort of psychic linkage seems an obvious inference.\nAn example of a classic death wraith is that of Lieutenant David E.\nM'Connel, R.A.F., whose apparition was seen by a fellow officer on\nDecember 7, 1918, at almost the very moment he was killed in an aero-\nplane crash (13).\nDavid M'Connel was aged 18. He had been given the job of flying a\n\" Camel \" scout plane to Tadcaster, 60 miles from his own station. He\nwas accompanied by another flyer in an \" Avro \" plane. They ran into\nfog on the way. M'Connel kept going, although his companion made a\nforced landing. Hours later he reached Tadcaster, only to be killed\ninstantly in a nose-dive crash while preparing to land. The time of his\ndeath was given by his wrist-watch, which was found stopped at 3.25 p.m.\nBack at M'Connel's camp-room, at the aerodrome at Scampton,\nLieutenant Larkin was smoking and reading by the stove fire. Some-\ntime between 3.20 and 3.30 p.m. Larkin heard a familiar clatter approach-\ning and M'Connel's voice calling out \" Hello boy! \" Larkin turned in\nhis chair and saw M'Connel standing half in and half out of the room,\nholding on to the door knob. He remarked that he had had a good trip,\nand then closed the door and went out.\nAt 3.45 p.m. Lieutenant Garner-Smith came in and said, \" I hope\nMac gets back early.\" Larkin told him he had already arrived. When\nthat evening Larkin learned that M'Connel had been killed he could not\nat first believe it.\nThis is probably the best case of its kind in the Society's collection.\nLieutenant Garner-Smith confirms that Larkin told him of M'Connel's\napparent visit only twenty minutes after its occurrence, and before either\ncould have known of the death. Any ordinary explanation seems highly\nunlikely, although several possibilities are cenceivable.\nThe rest of this paper is concerned with non-psychic factors in such\ncases. It will be of interest to see how many of these normal hypotheses\ncan be applied to the M'Connel case ; for it is obvious that all counter-\nhypotheses must be disposed of before assuming that the true explanation\nis supernatural.\nn. Fraud\nHoaxing is often advanced as an explanation of psychic stories. It is\na difficult charge to refute, for it must be admitted that in the collection of\nspontaneous psychic experiences the investigator has little protection\nagainst being led astray by wilful deception. In the M'Connel case, for\n.instance, if Lieutenant Larkin, who said he saw the apparition, and the\nfriend who confirms his statement were for some reason not speaking the\ntruth, there would be no need for further explanation.\n\flyj] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 275\nOf course, pure lying seems an improbable explanation in any particular\ncase, although there is no doubt that that is what sometimes happens.\nIn such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to detect, because of the\nlack of obvious motive, other than the pleasure of deception for its own\nsake, or the desire to foist bogus \" experiences \" upon an unappreciative\nscientific world.\nAn extraordinary instance of pointless deception was the case of Mr\n! and Mrs Brown (pseudonyms) who set out to hoax the S.P.R. with some\nspirit messages (14).\nMr and Mrs Brown called at the S.P.R. rooms in July, 1922 and said\nthat they had been attending a private circle at which some veridical\ncommunications had been received from an unknown French soldier. Mr\nJones, at whose house the sittings were held, wrote to the S.P.R. at Mr\nBrown's instigation. He explained that- the circle consisted of himself,\nhis wife, his sister, and Mr and Mrs Brown. Remarkable phenomena had\nbeen obtained, including raps and the overturning of a 25-lb. table without\ncontact. The most interesting incident, however, was the French soldier\ncommunication\n.\nIn October, 1922 Mr Brown and Mr Jones were interviewed by Miss\nNewton, at that time the Secretary of the S.P.R. They gave her notes\nof the sittings and also some relevant correspondence.\nAccording to the sitting notes for April 22nd, 1922 communications\nwere received in French from one Bernard Lebecq (pseudonym) who\nstated that he was a soldier killed in the war and came from the town of T.\nin France. On July 8th he came again, gave the name of his regiment, and\nsaid he had been a wine dealer and had died at the age of 35 on July 3rd,\n19 1 6. He asked the sitters to write to an address in T. and tell his mother\nthat Jean was happy.\nAmong the documents tendered was a copy of a letter from Mr Brown\nto Mme Lebecq. The reply was postmarked \"Paris, July nth\", and\nwas signed \" Emille C. \". Monsieur C. stated that Mme Lebecq was\nblind and almost out of her mind and that the loss of her two sons Jean\nand Bernard in the war had left her without any family.\nThere was a copy of a second letter in which Mr Brown explained the\ncircumstances and asked for details of Bernard's birthplace, occupation,\nregiment, age and date of death. Monsieur C.'s reply came from an\naddress in Belgium. He was able to give all the required details, and they\ntallied exactly with what had been given at the English sittings.\nBernard came through once more at a sitting on July 30th, at which a\nMr Robinson (pseudonym) was present. Mr Robinson asked a friend in\nBelgium to make some inquiries about Monsieur C. It was found that\nthe Belgian address from which Monsieur C. was supposed to have\nwritten was the address of a house destroyed in the war.\nA member of the S.P.R. living in France was asked to make inquiries\nat T. He discovered that there was no such regiment as the one to which\nBernard was supposed to have belonged. There was no record of any\nBernard Lebecq killed in the war. Mme Lebecq and her address in T.\nwere likewise both non-existent.\nMr Jones was informed of these findings and he started investigations\non his own account. He confirmed the findings with regard to Lebecq,\n\f276 D.J. West [Part\nand showed that Monsieur C. was also mythical. The whole case turned i\nout to be an elaborate hoax perpetrated by Mr Brown. The communica-\ntions were not veridical and all the supposed verifications were faked.\nIn apparitional cases, fraud, especially the falsification of documents, is\nvery difficult to detect. In the following case an attempt at hoaxing the\nSociety's investigators succeeded and the fraud remained unsuspected\nuntil years later, when one of the participants confessed.\nThe case was published in Phantasms of the Living (15) accompanied by\nlengthy correspondence and the usual collection of confirmatory evidence.\nThe percipients were interviewed by Gurney, who wrote :\n\"Personal acquaintance has completely confirmed the impression made on\nme by the letters of these gentlemen, that they had observed the phenomena,\nwhich were a complete surprise to them, with intelligence and care.\"\nThus can appearances deceive even the most experienced of investigators.\nThe opening letter of the case was from Mr Sparks, who declared he\nhad been in the habit of mesmerising a fellow student of naval engineering\nnamed Cleave. On Friday, January 15th, 1886 young Mr Cleave said he\nwould try to make himself appear to a lady friend. Mr Sparks obligingly\nput him into a mesmeric trance, during which his apparition was supposed\nto have visited the young lady.\nTwo other students who were present vouched for the truth of the\nmesmeric experiment. A letter was produced from the young lady con-\ncerned to the effect that the apparition of Mr Cleave had appeared to her.\nLong afterwards it was placed on record that Mr Cleave had confessed\nthat the affair of the apparition was a hoax (16).\nThis case was as well \" authenticated \" as most of the S.P.R. collection,\nand yet it was a fraud. It is a matter for speculation in how many of the\ncases that have been accepted as genuine, fraud remains undetected and\nunconfessed.\nA recent case of motivated fraud is a psychic story that was told the\npresent writer in April, 1947 by a friend of his, here called Dr A. The\ncase is entirely without corroboration, and is given here only as illustration\nof the many unsuspected possibilities against which the investigator has\nto be on his guard.\nDr A. lived with an elderly aunt. One morning, on coming down to\nbreakfast he found the aunt crying bitterly. When he asked her what\nwas the matter, she explained that she had had a horrible dream about\nher brother, in which there had been a lot of flames. She was sure that\nsomething had happened to him.\nDr A. dismissed the idea, but when he came to read his mail, he found\na letter telling him of the death of his aunt's brother and explaining that\narrangements had been made for the body to be cremated.\nIt was indeed a striking confirmation of the dream, and Dr A., although\nsceptical about such matters, accepted it as an example of telepathy.\nOnly afterwards, when he was talking to a friend about it, did he guess the\nexplanation.^ His old aunt had been worried about her brother. On\n^Dr A. did not verify his explanation, which must therefore be regarded as\npurely hypothetical. As already explained, this story is only quoted to show what\nmight happen if the investigator is not on the look-out for unsuspected possi-\nbilities.\n\f175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 277\nlooking through the post one morning, she had seen a letter addressed to\nDr A. in what she recognised as the handwriting of her brother's daughter.\nFilled with anxiety she had broken open the envelope and read the letter.\nIt told of her brother's death, of the arrangements of his cremation, and\nadvised Dr A. not to trouble his aunt about the matter until all was over.\nAshamed at having opened someone else's letter, the aunt had stuck the\nflap of the envelope down once more and said nothing about having read\nit. All the same, she had wanted Dr A. to know she was aware of her\nbrother's' death, so that she could please herself about attending the\nfuneral. She had therefore invented the tale about the dream.\nThis is an example of a case nipped in the bud. One can imagine how\neasily it might have been mistaken for a psychic incident if Dr A. had been\nless observant and had failed to notice the old lady's prior contact with\nhis correspondence.\nIt must be understood that examples of this kind are unusual. No\nexperienced investigator supposes that deliberate fraud accounts for very\nmany cases of apparitions, and the number who have been \" found out\n\"\nis extremely small. The average person who reports a psychic incident\nto the Society is all too earnest and sincere, not at all the type of person to\nplay a practical joke. However, it would be difficult to establish this\nopinion, which is a matter of personal judgment, on strictly logical\ngrounds that would satisfy the resolute sceptic.\nIII. Mistaken Identity\nA proportion of the recorded cases, especially those in which the\napparition was seen out-of-doors or in some public place, may be accounted\nfor by mistaken identity. The \" apparition \" is really a living person who\nbears an accidental resemblance to the presumed agent.\nOur powers of recognition are not infallible, and human features are\nnever so distinctive that confusion cannot arise. Often enough one hears\nthe phrase, \"I saw your double today.\" If such an event should happen\nto coincide with the death of the person whose double was encountered,\nthe percipient is very liable to conclude that he has seen a genuine psychic\napparition.\nThe story reported to the S.P.R. by Professor Macneile Dixon in 1912\nis a good illustration of the type of experience that might be a case of\nmistaken identity (17).\nThe incident took place at a London hospital in March, 1912. A\npatient mentioned to a nurse one morning that the matron had been in\nthe ward at about i a.m. She walked in, looked at the fire, and then went\nout again. He recognised her by the cap and uniform. The night sister,\nbefore she went off duty, had also been told that the matron had been in\nthe ward during the night. Two of the patients swore they had seen her.\nIt could not have been the matron in the flesh that the men had seen,\nbecause the night sister had taken a cup of tea to her room at 12.30 a.m.\nThe matron said that after the sister's visit she had fallen asleep almost\nimmediately, and had certainly not been near the ward in question.\nMrs Sidgwick visited the hospital and questioned the matron, the night\nsister and the nurse. The patients were no longer available. It was\nexplained that the matron had been concerned about the coal shortage\n\f278 D.y. West [Part\nand anxious to be as economical as possible. This may have been the\nreason for her apparition seeming to take such an interest in the ward fire.\nThe evidence for the supernormal here is very flimsy. Granted that\nmatrons wear a different head-dress from ordinary nurses, might not the\nfigure have been some unfamiliar sister or perhaps an assistant matron,\nwith a slightly different uniform? This aspect of the case does not appear\nto have been investigated very conscientiously.\nAnother explanation is that the figure really was the matron. The idea\nof coal fires preying on her mind may have brought on an attack of\nsomnambulism in which she went to inspect the fire in the ward. It is\nnot mentioned whether the matron was asked if she had ever walked in\nher sleep.\nThis suggestion calls to mind another interesting case (18). The story\nruns as follows :\nMr X was a respectable tradesman and president of a small club which\nmet once a month at a public house at the end of the street in which he\nlived. A short time before one of the meetings he was taken very ill.\nThe club met as usual, and its members left a vacant chair in honour of\ntheir absent president. When the time came to adjourn, they were aghast\nby the entrance of an apparition of their president. The figure walked\ndeliberately and took its place in the vacant chair. Then it looked round\nfor a short while in silence, rose, and retired, leaving the members to talk\nover the strange visitation. Next morning they heard the news that their\npresident had died at about the time his wraith had appeared to them.\nThe affair became the talk of the town, and an account was drawn up\nand attested before a magistrate. Three years later the old nurse who had\nattended Mr X in his last illness made a dying confession. She had left\nMr X to get something from a nearby shop. In her absence, he had got\nup and left the house, and she had no doubt but that it was Mr X himself\nwho had so surprised the members of the club down the street. When he\nreturned, Mr X collapsed on the bed and died almost immediately. The\nnurse had never dared to reveal what had happened for fear of losing her\nprofessional reputation.^\nAn interesting case was reported in Journal, Vol. X, p. 303, which,\nalthough not psychic, shows the extraordinary situations that can arise as\na result of misrecognition.\nMrs Piddington had invited a friend to lunch, but received no reply.\nOn inquiry it was found that the friend thought she had met Mrs Pidding-\nton in the street and given the reply verbally. This might easily have\nbeen regarded as a telepathically inspired apparition had not Mrs\nPiddington's friend met the same lady again and discovered that they had\nboth mistaken each other for someone else.\nIn the M'Connel case (quoted at the beginning of this part) the appari-\ntion was so realistic that it might have been an example of mistaken\nidentity. In favour of this explanation is the fact that the figure appeared\nat a base where there would have been other young airmen wandering\nabout. Against it are the facts that Larkin knew M'Connel very well by\n' No original authority or confirmatory testimony is put forward in connection\nwith this case, which must therefore be regarded as purely illustrative.\n\f175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 279\nsight, that the figure appeared only a few feet away in a well-Ut room,\nthat it was wearing what Larkin recognised as M'Connel's special cap\nand that it made a remark about the flight.\nIV. Deceptive Memory and False Testimony\nOne feature stands out above all others from a study of memory, and\nthat is the unreliability and deceptiveness of the faculty. Experience of\nthe Court Room shows how often a genuine effort at recollection can result\nin the depiction of events, not as they actually occurred, but in the way the\nwitness would have liked them to appear.\nPsychological distortion of memory is especially evident in psychic\nmatters. In reciting a psychical experience, the narrator tends to remember\nin detail, or to exaggerate, points which favour the supernormal, while\ncompletely forgetting points which fit in with a naturalistic explanation.\nThis unwitting falsification results in more pseudo-psychic cases than\ndoes deliberate fraud. It is a very common mechanism, but the ordinary\nliterature of psychical research gives the reader no inkling of its extent.\nThe published cases are only the cream from a much larger number\nwhich either lack confirmation or which investigation exposes as tall\nstories. Only about one per cent of the psychic incidents reported to the\nSociety for Psychical Research can be authenticated well enough for\npublication.\nA great deal has been written about the unreliability of human testimony\nin relation to the physical phenomena of the seance room (19). Fewer people\nrealise that experiment has shown that observations of ordinary incidents\noutside the seance room are almost as faulty (20). Testimony regarding\nhallucinations is equally questionable, perhaps more so, the only essential\ndifference being that the errors are more difficult to detect in the absence\nof any objective record.\nIt is an interesting problem (but one which cannot be enlarged upon\nhere) why biassed testimony and distorted memories are met with so often\nin psychic matters. The question is one of universal yearning after some\nsign that human beings are not just the doomed puppets which the brutal\nfacts of decay and death suggest. The matter has been thoroughly dis-\ncussed in an excellent thesis by Dr Lawton (21).\nThe value of apparitions as evidence for the supernormal lies in their\napparently constant association with death, which argues for something\nmore than chance coincidence. The first essential in investigation is to\nmake sure that the alleged coincidence with death is valid, and not just a\ntrick of memory due to previous expectation. A case in point is that of\nSir Edmund Hornby (22).\nIt was Sir Edmund's habit to allow newspaper reporters an interview\nduring the evening to get his Vv'ritten judgments for the next day's paper.\nOne night the judge was awakened by a reporter entering his bedroom\nand asking for a dictated precis of his judgments. The judge indignantly\nrefused and admonished the reporter for breaking into his bedroom at\nhalf past one in the morning. The reporter refused to go and an argument\nensued.\nFearful of awakening his wife with the commotion, the judge at last gave\nin and let the reporter take down in shorthand the gist of the judgment.\n\f28o D.J. West [Part\nThe man seemed satisfied and left the room. Lady Hornby then awoke,\nthinking she had heard voices, and her husband told her what happened.\nNext morning news came that the reporter had died as a result of heart\ndisease at the very moment the judge had been interviewing his apparition.\nBeside the body was the reporter's note book. It contained the usual\nheading for the judgment, followed by a few lines of undecipherable\nshorthand. Investigation showed that the reporter could not possibly\nhave left his house and visited the judge, who lived a mile and a quarter\naway.\nThis case broke down when a critic pointed out that the reporter's\ndeath had taken place three months before Sir Hornby supposed. The\nassertion was verified and Sir Hornby was forced to admit that his memory\nhad played him a most extraordinary trick with reference to the co-\nincidence in time between vision and death (22b).\nThe census of hallucinations carried out by the S.P.R. at the end of the\nlast century contains some most interesting figures in relation to biassed\nmemory in psychic cases (23). The investigators set out to determine what\nproportion of spontaneous hallucinations in sane people coincided with\ndeaths. As a preliminary, they went into the question of the remembering\nof non-veridical hallucinations. It was found that reports of non-veridical\nhallucinations which they had collected showed a preponderance of\nrecent cases. Consider the following table :\nHallucinations Classified According to Dates\nReported as happening\nType Within ten Over ten Undated\nyears years\n(recent) (remote)\nVisual 460 529 123\nAuditory -\n223 136\nTactile 96 42 41\nTotal 779 706\nExpected proportion, recent\n:\nremote cases, assuming equable\n779 2062 distribution.\n{From tables IV, VII and VIII of Census Report.)\nHallucinations Classified by Dates (cont'd.)\nRecognised\nDate uf Occurrence All Types Human Forms\nIn last 3 months\n45i\n|35\nOver 3 months but not over 12 months\n\u201e I year 2 years 57 19\n3 >. 47 15\n4 - 39 13\n)\u00bb 4 ^' n n 5 55 15\n\f175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 281\nRecognised\nDate of Occurrence\n5 but not over 6 months\nAll Types Human Forms\n17\n5 years\n6 \u201e\n7\n44\n42\n29\n28\n32\n12\n8\n. 9 10\nThere was no reason to suppose that hallucinations were really becoming\nmore frequent with the progress of the years. The obvious explanation\nwas that non-veridical cases were quickly forgotten. If hallucinations\nwere easily remembered, each year would contain approximately the same\nnumber of cases, but in point of fact the longer the lapse of time, the\nfewer the cases reported.^\nIt was found that the three separate months of the most recent quarter\nyear contained an approximately equal number of recognised apparitions,\nso that it could be assumed that only a negligible proportion of this type\nof case was forgotten within three months. From the number reported in\nthe last three months, one could obtain a fair approximation to the actual\nfrequency of cases. It was estimated that the total number reported had\nto be multiplied by four to compensate for the ones forgotten.\nVery different was the situation of those cases which were claimed as\nveridical by the people who had experienced them. Here the bias was in\nthe opposite direction. The census collection of alleged death coincidences\ncontained a disproportionately large number of remote cases, a fact which\nstrongly suggested that many were apocryphal.\nThe figures of the census show eleven cases of death coincidences said\nto have occurred in the preceding ten years. Taking into account the\naverage age of the census population, this leads to an expectation of 29\ncases over ten years old. Actually fifty-one such cases were reported.\nIt would have been better if the census had been on a larger scale, and\nthe investigators had had more such cases to work with. It would then\nhave been possible to take a shorter span of time than ten years for\ncomparison. If, for example, the investigators had been able to compare\nthe number of cases occurring in the preceding twelve months with the\ntotal number, an even bigger disproportion might have been discovered.\nThe census findings prove that the human mind not only quickly\nforgets non-coincidental cases, but that in the course of time the ones\nthat are remembered become embroidered with coincidental features they\ndid not in fact possess. This conclusion has always been suspected on\ncommon-sense grounds. The census serves not merely to verify the\nsuspicion, but to give some measure of the extent of the effect.\nThe obvious remedy is to make it a rule never to accept a percipient's\nunsupported word. One should always search for such things as diary\nentries and letters and compare the date they bear with the official record\n^Further analysis showed that most of the vague auditory or tactile impressions,\nwhich might have been illusions, were forgotten in a matter of weeks. Apparitions\nof recognised human forms were remembered much longer, so only that type was\nincluded in census estimate of the proportion of apparitions coinciding with\ndeaths. Even with this restriction, generous allowance had still to be made for\ncases forgotten.\n\f282 D.J. West [Part\nof the death. In the M'Connel case, for example, it would be very\ndifficult to raise deceptive memory as an explanation, because the percipient\nand the principal witness are both quite clear that the apparition came\nbefore the news of M'Connel's death, and they both recorded this fact in\nwriting a week later.\nV. Expectancy and Suggestion\nApparitions heralding deaths, such as the M'Connel case that has been\nquoted earlier, are striking because of the coincidence in time of two\nunusual events. M'Connel could only die once, and that might happen\nany time in a life span of seventy odd years. Larkin had probably never\nseen an apparition before. The odds against the events corresponding\nalmost to the minute by chance coincidence are too fantastic to contem-\nplate. There must be some causal relationship, probably telepathic.\nThus do most psychical researchers state their case, but as it stands\nthe argument implies several unwarranted assumptions. First, hallucina-\ntory figures by no means so rare as most people imagine. The census of\nhallucinations, which will be discussed at greater length in the next\nsection, showed that ten per cent of normal sane people admit to at least\none hallucination. Actually, hallucinations are far commoner than the\nfigures would indicate, because of the marked tendency to forget them\nvery quickly. In this respect hallucinations resemble dreams, most of\nwhich are forgotten either almost immediately on waking or else shortly\nafterwards.\nSecond, the probability of imminent death varies with state of health\nand other circumstances. In the M'Connel case, for example, when the\nflyer was lost in the fog, one might almost say there was an expectancy of\ndeath.\nThird, where the percipient has reason to suppose a death is likely, the\nexpectancy in his own mind may actually generate the hallucinatory\napparition. In other words, instead of the hallucination representing a\ntelepathic \" message \" from outside, it may merely be a \" message\n\"\nexpressing the percipient's own anxiety.\nExpressed like this, the expectancy explanation sounds far-fetched, but\nthere is considerable evidence that expectancy is a most important factor\nin the aetiology of hallucinations.\nAs will be explained in the next section, the majority of hallucinations\ncorrespond with nothing in particular, and require no explanation from a\npsychical research stand-point. Probably they have a physical basis,\nalthough it is as yet obscure. The visions produced by fever or by\nmescaline are well known, but how these agents act is something of a\nmystery. The highly integrated visions they produce could hardly be due\nto a direct nervous stimulation ; more likely they work by so disorganising\nthe nervous system as to result in inco-ordinate mental fantasies. Sporadic\nhallucinations of the type that give rise to psychic cases probably have a\ngreater psychological element in their genesis.\nOne noticeable feature is that the percipient (ex. Lieut. Larkin) is\nusually sitting quietly at home when the hallucination comes. Apparitions\nin busy, crowded places are exceptional.\nThe content of hallucinations (which are after all only waking fantasies)\n\f175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 283\nis probably determined in much the same way as the content of dreams.\nIf a person is going to have a hallucination, anxiety about a friend may\nwell cause it to take the likeness of that friend.\nIn the field of hypnosis, there are abundant examples of hallucinations\nproduced by verbal suggestion. Similar phenomena have been demon-\nstrated in the unhypnotised. Alice Johnson has described a very interesting\ncase (24) of a Mr Griinbaum who was so sensitive that the most casual\nsuggestion was liable to give him a hallucination. Mr Griinbaum's\nexperiences started when he made some successful attempts at invoking\nvisions by autosuggestion. He soon found that visions were coming to\nhim without any seeking on his part.\nOn one occasion Mr Griinbaum had been reading\u2014in the S.P.R.\nJournal for 191 1 \u2014about sitters feeling touches in the dark in the presence\nof a young physical medium. When he went to bed that night, just as\nhe was on the verge of falling asleep, a thought shot through his mind :\n\" Shall I touch you a little? \" Directly afterwards he felt a blow on the\nhead and saw a white silhouette of a hand on a black background. He\nrecognised the hand as being from an illustration in the Annals of Psychic\nScience (Vol. I, pp. 210-212).\nStill more to the point was an instance in which the suggestion of a\ncasual phrase in a book brought about a fully-fledged apparition. Mr\nGriinbaum had accidentally alighted on an old book on Faust and in\nlooking through it had come across a magic formula. When he was lying\nin bed, the words of the formula flashed through his mind :\n\" Tetra-\nagrammation-Adonai-Agla.\" Shortly afterwards Mr Griinbaum was\nconsiderably frightened by the appearance of a horrifying Mephisto-\nphelian spectre at the foot of his bed. It was a broad figure with vibrating\nsmoky-blue outlines. There can be no doubt that the hallucination had\nbeen suggested by the magic conjuration.\nThe census investigators had quite a lot to say about the effects of\nsuggestion and expectancy. Selected cases were quoted in which there\nwere clear correspondences between the substance of the hallucination\nand the subject occupying the percipient's thoughts : for instance, the\ncase of Mrs T. E. who, while waiting in a hotel room for her husband, saw\nhim approach and rose to meet him, only to find that the figure was a\nspectre which vanished before her eyes. A similar modern instance,\nquoted in Mr Tyrrell's book Personality of Man, happened to Miss Ina\nJephson in November, 193 1 (25). She received a letter from her lawyer\nsaying he was enclosing a cheque. Not having time to attend to it on\narrival, she took it out with her, peering into the envelope occasionally to\nsee that the cheque was safely there. When she got home, the cheque\nhad disappeared, although she was absolutely convinced that she had seen\nand handled it shortly before, and could remember its marble pale colours\nand the look of the writing on it. She found out afterwards that by an\naccident the real cheque had never been enclosed with the letter. The\ncheque she had \" seen \" on looking into the, envelope was an hallucination\nbrought on by her expectant state of mind. Mr Tyrrell also described a\ncase in which someone turned on the switch of a wireless and saw the\ndial hght up when in fact it was not working at all. A friend of the\npresent writer reported independently a precisely similar experience.\n\f284 D.J. West [Part\nThe census investigators described also how sHght normal impressions\nmay lead to hallucinations through the effect of suggestion. The un-\nexplained opening of a door might form the nucleus of a phantasmal\nexperience in which the figure seems to walk into the room. In certain\ncases the investigators were able to trace the development of the hallucina-\ntion step by step, one percept suggesting and leading on to the next. In\nthis way, a figure seen first apparently by reflection in a mirror may after-\nwards be viewed directly. Apparent physical effects, displacement of\nobjects, opening of doors, and so forth, are subsidiary hallucinations\nsuggested by the main percept. Apparitions seem to obey physical laws,\ncast shadows, disappear behind screens, and so on, only because the\nenvironment suggests to the percipient that this is what should happen.\nIn the hypnotic trance the subject's attention is completely taken up with\nthe hypnotist, so that he is in effect isolated from the suggestions of the\nenvironment. This is the reason why the visions produced by hypnotic\nsuggestion take hold of the mind with such intensity and exclusiveness\nand do not fit in with the surroundings like the typical apparition.\nWhile the cases here quoted are extreme examples, they are supported\nin some degree by ordinary experience. For instance, there are the mild\nhallucinations which people often experience while waiting for someone.\nThey may seem to spot the familiar face of the person they are expecting,\nonly to be disillusioned on closer inspection when the features resolve\nthemselves into those of a total stranger.\nIt must be stressed, however, that although expectation and\/or sugges-\ntion frequently determines the content of a hallucination, expectation is\nnot always the sole cause of its occurrence. If that were really so, we should\nbe constantly hallucinated. As Mr Tyrrell points out, people in thousands\nevery day see and hear things contrary to what they expect, and people\nexpect and desire intensely without being hallucinated.\nThe psychical researcher is not so much interested in why some people\nsometimes have hallucinations, as why hallucinations when they do occur\nshould occasionally correspond to. external events. We do not under-\nstand the causes of dreams and hallucinations, but we know that their\ncontent can be guided by the beliefs, hopes and fears of the percipient.\nThis being so, a case cannot be used as evidence for telepathy if the\ninformation presented to the percipient be no more than what he might\nhave thought out for himself.\n'\nThe following case (38), collected in 1944 by the present author and Mr\nD. H. Hyde, another member of the Society, is an illustration of the sort\nof experience that can be readily accounted for by the influence of\nsuggestion.^ The fact that the case presents no veridical features is\ncurious. One would expect, with a lapse of time of fifteen years between\nthe apparition and the report, that some sort of apocryphal coincidence\nwould have been woven into the story.\nThe percipients were Mr and Mrs H. of Liverpool (full names and\naddresses in the Society's possession). Their statements were taken down\nin writing, typed out, and then submitted to them for correction and\nsignature (25).\n^ Other explanations are not included, but the one put forward seems to make\nthe least assumptions.\n\f175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 285\nTestimony of Mrs H.\n\" In 1926 my mother died at the age of 52 as a result of heart failure\nfollowing Bright's disease. Some months later, I moved to a new house\nand remember feeling that, had my mother been alive, I would have\nliked her to have seen it and approved of it. I mentioned this feeling to\na woman friend, who said something about my mother watching over me.\nHowever, I paid no attention to this idea, and by 1929 the feeling had\nquite worn off and I had not got my mother on my mind at all. Apart\nfrom the one instance I am going to describe, I have had no other psychic\nexperiences and I am not a spiritualist.\n\" In the last week of April, 1929, just about a week before my sister's\nmarriage, my husband brought me a cup of tea in bed before he left for\nwork round about 6 to 6.30 a.m. (Mr H. is a tramway superintendent).\nI distinctly remember hearing the noise of my husband slamming the\ndoor behind him as he went out. At the very same moment I saw the\nhandle of my bedroom door turn and the door slowly open. My mother\nwalked noiselessly straight into the centre of the room and stood about\nfour feet from the bed.\n\" The apparition appeared absolutely life-like and real, but I was not\nafraid, only surprised. I could see the features clearly, and they were my\nmother's. She was wearing a nightgown which I recognised, and I\nparticularly remember the frills on the cuffs, which seemed to stand out,\nthough I don't remember the hands. She looked exactly as I remembered\nher in health, just before her sudden death. Her hair was sleek and parted\nin the centre, which was characteristic. The face was sallow and wore a\npained expression, and there was a handkerchief tied round the forehead.\nThis was just as she used to look in life when she had one of her frequent\nheadaches.\n\" I exclaimed, '\nOh Mum, whatever's the matter? '\nI rather think she\nshook her head then, but at any rate she replied, '\nI'm terribly worried.'\nThen she seemed to dissolve away all of a sudden. There was no fading\naway, she just vanished.\n\" I particularly remember noticing and being impressed by the fact that\nI found myself sitting up with the cup of tea still balanced on the palm of\nmy hand, from which I feel certain that I was wide awake. I was so\nabsorbed with what had taken place that I cannot remember what I did\nwith the tea or whether it was cold ; nor can I remember whether I found\nthe bedroom door open afterwards. I rather think it was not, otherwise\nI would have noticed it. Had I found it open I would probably have put\nit down to the vibration of the front door being slammed. There was no\none in the house except my baby son.\n\" The incident made a deep impression and left me in an unsettled\nframe of mind, but I could not connect what the apparition had said\nwith anything about which my mother might have been worried, unless\nit were my sister's forthcoming marriage. I carried on with some\nhousework, and when my husband returned at 9 a.m. I told him about\nmy experience. At 10.30 a.m. the same morning I went to see my sister's\nfuture mother-in-law (now deceased) and told her about it. Then, at\nabout II a.m., I visited my husband's mother (now deceased) and told\nher as well.\"\n\f286 D.J. West [Part\nIt will be seen from this account that Mrs H. fully admits that at one\ntime the idea of her mother's continued presence had been suggested to\nher. It is possible that her sister's marriage may have reinforced in her\nmind the idea of her mother, who would have been deeply interested in\n'\nthe event. The phrase \" I am worried \" may have been suggested by a\nhalf-conscious anxiety about the marriage, which actually turned out\nunhappily on account of many troubles, medical, financial and tempera-\nmental.\nThe same apparition appeared to Mr H. It was probably suggested by\nhis wife's prior experience. Mr H. had had psychic experiences before.\nThe fact that this particular hallucination took place after the wedding\nmay have been a consequence of Mr H.'s share in the celebrations.\nTestimony of Mr H.\n\" I recollect returning on the morning of my wife's experience. I\nthink she was sitting at the table eating when I came in. She seemed veiy\nquiet and said :\n'\nI've had an experience. After you left, the bedroom\ndoor opened and mother walked in. She put her hand to her forehead\nand said, \" I'm terribly worried \", and then vanished. I've been thinking\nabout it ever since.' I suspected at the time that my wife's experience\nmight have been the result of health conditions, although she appeared\nperfectly well. To prevent any possible bad after-effects, and to stop her\nbrooding over the matter, I made light of the affair and brushed it away as\nsoon as possible. However, I took careful note of succeeding events to\nsee whether anything would happen to justify the apparition's apprehen-\nsions, but I noticed nothing.\n\" My wife's sister was married on the 4th May following, and that night\nI shared a bed with my wife's brother in the house in which my mother-\nin-law had died. During the night (I afterwards noted it was about 3\na.m.) I felt a very cold hand touch my forehead. I supposed it must have\nbeen my father-in-law come into the room to speak to his son, so I tried\nto wake the latter by shaking him with all my strength and saying, 'Your\nfather is here.' I failed to rouse him, however (Mrs H. stated that her\nbrother was normally a heavy sleeper), and on looking round I saw the\nface and bust of my mother-in-law. The room was pitch dark, but I saw\nand recognised the features clearly, as the figure seemed to be illuminated\nby a brownish yellow light. The figure gazed at me without moving and\nseemed to be rather larger than life-size. The appearance was only\nmomentary and it vanished suddenly. . . .\n\" The following night I slept with my wife in another room, which\nhappened to be the one in which my mother-in-law had died. Once more\nI felt the touch of a cold hand and I looked up expecting to see the appari-\ntion, but there was nothing. I lit a candle and smoked a cigarette, exactly\nas before, but nothing happened. I fold my wife about it next morning.\nThe first experience I had found upsetting, but the second time I was\naffected much more slightly.\"\nIn the M'Connel case, which we have used as a typical example of a\ncrisis apparition, Lieut Larkin's vision of his brother airman may well\nhave been the result of a state of expectancy or anxiety. Larkin knew that\nhis friend had gone out on a flight. He must have known that the weather\n\f175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 287\nconditions were bad. There is no definite statement in either the printed\naccount or the original documents of the case as to whether Larkin knew\nalso that the companion plane had made a forced landing.\nIf some other pilot back from a trip had looked into the room, made a\ncasual remark and gone out again, Larkin would not normally have mis-\ntaken him for M'Connel. But the circumstances were unusual. He may\nhave been anxious (perhaps subconsciously) and on the look-out for\nM'Connel, in which case it would require a very slight hallucination\nindeed to convert the momentarily perceived voice and features of another\nman into those of the friend whose appearance was so much desired.\nVI. Chance Coincidence\nMost psychic apparitions convey only one piece of information, namely\nthat a particular person has just died. The scope for chance coincidence\nin these cases is more easily assessed than in dreams, which tend to cover\na multiplicity of topics. Here the issue is quite clear. Does the corres-\npondence between apparitions and the deaths of their real life counterparts\nhappen more often than one would expect by chance coincidence?\nAt first sight the question seems futile. One cannot conceive that cases\nlike that of Lieutenant M'Connel, seen at the very moment he was killed,\ncould be due to chance coincidence. To explain things away by invoking\nchance is such a facile method of escaping a logical impasse that the out-\ncome does not carry conviction.\nIt is to the credit of the early investigators, that although the chance\ncoincidence hypothesis must have seemed to them an absurdity, they\nrealised the need for a scientific answer to the question. They saw that\nthe argument depended upon the relative frequencies of coincidental and\nnon-coincidental hallucinations, so, in the true spirit of scientific investiga-\ntion, they set out to determine these frequencies by means of a census of\nhallucinations.\nCollectors were sent out to obtain answers to the following question :\nHave you ever, when believing yourself to be completely awake, had a\nvivid impression of seeing or being touched by a living being or inanimate\nobject, or of hearing a voice ; which impression, so far as you could dis-\ncover, was not due to any external physical cause?\nOf the 17,000 answers received, 2,272 were in the affirmative, that is to\nsay thirteen per cent of the people questioned admitted to having had a\nhallucination not accounted for by illness or intoxication.\nBefore any inferences are drawn one must be sure that this figure for\nthe total number of hallucinations is not an under-estimate, otherwise the\ndeath coincidences will seem to form a spuriously large proportion of the\ncases.\nUntruthfulness might account for some degree of under-estimation.\nThe census question asked only for a plain \" yes \" or \" no \" in the first\ninstance. A practical joker might say \" yes \" where he should say \" no \",\nbut this would lead to an over-estimate, which is an error on the conserva-\ntive side. Against this, some people might be too cautious to admit\nhaving had hallucinations. These people would probably refuse to\nanswer and so lessen the affirmative replies. This eflPect was actually\npresent, but it was counterbalanced by an error in the opposite direction,\n\f288 D.J. West [Part\ndue to collectors tending to select for questioning persons most likely to\ngive positive answers.^\nOne source of error with which the census does not seem to deal very\nadequately, is the complication of multiple hallucinations. In the first\ninstance, the census counted the number of percipients, but 381 percipi-\nents had experienced more than one hallucination. There was no difficulty\nwhen the hallucinations were specified and enumerated, but 28 percipients\nhad experienced more than one hallucination who could not say exactly\nhow many hallucinations they had had. The experiences of these\npercipients, whether veridical or no, were ignored. Actually, seven death\ncoincidences were excluded by this rule.\nIt is not clear that this method gives a good picture of the situation.\nIt might have been better to exclude all hallucinations and all death co-\nincidences that were not unique in the percipients' experience. The\nproblem is further complicated by the very real danger that percipients\nwho have had more than one hallucination will be reluctant to admit them,\nfor fear of being suspected of mental peculiarity.\nThe gross error introduced by the tendency to forget non-veridical\nhallucinations has already been described, and so has the unsatisfactory\nmethod whereby the efi^ect was allowed for in the census.\nWhen the adjustment had been made, the number of recognised, human\napparitions in the collection, corrected for forgetfulness by multiplying by\nfour, amounted to i ,300. Against this there were 65 recorded cases in which\nthe apparition occurred within 1 2 hours (either side) of the death of its agent.\nThe estimated number of death coincidences had now to undergo\ncertain corrections. An arbitrary deduction of 22 was made to allow for\npossible apocryphal cases, because, as already explained, there was an\nexcess of remote cases. A correction was made for the tendency of collec-\ntors to seek especially for coincidental cases. A good proportion of cases\nwere stated definitely not to have been known beforehand by the collector.\nFor the rest, a generous deduction of 11 cases was made. Two further\ncases were deducted because the apparitions were seen out of doors or in a\nbad light and might have been illusions. Altogether the 65 reported\ndeath coincidences were reduced by over fifty per cent.\nThe final corrected result was 30 death coincidences out of 1,300\nrecognised apparitions. That is to say, one in every 43 apparitions co-\nincided, within 24 hours, with its agent's death.\nThe census investigators considered this result highly significant. They\npointed out that the national death statistics showed that only one person\nin 19,000 dies in any given 24 hour span. This means that on an average,\nif only chance is at work, only one apparition in 19,000 should be a death\ncoincidence. After generous allowance had been made for all possible\nsources of error, the census had yielded an actual proportion of one death\ncoincidence in every 43 apparitions.\n^ In order to obtain some figures free from both these sources of error, the\ncensus investigators questioned random samples of the general population, such\nas were provided by dinner parties and other social gatherings. Samples in which\nany refusals were encountered were rejected. By this means, 626 replies were\nobtained, thirteen per cent of them being in the affirmative. This result shows\nthat the combined effect of the two sources of error mentioned was not very great\nand may be safely neglected.\n\f175] The Investigation of Spontaiwoiis Cases 289\nWhile these figures are certainly suggestive, they are not by any means\na statistical refutation of the chance coincidence hypothesis. Individuals\nare extremely variable with respect to the likelihood of death within 24\nhours, so variable indeed that an average figure for the whole population\nis useless when applied to such a small statistical sample as the census of\nhallucinations. The proper procedure would have been to examine each\ncase on its merits and make an estimate of the probability of each agent's\ndeath from such date as age and state of health.\nAnother criticism, far more serious than the statistical shortcomings,\ncuts across one of the basic assumptions upon which the census argument\nrests. In order that the result shall mean anything at all, all the death\ncoincidences included in the account must be genuine.\nIn assessing the probability of the genuineness of a death coincidence,\nsuch factors as have already been dealt with, namely hoaxing, deceptive\nmemory, mistaken identity or suggestion, must all be taken into account.\nBefore a case is accepted as genuine it is right to expect some independent\nevidence that the coincidence was as close as the narrator's memory would\nhave one believe. There should be an assurance that the percipient had\nno reason to expect the agent's death, as well as some testimony on the\nvital point that the hallucinatory experience came before the news of the\ndeath.\nThe census report includes accounts of 26 cases which were considered\nevidentially satisfactory, and if these 26 cases only had been counted, and\nproportionate reductions made for the effects already discussed, the result\nwould still have been highly suggestive. Unfortunately, even the 26\nprinted cases fail to conform to our present conception of elementary rules\nof evidence. In only six of the cases was there a claim that a written note\nhad been made before news of the death arrived. Of these six cases,\nthere was only one in which the note had been preserved. Even then it\nwas not satisfactory, as the lady who had made the note in her diary was\ntoo shy to put it in words. Instead she used symbols, the exact meaning\nof which she afterwards forgot. Of the other five cases in this group, one\nstands on the percipient's unsubstantiated word and in another the only\nconfirmation comes from a deceased witness's daughter. In a third case,\nthe hallucination might well have been due to expectancy, for it is recorded\nthat the agent, who was about to undergo a confinement, had told the\npercipient she v\/as expecting to die. Indeed, the expectancy objection\ncould be applied to five out of six cases, for in only one of them is there\nany statement to the effect that the percipient was not expecting the\nagent's death. Space will not permit an analysis of all 26 cases, but one\nor other of these general objections applies to nearly every one. The\ncensus claim to 26 evidential death coincidences is thus misleading. There\nmight be an odd case fairly well substantiated, but that could be just a\nchance coincidence.\nThe census result, far from being the last word on the subject, must be\nregarded as inconclusive. In arguing against chance coincidence, the\ncensus investigators, like their followers in later generations, forget that\nthey have to refute all other normal explanations as well. It is no use\ndealing with chance in isolation from all the other normal factors which\ncombine to produce the phenomenon of the psychic apparition. If all the\n\f290 D. J. West [Part\nrecorded cases had to be accepted, the chance coincidence hypothesis\nwould be untenable, but when deductions and allowances are made for all\nthe normal explanations that have been discussed, then it becomes feasible.\nNo single normal explanation will ever be found to fit the enormous\nvariety of reported phenomena.\nIf the very elaborate census investigation did not succeed in disproving\nthe chance coincidence hypothesis, the question is what type of evidence\nwould be conclusive. The great flaw in the census was that the final data'\nupon which the statistics were based had not been reduced to a clear-cut\nissue between chance and telepathy. It is no use proving statistical\nsignificance unless one can be sure that the result is due to psychic faculty\nand not to faulty reporting.\nIn the case of premonitions, it has always been recognised that the\nsovereign remedy from an evidential point of view is to collect the impres-\nsion before the verification. Precisely the same principle applies to\napparitional cases. If the people who see an apparition would only inform\nthe Society at once, instead of waiting for some sort of confirmation\nand then reporting the experience, we would have a much more useful\nset of data for evaluation. It would still have to be established that the\npercipient had no normal knowledge of the information conveyed by the\napparition, but otherwise cases reported at such an early stage, and\nverified later, would be proof against all the objections that have been\nmentioned.\nPerhaps this is an unreachable ideal, but if the same amount of energy\nwere devoted to its attainment as was expended upon the census we might\nget somewhere. If six hundred members of the Society were made\nthoroughly conversant with the need for reporting apparitions immediately,\none would expect a few examples in the course of the next year or so. If\nthe same appeal were addressed to a larger audience, by those who write\narticles and give lectures, the result would be obtained sooner. The great\nadvantage of such an investigation would be that the result would be either\npositive or negative and not indecisive, as most investigations in this field\nhave been up to date.\nVI. Quality of the Cases\nIn the literature of our subject there are constant references to the high\nquality of the cases published by the S.P.R. They are admired for the\namount of corroborative evidence which accompanies them, as well as for\ntheir highly veridical content.\nThe present writer has read through large numbers of cases in Proceedings\nand Journal, and it seems to him that in both respects their quality is\nover-rated. In the light of all the possible objections, and the obvious\nflaws in testimony of this kind, most of the cases seem worse than mediocre.\nThe best known cases, that are supposed to be the cream of the evidence\nfor telepathy, seem dubious on close inspection. The case of Robert\nMackenzie, (26) for instance, is often quoted roughly as follows :\nRobert Mackenzie presented himself to his employer in a dream and\nsaid that he was not guilty of what people thought. It was learned later\nthat the experience coincided with Mackenzie's accidental death by\nswallowing nitric acid. The first tidings, afterwards corrected, were that\n\f1 The Invcstigutiov of SpoiiUineous Cases 29\n1\nit was a deliberate suicide. What is more, the peculiar facial appearance\nof the apparition corresponded to the symptoms of nitric acid poisoning.\nThis account is superficially impressive, but becomes disappointing on\ncritical examination. In the first place the experience was a dream, and\none has to take into account the vast number of unreported non-veridical\ndreams.i\nOn receipt of the news of the suicide, the percipient told his wife that\nhe did not think Mackenzie had done it on purpose. This slender point\nis the only part of his testimony that can be checked, yet the case is\nfrequently quoted as evidential.\nPhantasms so often wear a deathly look that there is not much of a\ncoincidence in the similarity between the dying man's countenance and\nthe face seen in the dream. Lastly, the coincidence in time was not very\nclose : the dream took place two days after the accident.\nThis example would not have been worth quoting were it not typical of\nthe published cases, nearly every one of which have serious imperfections.\nThe fact is that good cases are far rarer than most psychical researches are\nwilling to admit.\nMiss Hilda Harding, a member of the Society, has been kind enough to\nread through numerous cases in the S.P.R. Journal for the purpose of\nstudying the lines of evidence which they contain. Miss Harding is\nparticularly well qualified for this task, combining the advantages of the\ntrained legal mind of the barrister with the sympathetic understanding of\none who has had psychic dreams and impressions herself. She writes as\nfollows :\n\" Notes on Evidence offered for '\nCases '\nquoted\nIN Journal of S.P.R.\"\n\" At the suggestion of the Research Officer, I arranged to go through\nthe '\nCases '\nquoted in the Journal of the Society starting at the year 1884\nand going on to the current issue with the object of trying to evaluate the\nevidence given in support of these cases (Spontaneous Impressions,\nHallucinations, Dreams). Having done fifteen volumes which form a\nrepresentative cross-section I have abandoned the task for the evidence\nseems to me to have little value for the unbiassed examiner, hardly any-\nthing emerging which could be called first-class. I was greatly struck by\nthe tendency of the cases to take the form provided by the '\nthought-\npattern '\nof the period\u2014for example, the early cases are far more naif\nlit makes a lot of difference whether an apparitional experience is a true\nhallucination or a dream. The former, being a much rarer occurrence, affords\nbetter evidence against chance correspondence. The case of Lieutenant M'Connel,\nwhich has been used as a standard example of a crisis apparition, could have been\na dream. In reporting the case, Lieutenant M'Connel's father pointed out that\nLarkin might have been dreaming, but this part of his letter did not appear in the\npublished account. It reads as follows :\n\" In his {i.e. Lieutenant Larkin's) written account he says that he was sitting in\nan easy chair before the fire in the room. ... I had particularly drawn Larkin's\nattention to the possibility of his being asleep at the time. . . . Sitting before a\nfire in any chair is conducive to sleep on occasion. But even if he had dreamed\nthat he saw my son, it could have been sufficiently extraordinary occurring at\nthat hour.\"\n\f292 D.J. West [Part\nthan those of later volumes by which time modern psychological ideas,\nparticularly with regard to telepathy, have percolated widely through\nmany strata of the population.\n\" From the nature of the circumstances governing the Cases real copper-\nbottomed evidence is almost impossible to come by. Ideally each\npercipient should be examined and cross-examined by competent persons\nimmediately after an incident has taken place and before repeated narra-\ntions of the experience has resulted in accretions of details which so overlay\nthe original. Such evidence as is offered in attempted corroboration\n\u2014\nstatements by relatives and friends, postmarked letters in which the\nexperience is described\u2014is often worth nothing. It merely proves that\nthe percipient purported to have such and such a supernatural experience\non a given date. Nothing is proved of the bona fide of the principal party.\nAgainst the mere word of the percipient we are obliged to offset all that\nlife has taught us of the strange results ensuing from lack of mental\nbalance, honest error, illusion, expectancy, suggestion and so forth, apart\naltogether from mischievous lying.\n\" In some of the cases investigators sought out the percipients and\nquestioned them, but the investigations do not sound sufficiently searching.\nA dispassionate unbiassed attitude is essential for this work and much\nskill and practice is required.\nH. H.\"\nVII. Insanity\nThe title of this section is perhaps a little mysterious. Unless one has\nhad personal contact with people claiming psychic experiences, it may be\ndifficult to imagine what insanity has to do with the subject. Of course\nthere are individuals, completely bereft of psychic sense, but with a\nrobust common-sense, who assume that if a person believes he has had a\npsychic experience he must be out of his mind. Most psychical researchers\nthink they can afford to look down upon such ignorant scoffers. But it is\ndangerous to ignore the voice of common-sense. In this connection,\nas in many another, there is a germ of truth in what the voice has to say.\nVisionary experiences inspired by telepathy are often claimed without\nfoundation by persons suffering from mental disease. All psychiatrists\nseem agreed on that point, irrespective of whether they believe in the\noccurrence of genuine telepathy. There are actually thousands of patients\nin (and out of) asylums, the main feature of whose illness is an obsession\nby imaginary psychic entities.\nWe have to try and decide how far, if at all, the spontaneous cases of\npsychic experiences studied by the S.P.R. may be delusions. Delusions\nare common in most mental illness, but paranoria (delusional insanity\nproper) is responsible for most of the well-developed, systematised, psychic\nobsessions. It is by no means unknown for S.P.R. officials to have to deal\nwith wild-eyed callers, who claim to be in constant telepathic rapport with\nsomething or somebody. Unsatisfactory persons, who haven't been able\nto hold their own in life, they have found refuge in delusions. Existence\nis only possible for them if they can convince themselves that they are\nabove the common level, possessed of unique powers. The delusion may\nbe based upon faulty reasoning, false premises or even hallucinatory\n\fThe Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 293\nexperiences ; but whatever the mechanism no amount of reasoning or\ndemonstration will shake their faith. These are the paranoics. Although\ncommon, they are fairly easily recognised, and their friends or relatives\nare usually only too well aware of their peculiarities. It is, therefore,\ndoubtful if any of the published corroborated cases are paranoic experi-\nences, althougla there is no doubt they occur frequently in the large number\nof uncorroborated unpublished cases.\nOther forms of insanity give rise to psychic delusions, particularly\nschizophrenia of the paramoid variety. In this disease, there is a woolli-\nness of thought, and the patient loves to direct his attention to psychologi-\ncal and psychic subjects, in which he can express vague speculations in\nhigh-sounding jargon. Auditory hallucinations are common and may be\nattributed to psychic forces. Once again, if the case be properly investi-\ngated it should never reach the S.P.R. publications. However, the present\nwriter must confess that he is aware of one case, probably explicable by\ndelusion, in which the contributor died as a certified patient in an\ninstitution shortly after an account of his \" experiences \" appeared in the\nS.P.R. Journal.^\nThese flagrant varieties of delusion are of less significance for our\npresent discussion than the subtle effects which take place in approximately\nnormal minds. False beliefs, which rational argument cannot affect, are\nnot the monopoly of the certifiably insane. This seeking refuge in\ndelusion is a common enough phenomenon in the so-called normal\nperson. The religious convictions of primitive tribes or unorthodox sects\nclearly enter the category of delusions. For many, the brutal truths of\nlife could not be faced without such an opiate, and when one is already\nprovided by the customs and traditions of the environment, the average\nmind cannot resist it.\nThe exact nature of the opiate does not seem to matter, so long as it\nincreases one's importance in the scheme of things. Some people find a\nbelief in psychic phenomena an excellent opiate. It does away with\nmaterialism and removes the unpleasant consequences associated with\nthat theory.\nIn other words, whenjudging the reliability of an account of a psychic ex-\nperience one must try to find out whether the story is just a wish-fulfilment.\nIf the narrator has a deep-seated yearning for the supernatural, that may be\nsufficient to cause the strange exaggeration and lapses of memorj^ which\nhave already been discussed {e.g. the case of \" Sir Edmund Hornby \").\nThe person who is sensitive to telepathic impressions is often just the\nsort to have these queer psychological mechanisms in a well-marked form.\nAs one lady remarked to the writer : \"I have known people who have\nthese experiences regularly, some of which I feel sure are genuine, but I\nhave noticed that their descriptions are very unreliable, and they hardly\nknow themselves when they are speaking the truth.\" It has always been\nmaintained that the psychically sensitive have a tendency to mental dis-\nsociation. Dr Ehrenwald has just written a book which takes things\nfurther, and claims that the psychic gift is associated with definite schizoid\ntendencies. These considerations make it imperative to have all cases\nwell corroborated.\nThe evidence for this statement is on record in the Society's private files.\n\f294 D.J. West [Part\nVIII. Conformity to Type\nCommon features appear in accounts of apparitions that are widely\nseparated in time and place. It is often argued that this conformity to\ntype is good evidence of genuineness.\nThe assumption is that common characteristics are a guarantee of\nauthenticity, but although this sounds reasonable, it is not strictly true.\nGhost stories of fiction are by and large true to type, but they are not\nauthentic on that account. The fashion is set by popular ideas on the\nsubject, to which the stories naturally conform. Similarly, it may be that\nreal life apparitional cases are equally coloured by current opinions of\nwhat a ghost should be like. It is highly significant that since the tele-\npathic theory has been in vogue, sensational and purposeful ghosts are\nreported less frequently (27) and that dreams and mental impressions have\nlargely taken the place of life-like apparitions. These changes are in\nkeeping with the new idea of subjective telepathic impressions as opposed\nto the old idea of spirit visitations.\nIt has been remarked how the best evidenced cases differ from fictitious\nstories in that the apparition is usually more ethereal, and never leaves\nbehind footmarks, or other physical traces. This is, of course, good evi-\ndence for subjectivity ; it suggests that apparitions are hallucinations\ngenerated in the mind of the percipient, but it has no bearing on the\nquestion of supernormality. However, the fact that ghosts are hallucina-\ntory explains how they can reflect the notions of the percipients, and change\ntheir character with the progress of ideas.\nApart from the overall resemblance, due to subjectivity and other\ncommon factors, ghost stories are readily classified into sub-groups,\nwithin which the similarities are closer and more detailed. The crisis\napparition and the haunt are examples of well-recognised types into\nwhich cases fall with almost monotonous regularity. This conformity to\ntype is often instanced as particularly good evidence for the supernormal.\nOf course it is nothing of the sort.\nAccounts of witchcraft and black magic are true to type, but we are not\nforced to accept them on that score. The ill-reputed poltergeist is about\nthe most true to type among ghosts, but he is the type most mistrusted by\npsychical researchers. Noisy ghosts, addicted to stone-throwing and like\npursuits, have been reported from all quarters of the globe, and the\nsimilarity between some of the classical cases is uncanny. For example, the\n1935 talking mongoose (28) has its counterparts in the little animals seen in\nthe Epworth Haunting (29) of 1791 and the Willington Mill manifestations\n(30) of 1835-1847. The mongoose christened itself Jeff, whilst both\nthe Willington Mill and the Epworth ghosts were familiarly referred\nto as Old Jeffrey. The mongoose, the Willington Ghost and the Ring-\ncroft Ghost (31) of 1695 were all described as making chuck-chucking\nnoises, whilst Old Jeffrey of Epworth was reported to have gobbled like a\nturkey-cock.\nThis strange tradition of the poltergeist, handed down through the ages,\nbaffles many observers, but it is really no more wonderful than the persis-\ntence of folk-lore. Certainly it is no evidence for telepathy.\nIf apparitions are not psychic they are presumably morbid, that is\ndependent, like other hallucinations, on some temporary derangement of\n\flys] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 295\nmind or body. However, the average apparition is certainly different in\ncharacter from the hallucination fever or insanity.\nDr Head, the well-known physiologist, investigated (32) some hallucina-\ntions occurring in sane, non-delirious hospital patients who were suffering\nfrom visceral disease. He found that the hallucinations were usually of\nunrealistic human figures. The face was generally indefinite, the limbs\nabsent, and the form draped rather than clothed. As a rule there were no\naccompanying sounds and the figures were never articulate.\nIn a paper in Proceedings (33) Mr Piddington contrasts these character-\nistics with a typical psychic apparition, which is vivid, lifelike, normally\nclothed, and with clearly recognisable features. Its movements are ac-\ncompanied by appropriate rustlings, it often says a few words, and it very\nrarely appears more than once.\nThis contrast is of interest, although it cannot be said to provide evidence\nof a different origin and still less of a psychic origin. The cases reported\nto the S.P.R. are not a random sample of all hallucinations. A lifelike\napparition would be much more likely to be reported to a psychic society\nthan a hallucination of smell, for example. It would be grossly unfair,\ntherefore, to claim this characteristic as a special property of psychic cases.\nThen again, Dr Head's investigation was confined to certain types of\npatient. If he had concentrated on a group of people in whom belief in\nghosts and telepathy was strong, he might have collected more cases of\nthe S.P.R. variety.\nIX. Collective Percipiency\nOne cannot discuss spontaneous cases fairly without some mention of\ncollectively perceived apparitions. Usually there is no recognisable\ncorrespondence with outside events. The apparition does not coincide\nwith death, it is just an unexplained figure seen by two or more people\nwhen they are together in the same room.\nIf, independently, two people have at the same moment similar hallucina-\ntory experiences it is a not unreasonable hypothesis that their minds are\nin telepathic rapport. But the contention rests upon the word \" indepen-\ndent \".\nConsider the theory that the Indian rope trick is due to mass suggestion.\nIncidents have repeatedly been described (34) in which an onlooker a little\nway off, out of sight of the magician's suggestions, sees only a crowd of\npeople staring at the sky, whereas people in the immediate vicinity can all\nsee a boy climbing a rope and disappearing. A photograph taken at the\nsame moment proves that the explanation is collective hallucination.\nThese stories have never been sufficiently authenticated, but they illustrate\nthe principle of a mechanism whereby more than one person may share\nthe same hallucination without the intervention of telepathy.\nThe rope trick story is credible in view of the acknowledged occurrence\nof collective religious hallucinations, such as the case in which several\npeople could all see a cross in the sky. Similar in principle, and well\nauthenticated, are the collective hallucinations which sometimes occur at\nseances. In a recent book (35) Dr Dingwall mentions one such case which\nhe personally investigated.\n\f296 D.y. West [Part\nA medium and circle in Massachusetts believed that they were seeing\nmaterialised forms, spirit dogs would nestle in their laps, and heavenly-\nmusic would fill the seance room. Dr Dingwall went there and found\nthat hardly anything actually happened, the marvels described were\nimaginary phenomena built up round the medium by a process of suggestion\nand hallucination on the grand scale.\nAnother case was described at length by Professor Harlow Gale (36). Dr\nE. S. led a small circle of enthusiasts who shared with him regularly\nhallucinatory visions of Christ and other figures. The people seemed\nperfectly genuine, really believing that they saw these things, although to\nan outsider there was nothing there.\nIn these cases of collective hallucination in the seance room diff'erent\npeople see the same things, not because of telepathy, but because they are\nmotivated by the same desire and expectancy. Doubtless in fraudulent\ncases the dimly-perceived figure of a masquerading medium forms an\nideal starting point for a collective hallucination.\nThe genesis of spontaneous collective hallucinations which occur in the\nabsence of obvious suggestive influences is something of a mystery. We\ndo not know why people are susceptible to them only on rare occasions.\nWhen such hallucinations do occur it is reasonable to suppose that they\nhave some sensory starting point or point de repere. For example, the\nslight opening of a door might be the precipitating factor in a hallucinatory\nfantasy of someone coming into the room. If there were two people\npresent who were at that moment in a state susceptible to hallucinations\nthey might both \" see \" a figure entering.\nThis would not account for cases in which figures seen by different\npeople are afterwards found to tally in detailed appearance. Although\nthis claim is often made, it is very rarely substantiated with accounts\nwritten independently by the percipients without previous consultation.\nGranting that such cases occur, there are several possible explanations\nthat do not involve telepathy.\nWe know from the phenomena of trance and dissociation in general that\nonce a hallucinatory fantasy is begun it will tend to continue by making\nuse of whatever suggestions or information is given to the percipient.\nThat is why a perfectly honest medium can be led into any sort of absurdity\nif the sitter drops the appropriate hints. For this reason also the content\nof a hallucination may be somewhat infectious. The fixed gaze, the facial\nexpression and the exclamations of the first percipient may provide hints\nwhich influence the content of the second percipient's hallucination.\nI have been asked by one of my critics to try to apply some of these\nnormal hypotheses to what is regarded as a good case of collective\nhallucination which occurred at Boscastle in 1933 (37). A man and wife\nwere travelling by bus in Cornwall and looking out for a suitable guest\nhouse at which to stay. Presently the gentleman noticed a house with a\ngarden containing some cane chairs and tables shielded by black and\norange umbrellas. He pointed this out to his wife, who saw it also. When\nthey got off the bus, she walked back to look for the house, but it was\ngone. They both made a thorough but unavailing search, and eventually\nconcluded that they must have been the subjects of a collective\nhallucination.\n\f175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 297\nEvidentially the case is poor. It is just conceivable that tlie house seen\nfrom the bus might have been a real one which they could not find again\neither because it was too well screened by trees or hedges or because they\nhad mistaken the locality. The percipients did not write down indepen-\ndent records of what they saw. In the Journal nine years after the event\nthey say they both saw the same house (although a detailed description is\nnot given by both parties) and that they both noticed the garden umbrellas.\nThey must have discussed the mystery many times in the interim and it\nmay be that the apparent similarity of their experiences is the spurious\nresult of the gradual fusion of their two visions. We have already noted\ntricks of memory far more extreme than this in connection with supposedly\npsychic occurrences.\nSupposing for the sake of discussion that the account accurately repre-\nsents what actually happened, is there no other explanation than telepathy?\nThe Editor of Journal, in his comments on the case, pointed out that the\nhallucination appeared to depend for its motive upon wish-fulfilment.\nThe wish of the percipients for a suitable guest house may have set their\nimaginations working in unison upon the construction and exteriorisation\nof a detailed picture of such a house.\nGranting this, we still need to advance some theory to account for the\nstriking similarity of the two exteriorisations in the detail of the garden um-\nbrellas. Dr Morton Prince in his experimental studies of hallucinations (38)\nhas shown that they are sometimes pictorial representations of subconscious\nthoughts about incidents forgotten by the conscious personality. Suppose\nthat the percipients in this case, man and wife, had in the past pleasant\nassociations with a particular guest house with umbrellas in the garden,\nthat would be sufficient to account for this detail appearing in both their\nvisions.\nThus, given the unknown conditions necessary for a hallucination to\noccur at all, the common wish to find a guest house would explain why\nthey both \" saw \" a house. The fact that they were both looking in the\nsame direction at the same scene with the same points de repere would\naccount for the general similarity of their imaginary houses. Their\ncommon background of experience and associations would explain the\nappearance of similar details in their visions.\nAfter having written as above, I was interested to discover that as long\nago as 1894 Edmund Parish had advanced precisely the same theory to\naccount for cases of this kind (39).\nOf course this is all speculative. At this distance in time one cannot\nprove that this is the correct explanation of the case in question. However,\nso long as the sceptic can show that any sort of normal explanation is\nfeasible, the case cannot be held to prove telepathy. Where there are two\nalternatives, normal and supernormal, it is logical to choose the former\nuntil it can be positively disproved. Here we are not actually forced to\nchoose either alternative. The evidence as yet is not enough to establish\nthat people do really experience independently identical hallucinations.\nIf such cases occur at all, they are sufficiently rare to warrant postulating\nunusual applications of known tendencies in preference to an utterly new\n\" psychic \" principle.\nA collective hallucination would be much better evidence for the super-\n\f298 D.J. West [Part\nnormal if it were verdical, e.g. an apparition coinciding with death. If\ncollective hallucinations have a telepathic basis one would expect some such\ncases among them, but there are very few recorded instances. A paper\nin Proceedings by H. and E. B. Hart (40) contains the results of an ex-\nhaustive search through the literature for cases of collective percipiency.\nThey did not succeed in finding a single first-class crisis case. They could\nonly discover one second-class and a few that were described as of third-\nclass evidential standard.\nVarious third-class cases were described by the Harts in their paper,\nbut as they were mainly uncorroborated reminiscences of events in the\ndistant past it is not worth discussing them here. I have been able to\nfind only one veridical collective case of any value, (41) This was not\nincluded in the Harts' paper because it concerns a hallucinatory voice and\nnot a visual impression.\nTwo young ladies, Margaret and Constance, out of doors together, both\nheard a voice calling their names. At the same time (12 noon) Constance's\nbrother, who was lying very ill at home, sat up and called out \" Margaret,\nConstance \". The case is well substantiated, but the accounts were iiot\nwritten up until over three years later. There are slight discrepancies\nbetween the different versions. Margaret's brother, a friend of Mr Pod-\nmore, could remember nothing of the incident. The girls did not recognise\nthe voice or connect it with the sick relative, in fact they seemed to\nconsider it likely that it was a friend playing a prank. The case is certainly\nsuggestive, but standing alone it cannot be regarded as good evidence.\nX. Experimentally Induced Hallucinations .\nThe most direct evidence for the telepathic explanation of apparitions\ncomes from the semi-experimental case, in which an agent, by concen-\ntrating his thoughts, makes his apparition appear to a chosen percipient.\nThis would be as neat a proof as any, but again the evidence for such\ncases is slender.\nS.P.R. literature contains only about half a dozen cases, not one of\nwhich is less than fifty years old. Numerous attempts have been made to\ninduce apparitions by mental concentration, especially since the etheric\ndouble became popular, but failure has been the rule.^ It is certainly not\na repeatable experiment.\nEven the few recorded cases are not at all convincing. Typical is the ex-\nample in the Census Report (42) in which Mr Kirk makes himself appear to\nMiss G. The narrative reveals that Miss G. knew that Mr Kirk had for\nsome time been trying to make her see his double. On several occasions\nhe had got so far as to induce in her a state of restlessness, so that when\nthe fully-fledged apparition arrived it was not exactly a bolt from the blue.\nThis example is an illustration of how inner details of a case can reveal\nunsuspected possibilities for normal explanation. It suggests that many\nmore cases would be explicable if only the necessary details had been\nincluded in the accounts.\niQne such unsuccessful experiment was conducted by Mr Denys Parsons in\n1046 A group of S.P.R. members all concentrated their thoughts upon the\nPresident of the Society, trying to make him see a bulldog, but without afTecting\nhim in any way.\n\f175] J^he Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 299\nCONCLUSION\nIt has been the aim of this paper to give some account of the technical\ndifficuhies involved in the investigation of spontaneous psychic cases, to\nshow how much has to be done before the paranormal explanation can be\nsaid to be scientifically proved. Opinions will diff^er as to how near the\nevidence already collected is to positive proof, but it would be difficult to\ndeny the need for more evidence while the majority of scientists remain\nunconvinced.\nSome of the normal explanations put forward in this paper have been\ncomplicated or implausible. On the other hand the cases they are intended\nto explain are themselves very exceptional. For every comparitively good\ncase which comes to be published by the Society, there are a hundred cases\nof vague coincidences or distant recollections which can be disposed of\nby the plainest common-sense. The few exceptional examples do strongly\nsuggest a psychic explanation. The problem is whether they are due to\nan unusual extension of the normal factors so well-known in the poorer\ntypes of case, or whether they are really supernormal. The pioneers who\ncollected the cases and discovered the problem have handed it on to us,\nwhose duty it is to find a solution that will stand for all time.\nVarious suggestions have been made in the course of this paper as to\nwhat would constitute evidence more conclusive than that already\nobtained. More good modern cases are needed ; cases in which the facts\ngiven could not have been guessed or inferred by any stretch of the\nimagination of the percipient ; cases in which written note was made and\nwitnessed at the time the impression was received ; cases in which the\ncircumstances preclude fraud ; cases which are not just one lucky hit\namong many that never came true.\nEverything depends upon the people who have psychic impressions\nrecording them at once and sending them in to the Society without\nwaiting for confirmation. In other words, if further progress is to be\nmade, it is for those who have these psychic gifts and experiences to take\naction, as well as the investigators. This fundamental truth should be\ngiven the widest possible advertisement.\nREFERENCES\n(1) Saltmarsh, H.

Salter\nNo worse fate could be imagined for a Society, born, as our own was, in a\nblaze of unorthodoxy, than that it should decline into a dull traditionalism\nand assumption of inerrancy. Those who are engaged in extending any\ndepartment of knowledge should from time to time examine their founda-\ntions, and the return to normal activities after the dislocation of the war is\nperhaps a convenient occasion for us to examine ours.\nDr West in the foregoing paper has submitted to examination the\nspontaneous mental phenomena which were the material for the first\nlarge-scale enquiry undertaken by the S.P.R., and which have during\nmost of its career engaged a large part of its activities. He brings to the\nwork the indispensable qualities of a fresh mind and immense diligence.\nSpontaneous cases are scattered all over our Proceedings and Journal, but\nthe larger part of them are to be found collected in the book. Phantasms\nof the Living (1886) and in two volumes of Proceedings, Vol. X (1894)\nwhich contains the report on the Census of Hallucinations, and Vol.\nXXXIII (1923) in which Mrs Sidgwick analysed a large number of cases\nprinted in the Journal but not previously published. As one who was\nalready an Hon. Officer of the Society when Vol. XXXIII appeared, and\none of the regrettably few present members of the Society who were\nbrought into close touch with both Mrs Sidgwick and Miss Johnson, the\nprincipal authors of the report on the Census, I can perhaps help some\nreaders of Proceedings to place themselves at the historical angle from\nwhich they can best judge how much value the main S.P.R. literature on\nspontaneous cases still retains for the student.\nThe authors of Phantasms were Edmund Gurney, Frederic Myers and\nFrank Podmore. Gurney died in 1888, before the Census Committee\nbegan its work. The members of the Census Committee were Henry\nSidgwick, Mrs Sidgwick, Frederic Myers> his brother Arthur Myers (who\ndied before the report was completed), Alice Johnson and Frank Podmore.\nIt would be superfluous to dwell on the intellectual abilities of each and\nall of the men and women named above, but the quite exceptional\nimpression made on their contemporaries by the mind and character of\nHenry Sidgwick and Mrs Sidgwick should not be forgotten.\nMost of the seven had considerable previous experience of this class of\ninvestigation. Sidgwick, Frederic Myers and Gurney had been associated\nin it since 1874, and to some extent before that. From her marriage in\n1876 onwards Mrs Sidgwick was in the closest touch with their work.\nPodmore had been a member of the Oxford Phasmatological Society\nfounded in 1879. That they were alive to the principal weaknesses\ninherent in reports of unusual occurrences is apparent from the whole\ntenor of Phantasms, and especially from Chapter IV, \" General Criticism\nof the Evidence for Spontaneous Telepathy \" (Vol. I, pp. 1 14-172).\nBut bias, where present, may defeat ability and experience, and it is\n301\n\f302 W. H. Salter [Part 1!\nproper to consider how far the judgment of any of them was a biassed one.\nPodmore was in his early days a Spiritualist, and Myers all though his life i\nhoped to find evidence proving survival. If bias is to be imputed to\neither, it should be recognised that there was a conflict of possible biasses,\none operating in favour of accepting as genuine narratives which appeared\ninconsistent with general materialist principles, and another against\naccepting narratives which strengthened the position for telepathy as a\npossible alternative explanation for a great deal of the evidence that might\notherwise count as survivalistic. I do not detect much sign of either bias\nin Phantasms or the Census report. The other members of the group \\\ndid not, I think, start their enquiries with any bias in favour of the super-\nnormal. Mrs Sidgwick and Alice Johnson indeed enjoyed an almost epic\nfame for persistent incredulity, as Podmore was already, in the middle\nnineties, beginning to do. In his Telepathic Hallucinations : The New\nView of Ghosts, published in 1909, Podmore re-affirms the position he had\ntaken up many years before in Phantasms and the Census report.\nI see no reason to suppose that any of the authors of Phantasms or of\nthe Census Committee had any personal kink in judging evidence, but if\n:\nhe or she had, it must have been straightened out by the collective\njudgment of the group. As for the cases printed in the Journal between\nthe Census report and 1923, when Vol. XXXIII of Proceedings was pub- j\nlished, these were submitted to fresh examination by Mrs Sidgwick, and\nvery critical examination as her comments show. Since that time most\ncases printed in the Journal have been critically discussed by two or three I\npersons of experience before printing. The fact that so little reliance has |\nbeen placed on the judgment of a single person puts the cases printed in ;\nour Proceedings and Journal on a quite different footing from any that can I\nbe claimed for even the best collections of cases printed elsewhere.\nThe early investigators took immense pains to establish personal\ncontact with percipients and witnesses. As Myers, in his Obituary of\nGurney (Proc, V, p. 372), remarks :\n\" Almost every living witness of importance in Phantasms of the Living\n(and many whose names do not occur in that book) had, before the book I\nwas published, been personally visited by one of ourselves.\"\nj\nThe whole of this page and of pages 160 and 161 of Phantasms, Vol. I, 1\n.\nshould be studied. The following extract from Sidgwick's Journal for if\n1885 is also instructive :\n\"Sept. 19. Psychical Research is not disagreeable when the subjects of i\nenquiry live in well-situated country houses and ask one to lunch : one i\nfeels, in fact, that one is making the best of both worlds. But when (as 1\non Wednesday) one travels from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. in abnormal heat on\nthe day of the fair of the neighbourhood . . . the case is altered, and one I\nhas to remind oneself of the sacrifices made by other scientific investigators j\nin the cause of truth. However, the results are on the whole satisfactory : 1\nthe stories that become worse after oral examination are mostly those that |\nwe had already judged to be objectionable, and some are decidedly |\nimproved by the examination.\" i\n(Henry Sidgwick : A Memoir, p. 388.) t\nIt is regretfully to be admitted that of recent years less has been done\n\f175] A Commentary on \" The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases \"\n303\nin the way of \" oral examination \", owing to difficulties of travel during\nand after the war, the shortage of investigators able to give the time, and\npossibly the lack of invitations to lunch in well-situated country houses.\nIn many spheres of human activity it is assumed that facts put forward\nas genuine after critical examination by competent, diligent and un-\nprejudiced persons may safely be accepted by other people as the basis of\nserious decisions ;\nlaw, business, private and public affairs are run on that\nprinciple. If it were not found to work, the historian's task would be\nhopeless. Does every scientist repeat over again for himself all the\nexperiments and observations on which his studies are based?\nWe should therefore, I think, accept the accounts of spontaneous occur-\nrences printed in Phantasms, the Census report and Vol. XXXIII of\nProceedings as in the main reliable statements of fact. Even the ablest\nmen and women are not infallible, and as a matter of prudence some\nallowance should be made for this when considering the theoretical\nimplications of individual cases, especially such as do not run true to\ntype. This matter of type is important. It was a striking feature of\nPhantasms that the cases which stood up well to examination possessed\ncertain characteristics which differentiated them from the popular tradition\ndisplayed in fictional ghost-stories, and exemplified in some narratives\npurporting to be authentic, but breaking down when examined. Gurney\nseems to me to have been fully justified in claiming this as strongly\nsupporting the credibility of the cases he quoted (see Phantasms I, pp.\n165, 166).\nBut in applying conformity to type in support of credibility, it must be\nremembered that there was a considerable lapse of time between Phantasms\n(1886) and Vol. XXXIII of Proceedings (1923). Phantasms was a pioneer\nwork : many of the cases the authors had before them were already old, and\nalthough their argument is based on recent, first-hand cases, and their\nconclusions show that they had been able to free their minds to a very\nremarkable extent from the influence of the traditional ghost-story,\nthey would have been more than human if they had achieved absolute\ndetachment.\nConditions were different when the Census Committee presented its\nreport (1894) and still more so when Mrs Sidgwick wrote her paper in\nProc, XXXIII. Cases from the mythical past could no longer be suspected\nof influencing the judgment of enquirers into contemporary narratives.\nIf, therefore, any type of case is prominent in Phantasms and has quite, or\nalmost, faded out in Proc, XXXIII, it ought to be considered suspect,\nunless, of course, supported by still more recent examples.\nMost of thi cases in Phantastns seem to me unassailable on this score,\nbut I have long felt some doubts as to veridical collective apparitions, one\nof the stock supports of the argument for physical objectivity. They are\ndiscussed at length in Phantasms with several examples, many rather old,\nbut are poorly represented in the Census report and still more poorly in\nProc, XXXIII. In the main, however, and apart from this exceptional\ninstance, the authors of Phantasms acquit themselves of any inclination\ntowards accepting narratives as genuine because they embody incidents\nof a kind imbedded in occult tradition.\nIn one other respect Phantasms shows a defect due to the rudimentary\nu\n\f304 W. H. Salter [Part\nstate of psychical research when it was written, namely in the treatment of ;\nthe evidence of adolescents. It is, I think, a fair inference from the out- 1 si\ncome of the experiments with the Creery sisters (see Proc, V, p. 269)^ j\nthat the authors had not yet realised the peculiar deceptiveness of what is ii\nknown as \" the teen-age \", a factor first brought prominently to the notice ]\nof psychical researchers by Podmore's article on Poltergeists, in Proc, XII. j\nIn the one case in the book which was later shown to be a hoax {Proc, XIV, i\np. 1 14), the principal witness was a youth of eighteen. It would not, how- i\never, be reasonable to take either the Creery incident or the case of the\nyouth of eighteen as any indication that the early investigators of spon- t\ntaneous cases were easy victims of hoaxers. t\nIn the course of sixty-five years not a few attempts have been made to j\npull the Society's leg, some of them very ingenious and elaborate attempts. (\nWe may be fairly certain that any successful attempts would be trumpeted\nj\nabroad and exploited for all they were worth by hostile critics. How t\nmany successes have they claimed? [\nThe foregoing criticism of Phantasms as regards (i) veridical collective f\napparitions, and (2) cases depending on the evidence of adolescents,\naffects, if it is well founded, only a very small proportion of the evidence [\nset out in that book, and barely touches the later collections of cases, t\nThe serious question seems to me not as to the facts, but as to the inferences\nj\nto be drawn from them, and the problem of how far chance will account (\nfor them. Phantasms and the report on the Census built up an elaborate j\nstatistical argument to show the inadequacy of chance. But there is only f\none type of spontaneous case which can be forced into a quantitative\n[\nframework, namely, the so-called \" death-coincidence \", and that only by (\nthe unsatisfactory procedure of disregarding all correspondences between j\nexperience and event other than the time-relation between them. This\n[\nweighted the scales in favour of chance. On the other hand, while the\n|\nCensus Committee aimed at getting 50,000 answers to their questionnaire\nthey only obtained 17,000, rather a small number perhaps to carry much (\nstatistical superstructure. Fortunately both Mrs Sidgwick and Alice (\nJohnson were well trained in scientific method, the former in physics, and y\nthe latter in biology, and they doubtless made as accurate an analysis of ,\nthe material as its nature admitted. t\nHistorical perspective is needed here. The enquiry was novel and the j\nexperimental data at the time of the Census were scanty. There has t\nrecently been a tendency to treat them as poor in quality as well as in j\nquantity, and to make perhaps exaggerated assumptions of incompetence\non the part of the experimenters. However that may be, scanty the data\ncertainly were, and it was natural that an attempt should have been made\nto eke them out by extracting the last statistical ounce from the refractory\nmaterial of the spontaneous cases.\nSpeaking for myself, I regard the close correspondence in a variety of\ndetail between experience and event as shown in a large number of cases\nreported' by a host of percipients and witnesses, and examined by several\nexperienced critics over many years as being absolutely conclusive against\n^ In these the authors withdrew some pubhshed evidence because in other\nexperiments with the same subjects held under different conditions cheating was\ndiscovered.\n\f175] A Cofnmentary on \" The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases \"\n305\nchance-coincidence. But I am painfully aware that this opinion is not\nshared by all my fellow-members, not to mention the benighted millions\nstill without the fold. For those who seek a different kind of proof of\ntelepathy, experimental data are, through the labours of Mr Tyrrell,\nMr Carington, Dr Soal and others, as plentiful now as they were scarce\nwhen Phantasms appeared, and that being so, the statistics regarding\ndeath-coincidences in the early literature seem to me no longer of prime\nimportance.\nBut the complexity and variety of the spontaneous cases, which make\nthem unsatisfactory for the purposes of quantitative analysis, are precisely\nthe factors which give them value as an approach to the understanding\nof the still more complex phenomena of trance-mediumship and automatic\nwriting, and, generally speaking, of the whole central problem of\npersonality. I cannot think that if Dr Rhine had been as familiar with\nthe spontaneous cases as he is with experimental E.S.P. he would ever\nhave put forward the paradox that \" precognitive clairvoyance can account\nfor all the '\nevidence '\non record for telepathy \" (see Proc, Part 172).\nIt is therefore much to be regretted that, while in all probability cases\nlike those recorded in our early literature occur no less frequently than\nthey did a generation ago, by far the commonest type of spontaneous case\n(so Dr West informs us) now being reported to the Society is the pre-\ncognitive dream. Of all types of spontaneous case there is none of which\nit is so hard to gauge the supernormal content (if any) as this. The\nfrequency of dreams increases the probability of chance-coincidence : the\nprevalence of symbolism in dreams makes their interpretation problemati-\ncal : prediction is worthless where there is doubt as to the thing predicted\nand as to the time of fulfilment. These three factors in conjunction make\nprecognitive dreams, except in a few instances, of little value to the\npsychical researcher.\nOther types of spontaneous cases are most valuable, if properly\nevidenced. Any evidential weaknesses that may have affected the value\nof some of the earlier cases can be avoided if a few well-known but not\nuniversally followed precautions are taken : a signed and dated statement\nmade as soon as practicable after the experience ;\nindependent corrobora-\ntion, if possible ; careful verification of the event ; and so on. Detailed\nadvice can be obtained from the officers of the Society, and it is hoped\nthat many members will have occasion to consult them, so that the S.P.R.\nmay once more enjoy abundance of this very fruitful form of research.\n\fFORECASTS AND PRECOGNITION\nBy C. Drayton Thomas\nDuring the war of 1939-45 studies with Mrs Osborne Leonard were\ninterrupted and I could only visit her at irregular intervals. But at most\nof these the future was mentioned with forecasts of coming military\nevents. With few exceptions these came to pass. Some of these events\ncould have been guessed by a mind which had the ability to ascertain the\nplans, and the reserves in men and material, of the various belligerents.\nBut no single incarnate mind had this ability, and no one person at any\ntime knew all these facts.\nThe possession by my communicator of this ability, and this information\nabout military affairs, would sufficiently explain the accuracy of the\nforecasts. There were, however, exceptions which do not easily admit of\nthis explanation. These would seem to have been instances of pure\nprecognition.\nThe words \" forecast \" and \" precognition \" are frequently used as\nalternatives for the same thing. As I shall need to distinguish between\nexplicable forecasts and those which are at present inexplicable, the latter\nwill, in this paper, be termed \" pure precognition \".\nBoth before, during, and after the war, my communicators gave forecasts\nof events which were to concern me personally. These rarely failed to\nmaterialise. Their accuracy impressed me, and it seemed desirable to\ninquire if they could be explained. I found that they fell into groups\nwhich will be here described and illustrated.\nClass A\nForecasts based on Plans perceived in Human Minds,\nOR on Circumstances unknown to the Recipients\nHospitality\nMy wife's parents, speaking through Feda, Mrs Leonard's control,\nonce told me that they were looking forward to seeing us shortly giving\nhospitality to visitors : there would be two of them and possibly a third.\nNeither my wife nor I could divine the meaning of this as we certainly\nhad no visitors in prospect. But two days later came a letter from my\nwife's brother saying that he was coming to England with his son and\ndaughter, and that he wished to stay with us until his Bromley house\ncould be made ready ; that his son would probably go to a relative,\nalthough that was not decided ;\nanyhow two of them would come to us.\nThus the plan was clear-cut in his mind and the letter was on its way\nwhen the forecast was given.\nIf, subsequently to the giving of a forecast, human plans are changed,\nthis may alter the date given for the foreseen event.\nThe Whitehead Bag\nIn my book, Life Beyond Death zvith Evidoice, p. 100, there is a full\n306\n\f[Part 175] Forecasts and Precognition 307\naccount of this striking forecast, apparently based on the communicator's\nreading in the mind of my mother's friend, Mrs Whitehead, the intention\nto give a present. Circumstances led to a postponement of the gift, but\nthe communicator persisted in the forecast, which proved to have been\ncorrect.\nHere is the story in brief.\nAt a sitting on December 22nd, 1922, my sister Etta (communicator)\nasked me if our mother had received the gift of a bag. Feda continued\nwith a description, \"A soft silk bag, not all one colour, studded or dotted\nin design, or partly so.\" On January 5th I remarked that no such bag\nhad appeared.\nFeda :\n\" Etta's idea was that it would be a Christmas gift to her\nmother. It may have been delayed. For she still gets that idea and feels\nthat her mother will have that bag.\" That confidence was justified, for\nthe bag arrived and met the above description exactly. It was given on\nmy mother's birthday, January 27th, by Mrs Whitehead, who was then\non a visit to her. Mrs Whitehead informed me that she had made this\nbag in the autumn, intending to present it at Christmas, but later decided\nto keep it back for the birthday gift. When later I asked Etta how she\nhad ascertained her facts she replied that it was done in the usual way by\nperceiving the thought in a person's aura.\nMight this forecast be attributed to telepathic action? If so, by whom.'\nNeither Mrs Leonard nor I had any conscious knowledge of the matter,\nand the former had not met Mrs Whitehead.\nHad any such forecast been received in dream or by impression or in\nautomatic script it would have been supernormal. As it was given by a\ncommunicator who was apparently employing a faculty which to her is\nnormal, we may term it an instance of \" paranormal telepathy \".\nIn this class \"A\" may be placed warnings of physical danger, of coming\nmisfortune, sickness or death, such as are received by impression, clair-\nvoyance, clairaudience, or in dreams.\nOne has an impression that a letter is about to arrive from so-and-so,\nor that one will almost immediately meet such-and-such a person. These\nimpressions are so frequently justified by the event that they seem more\nthan chance coincidences.\nThere are also those compelling urges which lead the recipient to visit\nsome person, or render some service, not previously thought of. Clergy\nhave recounted such impressions which led them to visit some parishioner\nwhom they discovered to be in pressing need of their ministrations. A\nfriend tells me that his automatic writing one day named a family but\nslightly known to him and stated that the people were in need. Tactful\ninquiry elicited that the mother had remarked to her children that she\ncould only see her way to provide for the next two days and that after\nthat they might suffer want.\nSuch forecasts or impressions seem to be based on facts already\nexisting, or conditions which will eventuate in the facts. They may come\nfrom the percipient's Subliminal Self, or from discarnate friends and\nguardians.\nWe now pass to an extension of this type of forecast.\n\f3o8 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nClass B\nForecasts based on Plans perceived in Human Minds, to which\nCommunicators add Plans of their Own and carry out the\ncombined Plan by influencing Human Action\nThe Luton Visit\nDuring my first sitting with Mrs Leonard, February 3rd, 1917, a fore-\ncast was given which Feda seemed only partly to understand and which\nsuggested nothing whatever to my mind. I quote from condensed notes\ntaken at the time :\nThere will be a little journey to take some temporary work and in\nthe end this will lead to something important. The work looks un-\nimportant but will prove to be important. It is, say, about thirty miles\nfrom London. Your guides are preparing for it and will see it through\nwith you. (Here came a pause of about one minute during which Feda\nseemed to hold a whispered conversation with some person invisible to\nme.) It seems to Feda that the importance is on account of someone\nyou will meet there.\nI was perplexed and could understand nothing of this. My engagements\nincluded several Sundays away from home, among them a Sunday School\nAnniversary at Luton, with a Lecture on the Monday evening. As the\ndate for this, May 7th, drew near I was informed that my home would\nbe with a Mr and Mrs Squire. As we walked home from the morning\nservice Mrs Squire said that a remark of mine prompted her to ask if\nI had read Sir Oliver Lodge's book Raymond, and if I knew anything\nabout the possibility of communication with those whom one had lost.\nI replied suitably and she then told me of their having recently lost a son\nin the war. We had several talks on the subject, and finally I invited her\nto share my forthcoming sitting with Mrs Leonard. It was only then that\nit occurred to me that as this was for her and her husband a very\nimportant matter, it might be the work hinted at in the forecast.\nRemembering that the foretold journey was to be one of \" about thirty\nmiles \" I inquired how far was Luton from London. The reply was,\n\" Thirty miles! \" As this agreed with the forecast I was all the more\ninterested in the next remarks of my hostess, which were to the eff^ect\nthat she was glad I had come to them for these three nights as it had\ngiven her a new outlook and hope, but that she had narrowly missed the\nchance. She went on to explain that, on being asked to entertain me,\nshe had refused, because since losing their son they had been too sad to\nenjoy social intercourse and preferred to be alone. However, the official\nwho arranged for the preacher's entertainment had asked her to reconsider,\nand presently approached her a second time on the matter. She had\nagain refused, but when he asked her a third time, and was very pressing\nabout it, she finally, but with reluctance consented.\nRealising by now that there might be more in this than appeared on\nthe surface, I wrote to the above church officer asking if he could confirm\nwhat had been told me. He replied that, knowing I should be comfortable\nwith this family, he had felt a particular wish to put me with them and,\nwithout knowing why, had felt unwilling to take a refusal.\n\flys] Forecasts and Precognition 309\nMrs Squire later accompanied me to a sitting with Mrs Leonard, at\nwhich I witnessed a happy reunion with her son. Subsequently she went\nalone and these sittings brought joy and thankfulness to her and the family.\nThis bears out the forecast given three months earlier : \"It will lead\nto something important . . . your guides are preparing for it and will see\nit through with you. . . . The importance is on account of someone you\nwill meet there.\"\nConsider how neatly these events dovetailed together.\nA. I am engaged for Luton on a given date.\nB. The entertainment official decides to ask Mr and Mrs Squire to\ntake me for the occasion.\nC. He feels an unaccountable reluctance to accept their refusal and\nfinally overpersuades them.\nD. A remark of mine leads Mrs Squire to ask about possibilities of\ncommunication.\nE. She finds the comfort and assurance needed.\nI was struck by the persistence of the official in persuading the Squires\nto entertain me, since there were many other homes to which I might\nequally well have gone. Also that Luton should be the exact distance\nfrom London named in the forecast. How unaccountable all this when\nviewed from the standpoint of common experience, and yet how simple\nto the enlightened mind! The need of the bereaved mother was perceived,\nher prayers \" heard \". My knowledge could help her. I was to be in\nher town. The official could be impressed to get me to her house, and\nshe could be prompted to question me.\nMr and Mrs Squire had been unknown to me until this visit, nor had\nI previously heard anything about them.\nHere, as in other cases of this class, we note evidence of a purpose\nwhich was not in the sitter's mind and cannot possibly be ascribed to\nhim. Whose purpose was it if not the communicator's?\nMyers {H. P., p. 265) says : \"I ascribe some precognitions to the\nreasoned foresight of disembodied spirits . . . their not infallible inferences\nfrom what they know.\"\nLiverpool Street Station\nAt a sitting in April, 1935, I had a long conversation with Elsie, a lady\nwith whom I had close friendship in the long ago and whom I had hoped\nto marry. She died. During this talk she made a forecast which puzzled\nme at the time and to which I had absolutely no clue. Its substance was\nas follows :\nQuite soon you have to go to a place very closely associated with me.\nYou may not know yet that you will have to go, but when you do you\nwill say, \" Oh, full of memories of her! \" What I say now belongs to a\nbig subject, the plan of life. Part of our lives is planned, but we are\nfree co-operators. If we do not interfere, the plan outworks for us.\nThere is no forcing, but instinct guides us to co-operate with it. One\nis free to fall in or to step aside. It applies to you ;\nyour steps are\nbeing guided easily and firmly. Well, I have a feeling that soon you\nwill find yourself at a place associated in your mind with me. You\n\fC. Drayton Thomas [Part\nhave been there several times and I have been there several times with\nyou. You think of me there where you walk down a little hill, not a\nsteep place, and if you notice it you'll remember other times.\nFeda then added : When you get to a corner is there the word\n\"Avenue \" written up, or is she only thinking \"Avenue \"?\nAs above remarked, I failed to find any satisfactory interpretation of\nthis and, as usual with forecasts, put the matter aside until time and the\nevent should explain it.\nSix days later I went to Liverpool Street Station to meet my friend\nMajor Mowbray, whom I was to accompany for a meeting in Cambridge.\nAs there are two routes to Cambridge, via Kings Cross or Liverpool\nStreet, I had written to Mowbray asking him to decide which route and\ntrain. So that it was he, and not I, who fixed the route. As I reached\nthe sloping road leading down into the station I realised that this fitted\nwith Elsie's forecast. It was impossible to enter that station without\nrecalling the many times we had been there together : indeed it was one\nmost memorable conversation we had there which finally led to our\nengagement. On our many journeys together for days in town, this was\nthe station to which we came. It is for me ever redolent of her memory.\nThinking over the forecast during the journey, it occurred to me to\nask Major Mowbray if he would give me a list of the associations which\nLiverpool Street Station brought to his mind. It seemed that he had\nused the station for many years during his residence in Cambridge and\nhe gave me a longish list of its associations for him, but did not mention\n\" the hill \". Nor was he aware of any \" avenue \" thereabouts. I asked a\nsecond person the same questions with the same negative result.\nWhat then had the reference to \"Avenue \" meant? Elsie, having used\nLiverpool Street Station all her life and done shopping in its neighbour-\nhood, might well know the names of the streets better than most people.\nI therefore inspected a map of the district : to my surprise it showed,\nclose by the station, two streets the names of which both ended with the\nrequired word. There was Finsbury Avenue, a small and unattractive\nlane, and Throgmorton Avenue which, I found when going there, displayed\nits full name conspicuously on both sides at its end nearest to the station.\nIt is only some 200 yards distant from Liverpool Street Station.\nThus within six days of receiving the forecast I found myself fulfilling\nit to the letter, and by no choice of my own, but by Major Mowbray's\nchoice to travel via Liverpool Street. Had he chosen the alternative\nroute the forecast would have failed. Why had Elsie risked it? My\ntheory is that, in such cases, the communicator relies on an ability to\ninfluence the person concerned and, from previous practice, is fairly sure\nof success.\nThe introduction of the word \"Avenue \" would seem to have been in\nthe nature of a clue, or an additional description, by which I might be\ncertain that I had discovered the place to which the forecast referred.\nThe Annunciation Picture\nDuring a temporary residence at Harrogate I came to town for a sitting\non November 5th, 1942. On this occasion Elsie spoke for almost the whole\n\f175] Forecasts and Precognition 3\"\ntime. She began with a reference to background and foreground which,\nas later appeared, was a designed preparation for the description of a\npicture. Here is the substance of what was said :\nFeda : Elsie is in the background of your mind while other things\nare in the foreground. The slightest thing may bring her to your\nrecollection and into the foreground again. She is never lost on the\ncanvas of your memory, nothing dwarfs or so obscures that she is lost\nin the picture. She is always there and is brought to the fore when\nnecessar}'. When one passes over, the background of that spiritual\ncanvas comes into the foreground. It would not be right for her to\ncome into the foreground all the time. She has helped you by being\nin the background.\nNow why this harping on the words background and foreground?\nEvidently it was a preliminary devised to assist reference to a certain\npicture of which she wished to speak.\nFeda :\n\" Lilies \"; she is giving me something about lilies, a picture\nwhich should remind you of her. They are not real flowers, not in a\npot, but in a picture. And not only lilies but words also, something\nabout it should remind you of her and her position w-ith regard to you,\na sort of reassurance of all she stands for and remains in your life, even\nif the words background and foreground are not literally given in this\npicture.\nFeda does not understand where this picture is, and it may be better\nnot to ask, as she might not be able to explain. She hopes you will\nfind it and get the message from this picture.\nShe says that occasionally she and Etta can impress you to act in\nsome way by influencing your mind. Before you come across anything\nwe tell you of, observe what happens to your consciousness a second or\ntwo before ; there is a slight blank or suspension of thought. If you\nwill notice that you may realise that something is happening. She will\ntry to show you this picture.\nThe above would seem to have been a carefully prepared speech\nplanned to introduce references to a particular picture which I was to\nlook for and notice. That we had no such picture in our Bromley house\nI was certain, and so resolved to inspect all pictures in our temporary\nhome at Harrogate on my return. I had arranged to spend the following\nday with my cousin at Harpenden and there, during the evening, we sat\nlistening to the radio. When it came to the American Broadcast I was\nsitting facing the fire and presently, wearied of listening, leaned back in\nmy chair with mind more or less vacant. Very suddenly came the thought\nthat I might use the opportunity for glancing around the room to see if\nany of the 'pictures showed lilies. After inspecting three of the walls I\nturned round to see what might be behind me. At once I noticed a\npicture representing an angel with the annunciation lily in her hand.\nRising to make a closer examination, I noticed that it met exactly the\ndescription given at the sitting. These were its chief features :\n\"Background; Foreground\". The background is strikingly separated -\n. from the foreground by a distance of several miles ; far away one sees\n\f312 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nwater with shipping and an island. There is almost nothing but fore-\nground and background. Elsie and I often visited picture galleries and\nshe was a keen observer of detail.\n\" Position with regard to me \". The angel speaking to Mary (one\nfrom the Beyond with a message to one on earth) is analagous to Elsie from\nher life in the Beyond speaking to me.\n\" Get the message from this picture \". It will be recollected that the\nangel said to Mary, \" Hail, thou that art highly favoured \" (Luke i, 28).\nI am indeed highly favoured in many ways, and that Elsie thinks so has\nbeen abundantly shown by her in many previous messages.\nThis discovery of the picture and its apposite character came as a real\nsurprise to me. That the urge to look for the picture came suddenly\nwhen my mind was somewhat blank favours the idea that Elsie was\nprompting me to look for it. Feda had said, \" She will try to show you\nthis picture.\"\nHow do I interpret this incident? Something as follows : Elsie would\nknow that I was to visit my cousin, either from her own observation of my\nthoughts or in conversation with my father and Etta. They would, if\nshe required it, show her the house and leave her to select some object\nthere which would be suitable for a test message. The presence of a plan\nis the outstanding fact, and the plan included a reliance on so influencing\nmy mind that I should notice the picture which she had selected for the\nforecast.\nIt was some six years since I had been in this room and I was unaware\nthat my cousin possessed any such picture. The parallel suggested\nbetween an angel speaking to Mary and Elsie's communications was an\nidea so entirely new that I am positive it had never entered my thought.\nI think that the events above recorded warrant the conclusion that\ninvisible helpers not only perceive intentions in human minds, but that\nthey sometimes exert a telepathic influence by which they contrive to\nguide human actions into harmony with their own purposes.\nClass C\nForecasts made by Communicators, for the carrying out of which\nThey request Human Co-operation\nDr A. T. Shearman\nMy sister Etta and I had been on intimate terms with Dr A. T. Shearman\nand his wife. He had been a widower for many years when, in June, 1936,\nEtta gave a long communication for him from his wife, emphasising that\nI was not to forward it until hearing from him, which she was confident I\nshould presently do. I had last seen Arthur Shearman in June, 193 1,\nand we rarely wrote except at Christmas. Etta realised that this message\n(which contained some 650 words and many evidential items about which\nI knew nothing) was part of a plan and intended to achieve some purpose\nabout which I was kept in the dark.\nIn September I had a letter from Arthur with a gift of his latest book.\nWith my reply was enclosed the above communication.\nArthur sent me a full annotation on the evidence which had evidently\ngreatly impressed him, for he said, among other appreciative remarks.\n\f1 75] Forecasts and Precognition 313\n\" I am bound to say that in my judgment proof is established. ... 1 did\nnot look forward to a revelation so really important from a scientific point\nof view and as welcome to myself as this is.\"\nIn giving me her message Etta had remarked,\n\" I think there is some reason for her wishing to help Arthur but\ndon't say anything about this part ;\njust keep to yourself what she says\nnow. She feels he needs help himself, but doesn't wish to say that to\nhim.\"\nOn my reporting at the next sitting that Arthur was impressed by the\nmessage, Etta remarked, \" It may help him. It is the right time for it.\nThere have been things happening with Arthur, developments that you\ndon't know anything about.\"\nIt was only three months later that the reason for this communication\nfrom Arthur's wife became apparent. He died the following January\nafter some months illness. From his doctor I then ascertained that it\nwas just about the time when his illness entered its final stage that the\ncommunication had reached him. It would seem, therefore, that my\ncommunicators realised from Arthur's health condition that the end was\nnot far distant and had therefore planned to cheer him by messages\nproving the identity of his wife and her intimate acquaintance with his\ndoings. Note Etta's confident prediction that Arthur would be writing\nto me.\n(A more complete account of this incident was published in the S.P.R.\nJournal for November, 1937.)\nHere again purpose is evident, but it was not any purpose of the sitter\nand cannot be ascribed to any incarnate human being.\nClass D\nForecasts made by Communicators based on\nPlans made by Themselves\nThe Foretold Letters\nOn several occasions it has been announced in my sittings that I shall\nshortly receive a letter ; details are then given by which this letter may\nbe recognised. Here are two illustrations :\nOn October 28th, 1938, my communicators inquired if I had recently\nreceived a letter from a middle-aged man about his son. As I had not,\nthey gave me some particulars about the case.\nWithin two weeks came a letter which met the forecast, and in a\ncorrespondence which followed, it appeared that the writer's deceased son\nhad prompted his father to write, hoping thereby to establish communica-\ntion with his father through Mrs Leonard. >\nA second case is on similar lines.\nMarch 17th, 1939 :\nFeda : Will you keep a lookout for a letter asking you about a lady,\nnot one we have had, a new one. I think that someone has written, or\nis writing, to ask if you can help about her. The one she's expecting\nto write is a man.\n\f314 C.Drayton Thomas [Part\nAfter certain identifying details had been given we continued :\nC. D. T. : Won't it be a pity, Feda, if after taking all this trouble\nI don't get any inquiry?\nFeda : I think you will and soon. . . . The lady seems satisfied and\nsays, \" \/'\/\/ see what I can do.'' (Italics are mine : note this intention of\nexerting influence.)\nTen days later I received a letter from a Mr C. G. Netherton of\nBournemouth. Correspondence followed and we found that out of thirty-\none items given for purposes of identification, twenty-three were definitely\naccurate. Mr Netherton told me that the idea of writing to me had been\nin his mind since March 2nd, but that he only decided to send the letter\na day or two before he actually did so. Mr Netherton informs me that\nhis wife had been a firm believer in the possibility of psychic communica-\ntion. It looks as if she had been impressing him to write, and that a belief\nin her ability to do so was the ground of her forecast that I should hear\nfrom him. Other letters of a like character have been similarly foretold.\nThe inference is obvious.\nThe foregoing classes B, C, D, can be best explained by the ability of\ncommunicators to ascertain the thoughts and intentions of men, sub-\nconscious as well as conscious, and by plans formed in communicators'\nown minds. With those data they proceed to draw inferences in accordance\nwith psychological laws as familiar to us as to them. It may well be that,\nin addition to this means of acquiring their data, they make use of causal\nlaws, whether physical or psychological or both, about which we on earth\nknow nothing. Consider how a meteorologist bases his forecasts of\ncoming weather on a knowledge of laws governing atmospheric move-\nments which are unfamiliar to ordinary people.\nClass E\nA Further Class of Forecasts may be in the Nature of Experiments\nwhich discarnate intelligences undertake for purposes of their own\nThe Garage Proprietor\nWe once owned a house in Ramsgate. My parents occupied it until\nmy father's death. Later it was sold and my mother rented a house on\nthe sea-front. I frequently visited her, and always put my car in a nearby\ngarage. The following was given eight years after my mother's death.\nTlie Forecast\nFeda : Your mother says she feels you may be hearing about\nRamsgate and the old days there. She feels it strongly ;\nit is strange\nhow she feels it. Not very interesting, but will take your mind back to\nher other house there, also some talk about property.\nHere are the stenographer's paragraphs relating to the above :\nFeda : Your mother says, I just wanted to say that I felt that you\nmight be hearing some news from people at Ramsgate.\nC. D. T. : Oh, really?\nFeda : Yes, and she is not sure if it's important news and she is not\n\f175] Forecasts and Precognition 315\neven sure if it's coming from Ramsgate, but it will be about Ramsgate\nand about the old days at Ramsgate. She felt it very strongly, she says.\nIt's strange how she feels it. (Here I suggested that possibly the idea\noriginated in my having recently read some letters she wrote me from\nRamsgate long ago.)\nFeda : She thinks not, because she knew about those old letters. . . .\nShe feels something more than that, something from other people,\nsomething from outside.\nC. D. T. : I will look out for it with interest.\nFeda : Yes, it will be interesting because she has mentioned it ; but\nshe doesn't think very interesting otherwise. She thinks that it may\nspecially be about property there. You remember the other house\nshe had?\nC. D. T. : Very well.\nFeda : She feels that there may be some allusion to it, or something\nthat will take your mind back to that other house. That's what she feels.\nNote in the above how appropriate to the later event are the words :\n\" hearing some news about Ramsgate\n\"\n\" not important\n\"\n\" not sure if it's coming from Ramsgate\n\"\n\" thinks it may specially be about property there\n\"\n\" feels that there may be some allusion to it (her old house Birkdale)\nor something that will take your mind back to that other house.\"\nThe Fulfilment\nExactly three weeks after the above was spoken at my sitting, a gentleman\naccosted me in Bromley High Street. He introduced himself as the\nproprietor of the garage I had so regularly used at Ramsgate, and we\nexchanged reminiscences of my cars and of my driving with my mother.\nHe inquired about her and then asked if we still had our old house. I\nreplied telling him of its sale and of the other house my mother afterwards\nrented. From this he proceeded to tell me that he was living just outside\nBromley, but had decided to go back to Ramsgate and was now inquiring\nabout houses there. He then showed a letter which had that morning\ncome from a house-agent and which offered him a house and a bungalow.\nWe spent some time discussing the relative merits of these two properties.\nOnly after we parted did I realise that this conversation had fulfilled the\nforecast so recently given.\nI am well aware that ultra-critical people may assign this forecast to\nthe action of delayed telepathy between this gentleman and the medium\nor me. And indeed there seemed to be a possibility, which I saw on\nreflection, of some such telepathic explanation. It might be something as\nfollows : This gentleman seeing me in Bromley decided to speak when\nopportunity offered. On receiving the letter from the house-agent about\nproperties in Margate and Ramsgate he decided to discuss it with me\nshould we shortly meet. This intention, being fairly strong and directed\nto me, reaches my aura where it remains deciperable. Let us therefore\nsuppose that Feda during the sitting becomes aware of it, but mistakenly\nattributes it to my mother who is then speaking.\nI did not consider this suggestion in any way satisfactory ; it seemed to\n\f3i6 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nraise more difficulties and improbabilities than it solved. But it decided\nme to put questions should I again meet the garage proprietor. A\nmeeting came about accidentally this morning and I write this immediately\non reaching home. He had seen me in Bromley, but that was four years\nago on his first arrival in the neighbourhood. As he had not seen me again\nhe concluded that I no longer lived here.\nThis seems to dispose of the telepathy hypothesis and to absolve the\ngentleman from any thought about me which could have brought about\nthe forecast.\nHow then shall the forecast be explained ? My mother, on being asked\nthis at a later sitting, could only reply that she had felt it strongly, but did\nnot know how the idea came to her.\nMy Suggested Explanation\nOn thinking the matter over there emerged from my store of memories\none which seemed to form some basis for a reasonable hypothesis. My\nsister had long ago described how plans were made in higher spheres and\npassed thence to those whose work lay with earth. \" Suppose,\" she said,\n\" the thought is sent that the poor in London should almost immediately\nbe assisted in some special way. It goes forth as an impersonal message\nurging help to the needy. As it is passed down through the spheres it\ngains individuality until it would be caught by some who, when on earth,\nwere in touch with London conditions and possibly by some whose\nfriends were living there in poverty. The next step will be that promptings\nare given strongly by them to social workers, or charitable persons, who\nso become impressed with the idea that something should be done.\"\nMore was said, but the above suffices for our purpose. It states that\nsome of the plans made in the Beyond require human co-operation and\nthat therefore human minds have to be impressed.\nIt would be natural that general directions should be given out by beings\nof greater experience and wisdom and passed down to others for applica-\ntion in detail. The latter may not always understand the plans in which\nthey thus take part and help bring into effect. This is the method\nadopted by National Governments when higher officials issue general\ndirections which are carried out in detail by subordinates.\nIf such be actually the case, we can understand how it is that some\ncommunicators give forecasts which they themselves do not understand,\nbut merely \" feel \", and also that some of these dimly perceived directions\nmay have a scientific or experimental purpose in view.\nOne can realise that the impressing of human minds is not easy. Some\nwould have more aptitude for it than others. In my long experience of\nreceiving messages from first-time communicators it has been noticeable\nthat, while some did well, most did it indifferently and many failed to be\neffective. This being so when it is a case of impressing the Control\nduring the favourable conditions of a sitting, how much more uncertain\nmust be the impressing of men and women who are in the midst of their\ndaily avocations and preoccupied!\nTo quote my sister again, \" We have to learn the effect of our power\nand to what extent it may be distorted or interfered with on your side.\"\nMany will prove unreceptive and others unresponsive.\n\fForecasts and Precognition\nAnother statement may be suggestive when added to the foregoing.\nWe are told that in the Beyond there are groups of people who were\ninterested in psychic studies while here and who pursue them still. One\ncan imagine how such persons will wish to discover to what extent their\ntelepathy is reliable when directed to minds on earth. To discover this\nthey would need to experiment. And each new arrival who elected to\nwork for earth would find it necessary to practise this art.\nThe Plan\nWith the foregoing in mind let us picture how the particular forecast\nwe are discussing might have been planned.\nCertain facts would be already known to the planners.\n1. That the garage proprietor and I both resided in Bromley.\n2. That he was hoping to get a house in Ramsgate.\n3. That he would remember me, my mother and her house, . .\nThe problem of the planners would therefore be :\nA. To bring about our meeting.\n\/\nB. To impress him to speak to me.\nC. To induce him to refer to Ramsgate days, our house there, and to\nproperty.\nShould they succeed in this it would be evidence to them that their tele-\npathic effort was successful ; if it failed they must learn how to become\nmore effective.\nThe plan succeeded as foretold. The garage proprietor was led to\ncross my path. While walking along the street I noticed a slightly\nfamiliar face approaching. Not recollecting the name or the place where\nI had seen him, I should certainly have passed by had he not accosted me.\nIt was he who spoke to me and asked if I did not recognise him. So the\ntelepathic influence would seem to have been exerted on him and not on\nme. I was taking my usual shopping route, whereas he was rarely in\nBromley. I have seen him but once since and that was a few days after.\nThat he should on this very morning have received the letter offering him\na choice of properties made it the ideal day for bringing about the fulfilment\nof the forecast.\nHow long previously this may have been planned we cannot guess, but\nits fulfilment was twenty-one days after my receiving the forecast.\nFurther Speculations\nHow came the plan to be made the subject of a forecast? It may be\nthat to make my mother \" feel it strongly \" and then tell me of it at the\nsitting was an exceptional addition to ordinary procedure. Possibly the\nplanners were testing their ability to impress my mother from their\nhigher sphere ; if so, that would account for her receiving the impression\nvaguely and without full detail.\nAnother suggestion would be that my mother happened to catch the\nthought which was directed to me by planners on a sphere beyond hers.\nMy father, speaking through Mrs Leonard, once told me that he had caught\nthe idea of a building close to our house. This seemed most unlikely to\nhappen, yet the event proved that my next door neighbour had been\nI\n\fC. Drayton Thomas [Part\nplanning to build, and did presently build, a garage close to our dividing\nfence. Many similar instances could be given.\nAgain, it is conceivable that the planners wished to draw my attention\nforcibly to the subject of precognition with a view to emphasising the fact\nof their planning for earth. Certainly this incident, together with others\nabout the same time, did very definitely cause me to begin a study of\nprecognition.\nWhether the above speculations are in accord with fact or not, it is,\nI consider, highly probable that such plans are frequently decided on,\neven if rarely made the subject of forecasts. Can we suppose that ardent\ninvestigators of psychic problems lose their interest when transported to\nanother realm of life? Would they not be curious to investigate from\ntheir new standpoint.? Others may have done it before, but each who\nwished to work for the good of humanity would need to learn for himself\nhow to influence human minds. Until this can be done with some degree\nof certainty no important work for earth could be undertaken. Such\nexperimental practice might well be sometimes made the subject of a\nforecast, as providing a more definite mark at which to aim. And the\nfact that the majority of forecasts relate to unimportant matters is in\naccord with this suggestion ; for it is just such trivial forecasts which\nprove most arresting to us on account of their unlikelihood and which also\nleast interfere with the usual course of our lives!\nThat a certain amount of experimenting is undertaken by some in the\nBeyond is a conclusion suggested by other instances. My father, in the\ncourse of earlier sittings, often spoke of his wish to discover whether he\ncould do so-and-so. Often he failed, sometimes he succeeded. The\nMyers communicator at Mrs Willett's sittings once said, \" I am now\ngoing to begin fresh experiments. You might tell Mrs Verrall, when\nopportunity occurs, that the need for experiment from this side has not\nbeen sufficiently grasped on your side.\"\nIt would not follow that those who may be planning to influence human\nminds in order to achieve some particular end are uniformly wishful to\ngive a forecast of the hoped-for result. These forecasts are infrequent\nand, of course, the opportunity for giving us information beforehand is\nlimited.\nReference might be made to the series of Cross Correspondences which\nwere obviously attempts at instructive and cleverly devised experiments,\n(See S.P.R. Proceedings for June, 191 1 and several later numbers.)\nIn Human Personality, Vol. 2, p. 275, Myers says, \" Experiments, I say,\nthere are ;\nprobably experiments of a complexity and difliculty which\nsurpass our imagination ; but they are made from the other side of the\ngulf, by the eff'orts of spirits who discern pathways and possibilities which\nfor us are impenetrably dark. We should not be going beyond the truth\nif we described our sensitives as merely the instruments, our researchers\nas merely the registrars, of a movement which we neither initiated nor\ncan in any degree comprehend.\"\nIf Myers found good ground for believing that experiments were\nplanned and carried out by the discarnate, much more can we ; for since\nhis day we have had, besides the Cross Correspondence series, Book\nTests, and then experiments with The Times, in which names and words\n\f175] Forecasts and Precognition 319\nwere given which would be found in the morrow's issue, although not\nyet in type at the hour when the forecast was given.\nExperimental forecasts indicate an important line of evidence for the\ncontinued activity and interest in our doings of those who have preceded\nus into a more exalted sphere of life.\nClass F\nPure Precognition\nA few of the forecasts received by me through Mrs Leonard look like\npure precognition, i.e. veridical cognition of the future obtained by some\nmeans other than rational inference. I give as examples the two following.\nThe Eastwood Sisters\nDuring a Leonard sitting on December 17th, 1943, while Feda was\nspeaking for my sister Etta, she remarked that a visitor was coming to\nstay at our house. This struck me as absurdly impossible, for the follow-\ning reasons. We had but recently resumed occupation after having closed\nthe house for three years. Our two maids, both over sixty, were now\nexerting themselves to the utmost in cleaning the place from attic to cellar\nand although the task was far from ended they were both visibly weary\nand overworked. It was out of the question to impose extra labour on\nthem, such as a visitor would involve. Besides this, my wife was seriously\nill, so ill indeed that it was necessary to obtain outside help in nursing her,\nand a Miss Eastwood came for this purpose each morning. As for myself,\nhousehold shopping and attendance on my wife left no leisure for entertain-\ning visitors. We were all living under pressure of exacting conditions.\nAnd so I regarded this announcement as nonsense.\nYet the visitor actually came and stayed w'ith us five nights!\nAbout midnight on Sunday, the 2nd of January, there was a short air\nraid over Bromley, where we reside. Two bombs fell near the town\ncentre but did not explode. The Fire Wardens therefore cordoned off\nadjacent streets and shephered the residents to a public shelter where\nthey might remain until the bombs should have exploded or been removed.\nAmong these people were the above-mentioned Miss Eastwood and her\ntwo sisters. The former arrived next morning looking tired and over-\nwrought. She informed our maids of the night's experience and of the\npublic shelter in which they had sat, cold and miserable, until daybreak.\nShe also mentioned that they were to make that shelter their home for a\nprobable five nights, and were dismayed at the prospect.\nOur housemaid repeated the story to me and then suggested that it\nwould be a kindness to offer the three sisters the use of our spare rooms.\nRealising that this housemaid would have to shoulder the chief part of\nall extra work involved, and as the cook said she had no objection, I\ndiscussed the matter with my wife and we then invited the three sisters\nto come. They accepted the invitation and spent the following five\nnights at our house.\nHere are verbatim notes of the forecast given sixteen days before.\nFeda : Etta wanted to say that she got a very strong impression\n\u2014\n\f320 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nthis may be something to do with Clara\u2014of someone coming back\ninto your house that was connected with it before.\nC. D. T. : Very unHkely!\nFeda : Very unHkely, perhaps, to your mind, but very likely to hers.\nShe wants you to remember that.\nC. D. T. : What makes you think that, Etta?\nFeda : She gets a strong feeling of a return of someone.\nC. D. T. : I wonder how you get that feeling.\nFeda : She says, I can't quite explain it in words that would convey\nit to you.\nC. D. T. : We are not thinking of having anyone and I doubt if\nanyone is thinking of coming.\nFeda : It's not quite an ordinary visitor, but rather quickly, rather\nsuddenly ; don't think I mean today or tomorrow, I'm not quite sure\nof that. But what I mean is\u2014wait a minute\u2014that when they come\nthey will come without very much notice or\u2014do you see? perhaps no\nnotice. She feels as if they might come, as it would appear, suddenly\nto you ; and she does feel it is someone who has been linked up with\nyour house. It's like a return of someone, and don't put it out of your\nmind because you don't think it could possibly happen. It is certainly\nnothing you have arranged for, nothing at all ; and she just leaves it at\nthat.\nNote in the above remarks :\n1. \" This may be something to do with Clara \". Clara is my wife, and\nher dressmaker for thirty years has been one of the Eastwood sisters.\n2. \" Someone who has been linked up with that house. It is like a\nreturn of someone.\" The dressmaker has often visited our house, besides\nwhich she spent two of her summer holidays here. Her sister, as previously\nmentioned, had been coming daily to help.\nIt will be noticed that Feda said \" someone \" and also \" they \"; the\nlatter word was probably used because Feda was not told the sex of the\nperson in question.\n3. How perfectly apposite were the phrases used :\n\" a return,\" \" to\ndo with Clara,\" \" someone coming back into your house that was\nconnected with it before,\" \" not quite an ordinary visitor,\" \" rather\nquickly, rather suddenly,\" \" someone who has been linked up with that\nhouse,\" \" nothing you have arranged for \".\nAll the above are accurate descriptions of what came to pass. It was\nonly after the invitation had been given and accepted that its relevancy to\nthis forecast occurred to me : for the forecast had in the meantime quite\npassed from my memory.\nNote the chain of events which led to the fulfilment of my sister's\nforecast. Of these there were five :\n1. A German airman flew over Bromley dropping two bombs ; and\nof all the extensive area of the town it was within a small rectangle of\nstreets which included the Eastwoods' home that they fell.\n2. These were delayed-action bombs. Had they exploded on falling it is\nunlikely that the Eastwood sisters would have quitted their house.\n3. Two of these sisters had been intimately connected with my wife,\n\f175] Forecasts and Precognition 321\n4. But for the fact that one of them was now in daily attendance at our\nhouse we should have remained unaware of their plight.\n5. Had not the housemaid suggested our offering hospitality it would\nnot have occurred to me to invite them.\nOur guests remained with us for five nights. And so it was that various\n\" chance happenings \" combined to bring about the exact fulfilment of\nthe prediction given at my sitting sixteen days before\n!\nWas the German bomber impressed, influenced (term it how we may),\nto drop his bombs at the particular spot and moment which would bring\nabout the event as foreseen.? We do not know!\nI am confident that this fulfilment was no chance coincidence, but\nfurther than this I cannot go. It will have been noticed that Etta \" gets a\nstrong feeling \", and when I express a wish to know more, she says, \" I\ncan't explain it in words that would convey it to you.\"\nThe source of feeling is often elusive even with ourselves, especially\nwith faint impressions that so-and-so is likely to happen ; and it might\nwell be that Etta, while aware of the feeling, was far from clear as to its\norigin. On the other hand she might have known something of the laws\nof cause and effect, as they operate on realms above earth, but despaired\nof her ability to convey to me anything that I should find intelligible.\nAnd so I have placed this Eastwood forecast here where it may serve\nto illustrate that class of precognitions which, up to the present, has defied\nthe human intellect to explain it. One may make guesses but guessing\nintroduces factors about which we make other guesses. To \" expkin\n\"\nthe unknown by other unknowns would satisfy neither the reader nor me.\nThe Turn of the Tide at El Alamein\nIn the spring of 1941 the British Army of Occupation in Libya was\nchivalrously depleted to provide an Expeditionary Force for the succour\nof the Greeks. The Germans seized the chance of sending over the\npowerful force with which Rommel hoped to invade Egypt. By\nNovember 1941 Rommel was raiding the Egyptian frontier. Then we\nhad some successes and forced him back so resolutely that by December\n6th our patrols were raiding 150 miles into Tripoli. Shortly after this we\nbroke Rommel's front and captured Benghazi.\nThen came our reverses and before the end of January 1942 Rommel\nhad retaken Benghazi.\nThe following June we had to retire to the Egyptian frontier, but left a\nconsiderable garrison to hold Tobruk. In June we lost Tobruk and\nsome 25,000 of its garrison. Then Rommel captured Mersa Matruh and\nwe lost another 6,000 men. By June 30th the Germans were within 90\nmiles of Alexandria!\nThat was our worst plight and only relieved by the assurance that\nreinforcements were on their way round the Cape of Good Hope.\nOn July ist, fighting was resumed around El Alamein. By the nth\nwe had taken 2,000 prisoners and another 4,000 by the 19th. When\nGeneral Auchinleck relinquished the command he was able to announce\nthat in the previous two months we had captured 10,000 of the enemy.\nIt was on August i8th, 1942 Lieut-General Montgomery was given\ncommand of the 8th Army, and on October 23rd began an all-out off'ensive.\n\f322 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nIt was successful. By November 3rd Rommel's forces were in disorderly\nretreat. Two weeks later the Germans were driven out of Cyrenaica and our\nchurch bells were ringing for the victory. That was the first stage in the\nGerman retreat, which continued intermittently until the only Germans\nleft alive in North Africa were in our prisoners' cages.\nThis decisive victory, a turning point of the war, was gained at the end of\nOctober and the first days of November. According to an official account,\nannounced by the B.B.C., the actual turn of the tide began on October ^oth.\nAt midsummer I came down from Yorkshire to take sittings with Mrs\nLeonard. The full text of my records are given later ; for the moment\nI limit them to this summary :\nJune T,oth 1942. Your father feels sure that something very, very\nimportant comes in October. \" He keeps writing 28th, and 29th,\nOctober, and turning something over then.\"\nThis crucial date was also given by another communicator. At a\nLeonard sitting on August 26th 1942, the Rev. A. F. Webling was told\nby his communicator son :\n\" I've got a date in my mind. As I told you, I don't always know\nthese things about the future . . . but in my mind recently a date keeps\ncoming up. I ought to say two dates next each other ;\nsomething\nabout October 28th and 29th ;\nsomething to do with the war. And\nI feel it is a turning point of a very, very vital kind, very outstanding. I\nseldom get anything like that. It is as if a little door opens and some-\nthing pops out, almost as if it were thrown out, saying, '\nTake that.'\nThis date came and my own mind has to interpret it. And I interpret\nit as having a very grave bearing on the war which will prove to our\nadvantage. Father, I felt relief. (This was spoken in the direct voice.)\nI would like you to underline that.\" .\nThus we find that the date given by my father sixteen weeks before\nthe event was repeated by another communicator a clear nine weeks before\nthe striking fulfilment on October 30th.\nThe date thus twice forecast proved to be the turning-point of the war\nin North Africa, the start of that invincible progress of our Eighth Army\nwhich brought our troops to Tripoli and Tunis, then through Sicily and\nfar up the Italian Peninsula, and finally by way of Normandy, Brussels\nand the Rhine to the shores of the Baltic. And with never a setback or\nretreat!\nOn November 12th, 1942, General Montgomery's Order of the Day\nsaid :\n\" We have completely smashed the German and Italian Armies.\"\nHe reported 30,000 prisoners already taken. That battle was the turning\npoint of our war in N. Africa ; it had started on October 23rd, and by\nNovember 3rd the enemy had begun a disorderly retreat. The actual\nturn of the tide of battle was October 30th, when Rommel began his\nflight from El Alamein. (This was officially reported by the B.B.C.) Our\nactual and final breakthrough was on November ist.\nThe Daily Telegraph' s review of events, given that December, said,\n\"Autumn witnessed the passing of the general strategic initiative from\nthe hands of the Axis to those of the United Nations. ... It was not,\n\f175] Forecasts (Did Pi ecug)iiUon 323\nliowever, till the end of October that the United Nations may be said to\nhave begun demonstrably to capure the initiative.\"\nThus was fulfilled the forecast that something important would mark a\nturning point at the end of October.\nHow confidently the Germans had expected to capture Alexandria is\nshown by a newsreel composed of shots taken by German cameramen in\nLibya. This newsreel was captured in North Africa and is dated October\n26th, 1941. In it the commentator says, \" Rommel's invincible troops\nare about to start this offensive,\" and the impression is given that the end\nof British offensive is but a matter of days. Little was it expected that\nby November 4th our Eighth Army would have won the smashing victory\nof El Alamein. This film was being shown in North Africa on November\n8th, 1942, when the Allies landed there. (From a correspondent of the\nDaily Telegraph.)\nOn receiving this forecast I posted a copy to Mr Saltmarsh who\nacknowledged its receipt and later wrote me about its fulfilment which\nhe had discussed with a friend. When Mr Webling sent me a copy of\nhis communicator's repetition of this same forecast I sent this also to be\nkept with mine for future reference. On Mr Saltmarsh's death these\nwere deposited with the S.P.R. Thus there are witnesses that at a date\nfour months before the event\u2014and again two months before it\u2014this\ncrucial date of the end of October had been given.\nWas any such forecast in the mind of our highest military circles? It\nwas known at the end of June that substantial reinforcements were on\ntheir way, but the ships were taking the long route round the Cape.\nHad their date of arrival been approximately known, also the period that\nmust elapse before those reinforcements could reach the battle front, it\nwould have been a risky guess to give October 28th and 29th as the date\non which those reinforcements would turn the scales in our favour. Yet\nthe communicators gave the precise date, the only modification made by\nmy father in June was that the important event might happen earlier.\nEven if we suppose that some mind, or minds, were holding this date as\nthe probable turning-point, how are we to explain the thought being\npicked up and made to emerge at Mrs Leonard's trance sitting? Merely to\nsuggest \" telepathy \" is to evade the question ; for we have no conception\nof the way by which thoughts travel from mind to mind, or are possibly\nshared by minds, apart from our everyday methods of exchanging ideas\nby word, writing, or arbitrary signs. Nor is the telepathic theory applic-\nable to the forecast given above. The Eastzvood Sisters.\nThe key to the problem of pure precognition might possibly be either,\n(a) some higher dimension of Time, or {b) perception by intelligences on\ngrades of existence higher than that of our communicators and whose\nabilities enable them to make use of causal laws unguessed by mortal\nman. These alternatives are not mutually exclusive and both might come\ninto play. But on such matters we are guessing in the dark.\nThe result of Dr Soal's experiments with Mr B. Shackleton {S.P.R.\nProceedings for December 1943) confirms the reality of pure precognition.\nWe may again quote what Myers says in Human Personality, p. 265 :\n\" I suspect that it is not by wider purview, wiser inference alone, that\nfinite minds, in the bodv or out of it, have attained to knowledge of what\n\f324 C. Diavfon Thomas [Part\nyet must be. 1 imagine that the Continuity of the Universe is complete ;\nand that therefore the hierarchy of intelhgences between our minds and\nthe World-Soul is infinite ; and that somewhere in that ascent a point is\nreached where our conception of time loses its accustomed meaning.\"\nPage 390 :\n\" Nor can we guess how high may be the communicating\nintelligence, how far-reaching its prefigurement of what for us has yet to\nbe. We are led thus to our last, our boldest conjecture . . . the possibility\nof a knowledge which comes to man from no individual, or at least from\nno human source : which is no longer inference but the reflection of\nReality itself.\"\nIn some instances it is difficult to decide whether the forecast should\nbe classed as experimental or a pure precognition. Consider the following\ntwo. First one from Mrs A. W. Verrall's paper on her \"Automatic\nWritings \" (S.P.R. Proceedings for October 1906, p. 331). In December\n1 90 1 she wrote of a man reading by candle-light a book Marmontel ; it\nwas borrowed, and one of two volumes. The following was given as a\nclue to this, \" Passy may help. Souvenirs de Passy or Fleury.\"\nOn March ist, 1902, a Mr Marsh came on a visit and mentioned that\nhe had been reading Marmontel. On being asked to say under what\ncircumstances he had read this book, his replies bore out the forecast.\nOn February 21st he had read the first volume, which contained an\naccount of the finding at Passy of a panel connected with the story in\nwhich Fleury played an important part.\nThere were a few inaccuracies, but so close an agreement between the\nscript and the fact as to preclude chance coincidence. The account is\nimpressive and should be studied in full.\nAs written it looked like a reminiscence and not a forecast of the future,\nthe script of December giving the incident as in the past : whereas it did\nnot actually occur until the following February. Was this part of the test\nblurred during reception.' It looks more like an experiment than pure\nprecognition ; for the words introducing it were, \" Nothing too mean,\nthe trivial helps, gives confidence. Hence this.\"\nWe cannot easily imagine the means by which a communicator might\nhave contrived to bring about a fulfilment of the forecast, but we may\nassume that he would rely upon laws psychological and causal at present\nunknown to us.\n*\nThe second case is given by Myers in S.P.R. Proceedings for December\n1899, p. 487. It has often been quoted in abbreviated form, but should\nbe read in full.\nMrs Atlay, wife of the then Bishop of Hereford, dreamed that she\nread prayers in the Palace Hall during her husband's absence ; that prayers\nbeing ended she opened the dining room door and saw between table and\nsideboard a large pig!\nWhen morning came Mrs Atlay recounted her dream to the children\nand their governess and presently read family prayers, the Bishop being\naway. She then opened the dining room door and was astonished to see\nan enormous pig standing in the spot where she had seen it in her dream.\nQuestions by Myers brought answers showing that the pig was not in the\nPalace at the time of the dream, but safely in its sty. It had entered the\nroom while gardeners cleaned the sty and prayers were in progress.\n\f175] Forecasts and Precognition 325\nServants coming for prayers had left all doors open. The pig had\nwandered some distance to enter the house.\nIs this a case of the purely precognitive faculty, which possibly lies\ndormant in us all? Or could it have been the result of an experiment by\nsome discarnate humorist, who either saw his opportunity in the unfastened\nsty and open doors of the Palace, or who had influenced those concerned\nto give the pig its chance, and then, trying his powers on the animal, had\nguided its wanderings?\nMyers wrote (see Human Personality, p. 390) :\n\" In many of our cases\nthere is absolutely no clue to the source of precognitions ; and we may\nascribe all these, if we will, to the Subliminal Self without extraneous aid.\nYet, on the other hand, there are many cases where the agency of\nunembodied spirits is asserted, and with evidence that cannot be ignored.\"\nCONCLUSION\nReviewing our examples, we note that those least difficult to understand\nrelated to human plans already existing in some incarnate mind. It would\nseem that our purposes can sometimes be observed by friends in the\nBeyond and made the foundation for a statement that such-and-such a\nthing will come to pass. And it usually happens! But if, meanwhile,\nwe change our plan, or its execution should be delayed, the forecast\nbecomes to that extent inaccurate.\nSecondly, we found a type of forecast which seemed to depend on the\nability of agents in the Beyond to use, and perhaps modify, our human\nplans, adapting them to plans of their own.\nThirdly, we saw that human co-operation is occasionally asked for in\npsychic sittings which provide opportunity for the request.\nA fourth class, somewhat similar to the second, differs from it in that\nthe original plan, which forms the groundwork, was not man's but one\ndevised in the Beyond.\nWe thus conclude that in such forecasts of the future we have a body\nof evidence for the existence of intelligent action in minds other than\nthose of earth.\nIt has been suggested that Time is an illusion, or that there is a different\ntime-scale in other-world conditions, so that events yet to happen here\nhave already happened there. Doubtless this is attractive to students of\nrelativity, and even to the man-in-the-street who knows that what he sees\nwhen looking at the star Sirius is that which happened there some eight\nyears ago, and that what takes place on Sirius today cannot be observed\nfrom earth until another eight years have elapsed. Yet such considerations\ndo not lead me to feel satisfied that, if I see a car accident this day week\nopposite my house, it has already happened in ethereal realms!\nHence I have suggested explanations which do not run counter to life\nas we know it, and which agree with what we are told of activities in the\nlife Beyond. It is, in brief, that higher minds can infer, from what they\nobserve, combined with what they themselves plan to do, that such and such\nan event will presently happen. Compare this with the planning of\nenterprising business men, of Cabinet Ministers, of Generals in wartime.\n\f326 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\nWhat these do in earthly life is done, I suggest, by their predecessors in\nthe Great Beyond.\nThere remains a Mysterious Aspect of Precognition\nWhen we have sorted out collections of forecasts and glimpsed possible,\nor even probable, explanations of the simpler types, there remain some\nfor which any explanation so far suggested seems highly improbable.\nWhat, for instance, are we to think of the two cases, Eastwood Sisters and\nTurn of the Tide at El Alamein} or of the Gordon Davis Case} In the\nlatter there was minutely and accurately described to Dr S. G. Soal at his\nsittings, a house and some conspicuous articles of its furniture. Yet the\nfuture occupant of that house did not go to reside there until eleven\nmonths later and it was his occupation and his furniture which had been\ndescribed in the forecast. At the date of Dr Soal's sitting other people\nwere living in that house and some of the furniture described had not yet\ncome into the possession of its future occupant! (A full account of this\nnoteworthy case is given in the S.P.R. Proceedings for December 1925,\nPP- 569-589-).\nOn my briefly recounting this Gordon Davis Case to one of my\ncommunicators he said, \" With regard to the apparent knowledge of facts\nas they would be at a future time\u2014so it seems\u2014I have spoken to you of\nwhat we term The Eternal Now. I myself have often thought that your\nnext week is sometimes our today. I have compared notes with others\nand find that we agree. I am frequently uncertain whether a thing\nhappened to you yesterday, or whether it is to happen tomorrow.\n\" In the case you mention . . . the house and its furniture may have been\nseen as a picture of what would presently be. Visions of the future have\nundoubtedly been seen and described with extraordinary detail. Another\npossibility is that the power of thought happened to be focussed by\nconscious or unconscious desire ; the man may have wished for a house of\nthat kind. The power of thought is indeed strong ; it may have raised\nhim to a state in which he could visualise and describe it. There is such a\nthing as projection of vision, or, let us say, a stray beam penetrates the\nwindow or wall of time. It would not be well for it to operate often, but it\nis permitted occasionally to show that it can be done.\"\nThat it is sometimes done seems evident from the facts of precognitive\nclairvoyance.\nHad our communicators said that they obtained information about a\nfuture event from people on higher spheres than their own, that would\nhave but removed the problem a step further away and left it still unsolved.\nWhat they do say, however, is that they themselves can sometimes\nbecome aware of the future event without knowing how this awareness\ncomes to them. This can be paralleled with our own experience.\nFor we are constantly aware of facts without being able to understand\nhow the awareness arises in consciousness. I am not alluding to rare and\ndramatic occasions, called supernormal. I am thinking of the thousands\nof instances which occur daily : for when we see, hear, feel with hands,\ntaste or smell, the same thing happens! We are mostly oblivious to the\nwonder of this ; for having been accustomed to it from childhood we fail\n\f175] Forecasts and Precognition 327\nto notice the inexplicable in that which inevitably, regularly and constantly\nhappens.\nOur sense organs, eye, ear, etc., serve to bring nerve impulses to the\nbrain. That is well understood ; for the nerves can be dissected and their\nrate of impulse-passage measured. But why should impulses which reach\nthe brain produce in us an awareness of what takes place around us?\nWe know that they do this, but we are unaware how. Between brain and\npersonal consciousness there is a mysterious process which has not, so\nfar, been grasped by man's efforts to understand it.\nAnd so, like our communicators, we know without knowing how we\nknow.\nIn foretelling a future event, communicators sometimes remark that\nthey \" feel strongly \" that it will happen\u2014for example, the Eastwood\nForecast, and the reference to property and Ramsgate in the Garage\nProprietor case. Such foretellings are a manifestation of the basic fact of\nawareness, and only strike us as strange because they are less common\nthan other forms of it which occur with us in daily consciousness. While\ncommunicators occasionally become aware of events in the near future,\nwe are continually becoming aware of things in the near vicinity, and this\nawareness (via the senses) is a mystery too.\nTo those who believe that life beyond death affords unlimited scope\nfor progressive development, it is reasonable to think that some at least\nof those who passed on thousands of years ago will have attained knowledge\nand powers of mind far beyond imagination to conceive. On earth there\nare yet remote and backward tribes whose members, not having conversed\nwith travellers and explorers, would be completely unable to realise the\nmethods by which some of our everyday actions are accomplished. And,\nthough the learner might be eager and his teachers expert, it would be\nimpossible to make him understand how we travel by train, talk by\ntelephone, reproduce by gramophone, or hear and see by radio, unless\nand until a number of mechanical and electrical operations had first been\nmade clear to him. To a man whose most lethal weapon was the poisoned\ndart, the construction and action of atomic bombs would be inconceivable.\nOur knowledge of these things has come through the labours and\ninventiveness of generations. Each stage gained made further stages\npossible. Some events were more epoch-making than others ; the\nproduction and use of fire, of explosives, of steam and electricity, marked\nepochs in human progress ; as also in the mental progress of mankind did\nthe alphabet, numerals and printing.\nIn my many years of intercourse with friends in the Beyond it has\nbecome abundantly clear that they have not remained stationary in mental\npower, but that activity of thought and acquisition of knowledge have been\naccelerated. When one considers the change in outlook and power of\napprehension which the few years between adolescence and advanced\nmaturity have brought us, it can be better imagined what progress is being\nenjoyed by those who passed centuries ago and whose activities are not\nchecked by the need of spending one-third of their time in sleep. May\nwe not liken them to the travellers and explorers who know so much more\nthan they can explain to remote and backward tribesmen in whose\nposition, relative to the former, we find ourselves? Until we have grasped\n\f328 C. Drayton Thomas [Part\ncertain elusive truths, we are precluded from grasping others yet more\ndifficult. Among the latter may be the nature of time.\nConsider the implications of the following conversation which foUovved\nmy reporting the success of the Eastwood Sisters forecast and for which\nI invited explanation :\nFeda : Your father says that Etta, owing to her deep interest in\nmatters psychical when on earth, has more ability than many in\nestimating, from what she feels or knows, what will come to pass.\nC. D. T. : But surely it is impossible to estimate without some facts\non which to build? In this case there was no plan in anyone's mind.\nFeda : He doesn't know how to explain through Feda what he means\nand would wish to say. But he thinks people like Etta, who develop\ntheir psychic gifts before and after passing, can to some extent make a\nbetter use of their understanding about Time. When she gave you the\nprediction there was apparently no foundation for it.\nC. D. T. : None whatever.\nFeda : Look, he is going like this ;\nEtta\u2014a line there A and one\nthere B. She anticipated B, ahhough she was at the point A.\nC. D. T. : Yes, that is clear.\nFeda: On your plane of perception, unless in some exceptionally\npsychic state, you would have to stay at your own point in time. Etta\nhas a better, shall I say, observation post than yours.\nC. D. T. : Admitted ; but she cannot see what does not exist!\nFeda : But it does exist! And that is just what I cannot explain.\nC. D. T. : Then your statement is that there was a sense in which\nthe event had already taken place and Etta was able to view its happen-\ning, although in earthly time\u2014 . , , , r ,\nFeda : In earthly time it had not materialised. It had not manifested\nitself in your conditions, in your dimension.\nOur mental powers have been evolved in a struggle for physical needs\nand seem at present incapable of grasping adequately such facts as endless\nspace time without beginning or termination, or even the modus operandi\nof our memory and perception. It may be that an understanding of\nprecognition will be less difficult than the foregoing. Yet it is sufficiently\ndifficuh to baffle our present mental powers.\nMan is able to see for a certain distance around him ;\noptical instruments\ncan give him more far-reaching views. But the deepest plumbing into\nspace by the most efficient of his instruments fails to find any indication\nof finality\n\u2022\nthere is yet more to be seen beyond the furthest limits of\nvision And so it is with mental probings also ;\nfor man finds himself\nsurrounded by a mental haze into which he probes in vain. It is true that\nhe sees the immediate concrete earth, also the social life around him. But\nwhat a restricted gaze! If he would view the life and conditions of his\ngreat-grandparent's time he must depend on a few old letters, certain\nbooks and historical records which convey to him little of the viyid life\nwhich those departed relatives knew. Still more is he fogged when he\ndesires to see how the successive strata of the earth beneath his feet were\nlaid or the actual condition of the earth's central core. Imagination,\naided by scraps of inference, is his only probe in this, as in many other\n\f175] Forecasts and Precognition 329\ndirections also. In whichever direction he looks this impenetrable haze\nbaffles him. The majority of his fellows therefore elect to take life as it\ncomes, assessing things at their surface value and leaving to scientists and\nphilosophers the inferential delving into that which does not seem to\nimmediately concern either our necessities or our pleasure.\nWhat wonder, then, that they accept Time in like manner and have no\nsuspicion of the mystery at which instances of precognition hint? Men\nwith spiritual experience rest satisfied that, as they step firmly forward in\nthe path of duty, a further length of that path will be made clear, step by\nstep, by the Providence which has shaped the pathway hitherto. For to\nsuch men the Guided Life is a most real fact.\nIn addition to the collected cases of Myers, Richet and Osty, instances\nof foreknowledge and prediction, gathered from S.P.R. Proceedings and\nelsewhere, will be found in the following more recent books :\nSome Cases of Prediction. Dame Edith Lyttelton.\nForeknowledge. H. F. Saltmarsh.\nThe Personality of Man. G. N. M. Tyrrell. ,\n,\n\fOBITUARY\n' ~ LORD RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.\nRobert John Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, was a member of the family in\nwhich interest in psychical research dated back beyond the formation of the\nSociety for Psychical Research, and was closely associated with distinction\nin physical science. His father was one of the group of Cambridge scientists\nwith whom Sidgwick, Gurney and Myers were closely allied, and his mother\nwas a Miss Balfour and shared to the full the manifold intellectual interests\ncharacteristic of that family. Lord Rayleigh joined the Society in 1925\nand was President for the years 1937-1938. He was a man of very many\nactivities, not only in the field of pure science but in the application of\nscientific methods to the management of large agricultural estates.\nOf his work in physics Dr A. J. C. Wilson of University College, Cardifl^,\nwrites as follows :\n-\nLord Rayleigh as a Physicist\n\" Among the younger generation of scientists Lord Rayleigh's achieve-\nment as a physicist hardly receives the recognition it deserves. There are\nprobably two complementary reasons for this ; his reputation is over-\nshadowed by that of his great father, and his early election to the Royal\nSociety and similar honours are attributed to his inherited position rather\nthan to his ability. In truth however his own work in experimental physics\nand his long record of public service amply justify the many honours he\nreceived.\nHis early interest was radioactivity, and he published numerous papers\nin this field, typical subjects being Distribution of Radium in the Earth's\nCrust, Helium and Argon in Common Rocks, Direct Estimate of the\nMinimum Age of Thorianite, and Accumulation of Helium in Geological\nTime. His work on the distribution of helium in various rocks led to an\nestimate of the \" age \" of the earth, that is, of the time during which the\nearth has existed as a solid body. Among his other contributions to the\nmain line of advance of physics were studies of line spectra and of active\nnitrogen. The work on line spectra was carried out in collaboration with the\nlate Professor A. Fowler, and was important in the latter's interpretation\nof line spectra and in the development of the quantum theory.\nLord Rayleigh's independent position and private laboratory at Terling\nmade it possible for him to explore some of the fascinating by-ways of\nscience, closed to the industrial physicist, and fast closing to the academic\nphysicist in a world of planning. Among these may be classed his work\non the colours of beetles' wings and on the ultimate shape of pebbles.\nHis interest in minerals, early shown in his studies of radioactivity, was\nmaintained to the end of his life, one of his last papers being on an attempt\nto imitate the structure of the type of stony meteorites called pallasites.\nBesides his strictly scientific work he published biographies of his\nfather and Sir J. J. Thomson.\nIt would be improper not to mention Lord Rayleigh's activities as\nChairman of the Civil Research Committee on Radium Requirements,\n330\n\f[Part 175] Obituary 331\nChairman of the Governing Body, Imperial College of Science, President of\nthe British Association, and chairman or member of many other boards and\ncommittees, though details hardly fall within the scope of this note. It is in\nthis field of public service to science that his loss will be most widely felt.\"\nHis other activities afforded him little leisure to devote to active psychical\nresearch, but he maintained a very keen interest in the Society, which he\nshowed both by contributing papers to the Proceedings and by his share in\nthe administrative work of the Society, and shortly before his death by a\nvery generous donation. Besides his Presidential Address he described\nin Vol. XLI of Proceedings \" A Method of Silhouette Photography by\nInfra-red Rays for use in Mediumistic Investigation \", as to which\nDr A. J. B. Robertson writes as follows :\n\" Rayleigh in 1932 described a method of silhouette photography by\ninfra-red rays for use in the investigations of physical mediums. At that\ntime the available infra-red plates were not of sufficient sensitivity to\nenable a short period photograph to be taken without the introduction of a\ncertain amount of visible light. Rayleigh pointed out that the difficulty\ncould be overcome by photographing only a silhouette of the structures\nwhich might be produced, such as cheesecloth, or the psychical substance\nfound by E. and M. Osty to be apparently produced by the medium\nR. Schneider and to be capable of absorption of infra-red rays. With\nRayleigh's method practically the whole of the infra-red beam can be\ncaused to enter the camera and contribute to the image formation. The\nmethod, however, gives only the outlines of a uniformly opaque object.\nRayleigh used a double convex field lens of large aperture to focus the\nradiation on the camera lens, which was focussed on the region in front of\nthe field lens or on the field lens. Obstructions of the infra-red beam could\nbe detected with a photo-electric cell.\nRayleigh's apparatus was used by Lord Charles Hope and Mr C. V. C.\nHerbert in the investigation of R. Schneider. Although some absorption\nof the radiation was observed nothing definite could be seen on the plates ;\nthis may have been due to the supposed psychic substance absorbing only\nrays of a wavelength too long to be registered on the photographic plate.\nRayleigh, however, pointed out that his method was not very suitable for\nthe detailed study of ray absorption, the photo-electric cell being liable\nto accidental disturbance.\"\nIn another paper he recorded some most interesting reminiscences of\nour first President, Henry Sidgwick, who was his uncle by marriage.\nIt happened that during his presidency the Society's claim for exemption\nfrom income tax came before the Special Commissioners. At the hearing\nLord Rayleigh made a most powerful declaration as to the scientific status\nof the Society and the importance of its researches, which produced a\nprofound impression and placed the issue beyond any doubt.\nOn the outbreak of war in 1939, when there was great anxiety as to the\nsafe preservation of the Society's important archives and records against\nany risk of destruction through enemy action, Lord Rayleigh very kindly\nconsented to store the documents (about a dozen large packing cases) at\nhis country house, Terling Place, Essex, where they remained in safety\n*'\nfor the duration \".\n\f332 Obituary [part 175'\nDr N. M. Butler\nThe death of Nicholas Murray Butler, President of Columbia University,\ncarries our thoughts back to the very beginnings of psychical research.\nFor he, in collaboration with several other American scholars led by\nWilliam James, helped in the organisation of the first American Society for\nPsychical Research, and as a corresponding member of the S.P.R. retained\nhis affiliation with these lines of investigation until his death.\nTrained as a philosopher and also as a lawyer, Dr Butler was early\ndrawn into a life of administrative activities. It was he who, as Chairman\nof the Department of Philosophy at Columbia University, brought experi-\nmental psychology to that institution in the person of James McKeen\nCattell ; he who, a few years later, grasped the vision of a central teachers'\ntraining institution and gave Teachers' College, Columbia University, its\nprimary impetus ; he who, as editor of an educational journal, crossed\nswords with the reactionaries at the turn of the century. Columbia\nUniversity grew at an accelerated tempo during the opening decades of\nthis century, largely as a result of his grasp of the ways in which its under-\ngraduate and graduate schools might integrate existing local educational\ninstitutions and might serve the needs of a metropolitan community. He\nwas always active in politics and deeply concerned with problems of inter-\nnational relations, upon which he constantly wrote and spoke. It was\npartly through him that funds left by Andrew Carnegie in the interest of\nworld peace were expended for the benefit of education in international\naffairs. His knowledge of the legal and political history of Great Britain\nand the United States was drawn upon in the deliberations which followed\nWorld War I, and his advice continued to receive deep deference during\nthe succeeding years. He was, in short, among the band of distinguished\nscholars who, despite their key position in public affairs, have not held\nthemselves aloof from the still inadequately recognised domain of psychical\nresearch.\nGardner Murphy\n\fPROCEEDINGS OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nPART 176\nOBITUARY\nThe Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E.\nIn the many spheres of public Hfe in which she was interested\u2014pohtics,\nsocial reform, the League of Nations, the English-speaking Union, the\nproject for a National Theatre\u2014Dame Edith Lyttelton found opportunities\nfor the exercise of exceptional gifts of sympathy, practical good sense and a\nkeen, but kindly judgment of persons and affairs. The same qualities made\nher a most valuable member of the S.P.R., which she joined in 1902, and\nan influential member of the Council, to which she was appointed in 1928.\nAt the beginning of her Presidential Address in 1933 she said :\n\" I have no claim or right to be in this position. I have had no scienti-\nfic training. I am neither a psychologist nor a metaphysician nor a\nphilosopher \".\nTheory was not indeed her strong point, and to that extent we may agree\nwith her modest disclaimer. But sympathetic insight into human prob-\nlems, wide reading and, above all, long exercise of psychic faculties, taken\ntogether, constitute no mean qualification for high office in our Society.\nMrs Lyttelton began producing \" scripts \" in 191 3, shortly after the\ndeath of her husband, Alfred Lyttelton, her \" scripts \" being mostly\nrecords of inspirational speech. They were first made known to the\nSociety by Mr Piddington's paper in Proceedings Vol. XXIX, in which she\nis called \" Mrs King \". The real name was, however, made public in Mr\nPiddington's paper in Proceedings Vol. XXXIII (pp. 438-605), in which he\npointed out that her scripts were closely connected by verbal links, which\nhe explained in detail, with the scripts of other members of \" the S.P.R.\ngroup of automatists \" which she had not seen. If all these scripts were\nput together in accordance with the links between them, it was found that\nthere were persistent predictions of the War of 19 14 dating back to a time\nwell before any general apprehension had arisen of a serious risk of war\nbetween Britain and Germany. It would not have been surprising if Mrs\nLyttelton, with her knowledge of public affairs, had in 1913 consciously\nrecognised the risk of war as appreciable. The interesting point, psycho-\nlogically, is that she did not at the time interpret her scripts as foretelling\nwar, though to any other person that would have seemed the obvious mean-\ning, and, psychically, that her scripts dovetailed so remarkably with the\nscripts of the other automatists.\nY 333\n\f334 The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E. [Part\nThis aspect of the case did not attract so much attention as a single\nincident in her scripts, the apparent prediction, made in two scripts of\nFebruary and May 1914, of the sinking of the Lusitania in May 1915, an\nevent the effect of which on international relations has been exceedingly\nfar-reaching. The prediction was not exactly fulfilled in all details, and the\npossibility of its having been a fluke cannot be disregarded. Before, how-\never, adopting that view, the reader would do well to consider not only Mr\nPiddington's comments {Proceedings Yo\\. XXXIII, pp. 499, 500, 599-603),\nbut also what Mrs Richmond says below as to some other, unpublished,\npredictions in Mrs Lyttelton's scripts.\nNot unnaturally the problem of precognition was constantly in her mind.\nThis was the subject on which she spoke in the series of B.B.C. talks in\n1934. Out of a large number of cases then reported to her by listeners she\nmade an interesting selection published as Sotne Cases of Prediction (1938).\nMyers's description of the subliminal as part rubbish-heap and part\ntreasure-house is familiar. Between the wars popular interest in psycho-\nlogical developments was concentrated on the former aspect. Mrs\nLyttelton's book Our Superconscious Mind (1931) was a useful corrective\nof this one-sided view. Even more persuasive, however, was her own life-\nwork in which the distinguished conduct of public affairs was harmoniously\ncombined with the exercise of faculties that uninstructed opinion often\nregards as queer and unworthy of serious study.\nW. H. S.\nMrs Richmond, who came to know Mrs Lyttelton well through a\ncommon interest in psychical research, writes as follows :\nThe national, social and literary activities of Mrs Lyttelton were\nenumerated in The Times and other papers when she died on September\nthe ist, and they all put her interest in Psychical Research last on the list.\nStill, it was mentioned and this is some advance.\nReally Psychical Research and what she called the life of the soul came\nfirst and foremost in her mind, and all her other activities flowed from her\ngreat desire to help people towards a diflferent outlook in the light of a real\nbelief in Eternity. When she was young, this interest was submerged by\nthe more ordinary things of life, in which she was always intensely in-\nterested, and during the time of her great social success her psychic gifts\nwere manifested in her insight into character and her extraordinary\nsympathy for those she felt akin to, and also in her writings.\nShe wrote several plays in which Mrs Patrick Campbell, a great friend\nof hers, acted and she did not hesitate to deal with subjects not then very\npopular with playwrights, such as sweated labour, which is the theme of\nThe Thumbscrew and St Ursula. This last shows more signs of her interest\nin dreams and communications of a transcendental order. It was the death\nof her infant son that first made her fully conscious of a conflict in herself,\nabout what she really believed. The religion in which she had been\nbrought up failed to help her, and a psychological struggle ensued that\nonly sensitive people suffer from.\nBut this conflict prepared her for the blow of her husband's death in\n\f176] Obituary 335\n1913 and it was then that she started the \" automatic writing \" which, in\ntime, showed such precognitive quahties.\nThe scripts that could be understood at the time are pubHshed in\nProceedings Vol. XXXIII, March 1923, by J. G. Piddington. But several\nvery interesting points in the scripts were quite incomprehensible at that\ntime. For instance on May 24th 1915 she wrote, \" The hand stretched\nout to stay Berchtesgaden \", and on Jan. 31st 1915, four months before the\nabove, come these words,\n\" The nemesis of Fate nearer and nearer, no respite now, nearer much\nthan you think and once it begins there is no stay\u2014no one knows . . . The\nMunich bond remember that. You will see strange things \". Even when\nvictory was won in 19 18 no sense could be made of these two scripts ;\nthey\nreferred to happenings twenty years later.\nIt was not till 1922 that I met Mrs Lyttelton. My husband had been\ndoing automatic writing in connection with the S.P.R. group for a few\nyears, but we had no idea who the other writers were.\n1\nAt that time we needed a country house, and a firm of agents arranged\nan appointment for me to see Mrs Lyttelton, who had one to let. I can\nnever remember how we got onto the subject of Psychical Research\nwithin the first few minutes of that interview, but we did. The house\nbecame quite a secondary consideration and our friendship began from\nthat moment. We took the house, and soon started having sittings\ntogether in it, when Mrs Lyttelton and her daughter. Lady Craik, invited\nus, as they often did for weekends.\nSometimes all four of us wrote or spoke in turn. Sometimes, more\nrarely, Mrs Lyttelton and my husband had a sort of duet, while Lady\nCraik and I took down what they said. Very often just Mrs Lyttelton\nand I would sit together and this continued periodically till a short time\nbefore she died.\nThe content of these messages proved extremely helpful and instructive\ni\nto all of us, and they set up a curious and valuable state of telepathic\nI\nrapport that seemed, and still seems outside time. It is not possible to\nI\ndescribe this, or the various levels that our messages revealed, rapidly\nI\nchanging sometimes from trivial to profound themes, or keeping up a\nhumorous conversation full of insight and good advice, and sometimes\nstrafing us for our lack of persistence in our good resolves.\nI\nThey were definitely an educative process and an adventure together.\nThe messages for \" the S.P.R. Group \" were of quite a different tone to\nI the rest, and we hardly ever understood what they meant. But we all felt\n: reassured and encouraged if they were approved of by Mr Piddington,\nI remember Mrs Lyttelton completely rewrote her book Our Super-\n'\nconscious Mind because Lord Balfour and Mr. Piddington gave her first\nattempt at it faint praise.\nRight up to the last few days of her life she was writing a book on the\nsoul as the link between time and eternity. Her interest in this subject\nnever failed and to those of us who knew her intimately her friendship\nbelongs to the eternal things.\nI\n\fTHE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF \" DISPERSED HITS \"\nIN CARD-GUESSING EXPERIMENTS\nBy M. S. Bartlett\nA FEW years ago an informative summary account of card-guessing ex-\nperiments on telepathy, especially of those carried out by S. G. Soal, was\npublished by C. D. Broad^ ;\nreading this account recently, I found it a\nvery useful introduction to the comprehensive report^ by S. G. Soal and i\nK. M. Goldney of their series of experiments in precognitive telepathy.\n'\nHowever, as the significant results which emerged mainly arose not with\no (direct) hits, but with + i (precognitive) and - i (postcognitive) hits,\nand as some of the statistical tests described by Broad were concerned with\nthe significance of simultaneous + i and\/or - i, or + i, o and - i hits, it\nseems advisable to note that these last tests on what might be termed \" dis-\npersed hits \" are not necessarily valid, and require further examination.\nIn a test for o hits, with 25 cards of 5 types, the mean number of hits\nobtained by chance is correctly stated as 5N, where N is the total number\nof sets of 25 guesses, and the variance (standard deviation squared) as 4N ;\n(approximately). But in a joint test of o, +1 and - i hits, while the mean i\nnumber of hits is certainly 73N\/5, the variance is not necessarily, even\n4N\napproximately, 73 x \u2014,\nindependently of the guessing pattern of the subject.\nThe effect of non-random guessing patterns (in the absence of genuine\ntelepathy) is always one to be watched for. For example, it is known that\nif an experiment were conducted simultaneously on several percipients,\nthese could not be assumed necessarily to give uncorrelated answers ;\nagain, in an earlier article'' in these Proceedings, W. L. Stevens drew\nattention to the effect of a predilection on the part of the subject to a parti-\ncular topic on the original analysis made by Whately Carington of a series\nof drawing experiments. In the present instance I am not aware that the\neffect (which only arises when more than one type of hit is considered\nsimultaneously) has previously been pointed out, though qualitatively it\ncan be made apparent by considering extreme cases. Thus if I knew that\nscores were to be judged on +1,0 and - i hits simultaneously, and were\nasked to be a subject, I would deliberately choose, if I wanted to be\ncunning, a guessing pattern where runs of the same type of card occurred,\nfor then I should be likely to score heavily (on +1,0 and - i hits simul-.\ntaneously) if I scored at all, whereas on an alternating guessing pattern I\nshould be either right on o hits and hence wrong on + i and - i hits, or if\nright on + I and\/or - i hits, wrong on o hits, and therefore less likely to\nmake a big score by chance. |\nThe effect does not introduce actual bias, as I should be just as likely\n'\nto get low scores as high ones, but it alters the variance and hence the\nappropriate significance test. This difficulty is of course avoided if tests\non such simultaneous hits are not used ; for example, if a percipient were\nfound from preliminary trials to score mainly on + i hits, it would be :\n'^Philosophy, 19 (1944), 261. '^Proceedings, Part 167, 21. ^Pt. 163, 256.\n336\n\f[Part 176] Statistical Significance of \" Dispersed Hits \"\n337\nreasonable in a further series of experiments to concentrate on the signi-\nficance of such + I hits. But, at least in the case when the actual order of\nthe cards is entirely random (for example, where there is no restriction to\n5 cards of each of the 5 types in each set of 25), it is not impossible to work\nout the appropriate variance for the total score on more than one type of\nhit, appropriate to any observed guessing pattern. The method is given\nbelow for reference.\nScoring fo}- -1,0 and + i hits.\nWhen a total score receives a contribution from each guessed card on - i,\no and + I hits with the actual cards, it is easy to see that the same total\nscore is obtained if we count the number of -1,0 and + i hits of each\nactual card with the series of guessed cards. Since the actual cards are\nassumed to occur at random, the variance of the total score is the sum of\nthe variances of the scores from each actual card. Such scoring depends\non the pattern of the three relevant guessed cards. These patterns may\nbe grouped as shown in the Table (A, B, C being any three different types\nout of the five), where the corresponding contributions to the variance are\ngiven.\nPattern\n(1) AAA\n(2) A A B, A B A\n(3) A B C\n(ia)*AA\n(lb)* A B\nVariance\n36\n25\n16\n25\n_6\n25\n16\n25\n_6\n25\n* Required for the two end cards in a series.\nExamples :\n(i) Guessing pattern consisting of 25 cards of one type. This gives\ntwo patterns (la) and twenty-three of (1), so that the variance is\n2 X 16 + 23 X 36 860\n\u2014\u2014 = = 34-4\n25 25\n(This result agrees with a value worked out by Soal and communicated\nto me in the course of correspondence.)\n(ii) Guessing pattern consisting of 5 cards of one type, followed\nsimilarly by 5 cards of each other type. This gives two patterns (la),\nfifteen of (i) and eight of (2). Hence the variance is\n2x16 + 15x36 + 8x16 700 _\n= = 2o-o\n25 25\n\f338 Professor M. S. Bartlett [Part 176]\n(iii) Guessing pattern consisting of one card of each type, repeated\nfive times. This gives two patterns (ib), and twenty-three of (3).\nHence the variance is\n2x6 + 2\"? x6,\n=6-o\n25\nSimilar methods could obviously be worked out for other scoring\nsystems, e.g. - i and + i hits only, or -2, - i, o, +1, +2 hits.\nMultiply-detertnined hits.\nThe above discussion is also relevant to the discussion of what are\ntermed \" multiply-determined \" guesses, that is, where the actual cards\ncorresponding to + i precognition and - i postcognition are of the same\ntype (see Appendix B of the report referred to). Unfortunately once we\nchoose to consider the actual cards according to such a classification, we\nare in effect sorting them out into non-random groups, so that, as in the\ncase where the actual order is restricted to give 5 cards of each type in\nevery set of 25, the relation between the actual cards and the guessed cards\nbecomes rather complicated, for both sets may not be entirely random.\nHowever, it is sufficient to note that the sorting of the actual sets into\nmultiply-determined and non-multiply-determined hits creates a pattern\nfor the actual cards, so that, whether or not the guessing pattern is random,\nthe variance for such hits will be affected. This can be seen by a considera-\ntion of a hypothetical set of cards with two types only ; it is then impossible\nnot to get a + i or a - i hit if the guess is not multiply-determined, since\nif I guess A and this is wrong for the back-hit, it will score for the fore-hit.\nThe methods of the previous section may be used to obtain the appropriate\nvariance (in the absence of genuine cognition), if the guessing pattern is\nrandom, working this time on the series of guessed cards as the random\nseries and on the pattern of the actual cards according to whether or not\nthey have been classified as providing multiply-determined guesses. We\nobtain for the variance contribution to the total score of + i and - i hits\nfrom each guess for which + i and - i hits are possible :\nMultiply-determined '\n~^\nNot multiply-determined : ~ .\n^\n25 \u2022\n,\n'\nAs a check, the chance of a multiply-determined guess is \\, and\n16 I 6 4 8\n25 5 25 5 25\nthe correct variance for random guesses and random actual cards.\nIt follows that a simple test of deviations from expectation will not be\nbased on the correct variance in this particular case, and hence will not\nnecessarily be valid for the purpose used in Appendix B.\n\fREPLY TO PROFESSOR BARTLETT\nBy S. G. Soal\nI SHOULD first point out that Professor Bartlett's main criticism does not\napply to the report on Precognitive Telepathy published by Mrs Goldney\nand myself in 1943. He rightly contends that if ( + i) (o) and (\n- i) guesses\nare pooled the correct theoretical variance is not given by the binomial\nformula 73 x 4N\/25 but depends on the guessing patterns employed by the\npercipient. But in the main experiments with Shackleton the above\nmethod was not used but the ( + i ) scores were estimated separately and\nfound to yield a significant positive deviation which on a conservative\nestimate gave odds of the order of lo^s to i against such a deviation being\nthe work of chance. Professor Bartlett, I understand, would not seriously\nchallenge the statistical validity of this result. His criticism however does\napply to the method of pooling used in estimating the results of the experi-\nments with Mrs Stewart and Mr Shackleton in 1936 [\" Fresh Light on\nCard-Guessing ; some new effects \" Proceedings, S.P.R. Vol. 46, pp. 152-\n198]. It remains therefore to ascertain whether or not the significance of\nthese preliminary experiments was over-estimated.\nThere are in all 112 sets of 25 (2800 trials) of which 80 sets were pro-\nduced by Mrs Stewart and the remaining 32 by Mr Shackleton. The\nobserved standard deviation for the 112 sets is found to be 47-9 as com-\npared with the value\n^ =36-17 actually used in estimating the\nsignificance of the pooled ( + i) (o), (\n- i) guesses. We may first note that\nif we use the observed standard deviation (47-9) instead of 36-17 we still\nobtain a highly significant result.\nWe have\nTotal number of (o, +1, - i) trials =8176\nExpected number of hits =1635-2\nActual number of (o, +1, - i) hits = 1900-0\nDeviation = 264-8\nObserved standard deviation = 47-9\nCritical Ratio = 5-52\nMaking allowance for the fact that this set of 2800 trials was chosen from\na total of 128,350 trials by various persons we arrive at the approximation\nP = 2-7 X 10-''. Even so the 1936 results are seen to very significant. The\nhigh value of the observed variance is due to the fact that there is a con-\nsiderable amount of paranormal cognition and is only to be expected.\nA fairer method is to work out the expected variance by means of the\nvery useful scheme worked out by Professor Bartlett. It is a simple matter\nto count the numbers of guesses of the types AAA, AAB, etc., and to\nestimate the contributions to the variance arising from the diff\"erent types.\nI have done this both for Mrs Stewart and for Mr Shackleton.\nThe results are given in tables I and II on the next page.\n339\n\f34\u00b0 5.

Soal [Part\nTable I\n(2000 trials by Mrs Stewart)\nType A Va E Ve\nAAA 41 59-04 73-6 105-984\nABB, AAB, ABA 818 523-52 883-2 565-248\nABC 981 235-44 883-2 211-968\nAA 39 24-96 32-0 20-480\nAB 121 29-04 128-0 30-720\nTotals 2000 872-00 2000 934-400\nUnder A is given the actual number of guesses of each of the five\ncategories and under Va is the corresponding contribution to the theo-\nretical variance. Under E is given the expected number for each category\nif the subjects' guesses were a random series and under Ve the correspond-\ning variance. The total of the Ve column (934-400) should be \u2014 x 80 x 73\n25\nwhich is true.\nIt is seen that the correct value of the theoretical standard deviation is\nv\/872-00 = 29-5 which is slightly less than V934-400 = 30-6.\nHence we are on the safe side in using the formula\n^ x 80 x 73 in\nestimating significance of pooled (o, +1, - i) guesses.\nAn inspection of Table I shows that the difference between these two\nvalues is largely accounted for by the unwillingness of the guesser to repeat\nthe same symbol three or more times in succession. This tendency which\nis to be observed in the majority of subjects generally results in a lowering\nof the theoretical variance owing to the comparatively high contribution\nmade by the group AAA to the total variance. On the other hand a guesser\nwho deliberately (or otherwise) makes frequent runs of the AAA type will\ntend to create a variance which is very much higher than \u2014 x N x 73.\n25\nIt is therefore safest to use the method of Professor Bartlett.\nTable II\n(800 trials by B.

There does not appear to be any\nsimple method that is valid for finding the theoretical variance since the\nsubjects' guesses will never constitute a random series. Professor Bartlett\nhas given the variance in the case where both the guess and the presenta-\ntion series are random but additional complications will occur owing to the\npresence of true cognitions.\nTaking as a very rough estimate the variance to be J|N where N is the\nnumber of guesses for which both \u00b1 i hits are both possible and using the\nexpectations given on p. 136 Appendix B {Proceedings Part 167) under\nhypothesis (a) I find X = 27 for the 1936 work and X = 2-6 for Shackleton's\nwork with the agent J.Ai. Neither of these results is sufficiently striking\nto permit of much faith in the possibility that there is anything in this\nbusiness of multiple determination. We must therefore regretfully\nabandon the conclusions of Appendix B, but there seems no cause to doubt\nthe main result of the 1936 experiments.\n\fADDITIONAL NOTE ON A TEST OF SURVIVAL\nBy Robert H. Thouless\nThe first cipher passage given on p. 253 of my article on \" A Test of Sur-\nvival \" is no longer of any value for the test, the key word having been\ndiscovered. The second passage on p. 258 remains as a test of my survival.\nI propose also to add a third passage which (like the second) is enciphered\nby a method too complex for breaking.\nMy first passage was enciphered by the Playfair system. By spending\non it his spare time for a fortnight a cipher expert discovered the key-word,\nwhich was SURPRISE. I am grateful to him for the trouble he took over\nthe matter. The moral which must be drawn for the purpose of tests of\nsurvival is that unbreakability must be ensured by a complex method of\nencipherment ; it is not sufficient that the message should be a short one.\nThe cipher expert suggested another method of encipherment which he\nsaid would be, in practice, unbreakable, and which would also be simpler\nto construct than the method I employed for passage II. I add, therefore,\na third passage enciphered by the method he suggested : BTYRR OOFLH\nKCDXK FWPCZ KTADR GFHKA HTYXO ALZUP PYPVF\nAYMMF SDLR UVUB. This is a meaningful passage (not a quotation)\nwhich has been enciphered by a method which I will explain, involving\ntwo key words. The giving of these two key words will be the proof I hope\nto give of survival after my bodily death.\nThe method of encipherment is as follows. The original passage is\nenciphered by the Playfair system using the first of the key words.^ A\nsingle letter chosen at random is then put at the beginning and end of the\nenciphered passage and it is enciphered again by the Playfair system using\nthe second key word. The introduction of the additional letter at the\nbeginning and end is simply to throw the letter pairs out of step with\none another in the two encipherments.\nI will illustrate the method with the passage \" Balm of hurt minds \".\nLet us suppose the two key words are \" psychical \" and \" research \".\nThe two Playfair letter squares will be :\nI II\nPSYCH RESAC\nlALBD HBDFG\nEFGKM IKLMN\nN O Q R T O P Q T U\nUVWXZ VWXYZ\nThe passage is first enciphered by the first letter square :\nOriginal BA LM OF HU RT MI ND SX\nist encipherment DL DG VO PZ TN ED TI CV\n' The method of using the Playfair system can be found in most books on ciphers\nor in the Encyclopaedia Britannica article on \" Codes and Ciphers \" (vol. V p. 957).\n342\n\f[Part 176] Additional Note on a Test of Survival 343\nist encipherment (re-paired) PD LD GV OP ZT NE DT IC VP\nand encipherment QB QL HZ PQ YU KC FQ NR WO\nAnd, written in blocks of five, the passage becomes : QBQLH ZPQYU\nKCFQ NRWO.\nThe second encipherment requires one modification of the standard\nPlayfair method. Normally, any letter pair containing the same letter\ntwice repeated, is broken up by the interpolation of an X between the two.\nThis method will not do for the second encipherment because : (i) after\nthe interpolation, the pairing of the two encipherments would no longer\nbe out of step, and (ii) decipherment would be made difficult by the\nabsence of any indication of which letter was an added one. The difficulty\ncan be overcome by breaking up any such letter pair for the second\nencipherment by the interpolation of another double letter, not necessarily\n\" XX \". For example, suppose the first encipherment gave the letter\npairs : DN RA AL TP. These would be re-paired as .D NR AA L..\nLet us now insert a double C between the two As : .D NR AC CA L..\nThe letter pairs now remain out of step after the interpolation. There is\nno difficulty in deciphering since it will be apparent that the CC must be\ndropped out for the second decipherment since no pair that is not inter-\npolated could possibly have the second letter the same as the first.\nTo sum up. Passage I is now withdrawn from my test of survival since\nit has proved not to be unbreakable by rational means. Passage II remains\nas part of the test ; its key is a continuous passage. Passage III is now\nadded to replace passage I. Its key is two words. The method of en-\ncipherment of passages II and III have both been explained so that all\nthat is to be communicated is the key in each case. Both passages are\npractically unbreakable by rational means and either method is recom-\nmended for anyone who wants to repeat the test. The method described\nhere is less trouble than the other.\n\fON THE NEED FOR CAUTION IN ASSESSING\nMEDIUMISTIC MATERIAL\nBy Denys Parsons \u2022\n\u2022\nIn the Journal for March-April 1947, (p. 22), a case was contributed by\nMrs G. entitled \" Veridical information given by a medium of matters\noutside the sitter's knowledge \".^ It described part of a sitting with the\ntrance medium, Mrs Bedford, in which a communicator described the\ncircumstances of his death and sent messages.^\nOn reading this case, my first reaction was to draft a letter to the Editor\narguing that the case was evidentially almost worthless because most of\nthe statements made by the medium would be found applicable to the\ncircumstances surrounding many a passing. On second thoughts it\noccurred to me that the unsupported statement of my opinion would be\nequally worthless ;\naccordingly I devised an experiment to test it.\nFirst, it must be recalled that Mrs G.'s case was quite inadequately\nannotated. I wrote to Mrs G. asking for the answers to twenty questions\nwhich had been left unanswered by the annotators. From her answers\nit was clear that the correspondence of the medium's utterances with the\nfacts was much more exact than had been apparent from the published\nversion. The only incorrect or unrecognised items were names and\ninitials. However, I decided to proceed with the experiment.\nI obtained from four ladies, small objects for a normal psychometry\nexperiment with a professional medium (not Mrs Bedford). When the\nreadings were received they were typed out on separate sheets and onto\nthe end of each one was added, without a break, the substance of Mrs\nBedford's trance communication, transcribed practically verbatim from\nthe Journal account. The typescripts were then sent to the subjects for\nannotation. In order to impose as little as possible on the good faith of\nthese ladies who so kindly co-operated, I took care to explain that some\nfictitious items had been mixed in with the genuine reading as a \" control \".\nI did not of course explain that all the \" fictitious \" items were contained\nin a long section at the end of the reading.\nIt was necessary to guard against bias in the selection of subjects. If I\nhad chosen four ladies myself, it might be said that I had selected those\nwhom I considered might have histories similar to that of Mrs G.'s friend.\nBut Mrs G., though not a Spiritualist, has regular sittings with mediums.\nIt seemed reasonable to select subjects who might also be accustomed to\ndo so. Miss Mercy Phillimore, Secretary of the London Spiritualist\nAlliance, was kind enough to approach four ladies on my behalf. The\nonly stipulation I made was that they should be over forty years of age.\nMiss Phillimore was unaware of the nature of the experiment.\n^ The case was also published in Light, April, 1947. Mrs G. has kindly shown\nme her notes of the whole sitting which was about twice the length of the published\nexcerpt. The unpublished portion contained much material applicable to Mrs. G.,\nthough, in my opinion, its evidential value is lessened by the fact that it was not\nproxy material, as was the published section, and that it was not a first sitting.\nHowever the question whether or not the unpublished part of the sitting was\nveridical is irrelevant to the present investigation.\n344\n\f[Part 176] Caution in Assessing Mediumistic Material 345\nThe Results. The results gave confirmation of my forecast, the accuracy\nof which surprised me. The four ladies are designated Miss A., Mrs Z.,\nMrs C. and Miss D. The readings of Mrs C. and Miss D. were poor\nas a whole and completely negative for the section relevant to this experi-\nment. The readings of Miss A. and Mrs Z. were poor except for the\nspurious added passage which elicited the most striking annotations. These\nare printed on pages 346-351 in parallel columns for comparison.\nMiss A.'s annotations, with the exception of items 9 and 16, fit perfectly.^\nIn one respect the fit is even better than the original ; Mrs G.'s friend\ncould not recognise item 17 which gave the names Arthur, Charles, and\nHarold, and three initials. The name Arthur is particularly appropriate\nto Miss A., and so are two of the initials. The correspondence in item 15\nconcerning the numbers 4 and 2, is very weak, but in Mrs G.'s case it is\nlittle better, as the digits have to be reversed to make sense. The name\n\" Jack \" in item 15, I learnt afterwards, was a pseudonym, so Miss A.'s\nannotation here is irrelevant, but helps to show that almost any common\nname can be fitted in somewhere. \" Jack's \" real name, though, an\nequally common one, had no associations for her in this context. Mrs\nBedford gave one additional fact to Mrs. G. about \" Jack \" which could\nnot be published.\nIn the Journal for December 1947 Mrs G. contributed another instal-\nment to the case, obtained through her own automatic writing :\n\" No\nneed for more tests, but keys is one. Remind her of keys to do with\nholiday.\" This incident was added to the typescripts and was recognised as\napplicable by Miss A. (item 18).\nMrs. Z. knew two families to whom many of the statements could be\napplied, some to one and some to the other. The correspondence is much\nless good, and there seemed little point in asking Mrs Z. to re-annotate\nthe reading for the two families separately.\n^ I was concerned lest Miss A. should be upset when she heard that this section\nof the reading was fictitious. However, she was gracious enough to write :\n\" I\nquite understand that it was a planned experiment, and my mother and I are not\nat all upset to know how it was worked.\"\n\f346\nMrs. Bedford's trance statement\nto Mrs G.\nI. There is another person you\nsaw before he passed over; oval\nface, eyes sunken in, high forehead ;\nyou saw him in bed.\n2. He passed over with a compli-\ncation in his mind about material\npossessions, but he says :\n\" Thank\nGod, I put everything all right.\"\n3. He was slim.\nHe had another disease as well\nas the one he died of. You felt very\nsorry for him.\n4. He speaks of a lady on this\nearth. Tell her he is not dead.\nShe is not to worry about the\nchanges she had in mind. He\nrealises expenses are great, but she\nshould not look too far ahead in\nplanning.\n5. He speaks of her looking\nthrough his papers.\n6. He thanks her for what she\nput in his coffin.\n[Part\nComments of Mrs G. and her friend\nMrs B.\nA friend of mine\u2014a man aged 69\ndied at the house on 9 Aug. 1947.\nI had been nursing him.

It is all the more impressive in that it was virtually a proxy\nsitting ; most of the items were unknown to Mrs G. at the time. The\nsame statement is circulated to four other persons only. Two of them\naccept it as applicable to their own circumstances, one of whom confirms\nalmost every detail.\nI do not wish anything I say to be construed as reflecting on the sincerity\nof Mrs Bedford. It is reasonable to suppose that all professional mediums,\nof varying degrees of psychic ability, unconsciously become familiar with\nthose items which are most readily accepted by sitters ; when psychic\ninspiration fails, or perhaps mixed with genuine items, these \" popular\n\"\nitems will inevitably issue forth. Statements about things placed in the\ncoffin, for example, or loss of keys, must be very safe guesses. Other items\nappear to be out of the ordinary but are not :\n\" He had another disease\nbesides the one he died of.\" Medical friends tell me that this is far from\nuncommon. Some less reputable mediums and clairvoyantes undoubtedly\nmake conscious use of such a practice to earn their livings. But even with\nmediums of the highest quality it is clear that much material may be given\nwhich appears at first sight to be exclusive to the sitter, but of which\nthe evidential value must be discounted because it is in fact not exclusive.\nThe discounting done, the ground is a little clearer for a decision whether\nor not the mediumistic utterances are of supernormal origin.\n\fAYAHUASCA, PEYOTL, YAGfi\nBy a. J. C. Wilson\nThe plants known under the names of ayahuasca, peyotl and yage have\nthree things in common. When consumed in suitable quantity they evoke\nvisual hallucinations of astonishing clarity and brilliance of colour, and\nusually of a pleasing nature. Secondly, because of this property they are\nrevered by the Indians of the regions in which they grow, and have a\ncentral place in their religious ceremonies. Thirdly, and this is the reason\nfor writing of them here, they are supposed to produce clairvoyant, tele-\npathic and precognitive powers in persons consuming them. The use of\npeyotl for this purpose in Mexico is mentioned by several early Spanish\nwriters.^\nDost thou wander about at night, calling upon demons to help thee?\nHast thou drunk peyotl, or given it to others to drink, in order to dis-\ncover secrets, or to discover where stolen or lost articles were.' (Nicolas\nde Leon, circa 1611.)\nIf the consultation is about a lost or stolen article or concerning a\nwoman who has absented herself from her husband, or some similar\nthing, here enters the gift of false prophecy, and the divining that has\nbeen pointed out in the preceding treatises ; the divination is made in\none of two ways, either by means of a trance or by drinking peyote or\nololiuhqui [Datura meteloides] or tobacco to attain this end, or com-\nmanding that another drink it and ordering him to remain under its\nspell ; and in all this goes imphcitly hand in hand the pact with the\ndevil who by means of the said drinks. . . . (Hernando Ruis de Alcaron,\ncirca 1629.)\n[Peyotl] causes those devouring it to be able to foresee and predict\nthings ;\nsuch, for instance, as whether on the following day the enemy\nwill make an attack upon them ; or v, hether the weather will continue\nfavorable ; or to discern who has stolen from them some utensil or\nanything else ; and all other things of like nature which the Chichimeca\nreally believe they have found out. (Francisco Hernandez, circa 1638.)\nSimilar general statements regarding ayahuasca and yage could be given,\nbut it is difficuh to find detailed accounts of specific instances. There is\nlittle or no evidence of the property of inducing paranormal powers that\nreaches the standard required by the Society for Psychical Research for\nprinting as evidential. The two or three instances quoted below do no\nmore than establish a prima facie case for further investigation.\nI. Peyotl\nPeyotl (peyote, mescal,^ muscale) is a small cactus, Echinocacttis\nWilliamsii, growing in arid regions of Mexico and the southern United\n1\nThese quotations are taken from La Barre (22), pp. 23-4. (Bold-face numerals\nrefer to the bibliography on pp. 361-3.)\n^ Mescal is properly a species of agave, from which an alcoholic drmk is brewed.\nThe name has been transferred to a spirit distilled from the drink, then to other\n353\n\f354 A.y.C. Wilson [Part\nStates. Most of the plant is underground ; a carrot with the leaves\nremoved gives some idea of the size of the cactus and the amount of it visible.\nThe exposed surface is covered with small rounded knobs, arranged in\nfairly definite rows and each crowned by a tuft of white hair, and the\ncentral depression is filled with such tufts. The cactus contains several\nalkaloids, chiefly in the portion above ground level, of which mescaline is\nresponsible for the coloured visions, and lophophorine is decidedly poison-\nous. The use of peyotl when taken by mouth is however quite safe, as\nlarge doses provoke vomiting and thus protect the consumer.\nThe Indians of Mexico, such as the Tarahumare, send special expedi-\ntions lasting some weeks to the regions where it grows, the persons taking\npart being subject to severe restrictions, particularly in the matter of food.\nThe plants are ground with water and the liquid is drunk at an all-night\nceremony, dedicated to the god Hikuli, who is believed to be incarnate in\nthe plant.\nAt times the shaman dances, at times his assistants, and women may\ndance either separately or simultaneously with the other men partici-\npants. The bare-footed men are wrapped to the chin in white blankets ; ,\nthe women wear clean skirts and tunics. The clockwise dancing (with\na turn of the body at the shaman's place) consists in a \" peculiar quick,\njumping march, with short steps, the dancers moving forward one after\nanother, on their toes, and making sharp, jerky movements, without,\nhowever, turning round \". The men have deer-hoof sonajas, and the\nrasping and singing are continuous save when the shaman politely\nexcuses himself to the fetish hikuli ; others must also ask permission to\nleave the patio. In the intermittent dancing they beat their mouths\nwith the palm imitating hikuli's talk, or cry \" Hikuli vava! (Hikuli over\nyonder!) \" in shrill falsetto. (22, pp. 34-5).\nSuch ceremonies were formerly confined to the Indians of Mexico, but\nsince about 1880 a religion based on peyotl has spread gradually north and\nwest among the Indians of the United States, and by 1930 had penetrated\ninto Canada (22, 29, 30, 37). Dancing is absent, the ceremonies are\nsimpler, and the dried tops of the cacti (\" mescal buttons \") are chewed and\nswallowed without previous preparation, though \" tea \" may be brewed\nfrom them for the old or ill. It is perhaps worth while to quote a few\nsentences from an appreciation of this religion by two members of the U.S.\nOffice of Indian AflFairs.\nIn the center of the room a sickle or moon-shaped altar is built of\nearth or other material, its open arms, or horns, facing the eastern door.\nIn front of it a ritual fire is kept burning. . . . The roadchief [chief\nofficiant] prays to the Father Peyote, who is the manifest God, just as\nJesus Christ is the Father incarnate. The leader eats the first four\npeyotes and passes the sack around until everyone has also eaten four. . . .\nChristian hymns are often sung in meetings, and the Bible is sometimes\nthings vaguely resembling it in intoxicating action, such as the mescal bean (seed of\nSophora secundiflora), and peyotl. The identification of peyotl with teo-nanacatl, a\npoisonous mushroom also used in Mexico for producing hallucinations, appears to\nbe incorrect (22, pp. 128-30 ; 33 ; 34).\n\f176] Ayahuasca, Peyotl, Yage 355\nseen on the altar with the fetish peyote. ... the moral values of\nChristianity pervade the peyote cult. . . . The Indian actually merges\nthe two religions. He believes that the white man's God and his own are\nthe same, but that each approaches him in his own way or by his own\nroad (30).\nAlthough continually gaining new converts and spreading into new\nregions, the peyotl religion appears to be dying out among the tribes that\nembraced it earliest. La Barre (22, p. 90) mentions some \" precognitive\n\"\nhappenings in such meetings, but unfortunately gives no details. For\nwhat they are worth, I quote them here :\n. . . prophecy in minor matters still occurs via peyote {e.g. the Delaware\ncase in which a serious industrial accident might have been avoided if\nhe had only been able to interpret correctly a warning peyote gave him).\nOld-time Comanche could hear the enemy while still away off when they\nate peyote, and in making raids could discover the whereabouts of\nhorses, etc. White Wolf, again, visioned Charley Seminole's face all\nbloody at a peyote meeting, but was unable to interpret the prophecy ;\nsomewhat later, sure enough, the Seminole accidentally shot himself\nunder the eye.\nPsychologists and other persons of European descent studying the effects\nof peyotl have ordinarily taken about an ounce of the dried plant, or an\nequivalent amount of the alkaloid, say one-fifth of a gram of mescaline\nsulphate. The doses taken by the Indians are two to twenty times as\nlarge. The typical effects of the drug are as follows, though there is much\nindividual variation. There is first nausea, varying in intensity from a\nvague feeling of discomfort up to actual sickness. It can usually be relieved\nby a small quantity of food or drink. One case has been recorded where an\nexcessive dose produced a feeling of imminent death (15). Then there is a\nsharper perception of colour, light and shade, and often a coloured flicker,\ntypically blue, begins to play around the outlines of objects. On closing the\neyes or going into a darkened room coloured visions appear. At first these\nare simply colours without definite outlines, and in one subject, who\nstates that he is normally devoid of the power of visual imagery, they\nhardly passed beyond this stage (16). Usually, however, more or less\ngeometrical patterns appear, such as coloured rain, fields of jewels or\nflowers, interlacing spirals, fretwork, arabesques and the like, usually in\nmotion. It is possible that the background of these designs is furnished by\nthe blood circulation immediately behind the retina (25, 26, 27). These\nare followed by more organic forms, birds' or butterflies' wings, vegetation,\nlandscapes, and in the last stages animal or human forms appear, the latter\nusually in quaint and unfamiliar costumes. The last effect is often a night\nor two of \" absolutely restful insomnia \" (16). When sleep supervenes\ndreams do not appear to be influenced in any way by the drug. The whole\nprocess occupies perhaps eight to twenty hours, during which time hunger,\nthirst, and fatigue are at least partly suppressed. For this reason the\nIndians of Mexico often eat peyotl on long journeys. In some subjects\npeyotl produces disorientation in spatial relations and in the sense of time\n(15, 16, 19).\n\f356 A. y. C. Wilson .\n[Part !\n'\nThe following extracts from first-hand accounts will give some idea of\nthe visions and other mental phenomena. In the first case there were no\nvisions (36) :\nFifteen minutes afterwards I experienced slight dyspnoea accompanied\nby transient headache, which symptoms were rapidly followed by inter-\nmittent tetanoid spasms in the hands and feet, and with a sensation of i\ngeneral bien aise. A sense of egotistical concentration, together with a\ndelightful feeling of irresponsibility toward one's surroundings, sue-' !\nceeded, and lasted, in all, eleven hours. No spectral illusions were\npresent, however ; neither was there any vertigo nor subsequent i\ndrowsiness. The heart was accelerated during the whole of the period, ;\nthe radial pulse varying between 80 and 90. The pupils were unaffected,\nand the digestive powers were undiminished.\nIn the second case coloured visions were seen, but did not develop to\nany great extent. There was however temporal and spatial dislocation (16)\n:\nDuring most of the observations I was bothered with stomachic\naches and pressure in the abdomen, and later with continuous frontal\nand occipital headache. ... I reclined and bandaged the eyes ... a spot\nof white light of low intensity appeared about the center of the horopter\n[field of view]. From then [1.43 p.m.] until 2.58 there were intermittent\ncolor effects. Colors from violet to orange appeared, but seldom red.\nThe colors were rarely of a high degree of saturation. Two spatial\nforms were present . . . one in the form of an arc in the upper half of the\nhoropter, and the other in the form of lines down the center of the horopter. :\nThe colors seemed to be in constant movement. They did not seem to\nbe affected when I opened the eyes inside the blinders, which were\nentirely light-proof. ... At 3.22 the blinders were replaced and the \\\ncolor effects began immediately. During this period colored circles\nappeared, always spinning in a counter-clockwise direction. . . . The\nblinders were then [about 3.54] removed, and the parts of my body, seen\nvisually, seemed to be very far away. I extended my arm and fixated\nthe finger-tips, and then stretched the arm away from me. The hand\nseemed to move a distance of at least ten feet. The stenographer moved\nher head and shoulders back a few inches, and she seemed to be drawing\nback many times that distance. This distortion of space was present for\nboth monocular and binocular vision. . . . Accompanying the distortion\nof space there was also a distortion of time. A given period of time\nseemed very much more extended than normally. Speech seemed slow.\nWalking became a ponderous affair. In walking I felt successively\nsensations from the muscles and joints involved. I became aware at\neach step, for example, of the sensations due to the curling of the toes.\nThe third example illustrates fully developed hallucinations (10) :\nVisions began to appear within twenty-five minutes after ingestion\nof the drug. At first they were simple in pattern and colouring, and\nwere visible only with the eyes shut. Later they became more compli-\ncated ;\nthey no longer comprised geometrical designs, but took on three-\ndimensional form, appearing as figures and scenes, all most brilliantly\n1\n\f176] Ayahuasca, Peyotl, Yage 357\nilluminated and coloured, and all changing with the utmost rapidity. The\nhallucinations now became apparent with the eyes open, though never to\nthe same extent as when the eyes were closed. . . . The first vision con-\nsisted of a black diamond edged with green, followed shortly by circles\nof yellow light against a dark background. Next appeared something\nrecalling a desert scene. \" On the horizon is a setting sun, lighting up the\nlandscape with a dark-red glow. The radiations from the sun are a beauti-\nful combination of red and black. In the foreground are several black\nfigures as though they might be camel riders or trees. The foreground\nnow begins to assume a greenish-yellow colour.\" ... \"A particularly\npicturesque scene : an old-fashioned single span bridge across the upper\nreaches of a river. There are large stones at the sides of the stream and\na narrow navigable channel in the middle. A \\ery restful picture . . . now\nthere is a sort of close-up of the bridge, which is of the old-fashioned type\ncomposed of large blocks of stone . . . while looking at the bridge a pillar\nhas appeared in the centre and transformed it into a double-span bridge.\n. . . The water is quite still and there are sharply delineated shadows in\nvarious tints of blue, green and yellow. . . . The water now starts to\nripple ; it is now drying up and the rocky bed becomes visible. . . . The\nbridge is getting smaller and the rocky bed is gradually becoming trans-\nformed into a stone road in a moorland scene.\"\nSometimes the sensations seem to have diff^ered in kind from those of\neveryday life, as in this last example (the artist in 15) :\nThe first paroxysm.s were the most violent. They would come on\nwith tinglings in the lower limbs, and with the sensation of a nauseous\nand suffocating gas mounting up into my head. Two or three times this\nwas accompanied by a color vision of the gas bursting into flame as it\npassed up my throat. ... At another time my eye seemed to be turning\ninto a vast drop in which millions of minute creatures resembling tad-\npoles were in motion. . . . My right leg suddenly became heavy and\nsolid ; it seemed, indeed, that the whole weight of my body had shifted\ninto one part, about the thigh and knee, and that the rest of my body had\nlost all substantiality. ... At one moment the color, green, acquired a\ntaste in my mouth ; it was sweetish and somewhat metallic ; blue\nagain would have a taste that seemed to recall phosphorus ; ... the\nstrangest of all my color visions . . . began with a feeling that the skin of\nmy face was becoming quite thin and of no stouter consistency than\ntissue paper, and the feeling was suddenly enhanced by a vision of my\nface, paper-like and semitransparent and somewhat reddish in color.\nTo my amazement I saw myself as though I were inside a Chinese\nlantern, looking out through my cheek into the room.\nThe visual phenomena are in most cases visions rather than hallucina-\ntions, as they are seen only in the dark or with closed eyes. Opening the\neyes normally dispels them, though the real objects then seen may be\nperceived with some modification of their normal appearance, or in the\nobserver's mental attitude to them. Occasionally the visions persist with\nopen eyes, taking up a position among or hiding real objects, and they\nwould then rank as genuine hallucinations. The visions do not seem to be\n\f358 A. y. C. Wilson [Part\nreproductions of objects previously seen, and are rarely under volitional\ncontrol, though Indians of the peyotl religion claim that with practice they\ncan alter or suppress entirely their visions (17, 29). In the developed\nstages the source of the visions is presumably the subliminal consciousness\nof the observer ;\nthe remarkable similarity of the visions in the early\nstages\u2014the \" form constants \" of Kluver (20)\u2014supports the suggestion\nof a physiological basis for them (25, 26, 27). If the source of the de-\nveloped visions is in the subliminal, that is if the effect of the drug is to\nweaken the barrier between the conscious and the unconscious, the occa-\nsional occurrence of telepathic phenomena would be explained, as these\nprocesses appear to take place subliminally (i, 5). Rouhier tried the effect\nof an extract of peyotl on six subjects (32), one of whom developed apparent\ntelepathic abilities (31). During the period of his visions he occasionally\nsaw objects thought of by one of the persons, and in a case of apparent\ntelepathic clairvoyance he described in some detail a bedroom with an\nempty bed. The bed should have been occupied, but it was established\nthat it was in fact empty at the time of the vision. Warcollier (5) quotes\nwhat appears to be the percipient's account of the same event. I translate\nthe latter here, in preference to condensing Rouhier's longer version.\nA first vision of the head of Dante and of that of Henri IV having\nsucceeded perfectly, Mme S. wished to try to make me see a little book\nthat she knew was to be found at the home of her cousin, a cousin who\nhad just become a mother and whom she believed to be in bed in her\nroom at the time of our experiments. Almost at once I had a vision of a\nroom of which I described the furniture, the hangings and the bed, but,\ncontrary to what Mme S. believed, I saw this bed empty, and, in spite of\nall her efforts to make me see the person whom she believed to be in bed\nthere, I persisted in depicting it absolutely empty. Among the objects\nfurnishing this room and which she recognized from my descriptions\nwere two objects that astonished her : a bottle of brown perfume in a\ncardboard box and a pot of tooth-paste. ... As for the book that she\nwished me to see, there was no trace in the room.\nThe next day our friends had, if not the answer to the riddle, at\nleast the explanation of the fact. At the time of our experiments, her\ncousin, taking advantage of a moment when she was alone with her\nnurse, had got up for the first time and had sat down in a neighbouring\nroom, carrying away the famous book that I had been unable to find. As\nfor the two unknown bottles, they had just, an hour before, been given\nto the young mother and were as yet unknown to anyone in the family.\nIt would be easy to criticize the conditions under which this experiment\nwas conducted, but it is one of the few that have been recorded in detail.\n2. Ayahuasca\nThere has been considerable confusion between ayahuasca (caapi) and\nyage (caapi-pinima), as their effects are very similar and the two are often\nused in conjunction by the Indians. It seems clear however that there are\ntwo distinct species of plants involved, ayahuasca consisting of Banisteria\nCaapi and related species {B. inehrians, B Riisbyana, etc.) and yage of\nHaemadictyon amazonicum. The latter is distinguished from the former\n\f176] Ayahuasca, Peyotl, Yage 359\nby the blood-red veins of its leaves ;\namong the tribes that call ayahuasca\n(aya-huasca = dead man's vine) caapi (caa-pi = narrow leaf), yage is called\ncaapi-pmvna (painted caapi) in allusion to these veins (\/^4). The active\nconstituent of ayahuasca is the alkaloid hannine, found also in the Russian\nplant Peganum harmala and having some applications in medicine.\n^\nThe various species of ayahuasca are climbing plants (lianas) growing\nin the upper reaches of the Amazon and its tributaries, and also in similar\nhabitats on the western slopes of the Andes. Their height may exceed one\nhundred feet. They are sometimes cultivated by the Indians along the\nborders of their manioc plantations. A preparation of the lower stems is\nused, these being either ground with water or simply boiled until a drink of\nsuitable strength results. Spruce (44) gives the following description of the\nuse of ayahuasca at a \" feast of gifts \" :\nIn November 1852 I was present, by special invitation, at a Dabocuri\nor feast of gifts, held in a malloca or village house called Urubu-coara\n(Turkey-buzzard's nest), above the first falls of the Uaupes ; ... We\nreached the malloca at nightfall, just as the butiitos or sacred trumpets\nbegan to boom lugubriously within the margin of the forest skirting the\nwide space kept open and clear of weeds around the malloca. At that\nsound every female outside makes a rush into the house, before the\nbutiitos emerge on the open, for merely to see one of them would be to\nher a sentence of death. We found about 300 people assembled, and the\ndances at once commenced. . . .\nIn the course of the night the young men partook of caapi five or six\ntimes in the interv als between the dances ; but only a few of them at a\ntime, and very few of them drank of it twice. The cup-bearer\u2014who\nmust be a man, for no woman can touch or taste caapi\u2014starts at a short\nrun from the opposite end of the house, with a small calabash containing\nabout a teacupful of caapi in each hand, muttering \" Mo-mo-mo-mo-\nmo \" as he runs, and gradually sinking down until at last his chin nearly\ntouches his knees, when he reaches out one of the cups to the man who\nstands ready to receive it, and when that is drunk off, then the other\ncup. In two minutes or less the effects begin to be apparent. The\nIndian turns deathly pale, trembles in every limb, and horror is in his\naspect. Suddenly contrary symptoms succeed : he bursts into a\nperspiration, and seems possessed with reckless fury, seizes whatever arms\nare at hand, his murucu, bow and arrows, or cutlass, and rushes to the\ndoorway, where he inflicts violent blows on the ground or the doorposts,\ncalling out all the while :\" Thus would I do to mine enemy (naming him\nby his name) were this he! \" In about ten minutes the excitement has\npassed off, and the Indian grows calm, but appears exhausted. Were he\nat home in his hut he would sleep off the remaining fumes, but now he\nmust shake off his drowsiness by renewing the dance.\n^ Reinberg (43) gives a list of the names among various tribes. Usual synonyms\nfor ayahuasca mclude xaya-huasca, iyona, Ciri-panga, natema, kaxpi, kaapi, kapi,\nnepi, nepe, pinde ; for yag^ they include yaj6, yahe yajen, yaje, iahi, kaapi-pinima,\nkadana-pira, kulikaxpiro, mihi. The identity of yage with Haernadictyon amazoni-\ncurn is not quite certain ; neither Spruce nor Reinberg saw yage in flower, and the\nidentification was based mainly on comparison of the leaves.\n\f360 A. J. C. Wilson [Part\nHere it seems that the plant was used simply for the pleasureable effect\nof the intoxication and the hallucinations, but it is employed in greater\namount and with perhaps the addition of yage or huanto {Datura arboren,\nactive principle presumably hyoscine) by the medicine men when their\nprofessional services are required for the recovery of stolen property,\nforeseeing the approach of the enemy, discovery of unfaithful wives, and\nin other important affairs of primitive life. When so used the waking\nhallucinations are continued into a profound unconsciousness, on\nawakening from, which the medicine man relates and interprets his visions.\nFirst-hand accounts of ayahuasca visions are rare, and there is not the\nprofusion of studies by psychologists that one finds in the case of peyotl.\nTravellers in the regions where it grows are however agreed that the\ninitial hallucinations are pleasant, consisting of such things as butterflies,\nflowers, birds, cities, aerial views, and that these are followed by terrifying\nappearances, such as monsters, jungle beasts, armed opponents. I have\nbeen unable to find an account of a veridical hallucination affecting a\nperson of European descent after its use. Reinberg (43) drank about a\nteacupful of a decoction made by boiling 120 cm. of ayahuasca stem and\nfive or six yage leaves in one and a half litres of water until the quantity was\nreduced to one-quarter litre ; he gives the following description of his\nexperiences :\nThere is some difficulty in swallowing saliva, and I have almost a\nsensation of paralysis of the muscles of the neck and larynx. Before my\neyes shine luminous circles, phosphenes [spots of light], and I see flying\nin a eblouissant sky butterflies belonging to the species collected this\nmorning, which are abundant here. The view is very clear, too clear,\nand it seems to me that I am looking through a little hole pierced in a\ncard. ... I observe all symptoms with a perfect clarity of mind and am\npresent at all happenings as if it were someone else ajfected and this\nsymptom specially impressed me. I have pains in my ears : salivation\nis increased : I have no nausea. But Teofilo had explained to me that\nnausea [mareacion) is the precursor of [paranormal] dreams. . . .\nReinberg then took more of the decoction, and had such violent physical\nsymptoms that he abandoned the experiment and attempted restorative\ntreatment. Spruce was given caapi at the feast described above, but was\noverwhelmed with various other native delicacies before he was able to\nobserve any visual effects.\n3. Yage\nYage also is a climbing plant, but attains a height of only ten to fifteen\nfeet. Its reputation as an inducer of telepathic visions is greater than that\nof either peyotl or ayahuasca, so much so that Zerda Bayon (49) named its\nactive principle telepatina, which has been regularized as telepathine.\nBarriga Villalba (45), who isolated it independently, named it yageine,\nwhich is perhaps a more suitable name for ordinary chemical use. It is\nprepared and used by the Indians in much the same way as ayahuasca, and\nthe visions it induces are similar, though a bluish aureole is said to be\ncharacteristic. Rouhier (48) analysed a native preparation, and found that\nit contained 0.26% of yageine. Yageine is poisonous, doses of about 0.2\n\f176] Ayahuasca, Peyotl, Yage 361\ngram per kilogram of body weight being sufficient to kill guinea pigs. The\nimmediate cause of death is cessation of breathing.\nIt is difficult to form an opinion on the supposed telepathic property of\nyage. Many accounts agree on its reputation among the Indians, but it is\nprobably safe to say that no instances exist of the standard required for\nprinting by the Society as evidential. The only detailed case I have found\nis the following :\nI was induced after considerable hesitation on my part by Colonel\nCustodio Morales, Commandant of the military detachment in the\nIntendencia of the Caqueta, who wished to try the effects of yage upon\nhimself in my hut on the bank of the river Hacha, to give him 15 drops\nof a preparation of yage which at the time I believed to be its active\nprinciple. He took the tincture at night in a jar of water, and in the\nmorning, at reveille, he came to me with the news of the death of his\nfather, who lived in Ibague, and of the illness of his little sister, whom he\nloved, very dearly. All this he declared that he had seen during the\nnight ; no one had arrived who could have communicated such news to\nhim, and the nearest post or telegraph office is at least 15 days' journey\naway. About a month after this strange vision a courier happened to\narrive with letters which announced to him the death of his father and the\nrecovery of his sister from a serious illness. It should be mentioned that\nColonel Morales is a man of eminently nervous constitution, that he was\nvery ill-fed, and that he is highly intelligent.\nThis story is quoted from a letter from Dr. Rafael Zerda Bayon in the\nTimes (49) ; a version differing only in minor details is given by Warcollier\n(5) from a South American source. Warcollier was unable to obtain\nconfirmation direct from Colonel Morales. The incident is suggestive,\nbut many similar occurrences with corroboration from the percipient or\nothers conversant with the circumstances would be needed before it could\nbe admitted that yage deserves its telepathic reputation.\nSELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\nThere are very many publications dealing directly or incidentally with\nthese plants, and an exhaustive bibliography would be prohibitively long.\nThe following list contains (i) relevant publications consulted in detail in\npreparing this note, and (ii) a few publications that appear from abstracts\nor references to be important, but which for some reason could not be\nconsulted. The latter are distinguished by printing the author's name in\nitalics. The fullest bibliography on peyotl, extending to some fourteen\npages, is given by La Barre (22).\nA. General Works\n1.
