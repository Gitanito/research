Men, in a word^ who ftudied Na-\nture, look'd up into, and made Obfervations from,\nthe Motions of the Stars and other heavenly Bo-\ndies, and who, as *tis \/aid in the Scriptures^ under-\nHood the Signs of the Times, the Face of the Hea-\nvens, and the Influences of the Superior Luminaries\nthere > who fearched into the Arcana of Nature, and\nwere Mafters of perhaps a little experimental Philo-\nfophy > I fay a little, for Reaibns which I fhall re-\npeat prefently.\nIt was no Impropriety in Speech to call fuch as\niht^Qwife Men at that time, tho' perhaps the utmoft\nof their Knowledge might arrive to no more than\nwhat we would now juftly call fuperficial. Be-\ncaufe at that time the Knowledge of Nature was\nvery green and young in the World j and the Phi-\nlofopher of thofe times, if he was to be rated by the\nRules Men are pleafed to judge by at this time, would\nbe fomething like our Learned Friend S'lv^ho. J\u2014\nwhofc\n\fof M A G I C K.\nwhofe particular Honour it was to be a DoSor\namong Fools, and a Fool among Do6tors.\nTo thefe Magicians Men went on the feveral Oc-\ncafions hinted as above for the Solution of doubt-\nful ^eflionss to be refolved and diredcd in difficult\nand intricate Undertakings-^ to be advifed in things\nof Moment 5 and thefe were therefore called Sages\nfirft, and for a long time 5 and afterwards Magi^\nfrom the greatnefs of their Wifdom. Hence the\nwife Statefmen to whom the Government of the\nMedian Interregnum was committed were called\nMagi\\ as wife Men to whom alone it was fit to\nintruft fo important an Article as that of the Go-\nvernment of an Empire.\nThus afterwards in the Ifraelites times, their\nivife Men were called by another but very fignifi-\ncant Name or Term {viz.) Seers, a Word after-\nwards held in fuch Veneration, that they thought\nfit to beilow it upon their Prophets^ who alfo were\ncalled Seers^ tho' afterwards they obtained a fupe-\nrior Title, namely that of Man of God. But before\nthat I fay the wifer Men were called Seers j and this is\nmoft exprefly fignified in that eminent Text,\nI Sam. ix. p. where 'tis faid that before time they\nufcd to fay when they wanted to enquire of God,\nthat is to enquire about any thing difficult, come and\nlet us go to the Seer, that is to the Magician^ the 'wife\nMan^ xhtPropbet^ov what elfeyou pleafeto call him.\nIt is plain from the fame Text alfo that they\nfometimes went to thofe People called Seers\nupon meaner Enquiries j for they took it for grant-\ned that thofe Seers dealt in all fecret Matters 5 Thus\nAha-ziah fent to Baal-zebub when he was fick, to\nknow if he fhould live or dye, z Kings i. 2, 2. and\nfo the King of Syria's Captains told their Mafter,\nthat EliJJja the Prophet told the King of Ifrael\nwhat he did in his Bed-chamber, z Kings vi. 12.\nAnd to bring it down to a meaner Cafe flill >\nB i evea\n\fA SYSTEM\neven when Saul wanted but to find his Father^s\nloft Afles or Cattle, his Servant faid to him, let\nus go and enquire of the S e e R j and fo they did, and\nfound News of them.\nLikewife it appears by the fame Text, that thofe\nSeers^ or Prophets^ or Magi^ made an Employment\nof it, that it was their Bufinefs to tell Men of their\nloft Goods, direct them in their Way, foretel of\ntheir Health, and the likej and that they made a\nLively hood or Trade of it 3 therefore when SauVs\nServant propofed to him to go to the Seer, Saul\nmade a Difficulty of it becaufe he had nothing to\ngive him > as if he fhould have faid, I have no Money in\nmy Pocket, and not aLoaf of Brcadto give the cun-\nning Man or Seer, and how ftiould 1 expert that\nhe fhould give me any Account of my Cattle for\nnothing? Then when the Servant told him he had\na fourth-part of a Shckle of Silver in his Purfc,\n(which by the way was not above feven Pence half-\npenny, or thereabouts) Saul was mighty glad, re-\nfolving to give the low-priz'd Magician or Prophet\nthat vaft Fee, to tell him what was become of his\nFather's Afles.\nIt feems the Lawyers Fees were not fo high in thofe\nDays as they have been fincci for if he had not had\nthat Piece of Silver, perhaps about as big as an En-\nglijh Groat, Ifay^ if he had not had that, a couple\nof half- penny Barly Loaves it feems would have\nbeen as good, and have done as wellj thofe\nLoaves being not ufually bigger than our Half-\npenny, or at beft than our Penny Wheaten brown\nBread Loaves are now.\nAgain you find when Benhadad King of Da-\nTnafcus fent to Elijha the Prophet to know if he\nfhould live or dye, he fent the Prophet a Prefent,\nforty Camels loaden with all the good things of\nDamafcus^ z Kings viii. p. A large Fee ! But 'tis to\nbe fuppofed the Gift fent, was not fuited to the\nProphet\n\fof M A G I C K,\nProphet fo much as to the Sender j he gave as a\nKingi but ftill we find the Seers were fuppos'd\nto make the Gain their Bufinefs.\nThat it was the fame thing with the Magi before\nthat, we have no reafon to doubt, tho' we have no\nParticular in Story relating to that part. But we\nfind thofe Southfayers^ Magicians^ and wife Aden,,\nwho were lent for by Pharaoh King of Egypt to\ninterpret his Dream, were to have receiv'd great\nRewards, if they had given Satisfadion to the\nKing 5 and Jofeph we fee did receive great Rewards,\nas well as Honour, on that Account.\nAgain afterwards in the Cafe of Nebuchadnez-\nzar's Dream, there is a fufficient Teftimony that\nthofe wife Men^ Aftrologers^ Magicians^ &c. were\neftefmed not to be Wizards and Dealers with the\nDevil, but only (as I have explain'd the Word a-\nbove) meer Philofophers^ or wife Men, Men of Lear-\nning and Knowledge, Men of Science and of Skill in\nthe works of Nature 5 for when the King demanded\nof them to tell himnot only the Interpretation of the\nDream,but the Dream it felf,and threaten'd them with\nDeath in cafe they fiiil'd to perform ir, they expo-\nllulate with the King upon the unreafonablenefs of\nthe Propofal, as a thing that no King in the World\nwould expedl from them, and that was not in the\npower of Nature to perform\n:\nAs if they had faid, does your Majefty think we deal\nwith the Devil^ thatyoufiOuldexpeUfuch a Piece ofWork\na\u00a7 this from us ? \/\/ is not in the Power of any^ or of all\nthe wife Men^ or Philofophers, in the Worlds and\ntherefore it cannot he imagined we jhould do it \\ hut\nlet the King tell us the Dream^ and then we will interpret\nit, and thafs as much as Man can do.\n'Tis plain from hence, not only that the Magi\nor Magicians in thofe Days were not really Conju-\nrers and Dealers with the Devil, but that they were\nyjaderftood to be what we may call Scholars^ Men\nB 3\nof\n\fA SYSTEM\nof Learning, of Wifdom, and of a fuperlor Un-\nderftanding : So when the King calls for Daniel to\nprefer him, it is faid he did it becaufe an excellent\nSpirit was found in him-, and in another Place 'tis\nfaid, that the Spirit of the Holy Gods was in him-y\nwhereas at the fanae time 'tis certain that the King\nefteemed him as one of the Magicians -,\nnay, and he\nwas fet over them, as the Chief and Governor of\nall the reft. Certainly then they did not take\nthofe Magicians to be what we have fince under-\nftood of ours, {viz) Dealers with the Devil, and\nSorcerers, fuch as ought to be punifhed for having\nor ufing unlawful Arts, and Pradices with evil Spi-\nrits and the like.\nHad this been the common Opinion of them,\nthey would have been treated after another man-\nner, both then and in after- Ages-, for not only a-\nmong the Jews^ but in other Nations, fuch as we\ncall now Magicians were punifhcd as Criminals.\nBut to go back a little to Originals, and to fetch\nup Knowledge from the Fountain: Man born igno-\nrant arrives to very little Knowledge but what comes\nby one of thefe two Channels.\nFirfiy Long Experience, Study and Application.\nSecondly^TQ2iQ\\iing andlnftruftion from thofe that\nwent before.\nI ihall infift only upon the laft, and that parti-\ncularly for the fake of what was Antediluvean. The\nmoft early Knowledge which Mankind obtain'd in\nthofe Days, is fuppos'd to be by Teaching imme-\ndiately from Heaven i for Example. Adam and\nEve''% Mouths were open'd at the fame time with\ntheir Eyes, and they could fpeak, and knew what\nLanguage to fpeak, as foon as they were made. But\n'tis moft certain alfo, that all the fpeaking World\niince Adam and Eve learnt it fucceflively from\nthem, by mere Imitation of Sounds, teaching of\nParents and Nurfes, and the like.\nAfter\n\fof M A G I C K.\nAfter Adam^ his Pofterity having learnt to fpeak\nimmediately from him, and fo to converfe with\none another, a confummate acquired Knowledge in\nfeveral other things quickly followed j particular\nArts and Sciences were either taught by Infpira-\ntion from Heaven, or attained by the exquifite Ca-\npacities of their Minds 5 One having a Genius to\nthis, Another to that kind of Knowledge j as one\nto Mufic, another to working in and finding out\nMetals and Minerals in the Earth, then meking5\nrefining, cafting, and other Operations and Im-\nprovements, as Knowledge came in by the Door\nof Experiment.\nAdam's Pofterity (T mean his particular Houfe or\nFamily) learnt to fpeak more immediately from\nhim and Eve their Mother by meer imitation\nof Sounds, as we do to this day from one an-\nother.\nBut having thus obtained Speech from their im-\nmediate Parents, all other acquired Knowledge men-\ntioned above, fuch as of their Improvement of\nCulture, Difcoveries in Nature, and the like^ feem'd\nto be the Confequence, i. Of a vehement and in-\nflamed Defire after Knowledge, planted in their\nMinds by Nature it felfj an inquiring Difpoii-\ntionj being fenfiblc of a vaft Treafure hidden in\nNature apt for Difcovery, and which as it were\nwaited only for the Search, m order to open it felf\nto their View for the general Good. z. A vaft\ncapacious Underftanding fitted for that Search, and\nwhich we have reafon to believe the Antediluvean\nFathers were more than ordinarily furnifhed with,\nguiding them dire6lly to the Search after, and into\nall the Arcana of Nature, with a Readinefs and\nAccuracy fo pointed, as if they had been before-\nhand inftrufted what to fearch for, how to fearch\nfor it, and where to find it. 3. A fecret In-\nfpiration from Heaven, filling them with, or at\nB 4 Icaft\n\f8 A S Y S T E M\nleaft direfting them to the Knowledge of things in\na more than ordinary manner.\nN. B. We cannot doubt but were there now to ap-\npear a Man perfedly untaught, not having con-\nverft at all with Men taught and infl:ru6ted before\nhim, and yet fhould have a Treafure of fuch\nKnowledge in his Mind, exerting it felf in\ni\\6tion to fuch a degree as was ordinary to\nthe Patriarchs of the Antediluvean Age, wc\nfhould prefently give him up for a Magician in\nthe groflefl Acceptation of the Word, and fay\nin fhortthat he deals with the De'vil\nBut be it fo or not, and let the confummate\nKnowledge of thofe Patriarchs, come which way\nit will, and be as great as it will, or as you will\nfuppofc it to be, this is certain, it died with themj\n'twas all drown'd in the Flood, the Poft-dilwvean\nAge inherited very little of itj or if they did, it\nwas drown'd again in the Flood of Vice and Wick-\nednefs, which almoft as foon overfpread the World,\nas the People did the Plains of Shinaa?'^ and much\nfooner than they fpread the reft of the Earth with\ntheir Pofterity, however faft they multiplied.\nNor do I wrong the People of thofe firft Ages\nafter the Flood in the leaft, when I fay they feem'd to\nhave loft all that fund of Knowledge, all that capa-\ncious Underftanding, and all that facred Infpiration,\nwhich their Predeceffbrs the Antediluveans were\nMafters of 5 I need go no further for an Ex*\nample of it than the building of Babel. For was\nit poflible that any thing fo abfurd and ridiculous\ncould have entred into the Thoughts of Men, if\nthey had not been funk into an unexpreffibic Dege-\nneracy as to Senfe, a meer Stupidity of Underftan-\nding? To fay nothing of their having loft all Pre-\ntence 10 Infpiration \\ fo far were they from any Share\nof facred Light in it, that they could not be faid to\nhave\n\fof M A G I C K.\nhave aftcd with common Senfe. Blefs us ! to build\naHoufe to reach up to Heaven! or as we may with\nmore Propriety exprefs it, to build a Stair-cafe to\ngo up into Heaven by 5 and that in cafe of an-\nother Flood too, which adds to the Madnefs of the\ndefign many ways.\n1. They had certainly no Notion of Heaven it\nfclfj not to fpeak of religious Notions of Heaven,\nthey muft be entirely dark and Itupid as to thePhi-\nlofophyofit; The immenfc Diftance, the differing\nRegions, the Alteration of things in their natural\nCircumllanccs and Situation by the Way, or in the\nPaffage.\n2. They had no Underftanding of their own\nConflitution, or at leafl: they mult have very grofs\nand abfurd Conceptions about it 5 as particularly of\ntheir breathing and fubfifting in the Regions above\nthe Atmofphere, and in the pure unmix'd jEtber^\n(or what eJfe it ihould be called) which they who\nmounted up to fuch Height would be fure to meet\nwith, and in which they might as eallly conceive\nan ImpofTibility of breathing, as they could con-\nceive of the Impoffibility of living without Breath.\n^. They muft have had no Notion of the Na-\nture of the Flood it felfj as that of the Power,\nForce, and Weight of the Waters, when moving in\nfuch a collected Body 5 how unable any thing they\ncould build would be to refift the Force, and not\nbe prefently blown up and driven away by the\nStream.\n4. They muft be utterly ignorant of the Nature\nof the Earth on which their Building ftood ;\nhow no Foundation could be laid fo deep or\nfo firm in ir, but what by the Violence of fuch an\nimmenfe Ocean of Water would be loofen'd and\noverwhelm'd, and the Fabrick by confequence be\nbrought dowui the Earth which upheld it being\nwafh'd away.\nf. They\n\fA SYSTEM\nf. They muft be wholly ignorant of what our\nlearned Theory Men infilt to have been the Caufes\nof the Deluge, namely an Abforption or breaking in\nof the Surface of that Earth which was before a\nknown Cavity or Hollow fiU'd up with Water, in-\nto which the Earth fell with a Violence equal to\nthe Fall of the highcft: Mountain that could be\nfuppofed to fall into the lowefl Subterranean Deep 5\nand in which cafe the Height, and Strength, and\nMagnitude of their Building could only ferve to\nmake its Fall more violent, more certain, and more\nterrible.\nAll thefe things, and many more, which Nature,\nhad they been capable of confulting it, would have\ndiftated to them, they muft bcperfe<9:ly ignorant ofj\notherwife they could never, with a Delibera-\ntion and long confuking one another, as the Rela-\ntion of the Story implies, have gone about fo ridi-\nculous a piece of Work as that of Bahel^ than\nwhich nothing attempted by the grofleft and dull-\neft Fancies on Earth was ever more abominably\nfoolifh and ignorant.\nWere thele the Pofterity of the wife Antedilu-\nvean Age! whofe Minds were infpircd from Hea-\nven, and whofe Underftandings were fo eminently\nlarge and capacious, whofe Genius led them to the\ninventing the moft ufeful Arts, and to exalt them\nin queft of the nobleft parts of Science, (fuch as\nMufick in particular j) and to make the moft rcfin'd\nExperiments, fuch as the melting, mixing, fepara-\nting, and refining of Metals j and which was ftill\nas much as all the reft, the finding thofe Metals in\nthe Oar, as the Iron, the Copper, the Silver, and\nthe Gold, of which we find they had a compleat\nKnowledge, and carried it on no doubt to the moft\nufeful Experiments? Thus JabaUnd Juhal for Ex-\nample, the Sons oi Lamech^ who feverally apply-\ning themfelves to ufeful Arts, became Inftruftors\nof\n\fof M A G I C K. II\nof their Pofterity in Culture of the Earth, Huf-\nbandry, breeding of Cattle, {^c. Others we find were\nProficients in Philofophy, and the ftudy of Nature -^\nfor the Do61:rine of Sounds is one of the niceft\nParts of philofophical Study, and we find them im-\nmediately Mafters of Mufick, and inventing and\ninftruding others in making the Inftruments of Mu-\nfick; and particularly thofe Niceft and moft Dif-\nficult of all the reft, the Harp, and the Organ,\nthat is to fay Wind-Mufick, which is Vocal; and\nMufick by Fihration^ which we call Inftrumentalj\nlikewife Tuhal-Cain their Brother, who was the\nfirft Artificer, of whom we may fay that he was\na true natural Mechanick, and the firft and beft\nTinker in the World.\nIn the room of this capacious Underftanding,\nand this inquiring and applying Temper in thofe\nAges, behold a ftupid Generation rifen up in Suc-\ncefi^onj ftript as naked of the natural Glories of\ntheir Anceftors, as the Earth was of its natural\nFruitfulnefs after the Curfe in Paradife-, and inftead\nof applying themfelves to ufcful Arts, and to the\nacquiring of Knowledge, grown as indolent as they\nwere ignorant, having, like Solomon's Fool, no de-\nlight in Underftanding.\nInftead of qualifying themfelves to inftruft their\nPofterity, we fee no marks of Wifdom left behind\nthem fit for Imitation; nothing that could recom-\nmend them to their Children for any thing but a Race\nof ,brutiih, unpolifh'd, unfinifh'd Creatures, that\nneither undcrftood Heaven or Earth, themfelves, or\nany thing about them ; that feem'd qualified for\nncithing but meerly, as the reft of the Brutal World\nwere, to propagate their Kind, and overfpread the\nEarth.\nNor in their Multiplying their Species did they\nfeem to promife any thing but to people the\nW^orld with a Race of Fools, as ignorant and for-\nf did\n\fIX A S r S T E M\ndid as their Antediluvean Progenitors had been out-\nrageouily wicked > a Race that threatened to make\nHeaven as iick of them for their Folly, as it was\nof thofe that went before them for their Corrup-\ntions and abominable Vices 5 and that might be as\nlikely to have brought a Deluge upon them for\ntheir obftinate untractable Ignorance, as the other\nhad been for their Rebellion and Loofenefs, had\nnot God's Pr. mife not to deftroy the World any\nmore, been their Security.\nNor indeed were they lefs corrupt, their Capa^\ncities confider^d^ than the old World, whofe flagrant\nCrimes had involved them in a general Dc{lru61:ion;\nand if they fell ihort in any thing, it was for\nwant of Wit, not for want of Wickednefs.\nThis appears in all their fubiequent Condu6t,\nfrom the firft peopling of the World after Noahy\nto that foolifh Bahel- Building- Age I fpeak of: la\nthe old World we found, that, at leaft for a time,\nMen began to call on the Name of the Lord; and\nthe Patriarchs of that Age were famous for Piety,\nof whom 'tis faid, as particularly of Enoch^ that he\nwalked with God', an emphatic fignificantExpreflion,\nwhich our learned Commentators have fpenta great\ndeal of Time in expatiating upon and explain-\ning. The Scripture again exprefles this walking\nwith God to be an Ad of Faith, and quotes it,\nHeh. xi. 'ver. f. as a glorious Example of fuch Faith\nas was rewarded with an immediate Tranflation of\nthe Perfon into Heaven. He was not^ for GOD took\nhim 5 and from which the moft exquifitely and ac-\ncompliihtly whimfical Mr. Jfgill form'd his new\nSyftem of going the neareft way (Home) to Hea-\n*vm by the farthcft way about, a fiery Chariot in-\nftead of dying j as if the former were not a Change\nas well as the latter^ and as if Heaven had not al-\nready made the befl Choice for us: But tho' he fuf-\nfcr'd Martyrdom for his Scheme (having been ex-\npeird\n\fof M A G I C K. 13\npeird the Parliament of two Kingdoms for it) vvc\ndo not find he has yet had the Benefit of his Pro-\njeft, fo we muft wait till he is pleafed to make the\nExperiment.\nBut to return to the Antedlluveans : The old World,\nI fay^ as wicked as they were, had fome fhadow of\nGood in them, and for fome Years, nay fome hun-\ndreds of Years, they maintain'd the Charader of\nthe Sons of God^ before they were debauched by\nthe Daughters of Men j that is to fay, before they\nblended the Race with the corrupt Seed of Cainy\nand mingled Blood with Idolaters. Where, by the\nway, we have an accurate Defcription of the Times,\nI mean in thofe early Days, of the Raccj 'tis\nevident 'twas jufb then as 'tis now, the Ladies were\nthe Devils of the Age j the Beauties, the Toalls, the\nfine Faces were the Baits 5 the Hell lay concealed\nin the Smiles of the charming Sex, They were the\nMagicians^ taking the Word in its prefent Accepta-\ntion and its grofleft Senfe: There lay the Witch-\ncraft, and its Force was fo irrefiftible, that it drew\nin even the Sons of God, juft, in a word, as ic\ndoes now, and of which I ihall have Occafion to\nfpeak again at large as we go on. \u2014 In the mean\ntime, I defcend with the Story to the next Gene-\nration.\nThe Antedlluveans might have fomething of Re-\nligion in them, however fatally mix'd with Crime >\nbut as for the new Good-for-nothing Race, we\nhardly read of any thing that ever was to be found\namong them that may be called valuable, from Noah\nhimfeif downward ; and even Noah himfelf, we all\nknow, fell into the Debaucheries of Wine, and ifyou\nwill believe Tradition, continued in it a hundred\nYears. Now from him, and from his immediate\nRace, Narur^^ feem'd prepared for the utmofl De-\ngeneracy, for thev fell into all manner of Crimes,\nnay into the worlt Crimes firfti for they did not\nbe-\n\f,4 A S r S T E M\nbegin low and fin gradually, but immediately after\nthe Drunkennefs of Noah himfelf, his Pofteriry de-\ngenerated into Idolatry^ or rather return'd to it, for\nfeme think, and that not without Probability e-\nnough, that Noah's Sons were Idolaters before the\nFlood, and were faved in the ^rk^ fuch^was the Will\nof God^ mecrly for being the Pofterity or Progeny\nof a righteous Father 5 if fo, then they only returned\nto the Idolatry which they had been pra6tis'd in\nbefore.\nBut he that as it willj 'tis certain that the Pofte-\nrity of Noah fell immediately into Idolatry, and that\nall his wife Dilates which he gave to his Chil-\ndren, which for fo many Ages were preferved by\noral Tradu^ioH, and were called the Precepts of Noah\n^\nhad no fufficient EfFeft upon them to prevent that\nhated Sin of Idolatry, no not even while he was\nalive.\nIt is worth obferving here indeed, were it not\ntoo grave for your Reading, how t^tdiMzWy Noah by\nthe horrid Defedion of his own Morals in that One\nA6t o^ Drunkennefs^ I fay how efFedlually he {hut\nthe Door againft the Force of all his Own future In-\nftruftions : He was till then indeed a Preacher of\nRighteoufnefs, and had been fo to the Antediluvean\nWorld for near fix hundred Years j but after that,\nhe might preach indeed if he would, but what Re-\ngard would he obtain, when the debauch 'd Inftruftor\nhad expos'd himfelf by his Drunkennefs to the Ri-\ndicule inftead of the Reverence of his Pofterity,\nand when the drunken Monitor by his own Pra-\nGice had render'd his Inftru6bions fruitlefs and ridi-\nculous ?\nHow juftly might they bid him hold his Tongue,\nand go and reform his Life, before he pretended to\ninftrud them ? bid him firft learn the Precepts he\ntaught, and ftiow them by his Example what it\nwas he would have them pradife? How might they\nup*\n\fof M A G 1 C K. ly\nupbraid him with exhorting them to be fober,\nwhile he went drunk to bed ? exliorting them to\nModeity and Virtue, while he appeared in the\nmoft fcandalous manner, lying drunk in his Tent,\nand his Nakcdnefs expos'd to the Banter and im-\npious Jefl: of his Grandfon Ham?\nHow muft it cover his Face withBluflies, to find\nhe had difhonoured by his Example the Do6trine\nof Sobriety which he had preached to his Children,\nwho were thereby brought to mock him, rather\nthan to liilen to him, and to make Ballads of him,\nrather than copy his Precept for their Imitation?\nBut I fay this is a Subje6t too folemn for the\nAge, and you will prcfcntly tell me I am going to\nwrite a Comment upon the ninth Chapter of Ge^\nnefis. So I leave it for you to confider of, and re-\nturn to the Chronology of early Wickednefs in the\nPoft-diluvean World.\nNoah being thus difabled, by his own falling into\nCrime, from inftrufting his Pofterity, what was the\nConfequence? he liv'd to fee them run headlong\ninto that worfl: of all Crimes, Idolatry^ and the\nWorfliip of GOD funk as it were out of the\nWorld, even in his own time, and before his Eyes.\nThis is evident from Ahraham^ whom the Scripture\nacknowledges to have been not an Idolater only,\nbut even bred up in Idolatry while he lived in Ms-\nfopotamia > and 'tis certain Abraham was born above\nfifty Years before Noah died ; So that Noah liv'd\nto fee his Pofterity degenerated into Idolatry, not\nall his Preaching or Pradice being able to pre-\nvent it.\nHaving thus feen all the Wickednefs of the old\nWorld revived in its new Inhabitants, without the\nWit and Capacities which they had before > and the\nRace being thus entirely degenerated, we muft be-\ngin all our hiftorical Account of them with taking\nthem juft as we find them, and that will bring us\ndiredly to the Subje\u00a3b I propofe. The\n\f4 A S r S T E M\nThe Race being thus, as I have faid, ftript naked\nof the Beauties of their Anceftors, whether in Mat-\nters of Senfe and Underftanding, or in Matters of\nPiety and Religion, and running on into all man-\nner of foolifhand fimple as well as wicked ExcefTes,\nit is not at all wonderful if when any particular Per-\nfon appeared more than ordinary knowing, or but\na Lover of and Searcher after Knowledge and\nWifdom, fuch a Perfon was honoured in a more\nthan ordinary manner, was reverenced as an extra-\nordinary Man, exalted in the common Efteem\nwhen alive, and perhaps placed among the Stars\nafter his Death > that he who fhined in their Efteem\nwhen living, might be fuppofed to be made immor-\ntal at his Death, and to be exalted to fhine in a\nhigher Orbit.\nHence it became a vulgar Error among the firft\nAges, but was riveted fo faft in the Minds of Men,\nthat nothing could perfwade them not to believe\nit, [yiz) that the Stars were all the tranfparent\nbright Souls of their wife Anceftors, who for their\nVirtue and Wifdom were exalted by the immortal\nPowers to a Station of Glory, and were made to\nfhine in that manner for the farther enlightning\nthe World, to whom they had been fo beneficent\nwhen they were here j and from hence it came at laft\nthat all their great Men, and efpecially their Kings,\nwere thus reverenced and exalted, whether they were\ngood Men or no.\nIt could not be, but that in Procefs of Time, as\nthe World grew populous, tho' they had none of\nthe rare Parts and exalted Underftandings of the\nAntediluvean Patriarchs, yet there would be fome\nMen of a more refined Genius, and of more\ncapacious Souls than others. Surely the World\nwould not be all Fools, or not all equally and alike\nfo5 nor can I doubt but that while the grofs of the\nPeople went about that hare-brain'd prepofterous\npiece\n\fof M A G I C K. 17\nj^iede of Work which wc call Bahel^ there were\nfome wifer Heads who tho' they might not care to\noppofe themfelves to the popular Humour, or per-\nhaps to their Refentment, and did not ridicule and\nmock the Undertaking, yet looked on it with a\ndifferent View, and entertain'd wifer Notions of\nThings, and Gonfequently (when by the Confu*\nfions which afterwards happened among the Buil-\nders on Account of their Speech, they were oblig'd\nto give over their Work) might take the Liberty\nto expoftulate with them upon the Weaknefs of the\nDefign, and convince them afterwards that it was\nan unlikely impra6licable thing; Or perhaps thofe\nMen had calmly argued that Part with them be-\nfore, and had, as far as the times would bear it,\ndeclared their Sentiments about it 5 thefe Men\nwould certainly obtain the Charadler of wife Men\nupon this Occafion, and be valued by them as fuch\nupon all fubfequent Events.\nAs upon the Confufion of Languages the fevcral\nFamilies who undcrftood one anothers Speech kcpc\ntogether, fo 'tis very probable they did not feparate\nlingly, every one running his own way, but by\nFamilies and Tribes, or by Nations, as their Speech\nwas or was not underftood by one another 5 and\nthis was dire<5bed by Providence no doubt, for it is\nfaid in theText, God fcatter'd them upon the Face,\nor over the Face, of the whole Earth.\nIt is not unlikely but that when they left off\nBuilding, and found they were not able to purfuc\nthe Defign, with that ImpofHbility they began\nalfo to fee into the Folly and Abfurdity of the\nUndertaking > and began more and more every day\nto reflect upon their Stupidity in going about it ^\nthat being withal afliamed of the Work, they\nwere aihamed of the Place too, and wenc\nevery Man, or friheof Men at \/f^y?, their own Way,\nto get as far out of the fight of it as they could : I\nC granc\n\fA SYSTEM\ngrant indeed that this is but my Conjefture, but\nI think 'tis a very jiift Conjedturc, and 'tis made on\nSuppolition that all wife Men look back with Re-\ngret upon thofc Adbions of their Lives which they\nhave been drawn into, and in which they have\nreafon to fee thetnfelves miftaken. \u2014 In Ihort, as\nno Man loves to fee himfelf a Fool, and if he has\ndone a foolifh thing, does not care to have the Re-\nmembrance of it always in his Viewj fo generally\ni^ he cannot get the Objc6t removed and put out\nof his fight, he will remove himfelf from it, if he\ncan.\nUpon this foot I cannot doubt, but that all the\nPeople quitted the Plain of Sbinaar as faft as they\ncould, and run away from the hated Monument of\ntheir Shame > we would have done fo our felves,\n^nd I capnot doubt, I fay, but they did fo too.\nSuppofe then the People to be upon their March,\nand going to the feveral Quarters of the World, whi-\ntjT.e^' they were direded to fettle; and let that he\nwh^re you and Sir Walter Raleigh pleafe; for that\nlearned Author following Scripture-light has really\ni?iaifhaird them, and laid out their feveral Routs as\n^xadily and authenticly as if he had been Com-\nmiflary- General, and had gone before to provide\nthem Quarters.\nWherever, I fay, thefe feveral Nations went, and\nin what Country foever they fettled and fixed their\nAbode, tho' the Government and Monarchy of each\nDivifion was Patriarchal and Hereditary, yet wefhall\nfind upon feveral Occafions afterward, that they had\namong them many particular Men famous for their\nWifdom and Knowledge, and for their Search into\nthe Secrets of Nature, whofe confummate Wifdoin\nby degrees not only obtained for them a more th^\nordinary Reverence among the People; but, infliort,\nbrought the People to lubjeft thepfelves to their\nGovernment, and m^ke feme of them Kings.\nThus\n\fof M A G I C K. i^\nThus Cadmus^ a Phoenician born, becjjme King of\nThebes in Greece^ by having obtained the Fame of a\nwife Man, and one who dedicated himfclf to the\ncommon Good of Mankind 5 So Prometheus obtain'd\nthe Government of a Part o^ Armenia^ and Jtlas the\nlikeiny^r\/V^5 and thus feveral others, by their Wis-\ndom and earned Search after Knowledge, obtain'd\nthe Empire and Government of thofe Countries\nwhere their Wifdom was fo confpicuous. But pray\ntake this with you as you go, that tho\/e Days are\nover^ that Wifdom crowns no Man Now, except it\nbe with the Rage and Mahce of Enemies, with Po-\nverty and Infult.\nProhitas laudaiur \u00a3s? Alget,\nHonefty fhall be prais'd and ftarv'd ; Wifdom and\nKnowledge are Marks for the Men of Power to ihooc\nat 5 to be High and Great, is to be Wife and Good.\nHe that is Rich is Wife^\nAnd all Men learned Poverty defftfe.\nBut this is but an Excurfion, I come back re-\nproved: The Magi were not always Kings or Em-\nperorsj the Wife Men and the Southfayers^ the\nMagicians and Aflrologers (who by the way were all\nbut onefortof People} were often times inmeanCir-\"^\ncumftances as to Money, even in thofe graver Daysj\nthey a\u00a3tedfor thepublick Good indeed, but it was in\nConjun\u00a3tion with iheir own Intereft too, they had\ntheir Rewards for Southfaying and Divining 5\nand when the King of Syria, asked his Servants to\ngo to Elijha the Prophet to enquire for him about\nhis Health, he bad them take a Prcfent in their\nHand for the Man of God.\nI cannot indeed fay how high priz'd things went\nin thofe Days, and whether Wifdom wa\u00ab iigt un-\nC % der-\n\fA SYSTEM\nder-ratcd then, as it is nowj whether there waJ\ndue Encouragement given for the Search, or whe^ ,\nther Wit went threadbare and in Rags, as it does\nfincej Authors are not agreed upon it indeed, and\nit may be hard to bfing them to a Point: It is true,\nlater and more modern Philofophers learned to de-\nfpife Money, and Solon preferred Wifdom and a\nretired Life to the Wealth o^Croefus-y but in the\nmore early Times of the World, the Knowledge\nof Nature and the Study of Wifdom as it wenC\nthen, feemed to be a communicative Good, which\ntherefore as they that reaped the Benefit of it ought\nto pay for and did fo, fo their wife Men grew\n(in time) mercenary and mean, as in other Places.\nThis leads me to the Times when the primitive\nWildom of thofe early Days beginning, as I faid,\nto be more common, and that the Magi had com-\nmunicated much of their Knowledge to the com-\nmon People. Thofe then who ftill pretended to b^\nfomething beyond the reft of the World, were\nobliged to go higher in their Studies, and enquire\ninto Nature, view the Afpeft of the Heavens, cal-\nculate the Motions of the Stars, and efpecially dwell\nupon their Influences in human Affairs, which is\niince called Aftrology.\nBy this Study they obtained the Name of Souths\nfayers and jlftrolcgers^ added to that of Magicians^\nwhich they had before : and on the foot of thefe\nStudies they interpreted Dreams, explain'd good\nand bad Omens, foretold Events, and perhaps play'd\nfome Leger-de-main Tricks too^ to impofe upon\nthe World, as their worthy Succeflbrs do to this\nDay \\ and in a word, 'tis likely they did all thofe\nthings then, which thefe People do now, of whom\nwe fay with more Freedom perhaps than Truth,\nthat they deal with the Devil.\nNot that tbofe Fe pie were charged, at lead\nnot yet, with any criminal Conyerfation with the\nold\n\fof M A Q 1 C K. XI\nold Gentleman \u2022, nor, if I underlland how the Cafe\nHood with Satan at that time, had he any man-\nner of Occafion for them, but did his Bufinefs quite\nanother wayj for the Devil had Altars and Temples\nof Jbis own, was another kind of a King in thofc\nDays than he has appeared to be fince : T ii e n he\ngave Audience in form of a Deity, and faw himfelf\nworshipped like a God almoft throughout the whole\nWorld: Here, under the Name o\u00a3 Baal-y there, Mo^\nloch'y here in one manner, there in another : Nor\nhad the GOD of Heaven One Temple in the\nWorld, when the Devil had a great many fcatter'd\nhere and there, almoft in every Nation. I aflurc\nyou, however modern Writers think fit to repre-\nicnt him, he fcorn*d in thofe days to go about hke\na poor ihabby Out-at-heels Devil, as he has done\nfince, and may perhaps do now. No, He appeared\nin State, and as he ufurped divine Honours, fo he\nmade a Figure fuitable to his Ufurpation, and had\nhis Shrines and his Votaries, his Priefts and his\nPlaces of Worfiiip, in whatever Shapes or Places he\npleas'd to be worfliipp'd in: Thus as Dagon he had\na Houfe of folemn Worfhip at JJJjdod, i Sam. v. 2.\nand as Baalzehuh at Ekron, and the like.\nNow as the Devil had thus the Government of\nthe whole World in his own Hand, and that he was\nalmoft in the very Letter of ic the God of the JVorld^\nfo he had no need at that time to employ fecrec\nAgents, and work by way of Familiars or private\nIntelligence, as he does fince > nor, to do tlr\" ho^\nneft Men Juftice, had any of the Southfayers and\nMagicians, and thofe which were at fir ft called their\nwife Men, any Converfation with the Devil at all,\nno, or with any of his Works, they carried on no\nBufinefs for him.\nBut they were Men of Thought, or if you pleafe.\nMen of deeper thinking than the ordinary fore :\nThey ftudied the Sciences, and enquired into ufeful\nC } things,\n\fA SYSTEM\nthings,^ fearched the Works of Nature and Provi-\ndence, ftudied the Meaning and End of things, the\nCaufes and Events, and confequently weye able to\nfee farther into the ordinary Courfc and Caufes\nboth of things about them, and things above them,\nthan other Men.\nIn the ftudy of Aftronomy, they foon found the\nfecret Influences of the Stars upon the Surface of\nthe Earth, upon Plants and Animals, nay, upon\nboth Man and Bead : as for Example, How the\nGrowth and Virtues of earthly Bodies were guided\nand govern'd by the heavenly, and how even the\nEvents of the greateft moment on Earth often-\ntimes obey*d the Force of thofe heavenly Bodies 5\ntheir Conjunctions, Oppofitions, near or remote\nPofitions, Revolutions and Appearances j and ac-\ncordingly they were capable of making fuch pro-\nbable Conjedures of things not yet come to pafs,\nas were amazing and furprizing to the reft of the\nWorld J and by which they took them, cither for\nMen fiird with facred Knowledge, and that thofe\nthings were communicated to them immediately\nfrom Heaven 5 or that, however they got it, they\nhad a prophetick Knowledge of v\/hat ihould come\nto pafs, and could foretel Events even before the\napparent Caufes were ordinarily known.\nThis gave the common People an extraordinary\nVeneration for the Perfons of thofe Magicians and\nijuife Men^ as they had an awful Notion of their\nexceeding Wifdom and Knowledge. Thus Nebu-\nchadnezzar^ after he had exalted the Prophet Daniel\nto be the chief of his wife Men^ floopt to him with\na kind of Reverence, and begins his Addrefs not\nlike that of a Tyrant, the Terror of the World, as\nhe at that time really was, but as One that had an^\nAwe upon his Mind of the great Refpcd he ought\nto fhow to a Perfon divinely infpir'd as Daniel was.\nSee the Text Dan, iv, p. O Bekefhazzar, Mafier\nof\n\fof MAGIC K. 13\nof the Magicians, hecaufe I know th^t the Spirit of\nthe holy Gods is in thee^ See- \u2014 And fo in the\n8ch Verfe of the fame Chapter. Jt lafi Daniel came\nin before me^ whofe Name is Beltelliazzar, after the\nName of my Go d, and in whom is the Spirit of the\nholy Gods.\nThefe were the Magicians of the firft Ages of\nthe World, and. fuch was the Opinion which the\nPeople had of them in thofedaysj not that they were\nConjurers, or running Men^ or fuch fort of People\nas we now call them; but were Men, who\nat that time knew more than the ordinary rate of\nKnowledge inftrudted others to knowj and were\nendued from Heaven with extraordinary Degrees\nof VVifdom above other Men. Nor was the Re-\nfpe6t paid to them equal, but more or lefs in de-\ngree, according to the particular Degrees of fa-\ncrcd Infpiration which they were fuppofed to have.\nThus in the Cafe of the Prophet Daniel (as above)\nthe King treats him not as a Magician only, nor as\nthe Chief of the Magicians only, but as a Man fiird\nwith higher degrees of Wifdom and Knowledge\nthan any, nay than all the reftof theM7^\/V\/^;2Jof the\nAge put together, as appears Dan.iv. 18. Now\nthouy O Beltefhazzar, declare the Interpretaft on thereof^\n(that is of the Dream) for as much as all the wife\nMen of my Kingdom are not able to make known\nunto me the Interpretation, hut thou art ahle^ for\nthe Spirit of the holy Gods is in thee.\nThis is Hill further explain'd in the next Chap-\nter, and in the Tranfa6tions of the next Reign: I\nfay it is farther and fully explain'd to my Purpofe,\n{viz.) as to what was the People's Opinion of thefe\nMagicians., as well as their King. The Story is very\n\u2022particular.

Nay, they had a thoufand\nYears before them ftill, in which a moderate Com-\npetence of acquired Knowledge would keep up\ntheir Characters j what Courfe was taken afterwards\nwe fhall fee by and by.\nTo fum it up then in few Words j a Magician in\nthe firft Ages of the World was nothing more or\nlefs than a Man of Learning 5 only vou muft take\nthis with you as you go, that by ihzWovd Learning\nis ro be underftood not a Man of Letters and Books^\nfor the World knew little of either in the firft\nDays of thofe Acquirements. Nay, we have rea-\nfon to be afTur'd, that the Knowledge of Letters\nwas not arrived in the World, at the time when\nPharaoh fummon'd the wife Men, and the South-\nfayers, and Magicians to interpret his Dream 5 and\nas they had no Letters, they had no Books j and\ntherefore when 'cis faid that Mofei was learned in\naU\n\fso A SYSTEM\nall the Wifdom of the jEgyptians^ it muft be tin-\nderftood of oral Learning, Wifdom convey'd to him\nby Obfervation, or Inftru6bion, or Infpiration, as\nafterwards he really received it from Heaven.\nThe Magicians, I fay, were Men of Learning,\nthat is to fay Men of Study, Men of Obfervation,\nbufy in the fearch after Knowledge > and if we will\ntake Pains to enquire into it, we fhall find their\nObfervations chiefly refpedcd the Motions of the\nheavenly Bodies, the Afpefts and Influences of the\nPlanets and fix*d Stars j and confidcring that they\nwere abfolutely without the help of Inftruments\nand Glafles to make their Obfervaiions by, and\nwithout Books, by which to communicate the\nKnowledge of one Age, or of one Perfon,'to an-\nother; I fay, conddcring thefe things were want-\ning, *tis a wonderful thing that they arriv'd to\nfuch a Degree of agronomical Knowledge as thev\ndid.\nOthers ftudled the Knowledge of Nature, in the\nConilitution and Contexture of human Bodies; the\nOriginals, the Progrefs, and the caufes of Difeafes\nand Diftempcrs, both in Men and Women; and\nalfo the phyfical or medicinal Virtue of Drugs and\nPlants, for Cure and Eafe of thofe Difeafes; the\nqualities of the feveral Herbs and Trees, and Pro-\ndu61:ions of the Earth ; and as in thefe things they made\ndaily Difcoveries in Nature, which the World was\ntill then ignorant of, and by v\/hich they performed\nfurprizing Cures, and delivered the diftrefled People\nin divers Maladies, they were on that Account, and\ndefcrvedly too, had in great Eftcem, were reve-\nrenced, and even worfhip'd by the People.\nI could give many Examples in Hiftory from the\nmod ancient Times, when their Phyficians and A-\nftronomers were, after their Deceafe, rank'd among\ntheir Gods, and doubtlefs were had in a profound\nVeneration, while they were living.\nIn\n\fof M A G I C k: 31\nIn a word, Science and ufcful Knowledge being\nyoung in the World, thofe Men who gave them-\nfelves up to the firfl Searches after thofe things,\nwere thought worthy of the greatcft Honours,\nand were had in the greatefl Elleem \u2022, indeed they\nvery well deferv'd of Mankind, fincc they gave\nfuch noble Tertimonies of their being devoted to\nthe Publick good. Thus Prometheus^ who is faid\nto be chain'd down to Mount Caucafus^ with a\nVulture preying upon his Bowels, the Subftance\nor Meaning of which was no more than this: That\nhe gave himfelf fo entirely up to the Study of A-\nflronomy, and to fearch after the Knowledge of\nthe heavenly Motions, that the eager Dedre after\nthe Knowledge of them gnaw'd into his very\nVitals, confum'd his Natural Strength, and\nproved fatal to his Health 5 and that this was upon\nMount Caucafus^ intimated only, that he chofc a\nhigh Hill, or a Summit among thofe Moun-\ntains, where he ufed to lye on his Back whole\nNights together, to make his Obfervations more\ncxa6tly of the revolving Motions of the Stars, till\nhe contrafted Diftempers by the Colds and Damps\nof the Air 3 fo that he was as it were chained down\nto thofe Mountains, till the Difeafes he contra6led\ncat out his very Bowels.\nThis is that Prometheus^ who for his exquifitc\nKnowledge, is feign'd by the Poets to have firft\nform'd Man, that is to fay, form'd the Model of a\nMan by the help of Water and Earth; and then\ndole Fire from the Sun to animate the Model, and\nto give him Life and Motion.\nThe Meaning of which is no more than this,\nthat by his Wifdom he inftruded and formed the\nMinds of Men in true Notions and right Know-\nIcge of the moft fublime Objeds.\nProme-\n\f3\u00bb A S Y S T E M\nPrometheus firft^ as ancient Authors fay\n^\nFirfi made the Model of a Man in Clay j\nFormed all the beauteous Parts^ and when he*d done\nStole 'vital Heat from the prolific Sun,\nAnd here, by the way, the firfi: Atheifi:s, the E-\npkureans and others, who ihew'd their mighty\nWillingnefs to deny a Fiift Caufe, a Being Prior^\nand therefore Superior^ to all Beings, would make\nMan to be the Author of his own Form and Life j\nand that Prometheus having thus form'd the Mo-\ndel, and by borrowing Fire from the Sun, given it\nLife, the new-form'd Creatures had ever fince\ncommunicated that Life by Generation.

In the firft Ages of the World, the Know-\nledge of Magick was the Wifdom of Nature j and\nnothing but Ignorance brought Men to proftitute\nthemfelves to the Devil for the encreafe of their\nUnderftandings.\nAnd this indeed is the way by which Magick^\nand the Knowledge of the moft excellent things, has\nbeen abus'd in the World} when Men feeking be-\nyond themfelves for Knowledge, and ignorant of\nthe way to increafe true Knowledge, have been\nimpos'd upon to make ufe of wicked and diabo-\nlical Methods to obtain it; the Devil not only\nreadily concurring to affift them, but openly ading\nwith them by Concert, to encourage the Dc-\nlufion.\nHence the weakeft and moft impotent of all\nCapacities, meer Fools excepted, have been found\nfufficient to make Tools for the Devil j who hard-\nening them for his own Work, trains them up to\nhis Hand, with fuch an unwearied Diligence, that\nnothing\n\fof M A G 1 C K, 17\nnothing can prevent their improving in his Ser-\nvice.\nThus while Magick is the Wifdom of Nature,\nand the Magicians of thofe Ages were the wifefl\nand beft of Menj the Magicians of our times, and\nof this new kind, improve from nothing, begin\nwith the vileft of Ignorance, and proceed to the\nvilell of Wickednefs, till they come to be the mod\nDiabolical Creatures in the World.\nMagick being therefore nothing in thofe Times,\nbut, as 1 have faid, a degree of ufeful Knowledge,\nand the Magicians being a Race of honcft ftudious\nMen, fcarching after Wifdom, and bleft with greater\nShares of it, than the ordinary Race of Men were\narriv'd to> we muft look farther, and come\ndown lower into Time, for the prcfent vulgar Ac-\nceptation of the Word : In which Inquiry, it\nwill not be fufficienc to jump at once from the\nbeginning of things to the prefent times, and from\nwhat the Magicians were in Egypt and Chaldea^ to\nwhat they are now in a Chrillian Age: But we\nmuft a little enquire into the Gradations of the\nChange, and fee by what feveral Progreffions of\nArt the ufeful Magicians of thofe Ages have come\non, from meer Philofophy, to all the Extraordi-\nnaries of Myftery, Cunning, Trick, Cheat, Star-\ngazing, Fortune-telling, Conjuring, Witchcraft,\nand the Devil > and if this be not an Enquiry,\nboth profitable and diverting, I muft be miftaken\nin my Subject, or in my Readers.

We do not find them\nbuilding any more Babels^ or entertaining them-\nfelves with fuch grofs Notions any more.\nAs they travelPd abroad they learned Experience j\nthey faw farther into Nature, and into the Reafon\nof Things : inftead of building Ladders and Babels\nto reach up to Heaven, and keep them from\ndrowning, they foon learnt to build Cities to keep\nout their Enemies, and Ships to fail upon the\nWater > they baffled the Fears of another Deluge\nnot by their Faith, that God would not drown the\nWorld again, fo much as by the belief of this\nWhymfy, that feeing they could fwim in Ships and\nBoats, he could not do it 5 or that knowing they\ncould live upon the Water, they might feem not\nto care whether he did or no.\nIn this travelling Circumftancc they grew in\nKnowledge, as I fay, and at leafi fome of them\nbeing of a brighter Genius than others, advanced\nbeyond their Neighbours in Wifdom and Under-\nHanding both fpeculative and pradical j and thefe,\nas they gain'd every Day- more Knowledge, even by\nknowing, fo that Knowledge gain'd them infinite\nApplaufe and Efteem among the People.\n^\nHence every afpiring Genius among them get-\nting the ftart of the reft, either in real or affected\nKnowledge of things, and thereby gaining Ad-\nmirers and Dependents, took little differing Routs\nin\n\f4 M A G 1 C K. if\nin their Wanderings j and wherever they thought\nfit to plant and fettle, they built Houfes, calPd it\na City, and the Leader made himfelf be caird their\nparticular King.\nThis petty Royalty, as it was rais'd upon the\nfoot of Chance, rather than Blood, and upon the\nmean Circumftance of a bold afpiring Head, which\na fmall ihare of Brains above its Neighbours gave\na Title to, fo it feem'd to fubfill on the foot of the\nfame Chance 5 thofe Kings being as eafily, and as\noften depos'd, as they were either over-power'd\nby their Neighbours, or as any Decay and Dei^G^t\nof the bright Part that rais'd them, caus'd them to\nfink in the Opinion of their Subjeds, and gave the\nKing of the next City a better Place in their Favour,\n. Yet this Diminutive Rank of Soveraignty re-\nmain'd many Ages in the Worlds and we find, not\nonly in Abraham's Time, when the five Cities of\nthe Lake or Valle)', where Sodom flood, had five\nKings over rhemj and afterwards in 7^^o^'s time, the\nCity of Sichem had a King over it 5 but even at the\ncoming of the Ifradites into Canaan^ almoft every^\nCity had its Kingj and we have a great deal of\nropm to judge, that thefe Kings did not derive\nfrom a patriarchal Succe{?ion, for then there would\nhave been many thoufands of Kings more than there\nwere 5 but from the exalted Merit of the LTndcr-\nitandings and Genius of fuch and fuch a Perlon,\nwhom the People thought fit to admire and follow,\nand confequently fubjea themiclves to : and we have\nabundance of Examples in Hiftory to prove, that\nthis was the pradice of thofe firil Ages. But this is\na dry Study, and the Search after their Names wj'jtd\nbe as needlefs, as the Lill, when obtain'd, would be\ntedious to read J fo I leave it, and go on.\nThe reafon of my naming this Parr, is not to\n(how the Veneration the moft early Ages of the\nWorld had iorWifdom and Virtue > ^o\\'^ God knows^\nthefe Magi^ tho' they had the Merit oF fome\nD 4 Knowledge\n\fA SYSTEM\nKnowledge above the reft, yet we do not find\nthey had a much greater Share of Virtue than o-\nthcr People: But even as we find it now, the moft\nknowing Men arc not the beft Menj even fo it\nwas then, every wife Man, much lefs every great\nMan, was not a good Man: and as in our Age it\nmay be fear'd, we have more Clergy than Chri-\nlliansj fo there were in thofe Days more Sages\nthan Saints : till at lalt their wife Men turn'd\nwhimfical, their Kings Madmen, their Southfayers\nmeer Conjurers, and their Magicians Devils : Of all\nwhich 1 fhall give a farther Account prefently.\nI'll fuppofe now, that the Magicians of thofe\nAges were, as I have defcrib'd them in the Chapter\nbefore, nothing but Men fam'd for extraordinary\nKnowledges meer Aftrologers , Philofophers,\nMen of Study, and the like. You will next fee\nhow thofe Men frequently rais'd their Fortunes by\ntheir Wifdom, or rather by the Opinion which\nthe ignorant World had of their Wifdom and Ca-\npacities.\nZoYoafter was a famous Magician^ in the Senlc\nwhich I have already given of the word. Hiftory\ntells us, he was a great Aftrologer, and foretold\nthings by his Art, which were to comej that by\nhis wonderful Predi6i:ions, he obtained fach a Vene-\nration among the People, that the Baclrians ador'd\nhim as a Man fent down from the Gods, or if you like\nit as well in Scripture Terms, as a Man of GOD-,\nand by this mighty Opinion which they had of\nhim, he obtained the Empire o^ the Baclrians. This\nmuft be at the time when Ninus was Monarch\nof ^Jfyria-y for he was afterwards conquer'd, dif-\npo(refs*d of his Dominions, and flain by Semiramisj\nthat warlike Widow Queen of AJfyria,\nThey report that he foretold he fhould be flain\nby Lightning, or by the Fire of Heaven > and that\nhe told the JJJyrians^ that if they could find his\nAihes, they fhould carefully preferve them, for\nthat\n\fof M A G I C K. 41\nthat their Empire fhould continue no longer thaa\nwhile his Afhes fliould remain in Being j that after-\nward it fell out accordingly, that he was kilPd by\nLightning, and that the jiffyrians did fo prefervc\nhis Afhes, but that they were afterwards taken from\nthem by the Perjians^ who overthrew their Empire.\nN. B. All this is fumm'd up thus in fadj That\nZoroafier left behind him wholfomc Rules of\nVirtue and good Government, which as long\nas the AJfyrians kept in Memory, and wor-\nthily followed, they were profperous, as he\nforetold them they would be 5 but when af-\nterwards they degenerated into Vice, and\nceafed to obey the Rules which he had fee\nthem, they fell into Divifions and Fa6bions,\nCivil Wars and Devaftations, which at length\nended in the Ruin of their Empire.\nCadmus^ mention'd before, was a Phoenician^ but\nwent from his own Country and fettled in Greece^\nwhere, as they fay, he built the City of 'ThebeSj\nand was made King of it, in confequence of the\nPerformance, and in Veneration of his Learning,\nhaving brought lixteen Letters of the Greek Alpha-\nbet among ihemj not that he invented thofe Let-\nters, tho' he has the Fame of it to this Day : the\nLetters were thefe 5 ^, \/3, 7, c\/^, s, ;, r), x, X, v, 0, tt,\n^, <T, T, u} the other four 0, f, 9, ;^, they tell us\nwere afterwards fupply'd by Palamcdes during the\nSiege of \"Troy.\nBut the Moral of the Story is this, that Cadmus\ncame from Phoenicia into Greece^ where by his\nLearning he inllru6ted the People, civiliz'd and\npolifh'd their Manners, and taught them the\nKnowldge of Letters 5 direded them to build\nHoufes, and inhabit together in Towns and Vil-\nlages, which they then called Citicsj and, in a\nword, introduc'd among them Difcipline and good\nGovern-\n\fA s r s r E M\nGovernment: in Recompence for which they\nmade him cheir King, and call'd their firll Town\n^hebeSn in \u2022{onour of Cadmus^ who was originally\nof the Gj' at Egyptian Thebes^ a City much more\nancient than the Nation of the Grecians,\nJthj (aifo mention'd before) was an African^\nconfpicuous for his Excellence in all human Wif-\ndom and Knowledge j by this he was raifed to fuch\na height in the Affe^ion of the People, that they\nmade him King of Mauritania in the Northern\nPart of Afric He was one of the molt learned\nMagicians of the Time, and by his Knowledge in\nthe Motions of the Stars, and his excellent Judg-\nment in the good Government of Nations, he is\nfeign'd by the ncjents to carry the World upon\nhisShouldersi that is to fay, his Precepts of Govern-\nmenr f jpported the Nations, and prefcrv'd Order\nand DifcipHne in the World 5 and for this he was,\nas he well defer- 'd, chofen by the People of Afric\nto be their King.\nI have done with my Examples of wife Men bcr\ning made Kings, efpecially being made fo for their\nWifdom too J and indeed to what purpofe {hould\nI go on with the Account? 'tis not pretended the\nExample fhould move the World in this Age, or\nin the next : the World at prefent has no great\noccafion for more wife Kings than they have > and\nbefides, as there is a right wife Generation nfing\nup to fupply the Place of Power, as fail as Nature\nwears off the Incumbents, and we fee no Danger of\nwanting a fuitable Succeflion > fo I leave that part\nof the Subjeft, and fliall talk of another Clafs.\nThe Magicians or wife Men being, as I have thus\ndefcrib'd, Men of Worth, and juftly valued in the\nWorld, let us fee how long they held it, and how\nthey loft that Chara6ter.\nThe firft ftcp which I meet with, which lefTcns\ntheir Figure in my Account, was when the Magi\nor\n\fof M A G I C K. 4j\nor mfe Men were called in to fupport the Govern-\nment of the Per\/tan Empire : And here they fhew'd\nindeed, that Wifdom is not the only Qualification of\na Prince 5 that there is another thing requifire, which\ntho' it is but trifling indeed among the Modern?,\nwas an EfTcntial among the Ancients, who found,\nthat to make a good Governor, it v>^as requifite,\nthat he fhould not only be a Wife Man, but an\nHoneft Man 3 and in defeft of this Qualification^\nthe Perfians cut the Throats of ail the Magi^ to\nwhom they had committed the Government of\nthe Country j for tho' they were all Philofophei*s,\nand wife Men, yet, as Fame hands it down to us,\nthey did not find one honed Man among them.\nThefe Magi are called by fome Prlefts, by\nothers Philofophers, by others i\\ftrologcrs> it is\ncertain they foretold things to come, or at leaft\nmade the People believe foj as in the Cafe of the\nQueen of Perfia^ Mother of King Sapores^ The\nPsrftans it fecms were in great Perplexity for wane\nof a King, (there were no Pretenders at that time to\nput in their Claim) a thing which very feldom\nhappens in our times: The Nobility being aflem-\nbled, in order to confider of a Nomination, the\nMagi fent them word that they fhould not pro-\nceed, for that the Queen Dowager was with Child,\nand would bring forth a Prince, who ftould be a\nmighty King, and do great things for the Honour\nof his Country.\nUpon this their Confultations broke ofi\\, and with\ngrear Joy they fent for the Queen, and laying the\nCro vn upon her Belly, they folemnly crown'd the\nEmbrio, gave it the Title of King, and falutcd it\nKing by the Name of Sap07'^ or Sapores'y all which\ncame to pafs: And yet I may fay all this might\ncome to pais* andnogre^.t ma'tcruwing ro the Pro-\nphetic KiVi'dedgeot che Magi; for the Queen, loth\nto have a King chofcn tqofoon, before ihc knew how\nic\n\f44 A S r S T E M\nit was with her, might venture to fay {he was with\nChild 5 or at leaft get the Pricfts, the Magi^\nto fay fo for her, and leave the reft all to Fatej for\nif it had not prov'd fo, no body was injur'd, and\nit would only have been faid that the Magi were\nxniftaken.\nBut we are, if you pleafe, to fuppofc, that as I\nfaid, this did not laft long 5 the low-priz'd Learn-\ning of the Magicians anfwer'd very well, while the\nWorld was ignorant in Proportion j but as the\nWorld encreafcd in People, and as Years went\nover their Heads, Knowledge had its Gradations\ntoo, and tho' it muft be confefs'd it was at a very flow\nRate, yet fome advances they did make 3 and as\nPrinces feverally were lovers of Learning, fo they\nencouraged Men of Learning too, and their Num-\nbers cncereas'd, as well as their Knowledge.\nAs the common People became more knowing\nand intelligent, fo it behov'd the Magicians to advance\ntheir Studies, and feek farther into the more fub-\nlime Parts oF Learning, to prefervc the Diftancc\nthey ftood in, from the lower Clafs of their Coun-\ntrymen, and to maintain the R'efped and Venera-\ntion which as I faid the People had for themj if\nthey had not done this, they had foon been upon\nfl Level with the reft of Mankind} the Rabble\nhad been their Equals in Wifdom, and they had\nloft themfelves in the fuperior Station of Magici*\nans^ which they enjoy'd before.\nThis put them prefently upon fearching farther\nand farther into the Arcana of Nature, purfuing\nthe higheft and moft elevated Studies, with the\nutmoft Diligence and Application j advancing\nfrom one thing to another, ftill to keep up the\nFigure and Charader of 'wife Men which they had\nbefore 5 that is to fay, being ftill as many degrees\nabove the common fort, however the common fort\nmight be improv'd in Knowledge, as they were be-\nfore. No?\n\fcf M A G I C K.\n4j\nNor was this difficult to doj for as Knowledge\nwas then, and even is ftill, an unexhaufted Mine and\nScore-houfe of unvaluable Treafure, and which ftill\nthe deeper ;it is dug into, difcovers more and more\nRiches, and an infinite variety of Rarities and cu-\nrious things, as well natural as artificial j fo the\nfarther thefe Men of Application fearch'd into the\nArcana, or concealed Treafures of Wifdom j and\nthe farther and greater Experiments they made, the\nmore they found the Search anfwer their utmoft\nAmbition 5 the more they knew, the more they\ndifcover'd yet to know> and all their Enquiries\nmade good the modern Diftich made upon a like\nSubje6b.\nWhafs yet difco'ver\\l^ only ferves to Jhow\nHow little's known^ to ivhat there's left to know.\nThis was not only an Encouragement to the\nwife Men of the Ages we fpeak of, to go on in their\nStudies, and in their making new Difcovcries in\nthe hidden and moft retir'd parts of Nature j but\nit fhew'd that they were ftill able to maintain the\nCharafters they bore in the World, and to make good\nthe Diftin6lion which was formely made between\nthem and the common People 5 fo that they ftill\npafs'd for Magicians^ wife Men^ and Aftrologers, as\nthey really at laft were 5 and for Men qualify'd to in-\nftru\u00a3b the ignorant World in a fuperior Knowledge.\nTake them then in this new Situation, that is to\nf^iy, pufhing on in the commendable fearch after\nWifdom and Knowledge, till, as Solomom fays, they\ndug for it as for hid 'Treafures-, yet the common\nPeople followed them clofe at their Heels; the Na-\ntions grew wifer and wifer, as well as the Magi%\ntill in ihort Art began to fail, or rather the Num-\nbers of the Men of Art began to encreafej that fo\nwife Men were not fuch Rariues, or fo high-priz'd\n4 as\n\fA s r S T t M\nas tliey had been, and grew daily lefs and lefs iti\nthe ordinary Rate and Elteem of the World.\nThus in iliort, the *wife Men^ and the improving\nWorld, feem'd hke Men running a Race, in the\npurfuit after Knowledge 5 the Magi or Southfaycrs,-\nor what you pleafe to call them, had gotten the\nStart, and were a great way a- head, a great way\nbefore the reft, but the People follow'd and ad-\nvanc'd at a great Rate.\nAnd this brings me down to the Point.\nThe Men of Wit and Learning being hard put\nto it in their new Difcoveries, had but three ways\nto preferve the Dignity of their FrofefHon, and\nkeep up their Credit as wife Mine^ that is as Fhilo-\nfophcrs, Magi^ and the like.\n1\n.\nThe firft was to purfue vigoroufly the Study\nof Philofophy, that is to fay of Nature, the feveral\nBranches of Aftronomy^ Aflrology^ Geometry^ and the\nlike.\n2. The fecond was to puiTi into the Study of Artj\nthat is to fay Experimental Philofophy.\n9. The laft was the Study of Reafon {viz?} Natu-\nral Homage, and the Worftiip of the Gods.\nIn the firft of thefe they went on with great\nSuccefsj nor were they to be follow'd by the com-\nmon People, whofe Underftandings could never\ncome up to any uncommon degrees of Science, or\nindeed to make any Pretcnfions to it 5 and therefore\nthofe that apply'd to this Study, kept up their\nCredit longer than any of the reft.\nThus the three wife Men of the Eaft are faid to\ncome into Judaa from a far Country, by obferving\nan unufual and furprizing Phenomenon, (wzja Star\nat Noon-day, moving in a particular Orbit, and\npointing to them in a very particular Manner, by\nwhich they were as it feems direded to follow it,\nin order to make an extraordinary Difcovery of\nfomc great Birth, and of fome wonderful Prince,\nwhom\n\fof M A G I C K. 47\nwhom therefore they ought to come and pay Ho-\nmage to. Some Authors tell us, thefe three w\/fe Men^\nor Magi^ were three of the Pofterity of ^h ''h'lmy\nby Keturah hi^ !aft Wifc^ that they dwelt in Ara^\nbia Felix^ and that chey had it revealed co them,\nthat rhey fliould fee this Siar, and chat they fhould\nbe gu'aed by it to fee the Great MeJ\/iah^ who was\nto come into the World to unite th'* Pollerity of\nAbraham^ and to z\\y.ikj)^ them in one Kingdom,\nwhich ihould rule over the whole World. But t\ntake this as it is, viz, a Chimney-corner Tale, fit\nfor a Legend, and not capable of any manner of\nImprovement.\nBut thus far 'tfs to my Purpofe, namely, that the\nCredit of the \"wife Men of the Eaft was not yec\nquite funk in the World j that they maintain'd a\nCorrefpondence with the Scars j that they por'd\nupon the heavenly Motions, and knew more of that\nkind than all that ever went before them.\nAs the Aftronomers, and Star-gazing Magi kept\nup the Dignity of their Characters, and out-did all\nthe reft of Mankind in thofe Ages > fo the fecond\nfort too apply'd themfelves co the Study of\nlower Life, obferving the Mechanifm of Nature,\nand introducing the helps of Art, even to perform\nthings furpnfing. Among thefe, fome ftudied the\nMicrocofm of human Bodies, and fcarcht both\nDiftcmper and Medicin 5 and thefe (that is to fay,\nthe Phyficians, and Naturalifts,) obiain'd a noble\nAlcendant in the Efteem of the Vulgar, being able\nby the Knowledge of Drugs and Plants, and their\nVertues, to apply proper Remedies in Cafes of the\ngreateft Diftrefs and Diiafter j and this indeed could\nnot but obtain for them a fix'd and large Efteem\nin the Minds of the People, whom on fo many Oc-\ncafions they rcliev'd. Thus the firft fearch'd into\nthe Curiofiues of Nature, the fecond into the Arc\nof Phyfick.\nBuc\n\f48 A S T S T E M\nBut the third were a very particular kind indeed?\nand thcfe apply'd themfelves to the Arcana of things\nDivim-y and at this Door came in all the wicked\nthings, which have fince, with fo much Juftice too^\ngiven a black ChaFa6ter to the very Name of a\nMagician 'y for under the flicker of Religion, the\nworltand moft Diabolical things were pradtis'dj and\nin a few Ages more, we find that all the Magi\"\ncians were Priefts in Mgypt^ or according to fome,\nall the Priefts were Magicians., Some have ofFcr'd at\ndrawing a Paralel from this to our times, and in\nfome Senfe it may be true, but in others doubtful.\nFor if by Magicians we are to underftand Philofo-\nphcrs, and wife Men, I fliall never be brought to\nacknowledge that all our Priefts are Magicians^ for\n1 abhor all Slander. But to go back to the Cafe\nas it is before me, certain it is, that the imfe Men\nfinding, as above, that they muft take new Mea-\nfures, that they muft have Recourfe to fome new\nArt, if they would keep up the Reputation of their\nWifdom J I fay, finding it thus, they apply'd them-\nfelves to three forts of Study.\nThe firft was to innocent Art, fecret and cun->\nning Contrivances to delude the Sight-, this we\ncall Juggling, Legerdemain, or philofophical Delu-\nfion, fuch as I ihall mention in its Place j but this\nwould go but a little way.\nA fecond fort, as above, apply'd to religious Frauds,\nand fet up for Coeleftial Dclufions, mixing their\nMagical Performances with religious Rites ^ fo de-\nceiving the People with the Opinion of San61:ity,\nand with the Belief that they had the Affiftance of\nthe Gods.\nIn Nomine Domini incipit omne malum.\nThefe laftftudied indeed Divinity, fuch as it was>\nand how unhappily did they purfuc the Myfteries\nthey\n\fof M A G I C K. 49\nthey profefs'd ! for firft we find they invoked the\nGods, and not finding that would do, they chang'd\nHands and invoked the Devil.\nFleUere ft ne^ueo fuperos^ Acheronta movebo.\nFrom hence it is that I fuppofe our wife De-\nfcribers of the Magick of the Ancients tell us\nthere were three Torts of Magick ^ i. Natural,\nwhich confifted of the Parts already mentioned,\nnamely, the Knowledge of the Stars, the Motions\nof the Heavenly Bodies, and their Revolutions and\nInfluences } that is to fay, the Study of Nature, of\nPhilofophy, and Aftronomy. i. Artificial or ratio-\nnal Magick, in which they included the Know-\nledge of all judicial Aftrology, the caftiog or cal-\nculating Nativities, curing Difeafes by Charms, by\nparticular Figures placed in this or that Pofitionj\nby Herbs gather'd at this or that particular Crifis\nof Time, and by faying fuch and fuch Words over\nthe Patient, repeated fo many times, and by fuch\nand fuch Geftures, ftroking the Flefh in fuch and\nfuch a manner, and innumerable fuch like Pieces\nof Mimickry 3 working not upon the Difeafe it felf^\nbut upon the Imagination of the diftemper'd Peo-\nple, and fo effeding the Cures by the Power of\nNature, tho' that Nature were fet on work by the\nweakeft and fimplell methods imaginable. But,\n3<r\/\/y, the laft is traly called Diabolical and helliih\nMagick, which was operated by and with the\nConcurrence of the Devil, carried on by a Cor-\nfpondence with evil Spirits, with their Help,\nPrefence, and perfonal AiTiftance, and chiefly\npradifed by their Priefts. And thus you have\nthe general Syftem of Magick, according to my\nTitle : But I muft enter a little into the Parti-\nculars.\nE The\n\fJO A S T S T p. M\nThe firft Sort of this Magick I have alrca*\ndy defcribed 5 and I am ftill of this Opinion, that\nin all the firft Ages of the World, there was very\nlittle other Magick than this known among Men j\nThat, all the Diabolical Praftices of the third Sort,\nor the Arc and Legerdemain of the fecond Sort\nof Magick, was perfcftly unknown to the Ma-\ngicians of jEgypt or Arabia^ or afterwards of ChaU\ndea^ at leaft for a great while.\nAs for the Magicians of ChMea^ I have named\nthem already, and we find nothing Diabolical among\nthem : as to thofe o\u00a3 jEgyp^ efpecially fuchas were\nordinarily called foj 'tis evident alfo they were gene-\nrally the fame J for when Pharaoh King of Mgyp\ndreamed his firft Dream of the feven fat, and the ^tsz^\nleanKine, Gen. xli. the Words arc exprefs, ^ver. 8. He\nfent for all the Magicians and all the wife Men ofMgypt j\nand what followed? there was none that could interpret\nhis Dream. Upon which, Jofeph was fent forj where\nby the way you may obferve the difference between\nJofeph and the wife Men or Magicians, let them be\nwhat they will. The wife Men came when they\nwere fent for, and they put the King to the trou-\nble of telling them his Dream, and, as we may be-\nlieve, went away to confult and confider of an An-\nfwer. If they could have amufed the King with any\nfham Anfwer, fo as to have quieted his Thoughts,\nwhich were difturbed with the Oddnefs of the Ap-\npearance, they would certainly have done it 5 whence\nI conclude they were not either of the fecond fort\nof Magicians, who by Trick and Charm, muttering\nof Words, drawing Figures, and fuch empty and\nfimple Formalities, did their Work> if they had,\nthey would certainly have cheated the King with\nfome of their Impoftures and Legerdemain, and\nhave made him accept of thi\u00ab or that wild Story\nfor an Interpretation.\nNor\n\fof M A G 1 C K. ji\n^Tbr were they diabolical Magicians, fuch as by\na real and immediate ConverHicion with the Devil,\nor fome of his invifible Agents which we call evil\nSpirits, wrought their ufual Wonders, or Delufions\nlike Wonders J and fuch as perhaps thole after-\nwards made ufe of by another Pharaoh King of\nMgypt really were 5 who mimick'd the Miracles of\nMofes in the fight of the King and his Court :\nIf they had been fuch, the Devil would not have\nfufFer'd them to be fo difgraced before their Lord,\nas to go away and fay they could make nothing\nof it, nor give him the Interpretation > the Devil\nwould certainly have furniihed them with fome\nkind of Interpretation, true or falfe, at leaft fuch\nas fliould have fatisfied the King for the pre-^\nfent.\nN.B. It is very reafonable to fugged here, thac\nthcfc Magicians and wife Men oi Mgypt^ and\nfo thofe afterwards at Babylon^ had been ufually\ncalled together before, upon fuch Occafions\nas thofe 5 that they had often interpreted Dreams,\nperhaps fortheKinghimfelf, as well as for other\nPeople i that fometimes they did perhaps make\nfuch Interpretations as came to pals, by which\nthey maintained much of their Reputation a*\nmong the People, as wife Men and as Magi-\ncians : the fame we fee praftifcd among us to\nthis day by many an ignorant old Woman,\nwithout thelcafl Claim to the venerable Name\nof Magician^ much lefs of Wife s alfo we cannot\ndoubt but that the Kings oi Mgypt and o^ Ba*\nhylon did expe6b and believe thofe Magicians\ncould interpret if they would j it had been\nelfe a prepofterous piece of Cruelty in Nehu^\nchadnezzar to put all the Magicians and wife\nMen to death, becaufe they did not tell him\nhis Dream and the Interpretation, if he did\nreally believe they were not able to do it 5 for\nE 2. 'tis\n\fA S T S T E M\n^tis certain they did not pretend to be able to\ntell the Dream, tho' ihey did pretend to tell\nthe Interpretation 5 but he certainly believed\nthey were able to do both.\nBut when Pharaoh comes to talk with Jofeph^ he\nhoneftly tells the King it was not in him j modeftly\ndiverting himfelf ofall Claim to the Honour which\nhe forefaw was going to be put upon him, and\ngiving up the Praife to the fupream Agent, to\nwhom it was due. v. ^6. It is not in me^ but God\nJhall give Pharaoh an Anpwer of Peace 5 and then he\ngoes on to interpret the Dream.\nI give you this as an Evidence of the Diffe-\nrence in the Kinds of Magick pra6lired in thofc\ntimes 5 the firfl Sort, 'tis plain, were, as has been\ndefcribed, meer Men of Learning, Maflers of Sci-\nence, namely, the Knowledge of Nature, ftudying\nPhilofophy, Aftronomy, and the like j fome pra6ti-\n\u00a3ng one way, fome another} fome looking up a-\nmong the Stars, others down among the Plants 5\nfome into the Microcofm of Man, and pradifing\nMedicine for the Cure of Difeafes j fome judging\nof Dreams and Omens, others of Signs and Appea-\nrances, and all according to their feveral Studies,\nand the feveral Branches of Science which they ap-\nplied themfelves to > but not any Sorcery or Devil-\nwork among them at that time, or for fome hun-\ndreds of Years after.\nBut come now to the fame Country, viz. Mgypt^\nfor here, it feems, the Devil began firfl to converfc\nwith Mankind, or Mankind with him rather, in\nthis familiar manner j I fay, come to the fame Coun-\ntry at the diftance of lefs than two hundred Years,\nor thereabout, and there you find the Magicians\nturned into another fort of People, or rather another\nfort of People mixM with them j for when A\/i^\/^i and\njl,aron go to Pharaoh to demand the Liberty of\nthe\n\fof M A G 1 C K.

Pha-\nraoh called the Sorcerers and Magicians o^ jEgypt-^\nand fee then how they a6bed, ^'^r. zz. and the Magi-\ndans did the fame with their Inchantments \\ and the like\nin feveral other Places: fo that here the Magicians and\nwife Men were of another fort, for they a61:ed by\na Diabolical Pradlice, as Sorcerers and Dealers with\nthe Devil J befides 'tis every where faid, they did it\nby their Inchantments, which we never find fo\nmuch as mentioned before 5 no, nor afterwards a-\nmong the Chaldeans \"xnd the Magicians of Perjia and\njljyria\\ but they a6ted by the meer Force of their\nWifdom and Learning, ^uix. the Study of Nature;\nand when that failed them, they acknowledged\nthey had no other Power, and could go no\nfarther.\nNow, as I faid before, having pafs'd thro'\nthe beft of the Art, and. the firft and only honefl\nPart of the Pradice, it follows, that we con-\nfider the Subfequent Progrcfiions of the People\ncalled Magicians, what they have been underfbood\nto be, what they now are in the World, and\nwhat we are to underftand by the Word when we\nfay Magick or a Magician 3 and this \\s^\nFirft^ A Jugler or Shower of Tricks by Legerde-\nmain and Slight of hand; which I call only a fham\nMagick, and which the World has been indeed de-\nluded with for many Ages.\nSecondly^ A real Sorcerer or Wizard that deals\nWith the Devil, who converfes fimiliarly with the\nE 3 old\n\f14 A S T S T E M\nold Gentleman, has him at his Call, fetches him,\nfends him of Errands, raifes him, lays him, ufes\nhim, upon all Occafions and in all Difguifes, as he\nfinds Occafion.\nThat there have been fuch as thefe in the World,\nmuft be true, or Hiltory muft be one univcrfal Le-\ngend of Lies, and we muft have been deluded and\nimpofed upon by all the Writers and Regifter-\nkecpers that ever ha^ e been, were, or are in Being j\nnay even the facred Writings confirm it, and there-\nfore, with the Pardon of all our modern Unbelievers,\nwho deny there is fuch a thing as a Devil or evil\nSpirit in Being, either in the World or out of it,\nI fay with their good Leave, I muft take it for\ngranted.\nNow tho' I could bring many Examples among\nthe Modern?, where 'tis moll certain that fome\nwalking Gentlemen among us, who have look'd as\nif they had nothing in them more than other People,\nhave really been a Cage of Devils^ and as the Text\ncalls them Unclean Spirits, yet I mqft at prefent\nlook a little higher, becaufe I am refolvcd to bring\nfuch Evidence as cannot be denied.\nFirft^ The Scripture fays of Judas^ that with or\nafter the Sop the Devil enter'd into him, Johnxm,\n27. u^nd after the fop Sata,n enter'd into him^ that is,\ninto Judas 'y and in the fame Chap. v. z. the Devil\nhaving put it into the heart ^\/ Judas Ifcariot, SimonV\nSon, to betray him: and again, St. Paul fpeaking to\nElymas^ whom the Text calls in totidem verbis the\nSorcerer^ calls him thou Child of the Devil. This,\nand all the Teftimonies of the Devil's being miracu-\nloufly difpoflefs'd by our Saviour, and by his Difciplcs\nand Apoftles, will put it out of queftion, not only\nthat there is fuch a thing as a Devil, but alfo that\nhe has Pofleflion of feveral of his Servants in hu-\nfnan Shape.\nBut\n\fof M A G 1 C K, y J\nBut this is not the cafe at all, for I am not now\nupon the Proof of the Reality and Exiftence of the\nDevil 5 that has been worthily undertaken, and hi-\nllorically, mathematically, and enthufiaftically e-\nnough Perform'd by a late Writer in another\nPlace: But I am now talking of a Set of People\nwho were not poflefs'd BY, but rather, as it may\nbe called, are pofTefsM OF the Devil y have him in\ntheir keeping and Cuftodyj where, by the way,\nI do not find but that the Devil fcems to be very\nmuch in Subjection to them > whether it b& volun-\ntarily, and fo perhaps, like an obfequious Dog, that\nfawns for what he can get \u2022, He (the Devil) creeps and\ncringes, in order the better to carry on his own\nDefigns, which indeed is not at all improbable 5 or\nwhether there were Ways and Means which thefc\nantient People had found out, by what fuperiour\nPower I know not, to fubjedt the Devil to their\nOrders, and make him their humble Servant upon\nall Occafions, to run and go, fetch and carry, at\ntheir whiflle : All thefe critical Enquiries may per-\nhaps come in my way^ when I come to talk more\nparticularly of the Magick of our prefent times, and\nthe Management of our modern Cunning Men, who\npretend to have the Devil in a String, make him\njump over a Broomftick, dance and fhow Tricks,\nas the Mountebanks and Merry-Andrews do with\na Bear and a Monkey.\nI muft: confers,if I can but, in my further Search\nafter thofe things, find out the Method the antient\nMagicians had to manage the Devil thus, and\nbring him to their hand, and can convey the Art to\nPofterity, or at leaftfet up a Scheme for the prefent\nImprovement of it, I fhall not doubt but 1 fhal!\nmeet with Encouragement j and if the eminent\nMr. Wh\u2014on will but floop to join in with my\nDefign (as 1 doubt not he will, if there be but\nMoney to be got by it) we may publifli our Read-\nE 4 ings,\n\ff6 A S r S T E M\nings, and fct up Lc6i:Lir\u20acs for the Inftruftion of\nyoung Magicians, and that with extraordinary good\nSuccefsj nor do I think the reverend Mr. Em\u2014^in\nwould flick out: for why fhould we doubt but\nthey who have ah'eady levell'd their Saviour with\na Clafs infinitely below the Devil, and made a\nmeer De'vil or Apparition of the great Teacher and\nSanftifier of the World, would willingly fet up\nLedures in Favour of the Devil himfelf, if they\ncan find their account in it.\nBefides, when we are thus engaged in Satan's\nService, and in Conjun6tion with his Friends and\nFavourites, Vve cannot doubt but the Devil him-\nfelf will be fo much obliged, that he may come\nfrankly and Voluntier, and let us into the Secret,\nbind himfclf Apprentice to us for a Term of\nYears, and enable us to play the Devil with him\nfor the Time to come, as he had played the De-\nvil with us for fo many Years paft. Nor, if he\nbe a grateful Devil^ can he do lefs 5 for no Men in\nthe World feem better qualified to advance his In-\ntereft in the main, however for the prefent we\nmay feem to keep him in a little Subjection.\nOn the other hand, if he fhould prove an un^\ngrateful Spirit, and hang an A\u2014, as the Modell\ncall it, being unwilling to come into Bondage j\njhen, I fay, we mui\\ try if we can't find the way\nto do it without him, and, by our Black-^rt^ play\nthe Devil with him, and force him to come when\nhe's called, go when he is feat, and do as he is\nbid 5 as our Predeceflbrs the antient Magicians of\nMgyp did before us, who made him affill Mofes and\njiaron^ and make Frogs, and Snakes, juft as they\ndiredcd him : tho' it feems when they commanded\nhim to make Lice, the lead and loufieft Creature\nof 'em all, the honed iD^i;\/\/ confefs'd it was out of\nhis Power, that God was above the Devil^ and that\n{in a Word) he could not do ity by which (however)\nhe\n\fof M A G I C K. j7\nhe loft a great deal of his Credit with his Em-\nployers, and perhaps with the King himfelf.\nThat the Devil affifted the Magicians o^ jEgypt\nto do thofe things, or in fhort, that they made ufe\nof him as their Inllrument, is plain from the Text,\ninz. that they did it by their Inchantments : What\nmanner ofConjurings or Inchantments they were\nthat they made lTc of, we have no parricular light\ninto from the facred Text 5 but perhaps fome Guefs\nmay be made at i^, fram what happen'd frequently\nin thofe Countries in after- Ages.\nAlfo we find that whatever the Magicians in\nPerfta, and in Medla^ and in thofe Eaftern Countries\nwere, (for their Credit continued many Ages) yet in\nMgypt they were (after that) chiefly Sorcerers and\nDealers with the Devil -^ -.rd in a word, ^gypt\ni'eem'd to be the Nurfery or human Devils for all\nthe World. Hence Baal'-^ is c^Hed a Witch, and\nhence in the Roraan times the ^Egyptian Sorcerers\nwere brought to Antioch for the Afliftance of 7^-\nlian the Apoftate, to utter Predidions, and to flat-\nter the Emperor with their good Omens and their\nPrognoftications J in which he was fo fuperftitious,\nthat they put the grofleft Delufions upon him, 'till\nthe Citizens oi Antioch made a jeft of him, and ex-\npofed his Inchantments to Ridicule j for which, had\nhe lived to come back from the War in Perfia^ he\nhad vowed a fcvere Revenge.\nHence alfo the Mgyptians^ are to rhis day, the\ncommon Strollers of the World, and arc fucceeded\nby a Race of Vagabonds who pretend to the Art,\nwithout the real Wickednefs of it, and would be\nthought to deal with the Devil, when the Truth\nis, they know little or nothing of him.\nI fuppofe I need not tell you that the Word\nQypfie is derived from thefe ftrolling Magicians^\nwhich really came out of Mgypt^ and wandering\nover the World, got Money by their pretending\ntQ\n\fj8 A S T S T E M\nto Magick, telling Fortunes, predicting Events, and\nMountebanking the World with their Inchant-\nments j 'till at lafl: having tired the Devil with\nfollowing them, and the Drudgery of their Ser-\nvice being not worth his while, Satan left them j\nand they have been fince that, for fome time, in\nthe Clafs of the well-known Cardinal who\npretending to an Acquaintance with the Devil, and\nto have three inferior Daemons appointed to wait\non him, the Devil fent thofe three Daemons to\ntell his Neighbours 'twas all a Cheat, and that he,\nSatan^ had nothing to do with him.\n'Tis very flrange Men ihould be fo fond of being\nthought wickeder than they are > that they cannot\nforbear, but that they muft abufe the very Devil,\nand claim Kindred of him, whether he has any\nKnowledge of them or no : But thus it is, and we\nneed not go to Mgjpt for Examples, when we have\nfo many pieces of dull Witchcraft among our\nfelves.\nIt is true the Devil does not often decline an\nAcquaintance where he can find his Account in it>\nand therefore the eminent DoClor may hope,\nthat after a little farther Application to Herefy and\nBlafpheray, he may be thought worthy of Admit-\ntance into Satan's Favour, at Icafl fo much as to\nfettle a Correfpondence, that fo they may a61: in\nconcert for the future.\nI am told fome have thought it a particular Re-\nputation to them to have it fuppofed they maintain\na Correfpondence of this kind, which muft be up-\non the foot of Satan's Credit, fuppofing that he\nknows who is fit for his Bufinefs, and who not,\nand that they muft be all capable Heads that he\nthinks ^l to be concerned with in this manner > for\nas wife Princes always chufe wife Councellors,\nthe Dm\/ underftands the Capacities of his Friends\nfo well, that he is never miftaken in his choice^\n6 but\n\fof M A G 1 C K.\nj9\nbut they that are concerned with him mufl at\nleaft be of the Cunning Clafs, for he has no Incli-\nnation at all to Fools.\nThis brought fome juft Refleftions into my\nThought upon the Condu6t of our Times, and im-\nmediately cleared up the Charafters of fome of the\ngreateft Politicians of our k^t^ at leaft in my Opi-\nnion, feeing 'tis evident they either have too much\nBrains, or too little, for the infernal Correfpondencej\nlet the World judge which of the two is their\nCafe.\nI fay it cleared up the Charafter of fome great\nMen to me, and I concluded rhey were no Ma-\ngicians, that they neither pra6lifed Magick in the\nSrft Senfe, as Philofophers > or in the laftSenfe, as\nConjurers 5 what they mightdo in the middle Senfe,\nas Jugglers, that remains to be enquired into as Op-\nportunity may prcfent.\nIndeed I run over in my Refleftions the prefent\nSituation of moft of the publick Affairs in Europe^\nthe Prime Minifters, grand Viziers, the Statefmen,\nthe Counfellors, Generals, Admirals; the Clergy,\nwhether Popilh or Proteftant, Greek Church, or\nRoman Church, Chriftian or Mahometan ; and I muft\nfpeak it to their Honour, that except, as a late\nWriter taught me to except, our own People, our\nown Country and Country Worthies, I can fee no\nreafon to think any of the prefent Managers to be Ma-\ngicuws'y whether, as above, we confider the Magi-\ncians to be Philofophers, or as Jannes and Jamhesy\nInchanters and Conjurers.\nBut having fpoken of the . two feveral forts of\nMagick^ I . Honeft Magick, which I have proved\nto be only the Study of natural Philofophy and\nAftronomy, and fuch ufeful Parts of Knowledge,\nwhich the Learned call Natural Magick j and,\nidly^ Diabolical or infernal Magick, which is a\npradifing by the Help of Daemons or evil Spi-\nrits j It\n\f\u20aco A S T S r E M\nIt remains then, that I fhould at leaft mention\nthe third, or which before I placed as fecond in\nOrder, which is Artificial Magick^ that is to fay, a\nmeer Legerdemain or Juggling with Nature : This\nis managed by the Wit and Dexterity of Man, with\nthe Advantages of concealed, occult Powers, known\nin Nature, but unknown and unfeen by vulgar\nHeads and Eyes \u2022, and fuch Fame tells us have been\ncarried to extraordinary heights, fuch as\nI. The Glafs Sphere oi Archimedes,\nz. The wooden Pidgcon of Architas.\n3.

Will any\nMan believe but he that firfl fhewed thefe unac-\ncountable things, would have paflcd for a Magician,\na Dealer with the Devil^ nay, or rather for a real\nDe'uil in human Shape ?\nWhoever had firfl brought fuch a wonderful Stone\ninto view as our ordinary Chalk- (lone, calcin'd and\nturned into Lime, fuppofing it never to have been\nheard\n\fof M A G I C K. 6i\nheard of before, and ihown with it the Rarity of its\nOperation, 'viz. that if you threw it into the Fire, ic\nwould put the Fire out, and if you put it into\nWater ic would burn.\nThcfe are fome of the Delufions of Artificial\nMagicians^ and fuch as thefe the World has been\nfull of, till now we begin to be too Wife to be\ncheated any longer that way j but as to State-jug-\nglers, the Magick of the Party- mongers. Religious-\njugglers, and the Magick of the Pulpit, with divers\nother lefs fatal Kinds, I believe they are at this\ntime in the Meridian of their Pra6tice and Succefs,\nor near it 5 what height they may go farther we\ndo not indeed certainly know, it mull be left to\nTime.\nAnd thus you have an honeft Syftem of the Sci-\nence called Magick^ according to the Title of this\nUndertaking.\nCHAP. III.\nOf the Reajon and Occajion which brought\nthe ancient honeft Magi, whofe original\nStudy was Vhilofophy^ Aftronomy^ and the\nWorks of Nature, to turn Sorcerers and\nIVizzardsy and deal with the \"Devil ; a7id\nhow their Converfation began,\nHAVI N G thus dated the Fad, and given you\nwhat I call a Syftem of Magick, 'tis neceffary\nnow, that in purfuance of my Title, I fhould in-\nfift more particularly upon the third and lafl fort of\nMagick I mention'd, and which is call'd Diabolical^\nor according to the vulgar Acceptation, the Black\"\nart, and bring ic out to you from its very foun-\ndation.\nThis\n\f6t A S r S T E M\nThis muft be deduced Hiftorically from the 6*\nther two, or clfe I cannot lead you regularly into\nits Original, or give you its true Defcription > be-\nfides, a great many ufeful and agreeable Specula-\ntions offer themfelves in the rife and progrefs of the\nthing it felf, which will be moft neceffary to fpeak\nto, as we go along.\nMagick did not jump at once into Being, as to\nthe thing it felfj it was not a Revelation from\nHell, made at once to Mankind, to tell them what\nthey might do : The Devil did not come and offer\nhis Service Gratis to us, and rcprefenting how\nufeful a Slave he would be, folicit us to take him\ninto Pay, and this at once without Ceremony or\nIntroduftion.\nNo^ noy it was a long Progreflion of Studies, and\nImprovement in wicked and mifchievous Schemes,\nthat brought Mankind to have recourfe to the In-\nfernals, to feek the Aid of the dark Agents\nbelow, and to follicit a Commerce of that kind\n:\nNor was this done till after finding many Diffi-\nculties in their other way, they faw evidently they\ncould not do without him, could not accomplifh\ntheir mifchievous Defires by other Methods, and that\nthis way it was to be done.\nNot but that the Devil was very ready, when he\nfound himfelf made neceffary j I fay, he was very\nready to come into the Schemes when proposM,\nand to ferve us in our Occafion, and that wiiha Wil-\nlingnefs which wasextreamly obliging 5 which fhew'd\nhim to be a Perfon of abundance ot Complaifance,\nand mighty willing ro engage us whatever it coil\nhim 5 as much as to fay, he was glad he could ferve\nus, was ready to do his utmofl for u?, and the like.\nNow to go back briefly to the Occafion which\nbrought the Magicians to the Necellity of fecking\nto him for Affiftance, and to |:ake him into the Ma-\nnagement of their Affairs > the Cafe was in fhort\nthis-:\n\fof M A G I C K.\n6i\nthis: The World, as I have faid already, began to be\nwifcr than the Ages before them j the ordinary\nMagick of the former Ages would not pafs any\nlonger for Wifdomj and if the wife Men, as they\nwere called^ did not daily produce fome new Dil-\ncoveries, 'twas evident the Price and Rate of\nSouthfaying would come down to hl thing.\nIf this put them upon Stratagem and Art, in or-\nder to keep up their Credit, and maintain the Di-\nflance between them and the inferior Rank of\nMen, it is not to be wonder'd au j and thefe Straua-\ngems were of feveral kinds, as the Occafion and the\nWit of the Undertakers prefenred , for you are to\nfuppofe the inquiring Temper of the common Peo-\nple to be arrived to fuch a Height, that nothing\ncould pafs with them for True, at leall nothing\nwhich had any Novelty in it, unlefs it was con-\nfirmed by fome ilrange thing, fome Sign, fome\nMiracle to be wrought, by which the Mind re-\nceiving a due ImprefHon, entertain'd the reft of the\nproposed Wonder with the more Satisfadion.\nAt firft the Magicians fatisfy'd the Curiofity of\nthe People by Juggle and Trick, by framing ar-\ntificial Voices and Noifes 5 foretelling ftrange\nEvents, by mechanical Appearances, and all the\nCheats which we find put upon the ignorant Peo-\nple to this Day 5 and it would be tedious to enu-\nmerate the Particulars by which they imposed upon\none another. You may guefs at them by fuch a^\nare mentioned before; but prirjcipally thofe who\nfludied the heavenly Motions, had great Opportu-\nnities of recommending themfelvcs for Men of\nCraft, pretending to tell Fortunes, calculate Nati-\nvities, refolve Doubts, read the Lines of Nature\ndrawn in the Face, Palms of the Hand, Symetry\nof the Body, Moles and Marks on the Fleih, and\nthe like,\nThefe\n\f<J4 A S Y S T E M\nThcfe things they carry'd to a due Length, arid\nwe find the Succefs was fo much to their Ad-\nvantage, that the whole World, or great Part of\nit, has been Gypfey-ridden by them, even to this\nDay.\nIt would fill a Volume larger than I propofe\nthis {hall be, to give an Account of the feveral\nStratagems thofe People had Recourfe to, in the\nearly Days of Sorcery and Magick^ in order to main-\ntain their Charadter in the World as extraordinaiy.\nFor I muft do them fo much Juftice as I go, to\nobfcrve, that they did not immediately run to the\nDevil for Helpj or at lead, if fome among them\ndealt in the Dark, and correfponded below, they\ndid not all do fo; perhaps they were not harden'd\nenough at firft for the carrying on fuch a Traffick.\n'Twas a new Commerce, and had fomething a little\nfhocking at firft, till the necefiity of their South-\nfaying Circumftances brought them to comply with\nany thing rather than lofe their Trade.\nThe jEgyptians^ you muft know, were a People\noriginally attended with two things, which natu-\nrally made way for thefe Magical Studies.\nI. Moft impertinently Inquifitive, grofly Igno-\nrant in the main, (as Ignorance would be called\nnow, but mighty Wife, as things were rated at that\ntime) and prying into every thing with an irre-\nfiftible Paflion for what they call'd Knowledge j\non this Account they pafs'd for the wifeft Nation\non Earth, and ^gypt was efteem'd the Center of\nLearning and Knowledge. Hence Mofes was faid\nto be learned in all the Wifdom of the jEgyptiam.\nIt is true, and they are upbraided with it by the\nEthiopians of Arabia Felix^ which they call the\nSouth ; and who, tho' Arabians^ are calFd Ethiopi-\nans in Scripture ; I fay, it is true, that the ALgyp-\ntians learned all their Magick, that is, their Aftro-\nnomy and Aftrology, from the Arabians-, and they\ntell\n\fof M A G I C K. 6^\ntell US that Abraham inftrudled h'lsSon Ipmael^ in all\nthe fuperior Knowledge in which his Poflericy\nafterwards grew fo famous.\n2. With this inqiiifitive Temper of the jEgyptl-\nans^ they were alfo moft ridiculoufly Superftitious j I\nfay, moft ridiculouily, becaufc it ihew'd it feU in-\nthat fordid and moft fimple Idolatry which they hid\nmong them, in which they funk below the com-\nmon Notions of Worihip pradis'd by the moft\nignorant Nations in the World j for they wor-\nfhip'd, or made a God of, almoft every thing thac\ncame in their way 5 as the Ox, the (^alf, the Wa-\nter of Nik^ nay the River it felf, the Sand, the\nCrocodiles, and numberlefs things as fcnfelefs as\nthofe.\nAs thefe things were peculiar to them as a Na-\ntion, fo they particularly qualify 'd them to be im-\nposed upon by their Southfayers and Magicians,\nwith all manner of Delufionsi nor did the fubtle\nMagicians fail to make their Advantage, upon all\nOccaiions, of this fuperftitious and inquiring Hu-\nmour of the People, but ufed all polliblc Stratagem\nand Art to delude and impofe upon them.\nTo this purpofe, they foon mixt their Religion\nand their Magick together, their Philofophy and their\nIdolatry were made Aftiltant to the general Fraud,\nand to raife a due Veneration in the Mmds of the\nPeople: To this or that particular Tale advanc'd\nby their Priefts, they brought always along v iih\nthem fome extraordinary Revelation from the Gods,\nfome wonderful Difcovery in Nature, or fomcthing\nftrange and miraculous.\nHow ftrangely does religious Enthufiafm k^tv its\nhold of Mankind, and how exa6lly do paft things\nand prefent correfpond ! As the End is the fame, fo\nare the Means: pious Frauds got ground from the\nBeginning, and pious Frauds get ground to the\nEnd. As no Cheats are fo fatal as thcfe which\nF come\n\f66 A S Y S r E M\ncome prefac'd with Introduftions of Religionj fo\nno Cheats are fo eafy to prevail, fo foon make Im-\npreflions upon the People, or (lamp thofe Impref-\nfions deeper.\nThe Priefts among the jEgyptians^ when they\nturn'd Magicians^ (or rather, I fhould have faid, the\nMagicians^ when they turn'd Priells,)ret up for Re-\nvelation, Infpiration, and a Converfation with their\nGods i and for this purpofe they withdrew into the\nDefarts and Waftes, of which the Country is known\nto be full ; and where to their Glory (Shame) be it\nfpoken, the Religious of the Romijh Church play'd\nthe fame Game over again, fome Ages afterward.\nHither the ^Egyptian Priefts, I fay, retir'd for\nConverfation with their Gods, from whence they\nwere fure to come back infpir'd, that is to fay,\nHird with fome new Dclufion to impofe upon the\nPeople.

And\nfince the Church has but one true and rightful\nKing and Sovereign, there would never have been\nfuch a bold Attempt to depofe him, if the Devil,\nthe ancient Ufurperof his Throne, had not been at\nwork again to flep up in his Room. But we fhall\nhave occalion to fpeak of this Pare more plainly by\nand by.\nIt was with great Succefs, that the ^Egyptian\nPrieils wen: on in the manner as above, and their\nArtificial Magick went u great way in all the\nF 3 Eaftern\n\fA SYSTEM\nEaftern World j they were counted the beft and\nwifeft Men, who, Mountebank like, could ihow\nmoll: Tricks, and invent the moil furprizing things\nto take with the Vulgar, fo as to give their Words\nthe Force of an Oracle, and entitle them to the\nChara61:cr of Divine and Prophetick: And thus\nwe may fuppofe the World going on for many\nAges, till at length, to come nearer our own Times,\nand indeed nearer to the Praftice of our own Times\ntoo, their Mimickry was exhaufted j they had no\nmore Tricks to play, the juggling Trade grew\nitale and dull, the World began to look beyond\nthem, and expe6ted fomething more> and fo the\nlad, I do not fay the Church Jugglers, went to the\nDevil for Help. 1 had rather tell you that another\nGeneration, who had always been true Magicians^\ntrue Pradicers of the Diabolical Parr, came in play\nof courfe, and fucceeded the firft, who gradually\ndepofed thcmfelves by their meer Impotency> and\njuft as Darknefs is a deprivation of Light, and fuc-\nceeds it by the meer Confequence of things, fo the\nhoned Ignorance of the innocent Magician being\nunable to keep the Expedation of the People up,\nand anfwer the Importunities of the hg^^ dealing\nwith the Devil fucceeded, even by the meer Con-\nfequence of things.\nThe new Magick coming thus in Play, let us fee\nhow it made its firfl Entrance in the World, and in\nwhat Shapes it began to appear 5 inwhich Search we\n{hall find, in ihort, that Religion dill open'd the\nDoor. For as the Devil afpir'd at nothing more\nfrom the Beginning than to be fet up for a God, fo\nhe always built his Chappel clofe by God's Church}\nit was in the Confequence of this, that the\nPricds were always his more immediate Correfpon-\ndents.

B. This Maximus was a Magician^ when the\nWord Magician fignified no more a wife Man,\nor a Southfayer, but a dov\/n-right Conjurer,\n. a Mailer of the Black-art, or One who dealt\nwith the Devil.\nNor was it that the Magicians were Favourers of\nPaganifm only, but fuch was the Subtilty of the\nDevil, that indeed the Pagan Worfhip confifted\nmuch in Sorcery and Magick, Conjurings, Invo-\ncation of Devils, and raifing evil Spirits 5 by Thefe\nthe Rites and Ceremonies of Paganifm werefuppor-\nted. 'Tis faidof the famous Champion of the Chri-\nilian Religion, Athanafius^ that he underftood all the\nMyfteries of the Pagan Theology 5 but we are noc\ncome to that Length in our Enquiries yet.\nThe Devil had a great many good Reafons to\nbefriend the Pagan Worfhip, rather than the Chri-\nflian J for that indeed the Subflance of Paganifm\nwas a Diabolical Syllem in it felf, and to worfhip\nthe Heathen Gods, was EfTentially to worfhip the\nDevil, as we fhall fee in its Place.\nF 4 Wc\n\f7i A S r S T E M\nV\/e mufl obferve here, that the Curioiity of\nMan in the moll: early Times was never fully grati-\nfied, but when his Underilanding was as it were\nconfounded, when he was under ibme Aftoniiliment\nand Surprize, at feeing or hearing feme ftrange\nthing. The Pharifees, when they were attacking\nour Saviour, as they almoft were always, and when\nfls they though r they infulted him, ask'd him what\nSign doeft thou fhow, that thou doeft fuch things\nas rhdc?\nAnd in other Places 'tis faid, when he did per-\nform lome miraculous Things they were aftonifh'd\na' him 5 Altonifliment introduces Silence, Men are\nfiiilamaz'd, and have nothing to fay, and then Nature\nd:ciatfs Credulity as the Confcquence, viz. that\nwhen rhey arc thus furpriz'd with Wonder, they\nfhould confequentiy believe the Perfon who fo afto-\nnifh'd them with his Miracles: tho', by the way, it\nwas not always To with the Jews^ for they were\namaz'd, and yet did no^ believe neither > in which\nihcy were fomething of Kin to an unbelieving\nChriilian in our Town, of Ecclefiaftic Fame tooj\nwho fays he, w^onders and is allonifli'd at the Ma-\njefty of the Scnprure Style, and yet docs not be-\nlieve a Word they fay. A bolder Infidel I have not\nmet with fince I was laft at the Pagan Circle,\nnear old Charing^ where God was own'd, fworn\nby^ imprecated, blafphem'd, and deny'd, all in a\nBreath.\nBut to go on : The Curiofity of Mankind I fay\nwas never fully fatisfy'd, but when fomething won-\nderful was offer'd, and therefore Miracle was im-\nmediately call'd for, when any new Syflem was\noffer'd, or any thing difficult propofed.\nThus when God fent Mofes and Jaron to Pha-\nraoh^ he fuppofes the very Cafe; Mofes and Amon\nwere to aOlire Pharaoh that God fcnt them, and\nthey were in his Name to demand Liberty for the\nChildren\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 7^\nChildren of Ifrael. The Demand was furprizing:\n'twas an infolenc thing indeed, for a couple of\nSlaves to come, and ask the King to releafe fix\nhundred thoufand Men, Slaves like themlelves,\nfrom their Captivity, and from the King's Service,\nwhofe Siibjedts, or rather Servants, they were 5 and\nPharaoh 'tis to be fuppos'd began to refent it 5 nay\nwe may fuppofe without any Prefumptijn thatPZ?^-\nraoh\\ Courtiers made Game at 'em, and his Mini-\nfters of State perhaps propos'd to punifh them for\ntheir Impudence, and for putting fuch Notions into\nthe People's Heads, which might be dangerous,\nand might excite Tumuks and Rebellion 5 and\ntherefore it was Prudence to fupprefs the Inlblence,\nand make Examples of the two pretended Ambaf-\nfadors.\nBut hold \\ fays Mofes^ we do not come to affront\nyour Majefty^ nor are the People we come to\nfpeak for inclin'd to revolt or rebel 5 but wc come\nfrom God j the People of Ifiael whom we rcprefent\nare God's chofen fiivourite Nation, tho' they are\nyour Servants, and they are commanded to go three\ndays Journey into the Wildernefs, to perform a\ngreat Sacrifice, and make a great Feaft to him 5 and\ntherefore we come to defire your Leave, that we\nmay go peaceably and do the Duty of our Wor-\nship j afluring your Majefly, that God himfelf, who\nhas thus commanded us our, has fent me to you to\ndemand your Afient.\nGod fent you ! fays the King : a ^xs.t Story for you to\nput into the People's Heads to make them idle, and\nhinder my Bufinefs> go, get you gone to your\nWork, and to your Task, or 1 fiiall find a way to\ndrive thefe Whymfies out of your Heads again.\nBut ftill Mofes and Aaron^ with other the Heads\nof the Ifraelites^ (for there were many more with\nthem) infilled, that they were fent by the immediate\nDire6lion of God himfdf.

Upon\nwhich his two chief Conjurers or Magicians were\ncaird \\Uy 'tis fuppos'd they were at hand, for the\nDevil is feldom out of call when he is wanted for\nany Mifchief\nUpon this comes James and Jamhres^ fo St. Paul\ncaird them, and the Text fays they were two Ma-\ngicians^ and perhaps there might be a great many\nmore of that fort > for it feems the King's Court\nwas not then without a fufficient Number of Cler-\ngy in daily waiting. And the Text adds, Pharaoh\ncall'd the wife Men^ and iht Sorcerers -y and the next\nWord calls them Magicians^ and not only Magi-\ncians in common, as the Word was ufed Perfonally,\nbut as it was ufed Nationally, The Magicians of\njEgypt : whence 'tis inferr'd, that there were fome\nMagicians not only more Eminent than others, but\nfuch as were in publick Office there j as the Emi-\nnent Dr. \/\/..... may be call'd the King's Aftro-\nnomer,\n\fof M A G I C K. 7y\nnomer, or as the more Eminenc Mr. Flamfiead ufu-\nally caird himfelf the King's Star-gazer > and if it\nwas not fo that thefe Men were in ordinary At-\ntendance, and in Pay, how fhould they be brought\nin fo foon, while Mofes and jlaron were in thfc\nPrefence ?\nWell, thefe Men being call'd in, Pharaoh^ in\nContempt of Mofes and Aaron^ and the Sign ot\nMiracle they had fhewn, ask'd them if they could\nnot do that as well as Aaron ?\nThey readily anfwer Yes, and fall to Paw-waw-\ning^ as ih^ Americans call it, and ufing their Inchant-\nmens, invoking or whifpering their Daemons, or\nwhat other Diabolical Arts they might ufe we\nknow not 5 but upon this, and their Staves or Rods\nbeing cad down, they were turn'd into Serpenrs\ntoo.\nThis was enough to make Pharaoh triumph over\nMofes and Aaron^ and their Company, and deriding\ntheir Mirale, tell them infultingly,this did not at all\nteflifie their Miflion from God, for they might fee\nhis wife Men could turn Rods into Serpents as well\nas they. Nor did the Diftinftion which God was\npleas'd to {how, by fufFering Aaron's Serpent to de-\nvour or fwallow up the Serpents of the Egyptian\nSorcerers, alter the Cafe with Pharaoh-^ for that,\nas an Accident, did not import any thing at all in the\nCafe. And thus he fent them, or rather drove\nthem, away with Contempt, and immediately fent\nTaskmallers among the People to double their\nAffli61;ions, encreafe their Labours, and force them\nto make Brick without Straw.\nWell, Mofes and Aaron come again with the\nfame MefTage, and it had the fame Event, they are\nBanter'd and ridicuPd : As if the King had calPd to\nthem thus j Well, you are come again, and you fay\nGod has fent you, pray has he furnirfi'd you with\nany better Teftimony than you had before, have\nyou any other Miracle to ihow ? The\nf\n\f76 A S Y S r E M\nThe facred AmbalTadors gravely tell him they\nhad, and if he would ftill refufe to grant their De-\nmands, he fhould fee it 5 nay, they tell him be-\nfore- Land what it lliould be, namely, that they\nwould turn the Waters o\u00a3 Nile^ the great River of\ntheir Country, into Blood.\nPhara'jh^ as may be fuppofed, not believing they\ncould do It, ti ears them ftill in the fame manner,\nand refules ftill to receive them as MclTengers from\nGod> upon which, Mofes calls to Aaron^ and bids\nhim Itretch out his Rod and fmite the Waters of\nthe River, and they were immediately turned into\nBloud, and all the Waters, Ponds, and Pools be-\niides> for \/Egypt is full of Pits and Ponds, wherein\nthey preferve the Water of Nile after the annual In-\nundation.\nThe King, frighted at this fudden Change of the\nWaier, is a little calmer han he was before; but\nconddering the matter, he calls his Magicians to fee\nif they could not do this alfo, as well as Mofes\n\\\nwhen they came they did the fame, by which (till\nthe blinded Mind of the Prince continued obfti-\nnate.\nI might run through the reil of the Miracles\nwrought there, and lliew you how the Magiciam\nbrought Frogs, but could not bring Lice 5 but\nthis is not to the Cafe 5 the Story is known.\nOnly one thing I mud note for your Diredion\nin the reading this Part of the Story, 'viz. that the\nMagicians could bring Plagues, at lead fome of\nthem, as well as Mofes and Aaron-y but the Magi-\ncians could not remove them again, as Mofes did ;\nfo that the King might have perceived that which\nthe Magicians themfelves acknowledged in the\nPlague of the Lice, that it was the Finger of God\nwhich only could remove the Plagues he brought.\nThe whole Defign of this Remark is to Ihew,\nthat it was always ihe Temper of Mankind to de-\nmand\n\fof M A G I C K. 77\nman^ a S\u00abgn or a Miracle, to confirm any new ad-\nvanced Do6lTine, or any extraordinary Miffion, and\nto take thofe Miracles when produced for a full\nConfirmation.\nThis Temper of the People, as it drove the Ma-\ngicians to their Shifts how to fupply Miracles to\nobtain Credit with the People, fo it drove them\nbeyond their Shifcs too at laft, and brought them\nto a Confederacy with the Devil for a Supply of\nWondcrfuls to delude the People. They tell us of\na certain Sorcerer at Antioch^ who for the Confir-\nm;ition of fome particular thing, which he had af-\nfirmed to the People, to keep up his Credit with\nthem, told them, that fuch an Evening he would\ncaufe Fire to come down from Heaven, and that\nit fhould reft on the Top of fuch a certain Hill, in\nthe Sight of all the City.\nWhether the cunning Artift had found out any\nCompofition by which to make artificial Fireworks,\nagreeable to what is done at this time or not, is\nnot certain 3 tho' 'tis moft certain the Arc of ma-\nking Gunpowder was not then known, nor for above\na thoufand Years afterwards: But for certain he\ncaufed fuch a Machine to mount in the Air, unfeca\nin the dark of the Evening, which then burfting,\ncame down again in a Shower of Fire, like the\nStars (as we call them) which fpread themfelves\nand fall down upon the burfting of the Tail of a\nRocket i and this fo amazed the People, that they\nbelieved afterwards every thing he faid.\nThus Simon the Sorcerer is faid, by his Diabolical\nInchantments, to fly up in the Air, and perform\nfo many furprizing things, that 'tis faid the Peo-\nple called him the Great Power of God^ or the\nAppearance of the great Power of God, v<f^j viii. lo.\nIndeed the Defcriprion the Scripture gives there\nof this Smon is very remarkable to ch- cale in hand j\nfirft 'tis faid, 'ver, p. \"that he ujed Sorcery and bewitched\nthe\n\fA SYSTEM\nthe People^ that is, the People of Samaria > then 'tis\nadded, all the People gave heed to him, and faid,\nfhis Man is the great Power of God -y the meaning is\nevident, this Man has done fuch great and flrange\nthings, Hicwed fuch Miracles, fuch Wonders, that\nnone but the great Power of God could enable\nhim to do \\ and therefore 'tis certain that he is aided\nand aflifted by the great Power of God 5 and this\nhe held a long time. ver. 11. 'To him they had re-\ngard^ beca.ufe for a long time he had bewitched then%\nijijith his Sorceries.\nThe Cafe of Simon and the People at Samaria\nwas juft as it was with Pharaoh and his Magicians,\nwhen Mofes and Aaron came to him. Pharaoh and\nall his Courtiers gave heed to Jannes and Jambres^\nfor that of a long time they had bewitched them\nwith their Sorceries.\nIt remains a Queftion here, by what Power and\nby whofe Hand it muft be, that the Magicians of\n^gypt turned their Rods into Serpents 5 fmotc the\nWaters, and turned them into Blood j brought\nup Frogs, i^c. that is, in ihort, mimicked or imi-\ntated the Miracles of Mofes and Aaron. If I am\n^sked by whofe Permiffion it was done, I know how\nto anfwer j but if you ask who was the Inftru-\nment, I muft fay it was the Devils for the Text\nfays exprefly, they did it by their Inchantments.\nOn the other hand, when they were baffled in\ntheir Paw-wawing for Lice, and could not per-\nform it, 'tis faid exprefly, they acknowledged that\nthey could not do it, for that was the Finger of Gody\nExod. viii. ip.\nNow whether the Magicians meant, it is theFin-\nfcr of God that hinders us from doing now as we\nid before, fo that we cannot bring up Lice as we\ndid Frogs i or whether they feemed to acknow-\nledge, that the Plague of Lice was the Finger of\nGod, tho' they did not grant that the Blood and\nthe\n\fof M A G I C K. 7^\nthe Frogs were fo, becaufe the Devil could do it\nalfo j this, I fay, is a Doubt which Commentators\ndo not refolve, or at lead do not agree about.\nBut take it which way you will, 'tis an Acknow-\nledgment, that what they did by their Sorcery and\nInchantments, was not done by the Finger of\nGod> and alio that when the Finger of God was\nin the Work, their Sorcery and Inchantments were.\nimpotent and could do nothing.\nIt is not to be queftioned but as this Correfpoix-\n6cnc^ began between thefe Magicians and the in-\nfernal Spirits, they did alfo upon all Occafions, and\nwith the utmoft of their Power, as well as withi\nthe greatefl Artifice and Cunning, endeavour ta\nmake the People believe, that what they did was\nby the great Power of God, by the Finger of\nHeaven 5 for this alone anfwer'd the End, which.\nwa& Deluding, and Impofing upon Mankind. 'Twas\nthe Unhappinefs of that Ag^^ as it is of ours, wheu\na more modern and indeed more fatal kind of Ma-\ngick is pradtifed in the World 5 I fay, it was their\nUnhappinefs that the Minds of the People feemed\nprepared for their Delufions, by being more eafily\nimpofed upon than ufual.\nThe Eajiern World had for many Ages been led\nand guided by the Juggles and Legerdemain of their\nSouthfayers and wife Men, as they were called j and\nwhen they by the Degeneracy of the Times were,\nas I have faid, brought fo low as to fubmit to Sor-\ncery and Inchantment, they had a vaft Advantage\nover the People, by the good Opinion which the\npeople had of their Sincerity and Honcfty, and thac\nthey would not by any means cheat and impofe\nupon them.\nThus when Errors and damnable Do6lrines in\nReligion are broached and fet on foot among us by\nMen of apparent Sandity in Converfation, Men of\nfevcre Morals, of rigid and auflere Lives, blaraelefs\nand\n\f8o A S Y S T E M\nand mortified Manners, flridly pra6i:ifing the good\nthings which they preach, and who by that Stri6t-\nnefs of Converfation have obtained a Reputation\nin the World, as Men that do nor willingly deceive\nthe People, or that at leail have not a wicked De-\nfign to deceive 3 In fuch cafe, I fay. Error comes\narmed with a fatal and double Power, and its in-\nfluence is much more likely to do Mifchief, the\nHypocrify is the more dangerous, and the People\nmore eafily abufed.\n\\ Who could, in our Days expedt, that Men\nof Morals, Men of unfpotted Lives, and whofe\nCharadters would be fuch as never to fuffer any\nReproach, fhould blemiih all their Reputation,\nwhich that commendable Reftitude of Life had\nobtained for them, with harbouring a horrid\nand deteftable Blafphemy againft the Holy Ghoft.\nit felf, robbing the Son of God of the Equality\nwhich he thought it no Robbery to affiime, and de-\nnying the Godhead of him who is GodhleJJed for ever ?\nBut this is flill too folemn, and I am not alfo\ncome on far enough in Order of time to talk of\nthofe People 5 we fhall meet with them again in\nour Way : for the prefent I muft be content to go\nback to the South and to the Eafl, vifit the pri-\nmitive Times of Sorcery and Witchcraft, and fee if\nwe can find it out, how the Devil and Mankind\ncame to be fo well acquainted as we find they have\nbeen \u2022, for certainly it was not all done at once. Satan,\nwhofe Region is the Air, and whofe Bufinefs is in\nthe Dark, was not immediately correfponded with\nin an open, publick, and avowed manner 5 he did\nnot walk about in Perfon, undifguis'd and open,\ncloathed in the Shapes and Figures of a Devils and\nafting like himfelfj he certainly made his court to\nMankind by fome particular Applications, or they\n. to him 3 for the Learned are not fully agreed who\nmade the firft Advances towards the new Acquain-\ntance,\n\foj M A G I C K. 8\n1\ntancc, and whether the Devil made love firft, or\nhow Mankind found him out.

Whether Mankind finding their Defires to\nbe wicked, infinitely greater than their Capacities,\nand being under an abfolute Ncceflity of fome ex-\notick Helps, fome AfHitances farther and other\nthan they found natural Powers would fupply,\nmade their Application to him ^ according to the\nlaudable Example of my old Friend and good Pa-\ntron in every wicked Contrivance, the late Ho-\nnourable Mv.M\u2014g M\u2014 who (faving that I can-\nnot fay I believed him) told me, that being in an\nextraordinary Streight, and wanting an infallible\nAgent in a particular Piece of Revenge where a\ncertain Female had jilted and infulted him, went\nout into his Garden, three Nights together, juft\nat the moment of Twelve, {that it feems was the cri^\ntical time for Satan to be fpoke with) and called\nhim aloud by his Name, telling him he wanted his\nimmediate Attendance in an Affair of the utmoft\nImportance.\nG Now,\n\fSi A S r S T E M\nNow, I fay, which of thefe two was the Cafe at\nthe Beginning of the Intercourfe between Man and\nhis Mafter, is hard to determine, and would be a\nmofl admirable Difcovery if the Certainty could be\ncome at, in a manner agreeable to the nature\nof the thing, fo as it might be depended upon.\nFor my own Part, if I might give my Opinion, I\nfhould determine it in Favour of the Deml^ and\nthat Mankind were the Agreflbrs, firfl fought the\nAcquaintance, implored his infernal Majefty's Af-\niiftance, propofed a League or Confederacy with him\nofFenfive and defenfive, and vowed themfelves to be\nhis faithful Allies, and to fcrve him to the utmofl:\nof their Power > upon which Application, Satan, as\npowerful Princes often do, yielded to their Im-\nportunities, granted their Petition, took them into\nhis Prote61:ion, and has been their conftant Friend\nand Confederate, on all wicked Occafions, ever\nfince.\nBut there is one Difficulty in the way of this\nOpinion, which indeed gives me a fhock in the\nFaith of it, and feems to intimate that it cannot be\nfo, at leaft that it cannot be abfolutely and fully fo\nin the largeft Senfej and that is, How did Man-\nkind come firft to know that there was fuch a\nCreature as a Demi in Being ? that he was capable\nof giving them Afliftance in the Agency of fuch black\nDefigns as they really wanted his Help in ? that he\nwas a Spirit qualified for his Correfpondence, and\nthat he would upon Application give him the Affi-\nilancc he wanted? And again, if he did know, or\nthat any traditional Memoirs remained with him\nfrom the Records ofPaftAges, of the Agency of the\nDevil with old E've^ or with any of the Antedi-\nluvean Race, and how Satan had managed things in\nthofe Times j yet it does not appear how he found\nthe Way to correfpond, whether he had any Inftru-\naions for his Application, and in a word, how he\nknew\n\fof M A G I C K. %i\nknew where to find the Devil out, and to come to\nthe Speech of him. Thefe Difficulties indeed lie\nin the way of my lall Hypothefis \\ and 'till they\ncan be folved to the general Satisfadion, I doubt\nI muft quit the fuppofed Application of Man to the\nDevil^ and allow xh^l Satan himfelf firft pickt Ac-\nquaintance with him, that the Correfpondence be-\ngan that way, that the Devil offer'd his Service to\nhim, and let him know before-hand how ready\nhe would be to come at his Call, and to aflift him\nupon all Occafions.\nI muft confefs this Suppofition lays the Devil a\nlittle low in your thoughts, depreciates his Cha-\nrafter, and places him beneath the Dignity of his Se-\nraphiclc Original : But it cannot be helped \\ if the\nDevil will make himfelf a Slave, he muft j and if he\nwill be, according to the happy Title of the Chief\nof his Confederates, Servus Servorum^ who can help\nit? The thing explains it felf: Whatever he was at\nfirft, he certainly has been, is, and is like to be the\nmoft obfequious, humble, diligent Devil that ever\nMankind could have had to do with.\nI muft acknowledge that I did not enquire of\nmy Friend juft now named, whether the Devil\ngave his Attendance immediately, and with his ufual\nAlacrity, upon his calling out fo Audibly to him 3\nnot that I ever doubted but that the Devil did waic\nupon him, becaufe 'tis vifible that he has afted as\nif the Devil had been in him ever {ince> but, I fay,\nI ftiould have enquired whether he came at the firft\nCall, for without doubt he called loud enough for\nhim to hear 5 for, as Voice always afcends, the\nVibration moving moft naturally upward, and that\nSatan's particular Rcfidence is faid to lie that\nway, there is no room to queftion but he could\nhear him ^ unlefs, as Elijah faid to the Priefts\nof Baal^ he might be bufy, or afleep, or gone a\nJourney 5 which feldom happens to him, fo as to be\nout of the way of Mifchicf.\nG z N, B.\n\f84 A S T S T E M\nN. B. Here indeed I ought to make fome\nfmall Apology for what 1 happen'd to fay of\nthe Honouraole Perfon I juft now mentioned,\nand \\\\ ho I feemed to fuggeft was not to be\nbelieved; which Exprefiion (he being a Per-\nfon of Honour) \/ oug\/jt to explain^ as I do by\nthefe Prtfents, and in Manner and Form fol-\nlowing, that is to fay, that he is always to be\nbelieved, in all Gates, and relating to all Perfons,\nbut himfelf> but he claiming a Right and\nPrivilege of flandcring himfelf, and being ex-\nceeding fond of being thought wickeder\nthan he is, I vcntur'd, by way of Obfcrvation,\nto fufpc(5t his Veracity, when he talks of his\nFather*s only Sonj knowing that as he has fo\nconftantly boafted of Sins he was never able\nto commit, and that every thing muft be\nfalfe which cannot be true, fo there is no\nCredit to be given to him in that Particular.\nBut in all other Cafes you mud underftand\nmc to acknowledge him for a Man of as nice\na Tafte, and as Itrift an Obferver of Truth\nand Decency, as ever Satan correfponded with j\nwhich publick Acknowledgment Ihope he will\ntake for ample Satisfadion.\nNow, with Pardon for the needful DigrefHon\nabove, I go on with repeating in Subltance what\n1 concluded before, viz. that this Difficulty is fo\ngreat, that I cannot eafily get over il^'viz. to refolve\nwho began the Acquaintance between Satan and\ncur Anccftors of the Eafl, for there it fcems they\nfirfl correfponded.\nNor can I proceed Hiftoricallyin my prefent Un-\ndertaking, without coming to a Certainty in this\nPoint, and 'till it is determined one way or other j\nand for that Rcafon, J think I muft for the pre-\nfent, 'till the Deujil thinks fit to clear himfelf of\nthe Charge, leave it at his Door^ and grant that he\nfound\n\fof M A G I C K. 8;\nfound the Correfpondence fo much to his Advan-\ntage, that is to fay, fo much for the Inrercft of his\nprefent Undertakings of another kind, that he made\nno Scruple of being firii; in the Application 5 that\nhe ft'ioped without Ceremony to make thefirft Vifit,\nand fo began the Treaty afterwards in his own\nName.\nNor has the Devil been very nice in his fubfe-\nqucnt Intimacies, or in the Management of the\nCorrefpondence after it was begun 5 but has on fo\nmany Occalions teftified his Refolution to culti-\nvate the Friendlliip fo (happily for him) begun,\nthat they found him ever after at their Elbow\nwhen they had Occafion for him, and fometimes\nvyhether they had Occafion for him or no 5 whe-\nther he is lefs kind to their Pofterity, let his Friends\nand Confederates of the prefent Age teflify.\nIt is true that fometimes v^e find, or at lead they\ntell us fo, that he is too cunning for his Corre-\nfpondentSi and that when he has drawn them into\nBargains, he is not fo juft to his Word ashefhould\nbe, or as they expededj and this brings fomc Scan-\ndal upon the Acquaintance, as if he was not a faith-\nful Confederate, and that he leaves his Friends of-\nten in the Lurch, as he did the late famous Car-\ntouch in France^ Jonathan Wild in England^ and as\nhe has done the poor Trooper lately at Drefden^\nwho, they fay, he ought to have fccured from the\nOfficers of Juflicej and that when he had killed Mon-\nfieur Halm the Lutheran Minifter, the Devil fhould\nhave given him an invitible Cloak to have carried\nhim off, and not have left him to the Mercy of the\nProteilants, after he had done him fuch an eminent\nPiece of Service.\nBut let us bring things to a light Underftanding,\ndo Satan Juftice, and fet the Saddle upon the right\nDevil, In thefe Cafes, the Qiieftion is not, whether\nthe Devil^ after having made Bargains with thefe\nPeople, did not perform, and was not fo jufl to his\nG }\nWor4\n\fA SYSTEM\nWord as theyexpeaedj but whether he was not as\njuft to his Word as they ought to have expefted?\nFor Example, perhaps in making their Bargains with\nthe Devil^ they exped things to be performed\nwhich it is not in his Power to perform \\ the Mi-\nftake Hes not in Satan himfelf, but in them who\nmake a God of him, and will have him be able to\ndo every thing.\nNow 'tis true that Satan, as he is a Spirit, is\nMagnipotent, but he never was Omnipotent > and\ntherefore there may be, and are, abundance of fine\nthings which fuch People exped of him, which he\nreally not only never promifes, but is not in any\nCondition to perform i and if People will have hitn\ndo what he is not able to do, that is their Fault,\nnot hisi all they can blame him for in that cafe is,\nthat he does not rell them how far he can, or can-\nnot,ierve them 5 and that truly, to give him his Due,\nfeems to be none of his Bufinefsj but like a cunning\nArtificer, who is loth to tell you what he cannot\ndo, but enlarges and expatiates upon his real Abili-\nties > fo the Devily if you are willing to believe he\ncan do thus and thus for you, 'tis enough if he\ndoes but equivocate, and tacitly grant it, without\nengaging to perform 3 but he is not bound to con-\nfefs his Impotence, and own he cannot do it: So\nthcfc People pretend to blame him, whereas in truth\nthey ought only to blame themfelvcs for expecting\nthings of him, that even the Devil himfelf is not able\nto perform.\nThus our late Friend Jonathan^ while he kept\nwithin Bounds, had, no doubt, a faithful and fi'iend-\nly Correfpondence with him. ^ But, faid the Devll^\n^ What would Jonathan have me do? did he ex-\n^ ped I could fave him, when he committed a Felo-\n* ny even with his Fetters on, and while he was\nf in Newgate ? I had been his Protedor in a thou-\n^ fand Rogueries, Things, which if I had not flood\n*? by him, be could never have got over: I had\nhang'd\n\fof MAGIC K. Zj\n^ hangM a hundred and fifty honeft Rogues to fave\n' him 3 every one ofwhichjif 1 hadnothelp'dhimto\n' be too cunning for them, and flopt their Mouths\n' till'twas too late to open them, could have hang'd\n' him and favcd themfelves 5 but he was come to\n' fuch a Pitch at laft, and pufh'd his Fate fo far,\n' that not I, no not the Devil himfelf^ could favc\n* him.\nThe like Plea the Devil made for himfelf, no\ndoubt, in the cafe of his French Favourite Cav\ntouch 'y\n* Had bethought fit, after a thoufand au-\n' dacious Villanies fuccefsfully committed, and an\n' infinite Stock of Treafare amafs'd, for he was\n* grown rich by the Trade > had he thought fit to\n< have left Paris^ and march'd off, either out of the\n' Kingdom, or at lead out of the City where he\n' was fo well known, and fo diligently purfued, I\n* had carried him fafe off. ' But he was obftinately\nand inconfiderately bold > and the Devil is not bound\nto fave thofe that refolve they will be hang'd. Nay,\nif am not mifinformed, the Devil himfelf told him,\nhe would be taken if he flaid in Paris \\ and added,\nthat the Search after him was fo hot, and fuch\nRewards promifed, and he fo well known, that if\nhe, Satan himfelf, was fo perfeftly defcribed, and\nfo hotly purfued, he fhould certainly be difcover'd.\nTho' by the way, I would have you take that Part\nonly ad referendum^ as the Men of Bufinefs call it.\nNow it is an unreafonable thing that Men fhould\nmake a Bargain with either Man or Devil for more\nthan they are able to perform, and then pretend to\nblame them for Non-Performance j and therefore\na certain noble Lord, now in Exile, (whom they\ncharge with contrading with Satan for fome Parti-\ncular, in favour of his late Dumhlane Enterprife,\nand which the Devil has, it feems, faiPd him in)\nought not, as they fay he does, to blame the De-\nvil^ who really could do no more for him than he did.\nG 4 Having\n\f88 A S Y S T E M\nHaving then brought it to this Conclufion, that\nthe Devil has been really firft in the Confederacy,\nthat Satan made the Acquaintance, and that Man\nneither knew how to come at the Devil^ nor fo\nmuch as knew originally that there was any fuch\nthing as a Devil in Being, it would add to our more\nperfeft underflanding of the whole Matter, if we\ncould be informed in what manner the Acquain-\ntance begun.\nThe firfl; Attack the Devil made upon our Mo-\nther Eve^ we have had fully defcribed. Sacred Hi-\nHory relates the Fa6tj and honed:, grave Mr. Milton\nhas given us the Particulars as dillmdly, and in as\nlively Colours, as if he had been at the Conference,\nheard the Courtfhip, and how cunningly the Devil\nmanaged > with what Addiefs he iniinuated into her\nwcakeft Part, and how entirely he conquer'd her\nVirtue, her Obedience, her Senfe of Religion,\nbrought her to forget the Command that fhe had\nbut juft learned to remember j and to facrifice her\nSoul, and all her Pofterity, to her Appetite: I fay,\nMr. Milton has done it in fo lively a manner, that\nit feems plain, that tho' Solomon could not under-\nHand the way of a Man with a Maid, but placed\nit among the things that were too wonder-\nful for him y Milton feems not to be at a Lofs to\ndefcribe the way of the Devil with a Woman,\nNow, I fay, we have a diftind Account how\nthe Devil made the firft Attack upon Eve in Pa-\nradife^ but how he picked Acquaintance with the\nSons of A^c^Z? after the Deluge, and in what man-\nner, or upon what Occafion that was begun, we\nare utterly at a lofs about.\nNor have we any hiHorical Account who were\nthe Perfons who entertained the fiiil Correfpon-\ndence with him, or upon what Occafion 5 nothing\nappears upon Record to give us the leaft Light\ninto it, other than this, that we find the EtFefts of\n\fof M A G I C K. 8p\nan Invifible De'vil in Ham or Cbam^ one o? Noah's\nSons, and in Canaan his Grandfonj hue ic is not\nthe invifible Devil that I am enquiring after, but an\nappearing converfible Dxmon or Evil Spirit, who\nalTuming human Shape, or at lead Voice, and in-\ntelligible Operations, could fupply the Office of the\nDe'vil in aflifting Mankind in the fevcral Exigencies\nof their Affairs, when any kind of infernal Work\nwas upon their Hands.\nThis, I fay, is the Devil I am enquiring after\n>\nand as I would fain bring Mankind and him to be\nacquainted together in a decent and regular man-\nner, I mud confefs I am at a great Lofs for want\nof the Particulars, as well of Perfons, as of the Cir-\ncumftances in which thofe Perfons were concerned.\nHowever fince that Part cannot be entred any\nfarther into, or at leaft not fo far as to make a full\nDiicovery, we muft take up with fo much as we\nfind upon Record, and this may perhaps be enough\nto fatisfy us that fo it was.\nThe Story of Job^ according to the facred Chro-\nnology, and by comparing it with other Accounts\nof things, appears to be very antientj even fo old\nas to be in a very few Years after Abraham -y for\nEliphaz the femanite could not, by Calculation, be\nmany Removes from Efau^ and I\/hmael-y and Job be-\ning at that Time an old Man, no lefs than a hundred\nYears old, he might probably be alive within the\ntime o^Japhet^ one of the Sons of Noah y for 'tis\nthought Job was above a hundred Years old when\nhis firft Sorrows came upon him.\nNow in the time of Job^ 'tis evident the Devil\nhad made his vifible Appearances upon Earth, and\namong the Sons of GOD too i for he appeared\nbefore the Lord at the time, as is fuppofed, of a\nfolemn Service or Sacrifice. What his Bufinefs was\nthere, and on what Occafion he came, does not lie\nbefore me oji the prcfent Occafion.\n7 In\n\fpo A S Y S T E M\nIn the next place, the Devil not only had pcr^\nfonally appeared, but it feems plain from the Text,\nwhen God had given Job into his Hands, that is to\nfay, had given him Commiflion to fall upon and af-\nflid him, and that he was gone out from the Pre-\nfence of God, that he immediately fet his humaa\nas well as elementary Inflruments at work j that he\nraifed a Storm of Wind, from or in the Wilder-\nnefs, and blew the Houfe down upon Johh Sons\nand Daughters \\ that he brought Thunder and\nLightning upon the Flocks, and burnt up the poor\nSheep, and the Servants that look'd after them:\nThis was nothing but what, as a Devil and a Prince\nof the Air, might be expelled from him: but that\nwas not all ; he raifed War upon him j the Chaldeans\nfrom one fide, (the North) and the Sahsans from ano-\nther fide, (the Eaft) made out their Armies and came\nupon him,andpiundcr'd him 5 the firfl carried away\nthe Camels, and the other the Oxen.\n'Tis certain thofe Nations were at Peace with\nJob before, and his Servants fed unmolefted by them\nand in their Neighbourhood, 'till the Devil took\nupon him to break the Peace, and excite them to\ninfult Job and fall upon his Subflancc. How came\nthis to pafs 3 and what had Job done to any of\nthem, to move them 'to ufe Violence with him? I\nmake no queflion but the Devil went to them, and\ntold them God had fent him to order them in his\nName to ravage the Lands and carry away the\nGoods of Job -J,\nthat God had deflined him to Mi-\nfery and Poverty, and had given his Eflate to them,\nand therefore it was lawful for them to fall upon\nand deftroy him and his Family 5 and to give them\na Sign, as I faid before, and that they might know\nhe came with a CommifHon, they ihould fee he\nwould go and fend down Fire from Heaven and de-\nftroy his Sheep > and if they would not carry off the\nCamels and the Oxen, he would do the like by thofe\nalfb. This3\n\fof M A G I C K.\nThis, and the Bait of Plunder, was enough to ani-\nmate thofe Nations againfl poor Joh^ and fo they\ncame immediately and did as the BqvU dire6tcd.\nThis feems to me to be the firft vifible Appea-\nrance of the Devil among the Sons of Noah^ in the\nPoft-diluvean Ages. I will not fay his Acquaintance\nbegun here, tho' if I fhould fuppofe it did, I do not\nfee that I could be contradidcd by any authcntick\nVouchers from Hiftory. Indeed it was a plaufible\nOccafion enough, for it was apparently a Favour\nbeflowed on the Saheans and on the Chaldeans^ to\ngive them Job's Goods meerly for fetching : and\nthis, for ought we know, may be the Reafon that\nthe firft Magicians that we read of any where,\nwere among thofe two Nations, 'viz. Chaldeans\n^nd (Jrabiam) Saheans -y nor can I doubt but that the\nDevil having made his Acquaintance firft here, kept\nhis Hold and Intereft amongft them upon account\nof the good Offices he had done them, and perhaps\nmight do them on many other Occafions.\nNow, tho' I would not be poficive where there\nis the leaft Uncertainty, being mighty cautious (as\nI am at prefent afting in the Capacity of an Hi-\nftorian)of doing the Devil any Wrong or Injury 5 fo\nI enter my Caveat too againftanObjecSbion here,'i;\/z.\nthat if this be not the firft time that any Man gives\nan Account of Satan's Appearance, and that this\nwas not the firft of his Pranks which he played\nupon Mankind after the Flood, let them fhew us\nanother before it, if they cans i^ay, I believe the\nDevil himfelf cannot tell us any one Time or Place,\nor any other Occafion, on which he ever fhowed\nhimfelf, or perhaps durft ihow himfelf, in a vifible\nAppearance in the World, I mean after the De-\nluge.\nNor is it eafie to be determined, what Shape,\nwhat Cafe of Flefti and Blood, or (as I might fay\nwith more Propriety) what fceming Flelli and\nBlood\n\fA S T S r E M\nBlood he appear'd drefs'd in at that timej nor will\nI take upon me to guefs what Figure he made,\n\u2022when he appeared among the Sons of God, and\nwhether ihcy knew him or not 5 that is to fay,\nknew who he was, and on what occafion he ap-\npear'd there > whether Job was among them or nor,\n(for he was doubtlefs one of the Sons of God, and\nthe Text owns him as fuch j my Servant Joh\\ for\nSon. and Servant I take there to have the fame Sig-\nnification j) and whether the fhort Difcourfe which\nit is faid there the Lord held with the Arch-Ene-\nmy of his Servant was audible and articulate, and\nwhether the reft heard it or no j all thefe Difficul-\nties I leave, as the Learned fay, to another Oppor-\ntunity, that is to fay^ bccaufe I am not able to fay\none Word to them at this.\nCHAP. IV.\nOf what Shades the Devil affiimd in his firfi\nAppearances to the Magicians, and others^\nin the F'trfl Ages of the World \\ and whe-\nther He isy or has been^ allowed to ajfume a\nHuman Shape^ or no.\nAS I have ingenuoufly acknowledged in my laft\nChapter, that 1 can give you no Account of\nwhat Drefs or Shape the Devil appear'd in, when\nhe prefented himfelf among the Sons of God, as\nnoted in the firll Chapter of Job^ or whether he\nwas vifible to any elfe but his Maker 5 fo I am\nequally uncertain in what Figure he made his firft\nAppearances afterwards, among his own Acquain-\ntance and Servants, when he was introduced.\nIt mufl therefore fuffice to tell you, that how-\never it v\/as manag'd, w^e find there was certainly\nan\n\fof M A G J C K, |,g\nan Intelligence carry'd on, a Corrcfpondencc main-\nrain'd, and what was not perform'd PeiTonally,\nwas done by Inchantmcnts, which we call Sorcery;\nby Voices and by Dreams, or by Apparition in\nfiich Shapes and Poflnres, as Satan, for Reafons of\nState, thought fit to take upon himfelf for the\nOccafion.\nSome have doubted, whether the Devil is em-\npower'd to take up any human Shape, or to appear\nin the Figure of a Man; and they argue that it does\nnot feem confiftcnc with the Goodncfs of the great\nFather of Mankind, to fuffer the Arch-Enemy of\nhis Creatures to go about in fuch a Difguife, fo\ndangerous, and that might be fo fatal to him^ for\nthat he would be always in danger of being de-\nceived to his Hurt, that he could never be fafej\nbut that as the Scripture diredts us to be courteous\nto Strangers, becaufe fome by being fo had enter-\ntain'd Angels ; fo ic would make us be ihy, and a-\nfraid of Strangers, for that we fhould be always afraid\nwe might receive the Devil into our Houfes, and\nefpeciaily into our Friendfhip, and Familiarity.\nAnd hence I believe came the foolifh em.pty No-\ntion, tho' fuch as it is impcfHble to root out of the\nFancies of Men, viz. that the Devil cannot ap-\npear without his ck)ven Foot; of which I fhall fay\nnothing here, but that it is a thing fo ridiculous as\nto merit no Notice, either now or at any other\ntime.\nTho' there may be many things Hiid for this Opi-\nnion, and particularly to that Part which relates to\nthe Safety of Mankind, in cafe of the feveral Dif-\nguifcs that the Devil may appear in, yet I cannot\nexclude the Devil from the Privilege of patting\non our Clothes fomctimes, and that too perhaps oft-\nner than we may think he does; and that he appears\nin fuch a Shape too, oftner than we may believe he\ndoes. As to the Danger of it I may fpcak of than\nby it felf. I\n\f5>4 A SYSTEM\nI have taken it for granted in my lafl Chapter,\nthat in the firft Acquaintance between Mankind\nand the Evil Spirir, after the Deluge, Satan was the\nAggrefTor J\nthat he made his Application to them\nfirft, made his Propofals of Affillance and Help, in\nthe Cafes wherein he knew they wanted his Cor-\nrefpondencej and I ihall add, that he perhaps\nrais'd difficult perplex'd Cafes in the World, on\npurpofe to prepare the Way for his rendring him-\nfelfufefuL\nWe are come now to the Manner, I mean How#\nand in What Way the cunning Manager made his\nfirft Addrefs to Mankind. It is true, we are\nfomething deficient in the Hiflory of this firft\nTranfadion, becaufe we do not yet know, nor\ncan eafily find out, who was his firft Correfpon-\ndent in the World 5 but if you will take what has\nbeen, by what is, and judge of his firft Method,\nby his fubfequent Pra6tice, 1 think I may give you\nroom to make a fair Judgment. Nor do I think\n'tis an improper way of determining the Point,\nfince as Satan found the firft Step fuccefsful, 'tis pro-\nbable he found no occafion to alter his Meafures;\nand tho' differing Circumftances of Place and Per-\nfons may make him vary a little as he fees Occa-\nfion, yet I have I think a great deal of reafon to\nfuppofe that the general rule of his Pradice is much\nthe fame, and that he proceeds upon the fame foot\nwith Mankind in all t\\gtz^ and on all Occafions,\nmutatis mutandis^ as he finds the Circumftances of\nthe People the fame, or not the fame.\nTake then the DeviPs firft Method with Man-\nkind to be grounded upon his ovm Experience in\nhis Antediluvean Practices with their Anceftorsj\nupon his Knowledge of their Prefent Circum-\nftances, I mean Prefent at the time after the Flood,\nyou muft allow Satan to have fo much Cunning ia\nhim, as to be able, without the leaft Hefitation, to\nknow\n\fof M A G I C K. 5>y\nknow what was the beft Method to come about\nthe Man, and how to compafs him> and for that\nreafon, I fay, I do not allow him to have made any\nChange in his Meafures.\nThe firfl Method then, that I fuppofe the\nDevil took to make hi5; Acquaintance with Man-\nkind was by the way of Dreams 5 and here I fliall\ngo back fo far as to fuggcft, that he put Canaan^\nNoah'% Grandfon, upon intoxicating the good Patri-\narch his Grandfather with Wine: for I join with a\nlate Opinion, that it was Canaan^ not \/\/\"^w, that was\nthe Occaiion of it 5 tho' Ham was guilty of trium-\nphing over the old Man, when he was overcome,\nand expofing him, as far as lay in him, to his mode-\nller Brethren.\nSuppofe then young C^\u00bb^,^\u00bb very bufy, helping and\naflifling his GrandhrJi.-i, in planting and dreffing\nthe Vines after the Flood, and in gathering the\nFruit} take then the following Obfervations upon\nthofe Circumftances in particular.\nFirjl^ I cannot come into that foolifh Notion,\nthat Noah did not underltand the Nature of the\nVine, or the Srrengeh of the Juice, when the\nGrapes were prefs'd, and the Wine ran out, and that\nhe drank it ignorantly^ I fay, I cannot come into\nthat Opinion : For Noah^ who had no doubt preach'd\nagainft the Vices of the Antediluvian World, and\nagainft Drunkennefs among the reft, muft certainly\nknow the Ufe of the Vine, and the Abufe of it\ntooj how oi^t did he come to plant it at all, and\nto prefs the Juice out for Drinking it at all ?\nGen. ix. 20. Noah began to he an Husbandman^ and\nhe planted a Vineyard.\nz I . u^nd he drank of the Wine^ and was drunken.\nSecondly., It does not feem, that the time o^ Noah^s\nDrunkennefs was upon the preffing of the Gripes,\nor the prefling the firft Grapes of his new Planta-\ntion 3 ic muft certainly be a confiderable time after\nhis\n\f5<J A S r S T E M\nMs planting them, and after his firfl making of\nWine. For tho' 'tis very probable that he planted the\nVine^ immediately after the Flood, and the Text\nfeems to intimate as much > yet 'tis evident it muft\nb< many Years after that, when he fell into the\nfnare of Drunkcnnefs. For Canaan^ who was then\na Man grown, was not Born at the coming out\ncf the Ark^ and there muft be at leaft twenty\nor thirty Years between that time and the Fa6t.\nFor if Canaan had not been Major, had not been\nat Man's Eftatc, he would not in probability have\nbeen curs'd by his Grandfather, as a Principal in\nthe Crime, as it is evident he was : For it does not\nfeem (hat he was curfcd fo particularly, as an Ac-\nccfTary only, or for the meer Offence of his Fa-\nther, nor would it have been Righteous in Noah\nto have done fo. But as he is fo warmly fallen up-\non, and {o particularly by the old Patriarch, in his\nAnathema^ 'tis very probable he was a Principal in\nthe Fa6t of abufing him.\nSuppofe then, J fay, young Canaan bufy in af-\nfifting his Grandfather in planting and drefling the\nVines, and in prefling the Fruit > the Devil takes\nthis for a Handle, and fubtly makes Canaan\ndream. (For I'll grant, with Mr. Milton^ that the\nDevil had, from the Beginning, the Art of whif-\npering to him in his Sleep, as that Author makes\nhim do to Eve in Paradife, and thereby making\nhim dream of any thing he pleas'd.) Take him then\nwhifpcring to Canaan^ that he fhould make his\nGrandfather drunk with the Wine, and that he\nihould be able to do what he pleas'd with him\never after j infinuating, that the EfFe6b of it would\nbe to make his Grandfather have a greater AfFe6bi-\non to hmi than to any of the reft of his Grand-\nchildren. This is not improbable, becaufe the De-\nvil always Tempts with the Expc6lation of fome\napparent Good.\nOthers\n\fof M A G I C A. 5,7\nOthers fuggeft, that Noah having reprov'd and\nreproach'd Canaan for Tome Crimr, and perhaps\ncau^'d him ro be corre6ted for it, the Devil cook\nhold of his Refenrment, (which, by the wiy, is not\nmuch iinhke a Devil,) and proposM this method of\nRevenge t^ him in a Dream j as if he had dream'd\nthat he hid prcvaiTd over his Grandfath-r, by per-\nfuadmg him to dr-nk himf If drunk, and had there-\nby made him expofe himfelf in a beaftly manner,\n'till he became the Ridicule and Jeft of the whole\nFamily, which by that time was very numerous 3 and\nthat Canaan^ pleafcd with the lively Reprefentation\nof his Grandfather's Shame, refclv'd (the Devil\nprompting him to it in other fubfequent Dreams)\nif poffible, to give himfelf the Sacisfa(5lion of\nbringing it to paf?, and to perfuade the old Maa\nto drink himfelf Drunk, the next time he came to\naffift him in the Bufinefsj and that accordingly he\ndid fo, and prevailed\n.\nWhether Satan did it thus, or by any other me-\u00bb\nthod of Infinuation, we are not furcj but it is very\nprobable it was by a Dream : Nor is it clear to me,\nthat the Devil had ever any other way but by\nDream or Apparition, to come at the intelligent\nFaculties of Man. 'Tis evident he does fuggeft\nEvil} now he mufl do it fleeping, or wakings if\nfleeping, it muft be by a Dream, in which he docs\nbut imitate the good Spirit, which, as the Scripture\nfays plainly, and gives a multitude of Inftances of\nit, opens the Underftandings of Men m the Night\nVifions, and feals their Inftruflions: Nor is it a\nnew Pra6fcice of Satan to mimick and imitate his\nMaker, in the Meafures and Operations of his\nWifdom v\/ith Mankind.\nBut be that as it will, we are fiu'e the Devil does\ncommunicate his malicious Propofals of Mifchief\nto Mankind 3 you have two eminent Examples of\nH it\n\fA SYSTEM\nIt in Scripture, which are too plain, and too dircft\nto my purpoie here, to admit any Difputej firft, in\nthe Cafe of David^ and his Projed of numbring the\nPoeple, 'ris fiiidexprefly, i C hron.xxi. i. Satan ?noved\nDavid to number the People. \"W here, bythe way, tho' it\nwas his Sin, yet by it we gain a piece of Information,\nhow prodigioufly populous the Tribes were at\nthat time, *viz. that there were fifteen hundred and\nfeventy thoufand fighting Men in only ten of the\nTribes > an mcredible Number to inhabit fo fmall a\nSpot of Ground as the Land of Canaan^ befides\nWomen and Children : But that by the way.\nThe fecond Example, which renders it out of all\ndoubt that Satan has Accefs to the Thoughts of\nMen, is that of Judas^ John xiii. i. S^tanput it into the\nNeart of Judas to betray Chrift. Now, I fay as above,\ntiiis mull be done deeping, or waking j if fleeping,\nit muft be by Dreams > if waking, it mud be by\nVoice, PofTeffion, or Apparition. We fhall coniidcr\nthem ail in their Place.\nIt is probable that the firft Method the Devil\ntook in the World was by Dream > as for Poflef-\nfion, we do not meet with it very early; as to Voice\nand Apparition, we take them to be all fubfequent,\nand the Effe6b of a long Acquaintance : as i.naong\nMen there are fevcral degrees of Communiciirion\nwith one another, after Men have a Perfonal Knov\/-\nledge and Acquaintance, before it conies up to \/\/;\/\/-\nmcicy and FrierJJhtp.\nDream then being the firft way of Accefs, or by\nwhich the Devil found the way into the Manj\nthere is no room to doubt but by this Method he\nfound means alfo to infufe into his Mind an infi-\nnite Variety of corrupt Imaginations, wicked De-\nfires, and abhorred Conclufions and Refoliitions,\nwith fome ridiculous, fooliih, and abfurd things at\nthe fame time.\nThus\n\fof M A G I C K. 95,\nThus I cannot think but the Devil firft put it\ninto the Hearts of the Men of the old World to\ngo about that ridiculous piece of Work (as I obferv'd\nit to be before) (^f building of Babel -y firfl by fill-\ning their Thoughts with daily Terrors and Appre-\nhenfions of another Inundation, thronging their\nfleepmg Imaginations with Fancies of new Rains to\noverflow them 5 by which, every time they had\nany hafty Showers which raised the Water of the\nRivers or Brooks to what we call a Land-Flood,\nthey would be immediately alarm'd as if another\nDeluge was a coming upon them, and that they were\nimmediately to be drown'd.\nThus railing the Vapours in their Hypocon-\ndrias, they were every Night dreaming that they\nheard it Thunder, that they faw heavy Rains, and\nthat the Brooks and Rivers fwell'd, or as we fay\nin our common Difcourfe on fuch Occafions, the\nWaters were out-y in Confequence of this, he purs\nthem upon confidering of Means for their own Se-\ncurity, and then they dream every Night of Me-\nthods: One while they are for building another\nArk, another time for building a Thoufand, that\nis to fay, an Ark for every Family, or Patriarchate^\nor Tribe 3 one time this foolilli thing, and ano-\nther time that 5 and perhaps many Men dreaming\n!\non many feveral Methods, till at lafl: they bring\ni their lleeping Cogitations to a waking Confukation 5\nI and there they refolve upon the meaneit, empiyefl:,'\n\\ and mod inconfillent Projeft, that ever any Body\ni' of Men formM in their Heads: And which, if the\ni\n\"'Devil had not been in them, and drawn them into\n;i it, as I fay, meerly to impofe upon, and expofe\nthem even to their own Ridicule, could never\n'have come into their Heads, I mean the Building\nof BabeL\nH z If\n\fioo A S Y S T E M\nIf the Devil did excite that foolifh Imagination,\nhe nnuii: do it as he was a meer Devil, to lliow\nhis Malice, to put them upon doing fome-\nthing extremely Ridiculous, and which fliould at\nlad expofe them to their own Refentments on the\nMadnefs and Folly of it 5 or, which 1 rather think,\nhe bewilder'd their Imaginations, without any im-\nmediate Profpe<5l, other than this, that he knew it\nwould end in fome ridiculous Undertaking, either\nvery foolijh^ or very wicked -y not knowing which it\nwould be, and perhaps not much caring, (b it\nwould be but provoking to their Maker, and what\nniight any way bring his Difpleafure upon them.\nAnd here, by the way, I cannot but obferve, that\nthe Method, God in his Providence was pleas'd to\ntake with Mankind, upon their entring upon that\nfoolilh Piece of Work, was the mildcft and kindeft\nthat could be imagin'd, and the mod to their In-\ntereft, calculated for their Good, evidently iiTuing\nfo j and that much more than letting them go on in\ntheir Madnefs would have been.\nHad Heaven thought fit to have wink'd at the\naudacious Attempt, and to have let them go on\nv\/ith it, as far as their own Ignorance and Obfti-\nnacy would have guided them, 'till by the immenfe\nCircle of the firft Stages of the Building they had\nform'd an Afcent higher than any thing of its kind\ncould be fuppos'd to Hand j yet they mult have ftop'd\n^\nat lad, it mud have ended fomewherej the time\nwould have come at length, that as they had call'd\na Council about the nrft Building of it, they would\nhave call'd another, with a go to now^ fhall we leave\noff this mad Piece of Work.?

When he went\nhome among the People, he fail'd not tagive his\nJudgment of the terrible Appearance in the Air,\nand told them pofitively it portended a great\nDrought and Heat in the approaching Summer\nj\nto which he added, as a Suggeltion only, that he\nhad great reafon to believe it would be attended\nwith\n\f10 g A S r S T E M\nwith a Famine, and perhaps the Famine might be\nfollow'd with a Plague > infinuating, that if the\nFamine was not attended with a Plague among his\nown Countrymen, as he had faid it would, it was\nthen likely it would appear firft in Perfta^ their\nNeighhouring Kingdom, and perhaps it might af-\nterwards fpread among them.\nThis terrible Predidion, delisrerM with the Au-\nthority of one whom they had the Venerable Opi-\nnion of before as a Magician^ and one that could\nforetel Events of things, gave the People an Alarm,\nand alfo their King with them, to whom the\nNews of the Prediction was foon carry'dj but the\nMagician conceal'd entirely from their Knowledge\nthe Manner of his obtaining his Information, fothat\nit came to them on the fingle Authority of his own\nJudgment.\n: It happcn'd as a Confirmation of his Prediction,\nthat after rhe Meteor ccas'd to appear, and the\nSpring Seafon advanc'd, an extreme hot Seafon\ncame on, with a long Drought follovving for feve-\nral Weeks, which began very much to burn up\nthe Fruits of the Earthy immediately the People\nremembrin^ the Words of the Magician^ and find'\ning fo much of what he had faid prove true, it\nput them in a great Confternation from the Ap-\nprehcnfi >n of what, according to his Account, was\nyet to follow.\nIt happened fome time after this, that the King\nof the Country dreamed a Dream, which much\nperplex'd him, and all the Magicians and Allrolo-\ngers were fent for, to interpret the faid Dream; but\n^^U was not fent for, which grieved him much,\nthinking that he v\/as notefteem'd enough among the\nPrinces of the Country, and that he fear'd his having\nforetold the portentous Events of the late Meteor,\nwhich were not yet dsiermin'd by the time that he\npre-\n\fof M A G I C K 105,\npredifted, he was negle<5led, as a Pcrfon that would\nnot give any good Incerpretation of the King's\nDream. However, when ^\/\/ faw that the Magi^\ndans and Southravers, who were fent for, gave the\nKing no Satisfadion ; for they were confounded\nin their Accounts, and difFer'd one from another,\nand the King was To angry, that he was about to\ncommand them all to be put to Death 5 with this\nhe was comforted again, and refolv'd to apply him-\nfelfto the Palm-tree, to fee if he could furniih him-\nfelf with any Inceljigencc fuitable to what he de-\nfir'd> in which Cafe he would foon let the King\nknow, that though the reft of the Magicians could\nnot anfwer his Dcfire, he could fupply that Dz?tQ:%\nand fo he ftiould gain more Reputation, than if he\nhad been fent for with the reft.\nUpon this, he retires himfclf as ufual into the\nDefart as before, and comes to the Spot where he\nhad the firft Vifion. Here he furrounds the Tree\nfifteen times, and every time calls the Speftre by\nhis appointed Name three times over, and as loud\nas his utmoft extended Voice would admits when,\naccording to DireiSli'on, he laid hirafelf down with\nhis Face to the South, (hut his Eyes, and obfequioufly\nwaited till he fell afleep, which was not lon^:\nNo fooner had his Senfes forfaken him, whetlier\ndoz'd with any infernal Charm or otherwife, the\nAccount does not fpecify: But, I fay, no fooner\nwas he afleep, but the Vifton appeared to his\nFancy, and asked him what was the Occafion of\nhis coming.\nHe anlwer'd, That the King had dreamed a\nDream, and had told it to the Magicians, whom he\nfent for in order to have them interpret his Dream,\nbut that he had not been fent for, which was at firil\nvery grieving to him j but that upon further En-\nquiry he found that the Magicians had given the\nKing\n\f116 A s r S t E M\nKing no Satisfaaion 5 and that it had highly pro-\nvoked him, fo that he was going once to have\nkilled ihemall, and that now he was glad he was not\ncalled 5 but that if he could now put him into a\nCondition to interpret the King's Dream, it would\nleftablifli his Reputation for ever, not with the\nKing only, but with the whole Country, for\nthat he was fure to be exalted to the higheft\nPitch of Honour that the King could give 5 and\nbefides, all the People would adore him as\none that had Intelligence among the Gods; fo\nthat he fiiould be had in the higheil Reverence\nimaginable.\nThe Vifion aflured him that he could not only\nqualify him to interpret the King's Dream, but that\nhe had made the King dream it on fet Purpofe to\nto give him Occafion to interpret and explain it j\nand fo he let him into the Particulars of what it\nwas the King had dreamed 5 and th^t the Dream\nbeing thus direfted by him, he likewifc could di-\nreft him to fuch an Interpretation as none but\nhimfelf could put upon it> and fo he at once\ntold him both what the King dreamed, and what\nInterpretation he ftiould give of it 5 adding, that he\nwould yet do greater things for him than thofe j\nfor that if he had Occafion to recommend himfelf\nto the King, or to any other Perfon of Note, he\nwould put it into his Power at any time, not only\nto tell the King what his Dream fignified, but\nfliould make the King Dream any thing that he\nthought fir; fo that he fhould be able to fay to\nthe King, To-morrow Night a deep Sleep fliall\ncome upon you, and you ihall dream fo and fo,\nwhich Dream fball portend fuch and fuch things\nto you and your People.\nuiU was exceedingly raifed in his Thoughts upon\nfuch a Motion as this, and you will not wonder\nthat\n\fof M A G I C K. Ill\nthat he cxprefled, tho' in his Sleep or Vilion, his\nhigh Satisfadlion at fuch a Favour 5 and from that\ntime he entertained a conftant Correfpondence with\nthis Vifion or Apparition, not being aware, or per-\nhaps not concerned- that he was all this while con-\nverfing with the Devil^ and that the new Friend-\nship he had engaged in, was neither lefs or more\nthan an immediate Correfpondence with Hell.\nWe have a Parallel Story to this, and almoffc of\nthe fame kind, of the Devil and an old Arahiayi\nin the Court of a Pharaoh King of Mgypt^ upon\nthe Appearance of a Comet or Blazing Star, and\nof which I {hall give an Account in its Place.\nNor was this any thing extraordinary in thofe\nTimes i 'twas natural to Satan's way of conver-\nfing with Mankind, who had frequently midnight\nThoughts injcded to them by a fupernitural\nPower, that is, by the evil Spirit, witl out their\nknowing by what Hand they were injedbed 5 and\nthe Devil was able moft certainly to give the In-\nterpretation of thofe Thoughts which he had been\nthe Occafion of.\nThis whole Affair, tho' remote in Time, I\ngive this Account of, to fuggeft from it the proba-\nble Method which Satan has taken from the Be-\nginning to inlinuate himfelf into Mankind j and, as\n1 faid before, to begin the Acquaintance 5 which,\nwhen once begun, he took particular Care to\ncultivate to all the degrees of Intimacy poffibles\nfo that in few Years, fuch People have been as in-\ntimate with the Devil^ tho' perhaps not thoroughly\nknowing who it was they converfed with, as they\ncould defire to be.\nBy this Method he found Opportunities, upon all\nOccafions, to bring Men to convcrfe freely and\nfully with him J and as he often furnifhed them with\nMaterials and Subjcfts to amufe the reft of the\nWorld\n\fMt. A S Y S r E M\nWorld with, he was always able to oblige them ifi\nthe utmoft manner: feeing nothing could be more\nto the Satisfa6tion of fuch People than the raifing\ntheir Reputation in their Proftffion, and giving a\nSanftion or Confirmation to their Predidions.\nI know it is doubted by many among the Learn-\ned, whether the Devil has himfclF any Knowledge\nof Futurity, and whether he can pTedi6t or fore-\ntell Events, or any thing future and to come 5 and\nthis very Vifion or Apparition, fuppofing it to be\ntrue, verifies the Opinion 5 for he put the Alter-\nnative feveral times upon him, thai fo if he mils'd\ngiving a right Interpretation in one thing, he\nmight be fure in another 5 and if one Conjc\u00a3l:ure\nShould mifs, another might hit, as you fee in the\nConflruftion of the appearing Body of Fire.\nBut the Quedion is needlefs here 5 for if it be\nin the Devil's Power to injfft the Subje6t of a\nDream, and put Thoughts into the Heads ofthofe\nthat are afleep, 'tis then mod: certainly fo far in his\nPower to give the Interpretation of thofe Thoughts\nto whom he pleafes to grant fuch a Favour 5 feeing\nthe whole Scheme may be a meer Cheat and De-\nlufion of the evil Spirit, on purpofe to form another\nDelufion, namely, that of bringing in a Conjurer\nor Dreamer of Dreams to interpret it. This is in-\ndeed a true Piece of the Legerdemain of Hell, and\nit may be called, the Devil turned Juggler \\ for *tis fa-\nin the very Abftra6^, and nothing elfe.\nAll this is no great matter for Satan to do, if we\ngrant him only the Power of infufing Midnight\nThoughts into the Mind, which we have good\nreafon to believe he is able enough to perform,\nand yet have no great matter of Craft in him\nneither, not fo much as we are ordinarily willing to\nfuppofe the Devil is Mafter of. The Variety is in-\nfinite, that I might fuppofe the Devil is capable to\naa\n\fof M A Q 1 C K. itj\nkEt among his Difciples by this piece of Cunning,\nif wc do but allow him fo much ; and I cannot\nbut fay 'tis very clear to nie, that the Devil has a\nfecret Power to injeft innumerable things into our\nHeads by Dream, and to make us dream almoft\nwhat, and when he pleafes, fo as may beft ferve\nhis Occafions, and Ours too.\nAnd his Advantages arc very great by this Fraud,\nfor be gives his Inllrument fuch an undoubted Re-\nputation for a Revcalcr of Secrets arid art Interpre-\nter of Dreams, that nothing can be like it. Not\nDaniel himfclf, who they faid had an excellent Spi-\nrit, arid that the Spirit of the Holy Gods vas in\nhim, could do more 5 for by this Means, the South-\nfayer would be able to tell the Dreamer what it\nwas he dreamed of, as well as what it fignified.\nIf any Man doubt that the Devil can, as I fay^\ninfufe midriight Thoughts, and whifper Suggefti-\nonsby Dream of any kind to the Mind, I refer him\nto My. Milton^ whofhews us the Devil in the Shape\nof a Toad crept clofe to Eve^s Ear in her decpeft\nSlumbers, and injedbing luftful or loofe and wandering\nThoughts into her cballe Mind, (Ifaychaftc, forfuch\nit was without doubt before) and making her dream\nwith Pleafure of the Sin which he refolved to allure\nher to commit the next Day, and fo prepare her\nfor the Crime, which till then her very Soul ab-\nhorred.\nThis granted^ arid the Devil being allowed fucK\nan Advantage over Mankind, whether good or bad %\nI cannot wonder either that he makes ufe of it at\nall, or that he makes life of it in fuch a frequent\nand extraordinary manner is to bewitch and in-*\nfpire his Friends and Favourites : Nor that thofe\nFriends or Favourites of his, whom he does thus\naflift, make fuch corrupt ufes of it as vl^e find they\ndo,^ for infinuating an Opinion' of themfelves into*\nthe Wotld : for we find prcfehtlj') when this Famt-\nl liarity\n\fJI4 A s r s r E M\nliarity is once obtained with the Evil Spirit, and\nthey begin to a6t by his Inftruftion, the firft thing\nthey do is, to put a Fraud upon Mankind, and\nmake the World beUeve that all they did was from\nHeaven J that they fpoke by Infpiration and Reve-\nlation, and that their Intelligence was immediately\nfrom the Gods> to fpeak in the Language of thofc\nTimes.\nThus ^^\/^^\u00bb2 tells the King o\u00a3 Maah^ he eanfpea^\nnothing but as God fhall command him> whereas\n*tis plain, had not the Devil been reHrained fron^\ndireding him at that time, he would as heartily\nhave curfed Ifrael as he blefled them, and fo havr\ngained the Rewards of his Office, which was the\nWages of Divination J but he eonfefles the Impo-\ntency ofhis Art, when he found a Lock put upon his\nTongue, and the Key in the Hand of a fupream\nPower V I fay, he confefTes the good Will he had\nto the Reward, but the Weaknefs of his Black- Art\nwhere Heaven interpofed its Power, Numb xxiii.\n25.

Behold I have received\ncommandment to blefs^ and he hath hleffedy and I can-\npot reverfe it : Nothing can be plainer. He vs^ould,\nbut the Devil and he together were not able to re-\nverfe the Blefling. The only thing ftrange in this\nStory o( Balaam is^ that God ihould thus fuffer a\nSorcerer and Inchanter, a Witch or Dealer with\nthe Devil^ to receive Commands from himfelf, and\nto bid him go and do thus and thus, and to meet\nhim, and put into his Mouth what he ihould fay\non that Occafionv from whence fome might infi-\nnuate, that the Wizards and Magicians of thofc\nDays had a mutual or alternate Converfe, fome-\ntimes really with God himfelf, and at other timest\nwith the Devil ', as if the Wretch were to day a\nMa\u00bb\n\ff)f M A G I C K. iij\nMan of God, and to-morrow a Sorcerer, Conjurer,\nand an Inftrument of the Devil \\ and as if God\nwould floop to employ thofe who had fo far ftooped\nbelow the Dignity of reafonable Creatures, as to\nconverfe with the Devil.\nBy this means the People alfo were the more\neafily fubjc6ted to the Abufe of the Conjurer,\nand expofed to the Delufions of an evil Spirit,\nnot being able to know when he fpoke from One\nor from the Others no doubt the Deluder would\nalways pretend he fpoke by the immediate Illumi-\nnation of Heaven, as he had fomctimcs really done\nfo, it would not be difficult to obtain the Opi-\nnion that he did always fo.\nNow 'tis moll certain that nothing can more\naffill the Delufions of the Devil in fuch cafes as\nthefe, than to have it entertained among the Peo-\nple, that all the Infpiration is from Heaven j even\nthe Devil himfelf cannot defire a ftronger Auxi-\nliarj it is an Afliflance fo natural to the Delufions\nwhich he is carrying on among Men, that all his\ninfernal Art cannot form an Equivalent to it. And\nhence it came to pafs, at leaft I believe fo^ that the\nDevil chofe always that way of coming at the\nSenfes of Mankind, I mean by Viiion and Dream,\nby Voices in the Night, and by Injedions of Mid-\nnight Thoui^htsj becaufe God himfelf had made\nule of the (ame Means to infpire the Minds of\nMen with divine Ideas 5 and the Devil, by imitating\nthe fuperior Revelations, could not only enable his\nMagicians and Souchfayers, and fuch other Inftru-\nmentsof Delufion, to impofc their Cheats upon the\nPeople, but could even delude and impofe upon\nthofe Dreamers thcmfelves too, perfwading them to\nbelieve their Infpirations were from Heaven, and\nth^t they had fuch and fuch things revealed to them\nfrom the immediate Spirit of God, when it was'\nonly a Flatus from Hell, throwing them into Ec-\nI i Itafies,\n\fi6 A S r S T E M\nilafics, and as Balaam faid, being in a I'rance hut with\nkis Eyes open^ih^t is to fay, pofTefs'd with the Witch-\ncraft of an evil Spirit, as is faid of the Maid in\nthe j^5ls^ c. xvi. 'ver. i6. who had a Spirit of\nDivination, and brought to her Mafter great Gain\nby Southfaying, that is to fay, by fpeaking as the\n\/)m\/ di&ated to herj nay, and the Text is plain\nin acknowledging that it was the Devil that pof-*\nfefled her, for in the Original you have his Name\nwhat Devil it was j and if you want a farther Ex-\nplanation of him, you may have it too 5 his Name\nis called PTtHON^ and fome of your Bibles\n(fuppofing for once that you read any) has it in their\nMargins J what particular jD^-z;\/\/ Python was, whe-\nther an avaritious, a treacherous, a deceiving Devil '^\nbut fome think it was the firil, becaufe fhe hired\ncut hcrfelf, and her Devil with her, to a Mafter,\nand what {he got by her Devil^ her Mafter was to\nmake the beft ofj the Terms much the fame as\na late \/r\/\/^Mar\u2014s married two Wives for, then let\nthem out again at fo much a Year, and took the\nIncome of both their Devils for his Jointure. A\nrare Bargain indeed, and fomething a-kin, 1 believe,\nto the Devil Python !\nHow much were it to be wifli'd, that fome\nof our Southfaying Wits, who are really neither\nwife Men or Southfayers, Magicians or Conju-\nrers, and who will have us, in fpite of our\nSenfes, believe that they are really infpired,\ncould but tell us too, with any moderate Cer-\ntainty, whether thofe Infpirations are from God\nor the Devil 'y\nWhether the Flights of their Infipids\nareEcftafies of the Adored, or of the Horrid > whe-\nther whtn they rail at Heaven, and burlefque their\nMaker, we may not really believe they are over-\nrul'd by a divine Influence, to do it with fo ill a\nGrace, and fo little common Senfe, that it may\nbe diredcd to exalt the All- wile, by the very\nmean&\n\fof M A G I C K. 117\nmeans ufed to expofc him, and to make them mix Im-\npudence with fo much Ignorance, that others equal-\nly wicked, but of better Judgment, may grow ficic\nof the Crime for the mcer Deficiency of the Wit,\nDoubtlefs, He that knows how to ferve the\nbed Ends by the worft Means, can leave the\nmeaneft Heads and the mod brainlefs Wits to\nbe thus wicked, to intimate to others the Weak-\nnefs of the Crime, and the grofs Abfurdity of\nAtheifm. I don't therefore think it at all pro-\nphane, at leaft if not fo intended, to fay Such a\nFellow is one of God-a-mighty's fimple One's;\nby which I would be always underftood, that he is\none to whom Heaven has denied the Gift of\nBrains, and fufFer'd the Devtl to fill up the empty\nSpaces in his Head with a Share of glaring Im-\npudence, fuch as will pafs for Wit with thofe that\nhave none, and for the worft of Folly with all the\nreft of Mankind.\nThis fort of wife Men, of whom the Age \\^\nplentifully ftored at this time, are doubtlefs plac'd\nup and down in proper Stations by the Allowance\nof Providence, for the Convi&ion of Mankind in\ntheir particular Spheres > juft as the Devil himfelf\nhas, in many cafes, been a Preacher of Truth, and\nwill be fo to the End of the World, tho' fore\nagainft his Will.\nOf fo much Force is Ironical Righteoufnels,\nthat the blackeft Agents are fitteft to be made the\nbrighreft Examples of it > fince alfo the greateft\nand bcft Principles are often illuftrated by their\nmoft infamous, and confequently, by their compleat-\neft Contraries.\nBut to go back where I left off. The Devil^wha\nhas always had the Impudence to mimick his Ma-\nker, and fometimes to perfonate him too, in his\nApplications to Mankind, has made, I fay, his\niirit Acquaintance with him by this Method of\nI 5\nDream\n\f8 A S r S T E M\nDream and Midnight Vifion, for that very Reafon,\nviz. becaufe it is the Method by which God him-\nfelf often ufed to reveal himfelf to the Prophets and\nother his moft eminent Servants of old, as inftanc'd\nbefore in Abraham^ and of which the Scripture has\nmany Examples. (I hope that Book, when 'tis taken\nas a Hiftory only, may obtain Credit enough to be\nbrought in Evidence.) I have mentioned Jbraham\nalready, and perhaps it may be ofFer'd that this is\nnot fufficient, becaufe God converfcd, as the Text\nfays in another Place, Face to Face with Abraham \\\nbut take it then with his Grandfon Jacob: God ap-\npeared to Jacobs Gen. xxviii. ij. in his Dream of the\nLadder reaching up to Heaven. And behold the\nLord flood above it and faid, \/ am the Lord God\n^\/Abraham thy Father. But if this will not do\nneither, then take it with one who it might be\nas likely fhould have the Devil appear to him as\nGod himfelf, butftill 'twas the fame thing, Gen.xx,\n3. God came to Ahimelech in a Dream 5 So might\nthe Devil too, for Abiraelech was an Idolater : And\nagain, ver. 6. And God faid unto him in a Dream^\nNow Abimelech was a Philijiin of the curfed Race\ndeftined to DellruiSlion by the Pofterity of Abraham^\nand yet God appeared to him, or came to him in a\nDream, and fpoke to him in a Dream.\nFrom hence the Devil^ who is cunning enough\nto imitate all thofe Methods of Accefs to the Minds\nof Man, which 'tis pofTible for him to come at\nhim by, and which his Maker has ufed for the\nlike Communications, has always made ufc of this\nMethod i and when he has defigned the Delufion,\nor the perplexing of Mankind, or any other of his\ninfernal Infatuations, he has brought them to pafs\nhy the Injection of evil Thoughts or other dark\nMeans, moving his Paffions and Affedions, inftilling\nall the hellifh Imaginations that are requifite to the\nMifchiefs he defigns. And thus you have the Cir-\ncumflances^\n\fof M A G I C K. up\ncumftanccs, and the Rcafon too, of the Devil's way\nof working with Mankind.\nIt remains a Qi-ieftion, tho' of no extraordinary\nImportance, what Shape or Form the Devil made\nufc of in his firft acquainting himfelf with Man-\nkind. It is Satan's Misfortune, to fay no worfe of\nhim, that he cannot appear in his own Figure,\ncloathed with any of his native Beauties 5 but that\nit would render him fo frightful to his Emiflaries,\nand even his beft Friends and moft ufeful Ser-\nvants would be terrified, and would run away from\nhim inftead of converfing with him 5 and the moft\naccurate Magician or South fayer in Arabia would,\ninftead of going into the Deferts and Wildernefs to\nmeet him, abhor the very Place, and tremble at\nthe Thought of feeing him.\nHence, to whifper to them in the Night, and\nonly talk in Vifion and Appearance, is the kindcft\nthing the Devil can do to them, as well as the\nwifeft way for himfelf5 for was he ever to appear,\nI fay^ in his own Cloaths, none of his Friends\nwould ever come to receive his fecond Vifit. Now\nhis coming in the Night, or in Dream, as is hinted\nin the Story of the Magician above, is certainly\nneedful > for as in a Dream the Voice without the\nVifion is fufficient, fo if a Shape is reprefenred to\nthe Imagination in the Sleep it fooner wears off,\nand the Imprellions are fooner raz*d out of the\nMind, than if the AppariMon was vifible with open\nEyes, and in the Light of the Day 5 there's a great\ndeal of difference between what we really fee, and\nwhat we only dream we did fee.\nWe have indeed fome of Balaam's Dreamers,\nthat is to fay, who dream with their Eyes open;\nindeed fome of them may be faid to be always in\na Dream, they are fcarce any thing but Appai-itioa\nthemfelves 5 their whole Lives are a kind of moral\nDelufionj and as they live in a Dream, fo we\nI 4 muft\n\fn@ ^ ST S T E M\nmuft dream too, to make any thing of them, for\nthey never are what they feem to be, or feem tp\nbe what they are. But as I may perhaps endeavour\nto difcover thofe People to the World, a httle\nplainer than I can difcover them to thcmfelves, I\nfay no more of them in this Place, leaving the De-\nvil and them to a6t in Concert a-while, that they\nrna\\ illuftrare, and be Foils to one another.\nIt is true that by this way of dealing in Dreams, the\nDevil has mfinitp Advantage, for the makmg C-n-\njuitrs, that is to fay. Magicians and Southfayers, in\nthe \\A orld : Whether that fort of People have been\nof any Ufe to him for the propagating his Intereft\nin the World, is a Queltion by it fclf.\nThat the Devil took this Method for the firft\ncftat>hlhinghimfelf in the World, and, as Icall'd it,\nmaking his Acquaintance with Mankind, I have ta-\nl<en Notice of already: How ufeful he has found his\nnew- made Friends, and how apt to carry on his Bu-\nfinefs, and efpecially for the farther extending his\nPower, and propaganng the Delufions of others. Hi-\nflory will inform us > and we cannot doubt but he\nhas found his Advantage in it : But it remains a\nQueftion of Importance flill undecided, whether are\nbeft pleafed in thefe no6lurnal Operations, the Devil\nor the v^agician; my Opinion is for the firft. I believe\nindeed the Devil has got the better ofthem in the main,\nand whereas he at firft was mighty eager to make his\nAcquamtance among them, and glad of the Means;\nhefeems now to have over- reached them,and to have\nworked them up to a Defire after the Correfpon-\ndence in fuch a manner, that the fubtle Manager is\nnotfo cheap to be had fince, but makes Bargains, nay,\nbrings them up to his own Terms, and fometimes\ntells them plainly, he has no Occafion for them ;\nbut oh the other hand, if they want him, they\nmuft give him his own Price, and do what he con-\nditions with them for, or elfe he has no more to fay\nto them, tho^ he is a Cheat in that too. Thus\n\fof M A G I C K. iji\nThus like a cunning Chap, he turns his Back and\nis gone, knowing very well that they will call him\nagain, and give him his Price 5 yield to his Demand,\nand rather fell themfelves to him Soul and Body^ as\nwe are told is now very frequent, than go without\nhis Afjiftance. This is all owing to his Subtiky,\nand Mankind's Folly and Fondncfsj for had they\nflood as they did at firft, he muft have come to\ntheir Conditions j but he found the way to make\nhimfclf neceflary to them, and to pleafe them, and\nhe managed accordingly.\nIt is indeed an Evidence how fhrewdly the Devil\nover-reached Mankind in the mod early Ages of\n^he World : For, Firfi^ as I mentioned before, thi$\nyf^s to come to them with feme Authority, and\nwith the Magnificence of a God, and it always\ngave them an Awe and kind of Reverence of his\nAppearance 5 Secondly^ it really fo far prevail'd\nwith them, that we have a great deal of Reafon to\nbelieve they did not always know whether their\nIntelligence was from Above or from Below, and\nwhether they were converfing with God or with.\nthe Devil \\ If this is true, as I hav^e no Reafon to\nqueftion, I have lefs Reafon to doubt that he of-\nten deluded them to think the former. And thus\nperhaps many falfe Prophets in former times came\nto the poor People, and began their Predi\u00a3tion$\nwith the ufual Preface, 'Thus faith the Lord ; when\nin Juflice they ought to have begun with, Thus\nfaith the Devil^^s they might eafily have {een after-\nwards, by the Confequence of it, and by the nature\npf their Predidion ^ for 1 believe that way it is moll\ncafily difcovered.\nThe Difcovery feems indeed to be direfced by\nthis very Method, where the Scripture fays, If a\nProphet comes^ Jhews Signs and iVonders^ and thca\nadds, go ferve other Gods^ his very Do6lrine proves\nhim to be an Impoftor, and on that very Account\nhe\n\fIll A S r S T E M\nbe is to be rejefted : God's Prophets will always\nteach God's Truths, a falfe Prophet is eafily known\nby his Teachings 5 the Devil may deceive for a\nwhile, but even the Devil himfelf cannot hold it\nlong, the cloven Principle will appear, which I\nfuppofe the Fable of the cloven Foot to be an Em*\nblcm of, and no more.\nBut to come back to the Example of the Magi-\ncian going into the Defart > why, the very Place\nwas a Branch of that Complication of Fraud which\nconftituted ail the reft : The Man went thither\nlirft cafually, fell aflcep by the natural Confequence\nof his Wearinefs, and under the Palm-tree, as cu-\nftomary, to preferve him by its Shade j the reft\nwas all a Cheat j the Devil could as well have\nmade him dream and fee the Vidon in his Cham-\nber at Sufa^ or where clfe he dwelt in Perfia^\nor Arabia^ as in the Wildernefs> but he catch'd\nhim there, and took th.u Advantage, to introduce\ntfic Ceremony of his future correfporiding 5 and\ntherefore he appoints him to come again to the\nfeme Place, and there gives him the Formality of\nMeafures to be obferved ; he muft make his Tour\nfifteen times round the Tree> he muft call him by\nwhat infernal Title he was pleated to give himfelf;\nand this to be done three times every Circuit he\nmade about the Tree> and when all this was done,\nas he might well be inclined to do, he was to lie\ndown and go to fleep.

Numb. xii. 6.

I have fo much Opi-\nnion of the Power of common Scnfe in Man, as a\nhuman Creature, and fo much Charity for rhe good\nMeaning of thofe, who we do noc find immediately\nvile, profligate, and immoral, as to think they\nwould not ad with Satan upon that foot.\nI have much more Reafon to think rhe four Ec-\nclefiafticks o^ Switzerland^ in ihcSiory Jetzer^ adcd\nwith Satan open-ey'd, and open-fac'd, when they\nproposed to the poor foolilli Creature to renounce\nGod and Jefus Chrift, and fo to carry on the\nFraud they had begun, with a kind of Sandion in-\nilead of an Oath of Sccrefy, and it appeared mdeed\nto be fo at laft.\nBut certainly, as in other Cafes, abundant Para-\nlels might be brought. The Devil, who generally\nafts in Difgufe, has carry'd thofe Difguifes fo art-\nfully, that I doubt not but many of his falfe Pro-\nphets, long before our times, have faid, thus faith\nthe Lord^ with a good Grace > that is^ with a real\nBelief, that God had fpoken to them, or, as was\nthe Language of the Scripture Times, had Ipoken\nby them, when really it was the Voice of the De^\nvily and of no body elfe : And let not our Modern\nEnthufiafticks take this to be faid only in Favour of\nthemfelves 5 I am noc come fo far down in the\ncourfe of my Work, fo much as to think of thera^\n90 not of \u00a7t. Dunftmiy St. Francis^ or of the more\neminei^c\n\fii8 A S Y S T E M\neminent Deceiver St. Ignatius^ the greateft Enthu-\nfiaftick of the lad ten Centuries: when I coma\nto thero, we (hall reckon as we meet.\nBut I am yet talking of the fpecifick Difference\nbetween the Infpirations of falfe Prophets, the\nDreams whifper'd and fiiggefted by the Den)il'y and\nthofe on the other hand from the contrary Appear-\nances of the good Spirit, that is to fay, of God\nhimfelf. I am in the firft place to intimate, that\nthey are not always to be difcern'd, no rior eafy tcj\nbe difcern'd 5 if they were, there would not be fo\nmany Delufions in the World as have been 5 for the\nMen are not all Devils before they come to him^\nthey don't come to him refolving to be deceiv'dj\nand intending to deceive every Body they are con-\ncerned with. I muft own, I do not think that all\nthe four hundred Priefts of Baal^whom Elijah fum-\nmon'd together to the great Sacrifice at Mount\nCarmel, would have fhew'd fo many antick Tricks,\nleaping upon the Altar, cutting themfclves with\nKnives, and crying O Baal hear us f if they had\nbeliev'd they were under a Delufion of the Devil\nall the while, and that Baal was no Body but a dead\nStock, a lifelefs Image, without Senfe to hear^\nmuch more without Power to anfwer. They muft\ncertainly believe^ that Baal was a Something, or a\nSomebody, whom it was their Duty to pay a Ho-\nmage and Reverence to 5 or that they paid that\nHomage to the true God, through the Medium of\nan Image, a fort of a Model of that meaner and\nmore ignorant Idolatry call'd Popery.\nBut to look forward beyond this Image of Idol-\nworihip, we have the old falfe Prophets coming\nmuch nearer to the true, and the Infpirations bear-\ning an Affinity in a more fignificant Points and\nthat is, in Signs and Wonders^ or what we call\nMircales, which yet may be all from the Devil%\nfo hard it is for the deceived falfe Prophet\nro-\n\fof M A 'G I C A. itp\nto know when he is right and when he Is wrong;\nand fo eafy is it for him to be impos'd upon him-\nfelf, and confequently to delude the People he con-\nverfes with.\nThe Devil^ as far as his Agency of this kind will\nreach, muft certainly be mightily pleas'd with it;\nfor by thus infpiring his Tools, not only to the de-\ngree of falfe Prophets, but to an Ability of work-\ning Miracles, fliowing Signs and Wonders, whe^\nther Real or Imaginary, he not only the more ef-\nfe6tually impofes upon his falfe Prophets, but gives\nor deputes fo much of Devil to them, as to make\nthem able to delude and deceive others, nay to de-\nceive the whole World j or as the Text exprefles\nit Matt, xxiii. 2,4. to deceive (if it were poffible) ths\nvery Eie5f,\n'Tis remarkable in this fame Text, that it is pre-\ndided there fhall come falfe Chrifts, and falfe Pro-\nphets, (Devils, or Devil's Agents) and ihall fliew\ngreat Signs and Wondeis.\n. There is alfo another Text, which gives us a\nCaution againft fuch, tho' I do confefs I can't\nfee how it can be made ufe of till the Delufion has\ngone fome Length 5 and that is in Deut. xiii. i, 2-\nIf there arife among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of\nDreams, and giveth thee a Sign^ or a Wonder^ and\nthe Sign^ or the Wonder come to pafs. Now this,\nI fay, requires fo much time, as to the fulfilling\nthe Token or Predi6tion of the falfe Prophets, till\n.when, and till the falfe Do6i:rine which he preaches\nIhall dete6t him, the People are manifeftly in dan-\nger of the Delufion^ for as in all fuch Cafes in\nthofe ancient Times, every Novelty was confirm'd\nby Signs and Wonders, What could be more de-\nluding, and more apt to impofe upon the People,\nthan to have the Shewer of thofe Signs and Won-\nders confirm his Teachings by a Miracle, and that the\nMiracle ihould come to pafs? Yet all this may at-\nK tend\nII\n\f130 A SYSTEM\ntend the lying Wonders of a Magician^ a falfe Pro-\nphet, nay of a Devihy That fuch Wonders may\nbe wrought as are juftly term'd falfe and lying\nWonders, we have again prcdifted 2 fhef, ii. p.\nwhich Text I doubt touches a little our holy Fa-\nther the Pope, whofe coming is faid to be after the\nworking of Satan^ with all Power and Signs, and lying\nWonders \\ intimating that there are Wonders which\narc Delufive } faid to be wrought, but not wrought;\na la Mode the Legend^ the Fables of Monkery^ the De^\n*uil of Loudon, and the like. Wonders indeed can\nicarce be called lying upon any other Foundation\n:\nfor if they were real, and aftually perform'd, how\ncan they then be lying? but if promis'd to be per-\nform'd, and not done^ or faid to be really perform'd\nand done, but were nor, then they are indeed\nLyes, or lying Wonders 5 and take them which way\nwe will, I doubt as before, and leave my Matters\nthe Jefuites to bring his Holinefs off their own\nway.\nBut I come on upon modern Time too fail 5 Hi-\nftory demands that we advance by juft degrees, and\nto that purpofe I muft look a little more particu-\nlarly into the Antiquity of thefe things. Satan,\nto give the Devil his due, did not manage with\nfo little Dexterity, his firft Acquaintances with\nMankind, as to fuffer his fecret Methods to be diP-\ncover'd and detefted, or his Jnftruments to be ex-\nposed ; On the contrary, he put innumerable\nWonders upon Mankind, a6ted with inextricable\nStratagem and Art 5 from which Dexterity, and\nthe difficulty of explaining his Management, the\ncommon Operations of his Favourites obtain'd the\nSandbion of Devilifh j and the A r t they ufed, ob-\ntain'd the honourable Title of Black j and this,\naccording to my Title, is what I am now to defcribc.\nThe World was now fo much improv'd inKnow-\nIcgde, that, as 1 hinted above, nothing new could be\nftartedj\nI\n\fof M A G I C K. 13\nftarted, but a Miracle was prefently enquired afccr to\nconfirm it j and he that could do the nioft eminent\nthings of that kind, was the moft famous in their\nOpinion. Mopfus was a Southfayer, and faid to be\nthe Son of Apollo: He was in fuch Credit and E-\nfleem in his time, that it grew into a Proverb, to\nbe as infallible as Mopfus.\nThis Mopfus meeting one Chakhas^ a Man like-\nwife eminent in the fame devilifli Profeffion, they\nfell into Difpute about fome things relating to their\nArt. Mopfus ask'd Chalchas^ how many Figs fuch.\na wild Fig-tree, as he pointed out to him, had upoa\nit 5 the Southfayer Chalchas would not anfwcr him,\nbut alledg'd, that it was not a fair Qiiellion. Upon\nwhich Mopfus told him the Number, and upoa\nCounting them up, it was found true to a Figj\nupon which Chalchas was fo confounded, not being\nable to conceive how it Was pcrform'd, that tho*,\nthe thing was trifling, he died for Grief.\nIt feems, Chalchas had his Fortune told him by\nthe Oracle, (viz.) that he fhould dye when he\nfound out a better Southfayer than himfelfj all\nwhich I can refolve into nothing but this, that\nMopfus had more Favour with the Devil than Chal^\nchas^ at lead at that time, and that he whifper'd\nthe Number of the Figs in his Ear 3 or to clear up\nthe Juggle, Mopfus had counted them before, and\nfo the Queftion was a Juggle in it felf> which in-^\ndeed was the moft likely of the two.\nThe Humour of the Times being, as I faid, to\nrequire Miracles and Wonders, the Southfayers\nand Dreamers of Dreams belHrr'd themfelves, and\nfought out (every Man his own Way) for fecret In-\nfpirations and Illuminations, and the Devil was\nvery ufeful to them on many Occafions, till at laft\nhe found the Work encreas'd upon his Hands,\nand he was obliged to fct up Deluuon-Offices, as\nI may call them, and give out Anfwers at the\nK z Shrines\n\fA SYSTEM\nShrines of the People's Idols, and in the Names of\ntheir Gods.\nThefe were fo far from crying down the Office\nor Dignity of a Southfayer in the World, that ic\nrather encreaft their Fame. For as the Number of\nthofe Oracles were but few, not above twelve or\nfourteen, great and fmallj fo the wife Men^ ih^ Ma-\ngicians and Southfayer.i<^ were often fent by their re-\nfpe61:ive Princes, whofe Favourites they were, to\nthofe Oracles on extraordinary Occafions, and to\nbe refolved in their Doubts > whence they fre-\nquently brought fuch Anfwers, as they knew would\npleafe and oblige the Prince that fent them 5 per-\nhaps as beft fuited the Circumftances of thofe Prin-\nces, and which thofe fo fent bell knew, whether the\nOracle gave fuch Anfwers or no, the latter being\nnot always neceflary.\nThis working by Miracle feldom or never fail'dj\nit confounded the Underflandings of Menj and\nwhen any of their Southfayers had once obtained\nan Efteem by fuch a Performance, he never wanted\nany thing more to continue his Chara6ter, and to\ngain him Admittance into the Favour and Court of\nthe greateft Princes. Hence Jofeph's telling Pha-\nraoh's Chief Butler and Chief Baker their Dreams,\nand thofe Dreams exadlly commg to pafs, open'd\nthe Doors of the Prifon for him j as his adding to\nit that of telling the Interpretation of Pharaoh's\nDream advanced him to the fecond Chariot, and to\nthe crying Ahrek before him, that is Bow the Knee.\n'Tis the Opinion of fome Learned m the Wif-\ndom of the jEgyptians^ that Jofeph continued the\nArt of Southfaymg (for in that the Wifdom of\nthe jEgyptians chiefly confided) for a great while\nafter j and I acknowledge my felf to be of that O-\npinion, whether 1 am learned in the Wifdom oF the\n^Egyptians or no, and that he had never been con-\ntinued in fuch a high Poll fo long, if he had not-\nFor\n\f'of M A G 1 C K. 133\nFor this Reafon thofe Words he ufed afterwards\nto his Brethren, Wot you not that fuch a Man as I\ncan Divine'^, are a kind of Admiration^ that is to\nfay, Are you fo ignorant in the Cuftoms of this\nCountry, as not to know that a Man in my Poft\nmuft be able certainly to divine? Gen. xliv. if.\nAnd indeed, without putting any flrain'd or con-\nUrain'd Meaning upon the Sacred Text, I cannot\ndoubt but that the People of jEgypt took Jofeph\nto be what they calPd the Prince of the Magicians\nof the Eaftj that is to fay, one of the Chief of\nthem, and extraordinarily qualify'd by the Gods for\nthe Under(landing deep Myfteries, for diving into\nhard Queftions, interpreting Dreams, and refolving\nDoubts. In a word, in the fame Senfe that Daniel^\nalmoft a thoufand Years after, was eltecm'd azBal^y-\nlon^ viz. that the Spirit of the Holy Gods was in him 5\nwhether they meant by their Gods the Crocodile,\nor the River Nile^ or the Great Calf at the Egyp-\ntian Thebes^ or Ifys^ or Ofyris^ that I fhall not en-\nquire into here, but they doubted not that fome of the\nbeft and brighteft of their Deities infpir'd Jofeph\nwith an Excellent Spirit.\nNor was it unreafonable for the poor People un-\nder the dark Circumftancesof that Age to believe fo\nof him; for how elfe fhould he have the Fore-\nknowledge of the dreadful Famine feven Years be-\nfore it came ? how that Sagacity to gather fuch im-\nmenfe Quantities of Corn in the plentiful Years be-\nfore it> and lay it up in fuch Places, and in fuch\nProportions, and fo fecur'd, as to fupply fuitably\nthe whole Country of Mgypt^ fo vaftly extended,\nand fo populous as it was at that time?\nHow Jofeph came by all this Knowledge and\nWifdom, they (as we have like reafon to believe)\nwere as ignorant of, as they were pofitive that it\nwas fo, by fome means or other; and therefore it\nwas no Abfurdiry for them to fugged that he did all\nK 3\nby\n\f134 ^ S r S T E M\nby Divination, that is to fay, by Enchantment,\nor fecret Converfe with the Spirits of another\nWorld 5 or as we call it, with more Propriety at\nlead in our Opinion, that he dealt with the Z)^i;;7i and\nthat this was done by the Charm of the Silver\nCup which was put in the Mouth of Benjamin's\nSack.\n-^\nThat they believ'd fo is evident from the Words\nof the fame Chap.

But this I leave to Experiment.\n'\nAsj I fay,thefe two important Queftions may take\nup a large Tra6t by themfelves, and as they muft\nneeds be of vaft Confequence to the Readers, I doubt\nnot the Rookfellers, who are generally Publick-fpi^\nrited Gentlemen, will embrace the Opportunity of\npublilhmg fuch a valuable Piece for the Good of\nthe Nation 3 fo J ihall adjourn it for the pre-\nfent.\nCome we next in order, according to the Con-\ntents of this Chapter, to the particular Quellion\nin what Shape the Devil appeared to the firft Magi-\ncians, or the Inchanters of the molt early Times 5 and\nthe Anfwer is, as far as we can yet learn, that he did\nnot afTume any Shape or vifible Appearance at all :\nwhether it was his Modefty or his Policy is a Que-\nllion has been a little, tho' not fully difcufs^d, an^\n\u2022\" '\nthole\n\fof M A G 1 C K. ,37\nihofe that fpeak moft favourably of Satan, think ic\nwas the firft > for in the early Times of his Inti-\nmacy he might be loth perhaps to expofe himfelf\nto his new Acquaintance J whereas afterwards, when\nhebecame really a familiar Spirit, in thelitteral Senfe\nof the Word, he made no Difficulty to converfe\nvjith his Favourites more openly, fee and be feen j\nof which in its Place.\nBut i^ this was not the Cafe, it feems to mc,\nthat at firft, and while being only a Night Viliter\nhe communicated himfelf by Vifion and Dream\nonly, there was no manner of Occafion for the Lo-\ncality of his Perfon, and for a real Appearance\n5\nnor, if his Bufincfs was done, was ic material whe-\nther he delivcr'd it by his own Mouth, or by the\nVoice of any of his trufly and well-beloved\nAngels and Agents, who are certainly as capable to\nofficiate in his Place as if he was there in Perfon.\nBefides, as much a Spirit as the Devil is, we have\nReafbn to believe he is fo far from being Omniprefenr,\nthat he would not be able to difpatch a thoufandth\nPart of the Bufinefs he has upon his hands, if he had\nnot an innumerable number of Deputy Reprefenta-\ntive Devils always at his hand, to execute his Corn-\nmillions, and make their Appearance for him, when\nand as often as the meaneft of the Southfaying \\nr\nchancing Race calls him.\nAnd for this Rcafon it might be, that AllAlhrahazeny\nas is faid above, in the firlt Intimacies betwixt him\nand the Favourite Spirit who fpoke to him in\nDream, had a Name given, by which he was to\nbe called three times at every Round of the Palm-\ntree Circle 5 which when he had rehearfed, the\nDevil^ (that is to fiy, that particular Deputy Devil\nwhich was appointed to waic upon him) was always\nto attend and be ready. Whether that faid parti-\ncular Spirit was bound to his, due and daily Atten-\ndance for that one Occafionj Hiftory has not yet\ndc*\n\fJ38 A S Y S T E M\ndetermined : I have only to fay, that if it was {o^\nFriend Ali mufl be a Magician of feme Quality,\nthat had a whole Devil to attend him perfonally\nand fingly, who was allowed to do no other\nBufinefs, but juft wait to receive his Orders, and\ngive back the Infl:ru6tions which jIU might Hand\nin need of, unlefs perhaps now and then he might go\nupon fome other Errands, where the Occafion was\nextraordinary.\nWe are told, that in America^ and in fome Na-\ntions in Africa^ the Magicians or Wizards and\nPawaws found Ways and Means to converfe with\nSatan Face to Face, as particular Occafionsrequir'dj\nand that from the Beginning of Time : for per-\nhaps his Converfation in thofe remote Countries\nmight be ajs antient as it was any where, ^gypt\nand Arabia excepted.\nJt is faid alfo that, he docs appear in thofe Coun-\ntries, and upon certain Times or Occafions, in hu-\nman Shape, fometimes in one Pofturc, fometimes in\nanother, ^ Circumftances may vary > as fometimes\nhe appears angry and frightful, furrounded with\nFire, preceded with Tempeft, and the like terrify-\ning Objefts, to let the People know that he can\nhurt them 5 fometimes in Smiles, and fweet fpicey\nPerfumes, and preceded by Mufic and Melody iq\nthe Air, to let them know he is pleafed.\n'Tis true, it was late in the World before we, in\nthefe Parts, knew any thing of it j and it might be\nfo alfo before he begun thofe Praftices there : they\nwere too grofe to go down with the firft Ages,\nwhen the Knowledge of God was not fo entirely\nobliterated from the Minds of Men as it was af-\nterwards > But Idolatry had prevailed to fuch a de-r\ngree in America^ that the Devil was perhaps the\nonly God they had heard any thing of for fome\n^houfands of Years, But I return to my Subjeft.\n\fof M A G I C K. 139\nExcept in thofe and fuch like remote and unac-\nquainted Parts of the World, we do not find much\nEvidence of the Magicians feeing or converfing\nwith evil Spirits, of whatever Kind or Quality,\nin the Shapes of Men or Women : God's Angels\nindeed, who are in facred Text called the Heaven-\nly Hoft^ are and have been frequently allowed to\nmake their Appearance, and have been fenc hither\non immediate and fpecial Bufinefs, as to Abraham^\nto Jacoh^ to Mofes^ to the Father of John the Bap-\ntift, to the Virgin Mary^ to the Shepherds at the\nBirth, to our Saviour himfelf on divers Occafions,\nand to the Women at the Sepulcher, at the Re-\nfurreftion, and at the Afcenfion.\nPerhaps this may be the Reafon why the Devil\nhas kept his diftance 5 he remembers no doubt his\nformer Rencounters with Uriel and with Gabriel^\nor other Angels, no matter who, mentioned by\nName in Mr. Milton^ and how they drove hint\nabout from one Part of the Wade to another, out\nof Heaven, out of Paradife, and every where elfe,\nwhere they and he happen'd to meet ; and doubt-\nlefs he does not much care to rencounter them.\nWhat Shape or Figure he appeared in when he\ncame to tempt his Maker and our Saviour, at that\ntime himfelf in a State of Perfonality as Flefh\nand Blood, as it is not exprefled, fo I will not prcr\ntend to make a Guefs at it: 'Tis plain when he\nwas at any time call out of the poor diftempcr'd\nPeople by our Saviour, or by his Difciples, tho*\nhe came evidently out of the Demoniac or PoffefTed,\nyet he did not come out vifibly and in Shape, but\nwalking off like a dete^cd Thief in the dark, and\nimperceptible, he always play'd out of fight.\nThe fame Method I believe he took with z\\\\\nforts of People in the World for fome Ages, efpe-\ncially at the Beginning of Time 5 and would all our\npoiTeflcd or profefTed Dealers with this cunning\nMaT\n\fI40 A S Y S r E M\nManager act in the Dark, and keep him to tbem-\nfelves, that we might not fee their Inftvu6tor, or be\nacquainted with the Infl;ru61:ions, their Witchery and\nCraft of Hell would, I believe, be much lefs hurt-\nful to the World than it is.\nBut now it feems as if our modern Magicians\na6Ved upon another footj that they do not go to\nthe Bev'il^ but the Devil comes to them > they do\nnot go to him in the Defarts and Retreats of the\nDark for Directions and Inftrudtions, but he ads\nwith them in Concert, and there is a kind of mu-\ntual Cohabitation, they go on hand in hand, and\nare Fellow-Agents, both Principals and both Ac-\ncelTaries, only with this ufual difference on the De^\nvirs fide, viz. if they happen to do any capital\nMifchief, fo as to bring them to the Gallows, he\nalways leaves the Hanging Part to them, there he,\nas we fay, flips his Neck out of the Collar, and\nis gone.\n'I'his fubtle Agreement in Mifchief between\nthe Magician and the Spirit that a6ls with him, is\nnot at all for the Advantage of Mankind ; and the\nMagicians of the former Mould feem to have been\nmuch the lefs hurtful kind, for they generally\nwere known to be what they\" pretended, and were\nonly made ufe of by People when they wanted 'em,\nand for what was required of them j fo they had\ntheir Pay and Wages of Unrighteoufnefs, and you\nhad done with them.\nBut here we converfe with the Men, knowing\nnothing of what they are, and do not fee the Devil\nthat is within them > fo we deal with the Devil\nat fecond hand, as we may call it, that is, we talk\nto him in difguife, make Bargains and Contra6bs\nwith him, and that fome of the worft kind, by\nthe Agency of thefe Magicians , and fee not\nthe evil Spirit who is all the while both Di-\nredor and Principal in all the Affair. Thus far for\nthofe\n\fof MAGIC K i^i\nthofe Magicians who really deal infecrec with him,\nand this is that Magick which we call the Black y^rf^\nthat is to fay a fccret undifcover'd Confpiracy between\nSatan and thofe Agents of his which apply to him\nfor Diredion, and then their afting again by thofc\nDircdions, to abufe, impofe upon, and deceive\nMankind.\nCHAP.

'The Earth is filled with Violence \\ and ver.^^,\nfpeaking of Man, the Imagination of the Thought of\nhis Heart was only Ei-il continually-y and the Wick^\nednefs of Man was great upon the Earth : upon this\nAccount, I fay, I gave up all that Race in the Be-\nginning of this Work > and be it fo, or be it only\nfuppofcd to be fo, 'tis much the fame, nor is ic\nworth\n\f141 A S Y S T E M\nworth difputing with any Body 5 if theZ)^w7 had the\nManagement oif them, as 'tis evident he had, much\nlefs could not be expeded, let that part go.\nBut my Queilion has been all along, not what\nwas done hefore but fmce the Deluge, and how did\nSatan introduce himfelf to the pft-diluvean Ages,\n\u2022when and where, with whom, and in what man-\nner did he make his firft Acquaintance and break-\ning in upon Mankind for a fecond Pofleilion, or\nManagement of Art?\nI mentioned Zoroafter {lain in Battle by Semiramis^\nand Prometheus and others, and very early they were j\nand I ftand by my Account of them, that they\nwere the firft Magicians^ as the Word or ;Terni\nMagician imply'd a Man of Learning, of Wit, and\nmore than common Underftanding, fearching after\nKnowledge, ftudying the Rudiments and firft Pre-\ncepts and Principles of Philcfophy. But we are\nnow in Search after another fort of People, who,\ntho' they were Searchers into Knowledge too, yet\nlook'd into it in another manner, and for other\nPurpofes, namely, who fearched deeper into things,\nand into deeper things, I mean fearching into HELL\nit fclfj who began firft to enter upon Diabolical\nEnquiries into the infernal Myfteries and Arts of\nthe Devily and where thofe begun it is not fo eafy\nto find out.\nSome Authors, as Serenus^ and Cajftanus from him,\nand the learned Sir Walter Raleigh from both, hand\ndown this fabulous Original for our Speculation^\nviz, that Ham or Cham the Son of ISIoah having\npraftifcd thofe fuperftitious and facrilegious Arts\n(I cake their own Words) before the Flood, and\nknowing that he could bring no Book or Memorial\nof that nature into the holy VefTel where his Life\nwas to be fecured by the goodnefs of his Maker,\nand wherein he was to remain with his righteous\nand godly Father, caufed the Ruks and Precepts to\nbe\n\ftf M A G 1 C K. 145\nbe graved in Metal, and in hard Stone, which\nIhould receive no Impreflion from the Water.\nBut this is fuch an evident Fiftion, and full of\nfo many Abfurditics and Contradidions, as well as\nFalftioods, that 'tis not only unlikely it fhould, but\nimpoffible it can be true.\nYovFirft^ Where were thofe Plates left ? If they\nwere to be preferved in the Ark, 'tis certain Noah\nwho had the Superintendency of the whole Build-\ning, and of every thing that was brought inco ir,\nor to be admitted, would much lefs have admitted\ncopper Plates to be brought in there, or Tables of\nStone with fuch Abominations engraven on them,\nthan he would have taken in written Books, if fuch\nhad been then in ufe.\nSecondly^ Had Cham been fuch a Perfon, fo far\nengaged in a Correfpondence with Hell, we may\nreafonably fuppofe God, who for the Reafons taken\nfrom the Sins of the reft of Mankind deftroyed\nthe whole World, would never have fpared him,\nand fo by him laid the Foundation of the Devil's\nfecond Kingdom, and of his debauching the World\nwith Sorcery and Witchcraft : nor do we read\nthat Cham or Ham was curfed by his Father on any\nfuch Account, but for Sins adually committed af-\nter the Deluge, and after their coming out of the\nArk 5 but to charge Ham with Sorcery and Diabo-\nlical Pradlices before the Flood, is a grofs begging\nthe Queftion, and by no means to be admitted\nwithout good Evidence.\nAnd again, the Writing and Graving upon\nhard Stones, Metal, ^c, requires a Proof that there\nwas any fuch thing as the Knowledge and Ufe of\nLetters among Men before the Floods which after\nthe ftridteft Enquiry is not yet afcertained, much\nlefs agreed upon by Men of Learnings the fame\nhaving not been preferved to Mankind after the\nDeluge, which 'tis highly probable would have\n7 been.\n\fi44 A S Y S T E M\nbeen, if fuch a thing had been in iife, the Know-\nledge having been both innocent and ufeful.\nI'hirdly^ If fuch Writing or Engravement were\nmade by Cham^ or any one elfe, where were they\nlaid, and how found again ? when, by the uni-\nverfal Convulfions fufFer'd during the Flood, not\nthe Icaft Veftigcs, Ruins or Remains of Cities or\nTowns were to be feen upon the Surface of the\nEarth, but all was huddled together in the gene-\nral Confufion of the Parts, and either buried and\noverwhelmed in the Body of the Earth, or driven\ndown by the rapid Currents which followed at\nthe going off of the Floods and it feems ftrange\nthat thefe Stones or Plates could be found, when\nevery thing elfe was loft and overthrown 5\nwhen the Surface being perfc6lly new, no one\nPart of the World could be known from another,\nmuch lefs any Place be known by the Situation\nwhich it had before.\nThere are many more Abfurdities in the Cafe\nas it is propofcd5 but I muft not dwell too long\nin a Place, that have fo long a Journey to go.\nZoroafter is the next to whom they would a-\nfcribe the Magick Art j but I have proved himi\nto be a very honeft Man, and a wife Man, pro-\nperly fpeaking, in my former Chapters, and that\nhe was employed in a much better and honefter\nStudy, fuch as in difcovering the Nature of Herbs\nand Plants, Metals and Minerals, precious Stones\nand Jewels j that he invented the Do6brines and\nfirft Principles of natural and moral Philofophy;\nand many ufeful and beneficial Parts of Know-\nledge for the Good of Mankind 5 the Power of\nSimpathies and Antipathies, and their various Work-\nings and Obje6]:s> in all which I take Abraham alfo,\nwho was flill before him, to have been efpecially\nfamous J and that 'ris probable Abraham was parti-\ncularly inllru6ted by Noah himfelF, for 'tis evident\nthat\n\fof M A G I C K. 14;\nthat Alraham Was upwards of fifty Years old wheri\nNoah died.\nTo come off of all this, there are others who\nmake another Zoroafler^ a real and Diabolical Magi-\ncian, who was not (lain by Semiramis^ as that wife\nPrince Zoroafler was > but on the other hand, ha-\nving been teaching his Difciples the Art of raifing\nand converfing with Spirits, was by one of\nthem taken away out of his School, all his Scho-\nlars looking on 5 or, if you will have it in a modern\nStyle, he raifed the Devil^ to ihew his Difciples a\nTeft of his Art 5 and the Z)m\/ carried him away\nin the face of them all, to give them a Teft of his\nPower : which (by the way) was but poor Encou-\nragement at that time, for any one of them to turn\nMagician $ and for that Reafon, and knowing the\nDen)tl to be no Fool, makes me give the lefs heed\nto that Part of the Story.\nOther Writers, of whom Jofephus is one, (whofe\nCredit, I muft always premife, goes but a very lit-\ntle way with me) tells us, that Seth the Son of\nyldam firft difcover'd the Planets or wandering Stars\nwith their Motions, Influences, Revolutions, i^c.\nthat thofe with feveral other ufeful Branches of\nAftronomic Knowledge were handed down by Tra-\ndition to Noah^ and by him to the new Worlds\nand that then coming from Noah immediately to\nAbraham^ to Zoroafter and others, they were hand-\ned from them to Pofterity, as we find it at thi^\nDay.\nBut all this is nothing to the purpofe, that is t\"'\nfay, nothing to our Diabolick Magick, nor doe>\nit give any Light into the grand Queftion, Who\nwas the firft Author of that kind of Study j who\nwas Satan's firft Correfpondent in the new World^\nor firft dealt with the Devil after the Flood ? I\ncannot think indeed that the Devil fuffcred Man-\nfeifid to live long unmolefted by him, or that M^nt-\n1\/ kind\n\f1^6 A s r s r E M\nkind could go on long without fome Bufinefs be-\ntween them : they would be both eager to renew\nthe Acquaintance, and reftore the ancient Familia-\nrity 5 and it could not be long before they found\nfome means or other to bring it to pafsj for Lovers\nyou know will meet, whatever are the Difficulties\nwhich firft obftruft: and efpecially the great Artift\non his Side had many dark Defigns in view, and\nnew Foundations to lay for the Overthrow of a\nrifing Generation, which required to be laid deep\nand Ibong, and the fooner they were begun, the\nbetter for him.\nAs to Cham being the Author of Magick in the\nnew World, that indeed I cannot grant, that is to\nfay, not as the Ancients bring in the Story j namely,\nthat he invented the Seven liberal Sciences, and\nwrote them in fourteen Pillars of Brafs or Stone,\ni^c. as above 5 that Cham^ as he was, notwithftand-\ning the Curfe he incurred by his ill Behaviour to\nhis Father, one of the immediate Progenitors of the\nnew Race, and particularly of thofe great and\nmighty Nations the jEgyptians^ Arahians^ Africans^\nand Phcenicians^ among whom all human Wifdom\nand Learning firft flourifhed, and indeed firft be-\ngan J fo I doubt not but he was capable to inftru6t\nthem in much of the antediluvean Knowledge, and\nthat of even the beft things, and did fo : That he\nreigned afterward in jEgypt a very long while, is\nconfirmed by all the antient Writers j particularly\nin the Catalogue of the Mgyptlan Kings, of which\nCham was certainly the firft, they are faid to reign\nand fucceed one another thus,\nCham peopled Egypt the Year of the World 1847,\n191 Years after the Flood.\nOfyris ox Mizraim the Son of Chum^ 2008, }fz\nYears after the Flood.\nN, B. This was the King who elevated Jofephj\nand who built the Pyramids, not for Tombs\nand\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 147\nand Monuments only, but for Magick, that is,\nAftronomick Obfervations, as Semiramis did\nthe great Tower of Babylon.\nProm hence it appears that Cham came to jEgypt\nwhen he was near three hundred Years old j fup-\npofe him to be an hundred Years old when he\ncame out of the Ark, which was the moft, for his\nelder Brother Sent was no more, and that he reign'd\nin Mgypt one hundred and fixty one Years, in\nwhich time he made the Egyptians and the j^ra-\nhiansj and alfo the Phoenicians^ for they were all\nhis Offspring, very polite Nations.\nThe Arabians were his Pofterity by his Son Chus.\nThe Phoenicians by his Son Canaan whom Noab\ncurfed.\nThe ^Egyptians by his Son Mizraim^ which was\nthe King Ofyris above.\nThe Libyans and Ethiopians by his Sons Phut and\nLud.\nSo that in fhort, Cham was fo exceeding fruitful,\nthat he peopled all Africa^ and fince that, from\nAfrica all America^ and thofe particularly populous\nParts of Afia called Arabia and Syria,\nI expert my light-headed Readers, whofe Wits\nare too volatile for this remote Story, will call this\na dry Subjed, tho' to me I confefs *tis juft the\ncontrary j but as it is too grave for them, I will\nendeavour it ihall not be too long for them > fo to\noblige Folly, and I am fure to the Diflike of the\ntruly wife and folid Heads, I leave off before I have\ndone, that I may not abate that moft fafhionablc\nCuftom of writing moft of that which is plcafant,\nand Icaft of that which is profitable j fo willing is\nyour humble Servant to be a Man of Mode, and\nfuch a Weight does he put on thofe who have real-\nly no Weight in themfelves.\nIn favour then of the Ufage of the Times, and\ntfpecially of the Genius and Temper I mention\nL 1 above.\n\f,48 A S Y S T E M\nabove, I am to leave off thofe grave tho* ufeful Di-\ngreflions, and come back to the Progrefs of Ma-\ngick, the particular Subje6b before me.\nThat the Devil was the Aggreflbr in his new\nCorrefpondence with Mankind is not to be doubted,\nbut that is not fo much our Bufinefs j as to know\nwhen this Correfpondence began, who was the firft\namong Men that carried on the clandeftine Deal-\ning, and how it was managed on both Sides.\nWe have cleared Cham of the Charge, as far as\nProbabilities will go in his Favour^ and the Truth\nis, Cham grew quickly too great, was above the\nOccafion for it, and being the firft, and perhaps\nthe greateft Monarch upon Earth, even before\nJSlinus or Bell {Baal) he had no need of turning\nConjurer and Magician, which became prefently\nthe Work of a meaner Race of Men than Cham%\nfor the Magicians, efpecially fpeaking of them now\nas Witches and Inchanters, were not Kings and\nEmpciors, but the Servants of Kings and Empe-\nrors 5 kept and maintained for the wicked Works\nand Services which they did for them.\nIndeed the Magicians which I mentioned at\nfirft, were Worfliippers of the divine Being, or\neminent Examples of the Homage Men owed\nto the true God 5 nay, and even after fome\ntime were Teachers of divine things too, tho'\nunder the miftaken Mediums of Idols and Images\n;\nThefc Magi^ or Magicians, as I have obferved,\nwere at firlt fo reverenced and honoured by\nthe Nations they ferved, as often to be made Go-\nvernours of the Common- wealth -, Publick Be-\nnerfldors having the moft Right to the publick\nHonours and Advancements in thofe Countries\nwhere they had been accepted for their Merits.\nHence it feems moft natural, that all Kings\nfhould be Patriots, feeing the very Name and Dig-\nnity, much more the Office, began in the Thing 5\nbut\n\fof M A G I C K. 145,\nbut that by the ways ^ow far the Patriot and the\nRoyalty go together in thefe Days, how the Name\nand the Dignity correfpond, lee the Kings of the\nEarth examine, whofe Bufinefs it is to mend it\nwhere it is not fo, and to let it be more known\nwhere it is.\nIt is then pretty hard to find out who were the\nfirft Magicians, taking the Word Magick as I now\nunderftand it, viz. in the worft Senfe; and yet it\ndoes not feem to be very long after the Flood be-\nfore we {hall find fome of them at workj for in the\nimmediate Reign after Cham^ that is, in the Reign\nof Mizraim or Ofyris^ which Hillory makes to be\nthe Pharaoh whofe Dream Jofeph interpreted, and\nwho reigned two hundred fixty one Years 5 in his\nReign 'tis evident there were fuch People.

He fent and called for all the Ma^\ngicians of yEgypt, and all the wife Men thereof.\nIt is true it does not appear pofitively that thefe\nwere Magicians of the worfl: Sort, but it feems to\nbe fo, becaufe Heaven referved from them the re--\nvealing to Pharaoh the Interpretation of his Dreams j\nwhich however might be to preferve the Honour\nto Jofeph^ and to make way for all the great Events\nwhich followed J but ftill, I fay, we do not know\nthat here were none of the prefent kind of wicked\nMagicians, and we have much reafon to believe\nthere were.\nBut within the Space of about two hundred Years\nafter, we are fure to find them > nay, the Text is\nplain, they were there when Mofes and Aaron ftood\nbefore the laft Pharaoh who held the People ia\nCaptivity 5 for then they imitated the Miracles of\nMofes and ylaron by their Inchantments, that is, by\nSorcery and Witchcraft \\ now even this was but a\nlittle above eight hundred Years from the Flood 1\nand thus much may fufficc for the Chronology of\nof Witchcraft and Sorcery,\nh 3 Bu^\n,\/\n\fJO A SYSTEM\nBeing thus come to a tolerable Certainty as to\nTime, when this Art was firft pra6bifed, wc fhall\nbe led more diredly to the Perfons, by entring\na little into an Enquiry after the Pra\u00abSi:ice, that is,\nthe Manner made ufe of in thofe early Times of the\nArt 5 for by difcovering what they did, we fhall dif-\ncover alfo who did it : They a6ted certainly from\nthe Beginning, by certain Myftick or concealed\nConjurations, fuch as uncouth Noifes and Sounds,\nllrange Geftures, Poftures, and barbarous Magick\nNoifes, of which we fhall fay more in their Place.\nBut what, fay our Enquirers, were thofe things\ncalled Inchantments, which conftitute what is called\nthe Black Art^ or the Craft Magical ? The Text\nfays the Magicians did fo and fo, by their InchanU\nnients'i that is, whatever Wonders or Miracles the\ntwo Prophets of God wrought by the Finger and\nPower of God, thefe Men imitated by the Power\nof the DeviL\nThofe Inchantments I take to confift of certain\nagreed Geftures and Noifes, certain barbarous\nNames and Words, and fuch inexplicable Terms of\nhellifti Art, which upon Concert between Hell and\nthe helliih Agent, are to be fo and fo underftood\nbetween them 5 on exprefling of which, and mak^\ning fuch Circles and Figures on the Ground as is\nagreed, the evil Spirit with whom they have con^\nCerted the Affair beforehand, fhall appear, and ap-^\npear too in fuch and fuch Form as they appoint to\nbring him out inj and this I give as a brief Defini-\ntion of what they call Inchantment.\nAnd here, not to preach upon the Point, or to\ninfift that even what is thus aded muft be by the\nJPower of Heaven concurring, for this is what all\nthat are not Atheifts acknowledge j but, I fay, not\nto dwell on this Part, I make fo free with our\nFellow-Conjurers as to fay, they put a great deal of\nCheat upon the World, in pretending to a\u00a3b by\nfu-\n\fof M A G I C K, ij\nfupernatiiral Powers in thofe Inchantments, let\nthem be of whac fort they will, whereas they really\na6bed much by Cheat and Trick, Legerdemain or\nSlight of Hand, and pretended the Prince of the\nAir, when he had nothing to do in it> that how-\never fome of thofe things were certainly by his,\nthe Devil's Aid and Aflillance, as it was with Alt\nAlhrahaxen^ and has been with others to this Day,\nwhich we fhall not and cannot deny, yet 'tis appa-\nrent much of it has been, as I faid, meer juggling\nand deceiving.\nAs the Devil has not tied himfelf up to Methods\nin his a6bing with Mankind, fo neither have the\nMagicians of the World kept to any certain Me-\nthods, as to a ilated Rule in their Adings among\nus, but have, on many Occafions, made ui'e of ait-\nfering Methods 5 1 mean as to their Management\nbetween the Devil and them \u2022, and alfo as to their\napparent putting the Belief of it upon us.\nHow we Ihall do to know and diftinguifh when\nthe Magician puts the Devil upon us, and when he\nonly a6i:s the Juggler, would be worth while to\nfind out 5 and did either the Devil or the M^^gician\na6t by any flated Rules and Methods, we might\nmake fome Judgment about it 5 but on the othef\nhand, they are fo much and fo often both Devils and\nboth Jugglers, that 'tis very difficult to fix them.\nFor Example, in their coming to Audience, ob*\ntaining Admittance, or call it what you will, the\ngreat Queftion is, How do they let the Devil know\nthey want to fpeak with him ? either he is always\nat their Elbow, and can hear them whenever they\ncall, where-ever they are, and on whatever Occa-\nfion i and that would be to afcribe either great\nthings to him, as a Perfon, or a great N.'mber to\nhim, as an Hoft.\nBe that as it will, 'tis certain thefe People have\ncertain concerted Terms agreed, as I faid above, up-\non repeating which he is to appear to theois and\nL 4 aft\n\fija A S Y S T E M\naft for them as they fhall agree, and thofc I call\nInchantments. There arc alfo other agreed Signals,\nupon making which, the Devil^ according to the\nTerms agreed on between them, flaall a6t in fuch\nand fuch a manner without appearing j and thofe\nI call Charms.\nThus, it feems, the Devil and Dr. Boreman agreed\n.the Matter 5 the good Dodor having a mind to\npay home an old Jeft upon a young Gentleman that\nhad abufed a poor Girl, a (>lientof his> theDoftor,\nit feems, told her, that if fhe could perfwadc him\nXQ get into her Smock upon their next Intimacy,\nhe would certainly agree to marry herj upon which\nthe poor Girl makes herfelf a new one, and very\nlarge for the Purpofe, and getting the young Fel-\nlow into it, the Do6tor, as was faid, laid fuch a\nCharm upon it, or the Devil by his Order, that\nthe Fellow could never gee out of it till he gave\nthe Girl a Note under his Hand to marry her the\njiext Morning, and accordingly did it.\nIf the Story be Fad, as is loudly affirm'd, the\nJDevil afted upon the honeft fide it feems 3 which I\ndo not however charge upon him as a thing that\nhe is often guilty of > but now and then, for the\nCredit of his Employers, he may be allowed to go\nout of his Way a little.\nWhat thofe things called Charms are, and how\nmade ufe of, may occafion fome Speculation as we\ngo on, and when we come to fpeak of Charms\nas they are ufed between the Magicians and the Peo*\nple> but I am now upon the Subjeft of Charms\nand Inchantments, as they relate to the proper In-\ntercourfe between the Magician and the Devil, or\nthe Spirit whom he a\u00a3l:s with, or by or for whom\nhe afts, for 'tis not eafy to exprefs it right.\nI fay, 'tis not eafy to fay in what Capacity the Ma-\ngician is to be undcrftood to aft. i.

Whether the Devil\nis Mafter, which I muft own is more likely, and\nthe Magician Servant 5 and then he does not aft\nthe Devil^ but the Devil a6ts him, and makes him\ndo every thing he bids him> I fay all thefe arc\ndoubtful Points, and not yet fully underftood by'\nus, or at lead not eafily.\nBut be it which of thefe it will, there mufl be\nfome concerted Terms of come and call between\nthe Devil and his Correfpondents j like Ships at\nSea, they muftconverfeby Signals, they muft know-\nwhen to meet, and when tofummons for a meetings\nwhen to appear, and when to difappear j and to do\nthis, is one of the conftituting Parts of Magick 5\nfor without it the Magician is as good as no body,\nand the Devil in fliorc would appear of no ufe to\nhim.\nIn fome Parts of India they alledge to this Day,\nthat heistalk'd with in theapparent Shapeof aMan,\nand in the Habit of their Prielts> but that is not the\nBufinefsi they add that whenever they want tofpeak\nwith him, they go up to fuch and fuch Mountains\nin Troops or Affembliesi fuch as ours at Ne-w^\nHall perhaps, only v\/ith fome fpecifick Differences,\nwhich I might mention but that they are too\ntrifling\n\f,j4 A S Y S T E M\ntrifling to trouble you with. When they are all\ntogether, they call him with a little Kettle-Drum,\njuft as I told you the good old Wives hive their\nBees, fave that they beat it on the wrong fidej\nthen they pronounce fome Words which they call\nCharms, and the Devil comes without fail.\nIt is hard to find out in Hiftory, what Words\nthofc were, that were us'd for Charms in jEgyptj\nand Arabia^ between the Devil and the Magicians\nfor fo many Agesj it is certain they difFer'd in dif-\nfering Countries, and 'tis as certain they difFer'd as\nthe feveral Perfons a6i:ed together or apart j but\nI am as much at a lofs to find out what the Devil\nfhould mean by fuffering thofe Words, or any\nWords at all, to charm, call, awaken or alarm him,\nas I am to know what the Words wercj but at\nprefent let us think of the Words.\nThe Greeks have left us a Word, which was us'd\nby the Magicians of Antiquity among them, upon\nthefe and many more fuch Occafions. This is that\nfamous Trine, or Triangular Word call'd Ahraca\"\ndahra^ which drawn out in its Equilateral Sides\nftands thus.\nABRACADABRA\nABRACADABR\nABRACADAB\nABRACADA\nABR A C AD\nABRAC A\nA B R A C\nAB R A\nABR\nAB\nA\nThere is abundance of learned Puzzle among the\nAncients to find out the Signification of this\nWord 3 the fubtle Poilcioa of the Letters gave a\nkia4\n\fof M A G I C K. lyj\nkind of Reverence to them, becaufe they read ic\nas it were every way, upwards and downwards,\nbackwards and forwards, and many will have it ftiil\nthat the Devil put them together: Nay, they be-\ngan at laft to think it was old Legion's Sirname, and\nwhenever he was call'd by that Name, he ufcd to\ncome very readily j for which reafon the old Wo-\nmen in their Chimney-corners would be horribly\nafraid of faying it often over together, for if they\nfhould fay it a certain number of times, they had\na Notion it would certainly raife the DeviL\nThey fay on the contrary, that it was invented\nby one Bafilides a learned Greeks that it con-\ntained the great and awful Name of the Divinity, and\nthat it was ufed for many Years for the oppoling\nthe Spells and Charms of the Pagans j that is, the\nDiabolical Spells and Charms of the Pagan Magi-^\ncians.\nBut be this as it will, it fell into Contempt in\nafter- Ages, and was ufed by the Magicians them-\nfelvesj fo that its containing, or being intended to\ncontain the Name of God^ feeras to me to be a\nPretence only, to add a kind of Veneration to the\nWord J whereas it it now drop'd, only that fome\nof our old Women, and quack Magicians^ ufe it\nfor a Spell or Charm, as they would have it call'd,\nto cure Agues, being written on a piece of Parch-\nment, and hang'd about the Neck of the afili6ted\nPerfon.\nIt would be nothing but crowding our Work\nwith old Stories, to colle6fc together what they call\nSpells and Charms, which our People here make\nufe of, (where-cver they had them) to cure Diftem-\npers. I know an old Book-ridden Bunyanift^ that\nis to fay, a Baptift Preacher in Beclfordfiire^ who\ncur'd Agues, by only faying fome Words, while he\ngave the Patient a piece of Paper to pur. mro his\nPockets others I have l^nown cur'd by laying\nfome\n\ft^6 A S Y S r E M\nfome Words only, and giving them nothing at alL\nI could give you many Examples, and you will find\nmany more in the learned Colledions of Mr. Auhery^\nand others, where in particular there is the Que-\nHion anfwer'd, Why faying fome Words which\nhave no Signification, and which neither the Per-\nIbn to whom they are faid, or the Perfon himfelf\nwho fays them, can underftand, fhould work a Cure j\nand the Anfwer is, becaufe the Gods underftood\nwhat the Perfon meant, who firft implor'd their\nAid in thofe Words, and to which they have- flill\nregard.\nThis fhews a little, what I am ^bringing all\nthefe things toj namely, that this was the Remains\nof the old Pagan Magick, and is all derivM from\nit, tho' perhaps it is pra6bis'd with lefs crimi-\nnal Correfpondence than it was then, the People\nthat now do thefe things not knowing what they\nfay, or to whom they fay it, yet certainly the thing\nis the fame.\nAnd this too gives us a light into the ancint Pra-\nflrices of the Magicians in Arabia^ and JEgyp^ and the\nNature of thofe things which the Scripture calls\nJnchantmentsj and how, and to what ufes thofe\nInchantments were obtained and apply'd. take The\nwhole in this fummary Account, which I gather\nfrom the exacteft Obfervation of the ufage of thofe\nTimes, and of the behaviour of the People in the\nfollowing Ages.\nOf the Nature and Original of Inchant-\nments,\nThe Story of the Devil Sind Alt Alhrahazen the Sa^^\nhean or Per\/tan^ {lands as a good Foundation j wc\nhave another without a Name, an Mgyptian^ 1 will not\nadd a Name by way of Invention^ becaufe I will nox.\n\fof M A G 1 C K. ,j7\nput my Sanftion to the Truth of all the Particulars,\nbut the Story is of the fame Ufe, whether one\nWord of the Fad be true or no. And fo, the' I\nmight take up fome time with Vouchers for the\nRelation, I leave it upon yotir Hands as a current\nTradition, for thofe things are too ancient for\nQuotation of any fort.\nN. B, There is no room to queflion, but that\nin Arahia^ -^gJPU S)riaj and thofe Countries,\nwhere fo much Magick was at firft pra<5bis'd,\nand where the Devil's Correfpondence with\nMankind was begun, where Magick was in\nits Perfection for fo many Ages, and praftis'd\nwith fuch apparent Succefs, there are a great\nmany ftrange Stories current to this Day, and\nthe Mouths of the People are ftill fiU'd with\nTraditional Accounts of the Wonders of the\nAncients 5 their ftrange Perfomances, and the\nEffects of their Magical Skill 5 the People are\nfull of them, and even our Europeans, when they\ntravel into thofe Countries, bring away innu-\nmerable Tales of this kind, which lofe little in\nthe coming, as perhaps this among the reft.\nThe Account I am now going to give, relates to\na Magician of great Note it feems, tho', as I have\nfaid, I have not his Name, whom the Devil^ if it\nwas the Devil^ managed much in the fame way as\nthe other, and 'tis of like ufe in the Cafe before us.\nFor as it confirms the DeviPs Condu6t to be much\nthe fame with Mankind, tho' in different Places,\nfo it ftiews us that the fame occafions fuit him to\nmake ufe of : Before, he frighted the Sabeans with a\nMeteor or Ball of Fire in the Air 5 Now he alarms\njEgypt with a Comet 5 either of them things of no\nSignification in themfelves, and which we in thefc\ndays can look on without running to Conjurers\nfor their Interpretation: But in thofe younger\ndays\n\f,j8 A S Y S T E M\ndays they were furprifing and terrifying, and there-*\nfore very proper to amufe the World with, and\nto make even Kings, as well as People, fend for\ntheir Magicians^ to enquire after the Events of\nthem.\nIn like manner we find in both thefe Accounts,\nthe Devil nor only making ufe of Dreams for di-\nflurbing the Fancies of the People, as well their\nKings as others; but we find him in both w^m^\nthat Power peculiar to him as a Spirit, namely, of\ncaufing People to Dream of this, or that, (whatever\nhe pleafes) on purpofe to furnifli a Counterfeit In-\nterpretation to his Favourite Southfayer, and raife\nhis Reputation at Court, in order to ferve his (Satan\\)\nIntereft in other fubfequent DeluGons : But I refer to\nthe Story.\nKnArahan of Ancient Fame, and Eminent in the\nJEgyptian Court for his great Skill in South-fay-\ning, having long ftudied the Knowledge of hidden\nand fecret things, and arriv'd to great Skill in the\nMotions and Revolutions of the Stars and Planets,\nhad made himfelf famous on that Account : Having\nalfo much ftudied the Appearances and Nature of\nthe Planets, Vapours, Meteors, and other the\nPhenomena of the upper Regions, from whence he\nmade great and accurate Improvements in Natural\nand Experimental Philofophy j he alfo ftudied and\nunderftood the nature of Plants, Flowers, Drugs,\nGums, \u00a35?^. and the Influences of the Hea-\nvenly Bodies upon them, giving them Virtue, Co-\nlour, Aromatick Flavour, and moft healing and\ncomforting Powers-, and by this Knowledge, our\nLearned Arabian obtained the Fame of a moft excel-\nlent Phyfician, as well as of a wife Man, and\nSouthfayer, and was had in univerfal Efteem,\nbut efpecially I fay in the Court of Pharaoh King\nof Mgypt,\nN.B.\n\fof M A G 1 C K. ijt^\niV. B, They do not tell us which Pharaoh this\nwas, fo that the Chronology of this Ara^\nhian is fomething defedive in that Partj but\nneither is this very material, becaufe much of\nit will bedifcover'd by the other Circumftances.\nUnwearied in his Diligence and Studies, and\neaten up with the Defire of Knowledge, this^r^^;^;^\nDodor (for fuch we fhall now call him) not at all\nabating his Search after Wifdom by the Fame al-\nready obtain'd j but feeing daily that there was an\nAbyfs of Knowledge yet behind, and that all he\nknew was as nothing, compared to what he was ftill\nignorant of, he purfued his Search into Nature\nwith the utmoft Application: All Night, yea many\nNights together, he continued upon the Hills, and\nin the Defarts, whither he wandered j for Mgypt is\na plain Country for many Leagues together, from\nMemphis where he redded. I fay, all Night he fpent\nin looking up into Heaven, and all Day in poring\nupon the Earth, fearching into the Secrets of Na-\nture, and trying and proving the Virtues of the\nPlants and Fruits, and other Rarities, the Produd:\nof that rich and fertile Soil : And thus he wailed\nand exhaufted his vital and animal Strength,\nto feed and nourifli the Strength of his Mind, and\nfill his Head and Heart with Divine Wifdom and\nUnderllanding. Thus far it muft be acknowleg'd\nhe was a true Original Magician, and a Man of\nMerit as well as Fame.\nIt happened in his wandering through the De-\nfart, to the Station where he ulually fix'd his Place\nof Aftronomick Obfervations, that he faw rife up\nout of the Sea, Northward from his Situation, a\nBody of Fire, which at firft feem'd to him one\nplain Flame, making an oblong Square, of an im-\nmenfe Length and Breadth. But as it afcended with\nthe ordinary Motion of the Heavens, or rather ac-\ncording\n\fiSo A S r S T E M\ncording to the new Syftems^ the ordinary Motion of\nthe Earth, it lefTen'd in its apparent Dimenfions^\nand alfo came to bear a more regular Form than be^\nforej till coming to its full Height it appcar'd af-\nter fome time to be a Comet or Blazing-ftar^ which\nwas vifible above the Horizon, as is ufual in fuch\nBodies, for about twenty fix Days (or Nights rather)\nfucceffively, and then was feen no more.\nThis Appearance being entirely new, furmount-\ned all the powers of his Underflanding,and extreme-\nly perplcx'd him 5 and being one Night more than\nerdinarily afflifted about it, he broke out into\nWords to this purpofe, tho' not dire61:ed to any of\nthe Gods, not knowing it feems which of them\nwere able to inform him, and which not. Of that\nfome of the blejfed Inhabitants of the unseen\nWorld would affift me in fearching out the Myfiery\nof this firange Phenomenon,\nHe was the more anxious about it, becaufe, at\nhis return to his own Houfe at Memphis^ he had an\nAccount, that Pharaoh had fummon'd all the Ma-\ngicians and wife Men of Mgypt^ to give him their\nfcveral Opinions of the meaning of this flrange Ap-\npearance i for the King had either feen ir, or heard\nof it from others. The Appearance of it, as I\nhave faid, being conftant for about twenty fix\ndays after the Arabian had firfl difcover'd itj and\nthe wife Men differing very much in their Accounts\nof ir, their Judgment had encreas'd the King'^\nCuriofity very much 5 bcfides, the Arabian South-\nfayer had notice given him, that he would receive a\nSummons or Order to come to the King's Palace\nupon the fame Occafion.\nBeing thus, as is faid, extremely puzzled with\nthis Affair, and believing perhaps that he fhould\ndo no more when he came to the King, than dif^\ncover his Ignorance, as the refl of the Southfayers\nand the Magicians had done, he was very uneafyy\nandi\n\fof M A G I C K. 16\n\u00abnd refolv'd to retire into Mthiopia for fome time,\ntill the Enquiry might be over> and as he was not\nfent for to the King, when the refl of the Magici-\ncians were, it would be no Impeachment of his\nFame, that he was gone abroad for fome time.\n'J. One Day, while this publick Uncafinefs lafted,\nas he was walking towards his ufual Obfervatory as\nabove, there joynM him a grave and venerable old\nMan, who faluting him with the ufual Blefling of the\nTimes, and in the Arahick Tongue, falls into Dif-\ncourfe with him upon divers Subje6bs, fuch as feem'd\nto fhew that the Stranger was, like himfelf, an En-\nquirer after Knowledge. Among the reft of their\nDifcourfe, the Arabian particularly gave the Stran-\nger an Account of the late Appearance which he\nhad feen, as above.\nThey walk'd together till they came to the Foot\nof a gently rifing Mount, on the Top of which\nthe Arabian had ere6ted for himfelf a little Hut, or\nBower of Palm-tree Leaves 5 here the Stranger\nfeeing him ready to go up to the Hill, ofFer'dto take\nhis Leave, but he entreated him to go up to his\nObfervatory (as he call'd it^ with him, and to ftay\nwith him that Night, that he might fhew him the\nfaid Appearance, and that in the Morning he fhould\ngo whither he pleas'd.\nWhen they were come up to the Afcent of the\nHill, the Day being Ihut in, -and the time for Ob-\nfervation of the Stars come on, the Heavens being\nclear, and the Moon abfent under the Horizon,\nleaving them a fair View of the Stars, perfectly\nbright and clear; the Stranger ask'd him, in what\npart of the Hemifphere he had {czw the Comet rife\nand fet, and what was the particular Sphere of its\nMotion; all which he fnew'd him m 'ft exadly,\nand at laft the Comet it felf, not forgetting at the\nfame time to let the Stranger know, how anxious\nand concern'd he had been to undcrftand the Na-\nM ture\n\fi6t A S T S r E M\nture and Reafon, as well as the Import of the Ap#\npearanceof fuch a Body, and to what particular Na-\ntion it had a Reference 5 and at laft told him, how\nvehemently he had call'd out to the Gods, to give\nhim fomc wife Interpreter, to inllru\u00a3t him in the\nNature of fuch Appearances, and of that in parti-\ncular.\nThe Stranger took no notice of his knowing that\nhe had done fo, but began with a Philofophical\nDifcourfe of Comets 5 as of Stars, which, in their\nordinary Revolutions, are but feldom vifiblcj and\ntherefore when they do appear, fays he, it is generally\nfuppofed that they import great Changes and Trou-\nbles among Men, which, fays he, may in one\nSenfe be true, becaufc they frequently are very\nmuch the occaiion of them.\nBut, fays the Arabian^ how fhall we know when\nthey have Important Significations, and when not,\nand to what Nations and Countries their Significa-\ntions are dircded, and which are not concern'd in\nthem ?\nSays the Stranger, There are Methods to know\nthefe things alfo j and the Gods, when they arc\nminded to communicate thefe things, do it their\nown way. But Father^ fays the Arabian^ if you can\nrelieve my Thought in the Signification of the\nprefent Difficulty, pray be fo kind j for I acknow-\nledge my Ignorance, and that which perplexes m\u00ab\nthe more about it, is, that I cxpe\u00a3t to be call'd be-\nfore Pharaoh to-morrow, whom I reverence in the\nhigheft manner. I befeech you inform mc what I\nam to call this ftrange new Appearance, and what\nare its Confequenccs to the World.\nHere the Stranger looking upon him with a fmiling\nAfped, reply'd > I have great Regard for your be-\ning efteem'd by Pharaoh^ and fhall let you into the\nKnowledge of what you defire, for your farther\ngood Fortune. Know then, added he, with an\nAfped\n\fof M A G I C K. x6^\nAfpeft all fliining and pleafant, ^ The Appearance\n' we now fee, is a Comet or Blazing- ftar, the like of\n* which has not been feen in ^^7\/>; in the Memory of\n' the moft ancient Man in the Kingdom, which\n* makes the wife Men entirely at a lofs about irj\n* neither have they receiv'd any traditional Account\n' of fuch a Phenomena from their Fathers.\n* Comets, continued he, are not, as fix'd Stars, Bodies\n' of Fire, burning in the fame manner as the Sun > but\n' Bodies of a different Nature, compos'd either of\n* prepared created Matter, fuitcd from the begin-\n' ning for Inflamation, or of vaft Colleftions of ex-\n* hard and condens'd Matter, fubjeft to Inflama-\n' tion, and more or lefs inflam'd according to the Po-\n^ fition of their Orbits and Motion j and therefore\n* the Eruption of their Flame is but on one fide,\n* or on one fide chiefly, (as we fee this burning)\n* with a continued and vehement Eruption : They\n' move in the utmoft Extent of the Wafte or Ex-\n* pancc of Space, which you call the jEther or Air,\n* and their Diftance is fo great, and their Revolu-\n* tions fo tedious, that they fometimes do not come\n^ fo near this Globe as to be vifible, no not in ^wq\n* hundred or a thoufand Years j and this is the fe-\n' cond that was ever feen in this Hemifphere, fince\n* the great Deluge of the Earth, in the Years of\n' Pharaoh's Great Grandfather's Father, being now\n* above eight hundred Years paft.\n' The long Tail, or extended Flame which you\n* fee at one fide of the Star, is the Eruption of\n' Flame, which, as I fay, continually Burns with\n' great Violence, and is fometimes extended to an\n* immenfe and unmeafurable Length, even to that\n^ of many hundred thoufand Millions of Stadia^\n' and blazes out for ever.\nThe Arabian heard this with a furprife of Plea-\nfure, and was even ready to kneel down and wor-\nftiip him i which you will fay 'tis much the Deiil\nMi {hould\n\f1(^4 A S r S T E M\nfliould refufe : But when he was juft going to en-\nquire of him what Import this Appearance was to\nthe World, and to jEgypt more efpecially, and a-\nbove all to the King in particular, he was not only\n. difappointed to the laft degree, bur moft miferably\nafflicted and furpris'd 5 for that turning his Head\ncafually from him, or rather his Head being turn'd,\nor his Eyes turn'd from him, he in that very Mo-\nment difappeared, and was gone.\nIt was in vain that the AraVian Doftor ran out\nof the Hut or Bower, and down the Hill after him,\nto his two Servants, who always attended him at\nthe Foot of the Hill, enquiring of them if the\nFather, the venerable Stranger, came not to them 5\nthey conftantly and faithfully afErm'd that they\nhad watch'd, as was their Duty, againft wild Beafts\nfor his Security, and that nothing had pafled by\nthem.\nIt was in vain alfo, that he went back lamenting,\nand calling aloud upon the Stranger, whom he ftyPd\nFather^ to return. How is it^ faid he, that you could\nthus far illuminate my Underftanding^ and reveal the\nfecret of Wifdom but in part \\ promiftng to me a clear\nand perfect Knowledge^ and then leave me uninftru6led^\nand in the dark^ in the main and grand Inquiry? But\nno Voice, no Appearance returned, which affli6ted\nhim fore 5 and the Day appearing, herefolv'd to con-\ntinue there the next Night, in hopes he might fee\nhim again in the Evening, as he had done before.\nAfter refolving on this, and having been waking (as is\nfaid) all Night, he laid him down to fleep. He was\nno fooner fallen into a deep Sleep, but he dream'd\nthat he faw, (or, to fpeak it in the Language of the\nEaft,} the ancient Father, the venerable Stranger,\nappeared to him again in a Dream,\nHe was moft agreeably furpriz'd with the Sight\nof him, and according to the Eallern.

When I had\n* therefore told thee, that it was only an ordinary\nM 5\n' Revo-\n\f%66 A S r S T E M\n* Revolution of a Comet, I in efFed told thee that\n^ it imported nothing, either to Pharaoh or to\n' thee, or to any Perlon or Place whatever.\nThe Arabian^ furpvis'd, and yet informed by this\nDifcourfe, flood juilly reprov'd, and for a while an-\nfwer'd not a Wordj which the Vifion as it were\nobferving, fpoke again as follows.\n' Tho' 1 have given thee iufficient Light, where-\n* by to expole the If^norancc of the wife Men,\n* who have been call'd before Pharaoh^ yet there\n* are many things which thou mayft fay to the\n' King, which are of great Importance to him and\n* his Kingdom to know, which thou (halt be\n* enabled by me to give him the Knowledge of,\n* and which, if thou diligently liften to my Inftru-\n^ dions, ihall fet thee at the right Hand of the\n* King in all his Councils, and caufe thee to be c-\n* fttcm'd the wifeft Man in his Kingdom: But\n* then thou muft be very careful to obferve all the\n* Rules which I fhall give thee, and to afi: in ex-\n* aft Obedience to them.\nThe Doftor awaking, and the Vifion being end-\ned, he now began to underftand who it was he\nhad been converfing with, namely an Angel of the\ninvifible World, (I fuppofe the Word Devil was\nnot known among them at that time,) and that for\nthe future he had a fair Opportunity of good In-\ntelligence from the other World, upon all necef-\nfary Occafions, and upon the mod important En-\nquiries.\nComforted exceedingly with this Intelligence,\nhe haftens back to the City, and being fent for to\nappear before the King, as he expeded, Pharaoh\ntold him the Occafion of his fending for him, and\nhow the Southfayers and wife Men were puzzl'd\nand perplex'd about it, but could give him no Ra-\ntional Account of it.\nUpon\n\foj M A G 1 C K. 167\nUpon this the Arahian told the King, that he\nwas forry to find him, Pharaoh^ made fo uneafy by\nthe Apprehenfions of a thing, which tho' above\nthe Reach and Underftanding of the Magicians,\nhad yet in it nothing Extraordinary, nothing ouc\nof the Courfe of Nature 5 that there was nothing\nin it more than the neceflity of its own Motion\noccafion'd, and that it had therefore no portentous\nImport or Signification to Pharaoh^ or co any of\nhis People, or of his Dominions^ and that this he\nmight be aflur'd of.\nThen he went on, and gave the King an Ac-\ncount of the Nature of the thing, as a Comet or\nBlazing'ftar \u2022, and that Word for Word as the an-\ncient Stranger or Spirit had deliver'd it 5 and this\nhe did too in the Audience, not of Pharaoh only,\nbut of his whole Court 5 and that with fuch a ge-\nneral Applaufe, that all the other Magicians and\nSouthfayers acknowledged the Juftice and Reafon\nof what he faid, and the King was made perfedly\ncafy upon that Account. From whence they tell\nus, that the Mgyptians^ tho' in other Cafes the\nmoft fuperftitious People in the World, and that\nufed formerly to be the mod concerned upon all\nnew Phanomena in the Heavens, or upon any un-\nufual Appearances, flying immediately to the Divi-\nnations, and to their Southfayers, and Magicians, to\ninterpret and account for fuch things to them, are\nyet, ever fince this Difcovery by the^r^^\/^\u00bbSouth-\nfayer fo long ago, under no Concern at all upon\nthe Appearance of Comets or Blazing-Jiarsy on any\nAccount whatfoever.\nBut I return to the Arabian, It was no fmall\nFame which he gain'd by the Solution he had given\nof this Appearance of a Comet y Pharaoh preferred\nhim before all the Magicians of Mgypt,^ and exalt-\ned him to divers Honours, but particularly to that\nof being near his Perfon, to eounfcl and advifc\nM 4 hiru\n\fi58 A SYSTEM\nhim upon all extraordinary Occafions, as well in\nMatters of State and Politicks, as Matters of Dif-\nficulty : Nor did the reft of the Magicians envy\nhim the Honours he enjoy'd, for they were\nconvinc'd he merited all the King had done for\nhim^ and which was more, fhey did not find they\ncould come at any Part of the extraordinary Intel-\nligence or Underilanding in things, which he was\nJViafter of.\nIn the mean time, as he was too wife to commu-\nnicate to any body the fource of his Information, fo\nhe was too well fatisfied with his new Intelligence,\nto neglc61: the Part he was directed to a6b, which\nwas frequently to meet with the Vifion, which had\nonce been lo favourable to him : In a word, he foi-\nlovv'd with the greateft Affiduity the begun Inti-\nmacy, and fail'd not to attend the very next Night\nin particular, after he had made his Speech con-\ncerning the Comet before the King.\nOn that occafion, going towards his Obfervatory\nas ufual, he was encounter'd by a Man, in the Ha-\nbit of an uEthiopian^ riding upon a Mule, and having\na Bow hanging over his Shoulder, a Sheaf of Ar-\nrows at his Side, and a Lance in his Hand > the Man\nfeem'd to fliun him, and ofFer'd to go forward, but\nprefently turn'd back, and with a kind of Compli-\nment to the Arabian Do6i:or, enquir'd of him, if there\nwere any way for him to Foord through the River\nISIilus^ which at that time of the Year was fo low,\nas to be in fome Places almoft dry, and eafily paf-\nfable on Horfe-back. The Arabian courteoufly an-\nfwer'd him, that there was not any Place near the\nRoad or Track which he was going in, and that he\nbeing as he perceiv'd a Stranger and alone, it\nwould be hazardous for him to venture 5 but that\nif he would be pleas'd to ftay, and go with him to\na little Hut which he had hard by, for his Retreat in\nthe Night, he would guide him in the Morning\nto\n\fof M A G 1 C K. i6^\nto a Place where he fliould pafs the River with\nSafety.\nThe Traveller thank'd him for the kind Offer, but\nleem'd rather inclin'd to go on > Sir, fays the Arahiayiy\nthe Night approaches, and you may meet with o-\nther Dangers in the way from Crocodiles, Lions,\ni^c. prefling him again to flayj but he declin'd\nit again, and as to the Dangers he laugh'd at\nand defpis'd them s Well then, fays the kind hofpi-\ntable Arabian^ leu me fend one of my Servants with\nyou to guide you. He feem'd at firft inclin'd to\naccept fo kind an Offer as that was, but falling a lit-\ntle farther into Difcourfe, the Arabian perceiv'd\nthe Stranger began to look pleas'd, and fancying\nhe would accept the firft Offer, viz. of flaying all\nNight, mov'd it again, and with a little additional\nentreating, the Stranger confented to that Part, and\nturned back with them.\nThe Arabian^ tho' with two Servants with him,\nwas always on foot 5 he had himfelf no Weapons, be-\ning without fear but of wild Beads, againft which\nhis two Servants were his Security, who were\narmed with Swords and Lances 5 but the Stranger,\nwell arm'd as above, turning back, they went on\nfearlefs together towards the Hill, which was about\nthe Dillance of two Miles.\n\\x\\ the Way, the Arabian was a little fhock'd\nwith the unufual Civility which a great over-grown\nCrocodile fhew'd them 5 who rufhing out of a\nmarfhy kind of Bog near the Way, came forward\ntowards them, but on a fudden turn'd back, and\nvery obfequioufly crept into the lurking Place,\nwhere it had juft before come oat from, and lay\nffill there as quiet as if it had been hufh*d by its\nown Fears, as perhaps it was.\nAt a fmall Diftance farther they met two She\nLions, or as fome call them Lioneffesj and as they\nheard them growling at fome Didance, before they\nwere\n\f170\n^\nA s r s r E M\nwere feen j they, that is, the Arabian and his two\nServants, began to fhow Ibme Concern about itj\nbut behold, when the Lions appeared, they imme-\ndiately turned about, and fled with the utmofl Pre-\ncipitation.\nAfter a little farther walking, the Arabian turn-\ning to his Gueft, told him, There, pointmg to the\nHill which was clofe at hand, was his little Re-\ntreat, to which he had invited him, and defired\nhim to leave his Mule with his Servants, and to\nwalk up the little Mount with him j which the\nTraveller very readily did, bidding his new Land-\nlord go before to (hew him the way, and he would\nfollow him, as alio he did > but what a Surpnfc\nthink you was the poor Arabian in between Joy\nand Fright, when turning about at the Top of\nthe Afcenc to receive his Gueft, he faw nobody but\nthe ancient venerable Stranger, who had at firil ap-\npeared to him, and from whom he had received\nib much kind Lilhtidtion and Affiftance before.\nThe Apparition (for fuch I fuppofe it fliould be\nnow called) perceiving him in fome Confufion,\nbid him not be furprifed, for he was ftill his Friend,\nand in the fame Difpofition to ferve him as before,\nand asked him whether he came that Night in Ex-\npc6i:ati<;a of meeting him or not 5 to which the A\"\nrabian replyed, He did, hoping to fee him in Perfon\nor in Vifion, having fomething to offer, which he\nhopfd he would be fo kind as to comply with\nhim in.\nUpon asking what it was, he told him, That\nPharaoh had a great Difficulty upon him, and had\nasked him his Opinion therein, and he knew not\nwhat Anfwer to give.\nWhat is this Difficulty Py^j'i the Apparition.\nWhy, fays the Arabian.^ he has a private Account\nfrom his Spies, that fhermesbus^ the General of the\nArmies of Mthiopia., deligns t^ invade him in the\n\fof M A G I C K. 171\nBeginning of the Year, with an infinite Number\nof Troops 5 and as the King is in greater Readintfs\nto begin the War, than the other, he wants my\nOpinion whether he fliall make War upon ^thi-\nopia forthwith, or flay till he is obliged to do it\nin his own Defence.\nGo you back, fays the Spe5lre to him^ and wait\ntill the King fends for you to interpret his Dream\nor Dreams.\nWhat Dream ? y^jj \/^^ Arabian,\nWhy to-morrow Night, fays the SpeBre^ the\nKing fliall dream, that a black Elephant came up\nto the Gates of his Palace, and that with his mighty\nTusks or Teeth he broke down the Gates, and\nwas entring in to make farther Spoil 5 when the\nGates being, as I fay^ broken down firft, the\nTower which was over the Gates being ihaken\nwith the Fall, fell down foon after upon the Ele-\nphant, and well-nigh crulh'd him to death 5 but\nthat, tho' by his great Strength he bore up the\nWeight, yet he was fo terrified with the Fall of\nthe Tower upon him, that he withdrew into the\nDefart and went quite away.\nAnd what Interpretation fliall I give of this\nDream ? fays the Arabian,\nYou fliall tell him,y^jV^ theSpe6lre^ That the black\nElephant is the King oi jEthiopia-y that he fliall fend\nhis General to invade him, even to the Gates of his\nFrontier City of Zaba^ and fliall enter the Gates\nthereofJ but that the ^Egyptians in Garrifon within\nfliall break out and fall upon him, and tho' by the\ngreat Power of their Troops they fliall efcape, yet\nthat they fliall retire and go back into the Defarts\no\u00a3 uEthiopiaj and not dare to look upon him any\nmore.\nBut what then fliall I advifc to be done ? fays the\nArabian,\nYcu\n\ftyr A S r S T E M\nYou will find it moft rational, fays the SpeHre^ to\nadvife him to begin the War 5 and may promife\nhim Succefs, withoutiFear j but if not, let him place\nvery grear Garrifons in all the Frontier Towns of\nhis Dominions, South, and efpecially in Zah.t or\nZahda-y and let him wait in a good Pofture of De-\nfence, till the Ethiopian Army advances to the Siege\nof that Place i and fo his Dream will come to pats.\nThis was all wonderful 5 the ^rab was furprifed\nwith being thus furnifhed for ingratiating himfelf\nwith his Mafler the King o^ jEgypt j he knew well\nenough, that to be able to make Pharaoh dream\nwhat he plcafed, and then to interpret it how he\npleafed, muft needs make him pafs for a great\nMan, in a Country too fo fuperftitioully addidcd\nto Dreams, and fo uneafie to have thofe Dreams\ninterpreted, as the People o^ jEgypt were.\nThus furnifhed, he goes back to the City, where\nhe heard nothing till the third Day in the Morn-\ning, when the whole Court was in Diforder, all\nFaces feem'd cloudy, and every Mind difturbed\n;\nThe News was foon fpread into all Parts of the\nCity, that the King had had a frightful and\nterrible Dream, which had fo diftraded his Mind,\n('tis fuppofed they did not call him His Majefty)\nthat he could not reft.\nThe wife Men and the Southfayers, Magicians\nand Aftrologers were immediately fentfor in a great\nhurry to give their Opinion, and interpret Pharaoh^\nDream : The Circumftances of the Dream were\nmuch the fame with thofe already mentioned with\nthis Addition, that at the Beginning, Pharaoh be-\ning in a deep Sleep, heard as he thought a fudden\ngreat Noife, that it alarm'd the whole City, and\nthat his Guards, as we call them, or Soldiers which\nwere about him, were awaken'd, but all fled away,\nand that the City was even left without Defence,\nonly that the Gates were fliut.\nThat\n\fof M A G 1 C K.\nTbat in the midft of this Hurry, a monftrous\nblack Elephant, breaking down all before him, and\neven overthrowing the Houfes and Buildings which\nwere without the City, came on, no one refilling\nhim, to the Gates of the City or Caftle where\nPharaoh flept ; that with the Force of his mighty\nTusks, or Teeth, he beat down the Gates thereof^\nbut that the Tower being iliaken alfo. Part of the\nBuilding fell down upon the Back of the Elephant,\nand, as the King thought at firft, had crulhed him\nto Death.\nBut that notwirhftanding the Weight of the\nBuilding which fell down was very great, yet that\nthe Elephant by his mighty Strength bore it felf\nup and received no Injury by it y but being made\nafraid by the great Blow it received, it withdrew,\nand retired into the Defart towards the South.\nNone of the Magicians could interpret this\nDream, or rather, they could not agree in their In-\nterpretations of it 5 fome faid one thing, fome ano-\nther, fo that Pharaoh received no Satisfaftion from\ntheir Interpretations 5 whereupon the Arah^ who\nappeared at Court purpofely to be called in, was\nfummon'd, the King being told that he was there.\nHe came without any Hefitation at the firft Call j\nand the King, with great Appearance of Diftur-\nbance, tells him what a ftrange Dream he had had,\nhow it had difturbed him, and the like, and added,\nthat none of the Interpretations which the wife\nMen had given of it, were fatisfa6tory to him,\nor agreeing with one another. The Arab ha-\nving then demanded a Particular of the King's\nDream, had it related to him as above 5 then he de-\nfired to know what Account the Magicians had\ngiven of it, and how they had interpreted itj which\nwhen he was told, he exprefs'd fome Wonder thac\nthey fhould all amufe the Kingin fuchamanner, and\nfhould fay nothing but what was perfe6lly remote\nfrom the Cafe.

As to the Chronology of it, and when it began,\nin what Ages of the World thofe Arabians began\nto pradife as above, when they fuic dealt in this\nCraft,\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 185\nCrafr, when the jEgyptians began to be their Scho-\nlars, and they the Devil's^ it is not (however ancient)\nfo difficult to come at the Knowledge of in ge-\nneral, as fome other things in the World, which\nyet we think our felves very certain of.\n7'he Scripture^ whether our good Friends that\nread Books in this Age will bear with our quoting\nit in Matters of Religion or no, yet is generally\nallow'd to be a tolerable good Hiftory. Nay, if\nwe may believe fome good Authors, it muft be al-\nlow'd to be the mod ancient Hiftory, and the\nWriting from which all other Authorities take their\nRife 5 that Mofes was long before Berofus^ Horner^\nHejiod^ or in a word, any of the Writers on Earth.\nNor could it be well otherwife, if what is lately\nadvanced is true, that the firft Knowledge of Let-\nters to write by, and to read upon, was di6tated\nto Mofes from Mount Sinai^ by the immediate Re-\nvelation of Heaven. I fay it could not be otherwife.\nFor howfhould they v\/rite before they had Letters, ^\nand knew how to form the found of Words upon\nthe Tables, where they were impreft?\nAs Mofes had the firft Knowledge of Letters, (p\nhe had the firft Knowledge of Things too, and was\ntherefore the beft qualified to be a Colle6lor of\nAntiquities 3 nor was it fo difficult a Matter for A\/o-\nfes to write a Hiftory of the Creation, and of all the\nmaterial Events of things that had happen'd before\nhis time, as fome may imagine: Since by the Cal-\nculations of Time, Mofes might eafily have an Ac-\ncount of thofe things by a fucceffive Supply of\nOral Tradition from Noah himfelf, as you may ga-\nther from the Times wherein he liv'd, and the\nPerfons with whom he had convers'dj of which\ntake the following fhort Sketch, as a leading\nThread or Chain of things diredly confirming my\nArgument.\nIf\n\f%6 A S Y S T E M\nIf Mofes then had the moil early Knowledge of\nthings by a fhort Succeilion of the Perfons relating\nth.m, and that even from Adam and Noah in a\nright Linej and if Mofes had the firft Knowledge\nof Letters, even immediately from a fuperior Hand,\nthen at lead you mu(t allow me, that Mofes was\ncertainly the beft qualify'd to form a Hiftory of\nthe firft things tranfaded in the World 5 and was\nthe firft Man, or at leaft the Man beft able to\nwrite th.it Hiftory down. For who could form a\nHiftory of things they did not know? and\nwho could write before they had Letters to form\nthe Words he was to write by? and who could\nread what was written, unlefs thofe Letters had\nbeen known, and made publick in the World ?\nHence I infer that Mofes was the firft Hiftorian,\nand the Books of Mofes are the firft Hiftory in the\nWorld ; and if the firft, confequently moft likely\nto be the beft Authority > at leaft, as I have faid a-\nbove (and that my Readers may not be pulh'd upon\ntoo hard, to believe thofe Books which they have\nfo ill a reliili of) I fay at leaft, they will allow that\nthe Scripture oz Pentateuch is a tolerable good Hi-\nftory, and that is all I ask of them as a Favour.\nNow to begin with the Chronology of things:\nThe Law given to the Jews from the Mouth of\nthe Oracle upo.i Mount Sinal^ of which Mofes gives\nus the Hiftory, was, according to Sir ff^alter Raleigh\ny\npubliilicd Jm$ Mundi\n'\n^f H*\nJofeph died ^97\u00ae-.\nAlofes was born MH*\nThe Children of \/\/r^^\/ came out of JEgypt 2fiJ.\nBut we find in the Hiftory of Jofeph^ and we\nfind by the Commands to extirpate Witches and\nSorcerers, mention'd in the firft Law given the\nJfroeliies'y I fay, we find the Praftice of Diaboli-\ncal Magick was much more ancient than MofeSj\nnay than Jofeph^ and that it was praftis'd fo long\nago,\n\fof M A G I C K. ,87\nago, not only in Mgjpt^ but in Phoenicia alfoj and\nperhaps in the laft, as Toon as in the firft.\nFirft, It feems that God refolv'd to drive out the\nPhoenicians^ that is the Canaanites^ before the Chil-\ndren of Ifrael^ even for this very Offence among\nothers 5 and I cannot come up to the modern rate\nof Scepticifm, as to believe God would have driven\nthem out of their Country, for a Crime which\nthey were not guilty of 5 and efpecially too, that\nhe would have aflign'd that for a Reafon of it,\nwhich the poor People could have ftood up and elear'd\nthemfelves of, and have faid they did not under-\nftand what it was.\nThis goes far to a Suggeftion, that the Canaa\"\nmtes were guilty of it even four hundred Years be-\nfore, and before God's Promife to Ahram to give\nhim that Country \\ or elfe we muft fuppofe the Ca-\nnaanites condemned to an Explufion before the\nCrime for which they were to be expell'd was\ncommitted j and I can no more come into that than\nthe other.\nCertainly, God's Promife to turn out the Inha-\nbitants for Jbram's Pofterity muft be allow'd to\nbe a Sentence of Condemnation upon the Canaa-\nnites even at that time > and he would not have con-\ndemned them to Banifhmenr, I mean as a Nation,\nfor Crimes which they were not even then guilty\nof5 efpecially that very Crime being afTlgn'd as the\nCaufe of their faid Condemnation and Sentence.\nIf this Argument is juft, as I think it muft be,\nthen I have gain'd the Point as to the A-ntiquity j\nfor then this Crime ofDiabolicalMagick is as ancient\nas Ahrams and 'tis evident Abram was born above\nfifty fix Years before Noah died. How long this\nwicked Trade was known before Abram^ we can-\nnot determine, but may grant it might be fume\nconfiderable time.\nIt\n\f'i88 A S Y S r E M\nIt is certain however that in the Reign of Miz-\nraimy who was but the Grand Ton of Noah^ they\n\"were grown very con(id arable, I mean as to their\nReputation, in the Egyptian Court j and I am wil-\nling to fuppofe my old Arab was one of the Chief,\nif nor one of the firft of them in Mizraim's Reign,\nand perhaps near the Beginning of it : For as the\nDevil introduc'd himfelf as it were Voluntier to\nhim, it Ihould feem that he had no Correfpondents\nof that kind there before, and took that Method to\nbegin his Acquaintance 5 perhaps allowing his\nCorrefpondents to convey the fame Method of In-\ntelligence from one to another, and perhaps to re-\nnew the Contradt as often as he their Inftruftor\nthought fit.\nBut be that how it will, 'tis certain the Devil\nmuil bcAggrefTor, in all Ages, of this Art. He knew\nwell enough how to break in upon them, how to\nfhow himfelf, and make his Appearances to them\nas often as he thought fit j and could begin it, or\nrenew it, how, and whenever he pleas'd. But the\nCafe was quite different on their Side, for no body\nknew how to come at him, they did not fo much\nas know him when they faw him, or know where\nhe liv'd, where he kept his Refidencej how to go\nto him, or fend to him; or, in a word, to have any\nCorrefpondence with him, but jufl as he thought\nfit to enter into a Familiarity with them, and give\nthem Methods and Rules by which they ihould ob-\ntain Audience of him, when, and as often as they\nhad occafion.\nThis being the cafe, it is not to be wonder'd that\nthe Devilj and thofc Men of Craft, became ac-\nquainted very foon in the World; for the Devil is\ntoo diligent to negle6b his own Affairs any longer\nthan till they were ripe for his Agitation.\nHaving then brought all theSouthfaying and Ma^\ngick of the firft Ages as it were within his own\nManage-\n\fof M A G I C K. i8\u00ab)\nManagement, and eftabliih'd a Correfpondcnce with\nthe wife Men of the mod early Times, we are\nnext to examine how it proceeded, and what Pro*\ngrefs it made: And in making this lnquiry5it comes\ndirectly in my way to tcil you a very unhappy\nTruth 5 namely, that the Clergy of thofe times\nfeem to m^ to be the firft Conjurers, and Dealers with\nthe Devil'^ andfoin all the fubfequent Times, and in\nall or mofl of the Diftant Nations of the World; I\nmean next immediately after thofe jEgyptian Pro-\nficients.\nI hope our Moft Reverend, and Right Reverend\nof the facerdotal Order in thefe Days, and in this\nwife Magical Age, will take no Offence at me for\nthis, at Icaft till I have farther and fully explain'd\nmy felf. Far be it from us (and fad would be our\nCircumftances fliould I venture) to fuggeft that any\nof our Clergy fhould be Conjurers, and deal in\nMagick : no, no 5 plenty of Grace,* and paucity of\nBrains, I hope, is our eftablilh'd Protedion from\nfuch a difmal Eruption as that would be upon\nus.\nIn order therefore to explain my felf fully upon\nthis Subjed, I muft go back to the early Ages of\nthe World, even juft where I was before. The\nDevil^ after the Flood, obferving the World begin\nto fill, and that the People fpreading themfelves\nover it, began to People it again, and form them-\nfelves into Nations, and Governments; one of his\nfirft Cares was to debauch ^ their Principles as to\nReligion, to didtate falfe Notions of Homage and\nWorfliip to them, and, in a word, to introduce Ido-\nlatry.\nAs he knew perfedly well the End he aim'd ar,\nfo he was not at a lofs to find out the Means. Ic\nwould be too long a Story to tell you, in what\nmanner he found out Gods for them to worlhip,\nand how he canoniz'd their Heroes for them. The\nTale\n\fipo A SYSTEM\nTale of Ninus or Nimrod appearing to the wife\nMen in a Flame of Fire, and telling them, he was\ngoing juft then up into Heaven, from whence he\nwould always fliine upon them in the Shape of a\nStar, and that they fhould build a Temple to the\nglory of his Memory > that he fhould be call'd\nBaA or Bell^ which is as much as to fay a great\nGod^ and that he would be always ready to help\nthem againft their Enemies, as he was to fight for\nthem while he was alive 5\nI fay, this Tale, fuppofe it but a Tale, was not\nat all unlikely to take with the People, who had\nthe Memory of their dead Hero-King frefli in their\nThought, and who were ready to idolize the very\nempty Sound of his Name. Suppofe the wife Men\nas they caird them, only feign'd, or forg'dthis Story,\nand reported it to the People as a Vifion which\nthey had really feen, tho' they had not feen it at\nall, yet it was not unlikely to make Impreffions upon\nthem, in their firft Ignorance of things.\nBur fuppofe, on the other hand, theDevHj who\nis always awake, fhould have really fhownhimfelf in\nfuch an Appearance, and then have drawn in the\nwife Magicians of that Age, upon feeing fuch a\nSight frightful and horrid like the Z)(?i;\/7, that form'd\nit, to relate (as they might with Truth,) the\nFadt to the People : It was not at all ftrange, that\nthe wife Men mentioned fhould go to the King\nwith that Story alfo j and that he the King, bi-\ngotted by the Magicians^ and terrify'd as they were,\nfhould immediately order a Temple to be erefbed.\nSacrifices to be appointed, and a formal Worfhip\nfet on foot, to the Honour of this great God Bellj\nwhofe Memory was fo high in their Efteem be-\nfore.\nHiftory is very full of the firfl Fury of idok-\ntrous Zeal-, and of the extravagant Branches of\ntheir Devotion, I mean in their Princes. Ni\u00bbus\nbuilt\n\fof M A G I C K. tj>i\nbuilt a Houfe for the Worfliip of Bell^ the Walls\nand Towers are a Prodigy in themfeivesj what the\nmanner of Worfhip was we do not read, tho' af-\nterwards we have the Defcription of their abomi-\nnable Rites, as the Sacrifices to Moloch^ viz. making\ntheir Children to pafs through the Fire j whether\nthey were burnt to Death, or horribly fcorcht. Au-\nthors do not yet refolve us. The King of Moa3\nfacrific'd his Son, the Heir Apparent of his Throne,\nupon the Walls of the City, only to obtain Delive-\nrance from the Siege by the help of his Idol,\nat the Price of his Son's Blood.\nAs thofe Idols were introduc'd by the Art of the\nDevil^ fo it muft be that the Direftion came from\nhim 5 1 mean as to the manner of the Idol-worfliip,\nand that he certainly held an immediate Correfpon-\ndence with the Inftitutors and Managers of the\nIdol Rites.\nThefe were the Magicians and Aftrologers, who\nby his Direftions were inflrufted what Cere-\nmonies, what Rites, what manner of Worfliip to\noffer to their Gods > and as they confultcd the Ma-\ngicians for the Inftitution of their Worfliip, fo in\na few Ages after the Magicians \u2022or Southfayers\nwere their Priefts, and their Priefts were all Ma-\ngicians and Southfayers. Hence the Aurufpices,\nthe Sacrificers, and the Priefts of the feveral Tem-\nples, where Anfwers were given to Queftions, E-\nvents predidted, and the like, were the Givers of\nthofe Anfwers from the Oracle 5 that is in plain\nEnglijh^ the Priefts were Magicians, and the Magi-\ncians were the Priefts, and the Devil brought\nWitchcraft and Idolatry to be at laft but one Sci-\nence.\nAs he correfponded perfonally with M Alhraha*\nzen^ and the old Ara^^ in the Infancy of time, and\nwhen his Kingdom was, as it were, but juft erefting\nand fetting up in the World, fo when that Perfonal\nCorrc-\n\f\u00ab9 A S Y S T E M\nCorrefpondence appear'd fuccefsful in fetting up I^\ndolatry, he made ic equally ufeful for the Propa-\ngating it, and the Magicians became Priefts in the\nTemples of their Gods.\nNothing could be more agreeable to the Priefts\nof their Idols, than this Intimacy with the Infer-\nnal Spirits'j for the Devil^ who was always his\nCraft's Mafter, fail'd not as well to delude the\nPriefts themfelves, as by them to impofe upon the\nWorld 5 nor could he have carry'd on his Game\nupon Mankind without it. For if the Priefts had\nnot believ'd that they convers'd with the Gods,\nwhen really they convers'd with the Devil -y if they\nhad been all let into the Secret, and made to pro-\npagate their Religion as a Cheat upon the World, to\n\\7hich they were to have been privy j if it had all been\nknown to be, as it really was, a Confpiracy againft\nHeaven in Favour of the Devil^ and with real De-\nfign to impofe upon and damn the World, they\nwould never have been brought univcrfally to have\nkept the Devil's Council, and have come into the\nPlot, at the Price of their eternal Felicity^ and the\nSouls of ail their Friends.\nThe DeviPs Plot would certainly have been blown\nlong before it was, and the Priefts of the Oracles\nwould moft certainly have firft or laft have betray 'd\ntheir Mafter, and expos'dthe whole Cheat. But the'\nCafe was evidently this, the Devil found the way to\ndelude and impofe upon the very Priefts themfelves >\nand not only fuggefted to them, but made them\nreally believe, that the Gods convers'd with them,\nthat the Voices they heard, the Anfwcrs didated\nby their Oracles, the Apparitions, (^c. were all the\nreal Appearances of their Gods, thofe in particular\nwhofe Servants and Priefts they were> when in\nTruth it was no more than a grofs Delufton, and an\nAppearance of the Devil,\nI\n\fof M A G 1 C K i5>3\nI make no doubt, but that the Tumult rais*d by\nthe Silverfmiths at Ephefus^ tho' they in particular\nwere touch'd with the fenfe of their Intereft, and\nthe lofs of their Craft and Trade, yet was carry'd\non in the Sincerity of their Ignorance by thofe who\ncaird her the Great Goddefs Diana^ whom they and\nall the World worjhipfds that they who cry'd Great\nw Diana of the Ephejians^ believ'd her to be fo,\nand had not the leaft Notion of their worihipping\nthe Devil\nI doubt not but the Priefts of Jpollo at Belphor^.\nwho waited there to give out the Anfwers to the\nfeveral Enquirers that came with their Gifts to the\nOracle,believ'd that the faid Oracles were iflued by the\nGods, and efpccially by Apollo himfelf5 and little\nthought that they (the Priefts) were Tools of the\nZ)m\/, to cheat and amufe the World, and propa-\ngate Idolatry ; for which the true God, who was\nhighly affronted in the Fraud, would one Day put\nthem all to Silence.\nThus far, I think the Clergy are beholden to me\nvery much, for eftablifliing their Honefty at the\nExpencc of their Heads, and telling you they were\nall Fools, rather than Knaves. At the fame time it\nholds ftill, and this part can never be deny'd, that\nas the Devil carry'd on his Kingdom by the Arc\nMagick, or what we call the Black Jrtj fo the\nPriells were the Inllruments both of the Witchcraft\nand the Idolatry,\nHow far the two Infernal Juggles are dill car-\nried on, and whether the Priefts in moft Parts of\nthe World (our own, God blefs us ! always excepted)\nare not Magicians, and Dealers with the Devil^\neven in their Sacreds, and by the meer Confe-\nquence of their Office j let the Padres and Men of\nthe Tonfurc tell us, and give us Satisfaftion if they\ncan.\nG Wi\n\f,5,4 A S Y S r E M\nWe have now brought the Magicians of Mgypt^\nand the Priefts of the Pagan Teoiples to be fome-\nthing a-kin> atleailvvemay fay, I have brought them\nto be all of a Trade \\ and I believe 'tis not very dif-\nficult to fhovv you, that as they fervM the fame Mailer,\nfo they had their Inftrudtions by the very fame\nChannel, and from the fame Original : In a word,\nthat the Worfhip of the Gods, which was indeed\nthe Worfhip of the Devil^ was diftated in the very\nfame way, namely, by an immediate Correfpon-\ndence with the Devil, and with all the Circumftan-\nces mention'd in the Text before quoted 5 (mz.)\nDivination, Inchantment, Conjuration, Appariti^\non, Vifion, Dream, Familiar Spirits, obferving\nTimes, obferving Seafous, and flying of Birds, En-\n\u2022iniils of Beads, and the like.\nIt may feem a little difficult to bring all the\nSchemes of Idol or Pagan Worfhip down to a\nLevel with Witchcraft and Diabolical Magickj\nand fome will tell us, that feveral Parts of the\nPagan Worfhip, or even Paganifm in general, was\neflabiifh'd upon pure and jult Principles, an exaS:\nand regular Virtue, the height of Ivlorals, prin-\nciples of Truth, and of natural Religion, of good\n\u2022Government, and of Dedication to the publick\nWelfare of Mankind 5 nay even upon Principles of\nPiety, and a Homage to be paid to the Divine Be-\ning, as the firil moving Caufeof Life, and as a Debt\ndue to that Being, for all the good attending Hu-\nman Life 5 that nothing has been wanting in fome\nPagans but a Revelation from Heaven, and an open-\ning the Eyes of the Soul by Divine Infpiration,\nto know the Only True God.\nThofe that are of this Opinion, fupport it by the\nExample of iSIuma Pompilius^ the Founder of the\n-Roman Rites, and to whom the ellablifhing the\ngreater part of the Pagan Ceremonies is juftly af-\nfign'd > who, they tell us, afted upon the higfeefl\nPrinci-\n\fof M A G 1 C K. ipj\nPrinciples of Morality and Virtue, and even of\nPiety; that he went even to the utmoft length\nthat Nature and Reafon could go; that he not only\nacknowledg'd a Supreme Power, to whom Man-\nkind ow'd his Homage for the good receiv'd, and\nwho would not fail, in a Life to come, to diftribute\nRewards and Punilhments, agreeable to the Life\nandCondu6tof every Man here: Butown'dalfo that\nWorihip as a Natural Debt, to be paid by all Man-\nkind 5 hence upon the Door of the Temple of the\nfevei al Gods he caus'd to be written, as a Dire6lion\nto all Mankind, this ihort Precept, a Jove princi--\npium ; intimating that every A6bion of Man's Life\nihould be begun with Application to the Gods.\nThey add, that Numa had a profound fincere Ve-\nneration for the Creator of all things, as the\nAuthor of Life, and the fupreme God of Heaven\nand Earth, and that he wanted nothing to be a\nfincere Worfhipper of the true God, but a true\nRevelation from Heaven, inlightning his Mind, and\nguiding him to know what way of Worihip that\nGod would be pleafed to accept.\nThey give us feveral other Examples of Great\nand lUuftrious Men, who tho' profefs'd Heathens\nin the manner of Worfhip, and the immediate Ob-\njeft, yet form'd their Notions upon juit and noble\nPrinciples, ftriftly adhering to the natural Princi-\nples of Religion, clofely purfuing Juftice in Go-\nvernment, Impartiality in matters of Right, pre-\nferving Virtue and Honour in the People, and ma-\nking wholfom Laws for their better Government,\nupon all Occalions; fuch are Lycurgus the Lacedcemo-\nnian^ Confucius the Chinefe^ Solon the wife Philofo-\npher, and fundry others.\nThey alfo name to us the Books of the Sybils^\nwhich, fo far as they are difcover'd, they fay are\nfiird with fiimmary Rules for well- governing Man-\nkind, and directing a due Homage to the great God,\nO 2, But\n\f^6 A S T S T E M\nBut let US look thro' all this. God for wife\nEnds did not think fit to accept thefe little Ema-\nnations of Natural Light, or to reveal himfelf to\nthe Perfons j however fincere they may be faid to\nbe in the piirfuit of Divine Light j as then they\nwere left to the dim and dusky Shadows of natu-\nral Reafonings only, fo it appeared that thofe natural\nReafoningswere notfufficient to inform the Mind of\nMan concerning God 5 But that when they had\ndone all, for want of farther Illuminations, the Devil\nwas fufFer'd to chop in, and confound all their\nbrightelt Ideas of Worfhip, with a horrid Rhap-\nfody of complicated Idolatry.\nThis very Obfervation is fufficient, or at leafl:\nit might be expc6bed that it fhould be fufficient, to\ncrudi the Notions which our more Polite Gentle-\nmen now advance, in favour of the fludy of Ma-\ngick, as an Art or Science only 5 They con-\ntend that the Word Magick is greatly miftaken,\nand that we do not underftand what wefpeakofj that\nMagick is nothing elfe but a recciv'd well-guided\nway of thinking and ading -, that it is truly the\nScience of Reflexion, and the Art of making a\nright Judgment of things, by giving every Objcd,\nhowever diflant, its due Weight j thinking of things\naccording to the true Rate of them j that the hu-\nmane Judgment is in its felf infallible, and therefore\nin fome manner equal to the divine Being} a Light\niffaed from Heaven, and darted by Emanation into\nthe Souls of Men j which, if rightly cultivated and\nimproved, and efpecially it fincerely follow'd, ad-\nher'd to, and obeyed, guides the Soul to underhand\nthings in a fuperior way 5 This they fay is Magick:\nthe very Word which intimates a laperior and di-\nvine Knowledge, leads to underftand what it\nmeans 5 and this, fay they, duly follow'd, would\nfrom the Beginning have made Men be, as the Ser*\npent told them they fliould be, viz. like Gods,\nknowing Good and Evil. Now\n\fof M A G I C K. ip7\nNow thefc fine-fpun Notions or Imaginations, I\nfay, are fully anfwer'd, by taking Notice, that there\nis apparently no fuch Infallibility in Man's Judg-\nment, unlefs affifted by a yec higher and fuperior\ndegree of Illumination 5 that is to fay, unlefs God,\nthe Author of all perfect and compleat Illumina-\ntion, {hould add to it the Revelation of himfelf,\nand of his Mind and Will, giving the Man Rules\nand Laws for his farther Illumination, and for\nthe Diredion of himfelf.\nThis appears in the Particular mentioned above,\nnamely, that notwithftanding Man's infallible Judg-\nment led him to the Knowledge of a Divine Be-\ning, and that there was a great firft Caufe, Infi-\nnite, Eternal and Superior, becaufe Prior to all Be-\ning, and that this firit Being had a Right to the\nHomage and Obedience of his Creatures 5 yet 'till\nGod by Revelation directed it, all the Perfedion\nof human Judgment could never lead Mankind to a\nright Knowledge of the Worfhip and Homage\nthis Great Being requir'd. But they funk down in-\nto Idolatry, worfhipping many Gods, and Images,\nthe Reprefentations of Gods 3 and in a word, into\nthe groiTefl and duUeft Conceptions of things re-\nlating to their Deities, fuch as one would think it was\nimpoffible humane Judgment, under any manner of\nImprovement, could fall intoj things unworthy of\nGoD, nay unworthy of Men. Hence they made\ntheir Jupiter^ the' they call'd him the Father of\nGods and Men, a horrid Pifture of ungovern'd Luft,\na Ravager of the World, ravifhing Innocence and\nVirtue, transforming himfelf into divers Shapes, to\nobtain his vicious Defircsj as into a white Bull, to\ncarry away Europa -, into a golden Shower, to fall\ninto the Lap of Dam^^ and the like. Here is the\nPidure of infallible humane Judgment ! Wonder no\nmore that at laft it carry'd them all headlong into\nthe Arms of the Devil^ and not only to be ignorant\nO 3\nof\n\f15)8 A S T S r E M\nof the Worfliip of the true God, but to pay the\nHomage they ow'd to their Maker, to him who\nwas their Deflroyer and Enemy.\nThus Numa^ with all his Sincerity and Piety, re*\nIblv'd all his Ideas into a confus'd Mafs of idola-\ntrous Ceremonies, adorning the Priefts, forming\nnew Orders and Degrees of his Clergy 5 and, in a\nword, drawing a Scheme of pompous Paganifm^\neftablilhing Games, and inhumane Fightings of\nGladiators, Races and Exercifes for Sport, in Ho-\nnour of the Gods : Befidcs crowding the City with\nTemples and Altars, to innumerable and unknown\nDeities 3 fo that, in a word, after he had acknowledg'd\nthat there was a fupreme Power, a God of all the\nEarth, a great firft Caufe of Life, and to whom all\nHomage was due, I fay, after all thefe fublime\nIdeas, he yet funk down into the grofleit of all Ido-\nlatries, the worshipping imaginary Gods, deifying\nthe Stars of Heaven, and offering Sacrifices, build-\ning Temples, dedicating Priefts, and making Vows\nto Stocks and Stones, the Work of their own\nFingers, and the Idols of their own Brain.\nWill any one think we wrong the Pagan Inftitu-\ntions, much lefs the Inftitutors, to fay, that the\nT>eml had a Finger in all this? does not Satan in\nPolicy fufFer an Appearance of Virtue and Piety\nto be fet up, to mock the World into true Devil-\nworfliip? How could he fet himfelf up to be\nworfhip'd as a God^ and how could he make himfelf\ntruly \\\\\\tQod of this World, if he did not enjoin to\nhis Worshippers, at leaft feemingly, fome Forms of\nLife, and appearing Principles, agreeable to the\nRules of Virtue and Honour ? 'Tis by this that in\ngeneral he has carry'don the Delufion, and this, as I\nmay fay, has been the Magick of his Art, as well\nas the Art of his Magick.\nThe Romans were the moft civiliz'd Heathens\nthat the World ever faw j their Government had\nin\n\fof M A G 1 C K.\nm it all the Appearance of Juftice and Moderation}\nthey honour'd and rewarded Virtue and Honour,\nLove to our Country, Courage, Gallantry : How\ndid they crown thofe that fav'd a Citizen, give\nTriumphs to thofe that had conquered their Ene-\nmies, give Prizes to thofe who excell'd in the moft\ncommendable Things? How did they honour Cha-\nflity in their Veftal Virgins 5 Temperance, Elo-\nquence, Learning and Philofophy in the Perfons of\nthofe that excelled, and ered Statues to their Me-\nmory when dead ?\nYet all this while their Religion was Devil-wor-\nfhip } their Augurs and Southfayers, and the Priefts\nof their Temples and Oracles, were Diviners, Ma-\ngicians^ Wizards, and in the very Letter of it Deal-\ners with the Devil^ and that in the worffc Senfey all\ntheir Sacrifices, and their Inftitution of Games, for\nappealing the angry Gods, were the molt horrid\nand barbarous Pieces of Ignorance, or heliilh Cru-\nelty and Brutality, that could be imagined, even\nfometimes to human Sacrifices) and in all thofe ex-\ncefTes of their Devotion, the Devil led them on\nblinded by flrong Delufions to fuch Performances,\nin order to appeafe the Wrath of Heaven, as were\nunworthy of God, inconliiknt with his Nature, as\na bountiful beneficent Being, as a fountain of Good-\nnefs and Mercy, infinitely CompaiTionate to his\nCreatures j and who could not take Pleafure in\nthofe things which were injurious to Mankind,\nin order to be reconcird to them, or be pacify'd\nby dcflroying thofe, whom it was his glory to fave\nand prote6b.\nAll the while that they erefled Temples to Ju-\nftice, to Honour, to Virtue, and to Peace, they\nftudicd ail poflible ways, by War, and Blood, to a-\nmafs Treafures, and enlarge their Empire, 'till,\nas the Roman Hillories confefs, they left no Na-\ntion unfubdued, except fuch as they found it not in\nO 4 their\n\ftoo A SYSTEM\ntheir Power, or worth their while to Conquer j\nthat is to fay, fuch as the Parthians^ who were too\npowerful for them to conquer, and fo poor when\n'\nconquer'd, as not to be worth the Attempt 5 or the\nIndians and jEthiopians^ who tho' rich, yet were fo\nremote and fenc'd by wide unpayable Defarts, an4\nprote6bed by the excefSve Heat of the Climate, fo\nthat it was not in their Power to aflault them.\nTheir Armies were not able to endure the March\nthro' the Libyan Sands, or over the Mountains and\nyaft Waters of India^ under or near the EquinoXj^\nand where there was nothing to fhelter or relieve\nthem under the exceffive and violent Force of the\nSun.\nAll the reft of the World, as I have faid, they\nfcontinually invaded and fubdued, and matter'd not\nthe Reafon and Juftice of the War, if the Reward\nof their Treafures, and the Advantage of Govern-\ning them, was apparent.\nThus Cafar invaded the Gai^ls^ the Helvetians^\nthe Germans^ without any juft Pretence of making\nWar, except only that of Conqueft, Plunder and\nDominion. What Pretence of War had the Romans\nagainft a quiet, a remote, an inofFenfive Nation, as\nthe Britains certainly were? They neither ofFer'd\nto difturb the Roman Government, or were in\nCondition to do it 3 having no Knowledge of Arms\nequal to any fuch Attempt, no Alliances or Cor-\nrefpondence with any of the Romans Enemies, no\nShips to traverfe the Ocean, and make them ter-\nrible.\nNothing caird Cafar over hither to invade the\ninnocent Britains^ but thirft of Glory, and enlarg-\ning Dominion y a Principle imbib'd from the\ntyrannick Nature of the Devil y to raife humane\nGlory, not by Deeds truly Great, not by virtuous\nA6lions, but by defiroying and infulting the Weak\nin Prefumption of Strength, and by ihedding\nBlood\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 101\nBlood to triumph over the Wrongs and Opprcf-\n^on of their Fellow-Creatures.\nAnd what was the Reward of C^far's Ambition\nand Third; of Glory ? A Conqueft indeed he gain'd 5\nbut of what, and for whom ? a Conqueft of Inno-\ncence, and a Conqueft for the Devil 5 the fruit of\nwhich was thus to be fumm'd up: They, firfl and\nlaft, deftroyed two Millions, fome think five or fix\nMillions, of the Inhabitants 5 they fpilt alfo an Ocean\nRoman Blood 5 eighty thoufand Romans were killed\nat one time by the gallant Queen Boadicia at Ca-\nmolodinum^ now Maiden in EJfex 5 and after a Pof-\nfeifion of above fix hundred Years, they were forc'd\nto abandon it with Infamy and Scandal, and fo end-\ned jull where they began.\nWhence was all this, but from the Devil? whofd'\nGovernment of the World had this Magick in-\ndeed always in it, that it fpread Cruelty and Ty-\nranny in all Parts, founded Dominion in Blood, and\nmade the World a Theatre of Rapin and Vio-\nlence.\nThis was the fecret Magick of his Government,\nand yet this was always carried on under the Mask\nof Juftice, Peace and Religion; that is to fay, Ava-\nrice was Juftice, and to gain the Plunder of a Na-\ntion was a fufficient Pretence to quarrel with and\nfubdue it: Conqueft then brought Peace j that is to\nfay, when Rapin or Slaughter had impoverifh'd or\nextirpated a People, then the Romans gave them\nPeace, and protected the Remnant j and as to Reli-\ngion, the Subftance of it was, as above, Cruelty\nand Superftition.\nThis is the Sum of the Roman Polity^ and of the\nMethods taken in a Government and by a People\nwho, as above, are faid to be the moft civilized of\nall the Pagan Nations and Governments in the\n.World 'y and this, in a word, ferves to open the\nEyes of Pofterity, and betrays the Devil's Confpi-\nracy\n\f201 A s^ r s r E M\nracy againfl Mankind in the openeft manner poP-\nfible. The Magick of Hell difcovers it felf here,\nthat under the fpecious Pretence of juft Govern-\nment, and under the Fame of a civiliz'd Nation,\ngoverning themfelves and the World by the Rules\nof Jullice and Virtue, a Loofe was given to all man-\nder of Barbarifms, Cruelty, Blood and Oppreflion.\nIt is clear in fo many Examples, that 1 need fay\nno more to explain it, that the Roman Govern-\nment and the Roman Religion was all founded on\na Diabolical Regimen, and was maintained by the\nMagick and Artifice of the Devil and his Iniiru-\nmenrs } which Inftruments were chiefly the Priefts\nof the Idol Temples and Worfhip, who by the\nSubtilty of their Arts (Religious Art, the worft\nfort of Magick) made fuch deep Impreflions on the\nMinds of the deluded World, that not the com-\nmon fort only, not the Vulgar, or as we fay the\nCanaikj the Mobb and Rabble of the People came\ninto it, and believed the lying Wonders 5 but the\nlearned World, the Philofophers, the Poets, Men of\nthe moft exquifite Parts, and the mod polite Know-\nledge, nay ofthe nobleft Principles of Virtue, and who\nhad the moft refined Ideas of Juftice and Honour,\neven thefe all came into the Delufions of this Black.\ny\/r\/, believed, and, as I may fay, relifhed the Witch-\ncraft and Delufions of the Magicians and Sorcerers,\nand were taken with their lying Wonders j even the\nCato'Sy the ^ullfs^ the great and the greateft He-\nroes, Philofophers, Scholars, 'twas all one, they were\nfwallowed up by the Arts of the Magicians and\nSouthfayers j nay, their Kings ftooped to deal in\nthis Black Art themfelves. Romulus the Founder\nof the City of Rome^ and the firft Father even of\nthe Roman Name, was himfelf a Southfayerj that\nis to fay, a Magician, a Diviner or Inchanter> in plain\nEnglijh a Dealer with the Devil, and the great Pro-\npagator of the infernal Arc 5 I fay, the great Pro-\npagator\n\fof M A G I C K io3\npagator of ir, for he was the firft that inftituted the\nAugurs in the Pagan Worihip, and, as I faid, Hook'd\nin the Magicians into their Religion, making all\nthe Wizards and Conjurers, Priefts j tho' I muft\ninfift upon it, not Romulus^ Numa^ or the Devil\nhimfelf , could make all the Prieits Conjurers, no\nnot to this Day.\nSome have been of Opinion that Nmna Pompilius^\nwho I have faid was fincerely inclin'd to Religion,\nas it was fimply underllood to be a meer Homage\ndue from Man a Creature, to God the Creator 3 that\nhe afted from a fincere Principle, and that he went\nfarther towards eftablifhing the true Religion, than\nany Pagan in the World ever did before him.\nBut they add, he was loft for want of revealed\nLight : that having determined by the Light\nof his Reafon that there was a God, and that he\nwas to be worfhipped, but not knowing how or\nin what manner that Worfhip was to be direded,\nand not being able to find out by his utmoft Search\nwhat Worfhip would be acceptable. He funk into\nIdolatry and Polythcifm, as the only Pattern that\nwas before him j with this Addition, that having\nthus taken his Rife from a wrong Beginning, his\ndevout Temper hurried him on into all the Ex-\ntremes of Idolatry and Paganifm, 'till at length he\ncame into this very Mifchief I am fpeaking of, I\nmean, Magick, Sorcery, and dealing with familiar\nSpirits, that is, the Devil.\nThis is juft what I had faid already; but it is\nmoft certain, that though at firft they aftcd up-\non feme Foundation of natural Principles, or if\nyou pleafc. Principles of Natural Religion : Yet\nthey afterwards run farther into this Sorcery and\nSouthfaying, and that with fuch an univerfal\nGuft of Inclination, that it became a chief Part of\ntheir Religion; and there were very few of their\ng^reat Men, nay even of their Kings and Empe-\nrors,\nr\n\f104 A S T S r E M\nrors, but what were Magicians themfelvcs 5 and\nforae of them, if not all of them, took it for a\nPart of their Imperial Titles, and a Badge of their\nHonour, to be called Pontifex Maximus^ and fome-\ntimes appeared in the Robes of a Sacrificer, and of\nthis or that Order of the Priefts, as they thought\nfitj 'till at length unfufFerable Pride and Infolcnce\nled them to accept of divine Honours themfelvcs, to\nlay afide the Prieft, and affumc that of a God \\ placing\nthemielves fo above the Sacrificer, as tofuffer them^\nfelves to be facrificed to : But this went but a little\nWay.\nAt length the Chriftian Religion, in fpite of\nPerfecution and obftinate Reliltance, both from the\nJews as well as the Pagans, began ro fpread it felf\nin the World : and as Chrift himlelf fays, that he\ncame to deftroy the Works of the Devil^ fo it ap-\npeared> for immediately the Glories of the Pagan Su-\nperilition began to fade, their Oracles ceaj)'d, the\nPriefts became dumb 5 and the Z)^i;\/7, not able to car-\nry on the Cheat any farther, threw it up ; the Au-\ngurs and Southfayersfled from the Face of the Chri-\nitian Doftrine, and from the Preaching of the A-\npoftles and their Succeflbrs, as not able to exercife\ntheir Sorceries and Divinations, no not fo much as\nin the Prefence of the Chriftian Minifters.\nWe have two remarkable Inflances of this in the\nfacred Text 5 one is jlcis xiii. 7. when being at\nthe Ille of Cyprus^ Elymas the Sorcerer ventured\nto withftand St. Pauly when he preached the\nWord of God to Sergius Paulus the Governourj\nbut for the audacious Attempt was ftruek blind\nby the miraculous Word of the bleflcd Apoftlc, fo\nbeing madeanlnltrument to confirm theGovernour\nin his Faith, and compleat the Converfion which\nthe conjuring Wretch fought to oppofe, 'ver. 12.\n^he Deputy^ when he faw what was done^ belkvedy\nkeing aftonijhed at the boUrine of the LORD.\n\fof M A G 1 C K.\nThe other Inftance is in AEls xix. ip. where indeed\nthere is a double Evidence j Firft^ of the Power of\nthe Chriftian Do\u00a3trine prevailing over the Magick\nand Diabolick Arts then in Pra6tice ; and, Secondlyj\nof the prodigious Encreafe of thofc Magical Delu-\nJfions among the Romans^ however wife and polite\na People they were; the Story is fhort, and fully to\nthe purpofe. St. Paul^ preaching at EphefuSy made\na wonderful Progrefs in converting the Pagans of\nthat great City, to the Chriftian Faith. Some Hi-\nflories tell us, he converted one hundred thoufand\nPeople there and in the Country adjacent j but\nthat by the way: In a word, the Text fays, 'i^^r. 17.\nthe Name of the Lord Jefus was magnify'd. And how,\nbut by this eminent Vi6lory over the Devil? For\n(bcfides the Conqueft of the Exorcifts who went a-\nbout to caft out a Devil by their Conjunngs and\nSpells) the Magicians themfelves were converted by\nPaul's preaching, and that to a prodigious Number\nof them, ver, ip. Many alfo of them which ufed cu^\nrious Arts^ brought their Books together^ and burned\nthem before all Men : and they counted the Price of\nthem^ and found it fifty thoufand Pieces of Silver,\nWhat a height muft the Black Art of the Devil be\ncome to at that time, that the Books which were\nto be found in that one City iliould amount to fuch\na Sum of Money ? I give this Account, as I have\nfaid, to let you fee to what an extravagant height\nthe Devil had carried this Matter j and how and\nin what manner he fupported his Interefl: in the\nWorld. But I mufl: go back to the Beginning of\nthings, where I lefc off, viz. at the Infticution of\nthe Jugursy who were for forae Ages the Engroflers\nof all thefe Delufions in the Roinan Empire.\nThe Augurs were a fort of Roman Priefts, who\npretended to foretell Events by Omens, by the\nchattering of Birds, howling of Dogs, and other\nuncouth Noifcs of any kind \\\\\\ the Air: They were\ncrcfted\n20J\n\f20C, A S Y S T E M\nerefted into a Society, and formed in a College or\nHall by the King's fpecial Order j the Number at\nfirft was but three, one being taken from every\nRoman Tribe 5 and while they were thus few, the\nDignity was very valuable, and it was highly\nefteemed among even the PatricH and Nobility.\nServius Tullius encrcas'd their Number to Four, and\ncaufed them to be taken only from the Nobility :\nAfterwards ^intus and C<eneus Agellims obtained\nthat Five more ihould be added to their Number^\nand fliould be chofen out of the Pleheii or Common\nPeople. So ambitious were the Romans of this\nDiabolical Preferment, and fo much Honour had\nthe Devil's immediate Servants in the World j nay,\nupon this Increafe of their Number to Nine, the\nGovernment was fo refolute againft lowering the\nPrice of that Reverence and Efteem they had\namong the People, that they pafled a Decree a-\ngainft encreafing their Number any more.\nHowever Sylla^ one of the moft bloody and\ncruel Tyrants of his Time, that he might, accord-\ning to Cuftom, join his Care of Religion to his\nThird: of Blood, added fix more > fo that now their\nNumber was fifteen. The cldeft, whether in Years\nof longeft {landing in Order, (I am not pofitive\nwhich) was made Father or Prefident of the College,\nand had the immediate Direftion of all the reft.\nTheir Privileges, like their Inftitution, were ex-\norbitant J for they were never to be depofed or ex-\npelled, no not for any Crime how great foever,\nnor their Places filled up by another.\nN. B. Crime did not render the Devil's Agents\nfcandalous in their Profeflion, but rather the\nwickeder they were, the fitter for the Prieft-\nhood or Augurate. How far the fame Max-\nim may hold in fone of the facred Order in\nthe World at this time, if I was of their\nNumber, I ihould not vote to have it examined.\nAnd\n\fof MAGIC K. 107\nAnd now for the Ceremonies of the Angurs\nTrade J for we muft note, that the Art Magick\nbad always abundance of dark and uncouth Uftges\nattending it, as it has to this Day, raiiing the\nDe^il was not done with a Whiftle, \"like calling a\nDog 5 or with a Beck of the Head or Hand, as we\nbeckon to Servants when we call them filcntly\nto come near us j the Dez^il knew very well that\nhis Affair muft be clothed with Ceremony, or it\nwould not take with the World, or at leaft would\nnot hold long in it.\nThe Pagan Rites were indeed loaded with Bur-\nthcnfome Ceremonies 5 all the DeviPs Worfhipwas\nfilled with Conjurin^s and Mutterings, ftrange Ge-\nflures, Agitations, Ecftafies, and I know not how\nmany Diftortings of the Limbs and Countenances,\nwild Pradices and frightful Noifes, that filled tbci\nPeople with Terror, and with a kind of awful\nHorrour at the Majefty of their Gods.\nThe j^ugurs Obfervations were attended with a\ngreat Variety of thofe things, as the apparatus to\nxheir Vifions, or whatever elfe they were to be\n.called. The Augur firft placed himfelf upon a high\nTower like one of our Obfervatories, and perhaps\nthe Tower ereded upon a high Hill, as upon the\nMons Palatinus in Rome: Here he feated himfelf in\nthe cleareft Day, or in a Star-light Night, to ob-\nferve what came by him, or in his Sight, by Day,\nor what he might hear or fee by Night.\nHe held in his Hand a Lituus^ that is, a crooked\nStaff, with which he ufed a great many wild Ge-\nllurcs and Motions 5 and he had on, his grave Leena^\n'that is, his Southfaying Gown or Mantle : He\nplaced himfelf always with his Face to the Eaft,\nand at his firft fixing his Station he utter'd cer-\ntain Sentences and exotic barbarous Words, which\nnone knew the Meaning of but the Be^vil and\nhimfelf.\nBeing\n\f2o8 A SYSTEM\nBeing thus featcd and fix'd, as I have faid, he\nquarters out the Heavens, or Hemifphcre rather, into\nfour Parts or Regions, each Quarter having before-\nhand fuch and fuch Predidions affign'd to it : If it\nwas Day, then he was to mark every Bird that rofe\nup, or eame flying by, or towards him ; which of\nthe faid four Quarters he firft appear'd in, and thert\nkilling his Sacrifices, and muttering over cer-\ntain Sentences, joyning fome petitionary Speeches\nto fuch or fuch a Deity, or Daemon rather, (which\nSpeeches were call'd Effata) he then proceeded to\nDivination.\nIf it was in the Night, he obferv'd in the like\nmanner any fiery Meteor, any flying or fliooting\nFires, any fudden Vapour, (as the Nights are full of\nfuch things,) or any Cloud eclipfing the Light\nof any particular Planet or Star of the firft Magni-\ntude 5 and then he proceeded in the fame manner,\nonly with fome particular Words and Mutterings^\nas regarded the feveral Appearances refpeftively.\nIn the Night, it was faid, they had the Company\nof feveral Spirits affifting them, and communica-\nting to them the Knowledge of the Things theyde-\niir'd. Their Divinations were arbitrary and pofi-\ntive, nor durft any Man ask or enquire of them thfe\nReafon of what they predicted, or how they came\nto know that it would or ftieuld be fo and fo. A\nProvifion, Imuft confcfs, very prudent in the Priefts,\nand which, as the cafe has ftood with fome of\nthem, would be very much to their Convenience\nto this Day, as I fhall fhow in its Place.\nBy this taking fuch a kind of State upon thenif,\nthey politickly preferv'd the Reverence and Efteerii\nof their Order, and imprinted a kind of Awe in the\nMinds of the People, concerning not the Holinefs\nof their Perfons only, (tho' that went a great way,)\nbut concerning the divine Myfteries, as they were\ncaird, which were put into their Hands > and they\nwere\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 40^\n^^c^e look'd upon as Perfons to whom the Gods\nhad commicted the moft fecrct Things than were\notherwife known only to themfelves, and were com-\nmunicated to the Augurs^ Favourites of the God5,\nfor the good of Mankind.\nA Learned Author, fpeaking of this Myftery of\nSouthfaying, fays, it came firft from the Chaldeans^\nwho taught it to the Greeksy of whom Amphiaraus\nwas an eminent Proficient ; but he mentions no-\nthing of who taught it the Chaldeans^ in which I\nbelieve my Account is the mofl authentick j name*\n]y, that the Devil taught it to the Arab I have\nmcntion'd, or to fome other^ if any was before\nhim; that thefe gave it to iht jEgyptians^ and Cbal\"\ndeans^ and Phoenicians^ much about the fame timejj\nand that the Phoenicians taught it the Greeks ^ their\nPrince Cadmus being an eminent Southfayer: and\nfo you fee its blefled Original.\n. In a word, as it is a particular Familiarity with\nthe D'evil^ and depends entirely upon his Afliftance^\nfo no body can contend that he was not the firft\nIntroducer of it as an Art; fince, as I obferved, he\nmight eafily begin a Correfpondence with Manj\nbut it was utteiTy impoffible that Men fiiould be-\ngin a Correfpondence with him; or know where to\nfind him, and how to call him to their Afliftahce^\nwhatever the Occafion might be, without his Di^\nreftion, Affiftance, and Confent. \\\nAs to the Introducing it from one Nation to a-\nnother^ it may indeed be fomething difficult to afiigii\nthe manner; But as to the meer divining upon th^\nflying of Birds, upon Noifes, and Appearances\nin the .Air, the Chattering of Pyes, the, Croak-\ning of Frogs and Ravens, and the like, I take rilucH\npf that to be meer Juggle and Legerdemain of the\nPriefts and. Augurs; and they have carry'd on the\ni\"ggl^\"g Trade to a great PerfeSign in the farn^\nP Coiificry\n\f2IO A s r s r E M\nCountry to this Day j [jiand clear Dominicans:)\nof which hereafter.\nBut now for a downright Converfe with the De-\nyil^ I don't underiland that Satan ever ty'd himfelf\ndown by Articles, that not only fuch and fuch a\n\"\nMan as my Arah^ or Alt Albrahazen^ of whom I\nhave fpoken, fhould be able to call him up when\nthey pleas'd, by fuch and fuch Forms, Ceremonies,\nVoices and Sounds 5 but that to whomfoever they\nfhould communicate the fame Tokens, or Watch-\nwords, they fhould have the fame Power, and that\nthe very Words fhould call him or his Agents up\nto an Appearance, whoever made ufe of them.\nThis would have been to have the Devil bind\nhimfelf Prentice to them and their Heirs for ever j\nand to have chained himfelf down, Gallyflave like,\nto the found of the Words, which I take to be quite\n\"wide of the Cafe 3 nor would it ferve his Defigns,\nfor the Devil loves to know his Agents, and not be\nat the call of every Boy, becaufe perhaps his Grand-\nmother told him the Words which fhe ufed to raife\nthe Devil with, or becaufe the Devil and ihe had a-\ngreed upon the Matter. But no doubt Satan, who\nis certainly the Author of all this kind of Magick,\nand which therefore and for that very Reafon is\ncall'd by his Name, Diabolick 5 I fay, no doubt,\nas he is the only Teacher of the Art, fo he\nreaches it immediately by himfelf} that is, he makes\nMen Magicians^ and Wizards, and makes old Wo-\nmen Witches (ay and young too) by an immediate\nConverfe andContra61: with them only, and between\nthem and himfelf Nor does he ilick at the Pains\nof beginning a-new with every Perfon, and in e-\nvery Country j and this is the Reafon why the\nBlack Art, as we righteoufly entitle it, is not the\nfame in all Countries, nor is the Devil talk'd to in\nthe fame Words, for then all the Witches and Ma-\ngicians\n\fvf M A G I C K. ill\ngtclans of every Nation muft learn the fame Lan-\nguage; but on the contrary, as the Devil talks all\nLanguages when he pleafes, fo he talks to every\none of his Difciples in their own Mother Tongue,\nand directs them to do the fame to himj fo that a\nRoman Wizard calls him up in Latin ; a Tufcan\nConjurer in Italian 'y a High German Doftor makes\nhis Circles, and calls his Figures, and talks Ma-\ngick to him in the fuitable Tongue call'd High\nDutch 'j the fecond-fighted Highlander in \/rj, and\nthe Lancajhire Lady in Englijh.\nSo propitious, fo civil, fo well-manner'd is Satan\nto all his Drudges and Devotees, that he, to put\nthem to as little trouble as poflible, floops to hear-\nken to their Summons, as they think fit to exprefs\nthemfelves in their own, or any Language. Nay,\ntho' the Magicians fometimes form a Cant of their\nown, by which they amufe their Clients, yet their\nfamiliar Friend takes it in good part, and on-\nverfes with them in their own way.\nEven the poor Indians^ Pawaw with him in the\nLanguage of the mod Northern America^ the Ba-*\nmans in the Language ofthe Eaft Indiatis^ the IJlanders\nof Amhoyna in the Language of the Celebes and Mo^\nluccos^ and the Chinefi in that of Grand tartary.\nThe Magicians feem to a6t in this Part, as if the\nJDm\/ condefcended to them, not they to him; but\nthen this makes it evident, that he converfes Per-\nfonally with them all, that he makes his Bar-\ngains and Agreements with them always feparately, \u2022\nin all Places, and in all Languages; whereas,\nif he gave them a general Commiilion to empower\nothers to divine, inchant, and raife the Devil^ or\nevil Spirits, they muft all underftand one univcrfal\nLanguage.\nThe fum of the Matter is this-, the Z)m\/, as a\nLearned Author fays, has three ways by which he\ncarries on his Kingdom in the World, and by\nPi which\n\f^l^ A S Y S T E M\n^vhich he works all his Wonders, which amufe\nand deceive them.\n1. By moving the AfFedtions and Thoughts of\nMen, whether lleeping or waking 5 and this, as it\nrefpeds his caufing them to dream on any Occafion\nas he thinks fit, is one very coniiderable Branch of\nhis Power.\n2. By his exquifitc Knowledge of Nature, by\nwhich he turns the Caufes of things to his own\nPurpofes, and often brings to pafs fuch Events as fuic\nwith his particular Occafions.\n3. By Illufion and Fraud, impofing upon the\nSenfcs, binding and blinding the Underlhnding and\nthe Eyes, both of the Body and of the Minds of\nwillingly-deceiv'd Men.\nN, B. And I may add a fourth, which perhaps\nhe was not acquainted with in former times j\nnamely, by familiar Agreement, Compact and\nContrad with the Bright Men of the Times,\nwho he brings over to converfe and corre-\nfpond with him, and who he ads by, and\nallows them to play their Game and his own\ntogether > and this is Magick.\nHaving then cftablifli'd a Correfpondence with\nMan, we are not to wonder if, to gratify his new\nCorrefpondents, he empowers them to ad abun-\ndance of flrange and unaccountable things in the\nWorld, that they may by that means obtain a Re-\nputation of being wifer and craftier than their\nNeighbours, and may alfo be admir*d and efteem'd\nfirfb, and confequently believ'd.\nThefe Wonders they work by his immediate\nHand, by his Power and Affiftance, as well as Di-\nredion j and this I call Magick^ and it is fo in the\nword Senfe.\nTo this he fubjoins a Power, as it may be call'd,\nover himfelfj authorizing the Magicians or Con-\njurera\n\fof M A G I C K. i.^l\njurers to fummon him in to their Aid whenever\nthey have Occafion for him, to demand his Pre-\nfence and Alliftance whenever they pleafe. Ic was\nfaid of Hamed an Mgyptian Sorcerer, that he had\nthe Devil fo at his Command, that if he did but\ndraw a Circle upon the Ground, and (lamp with\nhis Foot in the middle of it, the Devil would ap-\npear, and bring as many Devils with him, as the\nMagician ftampt feveral times on the Ground 5 and\nthat upon their fo appearing, he could again fend themi\nof fuch Errands, and for the Difpatch of fuch Bu-\niSnefs as he required > whether to do good or evil,\nto bring on Mifchief, or to prevent Mifchief, as\nhe that fo caird him up pleas'd to direftj but I do\nhot vouch the Truth of ihc DeviPs Complaifance\nin this Particular, nor fee the Reafon of it.\nIf the Magicians in thofe ancient Days had fuch\nInfluence upon him, 'tis undoubtedly true that they\ndid him great and fignal Services, for, and by it>\nor elfe Satan, who does not ufe to difpence his Fa-\nvours gratis^ muft have fome fecret View in ir,\nwhich they or we have not yet difcovcr'd.\nThis great Ufe which the Devil m^kts of Magicians\nand Conjurers, is a certain Difcovery that he is con-\nfin'd by a fuperior Hand in his Workings, and thac\nhe can only ad by Stratagem, by Cunning, and Crafr,\nnot by Force and Power.\nIt is reported of a Sorcerer in Romoy that he\ncould call for Lightning and Thunder whenever\nJie pleafed, and that the Devil would produce ic\nfor himj but that calling him up once to procure\nThunder, that (hould burn a Houfe, and do great\nMifchief, to gratifie the wicked Dcfign of the\nConjurer 5 he told him No, he could not gratifie his;\nRevenge fo far, at lead: not at that time 5 and thac\nthe fame Sorcerer did at lall confefs, that the Spirit\n^hich he convers'd with, could {how his Pqwer\nP J\nmany\n\fii4 A S Y S r E M\nmany ways in a miraculous manner, but could not\ndo any Mifchief by it.\nIt may be true, and no doubt is fo, that the Ma^\ngicians^ were they fully empowered, and at Liberty,\nwould really do more Mifchief than the Devil him-\nfelf, had he the fame Power j not that their Malice\ncan be greater, but their Policy is certainly lefs^\nand as they do not fee fo far before them as he docs,\nfo they do not always fee into the Reafon of things,\nand whether it would be for the common Intereft\nor no: for Example j were the Devil empovver'd\nto fire Houfes, deflroy Families, lay wafte King-\ndoms, he might encline to do itj but his Pru-\ndentials and Politicks might fometimes tell him,\nthat it would be more for his Intereft to let it a-\nlone 3 and fo the Magicians likewife find it, I fay, for\ntheir common Intereft, to a6t by Craft and Subtilty\nas their Mafler the Devil has done before them,\nrather than by open Rage and Fury- I mean for\ntheir common Intereft as Mr?^\/a^\u00abj.

And this is that we call the Black\nArt, and fo I am come back to my Text.\nIf it be true that the Devil is the Prince of the\nAir, then he can form Tempefts in ir, can poifon\nand infe\u00a3t it fo, as that all Creatures, Humane as\nwell as fenfitive and vegetable, fhoiild perifh in it\n;\nBut as he is yet a Prince under Limitations and Re*\nftriftions, fo he can exert no more Power than he\nhasj and when his humane Agents, who are there-\nin worfe Devils than himfelf, would be for Con-\nflagrations, and general Deftrudlion > He wifely, or\nrather cunningly, puts them off, and diverts them,\nwithout telling them, or giving them room to\nP 4 thinkj\n\ftij '\nA S Y S T E\nthink, that he really has not Power himfelf to cn^\nable them.\nIt is impofUble to clofe this Article of the Magi-\ncians Power being limited, without an agree-\nable Reflexion upon the modern Furies of our\nAge, your Party Leaders, and Politick Scheme-\nJMakersj what merry work they would make in the\nWorld, if the Devil^ their Head Engineer, was not\nlimited, and not in Condition to truft them with\nthe Power of doing Mifchief as they defire it.\nPerhaps the Scnlb of this Limitation in the Pow-\ner of iheir chief Correfpondcnt is one Reafon, that\nhowever fludious they are to do Mifchief, yet they\nhave not fo much ftudied the Diabolical Art as they\nwould otherwife have done 5 in a word, they arc\nnot com pleat Magicians^ becaufe they fee the Black\nArt is not wicked enough for them, and they can-\npot obtam a Power by it to out-fin the Devils\nBut I comeback to the Art it felf The Artifts are\ncertainly very helpfpl to the Devil^ as well as the\nJDevil to them: For as he is obliged to work by\nStratagem, not by Force, all his Cunning is em-\nploy'd to carry on his Kingdom and Government\nin the Worlds and this brings me to the Reafon\nwhy the Devil does not care to a6t in Perfon, in\njnoil: cafes of his Adminiftration ^ but to employ\nthofe People, whom we call Magicians^ that they\nmay a\u00a3b with his full Dire6lions, and tho' with\nArt, yet with Power alfo fufficjent lb ftand bis\nGround againil: all humane Oppofition.\nUnder the Cover of thefe Agents he afts with\ninfinite Succef?, by their Influence he carries on\nall his Affairs, and efpecially thofe of Kingdom\nand Dominion, in which it is not for want of Im-\npudence if he does not rival or indeed dethrone\nhis Maker. By his fecret Correfpondence with\nthem it is that he fills the World with fham Won-\n4crS;, and falfe Stories, which being detefted and\n'\n' expoipd^\n\fof M A G I C K. \\x7\ncxpofed, reflects upon the Magicians^ not upon the\ni)^z;\/7} neither indeed ought it to afFe6t him, for that\nit is not for want of his Affiftance if any of them\nmifcarry, but from their expeding more from him\nthan it is fit he fhould grant, or than perhaps it is\nin his Power to grant. No wonder then he is fo\nofKcious, and fo willing, that he runs and goes,\nand dances Attendance upon a fet of ignorant Ma--\nglciam-, I fay ignorant, except only as he inftrufe\nthem J 'tis evidently, becaufe he makes his Advan-\ntage of them, and they aft for his Account..\n*Tis then apparent, that the Magicians are\nInftruments by which the Devil carries on his Po-\nlitick Affairs in the World. It is time then, in the\nnext Place, to enquire in what manner they per-\nform it, and from what Principles they adj and\nthen we fhall come to fome Hiftorical Account of\ntheir merry Proceedings in the World.\nA\n\fSystem <?\/^ Magick,\nPART 11.\nINTRODUCTION,\nOf the Black Art it felf ; what it really isj\nwhy there are feveral differing TPraBices\nof it in the^ feveral ^arts of the Worlds\nand what thofe Tra\u00a3iices are ; as alfb^\nwhat is contained in it in General,\n^'Have all along, till now, fpoken of the\ngeneral Correfpondence of the Devil\nwith Mankind, under the Head of\nDiaholick Magick^ as a meer Intimacy\n\u20145 only 'j I have reprefented it as a Method\nwhich the Devil firft took, to form his Intereft and\nAcquaintance with Mankind, when he was drown'd\ncut of his Kingdom in the old World by the\nFlood.\n'Ti3\n\fof M A G I C K. 11^\n'Tis too certain that the DevH afted by this Me-\nthod at firft, for the Propagation of his own De-\nfigns only, and to fet on foot a new Adminiflrati*\non of his Affairs 5 it being for many Reafons not\nhis Bufinefs tb a6t openly and barefacedly in the\nWorld as a Devil 5 but now 'tis alfo as apparent,\nthat, after the Devil had thus eflabliihed a Corre^\nfpondencc, he foon found Man as forward as him-\nfelf, as willing to embark with him and engage,\nas he could defire 5 nay fo forward in the new\nTrade, fo eager for Mifchief, fo glad of being ve-\niled with Power (tho' Infernal) to do it, and to\ngratify thofe vilell of his Paflions, Envy, Revenge,\nMalice and Strife, that the Devil himfelf, as is ob-\nferved in the laft Chapter, is forced to retrain him,\nand gently to divert his Thoughts to fome lefs vi-\nolent and lefs deflru6i:ive Methods; not being wil-\nling, and fometimes indeed not being able, to a\u00a3t\nfo much the Devil as thefe new Hell-fire Agenis\nwould have him a6b it.\nThe Correfpondence being thus fettled between\nthe Devil and the Magician, and the Treaties be-\ntween them figned, ratified, and exchanged in Form,\nthe Inftrument (iVlan) is immediately furnifhed by\nthe Employer (Satan) with all neceffary Qi.ialifica-\ntions for his Bufinefs, and is compleatly qualify'd\nfor an Infernal Mountebank > and fo he falls to his\nJuggling-box and to {hewing his Tricks, his Pawaw-\ning and Conjuring, and in a word, exercifing his\nnew Acquirements and Hellifh Talents upon Man-\nkind} and rhis we call, and that with a great Pro-\npriety of Speech, the BLACK ART.\nThe brief Definition of what we call the Black\njirt^ that is to fay, as I would have ic be under-\nflood in the reft of my Difcourfe, is, that it is a\nnew general Term for all the Branches of that\nCorrefpondence which Mankind has maintained,\nor does, or can carry oH; between himfelf and the\nDevil,\n\fJ20 A S r S T E M\nDevilj between this and the Infernal World j com-\nprifing all the eight Particulars which I mentioned\nbefore, as they are taken frbm the Prohibition of\nthem, and the Declaration againft them in the\nLaw oi Mofesy viz.\nDivinifJg^ the fame as Southfafing,\nOhferving of 'Times.\nUfing Inchantment,\nWitchcraft,\nCharming^ or fetting of Spells.\nDealing with Familiar Spirits,\nIVizardizing,^ or Sorcery^ thought to be the fam^\nas Witchcraft, but miftaken.\nNecromancing,\nThe Pra\u00a3l:ice of thefc, or of any of them, or of\nall of them, is what we arc tounderftand by this ge-\nneral Term the Black Art \\ and as thefe feveral Parts\nare exprefs'd after a differing manner, and per\u00ab^\nhaps praftis'd in a differing Form in feveral and re-\nmote Parts of the World, it may be neceffary to\ngive a brief Defcription of them one by onej that\nfo when we name them apart, I may yet be right-\nly underflood, and may need no more Digreflion?\nfor Explanation of Terms as I go on.\nI. Divining, A Diviner I underftand to be the\nfame as was antienly called a Southfayer-y this is ex-\nprefly confirmed in Scripture, if you will take iis\nAuthority for any thing, Acts xvi. i6. ji certain\nDamfel pojfejfed with a Spirit of Divination met us,\n*ivho brought her Mafier great Gain by South faying :\nSo that Divination and Southfaying is the fame\nthing.\nN, B.

Obfervers of 7'mes, Thefe I take to be fome,\nwho, by Correfpondence with an evil Spirit, de-\nclared fuch and fuch Days or Times to have a\nparticular Fatality, fo that no Bufinefs which was\nundertaken on that Day could profper j and this\nPart of the Black Art may take in fuch as carrying\non the Study of judicial Aftrology to the extreme,\nand to the Gates of Hell, afcribe Events of Things\nto the Government and Influence of the Stars, and\nthat Influence to be fo or fo direfted for Good or\nEvil, according to the particular Polition, Oppofi-\ntion, Conjun61:ion or Situation of thofe Stars or\nPlanets in differing Houfes j as if thefe could be the\nDirectors of the Fate of Perfons, Families and Na-\ntions > and that the Events of things were directed\nby them, and by the Seafons and Times of their\nStations here or there in the Courfe of their ordi-\nnary Motion, whether dire6t or retrogade: In a\nword, the Pra6lice of judicial Aftrology, tho' not\na dealing with, or by the Help of the Devil^ is\ncondemn'd here, as being a plain robbing Divine\nProvidence of its known Glory, in dire61:ing and dif-\npofing both Caufes and Events in all things relating\nto the Government of Mankind, or indeed of the\nwhole World, and afcribing that to the poor\ninnocent unconcerned Stars or Planets which is\nfmgly in the Dilpofition of him that made them.\nThe Stars and Planers are no intelligent Beings j\nthe^ have indeed a vegetative or adivc Life, but as to\nKnow-\n\f222 A S r S T E M\nKnowledge or Acquaintance of or with human AF-'\nfairs they are entirely lifelefs Bodies, utterly incapable\nof influencing or diredting any thing, or of any\nMotion or Adion, other than by the Direftion of the\nfatne Power and Providence which made and guides\nthem in common with the reft of the World.\n3. Uftng Inchantments, Thefe are varioufly de-\nfcrib'd by the Ancients 5 but to explain it by our\nmodern Terms of Art, this is what we call Con-\njuring; and this is certainly performed by the im-\nmediate Agency and Afliftance of the evil Spirit,\nwhen the Magician ufing thefe Inchantments,\nworks by the fecret Aid of the Devil fome won-\nderful thing, fo as to furprife the Beholders, and\nmake them think the Operator is vefted with fu-\npernatural Power, and confequently is fome ex-\ntraordinary Man. Thus when St. Paul healed the\nlame Man at Lyftra^ the People, furprifed with the\nMiracle, cry'd out prefently, ^fhe Gods are come\ndcajn to us in the Likenefs of Men. Thus the Ma-\ngicians in Pharaoh's Court made Frogs, turn'd the\nWater into Blood, and the Rods into Serpents by\ntheir Inchantments, that is to fay, by the immedi-\nate Hand of the Devih, who was permitted, k\nfeems, to increafe the Phguesof JEgypt^ doing Mif-\nchief being his particular Talent : But I do not\nread that whenever jiaron and Mofes denounced\nany of thofe Plagues, the Magicians could ftop or\nprevent them 5 if they could have done that\nindeed, they had been worth Notice, but it\nwas quite otherwife ; for, left they fhould boaft\ntoo much of their Power, they were reftrain-\ned, and not able to make Lice, tho' they had\nmade Frogs and Serpents \u2022, but they were obliged\nto acknowledge in publick, that they were unable\nto do it, that it was the Finger of God, and that\nhe had put a ftop to their f nchantments 5 in a word,\nit made them acknowledge that, according to an\nold\n\fof M A G I C K. 2Z3\nold Proverb which, for ought I know, is derived\nfrom thence, G OD is above the Devil.\n4. Witchcraft. This is indeed the blackeft pare\nof the Black Art it felf: I need not defcribeit any\nfarther than this, that it is a Power received im-\nmediately from the Devil to do Mifchiefj to gratify\nRage, Envy, Malice, Revenge, and the vilell Paf-\nfions of Men, giving it into their Hands to be-\nwitch Men, Cattle, Places and Things 5 to burn\nand deftroy, tho' limited, as hinted before in many\nParticulars 3 the Effefts of this Witchcraft we of-\nten fee, and fliall fay more to it in its Place.\nThis includes Perfons being immediately agi-\ntated by an evil Spirit, carried often violently\ninto the Air by the Help of the DeviU and being\nable to carry away others in the Air alioj and noc\ntoinfift upon all the improbable things faid of them,\nand faid to be done by them> yet chat the Devil\ncertainly plays his Pranks by thofe Tools fomctimes\nin a mod extravagant manner, I muft grant. Why\nit is generally pra6tis'd by old Women only, is a\nPoint to be confider'd by itfelf.\nIn this Article of Witchcraft is included what we\ncall an Evil Tongue, an evil Eye, Curfing, Blading,\nBewitching, and abundance of Hellifh thmgs which\nthofe Creatures are permitted to pradtife, to the\nHurt of thofe that they point their Malice againfl.\nf. Charming. This is certainly a Piece of tJie\nBlack Art, and confifts of divers Branches, fuch as\nfetting Spells, drawing Circles, within which if the\nPerfon to be operated upon fets his Feet, he fhall noc\nbe able to ftir out of the Compafs of it with-\nout Leave from the Charmer j likcwife Dozings,\ngiving Filters, Potions, and Hellirti Contrivances\nto caufe Barrennefs, Impotence, Idiotifm, Lunacy,\nLove, Hatred, and abundance more namelefs Wick-\ncdnefles, which nothing but the Z)fi;;7 and Father\nof Mifchief could empower them to ^0.\n6, Dealing\n\f[x24 ^^ SYSTEM\n6. Dealing with Familiar Spirits. This is wKat\nwas more immediately proper to a Magician 5 I\nmean, fuch a Diabolical Magician as I have been\ndefcribing j and as the Title exprefles it, is an im-\nmediate converiing witH a Z)^w7, who always attendis\nhim at his Call, to come and go as he pleafes, to\nconfult with, be advifed and direded by, and in a\nword, to do for him whatever He, the Magician\ndefires.\nThus we read that King Menaffes dealt with the\nDevil 'y the Text fays exprcfly, he ufed Witchcraft\nand Inchantments^ and dealt with a familiar Spirit, KvA\nwho could doubt it, from what followed? nothing\nbut a Man abandoned to Hell, arid that had the\nDevil at his Elbow^ could have been prevailed with\nto do what he did, which at that time was the\nmod dangerous piece of Impudence that ever had\nbeen heard of, viz. to fet a carved Image in the\n, very Temple, the Houfe of God.\n7. Wizards. This fome take to be nothing but\nwhat they call a Man Witch 5 but in the Pra6ticc\nit hath been carried farther^ namely, to be one that\nconfults with the Devil, to give Anfwers to difficult\nQueflions, to reveal and difcover Corifpiracies, and\nto govern the greater things of Lifej as to blaft ot\nfucceed the Enterprizes of Princes and People 5 to\ntell and foretell the Succefs of fuch and fuch Un-\ndertakings j and even to influence the Undertakers.\nSuch a one as this was Baalim, who being fam'd\nfor a Wizard, was fcnt for a long way by the King\noF Moab to curfe the Camp and Army df the He-\nbrews.\nThe Northern Word ufed in our own Country\nfor this Kind is a Warlock, the antient Import of\nwhich was one that could give good or bad Speed\nto any Undertaking, or at leaft could foretell whe-\nther the thing enquired about ihould fuceeed or no*\nWa\n\fof M A G 1 C K. xif\nWe have abundance of merry Tales fcatter'd a-*\nbroad in the Oral Tradition of antient times, and\namong thofe antient things called Old Women^ con-*\ncerning Wizards : how the Kings and Princes ufed\nto eonfult with them, before they undertook any\ngreat Enterprize : They tell you in the Norths\nhow an old Wizard warned King 'James IV of\nScotland who was killed at Flodden Field^ not to paft\nthe 7'weed with his Army, but encamp on the Nor*\nthern Bank of the River^ and that if the Englijb\npaflcd the Water of T^weed to attack him, he fhould\ncertainly defeat and overthrow them j but that if\nhe fought on Englijh Ground, he fhould lofe both\nhis Army and his Life 5 which accordingly hap-\npen'd. They relate the fame of old Mother Shipton\nin England^ who, (tho' fo many Fables are made of\nher) was a real and known Perfon, and was not a\nWitch or a Prophetefs, but a iVarlock or Wizard^\nand 'tis certain fhe did foretell to Cardinal fFoolfey\nhis falling into Difgrace at Court, his Lofs of the\nKing's Favour, and his Death > all which according*\nly happen'd.\n8. The lalt of thefe is a Necromancer^ a Word\nvery antient, and containing indeed the Black Ate\nin its full Perfedbionj this being One who not like\nthe Wizard foretold or prediftedj hut who, when\nthe People Came to him, would carry them to his\nOriginals, that is to fay, would go to work, and\nbring the Devil up by his Art to talk with and do\ntheir Bufinefs for them himfclf> and this indeed\nmight properly be faid to be a Teacher of tha\nBlack Art, that is to fay, not that he could tie the\nDevil down to appear to the Perfon, whoever iC\nwas, that he took a Fee 0^^ and be at his Sum-\nmons as he was before at his the Necromancer s own>\nbut if ever any Perfon had a mind to come into\nthe wicked Clafs, and have a Perfonal Conference\nwith the Devil in order to make a Bargain with\nCL him,\n\fZ2i A SYSTEM\nhim, the Necromancer's Bufinefs was to raife the\nDevils prefent the Stranger, bring them acquaint-\ned, and then leave the Bevil and the Man to agree\nthe Matter among themfelves.\nIn a word, the Necromancer, (like the famous\nMr. TVhifton of good, lying, merry Memory) was the\nDeviPs Broker, neither more or lefsj he brings\nGrift to the DeviVs Mill, Cuftomers to his Shop,\nand farthers his Trade, and his own Gain by the or-\ndinary Method of his Employment.\nIt is true thefe blackeft of the Black-Art Men\nhave a great many other things in their Praftice,\nbefides that of brokering for the Devil -y they were\nufed to raife Storms, Whirlwinds, and Hurricanes,\nby which they made themfelves very terrible to rhe\nPeople, as if it was in their Power to do all the\nmifchievous 'things in the World: By this they\nbrought in their Cuftomers, for the People ufually\nbrib'd them, as the Indians worfhip the Devil that\nhe may do them no Harm. The ftrong Opinion\nthe common People had of thefe Men in time\npaft was fuch, that they would go to them for\nRain in Drought, and for fair Weather in Harveft,\nfor Abatement of Floods, and for prote\u00a3bing their\nCattle in Lightning and Thunder.\nTo fum them up all, the Diviner and Southfayer,\nthe judicial Aftrologer and Conjurer, the Inchanter\nand Charmer, the Witch and the Wizard, the Ne-\ncromancer and Dealer with a Familiar Spirit all put\ntogether and pra<5lifed in their fulleft Extent, make\nup this One Black Art which I am fpeaking of, in\nits Perfe6tion 5 and in this Senfe I am to be under-\nftood in the following Part of this Work.\nOnly rake a few Hints by way of Obfervation,\non this Occafion, viz. that the Devil has fome lit-\ntle Out-lyers and fculking Operators in the World,\nand which he makes great ufe of, which may not\nbe faid to come under any of thofe Denominations > as\npar-\n\fof MAGIC K. ij;.\nparticularly our Second-fight Men in Scotland-^ the\nWind Merchants in Norway^ who fell fair and foul\nWeather, Storms and Calms, as the Devil and you can\nagree upon a Price, and as y >ur Occafions require\n:\nAlio in l.apland^ Mufcovy^ Siberia and other Nor-\nthern Parts of the World, he is faid to a6t by dif-\nfering Methods, and govern his Dominions by a\nmore open and arbitrary Method, not prcfcribed and\nlimited to Art and Craft as ^e does here.\nWe have alfo f >me new Praftitioncrs in Magick\namong ourfelves, who deal with the Devil in a more\nexalted fublime Way, and who, for ought I know^\nare able to teach the Devil fomc new and more-\naccurate ways of managing them, and the reft of\nthe World too, than ever he knew before. In a\nword, inftead of enquiring at the Devirs Oracle,\nand learning from him, I think the Devil muft even\ncome to School to them j for as Alphonfus ot Caftile\nfaid.

At firft, the Devil had fomc\nDifficulty with Mankind, was oblig'd to aft with\ngreat Crafc and Subtilty, to make his Acquaintance\namong them, as I have obferv'd at large j after\nthis he got the Afcendant to fuch a degree, that\nhe (as the Devil you know is apt to encroach where\nhe finds room for it) fet himfelf up for a Guide,\nthen a Governor, then a God j was firft follow'd\nas a Dire6bor or Advifer, next obey'd and fubmitted\nto as a Governor and Commander > and then (for\nhe never rejis) worfliipp'd as a God 5 which no doubt\nwas his firft, and of Neceffity muft be his higheft\nAim and Ambition.\nBut now, by we know not what Fate, Mankind\nfeems to have got the better of him j inftead of be-\ning waited upon in Form, and humbly expe6l:ed, as\nin his firft Appearances > inftead oihtmgPaw-wa*dj\nand great Aftemblies and Ceremonies us'd to ob-\ntain an Audience of him, he comes now at every\nold Woman's Call, and upon the moft trifling Oc-\ncafion 5 inftead of being a Counfellor or an Advi-\nfer, much lefs a Governor, now he's a meer Er-\nrand Boy, runs and goes, will do any Drudgery,\nwork like a Horfe, fetch and carry like a Dog, dig\nDitches, carry Burthens, build Churches, or any\nthing the Priefts and the Conjurers bid him doj\nwitnefs New-Market Heathy Stone-hengc^ Crowland\nAbhey^ and a thoufand more things, which to be\nfure the Devil did, becaufe we don't know how\nclfe they could be done.\nThe Magicians were formerly the DeviVs Ser-\nvants, but now they are his Mafters, and that to\nfuch a degree, that 'tis but drawing a Circle,\ncafting a few Figures, muttering a little Ara-\nhick^ and up comes the Devil^ as readily as the\nPrawer at a Tavern, with a d'ye call Sir? or like ^\nScot^\n\ftjo A S r S T E M\nScots Caudey with Whafs your Honoufs Wull Sir ?\nNay, and as the learned in the Art fay, He muft come,\nhe carCt help it: Then as to tempting, he's quite out\nof Doors. And I think, as the old Parliament did by\nthe Biihops, wc may e'en 'vote him ufekfs: In a\nword, there's no manner of Occafion for him;\nMankind are as forward as he can wifh and defire of\nthem : Nay, fome cunning Men tell us we fin fa^\niter than the Devil can keep Pace with us ; as wit-\nnefs the late witty and moderately wicked Lady \u2014\n^\nwho blefs'd her Stars, that the Devil never tempted\n^ her to any thing, he underftood himfelf better, for\nfhe knew well enough how to fin without him,\nand that it would be lofing his time to talk to\nher.\nLikewife our happy Friend the much honoured\nSir\/\/ ,who values himfelf upon this particu-\nkr Accoraplifliment, that he is able to SIN like a\nGentleman 'y nay he merits much from Satan, in that,\nif he may be believed when he fpeaks the worft of\nhimfelf, he is alfo able to teach him (the Devil) to\nbe more refinedly wicked than he is : This\nSir H certainly gives the Devil very little\nTrouble about him : and tho' I don't hear that the\nold Gentleman is yet come to School to the Ba-\nronet; yet as the Baronet don't come to learn of\nhim, fo he (the Devil) need not come to reach him,\nfor that he is certainly as well accomplifiied in the\nhorrid Art as the Devil can make him.\nThe Age we live in, fruitful in Black Arts (whe-\nther in that which by way of Eminence we call\nBlack Art or no, is yet undetermined) affords us\nmany, I dare not fay bright.

After this he\nthought he might make a little Game with th^\nDevU'y (o he calls him up again, and when he\ncame, the Spirit ask'd him, what was the Bufinefsj\nhe told him, he had no Bufinefs, only called him\nfor his Company, and to be better acquainted.

I wonder indeed you han't been reveng'd of\nher already, coniidering your furious Spirit: why\nyon\n\fof M A G I C K. 1^7\nyou arc a Madman, I fhould be afraid you fhould\nmurther your Wife.\nCo.m. Ay Mafter, ihe's afraid o' that too 5 but\nIhe has been too cunning for me, for fhe is run for\nit, and got out of my Clutches.\n^u. She's in the right of it: can you blame her?\nCo.m. Ay, but fhe has robb'd me too.\nj^u. Robb'd you! ay, what could you expeft?\nwhy if you would have murther'd her, fhe muft\nhave been a Fool to have flaid j and if fhe was\nforced to fly, you could not think flic would go\naway empty, could you ?\nCo. m. Well, I will find thetn out, if they are a-\nbove Ground.\nAu, If you can, you mean 5 but pray are they\ngone together?\nCo. m. Nay, if I knew that, then I fliould know\nwho the Rogue is, which is one of the main thing*\nI want to be informed of.\nAu. And which you would be content to go to\nthe Devil to difcovcr ?\nCo.m. If I was furc he or any one clfe could but\ntell me, I didn't care where I went.\nAu. Why, do you think if the Devil did know,\nthat he would tell you ?\nCo.m. Why not, Mafl:cr?\nAu. Why do you think the Devil is more your\nFriend than theirs? do you think he cares how ma*\nny Whores and Cuckolds there are ?\nCo. m. Nay that's true indeed, I did not think of\nthat} but however, I fliall be informed where I\nam going, whether the Devil knows any thing of ,\nit or no j and if he does\nAu. What then, what if he does?\nCo.m, Why then I believe I fliall get it out of\nhim.\nAu. What, d'ye mean, out of the i)m\/ .? why,\nwhere arc you going ?\nS Co.m.\n\fIJ 8 A ST S T E M\nCo. m. To one of his Acquaintance, Mafter, that\nwill tell me, I dare %, for a Piece of Money j and\ntho' the Jade han't left mc a Shirt to my Back, I\nhave borrowed a little Money for this Work, and\nI will have it out, if Money will do it.\nAi^. What do you mean. Countryman, are you\nreally going to the Devil?\n'\nCo. m. Why to tell you the Truth, I am going\nto ai Cunning Man, Mafter, hard by Northamptony\nthat I am told will difcover it all to me.\n^u Well, but do you call that going to the De-\nvil ?\nCo.m. Yes certainly, for he deals with the Devily,^\nor elfe he could never do fuch ftrange things.\njiu. What ftrange things does he do ?\nCo.m. Why he can caft a Figure, tell Folk?;\nwhere their loft Cattle are, tell who robs them, and\noftentimes helps them to get their Goods again. -\nj4u And fo you think he can tell who has cuck-\nolded you, don't you?\nCo.m. To be lure he can, Mafter j why ihould\nno*^ he tell one thing as well as another?\n^H. He'll take your Money to be fure, that's all\nyou can be fure of. I tell thee. Countryman, 'tis alt\na Cheat J they are only Rogues and Jugglers, they\nknow nothing of the matter.\nCo m. Why that can't be, Mafter^ they fay he\nwill ihew me the Man's Face in a Looking-glafs.\n^u, And what if he docs ihew you a Man's Face\nand you don't know him, where are you then ?\nCv m Nay, that's none of his Fault.\nJu. 'Twill be his Fault to put a Cheat upon you,\nana xhew you a Face you don't know, pretending\nthat's the Man, and you ne'er the wifer.\nCo.m. Well, bur he will make me dream of the\nMan, and lee him in my Sleep.\n^?\/. Verv well, and fo if you chance to dream of an\nhoneft Man, you will go and murther him will you,\nfor making you a Cuckold ? I tell you your Cunnirig\n4 Man\n\fof M A G I C K. ijj^\nMan is a Cheats he no more deals with the Devil\nthan you do.\nCo.m. Well then, I'll go to Oundle^ there's a\nMan that deals in Magick, and he'll raife the De^\n'vil for me if I defire it, and I fhall fee him and talk\nwith him my felf.\nj^u. And you believe it, do you ?\nCo. m. I fliall believe it fure when I fee it, flian't\nI? why d'ye think I won't believe my own Eyes?\nAu, Why, do you know the Devil when you fee\nhim? how will you be fure 'tis the Devil?\nCo. m. I fhall know him by his cloven Foot,\nfhan't I, Mafter ?\nJu. I believe not j did you ever fee the Devil m\nyour Life ?\nCo.m. No not I, but I have heard of a great ma-\nny that have 5 why is that fuch a ftrange thing,\nMafter?\n^u. 'Tis fuch a ftrange thing, that I don't believe\none Word of it.\nCo.m. What, don't you believe that a Magician\ncan raife the Devil?\nAu. I do not know. Countryman, but the Devil\nmay be called up upon extraordinary Occafionsj\nbut hardly by your threc-half-penny Conjurer, nor\nupon fuch a Bufinefs as yours is.\nCo. m. Why, won't the Devil come when he is\ncalled? why, the Magician 'xtOundk can make him\ncome, they fay, whether he will or no : if he does\nbut draw a Circle and turn round five times in it,\nthe Devil can't help appearing, no more than if we\nfaid the Lord's Prayer backward.\nAu. Why, will he come if we (ay our Prayers\ntwickward ?\nCo.m, Ay, certainly, Mafter $ Why, you don't\n\u2022doubt that, d'ye ?\nAu. Nay, 1 don't fay I doubt it} but did you ever\ntry it your felf ?\nS z Co.m.\n\f^6o A S Y S T E M\nCo. m. No, T never try'd it, that's true ; but I\nhave heard an old Woman at Dav'ntry ufed to\nraife the Devil that Way very often.\njIu. I wonder you fhould not try it, when you\nhave itich Occafion to talk with him.\nCo.m. Ay, I want to talk with him, that I do,\nbut I dare not talk with him by my felf neither.\nylu. Why not } you know well enough what to\nfay to him.\nCo.m. Ay, that's true, but I don't know how to\nmanage him as they doj they are ufed to himj 'tis\ntheir Trade to deal between him and us.\nJu. But it would fave you the Charges, and I\nfancy the Devil and you are no Strangers.\nCo. m. What d'ye mean, Mailer? I never faw hira\nin my Life.\nAu. Well, if you ha'nt been in his Company,\nI dare fay he has heen in yours. ^\nCo.m. Why fo, Mafter?\nAu. You would never talk of hanging your felf,\nand of being hanged for Murther, fo familiarly as\nyou do, if he had not been at work with you.\nCo.m. Why, I am half mad,- Sir > What would\nyou have me do? I mud be revenged on 'em.\nAu, Ay, I told you the Devil had been with you,\n'tis he makes you talk of Revenge ; that's all the\nDevil^ and ends in Damnation j for if he is a Spirit\nwhich waits to devour, and that does all he can to\ndeftroy us, we may very well think all evil Motions\ncome from him.\nCo.m. I don't underftand thofe things, Mafter,\nnot I J but I am fure the Devil has had nothing to\ndo with me, either in that or anything elfe.\nAu. I tell thee, honeft Friend, thou doeft not\nknow when theD^w\/ is working in thee, and when\nnot 5 all fuch horrid Thoughts as thou haft had\nabout Self-murther, Revenge, and doing Mifchief to\nothers, muft be from the DeviL\nCo.m.\n\fof M A Q I C K. rCi\nCo.m. Well, Mafter, let's talk no more of that,\nmy Head runs another way at prefent.\n^u. Why, will you really go to enquire of the\nDevil about who has made you a Cuckold ?\nCo.m. No, not to the Devily I only go to the\n! Cunning Man.\njIh, Yes, and to the Conjur^^r at Oundle^ you fay,\nand he can raife the Devil^ it fecms.\nCo.m. Well then, he deals with the Bevil^ not I.\nAu, And do you think, as I faid before, the Be-\nml would befriend you fo far as to hinder your\nWife's Wickednefs? do think he would not rather\nmake her wickeder than fheis ?\nCo.m. Nay, that's true; but however^ Pd try\nwhat I can do; I am refolv'd I'll go to him.\nWhen I found he was fo pofitive, I bad him e'en\ngo and try the Experiment; but depend upon it,\nfaid I, the Devil won't betray the Secret to youj\nhe is too much o' t'other Side.\nBy this time we were come to ^een\\'Crors^ a\nlittle of this fide Northampton^ j and feei.ng the\nTown from the Hill, I offer'd to go on fafter,\nfeeing I knew the Way was before me : but he be-\nfpoke me to keep him Company; for. Mailer, fays\nhe, if you lye in the Town all Night, Til cer-\ntainly come and tell you what the cunning Man\nfays to me.\nI was not unwilling to hear the Refult of the\nStory, but was particularly curious to hear what\nthe Magician at Oundle could do; fo I refolvcd to\nflay at Northampton that Night, and we kept Com-\npany together to the Town. When we came to\nthe Town, I put up at the George Inn^ and thought\nhe would have gone in with me; but when wecimc\nto the Door, he bad me Good-by for the prefent,\nfor the Cunning Man, he faid, liv'd two Mies ouc\nof the Town, and he would talk with him, and\ncome to me at Night.\nS J I\n\f%6i A s r s r E M^\nI went into my Inn and flaid there all Night,\nbut heard no more of my poor Cuckold the Coun-\ntryman all that Evening. The next Morning I was\nindifpofed, which made mc flay longer at the Inn\nthan I intended, and indeed was obliged to ftay there\nall that Day and Night too, but ftill I had no\nNews of my Countryman, which made me a little\nchagreen 5 but at laft he came back again, and comes\nto me, but not 'till the next Day about eleven\na-Clock.\nThen as I had been waiting before very patient-\nly, I began, and fpoke a little angrily > What's the\nBufinefs now, fays I, what's the matter with you,\nthat you dodge about fo ?\nO Sir, fays he, let me come in, and V\\\\ tell you\nthe flrangeft things\nWell, come in then, fays \/, and fit downj I\nthought you had been loft, or had forgot your\nPromife. So he came in, and we begun another\nfhort Difcourfe, as follows :\nCo.m, O Mafter, I have had a hard Night's Work\non't.\nAu, What do you mean of a Night's Work,\nwhere have you been?\nCo. m. Why firft, Mafter, I went to my cunning\nMan, and gave him a Shilling, which it feems he\ntakes before he will fpeak a Word.\nJu. Ay, ay, they are in the right, 'tis the only\nthing I can call them cunning Men for.\nCo.m. Why are they cunning in that?\nj^u, Becaufe they know if they did not take the\nMoney before- hand, no body would give it them\nafterwards, becaufe they can tell nothing, nor fay\nany thing to the purpofe.\nCo. m. Well, I gave him the Shilling i he de-\nmande4 Haifa Crown, but I told him I was a poor\nMan, and fo he condefccnded in Charity to take a\nShilling.\n\fof M A G I C K, itfj\ni Au. That is to fay, he faw there was no more\nto be had, fo he took what he could get j and fo\nthey all do. But come, what did he do for it, what\"\ndid he rell thee?\nCo.m. O he examined me very ftrift^y, I aflure\nyou.\njiu. Examine you, about what ?\nCo. m. Why, how long my Wife had been gone^\nwhat fhe carried with her,, what a-Clock flie\nwent at, what ihe faid at parting j and took every\nthing down in Figures.\nAu. Very well, this was all Grimace, t9 put a\nCountenance upon things.\nCo. m. Then he bid me hold my Tongue, and he\nfell to making Figures and mutc'ring to hiDifeUji\nand on a fudden he flarts up j Well, fays he, 1 find\nyour Wife is gone away, and that you b^at her\nvery feverely before ihe went. Now, T c Uid\nnot deny that Part, Mafter, becaufe I knew it was\ntrue 5 but how Ihould he know that, Mafter, if he\nwan't a cunning Man?\nAu, Well enough : when he had examined you fo\nftri6tly before in all the Particulars, he might eafi-\nly guefs you had ufed her hardly, by the Rai^e you\nwere in^ when you came to him> and when y ii\ntalk*d of hanging your felf and murthcring her, he\nmight eafily judge that you had talked ihe fiUK ta\nher, which had frighted the Woman, and ihe vas\nrunaway for fear of you \\ there's no great cunnino^\nin all that. I was a going to fay fj to you my iclf\nonce, for I really thought of it before.\nCo,m. Why then you are as much a cuniung\nMan as he.\nAu. Well, what elfe did he fay to you ?\nCo,m. Nothing to the purpofe, only to vex me\nand make me mad.\nAu. Nay that he could not do, for I verily think\nyou were mad before > but what was ic ? come, tell ms.\nS 4 Co.m.\n\ft64 A S r S T E M\nCo.m. Why, Mafter, he fell to fcribbling and\nfcrawling again upon a Piece of Paper, and then he\nrifes and walks up and down, and round and\nround, as I thought, he made Circles three or four\ntimes, and talk'd to himfelf all the while.\nJu. Well, and that frighted you, I warrant you j\ndid not you think he was going to raife the De-\nvil ?\nCo, m. Why you know every thing, Maftcr, afore-\nhand, I think you are as cunning as he 5 I was fo\nfrighted I trembled like an Afpen Leaf, Mafter.\n^\u00ab. Why, didn't you fay you wanted to fee\nthe Devilj to tell you all ?\nCo,m. Ay, that's true, Maftcr, but I was deadly\nfraid for all that, efpecially when I thought he was\njuft a coming.\nj^u. Well, and how then, what came of it ?\nCo,m. Came on it! why, Mafter, the Man's a\nRogue, a meer Cheat j he had got my Money, and\nwhen all come to all, he told me nothing, at leaft\nnothing that fignified any thing to me.\njfu. Well, but what was it? for I find he told\nyou fomething, tho' you don't hke it : did he bid\nyou go home and be quiet and eafie, and not trou-\nble your felf about it ?\nCo.m, Hang him, Rogue 5 when he had made all\nhis Turns, and his Circles, and faid all his Witch-\ncraft over to himfelf, he fits down and calls me to\nhim, and very civilly bad me fit down, and begun\nhis ugly Story.\n^tf, I find he has not pleafed ye : I really fancy\nthe Man has given thee good honeft Advice, and\nbid thee go home and mind thy Bufinefs, and be\neafie 5 did not 1 fay the fame to thee ?\nCo,m. ril tell it you all, Mafter, if you'll have\nPatience 5 he's a Rogue 5 a Rogue, Mafter. I told\nyou he would have my Money beforehand, and fo\nhe had, or he fhould never ha' hgd a Farthing;\ngnd he kuew that well enough. Ju,\n\fof M A G I C K. 2<^r\nAu, No, no, he knew Folks never pay when they\ndon'c like the Story > but go on, what did he\nfay?\nCo.m, Why, as grave as a Judge, he takes me by\nthe Hand, felt my Pulfe, holding his conjuring Paper\nin t'other Hand, all the while > Heark thee. Friend,\nfays he, I have calculated the Times and the Senfons,\nI have brought your Names in a dired Oppofition,\nI have done every thing to fatisfy you, that can\nbe done, and all my Numbers and Accounts agree,\nand this is the Sura of your Cafej You are a poor,\nhoncft, fretful, paiffionate Fellow that ftands here\non one Side J and then he {hewed me his damned\nFigures, and Crofles and Circles, on one fide 3 and\nhere's your poor Wife a t'other fide, fays he 5 and\nthen he fhewed me his Figures again j fhe has anger'd\nyou, and fcolded at you for your ill Ufage of her,\nand you have fallen upon her and beaten her un-\nmercifully, and threaten'd to murther her, and fhe is\nrun away for fear of it 5 and now you call her\nWhore, and come to me to tell you who has made\na Cuckold of you.\nAu. And did the Man fay all this to you. Friend >\nCo.m. Yes, Mafter, and a great deal more, like\na Rogue as he is. He a cunning Man ! he's a Block-\nhead J why, I knew all that before.\nAu. Ay, and he might eafily gather it from your\nDifcourfe.\nCo.m. No, Matter, that he could not, I'm fure.\nAu. Well then, you'll make him a cunning Man\nindeed, at the fiime time that you call him a Block-\nhead and a Fool. I tell you I gather'd as much be-\nfore from you, and you can't help itj you are too\nfull of your own Story. But go on, what did he\nfay then ?\nCo.m, Why, then he fell to preaching, and giv-\ning me Advice > Go home, Friend, fays the Toad,\njmd be eafie and (juiet, and tell your Friends you are\nforry\n\f66 A S T S r E M\nforry you have been in fuch a Heat, and that you\nhope your Wife will come home again, for you\nwon't do her any Hurt; and then your Neigh-\nbours will cell her, and fhe'll come lovingly again\nto you y For 1 lell thee Friend, fays he, thou art\nin the Wrong, the poor Woman is no Whore, I\ncan Ihow ic you in black and white here ; and then\nhe pointed to his curfed Conjuring Papery fhe's a\nvery honeft Woman, thou haft only a Whymfie\ncome in thy Head becaufe fhe is gone, I tell thee\nthou art no Cuckold, go home and be quiet.\nylu. And did he fay all this to thee ?\nCo. m. Yes, to be fure Mafter, and a great deal\nmore fuch Stuffj what fliould I be in fuch a Paf-\nfion with him for elfe?\njiu, Upnn my Word, Friend, whether he be a\ncunning Man or no, that I have nothing to fay\nto 5 he may make thee believe fo, that's for his Ad-\nvantage > but o'my Confcience 1 think he's a wife\nMan, and an honeft Man, and I would advife thee\nto follow his Counfelj for I do tell thee, I firmly\nbelieve 'tis thy Cafe to a Tittle, and 1 tell thee thy\nwhole Difcourfe difcovcr'd it 5 he might have faid\nit all without his Figures and Circles 5 that was\ndone to amufe you, but 'tis plain from all you have\nfaid, that's thy very Cafe.\nCo. m. Ay, ay, Mafter, 'tis no matter for that,\nlet him be as cunning and as wife as he will, I\nhave had anotherguefs Account of it, and better\nAdvice fincej for I have been at Oundle^ Mafter,\nfince that, and there I have met with a cunning\nMan indeed.\nAu. Why, have you really been confulting with\nthe Devil then?\nCo. m. I believe I have indeed.\nAu. Nay, then 'tis like you have had good Ad-\nvice indeed 5 mayn't a body know what you have\nmet with there too?\nCo, m.\n\fof M A G I C K. 267\nCo. tn. Truly Mafter, I don't know whether I\ncan tell it you or no, f\u00a9r I have been frighted out\nof my Wits. I'm fure if my Hat had been on, my\nHair would have lifted it off, tho' 1 had had a good\nBasket of Apples upon my Head.\nj4u. Come Ice me hear it however, as well as you\ncan.\nCo. m. Why Mafter, when I came to the Man's\nHoufe, ('tis within two Mileof 0;^W\/^ I think, or\nthereabout,) it was almoft dark, and that made it\n'\nthe worfc. I knock'd at the Door, and out came a\ntall black frightful old Man. 1 begun to be fright-\ned at the very firft Sight, for I thought it had been\nthe Devil was come before I a^k'd for him.\nAu. And are you fure it was not.^^\nCo. m. Yes, I think he was not the Devils for\nhe fpoke very civilly to mej and when I ask'd him\nif he was the cunning Man, he fmil'd, and had me\ncome in ; fo he carry'd me into a large Room,\nwhich had but one dim burning Candle in it, and\nI trembl'd every Inch of me, for I thought the\nCandle burnt blue as foon as I look'd at it.\nAu, Very well, fo you thought you were come\ninto good Company, did not you.'*\nCo. m. Indeed, I widi'd my felf out of the Houfe\nagain, that I did> but the old Gentleman whiftkd,\nand in came a young Fellow thai look'd like a Ser-\nvant, and he bad him go fnuff the Candle, and\nbring in another, and that comforted me a little j\nthen he fat him down in a great Elbow-Chair,\nwith a little Table before it, and upon the Table\nwas a great many Books, and a Pen and Ink, and\nPaper. Come Friend, fays he, let me know thy\nBufinefs, for tho' I am none of thofc ignorant Fel-\nlows you call Cunning Men, yet perhaps I may-\ntell you what you want to know, upon a better\nfoot,\n\f2<J8 A S Y S T E M\nAu, Well, he begun pretty high : what could he\npretend to ?\nCo. m, I reply'd. Sir, I was told you was one\nthat dealt in fecret things, that underftood the Black\njirt^ and thofe we call Cunning Men 5 if 1 am mi-\nflaken, I am very forry : and fo made as if I would\ngo away again, but he flopp'd me, and faid. Look\nyou Friend, I am none of thofe Fellows you call\ncunning Men, I look upon them to be all Cheats 5\nmy Pradice is all Divine, of a fuperior Nature, I\nItudy things in a higher Sphere, I deal in the My-\nileries of an invifible World, and converfe with the\nWorld of Spirits unembody'd, who are beneficent\nand kind to us, who are Spirits embody'd, and not\nonly converfe with us below, but are helpful and\nferviceable to us on all Occafions. I can't remem-\nber all his hard Words, Matter, but he faid a deal\nmore to that purpofe.\nAu. Well, did not he ask for your Money be-\nfore hand too, as t'other did ?\nCo. m. No indeed, but when he bad me tell him\nmy Cafe, I put my Hand in my Pocket, and puH'd\nout two half Crowns, and went to offer him the\nMoney, for I found he was not an ordinary Fel-\nlow, and fo I thought he would not be very low-\npriz'd.\nAu. But he took the Money, I fuppofe?\nCo. m. No, he faid he did not do thefe things\nfor Money, as he found I believ'd he did j but he\nfaid, you may put what you pleafe in there, poin-\nting to a Box that flood upon the Table j I ihall\ndifpofc of it charitably, and to better Ufes, it may be,\nthan you would do your felf ; fo I put the Money\ninto his Box, which had a flit like a Tradefman's\nTill.\n4\nAu. Very well, this look'd great indeed.\nCo. m. Then he bad me tell him my Cafe 5 for,\nfays he, I perceive you are a Man of a troubled\nCountenance,\n\fof M A G I C K. 2(5p\nCountenance, your Mind is opprefs'd, the Paflions\nof your Soul have been in a Perturbation, your\nSpirits are fluttering flill, and in a Storm, tho*\nfomething abated of what they have been 5 pray be\nvery free, and tell me your whole Cafe, as fully and\nplainly as you can.\ny^u. Well, I alTure you, he fpoke in flate with a\ngreat deal of Majefty.\nCo. m. Yes, and yet he fpoke very courteoufly\ntoo, and I began to like him mightily j fo I began,\nand told him my Cafe at large, jufl as I did you,\nMafter.\njIu, That is to fay, that you wanted to be re-\nveng'd of your Wife, and to find out the Man that\nhad cuckolded you, and the like j fo you expefted\nprefently he ihould tell you who it was.\nCo, rn. Yes, fo I did 5 but he brought me to un-\nderftand things better, and I found he was in Ear-\nneft, and that he was not to be cheated. He ex-\namined me too as t'other had done, and ask'd me\nabundance of Queftions.\nAu, And, I doubt not, gathered your Cafe in e-\nvery Part of it from the weak inconfiftent Account\nyou gave him of it.\nCo. m. I don't know that j but after he had done\nasking me all his Queftions, he took his Pen and Ink\ntoo, and wrote down a great many things upon his\nPaper, and made Lines with a fliort brafs Rule and\na Pencil, and then took out a pair of Compafles,\nand drew fevcral Figures and Marks, but I under-\nilood nothing of them, neither could I fee them\ndiftindly by the Candle Light j then he ask'd me\nmy Chriftian Name, which I told him was Edward^\nand he fet it down in great Letters, but fuch as\ntho' I can read Mafter, I am fure that I never faw\nfuch Before. Then he ask'd my Wife's Chriftian\nName too, which I told him was Abigail and he\nfet that down in the fame kind of Letters as before\n5\nthen\n\f270 A S Y S T E M\nthen he ask'd my Age, and my Wife's Age, and\nthe Age of my two Children > of all which I gave\nhim a full Account.\nAn. 1 fuppofe you had told him that you had\ntwoChiidren> he did not conjure out that, did he^\nCo. m. Yes, he had ask'd me that before, and I\ntold himj fo when he had done all, and I believe\nwe had ralk'd together above an Hour, he rofe up,\nand offered to go away, and I rofe up too, but he\nJaui his Ha .d upon my Arm, Do you fit Hill, fays\nhe, and I'll come to you again 5 at which I was a\nlittle frjghtf'd to be left alone, and he perceiv'd it.\nDon't be afraid, fays he, there fhall nothing hurt\nyou, nor fpeak to you j and if you hear any Noife\ndon't you ftir, but fit Itill here. So he took up one\nof the Candles, and went into another Room by a\nlittle Door hke a Clolet-Door, and when he {hut\nthe Door after him, I perceiv'd a little Window of\none broad Square of Glafs only, that look'd into\nthe Room which he was gone into.\nJu. 1 warrant ye, you wanted to peep, did not ye?\nCo. m. Yes, I did, but I durft not ftir for my\nLife, becaufe he had charg'd me I fhould not.\nAu. Well, but you was to hear fomc Noifcs, was\nyou not ?\nCo. m. But I did not, except once that I heard a\nNoife like the drawing of a Chair upon the Floor,\nvhich being nothing but what was ordinary, did\nnot difturb me.\nAu. WelL how long did he ftay?\nCo. m. About half an Hour, and came in again,\nlookmg very well pleas'd, and ask'd me how 1 did,\nand then fir down as before. Well, fays he, I have\nbeen confulting on your Cafe, and I find things not\nfo threatning to you as I expededj perhaps you\nmay not be in fo ill a Cafe as you imagine > how-\never, I am order'd to tell you, that fomc Days af-\nter your return, your Wife ihall come to a Houfe\nnear\n\fof M A G I C K. 271\nnear you, and fend to know if you will receive her\nagain kindly 3 if the Perfon ihe fends is a Woman,\nyou may conclude your Wife has abus'd you j but\nif ihe fends a Man, then ihe is innocent, and you\nare miftaken.\nAu. This was point-blank, I aflure you.\nCo. m. I did not like it however, and that he\nmight fee well enough 5 for I can't allow any if 's\nor and's. Tell me of being miilaken! faid I to him,\nI can't be miftaken. Well, fays he, I'll go again\nand confult farther about you 5 and feeing me be-\ngin to get up too, he turns again 5 You are not\n*\nafraid, fays he, are you ? No, not at all, faid I ?\nWell, nor you won't be afraid, will you, if you fee\nnothing frightful? No, not at all, faid I again. But\nI ly'd, Mafter, for I was almoil frighted to Death,\nwhen he fpoke of ray feeing foraethingj but as I\nhad faid No twice, and fpoke it pretty heartily too,\nhe faid. Well then, come along with me into the\nnext Room.\njiu. I doubt you were afraid then indeed.\nCo. m. Ay, fo I was heartily, and he perceiv'd it\ntoo again j Well, fays he, if you are afraid to go\ninto my Room of Pradtice, I'll ftay here with you 5\nonly, whatever you fee or hear fit you itill, and\nneither fpeak or ftir out of your Chair.\nAu. Well, did you obferve his Direction ?\nCo. m. No, indeed Mafter, my Heart fail'd me;\nI durft neither go nor ftay, but I'll tell you what I\ndid when he was gone into the next Room, I went\nto the Window and peep'd.\nAu. And what did you fee? 'tis odd peeping at\nthe Devil^ I muft tell you.\nCo, m. 1 faw my old Gentleman in a great Chair,\nand two more in Chairs at fome Diftance, and three\ngreat Candles, and a great Sheet of white Paper\nupon the Floor between them j every one of them had\na long white Wand in their Hands, the lower end\nof which touch'd the Sheet of Paper. Au,\n\f172 A S r S T E M\nJu. And were the Candles upon the Ground\ntoo?\nCo. m. Yes, all of them.\nAu, There was a great deal of Ceremony about\nyou, I alTure you,\nCo. m. I think fo too, but it is not done yetj\nimmediately I heard the little Door ftir, as if it was\nopening, and away I skipp'd as foftly as I could\ntread, and got into my Chair again, and fat there\nas gravely as if I had never ftirr'd out of it. I was\nno Iboner fet but the Door open'd indeed, and the\nold Gentleman came out as before, and turning to\nnie, faid. Sit (till, don't ye ftirj and at that Word,\nthe other two that were with him in the Room\nwalk'd out after him, one after another crofs\nthe Room, as if to go out at the other Door where\nI came in 5 but at the farther end of the Room\nthey ftop'd, and turn'd their Faces to one another\nand talk*d j but it was fome Devil's Language of\ntheir own, for I could underftand nothing of it.\nAu, And now I fuppofe you were frighted in\nearnefl ?\nCo. m. Ay, fo I was 5 but it was worfe yet, for\nthey had not flood long together, but the great\nElbow-Chair which the old Gentleman fat in at\nthe little Table juft by me began to ftir of it felf j\nat which the old Gentleman knowing I ihould be\nafraid, came to me and faid. Sit ftill, don't you ftir,\nall will be well, you (hall have no harm \\ at which\nhe gave his Chair a kick with his Foot, and faid.\nGo, with fome other Words, and of other Language,\nand away went the obedient Chair Aiding two of\nits Legs on the Ground, and the other two ofF, as\nif fome body had dragg'd it by that Part.\nAu. And fo no doubt they did, tho' you could\nnot fee it.\nCo. m. Asfoon as the Chair was dragg'd or mov'd\nto the end of the Room, where the three, I know\nnot\n\fof M A G 1 C K. Z73\nnot what ro call 'em, were, two other Chairs did\nthe like from the other fide of che Room, and fo\nthey all fat down, and talk'd together a good while 5\nat laft the. Door at that end of the Room opened\ntoo, and they all were gone in a Moment without\nrifing out of their Chairs > for I am fure they did\nnot rife to go out, as other Folks do.\nAu, What did you think of your felf, when you\nfaw (he Chair flir fo near youi\nCo m Thin!:! niy, I did not think j I was dead,\nto be lure I was dead, with the Fright, and expcded\nI lliould be carry'd away, Chair and all, the next\nMoment. Then it was, I fay, that my Hair w^nild\nhave lifted off my Hat, if it had been on I am fure\nit would.\nAh. Well, but when they were all gone, you\ncame to your felf again, I fuppofe?\nCo. m. To tell you the truth Mafter, I am not\ncome to my felf yet.\nAu. But go on, let me know how it ended.\nCo. m. Why, after a little while my old Man\ncame in again, call'd his Man to let the Chairs to\nrights, and chcn fat him doji^n at the Table, fpoke\nchearfully to me, and ask'd me if I would drink,\nwhich I refus'd, tho' I was a-dry indeed. I believe\nthe fright had made me dryj but as I never had\nbeen us'd to drink with the Devil^ I didn't know\nwhat to think of it, fo I let it alone.\nAu. But you might e'en have ventured, for the\nold Necromancer was but a Man, whatever Cor-\nrefpondence he might have, and his Ale would not\nhave hurt you. But what elfe did he fay about your\nBufmefs.?^\n'\nCo. m. Why, he told me the invifible Agents\nwere favourable in their Anfwersj that there ap-\npeared nothing but wellj that he was alTur'd\nby the Afpeds which any way concerned mej\nthat I was more conccrn'd about this Matter, than\nT there\n\f174 A S T S T E M\nthere was reafon for j that I fhould go home and '\nwait, till by the Signals he had given me, I might\n^udge for my felf, and till I heard from my Wife as\nbefore ; and that if I could make any plain Difco*\nvery, that there was real Guilt, I fliould come to\nhim again, and he would endeavour to point out\nthe Man. But if I could not, I fhould reft fatif-\nfy'd that I had been wrong inform'd of things in\nmy Family, and might make my felf eafy.\nJu. This is an odd Story, why this Man is only\na Cheat like all the reft 5 he bids you go home, and\nif you can find out any real Guilt, then come to\nhim and he will tell you what to doj that is to fay,\nhe knows nothing: Is this your Necromancer!\npray where does he dwell?\nCo. m. Nay, Mafter, the Man has done mc no\nwrong. I was directed to the Houfe, but I can't\nfind it again, if I was to be hang'd for miiling it j\nhowever I won't betray him neither, let him be\nwhat he will.\nAll. Well, but it feems you are not fully fatisfy'd\nyet, becaufe he docs not confirm your Notion that\nyour Wife is a Whore 3 I fancy you have a Mind it\nfliould be fo.\nCo. m. I don't care what ftic is, fo I could but\nfind it out.\nJu. But you fee, neither the honeft Man at\nNorthampton^ nor the Devil at Oundle^ would give\nyou any reafon to think fo. I would have you go\nhome, as the firft Man advis'd you, and be quiet. I\nverily believe there's nothing at all in it, but you\nhave been a cruel Husband, have us'd your Wife\nlike a Dog, and frighted her with worfe, and fhe\nis fled from you, as a poor naked defencelefs Sheep\nwould from a Lion or a Wolf.\nCo. m. And you would have me go home and fub-\nmit to my Wife ? no, I'll hang my felf firft.\n\fof M A G 1 C K. i7j\nAu. I don't fayfubmit to your Wifej the' if you\nhave wrong'd your Wife^ as I doubt you have, I\nfee no reafon why you fhould not make a Wife Sa-\ntisfadion for the Injury done her Charafter, as well\nas you would to a Man that was able to cudgel you\ninto it. But I fay go home, and mend your Wife's\nHusband, and that will in all probability mend your\nWife, and you may live comfortably again to-\ngether.\nCo, m. I can't promife, Mafter, to take any of their\nAdvices, or your's either.\nThis Story is not told fo much to give an Ac-\ncount of the Man, who was nothing as I could\nunderftand by it all, but a bafe paffionate Fellow to\nan honefl: Woman his Wifej but 'tis a kind of a\nHiftory of modern Magick, or of the Craft which\nis at this time in Pradice in the World. Nor is \\t\na lingular Example, for we have many more Peo-\nple among us, who are Pretenders to the fac^ed\nSciences, as they call them 9 who yet do not level their\nKnowledge of them to fuch mean Ufes, as to go\nMountebanking with them, to get a Crown or two\nfor petty Difcoveries, and fet up for what they call\ncunning Menj which is indeed the lowcfl Step of\nthis kind that a Spirit of the invifible World could\nwell be fuppos'd to take.\nIt is true, 'tis fomething hard to defcribe what\nthis thing we call Magick is, and how it is to be\nunderftood now 5 what it was formerly we know\nfomething of, and yet even then no great things were\nperform'd by it 5 fomething they did, whether by\nthe thing it felf as an Art, or by the Devil being\nprefent to aflift them, we kno>v notj that which\nwould be call'd wonderful is, that they did then, as\nthey pretend to do ftill, fcveral things which the Devil\nreally has no Power to doj and particularly that of\nforetelling things to come, which we do not, ge-\nnerally fpeaking, grant the Devil to have in his\nT 2. Power i\n\f^J6 A S Y S T E M\nPower 5 he can indeed make better Judgment\nof things than we can, but that the Knowledge of\nFuturity is given him, I deny.\nFor the Augurs and Southfayers, they did flrange\nthings formerly > by whofe Power, is not in my\nreach, nor any ones elfe to determine: For Exam-\nple j In the latter end of the \"Lx^to^ Auguftus defavj\nwhile the Ceremonies were performing in the Cam-\npus Martins^ the Emperor and a vaft Concourfe of\nPeople being prefent, an Eagle came into the\nPlace, and hover'd over the Emperor fome time,\nflying round and round him in the Air, and then\nflying towards a fmall Temple or Oratory, it fet-\ntled upon a little Pinacle, juft over the Statue of\nj!lgrippa.\nThis was taken as a Prefage or Omen to the\nEmperor, whether of Good or Evil was hard to\ndetermine i but the Jugurs being confulted, they\ndetermined it to be Evil, and that it betoken'd the\nDeath of the Emperor in a fhort time.\nAnother Accident happened the very next Day,\n\"fiz. a Flafli of Lightning broke upon the Statue\nof the Emperor, over the Senate- Houfe, and ftruck\nout the Letter C, from the Word Cafar^ in the\nInfcription upon the Capital of the Work over the\nStatue. ThtJugurs were again confulted, and they\nagain confulting with one another, and by the ordinary\nObfervations, declar'd the Emperor would dye\nwithin a hundred Days 5 fignify'd by the Numeral\nLetter C being flruck out, and that he fhould then\nbe reckon'd among the Gods, becaufe the Word\nM S A R in the Hetrurian Tongue figniiies a\nGod.\nNow ic fell out according to this Predi61:ion3 the\nEmperor, and \"Tiberius his Heir Apparent, went as far\nas Beneventum. he was taken Sick there of a Diarrhaa^\nand caufing himfclf to be carry 'd to Nola near\nCapuay he expired ninety nine Days after the Stroke\nof\n\fof MAGIC K. 277\nof the Thunder-Bolt or Lightning as above. If\nthen the Devil has no Knowledge of Futurity, hue\nthat the Study of the Inielledual World, or\nWorld of Spirits, be a facred Science^ as the Profef^\nfors of it contend 5 then thofe Augurs who a6led\nupon the foot of the ancient Magick, were illumi-\nnated from thofe Intelle6tual Beings, and had con-\nverfe with Spirits of a differing kind from thofe\nwhich we call Devils or Diabolical.\nNow, as 'tis hard, to diftinguifli thefe Illumina*\ntions, otherwife than by the Events and Con-\nfequences of the Intelligence they brings fo I\nthink, that if firft of all, the Diilinilion be allow'd\nbetween good and evil Spirits, ihcn 'tis a juft way\nof determining, viz. that fuch Intelligence as tends\nto the good of Mankind, to the Propagation of\nVirtue, and preferving Honour, C'halliry, Pro-\nperty and Religion, may be fuppo^'J to proceed\nfrom good Spirits, whether Angels or other Spirits\nunembodyedj on the contray, where the Corref-\npondence has a general Tendency to Mifchief, to\nencourage Crime, to the hurt of Mankind in gene-\nra], to difcourage Virtue and Religion, to infulc\nHeaven, and in a word, where the Tenour and\nBent of the Illumination is to do Evil, or to direcEl:\nto the doing it, there we may without Injury to\nPerfons, or to ihc Devil himfelf, fay it is from him,\nor by his Agency, and that he (the Devil} is prin-\ncipally concern'd in it J for we know ic is his Nature\nand particular Property to be propagating Evil, and\nthat he is apparently known to hate Mankind, and\nabhor, envy, and malign the Holy Nature of the\nEternal Being.\nIt may be a very juft Diftindion between the\nblefled eternal Being, and the curfed exil'd con-^\ndemn'd Species of Evil Angels, in a word, be**\ntween God and the Devil, to fay of them thus:\nT 5 God\n\fA S T S T E M\nG o D is the Perfection of Good.\nThe Devil is the Extreme of Corruption.'\nGod the Perfection of Purity and Holinefs.\nThe Devil a Compofiiion of the utmoft Im-\npurity.\nFrom thefe two Contraries derive all the execu-\ntive Power of Good and Evilj the Devil can no\nmore be the Genuine Parent of good Actions, than\nan evil Tree can bring forth good Fruity than\nDarkneis, which is a Privation of the glorious\nLight, can be aConfequence or Produftion of it.\nGod can no more be the Author of Evil, than\nhe can Annhilate himfelf, and Ceafe to bej and he\ncannot Ceafe to be, becaufe, he that Exifts from\nErernity is Eternal, and Exifts necefTarily, as well\nas from himfelf\nIf then the Intelligence given, or the Illumina-\ntions received by the Art which thefe Men pre-\ntend to, is found to have thefe eflential Qualifications\nof Goodnefs > 1^\/2;- Beneficent to Mankind, dire6ting\nMen to the prefervmg Virtue, Honour, Pro-\nperty and Piety 5 then I (hould be tempted to\nthink they have an Acquaintance with the Intelle-;\n6tual World, a Converfe with good Spirits, and a\nPrefcience communicated from the good Angels,\nthofc Guardians of Mankind, waking Centinels, fet to\nguard the World from Evil, and to counter-aft the\nMalice and Rage of Hell, but not elfe.\nHere then is a Teft of the Magicians Art, and let\nus not be amus'd and impos'd upon by the Preten-\nces to the facrcd Sciences, and to the ftudy of\nexalted Myfteries, Incantations Divine and Sub-\nlirne, and many other lofty Expreilions > fignificant\nin rhcmfclves, bur not fo in the cafe before us, un-\nlefs T' fti^y'd by the Virtue and juft Produdlions\nwhich appear in thc'r Praftice.

I think we mufl:\nbe referred back to the Augurs and Diviners among the\nmore honed Heathens 5 for we may almoft anfwer\nfor it, that nothing of this kind is feen among usj\nor at lead if it is found in Theory, and there is in\nNature a Reality of Art, fuch as I have men-\ntion'd above 5 that Magick is a Science laudable in\nits Study, juftifiable in its Practice, fublime in its\nAttainments it is yet fo blended with the wicked\nPart, by the Corruption of its ProfefTors, that we\nfcarcc know where to find one, either in Being or\nin Story, in the whole Chridian Time, whofe Pra-\ndice can be allowM to be facred, whatever can be\n(aid of the Science.\nIt is true, there was a famM Magician in Kent^\nwho pretended to this, and of whom I fhall fpeak\nat large in the next Chapters j and he feem'd to\na6t wholly upon the Principle of doing good, de-\ntefting, punifiiing, and expofing Crime: but I\nihall give my Exceptions to it when I come to his\nStory.\nAt prefent therefore the World are to he cxcus'd\nthe Midake, if they run into ic even with a kind\nof general Confent, taking the Word Magick\nand Magician in the word Senfe, underdanding\nthem all as praccifing the Diabolical Part of it, viz.\na Converfe with Evil Spirits, and a Dealing with\nthe Devil \\ inclufive alfo of all thofc feveral Clafi^es\ninto which I have didinguidi'd it before.\nHence perhaps it is, that in our Difcourfing with\neven the mod Learned Men upon this Subjcft, a\nfew, a very few excepted, it is very hard to bring\nthem to any Notions of a Difference between Ma-\ngick and Witchcraft, between a Magician and a\nT 4 Sorcerer,\n\fto A S Y S T E M\nSorcerer, between a Student in the exalted Scien^\nCCS, a Convtrfer with the Intelhdtual World, and\na Wretch that has a Familiar, a Wizzard or Nc-\ncromancerj but they will, tho' they may be wrong\nin It too, have them be reckonM all in a Clafs,\nthat they arc all Pra6titioners in the Diabolical\nPart, and in a word, that they all deal with the\nDevil. Indeed the Difference is not eafily prcceptible,\nbccaule of the Pretences which the worft of them\nmake to the high Illumination, when they are\nreally adVing the vileit Part, and that in the ordi^\nnary courfe of their Pradicej 'tis therefore by the\nConfequences only, that they are to be known.\nWitchcraft and Sorcery may in one Refped be\njuftly faiu to be all Magick \\ but I mud not allow\nthat all Magick is Witchcraft, as 1 diilinguifh'd\nbefore between a Witch and a Wizzard. But fee-\ning it is fo hard to know them afunder, and that\nthe Impofture is fo great, the bed Method I can\ntake is, where Hiftory or Converfarion will fupply\nMaterials, to give you as many Examples of the\nfeveral Pradtices and Praftifers in thefe lad Ages\nof the World as we can meet with, as w^U for\nyour Diverfion as Inftru^lion.\nI mud here enter a Caution too againd a weak,\nbut vulgar Midakc, which to the Reproach of hur\nman Underdanding the World has been very\nmuch poHefs'd with 5 and that i.*-, to afcribe every\ndifficult unaccountable Performance to ihc Art Ma-\ngick'^ and every fuperior Genius, every Man of a\nfublime Thought, and more than ordinary Capa-\ncity, to he a Magician. Archimedes was a mod ac-\ncompulh'd Genius, and an excellent Mathema-\ntician, but we will have him be a Magician too.\nFryar Bacon^ who by his Skill in the M^thema-\nticks, and the Dodiine of Motion, and of Sounds,\nmade a Brazen-Head to fpeak 5 of which by the\nway there are many Examples in Hidory, more\nancient\n\fef M A G I C K. xU\nancient than Father Bacon^ yet we will have this\nhoneft Friar be a Witch, a Magician^ a Conjiirfr,\nonly becaufe the thing was beyond the orairiiiry\nConception.\nMen of Thought and Head, who have a Genius\na little above their Neighbours, have on all Occi-\nfions been liable to be thus treated 5 even our Savi-\nour himfelf, when he afted fuch Wonders as the\nlike had not been feen, and caft out Devils j what\nfaid the amaz'd World ? The more weak and ad-\nmiring and innocent Thoughts were amaz'd, the\nText fays they were aftonifh'dj and at another\ntime they were fiird with Wonder, and the like\n5\nbut the felf-wife Heads, the pretending Pharifces,\nhaving neither Knowledge to reach the Divine\nPower by which he wrought, and too much Pride\nto fubmit to Faith, reproached him with dealing\nwith the Devil', He cafieth out Devils by Belzeebub\nthe Prince of Devils.

As to calling up evil Angels or evil Spi-\nrits, that is to fay Devils as it is to be done by\nthe Affiftance of the Devil^ and that he has given\nhis \\ffiftance to the doing it, and therefore can do\nit, I make no Queftion ; and therefore when the Ma-\ngicians do at any time bring up Appearances and\nfrightful Apparitions by their Art, I fhall always\nfuppofe it to be the Devilj that is to fay, the Devil\nraifed by Confent of the Devil-, the Devil coming\nup at their Call, who he had before confentcd fhould\nhave Leave to call him 3 for he muft come Volun-\ntier too, nor can he be called up or difturbed with-\nout his Confent; but he bargains with thofe wick-\ned People upon fuch Conditions as they agree be-\ntween them, that he ihall obfcquioufly attend\nwhenever they ufe fuch and fuch Methods to call\nhim, and this is Witchcraft, and this is .Magickj\nThis Magick is JVitchcraft^ and this M^itchcraft is\nMagick: let any one diftinguifti between them if\nthey can.\nCHAP.\n\f^84 A S r S T E M\nC H A P. ffl.\nOf the frefent Tretences of the Magicians\n:\nHow they defend themfelves ; and fome Ex^\nambles of their TraSiice,\nTHE Magicians, fuch as acknowledge them-\nfelves to be acquainted with the Black Art^ as\nwe call it, are not dumb and fpeechlefs in their own\nCafe 'y on the contrary, they defend themfelves with\nthe utmoft Artificer have their hiftorical Accounts\nof their Praftice, and give the moftfair and plaufible\nSketches of the Art jt felf that can be imagined.\nThey infift that it is a general Miftake, a vulgar\nError, and injurious to ail the Pra6tifers of this\nScience, to fay they have a Familiar, as we under-?\nfland the Word, that is, an evil Spirit, or that they\ndeal with the Devil -y they own they have Acceft\nto, and an Intercourfe with fupcriour Beings, and\nconverfe with the World of Spirits } but that they\nare the good and well-difpofed Spirits, who are al-\nways beneficent, kind, and ready to do all pof-\nfible Offices of Love to Mankind} that they are\ncertainly influenc'd from above, and that confe-\nquently it is fo far from being true, that they are\nDiabolick and wicked Spirits, that on the contrary\nthey are always employed in Matters fuperiour to\nthe Nature of the Infernal Spirits 5 that they do\nnot amufe the World with Fidtions, and deceive\nand abufe the People, that come to thom with their\nEnquiries > that they do not, like the Devil's Ora-\ncles of old, give ambiguous and doubtful Anfwers\nin the Cafes and Enquiries that are brought before\nthem, to cheat and delude the innocent En-\nquirer j but that they, on the contrary, tell them\nthe Truth of every thing, be it for Good or Evil\nto\n\fof MAG I C K.\nto them 5 that they often dcteft Criminals, expofe\nVice, prevent Mifchief, and promote Virtue j\nThings no body will pretend are in the Intent and\nMeaning of evil Spirits > that they do not impofe\nupon the ignorant to cheat and defraud them, or\nmake unju It Advantages of them.\nIndifcourfing many Years fince upon this Subjeft\nwith aparticular Friend, a judicious and learned\nMan, and one tliat was not eafily impofed upon,\nI fecmed to be doubtful oi the Reality of the thing\nin general, and whether there was indeed fuch a\nthing as that of Men having Intercourfe with the\nWorld of Spirits, and whether we might diflin-\nguifh between that and Witchcraft, infiiting that I\nthought it was all Witchcraft, Sorcery, and the\nDevil,\nHe told me he was of my Mind 'till fome Years\nbefore, that he had Occafion to converfe with the\nfamous Magician called Dr. Boreman in Kent^ who\nhe aflured me was a very grave judicious Man, and,\nas he believed, a good Man.

Well, faid he^\nif I tire you then with the length of it tell me, and\nI will leave off: So he began his Story thus:\n' I had, faid he^ a Friend, a young Man, who defired\n' me, upon an extraordinary OccaQon to go with\n* him (as he called it) to a Cunning Man.\n* I asked him^ What was the Bufinefs?\n' He faid^ It was Bufinefs of Confequence to him,\n* and tho' he did not care to tell it juit then, yet I\n' ihould know it afterward.\n\ftU A S T S T E M\n\u00ab Hold him^ I had no Faith at all in thofc fort\n< of People whom they called Cunning Men.\n\u2022 Nay, fays he^ I believe they deal with the De*\n* vil^ but I don't care for that, if I can but have Sa-\n* tisfaftion in what I go about.\n' I toldh'm^ I differ'd from him in that too, for\n* I neither believed that they dealt with the Devil^\n* or the Devil with them j or that they could fay\n' any thing to him that was to the Purpofe.\n' Why, they do tell ftrange things, fays he,\n' \/ told him^ I believed nothing of it} but that ic\n< was alia Cheats and fo I feem'd loth to have\n* him go to the Cunning Man at all.\niV. B. You muft underftand here, that my Friend\nwas not fo really doubtful as he made the\nyoung Man believe he was j but, as he had\ntold me before, he believ'd there was fomc-\nthing in it, but he could never come at the\nSpeech of one of the Pretenders to the Art,\nand fo was entirely ignorant of what they did,\nor how they proceeded, and therefore (as he\ntold me) he was mighty willing to go with\nhim, tho' he made fome Shew of being back-\nbackwards 5 fo he went on with his Dif-\ncourfe.\n\u00ab I was not only loth to let him go, fays my\n\u00ab Friend, but I told him I did not care for it, and\n* therefore defired he would excufe me going with\n\u00ab him 5 but when he told me who the cunning\n* Man was, and that he would go to the famous\n*\nDr. Boreman^ ray Curiofity prevail'd with mcj\n' not only not to perfwade him againft going, but\n* to refolve to'go with him my felf.\n* In a word, we appointed a Day, and I went\n* with him, for I had a great mind to talk with\n' the Do6lor.\n< When\n\fcf M A G I C K. 287\n* When wc came to the Houfe (it was in Kenf^\n^ not far from Maidftone^ where the Do6bor liv'd at\n' that time > I don't remember the Place exa6fcly)\n' but, I fay, when we came to the Place, a Ser-\n* vant came to the Door, and very civilly led us in-\n* to the Houfe, and bad us fit down j leaving us in\n' a large Hall, where we walk'd about, looking\n* on his Magical Pictures, of which we faw a great\n' many, whofe meaning I did not at all underftand,\n' and the Servant went away, as I fuppofc, to call\n' his Mafter.\n' After a while the Doftor came in with a Staff\n* in his Hand like a Crutch, as I thought > and I\n' thought alfo he was lame, having lately had the\n' Gout: He was a grave old Man, with a long\n' black Velvet Gown on, his Beard long, and the\n' upper Lip of it trimm'd into a kind of Mufchato^\n* a Cap on his Head with a Border of Hair within\n' ir, as was the Cuftom in thofe Days.\n' After ufual Civilities, he began to enquire our\n* Bufincfsj and direfting his Speech to me, as the\n' Senior in appearance, I told him, that young\n< Man (pointing to him that came with me) my\n\u00ab Friend, had fomething of Importance to commu-\n^ nicate to him, and which he wanted his Advice\n' in J and fo, fays he, I bid the young Man give the\n' Doftor an Account of his Bufinefs.\n' This young Man had, it feems, a particular\n* Cafe which he went to him about j andtho' he had\n' defired me to go with him, as I have faid, yet he\n' had not told me his Cafe j fo I was oblig'd to\n' dire\u00a3t him to tell it himfelf.\n' Then the Doctor defir'd the young Man to\n' give him his Cafe in writings but he told him, he\n* could not write v\/ell enough, or explain his Cafe\n' fo intelligibly to'him in writing.\n' Well then, fays the DoBor^ tell it me in Words\n* at length, and I'll write it down from your own\n^ Mouth:\n\fi88 A S Y S T E M\n' Mouth : However, I perfwaded him to write it\n'\ndown as well as he could j upon which, he dc-\n^\nfired a Pen, Ink and Paper, which the Do6i:or or-\n'\nder'd his iVlan to give him 5 and in the mean\n* time, the Do6tor ask'd me to walk into another\n* Room} come, fays he, we will leave him ro do\n* it, that we may not diilurb him. So we went iri-\n* to the next Room.\n' Then he began a Difcourfe, by asking me if I\n' knew anv thing of the young Man's Cafej which\n* I really did not, and therefore told him fo > but\n* if I had known it, I fhould hardly have given\n* him any <iccount, for I took that to be a\n* Piece ot his Art, to pick as much of the Circum-\n* ftance of the Cafe out privately as he could, fo to\n* guide his Anfwers \\ but I quite miftook the Man.\n* From that we fell into feveral other Difcourfes,\n* and among the reft, I asked the Do6tor, if it\n* would be no Offence to him to let us talk a lit-\n* tie about the Study of ihofe things which he was\n* fo fam'd for.\n' He faid. No not at all, if I was difpofed to talk\n* of rhcm in a ferious and friendly manner.\n' I told him, I hoped he did not think I had any\n* ill Defign, tho' a Stranger > if he did, I would\n' not defire to fay any more j and that as I did not\n' know what he might underftand by the Word\n* Friendly, I would not move it any farther.\n' He faid. He did not apprehend any thing dan-\n* gerous} for he ufed no unlawful Arts, but he\n'\nfaid feveral Perfons made a Jeft of thofe things\n* which he efteemed facred, and that he did not care\n* for thofe Difcourfes or thofe People who buf-\n* foon'd things becaufe they did not underftand\n* them.\n\u00ab I told him, that whatever I thought, he fhould\n* find I would neither treat him, or theSubje\u00a3t we\n* might difcourfe of, with any Difrefpe6t.\n^\n^ He\n\f\u00bb\/ MAGIC K. 28^\n^ He told me he would take my Word for It;\n^ fo we fell into feveral Difcourfes about Science in\n^ general, particularly of the Study of Magick and\n* the Pradice of it, and when firft it was known\n' in the World.\n* He told me, I feem'd Ignorant in the thing it\n' felf, and to what purpofe, fays he, ihould I go to\n' fpeak of the Original of a thing which you have\n* not right Notions of ? So we difcours'd a little\n' farther upon it, thus:\n' A. What Notions would you have me enter-\n^ tain of it? I fcarce know what you mean by the\n' thing itfelf\n' Dr. Why, Sir^ you feem neither to know what\n* I mean, or what you mean your {t\\^.\n* A. 'That is to fay^ I do not exprefs my felf per-\n' haps right; then you may fet me to rights, and\n* it would be very kind to do fo.\n' Dr. You fpeak of my pradifing as an Art -y now\n' I praftife no Art^ nor ufe any Art-y I am no\n' Juggler^ Sir; you don't fee me llicw Tricks.\n^ A. 1 wou'd not offend youj Sir; will you tell\n' me then what it is you do pra6tife.^\n' Dr. Neither will I be offended ; but if you\n*\u2022\nwill give me leave to ask you a previous Queflion\n' or two, i fhall be the better able to anfwcr your\n' other Queflion afterwards.\n* A. Any Queflion yoU pleafe.\n' Dr. Why then, will you tell me what brought\n' you hitherto me?\n' A. Why really, Sir, my Anfwer mufl be, I can-\n^ not well tells my Friend who is writing there in\n*\nthe other Room, will tell you that better than I.\n' Dr. Why then fhall I tell you what you corns\n'\nfor? perhaps you'll think that fomething odd.\n' A. So indeed 1 fliould, if I did not confidcr you\n'\nas a Mm of Art.\nU \u00ab Dr.\n\fijfo A S T S r E M\n' Dr, No, no, not a Man that deals with the\n* Devil^ as you fancy I do.\n' A. Nay, you muft deal with fomc body, if you\n* tell me my Bufinefs here, when I don't know it\n\u00ab my felf.\n' Dr. Why, I will tell you in few Words then 5\n* your Friend comes about Bufinefs, you to fatisfy\n' your Curiofity.\n' J. Upon my Word I think you arc in the\n* right.\n' Dr. Well, I have ufed nogreat matter of ART\n* you fee yet.\n' ji.

But is my Curiofity any Offence to you,\n* Dodor? if it is, I'll ha' done and fay no more, ,\n* but leave you and my Friend together, for I don't I\n* come to affront you, far from ic, I afTure you.\n' Dr. No, no, 'tis no Offence at all to me j on-\nly fince you feem to talk friendly and freely, give\nme leave to ask you fome Queflions firfl, and then\nI'll ftate yours for you, and anfwer them direftly,\nand I hope to your Satisfa6lion.\n* y\/. With all my Heart 3 ask mc what you 11\n* pleafe.\nDr. ' What did you fuppofe me to be, on\n* what did your Friend tell you I was, before you j\n* came ?\n' vf.

You know, Sir, 'tis natural for People to\nfay, a Man deals with the Devils when he tells\nPeople their Thoughts, foretells to them what\ncomes to pafs, and refolves fuch Doubts as no\nbody but the Devil could refolve.\n* Dr. And perhaps the Devil himfelf could not\n^ do thofe things if he was to appear and do his ut-\n* moft, for he knows no more of things to come\n' than you or I do, and perhaps not fo much.\n* A. Nay, diO not join me to your felF, pray^ for\n' you may know more than the Devil himfelf\n* can tell you.\n' Dr. Or elfe I would burn my Books, and pre-\n* tend no more to the ficred Sciences which 1\nhave fo much Veneration for, and which you call\nmy Pra^ice. -\n^ A. If I was fiire of that, lihould have another\nkind of Notion of you and your Practice than I\nhave yet, 1 afTure you.\n* Dr. If you was fure of what .^\n' A.

I don't know indeed as to thatj but we\n* underlland no other j when we talk of a familiar\n* Spirit we always underftand (by it) the Devil.\n' Dr. Then you mifunderftand it, Sir, that's\n' certain : unfufferable Ignorance ! why, ai'e there\n* no good Spirits ?\n* -^. I can fay nothing to that.\n* Dr. And perhaps are not defirous to be in-\n' formed.\n' A. Nay there you wrong me, and take me for\n* a Fool into the Bargain j for there are none but\n' Fools that have no Delight in underflanding 5 I\n' would be inform'd of every thing that I do not\n' know.\n' Dr. There would be no fuch things as Fools,\n* Sir, if they were willing to be inform'd.\nIf Fools could their own Ignorance difcern^\nihefd he no longer Fools^ becaufe they'd learn,\n* A. Well, I am very willing to learn, I aflure\n* you, and of you too, whatever you pleafe to in-\n* form me 3 perhaps I may be in the wrong as to\n' what you fay of good Spirits 5 but I never heard\n* of any.\n' Dr. That's ftrange indeed! you have been much\n* out of their Care, fure.\n^ A. \\ don't know that neither j I hope not.

I think you ought rather to be\n* offended, if I ask any thing that does not become\n*\nme : The firfl: Queftion I would ask you is, whe-\n* ther you think there is an invifible World.\n^ y^. That's no unfair Queftion at all j and you\n* fhall find. Sir, I won't cavil, I'll anfwer diredrly.\n^ I make no doubt but there is.\n' Dr. But let my Queftion be dire<9:too; by an\n* invifible World, I don't mean, as the Jfironomers\n'\nf^ll^P-i t^^^ there are Planetary Worlds, made in-\n* viiible only to us by their Diftance.\n' A. No, no, I do not take you foj I believe\n* there is a World of Spirits, and that 1 fuppofe is\n* what you mean by invifible 5 alfo that this World\n' youfpeakofis inhabited by Spirits only, and there-\n' fore juftly called invifible.\n' Dr. You are kind, nay generous in Argument,\n^ for you grant fafter than I ask.\n' ^. I do that to fave Circumlocutions, and giv-\n* ing you Trouble.\n' D. Well Sir, where do you fuppofe this World\n* of Spirits is? for there muft be a Locality for\n^ the dwelling even of Spirits j how elie do we\n' call it a World? and Heaven itfelf is a Place, ac-\n^ cording to the common underftanding ofthe Word.\n' A. It is hard to fiy where it is, at leaft 'tis hard\n^ to me \\ fo I cannot anfwer that Queftion, at leaft\n^ not dir^ly as I would do.\nU ^\n^Dr.\n1^1\n\f?P4 A SYSTEM\n* Dr. It is true, the infinite Spaces above are not\n* eafily defcribed, as they are not to be mathemati-\n^ cally lin'd outj but we have Reafon to know\n^ the Inhabitants of it are not very remote from us,\n* and that brings on another Queftion,\n^ A. \\ know fome People think the Regions of\n* the Air, even within the Compafs of the Atmo-\n* fphere, are full of Spirits, and that of divers kinds,\n* fome good, and forne evil,\n* Dr. I have nothing to fay to that Notion;\n* I can't allow they inhabit promifcuouily the\n* fame Regions, and dwell together 5 as good and bad\n* People live here among one another without Tii^\n< ftinftion.\n* A. I don't pretend to refolve that Queftion in*\n*\u2022\nDr. Neither did I propofe it, Sir; but my Que-\n' flion is thisj As you grant a World of Spirits,\n* and that you do not know where it is,} fo that for\n* ought you know it may be very near, as well as\n< very remote > nor to a Spirit is diftance of Place\n' any thing worth confidering, if I may fpeak my\n^ Opinion : But my Qtieftion, I fay, is this : Do\n< you believe that the Spirits inhabiting theinvifibic\n' World have any Converfe with us, or with oui?\n' embodied Spirits, in this World ?\n< A. Truly it is a nice Queftion, and what I\n* have often confidered very ferioufly } I am of\n^ Opinion there is a certain fecret Converfe of Spi-\n^ rits, tho' I cannot underftand any thing of the\n^ manner.\n* Dr, Well, Sir, your Conceptions arc much the\n^ fame with mine, only that you believe there is,\n^ and 1 am fure of it.\n' A. That's carrying it a great way > and I thinfc\n^ this brings me to turn the Tables, and to demand\nLeave to ask you fome Queftions in my turn, if\n^ you have done, or when you have done.\nDr.\n\fef M A G I C K. ipy\n* i)r. With all my Heart, Sir 5 pray ask what you\npleafc.\n' J. My firfl: Queftion will be. Sir, how you can\nfay you are fure there is fuch a Converfe with\nthe Spirits of the inviiible World?\n' Dr. Becaufe I have a6tually conversed with\nthem my felf.\n' A. Now you come to the Point indeed. But\nwhat then do you call Converfing?\n' Dr. Why, I call feeing them, fpeaking to\nthem, and hearing them fpeak, Converfmg i is noc\nthat as clear as the other?\n' ^. The Expreflion is clear, but the thing cx-\nprefs'd is not fo, at leaft not to m-e : How do you\nreconcile feeing, and fpeaking, to the thing call'd\nSpirits?\n' Dr. Why, therein you and I differ in our Cir- .\ncumftances, and this is the fublime Quality of the\nSciences which we profefsj that being under the\nOperation of a higher and exalted Mind, the Eyes\n'\nof the Soul, which is a Spirit, can operate upon\n^\nimmaterial Objefts, and fee what to common\n'\nSight is caird invifible.\n' ji. This is all myflcrious, and if you will allow\n'\nme the Freedom, we ihould call it all Cant and\n\u2022\nunintelligible.\n' Dr. I know it very well 3 and we on the other\n^ hand call your Difcourfe empty and infignificantj\n' for that you neither underftand what you fay,\n' nor fay what you might eafily be taught to un-\n' derftandj and if a Man enlightned in this fuperior\n' Manner comes to talk with you, and would in-\n'\n{lru<^ you a little, you prefently fly out, and cry\n' a Magician, a Conjurer, that he has a Familiar,\n* and deals with the Devil-y this was not always fo.\n' yi. This brings me to my firft Queltion Sir ex-\n' aftly, namely^ Whence is the- Orii^nalof what you\nU 4 ' call\n\fip6 A S T S T E M\n^ call your fublime PraOiice, and where and when\n' did it begin?\n' Dr. I could run you back. Sir, to its Original^\n' and give you theHiilory of it, but 'twould be too\n' long, I doubt your want of Patience.\n^ j^. My Curiofity is too great to let me wane\n' Patience.\n' Dr. Well, ril give you an Abridgement then\n' of it tbusy Before the Deluge^ when the Ante-\n^ diluveans had the Blefling of Longevity, to the\n*\"\nNumber, of alinoft: a thoudind Years, we have\n'\nmany Tcftimonies of their converfing, not only\n*\nwith the Spirits of the invifible World, but with\n'\nthe great Life of Spirit, the Being of Beings 5\n^ and if we can deduce any thing from Con-\n' fequences, divine Spirits daily illuminated the\n. ' Minds of Mankind, and convey 'd all ufeful\n' Science to them, and that to fuch a degree as\n* has never been attained to fince, by which all the\n^ moft exalted Parts of both natural and fuperna-\n^ tural Knowledge were convey'd into their Under-\n^ ftandings.\n' y^. They had, without queftion, a fuperior Ge-\n* nius in the Antediluvean State, far above what\n*\nwe have now, and your Notions of that kind are\n'\nvery clear to me, I agree with you in that.\n'\nZ)r. They had not fo much a fuperior Genius.\n* as they had a fuperior Illumination 3 what fhould\n^ you and I have, if we had livM three or four\n* hundred Years, and had convers'd all that while\n' ' in an angelick Society, and with an invifible Spe-\n' cics of Creatures, in whom cqmpleat Knowledge\n^ was but meer Nature, and who had the Good-\n^ nefs to be always communicating the moll perfe6b\n? Ideas, the moft fublime Images to our Thoughts ?\nf what fhould we be capable of?\n\fof M A Q I C K 197\n* A, Nay, I think you might fay, what fliould\n* we not be capable of.\n' Dr, Then confidering that at the end of that\n* three or four hundred Years we were but in the\n* Prime of our Age, in full Strength of Judg-\n* menr, and Vigour of Mind, capable to receive\n* the mofb divine Impreffions of facred Knowledge,\n* what fhould we not learn with fuch Teachers?\n' A. But how do we know that they were thus\n\u00ab blefs'd?\n* Br. Why, does not all your Accounts of thofe\n* Times bring in the People converfing thus? Nay,\n' do you not fay that God, or that Inconceivable\n' Something (which you call fo)the King, andGo-\n* vernor, and Maker of Spirits, convers'd among\n' them, talk'd with and to them ?\n' A. Yes, we believe God himfelf convers'd\n' with them, particularly with Adara the firft of\n' them, and with Noah the laft of them, and no\n' doubt with many others between.\n* Dr. Well, and did the great Being of Beings\n^ converfe with Man, and not the fmaller and lower\n* degrees of Spirit? do you think the Servants did\n' not converfe, if the Mafter did?\n' A. Why, that indeed 1 never confider'd be-\n^ fore, I confefs.\n' Z)r. But where elfe had they the Knowledge of\n^ fome things, which nothing but Spirit and fpiri-\n* tuous Converfe could poffibly convey ?\n' A, What things were they? I do not rightly\n' underftand you.\n' Dr. Why^ firft for Example, Musick, that\n* Heavenly Science, the Dodrine of Sounds ^ mea-\n' fur'd and divided fo as by Diflbnance to make\n' Harmony, to be admir'd by every Ear, to move\n' the Pailions, and agitate the Soul, to be read by\nf Notes, underftood by the differing Key of\nf Sounds, the only univerfal Charader in the\n' ^ ^ World.\n\fap8 A S Y S T E M\n* World. Could the Genius of Man invent it? Nor\n* it came from the invifible World, and was cer\u00ab\n* tainly communicated from the Fountain of Know-\n* ledge, by the Agency of the good Spirits, with\n* which they fo freely converfed.\n' A. You advance boldly, Dodbor.\n\u00ab Z)r. That may fairly be afTerted, which is im-\n' poffible to be otherwife.\n^ A,\\ won't venture to fay it is impoflible.\n* Dr, But I dare fay it, and with good Reafon >\n* then there is the Do6trine of N u m b e r s, which\n* we call vulgarly Arithmetick-y this with Muftck\n^ feem to be two Infinites, the Bounds of them\n* and the Variety is not to be meafur'd, or conceiv'd\n* of, and how could human Genius meafure them\n* out?\n' A, What do you inferr from thence?\n' Dr. Nothing but this ; that thofe good beneficent\n* Spirits, with whom Mankind had then the Blef-\n' fing of a daily Society, fill'd their Minds, and\n' infpir'd their Thoughts with thefe noble and ufe-\n' ful Difcoveries, and qualify'd them daily to im-\n* prove upon them.\n^ A. You talk above me now indeed.\n* Dr. You cannot fay but I talk plainly, and in-\n* tcUigible.\n' A. So you conclude, that the good Spirits in-\n* ftrufted them in thefe fublimer Parts of Know-\n* ledge? Pray, why did they not teach them A-\n\u00ab ftronomy, natural Philofophy, and all the ufeful\n* Branches of the Mathematicks ?\n' Dr. And kt no doubt they dy. There's the\n* Ark for Example i you fay, God fpoke to Noah^\n* and told him in general what kind of Vefiel ic\n* jfhould be J by which I fuppofe you may under-\n* Hand, God told him that the World ihould be\n' drownM, and that he fhould be fav'd in a Ship,.\n^ which he fhould build ? But can you think Noah\n' could\n\fof M A G I C K. ipj\ncould do all this without the more particular Dire-\nftion of thefe good and beneficent Spirits, inftru-\ndi'mg him how to perform the Work ? How the\nBeams, and the Timbers, the Planks and all\nthe Parts were to be put together 3 how the\nBottom was to be fhap'd for fwimming, the Head\nand the Stern for breaking off the Force of the\nWater, in that truly unbounded Ocean the\nFlood J\nall thefe things I make no Queftion he\nwas inftrufted in by the daily Afliftance of the\ngood Inhabitants of the invisible Regions, who\nfreely had at that time an Intercourfe with the\nembodyed, that is, imprifon'd. Spirits of Men;\nand thefe are the fame that we converfe with\nnow; fo that I have fairly brought it down to our\nown Times.\n' ji. Sir, your Difcourfe is very well laid toge-\nther I confefs; but you make a long leap, and\nfome of it in the dark too j from Noah^ and the\nYear of the World i\nf75, or thereabouts, to our\ntime, which is about three thoufand Years after.\nHow is it that thefe good Spirits left off their\nGood- will towards Men, and feem to fliun us as\nmuch now as they courted us before?\n^ Dr. I do not find itfo, I rather fay they do and\nwould converfe with us ftill, if we either faw the\nBleffing of it, or knew how to value it, and made\nit appear we defir'd it.\n' A. But when did it break off? what, did the\nFlood put an end to it ?\n' Dr. It feems, that Men, by a differing Con-\ndud, and a way of Life too grofs for fo excellent\nand fublime a Converfe, have render'd thcmfelves^\nunworthy and unqualify'd fince the Flood; fo that\nthe angelick Train feem to have forfaken thQ\nEarth, and only communicate themfelves to fuch\nas render themfelves acceptable and worthy by\na Life of earnell Application to the Study of di-\n* vine\n\foo A S Y S T E M\n^ vine Science, and who feck after the high Illu-\n^ mination.\n' ji. So that there are fome who enjoy this ex-\n* traordinary Society ftiil?\n'\nDr. Why not, pray ? The good Spirits are the\n' fame 5 they change not, neither is their Good-\n* will towards Men abated j but the cuftom of\n* the World has been, and flill is, to be fhy and a-\n^ fraid of them, taice them to be evil Spirits, and,\n' as the World calls them.

J09 j if it was\n* delufive and came from the Devil^ it was fo\n\u00ab much the more dangerous, as it came covered and\n* coloured with a Mid of Virtue, and a religious\n* Charader, and with a Mouth always full of a\n* lofty Cant, as if talking from a divine Oracle,\n* and dircded by Spirits always employed for the\n* Good of Mankind in general, and to do Afts of\n' Charity and Beneficence to afHifted or perplexed\n* Perfons in particular.\nThus far from my Friend who ccnverfcd with\nDr. Boreman : He gave me feveral other Accounts\nof him, which, notwithftanding all the good things\npretended to, and the fine canting Words of the\nDo6lor, convince me ftill that he mud have hacj\nfome unlawful Converfation with fuch Spirits or\nfuch Beings as I fhould flill call Devils : That he\nufed Spells, and Charms, and Familiars > that he did\nnot difown the Appearance of Spirits to him, af-\nfuming vifible Bodies, was, it feems, well known j\nand that he had feveral Books of Magical Expcri-\nments 1 have heard it alfo well atteftedj whether\nthere were any wicked Magical Performances in\nthofe Books, or not, 1 cannot tell.\nIt is true, or elfe general Report mud lye mofl\nunufually, that he did perform feveral flrange things j\nyet they fay he was never known to do, or dire6t the\ndoing any Mifchicf, or to encourage any injurious\nthing: It was ufual, as they report of him, to fct\nSpells for the Country People for the preferving\ntheir Cherry-Gardens from being plundered, and\ntheir Orchards from being robb'd : Take fome of\nthe Tales which pafs for creditable, as follows.\nThat\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 317\nThat three young Fellows being gotten into an\nOrchard, which I fuppofe was under his particu-\nlar Care, he caufed a large Bell to hang to the\nHeel of their Shoes behind, like a Hcel-fpur, by\nwhich they alarm'd the Houfe and raifed the Peo-\nple, who furrounding the Orchard, took them all 5\nwhen they were taken, the Bells being to be puU'd\noff, could not be feen, and yet the Sound of them\nwas heard all the Way they went to the Juftice\nof the Peace, till he committed them, and then\nceafed.\nAnother time, fome Boys being gotten into a\nCherry-Garden, and [one of them being up a\nCherry-Tree, he made the Boy fee a great Maflif\nDog fitting at the bottom of the Tree, waiting\nfor his coming, looking him full in the Face, and\ngrinning and fnarling at him if he ofFer'd to ftir j\nfo that the poor Boy not daring to come down,\nwas oblig'd to fit in the Tree 'till he cry'd out\nfor Help 5 by which means, the People of the\nHoufe came and found him in the Tree 5 and\nas foon as they were come, he could fee no more\nof the Dog, neither could any body fee it but\nhimfelf.\nThe Methods he took with lewd People of thofc\nTimes, were, it fcems, exceeding many, and fuch\nthat, as the Landlord told my Friend, the young\nWenches Hood in awe of him, and were terrified\nwith the very Name of him.\nNo petty Thefts but he would difcover them,\neven after they were committed 3 and if we may\nbelieve common Fame, if People's Cattle were gone\naftray, he would tell them which Way to look for\nthem. Whether he could ha' told Saul how to find\nhis Father's AfTes, I cannot fay ; But I dare affirm\nhe could not have told him of the Kingdom, as\nSamuel did.\nAnd\n\f5i8 A S r S T E M\nAnd yet this Dr. Boreman^ as they fay, would not\nfufFer any fuch thing as a Witch to live in the\nCountry, but cxpofed and dete6i:ed them on all oc-\ncafionsj and the wicked Spirits on allj occafions\nfled from him, as was reported of the Houfe which\nthey faid was haunted.\nHow to reconcile this to a Correfpondence of\nDevils only, I cannot fay 5 and yet that Magick Powers\nare communicated by good Angels, and by divine Ap-\npointment, I can fee no Reafon to fuggeftj but the\ncontrary fcems to be evident by the People of\nEphefus^ coming and bringing their conjuring Books,\nand burning them, upon receiving the Chriftian\nFaith by the preaching of the ApoftleP^^\/, to the\nValue of fifty thoufand Pieces of Silver.\nThere are abundance of Books upon this Subje\u00a3k\nlefc by this Dr. Boreman-y and fome, as they fay^ with\nRules of Art, as they are called j but they are kept fo\nup in private Hands, that I do not find they are to be\ncome at, by any means. The Works of the right\nfamous Enthufiaft Jacob Behemen fecm to be of the\nfame kind, tho' fomething more refin'd, and lefs ra-\ntional, being all in the Clouds and Confufion.\nThis Jacob Behemen took it very ill to be called\na Magician -, but he was a kind of a Vifionift. He\npretended to fee things invifible, and hear things\nunutterable i and I might add, he feemed to have\nfome Truth in it, for he publillied things unintelli-\ngible.\nHis Writings are either Magick or Enthufiaflick,\nor rather both, for I never met with many that\nwould pretend to underftand them, and never with\none that was the better for them 3 except it was\none very particular Man among his Admirers, who\ndeclared himfelf to be the better for them, only,\nand for that very Reafon, namely^ becaufe he did\nnot underftand them.\nNow\n\f\u20ac M A G I C K. 319\nNow that I may not fecm to pafs my Cenfure\nraflily, I defire that my more intelligent Readers\nwill pleafe to reduce the following things into\nMeaning, if they can, and favour us with the In-\nterpretation J being fome particular Account of the\nLife of this famous, religious Ingineer, for I know\nnot what elfe to call him, and the Titles of fome\nof his Books.\n* By the Differences and Controverfies in Rc-\n* ligion which he knew not how to fatisfy him-\n' felf in, he was ftir'd up and moved to ask^ feek\n* and knocks that he might know the ^ruth.\n* Upon which by the Divine Drawing and\n' IVill he was in Spirit wrapt up into the Holy\n^ Sabbath^ in which he remained feven whole\n' Days by his own Confeffion in higheft Joy: Af-\n' ter he came to himfelf, he laid afide the Folly\n^ of Youth, and was driven by divine Zeal ear-\n' neftly to reprehend impudent^ fcandalous^ and\n' hlafphemous Speeches, and did forbear in all his\n' Adions the lead Appearance of Evil, and con-\n' tinued to get his Living by the Labour of his\n* Hands, 'till the Beginning of the Sixth Seculum^\n* which was the Year 1600, when he was the\n' fecond time pofTefs'd with a Divine Light^ and\n* by the Sight of a fudden ObjeEl was brought to\n' the inward Ground or Center of the hidden Na-\n' ture. O\n' Yet fomewhat doubting, he went out into\n* an open Field, and there beheld the miracu-\n' lous Works of the Creator in the Signatures and\n' Figures of all created things manifeflly laid open;\n' whereupon he was taken with an exceeding\n* Joy, yet held his Peace^ in Silence praijing GOD.\n' But ten Years after, in the Year 1610, thro^\n* the over-Jhadowing of the holy Spirit, he was\n' a third time touched by GOD^ and renewed,\n' and\n\f310 J SYSTEM\n' and became fo enlightened, that lead fo great\n* Grace beftowed upon him fhould flip out of\n' his Memory, and he refill his God, he wrote\n' privately for himfelf (without the Help of any\n* Books but the holy Scriptures) many Books,\n' fuch as thefe\n:\n' A Book of the Signature of all things.\n' A Confolatory Book ofthe Four Complexions,\n' A Miflermm magnum upon Genefis.\n' A Book of 177 Theofophick Queilions.\n* Certain Letters to divers Perfons at certain\n* times, with certain Keys for fome hidden\n* Words.\nThefe learned Labours of this right learned En-\nthufiaft may, for ought I know, be ftill extant >\nthey are recommended here for their extraordinary\nTitles, and I believe are much about as intelligible\nas the above Rhapfody of his Lifej to all which\n1 recommend the curious Reader, if he has a mind\nto embarrafs his Underftanding for an Age or two,\nand come out as wife as he went in. The Speci-\nmen I think to be much of a Piece with the good\nDr. Boreman^ only with this fpecifick Difference,\nwiz. that Friend Jacob carries us up into the Clouds\nto underftand things there, if any body there may\nbe found to teach us 5 and Dr. Boreman was for\nbringing the Clouds d\u00ab)wn to us, to teach us what\nwc could underftand nothing of, when we were\ntaught.\nThus you have the two invifible and unintelligi-\nble Brothers together 5 whether they have left any\nto carry on the unmeaning Magick, I know not.\nThere have been fome Pretenders to the Art who\nhave fucceeded the Dodor, but we fee nothing of\ntheir Performance, at leaft not equal to his : Let\nus look a little higher.\nC H A P,\n\fof M A G I C K 1%\nC H A P. IV.\nOf the T)o5irine of Spirits as it is under-^\nfood by the Magicians ; How far it may be\nfufpofed there may be a7i Intercourfe with\nSuperior Beings^ without any Familiarity\nwith the Devil, or evil Spirits ; with <$\nTranftion to the prefent Times.\nWHEN the fevcn Sons of Scava the Jew\npretended to Exorcifm, and to caft the\nDevil out of a poflefs'd Perfon, the Devil taking it\nin fcorn to be affronted by meer Pretenders, and\ndifdaining thofe that had no Authority to make\nufe of the Names which he was fubje6ted to the\nTerror of, flew upon them, as the ^ext fays^ in a\n'R.'SigQ^Jefus I know, 2nd Paul I know, fays he, buc\nwho are ye? and he never left them till they fled\naway from him naked and wounded.\nNow in what Name or by what Authority\nDr. Boreman or any of thefe Magicians difmifled\nthe Devil from haunted Houfes, chafed away Spi-\nrits from the Places where they had made any Ap-\npearance, and kept the Devil in fuch Awe as is re-\nported, I cannot yet learn. Had the Dodor really\ncaft the Devil out of any Dcmoniack or poflefs'd\nPerfon, and openly have exercifed fuch an abfolute\nPower over him, and had it been well vouched\nby Perfons of known Integrity and found Judgment,\n\"we muft then have believ'd that there were forac\ngood Spirits, fome fupcrior intelligent Beings,\nwhom the Doftor was fo favoured by, that know-\ning his good Intentions, they would affift him with,\ntheir Aid againft the evil Spirits.\nY But\n\f32i A S Y S r E M\nBut there are innumerable Difficulties in the\nWay s the Words of our Saviour are cxprefs, that\nthis Kind goeth not out hut by Prayer and Faflings\nand I do not read much of the Do6tor being a Per-\nfon fo pious and fo religious as to exercife himfelf\nthat way at all 5 what he might do in private I\nknow not, but by all I can learn, he afted as by\nthe immediate Deputation of thofe good Spirits > in-\ntimating, that they brought him Intelligence, that\nthey acquainted him with the Circum fiances of\nevery enquiring Perfon \\ that they direfted him\nwhat Anfwcrs to give 5 that he was bur, as it\nwere, their Mcflengcr to evil Spirits, ordering\nthem to remove from fuch and fuch Places j that\nthey empower'd him by fpeaking fuch and fuch\nWords, to charm and bind down fuch People as\nhe was direfted to operate upon, to fuch a Limit,\nand within fuch a Circle of Ground.\nBut all this is ftill attended with this Doubt, 'viz.\nThat the Fa6t is not proved ^ let us fee therefore\nwhat it is likely thefe good Spirits can do 5 and\nwhat they really arc believ'd to do in any Part of\nthe World, for the general Good of Mankind.\nThat there are fome Appearances in the World,\nand that of fuch Spirits as we may call Good, I\nwill not deny here, whether I grant it at prefent\ncr no. The People in Norway tell you of a good\nSpirit which at all times gives People Notice of\nthings fatal and deftru6iivei that it appears in a\nflying Ball of a ytllowifh green > and is feen in the\nAir, and will knock at their Doors before approach-\ning Ttmpefts and deep Snows, that they may fave\ntheir Fiihing-Boats by hauling them up upon the\nShores, or into narrow fafe Creeks where they will\nreceive no Damage, and that on Shore they may\nbring home their Cattle and fecure them from thofe\ndeep Snows and fevere Colds,\nIn\n\fof M A G 1 C K.\nin Laponia we are told of feveral Spirits which\nthey converfe with, not by way of Witchcraft and\nSorcery, but which they call their good Spirits, and\nwhom they confult with upon every urgent Occa-\nfion for Relief and Ailiftancc, and who never do\nany Hurt to them or to their Cattle. What the\nLapland Witches may do I know not, neither is ic\nmy prefent Inquiry.\nWhether thefe good Spirits are not thofe, who\nat the Requeft of fome certain People on all the\nCoafts of Norway^ are faid to procure fair Winds\nfor Ships going to Sea, I will not undertake to\nfay 5 But this I have upon llrift Enquiry learnt.\nFirft^ That it really is fo in Fa6t 3 that upon go-\ning to certain People there, and upon paying them\na fmall Confideration (not above two Dollars) they\nhave been aflured of a fair Wind, exadly at fuch a\nTime, from fuch a certain Point of the Compafs,\nand to laft fo many Hours as has been agreed for.\nSecondly^ That this has been agreed for when the\nWinds have been, as the Seamen call it, fet in to\nMow Trade from a direcbly contrary Point, and for a\nconfiderable time before 5 and that when they have\ngone away and declined the Agreement, they have\nlain a long time without a fair Wind, till com-\nplying j and again, that upon fo complying they\nhave never failed.\n'thirdly^ That if you offer to defire, or give Mo-\nney to them to raife a high Wind, that is, a Storm,\nthey will be very angry, refufe your Money with\nDifdain, and ask you in their Language, if you\nthink they deal with the Devil? that their Power\ncomes from a good Spirit, that never does any Hurt\nin the World, but always does things kind and\ngood, and for the Benefit of Mankind.\nAll our Accounts, Hiftories and Relations con-\ncerning the Northern Fares of Britain are full of\nthe Appearance of Spirits to the Inhabitants on\nY z fundry\n\f314 A s r s r E M\nfundry Occafions, and yet none of thofe Spirits arc\nhurtful to them, or join in any hurtful things.\nEither thefe Spirits inhabit in the Regions of the\nAir, and fo are near us and take Cognizance of our\nPerfons and Affairs, or they do not: if they do not,\nwhat do they appear for? if they take cognizance\nof us and of our Affairs, and yet do None Hurt,\nthen they are not Devils tho' Spirits, for the Devil\nwould certainly do the utmofl Mifchief he could j\non the contrary, thofe Spirits do eminent good Ser-\nvices on fundry Occafions to Mankind 5 they muft\ntherefore be fuppofed at leaft to be good and bene-\nficent Beings, inhabiting fomewhere in the vaflEx-\npanfe of Space which we call the Habitation of Spi-\nrits, or the invifible World.\nAnd this leads us by the Hand to that hitherto\nunintelligible thing called the Second-fight > that is\nto fay, that thofe good Spirits make themfelves\nvifible to fome particular Perfons, and reprefent to\nthem the Form or Shadow of this or that Perfon\nthat they have a mind to have feen^ and even thofe\nPerfons are reprefented not to do them Hurt, but\noftentimes to warn of approaching Mifchief, Death\nor Danger.\nTo what purpofe fhould the Devil, who is never\nguilty of doing Good, except with defign of Evil,\nI fay to what purpofe ihould he foretell Evils a-\nwaiting this or that Man, who cares not what Evil\nmay or can befall him? to reprefent to him things\nin Ef^gie, which fhallyet come to pafsin Reality? to\ngive him warnings of Evils in time, that he may\navoid it? This is not like the Devil, who is always\nfeeking Man's DeftruiStion. For Example:\nThe Second-fighted Highlander fees a young\nLady with three Gentlemen ftanding at her right\nHand, intimating that they fhould every one of\nthem in their Turn, be her Husband 5 and, however\nunlikely, this comes to pafs : He fees the like\nnuni'\n\fof M A G I C K. 3ZJ\nnumber of Women {landing on the left hand of a\nMan, and he is direded by this to know they fliall\nall be his Wives > the very Faces and Habits of\nthem are defcribed, and that fo as to have them\nknown J and this, tho' Teeming at firft ridiculous,\ncomes to pafs. A Second-fight Man travelling on\nthe Road, fees a Man on Horfeback at a great di-\nfiance coming towards him 5 a great River being\nbetween them 5 He fays to his Friend that was\nwith him, Ride forward to the River Bank and yon\nmay chance fave the Man's Life^ for he will pafs the\nF$rd^ hut will he driven away hy the Water^ and\nyou may chance afjifi him to get out.\nThe Man to whom it was (aid, gallop'd up to\nthe River's Brink and calls to the Man on the\nother Side, bidding him not come forward, for the\nRiver at the Ford was newly rifen, and the Water\nor the Current would be too flrong for his Horfe,\nadding that he would be in Danger: \/ know the\nFord^ fays he, hetter than you^ mind your own Affairs^\nand with that comes on and enters the River, and\nwas accordingly driven away with the Current,\nand in great Danger 5 but the Man fent to wara\nhim was fo careful, that running on the other fide\nof the River, he had an Opportunity to throw a\nRope to him, which at lafl he took hold of, and\nwith great Difficulty is drawn to the Shore: and\nin that manner his Life was faved.\nNow, tho' it is true, that the Intelligence\nwhich this Man gave, was the faving the Man's\nLife, yet they will have it, that this Man dealt\nwith the Devil: How elfe, fay they, fhould this\nMan know that the other Man, a Stranger to\nhim, fiiould be in Danger ? But I anfwer, that\nthe Devil has no Knowledge of Futurity, and\ntherefore this could not be the 2)m\/, or from the\nDeviL\nY 3 Be-\n\f3i(J A S Y S r E M\nBefides, v\/hy fhould the Devil tell the Man, and\nwarn him of the Danger of paffing the River?\n-would he not much rather that the Man Ihould\nhave been drown'd, and as many more as he could ?\n'Tis evident that in Witchcrafts and familiar\nSpirits, where the Dentil afts by the Agency of the\nWitch or Wizard, they are always fam'd for doing\nMifchief, prompting to all manner of Evil, torment-\ning the particular People they are empowered to\na<5t upon j murthering others, deftroying Cattle,\nfetting Fire to Houfes, Ships, Stacks of Corn or\nHay 3 and in a word every thing hurtful, and every\nthing hateful.\nThere is fome Reafon therefore certainly to di-\nilinguifh between thofe Spirits who arc kind, and\ncareful, and afliftant to Mankind, and thofe that\nare mifchievous, deftruftivc, and declare themfelves\nEnemies to the common Good : The Laft are evi-\ndently of Hell, the very Nature of the Devil ap-\npears in all their Aflions,' and in the Ends and Aims\nof all the Emiflaries they employ. What contrary\nJudgment is to be made from contrary Effe\u00a3ts, re-\nmains to be confider'd.\nThey both ad:, at leaft we underftand them to\na\u00a3t, by the Afliftance of fome invifible Spirit j or, as\nit may be more properly exprefled, the invifible\nSpirits a6t in them and by them.\nAs to Witchcraft and PofTeflion, that I think is\nplain, and needs no Difcourfe upon it> 'tis known\nto be all from an evil Spirit, or in plain Englifh,\nfrom the Devil: There is no Room to difpute itj\nthe Wretches employed acknowledge it, and the\nHellifh things they do difcover it j fo we need\nfay no more of that, nor is it the Bufinefs be-\nfore me.\nBut who is it that afts thefe other forts of Peo-\nple? what Spirits inform them? what fecret Power\nppens their Eyes, to fee things hid from the reft of\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 3 xr\nMankind ? I meet with many that have examined\ninto this Matter of the Second-fight, and who have\ndifcourfed with the People who are, what ihall I\ncall it ?

Our Saviour in his glorified State af-\nter his Refurre\u00a3lion was feen and converfed with\nin the opened and freefl manner imaginable by the\ntwo Difciples going to Emausj and yet they knew\nnot who it was} and as foon as they knew him he\nbecame invifible to them again.\nNow, fuppofe one of thefe invifible Inhabitants\ndefigns to make itfelt vifible, either to difcover\nfuch or fuch an Evil at hand, to particular Men, or\nto warn this or that Perfon of Mifchief attending\nanother 5 fo that he may immediately go and pre-\nvent it : Can we think it difficult for that Spirit\nto make itfelf vifible to this or that particular Man,\nand not to another ? I think there is nothing flrange\nat all in it.\nA Second-fighted Man going towards a Gentle-\nman's Houfe inBradalhin^ fees the Gentleman, towards\nwhofe Houfe he was going, riding on the Road\nwith a neighbouring Gentleman, whom he alfo\nknew, attended with three Servants on Foot and\none on Horfeback, fix in all 5 then he fuddenly kcs\na Troop of Highland Robbers, forty or fifty in\nNumber, rufhing out of a Wood or fome other\nPlace where they lay in Ambufh, who furrounded\nthe Gentlemen, difmounted and robb'd them,\nwounded the firll Gentleman in the Arm, and killed\none of the Servants.\nThe Man going forward to the Gentleman's\nHoufe, juft in the Court or Entry before his Houfe\nfees the Gentleman, with the other Gentleman his\nFriend, mounting his Horfe to ride abroad, and the\nServants attending, juft three in Number, befides\nthe Gentleman's Steward on Horfeback.\nHe\n\fof M A G I C K. 319\nHe immediately fpeaking to one of the Servants,\nenquires which way their Mafter was travelling 5\nthey anfwer him, that he is going to Innerlochyy\nupon fuch and fuch Bufinefs. Which Way does\nthe Laird intend to take? fays the Man. Such a\nGat^ fays the Servant. I befeech his Honour, fays\nthe Man, that he go not by that Gat^ (that is to fay,\nby that Road) for if he does, he will fall into bad\nHands.\nThe Servant tells his Mafter, and he calls the\nStranger, and asks him what he meant by telling\nhim (o. Sir, fays he, I tell it for good, if your\nHonour pleafc to hearken to it . For if you go by\nthat Gat^ (^mentioning the Road which his Servanc\nhad nam'd) you will fall in with the Robbers, wh3\nhaunt thofe Hills, and will be overpower'd and\nmifchiev'd.\nWhat, fays the other Gentleman that was to\ngo with him, mocking at the fecond-fighted Man,\nare ye one of thofe Fool- Bodies (a Scots Expreflion)\nthat they call Seers? ha' ye been feeing a Vi-\nfion this Morning? Pr'ythee, how many were they,\nand what did they fay to you ?\nAn your Honour will gang, fays the Man,\ngang your wa: But you will remember what I\nhave told you, when ye find it true.\nThe firft Gentleman anfvver'd, Were they a\nTroop, fay you? Yes, and't pleafe your Honour,\nfays the Man.\nWell, well, fays the Gentleman, I fhall go an\na Troop of Devils were in the Way. So the Man\nwas flouted on all Hands, and went his way back j\nthe two Gentlemen went on, as they faid they\nwould, and were attack'd and robb*d 5 one Servanc\nkilPd, and one of the Gentlemen had his Arm\nbroke with a Piftol-Bullet, and was brought back\nthe fame Day to his own Houfe.\nWhat\n\f330 A S Y S T E M\nWhat Spirit it mufl: be, that could thus form an\nAppearance of things that would come to pafs, that\nwe cannot determine 5 but fuppofing this Story to\nbe true in Fadt, as many fuch have been, this had\ncertainly one Token of a good Spirit in it 5 namely,\nthat it gave the Gentleman fair Warning to fhun the\nDanger that awaited him, and as it were, fent an\nExprefs to him from the invifible World, which if\nhe had not defpifed, he might have efcaped, and a-\nvoidcd the Danger.\nNow, had this been the Benjil^ if I have any\nNotion of the Devil^ and of his Nature, as well\nas Defigns, his Part would rather have been to have\nfent an Agent of his to the Troop of Robbers his\nFriends, to give them Notice, thai fuch a Gentle-\nman, and fuch another with him, was coming up-\non the Way, and that in fuch a Place they fhould\nbe fure to meet and furprize them. He would have\nbeen fo far from warning the Gentlemen of their\nDanger, that he would have run them into it with\nall the Artifice he was Mafter of5 and I will not\nfay that he did not prompt the two Gentlemen a-\nbove, to fcofFand flout at the poor fecond-fighted\nMan, and make a Jeft of his Intelligence, as you\nliave heard 5 that fo they might go on, and Hill into\nthe Danger they were warned againft, rather than go\nanother Way, and avoid it.\nSome of thefe informing Spirts think fit to\nappear themfelves to thefe fecond-fighted Peo*\npie, and not to others; and if the Author of\nthe Defcription of the Weftern Iflands of Scot^\nland may be credited, v\/ho alfo names not the\nCircumitances only, but the Perfons, they have\nnot only abundance of thefe fecond-fighted People\nthere, but they have abundance of things difcover'd\nto them in this Manner, and efpecially upon the ap-\nproaching Death or Difaftcrs of any Perfon or Fa-\nmily. It is true, the Examples he brings are moft\nof\n\fof M A G I C K, 331\nof them trifling, but we have many Relations in\nthat Country generally received for Truth, which\nare confiderable j and divers Examples are to be\nhad, which are new, and without Precedent 5\nnothing is more frequent among them than that of\nForetelling the Death of any Perfon, fome Exam-\nples of which I can give of my own Knowledge.\nI was at a Gentleman's Houfe in this Town, near\nSt. James's, and he happened to have fome Friends\ninvited to his Houfe that Day upon an Entertain-\nment, the Occafion of which I do not jufl: now\nremember. Among the Guefts at his Table was an\nancient Gentlewoman, and her Daughter a fine beau-\ntiful young Lady, and was I think to be marry'd\nthe next Week, or within a very few Days: There\nfat oppoflte to her another Lady, of what Coun-\ntry I do not remember, but fhe was a Foreigner,\nand I think was a Dutch Woman, but appear'd as\na Perfon of good Figure.\nThis Foreigner it feems came to the Gentleman's\nHoufe, not as invited to the Entertainment, but\nupon fome Bufinefs of Confequence; Dinner being\njuft ready he ask'd her to flay, and told her they\nwould difpatch their Bufinefs afterwards, and fo led\nher in among the Ladies.\nAfter Dinner, the Gentleman and this Foreign\nLady withdrew to difpatch their Affair, which was\nfomething relating to the Exchequer^ where he had\nan Employe and in Difcourfe, fhe faid to him, Pray\nMr. who is that elderly Lady that fat op-\npoflte to me? fo he told her the Lady's Nam? j and\nthat young charming Lady is her Daughter, 1 fup.-\npofe? fiiys fhe. Yes, fays the Gentleman Poor Lady,,\nfays Jhe^ I am very forry for her, for that her Daugh-\nter is a mofl beautiful Creature indeed, and I fee\nfhe is very fond of her, 'tis a fad thing! What d'ye\nmean? fays the Gentleman. Why, lays fhe, the\nyoung Lady won't live above a Foitniglit, and the\npoor\n\f33^ A S Y S T E M\npoor Lady her Mother will almoft break her\nHeart for her : I am very forry.\nThe Gentleman (who told me Story with his\nown Mouth) wasextreamly furpris'datwhatftie faid,\nand would fain have underflood it as if fhe jefted\nwith him > but (he affirm'd it ferioufly, and fliew'd\nfo much Concern at it, that he could not carry it\noff for a Jeft 5 then he ask'd her how fhe knew it?\nI fee it upon her, fays ihe, I wifli I could fhow it\nyou, I tell you fhe is a dead Woman, all the\nWorld can't fave her, for her Hour is come, ask mc\nno more Queflions. My Friend told me the Story\nimmediately i the Concern about it had almoft\nfrighted him, and the Event anfwer'd it allj in a-\nbout three Days the young Lady was taken very\nill, which turn'd to a Vomiting, and that to a\nFever, and fhe dy'd on the very fourteenth Day\nafterward.\nAnother time walking in a Friend's Garden near\nLondon^ there was a young Gentlewoman walking in\nthe next Garden, and there being but a low Wall\nbetween, and a Mount on that Side where we\nwere, we could fee her walking with her Father\non one fide of her, and a Sifter on the other > faid\none Gentleman that was with me, Who is the mid-\ndlemofl Perfon of thofe three ? we told him fhe was\nthe Gentleman's Daughter who walk'd by her.\nHas fhe been fick ? faid he. Now it was true, that\nthe Lady had been very ill, and was come into the\nCountry for Air, and we told him how it was.\nWell, fays he, the Air won't recover her, for fhe\nwill dye within a very few Days. I earneflly prefs'd\nhim to tell us how he knew it; he anfwer'd am-\nbiguoufly a good while, but as I prefs'd him with\ngreat Importunity, he told me ferioufly : Said he,\nyou cannot fee it as I do, I wifh I could not fee\nthings fo as I do, but her Face now at this Inflant\ni$ to me exa6rly what you call a Death's Head-,\nthat\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 335\nthat is, the Skeleton of a Head or Scull, and no\nother.\nThe thing was right, and the young Woman\ndied within a Week after.\nBut to return to the Subje6l: : As thefe Spirits wc\nmay fuppofe can make any Reprefentations of things\nvifible, and that to whom they pleafe, fo it may be\nfuppofed they can make themfelves vifible alfo,\nwhen, and to whom they pleafe 5 and this is at-\ntefted by many WitnefTes, and evidenced by feve-\nral differing Circum(lances, of which I have by En-\nquiry met with a great many in my time.\nIn the Highlands and Iflands, they tell you of a\nSpirit, which the poor ignorant Country People\ncall Browny^ or Bronne^ as it feems was the more an-\ncient Name they gave it, as the Norwegians have\nanother, whom they call Bielke.\nMuch Pains has been taken to examine who this\nBrowny is, and whether he is a good Spirit or a\nbadj but mod of the Stories I meet with are fo\nfabulous, or trifling, or ridiculous, that I rather\ntake the Appearance to be imaginary than real;\nIf it be real, it muft be fome low-priz'd Spirit,\nemployed among the meaneft of People, and on the\nmeaneft Occafions, fcarcc worth naming, and yet\nmoft of them rather for evil than good.\nIt is worth obferving, that where thefe frequent\nAppearances are, and thefe fecond-fightcd Fifioniftsy\nwe rarely hear of any Pavv^-wawing or Conjuring,\nno Black-Art-Men, very little Magick. I fancy ic\nfeems rather, that what Bufinefs thefe invifible A-\ngents have to do, and what Intercourfe they carry\non with this World, they generally do it them-\nfelves, they are not manag'd by Art, or calPd in to\nthe Aid and Afliftance of the Artifls. But as they\nmake things vifible at Pleafure, they want no A-\ngents, they do their own Bufinefs their own way 5\nand in a word, they have no Magicians among them,\nnone\n\f334 A S r S T E M\nnone of thofe they call Cunning Men, or that con\u00ab\nfult with the invifible World in behalf of others;\nit fcems they have no Occafion of fuch Men, they\nare not fo fiinciful, or over-run with Vapours, as\nwe are in this Part of the World.\nYet they have fome Remains of Sorcery among\nthem too, and particularly they are flrangely ad-\ndi6lcd to Charms. In the Ifles of Orkney they ufe\na Charm to flop Bleeding, and they tell you it is\nas effe6lual as the ftrongell Stiptick, be the Bleed-\ning outward by a Wound, or inward by any break-\ning the VcfTcls, Wrench or Strain, or by Diftem-\nperj and for this they have particular People, whom\nthey call Charmers. What Part of the Black Art or\nMagick thefe Charmers pra6tife, I know not, but\nit fecms they perform it at a Diftance, and without\nfeeing or knowing the Perfons j only the Perfon\nwho is in Diftrefs by Bleeding, fends his Name to\nthe Charmer, and he fends the good Spirit he talks\nof, and (as the Magicians fay) converfcs with, and the\nBleeding is ftopt ni a Moment. This the Charmer,\nas they call him does, by repeating the Name of\nthe Perfon affli6led, to which he always adds\nfome barbarous unintelligible Language of his\nown-, upon repeating which he fends the Meflen-\nger away, and the Cure is perfeded. Now this is\nmuch the fame with the Magick of other Pra6li-\nfcrs j for this they tell you is the Charmer's fpeaking\nto the good Spirit he converfes v;ich, who imme-\ndiately flyes invifible to the poor diftrefs'd Patient,\nand works the Cure.\nThefe Charms are alfo of feveral Kinds, and for\nfevcral Purpofcs^ fome to cure humane Bodies,\nfome to cure Cattle, fome to quiet great Dog^ and\nprevent their falling upon People as they go along,\nand fome perhaps to prevent their Barking when a\nThief may attempt the Houfe; that Part I fup-\npofe they won't call the Work of a good Spirit.\nThey\n\fof M A G I C K. 335\nThey have fuch a Variety of thofe things in other\nParts, as well as in our own Country, and efpeci-\nally in Ireland^ in Norway^ and in fome Parts oF\nGermanyy that it would be needlefs to give an Ac-'\ncount oF them, and a little out of the way too in\nfuch a Work as this.\nBut I muftcome a little nearer home. ThefeArts\nare ufed more on this fide the World, as the ren-\ndring darker things vifible, feems to be more the\ncafe on that fide 5 and as I am enquiring rather\nwhat our Magicians pradlife without the Devil,\nthan what the Devil or any other Spirit pra6tifes\nwithout the Magician ^y I come to bring all thefe\nthings down to your immediate Underflanding.\nWe have been diving into Myfteries long e-\nnough, and been ferious till perhaps you are tir'dj\nfor a little grave doings wearies us at this time of\nday > let us fee if the Subje6t will afford us any\nDiverfion. The Age is witty beyond mcafure, and\nnot a little wicked too> but whence is it that we\nhave no Magick in our Wit? It is not many Years\nago, fince the fprightly Part of human Wit re-\nlifh'd with Mankind, and Men were bright by mcer\nJnfpiration> the good Spirits, if fuch there are,\ndidated things of Value to the Minds of Men, they\nconvers'd in the very Confines of the myflerious\nWorld, but without Raptures and Agitations;\nthey had the Sublime without the Infernal, the\nHumid without the Horrid j they had the Fire\nwithout the Brimftone; they could laugh without\nBaudy, and jeft without Blafphcmyj talk without\nBuffoonry, and vote without Bribery j write with-\nout Pedantry, and read without Party.\nBut now, blefs us all ! how ftrangely is the\nCourfe of things chang'd> what with good Spirits\nand bad Spirits, we do every thing without Spirit y we\nare all Magick, and no Witchcraft, the Z)m\/ with-\nout the Devil f wc laugh without a Jefl, and jeft\nwith-\n\f33<? A S r S T E M\nwithout Wit; we write without Senfc, and read\nwithout Tafte; we are lewd beyond Whoredom,\nand devout beyond Religion; we preach without\nDoftrine, are religious without Principles; pray\nwithout Doxology, and worfhip without a God.\nNow, how fnall we do to find out the Magick\nof all this ? 'tis certainly brought about by fomc\nllrangc Fafcination, fome Devilifme that we feel,\nand don't fee. Here mufl be fome Intercourfe be-\ntween us and the invifible World, tho' I doubt 'tis\nfome of the darker Part of it. Every Man feems to\nme to have his Daemon of a particular kind, pro-\nper and feparate to himfelf, by which he [cither go-\nverns himfelf, or is governed, I know not well\nwhich to call it ; and fo he walks on in his own\nway, follows no body, and leads no body; but is\na Principle, a Dodrine, a Governor, nay a God to\nhimfelf.\nFormerly the Broachers of Errors, and particular\nNotions, had always their Difciples and Followers;\nand they judged pretty much of the goodnefs or\nbadnefs of the Dodtrine, whether Religious, Philo-\nfophic or Moral, by the Number and Quality of\nthe Followers they had; even the Jews did thus\nof our Saviour, Have any of the Elders or of the\nRulers believed on him ?\nBut now, God fave us! fo many Men, fo many\nMaggots, 'Tot Homines^ Tot Di...s; every Man\nbroaches his own Opinions, preaches them to him-\nfelf, is his own Convert; his Soul is the Difciple\nof his Fancy, and his Senfes the Pulpit of his Hu-\nmour ; as for other People, as he teaches no body,\nfo he fcorns to be taught by any body, and bids\nGod da... him, if he had not rather go to the\nDevilj than not go to Heaven his own way.\nThus we live in a general Difguife, and like the\nMafquerades, every Man drefTes himfelf up in a par-\nticular Habitj not two appear a-Iike in the whole\nPlace J\n\f'of M A G I C K. 117\nPlace; and that the Simily may be perfed, the\nHumour carries it on to the minutefl Part; as the\nHabits are not alike, fo they are always particularly\nremarkable for being diredtly oppolitc to the Per-\nfon they cover > the Phlegmatic drefles a Jo, San^\nguine^ the Sober mimicks the Drunkard, theChafle\nchufes to dre(s a la Courtifane^ the Atheifl puts on\nthe Religieufe^ the Chriftian has the Veft and\nthe Turban, and the Quaker a Habit from the\nTheatre.\nIn the Appearance of the fuperior Part it is\nmuch the fame : Mimickry, and oppofitc Capacities\nengrofs Converfation ; the Beau turns Polemic, the\nAiheift difputes Principles, the A\u00a3l:refs praftifes\nModefty, and the Pedant panegyricks upon Wit:\nFools write Satyr, as Clowns teach Manner.<;; the\nFops are the Men of Weight; and fince, by Acci-\ndent, Wit and Senfe appeared under the Title of\nthe Tattlers, the eternal Clang of Tea-Table\nTattle has rung the Changes upon Scandal, and\nfct up for the univerfal Cenfors of Converfation.\nAnd need we go any farther now for our Enqui-\nries after Magick? could things take fuch a Turn as\nthis, without a general Converfe with the World\nof Spirits? will any Man tell me this could happen\nby the Nature of things, or even by the Things of\nNature? No, no: invilible Operations are afted\nfrom an invilible World; the Magicians are in the\nright, all the great things they do could never be\ndone without an Intercourfe with a fuperior Rank\nof Beings, be they Infernal, or what other Devils\nyou pleafe to call 'em.\nTake a few bright Doings for Examples. Upon\nwhat foot does the bright Lord lit every Morning\nover his Chocolate, talking upon all the Works of\nthe Learned, himfclf Unlearned to a Scandal? And\nhow good-natur'd and well-manner'd is the Age,\nthat no body laughs at him till he is gone, or for-\nZ bears\n\f35? A SYSTEM\nbears it afterwards? How wife are his Remarks!\nhow juft his Refle\u00a3tions! when he talks fo much,\nand underftands fo little, that it may be truly faid,\nno wife Man talks like him.

The Effeds which were attributed to thefe\n' Figures are altogether marvellous j 'tis faid, for\n' Example, that the Figure of a Lion ingraven on\n^ Gold, while the Sun is in Leo^ preferves thofe\n* from the Stone that carry this Talifman about\n' them> and that that ofa Scorpion made under the\n* Sign Scorpio^ fecures from the Wounds of that\n' Animal.

The Inhabitants of the Ifland of Samo-\nthracia made 7'alijmans with Gold Rings, which\nhad fron fet in them inftead of Precious Stones :\nPetronius fpeaks of ir, when he fays, that l^rimaU\ndo carried a Gold Ring fet with Stars of Iron.\nThe Gods, which they caird the Gods of Samo-\nthracia^ were thofe that prefided over the Science\nof the Tali\/mans^ which is confirmed by the In-\nfcriptions of thofc three Alcars whcveo^ lertullian\nfpeaks.

The\nMgyptians^ from whom the greateft Part of other\nPeople have learned the Secret of thofe Rings,\nhad alfo other 'falifmans for all Parts of the Body.\nAnd perhaps 'tis for this that we find fo many\nlittle Figures of Gods^ Men and Animals^ in the\nancient Tombs of this C'ountry, The mofl an-\ncient Kaufmans are made upon Plants, Branches\nof Trees, or Roots. Jofephus fpeaks of them in\nthe eighth Book of his Anriquitie?, and attributes\nthe Invention of them to Solomon.

We will\nnot fpend time to fhew the Vanity of the 'Tailf-\nTnans^ for we live in an Age that is not much ad-\ndided to fuch Superilitions.\nBut thefe things went but a little way, com-\npared to what followed J for now the Pagan Wor-\nship declining, the World began to fee with o-\nther Eyes j the Devil loft Ground every where,\nand the Chriftian Religion fpread it felf infenfibly,\nand in a furprifing manner, efpecially over all the\nEaftcrn and Northern Parts, as into \/Ifia^ and into\nGermany and France j and now it behoved the Z)m\/\nto take new Meafures alfo.\nNor was he at all at a Lofs, for he knew his\nMethod prefently, and that was to put on the\nFace of Religion, rank in with the fanftifyed Part\nof the People, to wit^ the Clergy, and draw them\ninto his Scheme, as he had done the Pagan Priefts\nbefore.\nUpon this he took up the Tonfure, fhaved him-\nfelf for a Monk, or a Monkey, which you pleafe,\ndrefs'd himfelf up in the Habit, put on the facred\nVcftments, and got prefently into Orders. The Popes\nquickly fell in with him: Pope Sylvefter Il\/gavehim\nInftitution and Indadion, and from this time for-\nward he quitted the Aftrologick, and fet up aa\nEcclefiaftic Magick in the World : The Succefs\nhas\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 35\nhas been wonderful, beyond even his own Expe\u00a3ta-\ntionj for it miift be confefledjwhen the Priefts firfl\nbegan a Correfpondence with him, they out-flript\nhim in their Speed, for they run even before they\nwere fent. St. Francis and St. Ignatius out-did all\nthe Arts of infernal Magick that ever wer$ Known,\nor in ufe in the World, and with his Affiftance did\nmore to eftablifh a Race of Inchanters and Church\nMagicians in the World, than the Devil himfelf could\nhave expc6bed.\nThis ferved his Intereft effeftually on one Side\nof the World, that is to fay, for Europe efpecially,\nand all the Weftern World : And Confucius drew\nout another Plan of Ecclefiaftick or rather Philo-\nfophick Magick for him in China and Japan. But\nhe was ftill at a Lofs for all the reft of Jfia and\njifrica^ which we might then call the middle Part\nof the World 5 and which at that time was ripe\nfor any kinds of Enthufiafm or Church Magick,\nlet it be almoft what it would.\nSatan^ who always fees his Opportunity, and has\nno want of Vigilance to lay hold of it, faw the\nOccafi^^n, but could not readily find out a Handle.-\nHe could not prefently think of a Method, 'till at\nlength the indjjftrious Devil found out the Contri-\nvance of fetting up the Unity againft the Trinity,\nthe Houfe of IjJomael againft the Houfe of Ifaac^ the\nRace of the Bond-woman againft the Race of the\nFree- woman 3 the Circumcifion againft the Bap-\ntifmj and the Magick o^ Mahomefs Pidgeon to mi-\nmick the Chriftran Dove.\nHaving thus fertled the Scheme, he found out a\nTool fit for his Purpofe> a fierce ignorant Arabian^\nbold, fubtle, cruel, and mercilefs> to Men infolenr,\nand audacious to Heaven j who by this meer Ma-\ngick of Enrhufiafm, backed by the Sword and\nSpear, fet up the boldeft, the grofleft, and the moft-\nfenfelefs of all Impoftures that ever was in the\nWorld 3\n\f3y A s r s r E M\nWorld 5 and which yet at this Time, and for above\na thoufand Years pad, has ftrangely triumph'd over\nthe Chriftian World, has fpread itfelf over Jfia and\njifrica^ from the utmoft Iflands of India Eaft, to\nthe utmoil Corner o\u00a3 Africa to the Weftj and it was,\n'till within a few Years paft, Mailer of a fourth\nPart of Europe befides.\nSuch is the Force of Ecclefiaflic Magick, and how\nfar it is gone befides this to break into the Eccle-\nfiaftic Affairs of the Chriftian World, is not hard\nto defcribe, tho' it would take up too much Room,\nefpeciaily at the Clofe of this Work, to enquire\ninto the Particulars.\nWhat a continued Series of Ecclefiaftic Magick\nhas been afted among the Romifh Clergy, and in\nthe whole Papal Hierarchy!

What Sums of Money would the\nHeathen Priefts have raifed if their Gods had took\nBribes as ours do, and Pardons for Sin, and Licenfe\nto fin, had been to be bought and fold at the\nChurch Doors, as it is with us?\nBut thefe are merry Times, and the Church Ma-\ngick out-does all the Conjurings of the Antients,\nas much as Madam Violante out-does a common\nStage-Tumbler, or as an Hofpital thorough-bred\nSurgeon does a Mountebank Tooth-drawer.\nAs to our religious Magick, the Enthufiafms\nand Herefies that reign among us, I think we muft\ndeal with them juft as their Maker feems to have\ndone, let them alone, give them up to their own\nMagick, and to their own Delufions, to believe\nthe Lies of their own making. For as thofe holy\nCheats are the eafieft to be difcovcr'd, they are the\nhardeft to be cur'd, becaufc they are generally fup-\nported from this invifible World of Spirits, tllcfe\nmighty good fuperior Beings, that is to fay, the\nD,evll^ with whom the Fathers of thefe religious\nFrauds have fo intimate Acquaintance, that the Mif-\nchiefs they fpreadj and the Confufions which they\nbring every Day into all our religious Eftablifh-\nmenr, are too deep roored for all the Skill and Ap-\nplication of the more i^ligious World to cure.\nBut I muft obferve one thing here, which is\nnecefiary to your Illumination, and tho' it fhould\nbring me back and draw me in again to th\u00ab\nSin of Gravity, which the Town hates 5\nyet ven-\nturing the general Difpleafure, I fay 'tis nece\/Tary\nto take Notice here, that thefe religious Effluvia\nof Hell, which at prefent rtiake fuch Confufion of\nPrinciples among us, are fo demonftrably embrac'd\nby the prefent M^gi^ the Sages, the Converfers\nr with\n\fof M A G I C K. 3JJ\nwith good Spirits, the Roftcrucians^ and Maders\nof the Occulc Sciences, and all the other Preten-\nders to Supernaturals, and fecret Illuminations > that\nthey leave us no more room to doubt but they are all\nNatives of the fame Climate, bred up in the fame\nCountry, carrying on the fame Intereft, and will\n{hare at laft in the fame Deflru6l:ion ; when the\nTares and the Wheat fhall be skilfully and criti-\ncally feparated, as we are well afllir'd they will be.\nThis indeed flands fair againft all the modern\nTeachers of the Roficrucian Whimfies, and the\nDodrine of Spirits, viz. that None of them apply-\nto the Eftablifhment of true Religion. On the\ncontrary, they eftablifh, or ftrive to eftablifh, old\nErrors, and continually broach new 5 they preach\nanother Dodrine, and their Notions, were they\nnot expos'd by their own Extravagancies, and En-\nthufiaftic Brains, would expofe themfelves, being a\nkind of religious Ramble, a confus'd and a con-\nfounding Heap of Nonfenfe : The poor People\nwould otherwife be in Danger of being wheedled\ninto their Delufions, but this unravels all their dark\nSchemes, and tends to {how us the Cheat of all the\nrefl, and to convince us that 'tis all a Black Art,\nall a Diabolick, a meer Emanation of Hell.\nThus all their Magick deteds and expofes it felf,\nall the high and bluilring Bombafl of Sacred, Di-\nvine, Excellent, and fuch like, difcover whence\nthey come J the Pretences to Illuminations, Com-\nmunication, or Intercourfe with Spirits, and an invi-\nfible World, appear to be Pretences, and no morej\nTheir Dreams oiSerial Subftances and Spirituous Bo-\ndies, the Inhabitants ofthe Elements,the refin'd incor-\nporeal EfTences > their Abflrads of Quinreflence, and\na thoufand more which they put upon the World j\n1 fay, they all fmell of the Fire and Brim (lone, are\nborn of Hell, their inviflble World is evidently to\nbe underltood the Infernal World, and their Study of\nA a ^ the\n\f35^ A s r s r E M\nthe Sacred Sciences, is neither more or lefs, tofpeak\nin the common Diale\u00a3b, than deahng with the\nDevil y there it begins, and there it muft and will\nend.\nWhat elfe means their Philofophick Cant of\nmingling the fupeinatural Eflences, their confound-\ning the Terms of Religion and things Divine,\nwith the Dreams and the Jargon of their unfigni-\nfying Language? loofing the Name of God, De^\nvil^ Heaven, Hell^ in the Cant of their Trade,\nand the laboured Expreflions of facred Flame, men-\ntal Fire, immortal Spirit, Pcrfedion, Corruption,\nilluminating Genius, and a vaft Throng of\nWords, tending to amufe the Foolifh, and diltra6t\nthe Wife J tending to deftroy Religion and all the\nfolid Eflablifhment of Heaven, whether for the Fe-\nlicity of the Juil, or Punifhment of the Wicked ?\nHad their Magick any Tokens of a truly Divine\nInftirution, of a heavenly Original, and was this de-\nmonftrated by its confirming, and conforming to the\nPrinciples of either Natural or Reveal'd Religion,\nfomething might befaid for it 5 or was its Tendency\nto eftabliih, not bewilder the Underflanding, and\nto fix the Knowledge of the true God in the Minds\nof Men ^ was it qualify'd to eftabliih our Faith in\ndivine Illuminations, and trulv todircft our Worihip\nand Homage to Him, encoLraguig at the fame time\npeace, Juftice, Humility, and every Chriftian Virtue\n5\nWere this the Cafe, we ihould not difpute with\nthem the Converfe of Spirits between us and the\ninvifible World, the Spirits uncas'd and fled from\nhence, with the Spirits yet embodyed, by an invifible\nand inconcer Hblc Communication. But leave it as\nit is, a Matter indifferent to us at prefent, till it\ncomes to be underftood better when we arrive\nthere.\nCHAP.\n\fof MAGIC K.\nCHAP. V.\nOf the Magick of the prefent Time^ as it\nftands Jirifd in the laji Chapter, from all\nthe Tretences of the Magicians, and the \"De-\nlufons of Hell ; of what Length it has\ngone^ or is like to go^ in deluding Mankind%\nwhat the Magicians can do^ and that they\nreally have now no Converfe with the Devil\nat all: So that the Art being at an Endy\nthe Hijiory comes to an End of courje.\nHAVING, in the lad Chapter, brought down\nthis Idol call'd Magick to its true Original,\nflrip'd it of all the MaiqucraJe DreHes, jelteJ a\nlittle about it, and at lall laid the Baftard at the\nDevil's Door, who is the true Father of it 5 One\nwould think ib Bare-fac'd an Impofture fhould be\nable to appear no longer in the World, that ic\nwould be hifs'd off the Stage, and that the very Boys\nand Girls would throw Stones and Dirt at it in the\nStreet.\nBut the Cafe is quite otherwife, and in fpight of\nContradi6tion the Devil goes on his own wayj if\nthis or that Nation, or Country, or People drop\nhim, and refufe him, he goes to another j like a\ntrue Pedlar, if he is anfwer'd No at one Door, he\nknocks at the next. If he fells Counterfeits, and is\ncaird Cheating Knave at one Houfe, he calls him-\nfelf honeft Man at another. The Devil is never\nbaulk'd, but carries on his Game, in fpight of all\nthe Repulfes he meets with, nay in fpite of Heaven\ni : fclf.\nBefides, he is never at a lo^s for Difguifes, and\nlike a Lady at the Ball, if fhe happens to have been\nknown in her Mafqucrade Habit Ycfierday, to-\nA a 3\nmorrow\n\f33 8 A s r s r E M\nmorrow flie gets another that iliall be a more per-\nfed Difguife. If he happens to be blown here, he\nis conceard there. If he is difcover'd and known\nfor a Devil to-day, you ftiall miilake him again,\nand take him for a Saint or Magician of another\nkind to-morrow.\nNay, and after all, even where he is known to\nbe the Devil^ and finds he cannot be difguis'd any\nlonger 5 yet he has his ways with him, to win and\npleafe you, and draw you in, at lead to bear with\nhim, feeing he does you no harm. Thus, do you\nnot fee the Crowd about the Puppet-Show, and do\nthey not laugh, and halloo, and appear infinitely\npleas'd with the grofleft and fimpleft of all Cheats j\nand that tho' they know them to be Cheats and\nDelufions, and that they are but meer Puppets?\nSo our Magicians^ tho' you know them to be\nCheats, tho' you know that notwithftanding all\ntheir Pretences, they really deal with the Devil^\nyet we have People among us that would be con-\ntent, and deal with them upon that very Score. I\nwant to know, fays the jealous-headed Country-\nman, who has made me a Cuckold, and don't tell\nme of the Cunning Man going to the Devil for In-\nformation. Why, I'd go to the Devil my felf, if\nI knew where he was, rather than not find it out.\nNay, tho' you convince them, that even in the\nworft of it all, the Fellow is not fo wicked as they\nthink he is, or as he makes of himfelf, that he\nknows nothing of the Devil any more than they\ndo, but only cheats them, and perfwades them to\nbelieve he knows fomething, when indeed he\nknows nothing of the matter, yet ftill they will\ngo to himj Such an old Woman, or fuch a young\nFool, told 'em, that they had been with the Cun-\nning Man, and they will go too 5 nor is it poffible\nto perfwade them againft it, till they have thrown\ntheir ^^%;ney away, and come back aiham'd.\nSo\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 359\nSo that the Delufion ftill goes on. A young Girl\nhas two Sweet-hearts, and fhe goes to the Cun-\nning Man to know which of thofe two fliall\nhave her. A young Fellow has loft his Mlilrefs,\nand muft know who Courts her. Another has loft\na C0W5 and away he goes to the Cunning Man\nto know who has ftole her. The crafty Sh er,\nlike the De^viFs Oracles of old, gives doubrful An-\nfwers, fatisfies no Body, and yet pleafes every Body.\nHe fends the Girl home with an old Wife's\nTalej bids her lay two Sticks a-crofs under her\nPillow, and the firft {he dreams on will be the\nMan. The poor Girl's Head runs upon the Affair\nof a Husband, 'tis no wonder ihe fhould dream of\none of them, and it may be the right, as well\nthe wrong, fo that 'tis an even Lay. But the Con-\njurer is right j and to be once right, fecures him the\nCuftom of all the young People in the Country 5\nwhereas, if he is out, that's forgotten, and docs '\nhim no Harm.\nThis is the Devil's low-priz'd Game, and he\ncarries it on a great way 5 and as the Mountebank\noftentimes gees more Money than a licenfed Fhy-\nfician, and the Quack than the Dodorj fo the\nDevil gets more Clients than the Counfellor, and\nhis Agents have as much Pradice as the Lawyers,\nand perhaps upon as honeft a foot too as fome of\nthem.\nI fliould enquire a little here, and expofe the\nweak Doings of thofe Cunning Men, and how\nthey delude the poor People > but 'tis of no great\nUfe. For as 'tis one of the (impleft things of its\nkind in the World, and by which the poor Peo-\nple are the moft impos'd upon, yet 'tis perhaps\none of the laft Delufions in the World that they\nwill be cur'd ofj nor can all the Cunning Men of\na higher Kind in the whole World reafon them out\nof it. They will leave the Surgeon for the Moun-\nA a 4 tebank.\n\f3(Jo A S r S T E M\ntebank, the Phyfician for the Quack, the Parfon\nfor the Conjurer, and God for the Devil, A few\nihort Tales upon this Part may perhaps illuftrate\nthe Speculation, and fhow you the Force of Fraud,\ntho' I doubt it will not do much towards a Cure.\nA Magician giving out his Bills, and boafting of\nhis mighty Perfomances, went down in the way of\nhis Calling, as other Tradefmen do, to Briftol Fair,\nand there he did Wonders, told Fortunes, calcu-\nlated Nativities, look'd in the Girls Hands, peep'd\nin their Eyes, talk'd broad things to them to make\nthem bluih > and then guefTing from their Colour\nhow things flood with them, and by a thoufand\ncrofs Queftions, firfl crept into their Cafes, and\nthen told them for a mighty Difcovery, what they\nhad difcover'd to him with their own foolilh\nTongues that very Minute.\nAmong the reft of the young Lafles that came\nto him with their Grievances, there comes one\nwith that laudable Queftionj if in Love^ whether\nJ fiaJl marry the Man or no?

So away comes George and leaves him,\nand fets up a Run, as if he was bound to be back\nagain with the utmod Expedition.\nWhen Gecrge had got av\/ay and was out of fight,\nhealter'd himfelf, as he knew very well how to do\nby his Skill in Podures and Tumbling, which, as\nbefore^ was a Part of his Trade > and having a linnen\nHabit in his ereat Pocket, dxQ^QS himfelf up in the\nHabit\n\fof M A G I C K. 3<?p\nHabit of a Ghoftor an Apparition, not in a Slirowd\nlike a dead Body, but all in white, down to the Feet,\nand a Woman's Head-drefs upon his Head 5 and\nin this Poflure he places himfelf where he knew\n\"Thomas would come. But before this, covering his\nHabit with his great Coat, he plac'd himfelf at the\nVillage in fight of the Door where Thomas went in,\nthat he might be fure to know v\/hen he came our,\nand which Way he went, left he ihould take fome\nother Way 5 and alfo to know who and how many\nhe got to come with him.\nHe foon found Thomas on his Way, for he came\nout of the Houfe and two Fellows with him in\nabout an Hour : So George foliow'd 'em at a di-\nHance, 'till he faw them in a little Lane leading\ninto the Common as before, and when he knew they\ncould go no other Way 5 upon which, he run by\nanother Way over the Fields, and got into the\nCommon before them.\nl^he firft thing he did was to get into a little\nThicket, where lying flat on the Ground, and out\nof Sight, he lay and hifs'd like a Serpen: molt\nfrightfully \\ This had its immediate EfFe6t, for ic\nfrighted them all, and he heard one of them fay. It\nwas the Devil^ and that he was come for Thomas to\nbe fure : and the other faid fo too, adding that he\nwould go no further 5 this was enough for George^\nfor by this he knew they were no Champions that\nThomas had brought along with him \\ fo removing and\ngettirjg to another Place a little behind them, that\nthey might not run back again, there he chang'd\nhis Note, and then growPd like a great Dog, and\nthar frighted them again. Now having made this\nBeginning, he leaves oiF a little, and goes into the\nCommon, and ftands in the middle of the Road\njuft where the Lane open d into the Heath j fo than\nhe might be fure to be feen all in white, a little be-\nfore they came out of the Lane.\nB b The\n\f370 A S Y S r E M\nThe Night was not very dark, but no Moon-\nlight 3 feme Stars, not many, were feen j when co-\nming to the Lane's end, they faw the Speftre, and\nno fooner faw it, but all three run away and cry'd\nout mod terribly. George had now his End, for he\ndidn't defire to carry it on any farther 5 fo he kept\nhis Pofl 'till he found by their l^ife they crofs'd\nthe Common farther off and out or Sight; then he\nput off his Habit, and made the bell of his Way\nto their Lodging; where when 'fhomas came, he\nfound George very fedately ftanding at the Door\nfmoaking his Pipe.\nHe bad Thomas well- come Home, but faid no\nmore, not taking the leaft notice of any thing; but\nfound that Thomas went immediately up Stairs, and\nthrew himfelf down upon the Bed; and the next\nMorning Thomas was very fick.\nGeorge in the mean time went home to his Ma-\niler, and gave him an Account of the whole Tranf-\naftion, who finding his Engines work to his Mind,\ngave George farther Inftru61:ions ; which were in (hort,\nto haunt the poor Fellow Night and Day, and give\nhim no Quiet, 'till he had manag'd him up to a\nNeceflity of coming to him (the Doctor) for Help,\nwhich was not long firft.\n1 fhould have obferved that the Doftor or Cun-\nning Man finding he fhould compafs his Ends upon\nThomasy^cnlno'^^oY the poor Girl, and told her, that\nhe had employed the utmoft of his Art and Skill\nin her Behalf; And upon my Word, adds he, my\nChild, I have had a fatherly Concern for you ;\nand I have engaged fo many of the good Spirits\nof the fuperior Regions in your Favour, that they\n(always ready to do A6i:s of Beneficence and\nKindnefs to diftrefs'd Mortals) have affured me that\nThomas fhall marry you; ay, and fhall come and\ncourt you to have him too, as much as if he had\nnot gotten this unjufl Advantage of you, or he\nfhall\n\fof M A G I C K. 371\nfhall have no Reft in this Life, nay he fhall have\nno Reft in this Life 'till he does.\nThe poor Girl linil'd, and was mightily pleas'd,\nas you may well fuppofe, and purs her Hand in her\nPocket, and gives the Dcftor half a Guinea for the\ngood News.

Now\nI like you, 'Thomas, I warrant you the Devil will\nhaunt you no more, if you take her; but you have\nbeen but a kind of a Rogue to her before, I under-\nHand.\nUpon the whole, the Doflor heartens him\non, the young Fellow is eafy, and the young\nWoman is fent for; and in the Morning they were\nmarry 'd, and had a great Wedding- Dinner near the\nDo6i:or's Houfe; fo that all was done to the Girl's\nMind, and the Conjurer's too. For the Dv 6bor\nhad two Gunieas o^ Thomas^ for delivering him\nfrom the Devil^ (Who could do it cheaper!) and\ntwenty of the good Wife's Friends, and the Lady\nthat gave the Money thought it wtry well be-\nItow'd.\nThis Management of the Afagiclan, ferves to let\nyou fee, with what Art and Dexterity thefe Men\nplay the Do6]:or with our ignorant People; and\nwell they deferve the Name of Cunning Men\\ and\nas this is the greateft Part of the Magick they are\nMailers of, fo this is the chief End and Aim of\nthis Relation, to let the Reader into the Cheat of\nit. Here were two Fools manag'd by one cunning\nKnave; yet both of them are ferv'd. The Know-\nledge of their Story, and the way to do them both\nJuftice, is pick'd out of their own Mouths; yet\nthey are brought to do one another Juftice, and\nbelieve\n\f378 A S T S T E M\nbelieve 'tis all done by the Magick of the Cunning\nManj he gets their Money, and they come\nboth off thankful into the Bargain. And here's\nnot an Ounce of Magick in it all *, here's no deal-\ning with the Devil in ail this. 'Tis nothing but a\nBite^ a kind of a Juggle j a Devil and no Devily a\nDodor no Conjurer, a Vifion without a Spirit, a\nDance without a Fiddle 5 and in a word, here was\nCraft, but no Knavery neither: For what he did,\nended in doing a poor injur'd Wench Juftice, and\nbringing a young impudent Fellow upon his Knees,\nmaking him take the Woman, not indeed for the\nFear of God, but for Fear of the Devil.\nThis Account of the Do6tor, or Cunning Man,\nmay ftand upon Record, as a Specimen of the Ma-\ngick which we have now generally pra6tis'd among\nu&i or if you pleafe to take it as a Specimen of\nwhat is at prcfent put upon the World for Magick.\nFor as to the Real Black Art, or Dealing with the\nDevil by way of Compad, Intercourfe, Witchcraft,\nand fuch like, we find fo little of it left, that we\nhave fome rcafon to fay 'tis quire out of Ufe, and\nwe have heard very little of it in this Part of the\nWorld for many Years.\nNot that we are much better than our Anceftors,\nnor have we feen any thing in the Manners of the\nPeople lefs addicted to Sorcery than formerly j but\nCuftom has made Men turn Magicians to them-\nfelves, we feem to carry on our Correfpondencc\nwith Hell fingle handed, and by a kind of immedi-\nate Intercourfe > fo that we want no more the Help of\nthe Magician^ whatever we do of the Magick. And\nhere I think the Magick it felf being as it were\nbrought to a Conclufion, the Hillory of it is juftly\nat a Conclufion alfo. The Arts of Hell are\nnow no more carry'd on by particular Inftruments,\nand by way of ProfefTion j the Black Art is at End 5\nthe Devil having no more need of the Magicians,\nhas\n\fof M A G I C K. 375^\nhas drop'd them, and manages his Affairs himfelfj\nand the Magicians having no other Accefs to the\nDevil^ than what is Imaginary, and carry'd on by\nmeer Legerdemain, whatever it was formerly, their\nNumber is decreased, and in a manner worn off by\nTime 5 fo that you have now nothing left but a\nfew Jugglers, Cunning Men, Gypfies and Fortun-\ntellers. In ihort the Trade is decay'd, and we may\nfuppofethe Managers of the Black Negotiation have\nturn'd their Hands to other Employments.\nCHAP. VI.\nOf raijing the Devil by Magical Operations ;\nwhether the Magicians really have fuch a\n\u00a5ower or no^ afid if they have^ ^ujhether it\nis ferfornid as an Art^ and by the Confe-\nquence ofMagical Experiments^ or whether\nit is by Concert and mutual Confent^ be-\ntween Satan and the Magicians.\nRAifing the Devil has been thought by fome\nto be a Branch of Witchcraft rather than Ma-\ngick'y and then it {hould not be mentioned in this\nPlaces but the Point is not fully decided. It fecms\nboth the Worthy Profeffions have pretended to it,\nand perhaps both have attained to pra(S:ife it, and\nfo it may be reckon'd among the Occult Sciences, in\ncommon to the Praditioners of boch Kinds, and\nthen may be properly treated of in which part of\nour Undertaking we pleafe.\nIt is a kind of a vulgar ExprefTion, and has not\nmuch Propriety in it, \/ mean that of raifing the Devil -y\nfor the Devil is not rais'd, he is rather brought\ndown. As his Abode is exprefly faid to be in the\nupper\n\f38o A s r s r E M\nupper Regions, and his Principality is in the Air,\nhe is not fecchM oar of the Earth 5 and as fomc\nhave thought with the ftamp of a Foot, as if he\niodg'd under u^ and we knock'd for him, as the\nfick Body knocks upon the Floor for the Nurle to\ncome up Stairs, and fpeak to him.\nSatan certainly is not far out of Call, tho' 'tis flill\nfo meting doubtful in what particular Element he\ninhabits.\nI. Not in the Earthy (fay I) becaufe then he\nwould be impower'd to fhake the World with\nEarthquakes, overturn Cities and Towns, and give\nMankmd perpetual Didurbances, and perhaps would\nbe oblig'd to do fo as often as he mov'd from Place\nto Place. Nav, it would feem neceflary that the Earth,\nnotwith Handing his fpirituous Nature, mud fuffer\nfome Convulfions, Diflocations, and Openings, or\nfome or other Diftortions, every time an old Woman\nhad Occafion to fpeak with him.\nt. Not in the Sea: this is apparent by the Devils\no^ Gadarene^ who befought Chriffc not to fend them\naway into the Deep. It feems they have an Averfion\nto the Water, and that therefore Inllindtled the Herd\nof Swine to run into the Sea, to deliver themfelves\n, from the Devil^ fuppofing he would leave them\nwhen they came there. But the Hogs it feems\nwere not fagacious enough to find their Way ouc\nagain, or to conlider that before they went in,\nl^uke viii. ?i, 33.\n3. Not in the Fire-, Becaufe that Element is ap-\npropriated for their final State, is to be their Pri-\nfon, and the Place of their Punifhment> and as\nthey have at prefent an Interval for A6tion, fo they\nmull have a Medium of Space for their Refidence\nduring the time of A6i:ion.\n4. It muft then be in the Jir^ or airy Regions;\nand as we have reafon to believe that they are not\nconfined to the Atmofphere of this Globe the\nEarth,\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 38,\nEarth, which compar'd to them, their Numbers,\nand the Extent of their Operations, would be by-\nmuch too narrow a Place for them, too much pre-\nfcrib'd and limited, and give them no room for\nA6lion in proportion ro themfelves> fo T am wil-\nling to allow Satan to be in Capacity, (at lealt able)\nto vifit all the Atmofpheres and Spaces in the im-\nmenfe Wafte, whether of habited, habitable, or\nuninhabited Bodies 3 and whether in thofe we call\nPlanets, or fuch Bodies as we have no Name for,\nbecaufe no Knowledge of.\nThus the Devil cannot complain that I have not\ngiven him room enough, fince I have deny'd his\nLocality to no Place but Heaven^ where he cannot\ncome, and perhaps does not now defire it, and\nthe other grofs Elements which could not contain\nhim.\nThe Devil being Refident, chiefly at lead,\nin that invifible World, the Air, and which we\nparticularly call the World of Spirits, our bringing\nhim out into Company is very unworthily call'd\nrailing the Devil -^\nfor how can that be rais'd up,\nwhich is already not below?\nHowever, if we will talk intelligibly, we mud:\ncall things as other People call them, and fpeak of\nthem as other People underftand them, that they\nmay know what we talk of, and know how to\nthink upon what we fpeak to them about. Having\ntherefore no other way of exprefling it, you mull:\nbe content to hear me fpeak of railing the Devil^\ntho' ac the fame time I tell you 'tis Nonferife in the\nvery Terms, and contrary to Nature.\nBut to hold you no longer upon fettling Preli-\nminaries, the Point in liand is, Can the Magicians\nwho we are now fpeakingoF, raife the Devil^ or can\nthey not ? Can the Alagick Art perform this\nhigh Operation, is it in the reach of the Profeflion,\nand is Satan fubjeded to it } is he obliged to come\nwhen\n4\n\f38i A S Y S T E M\nwhen he is calPd, when fuch and fuch Words of\nCommand are given out, fuch and fuch Methods\nus'd, fuch and fuch Words repeated ? is he rous'd,\nas the Keeper rouzcs the Lions in the Tower^ di-\nilurb'd from his Abode, and oblig'd to come away ?\nor as the Huntfman unharbours a Deer, by his Horn\nand his Hallow ?\nIf the De'vil is under this Neceffity, and is thus\nat the Summons of every Glafs Trumpet, as we\nmay call it, that every Scoundrel rafcally \/7>^\/r^-(r<^\/^r\nand Circle-maker can fetch him up, when they think\nfitj I muft fay, I think Satan is no free Agent;\nHe is very far from being a Prince, and a Prince\nof the Power of the Air. Nay, there are fo many\nrational Objections againfl it, fo many Difficulties,\nAbfurdities, and even Impoffibiliries in it, that I\nthink there is hardly room for any farther Difpute\nabout it ; the thing has nothing in it rational, or\nagreeing to common Senfe.\nBut how is it done then ? for that it is fo, and\nthat the Devil does appear, when they call, does\ncome, when he is fent for, and that by the meaneft\nof thofe Creatures who have thofe Dealings with\nhim, is not to be deny'dj nor never has been deni-\nable fincc the Witch of Endor\\ Days, nor will it\nwant Confirmation on many Occafions fince that\n:\nDid not fhe put it to Saul^ who he would have her\nbring up? intimating that fhe could bring up whom\nfhe pleas'd, even the Devil himfelF, if he wanted\nhim.\nIt muft be then by Concert and Agreement j for\nif the Devil can't be forc'd out of his Den, if he is\nnot conjur'd up, as we call it 5 he muft be invited\nin a friendly manner, and prevail'd upon by En-\ntreaties, or expeded by Agreement > and in both\nthefe Cafes 'tis much more ageeeable to our Under-\nftanding, and we can conceive of things with much\nmore Propriety.\nEither\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 583\nEither he is invited by Entreaties and Petitions,\nimportun'd and earneftly defir'd to come j and this is\na kind of Peculiar 5 for that it is a Reality we have\nno room to doubt. I fay, 'tis peculiar to thole\nCountries where the Devil is worfhip'd as a God,\nwhere they bow the Knee, and, as the Indians call\nit, fiiy O to him as a fupreme Power. That he\nwillingly obferves thefe Summons, and comes when\nthey defirc him, is eafy to fuppofej as he is a poli-\ntick Devil, and wilHng to preferve his PofTeflion a-\nmong them, willing to be worfhip'd and ador'd, as\nhe mod obfequioufly is upon thofe Occafions, and\nwhich he in a manner triumphs over his Maker by,\nas if he had gain'd a Victory, had conquer'd\nthofe Parts of his Dominions, and taken them from\nhim by Force.\nOr on the other hand, he is oblig'd by Contradt,\nbetween himfelf and thofe Infernal Merchants that\ntrade with him. I fay, he is oblig'd to come when\nthey have Occafion for him^ and in this cafe he\nmull perform his Promife, or elfe he would not\nmaintain his Credit, and would not be trufted again.\nThus, in one, he is bound to come as he is a cun-\nning Devilry and knows his Inrereflj and in the o-\nther Cafe, as he is an honell Devil, and keeps his\nWord 5 tho' the laft is fubje6t to many Breaches\nandFalfifications, and he is not always as good as his\nWord neither.\nAll the Difficulty that lies before us here, is, how\nhe makes his Bargains. Witches \u00abnd Wizards, they\ntell us, fign Contrads, let him prick their Hand5,\nand fign with their Blood 5 Hellilh Doings ! buc\nI do not tell you I give anyCredic to them. But the\nMagicians^ who, it is luppos'd, arc Perfons of a fu-\nperiour Dignity, feem to ad: upon a better foot,\nand by the Help of what they call Art 5 have to do\nwith him in a fuperior Way 5 what that Way is,\nand what Art it is to be caird, that brings the\nAffairs\n\f384 A S Y S r E M\nAffairs of Hell into fuch a Management, is the\ngreat Queftion before me.\nIt is true, the Magicians deny it, and Dr.\nJBoreman would have told you he fcorn*d your\nWords 5 he raifed no Devil^ he had to do with no\nevil Spirits, he dealt with no fuch Cattle 5 but on\nthe contrary, that he laid the Devil when other\nPeople raifed him 5 that he cured Houfes that were\nhaunted, and turned the Devil out of Doors when\nhe was got in 5 all which I believe as ftedfaftly as\nI do that St. Dunftan took him by the Nofe with\na pair of red hot Tongs j or that St. Francis would\nhave nothing to do with him, when he appeared\nto him in the Shape of a Bag of Money; or that\nSi. Ignatius refifted him, when he tempted him in\nthe Shape of a naked beautiful Lady.\nWhere, by the way, if the Legend Makers of the\nRomip Church could prove thofe two Paffages\nto be true in Fa6b, fo that we could no more doubt\nthem, we ihould have much more Reafon to take\nthofe two Perfons for Saints than ever I thought\nwe had. It mud be confefs'd, the thing would\nbe rare in itfelf, to fee a Pried kick a Purfe of Gold\nout of his Way upon the Road, and not think it\nworth his while to take it up: So, to fee a young\nLady, beautiful and charming, offer herfelf to a Prieft,\nand he turn from her, as Jofeph from his Miftrefs,\n]ookM a little more Saint-like than I muft own I\nfhould expe6l from any of the Tribe, efpecially on\nthe Roman Side of the Queftion. I hope our own\nChurch has abundance of fuch Saints among the\nClergy, tho' I may not have the Honour to be\nacquainted with many of them.\nBut thefe Men of Art can raife him 5 that feems\nto be a Truth too folid to be deny'd; and I muffc\nnot hazard my Reputation fo much as to oppofe\nall the old Women that have feen him, or dream'd\nthey faw him : So that I mufl take it for granted,\nthat\n\fof M A G I C K. 385\nth^t they can raife him > tho' I believe it no more\nthan I do that Dr. Boreman could lay him when\nother People had raifed him, which 1 take to be\nwhimfical and ridiculous.\nBut fuppofing then, for Difcourfe fake, that they\ncan raife him, as they call it j What is it^ and how\nis it done ?\nAs to what it is, I take it to be no more than\nthis 5 that the De^'il is pleafed, at their Defire figni-\nfy'd to him in fach manner as to the Magician in his\ngreat Wifdom feems meet^ to alfume a Vifibiliry, and\npt- on fuch a Shape or Perfon as he and the Ma-\ngician agrees upon for the prefent Purpofe. This\nbemg granted, two Things neceffarily follow:\n1. That the Devil and the Magician really cor-\nrefpond.\n2. That the Devil was prefent before, only not\nvifibly.\n\/\u00bb\/?, That the Devil and the Magician corre-\nfpond:By Correfponding mud I think be undcr-\nftood that the Magician knows where Satan isj\nthat Meafurcs are concerted between them, how\nto converk^ 5 as was the cafe between him and Al-\nhrahazen^ of whom already 5 and that by thefe con-\ncerted Meafures, he can ask the Favour of Satan\nas often as he pieafes, to make himfelf vifible\nfor fuch or fuch an Occafion, as at that time pre-\nfents.\n2. By thisitfhould feem, according to the Opinion\nof Some Icariied in this Wifdom, that thofe Magi-\ncrans that are eminent in their Pra6tice, have fome\nDevil or other always with them, vidble to them-\nfelves, tho'invifibleto others > and that they both fee\nand converfe with them conrinually. This is very\nrational to believe, and is what 1 take to be that\nwhich the bcripture means by having a Familiar\nSpirit 5 and that Menajfeh had fuch, the Text is po-\nC c ^ ficive\n\fA SYSTEM\nfitive in. Now that tbefe Men or Women, whe-\nther Magicians or what you pleafe to call them,\ncan defire the Favour of their Familiar or Seconda-\nry Devil^ to afiume a Shape and put on ViUbihty,\nI make no queflion of j it feems to be no great\nmatter, and to have no great Difficulty in it. On\nthe other hand, thefe feem to be the only People\nthat can raife the De^uil j for how fhould any body\nelfe do it upon fuch common and ordinary Occa-\nfions, if he was not at their Elbow ? how could\nthey call him with muttering over a little Gib-\nbcrilh, and talking it in Whifper too? The Devil is\nnot Omnifcient 5 he cannot, at the Diftance of his\nairy Dwelling, know the Thoughts of the Agent,\nor fee the Circles and Figures he draws ^ he muft\ntherefore be invifibly prefent with him, can fee his\nCircles, Croflesand Figures, and all his Motions, whe-\nther publick or private j and I infift upon it, that\nnone can raife the Devil in this manner but fuch\nMen as thofe, that have a certain and conftant fn-\ntercourfe with him. I do not fay that the Ma-\ngicians have this Correfpondence with him, nor do\nI fay or believe that all of them can bring .9^\/^;\/ into\nApparition when they pleafe 5 but this I do both fay\nand believe, that thofe that can or do thus raife him,\n.as we call it^ do it by this Means, and have fuch a\nCorrefpondence and Intimacy with him, and that it\ncan be done by no other.\nAll the Notions which we can have of the Devil^\nfounded upon the Scripture, or upon Reafon, feem\nto jullify this Opinion > for unlefs we fhall allow\nhim to be Infinite, Omnifcient and Omniprefent, (and\nthat would be to make him a God) we cannot make it\nrational that he ihould be commanded into Vifi-\nbility and Adtion jufl; when we pleafe.\nIf he is confin'd to Locality, if he is any-where,\nand that Any-where is Some-where, then he mult\nhave\n\fof M A G 1 C K,\nhave fome fettled Intelligence eftablifhcd between\nhim and Mankind for the carrying on his Bufinefsj\nand this muil be carried on by the Agency of fome\nSpirits, it cannot be by Voice only, by mecr Whi-\nfper and Suggeilion, if he be not prefentj for tho'\nit may be true that Spirits converfe without the\nHelp of Voice, yet infernal Spirits cannot a6l, as the\nInfinite Eternal Being a\u00a3bs, namely, by infinite ex-\ntenfive Knowledge j they muft converfe by the fn-\nftrumentality and regency of their Perfons : it is\ntrue it may be imperceptible to human Sight, and\nit is fo 5 but there is not the lefs Reality in their\nAgency, for that there is not the lefs Perfonality\nnor Agency of Perfons or Places on that account;\nfor That may as really be that cannot be perceived\nto exift, as That which is vifible.\nNow ftand clear Magick, and fland clear Magi-\ncians > for if the Magician can raife the Devil^ he\nmuft correfpond with the Devil-y and if he corre-\nfponds with the Devil^ he muft have a Familiar j or\nhow does he do it? The Devil muft either be al-\nways by him, or have an Agent Devil in Com-\nmifJion always attending him, and always ready to ad:\nas he ftiall diredj a Deputy Devil under Orders, and\ninftru6led to a6t for him, and to perfonate either\nDevil^ or other Shape, as Occafion prefents, or as the\nMagician pleafes to direft. It can be no otherwife,\nnot the Devil himfelf can a<5t upon any other foot.\nAll we have to fay for our Magicians is, to hope\nthat what they have to fay for thernfelves may have\nfome Truth in it j namely, that they deal with Spi-\nrits, but that it IS with good Spirits, not with the\nDevil^ or with evil Spirits j and this we have only\ntheir own Words for j we cannot be fure it is fo,\nnor will I venture to fay that we have a great\ndeal of Reafon to believe them 5 at leaft there may\nbe room to doubt the Truth of it,\nCc i I\n\fA SYSTEM\nI would rather advance for them what I have\nmuch more Reafon to believe, and that is, that\nthey deal with no Spirits at all, either good ar\nbad 5 for if I fliould once entertain a Belief that\nthey really confuited with any Spirits at all, I ftiould\nbe afraid they were Devils 5 bccaufe, as I have faid\nthat I believe the Devil would not be at their Beck\nat every Turn, fo often as they have Occafion for him \\\nfo I am lefs oF the Opinion that the good Spirits\nwould be called backward and forward on their\ntrivial and frivolous Errands, nor is it rational to\nbelieve they fhould.\nIfthen they have any Spirits, I doubt they areZ)m\/r,\nnot good Spirits 5 bur my more jult^fiable Opinion,\nand which I think is really well-grounded, is, that\nmoft, if not all of them, who pretend to this Converfe\nwith Spirits, have no Knowledge of, or Correfpon-\ndence with, any Spirits at all > but that all the\nCant of their good Spirits, the Inhabitants of\nthe invifible World, and their Intelligence with\nthem is a Cheat, a meer Cheat and Delufion, toabufe\nthe ignorant world, impofe upon the weak, and if\npoffible gain themfelves a Charafter and a Fame of\nKnowledge and Wifdom, in order to pick Pockets,\nand get Money.\nHow many Tricks do they play with Mankind!\nhow many Frauds do they put upon us ! under how\nmany Sham- Appearances do they juggle with us!\n'Tis plain, when any fublime Doctrine comes to be\ndifcufs'd by them, they are all in the dark> they\nneither can conceive right themfelves, or teach us\nhow to make a right Judgment of any thing, but\nappear to be empty ignorant Creatures themfelves\n;\nwho have, like Jacob Behemen^ got a high Cant of\nmyftick Language, Words without Meaning, and,\nas I faid before, valued only for their being un-\nintelligible, and that entirely foj and very parti-\n# cularly\n\fof M A G I C K. 389\ncularly too, for that they are fo put together, that\nnot only no body that hears them can underr\nftand them, but that they do not underlland 'em\nthemfelves.\nThis certainly is the juft Chara6ler of moil of the\nMagicians we meet with in our Times 5 what may\nhave been formerly, or what may yet be, where the\nDevil has really a Correfpondence with any of thefe\nPeople, and if there are any Alhrahazens alive, I will\nnot determine 5 but then, 1 fay, either thefe mult\nhave a more than inrimatc Converfe with the De^\n*vil perfonally, as Ali had, or they mull do it by way\nof Familiar^ by a conftant attending Agent 5 and\nthen they are no more Magicians, but Necroman-\ncers^ and downright Dealers with the Devil -y and\nthis is not what we are talking of, it not what\nthey pretend to, nor is it really in them.\nTo bring it then down to the Cafe in hand, I\nmean about raifing the Devils the prefent Queftion\nis of two Parts, Firft^ Whether the Magicians have\na Power to raife the Devil^ that is, to produce an\nAppearance or Apparition of the -D^i;\/\/. This, I fay, I\nwill not deny 5 only that then I fay, they are no more\nMagicians, but Witches, Wizards, Necromancers,\nor what elfe you pleafe to call thofe People that\nhave an immediate Converfation with the Devil.\nSecondly^ Whether, if they can do it at all, 'tis\ndone as an Art^ a Syftem, for the Pradice of which\nthere are Rules and Methods, which being learned\nby others, enables them to perform the fame thing,\nas an Operation, whether mathematical or other-\nwife ? and this I think I may venture to deny 5 becaufe\nI think it fubje6ts Satan to fuch a Situation of\nCircumftances, as are ipconfiftent with all the No-\ntions we have of him as a Spirit, as a powerful\nunlimited Seraph, a Prince of the Air, and rvho\nfcxcept where his Maker has limited and pref :-\nibt: i\nC c 3\nairr.)\n\f390 A SYSTEM\nhim) is placed in a Station inconceivably fuperior to\nall human Influence or Operation.\nTo talk of fere wing the De'vil up into an En-\ngine, thac like a Jack in a Box he may be brought\nout and fhewn for a Sight to the People whenever\na Conjurer thinks fit, or to be fhewn like a Puppet-\nShowfor Two-pence a-piece, I muft needs fay, this\nis really difhonouring the Devil himfclf.\nWhat may be done by Concert and Agreement\nbetween the Devil 2in(\\ them, is one things but to\ntalk of bringing him out by an Art or Invention, (o\nthat, as I faid before, the Artifts may call him in, or call\nhim up, when they pleafej this would be raifing\nhim indeed, in the very litteral Senfe of the Word\n}\nand may be, for ought I know, what was the true\nMeaning of the Expreflion at firft. And I muft ob-\nferve here, this raifing the Devil is an old way of\nfpeaking, and was formerly much more in ufe a-\nmong us than it is nowj for 1 am not yet deter-\nmined in the matter fully, whether it be a Fad or\na meer proverbial Speech : My Opinion at prefent\nmuft neceflarily be for the latter j for as to raifing\nhim, 'tis, as I have faid already, a piece of Nonfenfe,\nbecaufe (i) it intimates that he is fctch'd up ab in-\nferisy from Below 5 whereas I have given many\ngood Reafons to move you to believe he is already\nrather Above than Below : and, (2) Becaufe I can\ngive you many more to prove, that if he was Be-\nlow, that is to fay, in Hell^ in the bottomlefs Pit\nit felf, as we have too much fancy'd he is j all the\nold Women and old Witches, and all the Prayers\nin the Parifti, read backward, all the Circles and\nFigures, all the Paw-waws and Conjurings in the\nWorld, could never fetch him out again j 'till He\ncomes, who has the Key of the Bottomlefs Pity and\n'who JhutSy and no Man can open.\nWe\n\fof M A G I C K.\nWe are told that St. Peter gave our holy Father\nof St. Angela the Keys of Heaven-, but I doubt he\nhas not the Keys of t'other Place tooj if he has,\nhe has been but a forry Jaylor, for the Devil has\nbeen abroad thefe four thoufand Years to our\nKnowledge, and continues Hill at large j not a\nConftable can take hira up, even a Scape IVarraut\ncannot apprehend him.\nAs he is then at large^ tho' he is a Prifoner too\nin one Senfe, but as 1 fay the Devil is at lan^^e, he\nis then a free Agent as to us, he goes to and fro^ in\nor throughout the Earthy and vjalks tip and down\ntherein^ Job. i. 7. He has free Liberty o't Egrefs and\nRegrefi^ can go and come, when, where and how he\npleafes.\nI mufl plead for Liberty^ you (qq^ tho' it be for\nthe Devil. It has pleafed his Maker to give this\nroaring Lion Liberty to go up and down, fecking,\nt^c. and how came he to fell or lofc that Liberty ?\nHow came the Magician to be the DeviPs Jay lor,\nthat he fhould have him in his Cuftody, to call hitn\nout when he thinks fit? If it is fo, 'tis a voluntary\nConfinement, and the Devil finds his Account in\nit, or he would never fubmic to it 5 fo that it mufb\nbe by a Confent of Parties, and then we come into\nthe Road of things again 5 that. is to fay, that the\nDevil may confent to appear v\/hen he is fo and fo,\n\u2022and for fuch and fuch Purpofes, required 5 but this\nis quite another thing than what the Magicians are\nfaid to do J I muft therefore give it againli: them.\nThe Devil is not to be raifcd by Art j no Magick,\nno Conjuring, no Circles or Squares, no Prayers read\nbackward, no, or forward either, will bring him\nout, unlels he pleafes, and finds it for his Purpofe.\nIf he comes at all, he comes of himfelf, and about\nhis own Bufinefs, or by Agreement with his own\nDomefticks, fuch as old Mother - of Endor^\nC c 4 or\n391\n\fA S Y S T E M\nor Mother Lackland of Ippwich^ or fuch as he is in\nactual Confederacy with 5 but as for your Preten-\nders to Art, that they can raife him, and lay him,\nfetch him in or fend him out, 'tis all a Cheat, and\nthe Magician has this to be faid in his Favour, that\nhe really is not fo intimate with the Devil as he\nfays he is.\nCHAP, VIL\nSeeing^ as the Magicians preteitd^ they do not\nT>eal with the Devil, or raife the Devil,\nWho it is they do 'Deal withy how is\nthetr Correfpondence managed^ and why do\nthey \"Deal with Good Spirits^ by Conju^\nrings and the Black Art ?\nTHERE remain but two Qiicftions then,\nwhich have any Difficulty in them, to fpealc\nto in this Affair of Magickj the firft is the natural\nConfcquence of what is faid before 3 If the Magi-\ncian cannot raife the Devil^ who and what it is he\ndoes raife? for we will have it that he has Spirits\nabout him : If they are not evil Spirits, as he will\naflert in his own Defence, what Spirits are they, and\nby what Power or Influence does he maintain fuch\na Correfpondence among the Intelligent Beings of\nthe invifible World, as to procure rhofe fuperior\nAngelick Creatures to appear upon Earth, either at\nhis Requell, or upon fuch Occafions as he repre-\nfents to them ?\nThere is too much Difficulty, I had almoll faid\nAbfurdity, in this Part, for us to come into it, as\nthe Magicians pretend to dcfirej they would\n-'\nhave\n\fof M A G I C K. 393\nhave us believe that all they do is by the Aid aixi\nAfHftance of thefe happy Intelligent Beings, that\nthey, upon the meer Principle of Affection to\nMankind, and meerly from their Beneficent Na-\nture and Difpofition, are ready at all times to af-\nfift their faithful Agent or Servant the Magician^ in\ndoing a6Vs of Chariry, Kindnefs and Benevolence\nto their Fellow-Creatures.\nIt is true, the Magician by this puts a great\nCompliment upon himfclf, and fuggefls that he is\nhimfelf a general Bleffing to Mankind 5 and that as\nfach thefe Generous and Beneficent Beings fin-\ngle out them (the Magicians) as the proper Inftru-\nments of their Kindnefs to their Fellow-Crearures;\nand that they even could not a(51:, at lead not fo\nfully atid effe6tually5 without them.\nThat therefore it is, thofe fuperior Beings are\npleas'd to converfe with thefe Magicians^ and com-\nmunicate to them a fuperior Knowledge of things,\nmaking them ufeful to Mankind, and giving them\na Reputation for their Wifdom, that fo the div^\nflreifed People may apply to them for Affillance,\nDiredtion and Counfel.\nBut then the fecond Qucftion i'^. How do thev\nconverfe with them, by what means do thofe good\nSpirits come to know when the Magician has any\nthing to be aflifted in, and in what manner do they\nclaim or defire their Affiftance? Now the Diffi'\nculty of this Queftion raifes a Doubt almoft-4111-\nanfwerable againft the Truth of the Magician*s An-\nfwer to the firft.\nThey tell us they converfe with the good Spi-\nrits of the invifible World : That they would have\nus take as a firlt Principle, a Poftulatum that ihould\nbe granted i tho' 'tis pretty much to ask too; but\nto oblige them as far as with any colour of com-\nmon Senfe can be done, let us fuppofe it, tho' f\nean by no means grant it. Hue\n\f3P4 A S Y S T E M\nBut how then is it manag'd? How is this Con-\nverte carry'd on? In a word, how do they come\ntogether ? It muft be either,\n1\n.\nBy the Magicians applying to thefe Spirits for\nAdvice when they want it.\n2. Or by the Spirits ofBcioufly coming to them\nupon fuch Occafions, of their own mecr Good-\nnefs.\n3. Or thofe good Spirits muft be always prefent,\nand to be Teen, fpoken to, and converfed with, with-\nout calling, or without leeking to be call'd.\nI mull be lb plain with our Magicians^ as to fay, that\n1 do not Tec how either of thele three can be made\nout by them j nor yet how they can defend them-\nfelves from the Charge of Diabolick Magick, un-\nlefs they make out all the three, and that very\nclearly too.\nI. As to Magicians applying to thefe Spirits for\nAdvice and InteUigencej this I know is their Pre-\ntence, this they all alledgej and when the poor\nignorant People apply to them, they make a great\ndeal of Ceremony with their Circles and Figures,\nwith Magical Books, Hebrew or vfr^^\/V\/^ .\nChara-\n\u00a3ters, muttering of hard Words, and other Barba-\nrifms innumerable J Juft, in a word, as the old\nNecromancers do, when they confult with the\nDevil.\nNow, is there any thing of all this requifite\nin order to converfe with a good Spirit ? did the\nProphets of old ufe any thing of this Mimickry,\nwhen they went to enquire of the Lord? If they\nwould have their Art be caird the Sacred Science,\nand we muft believe that they converfe with Hea-\nvenly Beings, what need of all thefe Amufements,\nthefe Conjurings and Paw-wawings?\nWill they make us believe that the good Spi-\nrits are to be us'd as the Wizards and Witches ufe\nthe\n\fof M A G I C K.\nthe Devil? that they are to be brought down by\nMutterings and Conjurings, by Poftures andDiftor-\ntions, or (as our Dancing- Mailers talk) by Gro-\ntefque Characters ? This would do very little to\noblige our Reverence, Nor to me, would it look\nlike any thing but talking to the Devil.\nU it is done to put an Amufement upon the\nignorant People that come to them, and to give\na Soleminity (as they call it) to the thing, then 'tis\nevident it is done to cheat them. For what Oc-\ncafion could there be for fuch things, if they were\nreally about to converfe with the exalted Spirits\nof a heavenly Kind, and Inhabitants of the invifible\nRegions?\nIt is manifeft they apply to their invifible an-\ngelick Spirits, juft as the other fort of People\ndo to the Devil. Their Ceremonies of Ad-\ndreft arc much the fame, and when the poor ig-\nnorant Stranger fcems furpriz'd at it, they tell\nhim he fhould not fear, for they are not going\nto raife the Devil -y\ngranting clearly that there was\ngood reafon to fufped: it.\nIf they are Honefl, why then will they not tell\nus the reafon of all thcfe Barbarifms? What\nCaufe, and what Necefficy, when they are apply-\ning to Heaven, to a6t juft as thofe do who\napply to Hell? Let them examine Hiltory or An-\ntiquity, nay let them examine Nature 5 are the\nApplication to God and Idols the fame? The\nDevil may mimick the Methods of the beft Ser-\nvice, and feek to be ferved in the fame manner\nas his Maker 3 but we no where read that ever\nthe Servants of God mimick'd the Devil -^ 'till\nnow.\nLet them look at that eminent Time, when\nthe Prophet Elijah brought himfelf and the Priefts\nof Baal to a Teft for the Truth of their Wor-\nfhip,\n39y\n\f39<5 A S Y S T E M\nfhip, and the Reality of the God they wor-\nflijp'd: The Idolatrous Priefts began their Pagan\nRites, their Sacrifices were alike j that was ap-\npointed by the Prophet, becaufe they fliould not\nlay but their Idol Devil had equal Honour done\nhim, as the true God had, in a Proportion.\nBut when they came to the Service of the\nPriefts, the Idol-Priefts us'd their Exorcifms, their\nConjurings, their Ecftafies and their Barbarifms,\nleaping up upon their Altars, and dancing to\ntheir Q ^d.^ then cutting themfelves with Knives,\nand the like.\nBut when the truly reverend Prophet came to\nbegin the facred Office, and the Apparatus of lay-\ning the Sacrifice upon the Wood was fimply per-\nformed > what d\\6 Elijah? nothing, but in a folemn\nmanner, and in the Audience of all the People,\n?ind in the \\ ulgar Tongue, that they might all\nliiiderftand what was faid, and with a loud Voice,\nc?X\\ upon the True God to hear him, and to\ngiorifie himfelf in the Sight of the People^ and\nGod d'd hear him, and magnified his Power ac-\ncordingly_, t^ the Convidion of the People, even\n|Co the Conviction of their Senfes.\nBring this down to our Cafe now. Here is a\nfet of Men pretending to confult the good Spi-\nrits, Inhabitants of the fuperior Regions, and who\ndwell in the angelick World, where-ever that is.\nTo thefe they give all the adorable Names they\ncan devife, in ftrange and Outlandiih Terms, and\nadvance them in their Notions, that they may\nraife the Regard of their wondering, but ignorant\nAdmirers.\nWhen they have done all this, they apply\nto them juft after the Pattern of the Wizards\nand Necromancers in their enquiring of the Devil^\nwith Mutterings and Whifpers, with hard and\n.'\nexotick\n\fof M A Q I C K.\nexotick Words, and unintelligible Speeches-, as ^f\nthe good Spirits did not underibnd Enf.'(^\nwell as Arah'ick and Hebrew^ or as w--\nunmeaning, unfignifying DevH- Lafigi' ' \u2022, i\nJ r.,v .i\nof their own forming, witnout. -\u2022\u2022 '\nUiage\namong Men, but fuch as they pleai\n:\nup-\non it.\nHow can this be rfconc\u00bbrd to the converling\nwith Good Spirits?

Were they fuch\nblelTed, bountiful, and ben'- fi cent Beings, and io ready\nto help and affifl: Manlond in times of Dif-\nficulties, prote6b them from Evil, and from evil\nSpirits, 'twould be but reafonable to fuppofe they\nfhould give fome Dire6tions to Mankind, how to\nobtain and procure then Affiftance, when they\nwant it.\nIt is fuppofed, if thefe Spirits are fuch good,\nfuch beneficent, compailionate Beings, and fo par-\nticularly inclined to do good to Mankind 5 I fay, it\nis to be fuppofed they are fo, by the determinate\nAppointment of their Creator j their Heavenly Fa-\nther, from whofe inherent Goodnefs all good\nDefires, and all good Thoughts do proceed, as\nwell in Heaven as in Earth, as well in Angels and\nSpirits, as in humane Creatures. Thefe good Spi-\nrits then, if they were fuch as is pretended, would\ncertainly dired Mankind to obtain their Aid, by\npraying\n\f35,8 A S r S T E M\npraying to the Supreme Being, under whofe Com-\nmand and Direftion they immediately are, that\nthey (the faid good Spirits) might be fent to di-\nreft, aflift, and protect thofe that fo defire their\nAiliftance.\nIt is a fhrcwd Sign to me, that thefe Spirits are\nof another Clafs, and that they do not proceed\nfrom Him who is the Author of all Good j that they\nmuft be apply'd to in fuch a fcandalous manner,\njuft as the Devil is apply'd to j that chey take\nthe Honour to themfelves of being apply'd to dt-\nre6tly and immediately, as God himfclf is, and\nwithout giving the Honour to God, the firft\nCaufe and Original Author of all Good 5 and that\nthey at the fame time (loop fo low, as to accept\nof the like mean and bafe Methods of being call'd to\nfor Help, which are ufed when we want to raife\nthe Devil.\nWhat do the Magicians mean by this uncouth\nJargon, I'll go and confult with the good Spirits\nwhich I converfe with^ and Pll bring you an An^\nfwer ? Where arc thefe good Spirits, and how do\nthey converfe with them? If they would fay, I\nwill pray to God that he may feiid his Angels,\nor fome of his Angels, or good Spirits, to advile\nand affift you> this had fome Scnfe in it 5 fome-\nthing like the ufual Method : then when we came\nto the Magician or Cunning Man, our Language\nwould be, we pray you Enquire of the Lord for us^\nand thus it was when God had his good Prophets,\nand his good Spirits to a6t between his People\nand him, as much as can be fuppos'd now.\nBut now the Magicianj inftead of faying I will\nenquire of the Lord for you, fays I will con-\nfult v\/ith the good Spirits of the invifible World,\nwho I have the Honour to converfe with, and\nI will tell you what they fay in your Cafe. Here's\nnot\n\fof M A G 1 C K 399\nnot a Word of God, or of what he p! afes to diO^\nor not to do, to direct or not to : redj but\nthefe good Spirts are to teach and aired 5 as if\nhe that made thefe good Spirits was out of\nthe Queftion, and had nothing to do, either with\nthem or us.\nThefe things, I fay, render it very fufpicious\nthat there are no fuch things as good Spirts m the\nCafe, efpecially when they are join'd with the\nfcandalous manner of their being apply'd to j and\nif there are no good Spirits, and they dif-\nown all Converfation with bad Spirits, it may\nbe faid without Offence, (tho' in the vulgar way)\nnot, What the Devil are they doing? but, What\nDevils are they doing with ?\n2. But here is a fecond Suggeftion to help\nthem out, and this is, that they do not go to\nconverfe with thefe good Spirits, by a fpecial In-\nfluence, calling them to their i\\{?iftance> but the\ngood Spirits (thereby ihowing themfelves to be\ngood and beneficent, as has been faid,) cox^d^t^c^v^di\nto come Voluntier, to help and aflilt, counfel and\ndirect, in cafe of the Diflrefs of thofe helplefs\nCreatures called Men % and that they do this offi-\ncioufly by the AfTillance of their chofen Ser-\nvants the Magicians', who, like the Almoners of a\ngreat Prince, are always laying before their Eyes\nSuitable Objeds for their Help and Benevo-\nlence.\nThis is a formal Story, and might have fome\nWeight in it, if it were not that it wanted\nTruth of Fa6t to fupport it 5 and ihat this is fo^\nwe muft believe, 'till we get the following Diffi-\nculties removed. The firft is, How do they know\nthe Condirion and Circumftance> of thofe that\nwant CO be affiited ? That thefe good Spirits\nmuft either know it by an infinite Prefcience\nby\n\f400 A S Y S r E M\nby which they mud every one of them know\nevery thing, and that not every thing that is vi-\nfihle to human Eyes and Real, but every invi-\nfible and imaginary Thing, the Thoughts, the\nAnguifh of the Soul^ the Defires, Wifhcs^\nFears, Terrors, and Hopes of, nor only the par-\nticular Perfons they are to affift, but of all Peo-\nple whatever^ in all Places and Times, and on\nevery particular Occafion whatever 5 and to do fo\nwould be to be abfolutely and elTenti.illy Q'.A^\nand every one of them feparately foj a Thought\nattended with a Heap of horrid Confufions. and\nforming dillraded Images in the Mind, fuch as\ntend to all manner of Blafphemies on one handj\nor grofs Abfurditics on the other.\nThe next thing is, if the good Spirits cannot\nby their own Prefcience know the Condition and\nCircumftances of thofe that may want their Afli-\nftance > how, or by whom mull they be, or are\nthey informed of it ?\nNow here is the only Crifis in which the Magi-\ncian makes himfelf necelTary 5 for if the good Spirits\nhad, joined to fo univerfal Beneficence in their Dif-\npofition, an infinite Knowledge of all the Perfons\nand their Circumftances who ilood in any need of\ntheir Help, they would then certainly, in confe-\nquence of the general good Difpofition of their Na-\nture, immediately apply themlelves to the proper\nObjects, and in Compallion to them would relieve\nand alliit them of their own free Goodnefs and Be-\nneficence, not needing the Interpofition of any o-\nther Agent whatfoever.\nBut now this we do not find : but thefe good\nSpirits, with all the Good-will which they bear to\nus, yet fit paflively flill, and fee all the Miferies of\nMankind, and all the Diftrefles which this or that\nparticular Perfon labours under, and perhaps lan-\nguiflies\n\fof M A G 1 C K. 401\ngulflies in, and at laft lets him periih without the\nlead Help or Afliftance.\nThis, I think, deftroys the very Notion of their\nPrefcience, or elfe it muft deftroy the Notion of\ntheir Beneficence 5 one or other muft drop: they muil\neither not know of the miferable Wretch and his\nDiftrc{res,who wants their Affiftancej or knowing it,\nthey muft want a Will or Power to aflift and de-\nliver him.\nBut here comes in the Magician, and he truly,\nto make himfelf a necefTary Man in his Generation,\nis to be made acquainted with our DiftrefTes and\nour Complaints, and he is to lay them before thefc\ngood Spirit?, and procure their Anfwers 5 in which\nGafe it follows moft naturally,\nFirft^ That thofe good Spirits are fliort-fighted,\nignorant and uninformed Beings, 'till they receive\nInformation from fome inferior Hand: Thus ia\nihort, the Gounfellor at Law j he is ready to give his\nAdvice in the moft difficult Cafe, and perfe6tly qua-\nlifyed and able to direct what you fhould do 5 but\nhe fits in his Chambers in the Temple or in Lincolns-\nInn, and waits (perfectly paffive in all Bufinefs) 'till\nthe Client, brought by the Attorney or Sollicitor,\ncomes to him with his Brief5 and if the Client does\nnot come, he may fit ftill and be ruined for any\nAdvice or AfEftance the Lawyer will give him, 'till\nlie is asked: Or as the Phyfician > he isMafter of his\nBufinefs, able to diredt and advifc, able to pre-\nfcribe a Specifick, a certain Cure, for fuch or fuch\nDiftempersj but fits in his Study, and ftirs not out\nof his eafie Chair, to do the diftrefs'd People in his\nNeighbourhood any good, or to help them in their\ngreateft Diftrefs, 'till he is fcnt for, and the Cafe laid\nbefore him, and then he fhews his beneficent good\nDifpofition: If they have ftaid 'till the Diftemperis\ntoo far gone, he pities them and fhews his Con-\nD d cern\n\f","_id":1007}
