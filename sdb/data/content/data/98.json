Her main research interests have been consciousness,&nbsp;memetics and parapsychology. She is known as a sceptic of psi phenomena and has frequently appeared in the media promoting a non-paranormal view of out-of-body and near-death experiences. She is currently a visiting professor at the&nbsp;University of Plymouth.

She earned an honours baccalaureate in psychology and physiology in 1973 at Oxford University, followed by a masters in environmental psychology at the University of Surrey in 1974 and a PhD in parapsychology from the same university in 1980.\n\nBlackmore has two children by her first husband, Tom Troscianko, whom she married in 1977 and divorced in 2009.1 She is now married to writer and broadcaster Adam Hart-Davis.2 While raising her children, she worked at freelance writing and media appearances, and lectured part-time at two English universities. In 1992 she began lecturing on psychology full-time at the University of the West of England.\n\nBlackmore is well-regarded for her book The Meme Machine, an exploration of the science of memes. Other interests include artificial intelligence, consciousness, evolutionary processes, free will (which she believes does not exist), lucid dreams, sleep paralysis, spirituality, atheism, religion, Zen and meditation. She approaches spiritual experiences, including near-death and out-of-body experiences, from a secular perspective.\n\nAn early believer in psi, she became a convinced sceptic following her PhD research, having failed to find evidence of psi in her own experiments. Her 1993 book Dying to Live is an influential explanation of the near-death experience in materialist terms.\n\nOnce a Council member of the Society for Psychical Research, she is now a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (formerly the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal).\n\nHer full curriculum vitae may be found on her website here.\n\nBlackmore has written extensively about her work in parapsychology and the development of her thought. Much of this introspective material can be found on her website.  Early Psi Beliefs\n\nAt Oxford, Blackmore headed the student psychical research society. During this time she had a vivid OBE which, she has written, \u2018lasted about three hours and included everything from a typical \u2018astral projection\u2019, complete with silver cord and duplicate body, to free-floating flying, and finally to a mystical experience\u2026\u2019.3 She further writes:  \n\nI (or some imagined flying \u201cI\u201d) set off across Oxford, over the country, and way beyond. For more than two hours I explored strange scenes, entered mystical states beyond space and time, and ultimately lost my self \u2026 It was an extraordinary and life-changing experience. Everything seemed brighter and more real than ordinary life; something seemed to tell me that this mattered more than anything else.4\n\nAt this time she considered ESP to be \u2018a perfectly natural process\u2019:  \n\nAll information about anything that ever happened was stored in some way \u201cout there\u201d. It was something like the Akashic Record I had learned about in my fairly extensive occult studies \u2013 a world of \u201cthought forms\u201d. Anyone could access any of them. If you accessed events directly it was clairvoyance; someone else\u2019s thoughts and it was telepathy; your own it was memory. Memory was therefore a special case of ESP\u2019.5\n\nWhen Blackmore left Oxford, she realized she would not get a grant to study parapsychology, so she funded her way through her PhD by taking a part-time job, and also worked for a few months at a parapsychology lab in Utrecht, Holland.6 Her (unpublished) thesis, titled \u2018Extrasensory Perception as a Cognitive Process\u2019,7 recounts her attempt to test her theory through experimentation. According to her, testing her ideas proved impossible as her experiments produced no evidence of ESP at all, by her interpretation, no matter what procedures were tried.8 She writes:  \n\nIt is probably for that work that I am most loved or hated because it overthrew my prior beliefs in everything and anything paranormal and set me off on a far more skeptical path.9   Parapsychological Research  Out-of-Body Experiences\n\nReflecting on her earlier out-of-body experience (OBE), Blackmore began to research the phenomenon, for which she was awarded the Perrott-Warrick Studentship in Psychical Research. \u2018Instead of looking to the red herring of psi to answer my questions I tried to work out what had happened during those few hours\u2019, she writes.10 She developed several theories, tested them and ultimately concluded:  \n\nI no longer think anything leaves the body in an OBE. Rather it is the brain\u2019s attempt to construct a convincing \u201cmodel of reality\u201d from memory and imagination when its sensory input has failed to provide one.11\n\nFollowing her PhD, Blackmore ran two surveys of university students on the incidence of out-of-body experiences and lucid dreaming.12 In the first, 13% of 217 responders reported having had at least one out-of-body experience (OBE), while 79% reported having had lucid dreams. In the second, 14% of the 115 responders reported OBEs, and 73% reported having had lucid dreams. In the first study, OBEs and lucid dreams tended to be reported by the same respondents, but this was not the case in the second survey. In neither study were OBEs or lucid dreams related to frequency of dream recall.\n\nFurther tests aimed at exploring a relationship between the ability to visualize images and their reported experiences found no relationship, confirming earlier findings.13&nbsp;Blackmore concedes that this appears to weaken her argument that such experiences are purely psychological in nature, but advises against rushing to accept this conclusion, pointing to the study\u2019s limitations.14  Paranormal Belief\n\nBlackmore has investigated probability judgment as a possible basis of paranormal belief. \u2018As soon as I found myself dropping many of my own beliefs I began to wonder why so many people do believe in telepathy, clairvoyance and so on,\u2019 she writes. Her surveys revealed that the main reason was personal experience, for which she then searched for a normal explanation, surmising that a&nbsp;person with poor judgment of probability might underestimate the likelihood of a seemingly anomalous&nbsp;occurrence. In testing, she claims her prediction \u2013 that people who believe in the paranormal have poorer probability judgment than those who do not \u2013 \u2018largely held\u2019.15\n\nIn a 1985 study, Blackmore tested the sceptical hypothesis that paranormal belief originates as an inability to process probabilities in an accurate manner. In two experiments, participants completed various computer-controlled probability tasks. In the first study believers in the paranormal performed worse than disbelievers on most tasks and were significantly worse at responding appropriately to changes in sample size. In the second experiment believers were significantly worse at questions involving sampling.16\n\nHowever, a further study reported in 1997 appeared to cast doubt on the sceptical hypothesis. Blackmore published a questionnaire in the Daily Telegraph asking respondents to identify as paranormal believers or non-believers and state which of ten statements (such as, I have a cat, I have a scar on my left knee) was true for them.17 They then estimated the number of statements likely to be true for others. Probability misjudgement theories that are used to explain paranormal belief predict that people should underestimate the number of statements true for others, and that believers should underestimate more than non-believers. 6,238 replies were received, of which 59% were from believers and 52% from males. There was a strong gender correlation: 70% of females were believers compared with 48% of males. The study failed to confirm the prediction. On average 2.4 statements were true for each person but against prediction, believers over-estimated statement correspondences for others, while believers were no worse than non-believers at estimating the distribution of the number of true statements.\n\nEarlier, Blackmore tested a second sceptical hypothesis, that psi-believers are more likely to believe they have control over a process that is actually beyond human control. She arranged for participants to try to influence a computer-controlled coin-tossing task. Half the trials allowed for subject control of the coin and half did not. The experiment showed that believers felt they exercised greater control than disbelievers, regardless of the level of actual control, but estimated they had scored fewer hits. Blackmore surmised that this could be explained if believers misjudged the baseline chance scoring level. Further testing found that psi-believers underestimated chance scores, a \u2018chance baseline shift\u2019 that could underlie the illusion of control and the belief in psi.18  NDE Tunnel Experience\n\nBlackmore studied NDEs, drawing together threads such as OBEs, the \u2018tunnel experience\u2019, life reviews, hallucinations and mystical experiences, and compiled this research into the book Dying to Live. Trying to explain all aspects of the NDE without recourse to the paranormal, she conceived a theory, \u2018that there was no one there to die in the first place\u2019:  \n\nIt is the illusion that we are a separate self that makes us find a mystery in the relationship between mind and body and fuels the search for evidence that we survive death.19\n\nBlackmore posits several approaches to the tunnel experience: the idea of a real tunnel; representations of transition; reliving birth memories; imagination; and the function and physiology of the visual cortex. Blackmore concludes that all these in combination can account for much of the phenomenology of the tunnel experience, and that they can lead to testable predictions.20  Imagination and Psi\n\nBlackmore explored folkloric observations of a link between confusional and imaginative states of consciousness and psychic ability: if a relationship exists, is it because such confusions lead people to mistake normal events for paranormal occurrences, or because they enhance psi in some way. She ran an experiment designed to induce false memories of pictures of objects. Thirty three participants were shown slides of actual objects and were also asked to imagine other specified objects that they were not shown. The participants were not aware that half of the imagined objects, randomly chosen for each person, were also acting as targets in a clairvoyance task. Blackmore found no correlation between the number of false memories and paranormal belief, against the sceptical hypothesis. There were significantly more false memories of target objects than non-target objects, appearing to indicate that confusing reality and imagination may be psi-conducive.21 However, when Blackmore tried to replicate this finding several years later she was unsuccessful.22  Healing Pendants\n\nBlackmore and Rose tested claims by alternative medicine practitioners that a pendant can provide health benefits, including reduced stress, increased hand strength, and protection from electromagnetic radiation from household appliances. She ran three experiments to test the hypothesis that the pendant\u2019s supposed effects arose through a bioelectric shield. In the first, twelve participants who work with computers wore one or other of two pendants, one with claimed healing potential and one without, being tested regularly for hand strength and mood changes over several weeks. She found both types of pendant increased calmness, but the \u2018real\u2019 pendants did not have a greater effect.\n\nIn two further studies, each with forty participants, hand strength was measured in relation to the use of mobile phones, again using both types of pendants. No effect difference was found. Both studies showed a significant relationship between change in strength with and without the pendant and participant belief in alternative medicine. Blackmore concluded that the pendants appeared to produce a measurable placebo effect but were otherwise ineffective.23  Criticism and Controversy\n\nA critique of Blackmore\u2019s work has been written by parapsychologist Rick E Berger of the Science Unlimited Research Foundation in San Antonio, Texas, USA. While drafting a review of a book by Blackmore, he was struck by patterns suggestive of statistical significance in her psi experiments. Reviewing her unpublished experimental data, he found discrepancies between it and her published works, and other issues. So-called \u2018flaws\u2019 were engineered to dismiss significant results, he claimed, while other flaws were ignored in studies that produced non-significant results.\n\nBerger asserted that Blackmore\u2019s change of viewpoint, claimed by her to be the result of ten years of careful experimentation,24 actually resulted from experiments done between October 1976 and December 1978 for her dissertation, and that in fact she was entirely sceptical already by 1977 as evidenced by her own account. He writes \u2018the vast majority of her studies were carelessly designed, executed, and reported, and, in Blackmore\u2019s own assessment, individually flawed\u2019, concluding that no conclusions should be drawn from this database without a careful meta-analysis of the source material.25\n\nOn the other hand, Berger argued, 30% of Blackmore\u2019s experiments actually reported significant results, contradicting her claims of negative findings throughout.26\n\nResponding to Berger\u2019s allegations, Blackmore conceded that \u2018one cannot draw conclusions about the reality of psi based on these experiments\u2019.27\n\nNonetheless, Berger notes, \u2018Blackmore is extremely vocal in decrying psi research in her writings, on television and radio, and before the sceptical advocacy group CSICOP, citing her own work as the basis for her strong convictions\u2019.28 Parapsychologist Chris Carter writes, \u2018Blackmore has made a career for herself as one of the world\u2019s most well known skeptics of psi\u2019.29  Carl Sargent\n\nIn the early 1980s, Carl Sargent was a leading ganzfeld ESP researcher, responsible for around half of significant studies then extant. In 1987, Blackmore published a critique, based on a visit to Sargent\u2019s laboratory eight years earlier, arguing that the results could have been fraudulent.30 The full journal article can be read&nbsp;here. Blackmore describes the incident in more personal terms in her 1996 autobiography.31\n\nIn a rebuttal, Sargent&nbsp;argued that Blackmore\u2019s original paper, written in 1979 and privately circulated, differed in certain details from the paper published in 1987, which had a markedly more sceptical tone.32 He claimed to find errors of fact in her observations and pointed out that her testimony was uncorroborated while his own was backed by witnesses.&nbsp;He took issue with her claim that her attempts to discover fraud, which including searching an office and making covert checks, were \u2018simple and unobtrusive\u2019.&nbsp;He argued that fraudulent manoeuvres she claimed to expose could not have affected the result positively and that she failed to mention factors that ruled out fraud.&nbsp;Contradicting her objection that he failed to make his data available for reanalysis, he pointed out that during her visit she had spent an afternoon going through it and making statistical analyses.&nbsp;\n\nSargent also complained&nbsp;that, while at the time she accepted his and his associates\u2019 explanations for inconsistencies, she later \u2018spread defamatory rumours and insinuations of fraud\u2019.\n\nSubsequently, Sargent refused to co-operate in further investigation and abandoned the field shortly afterwards. His co-experimenter Trevor Harley continued to assert his support of Sargent\u2019s rebuttal in a recent communication.33  Works  Books\n\nParapsychology and Out-of-the-Body Experiences&nbsp;(1978).&nbsp;Hove, UK: Transpersonal Books.\n\nBeyond the Body: An Investigation into Out-of-Body Experiences (1982).&nbsp;London: Heinemann.\n\nDying to Live: Science and the Near Death Experience&nbsp;(1993).&nbsp;London:&nbsp;Grafton.&nbsp;Sample chapter [Web page]\n\nTest Your Psychic Powers&nbsp;(1995, with A.
