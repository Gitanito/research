Physical Life-The Primary Department in the School of Human Progress\r\n 1878-1883  Weekly<<br> Philadelphia, PA.  Publisher: Mind and Matter Pub. House.  Editor: J.M. Roberts; C.C. Wilson, assistant editor; assisted at times by James A.  Bliss.\r\n Succeeds: The Spiritual Offering (incorporated 1879)\r\n 1\/1, November 30, 1878-November 17, 1883.  $2.00 per year; 4 huge folio pages (24 x 36), then, in November 1879,8 pp., 12 x 17, then 17 x 23, then  12 pp., in June 1881.\r\n Masthead of Ben Franklin  with printing press, flying a kite into dark  clouds that are being dispersed by the rising sun  and the word \"Truth.\" \r\n The dating of the issues  is based upon a system using 1848 (the year the  Fox Sisters first communicated with spirits) as  its base, so 1880 is \"M.S. [Modern Spiritualism]  32.\"  Roberts (1821-1888) is peculiar in many  respects and deserves a book: he was a practicing  lawyer, leading abolitionist and prominent  Republican (son of a U.S. senator).  He is  frequently referred to as \"General\" or \"Colonel,\"  and may have played some role in the Civil War as  well.  He made his fortune as a manufacturer of  cast-iron stoves and spared no expense or effort  to further spiritualism.   He became convinced of  the truths of spiritualism about 1873 when he  contacted the spirit of his father, and became a  fanatic for the movement when he was put into  contact with his deceased daughter through James  A. Bliss.  No fraud or imposture was too broad or  gross to be believed and defended by Roberts.  His journal gave pride of place to attacks on  Colonel John C. Bundy, editor of the  Religio-Philosophical Journal (which tended to  air criticisms of mediums' frauds), and featured  accounts of the likes of Bliss (who advertised a  magnetic healing paper and at least once  confessed in court to his fraudulent  performances - a confession which in no way  deterred Roberts from supporting him) and his  materializing wife; Jesse Shepard (the singing  medium); R.D. Goodwin, M.D. (a follower of P.B.  Randolph); Eveline Hatch (the \"Flower Medium\");  Alfred James (who mediated the spirit of  Randolph, among others but specialized in Greek  and Roman figures); J.V. Mansfield (the \"Spirit  Postmaster,\") and the like.  And he was litigious,  suing at the drop of a hat those defaming him or  criticizing his proteges - even suing on behalf of  Alfred James after James had signed an affidavit  that he had been cheating.  He also defended  (against Madame Blavatsky and others) the Holmes  materializing mediums (Jennie and Nelson), again  bringing a lawsuit for defamation against a  Philadelphia newspaper.  Roberts carried on a  vendetta against Blavatsky and Colonel  Olcott, the founders of the Theosophical Society,  and the journal is a mine of information about  their time in Philadelphia at the end of 1875.  Roberts combined his interest in spiritualism  with a rabid free-thought fervor that opposed  \"Christian spiritualism\" and sought to disprove  Christianity through the mediated discourses of  Apollonius of Tyana and others who demonstrated  that Christ was really Apollonius and  Christianity really Buddhism, and that both had  been delivered by the spirits and then perverted  by \"the priests\" (Eusebius and the Council of  Nicaea) into the form we have today.  Roberts was  vociferous and unrelenting, and the following  diatribe was a not untypical example of the  entertaining rhetoric that graced the pages of  Mind and Matter: \"a groundless, gratuitous,  absurd, ridiculous, evil-intended, silly,  uncouth, shameless, 'black-lie,' from first to  last, inside and out.\"  Quoted in W.E. Coleman,  \"Pappus and the Synodikon.-'Scholastic Nescience'  Ventilated,\" Mind and Matter, July 16, 1881, 8.  Crabtree 1007.  Boston Public Library microfilm;  LOC; University of Rochester; Ohio Newspaper  Project; Library Company of Philadelphia  (complete run).\n\n The periodical of choice for free-thought, pro-phenomena, stridently-defensive American Spiritualism in the late 1870s and early 1880s. The editor, Jonathan M. Roberts, was a controversial and combative figure within the movement. Contributors include many Spiritualists whose work does not appear in The Banner of Light, The Religio-Philosophical Journal or The Carrier Dove.<\/td> <\/tr>  Issues:Mind And Matter V1 N1 November 30
