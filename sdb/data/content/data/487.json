[Hesearch. Jan., 1917.\nMORE ABOUT DREAMsI'-\nBy Dr. F. C. S. Schiller.\nDr. Jacks's reply to my comments on his article (see Journal,\nJuly, 1916) reveals, as I expected, so much agreement between\nus that I am tempted to carry a little further the discussion\nof our differences. I agree of course that dreams have never\nhad justice done them and that the interpretation ordinarily\nplaced upon them is by no means the only one conceivable nor\nphilosophically the most adequate. But we do not quite agree\nabout the number of parties to a dream that should be recog-\nnized. I distinguish three, (1) the waking self, (2) the dreamer,\nand (3) the (unknown) maker of the dream. He analyses out\nfour, (1)\n'\nSmithi', who remembers the dream, (2)\n'\nSmithj'\n'\nasleep and dreaming,\" (3)\n'\nSmithg', the dream-duellist, and\n(4) his '\nantagonist '\n\u2014in the dream\u2014who is not, apparently,\nany sort of '\nSmith.' In this classification I cannot follow\nthe distinction between '\nSmith2' and '\nSmith,,' : surely, unless\n'\nSmith,' is the body, the sleeper who dreams is precisely\nthe duellist, and the dixel is what he dreams. The whole\nof it is at least real in his dream, and real with all its inci-\ndents, the fighters, and the rapiers, daggers or pistols they\nfight with. Nothing can deprive the duel of its reality,\nrelatively to the dream, so long as '\nSmithy' remembers it.\nBut this settles nothing as to the question whether the dream\nhas any other and higher reality as well.\nOrdinarily, no doubt, we deny to dreams any further reality,^\nand attribute to them reality in the dreamer's experience alone.\nThis, I agree, is unproved and arbitrary and begs an important\nquestion. And there are other interpretations which have\nbeen believed, and should be investigated. Thus (1) it may\nbe that the dream is not merely a subjective experience, but\nshared by others, who dream it too. If so. Dr. Jacks's\nantagonist may be a real person, and the suggestion of cross-\ncorresponding dreams has my entire sympathy. Indeed, they\nseem to occur, though rarely, and the Society has recorded\nsome examples, e.g. the prototype of Kipling's Brnshwood Boy\n1 For tlie clirt'eront soils of rnality. see my Prosiilpntial Addicss, Proc,\nVol. XXVII.. pp. 212-19.\n\fJan., 1917. More about Drea.ms. 3\nin the Journal, Vol. I. p. 353. Or again (2) the dream may\niiiean something objective, and be a divinely-sent warning,\nlike Nebuchadnezzar's and Agamemnon's. Freud's theory also\nis of this type. (3) The close resemblance between dream-life\nand real life, between dream-worlds and the physical world,\nsuggests a still bolder and more realistic interpretation. In\nall philosophic essentials there is no difference. Both the\n'\nreal '\nworld and the dream-worlds are in space and time,\nare subject to change and motion, and are inhabited by\npersons and things. It can be held, therefore, that the\ndream-worlds really exist, and that the only advantage the\n'\nreal ' w^oiid has over them is that w'e inhabit it longer\nand more frequently. But what after all are three score\nyears and ten ? ilight we not awake some day from our\npresent nightmare and find that it had occupied only a few\nmoments in the time of a more real world ? It seems to\nme that there is much consolation in this thought, though\nits statement has to be guarded in several directions.^\nIt is clear that upon this interpretation also Dr. Jacks's\nantagonist in the duel may be a real person. But I do not\nsee how he can satisfy his curiosity about him, without inquiring\nhow he, himself, or his dream-representative, got into the\ndream. And this leads us back to the making of the dream,\nwhich seems to me to be the essential crux. That in his\nclream-duel Dr. Jacks should have had an antagonist seems\nas natural as that he should have had a weapon. But who\nor what constructed the dream and arranged the duel ? The\nwaking self obviously was not to blame ; it only '\nremembered\n'\nthe dream after it had happened. Nor can the dreamer be\ncredited with a plot and a denouement he did not foresee\nfor him the w^hole affair was as real and objective and inde-\npendent of him as anything in the performances of waking\nlife. I can only conclude, therefore, that if '\nSally Beauchamp\n'\nin Dr. Morton Prince's classic case was not the beginning of\na clue to this puzzle, science must at present confess itself\nnonplussed. She clearly had the sort of imagination and of\nmental attitude which characterizes the '\nmakers ' of most of\nour dreams.\n1 Cf. Studies in Humanism, i).\n48.5.\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1917.\nDRAMATIC DREAMS.\nBy Ernest S. Thomas.\nMembers of the Society will have read with great interest Dr.\nJacks's instructive article on dreams in the May number of the\nJournal, in which he contends that the dramatis personae of\nthe kind of dream he discusses are extraneous to the dreamer.\nI hope in the following notes to show that there are experiences\nof an intermediate nature which throw light upon the sources\nof these dreams.\nThe following are the jjoints ujjon which Dr. Jacks lays stress :\n(1) There is no reason why 1 should experience surprise or\nhorror if my own mind is the source of the dream-content ; the\nmind cannot prepare surprises for itself.\n(2) The explanation that my mind is the agent breaks down\nbecause there are three agents, the dreamer and two dream-\npersonalities.\nNow the first suggestion that I wish to put forward is that all\ndreams of a dramatic kind are not so completely \" rounded off\n\"\nas those Dr. Jacks relates. They have a tendency to \"fizzle out\"\nby taking a ridiculous turn.\nI dreamt, for instance, the following dream, which is traceable\nto no known experience of my own. I was one of a large\ncongregation seated on chairs in the open air facing the east\nnear the time of sunset : we were all gazing upwards and east-\nwards when ])resently an object appeared in mid-air rapidly\napproaching. It resolved itself into a great eagle bearing in\nits talons a huge golden lion. The bird remained poised before\nus : its plumes flashing as it beat its wings : the lion illumined\nin the most natural and glorious way by the sunset light. It\nwas a majestic sight, and my feelings were those of deepest\nawe. There were other striking and consistent phases in the\ndream, but the point I would emphasise is that presently the\nlion appeared as a miserable little leonine cur, running about\nand wagging its tail ingratiatingly. It was all one dream, and\nthe obvious question presents itself : \u2014if the anticlimax was inspired\nor produced by an agency other than my mind, then are not\nall dreams surely so produced ? The more obvious conclusion\nis that the whole thing was the ])roduct of my own \" mind.\"\nBut is there any evidence from which we can infer that Mr.\n\fJan., li)17. Dramatic Dreams. 6\nJacks's first contention does not bold good ? I think there is ;\nnamely, in the experiments in hypnotism jierformed by Professor\nand Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr. Smith at Brighton. ' On one occasion\nan attempt was made to induce the perci])ient to see a choir-\nboy on a card. What he saw was a ghost, which he described\nwith some emotion. It may still be contended that the source\nof the dream was \" extraneous,\" nevertheless the form it took,\ngiving rise to feelings one should not have at the products of\none's own imagination and which the agents did not intend, was\nclearly woven by the percipient's mind.\nAgain, there is Gurney's famous experiment m which the\n))ercipient read from a book and at the same time endeavoured\nto do an arithmetical calculation on the planchette. The result\nwas astonishing. The unpleasant \" mental \" sensations occasioned\nby the ])sychic stress of the attempted operation produced a\nterrifying dream, in which the percipient \" got into bed \" (alle-\ngorical of giving up the experiment) to escape his unpleasant\nvisitant. Here is a clear case of terror occasioned at a phantom\nraised by the mind of the terrified dreamer.\nReaders of the Proceedings will ere this have seen the direction\nin which these quoted cases point, namely, that the phenomenon\nis to be explained by some theory of multiple ])ersonality.\nThe Beauchamp case comes to mind, bringing us to Dr. Jacks's\nsecond point. In this case the physical Miss Beauchamp as\nBii suffered so many things at the hands of Sally (Bm), of\nwhose existence she (B,i) Avas, as Miss Beauchamp, totally\noblivious. That this is the true explanation, namely, the temporary\nsubdivision of the personality into temporarily distinct more or\nless rational entities, is to be inferred from an interesting experi-\nment of Myers, when he attempted, and finally managed, to\nbe conscious as Myers in liis dream, and betook himself to\nstudying his surroundings in the dream-room with keen and\ncautious interest lest he should waken himself by any emotional\ndisplay of feehng. In his case his dream- weaving \" self \" and\nhis normal rational self (the latter awake and not asleep as in\na normal dream), are completely rounded ofi. In an attempt\nI made myself I was only partially successful. I had the same\nfeehng of elation at being \"awake\" in my dream (in a picture-\npost-card shop), and attempted to prove to myself that \" I\n\"\nwas in a dream-shop by showing a friend a post-card of a\nigcc Pwc. S.P.E., Vol. VI., p. 128.\n\f6 Journal of Society fur Psychical Research. Jan., 1917.\ncastle and asking him to say what it was. Elation at his reply\n(that it was a bird) awoke me. Unless my friend and i were\nboth present in \" spirit \" in the dream-shop (as I take it Mr.\nJacks would contend) my reasoning powers were not fully opera-\ntive ; I did not realize (on my hypothesis) that my friend was as\nmuch a figment of my dream-weaving \" personality \" as the shop.\nBut it is not necessary to invoke the theory of multiple per-\nsonality to give a plausible explanation of a dream in which the\ndreamer experiences emotions such as the products of his own\n\"imagination\" should not normally afford. There is the \"critical\"\nstate of mind (to employ an expression borrowed from physical\nscience, which denotes the condition of matter wlien it is neither\ngaseous nor liquid, but between the two), when one is hovering\non the boundary between sleeping and waking, in a hypnoidal\nstate.\nIt may be of interest to quote an experience of my own in\nthis state. Lying in a chair with eyes closed, fully conscious\nof my position, and that if I opened my eyes all would disappear,\nI saw before me a large illuminated missal, as bright as though\nilluminated by the sunshine that actually filled my room. I\nstudied the lectures with interest, noting the gleam of light\nwhere the gilding curved with the page, and the grain of the\npaper, and the way it \" took \" the different colours. When I turned,\nas it were, to think upon what I saw, I remember that the picture\ngrew dimmer. It was clearly a case of fluttering on the border-\nland between full awareness of mind and semi-consciousness. This\nwas further borne out by the fact that while I fancied I was\nreading the book, attention to what I was mentally repeating\nas I read showed that it was utter nonsense. \" Let us see,\" I\nthought, \" whether that is really what is written.\" I looked\nfixedly at the page to read the characters and was conscious of\na sensation of strain which I had not felt on studying the pictures :\nI found that an effort of imagination was required to see the\nwords I was reading, i.e. I found that I thought the words\nfirst and then saw them. As in hypnotic cases where the subject's\nidea.s of the rational are strained too far (perhaps also from a\ncause similar to that in the Gurney experiment quoted above),\nI came fully to myself and the book disappeared. I would\npoint out that wonder and surprise at seeing the book so clearly\nand vividly was a pervading emotion of this \" dream.\"\n\fJan., 1917. Review. 7\nREVIEW.\nRaymond. ; or, Life awl Death. By Sm Oliver Lodge. (Methnen\n& Co., London. 10s. 6d. net.)\nPsychical researchers have often been indebted to Sir Oliver\nLodge for his writings on matters which especially interest them\nand attract their investigation, but probably never before have\nthey been laid unrler so great obligation as they are by his\nlatest production, Raymond. To produce it required not only\nexpert knowledge of the ways and methods of psychically\nendowed persons generally classed as mediuins ; but further\ndemanded a frankness and a courage which are even less\ncommonly met with, and there can be little doubt but that\nits ]3erusal will greatly stimulate the serious consideration of\na subject the importance of which can scarcely be exaggerated.\nSir Oliver divides his work into three parts.\nIn the first he, as it were, introduces us to his gallant son.\nA selection of his correspondence from the seat of war\ndiscloses to us a brave young officer, and bears testimony, as\ndo many similar narratives, to a cheerful endurance of hard-\nships whose existence he scarcely admits, but is sadly and\namply evidenced from other soixrces\u2014hardships, moreover,\nincidental to a career which would not have been chosen\nsave at the distinct and conscientiously recognised call of\nduty. In this respect Raymond Avas one of a class numerou.sly\nrepresented in these sad and strenuous days, and of whom\nBritain has every reason to be proud. Many have written,\nthough perhaps rarely with a view to publication, similar\nbright accounts of their experiences in the stormy Front,\ncalculated and intended, by no means insincerely, to cheer and\nkeejj ivp the spirits of the loved ones at home. Raymond\nendured the hardships of war. though he never described\nthem as hardships, from joining the expeditionarj^ force in\nMarch, 19L5, until his fatal wound and death in the following\nSeptember, and a more attractive personality it would be\ndifficult to present.\nThere could scarcely be a more appropriate introduction\nthan this to the second part, which gives us the substance\nand often the detail of many communications made to various\nmembers of the family since the death. Some of these are\nadmittedly of interest only from the evidential point of view.\nWe say \" only,\" but scientifically regarded this is certainly\nthe most important aspect of the case. On the other hand,\nmany of the messages, though not in a strict sense evidential,\nare on the personal side of intense interest, an interest which\nis intensified by the introduction in Part I. which has been\nreferred to.\n\fJotivnai uf Society for Psychical Researcli. .Tan., iniT.\nTt would be futile to attempt within the brief limits imposed\nby this Journal to illustrate or to convey an adequate imjDres-\nsion of the various commxinications. Critics of such messages\nhave often complained of the triviality or even flippancy of\nwhat the departed say or purport to say. No such charge\ncan be urged against the matter here presented to us. Much\nground is covered, sometimes with mediums, often without,\nsometimes by automatic writing, sometimes by speech, the way\nbeing led in quite characteristic manner by our old friend Mr.\nMyers, but the matter is intensely serious and some of it even\nsacred. In Part III., which discusses the philosophy of the\nwhole question, quotations from the writings of the late Mr.\nStainton Moses sufficiently establish the .serious side of many\ncommunications, and no doubt many messages that are not\nand never Avill be published are of the sanie effect. At the\nsame time, the writer warns us that experiments in this matter\nare not to be lightly undertaken. Efforts made in this direction\nare likely to be responded to in the spirit in which they are\nmade, and it is far worse than useless to enter upon them\nunder the prompting of a prurient curiosity ; and it may be\nadded that in any case the greatest caution should be exercised\nin having recourse to a professional medium.\nIt is the less necessary to dwell at length on the records\nof the many sittings, inasmuch as they were reported at length\nby Sir Oliver himself in a paper read by him at a jorivate\nmeeting of the Society in June last, and this paper has since\nappeared with additions in the latest number of our Proceedings.\nThe third part, as alread}^ said, is devoted to a consideration\nof the phenomena from a scientific, and even in some degree\nfrom a religious point of view. Of course opinions will differ\nwidely as to the degree of acceptance which is to be accorded\nto the revelations of another sphere of life here set forth.\nObdurate sceptics and perhaps rigidly orthodox believers will\nhave none of it. The Times reviewer wants time to make\nup his mind respecting a matter so great and so new to him ;\nbut the least that can be said is that an exposition so com-\nprehensive, so lucid and so candid Avill be of great assistance\nto all who devote serious thought to the subject, and it may\nwell be anticipated that many will in future adopt a view of\nthe allegations and possibilities of spiritualism widely different\nfrom those which thev have hitherto entertained.\n'\nH.

Long read a paper on The \" Psycho-\nAnalytic Use of Subliminal Material,\" which, it is hoped, will\nbe published later in the Proceedings.\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1916.\nOnce again we have to present oar Annual Report whilst Europe\nis still lying under the burden of war. The general effect of\nexisting conditions upon the work of the Society was described\nin our last report, and there is little to add.\nIn the course of the year 28 new Members were elected,\nincluding one Honorary Member ; 52 new Associates were\nelected and 5 Members became Associates. On the other\nhand the total loss in numbers, from resignations, deaths,\nand other causes, was 12 Members and 99 Associates, making\na net decrease of 31.\nThe total Membership is now 1085, the numbers being dis-\nt]ibuted as follows : Members, 274 (including 27 Honorary\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb.-BIah., 1917.\nand Corresponding Members) ;\nAssociates, 811 (including 13\nHonorary Associates).\nAn unusually large proportion of the loss in membership is\ncaused by failure to renew subscriptions without formal resig-\nnation. There have been 50 such cases in 1916, as compared\nwith an annual average of 30 for the five years 1909-1913.\nFor this increase there is no doubt that the war is partly\nresponsible ; for in 12 cases the Associates who have been cut\noff reside in countries with which England is now at war, and\n5 Russian Associates have failed to send their subscriptions\nowing to temporary postal difficulties. Amongst Members\nnormally resident in England who have failed to renew their\nsubscriptions there are several whom we know to be absent on\nwork connected with the war.\nOf the 51 formal resignations which have been received during\nthe year, 14 are definitely stated to be due to the war. In 26\ncases no reason is given, but in four of these regret is expressed.\nIn only one case has there been any expression of dissatis-\nfaction with the Society's work.\nThe opportunity for experiment has again been restricted by\nthe circumstance that for certain kinds of experiment medical\nassistance is desirable, and the additional strain which the war\nhas imposed upon all members of the medical profession is\nsuch that they have scant leisure for any work outside their\nprofessional duties. Moreover, one of our Honorary Secretaries,\nMr. Feilding, by whom investigations on behalf of the Society\nare frequently undertaken, is still absent on Government service.\nOnly one part of the Proceedings has been published during\nthe past year. The intention had been to publish it in October,\nbut it was unavoidably delayed owing to the printers being short-\nhanded, and did not appear until the end of November. It\nis hoped that another small Part will be published in March\nand a further Part in the Summer to complete the volume.\nBut it is likely that for the present our publications may be\nslightly reduced in bulk, since the same causes which have\nlimited the opportunity for experiment operate also in regard\nto matter for printing.\nWe noted last year that the war had not caused any increase\nin the number of spontaneous experiences reported to the\nSociety. The number of war-cases continues to be small, but\n\fFeb. -Mak., 1917. Report of the Council for the Year 1916. 1-\")\nin the course qf ilii's last year we have printed in the Journal\na report of an apparition at the time of death in the battle of\nJutland, an'd 'of a dreain, perhaps connected with the same\nbattle. We 'hdve also received, and hope to print soon, a\nreport of the apparition of an officer, shortly after he had been\nwounded at the front. There has been a welcome increase\nlately in the number of cases reported to us of veridical\napparitions of the living. During the five years, 1911-191.5,\nonly 5 such cases were reported in which the evidence was\nsufficiently strong to warrant publication. During the last\nyear we have received three ;\nfor, in addition to the two\nmentioned above, a third, which had no connexion with the\nwar, was printed in the Journal for November-December.\nIn the Journal for May we printed an article by Dr. L. P.\nJacks on \" Dramatic Dreams,\" in which the author called\nattention to the \" virtually unexplored territory awaiting the\npsychologist who would devote himself to the study of those\ndreams which form part of our normal experience, as distinct\nfrom dreams affording evidence of supernormal phenomena, tele-\npathy, e.g., or premonition. There is no doubt that useful\nwork might be done in this field. Hitherto systematic study of\ndream-phenomena has for the most part been confined to\nmedical men, who have considered them primarily from a\nmedical standpoint, and have therefore given their chief\nattention to pathological cases. There have also been a few\ncases in which the dreamer has studied his own dreams, but\nthis method is open to one objection ; for dreams, like other\nmental phenomena which are not under conscious control,\nappear to be easily influenced by suggestion, so that by per-\nsistently studying and analysing his dreams a man may uncon-\nsciously mould them to suit whatever theory he forms. What\nseems to be first required in order to provide material for\nresearch is that a large number of people should during a\ncertain period keep careful and complete records of all their\ndreams, so far as they can remember them. The task of\nsifting and tabulating this material would not be easy, but the\nresult might prove of great value to psychology.\nWide-spread interest has been aroused by the publication of\nSir Oliver Lodge's book \" Eaymond or Life and Death,\" part\nof which also appeared in the last part of Proceedings, under\n\foo OO0O'HOi?;(M0T*iC00!M'^OtCOL'^\n0000'->iUpOO\u00ab0>^eOOOOJOiC,I>OW\nT-P r-(r-1i-jr-; rir-t-\nCD rH (N\no\no\n1\u2014\n1\nCO CD\n00\n(N\nooo\nooo\no in\no\no\no :\n^\u2022^\n\u2022\u2022 . y,\ng K \u2014\nc3 o cj\n.H \"CM\n0\\ CX)\nI-t\nCO 00\n3\n60\noooo\noooo\nCI CI\no\nI\nCO O r-l O\nCI iH rH T-H\n.2-- S\ne\"^ \u00b0 2\nr-fcl C \" <B\n\"30 C3fs5!\u00bb\n\"5 -a btS\no, o ^ P!\nm y S =?\nCO i5\n\u202243^\nr +5\nS c3 PI\nC ^, tD\n-2 \" S\nS a \u00b0\n\u00a7.2\n5\nPOD\n\u00a72\n\u2022S Si oT\n.2 ,= 3'\n\u00a33 i= \u00ab\n!-! o\nbo <^ \u2022\nc c .\n\"3 O t-\no\nSo 3\n, CD ,\na\nIf\nd 2 t\u00ab\n^ fe.2\ng g S\nli\nrt o\nC <u.2\nC 3 C\nci o a\n<u 5\no o\ncc\nS\n.-I C<\nfa c :\n\"\no\nI\u2014\n(\nlOO O o ir:\"\u00a9 o cooo o\nOl o o o l>- i>-oo\nrH T-H t-l I\u2014\n1\nCO iH lO O COfH T-l CO CslOO\no 'OOO ?D\nI> tMi-H ur:.

Whatever difference\nof opinion there may be about the value, from the point of\nview in question, of this evidence\u2014which includes of course\nthat derived from cross-correspondences\u2014it cannot be denied\nthat there has been an increase in the amoimt presented\nby the Society and deserving of serious consideration, as\ncompared to what was obtained in the first twenty-five years\nof the Society's existence.\nMiss Alice Johnson, who has been absent from work during\nthe whole year for reasons of health, has resigned her appoint-\nment as Research Officer and Editor, and the Council has\nappointed Mrs. Salter to be Editor and Honorary Research\nOfficer.

We trust, moreover, that Miss\nJohnson will not cease to interest herself in the investigations\nwhich the Society exists to promote, and in particular that she\nwill continue her study of automatic writing, which has already\nresulted in so many valuable contributions to the Society's work.\nThe Council record with much regret the loss which the\nSociety has sustained in the death of Mrs. A.

Apparition.\nWe print below a report of an apparition seen by Mrs. S.\nJones, living at Enfield, Gateshead, of her son-in-law, Lieut.\nG. E. W. Bridge, Durham Light Infantry, shortly after he\nhad been wounded in France, but before any news of his\nbeing wounded had reached his family.\nIt will be observed that Mrs. Jones did not mention her\nexperience to any one until after she knew of its veridical\ncharacter, but we have been able by means of certain corro-\nborative evidence to estabHsh a very strong probability that\nMrs. Jones's recollection of what took place is substantially\naccurate. Under these circumstances we feel justified in putting\nthe case on record, all the more that it presents one curious\nfeature which will interest all who concern themselves with the\npsychological peculiarities of these phenomena.\nOur earliest information was contained in a letter from\nLi^ut. Bridge, as follows :\nEnfield, Gateshead,\nNovember 2, 1916.\nThe following presents an unusual feature to me\u2014but possibly\nyou can explain it.\nMy age is 34.\nI was wounded in France July 24th, 1916, 3.30 p.m.\nBetween 1 and 2 a.m. July 26th, 1916, I appeared to Mrs. S.\nJones (my wife's mother) at this address, waldug her from sleep.\nThe physical appearance corresponded with that of a photo\ntaken when I was about 3 years old\u2014the head was bandaged\nshewing only forehead\u2014eyes\u2014nose\u2014mouth, and a little of the chin.\nExcept for the age and apparent height (only head was seen\nclearly)\u2014this was the condition I was in, and I was in hospital\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli. Feb.-Mar., 1917.\nat Boulogne\u2014to the best of my recollection asleep, and of course\nwith. 2 days' growth of beard.\nThe apparition was taken for my son \" in the flesh \" at fii'st\nand was asked what was the matter. Mrs. Jones then recognized\nme\u2014I smiled and vanished.\nThe War Office telegram announcing the casualty was received\nat 9 p.m., July 26th.\nMrs. Jones did not know me till I was about 19\u2014at which\ntime and ever since I have had a small moustache\u2014and she\nalways thinks of me as grown up\u2014never as a chUd. In these\ncircumstances, can you explain why I should appear as a child\nand not in my most easily recognizable form ?\nThat I appeared to Mrs. Jones I can understand as she is\nmore psychic than my wife.\nG. E. W. Bridge, Lt. Durh. L.I.\nThe above is substantially correct. I might add that I had\nnot looked at the photograph mentioned for at least 4 years.\nE. M. Jones.\nIn reply to this letter we wrote to Lieut. Bridge asking\nfor a detailed report b} Mrs. Jones herself and a corroborative\nstatement, if obtainable, from some person to whom she had\nrelated her experience before the news came that Lieut. Bridge\nwas wounded. We received an answer from Mrs. Bridge as\nfollows :\n'\nEnfield, Gateshead,\nNovember 5, 1916.\nMy husband has just returned to duty. ... I enclose a full\naccount \\vritten by Mrs. Jones, of her experience of July 26th.\nThis corresponds with ,her description to me on August 5th.\nI see that it is unfortunate, from the point of view of '\nevidence,'\nthat she told no one before this date. I can only say that as\nfar as we ourselves are concerned, this makes no difference, as\nwe do not admit the possibility of her altering the facts, even\ninvoluntarily. She is particularly clear-headed and well-balanced,\nand when relating one or two rather similar experiences, I have\nnever known her vary in the accounts in the slightest degree.\nI am not surprised that my husband should appear to her,\n\u2014\nthey have often discussed such things, and are much in sympathy\n\u2014though the '\nleast-familiar '\nform has puzzled us ail. . . .\nMargaret E. Bridge.\n\fFeb -Mae., 1917. Cases. 21\n{Statement by Mrs. Jones, enclosed in Mrs. Bridge's letter of\nNovember 5, 1916.)\nEnfield, Gate-shkad.\nDuring the early morning of Wed., July 26th, 1916, I woke\nfrom sleep, with the idea that someone was in my room. I\nopened my eyes to absolute darkness, but at the right side of\nmy bed stood a misty figure, which I at first took for my little\ngrandson, and I asked him why he was there. No answer came,\nbut the face became more distinct, and I saw it resembled a\nphotograph of my son-in-law, taken when he was about three\nyears old. In the photogTaph one can see short curls, but in\nmy vision the lower part of forehead, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth\nand part of chin were clearly visible, but hair, ears, lower part\nof chin and neck were hidden by white wrappings. As I looked\nand wondered, the mouth expanded into a smile, and the appear-\nance vanished, the room being still in darkness. My grandson\nhad not been quite well the previous day, and my first thought\nwas to go and see if he were worse, but as I knew his mother\nhad settled to sleep in his room, I decided not to risk alarming\nher.\nI did not mention the occurrence to anyone, as we only had\nservants in the house, and naturally I did not want to say\nanything to my daughter at once. I made up my mind to wait\nuntil she had had a letter from her husband of later date than\nJuly 26th, and then tell her how anxious I had felt.\nThe W.O. wire came on the evening of July 26th, and in the\nrush and hurry of her departure I had no chance to tell her\nuntil she came home on Aug. 5th for a couple of nights, leaving\nher husband in hospital. When I described what I had seen,\nshe told me that his head and neck were bandaged in that way.\nI could understand his appearing to me as he looks normally,\nas we have been great friends, and I have made my home with\nthem for some years. The puzzle is why he should appear to\nme as a young chHd. Ellen M. Jones.\nWe then wrote to Mrs. Bridge, putting the following ques-\ntions :\n(a) Is it possible to get any evidence corroborating Mrs.\nJones's recollection that her experience took place in the early\nmorning of July 26, 1916 : e.g. Mrs. Jones mentions that your\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb.-Mam., 1917.\nson had been unwell on the previous day ; have you any\nevidence as to when he was imwell ?\n(b) When did you first know the iiature of the wound\nfrom which Lieut. Bridge was suffering ? Were any details\non this point given in the War Ofl&ce telegram ?\n(c) Has this telegram been preserved, and can we see it ?\n{d) How old is yom- son now, and is he noticeably like\nthe photograph of his father to which Mrs. Jones refers ?\n(c) Is there any reason to suppose that when Lieut. Bridge\nwas a young child, i.e. at about the time when this photograph\nwas taken, he had an accident which necessitated the bandaging\nof his head ?\nThe object of these last questions, (d) and (e), was to see\nwhether any association of ideas could be fomid in the mind\nof Mrs. Jones which would account for the circumstance that\nshe saw the apparition of Lieut. Bridge in the shape of a\nphotograph of him taken as a child many years before she\nknew him. The fact that Mrs. Jones had been concerned\nabout her grandson's health on the pre\\aous day might account\nfor her momentarily identifying the apparition with this boy\nas she did (see above), but there was no apparent link with\nthe photograph of Lieut. Bridge.\nTo these questions Mrs. Bridge replied as follows :\nEnfield, Gateshead,\nNovember 18, 1916.\n{a) My boy used to suffer very much from asthma. Last\nJuly he had a very slight return of this, following an attack\nof hay-fever. I noted in my diary that I kept him in bed on\nSunday. July 23rd. On the 25th he was \" decidedly better\n\"\nbut still in bed, and I continued to sleep in his room. On the\nmorning of the 26th he was \" practically all right,\" and on the\n27th was out of doors again.\n(b) My husband was wounded by shrapnel, all down the left\nside. I first knew the locality of the wounds on the morning\nof July 28th, when I received by the first post (1) a few lines\nscribbled by my husband in the trenches, at 4.30 p.m., on the\n24th :\n\" I'm hit slightly in the face and arm. Shell. Merely skin\nwounds. Don't worry.\" And (2) a letter from his Coy. Commander\nof same date ; \"He was hit by little bits of a 4-2 shell\u2014slightly\n\fFeb. -Mae., 1917. Gases. 23\nin face, arm and leg.\" I knew no further particulars until I\nsaw him in hospital in London on July 29th. The W.O. telegram\ndoes not say anything about the locality of the wounds.\n(c) I have this telegram before me now. ... I quote it in\nfull:\n\"York O.H.M.S. 8.15 p.m. Received Newcastle July 26.\n8.26 p.m.\n\" Mrs. Bridge. Enfield. Gateshead.\n\" Regret Capt.^ G. E. W.

A taxi arrived at almost the same moment to take\na visitor to the station and I sent a maid with her, to despatch\na telegram from Newcastle to the Hospital at Boulogne.\n((?) My boy was 10 years old on July 27th, and was never\nparticularly like the photo in question. But Mrs. Jones used\nto remark on my girl's resemblance to the photo, when she was\nabout 3 years old. She is now 1\\, but when a baby, 9 months\nold, she had an operation which necessitated a head-bandage.\nMrs. Jones saw the child, on one occasion only, and for a few\nminutes, with this bandage. We none of us know of any accident\nto my husband which would have made it necessary for him to\nhave his head bound up. Margaret E. Bridge.\nTo this letter Mrs. Jones added a note, thus :\nWhen the telegram came telling us of my son-in-law's wound,\nI at once concluded he had been wounded on the Tuesday night\n(July 25, 1916), and was surprised when we heard later that it\nwas on the Monday afternoon. g j^j Jojjgg\nWe have also received an additional commiinication from\nLieut. Bridge, as follows :\nNovember 9, 1916.\n. . . From a purely evidential point of view, it is a weak\npoint that Mrs. Jones did not mention her experience till the\nfirst opportunity after the news, but a comment of my wife's\nwhen telling me of it is to a certain extent corroborative : \"I\n^ Lieut. Bridge had held a temporary captaincy in a xsserve battahon\n\"before proceeding to the front. Hence the use of this] title in the telegram.\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb. -biar., 1917.\nthought she had something on her mind that day\u2014she was so\nrestless and fidgetty\u2014and seemed relieved when the telegram\ncame.\"\nUsually Mrs. Jones is particularly self-controlled and possessed.\nI think you have hit upon the solution of the form of the\nphantasm.\nMy daughter when about the same age looked very like the\nphoto, and when young had an operation which necessitated a\nhead bandage very similar to the one I had. This in conjunction\nwith the keen sympathy existing in the family suggests a very\nfeasible train of thought\u2014especially on just awakening from sleep.\nThis explanation to my mind counteracts the other defect\nslightly, as in the case of moulding an indistinct presentiment\nor an intelligent anticipation upon a known fait accompli, the\ncomplication of the child-like appearance would not have been\nadded.\nAnother factor is that Mrs. Jones (her daughter, and I to a\nless extent) is so accustomed to this tyjae of experience that there\nis no question of fear confusing the impression received.^\nG. E. W. Bridge, Lt.\nIt is established on the above evidence that Lieut. Bridge\nwas wounded on the afternoon of July 24, 1916, and was\nadmitted to hospital at Boulogne on the following day ; the\nnews of Ills being wounded was first conveyed to his family\nat Gateshead by an official telegram (which we have seen)\nreceived at Newcastle at 8.26 p.m. on July 26, 1916.\nWith regard to the date and circumstances of Mrs. Jones's\nexperience, it should be noted :\n{a) That she related it verbally to Mrs. Bridge on August\n5, 1916, and this original statement\u2014as Mrs. Bridge tells us\n\u2014\nwas substantially the same as the statement printed above.\n(6) Mrs. Jones notes that she at fii'st mistook the appari-\ntion for her grandson. He \" had not been quite well the\n1 An acoouut of several of these earlier experiences has been sent to us\nby Mrs. Jones \"not for publication.\" They are all of an hallucinatory\ncharacter, and include (i) two visual hallucinations, apparently premonitory\n;\n(ii) a visual hallucination (of a fully developed figure) for whicn Mrs. Jones\ncannot account in any way. So far as she is aware it was subjective\nand not veridical ;\n(iii) an auditory hallucination, contemporaneous with\nthe sudden iUness (a fainting-fit) of the person whose voice was heard.\n\fFeb.-Mae., 1917. Cases.\nprevious day and my first thought was to go and see if he\nwere worse, but as I knew his mother had settled to sleep\nin his room, I decided not to risk alarming her.\" The boy\n\u2022\n\u2014as noted at the time in Mrs. Bridge's diary\u2014was in bed\non July 23 with a sUght attack of asthma, on July 25 he\nwas \"decidedly better,\" \"but still in bed,\" and Mrs. Bridge\nwas sleeping in his room. On July 26 he was \" practically\nall right.\" The evidence of the diary, therefore, corroborates\nMrs. Jones's recollection that her experience took place on the\nnight of July 25-26, 1916, or at least not later than this.\n(c) Mrs. Jones saw Lieut. Bridge with his head bandaged, as it\nactually was at the time. The fact that Lieut. Bridge had\nbeen womided in the head was not 1-aiown to any of his\nfamily imtil July 28, 1916.\n{(1) As Lieut. Bridge has pointed out, the particular form\nwhich Mrs. Jones ascribes to the apparition strengthens the\nprobability that she is relating what she actually saw. If\nher mind had created an imaginary experience after she knew\nthat Lieut. Bridge was womided, she would almost certainly\nhave imagined that she saw him as he then was, a grown\nman.\nWith regard to the form of the apparition, a not unlikely\nexplanation is afforded by the fact that Lieut. Bridge's daughter\n\u2014whose likeness as a small child to the photograph of her\nfather had been commented on by Mrs. Jones\u2014had worn a\nhead-bandage for a short time, when she was a baby. This\ncircumstance was known to Mrs. Jones, and her mind may\nhave followed a line of associated ideas, thus :\nLieut. Bridge with bandaged head. (Telepathic impression.)\nLieut. Bridge's daughter with bandaged head. (Memory.)\nPhotograph of Lieut. Bridge which his daughter had much\nresembled. (Memory.\n)\nResult. Apparition of Lieut. Bridge, as he appears in the\nphotograph, but with bandaged head.\nII.\nL. 1210. Two Co-incidental Dreams.\nThe following report has been sent to us through Mr. George\nTyrrell, an Associate of the Society, who is personally ac-\nquainted with the dreamers. The names and addresses of\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb.-Mae., 1917.\nall the persons concerned have been sent to us, but we have\nbeen requested not to print them.\nThe case is of an unusual type in that two people during\nthe same night had dreams which, while differing in detail,\npresented the same central incident, and this dream-incident\nappears to have reflected an actual event occurring at the\ntime, of which the dreamers had no normal knowledge. There\nare several cases on record of collective veridical hallucinations.\nThe case reported here seems to have been both collective and\nveridical, but the collective impression was received during\nsleep in the shape of a dream.\nThe dreamers were Mr. C. W. Lawson and his daughter,\nMiss E. Lawson (pseudonyms). Mr. Lawson's statement is\nas follows :\n[Enclosed in a letter from Mr. Tyrrell, dated November 21,\n1916.1]\nLast July, when my daughter and I were staying in Somerset-\nshire, I had a very vivid 'dream. I dreamed that I was in a\nbedroom, and saw lying on the floor my brother-in-law [Mr. R.\nStephen (pseudonym)] ; he was unconscious and looked perfectly\nghastly. With some difiiculty I lifted him on to the bed ; as far\nas I could see, he was not breathing and I could feel no motion\nof his heart. I sprinkled some water on his face, but this having\nno effect, I ran to the door and called for assistance. No one\ncame, so I ran out into the road where I saw two men and a\nwoman. I told them that some one was very ill and asked\nthem to go to the nearest public-house and bring some brandy ;\nboth the men refused, saying that the public-houses were closed,\nbut the woman seeing my distress said she would try and get\nsome, and I gave her Is. for the purpose. She, however, did\nnot come back again. On returning to the bedroom I found\nmy brother-in-law lying just as I had left him. I then hunted\nover the house, but could find no one. I was in a terrible state\nof anxiety and distress not knowing what to do, and being\npretty sure in my mind that he was dead. I then, just as I\nwas giving all up in despair, awoke and rejoiced to know that\nit was only a dream.\nNext morning I told my daughter of my dream while we were\nat breakfast, and she said, \" How very curious. I, too, have\n1 Mr. La'wson cannot remember on ^^\u2022hat daj' he wrote this account.\n\fFeb.-Mab., 1917.

He told\nme that on Monday night, the 3rd July, he found himself lying\non the floor and feeling very ill ; he was utterly unable to move\nor to call for help. He thinks he must have been rmconscious\nfor a long time. Early in the morning, he managed to call\nthe cook, and then remembers nothing more till 7 o'clock, when\nhe sent for the doctor. He told me he had never felt so ill\nbefore, and quite thought it was all over for him ; he said he\nfelt such a longing for some one to come while lying on the\nfloor, and a feeling of great distress at not being able to call\nfor aid.\nI may state that before leaving home, we had seen him in\nquite good health and had [heard] nothing of him while we were\nin Somerset. \"\n[C. W. Lmvson.]\nMiss E. Lawson corroborates Mr. Lawsoii's statement, and\nadds an account of her own dream, as follows :\n[Enclosed in Mr. TyrrelVs letter of November 21, 1916.]\nOn Monday night, July 3rd [1916], I had a most vivid dream\nabout my uncle [R. Stephen].\nI dreamt that he came running up to me looking very ill ; he\nhanded me a book which he asked me to take down in the town.\nI asked him what was the matter, and he said : \"I am very\nill,\" and he then left the room where I and two or three other\npeople were. The next thing I remember was that he was lying\nimconscious, and that none of us seemed able to go to his help.\nWhen I came down to breakfast the next morning, my father\ntold me he had had a dream about Uncle [Bob] being ill ;\nafter hearing this, I was so impressed that I wanted to write\nand ask him how he was, as we were staying away at the time ;\nbut we did not write, as we were afraid of upsetting him. We\nreturned home on the following Wednesday [July 5, 1916], and\non Thursday morning my uncle came up stUl looking very ill\nand with a nasty cut on his nose which he had got through his\nfall on the same night that I had dreamt about him.\n[E. Lawson.]\nIt has not been possible to obtain any statement from Mr.\nStephen, since he greatly dislikes making any reference to\nhis experience but evidence as to the date and nature of his\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb. -Mae., 1917.\nillness has been obtained, from his cook and from the doctor\nwho attended him.\n[Statement by Mr. Stephen's cook concerning his illness, enclosed\nin Mr. Tyrrell's letter of November 21, 1916.]\nAt 1 a.m. on July 4th, 1916, I was aroused by hearing a\nthud which seemed to come from Mr. [Stephen's] room. I sat\nup and listened, but hearing no further sound, I went to sleep.\nAt 3.45 I heard Mr. [Stephen] knocking at my door and saying :\n\" Come quickly, I am very ill.\" I roused the housemaid and\nwent to Mr. [Stephen's] room ; we found him lying on the floor\nunconscious and looking very ill. I sent the housemaid for some\nwhisky, and we managed to pour a little into his mouth, and\nthen with difiiculty lifted him into bed ; he was icy cold, and I\nshould think had been lying for hours on the floor ; he then\nrevived a little, and said :\n\" I am feeling very ill. I think I\nam dying.\" I wanted to send for the doctor, but he would\nnot let me. After a bit he seemed to get better, so we went\nback to bed ; at 7 o'clock I went to his room and found him\nstill very ill, and he agreed to my sending for the doctor. On\nclearing out his room the next day, I found clots of blood under\nthe washing-stand, so the thud I heard at 1 o'clock must have\nbeen caused by his falling against the washing-stand, as his nose\narid face were cut about.\n(Signed) [F. Williams] (pseudonym).\nThe doctor's statement, verified by reference to his professional\ndiary, is as follows :\nNovember 26, 1916.\nI was called at 3\/45 a.m. on July 4th, 1916, to see Mr [R.\nStephen] at Cottage, . He had then recovered con-\nsciousness (he had been unconscious for some considerable time),\nand was suffering from the effects of rather severe haemorrhage\ndue to a wound caused by a fall.\n[C. Barker] (pseudonym).\nIt will be observed that Dr. Barker differs from the cook\nas to the hour at which he was called in. He is more likely\nto be accurate in such a matter, bat the point is not important\nfor our present enquiry. There seems little doubt that Mr.\nStephen was first taken ill at about 1 a.m. on July 4, 1916,\nand that he remained wholly or partially unconscious for some\nhours.\n\fFeb. -Mae., 191?. Oases.\n'\n'\n^9\nAs to the date of the two dreams we have only the testi-\nmony of Mr. and Miss Lawson, for, being \" away from home\nand among strangers,\" they had no natural opportunity of\nmentioning their experience to any other person until after\nthey knew of Mr. Stephen's illness. But their statements\nare consistent in all essentials, and may be held to corroborate\neach other. They both agree that the dreams occurred\non the night of July 3-4, 1916, and that they related them to\none another at breakfast the next morning. They are not\nlikely to be mistaken in their clear recollection that they were\naway from home upon that occasion, and since they returned\non July 5, there is good reason to think that they have\nremembered the date of the dreams accurately, or at least\nthat this date was no later than the night of July 4-5. 1916.^\nThe\\ had no normal knowledge of Mr. Stephen's illness until\nthe evening of July 5, 1916, after their return home.\nSince no written record was made of the dreams until\nNovember\u2014after an interval of more than four months\u2014their\nmemory of certain details may be inaccurate. But these details\nare not essential to the value of the case. Both witnesses\nagree that the central incident of the two dreams was the\nserious illness of Mr. Stephen.\nREVIEW.\nThe Reality of Psychic PJienomena : Ra-ps, Levitatioii, etc. By\nW. J. Crawford, D.Sc. London: John M. Watkins, 1916,\npp. 248, price 4s. 6d. net.\nThis book, a great part of which has already appeared in a\nseries of articles in Light, gives an account of experiments carried\nout by Dr. Crawford at seances for physical phenomena in a\nfamily circle at Belfast\u2014the medium being a member of the\nfamily. Dr. Crawford attended as a visitor, not forming part\nof the circle, and therefore free to move about ; and some of\nthe sittings took place at his own house. The phenomena con-\nsisted of raps and of levitation of the table round which the\nfamily sat.\nThe experiments were directed to ascertaining the source and\n1 The possibility that the dreams occurred at a date prior to the night\nof July 3-4, 1916, seems scarcely worth arguing. But we should have to\nsuppose in that case that they were premonitory.\n\fSo Journal of Society for Psychical UesearcK. Feb.-Mak., I9lf.\nmode of action of the mechanical force at work. They showed\nconclusively that the force emanated from the medium, and. in\nthe case of levitations, acted as though a cantilever attached\nto the lower part of her body supported the table at its free\nend. This Dr. Crawford speaks of as the cantilever theory.\nA cantilever is a beam or similar object firmly attached at one\nend to a wall or pillar and projecting more or less horizontally\ninto space at the other end. A bracket supporting a wide shelf\nmight be described as a cantilever, and so may the arm of a\ncrane. The cantilever which raises and supports the table Dr.\nCrawford conjectures to be formed of invisible matter taken from\nthe medium's body and restored when the levitation is over.\nBut his experiments do not exclude\u2014indeed some of them seem\nto me to suggest\u2014the more rationalistic hypothesis that the\ncantilever in question is the leg and foot of the medium.\nThe arguments against this are chiefly two. First, Dr. Crawford\nbelieves he would have seen the leg had it been used. It must\nbe remembered, however, that the light under the table was\nvery bad ; that the table itself must often have screened the\nspace in front of the medium's body from Dr. Crawford's view ;\nand further, that his attention must often have been occupied\nby the apparatus used in his experiments. The second argument\nis that at times the cantilever appears to resist a much greater\nforce applied against it than one would have supposed possible\nwere it the medium's leg and foot. For example, on one occasion\n(p. 63) Dr. Crawford and another man only just succeeded together\nin pressing down the levitated table. There is clearly, therefore,\nroom for investigation. It would be interesting to know by\nmeasurement what the force employed in pressing down the\ntable actually amounted to. It would also be interesting to know\nexactly what was the direction,, relatively to the hypothetically\nstretched-out leg, in which it was applied. If it was along the unbent\nleg, the latter would act as a strut and could resist considerable\npressure. It seems possible that the phenomenon was of the\nnature of some of those exhibited in the early nineties by a\nMrs. Abbott, known as \" The little Georgia Magnet,\" and explained\nby Sir Oliver Lodge in the S.P.R. Journal for December, 1891.^\nShe was a small woman, and one of her performances was,\nJournal, Yo\\. V. pp. 168-9.

Dr. Crawford\ntells us (pp. 72, 73) that in the position preferred for the exhibi-\ntion of the greatest resistance to force, the table is tilted up\non the two legs furthest from the medium at an angle to the\nhorizontal of about 40\u00b0. Also, great importance is attached to\nits being neither too near to nor too far from the medium\n(pp. 56, 57). It is obvious that such conditions might be very\nfavourable to resistance by the medium's leg and foot to con-\nsiderable force pressing on the table. E. M. S.\nNOTES ON CUERENT PERIODICALS.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research\nfor January and February contains a long criticism by Dr. Hyslop\nof Mrs. Sidgwick's Report on The Psychology of Mrs. Piper s\nTrance, published in Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXVIII. As Dr. Hyslop\nstates in a footnote, his paper was offered for publication in the\nS.P.R. Proceedings, but it was thought too long for the pur-\npose, and a suggestion was made to him that he should con-\ntribute a shorter article. This, however, he was unwilling to\ndo, as he did not feel that he could usefully deal with the subject\nwithin the suggested limits. It was therefore decided that a\nnotice should be inserted in the Journal calling attention to\nDr. Hyslop's article.\nDr. Hyslop has many criticisms to bring against Mrs. Sidgwick's\nReport, but it is not easy to make out to what extent he differs\nfrom her fundamentally ; in one passage he himself speaks of\nthe difference between them being \" mainly a difference in words.\"\nHe also criticises Mrs. Sidgwick's discussion of the \" waking\nstage \" of the trance on the ground that\nshe wholly ignores those instances of it in which the supernormal occurs. . .\nShe ignores the fact that the supernormal is the imjjortant feature in\ndetermining its general nature in connection with the elements that are not\nsupernormal. She ignores the fact that the best evidence for the super-\nnormal often came through in this condition, especially in proper names.\nThis criticism is hardly fair to Mrs. Sidgwick, who on p. 26\nof her report, for instance, states that those who were responsible\nfor the management of the Piper sittings in England in 1906-1907\ncame to perceive that the waking-stage was of considerable\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Fkb.-Mar., 1917.\ninterest and likely to produce evidential matter.\" As to the\nquestion of whether the supernormal is the important element\nin determining the nature of Mrs. Piper's trance-phenomena.\nDr. Hyslop lays emphasis throughout his article on the necessity\nin his opinion of \" treating the case as a whole.\"\nA theory that will explain the nonsense alone will not explain the super,\nnormal, but a theory which will explain the supernormal will have the right\nto determine the explanation of the nonsense.\nDr. Hyslop also breaks a lance with Mrs. Sidgwick over her\n\" resolute opposition to '\npossession '\ntheories \" and her preference\nfor a telepathic explanation. As to his own theory of possession\nwhich he puts forward as substantially the same as Dr. Hodgson's,\nno more can be done here than to indicate by a few short\nextracts the general lines on which it is built up.\nIn the first place, we do not know an3'thing about the process by which\nwe control our own motor system. We merely know that motor action\nimmediately follows mental states and volitions. ... It might well be the\n.same with spirits and their mental states. Eliminate hy inhibition or other\nmethods the influence of the medium's consciousness on the motor organism\nand transmit mental states to it, pictures, as we do in normal life, and the\nsame effect might take place with the complications of analogies with aphasia\nand other ditficultiea. That is all that \"possession\" is, and the term is\nonly a convenient one to illustrate the difference between the pictographic\nprocess in an appeal to the sensory functions and the so-called direct process\nof direct action on the nervous sj'stem of the motor machinery . . .\n{p. 36).\n\"Possession'\" will thus be coterminous with all automatism whether motor or\nsensory, provided the interpretative functions are excluded or reduced to a\nminimum in the phenomena ... (p. 114).\nDr. Hyslop illustrates his theory by a reference to the case\nof the Rev. P. H. Newnham (Proc, S.P.R., Vol. III., pp. 7 fE.),\nwhich he classes as one of possession, because the mental questions\nasked by Mr. Newnham were answered by Mrs. Newnham in\nautomatic writing, \" by the motor, as distinct from the sensory\nprocess.\"\nDr. Hyslop's general conclusion in regard to the Piper pheno-\nmena seems to be that the \"controls\" are spirits who act by\n\" possession \" directly upon Mrs. Piper's organism ; sometimes\nher subliminal as well as her supraliminal consciousness is com-\npletely excluded, but more often there is some interfusion between\nthe medium's subliminal consciousness and the \" control.\"\nH.

We therefore take this opportunity\nof letting our members know that for the present, and until\nmore normal conditions prevail, the Journal will not appear\neach month. It will be printed at intervals of about two\nmonths, the date of issue being chosen for the purpose of\ngiving members due notice of the Society's meetings. Our\nreason for adopting this course is partly a lack of suitable\nmaterial for publication, but still more the great increase in\nthe cost of paper, and the consequent necessity for economy\nin this direction.\nCASES.\nI.\nL. 121L Telepathic Dream.\nWe have received the following case of what appears to be\na telepathic dream through Sir Oliver Lodge to whom it was\nreported in the first instance. The dreamer is Mrs. Walter\nBrowett, of Westfield, Coventry, and the first account of her\nexperience which we received was as follows :\nStatement by Walter Broicett of Westfield, Coventry, Solicitor.\nJanuary 30, 1917.\nThis morning at 8 a.m. my wife told me that she had had a\nvivid dream about an aunt always referred to as \" Auntie Maude.\"\nShe said she met her dressed in black with widow's weeds, and\nshe told my wife that her husband was dead.\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1917.\nMy wife had not seen her for some years, but they exchanged\nletters occasionally, the last letter being about a week ago on an\nentirely trivial matter. My wife had never seen Auntie Maude's\nhusband to whom she was only married last October.\nWhen we came down to breakfast we found a letter from Auntie\nMaude, the contents of which are of no importance. It was\nwritten and posted yesterday at a place near Shrewsbury. I\nnaturally remarked to my wife that that was the end of her\ndream.\nAt 1.30 p.m. we received a telegram as follows :\n\" My husband\npassed away last night. Auntie Maude.\" So far as we can\nremember we had neither of us either spoken or thought of Auntie\nMaude or her husband since last week.\nWalter Browett.\nIn reply to our request for a first-hand report of her dream\nfrom Mrs. Browett, we received the following statement :\nWestfield, Coventry, February 19, 1917.\nAt the end of October 1916, my late mother's only sister,\nMrs. Short, to whom I always refer as \" Auntie Maude,\" was\nmarried to a Mr. G. M. Meire, Byton-on-Severn, Shrewsbury. I\nhave not seen her for several years, and I never saw him. On\nthe night of Monday-Tuesday, January 29th-30th, 1917, I dreamt\nthat I saw Auntie Maude in widow's weeds, and felt that her\nhusband was dead. I told my husband about it directly I awoke\nand described her dress. At breakfast we found a letter from\nher, from which apparently all was well. About 1.30 we received\na telegram from her as follows :\n\" My husband passed away last\nnight. Auntie Maude.\"\nF. M. Browett.\nWe also wrote to Mr. Browett pointing out the importance\nfrom an evidential standpoint of making it clear that Mr.\nMeire's death was sudden and that neither he nor Mrs. Browett\nhad any reason to anticipate it. [n this connection we asked\nMr. Meire's age and we also asked whether the telegram an-\nnouncing his death had been preserved. Mr. Browett replied\nas follows :\nWestfield, Coventry, February 19, 1917.\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th inst. I now enclose a state-\nment written and signed by my wife [see above].\n\fApril, 1917. Gases. 37\nI also enclose tlie letter therein referred to and a letter from\nMrs. Meire dated tlie Htli inst., in which she describes the manner\nof her husband's death on the 29th ult.\nYou will see that there was nothing in the first letter to suggest\nthat Mr. Meire's health was affected. As a matter of fact, we\nknew that he used to rise at 6.30 to go round his farm, and when\nI saw him\u2014for the first and last time\u2014at the wedding in London\nhe appeared to be a healthy man\u2014slim and wiry. I went to\nhis funeral and then learnt that his age was 67. He had been\nvery active during the afternoon of the 29th and had said how\nwell he felt. . . .\nThe telegram was not kept, but it was only a \" confirmation\n\"\none, the original message having been telephoned up here from\nthe Coventry G.P.O. I saw Mrs. Meire after the funeral and she\ntold me that she did not know that her husband had any heart\ntrouble.\nBefore mentioning my wife's dream to her, I asked her whether\nher thoughts turned to any one in particular when her husband\ndied. She said :\n\" To you, of course. I said to myself I wish\nWalter were here to help me.\" She said that she did not remember\nthinking of my wife further than she would of necessity do\nwhen thinking of me. My wife is her god-daughter and the only\none of the family with whom she is really intimate.\nWalter Browett.\nOf the two letters from Mrs. Meire to which Mr. Browett\nrefers above the earlier, dated January 29, 1917, and received\nby Mrs. Browett on January 30 after she had told Mr. Browett\nof her dream, makes only one reference to Mr. Meire, and\nsays nothing of hLs health. The second letter, dated February\n14, 1917, which is too personal to print here, makes it evident\nthat Mr. Meire's death was quite unexpected. He died of\nheart-failure about 11.30 p.m. on January 29, 1917, having been\nto all appearances in good, normal health a few minutes before.\nThe fact that the telegram announcing his death to Mr.\nand Mrs. Browett has not been preserved is of little moment.\nThe hour and day of the death are sufficiently established by\nMrs. Meire's letter of February 14, 1917, confirmed by the\nannouncement in the Times of Feb. 2, 1917, as follows :\nMeire.\u2014On the 29th Jan., at Eyton-on-Severn, near Shrews-\nbury, George Haughton Meire, aged 67.\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Aphil, 1917.\nSince Mrs. Browett related her dream to her husband at\n8 a.m. oti January 30, 1917, before commg domi to breakfast,\nwe may consider it certain that she had at the time 110 normal\nknowledge of Mr. Meire's death. The fact that Mrs. Meire is\nMrs. Browett's godmother and that her thoughts turned to\nMr. Browett at the time of her husband's death, wishing for\nhis presence and help, affords a natural basis for the telepathic\nrapport which the dream seems to indicate.\nG. 288. II.\nIn the following case, which has been sent to us through\nSir Oliver Lodge, evidence of identity was obtained in a\ncommunication purporting to come from a spirit. The com-\nmunication was made through a professional medium, to whom\nreference is made under the name of Mr. Z. in Sir Oliver\nLodge's paper on \" Recent Evidence about Prevision and Sur-\nvival \" (Proc. S.P.R., Part LXXIL, pp. Ill ff.).\nThe spirit purporting to communicate was a son of Colonel\nMacdonald, of 14 Bma Gardens, S.W., and we give first\nColonel Macdonald's account of the incident, as follows :\nJunior United Service Club, London, S.W.,\nDecember 23rd, 1916.\nOn 5th October, 1916, I was at supper at Colonel Cowley's\nresidence in Tufnell Park. Mr. [Z.], who had been asked to give\na private seance, was one of the party and at supper was seated\non my left. During the meal he said to me, \" A boy who looks\nto me about 25, dressed in the kilt, has just come in and is\nstanding now behind your chair\u2014to me he seems to be your son.\"\nHe further described him to me as wearing the Black Watch\ntartan (this was an error, but one easily enough made, especially\nby a Londoner). My son was in the Argyll & Sutherland\nHighlanders,^ and I said that it would not be the boy who had\nbeen shot through the head near Ypres on 8th November, 1914.\nMr. [Z.] said, \" I feel sure he is for you\u2014he is trying to identify\nhimself and is showing me a large scar, three or four inches long,\non the left shin, looks to me as if it might be a football scar.\"\n1 It should be noted, moreover, that the Black Watch and the Argyll and\nSutherland Highlanders both wear the Sutherland tartan, but the Black Watch\nkilt is pleated so as to show only the dark blue bars of the tartan. The Argj'lls\non the other hand, pleat the kilt so as to show the green bars mainly\u2014hence\nthe statement that the boy was wearing the \"Black Watch Tartan\" was not\nin fact inaccurate. \u2014C. M.\n\fApril, 1917. Cases. 39\nI replied that I have often seen the boy after swimming, etc.,\nand that to my knowledge he had no such scar.\n[Z.], however, remained very positive and said, \" Well ! I feel\nvery sure he is for you, and if you make enquiries I think you\nwill find he had this scar\u2014he smiles and shows it to me again.\"\nSome two or three days after, I met on the staircase of my\nhouse an old servant who had been the boy's nurse many years\nago, and I asked her if she remembered any such scar.\nShe said, \" Yes, during the winter of 1910-11, while at Sand-\nhurst, he had motored in to London for the week-end on leave.\"\n\u2014He used a motor-bike in those days.\n\u2014\" The roads were still\ncovered with half-melted snow. The bike skidded and threw him.\nThe front wheel during the fall turned round and caught his leg\nbetween the step and the wheel and gave his shin a very nasty\ncut\u2014five or six inches long. When he got home, about midnight,\nhe woke me up to bandage the wound before he turned in to\nbed, as it was bleeding badly. Before bandaging I washed the\nwound with Sanitas for fear of tetanus infection.\"'\nI never saw the wound and had no knowledge of the scar, and,\ntherefore, had denied its existence to Mr. [Z.J\u2014but he was right\nand I was wrong.\nThere could have been no \" thought reading \" in this case, for\nthe idea that the boy had such a scar as described did not then\nexist in my mind.

I was not present at the stance and do not know Mr. [Z.]\nand therefore cannot certify to that portion of the statement.\nEva Mowbray.\nAfter receiving this statement we wrote to Colonel Macdonald\npointing out that the nurse did not say which leg was injured\nand asking for further information from her on this point. In\nreply she wrote to us as follows :\n14 Bina Gardens, South Kensington, S.W.,\nFebruary 16, 1917.\nI hereby certify the wound was on the left leg, about half-way\nbetween the ankle and knee.\nEva Mowbray.\nIt thus appears that the medium, Mr. Z., was justified in\nhis assertion that the young soldier who wished to communicate\nwith Colonel Macdonald\u2014apparently his son\u2014had a scar on his\nleft leg. It came to our knowledge that upon another recent\noccasion a spirit purporting to communicate through Mr. Z.\n(in no way connected with Colonel Macdonald) had referred to\na scar on his right leg as a proof of identity. In this case\nalso it happened that the statement was correct, but this second\nincident suggested that Mr. Z. might be in the habit of making\nallusions to scars on the chance of scoring a hit. We have,\nhowever, made enquiries of several people who have had sittings\nrepeatedly with Mr. Z. and they tell us that in their own\nexperience he has not referred to a scar. It appears likely\ntherefore that the occurrence of two recent cases in which a spirit\npurporting to communicate through Mr. Z. has referred correctly\nto a scar on one of his legs is merely a coincidence.\nWhatever was the source of the medium's knowledge it does not\nappear to have been Colonel Macdonald's mind, as he himself has\npointed out, and it is difficult to see upon what normal source\nof information Mr. Z. could have drawn.\nUpon this pomt Colonel Macdonald informs us that mitil the\nevening of October 5, 1917, \"I had never met or heard of\nMr. Z., no one of the company at the table or in the house\nhad acquaintance with my son, or knew him by sight.\"\n\fNo. CCCXXXVII.\u2014Vol. XVIII.

M. Stawell contributed a criticism of\nthe evidence for survival contained m Mr. G. W. Balfour's\npaper on The Ear of Dionysius. These papers, it is hoped, will\nbe published later in Proceedings. Sir Oliver Lodge, Dr. Jacks,\nMr. Constable, and Sir William Barrett also took part hi the\ndiscussion.\nd2\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1917.\nEeport op the Discussion.^\nSib, Oliver Lodge : Mrs. Sidgwick's paper is judicial, hold-\ning the balance even ; Miss Stawell's paper is an example of\nextreme orthodoxy. But with regard to myself, I am on the\nextreme left ; for you know, I have given myself away, and\nhave come definitely to the conclusion that survival is a fact\nand that communication with the dead is in a certain sense\nproven. Hence, that being admittedly so, you can discount\nwhat I say !\nMiss Stawell, whose sceptical paper is a very fair one, is\nimpressed with the doctrine of chance-coincidence. She refers\nto a case when a number of people were asked to write at\nrandom and she found one piece of writing that corresponded\nto her own state of mind and might have been communicated\nby a dead friend. Note the difference between that case and\nthe ordinary case of mediumistic communications. She had not\npicked out that one individual and tried to get communications\nfrom her friend. She had taken the writing by chance and\nfound something in it that corresponded to her own mind.\nShe chose it out of 30 pieces. Suppose she had taken it\nfrom 30,000, there would have been still more possibility of\nchance-coincidence ; sooner or later the coincidence was bound\nto occur. And you cannot draw conclusions from one instance.\nThen she speaks of the strange lapse of memory that appears\nin the script which Mr. Balfour calls \" Script D,\" where the\ncommunicator seems to think that all that had been said on\nthe subject of Dionysius' ear ought to have been known by\nMrs. Verrall. So far from there being a strange lapse of\nmemory, I think it is a natural one, owing to the long interval\nof time. At first, and during the setting of the problem, they '\nhad specially said that Mrs. Verrall was not to be informed,\nin order to avoid telepathy. But no solution was obtained,\nand perhaps the communicators practically forgot the whole\nmatter. Then came Mrs. Verrall's sitting with \"Mrs. Willett,\"\nand memory revived. \" What about the Ear of Dionysius ?\n\"\nthey said. \" You've got that clear, we hope ?\n\" The whole\nincident seems to me human and natural, and there is nothing\nstrange about it.\n' This report gives only the substance of what was said ; it is not verhatim.\n\fMat-June, 1917. Private Meeting. 45\nAnother contention in the paper is that \"Mrs. Willett\n\"\nwas interested in the Ear of Dionysius and concerned with\nthis kmd of thing. But m fact she is not at all interested\nin such things, and it is natural that, although she had heard\nthe name Dionysius under control, she did not remember\nanything about it afterwards.\nThen Miss Stawell says that she had often come across\nPhiloxenus ui her reading, but he is mentioned in such a very\nincidental manner that only those familiar with the name would\nnotice it. The name has been brought to her mind now and\nshe sees it everywhere, but it would have made no impression\non her before. She says, too, that Mrs. Verrall must have\ncome across Philoxenus in her studies and may have forgotten\nit ; this would not be so strange, Miss Stawell thinks, as her\nforgetting the Ear of Dionysius. But the Ear of Dionysius is\nnot a classical reference ; the name is medieval, and that is\nprobably why Mrs. Verrall did not know anything about it.\nBut her knowledge of the whole subject of Philoxenus is\nhypothetical^\u2014Dr. Verrall 's knowledge of these things is certain.\nHence, when we receive from a medium a communication\npurporting to come from Dr. Verrall, it is a simpler hypothesis\nto say that it comes from one who did know the subject of\nthe communication than from one to whom it was foreign.\nThe script moreover shows considerable effort and design,\nforeign to Mrs. Verrall, but quite appropriate to Dr. Verrall,\nand it is to be remembered that, when Mrs. Verrall did see\nthis script, it did not brmg up any previous knowledge.\nSupposing she had had any knowledge, she had a much\nmore serious lapse of memory than anything shown by the\ncommmiicator.\nAs regards the evidence in general : the evidence referred to\nby Mrs. Sidgwick has, it has been noted, all come from non-\nprofessional mediums, the only exception being Mrs. Piper, who\nfor all practical purposes is a non-professional medium, that\nis, she did not sit for strangers. Professor Barrett brought\nforward telepathy in a paper read before the British Association\nin 1876. His paper was read but not published, as the evidence\nwas not accepted. That attitude is not new. Fresh dis-\ncoveries are always regarded with suspicion mitil the atmosphere\nis ready for them. The fact of telepathy has been established\n\f46 journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1917.\nby the Society, and, as Mrs. Sidgwick says, it constitutes a\nvery important link hi the chain of evidence. It tends to\nshow that mental activity is not dependent upon the body. I\nthink there are certain people in spiritualistic circles who do not\nyet realise the importance of telepathy from their point of view.\nBut how m telepathy is a mental impression conveyed from one\nperson to another ? Take the Honolulu episode in \" Kaymond.\"\nThe family group in Birmingham asked Raymond to give the\nword \" Ho]iolulu \" at a sittmg in London, and the word was\ngiven. Now that is what we should call a telepathic experi-\nment. But what appeared to be the dramatic explanation was\nthat Raymond was in touch with both places and was asked\nto convey the word. My point is this : it is a case of tele-\npathy, but it may be explained by a certain intermediary,\nan individual personality who conveyed the message.\nThe evidence for survival appears to be of several different\nkinds : there is the domestic type with personal touches, and\nthe scholarly type (as in the Dionysius case). There is also\nthe cross-correspondence type, both of the simple and of the\ncomplex variety, and the cross-correspondence type is extremely\nimportant\u2014more so than men realise. There is a great deal\nof it, and it requires a great deal of study. The simple cases\nare what people are asking for, but the complex cases are\nmore valuable and show the desire of the operators to exclude\nordinary telepathy. They give apparently meaningless com-\nmunications that require a great deal of analysis and dis-\nsection before the meaning comes out. Then there is the\nposthumous letter kind, to which Mrs. Sidgwick referred m\nher paper. So far this kind has failed, and I think it will\ncontinue to fail. I think that those on the other side want\nus not to attribute much importance to it. Mr. Piddington's\n\"Sevens\" case^ shows that leakage is possible. The fact is\nthat crucial proof is seldom to be obtained and always to be\nmistrusted. I think that Sir William Barrett will agree that\nin science we often get what we think crucial proof, \u2014it is some-\ntimes very convincing,\u2014but we find afterwards that it ought\nnot to have been convhicing\u2014there was a flaw which we had\nnot perceived. The real proof I of all scientific theories is\ncumulative, and no theory is established before- proceeding to\niSee Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXIV., p. 222 ft'.\n\fMat-June, 1917. Private Meeting. 47\nact upon it. We are guided by probability more than we know.\nMost of our theories are working hypotheses ;\nthey are\naccepted, they will be changed, they will be much changed,\nand are ready to be changed\u2014they hold the field for the time\nbeing and they are acted upon as working hypotheses. A\nsound working hypothesis is what I consider to have been\nreached in the matter of survival.\nThe evidence keeps on growing. Every week I mtroduce a\ncomplete stranger to some medium, and every week those\nbereaved persons get into touch with their relations. Without\nthe slightest clue the communicators are eager to get through\nto bring comfort, m order that the people left behind may look\nforward to reimion. That is not done for evidence, but evidence\nfollows ; so a hypothesis gets more and more bolstered up,\nuntil it becomes established.\nMrs. Sidgwick's paper concluded with some practical advice\nto those who interest themselves m psychical matters or are\nintending to visit mediums, and with this advice I heartily\nconcur. I think that the conclusion to which I have arrived\nis that it is one universe all the time, not two\u2014but there is a\n-yeil between them, caused by the limitation of our senses.\nDr. Jacks : 1 do not cj^uite know whether I should be\nconsidered to be on what Sir Oliver Lodge has called the left\nside or the right in regard to the question of the evidence\nfor survival. I feel that I have certain grounds for believing\nin survival independent of those that are investigated by\n\"this Society. And that being so, 1 am open to evidence\nwhich corroborates a belief independently held. And I find\nit easy to interpret a great deal of the evidence in terms of\nthat belief; but I must confess that if I had not this inde-\npendent belief, I doubt whether the evidence so far accumu-\nlated by the Society would convince me of survival. 1 admit\nthat it is impressive and ought to be carefully weighed by the\nmost sceptical ; but in spite of what Sir Oliver Lodge has\nsaid, I cannot say that 1 think it is conclusive. An\ningenious person, who had no independent belief in survival,\n^and still more an ingenious person who was determined to\n\u2022explain away the evidence, would not have very much diffi-\nculty in getting round the evidence so far obtained. I have\nd3\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat-June, 1917_\noften tried to frame a conception of what really convincing;\nevidence would be. What would be the kind of evidence\nthat would settle the question once and for all ? I confess\nI have never been able to form a conception of evidence\nof this kind that could not be got round by manoeuvring and\ningenuity. Not that 1 approve of manoeuvring and ingenuity\nin dealing with matters of this kind, but still, I think you\nwill find it is as I say, if you make the experiment. The\nwill to disbelieve is quite as active as the will to believe.\nBuild up a case of evidence as strong as you can make it.\nfor survival, and then exercise your ingenuity by trying to\nget round it, and I think you will always be able to do so.\nOf course, I assume that everyone concerned is perfectly\ngenuine. You might even try this experiment. Try to pro-\nduce conclusive proof that you are the same person that left\nyour own door this afternoon to come to this meeting\u2014a proof\nthat no one can throw doubt upon. I think you will not be\nable to do it.\nWe have already seen in Miss Stawell's paper how the hypo-\nthesis of telepathy, if worked for all it is worth, will enable you\nto give another explanation of this evidence. Although the\nperson who receives the communication may have no know-\nledge of the matter communicated to him, you cannot\nprove that knowledge of that matter has not been introduced\ninto his mind in some way without his knowing whether it is\nthere. He does not know what be knows. By following that\nline of argument you can invalidate any e\\'idence. Take the\nquestion of imposture. Mediums are not the only impostors.\nHow about the communicators ? Are they masquerading ?\nYou can have no absolute proof that there is no imposture\non the other side.\nI think that the whole meaning of personal identity needs\nto be very carefully thought out and considered before we\nbegin to produce evidence in favour of personal identity.\nIn my own mind, personal identity is almost synonymous with\npersonal continuity. Our personal identity largely consists in\nthe fact that we are able at every moment to take up our\nlife at th^ poiat at which we left it off. There is always a past,\nand it is my own particular past which makes me what I\nam. Personal identity involves a certain age.\n\fMat-June, 1917. Private Meeting. 49\nNow suppose a man dies at the age of 50, at what age does\nhe come to life in the next world ? Has he no past behind\nhim when he passes into the next world ? If anybody talks\nabout the mature personality coming to life in the next world\nwithout any past, he is talking nonsense. If he has no past,\nhe has no personality. It seems to me that one of the most\nimportant tasks that await this Society is not so much to\nestablish the identity of the spirits, but to establish the con-\ntinuity of life in the next world with this life, or conceivably\nwith some other life.\nMr. Constable argued that when we treat this subject as a\nfight between those who believe in survival and those who do\nnot, we make a great mistake. He had lately been reading\nProfessor William James's The Varieties of Religious Experience,\nand in that book the author says that ecstasy is part of\nhuman experience. There is no loss of personality in ecstasy\n\u2014^there is merely a transcendence. Kant says the personality\nof man is a transcendental subject which is purely spiritual\nand has nothing to do with past, present or future. If that\nbe true, then those who support survival have a very strong\nbacking. ,\n.\nSir William Barrett gave an account of an interesting\ncase of evidence for survival, which he said would be mcludsd\nin his forthcoming book.\nOBITUARY.\nMISS JANE BARLOW, D.Litt.\nIn the recent death of Miss Jane Barlow the Society has lost\nan early, a very gifted and valued member. For more\nthan a quarter of a century Miss Barlow took a keen and\nactive interest in our work, and for many years the Committee\nof Reference and Publication had the advantage of her co-\noperation and suggestions. Her intimate knowledge of the Pro-\nceedings of the Society and her sound judgment rendered her\nopinion always worth having. But she was so modest and\n\f50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, mat-June, 1917.\nretiring that only those who knew her well could form a true\nestimate of the rare insight and the wide range of knowledge\nshe possessed.\nFew writers of the present day have been able to express\ntheir ideas in such perfect literary form as Miss Barlow ; not\na word in any of her published writings, or in her private\ncorrespondence\u2014with its minute and beautiful script\u2014could be\nomitted or be replaced by another word without detracting\nfrom the meaning. The present writer has heard such com-\npetent literary critics as Lord Morley and Frederic Myers\nexpress their unbounded admiration for the distinction of Miss\nBarlow's style, and the grace and charm of her Irish stories.\nIt was through her short stories of Irish peasant life that she\nbecame widely known to the outside public, and won a fame\nthat will long endure. Irish Idylls, Bog-land Studies, A Creel\nof Irish Stories, Strangers at Lisconnel, Maureen s Fairing, Kerri-\ngan's Quality, and her many other volumes of short stories, reveal\nthe true Irish atmosphere and depict with wonderful fidelity\nthe pathetic, lovable, generous nature of Irish peasant life, spent\namid the dreary stretches of moor and bog. It is true that her\nstories scarcely touch upon the religious aspect of the humble\nlives she narrates, which is so strong a characteristic of the\nIrish peasantry. But this omission was possibly due to her\nartistic instinct, and anxiety to avoid any trace of religious\ndisputation. Otherwise these stories afford a true and wonderful\nrevelation of Irish character, through incidents which in any\nless gifted writer would be considered trivialities. Mac's\nAdventures is a gem. a more charming boy was never created\nby any novelist, and, as a reviewer in the Standard said, \" we\ngrudge every moment that is not spent in Mac's inimitable\ncompany.\"\nIn her poems as well as in her prose writings Miss Barlow\nreveals the refined and cultured nature of her personality. She\nwas an omnivorous reader and learned beyond most women\n;\nit is said (and it may be true enough) that she often conversed\nin Greek with her father, who was the well-known Senior\nFellow and Vice-Provost of Trinity College, Dublin ; he also\nwas a deeply interested member of our Society, a man of the\nmost prodigious and varied learning, and, like his daughter, a\ngood musician.\n\fMay-June, 1917. Obituary Notice. 51\nMiss Barlow's insight into Irish character must have been\nan instinct rather than the result of acquired knowledge ; for\nshe had the most shrinking shy personality, rarely straying\nbeyond the shelter of her beautiful home near Dublin except\nfor the long country rambles in which she delighted. So\ndeep and true was her revelation of the character of the Irish\npeasant with its strange contradictions, that those who only\nknew her writings thought she had always lived among the\nhumble folk she describes. She had no small talk and seemed\nutterly oblivious of outward things, yet so keen and rapid was\nher observation that she seized upon any passing incident and\nwove it into a touching and beautiful story. Among the\nlarge collection of letters which she addressed to the present\nwriter are many really worthy of publication, for they\ncontam flashes of humour along with keen philosophic insight\nand glimpses of matters of the deepest import. When the\nUniversity of Dublin threw open its degrees to women. Miss\nBarlow was one of the first to receive the highest honorary\ndistinction that ancient seat of learning could bestow.\nSlight in appearance with large and deep-set eyes she looked\nas if the flame of genius and thought had almost burnt out\nher physical frame, so frail was she. Deeply affectionate, she\nwas devoted to her father and during the long illness which\nended in his death a few years ago, she hardly ever left his\nbedside except to snatch a few moments of rest. His death,\nand this long and devastating war, made her weary of the\npresent life, and the long cold winter brought on the fllness\nwhich caused her death in April last at the age of sixty-five.\nW.

Telepathic Dream.\nThe following accomit of a waking vision, which appears to\nhave been connected with the death of an ofl&cer at the front,\nhas been sent to us through Sir Oliver Lodge. The percipient\nwas Dr. George Johnston, of 23 Seymour Street, W.. and his\noriginal report of his experience was as follows :\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat-Jdne, 1917.\n23 Seymour Street, Portman Square, W.,\nMarch 15, 1917.\nMy son, Lieut. Alec Leith Johnston, of the 1st King's Shropshire\nL.I., was killed at daybreak on Saturday, April 22nd, 1916.\nAt daybreak on the next morning, Easter Sunday, about\n24 hours after his death took place, when I was lying half awake\nand half asleep, I had the vision or dream, an account of which\nfollows.\nI saw two soldiers in khaki standing beside a pile of clothing\nand accoutrements which, in some way, I knew to be Alec's, and\nmy first feeling was one of anger and annoyance that they should\nbe meddling with his things, for they were apparently looking\nthrough them and arranging them. Then one of them took up\na khaki shirt which was wrapped round something so as to form\na kind of roll. He took hold of one end of it and let the rest\ndrop so that it unrolled itself and a pair of heavy, extremely\nmuddy boots fell out and banged heavily on the floor, and some-\nthing else fell which made a metallic jingle. I thought \" That is\nhis revolver,\" but immediately afterwards thought \"No, it is too\nlight to be his revolver, which would have made more of a clang.\"\nAs these things fell out on to the floor the two men laughed,\nbut a sad wistful kind of laugh with no semblance of mirth in\nit. And then the words \" Alec is dead and they are going through\nhis kit,\" were most clearly borne in upon my mind. They were\nnot spoken and I heard no voice, but they were just as clear as\nif I had done so. And then I became fully awake with these\nwords repeating themselves in my mind and with the fullest\nconviction of their truth which I never lost. I suppose I still\ntried to persuade myself that it might not be true, but it was\nuseless and when the official telegram arrived it only confirmed\nwhat I already knew. George Johnston.\nIn a letter of the same date, March 15, 1917, Dr Johnston\nadds the following comments on his statement :\n. . . Two points have to be borne in mind in estimating the importance\nof the dream as an intimation of my son's death and not as a\nmere coincidence.\n(1) He went out to the front in October, 1914, and was there\ncontinuously (with three short leaves) until his death on April 22nd,\n1916\u2014Easter Saturday. During these eighteen months I never had\n\fMat-Jcne, 1917. Cases. 53\nany dream or any impression of his being in serious danger,\nalthough I often knew that he was in the midst of hard fighting\nand he was wounded in three places in August, 1915, at Hooge.\n(2) At the time when I had the dream I was under the impres-\nsion that his battalion was resting and that they would not be\nin the fighting line until the middle of the week. Hence my mind\nwas quite easy about him and I was not feeling at all anxious.\nIn the ordinary course of events they were not due in the trenches\nuntil the Wednesday, but they were unexpectedly called upon on\nthe evening of Good Friday to move up at once to recapture a\n\"trench which had been taken by the Germans some days before.\nIt was after having accomplished this, and whilst the position was\nbeing consolidated, that he was killed.\nI have never in my life had any dream so vivid as this one\nwas, and when I saw in the Sunday papers that his battalion had\naccomplished this \" fine feat,\" as they called it, I had no doubt\nwhatever that my boy was dead. When the ofl&cial telegram came\non the Wednesday I felt that it was hardly necessary to open it. . . .\nI shall always think (as a nephew does to whom I told my\ndream on the Sunday afternoon), that this vision was Alec's way\nof letting me know what had happened.\nA minor point that may be worth noticing is that when I heard\nthe metallic clink when the shirt unrolled and let its contents\nfall on the floor, I at first thought \" That is his revolver,\" but\nthen immediately thought the noise was too \" jingly \" to be made\nby the fall of a heavy service Colt such as he had. When his\nthings came home, however, I found that instead of having a Colt\nhe had a light French aiitomatic pistol which, in falling, would\nhave made exactly such a sound as I heard.\nI do not suppose that his kit was actually being gone through at\nthe time of my dream, nor do I think that it makes much difierence\nwhether it were so or not.

Johnston had been dead about twenty-\nfour hours. It is a strong point in favour of the assumption\nthat some other factor than chance-coincidence was involved,\nthat during the year and a half that his son had been at the\nfront Dr. Johnston had had no other similar impression about\nhim, and that on April 23, 1916, he had reason to believe that\nLieut.

By SiE\nAViLLlAM Barrett, F.R.S. (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.\nLtd., London. 6s. 6d. net.)\nOver twenty years ago, Sir William Barrett gave an address in London\nwhich he expanded into book-form under the title On the Threshold\nof a New World of Thought. An edition was printed ofi in 1895, but\npublication was postponed in consequence of the adverse report of\nthe Cambridge investigators of Eusapia Paladino, concerning whose\nearlier phenomena the book as prepared gave a favourable account.\nFurther evidence indicating the genuineness of some of Eusapia's\nphenomena having been obtained, the book appeared in 1908, and\nwas soon sold out. Again Sir William cautiously waited, rather than\npublish a new edition, in order that he might see the results of the\nS.P.R. investigations in \" cross-correspondences \" and the like ;\nand,\nthese having now confirmed the indications of earlier evidence, the\nvolume under notice was prepared by recasting and enlarging its\nforerunner.\nAfter dealing with objections based on materialistic or ecclesi-\nastical presuppositions or on the \" triviality \" of the evidence, Sir\nWilliam gives an account of some of his experiments with a little\ngirl\u2014daughter of an English solicitor of high standing\u2014in whose\n\fMay-June, 1917. Reviews. 59\npresence loud raps and other noises occurred, keeping time with\nmusic or spelling out messages which, however, always suggested\nthe child's own mentality ; and though the communicator claimed\nto be a lad named Walter Hussey, the spelling of the messages\nreproduced the characteristic mis-spellings of the medium. The\nauthor leaves open the question of source, but is sure that the\nraps require a supernormal explanation of some sort. Also heavy\ntables were moved in a manner requiring far more force than the\nchild could normally exert. Sir William describes other cases\nwith a different but equally non-professional medium, Miss L.,\nwhose raps similarly gave messages suggestive of the medium's own\nmental make-up. All these phenomena were obtained in a good\nlight, sometimes in the morning of a bright sunny day, and the\nmediums readily agreed to any test-conditions that were proposed.\nFurther confirmation was supplied by phenomena witnessed at\nJBelfast, through the non-professional mediumship of Miss Kathleen\nOoligher, which is being studied by Dr. Crawford. Sir William\nsaw the table rise and remain suspended eighteen inches above the\nfloor, in a good light and with no one touching it. He tried\nto press it down, and failed ; then climbed on it and sat there,\nwith feet off the floor, until he was tipped off. These and other\nremarkable phenomena were accompanied by raps showing intelli-\ngence, as in other cases.\nTurning to automatic writing. Sir William describes the investi-\ngations of a small private circle of his friends in Dublin, who\nrepeatedly obtained veridical ouija-messages concerning things\nunknown to the operators, who moreover were sometimes blindfolded\nand the alphabet letters redistributed in positions unknown to\nthem. Thus clairvoyance or some external agency seems to be\nindicated. In one striking case an officer cousin of one of the\nsitters purported to communicate, asking that his pearl tie-pin\nshould be given to the girl he would have married if he had lived.\nA full name was written, but it was unknown to the sitters, who\n^were also unaware of any engagement. It was found to have\nexisted, however, and the lady's name was the name written by\nouija : and a pearl tie-pin was found among the officer's belongings.\nOn the other hand, some of the \" communications \" were\napparently quite fictitious, as is so often the case with most\nautomatists.\nIn addition to these and other first-hand experiences, Sir William\nsketches the history of psychical research from his first experiments\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

He avows his own firm conviction\nthat human personality survives bodily death, while wisely remark-\ning that the investigation is not for everyone, and that it is a\nscience, not a religion. The psychical order is not the spiritual\norder ;\nspiritual advancement is by the inner not the outer way ;\nby the first-hand personal apprehension of God. But psychical\nresearch gets round materialism, and thus paves the way for\nrational as well as intuitive religious belief.\nOf the founders of the S.P.R., Sir William Barrett is now the\nonly one still with us, and of the original Vice-Presidents he and\nMr. A. J. Balfour are the only two remaining. These facts lend\nspecial interest to a volume by the veteran worker to whom all\nwho have been helped by the S.P.R. are indebted. And, being\ncritical in method and popular in style, it will do excellent service\nin training up the general public in the way it should go.\nJ. A. H.\nThe Soul and its Story A Sketch by NoRMAN Pearson. London,\nEdward Arnold. 1916. Pp. xx, 316.\nThough Mr. Pearson is hardly a profound or original philo-\nsopher, he discourses pleasantly enough about a large variety\nof interesting subjects (from the disembodied souls of dissociated\nmolecules and the inheritance of acquired characteristics to the\nfree-will puzzle and philosophic Absolutes) which are more or\nless connected with the question of the soul's immortality. Of\nthis belief he is very anxious to convince himself, and he duly\narrives at the conclusion that there is nothing in any of the\ntopics he speculates about to prevent him from being immortal.\nHe is also amiably disposed to concede immortality to others,\nindeed to \" the vast majority of the human race,\" though\n\" extinction may be the fate of an unfortunate few \" who\npersistently rebel against the divine order of things and get so\nshattered in consequence that they are \" resolved once more\ninto the mind-stuff \" out of which they were wrought (p. 315),\nMr. Pearson's speculations will not improbably appeal to those\nwho are willing to believe in the doctrine he advocates, but are\nhardly calculated to transform the logical aspects of the question,,\nwhich depends on obscure and disputed facts rather than on\nspeculations however ingenious. So even a sympathizer with.\n\fMat-June, 1917. Reviews. 61\nhis aim may feel that he hardly digs deep enough to undermine\nhis opponents' arguments or to clinch his own.\nFor one thing his method is too eclectic. It is as impossible\nto make the lion lie down with the lamb in the intellectual as\nin the physical sphere. The materialist cannot be made to agree\nwith the spiritualist by selecting passages they can both assent\nto. Neither will the a priori metaphysician and the empirical\nresearcher sanction each other's methods.\nSecondly, it is not much use to accept popular notions un-\ncriticized. The facts, e.g., that we are in the habit of describing\nbiological history as an '\nevolution ' and flatter ourselves that\nwe have '\nprogressed,' yield no scientific guarantee of any necessity\neither that '\nprogress '\nmust continue or that living beings must\ndevelop on the same lines as heretofore. To regard it as such\na guarantee is either a fallacy or at best an '\nover-belief.'\nWhat is still more serious, Mr. Pearson omits to explain what\nhe means by a soul. He calls it a '\nsubstance '\nindeed, and\napparently means by '\nsubstance '\na substratum or \" permanent\nsomething in the background \" (pp. 225, 227 ; of. p. 86). But\nhe does not discuss the difficulties many philosophers have found\nin this notion of substance nor the alternative view which makes\n'\nsubstance '\na product of activities, though he just mentions the\npossibility of conceiving the soul as an activity (p. 212). Nor\ndoes he make it clear how he stands with regard to the corollaries\nof attributing the old notion of '\nsubstance '\nto the soul. Would\nhe agree that it follows from it that the '\nsoul '\nis also simple\nand immutable ? And that what is simple must be immortal,\nbecause it cannot be dissolved into parts which it has not got ?\nIf he accepts these deductions, he is hardly entitled to the verdict\nhe passes on the empirical evidence of multiple personality (ch-\nxviii.), viz. that it \" does not disprove the essential unity of\nthe soul.\" If, on the other hand, he does not accept the whole\nbag of tricks of the old '\nrational psychology,' but holds that\nthe soul has 'parts' (pp. 238-9), and is extended, and can be\nprinted on (p. 222), and can change (p. 218), the questions of\nhow the soul generates a plurality of selves, simultaneous and\nsuccessive, supports them, is affected by them, and preserves\nits own unity in so doing, demand formal consideration. Had\nMr. Pearson fully realized this, he would not, I am sure, have\ntreated the empirical material about multiple personality merely\nnegatively as an objection to a preconceived theory ; he would\n\f'62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-junk, 1917.\nhave seen that it was relevant to the essential meaning to be\nassigned to the notion of soul. And he would then, I venture\nto think, have appreciated better the meaning and force of James's\npsychological description, which at present he misapprehends\n(ch. svi.). James showed that the term '\nself,' as ordinarily\nused, was ambiguous and covered both the '\nI '\nand the '\nMe.'\nOf these the '\nI '\nis never an object of knowledge, and hence,\nif a '\npermanent substratum ' is wanted and is to be called a\n'\nsoul,' the '\nI '\nmay be identified with that. It may also be\nidentified with the '\ntranscendental '\nfunction, which is the Kantian\n'\nEgo.' But it is not knowable, and cannot be shown to be\nindividual. All the differences that distinguish one person from\nanother fall within the '\nMe,' and so the '\nI '\nmay just as well\n(or better) be an Absolute or Universal Soul of which we are\nall the multiple personalities. These are not consequences Mr.\nPearson would welcome (cf. ch. xx.), but they are what comes\nof insisting on finding a '\nsubstance '\nbehind the actual in order\nto support the empirical self. James, on the other hand, was\nquite right to eschew this futile procedure, and to conceive the\n^ I '\nas a continuous appropriation of a mind's (or soul's or\nself's) past by its present. It is regrettable, perhaps, that he\nborrowed a term from the then dominant intellectualism and called\nthe '\nI '\na '\nthought,' and sometimes spoke as if the stream of\nconsciousness were really made up of a succession of such\n^\nthoughts,' like Mill's serial self ; but there can be no real doubt\nthat the keynote of his view is continuity, the continuity of the\nI '\nwith the '\nMe '\nand of the '\nMe '\nof one moment with that\nof the next. So these expressions cannot be pressed ; no one\nknew better than James how vain it is to multiply entities in\nthe unknowable. If the terms '\nsubstance,' '\nsoul,' '\nself,' '\nEgo,*\n'I,' 'spirit,' 'mind,' 'consciousness,' 'personality,' etc., are to\nhave any real meaning, they must be so used as to have value\nin the description of observable facts of our experience ; but\nat present there seem to be far more of them than philosophers\ncan advantageously employ, while they waste so much time\non disputing about them that they let the facts go by unobserved,\nand the psychical researches which alone could throw light on\nthese old questions are not undertaken for lack of researchers.\nFinally attention may be called to a good apergu of Mr. Pearson's\non p. 275. He rightly points out that monistic philosophers err in\ntrying to construe the development of the world as a process\n\fMay -June, 1917. Revieivs. 63\nof the reabsorption of the Many into the One, and that it looks\nrather like \" an orderly and elaborate process of disintegration.''\nThis is obviously true, but like so many good things, the suggestion\nhas been anticipated. A curious pessiini.st, who wrote under\nthe name of Mainlander, explained the unity of the universe\nas being a unity of origin, due to the common descent of all\nthings from an Absolute which was no longer in being because\nit had committed suicide, and so had imparted to them a common\nimpetus to dissociation and extinction. The divergence in the\nvalue-judgment thus passed on the world-process may not convince\nMr. Pearson that he was hasty in assuming that '\nevolution\n'\nmeant '\nprogress,' but it should at least convince him that it is\nnot enough merely to be assured that the soul is going on, but\nnecessary to inquire also what it is going on to. And for all\nhe has shown to the contrary Mr. Pearson's atomic souls may\nas greatly excel ours in the quality, as they do in the duration,\nof their terrestrial existence. F. C. S. Schiller.\nNOTES ON CUEP.ENT PEPtlODICALS.\nArchives de Psychologie, No. 62 (Dec. 1916). This Number has\nnothing that refers immediately to psychical I'esearch, but it contains\nan interesting theoretic article on the unconscious by Prof. C. G.\nJung, the Ziirich psycho-analyst. He endeavours ingeniously to\nsolve the problem of our psychic nature by a number of dis-\ntinctions, between the personal and the '\nimpersonal ' unconscious,\ni.e. that which our personality has '\nrepressed ' or not yet exhibited\nand that which is general and common to all minds, and between\nthe personality, the persona, the 'collective' soul and the indi-\nvidual ; but it does not appear that his distinctions are either\nobvious or demanded by the empirical facts or that they lead to\nanything, partly because they get entangled in the old logical\npuzzle of the particular and the universal, more perhaps because\nthe line drawn between the 'personal' and the 'collective' is\nessentially artificial and arbitrary. For, after all, the given fact is\nthe totality of psychic processes ; of these some can be selected\nand identified with similar and analogous processes observable in\nother minds, while others resist such assimilation. But this fact\nhardly entitles us to construct a '\ncollective soul ' out of the former,\nand to regard our figment as a substantive entity ; for it is only\nby ignoring the individual differences between the processes in\n\f6'4i Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1917.\ndifferent minds that we can call tliem 'the same.' Upon stricter\nscrutiny it will always be found that no two minds, and no two\nprocesses, are ever quite the same, and that the unique individuality\nof each soul colours all its contents, and renders it strictly incom-\nparable with any other. Hence the '\ncollective soul ' is a fiction,\nwhich becomes dangerously false, if it leads us to imagine that our\nactual personality can actually be constructed by superinducing an\nelement of particularity upon a general matrix.\nProf R. Weber relates some experiments he had made on himself\nto test his ability to estimate the lapse of time on waking from\nsleep : it does not seem that he was very successful, or that he\nimproved with practice. It appears from the book-reviews that\nthe war has not extinguished the debate about the feats of the\n'\nthinking ' animals in Germany. One observer concludes that the\ndog 'Rolf interprets signals unconsciously given him, a second\nreports that the arithmetical capacity of the blind horse Berto is\nindisputably genuine, while a third takes refuge in the telepathic\nexplanation.

For this essential preliminary;\nhowever, Dr. Crawford seems to have trusted mainly to his cer-\ntainty that if there had been a trick he must have observed it ;\nand his apparatus was introduced only mth a view to interpreting\nthe phenomena on the assumption that they were genuine. I\nquite admit that, from the description, it seems unlikely that if\nthere was trickery he would not have perceived it. But one can\nonly describe what one observes ; and much experience (in days\nnow long ago) in investigation of the physical phenomena of\nspiritualism, and further the experiments of Dr. Hodgson and\nMr. S. J. Davey (see Proceedings, Vol. IV. p. 381 and Vol. VIII.\np. 258), have convinced me that one's observation pitted against\ntrickery is very untrustworthy. In cases, therefore, where trickery\nis the explanation that has to be excluded,^ unaided observation\nshould be relied on as little as possible. In the Belfast case\nmeasurements are permitted\u2014a circumstance, as far as it goes, in\nfavour of the genuineness of the phenomena\u2014and my chief object\nin saying what I did was to indicate ways in which I hoped\nmeasurements might be applied to supplement observation in\njudging of that genuineness. I much hope that Dr. Crawford\nwill extend his experiments in this direction.\nI am glad that Dr. Crawford has invited other investigators to\nconfirm his observations. I understand from Sir William Barrett\nthat he was much impressed by the first sitting at which he was\npresent (at the second, nothing of much importance happened\nowing, it was thought, to the health of the medium). As one\nsitting is, of course, not enough, he is hoping to go again. I am\nglad too to hear that Sir Oliver Lodge may be able to go to\nBelfast.\nThe above was written before I had the opportunity of seeing\nK. F. R.'s letter, but it perhaps sufficiently meets his criticism of\nmy review. It is difficult, of course, to write so as to ensure\nbeing understood by the careless readers of whom he speaks, and\nto any careful reader it must, I think, have been obvious that I\ndid not regard it as established that there was any trickery in the\nmanifestations. What I complain of is that mechanical means have\n1 It is hardly necessary to say that in investigations of this kind tlic excellence\nof the character of the medium and her pecuniary disinterestedness do\nnot preclude the necessitj' of conditions excluding the possibility of trickery.\nPr.

Until this is done to a greater extent than it has yet\nbeen in investigations of the physical phenomena of spiritualism, the\ngenuineness of such phenomena is likely in my opinion to remain\nat best dubious. It is the business of conjurers and tricksters to\npersuade us that we see (or hear or feel) something different from\nwhat actually happens. When they have succeeded, our description\nof what has occurred would of course be erroneous. The only way\nof completely overcoming this difficulty is to obtain evidence other\nthan that of observation at the moment.\nB. M. S.\nOn Evidence of Survival.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nApril 26, 1917.\nDear Madam,\u2014I am much interested in the question of Cross-\ncorrespondences, and particularly impressed by the latest Willett\nscripts.\nAt the same time I am not yet satisfied that telepathy in the\nform of control from the living has been ruled out.\nI admit that so far experiments with the living have not yielded\nany results at all comparable to the elaborate and evidently\npurposeful dove-tailing of the scripts. Perhaps to expect that\nthey should do so is putting too great a strain on the powers,\nof the \" Sub-conscious \"'\nas we know them.\nBut have these experiments been made under the same conditions\nand with the same phsycic factors as are involved in the Piper-\nHolland-Willett and Verrall scripts ? The most important psychic\nfactors in all these cases being the connnon interest and the common\ndesire\u2014desire that a test-case may be provided, that a clue may\nbe found, that survival may be proved.\nNow, psychologically, desire, conscious or \" sub-conscious,'' if it\nbe strong enough, is the most purposeful and designing thing in\nthe universe. Dream-analysis gives us some idea of the extia-\nordinary power the ^mjclie has of elaborating and designing its\nmaterial according to its desire. It even -provides the material.\nAs the conditions of the dream-life are different, so the results\nare diflterent. But though we may get nothing like the cross-\ncorrespondences, we do get elaboration, dramatisation, cunning and\npurposeful design. If, then, the conditions for testing telepathy\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Researclt. biax-June, 1917.\nand thought-transference from the living were such that some\ndominant interest and desire were concerned it is just possible\nthat we might get results showing that even cross-correspondences\nin the form of jig-saw puzzles, such as the \" Bar of Dionysius,\"\nare not impossible between living minds.\nI don't want to show it. I want to show survival. But I\ncannot think it is even indicated, until every other hypothesis is\nruled out.\nMay Sinclair.\n\fNo. CCCXXXVIII.\u2014Vol. XVIII.

Thp. \"St. Paul\" Cross-Gorref^pondences Reviewed. 71\nTHE \" ST. PAUL \" CROSS-CORRESPONDENCES\nREVIEWED.\nBy Walter F. Prince, Ph.D.\nThe first instance in a \" Series of Concordant Automatisms,\"\nedited eight years ago by Mr. J. G. Piddington,^ is left by him one\nof second-rate importance. Further study seems to raise it to the\nfirst grade of value. This is said in no captious spirit. The whole\nmaterial to be analyzed was voluminous, and even indefatigable\nlabour might be excused for overlookuig some evidential points.\nIt is presumed that every investigator in this field is gratified if\nat any time new light is thrown upon an incident earlier canvassed\nby himself.\nBut the discovery of explanatory and unifying features lying\nclose below the surface, though they remained hidden for years,\nleads to the query whether spirits, if they are really endeavouring\nto communicate under difficulties which make them liable to the\nimputation of inanity, are not on their side oft-times wondering at\nwhat appears to them our stupidity.^\nThe automatists figurmg in the case under review were Mrs.\nPiper, who wrote in Sir Oliver Lodge's house at Edgbaston, Eng-\nland ; Mrs. Holland, who was throughout in India ; and Miss\nVerral], who was in some other place in England. Mrs. Holland\ndid not know that experiments were being initiated with Mrs.\nPiper. Miss and Mrs. Verrall knew that bare fact, but were not\nmade acquainted with the Piper and Holland scripts embodying\n(with Miss Verrall's) the \" St. Paul \" cross-correspondences, at\nleast until that series was completed. Here follows Mr. Pidding-\nton's entire report on this group of scripts :\nExtract from record of sitting loith Mrs. Piper held on Nov. 15, 1906.\n(Present: 0. J. L. and Lady Lodge.)\n(Hodgson communicating.) I am Hodgson.\n0. J. L. Glad to see you at last.\nHello Lodge. I am not dead as some might suppose. I am\nvery much alive.\n^Proceedings of the [English] Society for Psychical Research, Vol. XXII.,\ncontaining Part LVII., 1908.\n2 And there \\s prima facie evidence of this in the communications. For example,\nsee page 64 of the same Report. \" I can't register unless you understand well \"\n(Rector). Also page 179, \" You are a stupid lot if you can't understand when I\nam shouting at the top of my voice to make you understand \" (Hodgson).\ne2\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1917.\n0. J. L. Good, I expect so.\nSpeak to me.\n0. J. L. Are you interested in the cross-correspondences? Could you\nsend something to other communicators 1\nI am very and think it the very best thing.\n0. J. L. Could you send one now to one of the mediums 1\nI will go to Mrs. Holland. [Dr. Hodgson never knew anything\nabout Mrs. Holland ; but J. G. P. in the spring on 1906\nhad mentioned her name to Hodgson more than once in the\nsittings in Boston.]\n0. J. L. What will you send?\nSt. Paul.\n0. J. L. That is a good idea.\n'\nSt. Paul. I will give it to her at once.\n(After an interval.)\n0. J. L. Do you remember what you were going to say to Mrs. Holland ?\nSt. Paul.\n0. J. L. Yes, quite right.\nI will go at once.\n\"St. Paul\" did not appear in Mrs. Holland's script. There are,\nhowever, in the script of Miss Verrall two passages worth considering\nin this connection. [Note. \u2014I consider myself justified in looking for a\ncorrespondence in the script of an automatist other than the one to\nwhom the message was directed, because the trance-personalities were\nmore than once and in the most formal and definite terms asked to try\nto give these corresponding messages to all or any of the automatists-\nconcerned in these experiments, even though only one was specifically\nnamed when the experiment was arranged. To a critical mind the\nreflection will at once occur that the chances of success were hereby\nincreased. I agree ; but will content myself with saying that if any\nserious critic will carefully study all the evidence presented in this\nreport I shall not be afraid of his seeking to set down the successful\ncases of correspondence to chance in spite of the way in which the\nchances of success to the extent here stated were widened.]\nThe two passages in question occur in Miss Verrall's script of Jan. 12\nand Feb. 26, 1907. The script of Jan. 12 opens with a sentence in\nLatin, and then totally unconnected with it follow these words :\nthe name is not right robbing Peter to pay \u2014Paul ? sanctus\nnomine quod efficit nil continens petatur subveniet.\n\fJuly, 1917. The \"St. Paul\" Cvosf>-Gorrespondences Reviewed. 78\nThe script of Feb. 26 reads as follows :\nA tangle of flowers with green grass between wall flowers pansies\nwhy such hurry did you know that the second way was\nshorter you have not understood about Paul ask Lodge,\nquibus eruditis advocatis rem explicabis non nisi ad\nnormam refers hoc satis alia vana\nA tower of ancient masonry with battlements (a scrawl, perhaps\nrepresenting a signature \" A.T.\") astolat.\nThe last sentence and the opening phrases down to \"shorter \" seem\nto me clearly not to belong to the middle passages, the subject of which\nis dismissed with the words \" this is enough ; more is useless.\"\nThe Latin words in the script of Jan. 12 I interpret thus : \"Holy in\nname {i.e. with the title of saint) what she (or, he) is doing is of no use\n{i.e. by itself). Let the point (continens) be looked for ; it will help.\"\nThe Latin words of Feb. 26 I translate :\n\" By calling to your aid\nwhat learned men will you explain the matter? [Note.\u2014Or, if\n\"quibus\" is treated as a relative instead of as an interrogative, the\nwords should mean: \"when you have called these learned persons\nto your aid.\"] (You will not explain it) unless you refer it to one\nstandard. This is enough ; more is useless.\"\nThe only reference to Sir Oliver Lodge in Miss Verrall's script during\nthe period under review is the one quoted above. The names Peter and\nPaul do not occur elsewhere in Miss Verrall's script during the same\nperiod. It is natural, therefore, to put together the two scripts con-\ntaining the name Paul.\nIf we take these two passages to refer to the experiment arranged on\nNov. 15 it will be seen that the name Paul is given ; and that \"Lodge \"\nis correctly indicated as the person to explain about the name Paul.\nMiss Verrall never did apply to Sir Oliver Lodge as directed ; and it\nwas not until September, 1907, that the interpretation given above\nstruck me.\nI have said that \" St. Paul\" did not appear in Mrs. Holland's script,\nbut her script of Dec. 31, 1906, suggests an approach to the name of\nSt. Paul, and also suggests an explanation of the words in Miss Verrall's\nscript of Jan. 12, \"the name is not right robbing Peter to pay\u2014Paul.\"\nI transcribe the first half only of this script of Dec. 31, 1906, the\nsecond half having no connection with the first.\nII Peter 1. 15 [\" Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able\nafter my decease to have these things always in remem-\nbrance.\"]\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jolt, 1917.\n\" This witness is true \"\n\u2014\nIt is now time that the shadow should be lifted from your spirit\n\u2014\n\"Let patience have her perfect work.\" \"This is a faithful\nsaying.\"\nThis tvitness, etc., is not, I believe, a textual quotation, but is remin-\niscent of several passages from the writings of St. John.\nThis is a faithful saying occurs at least three times in St. Paul's\nEpistles.\nThe only name actually written is Peter, and this Peter is clearly\nSaint Peter. If we suppose that the scribe was aiming at getting \" St.\nPaul \" expressed, it looks as if he felt his way towards the name or\nnotion of St. Paul by quoting first from St. Peter, next from St. John,\nthen from St. James, and finally from St. Paul. I do not mean that I\nthink the process was thus deliberately involved, but that the scribe\n(whoever or whatever that may be) did the best that he could. A long\nway round may perhaps be the only way there. I further suggest that\nthe scribe having got so far could not proceed to get the name \"St.\nPaul \" written, and so had to content himself with quotation from his\nwritings.\nNow, read in the light of this interpretation, the words in Miss\nVerrall's script of Jan. 12, \" the name is not right robbing Peter to pay\n\u2014Paul,\" are suggestive.\nThe words nisi ad unam iiormam refers in Miss Verrall's script of Feb.\n26 may, perhaps, have been intended to mean that unless there was one\nperson in touch with all the automatists concerned in these experiments\nthe point would be missed in many instances ;\nor, in other words, that\na central exchange was necessary. In this case I was, so to speak, at\nthe central office, but though I was receiving Miss Verrall's script, and\nthough Sir Oliver Lodge sent me a copy of his record of the sitting of\nNov. 15,1 was not receiving a copy of Mrs. Holland's script ; and until\nI did receive a copy of it the significance of Miss Verrall's scripts of\nJan. 12 and Feb. 26 naturally escaped me. If, then, the words nisi ad\nunam normam refers can bear such an interpretation as I have sought to\nplace on them they were neither otiose nor mere padding.\nMost readers who have had the patience to follow me so far will, I\nfear, at this point form the opinion that all this may be more or less\ningenious rubbish, but that it is certainly rubbish. Had the experi-\nments produced no coincidences less problematical than this one, I\nshould heartily agree ; but there have been correspondences of the most\ndefinite character, and not only that, l;>ut in the production of them\nthere is evidence both of intelligent direction and of ingenuity. I care\n\fJur.Y, 1917. The \"St Paul\" Cross-Gorres'pondences Reviexved. 75\nnot to whom that intelligence be attributed : but that intelligence, and\nacute intelligence, lie behind the phenomena I stoutly maintain. And\nif this be once admitted, no excuse need be offered for trying to place\nupon them interpretations which otherwise would be over-subtle.\nRectifications.\nThus far the English report. We proceed to suggest some\nrectifications of the commentary upon the passages of script.\n1. The irrelevancy of the test II Peter 1. 15 is hardly abated\nby the intimation that the scribe \" felt his way \" toward the name\n\" St. Paul.\" But suppose that in the course of getting the figures\nthrough the subliminal mind and putting them on paper an error\nin one figure was made, and what the passage really meant is\nII Peter 3. 15. Then we have the lucidly relevant sentence naming\nand characterizing St. Paul, \" And account that the long-suffering\nof our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul,\naccording to the wisdom given unto him, hath written unto\nyou.\" When we consider that there is but one chance in\ntwelve of striking the one verse in the Petrine epistles which\nnames Paul, by altering one figure in the citation as given,\nthat this one verse is in the midst of 166 Petrine verses, and\nthat it is likewise the only verse mentioning him out of 734\nwhich make up the body of the non-Pauline epistles,'- it is\ndifficult to escape the conclusion that somebody was aiming at\nthis particular verse. Wlien we remember that the subjective\nexperiences of a writing psychic are often of an auditory\ncharacter,^ and then observe that \" first \" resembles \" third\n\"\nin sound more than any other ordinal, the conclusion becomes\nirresistible- that II Peter 3. 15 was meant. Granting this,\ngood judgment was displayed in not selecting a verse from the\nActs of the Apostles, which is largely a history of Paul, and\nnames him upwards of 150 times ; nor even selecting it from\nthe epistles written by him and which contain his name\ntwenty-nine times ; but in choosing the one place where it\n1 Reckoning the Epistle to the Hebrews as non-Pauline, as is almost certainly\nthe fact.\n-There are manj' indications of this in Mr. Piddington's report (pp. 95, 150,\n151, 279, 296, 304, 305, 392, etc.). Mrs. Piper, ceasing to write and about to\nemerge from trance, but not yet fully emerged, would begin to talk, and often\nmade casual allusions to what she had heard.\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1917.\nstands isolated amid the remaining New Testament literature of\nrising 4500 verses.\n2. Mr. Piddington thinks that \" This witness is true \" is not\na textual quotation, but \" is reminiscent of several passages in\nthe writings of St. John.\" On the contrary, it is a literal\ntextual quotation, and from St. Paul, being found in Titus 1. 13.^\n3. \" It is now time that the shadow should be lifted from\nyour spirit \" is reminiscent of the words of St. Paul in Komans\n13. 11, \" Now it is high time for you to wake out of your\nsleep,\" and, I think, of no passage from any other New Testa-\nment writer.\n4. As stated, \" This is a faithful saying \" occurs at least three\ntimes in St. Paul's epistles. It occurs four times, namely in\nI Timothy 1. 15 ; I Timothy 4. 9 ; II Timothy 2. 11 ; Titus 3.8.\nThus every passage names, quotes, or is reminiscent of a\nsentence from, St. Paul, except \" Let patience have her perfect\nwork,\" and that has a relevance presently to be explained.\n5. I think that the translation given of the Latin sentence\nof Jan. 12 misses the point contained which gives it special\ncogency, and venture to substitute another:\" \"Let a saint be\nsought contauaing in his name that which effects nothing ; he\nwill come to aid.\" This defines the name Paul, which contains\nthe root of the verb iravw, meaning to cease, to come to an\nend, a procedure pretty sure to effect nothing. The relevance\nof this also will be shown a little later.\nThe Sceipts in Cheonological Sequence.\nIt now appears that the logical order of the scripts is the\nchronological order. Their bearings upon each other will be\nmore readily perceived when they are so arranged.\nI. Mrs. Piper in Edgbaston, Eng., Nov. 15, 1906.\n[Hodgson purports to communicate.

This is\nsufficient, all else is useless].\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1917.\nInterpretation.\nWhen the materials are properly identified and placed in their\nchronological sequence, they are largely self-explicatory.\nHodgson announces through Mrs. Piper's automatic writing\nthat he will go to Mrs. Holland in India and endea\\our to make\nthe name \"St. Paul \" come out in her script.\nOf course, not having looked farther than II Peter 1. 15,\nMr. Piddington had to say that \" St. Paul did not appear in\nMrs. Holland's script.\" But, as already stated, we are forced\nby all the canons of probability to conclude that II Peter 3. 15\nwas meant, and this does contain the name St. Paul, together\nwith the most pointed and comprehensive characterization of\nhim, probably, afforded by any verse of the Scriptures. No\nmore emphatic, unmistakeable cross-correspondence could be\ndesired or imagined. And Mrs. Holland was the recipient, precisely\nin accordance with the intention announced in the Piper sitting.\nNot only had it been intended to cite a passage peculiarly\nmentioning St. Paul, but also three out of the four sen-\ntences which follow suggest Paul and him alone. One is a\ncharacteristic Pauline phrase, employed by him four times, but\nby no other Biblical author ; a second is solely from St. Paul's\npen ; a third is reminiscent of just one passage in the New\nTestament, and that by St. Paul. So instead of its being the\ncase that the scribe \" felt his way toward the name or notion\nof St. Paul by quoting first from St. Peter, next from St. John,\nthen from St. James and finally from St. Paul,\" the fact is\nthat only one of the five items, the passage from St. James,,\nbreaks away from the circle of Pauline reference.\nAnd why this one departure ? There seem to have been two\npurposes in Mrs. Holland's script, (1) to thoroughly adumbrate\nthe name \" St. Paul,\" (2) to intimate that there was a con-\ncealed significance in the name yet to be revealed by a process\nwhich might require patience, but for which the data is now\nsufiicient. On the basis of a great many remarks by purported\ncommunicators in the course of the entire series of experi-\nments,^ and of similar remarks reported elsewhere, it was rather\n'\nIf there are indeed \"communicators,\" it appears that, whatever may be the\nreasons wrapped up in the process of \"communication\" which is yet so obscure,\nthe \"communicators\" onlj' occasionally or partly see the actual script, and are\nsure that their intentions are rightly recorded, unless a sitter reads the message\n\fJuly, 1917. The \"St. Paul\" Cross-Correspondences Revieived. 79\nto be expected that Hodgson should not be aware that an\nerror had been made in setting down the citation which he\ngave. Assuming that II Peter 3. 15 came through correctly, he\nemphasizes it with the sentence, from Paul but apposite no\nmatter what its source, \" This witness is true.\" ^ the cross-\ncorrespondence was supposed to be now successfully accom-\nplished and Mrs. Holland's script was regularly being sent to\nMiss Johnson in England, it was pertinent to say, presumably\nto the person who should do the comparing of scripts (for\nthere is no reason to suppose that \" you \" refers to Mrs.\nHolland), \" It is now time that the shadow should be lifted\nfrom your spirit,\" paraphrasing another sentence of St. Paul, the\nmore to drive home what matter is to be illuminated. But\nsince we \" on this side,\" in spite of our smugness in dealing\nwith \" spirits,\" do miss points just below the surface, and\narrive at conclusions without sufficient consideration (a tendency\nto be illustrated in this very instance), the injunction of St.\nJames appropriately follows, \" Let patience have her perfect\nwork.\" The warning is clinched, and the attention brought\nback to Paul by the final sentence from that apostle, \" This\nis a faithful saying.\" . .\nMrs. Holland's script was sent to Miss Johnson in England,\nwho presumably received the original or a copy of Mrs. Piper's\nalso.^ She did not discover the error in the Petrine citation.\nAnd then in a third script not by Mrs. Holland, not by Mrs.\nPiper, but by another party who was ignorant of the former\nscripts. Miss Verrall, there appeared recognition that an error\nhad been made, a clear apprehension of the nature of the\nerror and the resultant confusion, and knowledge that when\nthe right and specified name should be found in siti all\naloud. Witness a few out of many illustrations in the present report. \" I shall\nbe glad to know if the word Mourn or Mown came out \" (Prudens), p. 39.\n'\n' When\nshe receives it let me know kindly\" (Myers), p. .55. \"Did she [Mrs. Verrall]\nreceive the word Evangelical?\" (Myers), p. 59. \"He [Myers] will be very glad\nto understand that the triangle came through, as he did see the circle but could\nnot be absolutely sure of the whole triangle\" (Rector), p. 72. \"Got arrow\nyet?\" (Hodg.son), p. 80.\n1 Note that the passage from Peter is emphatically one which bears witness as to\nthe endowments and authority of Paul.\n-See page 22 of the Report. Mr. Piddington did not see the Holland script\nuntil later.\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1917.\nconfusion would disappear. \" The name is not right robbing\nPeter to pay\u2014Paul.\" This implies a number of things : that\na mistake has been made or is impending regarding a name,\nthat the choice lies between the names Peter and Paul, that\nthe misapprehension relates to ths Biblical quotation in con-\nnection with which only has the name of St. Peter come out\nin a script. The dash before \" Paul \" implies that the proverb\nis not to be taken in merely its general sense, but that the\nname Paul has special significance. Since the misapprehension\njelates to a passage which as cited calls to attention only the\nname Peter, what can that significance possibly be than that\nthe name Paul is the name to be sought for ? And the right\npassage will be found to take from Peter in order to give\ncredit to Paul. \" Let a saint be sought containing in his name\nthat tvhich effects nothing. He ivill come to aid.\" With the\nattention already directed to the name \" Paul,\" the hint is\ngiven to examine that name and be convinced that it is the\none meant by finding contained in it a root with a peculiar\nmeaning. Moreover, that very meaning will hint at the per-\nseverance competent to discover the passage which will aid to\nclear up the whole matter.\nThe hints not being effectual. Miss Verrall's script later returned\nto the task. \" You have not understood about Paul.\" This re-\npetition of the name \" Paul \" is not only another cross-corre-\nspondence in itself, but is also an intimation that the data given\nelsewhere should be re-examined. Ash Lodge.\" Here is mention\nof the very man in whose presence the chosen word was started\non its way, and the indication of a hope that this man, if con-\nsulted, may be able to put two and two together. \" By calling\nto your aid what learned men ivill you explain the ^natter\nunless you carry it to one norm ? This is sufficient. All else\nis useless.\" And very true it was that all efforts, however\nlearned, to puzzle out the enigmatic sentences now brought\ntogether from far-separated lands, and to make them mean\nsomething in relation to each other, would be useless, unless\nthey were all brought to the one norm of the third chapter of\nsecond Peter, fifteenth verse, which would be sufficient to ex-\nplain and knit them together.\nTherefore the norm was not Mr. Piddington,^ but the intended\n^ See above, p. 74.\nI\n\f-JuLT, 1917.

The norm was a\npassage taken from Peter, but giving credit to Paul, stamped by\na name containing a certain significant root ; a name which the\nmoment it was found in this place would link together all the\nsentence in the various scripts, in their chronological and con-\nsecutive order.\nNOTE ON DR. PEINCE'S REVIEW OF THE \" ST. PAUL \"\nCROSS-CORRESPONDENCE.\nDr. Prince's case rests upon a textual emendation, or, I should\nrather say, a textual alteration. He changes Mrs. Holland's\n\"II Peter 1. 15\" into \"II Peter 3. 15\"; and his justification\nfor making this change is that, if II Peter 3. 15 be substituted\nfor what the automatist really wrote, a more effective cross-\ncorrespondence with Mrs. Piper's and Miss Verrall's scripts\nwill result.\nDr. Prince tells us that \" Ave are forced by all the canons of\nprobability to conclude that II Peter 3. 15 was meant.\" I\nwish he had told us what all these canons are ; for until they\nare revealed, and unless, when they are revealed, they prove\nto be very big gmis, I for my part shall prefer to abide\nby what the automatist wrote.\nTextual emendation is great fun, but it isn't always \"cricket.\"\nIn the case of classical authors, where the text as originally written\nis not available, but only a text which has run the gauntlet of\nmany copyings, it is often desirable. But in the case of scripts\nwe possess the original text ; and emendation, except as regards\nmere slips of the pen, ought to be eschewed\u2014even at the cost of\nthereby failing to improve a cross-correspondence !\nIn the case of ordinary literature, ancient or modern, the\nauthor may be presumed, with some rare exceptions, to be\nexpressing ideas in a consecutive, rational and logical form ;\nand so, if a passage occurs which makes, or appears to make,\nnonsense as it stands, it is legitimate to make verbal changes\nwithin certain limits with a view to improving the sense. But\nwith scripts this is not the case. They are for the most part\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jolt, 1917.\nsketchy, inconsequent and. in the strict sense of the word,\nincoherent. To attempt, then, to emend a script when its\ngeneral tenour is not discernible, is a risky proceeding.\nI do not say that emendation of a script is never allowable.\nIn certain circumstances I should not hesitate to adopt an\nemendation. Take, for instance, these words in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript of March 25, 1907 :\n\"remember the Virgilian line indignantis sub umbras.\"\nHere obviously \"indignantis\" is a mere slip for \"indignata.\"\nOr, again, in Miss Verrall's script of Aug. 27, 1915, there occur\nthe words: \"calm and deep east.\" As a few weeks earlier in\none of her scripts \"calm and deep peace\" had been correctly\nquoted from In Memoriam xi., it is safe to conclude that\n\"east\" is merely a slip for \"peace.\" At the same time an\nobvious emendation is not necessarily a sound one. Thus,\nMrs. Verrall's script of March 25, 1907, from which I have\nalready quoted, has the words :\n\" clavem gerens trans Pontem (drawing of a bridge)\ntrans Hellespontem.\"\nTo alter \"Hellespontem\" into \" Hellespontum \" would be easy,\nbut not necessarily right ; for though \" Hellespontem \" does not\nexist, and though it may be merely a slip, it is quite as likely to\nbe an intentional play on the preceding \"Pontem.\"\nFurthermore, it is one thing to emend a word or phrase in\na script when the immediate context of it can be shown to\nsupport the emendation ; and quite another thing to emend a\nword or phrase in a script of A's on the strength of something\nto be found in a script of B's. To do the latter begs, or\ncomes perilously near to begging, the whole question at issue :\nnamely, whether there is or is not a supernormal connexion\nbetween the scripts of various automatists.\nIf Mrs. Holland after writing \"II Peter 1. 15\" had then\nadded some words from II Peter 3. 15, Dr. Prince's contention\nthat 1. 15 was an error for 3. 15 would, I think, have been\nboth legitimate and likely ; but no such words were added, and\nthere is nothing in the context to show that any dissatisfaction\nwas felt with the reference as given, and nothing to suggest\nthat it was not the reference intended.\nI do not, and, as reference to Proc. Vol. XXII., p. 35, wiU\ni\n\fJuly, 1917. Note on \" St. Paul \" Cross-Correspondence. 83\nshow. I never did attach much importance to the \" St. Paul\n\"\ncross-correspondence. But whatever its value may be, I did\nnot try to enhance it by tampering with the text of one of\nthe scripts which contribute to the cross-correspondence. If we\nonce begin to alter our facts to suit our theories, our critics\nwill have a glorious time of it, \u2014unless, indeed, they decide to\nleave us alone as being beneath criticism.\nJ. G. PiDDINGTON.\nREVIEW.\nPsychical Investigations. By J. Arthur Hill. 8vo, 288 pp. (Cassell.\n6s.)\nThis book will add to the reputation which Mr. Hill's previous works\nliave earned for him as a careful and dispassionate investigator.\nThere are three chapters dealing respectively with Immortality, Pre-\nexistence and the Nature of the After-Life, and Psychical Research\nand Religion, but the bulk of the book is properly concerned with\nactual investigation, and gives accounts of sittings held with mediums\nby the author and discussions of the results obtained. Mr. Hill is\nconvinced of the reality of communications from the dead, but he\npresents each incident with fairness, and is always at pains not to\nstrain the evidence in doubtful cases.\nAn evidentially strong case is that of Elias Sidney (pp. 17 ff.)\nThe medium was A. Wilkinson, who at a sitting in January, 1915,\nsaid :\n\" There is a man by that bookcase, a very old man, big, full-\nfeatured. Been gone some time; old-fashioned shirt, white, very\nclean. Elias Sidney. Politics interested him; rather a strong poli-\ntician\u2014Radical or strong Liberal. Been dead some time. Somebody\nbrought him, somebody on the other side, who has manifested here\nbefore.\" More followed, identifying Sidney and connecting him with\na Mr. Leather whom Mr. Hill had known. Sidney had died six years\nbefore, and seven weeks before his friend Leather. The point is that\nMr. Hill had never heard of Sidney, nor had several of Leather's friends,\nof whom inquiries were made. At last he found one who had known\nSidney well, and stated that at his death he \" had long been retired\nfrom public life, being a very old man. He was one of a coterie of\nfriends, all vigorous Liberals. I was one. Mr. Leather ims another.\"\nFurther inquiries showed that the description of Sidney's personality\nwas accurate, and it was disco^'ered that the reason why several of\nLeather's friends knew nothing of Sidney was that the two met only\n\f84 Joxirnal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1917.\nat their club. Ten years' acquaintance with the medium has convinced\nMr. Hill of his honesty, and it appears to be to the last degree unlikely\nthat Wilkinson could have obtained his knowledge of Sidney\u2014who, as\nhas been said, had died, after long retirement, six years previously\n\u2014\nby any normal means. The full account of the case as given by\nMr. Hill is well worth study, for its evidential force is certainly beyond\nthe ordinary.\nOther exceptionally good cases are those of Lewis (pp. 82 ft'.), Ruth\nRobertshaw (pp. 172 ft\".), and Sir Oliver Lodge, a \"psychometric\"'\ncase (pp. 182 ff.), and the book contains many others which are a\nuseful addition to the mass of evidence for survival already in our\npossession, the interest of which consists chiefly in its cumulative value.\nIt has become not unusual to insert in works like the present\nchapters on theology and religion, and attempts are made to construct-\nat least the basis of a religion out of the results of psychical research.\nThe value of such essays, however much thought and study they may\nrepresent, as in Mr. Hill's case, seems to me doubtful. Theology and\nreligion are subjects too great to admit of effective treatment in the\nlimits of a chapter or two, and the knowledge which has been acquired\nthrough psychical investigations seems to me wholly inadequate to-\nsupport any such superstructure. All it can do, what it has already\ndone, is eff\"ectually to destroy the non-religion of materialistic philo-\nsophy. I do not find in it any constructive power. Moreover, the\nvalue of these discussions is in any case impaired by the fact that they\nproceed on a tacit assumption that the Christian view of our Lord's\npersonality is untenable. But surely a disproof of the soundness of\nthat view is a necessary antetedent to the construction of any new\nreligion. He holds the field, and, so far as I am aware, we still await\na successful evasion of the ancient dilemma si non Deus, non bonus.\nLombroso's solution of the difiiculty, that He was a \" megalomaniac,\"\nwill not bear even superficial examination.\nOn one subsidiary point in this connexion I must permit myself to\nexpress unqualified dissent from Mr. Hill. He writes on p. 228 :\n\" It\n['individual survival of bodily death'] is rarely preached about or\nwritten about. Clei-gymen shy at discussing it ;\nthey have no vital\nbelief in it themselves.\" The author's whole book bears the stamp of\nsincerity, and no doubt he believes these astounding statements to be\ntrue, but how he could have come to that belief passes imagination.\nIndividual survival is of the very essence of the Gospel, and every\nsermon preached, every appeal made to a congregation, proceeds on the\nassumption that preacher and hearers are agreed on the point, even if\n\fJuly, 1917. Review. 85\nit is not specially emphasised, as of course it frequently is. Except\nwith the belief in personal survival, the Christian religion has no\nmeaning to any man.\nMr. Hill makes another strange statement when he writes on p. 3 in\nthe chapter on Immortality, \" There will be no identity with our\npresent selves. 'Persons' are not immortal; for their personality\nchanges.\" He is arguing from the fact that a man is not \"the same\"\nas he was when a baby. It is not worth while to refute the fallacy of\nthis reasoning, which rests on nothing more nor less than the ambiguity\nof the word \"same.\"\nOn the rationale of psychometry Mr. Hill comes to what seems\nto me a more sound conclusion. A lady, a friend of his, died\non November 3, 1915. On November 8 some objects which had\nbelonged to her were given to a medium without result; she \"was\nsaid to be still mostly sleeping the recuperative sleep which follows\ndeath.\" Next day there was \"a gleam of evidentiality in a short\nmessage,\" though this was accompanied by \"several quite incorrect\nstatements.\" On the 11th the objects were given to a medium in\nLondon, who did not know Mr. Hill, by a lady who did not know the\ndeceased ; but this medium, who had been told nothing of the date of\nthe death, said she was \"afraid it was too soon,\" and no results were\nobtained. After two other unsuccessful attempts on November 25 and\nMarch 2, 1916, Mr. Hill obtained on April 19, with the medium\nWilkinson, \" the first coherent and considerable evidence of my friend's\nidentity and initiative.\" He adds: \"Now if psychometry were only a\nreading of indications somehow imprinted on an object, would not the\nsensitives have been able to read them at first, and indeed best then,\nwhile they were fresh ? The failure at first, and the gradual improve-\nment later, is certainly an indication\u2014it would be too much to call it\na proof\u2014that communications depend on the reality and activity of the\nsurviving mind with which the rapport-object links us up, and not\nprimarily on the object itself.\" M. A. Bayfield.\nCOEKESPONDENCE.\nOn Evidence of Survival.\nI.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.E.\nJune 13, 1917.\nDear Madam,\u2014The point raised by Miss May Sinclair, that on the\nanalogy of the facts established by Dr. Freud and his school we must\nlay stress upon the potential operation of a desire for evidence as an\n\fS6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1917.\ninductive factor \u2014a stimulus, inducing in the unconscious mind a\ntendency to construct and elaborate fictitious evidence\u2014is, I am con-\nvinced, of great ps}'chological importance. I should like to suggest,\nhowever, that a further consideration is involved.\nDesire is in itself interpretative ; the question is whether its inter-\npretations are in any given case true, or false, or of the symbolical\nquality that lies between absolute truth and absolute falsehood. Ruling\nout these absolutes, neither of which are experientially known, we\ncome to a question of the relative value of different sj^mbolisms. The\nsymbolism induced by the creative desire of a great poet is relatively\ntrue : the symbolism induced by the obscure desire that prompts the\naverage dream is relatively false. What of the symbolism by which we\n\" get through \" the apparent evidence of survival?\nMy suggestion is that, so far from trying to eliminate the factor of\ndesire, we should recognise that desire is a necessary factor in all\nprocesses of mind, and try to regard it qualitatively. The desire for\ntruth, for instance, can be distinguished from the desire for a lax\nspiritual comfort. The former desire will admit the difficulties and\nmuddles that confront the serious psychical investigator, while the\nlatter desire will snatch at a merely subjective satisfaction, taking\neverything for granted and stumbling into all the pitfalls.\nWe have evidence enough that the best apparent proofs of survival\nhave been duly filtered through minds whose chief concern is for truth ;\nthe crucial question remains, whether these proofs indicate survival in\nthe sense ordinarily understood, or whether they represent the nearest\napproximate symbol that we can at present realise of a truth of\ncontinuity which is beyond our present comprehension. A crucial\ndilemma, such as this, usually turns out to contain a common, recon-\nciling term ; and I suggest that in this case the reconciling term is,\nsimply, continuity. That is a truth of which the superconsciousness\nof mankind has always been aware ;\npsychical science is now, at last,\nbeginning to investigate, gropingly, its factual basis. In this investi-\ngation we cannot leave out desire without leaving out mind ; the only\nquestion is whether we are raising desire to its highest possible inter-\npretative level. If so, even our most glaring mistakes will illuminate\nthe path of our successors. K. F. R.\nII.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam, \u2014Your correspondent Miss May Sinclair raises an\ninteresting question which has been already considered in a general\nway, namely, whether it is possible for the subconscious to be\n\fJULT, 1917. Correspondence. 87\nactuated by desire independently and without the knowledge (so\nto say) of the normal consciousness.\nIt would seem that were it possible it could never be proved.\nThe agent would have to be certain that no thought had emanated\nfrom him or her having any connection however remote with the\ncontent of the script produced by the percipient.\nThe Journal some years ago reported an interesting case of the\npostman \" E \" whose crystal vision of a drawing-room, in which\nthere was a cut-glass chandelier, was traced under hypnosis to a glass\nknob he had seen in a church the same day : a slender enough connection.\nEven had a number of automatists produced scripts containing,\nlet us say, allusions to various objects in this drawing-room\n\u2014\ne.g.\na rare carpet, a particular portrait, some unique ornament \u2014before\n\" E \" looked into the crystal, the case would have been traceable\nto the glass knob and been somewhat analagous to Mr. Piddington's\nexperience and agency in the \"Sevens\" cross-correspondence. To\nmake the cross-correspondence conform to type, moreover, \"E\"\nwould have subconsiously to give telepathic injunctions to the eflfect\nthat other scripts were concerned or would make the matter clear.\nA similar case might conceivably arise on the lines of the incident\nreported by Mr. Andrew Lang, where a scryer experimenting for\na friend saw a vision connected with a person reading the paper at\nthe other end of the room. But here also it is probable that the\nsubject of the vision or some train of thought connected with it\nhad crossed the conscious mind of the unwitting agent before or\nat the time of the experiment. To be conclusive, moreover, the\ncross-correspondence would have to be unmistakably traceable to the\nagent, and him alone : an almost impossible condition to establish.\nExperiments on these lines would thus appear to be impossible.\nThey are, moreover, in the upshot attempts consciously to experi-\nment with the unconscious.\nYour correspondent suggests that dreams afford an example of\nthe capacity of the subconscious to be actuated by desire.\nBut there is a good deal of evidence proving that dreams are\ndue to or connected symbolically or otherwise with the desires of\nthe waking self ; and it would again be difficult if not impossible\nto prove the contrary. Even where the subconscious mind in\npathological cases is recalcitrant under hypnosis and refuses to\naccept suggestion, the obsession or id^e fixe is the result of the prior\ninfluence of the supraliminal self, or to some psychic perturbation\nof which it is or has been aware.\n\f88: Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1917.\nI would in conclusion contend, though with considerable diffidence,\nthat the subconscious mind is incapable of absolutely spontaneous\nvolition, independent of influences with which the normal mind\nhas been or is cognisant, and that experiments of the kind\nsuggested by your correspondent are therefore a priori impossible.\nI am not aware that the question has been thoroughly examined\nby the Society, although it has been considered. One remembers.\nMiss Johnson's remark that to produce cross-correspondence on\nthese lines committee meetings of the subliminals of the automatists.\nwould seem to be necessary to allot the scripts.\nErnest S.

Wilkinson,\nof 7 The Avenue, Clifton, York, twice dreamt vividly of an\nair-raid at a time when one was actually in progress at a\ndistance. On the first occasion it is possible that Miss Wilkin-\nson may have received some intimation of the raid by normal\nmeans during sleep ; on the second occasion this hypothesis\ndoes not seem tenable. In view of the frequency with which\nair-raids occurred during the month of September, and of\nthe degree of expectation which was thereby aroused, it\nis worth while to call attention to the fact that at the time\nof Miss Wilkinson's dreams she had no special reason to\nanticipate a raid.\n1. The first report we received was in a letter from Miss\nWilkinson, as follows :\n7 The Avenue, Clifton, York,\nAugust 23, 1917.\nI do not know whether you will consider the following incident\nworth recording. In the night of Tuesday last, August 23rd-24th,^\nthere was an air raid alarm in this town. The warning is only\ngiven by lights going out, and as I was already in bed I knew\nnothing of it until I went down to breakfast in the morning. Our\nnight nurse was sitting up with my Mother ; she is very nervous,\nand in previous alarms and raids has been much frightened. How-\never, this time, because we had had such an anxious time, she put\na great compulsion on herself and did not call me, but she has\nbeen saying ever since that she cannot understand how she was\nable to do it^\u2014she did not seem to be herself at all. The effect\non me was that I had a very vivid dream of a raid : I saw\n^In replj'ing to this letter we called Miss Wilkinson's attention to the discre-\npancy in the date, Tuesday being August 21. She replied on August 25, 1917 :\n\" I am sorry for my stupid mistake in the date. Tuesday was of course the 21st.\"\nIt will be seen that Miss Wilkinson's first letter was written on August 23, 1917,\nwhich makes it clear that her reference to \" August 23rd-24th \" was a slip of the\npen.\n\fOct. -Nov., 1917.

On that I awoke, and it was 6.30 a.m. Some bombs\nwere dropped on villages near the Humber, I see by the papers.\nNo remarks had been made about Zeppelins for a long time\npreviously, and the general impression was that we had finished\nwith them. In spite of being in innumerable alarms at Hull and\nhere, I have never dreamt of a raid before.\nMarian S. Wilkinson.\nWe then wrote to Miss Wilkinson asking if she had related\nher dream to anyone before she knew of the raid and if a\nstatement could be obtained from the nurse. We also asked\nwhether there was any possibility that Miss Wilkinson could\nhave heard the bombs in her sleep. Miss Wilkinson replied\nas follows :\n7 The Avenue, Clifton, York,\nAugust 25, 1917.\nI will try and answer the questions in your letter.\n1. Unfortunately I did not mention my dream before hearing\nof the alarm. I most probably should have done, but I had\nno opportunity. On going down to breakfast about 8.20 I met\nMrs. Mercer (the night nurse) on the stairs, and as soon as ever\nshe saw me she said, \" Do you know there has been an alarm\nin the night ?\n\" I replied, \" That is curious, because I have\nhad such a vivid dream of a raid \"\u2014or words to that effect. She\nwas the first person I saw that morning. I enclose her statement.\n2. It is very difficult to get reliable information as to where\nbombs fell. Those mentioned in the paper fell near Hull, about\n45 miles from here (Hull is 42). During the war I have been\ngoing backwards and forwards weekly between my school in\nHull and my home here, so that I have always had definite\nknowledge of the numerous raids in both places, and I have\nnever heard of any case where a raid in Hull was heard here,\nnormally, or vice versa. A relief buzzer went about 3.30, and\nwas heard by Mrs. Mercer ; I do not know whether I could have\nheard that in my sleep. I am not familiar with it, never having\nheard it in use ; several people who did hear it thought it was\nthe whistle of a train. (My dream was not until just before\n6-30.) Marian S.

When I awoke it was 4 a.m. A cousin\nwas sharing my room, and when she awoke about 7.45 I told\nher of my dream ; I had not been downstairs or seen anyone\nelse. We rather smiled to think of my having dreamt the dream\non a night so unlikely, as we thought, for a raid ; there was\na brilliant moon and a high barometer.

The earlier\nZeppelin-raids\u2014it will be remembered\u2014usually took place\non moonless nights.

Cases. 97\n\u2022 July 25, 1917.\nI think I have heard that there is a good deal of discussion\nas to the length of time which dreams take, and whether some\nexternal thing, like a noise, produces the dream, or is merely\nworked into it. I had an idiotic dream this morning (as a rule\nI do not consciously dream much, nor remember the particulars\nafterwards) which seemed to me to bear on these two points,\nso I have written it down.\nThe Dream.\nThis morning, July 26, 1917, I dreamt that I was going to\ntake 3 cats (tabby) and a black and white kitten for a walk\nto . They all belonged to . One of the cats had been\nill so I had to carry her. I went out with them at the front\ndoor. It was the old front door at top of steps, and I went\ndown the steps into the porch which was as it used to be when\ncarriages drove into it. The cat I was carrying was heavy and\nslipped in my arms, and while I was trying to adjust it, I heard\na knock at the front door, inside. I waited a few moments\nand then hearing the knock again, I went back and opened\nthe door, wondering as I went why the person knocking did\nnot open the door themselves. I found the o'd housekeeper\nMrs. inside (as you know, she left us about 6 or 8 years\nago and is now dead). Just then I heard the knocking again.\nShe said she had not knocked, and we could not make out\nwhere the knocking came from. I heard it again, and wondered\nwhether it came from the Red room above, and went out to\nlook up and see. Knocking came again, but did not seem to\nbe from there. Then I suppose I began to awake for at the\nnext knock I began to think it must be my maid knocking\nat my bedroom door\u2014which proved to be the case.\nWhen I got up I asked my maid whether she had knocked\nmore than once, and she said she had knocked 7 or 8 times\nwith a few seconds between each knock, and had begun to think\nI must have gone to the bathroom already, when at last I\nanswered.

Oct.-Nov., 1917.\nThe interest of the dream lies in the fact that it is possible\nto trace fairly accurately the relation between the real time\nand the dream time. In this case the length of time apparently\noccupied by the events of the dream seems to have been\nabout the same as the time occupied by the repeated knocking\nat the door, that is the external event which was reflected\nin the dream and in part at least gave rise to it.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe \"St. PAUii\" Cross-Correspondences.^\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014Has sufficient emphasis been placed on the words\n\" the name is not right robbing Peter to pay\u2014Paul \" which\nappear in Miss Verrall's script ?\nIf, \u2014and Mr. Piddington would appear to agree\u2014we take this\npassage to refer to the experiment arranged on Nov. 15, 1906, the\nfollowing argument is possibly sound.\nConsider the words \" the name is not right robbing Peter to\npay\u2014Paul \" by themselves alone without reference to any other\nscript. What do they suggest ? They suggest a previous experi-\nment in which the name Paul or something relating directly\nto the name was to be got through, hut in which Peter had\nbeen used for the purposes of Paul. Is not this a conclusion that\nMiss Verrall might have arrived at from a consideration only\nof her own script ? I suggest that I have put no gloss on the\nwords of her script.\nIf the above reasoning be sound what should we expect when\nwe consider Mrs. Holland's script ? We should expect script\nattempting to get a cross-correspondence in which the name Paul\nwas involved, and involved as a leading factor. For Miss Verrall\nknew that experiments for cross-correspondences were on foot\nbetween Sir Oliver and Mrs. Piper, though she knew nothing\nof what any particular experiment was. I submit that the\nmessage to her, considered alone, gave her information not only\nas to a previous experiment but that the leading factor in the\nexperiment was the name Paul. Bear in mind that the names\nPeter and Paul do not occur elsewhere in the Verrall script\nduring the same period.\niSee Jour. S.P.I!., July, 1917.\n'\ni\n\fOcT.-Nov., 1917. Correspondence. 99\nNow turn to the Holland script. Assume in the first place\nit was not so definite as it was, that is, assume there was only\na bare reference to II Peter,\u2014no chapter or verse given.\nThen what have we ? We have in Miss Verrall's script reference\nto an experiment in which the name Paul was the leading factor\nand in which experiment the name was wrong, because Peter\nwas used to rob Paul, and we have in Mrs. Holland's script an\nEpistle of Peter referred to in which the name Paul occurs and\noccurs only once,\u2014Peter is '\nrobbed ' for emphasis of the name\nPaul. Even thus there is cross-correspondence.\nBut, as the matter stands, it is far more definite. For the\nreference in Mrs. Holland's script to II Peter i. 15, and by\nthe slight emendation suggested by Dr. Prince, we have a direct\nand striking cross-correspondence. For II Peter iii. 15 marks\nthe one reference in St. Peter's Epistle to Paul : Peter is robbed\nto pay\u2014Paul.\nThis proposed emendation is not the result of a bow drawn\nat a venture. It is euggested by the very form of Miss Verrall's\nscript. . .\n\u2022\n\" F. C. Constable.\nOn the Evidence for Survival.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014While there are certain points in the comments\nof Dr. Jacks mentioned in the May-June Journal, which have\na limited acceptance, they may produce an illusion in regard to\nwhat proof is. I agree with Sir Oliver Lodge that survival has\nbeen scientifically proved, but it is equally true that there have\nnot been large conversions. Belief, however, is no part of proof.\nDarwinism was proved by the Origin of Species in 1859, but\nit was not much believed before 1880.\nMr. Jacks is sound when he says that \" the will to disbelieve\nis as active as the will to believe,\" but I think him unfortunate\nin his illustration of the \" ingenuity \" which he says may dis-\nqualify belief on any problem. It is true enough that human\n\" ingenuity \" can say anything in opposition to a claim, but\nsaying an \" objection \" is not making it this. Objections require\nas much proof as assertions. They are often only negative pro-\npositions in disguise. Human \" ingenuity \" is mostly ignorance and\nof course you cannot argue against ignorance. Mr. Jacks thinks we\ncould not produce \" conclusive proof \" that we had passed through\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct. -Nov., 1917.\nour own doors, though saying no one could doubt it. I would say\nthat the fact that no doubt existed about it was proof. If a\nthing cannot be proved it may be doubted, unless you assert\nthat proof is not the basis of belief. If this be true, we are\nreduced to a state of war at once. If we cannot agree on a\nfact, it is not proved, though not because the agreement is a part\nof the proof, but the fact of agreement is evidence that the\nproof exists in some measure. It is true that there is \" ingenuity\n\"\nenough to raise apparent doubts about the most assured things,\nbut a little investigation will show that the difficulty is either\nwith our ignorance in regard to what evidence is, or with paradoxes\nnot easily resolved, or equivocations not easily detected. These\nare not grounds for doubt but are children's puzzles.\nMr. Jacks also shows some interesting confusion about personality\nand continuity. He seems to distinguish between them in too\nradical a way. The fact is that continuity is one of the main\ncharacteristics of personality and personal identity one of the\nmain conditions of it. He assumes that we ought first to prove\nthe continuity of life and then personal identity. But you cannot\nprove this continuity except by proving personal identity. That\nis all that we mean by the continuity of life after death. Personal\nidentity includes consciousness and usually self-consciousness, and\nany continuity without this would be no life at all. Hence we\ncannot prove the continuity without proving the personal identity.\nI should be cautious about entering into any elaborate theory\nof personal identity, as that might lead to conceptions far more\ndoubtful, as the thing to be proved, than the evidence for survival.\nThe trouble with philosophers usually is that they muddle almost\neverything they touch. The conception of personal identity does\nnot require a large treatise to make it plain. All its complications\nmay require this, but not the general conception of it. It is\nsimply the general stream of consciousness with their mnemonic\nconnection plus the continuity of kind which makes the stream\nidentical even when we are not self-conscious of that identity.\nOr briefly, it is the stream of mental events with a memory\nconnection, and that definition suffices for determining whether\nthe observed facts support the continuance of them after the\ndissolution of the body. That is, do the facts observed after\ndeath prove the existence of the same stream we knew before\ndeath ? That is all we need for our work.\n\fOct. -Nov., 1917. Correspondence. 101\nAs for myself I would not believe in survival for one moment\nunless the phenomena of psychic research proved it. It is strange\nthat Mr. Jacks doubts the evidence of psychic research and\nmaintains a belief in survival on grounds that are not evidence\nat all. It is like saying that he is convinced of Darwinism,\nbut that no one had ever given any proof of it. What is the\nground of his belief ? Is it evidence ? Apparently not. Is it\nsome philosophical assumption or the \" will to believe \" ? No\nphilosophic assumption is worth any more than the evidence\non which it rests and he has already discredited the \" will to\nbelieve.\" Psychic research endeavours to give facts for its proof.\nHas Mr. Jacks any facts others do not know ? Or has he only\na pious opinion based upon the assumption of the rationality\nof nature ? That would be exposed to a double attack. We might\nmaintain that there is no proof of this rationality until survival\nwas proved. Or we might maintain that the \" rationality \" of\nnature without this proof was an abstraction that did not or\nmight not contain the very thing to be proved. This is the\ncase with a great deal of reasoning from generalizations. It\nwas this that made Professor James a pragmatist.\nJames H. Hyslop.\nOn the Evidence for Survival.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014Neither of your correspondents in the last issue\n(July) seem to me to meet the point raised by Miss Sinclair.\nShe suggests that the common interest and desire of the investi-\ngators that a test case may be provided may telepathically\nstimulate the subconscious self of the medium with the result\nthat its dramatizing and inventive powers become so enhanced\nthat it quite surpasses itself. The living investigators give it\nthe general idea of what they want it to do and by the influence\nof their desire unconsciously will it into doing it.\nThis suggestion harmonizes with a suspicion which I have long-\nentertained that the real agent in cross-correspondence is a joint\nmind subliminally common to the investigators, and shaped by\ntheir waking interests. The subliminal group-mind then finds\nexpression and outlet through mediums in telepathic contact\nwith the group. There is no proof that subliminal mind is as\nindividualized as our supraliminal selves. On the contrarv, the\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct. -Nov., 1917\nphenomena of crowd-psychology, espit de corps, '\natmospheres,'\nand the like suggest the reverse. The most striking instance of\na group-mind acting piirposively through individuals severally\ndevoid of so much thought and purpose is perhaps a hive of\nbees. Many of the published cross-correspondences suggest the\nidea of a subliminal S.P.E. group-mind which has been gradually\ndrilled into the art of playing the game of literary jigsaw, invented,\npossibly, by Dr. Verrall in 1906. If so, and if it is still laden\nwith Verrallian learning, neither its ingenuity nor the recondite\ncharacter of its allusions will be able to prove survival.\nThere are indeed three possibilities which seem to me to make\nthe proof of survival, even by such exceptionally good pieces of\nevidence as the Ear of Dionysius, necessarily inconclusive. One\nis the group-mind hypothesis just referred to. The second is\nindirect telepathy, as in the case of Adele Marginot's vision of\nthe man who jumped at the word \" Jesuits.\" Possibly the\nRaymond photograph was another instance of this, the agent\nbeing Mrs. Cheves via Lady, or Sir Oliver, Lodge. The third\nis the possible fact of telaesthesia. It may be that an omniscient\nconsciousness is the presupposition of all knowledge and aU per-\nception. The ordinary avenues of knowledge may be just instru-\nments for letting certain elements of divine omniscience through,\nwhile telaesthesia and precognition are cases of abnormal trans-\nmission. It may be that mediumship may provide another avenue\nto fragments of omniscience.\nIf there is any force in these arguments the conclusion would\nbe that survival can never be proved by alleged communications\nfrom the departed. It could only be proved by information\nrespecting the other world which could not be psychologically\nexplained. Such information would not, of course, be \" evi-\ndential \" in the sense of \" verifiable as the exclusive possession\nof such and such departed persons.\" But if it were of a kind\nthat could not, from the standpoint of psychology, have been\ninvented without access to information nowhere contained in this\nworld, it would point to the reality of some extra-mundane\nexperience. There are limits to the powers of imagination, and\nif cases occur in which those limits are transcended we should\nhave to assume the reality of supermundane experiences.\nR. Gordon Milburn.\n\fOct. -Nov., 1917. Review. 103\nEEVIEW.\nDream Psychology. By Maurice Nicoll, M.B., Capt. (Temp.) R.A.M.C.\n(Oxford Medical Publications.) 6s. net.\nAny writer who maintains that dreams are intelligible products\nof mental activity and that their purpose and meaning can be\nmade plain is sure to have many sceptics amongst his readers.\nThe criticism of such a reader will be specially concentrated\non those parts of the book which deal with the interpretation\nof dreams. For it is on his view of the legitimacy of the method\nof interpretation and of its adequacy that he will judge the\ndream doctrines as a whole. It may perhaps be held as a reproach\nto all writers on dream interpretation that they so seldom succeed\nin carrying conviction to the roinds of their readers. But they\noften confess that they do not expect to convince any one, for\nconviction, they say, comes only by personal experience.\nIn his chapter on Interpretation Dr. Nicoll says :\n\" In the\nold views about dreams, it was recognized that their values\nwere symbolical and that they required some kind of interpretation.\nThe interpretations that were given were teleological ; that is,\nthey were regarded as products with a purposive and prospective\naim. They were prophetic. But in seeking to put a definite\nvalue on their symbolism the help of the dreamer was not invoked,\nso that interpretation became a matter of ingenuity. When\nDaniel interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dream, he did not question\nthe king about any of its symbols, but evolved the interpretation\nwholly out of his own mind.\"\nWhat Dr. Nicoll here says of the old views about dreams\nmay be applied without much injustice to the views put forward\nby him in this book. Here also the interpretations given are\nteleological ; that is, they are regarded as products with a pur-\nposive and prospective aim. But no reason is given why they\nshould be so regarded, except the assertion that it is possible\nto take up such a view. Nor is Dr. NicoU's exposition quite\nfree from the reproach which he makes against the old interpreters\nthat in seeking to put a definite value on the symbolism of\ndreams the \" associations \" of the dreamer were not invoked.\nFor this is precisely the sort of objection that is apt to arise\nin the reader's mind regarding the interpretations of many of\nthe dreams recorded in this book. No doubt want of space\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oot.-Nov., 1917.\nis in many cases a good reason for omitting the detailed associa-\ntions of the dreamer which alone would justify the interpretation\ngiven ; but the sceptical reader who is looking for some justifica-\ntion of the doctrines of dream psychology will be suspicious\nof the many occasions on which the \" associations \" used in the\ninterpretation of the dream appear to be those of the interpreter\nrather than those of the dreamer. It is perhaps significant that\nthe fullest interpretation given of any one dream is in the case\nof a boy who \" gave no associations.\" \" We are at liberty\nthen,\" Dr. Nicoll says, \" to take the dream into our own hands,\nand see how it can be applied to the patient's situation.\" But\nthat is just what Daniel did.\nAlthough the all-important matter of interpretation is inade-\nquately dealt with, there is in Dr. Nicoll's book much that is\ninteresting and instructive. But its scope is limited. He says,\nin his preface, that he will \" feel justified in producing this book\nif it enables its readers to regard the dream, in some degree,\nfrom Dr. Jung's standpoint.\"\nHe therefore confines himself almost exclusively to an exposition\nof some of the views put forward in recent years by Jung, and\nmany of the real problems of dream psychology are not touched\nupon at all. Such a result can hardly be avoided by anyone\nwho at the present day undertakes to discuss the psychology\nof dreams while practically ignoring Freud's work. If the student\nis already acquainted with the pioneer work of Freud not much\nharm will be done, but if he takes up this book as an intro-\nduction to the subject of dream psychology, he is apt to be\nmisled as to the relative importance of the work of Freud which\nis fundamental, and of those more recent developments of Jung's\nwork which are rather of the nature of a heretical departure\nfrom a former faith.\nThe value of Dr. Nicoll's book mainly lies in that it affords\na convenient summary of Jung's views. Its chief defect, for\nthe student, is that it fails to indicate the relation between\nJung's later views and those more firmly established principles\non which all dream analysis is based. T. W.

Balfour in the\nchair.\nSir William Barrett read a paper entitled \" Two Interesting\nCases of Supernormal Action and their Psychological Sig-\nnificance.\"\n'\"\nAt the conclusion of his paper, Sir William Barrett gave\na short account, corroborated by Mr. Hesketh, the engineer-\nmanager of the Electricity Supply Works at Folkestone, of an\ninteresting poltergeist case, which has recently occurred in that\ntown. It is hoped that a detailed report of tliis case will\nappear shortly in the Journal.\nTHE INFLUENCE OF HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION ON\nINFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS.\nIn The Lancet for November 3, 1917, there is an interesting article\nby J. Arthur Hadfield, M.A., M.B., Temporary Surgeon R.N.,\nunder the above title. As Surgeon Hadfield remarks :\nthere has from time to time been considerable controversy as to\nwhether it is possible to produce blisters on the skin by hypnotic\nsuggestion alone, and the present case, which has been most\ncarefully observed, afiords important evidence on this disputed\npoint.\nThe subject of these experiments, \" Leading Seaman H. P.,\"\nwas a patient at the Royal Naval Hospital, Chatham, who\nwas being treated for \" shell-shock \" symptoms and had been\nfound very susceptible to hypnotic suggestion. On one occasion\nSurgeon Hadfield \" was exhibiting to another surgeon one or\ntwo sensory phenomena produced under hypnosis, including\nthe suggestion to the patient \" that he was being touched\nwith a red-hot iron. The following effect was observed :\nWhen I touched him with my finger he withdrew his arm\nin such evident pain that I proceeded to suggest that a blister\nwould form. I then wakened him and thought little more about\nthe matter. But half an hour later tbe patient returned and\nasked whether I had done anything to his arm when he was\nhypnotised, as it was painful and burning, and he pointed to\na blister which was indeed forming and ultimately became fuU\n\fJan., 1918. The Influence of Hypnotic Suggestion. 109\nof flxiid and surrounded with hyperaemia. This experiment,\nhowever, I did not regard as conclusive, because the patient had\nscratched the part, and it might be argued that this alone had\nproduced the blister. In any case probably the scratching\naccelerated the formation of the blister. It is worth noting, how-\never, that the patient knew nothing of my intention nor remem-\nbered anything of my suggestion during hypnosis. I therefore\nexplained to him what I had done and asked his co-operation,\ninasmuch as it involved suffering of pain : this he readily gave.\nA second and a third experiment were then made under\nincreasingly strict conditions. Concerning the third experiment\nSurgeon Hadfield writes as follows\n:\nThis time the lateral aspect of the upper arm was chosen\ninstead of the anterior aspect of the forearm. Suggestions were\nmade in the same manner as before, but the following stricter\nprecautions were taken. I was personally never left alone with\nthe patient ; the patient was never left alone ; and I personally\nnever touched the arm of the patient, this being done by another\nsurgeon present, whilst I made the verbal suggestions. Throughout\nthe day the patient was watched, and at night-time he was\nnot only watched by the night-nurse, next to whose table his\nbed was placed, but his arm was securely bound up and sealed\nas before [in the second experiment]. The next morning the\nbandage was removed in the presence of three surgeons (including\nthe Deputy Surgeon-General). The seal and bandage were found\nto be intact, and beneath there was on the spot suggested the\nbeginning of a blister as before, which gradually developed during\nthe day to form a large bleb with an area of inflammation\naround.\nOther varieties of experiment were also tried, as follows :\n{a) The experimenter touched a spot on the patient's arm\nand made the suggestion that he had touched it with a\nred-hot iron, that a blister would form, but no pain ivould\nhe felt. In this case no blister formed. (6) On two occasions\nthe patient was actually burnt with the end of a steel pencil-\n<iase heated in a Bunsen flame. On the first occasion the\nsuggestion was made that there should be no pain.\nThere was no pain either when the skin was touched or after-\n-wards. But the remarkable thing was that in these burns there\n-\na2\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec. 1917-\nwas no Jiyperaemia around. Round each of the two spots which\nthemselves presented the ordinary appearance of blisters, there\nwas a thin red line and nothing more. These blisters healed\nvery rapidly and never gave any sign of inflammation or pain.\nOn the second occasion the experimenter\nmade an actual burn and suggested pain\u2014the condition, of course\nwhich would occiir in the normal waking state, except that in.'\nthis case the patient, being hypnotised, forgot all about it when\nhe was \" wakened.\" This continued to pain afterwards, and in\nthis case there was very considerable hyperaemia, and the burn\ntook longer to heal.\nIn his conclusions Surgeon Hadfield draws attention to the\nfollowing points :\n(a) The effect of pain in retarding healing processes.\n(6) The regulation of the blood-supply.\n\u2022 It is a well-known fact that hyperaemia may be produced by\nsuggestion. The experiments made in producing blisters show\nto what lengths this regulation of the blood-supply can go in a\nsusceptible patient.\nFinally Surgeon Hadfield states that although he does not\nexpect that \" these experiments will convince those who are\nunacquainted with hypnotic work,\"\nthey were conducted under the strictest scientific conditions^\nand were such as to satisfy the surgeons, of whom there were\neight or nine, who had a share in them. Moreover in order to\nshow my good faith in the matter, I am quite jjrepared to repeat\nthe experiments under any conditions that may be considered\nnecessary, when the exigences of war permit of my doing so,\nprovided I can obtain the consent of the patient, to whose endur-\nance during several hours of pain I am indebted for the oppor-\ntunity of conducting the experiments.\nA photograph of the patient's arm is given, showing the\nvarious blisters formed during the experiments, and also a\nsafety-pin \" introduced through the flesh to indicate the reality\nof the hypnosis and the analgesia produced by suggestion.\"\nThe above case presents interesting analogies with earlier\ncases which are on record. For example, in Human Personalittf\n\fJan., 1918. The Infltience of Hypnotic Suggestion. Ill\nand its Survival of Bodily Death, Vol. I., p. 470, Myers quotes\na case given by Delboeuf, which well demonstrates the influence\nof pain upon the healing processes. The subject, J., was a\nstrong, healthy peasant-girl.\nAfter explaining what he proposed to do and obtaining her\nconsent in the waking state, Delboeuf hypnotised her, extended\nher arms on a table, and suggested that the right arm should\nbe insensible to pain. Each arm was then burnt with a red-hot\nbar of iron, 8 mm. in diameter, the extent and duration of its\napplication being the same in both, but pain being felt in the\nleft arm alone. The burns were bandaged and J. was sent to\nbed. During the night the pain in the left arm continued, and\nnext morning there was a wound on it 3 cm. in diameter, with\nan outer circle of inflamed blisters. On the right there was\nonly a defined eschar, the exact size of the iron and without\ninflammation or redness. The day following the left arm was\nstill more painful and inflamed ;\nanalgesia was then successfully\nsuggested, when the wound soon dried and the inflammation\ndisappeared. Thus in the originally painless wound there was\nat first less inflammation and a more rapid healing than in the\npainful one.\nThe evidence afforded by such cases as Surgeon Hadfield's on\nthe effect of suggestion upon the blood-supply throws an\ninteresting light on the mediaeval traditions of stigmatisation,\nas, for example, in the story of St. Francis of Assisi. The\nbest-recorded modern case of stigmatisation is that of Louise\nLateau, which is related in Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 492.\nIn this instance the stigmata occurred spontaneously, not as\nthe result of suggestion from another person. An interesting\nexperimental case is recorded in Human Personality, Vol. I.,\np. 493, and also in Jour. S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 100, and Proc,\nS.P.R., Vol. VII., p. 339. The experimenter in this case\nwas Dr. Biggs, of Lima, and a red cruciform mark was pro-\nduced on the subject's chest. In some of these earlier cases,\nhowever, the conditions were not so strict as absolutely to\npreclude some other possible explanation of the phenomena\nobserved. Surgeon Hadfield's excellently observed case is\ntherefore an important contribution to the subject.\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec. 1917-\nFURTHEK ON THE \" ST. PAUL \" CROSS-CORRESPONDENCE.*\nBy Walter F. Prince, Ph.D.\nHad my whole paper consisted of the following paragraph, \" To\nfind a cross-correspondence between '\nSt. Paul ' in Mrs. Piper's\nscript and the citation '\nII Peter i. 15 '\nin Mrs. Holland's, it is\nonly necessary to substitute at random for the latter some other\npassage mentioning Paul, as I Corinthians xvi. 21, '\nThe salutation\nof Paul with mine own hand,' \" then Mr. Piddington's Note\nwould have proved an apt and ample reply. For such an absurd\nsuggestion would certainly have been in order \" to obtain a\nmore effective cross-correspondence,\" which he intimates was\nmy sole \" justification \" for the emendation which I actually did\npropose.\nHe is utterly silent on my whole argument. He ignores every\none of its ten points : (1) That the suggested emendation con-\ntemplates no change of writer, epistle or verse, but only of\nthe chapter, from first to third, (2) That the odds are 11 to 1\nagainst coinciding by chance with the one verse in Peter's epistles\nwhich names Paul, (3) That the error of \"first\" for \"third\"\nis precisely that most likely to occur in an auditory process\nof transmission, (4) That the emendation further curiously brings\nus upon the one non-Pauline passage of the New Testament\nwhich names Paul, (5) That it further brings us to the one\nverse in all the New Testament which most pointedly charac-\nterizes Paul, (6) That Miss Veriall's two passages are full of\nhints that a mistake or defect exists in this very matter of\n\" St. Paul \" known to Lodge, and of the nature of the defect\nor mistake, (7) That the second item of Mrs. Holland's script,\n\" this witness is true,\" instead of being \" remimscent of several\npassages in the writings of St. John,\" is a literal quotation from\nSt. Paul, as well as is the fifth item, (8) That the third item,\ninstead of being non-significant, is reminiscent of a passage from\nPaul, (9) That Miss Verrall's first Latin sentence is capable of\na simpler and smoother translation, which causes it to be intelli-\ngible and relevant, (10) That the emendation of the Petrine\npassage like magic brings order into the threefold series of scripts,\nand causes the whole to be instinct with meaning.\nIt would be more to the point to meet these propositions\n* For previous article see Jowr. jS.P.i?., July, 1917.\n\fJan., 1918. \"*S'^. Paul\" Gross-Correspondence. 113\nsquarely, than to indulge in innuendoes in regard to altering\nfacts \" to suit our theories,\" justifying one's self by the wish\nto obtain \" a more effective cross-correspondence,\" and the like.\nI did not care twopence how the \" St. Paul \" inquiry turned\nout, and my \" theory \" was forced upon me by the unexpected\ndiscovery of the facts and their mutually strengthening relations.\nUnlike my friend, I neither \" prefer to abide by what the automatist\nwrote \" nor to depart therefrom, for my ground is chosen for me by\nlogical necessity. Darwin was liable to the imputation that he wanted\nto prove natural selection, but the important question is, did he prove\nit ? Nor are my proofs affected by concocting without proof a theory\nof my personal biases.\nNeither can my evidence be excluded by arbitrarily-invented rules,\nrather pontifically laid down, as to emendable and non-emendable\nmatter. This sort of thing is undoubtedly \" cricket,\" since cricket\nis a pastime governed by artificial rules, but it is not science,\nnor even common-sense. Any emendation is imperative if ade-\nquately supported by evidence from whatever quarter. No emenda-\ntion is permissible, whatever its situation, if the evidence is\nagainst it. And that is all that there is to the matter.\nThe distinction drawn between the text of classical authors\nand automatic scripts, as to the permissibility of emendations,\nis fallacious. The script, like the Iliad, is a text to be amended,\nfor precisely analogous reasons, whenever sufficient evidence to support\nthe emendation is presented. The earliest manuscript which we have\nof the Iliad is not its first deliverance, and neither is the script of the\nautomatist. The utterance of the \" communicator \" is the original.\nOften this utterance has to be handed on by a \" control \" or inter-\nmediary.i \" Comxnunicators \" claim that they cannot get their\nword or phrase through, and \" controls \" explain that they did not\nhear it correctly. Not infrequently, when it gets through, it becomes\ndistorted in the process, sometimes gradually resolving, by succes-\nsive trials, into the expression intended ; sometimes remaining\nin an erroneous form, without the fact being necessarily perceived\nby the communicator or any \" dissatisfaction \" being expressed.\n1 1 do not care for the purposes of the argument whether \" communicator\n\"\nand \" control \" aie spirits, or subliminal personalities exhibiting \" dis-\ncontinuity of consciousness.\" Mr. Piddington is convinced that they are\none or the other. See 323a, 229d-230a. (The references here and hereafter,\nare to the British Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXII., and the adjoined letter\na, b, e or d, ia to show approximately the position on the page.)\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec. 1917\nIt is precisely as logical and scientific to emend a script, when\ngood reasons demand it, as it is to emend a classical text ; and\nit is a much more hopeful task, in some instances, since the\nclassical text has been passed on from one to another so many\nmore times than the wording of the script.\nMr. Piddington lays down, expressly or by implication, his\nthree rules relative to the emendation of scripts.\n(1)\n\" Emendation, except as regards mere slips of the pen,\nought to be eschewed.\"\n(2) A word or phrase may be emended \" when the immediate\ncontext of it can be shown to support the emendation,\" but\nnot \" on the strength of something to be found in the script\nof \" another.\n(3) If a particular word or phrase is set down, and no dissatis-\nfaction with it is expressed in the context, it ought (if neither\nof the above rules apply) to stand.\nRule 1, since it allows for neither contextual support nor\ncontextual dissatisfaction, is negatived by Rules 2 and 3. Neither\nare any of them \" canons,\" or fundamental and invariable maxims.\nBut even the rules of a game should be adhered to by their\ninventor, so let us see how our friend plays his \" cricket.\"\nThe most of his emendations are contrary of rule 1, since\nthey do not concern \" mere slips of the pen \" but auditory errors,\nand many are in defiance of all three. It is an embarrassment\nto select from such a wealth of instances.\nOn February 11, 1907, \" Myers \" asked through Mrs. Piper if the\nword \" Evangelical \" had come in Mrs. Verrall's script ; on\nFebruary 13, Mr. Piddington asked Myers when he gave the\nword to Mrs. Verrall, and was again assured that this word and\nnone other was meant. On the 27th \" Evangelical \" was again\nwritten. It did not connect with anything, but what of that\n\u2014since scripts are \" for the most part . . . incoherent \" ? But\nMr. Piddington was unaccountably disturbed, and pointedly asked\nMyers if the word was right, and was assured that it was, and\nthat it was given for a purpose. Nothing in the \" immediate\ncontext \" suggested that anything else was meant, it was not\na \" slip of the pen,\" and emphatically no \" dissatisfaction \" was\nhinted at. And though on March 4,\n\" Evelyn Hope \" was written,\nthe shadowy resemblance between this and \" Evangelical \" did\nnot by itself warrant tra,nsmuting one into the other, nor was\n\fJan., 1918. \"St. Paul\" Cross-Correspondence. \" 115\n-there anything in the context to suggest it. Why then did he do\nit ? For no reason except that Myers had said he gave the\nformer word to Mrs. Verrall, and in Mrs. VerralFs script had\nappeared something which would link on to \" Evelyn Hope,\"\nhut nothing related to \" Evangelical.\" Then Mr. Piddington\nasked Myers if he did not after all mean \" Evelyn Hope,\" and\nall was well. Yet he innocently remarks that \" the modification\n\"\nwas \" spontaneous and not traceable to any influence from me \" !\nOn the contrary, so far as proof goes, it was solely manufactured\nby him. The words \" Evelyn Hope \" did appear spontaneously,\nbut the identification of them with \" Evangelical \" is quite a\ndifferent matter. The emendation is probably valid, but it\nbreaks all the rules. (320c, 322c, 334b, 340d, Qlc.)\nThrice \" Del Sarto \" was given as a cross-correspondence\nword intended to come out in Mrs. Verrall's script ;\n\" there\nis nothing in the context to show that any dissatisfaction was\nfelt with the reference as given,\" nor the smallest indication\nin the \" immediate context \" that it is to be emended to form\nthe \" good test \" that Kector declared it to be. In the \" script\nof '\nB's,' \" meaning Mrs. Verrall's, \" Del Sarto \" did not appear,\nbut it did contain anagrams on the word \" star.\" From this\nforbidden tree, \" the script of B's,\" the hint is plucked, ''\nDel\nSarto \" is remodelled as \" lode-star,\" and now relations are found\nin both scripts. This is not to \" improve a cross-correspondence !\n\"\nbut to create one ! ! (355-6, etc.). Why stop here 1 Other\nanagrams based on \" Del Sarto \" are feasible, of which \" east\nlord \" is one. This connects admirably with cross-correspondence\nXIX. (241 ff.). If anyone has read the painful (of course the time-\nhonom'ed sense of painstaking is implied) discussion on pages 253-\n261 he will instantly perceive that the god Hercules who figures\nso prominently there, and whose club signified the East, is the\n\" east lord.\" Besides, have we not here the reason why Mrs.\nVerrall's script departed from the strict Tennysonian line and\nput it \" Rosy is the east \" ? It was in order to clasp hands\nwith the anagram, for surely the east is made rosy by the rising\n^'\neast lord,\" the sim (271) !\n\u2022\n.\n;\nIn Mrs. Piper's script occurred \" Maud Garten-Carter.\" It would\nhardly spontaneously occur to one to identify Maud Carter\n\"\nwith \" Marion Carver.\" The context does not suggest any altera-\ntion, no \" dissatisfaction \" is visible. But \" B's \" script has a\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec. 1917-\n\" Marion Carver,\" so a little collateral evidence is scratchedi\ntogether, and a definite addition is made to the cross-corre-\nspondences (207-8).\nMr. Piddington conjectures that \" Sasia Saisia Francis,\" in\n\" a script of A's \" should be changed to Francis d'Assisi,\" not\non any of the grounds v?hich he has formally approved, but\nbecause, on the basi? of another document, Myers' \" Human Per-\nsonality,\" he thinks that this saint may be classed with others\nwho are mentioned in the script. He is not very sure, because\nthe evidence is slight, but by his own rule he oughb not tO'\naccept the evidence at all (135d).\nThe man who emends \" Dina \" in \" Blna dos anados,\" etc.,\nto mean Diana, by recourse to \" ana \" in \" anados\" and other\nsubtle guesses, ought not to be offended at an emendation which\ngives a plain, rational account of itself. 1 think that the con-\njecture that \" Diana \" was the word aimed at is probably correct\nbut cannot conceal that it would not have been ventured but\nfor the occurrence of the same word in \" B's \" script (Mrs. Verrall)\nand in \" A's \" (Mrs. Piper) of quite a different date. There\nis not space for more examples.\nI object to the intimation implied in the remark about the\n\" incoherence,\" etc., of scripts, that if there is found a phrase\nor name unintelligible in relation to its context, it is not legitimate-\nto follow any clues which may lead to intelligibility. What is\nMr. Piddington doing in half of his lengthy discussions ? Why-\nis he racing through ancient and modern literature, but for this ?\nHis whole undertaking is based upon the assumption that ration-\nality underlies the scripts, that something intelligible was intended,\nhowever blundering the efforts to attain to it. He confesses\nthat he is firmly convinced of the \" intelligence and design\n\"\nmanifested in the scripts (103a), or \" the intelligent direction\nand ingenuity \" which they display (35b). Many an incoherence\ndoes he himself clear up by more or less convincing emendations.\nSince when, then, has it been against the rules to inquire what\nthe citation \" II Peter i. 15 \" is doing in script with which\nit has absolutely no meaning ? The general evidence of \" intelli-\ngence and design \" requires the assumption that in this instance\nthe communicator, whether spirit or subliminal personality, had\na reason for inserting it or what he thought it to be.\nIf no mistakes ever occurred in scripts, the riddle would be\n\fJan., 1918. \"*S'^. Paul\" Cross-Correspondence. iir\ninsoluble, but mistakes are frequent, and they generally appear-\nto be, and are by Mr. Piddington believed to be, auditory mis-\ntakes.i The citation may then be an error, and an error due\nto defective audition. \" Tampering with the text \" is indeed\nreprehensible, but by the standard of the dictionary to prove\nan error and to rectify it is not to tamper. Again an innuendo\nis substituted for argument.\nBut we must not \" emend a word or phrase in a script of\nA's on the strength of something to be found in a script of\nB's,\" forsooth ! As the crew of \" Pinafore \" interrogated, \" What t\nnever ?\n\" A must not \" tamper \" with a chest belonging to B,.\nbut if he receives a letter from B asking him to open it and\ntake out a certain article, he not only has a warrant to go\nto the chest but warrant for a certain amount of expectation\nthat he will find the article in it. It is as silly to object to\ntracing an error in the script of A's from a clue found in the\nscript of B's as to object to Leverrier's turning his telescope\nto the quarter of the sky where the yet unknown Neptune lay,,\non the strength of what the mathematicians told him regarding\nthe significance of the attraction exercised from that quarter\nupon other planets.

One can hardly blame Mrs. Sidgwick for suggesting at\nthis point, \" Odyssey ? \" And after all Mr. Piddington assures us, relying on\ngrounds which lie quite outside the context, that \"the communicating\nspirit ... was obviously [italics mine] trying to talk about the Odes of\nHorace\" (404a).\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, dec. 1917-\nanother script, names what that something is, and strongly hints\nin just what passage to seek it, it would be foolish, it would\nbe unfair, not to look for that thing precisely there.\nAnd does it not ? Miss Verrall's two brief passages placed\ntogether by Mr. Piddington declare that something is \" not right,\"\nnot understood.\" What something ?\n\u2014\" the name.\" What\nname I\n\u2014\" Paul,\" twice written (once with emphasis) and a third\ntime described. What Paul ?\n\u2014\" a saint,\" therefore St. Paul.\nWhy St. Paul ?\n\u2014\" ask Lodge !\n\" Somebody is talking who\nappears to know about the promise made to Sir Oliver to send\nthe name \" St. Paul.\" And to whom was the name to be sent ?\nTo Mrs. Holland in India, and in all fairness we must seek it\nagain in Mrs. Holland's script. But in which passage ? \" The\nname is not right robbing Peter to pay\u2014Paul.\" Where in Mrs.\nHolland's script does the name \" Peter \" appear ? \u2014in the citation\n\" II Peter i. 15.\" The name \" Paul \" should then be there-\nSurely, here are clues sufficient to send the most amateur detective\nto this spot.\nNote that Miss Verrall's script does not, as in some other\ncases, merely ask if the name has come out elsewhere. It\npositively and repeatedly asserts a defect and urges that it be\nremedied. So, when the easy discovery is made that the one\npassage in Peter's writings which names Paul and which likewise\nfits the other intimations, differs from the citation as given by\na single figure, we need not undergo nausea at the thought that\nthis implies that the figure is to be corrected. Had there not been\na mistake Miss Verrall's script would have been a strangely confident\nand persistent blunder, and the puzzle would be far greater than it is.\nMr. Piddington would like to have the \" canons of probability\n\"\nformally set forth. I suppose that if one remarked that all the\ndictates of reason are in favour of the Copernican theory, he\nwould not agree until the dictates were laid down as set pro-\npositions, duly numbered. And yet I am convinced that such\nlittle hope as there may be of impressing him by these canons\nlies in their being embodied in the concrete facts of the case.\nI. When the script of \" B's \" raises the presumption of an\nerror in a particular passage of \" A's \" script, which stands in\nthe way of a particularly described discovery, and a slight correc-\ntion of that passage leads to the discovery exactly as predicted,\nit becomes probable that the correction is valid.\n\fJan., 1918. \"St. Paul\" Gross-Correspondence. 119\nII. Since, in the admitted auditoxy factor of transmission,\n\" third \" was more likely to be mistaken for \" first \" than any\nother ordinal, the probability of the correction is augmented.^\nIII. When a predicted goal is reached by a correction against\nthe success of which the odds are 11 to 1, the correction is\nprobably valid and not due to chance.\nIV. When the correction adopted on the grounds already stated,\nand involving \" robbing Peter,\" proves to coincide with the\n\u2022only passage in a logical division of the New Testament con-\ntaining more than 4500 words, and also with the passage best\n\u2022calculated in the whole New Testament to \" pay Paul \" a\ntribute, the probability that this was the passage originally in-\ntended, and not one arrived upon by an involution of chances,\nis increased.\nV. An emendation which meets all the conditions, and har-\nmonizes all the elements, of a problem, is in the highest degree\nprobable. We have to-day no other reason for believing that\nthe earth in its motion describes an ellipse, with the sun at one\nof its foci ; and logicians have not complained of Kepler's method\nnor of his proofs. With II Peter iii. 15 meant, chaos in the\nthree series of scripts is gone, and every passage is instinct with\nmeaning. Mrs. Piper's script promises that the name \" St. Paul\n\"\nshall come out in Mrs. Holland's. The promise was fulfilled\n\u20acxcept for a small and easy error which hardly disguises itself.\nBesides, Mrs. Holland also writes two quotations from Paul, and\n& passage reminiscent of him only. Her remaining sentence,\nlike all the others, has a significance in relation to the test, but\nalso (and this is more in Mr. Piddington's vein than mine) in\nits word \"patience\" echoes exactly the meaning of the word\n*'\nlong-suffering \" found in II Peter iii. 15, which meaning is\nantithetical to the verbal root referred to in Miss Verrall's first\nLatin sentence, signifying \" to pause, to come to an end.\" Miss\nVerrall's script points in one direction to the giving of the \" St.\nPaul \" test with which Lodge was associated, and in another\nto a mistake or defect in relation to the name and to the spot\nwhere it ought to be. Everywhere throughout this triple gToup\nof scripts which Mr. Piddington holds up for our inspection,\n\" Paul,\" \" Paul,\" \" Paul,\" peers, signals and shouts.\n^ The fact can be demonstrated on the telephone, unless conscious pains\nare taken, especially to sound the \" s.\"\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec. 1917-\nVI. When the different probabilities combine to point in one\nand the selfsame direction, there results practical certainty for\nreasonable men.\nThe \" St. Paul \" correspondence is surpassed in value by very\nfew in the series, if by any. It possesses a number of advan-\ntages : (a) The scripts involved are brief, compact, and unem-\nbarrassed by digressions. (6) The trains of connection are not\ntortuous and wearisome, drawn through every gradation of light\nand cloudiness, but are short, direct, and in full sunshine.^\n(c) Reasonings involved and ambiguous, marked by \" subtleties\nand entanglements 1\n\" are not required, but only such as are simple,,\nconcrete and cogent. {d) There is no uncertain, hesitant or\ninquiring tone in any part of the scripts. The promise to send\nthe name \" St. Paul \" is explicit, in the script of Mrs. Piper\n;\nthe confidence evinced in \" This witness is true,\" etc., of the\nscript of Mrs. Holland, is assured ; and the conviction shown\nin the script of Miss Verrall, both that there was a defect in\nthe test relating to the name, and also that there was in posses-\nsion data sufficient to locate the defect, is unmistakeable.\n\" I never did attach much importance to the '\nSt. Paul ' cross-\ncorrespondence,\" remarks my friend, who, placing a just estimate\nupon the shape in which he left it, could say, \" A poor thing\n1 \" I would advise the reader who has no taste for these subtleties and\nentanglements,\" etc., says Mr. Piddington, referring to his discussion (295b).\nNote the frequent subtleties in the discussions like \" has the air of\n(218d), \"strongly suggestive of\" (303a), \"a trace of . . . may just possibly\nbe found \" (225b), \" we may fairly assume \" (225a), etc.\nAnd note the reasoning displayed in a few instances. The script \" Blanche\nde Lys or some such name,\" we are told (J. G. P. in 83d), is \" a reminis-\ncence of a phrase, '\nBlanche comme un lys,' which occurs in a poem of\nVillon's.\" Why there should be a reminiscence of Villon does not, so far as\nI have been able to discover, appear. It is quite possible that researches\ncontinued still farther into French literature, might find \"Blanche de Lys\"\nas a name, which is what the script pronounced it.\nIt would never occur to me to make the single appearance of the words\n\" Laus Deo \" in Mrs. Piper's waking stage, and the single appearance of the\nsam> words in the script of Mrs. Verrall five months before a cross-corre-\nspondence, with no other evidence whatever (304-7). It would not seem\npossible for several persons to be writing, even at random, and it not\noccasionally happens that two hit upon the same expression. But it is quite\nanother thing when an intended cross-correspondence word is announced\nbeforehand. Then one is looking for a definite thing, and the possibilities\nof chance coincidences are immeasurably diminished.\n\fJan., 1918.

If facts may be \" altered,\" they may also be\nignored, \" to suit a theory.\"\nFinally, reverting to the implication that any \" dissatisfaction\n\"\nwith the defective citation II Peter i. 15 \" should have been\n\u2022expressed in its immediate context and not in the script of another\nautomatist, I beg leave to reply in the words of a writer whom\nwe all highly esteem\u2014Mr. J.

Had the correc-\ntion appeared in Mrs. Holland's own script, someone would cer-\ntainly have conjectured in all gravity that her subliminal and\nthe subliminal of Mrs. Piper met somewhere in mid-air and\ncollaborated !\nA NEW EDITION IN ONE VOLUME OF\n\"PHANTASMS OF THE LIVING.\"\nPhantasms of the Living, by Edmund Gurney, F. W. H. Myers,\nand F. Podmore, published in 1886, which embodies much of the\nearly work of our Society, and in particular much valuable discussion\nby its earliest honorary secretary, Edmund Gurney, has long been\nout of print. Since, however, its value has been but little affected\nby subsequent investigation, and it still forms the basis on which\nmuch of the present day work on telepathy, and especially on\nveridical apparitions and phantasms generally, rests, it is thought,\nboth by the Council of the Society, and by the publishers^\u2014Messrs.\nKegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co. \u2014that a new edition is likely to\nbe appreciated by the public. Mrs. Sidgwick, who in some degree\nco-operated in the compiling of the original work, has been asked\nto undertake the preparation of this new edition, and it is hoped\nthat it will appear in the course of January.\nThe book, it will be remembered, is a study of the evidence for\ntelepathy furnished both by experiments and by spontaneous occur-\nrences\u2014the latter ranging from apparently transferred waking\nimpressions and dreams to apparitions at the time of the death, or\nother crises in the life of the person seen. Incidentally there is a\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec. 1917-\ngood deal of discussion on the nature of sensory hallucinations,\nand comparison between those which are purely subjective in\norigin and those which are veridical. Had the authors still\nbeen with us, a new edition would no doubt have been brought\nup to date. New evidence might have been added, new cases\nperhaps substituted for old, and the discussion might perhaps have\nbeen in some points added to or diminished to suit the new\natmosphere which the book itself has belped to create. Changes of\nthis sort the Editor has not felt justified in attempting. The text\nin this new edition will be substantially as the authors left it in,\nthe old, with the exception of a few omissions for the sake of\nbrevity ; and no new cases will be introduced, though in a few\nadditional evidence is incorporated.\nAt the same time editing was required, because it was felt to be\nadvisable to reduce the two large volumes of the original edition\nto one. To effect this a great many of the Cases quoted are to\nbe omitted, a sufiicient number being retained to illustrate Gurney's\npoints. Especially the whole of the Supplement, to which in the\noriginal edition the less well-evidenced cases were relegated, will be\nleft out ; but also the number of cases interspersed through the\ntext itself will be greatly reduced. In some respects this will tend\nto make the book more readable, as the reading of reiterated cases\nof the same type is apt to become wearisome, and plenty of\nspecimens will remain. Further diminution of bulk is to be secured\nby the omission of an important \" Note on Witchcraft \" by Gurney,,\nand a long \" Note on a Suggested Mode of Psychical Interaction\n\"\nby Myers, neither of which belong to the general course of the\nwork. What Myers had to say is, of course, embodied in its final\nform in his own book on \"Human Personality.\"\nIt is probable that many of the newer Members of the Society-\nhave never read Phantasms of the Living, and it is hoped that they\nmay be led, by its issue in a more handy form\u2014and we may add a\nless expensive one\u2014to peruse what must be regarded as a classic of\npsychical research.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nOn the Evidence for Survival.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nThe statement of Professor Hyslop that survival has been proved\nby evidence is one I never read without regret ;\nbecause, as\nit seems to me, its frequent repetition is likely to weaken the\ncredit of Psychical Research. To say of any belief that it is\n\fJan., 1918. Gorres-pondence. 12S\nproved by evidence is a loose mode of expression which has\nits natural sequel in loose thinking, and especially in that form\nof loose thinking which consists of begging the question.\nEvidence proves nothing unless it be correctly interpreted, so\nthat in the last resort, and in every case, the validity of the\nproof depends quite as much on the soundness of the reasoning\nby which the evidence is interpreted as in anything the evidence\nitself contains. Every lawyer and every scientific man knows\nthis perfectly well. Were there no difference between \" evidence\n\"\nand the \" proof from evidence \" there would be no need for\ncounsel's arguments, nor for the judge's summing up, nor for the\ndeliberations of the jury. If Professor Hyslop were to announce\nthe discovery of a new element or force, and decline to interpret\nhis evidence, nobody would listen to him for a moment. The\nproof of gravity is not merely the fall of the apple ; it is\nthe fa]] of the apple interpreted by Newton's Principia.\nIf therefore survival has been proved, the proof, I submit,\nconsists not in the evidence merely as such, but in the rea,soning-\nwhich has convinced us that the evidence means survival and\ncannot possibly mean anything else. This is overlooked by not\na few persons who are continually assuring us that \" the survival\nhas been proved by evidence.\" In Psychical Research the expres-\nsion is particularly unfortunate, because in this branch of enquiry\nthe work of interpreting the evidence is exceptionally difficult and\nexposed to great risks of error. There is no walk of science in\nwhich the dependence of proof on good reasoning about evidence, as\ndistinct from the evidence itself, stands out in a clearer light.\nWhat makes reasoning, as distinct from mere evidence, so\nimportant and so difficult in the \" proofs \" of survival is that\nthe leading witnesses, on whose testimony all subsequent evidence\ndepends, are the very persons whose existence is in question.\nTJiey are the alleged survivors themselves. We are in this difficult\nposition\u2014that before we can interpret the evidence we have to\nbe sure of the existence of the witnesses. None but a survivor\ncan give direct evidence of survival.\nHowever unimpeachable a person I may be my evidence that\nI have encountered a survivor, whether as a visible apparition,\nor in a message delivered through a medium, or in any other\nway, counts for nothing at all, unless I can prove that what\nI have encountered is really a survivor and not hallucination,\nor a trick of sub-consciousness, or any alternative supposition.\nMy testimony depends on his ; and if he turns out to Ise other\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, dec. 1917-\ntlian he seems to be, or claims to be, the evidence is vitiated\nat the fountain-head and the proof of survival, no matter how\nmany instances are encountered, is impossible. It is as though\nthe Court of the Tichborne trial had had to begin their proceed-\nings by proving that the claimant in the witness box was a\nreal man, and not a dream image or an empty phantasm, or\n\"the product of the Court's imagination. The investigators of\nthe claim made in that famous case had at all events the advan-\ntage of being able to take the claimant for granted. But if\nive take our claimant (the alleged survivor) for granted, we are\nbegging the whole question at issue, and this I venture to think\nis what many of us are constantly in danger of doing. For\nexample, nothing that \" Myers \" may be alleged to do from\nanother world is of the least value as evidence for his survival\nuntil we are assured that it is Myers who is doing it. But this\nagain is the question at issue. If we assume that it is Myers\nwho is doing these things, there is of course no more to be said.\nBut we have no right to assume it, for that is precisely what\nhas to be proved. So long as a doubt, or a reasonable possi-\nbility, remains that the alleged doings of Myers are being per-\nformed by some other person or agency\u2014the medium, the\nsub-consciousness of the sitter, telepathy, or even, as Father\nVaughan suggests, the devil, we cannot claim that we have the\nevidence of a survivor. And unless it be the evidence of a\nsurvivor it is not yet evidence of survival. Obviously we are\nin the greatest danger of begging the question at every step\n\u2014\ntreating the claimant as though he were in the witness box while\nhis existence is still unproved.\nNow it is in order that we may avoid this danger that the\nwork of reasoning in Psychical Research is so exceptionally\narduous and risky. It is possible to avoid the danger, but\nonly by the greatest circumspection and an almost superhuman\nexertion of logical thoroughness. Obviously any attempt to prove\ndirectly from the testimony of \" Myers \" that it is Myers who\nis bearing testimony, will leave us reasoning in a circle, and\nthe conclusion will be worthless. But indirectly a proof is ideally\npossible. It will consist in eliminating every other person or\nagency from whom or by which the alleged evidence could con-\nceivably have been given, so that in the long last Myers is left\nstanding as the only possible source of it. Not until we have\nstopped up every hole can we claim to be in a fair way to catch\nthe fox. That is not easy.\n\fJan., 1918. Correspondence. 125\nLet us suppose that a correct reading of \" the sealed packet\n\"\nhad been given through a mediuni to Sir Oliver Lodge or some\nother unimpeachable witness. Great would be the temptation\nto say \" Myers has done this ;\nMyers therefore survives.\" But\nclearly we should have no right to say anything of the kind\nuntil by a process of very careful reasoning we had shown that\nno agency, save that of Myers, could have done this thing. We\nshould have to eliminate fraud (that would be easy), the sub-\nconsciousness of medium and sitter, telepathy and\u2014if you will\n\u2014the devil. iSome of these would be difficult. The devil, if\nyou happened to believe in him, would be very difficult. So\nwould telepathy. Under this last we should have to assure\nourselves that there were no roundabout ways in telepathy,\nsuch, for example, that Myers writing the sealed message during\nhis lifetime, might have communicated it telepathically to the\nsub-consciousness of half a dozen people, who again might have\npassed it on telepathically to others, so that it became, so to\nspeak, common, property in the sub-consciousness of a whcle\ngroup, ready to come forth when the occasion should arise. These\nare the kind of possibilities which we should have to rule out\none by ore till the whole list was exhausted. I am far from\ndenying that they can be ruled out. But until they are\nwe are not in a position to say that Myers, the survivor, has\ngiven evidence of survival. And even when that moment is come\nwe must not go prancing about with the statement that survival\nhas been proved by evidence. We must have the candour to\ndeclare that the proof rests on our interpretation of the evidence\u2014\nand modestly ask the public to scrutinize the reasoning which\nhas led us to that interpretation, to the exclusion of all others.\nI say we must do this modestly, because the method of reason-\ning to which we are perforce compelled is a very precarious one.\nWe cannot claim to have eliminated the alternative possibilities,\nuntil we are quite sure that we know them all. Now, even in\nthe physical sciences, where the area of alternative explanations\nis relatively circumscribed, it is not always easy to be sure that\nevery one of them has been reviewed. But when we come to\nthe human mind and its workings, we are in a region of which\nwe know little\u2014far less than we commonly suppose\u2014and the\narea of possibilities before us is strangely disconcerting. When,\nfor example, telepathy is suggested as the cause of the phenomena,\nwe have to confess that we know far too little about telepathy, about\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec. 1917-\nits nature and especially its range, to enable us to say precisely\nwhat telepathy can and what it cannot account for. It is a risky\nthing to claim that you have examined every possible explanation\nof a given mental phenomenon !\nThis brings me to the last paragraph of Professor Hyslop's\nletter in which he suggests that, since I believe in survival on\ngrounds other than those provided by Psychical Research, I\nmust have some secret evidence up my sleeve. Indeed I have\nnone. But though I have none up my sleeve I have plenty\nwhich is accessible to everybody. The chief is my own present\nexistence as a thinking being and all that is covered by this\nphrase. This seems to me a very suggestive piece of evidence.\nInterpreting the meaning of my present existence as a thinking\nbeing by such light of reason as I possess, I am led to believe\nthat my future existence\u2014my survival of death\u2014is extremely\nprobable. The reasoning which leads me to interpret this evidence\nin favour of my survival is, I admit, open to grave risks of\nerror. But not more so than the reasoning of Professor Hyslop\nfrom his data of Psychical Research. He and I are precisely\nalike in this\u2014that our respective beliefs in survival are based on\nour interpretation of the evidence before us and have just so\nmuch validity, no more and no less, as the soundness of our\nreasoning entitles us to claim. Neither of us has the faintest\nright to say that our belief is \" proved by the evidence.\" This\nkind of loose language may do for the market-place, but not\nfor scientific enquiry. Introduced into science, it is the prolific\nparent of the very muddles upon which Professor Hyslop is so\nsevere when he encounters them in philosophers. There is no\nmuddle so vicious as that of begging the question.\nL. P. Jacks.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014It might carry this discussion further if Mr. Gordon\nMilburn would add to his delightfully lucid exposition of the\nunlimited telepathy theory\u2014a theory which, in spite of its very\nlarge prior assumptions, is scientifically and philosophically coherent\n\u2014some treatment of the question that I tried to express in\nmy former letter. Granted the tendency, and the power, of our\nunconscious selves to invent or discover things, singly and in\nconstructive telepathic collaboration, the problem remains of the\nquality of these collaborations. A poet, drawing upon the reservoir\n\fJan., 1918. Correspondence. 127\nof contemporary unconscious feeling which by this hypothesis\nis \" the spirit of the age,\" writes verse that has in it the fire\nof prophecy. Through a communion of souls, an unconscious\nunity in fellowship, he touches the inspiration of the divine.\nThis is a beautiful thought, and I at least feel it to be a pro-\nfoundly true one. But must we not suppose that the poet's\nachievement depends upon the veridicity of his experience ? He\ncan enter into a profounder fellowship to find a truth ; can he\nenter into a profounder fellowship to elicit a lie from it ?\nI use the word lie, here, for something qualitatively distinct from\nerrors of interpretation. The poet's conscious or semi-conscious\nself, in our hypothesis, can, of course\u2014must, of course\u2014fail\nof perfect interpretation ; he may even misinterpret grotesquely.\nBut he is misinterpreting a truth. What, then, of the uncon-\nsciously collaborating minds of psychical researchers ? Can they\n\u2014is it philosophically thinkable that they should\u2014enter into\npsychic reciprocity to construct a lie ? Fellowship, reciprocity, is\nan absolute value ; is it attainable on these terms ?\nThe probability of misinterpretation remains ; I allowed for\nthat in my letter. I am not contending that what we get must\nbe true, but that it is likely to be an interpretation, though\na crude and faulty interpretation, of a truth. If so, what is\nthis truth ? That is the question upon which Mr. Milburn\nmight turn his searchlight. As far as I can see it is personal\nsurvival, or something to which our present concept of personal\nsurvival is the nearest approximation.\nDream-analysis, by the way, demonstrates that loss of reciprocity\nbetween the fractions of our personality can, on occasion, lessen the\nmind's touch with truth ; I know of no evidence or argument to show\nthat an access of reciprocity between mind and mind can have\nthis effect, unless the \" reciprocity \" is entered into with an\nactual desire for self-deception. But this is not reciprocity ; it\nis not integration, but disintegration, of mind; and as a matter\nof experience it is not by this process of disintegrative association,\nif I ma}'^ so call it, that any coherent evidence purports to come\nthrough. By Miss Sinclair's hypothesis, on the other hand, the\nleast reliable sitters would get the most \" evidential \" results.\nPerhaps Miss Sinclair has not yet taken into account the teleological\nfunction of the unconscious, as studied by the more inductive\nmethod of Jung and the Swiss School : this is a valuable corrective\nof Freud's hyper-analysis.

(Methuen.)\nThis little book, which is introduced by a Prefatory Note\nfrom Sir Oliver Lodge, contains an excellent and clearly written\naccount of telepathic phenomena which have come under the\nwriter's own notice, and forms a valuable contribution to the\nliterature on the subject. Mr. Baggally's exceptional experience as an\ninvestigator is well known, and this, coupled with his natural acumen\nand his skill as an amateur conjurer, entitles his testimony to implicit\ncredence. A reader would, I think, receive this impression from a\nstudy of the genuine cases recorded here, which are strong and con-\nvincing, and it would be strengthened by the accounts given of the\ncases in which the author has detected fraud. He was unable to\ndiscover the secret of the Zancigs' extraordinary performances.\nTo those who have studied telepathy it is strange that there\nshould still be any who doubt whether it is indeed an incon-\ntestable fact ;\nfor anyone who chooses can prove it for himself\nby experiments with simple diagrams or outline sketches. I\nmade such experiments myself some thirty years ago, and with\ncompletely satisfactory results ; for I often acted as the '\nper-\ncipient,' thus assuring myself that all deception, intentional or\nunintentional, was excluded. During the experiments a curious\nfact emerged\u2014namely, that the picture received by the percipient\nmay represent the original multiplied or divided or both at\nonce. I have not the records at hand\u2014I think the S.P.R. has\nthem, but I can give two instances from memory. In one case\nthe original was the figure 6. What I saw, in lines of light on\na black background, was two circles above two straight lines\nwhich formed a St. Andrew's cross. In the other case the original\nwas the figure 3. What I saw was three sides of a scalloped\npicture-frame, the points of the scallops being turned inwards.\nThis was clearly the 3 multiplied some 10 or 15 times. Such\ncases were strikingly convincing. I need scarcely say that the\noriginals used in the experimeiits represented many other things\nbesides numerals. If anyone after such an experience is still ready\nto believe that the results come about by chance, it seems to\nme that he only offers another example of the extraordinary\ncredulity of the incredulous. For, of course, the number of\npossible original diagrams or sketches is practically infinite.\nM. A. Bayfield.\n\fNos. CCCXLII.-XLIII.\u2014Vol. XVIII.

Report of the Council for the Year 1917. 135\nEEPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1917.\nThough the continuance of the war still interferes in more\nways than one with the work of our Society, there are distinct\nsigns that the interest in it has increased during the last\nyear. This is shown in the applications for membership and\nin the enquiries and correspondence received at the Office.\nAs regards membership, new Members to the number of\n49, including 1 Corresponding Member, and new Associates\nto the number of 83, including 1 Honorary Associate, have\nbeen elected during the year\u2014in all, 132. This compares\nwith 80 in 1916, 41 in 1915 and 85 in 1914, and is even\na little more than the pre-war number in 1913, which was\n129. Moreover, the increase in number of Members is\nmarkedly greater in proportion than that of Associates.\nThere have as usual been transferences from the class\nof Members to that of Associates and vice versa\u20146 Asso-\nciates becoming Members, and 4 Members becoming Associates.\nThere have also, of course, been losses from deaths, resigna-\ntions, and simple lapse of subscriptions without notice. These\namount to 13 Members and 57 Associates\u2014an aggregate of 70.\nIt is noteworthy that this is markedly less than in any\nother of the last five years, in which the number varied\nbetween 104 in 1913 and 137 in 1915. Of those who have\ngiven reasons for resigning none have expressed dissatisfac-\ntion with the Society's work.\nThe net increase during the year is 62 ; and the membership\nof the Society now stands at 1147, distributed as follows\n:\nMembers, 312 (including 38 Honorary and Corresponding\nMembers) ;\nAssociates, 835 (including 14 Honorary Associates).\nA large membership is of course important and valuable,\nboth because it guarantees interest in our work and because\nit provides funds for carrying it on. But the Society has\nanother object which those engaged in its administration\nhave always hoped extended membership would promote\u2014\nnamely, the obtaining of evidence concerning the phenomena\nwhich the Society exists to study. Among a large nmnber\nof members, a certain nmnber of real workers and students\nshould be found, and are found, though they are fewer just\nnow than they might be, owing to the war, and though even\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. feb.-Mar., 1918.\nbefore the war they were perhaps fewer than might have\nbeen expected. But what was even more looked for was that\nextended membership would bring us into touch with useful\nand well-evidenced spontaneous and sporadic cases of the\nvarious kinds of psychical phenomena with which our Journal\nand Proceedings have made us all familiar. As has been\nfrequently said, the collection and putting on record of such\ncases are very important ; not only because there is great need\nof increasing the mass of evidence, especially of adding to it\ncontemporary cases ; but also because no two cases are quite\nalike, so that they throw light on one another and help towards\nthe understanding of the whole subject of telepathy, its nature\nand extent, the powers and subliminal working of the human\nmind, and the question of its survival. Experiments are no\ndoubt in some respects more valuable than spontaneous cases,\nbecause, among other reasons, we can more easily in experi-\nmental cases define the conditions under which the phenomena\noccur, and eliminate normal causes. But spontaneous cases\ninclude a wider range and may reveal possibilities of which\nexperiments give no obvious hint, and may, and do, thus lead\nto fruitful lines of speculation and investigation. Well-defined\nand well- evidenced spontaneous cases are, however, rare, and\nthe Society depends for them largely on the goodwill and\nalertness of its members in collecting and recording them.\nThis has often been said, but is so important that it can\nhardly be said too often, especially as it seems still doubtful\nhow far members fully realise it. We must not be ungrateful.\nThere are members who take a good deal of trouble in sending\nus accounts of experiences that have befallen them or of\nwhich they have heard, and among the cases sent to us\nsome are of course very interesting. It is to be feared,\nhowever, that informants are sometimes disappointed that\nmore use cannot be made of what they tell us. This,\nunfortunately, is inevitable. Some of these experiences are in\nthemselves too vague to be useful, and some cannot be\nbrought up to the necessary evidential standard. Nevertheless,\nwe are very glad that they are sent to us. It is far\nbetter that doubtful cases which prove unavailable as evidence\nfor supernormal phenomena should be sent, than that there\nshould be any risk of losing cases which, even if they\n\fFeb. -Mab., 1918. Report of the Council for the Year 1917. 137\nappear doubtful at first, may on further investigation prove\ngood.\nIt may be thought that members do send us all the\ngood cases they hear of, and that the reason we do not\nreceive more is that they rarely occur. It is quite true,\nas already said, that they are rare, but there are indica-\ntions that we do not receive all that our members know of.\nFor instance, our attention has recently been drawn to an\nessay published by a valued member of the Society, in which\nis described, apparently at second-hand, a curious and illuminat-\ning instance of telepathy, on which the essayist herself lays\ngreat stress as an illustration of her views. It may no doubt\nbe impossible to get evidence at first-hand concerning the\ncase, but it seems a great pity that a complete account of\nit was not sent to us when it was fresh, and thus placed\npermanently on record in an accessible form.\nAs regards study and experiment, as we have said, the\nwar naturally takes from our work some of those who would\notherwise be advancing it, and we have, we believe, good\ngrounds to hope for accessions to the ranks of workers when\nthe war is over. In the meanwhile work goes on, if less\nin amoimt than we should desire. The automatists who\nhave already rendered so much assistance, still contribute\nscripts and impressions which are carefully studied. Thus\nMrs. Salter and Mrs. Wilson continue their experiments from\ntime to time.\nMiss F. M. Stawell, who has long been an associate and\ninterested in our work, contributed a careful study of some\nof the scripts that have been published, which was read\nat one of our meetings. It was her first contribution to our\nProceedings.\nAnother member of the Society, Mr. Girdlestone, is engaged\nin systematic experiments in telepathy of the old type\n\u2014\ntransference of diagrams, etc. \u2014which seem likely to lead\nto some good results.\nTwo members of the Society\u2014Miss Radclyfie-Hall and\nMrs. Troubridge\u2014new workers\u2014have during the past year\nhad a long series of carefully recorded sittings with IVIrs.\nOsborne Leonard with interesting results. They have prepared\na long report on these, some part of which will be read\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. fkb.-Mae., 1918.\nat the meeting on January 31st, and some part, it is hoped,\nat a future meeting this year.\nPartly in consequence of this report, and partly because of\nSir Oliver Lodge's experiences, and of accounts received by\nhim, arrangements have been made with Mrs. Leonard to place\nher services at the disposal of the Society for a period, and\nsittings are being arranged, conducted according to rules\nlaid down by a Committee appointed by the Council, who\nalso have the duty of selecting sitters. During her engagement\nby the Society Mrs. Leonard undertakes to give no sittings\nexcept to sitters sent by the Committee. Mrs. Leonard's\nmediumship resembles to a considerable extent that of Mrs.\nPiper and Mrs. Thompson, and it has seemed worth while to\nstudy it in a similar manner.\nSir William Barrett, with the consent of the Council, invited\nto London his friends Mrs. Travers Smith and Mr. Lennox\nEobinson, some of whose automatic communications, by means\nof an ouija board, he spoke of in the paper read by him\nto the Society in November. Their visit, which took place\nthe week before Christmas, was unfortunately somewhat\nshort, and but little notice could be given. Nevertheless\nseveral members of the Council and others were able to see\nthe methods used and the rapid movements of the travelling-\npointer in finding the letters wanted in a promiscuously\narranged alphabet, the operators being blindfolded in the\nmanner used in the experiments at Dublin. The circumstances,\nhowever, did not admit of much experimental work.\nWe have to record with great regret the retirement in\nOctober of Mr. H. Arthur Smith from the Honorary Treasurer-\nship of the Society on account of failing health. He had\nheld the office for thirty-one years and worked devotedly for\nthe Society, and the loss is therefore great. We have been\nfortunate in being able to persuade Mr. Piddington to under-\ntake the work of Honorary Treasurer temporarily, and hope\nthat he will carry it on till the end of the war.\nWe have to record the loss by death of a member of the\nCommittee of Reference and Publication\u2014Miss Jane Barlow.\nShe had kindly served on that Committee for many years\nand always read with interest and attention the papers sub-\nmitted to her.\n\fFeb. -Mae., 1918. Report of the Council for the Year 1917. 139\nTwo Parts of the Proceedings have been published\u2014Part\nLXXIII. in March and Part LXXIV. in December. The\nlast was very considerably delayed by the difficulty in getting\nprinting work done, and we are still waiting for the index\nand list of members which will complete Volmne XXIX.\nThe sales of Proceedings through the Secretary of the Society\nhave been unusually large\u2014decidedly larger than in any of\nthe last five years. This is doubtless chiefly owing to the\nbuying of back numbers by new Members and Associates.\nOn the other hand, the sales through our agents to outsiders\nhave been small, probably because the bulk of Proceedings\npublished since December, 1915, when Vol. XXVIII. appeared,\nhas been less than usual.\nThe Librarian\u2014Miss Newton\u2014reports that the Library\nhas been fairly well used. More volumes have been taken\nout for reading than usual, but on the other hand fewer\nMembers and Associates have read in the Library itself.\nIn the summer Messrs. Kegan, Paul, Trench, Trubner and\nCo., the publishers of Phantasms of the Living, now long\nout of print, suggested that a new edition of this classic\nof Psychical Research should be issued, abridged so as to\noccupy one volume only. The Council agreed, and entrusted\nthe preparation of the new edition to Mrs. .\nSidgwick. It is\nexpected to appear shortly. The Council take this opportunity\nof expressing their thanks to Mrs. Sidgwick for the trouble\nshe has so kindly taken in the matter.\nFour meetings have been held during the year at which\npapers were read.\nOn January 31st, at a General Meeting, Dr. Constance Long\nread a paper on \" The Psycho-analytic use of Subliminal\nMaterial,\" which it is hoped may be published in a forthcoming\nnumber of the Proceedings.\nOn April 26th, at a Private Meeting, a discussion was\nheld on \" The Development of Different Types of Evidence\nfor Personal Survival.\" It was opened by Mrs. Sidgwick vnth\na paper giving a resume of the history of the subject in the\narmals of the Society, and Miss Stawell followed with a paper\nwhich was in the main a criticism of the evidence in Mr.\nBalfour's paper on the \" Ear of Dionysius \" case. Both\nthese papers have been pubUshed in Part LXXIV. of the\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Fkb.-Mae., 1918.\nProceedings. The discussion was continued by Sir Oliver\nLodge, the President (Dr. Jacks), and others.\nOn June 28th, at a General Meeting, Dr. Jacks gave his\nPresidential Address, of which the subject was \" The Theory\nof Survival in the Light of its Context.\" This also has been\npublished in Part LXXIV. of Proceedings.\nOn November 22nd, at a Private Meeting, Sir William\nBarrett read a paper entitled \" Two Interesting Cases of\nSupernormal Action and their Psychological Significance.\"\nON THE \"ST. PAUL\" CROSS-CORRESPONDENCE.\nA Rejoinder to Dr. Walter F. Prince's Further Remarks.\nBy J. G. PiDDINGTON.\nThe two main points of my criticism of Dr. Prince's proposal\nto read II Peter 3. 15 in place of the actual reference given in\nMrs. Holland's script {Journal for July 1917) are (a) that he\nemends a reference in a script when there is nothing in the\ncontext to show that the reference is wrong ; and (6) that he\nbases his emendation not on the strength of something to be\nfound in Mrs. Holland's script but on the strength of something\nin another automatist's script.\nIn the Journal for Dec. 1917 -Jan. 1918, Dr. Prince retorts\nthat I have frequently dealt with Mrs. Piper's script ^ in the\nvery way that I criticise him for dealing with Mrs. Holland's :\nnamely, by emending a word or phrase both when no dissatisfac-\ntion with it is expressed in the context, and also on the strength of\nsomething in another automatist's script or elsewhere [e.g. in a book).\nHe argues, in effect, that, if he is a kettle, I as a pot have no right\nto call him black. To justify his retort he cites from a paper of\nmine published in Proc, Vol. XXII., various instances where (so he\nclaims) I have disregarded three rules I myself formulated in the\n1 What I said in the Journal for July, 1917, about the emendation of\nscripts was meant to apply, not to Mrs. Piper's trance-writing and trance-\nspeech, but to the scripts of such automatists as Mrs. and Miss Verrall,\nMrs. Holland, Mrs. Willett, the Macs, and Mrs. King. These latter are, as\n1 said, \" for the most part incoherent in the strict sense of the word,\"\nwhereas for the most part Mrs. Piper's trance-writing and voice-sittings\naro not. In the case of Mrs. Piper, accordingly, greater latitude may,\nperhaps, be allowed in the matter of emendation than in the case of the\nother automatists. I will not, however, take advantage of this possibility\nin replying to Dr. Prince's charge of inconsistency.\n\fFeb. -Mar., 1918. ''St. Paid\" Cross-GovvesiJondence. 141\nJournal for July 1917, relative to the emendation of scripts. It is\nnot always clear to me which particular rule is supposed to be\nviolated in any given instance ;\nbut that perhaps doesn't matter.\nAnyhow I will deal with each instance in the order given by\nDr. Prince.\n\" Evangelical \" and \" Evelyn Hope.\" On Feb. 27, 1907, says\nDr. Prince, \" '\nEvangelical '\nwas again written. It did not connect\nwith anything, but what of that\u2014since scripts are '\nfor the most\npart . . . incoherent ' ? But Mr. Piddington was unaccountably\ndisturbed, and pointedly asked Myers if the word was right.\"\nI certainly asked Myersp if the word was right, though not\nfor the reason assigned by Dr. Prince. On Feb. 11, 1907 (p. 320),*\nit had been given as \" Evangelical \" ;\nthen on Feb. 27, 1907,\nit was first given as \" evangelic \" and immediately afterwards\nas \" Evangical.\" I read \" Evangical \" out loud as \" Evangelical,\"\nand, in order to make sure that by \" Evangical \" Evangelical\n\"\nwas meant, asked if\n\" Evangelical \" were right (p. 334). Dr.\nPrince's statement that I was disturbed has no foundation ;\nI\nwas simply, as in numerous other cases, taking care to get a\ndoubtful reading confirmed or rejected by the control.\nAgain, Dr. Prince says that my only reason for transmuting\n\" Evangelical \" into \" Evelyn Hope \" was that Myersp had said\nhe had given \" Evangelical \" to Mrs. Verrall, and that while\nMrs. Verrall's script contained nothing which would link on\nto \" Evangelical,\" it did contain something which would link\non to\n\u2022'\nEvelyn Hope.\" The only thing in Mrs. Verrall's script\nwith which, so far as I knew at the time, Mrs. Piper's \" Evelyn\nHope \" would link on was the misquotation from Abt Vogler in her\nscript of Jan. 28, 1907: \"the hope that leaves the earth for the\nsky.\" As the script containing this misquotation opened with the\nword Aster (=star), quoted twice from Browning, and emphasised\nthe word Hope by means of the misquotation ;\nand as \" Hope\nStar and Browning \" had already been given in the Piper trance as\na cross-correspondence with Mrs. Verrall's script, what object was\nthere to be gained by my suggesting that \" Evangelical \" had been\ngiven in error for \" Evelyn Hope \" 1 Success had already been\nachieved, as both I and Myersp knew. Why, then, should I seek\nto get the success repeated, especially when the repetition would\nbe valueless ?\n1 Here and elsewhere the page references are to Proc, Vol. XXII.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb.-Mak., 1918.\nIf \" Evelyn Hope \" had never been written in Mrs. Piper's\nscript, and if on the strength of something in another auto-\nmatist's script I had manufactured a cross-correspondence by\naltering \" Evangelical \" into \" Evelyn Hope,\" then I should\nhave done the kind of thing that Dr. Prince has done in his\nreconstruction of the \" St. Paul \" cross-correspondence.\nBel Sarto. In suggesting that the reason for the choice of\n\" Del Sarto \" as a cross-correspondence was that it will serve\nas an anagram of lode-star, I may have let my fancy run riot.\nBut far from wanting to alter \" Del Sarto \" into something\nelse, as Dr. Prince wants to alter II Peter 1. 15 into II Peter 3. 15,\nit is essential to my suggestion to accept the reading of the manu-\nscript.\nDr. Prince claims for the \" St. Paul \" cross-correspondence\nas reconstructed by himself that it \"is surpassed in value by\nvery few in the series, if by any.\" I did no more than suggest\nthat \" Del Sarto \" may be a possible anagrammatic cross-corre-\nspondence with Mrs. and Miss Verrall's anagrams on \" aster\n\"\nand \" star.\" Dr. Prince achieves his almost unsurpassed cross-\ncorrespondence by altering the text; my admittedly doubtful\ninstance of cross-correspondence requires no alteration in the text.\nMaud Carten-Carter. In discussing the possibility of there\nbeing some causal relation between the appearance in Mrs. Piper's\ntrance of the names Dorothy and Marion Carver (the second\nname being that of an old acquaintance of Miss Verrall's) and\n\" Maud Carten-Carier not a relation\u2014but an old acquaintance\nDorothy \" in Mrs. Holland's script,^ I was careful to say that\nthe connexion is vague and the coincidence slight. And I should\nnot have called attention to the coincidence at all, were it not\nthat it forms part of a series of coincidences, the rest of which\nare far less easily ascribable to chance. The coincidence between\n\" Marion Carver\u2014Dorothy \" (Piper) and \" Maud Garten\u2014Dorothy\n\"\n(Holland) is, as it were, merely the trimmings of the central\ncross-correspondence \" Diana\u2014Candle \" \" Artemis\u2014Candle.\" The\ncentral cross-correspondence holds good whether the trimmings\nbe allowed or not. Disallow the alteration of II Peter 1. 15\ninto II Peter 3. 15, and the \" St. Paul \" cross-correspondence\nas interpreted by Dr. Prince falls to the ground.\nSasia Saisia Francis.

The main evidence for the cross-correspondence\nwith Mrs. Piper on the subject of \" Diana \" rests on another\nscript of Mrs. Verrall's, where the name \" Diana \" is given and\nthe goddess referred to in various ways. If my emendation be\nrejected, the cross-correspondence \" Diana \" rests on as sure\na. foundation as before.\nIf Dr. Prince's emendation of Mrs. Holland's reference to the\nSecond Epistle of Peter be rejected, the St. \" Paul \" cross-corre-\nspondence as he interprets it collapses.\nThis completes what I have to say in answer to the charge\nof having broken my own rules concerning emendation of scripts.\nIn what follows I deal with two fiirther criticisms which Dr.\nPrince has thrown in as make-weights.\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. fkb.-Mar., 1918.-\nIn the decent obscurity of a footnote he invites his readers\nto \" note the reasoning displayed \" by me \" in a few instances \" :\nmeaning thereby my faulty reasoning in two instances. The\nfirst instance is my treating \" Laus Deo \" uttered in Mrs. Piper's\nwaking-stage as a possible cross-correspondence with \" Laus Deo \"\nwritten five months earlier by Mrs. Verrall. Dr. Prince says it would\nnever have occurred to him to treat the coincidence as other\nthan accidental. Nor would it have occurred to me, except for\nthe reasons which I have given on pp. 305-307.\nThe second instance is my describing \" Blanche de Lys or\nsome such name \" in Mrs. Verrall's script of Feb. 18, 1907, as\na reminiscence of \" Blanche comme un lys \" in a poem of Villon's.\nOn this Dr. Prince remarks :\n\" Why there should be a remini-\nscence of Villon does not, so far as I have been able to discover,^\nappear. It is quite possible that researches still farther into\nFrench literature might find '\nBlanche de Lys '\nas a name, which\nis what the script pronounced it.\"\nIn the first place \" Blanche \" is a name in the poem of Villon's\n;\nand in the second place Dr. Prince's acquaintance with my writings\nis so extensive and peculiar, and his interest in them so fatherly,\nthat I am surprised at hie not having succeeded in discovering\nwhy I called \" Blanche de Lys \" a reminiscence of \" Blanche\ncomme un lys.\" For in an analysis of the script in question\npublished in Proc., Vol. XXIV., pp. 13-16, I quote the following\nlines from the poem of Villon's (the celebrated Ballade des Dames\ndu Temps jadis)\n:\nLa royiie Blanche comme ung lys\nQui chantoit a voix de sereine,\nBerthe au gi'and pied, Bietris, AUys,\nHarembourgps qui tint le Mayne,\nEt Jehanne la bonne Lorraine\nQu' Anglois bruslferent a Rouen,\nOil sont-ilz, Vierge souveraine ?\nMais oil sent les neiges d'antan ?\nNow in Mrs. Verrall's script \" Blanche de Lys or some such\nname \" is immediately preceded by the refrain of the Ballade ;\n\" (Mais ou sont] les neiges d'antan ?\n\"\nWith this explanation before him I hope Dr. Prince will be\nready to cancel the bad-conduct mark he has set against my\n\" reasoning \" in respect, at least, of this subordinate item in his.\nindictment.\n\fFeb.-BIak., 1918. Correspondence. 145\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nSUEGEON HADFIELD'S EXPERIMENTS.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014There is one feature in Surgeon Hadfield's experiments\n;in hypnotic suggestion as reported, from the Lancet, in this Journal\nfor January, which appears, so far as I can see, to bear on a\nmuch bigger issue than that which the experiments were instituted\nto decide. In fact there is no bigger issue before science at the\npresent day. According to the mechanistic interpretation of life,\nas expounded by Schafer, Loeb, and many others\u2014a powerful\nthough I think now diminishing school of scientific thought\u2014-all\nliving things, including man, are merely sentient automata. They\nmay have thoughts, sensations and the illusion of will, but these\ncan have no influence whatever on their acts, which are linked\ntogether in an inevitable sequence of physical cause and effect.\nNo psychic factor can, it is argued, edge its way in so as to\ncause the smallest deflection in the current of this mechanical\nprocess without contravening the law of the conservation of\nenergy. Thus evolution would have taken precisely the course\nit did, and man would have written epics, built temples and made\nwar and love just as at present, even thoiigh the earthly scene\nhad never been visited by one throb of feeling or one ray of\nconsciousness.\nBut now Surgeon Hadfield has brought to light (quite undesignedly,\nas I understand) the pregnant fact that when it is suggested to an\nhypnotic patient that he shall feel no pain from a burn, the burn\nheals rapidly, without hyperaemia or suppuration, while an exactly\nsimilar burn inflicted without suggestion on the same patient at the\nsame time runs the ordinary course. But the pain which by its\npresence or absence can thus apparently deflect the current of\nmaterial force, is a purely psychic phenomenon. As a rule, the\nbiologist of the mechanistic school finds or thinks he finds no\ndifiiculty in linking-up the action of the afferent with that of the\n\u2022efferent nervous system without interposing any psychic link. Here,\nhowever, it does not seem possible to short-circuit the process.\nThere can be no question of the associative action of related\nnerve-impressions, for as a matter of fact there is no constant\nassociation between pain and hyperaemia. We often have acute\npain, as in neuralgia, without any visible symptom whatever, and\nwe can have a marked degree of hyperaemia without pain. In\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb.-Mar., 1918.\nthe case before us there was no intention to inhibit hyperaemia.\nNothing was inhibited but pain.\nOn the face of the experiment, then, it seems that the purely\npsA^chic condition of the inhibition of pain has produced the\npurely physical condition of the inhibition of hyperaemia. If that\nis so, then it is all up with the mechanistic theory of life.\nIt would be well that further experiments should be undertaken\nwith this aspect of Surgeon Hadfield's most interesting discovery\nin view.-\u2014Yours truly,\n; T. W. ROLLESTON.\n16 Prince Arthur Road.\nHampstead, N.W. 3, Januanj, 1918.\nON THE EVIDENCE FOE SUEVIVAL.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014I have read with interest Dr. Jack's criticism in the\nlast number of the Journal on Professor Hyslop's views. May T\nin my turn criticise his ? He states that \" any attempt to prove\ndirectly from the testimony of '\nMyers '\nthat it is Myers who is\nbearing testimony, will leave us reasoning in a circle and the\nconclusion will be worthless.\" But it seems to my humble intelli-\ngence that it is Dr. Jack's arguments which leave us \" reasoning\nin a circle.\" How can it be proved that it is Myers communi-\ncating except through the nature of \" Myers \" testimony ? Dr.\nJacks says proof is \" ideally possible.\" But if based upon his\nown reasoning, it is jmictically impossible. I agree with him that\n\" only when every other person or agency is eliminated, have we\na right to assume it is Myers\u2014left standing as the only possible\nsource.\" But will Dr. Jacks explain how, according to his ideas,\nhe proi^oses that this can be done ? For he goes on to suggest that\neven if a correct reading of Myers' sealed packet had been obtained\nunder conditions which eliminated fraud, we are still up against\nthe possibility that Myers in his lifetime telepathically com-\nmunicated it to the sub-consciousness of half-a-dozen people who\nagain telepathically passed it on to others, so that it became\ncommon property in the sub-consciousness of a whole group, ready\nto come forth when occasion should arise.\nNow, if this universal sort of sub-conscious telepathy is always\ngoing on, it seems to me that all attempts to prove survival\nmight as well be abandoned. For I cannot see that it could ever\n\fFEB.-MAR., 1918. Corresi:>ondence. 147\"\nbe got over, or such a possibility eliminated from any test, any\nexperiment that could suggest itself to the human mind. Further,\nit would be a complete overthrow to our practical conduct of life.\nDr. Jacks alludes to the Tichborne case. It will suit very well\nfor an illustration of my meaning.\nThe case for the Claimant largely broke down because he was\nunable to give facts and details connected with his boyhood and\nearlier life, which would certainly have been known to the real\nRoger Tichborne. Now, had it been otherwise and had he success-\nfully given those facts, would Dr. Jacks have discounted this\nevidence, and suggested that he had obtained his knowledge\ntelepathically from the brain of counsel, judge, or anyone else in\nor out of court, who knew the correct answers ? Yet such a\nsupposition would be no more far-fetched than his suggestion\nregarding the sealed packet, if it had been correctly read. In\nshort, if this sort of reasoning is going to be admitted, it appears\nto me that a great deal of the fabric on which the law of evidence\nrests, goes by the board. By it, Dr. Jacks shuts the lid down on\nmore than the possibility of proving survival after death. He\nshuts it also on the possibility of our conducting our daily lives\nby the common sense rules which have hitherto guided the world.\nMy objections apply equally to Miss Stawell's criticism of the\nevidence in the Ear of Dionysius case.\nBut perhaps both these able writers who have far more experi-\nence than I can lay claim to, will say what proof they have\nthat this \" sub-conscious telepathic leakage \" exists to the extent\nthey assume. Like Rosa Dartle, I only ask to know. I am an\nhonest investigator\u2014out for the Truth.\u2014Yours truly,\n(Mrs.) Leila Boustead.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.K.\nK. F. R. in his letter in the last number of the Jouriinl\nseems to me to have slightly obscured the issues of his own\nadmission, and the point of \"Miss Sinclair's hypothesis.\" ^ He\nsays :\n\" Granted the tendency, and the power, of our unconscious\nselves to invent or discover things, singly and in constructive\ntelepathic collaboration, the problem remains of the quality of\nthese collaborations \" ; and he asks whether it is philosophically\nthinka.ble that the unconsciously collaborating minds of psychical\n^ See Journal for May-June 1917. \u2022\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb. -Mar., 1918.\nresearchers should enter into psychic reciprocity to construct\na lie ?\nThen he goes on to Dream analysis. \" Dream-analysis,\" he says,\n\" demonstrates that loss of reciprocity between the fractions of\nour personality, can, on occasion, lessen the mind's touch with\ntruth \" ; he knows of \"no evidence or argument to show that an\naccess of reciprocity between mind and mind can have this effect,\nunless the \" reciprocity \" is entered into with an actual desire for\nself-deception.\" He says that this \" is not reciprocity ; it is not\nintegration, but disintegration, of mind.\"\nIs he quite sure ? Even supposing that there really is no\nevidence to show that an access of reciprocity lessens the mind's\ntouch with truth, has he any evidence to show that it increases\nit ? That its presence is even a condition predisposing to the\ntouch with truth ? The case for survival requires this positive\nevidence which is precisely what is not forthcoming.\nAnd why should K. F. R. suppose that \" by Miss Sinclair's\nhypothesis the least reliable sitters would get the most '\nevidential\n'\nresults ?\n\" On my hypothesis, following the analogy of dream-\nanalysis, you would get an elaborate drama, an intricate system\nof cross-correspondences expressing the dominant desire\u2014to prove\nsurvival. The least reliable sitters would be expected to contribute\nthe vaguest and most conflicting results. Which is what actually\nhappens. For results that stagger the sceptic we should look to\nthe most scrupulous sitters who desire that survival shall be\nproved, not taken for granted or merely indicated. If that desire\nis to have even an illusory fulfilment the system must be more\ncoherent and logical than the structure of any dream. It must\nlook like proof.\nI can assure K. F. R. that I have not been led away by\n' Freud's hyper-analysis.\" My \" hypothesis,\" such as it is, would\nhave had very little to support it if I had \" not taken into\naccount the teleological function of the unconscious, as studied\nby the more inductive method of Jung and the Swiss School.\"\nYet here again K. F. R. seems to me to be [mixing things. Jung's\nteleology has its place^\u2014and a great place\u2014in the philosophic\nargument for survival ; but it should not be used to bolster up\nthe evidence for alleged \" communications.\" The substitution of\nBynthesis for \" hyper-analysis \" was part of Jung's practice as a\npsychologist and psychotherapist ; its comparative success bears on\nthe question of survival only in the vague sense that every point\n\fFeb. -Mar., 1918. Correspondence. 149\ngained by the psyche for the psyche is a point for the survivalist\nwho must show that there is such a thing as a psyche to survive.\nBut all the time he (and Professor Jung) are dealing with the\nincarnate psyche, and the higher its score the less need to drag\nin the discarnate.\nBut 1 agree with K. F. R. that the \" quality \" of telepathic\ncollaborations is important. There are, no doubt, limits to the\ncollaborating powers of subconscious minds, and for all we know\nthe \" quality \" of recent cross-correspondences surpasses them.\nBut until we know definitely what those limits are we have no\nright to talk about sm-passing, and about survival being proved.\nMay Sinclair.\nJanuary lUh, 1918.\nDE. SCHILLER'S REVIEW OF THE DORIS FISCHER CASE.\n[We have, almost as we were going to press, received from Professor\nHyslop personal explanations in relation to a portion of Dr. Schiller s\nreview of the Doris Fischer Case. We are unable to print the\nwhole, but give here extracts.']\nProfessor Schiller's review of the Doris Fischer Case in the\nlast number of the Proceedings (Vol. XXIX.) is too fair to take\nup any space for controversy on points of difference which are\nnot great enough to affect the main issue, but I ought perhaps\nto mention a few misunderstandings of my position for which\nhe may not be to blame. I had to abbreviate discussion more\nthan the subject demanded in a volume already too long to appeal\nto readers, and perhaps I allowed too much for ideas and positions\nstated in previous publications. However that may be I seem not\nto have made myself clear on some points. In one passage\nProfessor Schiller says :\n\" Dr. Hyslop not unnaturally prefers to believe in his medium's\n'\ncontrols,' but he hardly appears to recognize what a monstrous\ntale they have induced him to tell. He asks us to believe that\na titanic struggle between the powers of good and evil was going\non for years, over, and in, the soul of '\nDoris Fischer.'\nIt is hardly correct to say that I \" prefer to believe in the\nmedium's controls \" to believing Sleeping Margaret's claims. I\ndo not believe what any control says. To me the statements of\ncontrols must always be \" proved \" in some way. . . . Unconscious\ndistortion by the medium and the control may make any state-\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, feb.-bur., 1918.\nment so dubious by itself that its credibility must be determined\nby its relation to the whole of the statements made by controls.\nIt was the manner in which the statements of the controls hung\ntogether that made it necessary to reckon with them in the\nformation of an hypothesis, not in accepting them as facts without\nquestion. . . .\nNor do I ask any one to \" believe that a titanic struggle\nbetween the powers of good and evil was going on for years over,\nand in, the soul of Doris Fischer.\" That is a superficial view of\nthe facts. I neither believed nor disbelieved in such a view.\nI had to state the facts as they came, and indicated the doubts\nabout such an interpretation. . . .\nI do not think there is any evidence in the record that the\n\" distinguished persons \" in control are under any delusion about\nthe \" struggle being still on.\" That is the superficial appearance.\nBut as the subconscious of Mrs. Chenoweth has to interpret\nsymbols, and as memories to discarnate observers may not alwaj^^s\nbe distinguished from present mental states, the time element\nin the transmission may be an inference of the subconscious. . . .\nI may add that \" Imperator and Co.\", on any theory of them,\nknow all about the war and its character, and have alluded to\nit in vigorous enough terms. ... '\nNow just a word as to what I mean by \" spirit \" . . . to\nprevent misunderstanding on the part of readers in general. . . .\nMy tolerance for the spiritistic theory is based upon our absolute\nignorance as to what a spirit is or would do. They not only\nhave to prove their existence to me, but also what they can do.\nI have no other conception of a spirit to start with than that\nit is a stream of consciousness with its memories of the earthly\nexistence. This must have a subject, of course, but what that\nis I neither know nor care in the first stages of my investigation.\nI even accept this definition of it only in deference to the condi-\ntion of proving its existence. A soul might lose its memory\nin toto, but I could never prove its existence if it did. So I\ndefine it in the only terms which make it possible to prove its\nexistence. . . .\nI take no such view of spirits and their work as is usually\nsupposed, especially by the Spiritualists. I have no other con-\nception of them than that fragmentary thing indicated by the\nfacts. .... '\nJames H. Hyslop.\n\fFeb.-Mak., 1918. Review. 151\nImmortality. An Essay in Discovery coordinating Scientific, Psychical,\nand Biblical Research ;\nby B. H. Streeter, A. Glutton-Brock,\nC. W. Emmet, J. A. Hadfield, and the author of Pro Christo\net Ecclesia. Macmillan & Co., 1917.\nThis interesting book attempts in a series of essays, independent\nbut inter-connected, to formulate what can at present be known\nor reasonably surmised about survival and a future life. It i<^\naddressed to the general reader, and assumes no expert knowledge\nwhether in Biblical criticism, or psychical research, or psychology,\nor biology, or any other subject on which it touches. As was\ntherefore almost inevitable, its comprehensive survey is likely to\nappear to the expert somewhat slight and superficial. The book\nis in the main theological, but subjects with which our Society\nis concerned are treated of in two of the essays ; and it is\ninteresting to note that at least three of the writers appear\nto regard telepathy as an established fact which cannot be ignored\nin considering the nature of the human mind. This attitude\ntowards telepathy is certainly on the increase and must be regarded\nas one of the results of our Society's labours.\nThe two essays which directly concern us as members of the\nS.P.R. are No. II., entitled \" The Mind and the Brain,\" by\nJ. A. Hadfield, M.A., M.B., surgeon in the Royal Navy,i and\nNo. VII., entitled \" The Good and Evil of Spiritualism,\" by\nthe author of Pro Christo et Ecclesia (Miss L. Dougall). The first\nof these, in the words of its synopsis, maintains that though \" the\nmind is always found associated with a brain \" it \" shows an\nincreasing tendency to become independent \" and \" the tendency\nof the mind towards independence and autonomy suggests the\npossibility of its becoming entirely liberated from the body,\nand continuing to exist in a disembodied state.\" This thesis is\nsupported by arguments drawn from the influence of the mind\non the brain and nervous system, hypnotism, the power of the\nmind to heal bodily disease by mental suggestion, telepathy,\nand the biological development of the mind. The author's\nexperience as a medical man enables him to speak with authority\non mental cures and to give some interesting examples.\nMiss Dougall, in Essay VII., one of three for which she is\n1 Some very interesting experiments by Mr. Haddeld, in the raising of\nblisters by suggestion, described in the Lancet, were referred to in the last\nnumber of the Journal, and a letter concerning them appears in our corre-\nspondence in the present number.\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Had it done so, she would doubtless have written the paiagraph\non \" ghosts \" (p. 278) somewhat differently. For, as a matter of fact,\nunrecognised apparitions, not to speak of non-veridical apparations of living\npersons, appear to be commoner than apparitions of the dead. Most of\nus probably agree with her that apparitions, whether of the living or the\ndead, and whether viridical or not, are sensory hallucinations.\n\fNos. CCCXLIV.-XLV.\u2014Vol. XVIII.

The Folkestone Poltergeist. 155\nTHE FOLKESTONE POLTERGEIST.\nBy Sir W. F. Barrett and Mr. Thos. Hesketh.\nIntroduction by Sir W. F. Barrett.\nOn November 21st, 1917, Mr. Thos. Hesketh, M.I.E.E., the\nchief engineer of the Folkestone Electricity Works, called\nupon me and gave me an account of some remarkable and\ninexplicable disturbances which had been, and were then,\ntaking place in a dugout now being excavated in the garden\nof Councillor Jacques, a resident at Cheriton, near Folkestone.\nMr. Hesketh informed me that the builder of the dugout\nhad come to him for an explanation of the extraordinary\nmovement of stones and other objects in the dugout when\nno person was near them. The next day Mr. Hesketh went\nto the place, and as he describes in the introduction to the\nevidence of the different witnesses, he himself saw in the\nlate afternoon the movement of some rocks which seemed\nto be inexplicable. He therefore came to London the follow-\ning day, hoping to get some one to investigate the matter.\nAs Mr. Hesketh's account agreed with those curious\nphenomena called poltergeist disturbances, which are both\nsporadic and evanescent, I agreed to go down at once.\nAccordingly the next morning, Wednesday, November 22nd,\nI went down to Folkestone and Mr. Hesketh met me at\nShorncliffe, the nearest point to the dugout. We went to-\ngether to the place, accompanied by his secretary, who took\ndown in shorthand the evidence of the different witnesses.\nThe dugout is in a shrubbery on one side of the carriage\ndrive leading to Councillor Jacques beautiful old manor house ;\nit^ is nearly opposite the house and on the far side of the\ndrive. The plan and section of the dugout are given further\non ; there is an entrance on one side and an exit then being\nmade on the other side ; the depth and further details are\ngiven in the diagrams.\nAfter hearing the evidence of some of the witnesses, I\nentered the dugout and sat below with a couple of lighted\ncandles about an hour. Mr. Hesketh and his secretary were\noutside and saw that no one came near the entrance or exit.\nI asked the builder Mr. Rolfe to go on with his work, his\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Nothing whatever happened whilst I was there,\nbeyond the strenuous bricklaying work of Mr. Rolfe and his\nassistant. This was disappointing but not surprising, as the\nerratic natuie of these disturbances is their characteristic\nfeature, and naturally leads a hasty observer to attribute\nthem to some mischievous hmnan agency.\nSuspicion of trickery naturally centred round the lad Pen-\nfold, who assisted the builder, and on this point I made\ncareful enquiries, for, as Mr. Hesketh points out, on more\nthan one occasion, he did undoubtedly throw handfuls of\nsand. I am however satisfied that the witness Stephens,\n\u2014\nwho attributes all the disturbances to the pranks of this\nlad,\u2014is only giving expression to the hasty and ill informed\nbut natural opinion that some human agency must have been\nthe caiise. Mr. Hesketh's careful examination of this point\nis of more value than the baseless rumours which always\ncrop up in such cases.\nOn the other hand, if the cause be due, as suggested in\nthe report made by Mr. Cunningham Craig, given on p. 179,\nto the escape of natural gas from below the surface of the\nexcavated ground, my imprisonment in the dugout would\nprobably have enabled me to detect the issuing gas. But\nthere was no trace of gas or vapour, and the lighted candles\nshowed not the slightest evidence of any methane or other\ninflammable gas, although a fresh portion of the sandstone\nrock had recently been removed, and one of the candles\nwas adjacent to the uncovered face of the rocks ; nor was\nthere the least smell of any gas. Moreover, if the different\nwitnesses are to be believed, and there is no reason to doubt\ntheir word, no efflux of gas, however violent, could have\nproduced the movement of heavy rocks such as they describe ;\nor the flinging of stones or the hovering of a brick over\nthe head of the builder ; or the forcible ejection of a big\noak plank from the dugout, etc. This plank I could only\nlift with some difficulty and it would need a giant's strength\nto fling it, as Mr. Rolfe describes, from the bottom of the\ndugout 15 feet up through the exit and lodge it in the branch\nof a big shrub opposite.\n\fApril-May, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. 157\nThe evidence given independently by the different witnesses\nis familiar to those acquainted with the accounts of polter-\ngeist phenomena and is of the usual erratic, purposeless, and\ntransitory nature. The disturbances generally centre round\nsome living person, who appears to act as the medium, but\nthey are not confined to his person when once they have\nstarted, though they are limited to the special locahty where\nthey originated.\n'\nHere I would ask those who are unacquainted with this\nsubject to read the description I have given of \" Poltergeists\nOld and New,\" in a paper read before the S.P.R. on January\n31st, 1911, which is printed in the Proceedings of the S.P.R.\n,\nVol. XXV.. p. 377, et seq. The word poltergeist has no exact\nEnglish equivalent, though usually translated Hobgoblin ;\na polterer is a boisterous fellow, and a poltergeist a boisterous\nghost. The phenomena can be traced back to a remote\nperiod and occur in all parts of the world. The most\nnotable historical case is the \" Drummer or Demon of Ted-\nworth,\" in 1661, which, with the numerous sworn depositions\nof the witnesses, is fully described in Rev. J. Glanvil's\nSaducismus Triumphatus, published a few years later. G-lanvil\nwas one of the earliest Fellows of the Royal Society, and\nMr. Lecky describes him as \"a man of incomparable ability,\"\nand that \" it would be difiicult to find a work displaying\nless of credulity and superstition than this treatise.\" This\nrefers to Glanvil's Vanity of Dogmatizing, a book I would\ncommend to all those who think their own dogmatic asser-\ntions, and ignorant denials, are of more value than any\nevidence of trustworthy witnesses concerning phenomena out-\nside the usual experience of mankind.\nIt is only necessary to point out that all progress in\nscientific research would be arrested if we declined to admit\nor investigate phenomena,\u2014-such for example as the properties\nof radium, \u2014-which were whoUy foreign to our recognised\nknowledge at the time. It is obvious that all known causes\nmust first be eliminated, before we can admit the existence\nof some unknown cause.

Hesketh, M.I.E.E.\nMy introduction to this experience took place on Sunday, 18th\nNovember, 1917, when I received a visit from a Mr. Rolfe, who\nexplained he had called on me to see if I could give any\nelectrical or other satisfactory reason for some remarkable occur-\nrences which were taking place at a piece of work he was carrying\nout at Cheriton.\nHe described briefly that he was a builder and had been com-\nmissioned by Councillor Jacques to sink a dugout in his grounds\nat Enbrook Manor, with a view to affording shelter from enemy\nair attacks ; that whilst doing this he had, substantially from\nthe beginning of such work, been subjected by some unseen\nagency or force to a practically continuous series of interruptions.\nThese interruptions took the form of objects, such as sand,\nbricks and rocks, being thrown at him with varying degrees\nof violence from a gentle rubbing contact to impacts of such\nvelocity as to inflict great pain ; on many occasions so violent\nhad been the blows he had had that his flesh was bruised and\ncut, with actual loss of blood.\nIn addition this interfering force had persistently extinguished\nhis candles and, in short, become such a general nuisance that\nit was only with the greatest difficulty he could continue his\nwork.\n\" Can you,\" asked Mr. Rolfe, \" explain the cause of this ?\nAm I magnetised, or are there leakages of electricity in this\npart enough to account for it ?\n\"\nDuring the course of this exposition, which was much more\nvoluminous and detailed than the general indication I have\ngiven, I noticed a not unnatural hesitation in the recital, for,\nas I afterwards learnt, Mr. Rolfe was by no means an ignorant\n\fApril-Mat, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. 159\nman, and was conscious that the questions he put to me were\nalready from every \" common sense \" point of view answered\n:\nhe could see that I doubted the reality of his experiences, and,\nas a fact, I was under an initial impression that he was suffering\nfrom nerve shock, and that the simplest and most satisfactory\nexplanation of the case was that nerve stress due to the war\nhad built, out of the realms of fancy, upon trifling every day\nhappenings, this elaborate structure.\nSuch a prima-facie view was the more excusable, as one of\nmy own workmen had, only a few weeks before, been in a\nlocal attack by enemy aircraft, and, after a week's absence to\nrecover from the shock, had assured me that he would have\nbeen back before save that a large \" Steam Roller had been\non his chest and that none of his fellow workmen would help\nhim to lift it off.\"\nThe similarity between Mr. Rolfe the builder's tale and other\nexperiences I had heard of, and read of, and which had an\noccult basis, was however too evident to be lightly dismissed,\nand it was agreed I would call the following morning, and see\nif a satisfactory theory could be fitted to the case. The next\nmorning therefore I visited the site at about 11, and was met\nby Mr. Rolfe, who showed me round.\nThe Manor House itself is of great age ; it is referred to in\nold documents as being in existence about the year 1300, though\nsince this date several additions and remodellings have obviously\ntaken place; still there remains sufl&cient of the historic structure\n(such as the old oak panelling and main stone arches) to add\nan aesthetic value to what is undoubtedly a charming old style\ndwelling.\nThe dugout is being built below ground outside the house\nand some 25 yards away. Advantage had been taken of the fact\nthat the ground level of the carriage drive is some feet lower\nthan that of the main garden, where are the green-houses, to\nmake the entrance steps strike downwards from the lower level,\nand by excavating the dugout proper under the raised garden\nto so gain an additional thickness of roof. A rough plan and\nsection of the structure will be found on the next page.\nThe work at the time of this first visit was partly completed\nand had been in progress some weeks. The entrance steps were\nfinished in red bricks on edge, and the 4^ 'inch wall of the dug-\nout proper had been nearly completed. The bricklayer (Rolfe)\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April-Mat, 1918.\nwas working at the end nearest the exit, that end being newly\nexcavated from the natural soil, which had, so far as my examin-\nation would show, not previously been touched by the hand\nof man.

This was a precaution taken by the builder to\nprevent the loose rocks from the recess playing further pranks\nat the builder's expense. Similarly a strong canvas curtain\n\fApril-Mat, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. KJl\nwas suspended in front of that end of the dugout where the\nrough earth face had not yet been bricked in. In addition,\nrough doors had been fixed at the entrance and exit : in short,\nthe mise en scene supported his previous recital that he regarded\nhimself as being literally in a state of siege. The building up\nof his surroundings, to my mind, would also have added to\nany hallucinations he was subjecting himself to. and this I was\ncareful to keep in mind.\nMr. Rolfe reported that so far that morning things had been\nquiet; only a few stones thrown at the protecting boards, and\nat my suggestion he resumed his work with an injunction from\nme to forget as far as possible that I was there. I then took\nup my position inside the dugout, and, seated on a box, awaited\nfurther enlightenment. -\nThe lad (Penfold) who was and had been working ^vith him\nhad been caught in the act of throwing a handful of sand on\na previous occasion, and had admitted having done so on two\nother days when the genuine evidences were not forthcoming,\nso it is not to be wondered at that I selected such a point\nof %'iew that Master Penfold should not be able to assist illicitly\nin the demonstration.\nUp to 12.30, the only evidences obtained Avere of a very\nquestionable nature, and took the shape of two stones thrown\nrather lightly upon the outside of the wooden shutter protecting\nthe exit ; their effect on my mind, supported by the fact that\nRolfe exclaimed, \" They're beginning,\" was to intensify the\nview that excessive nerve stimulation was the root of the whole\ntrouble, and I left the site at about 12. .30, promising to return\nabout 3.30 that afternoon.\nOn my second appearance, at the time promised, I found\nRolfe in a very excited state, satisfaction and regret struggling\nfor mastery. Only half an hour before I arrived the manifesta-\ntions had been great\u2014in fact the unknown had made up for\nloss of time by hurling some ten or twelve large rocks down\nthe entrance stairs : there were the stones in evidence.\nAs a matter of fact they did support the statement, for in\ntheir violence they had considerably damaged the brickwork,\nand I could hardly imagine the boy, and cei-tainly not Rolfe,\nhaving so little regard for the work they had just finished as\nto negligently damage it in an effort to produce evidence, for\nit seemed to me they would have placed or thrown the rocks\nA 2\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apkil-May.-iois.\nmore carefully. So again I took up my position inside while\nRolfe and the lad Penfold resumed their work.\nNothing whatever abnormal occurred, and again I was led\nto believe that my more stable mind was having a controlling\neffect on an overstrained one.\nAt about 4.15 the bricklaying came to an end for the time\nbeing, and it was necessary for the two workers to go above to\nsaw a railway sleejjer in two. Rolfe opined that it would be\nunlikely anything further would happen that day, and asked\nif I would care to remain alone, or end my watching for the\ntime being.\nAs I exjjressed a desire to remain, and as dark was falling,\na third candle was lighted and the boy and Rolfe left the dug-\nout by the entrance stairs. I noticed, as had been explained\nto me the previous day, that they did not spend longer in\ngetting up the steps than was necessary ; the lad assisting his\nfeet by his hands and going up on all fours, and Rolfe Avas\nfollowing about a yard behind.\nI was standing at the bottom of the steps inside the return,\nfrom which I could not see the boy, but as Rolfe mounted\nthe first step a piece of rock about 3| inches across its largest\ndiameter struck him violently on the left hand and fell on the\nground close to me. Rolfe stopped and returned to show me\nthe bruise, and I picked up the stone. The boy meanwhile had\ngone up to the top and was presumably some distance away,\nfor though I called him he did not reply. I examined the\ndamaged hand and saw the blood come through the bruised skin\nand the drops fall to the groiind. Rolfe assured me this was\na mere nothing, and was glad it had occurred.\nHe was on the point of resuming his ascent when three large\nrocks (of about 12 to 15 inches largest diameter) were hurled\nin rapid succession against the bottom of the wall at the foot\nof the steps.\nI immediately rushed up to the top in the hope of catching\nthe lad in the guilt}' act, for I had noticed that the rocks were\nthrown cleanly against the bottom wall and had not touched\nthe sides or steps on their way, but no one was visible, nor\nwas there any sound of retreating footsteps. In response to my\ncall for Penfold, his voice was heard from a building some distance\naway, and he came forward to see what was the matter, apparently\nquite unconscious of the three rocks having been thrown.\n\fApiul-May, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. 163\nIn reply to my questions he stated that he felt the first stone\n(which struck Rolfe's hand) pass over his back, and though I\nat first was under the impression that he had flicked it oiJ the\nsteps, as he preceded Rolfe up the stairs, I felt bound to place\na certain degree of credence in his tale : a reconstruction of the\npositions supported his statement rather than my initial view.\nNothing further occurred that evening, and as I was driven\nto the conclusion that there might be, after all, some truth\nin the tale told me, and that possibly some supernormal force\nwas evidencing itself, I considered I should not be doing my\nduty to science if I failed to bring the case before those better\nqualified than I to elucidate it.\nOn the following day I therefore went to London and among\nothers saw Sir William Barrett, who agreed to visit the dugout\non the next day, Wednesday. Sir William came down and we\ntogether cross-examined the witnesses and got some of the state-\nments which I incorporate with this. To my own experience\nI attach little importance as evidence. It undoubtedly could\nhave been the act of trickery, but taking all the facts into\naccount I do not think that it was.\nIt is not to be wondered at that the tale of the \" Happen-\nings \" quickly got into the papers. Many w^ere the attempts\nto explain the mystery, and the one most readily received, and\nwhich appeared to give the greatest satisfaction was that the\nwhole thing was bunkum.\" Others solved it to their entire\nsatisfaction as being the work of German spies, who were pre-\nsumably burrowing imder England with a view of blowing it\nout of the water.\nMining engineers from the local coal-fields advanced the theory\nof gas (as does Mr. Cunningham Craig) and strata pressures,\nbut adiuitted they could see no reason for a suction drawing\nindividual bricks downwards, nor why a heavy crowbar should\nbe blown out of the dugout in preference to more bulky and\nless heavy objects which were there at the time.\nThe lad Penfold was thought to be the culprit :\n\" Get rid\nof the boy and all your spooks will vanish.\" In fact, the local\nnewspaper published an explanation based on a statement made\nby a near-by military tailor which warranted investigation ;\nso,\naccompanied by my stenographer, I called on him. \u2022\nMr. Stephens was very willing to give his statement, and\ndid so in a highly dramatic and indeed terrifying manner. It\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Rei^earch. April-May, 191S.\nis puUislied along with the others. Though I am satisfied,\nfrom the manner of his recounting it, that he succeeded in\nabsolutely intimidating the hoy, there is no doubt that the\nlad did throw the handful of sand, as stated, for he has admitted\nthe same to me. Stephens had so obviously set out to prove\nhim the culprit and catch him in the act, that the lad could\nnot refrain from accepting the challenge thrown him and attempt-\ning to hold his own ; he was annoyed at the attitude of this\ndoubting outsider and would pit his wits against him and \" get\na bit of his own back.\" It is interesting in view of Stephens'\nsatisfaction, to note that even he has to admit there is \" some-\nthing funny \" about the place, and that sand thrown does not\nbehave as it ought to.\nUnfortunately pressure of business, and an indisposition that\nhas kept me indoors, has prevented my devoting more time to\nthe case than sufficed to keep in touch with the witnesses and\nto collect their statements.\nThe following accounts of what they witnessed, by Mr.\nJacques, Mr. Rolfe, F. Penfold, Miss Thomas, Mr. Cummins\nand Mr. Stephens, were taken down from their lips in short-\nhand under Mr. Hesketh's superintendence, for the most part\nia November, 1917, and were signed as correct early in March,\n1918, except that of Mr. Cummins, w^liicli was signed on\nDecember 4th, 1917. . . . .\nStatement of Mr. Jacques, the owner of Enbrook Manor\nHouse, Cheriton, Folkestone.\nMr. Rolfe, the builder of a dugout in my garden, had com-\nplained to me almost daily that he was troubled with sand\nand stones hitting him whilst at work. I attached little im-\nportance to this, as I thought it miglit be due to some natural\ncause, such as the air acting on the newly exposed stone. On\nthe 2nd November (4 weeks yesterday) I went to lunch about\n1 p.m. I did not call at my house, but went straight down\ninto the dugout to inspect what the builder had been doing\nin the previous two or three days. There was no one present,\nas both Rolfe and his assistant were at dinner. I am quite\npositive on this point that no person was in the dugout at the\nsame time as myself, above or below ground. I remained there\nsome 10 to 12 minutes inspecting the work and then came away.\n\fApkil-May, 1918. Tlie Folkestone Poltergeist. 165\nI closed the door at the bottom of the steps, and before taking\nmy hand from the latch a stone came violently into contact\nwith the inside of the door, and immediately afterwards three\nothers in quick succession. I was somewhat startled, and did not\nmove for a few seconds. I then cautiously proceeded to push\nthe door open. Immediately another stone struck the door\nviolently, so that I again closed it. In quick succession from\nseven to ten stones struck the wall adjacent to the door, and\nalso the door itself, and after waiting probably half a minute\nto a minute, one single stone hit the door. I waited probably\na minute and then cautiously pushed the door open and found\nthe stones I had heard, deposited immediately behind the door.\nAs I pushed the door open the stones had to be pushed along\nthe ground at the back of the door. I went into the dugout\nagain and satisfied myself that no person was near.\nThe stones I found varied in size from that of an orange\nto double that size. I then went to my house and on entering\nwas informed by the housekeeper that Eolfe on leaving to go\nto his dinner had called and left the message that I had perhaps\nbetter not go into the dugout, as stones were flying about. This\nmessage of course I did not receive until after the occurrence\nabove described.\n[To this statement is appended :]\nThe accompanying is a correct report on the statement made\nby me on the 1st December, 1917. (Signed) R. P. Jacques.\nStatement of Frebebick Wm. Eolfe, of 27 Quested Eoad,\nChsriton, Folkestone.\nThe trouble started when the work began (about seven weeks\nago). First of all little spurts of sand coming from nowhere\nin particular would put the candle out, etc. A small cardboard\nbox with an aperture I made, but whichever way I stood it\nthe sand got in through the hole and put out the candle. The\nfollowing week stones began to fly about and I was repeatedly\nhit (particularly on the head). The boy was often standing\nquite close to me but was never hit. They invariably came\nat the back. I have repeatedly examined the face of the ex-\ncavations but could not find where the stones came from. I\nhave had bruises all over, and several times my head has been\ncut and bleeding. Wlien we started to form the recess in the\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil-May, 1918.\nsouth side a terrific volume of stones from this recess started\nand continued for a day and a half. To save ourselves I made\na big door and blocked the opening completely up, and to secure\nthe door there I laid a heap of stones against the bottom, and\nput struts against the top. That afternoon after we had laid\nthe stones there I suddenly felt one just touch my leg, and on\nlooking down saw it was one of the stones which I had laid\nagainst the door in the morning. It weighed about 10 to\n12 lbs. That was immediately followed by three or four which\nsimply touched my leg gently and fell down at my feet. Shortly\nafter came a volley of stones of all sizes which struck against\na curtain I had suspended to protect myself, and as some came\nover this curtain and knocked it down, the boy and I hurried\nout through the exit hole. The boy ran to the other end and\nwatched from there.\nWhen we looked round the dugout after the volley had stojjped,\nI found that the whole of the stones I had placed at the foot\nof the door had been moved and were lying against the wall at\nthe eastern end (some 8 feet away).\nNext day as I was standing in the dugout the bricks on the\nfloor began to rise and pitch against the wall at which I was\nat work, again driving me away from it. I had to leave the\nwork inside the dugout on that day as the discharge of stones\nwas too disconcerting. This was in the afternoon about 3 o'clock.\nI started to work in the exit hole, and a large stone fell\ndown just missing my head. I accused the boy of dropping\nthis, but he stated he had done nothing. A few minutes after\nhe shouted \"Look out,\" and as I sprang inside the dug-out, down\ncame a large rock that I could only lift with my two hands.\nHe told me he actually saw this rock try to lift from the ground\nan inch or two, drop back again, and then rise up and come\nover into the hole. The boy is not frightened, but seems amused\nwith the happenings so long as he is not close beside me.\nOn Monday 19th I began work again, and whilst facing towards\nthe exit hole near where the boy was standing, a stone struck\nme on the right side of my ear, which was the side away from\nthe boy and the hole. It made the ear bleed and caused a large\nbruise. I have several times had to go to the house to bathe\nmy head when stones have cut it, and once had to go to the\nchemist's owing to the puffs of sand that had struck my\neyes.\n\fAPBiLrMAY, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. 167\nOn Saturday about 4, directly the boy came down we heard\na terrific crash and something sprang up and hit the ceiling\nand fell just opposite our feet. On examining it we found a\nstone weighing about 15 lbs. We ran up top and no one was\nthere. On Tuesday afternoon I was standing at the top of\nthe exit hole hauling up stones from below and the boy was\nat the bottom loading up the pail. A piece of oak skirting\nsuddenly came up out of the hole, and a few minutes after\na long oak beam came up, and on hearing the boy shout I was\njust in time to see it stick into the shrub opposite. This beam\nwas too heavy for the boy to throw up in the instant my\nback was turned. Immediately afterwards the ladder which\nwas lying up the exit hole was lifted up a bit and turned over\non its side.\nThe dugout is to be used after the war as a coal cellar and\nwine store. The soil is sandstone and sand in stratas, whilst\nthe floor of the dugout is some 17 feet below the overhead\nground level.\nOn Monday afternoon, 19th instant, the boy brought d-own\nsome fresh bricks on a board. We heard a crash downstairs\nafter he had come up on the top, and on going down we found\na brick had gone from one end of the dugout (at F on plan,\np. 160) to the other (17 feet) and struck the stove bottom at\nthe other end, which was standing against the stove in the corner.\nThe mark it made on the iron is still visible. No one what-\never was in the dugout, and the brick lay at the bottom of\nthe stove bottom. The further the bricks and stones travel\nthe more force they seem to gather, and on another day the\nrock strata in the recess [at about E in the plan, p. 160, but the\nrecess was then unfinished] about 4 feet from the floor broke a^way\nof its own accord, flew to the end of the dugout and smashed\na cast-iron stove [at Gr, see plan, p. 160] and stove pipe. These\narticles were protected from the rock in the recess by the brick-\nwork at the edge of the recess, and it is impossible for the rock\nto have gone straight from the recess to the stove. We picked\nup a barrow load of stone from around the stove, and the next\nday when we started work there was a further barrow load \u2022\nof\nstones round the entrance to the dugout beside the stove. On\nthe stove are visible the marks where' it was hit. This was about\na fortnight ago. ^ ' .\nAnother day we had two candles alight, and hearing a double\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil-May, 1918.\nhiss the candles went out. This happened five times in all and\neach time we found the sand adhering to the candles and sand\nwas also all round them. We then got two glasses from the\nhouse and stood the candles in them and shortly afterwards\nwe heard the same hissing noise, but the candles did not go\nout, although sand was found in the bottom of the glasses when\nwe looked. I said, \" Now we've done them alright,\" when in-\nstantly the jars were both knocked off by two stones which came\nfrom nowhere apparently. The funny thing was that they both\nwent down at the same instant, and not one after the other.\nOn Monday I was standing in the dugout with my head close\nto the ceiling and felt something like some dirt come on my\nhead. I asked the boy what was on my head, at the same time\nputting up my hand to brush it away, and he roared vdth\nlaughter as he said a brick was hovering there. As my hand\ngot near it, it fell down and dropped on the ground near my\nfeet. The brick must have come up off the ground, as there\nwere no bricks anywhere else. The brick weighed about 10 lbs.\nThe above is a correct report of the statement made by me\non the 21st November, 1917. (Signed) F. W. Rolfe.\nMarch 7, 1918. ,\nSecond Statement by Mr. Kolfe. (28\/1\/18.)\nWhilst engaged at the dugout, small stones repeatedly flew\ntowards me whilst I was outside at the top, and I accordingly\navoided the heaps of excavated stones as much as possible.\nOn one occasion I was cutting a piece of timber, and purposely\ntook this behind the corner of the stable some 20 feet from\nthe dugout. After some 10 minutes the boy was walking towards\nme and a stone whizzed between him and the wall (just skim-\nming the side of the ivy), struck the wall behind me and dropped\nto the ground beside my feet. No heap of stones was within\n20 or 30 feet. I then went into the stable, the door of which\nwas half open, and I had just got inside when a big stone\nstruck the door with such force as to shut it. The old carman\nwas there and remarked, \" That was a near 'un.\" The boy was\nroimd the corner where I had been sawing.\nWhen I commenced to finish the brickwork in the recess,\nthe second day the candles started going out and little pieces\nof stone to fly about, as before. We had a fresh load of bricks\n\fApril-Mat, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. 169\nin, wliicli were put in a heap at the top near the entrance.\nThe boy was coming down with an armful of the old bricks,\nwhen we heard a thud, and he shouted out that a brick had\ncome down off the heap at the top. At intervals several more\nof these new bricks came over. We had just got all the bricks\ndown below when the boy came rushing in from the bottom\nof the dugout steps limping and shouting out that his leg was\nbroken. I rushed out and saw a large rock which had come\ndown and struck against his foot. It wanted two hands to lift^\nit, and if it had hit him fairly it would have smashed him up.\nAs it was he had some bad bruises for several days.\n^Vhen I had finished bricking up the hole and levelled the\nbottom, I went for Mr. Jacques to come and have a look round.\n\"When .1 came in with him the whole of the top row of bricks\nhad been pushed oii on to the floor. The bricks had been\ncemented in for some 12 hours. I do not think there is the\nslightest suspicion that the boy went down and did this in the\nshort time I was going over to the house, as by this date he\nwas getting a bit nervous, and would not go down unless some-\none was there.\nThe day before I finished work I went to get the floor\nstraightened up, starting about 8 o'clock a.m. The club hammer\n(weighing about 6 lbs.) was then lying on the floor. I put this\nhammer round the exit place, and laid it against the wall at\nthe top of the steps. I went back and took hold of the shovel\nto get the earth up, and within a minute I heard a little thud\non the earth beside me. I looked down and there was the hammer\nat my feet again. It seemed to hit the ground very lightly,\nand despite its weight made hardly any noise. I asked the boy,\nwho was working alongside me, to take it right out as it was\nbecoming a nuisance. He took it out and came back and told\nme he had put it at the bottom of the entrance round the\ncorner, and whilst he was telling me I just caught sight of it\nsettling down beside me again, just as a bird would settle down.\nI told him to take it away farther, and he came back and told\nme he had put it over beside the stable, but hardly had he\ntold me when it was back at my feet again, so we left it there.\nThe same da}^ I was standing at the corner of the recess\nand told the boy to take away the broken stove pipe, so that\nwe could take the stove up. He said, \" Why, you don't think\nthe stove will jump about.'\" I was about to tell him I wasn't\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. april-May, 1918.\ngoing to leave anything to cliance when he said, \" What's that.\"\nI turned round quickly, and the stove was then standing on the\nground close behind me. This stove weighed anything up to\na hundredweight, but settled down so gently that I never heard\nit ; but the boy's ears were apparently sharper than mine.\nI found towards the end of the work that nothing seemed to\nhappen when any stranger was there, and so I persuaded an\nold chap from Cheriton to come up and sit up there with us,\nand by this means I was able to push ahead and get the work\ndone.\nI concreted the floor one day, and the next morning, as it\nwas set, went down and began to float the surface with cement\nand sand. I had finished off about a couple of square yards\nand levelled it up, when suddenly a rush of beach stones came\nfrom behind me and spread out completely over the surface\nI had just finished. I shouted to the boy to come down with\na pail and we picked them all off. I then smoothed it up\nagain when another rush of stones came. The stones were the\nbeach stones out of the nearly set concrete behind me, and\nhad the cement adhering to them when we picked them up,\nso there was no doubt at all where they had come from. We\nthen got a sheet and covered over the piece I had not faced\nup, but for a third time a rush came, and these must have\ncome out imder the edges of the sheet. They were on each\noccasion spread over the whole surface of what I had levelled\nup, and not on a patch as would have happened had anyone\nthrown them. I was all alone in the dugout, and the boy was\noutside. After the third time I sent down again and \"ot the\nold man to come and did not do any more till he came, and\nwhen he arrived I had no farther interruptions and was able\nto finish the work. I might mention I sent for him early in\nthe morning as I was starting, but he sent up a message that he\nhad a chapter to read before he could come out, but would\ncome up later. ..... .\n\u2022\n.\n\u2022\nThe above is a correct report of the statement made by me\non the 28th January, 1918. (Signed) F. W. Eolfe.\nMarch 7, 1918. '\n.\n\fApril-May. 1918. The Folkestove Poltergeist. 171\nStatement of Frederick Wm. Reginald Penfold, of Fairview\nCottages, Peane, Nr. Folkestone, a Country Lad of about\n16, WORKING with THE BuiLDER : \u2022 \u2022\nThe beginning was when the hole was first dug, when sand\nIjegan to drop to the bottom. Mr. Rolfe accused me of pushing\nit down the hole, and after a second lot dropped on him and\nalso a stone,\" I assured him that I had not touched it, and we\ncleared everything well away from the top. Nothing else happened\nuntil the brickwork was nearly finished. Then whilst I was\ndown below Mr. Rolfe asked me to pick up a rock lying out\nin the middle of the floor, but as I stooped to pick it up it\nflew up and struck the wall beside him. Next, when picking\nup the rocks from where the brickwork was to come we laid\nthem against a door. Mr. Rolfe by this time had got so sick\nof everything jumping up and hitting him that he had sus-\npended a curtain from the ceiling to protect himself as we was\nworking behind it. Whilst I was outside the curtain one day,\nI saw some of the rocks come up from the heap and hit against\nthe curtain, and after one or two had hit the curtain a large\none landed on top of it and brought it down altogether. We\nthen hurried out of the dugout altogether to see if anything\nelse happened, but there was nothing further happened. The\ncurtain was again put up, and before it was properly up another\nstone knocked it down. Mr. Jacques was told about this and\nthe rocks were re-laid in their original position at the exit.\nOn Monday, 19th November, Mr. Rolfe asked me what was\n-on his head, and 1 told him it was a brick, at the same time\nteUing him how funny it looked. He put his hand to his head,\n^nd as he did so the brick fell on the ground.\nOn another occasion the sand began to fly about in little\npuffs and the candles were put out five times running with a\nliissing noise, and when we went to light the candles again the\nsand was each time still on them. We put them in glass jars\nand at the next hissing noise some sand went down into the\njars but did not put them out. Mr. Rolfe said, \" We've done\nthem this time,\" when immediately two stones came and knocked\nthe jars off at the same second. We lit them both again, and\none of them seemed as though it was bodily swept off and it\niell to the ground. The other was protected by a brick and was\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. apkil-May, 1918.\non a niche just above Mr. Rolfe's shoulder. In this case the\nbrick lightly struck Mr. Rolfe and the candle went out.\nThe next day Mr. Rolfe was again struck by a stone and\ncame out of the dugout, but as he was going up the ladder\na brick hit him lightly on the calf, and this brick must have\ncome up from the bottom of the dugout as there were no bricks\nat the top.\nAnother day I was in the dugout and saw quite a lot of\nbricks coming up from the floor and move quickly round the\ndagout, and this time Mr. Rolfe called the cook who came over\nand saw the bricks come up from the ground.\nOn Tuesday afternoon Mr. Rolfe told Mr. Jacques he had\nleft some stones out specially to show him. Mr. Jacques how-\never told him he had better get them all right outside the dug-\nout, and I stood at the bottom of the exit hole and loaded\nup the pail, whilst Mr. Rolfe stood at the top and pulled them\nout. Whilst he was doing this I saw a piece of oak skirting,\nwhich was at the bottom beside me, just disappearing over the\ntop of the hole beside Mr. Rolfe. There was an oak beam\nweighing about 30 lbs. standing beside me, and I asked him\nwhether I should take this away, but he said \" No,\" as that\nis much too heavy to be moved. As he turned away to empty\na pail I saw this beam (about 7 feet long) jumping up out of\nthe hole and shouted out \" Look out.\" He turned round just\nin time to see it fix up in the shrubs adjoining the exit. The\nbricks, etc. never seemed to go for me, but only Mr. Rolfe.\n[To this is appended :]\nThe accompanying is a correct report of the statement made\nby me on the 21st November, 1917.\n(Signed) Fred. William Penfold.\nStatement by Miss Thomas, cook to Mr. Jacques for the past\n15 YEARS OR so :\nI had heard a lot about the peculiar happenings in the dug-\nout, and about last Thursday or Friday I was walking round\nthe front of the house when Mr. Rolfe called out to me that\n\" They were at it again.\" I hurried over and stood at the\ntop on the ground. Mr. Rolfe was on a ladder nearly at the\n\fApril-May, 1918. TJte Folkestone Poltergeist. 173\ntop, and lie called to the boy, \" Now go aud close the door and\nwe'll see what the effect is.\" The boy returned to the top, and\nlooking down under the ladder on the ground at the bottom of\nthe exit to the dugout I saw some bricks there begin to jump\nabout and bump against one another and several seemed to\nfly towards the ladder. One in particular jumped uj) the ladder\ntowards Mr. Eolfe and fell back and was broken to pieces. The\nnumber of bricks on the move that I saw I should think was\nbetween three and five. They were all going just as if they\nwere having a lark together. I am quite certain that no one\ncould be touching the bricks. In fact I do not see how a man\ncould have made all the bricks move as they did, unless he had\na lot of extra hands ;\nparticularly as they were under the ladder.\nThis was at about 2.30 p.m., but they seem to happen at any\ntime, as on several occasions Mr. Eolfe has come in for water\nto bathe his head which Avas cut, and I have also felt bumps\non his head on several occasions. On one day I remember he\ncould not get his coat on owing to damage caused to himself.\nSeveral times he has given up work down there, as he felt he\ncouldn't go on with the interruptions.\n[To this is appended :]\nThe accompanying is a correct report of the statement made by\nme on the 21st November, 1917.\n^gigned) C.

Of course I didn't believe\nanything about it, and thought he had Bats in his Belfrey.\"\nAnyhow, as he persisted it was true, I told him I would like\nto visit the dugout, and see something for myself. On Monday,\n19th November, 1917, at about 2 o'clock, we had a look at the\nexternal portions of the dugout, and saw the stones he had\nremoved, which stood in a heap some feet away from the top\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April-May, 1918.\nof the steps. After a few minutes we went down the steps,\nand after we were down about three steps a stone fell down\nthe steps behind me. This stone just trickled down and stopped\non about the third or fourth step close to my feet. There was\nno one at the top behind me. We stood at the bottom just\nin the dugout, and within five minutes or so a rock came down\nthe steps and hit the wall at the bottom. This rock weighed\nabout 1 lb. In about another three or four minutes another\nlarge stone of about 20 lbs. hit the wall at the bottom with\nconsiderable force, and within a few minutes more another two\nstones came down with a short interval between. We then went\nright inside the dugout, as it didn't seem very safe in the\nentrance. The stones came down with great force, and I can't\neven imagine a man throwing them with such force. Several\npieces of the brick stairs down to the dugout were knocked out\nand still remain out. I did not run up to the top to confirm\nthat no one was there, as I could see no one was in sight when\nthe first small stone fell, as I was only down a few steps. The\nboy who works with Mr. Kolfe was at the other end of the\ndugout all the time. There are some thirteen steps in all down,\nto the dugout.\nOn Tuesday, 20th November, at about 2.30, I went again\nto the dugout, and as Mr. Rolfe was in the house repairing\nhis trousers, I went down alone. The boy was at the exit end\nof the dugout, and I stood watching the candle, as Mr. Rolfe\nhad told me of the candle being blown out by blasts of sand.\nAs I was watching, a small stone of about J lb. or perhaps\nJ lb. struck me just on the hip on the opposite side to the\nside the boy was standing. I did not take much notice of this,\nbut went on watching the candle. In about a minute another\nstone struck mo in exactly the same place, and the boy said,\n\" Why they're going on to you the same as they do to Mr.\nRolfe.\" I said, \" I'm going up,\" and the boy left off his work\nand we both went up. Although the stones did not seem to\nhit me very hard, and left no mark on the flesh, the pain was\nout of proportion to what I imagined the blow ought to have\ncaused, and I felt it for some little time after.\nAlthough I thought Mr. Rolfe was romancing when he told\nme about it on Sunday, and although I was then extremely\nsceptical, after my own experiences I have now altered my\nopinion entirely.\n\fApril-May, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. 175\nMr. Eolfe did not like the idea of going on further with the\nexcavation in the \" recess \" of the dugout, as it previously had\nbeen very active with him, so as I wanted to experiment I\nobtained permission from Mr. Jacques to go on with it as a\nmatter of interest.\nOn Thursday afternoon, 22nd November, at about 2.30, I took\ndown the boarding which had been fastened up in front of the\nrecess and began work. Mr. Eolfe was working outside on the\nexit, and the boy inside with me. When I had taken down\nthe boarding I stood within a foot of the wall opposite the\nrecess, looking at the recess, and was struck a violent blow\non the back of the neck Avith sand, which came in a solid piece.\nHad this been dry material of a hard nature it would have\nknocked me out, but, being dry sand, after hitting me it\nscattered over my shoulders and down my neck.\nI have since tried the experiment of throwing similar sand,\nbut find that it is impossible to throw it in one solid lump\nas this was when it hit me. It was then that Mr. Eolfe's\ncandle attracted my attention by being put out with a fine\nshoot of sand, which came with a hissing noise. He lighted\nthis again, and I watched very carefully and it was put out\nabout a dozen times in all. Upon about three occasions the\nsand did not quite put out the candle, but on such occasions\na stone immediately knocked the candle over with a crack.\ni\\Jl this time the boy was at the opposite end of the dugout,\nright away from the candle. ^Vhilst I was watching this candle,\non several occasions I saw the spurt of sand coming from the\ndirection of the ceiling at a slight angle. I saw it when about\n9 inches away from the candle, and it looked as though it was\nshot from a pea-shooter. The ceiling in the direction this came\nfrom was timbered, and no sand could possibly have come from\nit, and the walls were also bricked in.\nSuddenly the two candles I was working with, as well as\nMr. Eolfe's candle, went out, and rocks started to fly from the\nexcavation, crashing all round, which caused us to fly for the\ndoor, which we had a little difficulty in getting open.\nNeither the boy or myself were hit. Mr. Eolfe was working\nin the exit, and so was practically outside the dugout already.\n\"V\\Tien we were all out in the carriage drive none of us wanted\nto come back again to clean up the stuff that had been pulled\nout, but after a time I went in with the boy and threw out\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. april-May. idis.\nthe excavated material. As I was throwing this out quite a\nnumber of rocks trickled across the floor into the corner. It\nwas then that we asked Mr. Jacques to come down again, but\nall activity had ceased. He waited some 20 minutes and then\nwent, and had hardly got away from the entrance to the dug-\nout when rocks started flying about again, and a piece of brick\ncame with great force and just hit my toe a glancing blow\nand then hit the dugout wall. We called him down again, and\nagain everything stopped.\nAfter getting most of the material away the boy was sitting\non the floor facing away from the recess, and I was standing\nabout a coui^lo of feet from the boy facing the recess, when a\n9 or 10 jiound rock came between us, struck the wall opposite\nand rebounded, hitting the boy's shin, causing him great pain.\nWhilst in the dugout a crowbar, 3 feet long, leaning against\nthe wall in the middle of the dugout, floated out to the open\nwhere Mr. Rolfe was standing.\nI could not help feeling that a message was being conveyed\nto me that I was not wanted there, for first of all the candles\ngoing out, and the pieces of sand hitting me ; then a stronger\nmessage in the form of small stones hitting me, and then by\nmuch larger stones coming close to me, but not quite hitting me.\nEdward Firth Cummins.\nSworn by the above named Edward Firth Cummins at\nFolkestone in the County of Kent this fourth day of\nDecember, 1917,\n'\nBefore me.

The Folkestone Poltergeist. 1 77\nand told me his nerves had absolutely gone. I asLed him to\nlet me go up right away, and after some persuasion he con-\nsented. I went up with him and had a look round, but was\nvery careful to keep the boy in front of me all the time. I\nasked him if he had ever caught the boy playing a practical\njoke of any sort and he told me he had not. I asked him\nagain if he had ever caught him in circumstances which looked\nas though he was up to some mischief, and he then told me\nhe once caught him with a handful of sand. I turned on the\nboy and said, \" Young man, you ought to know better than\nthat.\" He said, \" I didn't throw it.\" I came to the con^\nelusion I saw nothing which the boy coidd not have done. I\ntx)ld Sir. Rolfe I should like to spend a morning there with a\nfriend, and I made arrangements to go up the following morning.\nI went up, and took Mr. Nichols, the contractor, with me. I\nparticularly requested Mr. Nichols to keep his eye on the boy\nall the time he was there, and this was the real reason I wanted\nsomeone with me. I told the boy not to have any nonsense,\nand at about 10 o'clock we went down into the dugout. I\ncalled Mr. Nichols attention to the peculiar nature of the rock\nwhich in parts was light and more like pumicestone.\nMr. Rolfe pointed out the recess and told us that was where\n-all the trouble seemed to come from, and Mr. Nichols started\nto excavate, and got out about a cwt. or two. I had only\nbeen there watching for a few minutes when I got a welt behind\nthe ear with a small stone. I turned round sharp and said,\n\" What is that \" ;\nbut could see nobody who could have caused\nit. Mr. Rolfe began to get excited and said, \" That is how it\nstarts. Just like that.\" Then Mr. Nichols took my stand whilst\nI started to dig, and he at once got \" a load of stuff \" hit him.\nHe was standing just at the bottom of the opening, and ^t once\ncame running in. We both looked round and could see nothing.\nThen I heard the noise as though a man's arm was being quickly\nmoved and something came across beside me. I thought I saw\nthe boy's arm move as I turned round quickly, but was not\nquite sure. He then sat down on a heap of stones and rubbish,\nand I put the candles so that I could see the boy's shadows\nclearly. I went on digging and felt something go by me ; but\n\u2022did not see the boy do it. I then got the boy to go on with\nTthe digging, which he did until he was absolutely tired.\nI asked Rolfe to go in and have a go at it then, but he\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Aprii-Mat, 1918.\ndid not like to ;\neventually however he went down and took\nup the work. '\nThen I noticed the boy put his foot underneath the hammer\nwhich was lying on the ground, so I at once stood on the handle.\nI then had a good suspicion that the boy had a rock in his\nhands ; but I said nothing, as I thought if I waited I\nshould see something definite, and I wanted to see what would\nhappen.\nAfter Rolfe had been at work some 20 to 25 minutes, Nichols\nwent round the corner at the other end. I thought now's my\nchance, so I shouted out to Mr. Nichols, \" Where are you going\nto Charlie. You're not frightened are you.\" He said \" No. I'm\nalright. I'm not frightened.\" Then I heard him touch the\ndoor as though he was going to open it, and I said, \" Alright.\nYou go out that way and I'll go out this way.\" I made as\nif to go out the entrance, but suddenly turned and got a big\nwad of sand right in my face, which I was just in time to\nsee the boy in the attitude of throwing. I turned on him and\nhe dropped on his knees and said, \" Forgive me. I am sorry^\nNow you have found me out I will own up to it all.\" \" Not-\nwithstanding all that,\" Mr. Rolfe at once turned on me and\nsaid, \" I don't believe he has done it all.\" The boy at once\ncontradicted himself and said, \" No, I havn't done it all, only\nonce or twice.\" I said, \" We'll go through his pockets now,\nand see what else he has ready.\" But Mr. Rolfe would not, nor\nwould he take the boy up right away to Mr. Jacques for him\nto go through them, although we tried to persuade him that\nthis was what ought to be done. We told Mr. Jacques what\nhad happened, and ' our opinion that if he got rid of the boy\nnothing further would happen.\nWhilst we were at the dugout I tried throwing sand at the\nwall, and noticed something very peculiar in that when a handful\nof sand was thrown hard against the wall at the entrance it\nwould run along the wall aimed at, hit the wall adjoining in\nthe angle, and run along that for a long way, and I think this\naccounts for some of the happenings, as under these circum-\nstances the sand could be thrown in the dugout without anyone\nthrowing it in a direct line.\nThe above is a correct rejjort of the statement made by me on\nthe 8th December, 1917. (Signed) W. H. Stephens.\n2nd March, 1918.\n\fApkil-Mat, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. 179\nReport to Sir Boverton Redwood, Bart., D.T.I, (oe H.M.\nPetroleum Executive), on Phenomena at Enbrook Manor,\nCheriton, by Mr. E. H. Cunningham Craig.\nOn the 10th inst. I proceeded to Enbrook Manor to inv^esti-\ngate the phenomena to which Lieut. -Colonel Todhunter had\ncalled attention, and this report deals with the evidence obtained.\nIt will be recollected that the occurrences had attracted some\nnotice in the daily press, and the accounts of eye-witnesses\nwere given at length.\nThe facts are as foUows :\nA dugout was being made in the grounds of the Manor, and\nafter a certain depth had been reached stones were thrown about\nviolently for no reason that the workmen could discover, occasion-\nally inflicting injuries upon them.\nSupernatural agencies were suggested, and both Sir Conan\nDoyle and Sir W. F. Barrett have visited the dugout, though\nno statement as to what conclusion they arrived at has been made.\nLieut. -Colonel Todhunter suggested that the phenomena might\nbe due to an evolution of natural gas, and consequently I under-\ntook at your suggestion to investigate the matter.\nI was accompanied by Major A. de Boissiere of the British\nWest Indies Regiment, as a second observer might have been\nnecessary.\nThe dugout and the surrounding ground were carefuUy in-\nspected, and the builder and his assistant cross-examined, and\nasked to show exactly what had taken place on diiJerent occasions.\nThe dugout has a cover of only nine feet and the surrounding\nground, though not actually flat, shows only small minor undu-\nlations. The possibility of the phenomena being due to the\neffect of unequal pressure must therefore be eliminated.\n[A sketch plan of dugout was here inserted^ showing the\nalcove as the position from which most of the stones were\nprojected. This plan is not reproduced, as the one on p. 160\nserves the purpose.]\nThe strata, as far as I could ascertain, belong to the Sand-\ngate beds or Folkestone beds, sub-groups of the lower green-\nsand beneath the Gault. There is a general dip to the north-\nnorth-east, but the strata are almost horizontal at this locality,\nwhich lies on the northern flank of the great Weald anticline.\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil-Mat, 1918.\nThe strata cut through consist of coarse lightly compacted\nsand with thin hard calcareous bands at frequent intervals.\nIt was after, and while, cutting through one of these hard bands,\nnow about two feet above the floor that the phenomena were\nnoticed. Pieces of the hard band were projected ^'iolently, some-\ntimes striking the brickwalls and making distinct abrasions.\nSand also was discharged with some violence, and is said to have\nextinguished the naked candles, by the light of which the work\nwas being done.\nThe accounts of these phenomena given by the builder and\nhis assistant have been repeated many times to newspaper\nreporters and other persons, and have quite naturally become\ngradually embellished with picturesque details not strictly accurate,\nbut j)robably firmly believed by the raconteurs.\nIt is admitted, however, that in the morning on beginning work\nafter the dugout had been shut up all night, the violent discharge\nof stones and sand was more in evidence than after some hours\nof work.\nAt the time of my visit the dugout was practically finished,\nthe floor, which had been flooded during a rainstorm, had been\npuddled and was stamped firm and flat. Only in the alcove\nwere the strata seen, and there were no manifestations of\nactivity.\nAll the statements made that could be verified point to the\noccurrence of natural gas, which, possibly ascending gradually\nfrom a considerable depth has accumulated beneath the hard\nand impervious bands of rock. The discharge of comparatively\n> small quantities of gas would probably be quite sufficient to\ncause most of the phenomena described, but it is more probable\nthat slight explosions, not necessarily accompanied by any loud\nsound or well-marked flame, may have taken place also.\nThe gas, being no doubt chiefly methane, would not betray\nits presence by odour, and an explosion in the absence of any-\nthing like coal-dust would hardly be visible as flame.\nThere seemed to be slight traces of gas still left in crannies\nat the entrance to the alcove.\nThe occurrence of natural gas in such strata is by no means\nextraordinary. The structure is anticlinal, and not many miles\naway, at Heathfield, natural gas has been struck in a well, drilled,\nit is true, somewhat nearer to the crest of the anticline and\npenetrating into rather older strata.\n\fApeil-May, 1918. The Folkestone Poltergeist. 181\nIt is unlikely that any great evolution of gas will take place\nagain unless the dugout be deepened, but it is quite possible\nthat a little may collect gxadually, and unless the dugout be\nkept well ventilated \u2014a very simple matter OAving to the two\nentrances\u2014it might be dangerous to enter it with a naked light\nafter it had been left shut up and undisturbed for some\ntime.\nIt is suggested that the owner, Mr. Jacques, should be warned\nof this possibility.\n(Sgnd.) E. H. Cunningham Craig.\nDecember 13, 1917,\nOn seeing the above statements in proof Mr. Cunningham\nCraig wrote on 28th March, 1918 :\n28th March, 1918.\nHad I known that so much interest would be taken in the\nsubject, I should have made my report much longer, and given\nfurther evidence from my notes taken at the time of my visit.\nIn the circumstances I think it as well to make my position\nquite clear.\nI am not altogether ignorant of supernormal phenomena, and\nshould be the last to scoff at accounts of occurrences that cannot\nbe explained as due to some simple and normal cause, but I take\nit that in investigations such as this it is the rule to eliminate\nthe possibility of all natural causes before claiming any phenomena\nas supernormal, if only to give no excuse to those who scoff at\nthings they do not understand.\nIn this case there were twb possible explanations, viz., pressure\nand natural gas. The former had to be rejected, as there is no\nevidence of rapid earth movement in the neighbourhood, which\nmight have placed the hard beds in the Folkestone Group under\nsevere tangential pressure.\nI obtained no conclusive proof of the presence of methane,\nhaving no vacuum bottles with me, but there certainly seemed\nto be traces of inflammable gas in crannies at the top of the\nalcove. I noticed also a slight feeling of discomfort, such as I\nhave frequently noticed in mines where the ventilation is not\ngood. I should not mention that as evidence had not my friend.\nMajor de Boissiere, remarked it also, and without any suggestion\nfrom me.\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil-Mat, 1918.\nI have no doubt that the phenomena described are in the main\nquite accurate, but there has been \" embellishment \" in some\ncases. We found both Mr. Rolfe and the boy Penfold very-\nanxious to prove that there could be no \" normal \" explanation,\nand several statements were made to us which could not be\nsubstantiated. For instance, it was stated that stones came\nround the corner from the alcove. We suggested a ricochet off\nthe brick wall, but were told that was impossible as the wall\nwould show traces. The wall being examined showed very clearly\nthe marks of glancing blows.\nMajor de Boissiere, who, though not a trained scientist, is a\nvery shrewd observer, was chiefly impressed by the mischievous\ntwinkle in the boy Penfold's eye, and I think it possible that\nhe may have \" assisted \" the phenomena.\nHowever, to cut a long story short, the phenomena, as described\nto me at the time of my visit, are quite typical of the discharge\nof natural gas. I have come across quite as remarkable instances\nbefore. The hovering brick incident was not mentioned, and when\nthe boy Penfold began to describe rocks slowly rolling over and\ncoming down into the dugout, the man Rolfe shook his head\nand stopped him, from which I gathered that he could not confirm\nhis young assistant's statements.\nThe whole question can be settled very quickly by drilling a\nhole to a depth of 20 or 30 feet at a distance of 50 or 100 yards\naway on the same line of strike. The hole should of course be\ncased, and if any gas be discharged it can be collected and\ntested.\nI should be glad to learn from Sir William Barrett something\nmore about the characteristics of poltergeists, about which I know\nnothing, except what I have read. In return I should be willing\nto tell him from my own experience something about natural gas.\n(Signed) E. H. Cunningham Craig.\n\fApril-May, 1918. Review. 183\nEEVIEW.\nThe Gate of Eememhrance. The Story of the Psychological Experi-\nment which resulted in the discovery of the Edgar Chapel\nat Glastonbury. By Frederick Bligh Bond, F.R.I.B.A. Published\nby B. H. Blackwell, Oxford.\nThis is an interesting record of automatic script whatever\nhypothesis may be adopted as to the source of the ideas it\ncontains. The writing was obtained, at intervals between Novem-\nber, 1907, and December, 1916, by two friends, the author of\nthe book and J A . J. A. held the pencil and Mr. Bond\nrested his fingers lightly on the back of J. A.'s hand. Neither\nof them followed the script as it was produced, but Mr. Bond\nseems to have deciphered it as far as possible immediately aft-=r-\nwards. The language was usually what purported to be old\nEnglish, but was sometimes Latin. The subject of Glastonbury\nAbbey was started by an initial question of Mr. Bond's, and the\nscript was all through occasionally stimulated and directed by\nquestions. Mr. Bond and his friend were both very well versed\nin Glastonbury lore and in architectural knowledge generally\n;\nand at the time the experiments began Mr. Bond was expecting\nan appointment, which he afterwards received, as Director of\nExcavations at the Abbey.\nThe portions of script quoted come under three heads. There\nare the descriptions of the Edgar Chapel at Glastonbury which\nit was desired to fi.nd and whose position and appearance were\nunknown. There were similarly descriptions of the Loretto Chapel.\nAnd there were accounts of persons and events connected with\nthe Abbey\u2014some historical and some not known to be so.\nThe statements under this last head when not known to history\ncannot be verified ; and the supposed site of the Loretto Chapel\nhas not yet been excavated, so that the accuracy of the descriptions\nremain imverifled for the present. Mr. Bond has, we think, acted\nwisely in publishing the description beforehand. But as regards\nthe Edgar Chapel there was found to be, along with some\nerror or confusion, a surprising correspondence between the site,\nplan, and dimensions as given in the scripts and the facts revealed\nby the excavations ; and there is no doubt that some of the\nmost important scripts were produced before the excavations\nwere begun. ^\nThe question naturally arises, where did this veridical informa-\ntion come from ? The scripts, as is so often the case, take a\ndramatic form and profess to be messages from definite people.\nAbbot Bere, who built both the Edgar and the Loretto Chapels,\n^ For this we have in addition to the statements of the writers themselves,\nthe testimony of our honorary secretary, Mr. Feilding, who was cognisant of\nthe experiments.\n\f184 Jotirnal of Society fm^ Psychical Research. April-May, 1918.\nsometimes writes about them and sometimes other communicators\nare named. Their knowledge of the building is not apparently\nlimited to what they knew when alive. Thus one \" Robert,\"\nwho gives his date as 1334, nearly two centuries earlier than\nthe building of the chapel, writes, \" The window [of the Abbey\nChurch] was straight as we knew it, but was somewhat changed\nby Abbot Bere when he made the chapel . .\n.\" (p. 47). And\nAbbot Bere himself appears to know about the present condition\nof unexcavated foundations. Thus he writes (p. 53), \" The cript\nis fallen in, but the clay is not the old clay. Clear out the midst\nthereof, and many fragments be there.\" And again about the\nLoretto Chapel, \"if ye digge in the wall of the navis, there\nis much fell in\" (p. 119). These and some other considerations\nseem to accord less well with a spiritualistic hypothesis than with\nwhat appears to be the provisional conclusion of Mr. Bond himself,\nnamely, that the subliminal consciousness ' of the automatists is\nresponsible for the insight shown. He says on p. 156 :\n\" Intuition has played her part. From the depths of the sub-\nconscious mind her power has evoked these images. . . . The method\nwe have chosen [i.e. the method of automatic writing] . . . claims\na double value\u2014(1) in its ability to remember and to review\nsubconsciously an infinitude of minor things, slightly or casually\nimpressed upon the mind and unnoticed or unremembered by\nthe working brain ; and (2) the faculty of balancing, assessing,\nand combining these in such a manner as the brain itself is\nrarely if ever able to do, and hence to evolve from slenderest\ndata a scheme in which all probabilities which can lawfully be\ninferred from these minutiae are welded into a complete whole.\"\nThe book is well got up and illustrated, and is likely to interest\nreaders who care about our ancient buildings, as well as students\nof automatic writing.\nSITTINGS WITH MRS. LEONARD.\nThe Sittings arranged for by the Society ended in the\nmiddle of April. It remains for the Committee, appointed\nto deal with the matter, to study and report on the results,\nbut it will probably be some considerable time before their\nreport can be ready.\n* Rather oddly \"supraliminal\" occurs several times in the book with the\nmeaning \"subliminal.''\n\fNo. CCCXLVI.\u2014Vol. XVIII.

Meeting of the Council. 187\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read\nand signed as correct.\nSeven new Members and fourteen new Associates were\nelected. Their names and addresses are given above.\nThe Monthly Accounts for March and April, 1918, were\npresented and taken as read.\nA letter was read from the Society's pul^lishers, Messrs.\nK. MacLehose & Co., calling attention to the great increase\nin the costs of paper and printing, the price of paper being\nnearly seven times the price at which it stood before the War,\nand the cost of printing being more than double. The Council\nasked the Hon. Secretary, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, to consider\nwith the Treasurer, Editor, and Secretary how this increase\nof costs could best be met.\nIt was agreed that the Eooms of the Society should be\nclosed this year on August 3rd until September 9th.\nTHE PEESONAL APPEARANCE OF THE DEPAETED\nAS DESCEIBED BY CONTROLS.\nBy Dr. L. p. Jacks.\nDescriptions of the personal appearance of \"spirits,\" which\nare of course quite common at seances, give rise, when care-\nfully examined, to some extremely interesting ijuestions, which,\nI think, would well repay careful consideration. Unless I am\nmistaken, their importance has somehow been overlooked.\nAt a recent stance at which I was present the descriptions\nof the figures, faces, dress, and general appearance of the\ncommunicating spirits was Ijoth intelligent and minute. I\ncannot say they were correct; because it was not always clear\nto whom they referred, but they were certainly such as a\ngood observer would give of a person standing before him.\nThe figure and face were well characterised point by point,\nthe height, the stoop of the shoulders, peculiarities of gait, the\nbuild of the nose and the cheekbones, the angle of the eye-\nbrows, the positiveness of the chin, etc., and in addition to\nthese obvious characters subtler and minuter points were\nintroduced, such as the texture of the skin, the expression of\nparticular features, the general look as of a man who was an\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1918.\norator, or a student, or of a woman who had suffered from\nillness ; or the tendency of a bit of hair to stick out at the\nback of the head. Age distinctions were also introduced as\nusual ; this one was about 2 2 ; that one was elderly, and\nso on.\nWhat inferences may we legitimately draw from all this ?\nI am informed that two main theories are in existence\n:\n(1) That the departed retain in their spiritual life the bodily\ncharacteristics they had in this world about the time of their\ndeparture,\u2014and this down to the details, such as the bit of\nhair sticking up at the l)ack of the head. (2) That the\nappearances as described hy the control are temporary mani-\nfestations in wliich the departed reproduce their bodily\nappearance just as we knew it here, for the special purpose\nof enabling us to recognise them. This process is called\n\" building up.\"\nI venture to think that neither of these theories will bear\nclose examination. Examining each in turn it seems to me\nthat in regard to ( 1 ) the difficulty about age alone is almost\ninsuperable. To assign a given age to a person has the\ndouble meaning that he was once younger and is no%o grovj-\ning older. To say, for example, that he is 60 means that he\nwas once 50, and will in course of time become 70\u2014that is\nif 60 has any meaning at all. What this involves is too\nobvious to need pointing out. There are, literally, hundreds\nof difficulties of a like nature, of which I will mention only\none more by way of a sample. At the seance above men-\ntioned two spirits were introduced, one of whom was described\nas having hair on his face, the other as \" clean-shaven.\" Taking\nthese two descriptions together we reach a rather odd con-\nclusion. The hairy face suggests that hair retains its growth in\nthe spirit world. How then could the other spirit remain\nclean-shaven under these conditions unless he continued to\nshave ? This is not an attempt to raise a laugh, but a\nserious difficulty. And it is typical of all the rest.\n(2) In face of these difficulties, which might be multiplied\nendlessly, we fall back on the second theory that the spirits\nreproduce themselves thus for the special purpose of obtaining\nrecognition for the time l^eing, the \" building up \" theory.\nThis theory can be accepted only if we are willing to\n\fJune, 1918. Personal Appearance of the Departed. 189\ncredit the spirits with thauinaturgic powers. Putting the\npower to work miracles aside for the moment, the matter\nwould stand somewhat as follows.\nTo reproduce their appearance in detail, as we knew it in\nthis life, the spirits must (1) have known exactly how they\nlooked to us, and (2) be able to remember this in their\npresent existence.\nBut in our earthly life none of us knows, with anything\napproaching accuracy, how he looks to other people. We\nnever see ourselves as others see us except in the vaguest\nand most inaccurate manner. Such things as the poise of\nour heads, the expression in our eyes, the \" orator like \" look,\npeculiarities of gait, the turn of the mouth, the slight droop\nof the shoulders, the air of one who has had a long illness,\nand a thousand such like things which figure in these portraits,\nsuggest the impressions we form on other people's minds, not\nany picture we have of ourselves. Still less have we the\npower of remembering how we looked to other people at long\nor short intervals afterwards. If anybody doubts this let him\ntry the experiment of describing the picture he formed, not\nin his own eyes, but in those of some other person six\nmonths ago, including such things as his expression, the suit\nof clothes he had on, the way his hair was brushed, his\ngeneral mien and carriage, the texture of his skin, etc., etc.\nHe will soon find out that to reproduce himself thus, as another\nsaw him, is precisely what he cannot do. The idea of his\nbeing able to do so is flagrantly absurd.\nBut suppose the spirits have a thaumaturgic power which\nenables them to know how they looked to other people, to\nremember it, and to reproduce it in detail\u2014impossible as this\nis under normal psychological conditions. This I should say\nproves far too much. A spirit whose memory of his past\nself, and of the impression it produced on others, enables him\nto remember that his face was lit up by a particular expression\nor such minute details as a bit of hair sticking out at the\nhach of his head, and who can miraculously reproduce all this,\nought not to get into difficulties when it comes to a question\nof spelling his own name. Yet this is what happened at the\nseance in question. All the details of his face and hair were\ngiven with the utmost minuteness, but the spelling of his\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1918.\nname seemed beyond him. Even the first letter was hesitating\nand doubtful.^\nI have examined many of these descriptions of the personal\nappearance of spirits, and the conclusion suggested to my mind,\nespecially ivhen the details are closely studied, is that they are\nnot such pictures as any person could or would form of him-\nself. Many of the details are of a kind which would not be\nseen or noted even if we suppose that the person who gives\nthem is looking at his own photograph or studying his face\nin a glass while he is speaking. On the other hand they are\njust such pictures as another person, taking an external view,\nwould have of the features, expi-ession, bearing, etc., of the\nindividual before him. They are, I believe, the sitter s picture\nof his departed friend. The sitter's mind, I am more and\nmore convinced, is the source from which they are derived.\nHow they are derived is another question. But something\ncan be gained if we can trace them to their source.\nI may perhaps illustrate my point by the following, which\nis of course a very common occurrence. A well-known man\nhad his portrait painted by a gifted artist, and all his friends\npronounced it a great success. It was exactly as we knew\nhim, as he looked to us. But when the subject himself saw\nthe finished work his remark was \" Well, I never knew I\nlooked like that!\"\n'\nIn like manner I think it could be clearly proved that the\ndescriptions to which I am referring do not represent impres-\nsions which the spirits have, or ever had, of themselves, but\nthe impressions which other j^eople had of them. As such of\ncourse they may be perfectly accurate, though the spirits them-\nselves might hardly recognise themselves under the terms given,\nand might well say \" I never knew I looked like that.\" I was\ngreatly struck by this at a certain seance at which I was the\nsitter. A spirit whom I easily recognised was introduced and\ndescribed as having the look and air of a \" good man.\" This\nwas always my impression of him in life. But it was the\n'\nIt has been suggested to me that in tliis life we seldom think of ourselves\nby our names, and may therefore easily forget them in the next life. But I\nshould say that in this life we think of our names at least as often as we do\nof the shape of our noses, which last was given, in the instance quoted,\nwithout any hesitation.\n\fJune, 1918.

Of course it may be said that he knew\nI thought of him as a good man, and remembering this in\nthe after-life, reproduced himself accordingly in order to be\nrecognised. But unfortunately he was the very one who had\nforgotten how to spell his name. His memory of the difficult\nthing and his forgetfulness of the easy one are very hard to\nreconcile.\nCASES.\nCrystal Visions.\nWe owe the following cases to Sir WiUiam Barrett, who knows\nMrs. Sahs from whom he received them. The first of the\ntwo presents the unusual and very interesting feature of\nwhat appears to have been a veridical auditory haUucination,\ninduced by a shell held to the ear, accompanying the corre-\nsponding crystal \\^sion. It is, of course, much to be regretted\nthat we cannot get fk'st-hand evidence in the case from the\npersons whose doings were perceived.\nNo. 1.\nL. 1215. March 10, 1918.\nMy friend, Miss Taylor, has been able for some years to see\nvisions in the crystal, which are often veridical. She always\nregretted not being able to hear what the \" vision people \" were\nsaying, and I decided to try an experiment suggested by a\nFrench writer and induce clairaudience by using a shell. I first\ninduced a slight hypnotic trance and suggested verbally that\nshe would be able to hear. I then woke her and told her to\nlook in the crystal.\nThe first vision that appeared was the sitting-room in the\nhouse of Mr. T. B., a friend of hers who I have never seen.\nHe was there with his brother and sister-in-law, and the room\nwas minutely described. It was evening, and the gas lighted,\nand she saw the door open and a man come in. At this moment\nI said, \" Place the shell to your ear.\" She did so, and to her\ndelight she heard the newcomer exclaim, \" There is good news\nto-night, we have taken another village.\" They then proceeded\nto talk about Mr. T. B. being called up and what arrange-\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1918.\nments he would make. Afterwards a maid came in with a tray\nof sandwiches and whisky and soda, and the vision then faded.\nFour days after, Miss Taylor went to see the B.'s and said\n\" I can tell you what you were doing on Saturday evening,\"\nand to their great astonishment did so, every detail being correct.\nI may add that the expression \" we have taken another village\n\"\nappeared as a headline in the evening paper, but neither I nor\nMiss Taylor had seen it. I have never seen the B.'s nor the\nhouse in question.\nThis was in the early spring of 1917. Mary Salis.\nI append a signed statement [from the crystal gazer].\nThe above account is exactly what occurred. The vision was\nmost distinct and the voices quite clear. I have never before\nheard any voices, though I have always wished to do so. When\nI spoke to the B.'s they were extremely surprised, as it was all\ncorrect in every detail.\ng jyj Xayior\nMarch llth, 1918.\nMrs. Salis writes :\n\" I have been trying to get Mr. and\nMrs. B. (the people described) to sign a statement, but cannot\ninduce them to do so.\" She adds : \"I have never used\nhypnotism except to induce '\nclairaudience.'

T. looked in the crystal and saw Geoffrey\nsitting in a small room. It was very simply furnished, but there\nwere a couple of armchairs, and some prints on the walls and a\nbright fire was burning. G. was alone and was reading a paper\nby the light of a lamp placed on a table by him. I asked about\nthe situation of the house, and she said it appeared to have\nmany trees near it, but it was quite dark outside. (It was just\nas if she went outside to look ! ) After a moment or two, she\nsaw G. get up, put down the paper and take up a book. He\nthen opened the door, turned out the lamp and went out,\nleaving the room in darkness. M. Salis.\nNote. 1 wrote at once to mj^ son and received a reply that\nall was correct.

Child Percipient.\nL. 1217.\nWe owe the following case to the kindness of Mrs. E. S.\nRussell, who writes :\nBryans Ground, Presteign,\nRadnorshire, March 12, 1918.\nMy sister, Mrs. W . has asked me to write you an account\nof the story she told you about my small boy.\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1918.\nUnfortunately I did not write it down at the time, so I am not\nsure as to the date, hut it was after November 4th [1917],\nperhaps several days after, though before the news of my husband's\ndeath came to us on November 16th. I think it was most\nlikely on November 8th or 9th, and my husband was killed\non November 6th.\nDicky, the small boy, was resting on my bed after limch\nand I was sitting by his side sewing, and we were not talking,\nwhen he sat up rather suddenly and said, \" Daddy is dead.\"\nI said, \" Oh no, dear, he's not and I expect he'll come back to\nus some day \" ; but Dicky looked very upset and became flushed\nand almost wept and said again, \" No he won't, Dick knows\nhe's dead.\" I just said, \" No, dear, I don't think he is,\" but\nDicky seemed so distressed and repeated, \" No, no, Dick knows\nit \" so emphatically that I thought best to leave the subject\nalone. He never referred to it again and had never said anything\nof the sort before. When we did say anything about his father\nit was always as to when he would come back and Dick's usual\nremark was that he would run and open the gate for him. It\nwas so queer of Dick that I went almost at once and told my\nsister here of it, but I had no impression at all that my husband\nwas dead, and only thought of it as odd of Dicky. Indeed we\nhad got to look upon my husband's safety as a foregone con-\nclusion, for he had been through Gallipoli, El Arish and the\nfirst battle of Gaza without a scratch.\n[Signed] Elizabeth D. Eussell.\nIn reply to questions Mrs. Eussell writes on March 16,\n1918:\n(1) Dicky was born on August 3rd. 1914 [and was therefore\naged 3^ years at the date of his impression].\n(2) I think \" dead \" does convey some meaning to him ; he\nsees hedgehogs, worms, mice and such like animals dead, and\nalways asks about them, \" Why dead, Dick wants them alive\nagain \"\u2014and he screws up his face into a half tearful state,\nmuch as he did when he made the remark about his father\n;\nonly that time he got very flushed and was much distressed.\n(3) No, I don't think it was a dream in the sense of a sleeping\ndream ; he was quiet, but awake. It gave me the idea of an\nodd freak. I think he is a child with an acute imagination and\nsensitive ; but he's essentially healthy and full of the joy of\nlife, about the happiest child we have ever come across.\n\fJune, 1918.

D. Holt, written\nfrom the same address and dated March 17, 1918, is as follows :\nI clearly recollect my sister telling me the following incident.\nShe had taken Dicky, her small son, upstairs for his after\ndinner rest\u2014the child had been lying quietly on the bed while\nshe was sewiag when suddenly he sat up and said, \" Daddy's\ndead.\" My sister said, \" Oh no, he's not, some day he will come\nback again \" ; but Dicky repeated, \" Daddy's dead, Dick Imows\nit,\" and the child appeared very distressed, so much so that\nmy sister thought it best to humour him and turn his thoughts\nto something else.\nWhen he had finished his rest, she almost at once found me\nand told me about it, but even then it never occurred to us\nthat the child's words were true.\nMy brother-in-law was killed on November 6th, 1917, and I\nfeel almost sure that it was a few days after that date that\nthis incident happened. Unfortunately neither of us made a note\nof the exact date at the time.\n[Signed] Mary D. Holt.\nThe death of Captain Edward Stanley Russell on November\n6th, 1917, v^as announced in the Times of November 20.\nIt will be observed that in this case evidence of any exact\ncoincidence is wanting ; but there is no doubt that the little\nboy's experience occurred some time before the news of his\nfather's death was received, and it is almost if not quite\ncertain that it did not occur before the death itself.\nWe have several instances in our collection of young children\nreceiving apparently telepathic impressions of events occurring\nat a distance.

In the second case a child of\nabout three said and repeated \" Davie's drowned \" on the\nday and about the hour when a young cousin David was\ndrowned while skating. Unfortunately both these cases are\nremote\u2014^the record having been made many years after the\nevent.\nIn another case, recorded within a fortnight of its occurrence,\nand printed in the Journal, Vol. VII., p. 8, the impression\ntook the form of a hallucination without the idea of death\nbeing attached to it. A little girl of five and a quarter said\nshe saw ''little Jack in that chair.\" A few minutes afterwards\ncame a telephone message announcing the death of little\nJack. For other cases see Journal, Vol. IV., p. 334, and\nVol. v., p. 61. Compare also a case in the supplement to\nPhantasms of the Living, Vol. II., p. 605, though this last is\nagain very remote.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nFolkestone Poltergeist.\nMadaim,\u2014One or two points in Mr. Cunningham Craig's report\non the Phenomena at Enbrook Manor, Cheriton, which appears in\nthe Jovrnal for April and May 1918, seem to need rather more\nexplanation, and 1 think it would be of interest if he would give\nus some further information on the behaviour of natural gas.\nThe account which be gives us of the phenomena would hardly\nseem., to the reader who is at all acquainted with natural science,\nto warrant the conclusion at which he arrives, viz. that the\nphenomena can reasonably be attributed entirely to the action of\nnatural gas.\nThe difficulty to my mind is that the results, as described by\nall the witnesses, are of so energetic a nature that natural gas\ncould hardly l)e the agent without betraying itself to the most\ncasual observer. Leaving aside the evidence of the workmen, Mr.\nCunningham Craig himself says that \"pieces of the hard band\nwere projected violently, sometimes striking the brick walls and\nmaking distinct abrasions.\" This means that very considerable\nenergy was at work. As to the size of the stones which were\nthrown, we have the very clear piece of evidence supplied by Mr.\nJacques from bis own observations, made at a time when he was\nthe sole occupant of the dugout. They \"varied,\" be says, \"in\nsize from that of an orange to double the size,\" and these stones\ncame \"violently into contact with the inside of the door.\" This\nsbows clearly that whatever projected the stones must have used\n\fJune, 1918. Gorres'pondence. 197\nvery considerable force in the act. It is therefore rather sur-\nprising to read Mr. Cunningham Craig's statement that \"the\ndischarge of comparatively small quantities of gas would probably\nbe quite sufficient to cause most of the phenomena described, but it\nis more probable that slight explosions, not necessarily accompanied\nby any loud sound or well-marked flame, may have taken place.\"\nWhilst deference is of course due to Mr. Cunningham Craig's\nwide knowledge and experience of the subject, it is at the same\ntime most difficult to see how this explanation at all meets the\ncase. What, exactly, is supposed to happen when a stone is\nviolently discharged from the wall of the dugout? Two sug-\ngestions appear to be contained in the explanation quoted above.\n(1) The stone may be forced out by the pressure of gas\naccumulated in the soil behind it.\n(2) The stone may be expelled by an explosion, caused by the\nignition of a mixture of air and methane in a pocket, or\nin the porous soil behind the stone.\nWith regard to (1), it is obvious that the pressure of gas\nrequired to project a stone weighing a pound or more across a\ndugout, particularly with sufficient violence to chip a brick wall,\nwould be very high indeed. I would like to ask Mr. Cunningham\nCraig whether the accumulation of methane in the earth under\nsuch pressures is known to occur. But even supposing that the\ngas was present under a hard band of rock at sufficiently high\npressure, would it not escape when once the band had been\npunctured, and rush out and fill the whole dugout, in which case\nthe occupants could hardly fail to be aware of its presence? Also,\nwhen the pressure was once released, how could the phenomena\ncontinue 1\nWith regard to (2), if we suppose the stones to have been\nprojected by means of explosions of methane in the soil behind\nthem, is it really credible that these explosions could be unaccom-\npanied by any \"loud sound or well-marked flame \"1 One would\nexpect an explosion of sufficient violence to shoot out a stone\nwhich should leave its mark on a brick wall, to make a noise like\na gun. Nobody in a dugout could fail to hear the popping of\na soda-water cork, so that it seems incredible that they could\nfail to hear so powerful an explosion, and that time after time.\nAnother point of difficulty is the mode of ignition of the charge\nbehind the stone. It would seem that a candle, before igniting a\ncharge of gas in the interstices of the wall, must first fire the\ngas in the dugout itself. Could this occur unobserved by the\noccupants of the dugout ?\nFurther on Mr. Cunningham Craig says :\n\" There seemed to be\nslight traces of gas still left in crannies at the entrance to the\nalcove.\" He does not however tell us by what test he discovered\nthese traces. That also would be interesting.\nOne other point seems to be worth raising in connection with\nthe natural gas theory of this phenomenon. When Mr. Jacques\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1918.\nleft the dugout, and was about to close the door behind him, and\nthe fusilade of stones came against it, were the candles still alight,\nor had he extinguished them ? This point seems important,\nbecause if the candles were extinguished, the stones cannot have\nbeen projected by explosions of gas.\nG. N. N. Tyrrell.\nEEVIEW.\nSpiritualism and Sir Oliver Lodge. By Charles A. Mercier, M.D.,\netc. (The Mental Culture Enterprise.)\nThe Question: If a man die, shall he live again? Job xiv. 14. A\nbrief Examination of Modern Spiritualism. By Edward Clodd.\n(Grant Pilchards.)\nAVere it not that to ignore these books might be taken as an\nacknowledgment that their contentions are unanswerable, I should\nhave replied to the Editor of the Journal, who lias asked me to\nreview them, that they really do not deserve notice. They\ncontain no new ideas, and what passes for argument in them has\nbeen put forward over and over again, \u2014always proving ineffective\nbecause it is logically unsound. Neither author appears to have\nrecognised that in dealing with certain subjects it is imjaossible to\nprove a universal negative. You may employ insinuation and\nprejudice to discredit what you dislike, but the unbiassed inquirer\nafter truth, whose appeal is to reason, remains unsatisfied. Such\nan incjuirer is quite aware that there is much fraud in the world,\nmuch credulity, superstition, and mal-observation, and he believes\nthat there always has been. So far he has nothing to learn from\nthese two writers, who spend much time in impressing these facts\nupon him ; but when he opens their books he may fairly expect\nto find particular concrete instances of alleged supernormal or\nspiritistic phenomena accounted for by some known normal or\nnon-spiritistic cause. If there has been fraud or carelessness on\nthe part of those who vouch for them, he demands to have this\nproved. The authors of the books tell him, \"It may have been,\nor it probably was, thus or thus\"; but he replies, \"I knew that;\ngive me some definite ground for believing that in this particular\nease it ivas thus or thus.\" But his would-be teachers merely talk\nround the point and leave him where he was before.\nMoreover, it is usually considered desirable, before one writes\non a subject, to have had some practical experience or to possess\nsome personal knowledge of the matters of which one writes\n;\notherwise one soon gets out of one's depth. Neither of these\nwriters, however, appears to have sat with a medium, or to have\nbeen present at an experiment in crystal-gazing or thought-trans-\nference, still less to have made experiments in the two last\nthemselves. When Dr. Mercier wrote his book, his acquaintance\nwith psychical research, as he tells us himself, was confined to a\nperusal of Raymond; but he has had great experience in mental\ndisease, and he had met with cases of such disease that were\n\fJune, 1918. Review. 19^\nassociated with a belief in spiritism, though, as he admits, spiritism\nwas not the prime cause of the trouble. Who, therefore, could be\nbetter equipped, not merely to review Raymond (as the present\nwriter might, for instance, review A Text-Book of Insanity), but to\ninstruct the public on the subject of psychical research ? For he\nis, as his title-page informs us, \"M.D., F.R.C.P., F.R.C.S., Sometime\nExaminer in Psychology and Mental Diseases in the University of\nLondon; Lecturer in Insanity at the Medical Schools of the West-\nminster Hospital, Charing Cross Hospital, and the Eoyal Free\nHospital. Author of A New Logic ; Psychology, Normal and Morbid;\nA Text-Book of Insanity ; Criminal Responsibility; Crime and Insanity,.\netc.\" He was apparently convinced beforehand that a belief in\n\" spiritualism \" and all that sort of thing is a sign of mental\ndegeneracy ; what more simple, then, than for the author of A Nevj\nLogic to treat this conviction as a proved fact, make it the major\npremiss of his syllogism, and then use it as his conclusion] This\nseems to me to be what Dr. Mercier has done, and with evident\nsatisfaction to himself; but the resulting book is a poor compliment\nto the intelligence of his expected readers.\nMr. Clodd wears his rue with a difference. He is a student of\nlegends and folk-lore, and primitive and savage superstitions :\nand\nthe historical parts of his book would be interesting to those not\nfamiliar with such things and who did not find them irrelevant to\nthe point immediately at issue. In the chapter on crystal-gazing\nhe tells us how the Queensland Aborigines, and the Maori, and the\nApache Indians, and the Dyaks, and the Zulus, and the Shamans\nof Siberia, and Dr. Dee and others do or did it; but he omits to\ntell us how he knows that neither they nor any crystal-gazers\namong ourselves ever obtain knowledge by other than normal means.\nIn the chapter on telepathy, in which he frankly disbelieves, he\nquotes eminent scientific men who have been present at experiments\nthat have failed. Drawing no distinction, apparently, between mental\nprocesses and matter, he argues that since in some half-dozen cases\nthe telepathic tap could not be turned on to order, therefore there\nnever have been and never could be any cases of success ;\napparent\nsuccesses must have been assisted by intentional or unintentional\nfraud. Yet personally, in spite of what I know of numerous failures,\nI cannot help believing telepathy to be a fact, for I have actually\nbeen (though these gentlemen will not believe me) a successful\npercipient, when blind-folded and sitting deep in an arm-chair in a\ncorner with my back to the room. Am I to believe that one of\nthe agents, who had been cautioned not to utter a woi'd, inad-\nvertently made a little noise like a pink rhomboid, and that I\nunconsciously perceived and correctly interpreted it 1 Mr. Clodd\nalso gives us a list of mediums detected in fraud, and mentions\ncases which he can only explain by assuming that tliere was\ndeception. From this his logic leads him to the conclusion that\nthere are not and cannot be honest mediums ; which is as much as\nto argue that because there is much bad money in circulation, there\ncannot be any that is good.

July, 1918.\nSEKIOUS INCREASE IN THE COST OE FEINTING\nTHE SOCIETY'S PUBLICATIONS.\nThe cost of printing and of paper has increased so enormously\nthat if the average scale of output of Proceedings and Juarnal\nis to be maintained, it will involve an extra expenditure of\nabout \u00a3500 a year as compared with the pre-war scale. Only\na small part of this heavy drain on the Society's resources,\nwhich is likely to continue for some years, can be met out\nof annual income, and it must, in default of additional\nfunds being contributed, be met. by the sale of investments.\nRealization of investments, liowever,\u2014and above all at the\npresent time when the market value of even such sound\nsecurities as those held by the Society has considerably\ndepreciated\u2014is a course which the Council can contemplate\nonly with great leluctance. The Council, nevertheless, is of\nopinion that to sell out invested funds is a lesser evil than\nto reduce the output of Proceedings, especially now when a\nrather unusually large amount of intei'esting matter is ready\nor being prepared for publication.\nIn these days, when appeals of all kinds and for the\nworthiest objects are legion, the Council hesitates to make a\ngeneral appeal to Members and Associates for donations\ntowards tiie increased cost of printing. At the same time\nshould the benevolence and the purse of any of our Members\nand Associates not yet have been exhausted, and should they\nbe willing to contribute, the Council would greatly appreciate\ntheir generosity.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nThe 156th Meeting of tlie Council was held at 20 Hanover\nSquare, London, W., on Friday, July 5th, 1918, at 5 p.m.;\nThe Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfouk in the chair. There\nwere also present : Mr. W. W. Baggally, Sir William Barrett,\nthe Rev. M. A. Bayfield, Captain E. N. Bennett, Dr. T. W.\nMitchell, Mr. J. G. I'iddington, Mr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt, Mr.\nSydney C. Scott, and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick : also Mrs. Salter,\nEditor, and Miss Isabel Newton, Secretary.\n\fJuLr, 1918. Meeting of the Council. 203\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read\nand signed as correct.\nTwo new Members and six new Associates were elected.\nTheir names and addresses are given above.\nThe Monthly Accounts for May and June, 1918, were\npresented and taken as read.\nThe Hon. Treasurer reported that the increase in the cost\nof paper and printing of which the Council were informed at\ntheir last meeting, would, according to his calculation, involve\nan extra expenditure on Proceedings and Journal, as compared\nwith the pre-war average, of about \u00a3500 a year. Only a\nsmall part of this extra expenditure could be met out of the\nannual income, and though some slight economy might be\neffected by using somewhat thinner paper, there appeared to\nbe no way of materially reducing the expense except by reducing\nthe amount printed. The Hon. Treasurer was loth to recom-\nmend the selling of investments especially at the present time.\nThe Council, after some discussion, decided not to restrict the\noutput of Proceedings, but to instruct the Editor to keep down\nthe Journal to an average of 12 pages. Further, though with\nreluctance, they determined to call the attention of Members\nand Associates to the matter, and invite their assistance, in the\nhope of thus avoiding the necessity of selling securities. The\nform of appeal agreed on is printed above.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 150th General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nRobert Barnes Hall of the Royal Society of Medicine,\n1 Wimpole Street, London, W., on Friday, July 5th, 1918,\nat 3 p.m. ; The Right Hon. Gerald Balfour in the chair.\nDr. T. W. Mitchell read a paper \" On the Doris Fischer\nCase of Multiple Personality.\"\n\"CLOUDLESS SKY BEYOND THE HORIZON.\"\nBy Hubert Wales.\nSince I joined the Society, about a year ago, I have been\ntrying to familiarize myself with its work in the past, and\na 2\n\f204 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. July, 1918.\namong other things have read Mr. Piddington's exhaustive\nand most interesting report on the concordant automatisms\nobserved in connection with Mrs. Piper's visit to England\nin 1906-7. I feel that anything I can say in regard to it,\nparticularly at this late hour, can be of small value ; but it\ndoes, I think, sometimes happen that, when a new mind\nis brought to bear on a subject, it lights blithely upon points\nthat have escaped those that have long been trained upon\nit at close range ; and so I venture to offer a few remarks,\nfor what they are worth, respecting the application of the\nwords \" Cloudless sky beyond the horizon,\" quoted above.\nThese emerged originally at the Piper sitting of March 6,\n1907\u2014first \" Cloudless Sky Horizon,\" in disconnected isolation,\nand then the fiill phrase (pp. 148-9 of Mr. Piddington's report,\nProc. Vol. XXII.). The topic under discussion at the time\nwas Mrs. Verrall's script of January 28, called the \" Hope,\nStar and Browning \" script, and they were apparently supplied\nin response to Mr. Piddington's request for words connected\nwith that script. He divorces them, however, from their\ncontext and refers them to the Greek words avros ovpavo^\nuKvfXMv (translated \" the very heaven waveless \"), which had been\ngiven to the trance personalities for elucidation on January 29,\non the grounds that they are \" so satisfactory a paraphrase\n\"\nof those words and that names and quotations associated\nwith them occur in the waking stage of the trance. He\nfurther justifies his removal of \" Cloudless Sky Horizon \" from\ntheir context by pointing out that they come on a fresh\nsheet of paper in the trance script, that they are written\nin larger and bolder characters than the preceding words,\nthat they are accompanied by the question \" don't you under-\nstand ?\n\" which in his experience rarely indicate an allusion\nto another automatist. and that his request for words occurring\nin the \" Hope, Star \"'\nscript is subsequently answered by the\nfurnishing of at least one word which can be so referred.\nMr. Piddington does not convince me by these arguments\nthat he is right in removing the passage from its context\n;\nbut, if he should have mistaken the intention in that respect,\nit would seem to me to be an exceedingly fortunate circum-\nstance, from the point of view of the study of trance pheno-\nmena ; for sustained discouragement, springing from the\n\fJuly, 1918. \" Cloudless Sky beyond the Horizon.\" 205\nhonest misappreliension of a sympathetic investigator, is\nobviously a condition that can only occur by accident. The\npersistence shown by the trance personalities in these circum-\nstances (as I conceive them), in returning again and again to\ntheir point, in reiterating their statements sitting after sitting,\nin the face of the consistently negative attitude of the sitters,\nseems to me to provide some unusually interesting material\nto the consideration of the question of the source of the\ntrance intelligence. I hope, therefore, I may be forgiven\nif, with the object of showing, if possible, that such conditions\nhave obtained, I proceed to a belated examination of Mr.\nPiddington's reasons for separating the \" Cloudless sky\n\"\npassage from its verbal environment, and then offer reasons\nin favonr of a contextual reading.\nAs we have seen, Mr. Piddington's first, and, indeed, his\nonly positive, reason for connecting the \" Cloudless sky\n\"\nphrase with the Greek words is that it provides \" so satis-'\nfactory a paraphrase.\" So it seems at the first blush ; but\ncan we, upon analysis, call it a paraphrase at all without\nsomewhat straining the sense of the term ? A cloud is not\nthe same thing as a wave, \" beyond the horizon \" does not\nimport by any means the same idea as \" beyond the wjp \"\nor atmosphere, and the third word auT09 is not suggested at\nall. Of his four negative reasons, the first two concern the\nproduction of the trance script, a subject upon which he is\nnecessarily in a far better position to form an opinion than\nanyone else can be. As regards those, therefore, I will only\nsay, and that tentatively and with diffidence, that a fresh\nsheet of paper is usually taken because its predecessor has\nbeen filled, and that the writing of salient words in bold\nand emphatic characters is, I think, a feature common in\nthe Piper script. Mr. Piddington's experience also establishes\nthe general rule that such expressions as \" don't you under-\nstand ?\n\" in the Piper trance are not associated with another\nautomatist ;\nbut, as a matter of fact, the rule does not hold\ngood in this particular case, for, a little further on in the\nsame sitting, a reference to a word admittedly belonging\nto Mrs. Verrall's \" Hope, Star \" script is followed by the\nquestion, \" did you understand ?\n\"\n(p. 72). In any case,\nMr. Piddington regards these three points as of minor impor-\n\f206 Jotivnal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1918\ntance ; he rests his main argument for a non-contextual\nreading upon the ground that his request for words occurring\nin the \" Hope, Star \" script was subsequently responded to.\nThis point, however, I thinlv, is much weakened by the circum-\nstances that it was he who re-introduced the subject, after\nsome remarlvs connected with the deciphering of \" horizon,\"\nand that the reply he received was worded, \" he also wrote\nsomething about bird \" (italics mine). A fair inference from\nthis seems to be that the trance personalities supposed that\nhe was not satisfied by the words they had previously given\nand accordingly supplied him with additional words.\nI now turn to my reasons for thinking the \" Cloudless\nsky \" phrase should be referred, as the context suggests, to\nMrs. Verrall's \" Hope, Star \" script of January 28.\n]. The phrase seems to me to be, not merely implicit,\nbut almost explicit in Mrs. Verrall's script. A copy of this\nis printed on p. 62 of Mr. Piddington's report, together with\nreproductions of the two drawings at the end. The word\n\" sky \" occurs in it three times, and conveys an impression\nof a clear, rather than a cloudy, sky. But my main point\nconcerns the word \" horizon.\" Let me say, to begin with,\nthat I read this script some time before I came to the first\nreference in the report to the phrase \" Cloudless sky beyond\nthe horizon,\" or its component words, so my mind was not\nprepossessed by that idea. The first drawing at the foot of\nthe script\u2014eliminating the triangle, which was introduced\nfor a particular purpose\u2014is a long horizontal line, with a\nhalf circle standing, points downwards, upon it. I took this\nto represent the line of the horizon, with a rainbow above\nit ;\nregarding it as an illustration of the preceding line, \" In\nthe sky the perfect arc.\" When subsequently I discovered\nthat this was a misquotation of Browning's, \" On the earth\nthe broken arcs ; in the heaven, a perfect round,\" I slightly\nmodified that idea, and took the two drawings together to\nindicate a conception of the Browning line. The second\ndrawing\u2014again eliminating the triangle\u2014is a circle. The\nlower part of it is marked ADB, and it is followed by the\nexplanatory note :\n\" ADB is the part that unseen completes\nthe arc.\" In other words, as I took it as a matter of course,\nthe arc is completed in the \" sky beyond the horizon.\"\n\fJuly, 1918. \" Cloudless Sky beyond the Hm^izon.\" 207\n2. In the Piper sitting of March 6. where the \" Cloudless\nsky \" phrase first emerges, it appears to be plainly stated\nthat this has been given to Mrs. Verrall ;\nfor, immediately\nafter a mention of the word \" horizon,\" the following occurs :\n\" It was given like this \" Then, after Mr. Piddington\nhas said \" Yes,\" come the words, \" A cloudless sky beyond the\nHorison \" (p. 149). Given to whom 1 Only Mrs. Verrall's\nname has so far been mentioned ;\nso, if not to her, it is\ndifficidt to conceive to whom the words could apply.\n3. On four subsequent occasions\u2014reckoning, as I am able\nto do, only from the published reports and extracts of the\nPiper sittings\u2014^it is stated without equivocation that the\n\" Cloudless sky \" phrase or \" that sentence about horizon\n\"\nhas been given to Mrs. Verrall : on April 10 (p. 282) ; on\nApril 15 (p. 365) ; on April 17 (p. 284) ; and some time about\nJanuary, 1908 (the precise date is not given), after Mrs. Piper's\nreturn to America (p. 90). On the second of these occasions\nthe additional statement is made that the phrase was given\n\"with other lines.\" Mrs. Verrall's \"Hope, Star\" script\ncontains, besides the line \" On the earth,\" etc., two other\nquotations from the same poem of Browning^\n\u2014\nAht Vogler.\nOn the third occasion the trance personality Myersp adds,\n\" I wrote myself a similar line, which I gave her also.\" I\nsuggest tentatively that \u2022\nthis may refer to Frederic Myers's\nline, \" Thee the first number and harmonious whole,\" somewhat\nsimilar in idea to \"in the heaven, a perfect romid.\" It is\nreflected in Mrs. Verrall's script of December 17, 1906 (p. 310).\n4. On three occasions, in the published reports of the Piper\nsittings, the word \" horizon \" is mentioned in connection\nwith the words \" hope \" and \" star,\" or one of them : on\nApril 17 (pp. 284-5) ; on April 24 (p. 285, near the bottom) ;\nand again on April 24 (p. 286, near the bottom). On the\nfirst of these occasions it is stated that \" the passage I wished\nconcerned . . . three words horizon was one of them and\nHorizon was the most important \" ; and on the second\noccasion its position is more precisely indicated by the state-\nment that it came \" after we wrote a few lines of Browning's\npoem.\"\n5. In the Piper sitting of March 6 the words, in reference\nto \"horizon,\" \"It was given like this,\" are followed by a\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1918.\nhorizontal line (p. 149). To my mind this is a plain statement\nthat the word was brought out in Mrs. Verrall's script, not\nin writing, but by the drawing of a line. Again, at the\nsitting of April 17 (p. 284) the following occurs in the trance\nscript : \"It came out I believe with a star being drawn also\nhorizon.\" Yet again, at the sitting of April 24 (p. 286), this\noccurs :\n\" did she not mention Horizon, as Myers gave it\nher ... a long line seemed to appear seemed on her paper.\"\nThe trance personality is told, however, \" I don't think there\nwas a long line \" ; and then, once more, a long horizontal\nline is drawn.\nThe persistence with which the trance personalities stuck\nto their true statement about this horizontal line, in the\nface of repeated rebuffs, is, I think, of all their pertinacity\nin this matter, the most remarkable. For, whatever else\nmay be in doubt, it is a simple fact, patent to the eye, that\nMrs. Verrall's \"Hope, Star\" script contains a long horizontal\nline. One only regrets, somehow, that the communicating\nintelligence, whatever it is, cannot be informed, even at this\nlate hour, that the line which \" seemed to appear seemed\non her paper,\" did so appear.\n6. In the waking stage of Mrs. Piper's trance of April 17\n\u2014the trance in which it had been stated that \" Cloudless\nsky\" etc., had been given to Mrs. Verrall, that \"horizon\"\nhad been \"drawn,\" and that \"horizon\" was the most impor-\ntant of \" three words \"\n\u2014the word \" rainbow \" is twice uttered,\nwith descriptive emphasis and in an appropriate context, as\nfollows (p. 305) :\n\" What's the difference between this world\nand another one, and that's a rainbow ... a rainbow\n\u2014\ncolours.\" The answer to the question, \" What's the difference,\"\netc., is, surely, \" On the earth the broken arcs ; in the heaven,\na perfect round.\"\n7. In the Piper sitting of April 24, immediately after \" Hope\nStar Horizon \" had been written, this occurs :\n\" Horizon\ncomes elsewhere. Yes do not get confused dear Mrs. Sidgwick\n\"\n(p. 286). The word \" horizon \" appears, in writing, in Mrs.\nVerrall's script of April 15, nearly three months after the\n\" Hope, Star \" script. The sentence above quoted evidently\nrequires it to have appeared on some occasion besides that.\nI would like just to add that, if the \" Cloudless sky\n\"\n\fJuly, 1918. \" Cloudless Sky beyond the Horizon.\" 209\nphrase be referred to the \" Hope Star \" script, it would not,\nin my view, in any way weaken the Greek words episode.\nMr. Piddington does not suggest that \" Cloudless sky beyond\nthe horizon \" is a translation of the Greek words ;\nand,\nmoreover, the trance personalities were asked for a translation\nonly as an alternative. This was at the sitting of January 29\n(p. 141) :\n\" Mrs. V. :\n'\nYes. You could either translate them\ninto English, or tell me of what they make you think.'\n\"\nThe trance personalities gave the associations, and they nowhere\nindicate that they apprehended they were expected to supple-\nment these with a translation, or that they had given a\ntranslation. In any case, a translation or paraphrase, however\naccurate, forthcoming on March 6, of Greek words spoken in\nMrs. Piper's presence on January 29, manifestly could have\nno evidential value. On the other hand, the reference of this\nphrase to the \" Hope, Star \" script would, I think, greatly\nstrengthen the interesting cross-correspondence which hinges\nupon it\u2014^interesting not only for its content, but for the attach-\nment to it of the agreed sign of a cross-correspondence, a triangle\nwithin a circle. It would too, I believe, clear up obscurities\nin the scripts concerned with the Latin message, and par-\nticularly would throw a flood of light on the difficulties which\ncentre in the indications that the second sentence of that\nmessage was not accurately received or translated by the\ntrance personalities.\nA CASE DELAYED TOO LONG.\nIn their Annual Report, which appeared in the Journal for\nFebruary-March of this year, the Council referred (p. 137), as\nan illustration of cases not sent to them, to one described\napparently at second hand, in an essay by a Member of the\nSociety. The essay in question was one of those by Miss\nL. Dougall in the book Immortality ; and the case was that\ndescribed on the authority of \"Miss A.\" on pp. 250-251 of\nthe book.\nBriefly the story is that Mrs. B. called on Miss A. on her\nway to a visualising medium with whom she was having\na series of sittings. On this particular day, however,\u2014as\nMrs. B. afterwards told Miss A.\u2014the visions of the medium\n\ft\n\/\n210 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1918.\nconveyed nothing to Mrs. B., who could make no sense of\nthem. Miss A. asked what they had been, and to her great\nsurprise found they were umnistakeably connected with serious\nevents with which Miss A.'s mind was occupied, but of which\nshe had not spoken to Mrs. B. Curiously, too, these visions\nhad been ushered in by one of a Chinaman in his native dress,\nand it happened that Miss A. had that morning noticed two\ngaily dressed Chinamen coming down the steps of the Chinese\nEmbassy in London as she passed.\nThis story, as will be at once seen, seems to show a strong\ntelepathic connection between the minds of the medium and\nMiss A., produced in some way by the relation of both of them\nto Mrs. B. And if this can be held to be demonstrated,\nthe fact is obviously of considerable theoretic interest.\nI have lately had some correspondence with Miss Dougall\nabout the case. She herself heard it from Miss A., and\ntogether with friends who were with her was much impressed\nwith it and with Miss A. as a witness. The account was\nwritten down by Miss Dougall, and before it was used in\nher essay was submitted to Miss A. about three months after\nshe had told the story, and was approved by her. We may\ntherefore practically regard the narrative as it appears in\nImmortality as being a first-hand account.\nMiss Dougall also very kindly told Miss A., who turns out\nto be a lady well known to me personally though it is some\ntime since I have seen her, of my wish to hear more of the\ncase ; and from Miss A. I have received an interesting letter\nabout it, for which I am much indebted to her. She tells\nme, however, that the incident occurred in 1892, more than\ntwenty-five years ago ; that she has long lost sight of Mrs. B.,\nand doubts if she is still living ; and that she has no idea\nwho the medium concerned was. Under the circumstances\nI think it is not worth while to press for an accoimt for\npublication, or for any sacrifice of anonymity. The great\ndesire of the Council now is to obtain accounts of recent\nexperiences and of experiences recorded soon after they\noccurred.\nAt the same time, knowing Miss A., and with her letter\nbefore me testifying to a vivid recollection of what she describes\nas the \" quite astonishing experience,\" I myself cannot but\n\fJuly, 1918. A Case delayed too long. 211\nattach weight to the case, and I am grateful to her for\nallowing me to give the following additional particulars.\nMss A. was at the time in great grief on account of the\nsudden death by an accident of a near relative. Mrs. B.\nknew about the accident, and in Miss A.'s opinion this makes\nIt possible that one of the two appropriate visions described\nby the medium may have been independent of Miss A.'s\nmind. But the one that struck her most concerned the\nfuneral service. This took place in a large building with a\nroof supported by huge pillars, quite unusual in size for plain\npillars. Miss A. had sat so that fom' of these pillars had\nbeen included in her field of vision, and, in that curious way\nin which one sometimes notes an unimportant detail at the\nmoment of apparently total absorption in something affecting\none strongly, she noted these four pillars. The medium, as\nreported by Mrs. B., described a meeting apparently for\nworship in a building unknown to her in which she saw these\nfour (to her) unusual pillars. Miss A. does not now remember\nquite what the description by the medium of the pillars was.\nShe only knows that, at the time, she remarked them as\nthe four pillars that had made such a strong impression on\nher mind. The building and pillars were entirely unknown\nto Mrs. B.\nMiss A. tells me that she is not given to psychic experiences,\nand that this is the only striking thing of the sort that has\never happened to her.\nThis account has been revised by Miss A.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nCOERESPONDENCE.\nPERSONAL APPEARANCE OF THE DEPARTED AS\nDESCRIBED BY CONTROLS.\nTo the Editor of the \" Journal.\"\nWest Thurrock Vicarage,\nGrays, Essex, 2U\/i June, 19 1\u00ab.\nDear Madam,\u2014The letter, from Dr. L.

It is impossible to come, with our present\nlight, to any other conclusion than that someone is honestly\ndescribing what he thinks he is looking at, and which, to him,\nappears real, not merely as to the colour of the hair and pecu-\nliarities of the deceased when in the flesh, but as to the shape\nand texture of the clothing worn and the ornaments usually carried.\nWho or \" what \" then is this \" someone \" ? Surely it is the\nsub-normal personality of the medium. What does he see ?\nSurely, it is the simple series of impressions now lying latent\nin the mind of the sitter, impressions of the deceased as he used\nto appear, which may not have any more reality than a cinema\nfilm. If this be true, then it is easy to understand that, to\nreproduce the name would be rather a difficulty, because to get\nthe impression of a mere name, unless that name was inscribed\non some article, is not easy.\nOn this theory, it is possible one may be after all only seeing\na shadow or film, a figment of a former impression, and taking\nit for a reality. But, does this prove there is no \" reality\n\"\nat all ? By no means. The \" reality \" may be in existence\nsomewhere else far away, and have no knowledge whatever of\nits film being mistaken for itself, but it shows how easily one\nmay be deceived unintentionally.

By Sir Oliver Lodge.\nIn the June number of tlie Journal of the Society for Psychical\nResearch, the President, Dr. L. P. Jacks, raises some questions\nwhich must clearly be faced, about the most reasonable way of\nregarding the power which mediums undoubtedly possess of\ndescribing the old mundane appearance of a communicator, at\na time when that communicator is ostensibly present and\nsending messages.\nIt is an excellent thing to have matters of difl&culty thrashed\nout, and the Society is indebted to its President for raising so\nclearly and explicitly issues which are of the first importance\nif the phenomena encountered are to be rationally understood.\nMy experience of the phenomena is necessarily larger than Dr.\nJacks's, and if I do not feel the full force of the difficulties\nwhich he raises, if I fail to regard them as insuperable, there\nmust be some reason ; and that reason, so far as I understand\nit, I will endeavour to make clear.\nHe says he does not vouch for the description given in any\ngiven case as being \" correct \"\u2014by which he must mean in\naccordance with the sitter's memory,\u2014because he was not always\nsure for whom the description was intended : but if we are to\ndiscuss the matter I must assume that we attend only to cases\nin which the descriptions are accurate ;\nfor, if they are not in\nthe main correct, they are meaningless. It is easy\u2014at least\nit appears to be easy for a novelist\u2014to give detailed descriptions of\nimaginary persons, to relate what they do, what they say, and\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1918.\nindeed to give their whole life history : so I must assume that\nthe descriptions given by a medium are not of this nature, but\nthat they really do fit some specified person, and are not merely\nthrown out at a venture. Many people have had experiences\nof this kind and know that true descriptions can be given ; and\nfrom what he says later in his article it appears that Dr. Jacks\nmust really know it too ; so we had better assume the fact\n\u2014\nat any rate for the sake of argument\u2014and discuss how it is to\nbe accoimted for.\nDr. Jacks suggests two alternatives, and deals with each in\nsuch a way as to condemn them both :\n(1) that the departed person actually retains his appearance,\nin every minute detail\n;\n(2) that he consciously \" builds up \" or depicts himself as\nhe remembers himself, or rather as he thinks the sitter will\nremember him ; after somewhat the same fashion, we may\nsuppose, as an artist is able to paint a posthumous portrait.\nFinding objection to both of these hypotheses, Dr. Jacks falls\nback upon his own idea that the mind of the sitter is telepathi-\ncally read, so that the description given naturally agrees with\nthe sitter's own memory of the person who is being described.\nThis is a hypothesis which has frequently suggested itself to\nmany an enquirer, but it is not free from difficulties ; and they\nare difficulties which accumulate in force as experience grows.\nIt is always a hypothesis to be borne in mind, there may always\nbe some element or trace of this mind-reading faculty in operation,\nand I would not deny that with some mediums it may possibly\nbe the dominant method.\nBut I have not myself come across mediums of this kind\n\u2014\nat least not among those with whom I have had anything like\nextensive experience,\u2014and hence gradually the hypothesis has\nretired into the background of my mind, after the manner of\nworking hypotheses in physical science which are frequently found\nout of harmony with facts.\nI will adduce one or two instances which cannot reasonably\nbe explained in this way :\n(a) Suppose a person is being described, whom the sitter\ntakes for one person Y, while he really is another person Z.\nA number of the particulars given seem to fit Y, so that Y\ncomes to the forefront of the hearer's mind ; and though\n\fPersonal Appearance of the Departed. 215\nthere are many doubtful points and a few wrong ones, yet\nthese are readily attributed to error.\nThen come messages which seem rather puzzling and in-\ncoherent, until something occurs which makes it flash on the\nmind of the sitter that the ostensible communicator is not\nY at all, but Z. The things said then become coherent and\nintelligible ; and on subsequently looking back at the personal\ndescription, as taken down in the record, the details given\nare found to be practically all correct now that they are\napplied to Z, i.e. to a person who had not previously been\nin the sitter's mind.\nIn so far as this is an imaginary case it proves nothing, but\nI could hunt up records which closely correspond to the account\nhere given : and meanwhile I will ask Dr. Jacks whether \\\\\\ his\nopinion such a case, if established, would be fatal to his mind-\nreading explanation, or whether he can see some loophole, such\nfor instance that it is the unconscious or dream stratum of the\nmind that is being read, and that the sitter's conscious thoughts\nare irrelevant. This may be plausible ; but then crops up a\nsecond difficulty which I wish to adduce, and which I will\nillustrate by another hypothetical case :\n(6) Suppose a perfectly unknown person is being described,\none whom the sitter has never seen ; and suppose he is\nultimately told to take messages from this stranger to a\nfriend or acquaintance ; and suppose that on taking the\nmessage, and showing the description, it is recognised as\ncorrectly representing the recipient's memory of the com-\nmunicator. I ask whether this, if established, would serve as\na crucial test against the validity of the mind-reading hypo-\nthesis, or whether Dr. Jacks would wish to strain the tele-\npathic hypothesis into reading the mind of some disconnected\nbut specified and relevant person not present at all.\nBy these and similar experiences I have myself felt the ordinary\ntelepathic hypothesis break down : it becomes more and more\nfar-fetched as experience grows. Thus gradually has the mind-\nreading hypothesis drifted into the background, in my own case ;\nand many obscure observations have caused me to postulate,\nas a working hypothesis of an admittedly vague and unsatis-\nfactory kind, a third hypothesis differing from the (1) and (2)\nof Dr. Jacks. It does not differ toto coelo from hypothesis (2),\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct,1918.\nthat of the artist consciously portraying a person's appearance,\nbut it definitely relegates the power to the unconscious rather\nthan to the conscious action of the mind,\u2014 if \"mind\" in such case\nis a correct term.\nIt does not differ in revolutionary fashion even from hypothesis\n(1) that the permanent appearance of the departed is somehow\nsimilar to his bodily appearance here, though it lays no stress on\nthis as an explanation of mediumistic description, it only seeks\nto apprehend the truth underlying the fact of recognisability by\nfriends and relations M'hen they too pass over or are in the act\nof dying.\nThe hypothesis No. 3, which I have gradually been constrained\nsomewhat reluctantly and provisionally to adopt, is the permanent\nexistence in humanity of a kind of materialising power aldn to\nthe materialising power which undoubtedly we possess here.\nFor undoubtedly we have somehow constructed the body which\nwe now possess. How we have done it, none of us knows. Con-\nspicuously its shape and peculiarities do not depend on the kind\nof food with which it has been supplied, so long as it was whole-\nsome, but on the guiding or controlling soul or psychic entity\nwhich has put the particles together and built them up. The\noperation has been absolutely unconscious, just as unconscious\nas the formg,tion of a bird's feather or the corolla of a flower ;\nbut it has been accomplished. And if any part of us survives,\nI see no reason why this constructive or organising ability should\nnot survive too. I consider that the whole character and per-\nsonality survive ; and I conjecture that our present association\nwith a certain shape and special features is a type or sample\nof something permanent. Our body may not be describable\nexactly as part of our character, but it may correspond to the\nform which any outward manifestation or material display of the\npersonality must inevitably take.\nGiven any continued power of acting on matter at all\u2014which\nIS admittedly a considerable demand only to be justified by actual\nfacts\u2014then I should say that the simplest hypothesis is that we\nhave still to act upon it in the old accustomed way ; not because\nwe are consciously attending to what we are doing, not because\nwe remember our appearance and are artistically constructing a\nportrait image, but because the very act of re-associating ourselves\nwith matter inevitably executes itself along the old familiar\nchannels, so that the bodily representation which results has a\n\fOct., 1918. Personal Ajypearance of the Departed. 217\nwell-defined shape and definite features for precisely the same\nreason (whatever that may be) that the old material presentation\nhad them.\nIt is no use marvelling at the completeness of the representa-\ntion. If it differs at all it might differ completely, and be nothing\nlike even a human being; it might be like nothing on earth, and\nbe indescribable. As to that we must be guided by the facts.\nI see no a priori reason for supposing any bodily representation\npossible ;\nbut, if certain statements are true, the thing occurs ;\nand all that we are now trying to do is to consider the least\nforced and most plausible working hypothesis concerning it.\n\"WTien I speak of a materialising faculty, T mean simply the\nfaculty\u2014quite unconscious though it be\u2014-which put together the\nbody here out of atoms of matter. Where matter is no longer\navailable, it might be that this particular faculty sank into\nabeyance. But it seems equally possible that it will exert itself\non something else, say on ether ; indeed some think that it has\nalready so exerted itself and that our etherial counterpart already\nexists, along with our flesh body, though naturally it makes\nno impression on our purely material senses. They are not open\nto direct etherial impressions, save for a certain short range of\nrapid quivers 400-700 milliou million per second, which, when\nreceived by the retina, impress us as light.\nT\\Tiether in the person of a medium some portion of matter\nis temporarily available for real materialising purposes, I know\nnot. It is suggestive that so-caUed \" materialisations,\" which can\nbe seen by ordinary persons, can only occur in the presence of\nspecially constituted people : from some of whom there is a\ngrowing body of evidence that something material emanates.\nBut all this is far from conclusive at present, and is very\nlittle understood even when accepted. Fortunately for our present\npurpose we need not enter these more obscure regions, except as\nseeing in them an instructive indication for future possibilities\nof acquirmg knowledge.\nAll that we have now to explain is the impression of something\nlike bodily presence produced on the mind of a medium with\nsufficient psychic power to be aware of it when receiving com-\nmimications.\nThat bodily presence, as described, is like the old one : and\nI say that this is due to a persistent constructive ability\n\u2014\nthat same unconscious activity as was responsible for the old\n\f218 Journcd of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1918.\nbodily form,\u2014and that this accompanyiag activity unconsciously\ncomposes a sort of semi material framework for the conscious\ncommunication or message which the person concerned is desirous\nof sending.\nReverting to a few minor points in Dr. Jacks's article, I will\ndeal with them only briefly. He constracts a difficulty about\nage, and says that if you say a man looks 60 it means that\nhe must have been 50 and will arrive at 70. I deny the necessity\nof this, for an appearance. One can legitimately say that a\nportrait is of a man about 60, without holding the belief that\nthe representation varies with the lapse of time. A portrait also\nmay be clean shaven without necessarily having had to use a\nrazor.\nIt is true that most of us have an indistinct idea of our own\nappearance,\u2014many people are not well acquainted with tieir\nprofile, for instance, though they can see it if they place two\nmirrors at right-angles,\u2014but few, of the male sex at any rate,\ntake the trouble to study their appearance.\nBut the conscious memory has nothing to do with the repro-\nduction of a bodily appearance. We have no conscious con-\nstructive power. If we had consciously to construct a little finger,\nor a lock of ' hair^ or even a pimple, we should be as puzzled\nas if we were constrained consciously to digest our food or\nsuperintend the circulation of our blood.\n\" The idea of being able to represent ourselves as another saw\nus is,\" as Dr. Jacks says, \" flagrantly absurd,\" if the idea is that\nthe operation is to be performed conscioiisly. Dr. Jacks's whole\narticle seems to me to over-emphasise our conscious activities as\nif they were the only ones. So, in his salient paragraph on\npage 189,\n\" To reproduce their appearance in detail, as we knew it\nin this life, the spirits must (1) have known exactly how\nthey looked to us, and (2) be able lo remember this in their\npresent existence.\"\nI say that the verb \" must \" is logically \" defective.\" I wish\nto evade both horns of the dilemma and take refuge in purely\nsubconscious activity.\nThere are one or two other less pronovmced, but as I think\nequally erroneous, assumptions made in the article.\n\u00ab\n\fOct., 1918. Personal Appearance of the Departed. 219\nWhen a medium fails to get a name through readily it does\nnot at all follow that the communicator has forgotten his own\nname. The medium never represents the fact in that way ; he\nis always represented as trying to give it to the medium, but\nit is said that she or her control is sometimes unable to catch it.\nIt may be that this corresponds to some sort of truth, for I have\nnoticed that she often catches something like it, and sometimes\npronounces it in a whisper correctly, yet when uttered aloud it\nsomehow goes wrong.\nI have had something of perhaps the same sort of experience\nmyself, with a half-known air. I can, so to speak, \" hear \" it\nand feel it in my head, and yet the larynx fails to reproduce it.\nWith better known tunes the difficulty of course disappears,\nbut it seems as if weak mental memory or influence is exhausted\nin the effort to switch on that part of the brain which controls\nthe voice.\nIn any case proper names are remarkably meaningless things,\npurely artificial conventional codes ; and that sort of thing is\nalways hard to get through any sort of instrument, whether it\nbe a telephone or another. There seems no element of personality\nor character, or anything permanent, about an ordinary person's\nname ;\nand, to me at least, the bodily appearance of persons in\nthe flesh, or the hearing of their voice, even when they are well\nknown, often fails to call up in ray mind any kind of recollection of\ntheir name.\nThat names are difficult things to get through, may or may\nnot be surprising, but here again we must be guided by the facts.\nSome mediums are good at names : some are bad at them. But\nin no case are we entitled to ascribe the failure as implying any\nforgetfulness on the part of the communicator. That is the\ninference which Dr. Jacks draws, but I venture to regard it as\nan unjustifiable one.\nDr. Jacks may object that I have not definitely said what\nthe image or appearance described by the medium really is.\nFor a very good reason : T do not know. Sometimes 1 think\nof it as akin to a portrait\u2014let us say a mental one\u2014impressed\non the mind of the medium as a concomitant portion or epiphe-\nnomenal part of the whole message ; sometimes I think of it as\nan incipient materialisation, a temporary collocation of atoms of\nmatter arranged so as to produce a likeness. But taking the\nmost materialistic view, as in the extreme cases testified to by\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1918.\nSir William Crookes. when the apparition could be touched a&\nwell as seen, and when for the time it had all the apparent\nattributes of a real person : I still only think of it as temporary,\nand therefore as not amenable to any such difficulties as growth\nof hair, or ageing, or any other changes corresponding to lapse\nof time ; I postulate only a static representation for temporary\npurposes. .\n' :\nIf I am asked whether the hypothesis is not a difficult one,\nI reply yes, a profoundly difficult one. I know nothing more\nincredible than a temporary materialisation. Even the sub-\npermanent ones with wliich we are familiar\u2014our own bodies\n\u2014\nare puzzling enough from the philosophic point of view : few\npeople are hardy enough to say that they understand the inter-\naction of mind and matter.\nI see nothing for it but to be guided by the facts : and if,\nor when, the evidence for a power of temporary materialisation,\nof various grades of completeness, is good enough, I am not\ngoing to close my mind to its reception. Most familiar or\ncommonplace phenomena are essentially surprising, and feel in-\ncredible when probed and analysed. We have no ultimate clue\nto the processes of Nature. We accept without too curious an\nenquiry certain postulates in science, and our system of Imowledge\nis based upon them. Twilight is more mysterious than noon,\nbut is not truly any more incomprehensible : paradoxes are\nappropriate to half-knowledge.\nIndeed I fully believe that when our knowledge is greater\nmany of the exceptional difficulties surrounding the subject will\nappear to lessen, and that ultimately the whole of psychic pheno-\nmena will begin to put on a commonplace air and fade into\nthe light of common day.\nOliver Lodge.\nJune, 1918.\n(II.) By Professor James H. Hyslop.\nDr. Jacks has opened up a large and very complex question,\nand I shall not go into details in referring to it. I only wish\nfirst to say that my experience, which has been large, agrees\nwith that of Dr. Jacks in regard to the fact that mediumistic\ndescriptions of the dead seem to represent them, not as they\n\fOct., 1918. Personal Appearance of the Departed. 22t\nknew themselves, but as others knew them. While he was\nlivmg I suggested this to Mr. Myers in the only letter I ever\nwrote him, though I had no such evidence as I have now, and\nhe was not inclined to believe it. But the hypothesis has been\nconfirmed by much experience since then, and though it does not\ngo very far in the explanation of the phenomena, it coincides\nwith other facts that we know. But I do not think that the\ncasual suggestion of Mr. Jacks that they appear as the sitter\nknew them will account for all the instances. I have had correct\ndescriptions when the sitter had never known the person and\nhad to inquire about the truth of them. But Dr. Jacks probably\nhad telepathy in mind when he made the suggestion, and while\ntelepathy between the living will not always explain the facts,\nit involves probably a correct conception of at least a part of\nthe process. I do not think it is all of it. I shall mention a\nfew points which may help him and others on the way through\nthis tangled wilderness. I have no theory as yet to explain\nthe phenomena satisfactorily and must not be supjjosed as\nsuggesting anything but the most tentative hypotheses.\n(1) I have noticed that the description of physical objects\ninvolves the same phenomena.\n(2) Apparitions without the intermediation of psychics exhibit\nthe same phenomena.\n(3) The character reading of Mrs. Chenoweth [a medium with\nwhom Dr. Hyslop works] shows the same peculiar features of\nthe phenomena.\n(4) One description of my deceased brother represented him\nas changing instantaneously from a child to a man, one apparition\nbeing symbolic of the age at which he died and the other the\nage he would be now.\nSo much for the facts which confixm the impression of Dr.\nJacks and show complications beyond mere appearances to psychics.\nNow for suggestions as to the explanation.\n(1) For years Mrs. Chenoweth thought the appearances she\nsaw in her subliminal state were real, but she finally found\nthey were mental pictures. . . .\n(2) In our own dreams, hallucinations, deliria, and hypnotic\napparitions we take the phenomena as real, showing that sub-\nliminal creation or \" building up,\" to use the phrase of Dr. Jacks,\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1918.\ninvolves apparent reality to us, the same judgment which the\nentranced medium passes on the apparitions passing before her,\nonly in the mediumistic cases they are transferTed, not wholly\ncreated by the psychic, though I have no doubt that the sub-\nconscious is a factor in the result. But the main point is to\nnote the sense of reality which the psychic has interfused with the\nhabit of impersonation, legitimate impersonation in such instances.\nThe \"'\ncontrol \" is often the most important factor in the\nphenomena, so that this circumstance complicates the matter\nstill more. This \" control,\" I find, often misinterprets the appari-\ntions, so that we have reason to believe that they may sometimes\nbe only symbolic. . . .\nI am not going to give detailed facts supporting this, nor\nwould it be desirable here, as I am not so sure of the explanation\nas might seem. I am only suggesting some complications not\n^\nremarked by .Dr. Jacks which may lead to some theoretical\nexplanation that I have not yet discovered. The whole matter\nis much more complicated than the superficial appearance would\nindicate, and that is implied by the perplexities which Dr. Jacks\nremarks. But I suspect that the view, suggested by Swedenborg\nin his doctrine that the next world is a m.ental state, a view\nclosely allied to Kanto-Hegelian idealism, may be a clue to the\nproduction of the appearance, and the objective sense of reality\nin the psychic, with the liability of error in the interpretation\nof the phantasms by the control and the psychic, may suggest\nthe direction in which further study may be made. Compare\nsome of the paradoxic and, to the layman, perplexing statements\nof Raymond in his communications to Sir Oliver Lodge.\n(III.) THE SPIRITUAL VALUE OF NAMES, i -\nBy Dr. F. C. S. Schiller.\nDr. Jacks's problem about the personal appearance of the\ndeparted is as ingenious as is his wont, and worthy of serious\nconsideration by psychical researchers as well as by spiritists.\nI cannot feel, however, that the solution he suggests is quite\nadequate. He argues forcibly that the source of the knowledge\ndisplayed by mediums of the personal appearance of friends\nof the sitters must come from the sitters' minds, because the\ndescriptions are not such as spirits could give of themselves,\n\fOct., 1918. Personal Appearance of the Departed. 223\nand because there is often great difficulty about giving the names.\nBut is it not equally surprising on his theory that this difficulty\nshould exist ? The sitter's mind can, it seems, supply the medium's\nwith the most minute and detailed accounts of a departed friend's\nappearance, and yet it too boggles over the name of the friend\nwhom it remembers so well.\nI would venture, therefore, upon a tentative suggestion that\nthe '\nbuilding-up ' theory might be modified to meet the case.\nIt is doubtless true that in general we are ignorant of, or deluded\nabout, our personal appearance. But who are '\nwe ' ? Plainly\nthe self Dr. Jacks convicts of ignorance is the conscious self.\nAnd, as plainly, there is more to us than that. There is within\nus that which not only knows, but also moulds, our personal\nappearance. It is this power which forms our whole body, and\nremembers to grow again \" the bit of hair sticking out at the\nback of the head,\" however often the conscious self has it ampu-\ntated by the hairdresser's ruthless shears. Might we not then\nascribe to it the power of communicating with the subconscious\nregions of the medium's mind, which the evidence seems to\ndemand ? True we know but little as yet about this '\npart ' of\nthe total self, because the conscious self does not control it.\nThe sciences all fight shy of it. Metaphysic has contented itself\nwith barren dialectics about the Self, and has not yet seriously\nraised the question\n\u2014\nWho then am I ? Physiology has only\nexhibited a priori dogmatism by assuming that of course the\nexplanation must be physical. Psychology is only just approaching\nthe experimental study of the self, and beginning to recognize\nthe complex stratification of what the metaphysician took to\nbe a '\nsimple spiritual substance.' Psychical Research is un-\nprejudiced, but still groping. In this case we are doubtless\non the track of something intimate that lives at such a depth\nbelow the line of consciousness as to be profoundly unafiected\nby anything so intellectual as a name, which is plainly a device\nfor dealing with the external relations of an organism with others.\nAnd after all their names sit lightly enough upon even the\nconscious selves, which often enough find it socially expedient,\ncustomary, or honorific to change them. I conclude, then,\nthat, although a natural, it is a mistaken, '\nnominalism '\nto regard\nthe giving of the name as essential to a spiritual identification,\nand an indispensable guarantee of good faith.\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli. Oct., 1918.\nDr. Jacks' article in the June number of the Journal has\nevidently excited great interest, and we have been compelled\nby the limits of our space to select among the letters concerning\nit which we have received. It is, however, with less reluctance\nthat we refrain from printing several as we think that the three\ncommimications printed above cover the greater part of the\nground taken by our correspondents.\nIt is perhaps a little surprising that no one has called attention\nto the fact that the theoretical discussion is, in its essentials,\nnot new to the Society. It necessarily arose in connection with\nthe view of apparitions taken by the authors of Plmntasms of the\nLiving, and much of what Gurney there says about dreams and\nhallucinations generally, bears on the subject. In particular\nparts of the following sections would be found of interest in\nthis connection : the first sections of each of the Chapters VIII.,\nIX., X., XI. ;\nChap. X. \u00a7S 5 and 6 ;\nChap. XII. \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 8\n;\nChap. XVIII. \u00a7 7.\nAny attempt to summarise these passages would be out of\nplace here, but we may very briefly call attention to two points.\nThe appearances seen with closed eyes by mediums\n\u2014\ne.g. Mrs.\nPiper or Mrs. Leonard\u2014are evidently like dream images, which\nas Gurney maintains for reasons given, are of the same nature\nas waking hallucinations. Clearly also these images are for\nthe medium similar in kind whether veridical or non-veridical.\nShe does not distinguish, and no one probably will maintain\nthat they are always veridical. But is not the existence of\nthe non-veridical images a serious objection to Sir Oliver Lodge's\nhypothesis of g'Masi-materialisation ? A valid theory as to the\nnature of these images must surely cover all the cases from\nveridical to non-veridical, and from dream-images to waking\nhallucinations.\nThen again, as regards Dr. Jacks' main point, Gurney shows\nthat just as in a few cases details in telepathic apparitions must\nevidently be contrijbuted by the percipient's mind, so in a few\nothers it is equally clear that they must be derived from the\nagent ;\nthat, as he puts it, {ojp. cit. Chap. XII. \u00a7 8) \"a ready\nmade concrete image, and not a mere idea, has been transferred\nfrom one to the other.\" He recognises the difficulty, urged by Dr.\nJacks, of supposing that the agent has such a definite image of\nhimself in his mind, but thinks that a certain sense of one's\nown aspect probably always exists at the background of conscious-\n\fOct , 1918.

(Editor pro tern.).\nCASES.\nTwo Telepathic Dreams.\nWe have received the following accoimts of two dreams\nfrom an Associate of the Society, who desires to remain\nanonjonous, and whom we will therefore call Mrs. C. As\nMrs. C. points out, they appear to iEustrate two forms of\ntelepathy. In the first there was conscious direction of the\nsupposed agent's thought to the percipient. In the second\nthere seems to have been subconscious leakage. Mrs. C.'s\naccount of the dreams was sent to us on March 11, 1918.\nNo. 1.\nL. 1218.\nIn the early morning of Jan. 13th, 1918, my daughter V.\nhad a vivid dream of Arthur S., an old school-friend of her\nbrother \" G.\" Upon leaving school, this yoimg fellow had gone\nout to Canada where he purchased a clearing and built himself\na shack, and being joined there later by his parents they had\nsettled down on their own homestead for good.\nArthur S. had thus virtually gone out of our lives, though\nhe had written from time to time at rare intervals, the last\noccasion being some two years ago, on the death of his friend\n\" G.\" to whom he was much attached.\nWe knew that neither he nor his brother had been able to join\nthe Army as they were rimning the homestead for their parents,\nand considered this to be their first duty.\nIn her dream, V. saw Arthur S. very clearly, dressed in khaki,\nand was impressed that he had some special news to give us\n\u2014\nshe also heard him say\u2014(by impression), \" But I can never\nforget my old friend '\nG.'\n\"\nOn coming down to breakfast the next day, V. asked us to\n^ess of whom she had dreamt, adding that it was the last person\nwe should ever think of.\nTwo days later, on the 15th Jan., V. received a letter from\nArthur S. dated Jan. 10th, but bearing the post-mark of the\n14th from Seaford, Sussex. In it he told her of his father's\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct.. 1!)18.\ndeath, a year ago, which had set him free to join up ; also\nthat he had lately come to England and had just got married.\nHis letter ended up with these words ; \"I often think of my\nold friend '\nG.' and keep his noble sacrifice before me. I have\nmet a lot of people but I never forget '\nG.' . .\n.\"\nThe dreamer's account, received April 6, 1918, is as follows :\nOn the morning of Jan. 13th, I awoke from a vivid dream\nin which I saw Arthur S. standing in front of me, in khaki-\nHe looked pleased and said he had some important news to\ntell me\u2014giving no details, but I heard him say, \" I can never\nforget my old friend [G].\"\u2014Then I awoke.\nAt breakfast I mentioned my dream without going into details,\nin fact I wanted the others to guess of whom I had dreamt as\nit was a very out of the way person. Mother asked me not\nto give any details imtil the same evening, which I did in the\npresence of my sister.\nThree days later, by the very last post, I received a letter\nfrom Arthur S., dated the 10th, though bearing the postmark of\nthe 14th from Seaford. We were all very surprised to hear\nthat he was in England, that he had joined up and had just\ngot married. Almost the last sentence in his letter contained\nthese words re my brother, \" I often think of my old friend\n[G.]. ... I have met a lot of people, but I never forget [G.].''\n[Signed with full name.]\nlu reply to questions, Mrs. C. wrote on April 4, 1918 :\n(1) The dreamer can think of nothing which could have recalled\nArthur S. to her memory about the time of her dream. She\nbelieved him then to be in Canada \" for good,\" and had neither\nheard of or from him for close on two years. [She had, so\nMrs. C. informs us, sent him as usual a Christmas card or greeting\nto Canada in December.] She has never, to her knowledge,\ndreamed of him before, and had no personal interest in him\nbeyond the fact of his past friendship with her brother.\n(2) The dream was not recorded by me until the next day,\nMonday, in the hope of further details coming through.\n(3) It is my usual practice to jot down rough notes of any\ndream of interest on first hearing it, as we are constantly getting\nthem.\n(4) At my request, the full account of the dream was not\n\fOct., 1918.

Said he would never forget his old\nfriend, [G.].\"\nMrs. and Miss C. have kindly allowed Mrs. Sido\\vick to\nsee the letter from Arthur S., so that she can corroborate\nthe accuracy of the quotation from it and its date, January 10,\n1918. Unfortunately the envelope is torn, and the postmark\nno longer visible. Mrs. Sidgv.dck has also seen the diary, or\nrather note book, and verified the quotation.\nNo. 2.\nL. 1219.\nOn Jan. 16th, 1918, I spent the afternoon with an old friend,\nMme. R., who lives alone at the top of a high block of flats ; and\nwho, in spite of frail health, and enforced seclusion, still takes\nthe liveliest interest in the outer world and its doings. In the\ncourse of our conversation, my friend asked me if I remembered\nDr. X., to whom she had introduced me more than a year ago,\nand who had since married. She then told me that she had\nseen a good deal of his wife, who had been with her one afternoon\nwhen a bad air-raid suddenly commenced. Greatly alarmed, Mrs. X.\nhad hurried home but was taken ill on arrival there, and very\nsoon after, gave birth\u2014prematurely\u2014to twins, while the raid\nwas still in progress. I did not mention a word of this to anyone\non my return home ; in fact the whole story went completely\nout of my mind, so many other topics having been touched\nupon by Mme. R. later.\nThe next morning, my daughter V. told me that she had\nhad such a strange dream. She thought that there was a very\nbad air-raid going on, which she and I seemed to be watching\nfrom the windows of a very lofty room, and in her arms was\na very tiny baby wrapped in blankets which I was helping her\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

There Vv'as only one other occupant of the room, a\nwoman, who was walking up and down carrying another small\ninfant, also wrapped in blankets.\nAll the time V. was vividly conscious of the noise of the\nair-raid and of the flashes of light, etc., from the big windows,\ncombined with a feeling of intense alarm.\nThe dreamer's account of this second dream was received\nby us on April 6, 1918, as follows :\nOn Wednesday, the 16th Jan., I dreamt as follows :\n*\"\nThere was a dreadful air-raid in progress. Mother and 1 were\nin a lofty building watching it and at the same time attending\nto a very tiny baby, which I was holding in my arms, wrapped\nin a blanket.\nThere was also another woman in the room carrying a tiny\nbaby, and she seemed very agitated as she walked up and down\nwith it.\nIn my dream the raid was very bad, and I could see flashes\nof light on the windows and was nearly deafened with the noise\nof guns and the humming of the aeroplanes. I remember feeling\nterrified at the time, as it was quite the worst raid I had ever\nbeen in. I told mother this the next morning, when she at\nonce said, \" Oh, but this is what Mme. E. told me when I was\nwith her yesterday.\"'\n[Signed with full name.]\nIn reply to enquiries. Mine. K. has Idndly written to us\nconfirming the fact of her having told Mrs. C, when she\ncalled about the middle of January, of the premature birth\nin December of Mrs. X.'s twins, in consec[uence of an air\nraid. She writes :\nMrs. X. called on me on or about the 20th of December last.\nThis lady was in delicate health, and very frightened of the air raids.\nShe hoped there would be no raid as she felt rather poorly, but\nunfortunately next day a raid did take place and my poor friend\nwas taken ill direttly During the night twins were born,\nand as they were so long before their time things were not all\nready.

Their names and addresses are given above.\nThe Monthly Accounts for July, August, and September, 1918,\nwere presented and taken as read.\nHALLUCINATORY AND OTHER EXPERIENCES\nOF A YOUNG CHILD.\nThe following notes of her child's sayings, sent to us in April,\n1918, by an Associate of the Society, are not offered as\nevidence of telepathy, though there are certainly indications\nthat telepathy occurred, and even that there may have been\ncommunication from the dead. We print the narrative chiefly\nas an interesting record of what a child said between the ages\nof 2{ and ^\\ about her experiences, noted at the tune by her\nmother. Such a record, consecutive and careful, cannot but be\nvaluable. The present one seems to exemplify three things,\nwhich there is otherwise reason to suspect are fairly common\nin quite healthy children, namely (1) liability to sensory hallu-\ncinations, (2) possession of telepathic powers, (3) the tendency\nof a child's hallucinations to take a grotesque form either as\nto appearance or position\u2014a form, that is, not in accordance\nwith ordinary experience of external things. On this last point\nsee the \" Report on the Census of Plallucinations \" {Proceedings,\nVol. X., pp. 1-J9, 150), where the fact is attributed to a child's\nidea of what is likely to occur bemg less clearly formed than\nthat of adults. As to the fii-st two pomts, there are, so far\nas we are aware, no statistics available. One can only judge,\nfrom what mothers tell one as to the matter-of-fact way in\nwhich children accept what seem to be waking hallucinations\nof the senses, that these experiences are hi some cases more\nor less habitual, just as dreams are.^ And sunilarly as regards\ntelepathy, the instances one hears of from time to time give\n.one the impression that children would often be very good\n1 In the case here recorded, however, the mother writes that \" the experiences\nare evidently not very freij[ueiit, and always rather surprise \" the child.\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1918.\nsubjects for telepathic experiments if such experiments could be\ntried without risk of doing any harm. A recent instance of a child's\nspontaneous viridical impression was, it will be remembered,\nprinted in the Journal for June with references to other cases.\nThe record, slightly abridged, is as follows :\nD. was aged three years two months when her father was\nkilled in October, 1916. She was not told anything about it for\nmore than a year afterwards, so that most of the experiences I\nam recording happened before she knew of his death, and she\nthought of him always as in France\n\u2014\" taking care of soldiei's.\"\nThis was all she knew about the war.\nShe is quite a normal child, very observant, a great sense of\nhumour, excellent health from babyhood, not at all precocious,\nexcept in being rather more articulate than most children of her\nage, so that she has been able to express herself\u2014has told me\nwhat she saw. Probably most children are just as much aware of\nthe unseen world at that age, when their minds are so fresh. . . .\nBut then not all children at the age of three are able or arc\nsufficiently interested in their impressions to express them. So that\nit may be of some value and interest to record the things she\nhas said to me.\nNoil. 1915. Once or twice before his death, when he was away,\nshe had said things to me about what he was doing and thinking\nwhich afterwards seemed to me, on gettmg his letters, to be\ncases of telej)athy, and before she was three used to tell me of\n\" people moving on the ceiling, all colours,\" as she lay in bed.\n1 was going to the station with her one day in March, 1916,\nto see her off to the country, as I was going abroad myself, and\nshe drew my attention to a \" red lady, all red,\" who, she said,\nwas with us. I was wearing a red dress, so asked her if she was\nlike me, \" Oh no, Mummy,\" she said, \" yours is a wed dress\u2014this\nlady's all wed, a wed face.\"\nOct. 1916. About a week before his death we were playing in\nthe garden after tea and she suddenly rushed at me in a sort of\npanic (an absolutely unknown thing for her\u2014she did not know\nfear then), and clutching me, said, \" Oh, Mummy, I'm so frightened ;\nyou looked as if you were going to jump over the sun.\" This\nmade an impression on me, and I wondered then what it was she\nhad seen, or if it was only the general sense of eeriness that an\nOctober evening sometimes brings.\nWhen the news came that he was killed, I did not tell her.\nWe went on talking of him and playing at being Daddy, his\nhorses, or his soldiers, as usual. A morning or two after she was\nsitting beside me in bed, before we were called, she was pretending\nto be Daddy and driving his horses. The room half-dark, before\nthe curtains were drawn. Suddenly she remarked, looking up,\n\" There's the real Daddy on the ceiling,\" reflectively adding, \" It\nlooks like him, anyhow.\" I accepted it as a matter of fact, as\n\fNov., 1918. Hallucinatory avd other Experiencef<. 233\nI did not want to make her think it was anything extraordinary,\nor clever of her to see him. She did not seem to want to talk\nabout it.\nThe next night I was lying, between sleep and waking, a sort\nof state that was frequent with me just then. I fancied\u2014fancy\nis not the right word, but it is almost impossible to find the right\nword for such a state ;\ndirectly one tries to translate such an\nintangible sensation into words it becomes in a sense untrue\n\u2014\nit was a sort of nebulous consciousness ; a \" sensing \" of something\nunseen\n\u2014\nnot a vision or a dream. I fancied, then, that two people\nstood beside my bed, and that they were discussing together\nwhether I could be taken over to him, or whether I must live on.\nI wanted to share his inteuser life, and go too, and I had never\nhad a qualm about leaving D. Then D. said, quite naturally, and\nin her sleep, \" You wont go away from me, will you, Mummy ?\n\"\nOne morning, again on waking beside me, she said she \" saw\nDaddy upside down\" and was much exercised in her mind at this\nimusual position.\nI may say that I knew nothing of spiritualism\u2014rather hated\nits jargon\u2014had never read a book about it, and rather laughed\nat it. Even now I was afraid to read a book for fear it might\nobscure or muddle my ovra sensations of the unseen.\nAfter that we moved to London, where D. slept with me till my baby\nboy was born\u2014about a month later. During that time (Jan. 1917)\nshe saw \" Daddy's boot \" on the wall ; another day \" a little\nblack man on the ceiling.\" Yet another day \" There's a red lady,\nlike fire, all red, coming down on me ; I hope she wont come\nright dovm,\" with a little gasp of apprehension. She never seems\nat all inclined to talk about the things she has seen, and I do\nnot question her. I just accepted what she told me, and we\nwondered together why I could not see them too. I had thought\nperhaps her visions of her father might be the result of telepathy,\nfrom my own thoughts of him, but I certainly had never enter-\ntained any thoughts of the coloured lady and gentleman mentioned\nabove.\nAfter my son was born I did not have D. in my room at\nnight, and had not so much opportunity of hearing of anything\nshe might have seen. In July, 1917, she was very ill for three\ndays after an anaesthetic, in London, and was nursed by \"N.,\"\nmy old nurse, not her own Nanny. When she recovered we went\ndown to C\u2014\u2014,\nleaving N. in London. She was playing in the\norchard with me ; I was sitting on the grass, she on my lap.\nSuddenly she looked up and then said, \" I saw N. there, do\nyou know. Mummy, looking over your shoulder\u2014like Daddy.\" I\nasked her what she looked like. \" Oh you know N., Mummy, purple\nhat, purple dress,\" rather impatient with me for such an absurd\nquestion. The following week I saw \" N.,\" who told me how very\nanxious she had been about D., and unable to get the thought of\nher out of her head (though, of course, she was perfectly well again).\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1918.\nAs she was getting older, and I could not help her overhearing\npeople talk, 1 felt I must tell her, beginning gradually in answer to\nsome of her questions in August, 1917, and in October told her\neverything. She was dreadfully upset at the idea of his being\nhurt, more than of anything, and not having him come back\njust the same as before. So from now her attitude is different.\nShe is deeply interested in \" spirits,\" talking constantly of him\nand to him, and speculating as to his being always there, but she\nhas the real scientific attitude, and keeps a perfectly clear line\nbetween her own ideas and fancies and those experiences which\nseem to come from outside her. It was not till Dec. 30 that I\nheard her mention any of the latter sort ; then she said, \" I saio\na sjnrit yesterday. Mummy, when I was having my rest. It was\nDaddy. I didn't know it was him till he said '\nIs that you, D.'\n\"\nThe next day she told me again, and I asked her where he had\nbeen. \" There, hanging over the jug N gave you.\" The jug\nin question was standing on the chest of drawers at the foot of\nthe bed. The convincing things to me this time were [a) her\nsaying \" while I had my rest,\" as we always talked of him at\nnight when we were together, and thought of him as possibly\ncoming then, and (6) her so minutely remembering, or appearing\nto remember, the exact spot where she had seen him.\nOn waking she nearly always said \" Daddy \" the fiist thing.\nOnce when I myself had been feeling very far off him, she said on\nwaking, \" Mummy, we haven't spoken to Daddy.\"\nDec. 1917. Once she asked me why he only came at night. I\nsaid he didn't. I thought he came any time. Perhaps when we\nwere asleep jiart of us would go to him. Yes,\" she said, \" like when\nI think I'm out of bed and I'm really in bed. I often feel like\nthat.\" Query\u2014a dream\u2014or really a sensation.\nReferring some time after to the last time she saw him she\nsaid she was sure she would remember if he talked to her in her\nsleep \" because I remembered before when he came while 1 was\nhaving my rest.\"\nFeb. 2nd, 1918. One night she was lymg talking to me about him.\nSuddenly she said, \" D'you know. Mummy, Daddy's so close to\nme I can't helj) laughing,\" with a sort of little gasp slie always\ngives when something very unexpected occurs. \" I believe he's\ngot right inside me ; don't you feel him. Mummy ? If you got\nright on the top of me he might be able to hug us both.\" \" A\nsort of nasty-nice feeling,\" she said, \" makes me feel crinkly all\nover. I believe' I shall be uncomfortable all night.\"\nFeb. 20. Evidently she had this feeling again to-night. I was\nsinging to her, sitting on the bed, in the dark. She said she\nwanted to talk to Daddy, and began doing so. Then said, \" T don't\nlike him to come too close down to me, it makes me \"\u2014a pause and\ndeep thought\n\u2014\"feel sort of like beginning to be sick.\" I asked her\nhow she knew it was Daddy.

I would also take the opportunity of reminding or\ninforming Members and Associates of the supplementary essay\nof F. W. H. Myers in the same book, which takes the form of a long\nand careful \" Note,\" in the middle of Vol. II., pp. 277-316^\n\" On a suggested mode of psychical interaction.\" Crurney s\nhypothesis attributes the details of a vision or vivid phantasmal\nappearance mainly to the subconscious activitv of the percipient\n:\nwhereas Myers considers that the subconscious activity of the\nagent or person represented, \u2014the person whose apparent presence\nis perceived\u2014has some influence not only in stimulating or bringing\ninto bare existence a dream-like impression, but in clothing it\nwith relevant and informing detail ;\u2014detail which is some cases\niJn reply to enquiries, the mother says: \"Except that since I told her of\nher father's death we have talked of him as being constantly near us, I cannot\nthink of anything I could have said to account for that remark about lier babv\nbrother. ...

I had certainly never\nsaid \u2014or thought\u2014of such a tiling, or anything on whicli she could base it, and\nI am prett}' certain that neither her nurse or any of the servants\u2014the only otlier\npeople she was in contact with\u2014could have suggested anj^thing of the sort.'\"\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1918.\ncould hardly be reclaimed from the latent memory, or developed\nout of the past experience, of the percipient or seer of the vision.\nMyers postulates in fact some \" phantasmogenetic efficacy\n\"\nof the agent, aldn to what is testified to in the comparatively\nrare but very interesting reciprocal cases of \" travelling clair-\nvoyance.\" He styles the agent-percipient, who is clairvoyant\nand at the same time is impressing himself on those he is\nperceiving, \" the clairvoyant invader.\" And by thus postulating\na real transmitting agency, such as may operate not only on\nthe mind of one percipient but on the minds of several people\nall present together, he considers it possible to evade the many\ndifficulties which surround the postulation of any kind of objective\nreality for the phantasm\u2014a reality which group-percipience super-\nficially suggests\u2014without having recourse to the unproven\nassumption of mere contagious liallucination among otherwise\npassive percipients. For this lie thinks, even if granted, would\nsometimes fail to explain the facts.\nIt is clear that in this chapter Myers does not contemplate\nwith favour the semi-materialistic hypothesis tentatively and\napologetically supported' in my letter '\nto the Journal, October\n1918 ; he seeks to interpret the facts as mental impressions only ;\nbut at present I am unable to form a clear conception of how\na purely mental impression, without any kind of objective reality\neven of an ethereal character, would fulfil the conditions required\nand satisfy the facts recorded in the many narratives, contained\nin that industriously filled storehouse, Phantasms of the Ldving,\non which he bases his appeal. \u2014Yours faithfully, Oliver Lodge.\nDONATIONS TOWARDS THE INCREASED COST\nOF PRINTING.\nMiss X. \u2022 \u00a350 0 0\nMrs. Pumphrey - - - - - 10 0 0\nHubert Wales, Esq. - - - - 10 0 0\nMiss Florence Upton - - -\n3 3 0\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall 2 2 0\nMrs. Campbell ... -\n1 19 0\nE.

Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., gave an address on\n\" Ether and Matter, and their possible psychical bearings.\"\nHe explained his view concerning the Ether of Space and\nthe physical phenomena for which it was responsible. He\nclaimed it as the coimecting link uniting the planets into a\nsolar system, and uniting the particles of a body by cohesion\ninto a coherent whole. He considers that matter only possesses\nkinetic energy, and that the ether possesses all the static\nenergy\u2014sometmaes misleadingly called potential energy, the\nmeaning of which is that it is potentially kinetic. This ether\nenergy is the energy of strain and stress as opposed to the\nenergy of motion. Matter alone moves ; ether alone is\nstrained.\nThe consideration of a body is incomplete unless both its\nmaterial and etherial portions or aspects are taken into account.\nWe are apt to attend to the one and ignore the other,\nbecause of the sense organs we happen to possess, on which\nthe ether makes no impression.\nReverting to animated bodies, he made a surmise or specu-\nlation that the psychic interaction which conspicuously occurred\nwith matter might also occur in connexion with the etherial\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1918.\nconcomitant ; and that if that were so, the etherial portion\nwould be more likely to be permanent than the material,\nsince all imperfections\u2014fatigue and wearing out\u2014belong to\nmatter, not to ether.\nHe further hazards the view that the categories of philo-\nsophy have so far been incomplete, inasmuch as they include\nmind and matter without explicit reference to the third\nelement, the ether, as an essential ingredient of totality\n;\nand he conceives that the introduction and the working out\nof the ether's full significance, in both psychics and physics,\nis a task which now lies immediately ahead. At any rate\nhe proposes this as a working hypothesis. It may turn out\nthat the ether has no psychic significance. On the other\nhand, it may\u2014as the authors of \" The Unseen Universe\n\"\n(Professors Tait and Balfour Stewart) surmised half a century\nago\u2014have a great deal ; for it seems to him unlikely that in\nthe course of evolution mind shall have associated itself only\nwith matter and not made any use of the omnipresent con-\nnecting medium\u2014the Ether of Space.\nIf life and mind have made use of the ether in the\nsmallest degree, they have probably used it extensively ; and\nSir Oliver suggests\u2014at present only as a pure speculation\u2014\n\u2022\nthat perhaps the term \" spiritual body \" may acquire a semi-\nmaterial or concrete significance, and that the term \" soul\n\"\nmay be capable of being used with a far more definite con-\nnotation than hitherto.\nHe thmks it possible that some indistinct glimmerings of\nthis idea are to be found in ancient writings, especially in\nthose of some of the Fathers of the Alexandrian School, such\nas Origen.\nThe Address was followed by a brief discussion.\nOBITUARY.\nBishop Boyd Carpenter.\nThrough the death, on October 26th, of Bishop Boyd Car-\npenter, one of our Vice-Presidents, the Society for Psychical\nResearch has to mourn the loss of a valued supporter. It\n\fDec, 1918. Obituary: Bishop Boyd Carpenter 239\nwas in 1885, while he was Bishop of Ripon, when the\nSociety had been in existence only three years, that he accepted\nthe Vice-Presidentship, and he held it for thirty-three years\nuntil his death, except during the year 1912, when he filled\nthe more responsible office of President. His other avocations\nnaturally prevented his giving the time and attention required\nfor active prosecution of the investigations on which the\nSociety is engaged, but he was genuinely interested in our\nwork and approved of our methods, and this is clearly\nexpressed in his suggestive Presidential Address, delivered in\nMay 1912 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXVI.). He regarded the\nextended knowledge of the powers and working of our psychical\nnature, which the labours of our Society have produced and\nare producing, as of great practical as well as theoretic impor-\ntance, and his support through all these years has undoubtedly\nbeen of great value to us.\nP. 290. CASE.\nWe are indebted for the following case of successful prophecy\nto Lieutenant W. Whately Smith, a Member of the Society, who\nhas also furnished the appended discussion of the case.\nStatement by Capt. X.\" R.E.\nIn August 1913 I met a Belgian lady, a native of Brussels,\nat the house of some mutual friends. This lady was reputed\nto have had some remarkable successes in forecasting events con-\ncerning her friends and acquaintances.\nOn this occasion she made the following statements with regard\nto myself.\nFirst, that in November of the same year, I should meet\nand become engaged to a lady whom she described.\nSecondly, that in January 191.5 I should become an officer in\nthe British Army on account of a war with Germany.\nThirdly, that I should be married shortly after I became an\nofficer.\nFomthly, that I should come to France \" to fight the Germans \"\nin November 1916.\nBeing very sceptical of this sort of thing I noted the above\nstatements in my diary at the time.\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1918.\nAll of them subsequently proved to be correct in practice.\nThat is to say :\n\u2014\nFirst, in November 1913 I met and became engaged to a lady\nanswering closely to the description given. This lady was entirely\nunknown either to me or to the Belgian lady in August 1913.\nSecondly, I was gazetted to a commission in January 1915.\nThirdly, I was married in August 1915. . .\nFourthly, I came out to France in November 1916.\nThe above is a correct report of the statement made by me on\nMay 25th, 1918. (Signed by Capt. X.\")\nMr. Whateley Smith writes:\u2014\nI think that the [above] case of apparent prevision,\" which\nhas just come under my notice, might prove of sufficient interest\nto Members of the Society to warrant [its appearance] in the\nJournal.\nThe narrator is personally known to me, and I consider that\nhis statement is likely to be reliable. I enclose a copy and\nam keeping the original signed by the narrator.\nI do not think that it would be feasible under existing condi-\ntions to obtain much in the way of corroborative evidence from\nthird parties.\nBy way of comment on this case I think the following points\nare worth noting.\n(i.) The description of Capt. \" X.'s \" future fiancee is practically\nvalueless. It is very diflicult to describe anyone unmistakeably\nunless they possess some unusually striking characteristics. As\nfar as general appearance is concerned, this might, in such a\ncase, easily be guessed by a shrewd observer.\n(ii.) The bare prophecy of a war with Germany goes for very\nlittle. Many people were convinced that such a war was inevit-\nable, and it is reasonable to suppose that a native of Brussels\nmight have German acquaintances, etc., which would leave little\ndoubt in her mind on the point.\n(iii.) The dates on the other hand are of considerable interest, and\nI think that this is one of the cases where it is possible to make\na fair estimate of the probability of the whole thing being due\nto mere guesswork. ^\n'In reply to enquiries Mr. Wliately Smith adds: \"I think there is no\ndoubt that the items mentioned were the only ones prophesied, at any rate\n\fDec, 1918. Case. 241\nI suggest that one might reasonably assess the various pro-\nbabilities as follows :\nFirst.\u2014The lady to whom Capt. \" X.\" subsequently became\nengaged was directly implied, and later proved to be, someone\nwhom he had not met in August 1913. His age at that time\nwould be about 26. He was married two years later. 1 should\njudge that of men married at 28, the considerable majority\nhave met their future wives before the age of 26. I suggest\ntherefore that it would be fair to estimate the chance of guessing\ncorrectly that Capt. \"X.\"' had not yet met his future fiancee\nas 7} or less\u2014but say \\ to be on the safe side.\nSecondly.\u2014We may suppose that a shrewd and sensitive observer\nmight possibly surmise that Captain \"X.\" was sufficiently inclined\nto marriage as such as to make it probable that he would become\nengaged to someone within a period of, say, 6 months. I do\nnot think it likely that such surmise could narrow the period\ndown much below that. On this assumption the chance of\nguessing the month correctly would be i. If we do not admit\nthe possibility of such a surmise the chance is of course much\nless.\nThirdly, we may reasonably suppose that from the evidence\navailable to her, the Belgian lady might forecast the outbreak\nof war correct within, say, 3 years. She would probably assume\nthat Capt. \" X.\" would be the sort of person who would get a\ncommission shortly after the outbreak of war, and so the chance\nof her guessing correctly the month of Gazette would be about J^..\nFourthly, she might reasonably assume that most oflicers would\ngo out to France within a year of being gazetted\u2014which would\nmake the chance of guessing the month of going overseas correctly\nFifthly, on the assumption that the average engagement lasts\n\\h years, and that the \" median \" of the curve of frequency\n-\ndistribution of length of engagement comes before the mean\n\u2014\nwhich on the whole seems probable\u2014the chance of guessing\nthat Capt. \" X.\" would be married more than 1| years after\nbecoming engaged would certainly not be more than |. I think,\nvery likely less, but in the absence of statistics let us say I.\nthe only ones remtmhered by [Captain X.]. I 'cross-examined' him fairly\nclosely and urged him to give me all possible details and I am pretty sure\nthat if there had been anything else which he had noted I should have\nelicited it.\"\n\f242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1918.\nThe chance of getting all these guesses right will be the product\nof the chances of the individual guesses. .\n\u2014 1 V 1 V 1 V 1 y ^ \u2014 1 \u2022\n~ -Z\n^ 6 -^36 ^ 12''^ -J\"\" TCTSfi 8 '\nin other words, the odds are 10,367 to 1 against the correct\nforecasts being the result of pure guesswork even when aided by\nthe very considerable degree of acumen and information which I\nhave supposed to exist.\nThese odds should be discounted to an extent which I suggest\nmight well be 33i j^er cent, to allow for the fact that the state-\nment, although made by a reliable witness, is not supported by\ncorroborative testimony from third persons. '\n'\nThis will reduce the odds against such a result being obtained\nby pure guessing to 6911 to 1, i.e. the chance of guessing right\nbecomes gnVo.\nIt should carefully be noted that this result does not by any\nmeans imply that the odds are 6911 to 1 in favour of this case\nbeing due to true prevision. These odds are dependent also\nupon the estimated a priori jDrobability of prevision as such.\nThis a priori probability refers of course to our estimate of the\nprobability of prevision, based on evidence received prior to the\nparticular piece of evidence under discussion. This is very\ndifficult to assess, but the following illustration\u2014for which I am\nindebted to my friend Mr. W. Hope-Jones\u2014shows clearly how\nit operates.\nSuppose that the chance of a person winning at a given\nfair throw at roulette = \" a.\" Let the a priori probability of his\npossessing a reliable \" crib,\" telling him what will win next, be\n\" &.\"\nThen before he plays we have four combinations of events to\nconsider :\n(i) He has the \" crib \" and wins. The chance of this is \" 6.\"\n(ii) \u201e \u201e \u201e loses. \u201e \u201e \u201e 0. .\n(Because the \" crib \" is, ex hypothesi, reliable.)\n(iii) He has no such \" crib \" and wins. The chance of this is\nu{l-b).\n(iv) ,, ,, ,. ,, loses. The chance of this is\n(l-a)(l-6).\nThat is to say, his total chance of winning is a + b - ab.\nAfter it is observed that he has actually won, the possibility\nof (iv) disappears.\n\fDec, 1918. Case. 243\nThe probabilities of (i) and (iii) retain their original ratio to each\nother, but their sum must grow till it is equal to 1.\nThey now assume the values\nr\u2014, , from (i)\nand \u2014 from (iii)\na + b-ab ^\n'\nThe former of these represents the probability of his having\nhad the \" crib and winning, that is to say (since he has won)\nthe a posteriari probability of his having had the \" crib.\"\nIf a and b are both small fractions this expression = -f , so that\nthe chance of his not having had the \" crib \" becomes\na + b a + b'\nThat is, the odds are a to & against his possession of the \"crib.\"\nIn the above case of apparent prevision (' = -gTri^- Therefore\nin order to conclude that such a case is equally likely to be\nexplicable by true prevision as by coincidence we must suppose\nthe a priori probability of prevision to be not less than eA--\nI imagine that most people would estimate this a priori pro-\nbability at a considerably smaller figure.\nThis discussion is quite disproportionate to the intrinsic impor-\ntance of the case, nor do I wish to give the impression of\nplacing any great reliance on the tentative estimates I have made\nof the various chances involved. I have discussed it at this\nlength mainly because of the opportunities it offered for exemplify-\ning methods of treatment which may profitably be applied to\ncases of prevision in general.\nW. Whately Smith.\nMay 21th, 1918.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe following letter concerning Dr. Jack's article in the June\nJournal on The Personal Appearance of the Departed, has\nrecently reached us from Miss Sellers, an Associate of the\nSociety residing in India. Though it to some extent repeats\nwhat has been said by other correspondents, we make no\napology for inserting, it, because we feel sure that our readers\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, dec, 1918.\nwill agree that the dreams with which Miss Sellers illustrates\nher hypothesis are apposite and suggestive.\nMadam,\u2014When I read Dr. Jack's article in the June Journal\non \" The Personal Appearance of the Departed as Described by\nControls,\" I knew that five years ago I should have agreed with\nevery statement in the article, but now I am not so sure that\n\" pictures in people's minds \" are so simple an explanation for\nout-of-the-way happenings as I used to think.\nIt is certainly inconceivable that our friends continue inde-\nfinitely with the same bodies and clothes that they had at or\nnear the time of death, and Dr. Jack's argument, that no one\nknows his own appearance sufliciently to be able to build himself\nup from memory, must be apparent to all ; but the fact that\nthe supposed spirits are frequently unable to spell their own\nnames, does not seem to me to be so much an argument against\nthe theory that the appearances are really the s^Dirits of the\ndeparted, as against the theory that they are pictures in the\nsitter's mind, for we do not know how much or what kind of\nknowledge is carried over, but we do know that the sitter has\nnot forgotten how to spell his friend's name, and we might say\nof him also, that if from memory he can impress the mind of\nthe control with his friend's appearance, he surely can perform\nwhat seems the much simpler feat of impressing the spelling\nof his friend's name, which we know he remembers.\nWhen I was a young girl, a lady told me that she and a\nfavourite sister had made a compact that whichever died first\nshould, if possible, return and tell the other about the spirit\nlife. The sister died and the lady was sure that she would keep\nher promise, but days passed and she did not come, and then one\nnight when the lady was lying awake, as she thought, her\nsister appeared clad in one of her ordinary dresses, and told\nher she could not explain the new life to her but that she was\nwell and happy.\nTo the lady, the vision, as she called it, was a satisfying\nevidence of her sister's continued existence. I believed in the\nimmortality of the human soul, but I could not believe in the'\nimmortal spirit of her sister's dress ;\nyet for many years I was\nable to satisfy myself with the thought that it was a dream,\nor, in other words, a picture from the lady's mind ; but saying\nthat the experience was \" only a dream \" does not satisfy me now,\nfor I do not know what dreams are.\n\fDec, 1918. Correspondence. 245\nI cannot say that I really believe the theory that I am suggest-\ning, but it presents fewer difficulties to me just now than any\nother. I do believe that there are more possibilities in the\nstudy of dreams than in any other subject in the line of psychic\nresearch, because everybody has at some time had a dream, and\nall know what is meant when we speak of dreams.\nMy theory is that as in dreams we unconsciously take on\ndifferent appearances and clothes according to the time and\npeople we are dreaming about, so spirits may likewise appear,\nwithout any conscious willing or building up, in the forms their\nfriends can recognise. I will illustrate by relating three of my\nown dreams.\n(1) A few mornings ago, I dreamed that a very intimate friend,\nwhom I have not seen for four years, came to see me and arrived\nin the morning before I was up. I did not wait to dress but saw\nher in the night clothes I was really sleeping in. I saw myself\nin a mirror and I looked exactly as I did a few minutes later,\nwhen I did get out of bed. I noted the slight changes the four\nyears had made in my friend's appearance, and we spoke of the\nnew clothes she had had to get on coming from the plains of\nIndia to the hUls.\n(2) Two or three weeks ago I dreamed of being in America\nwith two friends that I have not seen for thirty years. We were\nwalking together in a street of the town in which the three of\nus lived in 1888. We each \" wore \" the bodies we had in that\nyear, and one wore a dress which she had at that time. When\nI wakened I remembered the clothes the others had on, but did\nnot recognise them as clothes I had ever seen in reality. I could\nnot remember my own clothes.\n(3) Several years ago I dreamed that I had just arrived in\nBerlin on a train, with the personal appearance and clothes of\nthe time of my dream, then the scene and time changed, and I\nwas in a house in some other German city in the early part of\nthe eighteenth century. I saw a young lad of eighteen or nine-\nteen, who I knew was the ancestor of my maternal gi-andfather\nand he was that day leaving his German home to go to America.\nAlthough I was conscious of my present life, yet I was not my-\nself in age or appearance, for I was only about twenty years\nold and had blue eyes and fair hair, while in reality I have dark\nhair and eyes, and I was the sister of my emigrating ancestor.\n\f246 Jo^irnal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, i918.\nIn this dream I built up not only myself and the brother, but\nalso the mother and the house, a special feature of the furnishing\nof which was a pipe organ. In the dream, as a daughter of the\nhouse I was playing the organ, but when a memory of my real\nself came to me, I could not go on with the piece, for I do not\nplay any musical instrument. This dream was not a memory\nin any way, for although I knew that my ancestors left Germany\nand went to America in about 1700, yet there is no tradition\nof a young lad leaving his home in which there was a pipe organ,\nnor did I ever hear of any sister being left behind, so I was\nnot even acting a scene I had heard about.\nI have given these three dreams because they show how I\nassumed a different body with corresponding clothes for each\noccasion, the first being reality, the second memory and the\nthird pure fancy which had never existed in my waking thoughts.\nFrom my dreams tlie question has come to me whether dis-\ncarnate spirits may not have the inherent power to be in appear-\nance what they think themselves. I do not present this for any\none's acceptance, I only suggest it as perhaps a possible explana-\ntion. R. A.

(Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent and\nCo., Ltd., London. 1918. Pp. 124. 2s. 6d. net.)\nDr. Davis' object is to \" exj^lain in simple language the various\ntreatments embraced in the term psycho-therapy,\" and in this\nhe has succeeded admirably up to a certain point, but, doubtless\nfrom the fact that his work has been mainly mental suggestion,\nhe leaves the reader with a rather one-sided view of the treat-\nments, and does not lay much stress upon the use of psycho-\nanalysis and re-education. But one must remember that, in\nwriting a small book, the difficulty is to balance the omissions\nand insertions. Dr. Davis' recommendation of the use of\npsycho-therapy and hypnotism in the treatment of paralysis\nis indeed welcome. Whatever the explanation of the success,\nwhether it depends upon opening up a collateral nerve circulation,\nor upon re-vitalistng a possible '\nshock-affected '\narea surrounding\n\fDec, 1918. Reviews. 247\nthe area of injury, there is no doubt that some patients can\nrecover the use of paralysed limbs to a greater extent with the\nhelp of psycho-therapy than without it.\n\" Re-education of the will \" is alhided to, but unfortunately\nthe methods employed are not described, though a considerable\namount of work has been done during the last few years based\n-upon Vittoz' exercises, or other specially devised systems.\nThe need of the co-operation of the patient is dealt with wlien\nspeaking of auto-suggestion, a power that may be as potent for\nevil if abused, as it is creative of good if practised under correct\nconditions. Altogether there is much wise advice, and an appre-\nciation of the advantages and the dangers of psycho-therapv\nin Dr. Davis' book. ^ M C B\nTelergy (The Communion of Souls). By Frank C Constablf\nM.A., Member of the S.P.R. (Kegan, Paul, Trench, Trubner\nand Co., 1918.) Pp. v + 113. 3s. 6d. net.\nThis little book is largely metaphysical. It aims at showing\nm a popular manner that if telepathy be a fact of human ex\nperience, as the author believes, we have, with certain meta-\nphysical assumptions, \" evidential proof, proof from human experience\nthat we exist, transcendent of time and space, as souls \u2022\nand that\ncommunion, transcendent of time and space, exists between us\nall as souls\" (p. 73). To attempt to epitomise or discuss the\nargument in a short notice like the present would be futile\nThe author tells us in a prefatory note that the book is itself\nmainly a synopsis of a larger work. Personality and Telepathy\nwhich he published in 1911, and which was reviewed in th^\nJournal Vol. XV., p. 223. In the same prefatory note he\nhimself summarises the present work for us. He says, \"I begin\nthe book by shewing what reason would appear to lead us to\nassume our really real personality is: we find it in the soul\nI then turn to human experience and try to show that it supports\nthe judgment of reason.\"\nWe cannot but regret that Mr. Constable has called his book\nTelergy^g^vrng the word a sense which in our opinion is almost\nthe reverse of that in which Myers used it. Myers (though not\nalways quite consistently), and most of us who have used it since\nexpressed by it the hypothesis of direct action on the brain or\nnervous system by a spirit other than the owner of the brain-\nthus implying the action of spirit on matter. Mr. Constable\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1918.\nmeans something unconditioned by time and space required to\nexplain telepathy (p. 25)\u2014\" the power in us all which must he\nfor telepathy to exist \" (p. 41). Fortunately he uses the word\nso little in the course of his book that confusion is not likely\nto arise except through the title ; and the general theory expounded\nin the book is useful and suggestive.\nSUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nBooks added to the Library since the last List, Journal, July 1917.\n1\nBaggally (W.
