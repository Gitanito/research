MYERS, in a few introductory remarks, explained that in con-\nsequenoe of reports received from Mr. Hodgson and Professor William\nJames of their sittings with Mrs. Piper-an American trance medium\n-he had arranged with her to oome over to England in November\nlast for a couple of months, which had been spent partly at Cambridge,\npartly in London, and partly at Liverpool.\nPROFESSOR LODGE, who conducted the experiments in Liverpool,\nthen read a report on them. After explaining the mode in which Mrs.\nPiper goes into a trance, more or less at will; the apparent change of\npersonality that takes place, as shown in manner, voice, and seemingly\nin memory; and the knowledge of the sitters' friends, dead and living,\nsometimes shown by the trance personality; he discussed the possible\nways in which that knowledge might be acquired, and the investigations\nhe had made with a view to discovering the true source of it. He dis-\nmissed the view that it might be got up by Mrs. Piper, not only because\nhe shared with all who had a sufficient acquaintance with her to form a\njudgment, a complete belief in her honesty in her normal state, nor\nonly because close observation had revealed no signs whatever of her\n\"getting up\" anything about the sitters, but because the things said were\noften such as she could hardly have learnt, howe,-er much she had\ndesired to do so. There remained the supposition of clever guessing\non the part of the trance-personality and of drawing information from\nthe sitters themselves by questions, &c. This guessing and fishing un-\ndoubtedly went on, especially in unsuccessful sittings, but could not be\nmade to account for information given in successful sittings. This cer- .\ntainly required at least thought-transference to explain it, and Professor\nLodge was inclined to think that thought-transference from the living\nalone could only be made to explain it by much straining.\nMR. LEAF, who is editing the Cambridge and London evidence,\nthen read some portions of his paper. The sittings in Cambridge and\nLondon were less successful than the Liverpool ones. Mr. Leaf was\nnot inclined to think that the evidence before us at present warranted\nour assuming more than thought-transference-though the thoughts\ntransferred were not always consciously in the mind of the sitters at\nthe time.\n[We do not attempt more than this very brief account of the papers\nread, because it would be impossible to do justice to the evidence or the\narguments in an abstract, and it is hoped that the papers will be pub-\n\f268 JOUNutl of Society for P8ychical Resea'rch. [Juue,1890.\nlished in full in the Proceeaitlgs-probably in October, together with\nthe American evidence which Mr. Hodgson is now engaged in putting\ntogether.]\nSome discussion followed. The question was asked whether inquiry\nhad been made as to the truth of the account given of itself by the\ntrance-personality, which calls itself Dr. Phinuit, and claims to have\nbeen a French doctor. The President replied that inquiries had been\nmade, but so far without producing any evidence tending to support\nDr. Phinuit's claim to an independent existence. A lady asked whether\nDr. Phinuit could speak French, to which the President replied in the\nnegative.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT gave some account of experiments of his own\nwith a trance medium-the wife of a country practitioner. She was\nput into a hypnotic trance by her husband holding her hand, and in\nthis trance she answered questions. He had at first thought that\nthought-transference would explain all she told him; but afterwards\nhe had obtained information about illnesses of absent friends which he\nwas quite sure he had never known. In one instance the friend, when\nasked, said that the diagnosis was wrong, but it was confirmed by a\ndoctor whom he consulted. No knowledge was shown by this medium\nconcerning the dead.\nTHE PRESIDENT said that he fully shared the views that had been\nexpressed as to Mrs. Piper's trustworthiness in her normal state. The\nsittings produced very different effects on different sitters. An un-\nsuccessful sitter who experienced nothing but fishing questions and\nguessing, could hardly avoid receiving an unfavourable impression.\nAnd a successful sitter was occasionally more impressed at the moment\nthan on subsequent reflection seemed justified by the facts. He had\nhimself had but very imperfect success in sittings with her-certainly\nnot enough to warrant him in drawing any conclusion apart from the\nevidence of others. He might, however, observe that having tried a\nseries of experiments as to how far \"Dr. Phinuit\" could perceive\nwhat was passing in some other room or house, he thought that the\nresult, though inconclusive, indicated that the kind of experiment\nmight with advantage be repeated.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL. 839 Ad pa Visual.-Unrecognised.\nThe following case, received from Miss Marie Thelemann through\nMr. Fryer, is an interesting example of an unrecognised apparition on\nthe night of a friend's death, followed by a vivid thought of that friend.\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1890.] Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. 269\nIt has, however, the serious-though under the circumstances very\nnatural--evidential weakness, that the experience was neither mentioned\nnor recorded by Miss Thelemann before the news of the death reached\nher.\nIt was in the evening of Friday, the 13th of June, 1884. I was staying in\nan old Manor in Hampshire, and had spent the evening very quietly. At\nabout a quarter to 11 p.m. I went into my bedroom in order to fetch a few\nthings, and I left it agsin without having noticed anything. Abouta quarter\nof an hour afterwards I went back into my room in order to go to bed. As\nit was rather late, the light in the hall had been put out, but I carried a\nlighted candle in my right hand. As soon as I had entered my roomand had\nshut the door, my attention was attracted by a dark shadow standing in the\nniche which was formed at the right hand side close to the door between a\nprotruding wall and my wardrobe. It was the shadow of some tall, slender\nperson, dressed in a long dark gown. I was startled at this unexpected\napparition, and held at once my candle up to look closer at it, when it began\nto move silently across the room toward!! the window farthest from the door.\nA couch and the bed which stood between that niche and the window were\nno obstacles for it, and I saw it vanish when it closely touched the curtains\n(of light coloured chintz), which were drawn. I followed it immediately and\nlooked behind the curtains, but found nothing, the blinds being down and\nthe windows locked. I then looked all over the room, under the bed and in\nevery corner, but discovered nothing that could explain this strange appear-\nance. It was an ,awful sensation to see the shadow move silently and\nsolemnly through the room. In a very excited state of mind I went to bed,\nbut could not sleep. I heard the clock in the hall strike every hour, and\nwhen it struck three in the morning, the thought of a very dear friend\nsuddenly crossed my mind; I imagined that she, too, might perhaps be\nsleepless just then and might be thinking of me. Directly after this I went\nto sleep. I had seen my friend for the last time the summer before in\nGermany, where she lived with her husband. She was thenin perfect health,\nand I had not heard that she had been taken ill. A very short time after\nthat night I received a letter from my friend's husband informing me that his\nwife had died on June 14th at three o'clock in the morning, the very same night\nI had that strange experience.\nMiss Thelemann has given us her friend's name in confidence. She\ninforms us that she has not had any hallucination of the senses on any\nother occasion, but in a letter dated April 14th, 1888, she gives the\nfollowing account of (1) an emotional effect apparently telepathic, and\n(2) a dream which was most probably a l'evival of memory.\nI have had several times forebodings, the most remarkable of which was\nperhaps on Thursday, April 5th, 1882. I was playing croquet with a friend in\nthe afternoon, when at about four o'clock I suddenly felt very sad and unable\nto go on with the game. I went into my room, where I stopped till five,\ncrying bitterly, though perfectly unable to explain to myself my sudden\nfeelings of grief and sorrow. On the followin~ Saturday I heard from my\nDigitized by Google\n\f\u00b7270 JOl(,l'nal of Society for Psychic(tl Research. [June, 1890.\nfather that a dear sister of mine had suddenly been taken dangerously ill,\nand on Sunday morning my father wrote that she had died on that Thursday\nafternoon at five o'clock.\nAlso some dreams I hav:e had have come true. One day I had lost\na pair of studs. The next night I dreamt that they were lying in a\ncertain cupboard, on the second shelf to the right hand side at the back-a\nplace where I should never have thought of looking for them. The first\nthing I did in the morning was to go and open the same cupboard; I put my\nhand to the place I dreamt of, and found my studs.\nAs to my experience of the night preceding the 14th of June, 1884,\nI unfortunately did not tell anyone about it, as I did not attach much\nimportance to it at the time. But I remember perfectly well that it\nhappened on Friday night, by the fact that the following day, Saturday,\nJune 14th, was the birthday of a friend of ours. I am so sorry I cannot find\nthe letter in which my friend's husband informed me of her death, and in\nwhich the time is mentioned. If it was not so painful a subject I would\nwrite to her relations and ask for a statement of the fact. All I can prove\nare a few words which I wrote into my birthday book, when I received\nthe news.\nL.840 Au po Auditory.\nThe following is from Mr. Colchester-Wemyss, late of the Royal\u00b7\nArtillery :-'\nWestbury Court, Westbury-on-Severn.\nIn September, 1874, I was in Brighton and was walking back from the\ntown to a house in Prestonville, where we were staying for the night. Close\nby the old parish church, I fancied I heard my name called and stopped and\nlooked round, but evidently none of the people near had addressed me. It\nwas dusk in the evening, and so satisfied was I that some one had called me\nthat I crossed over the road, looking for the person who called, but found no\none imd went on. an arriving at the house about three-quarters of a mile\ndistant, I found a telegram had arrived announcing that a carriage accident\nhad taken place, that our children were hurt, and that we were to return\nhome at once. My wife, excited and terrified, ran out to the front door,\ncalling out loudly to me by name. This was just the time I heard the voice,\nand, at the time, I was in a noisy crowded street, over half a inile, very\nlikely three-quarters of a mile, distant.\nM. W. COLCHESTER-WEMYSS.\nIn answer to questions, Mr. Colchester-\"remyss says that he was in\nperfectly good health at the time, and in no anxiety of\u00b7 any kind. He\nwas walking alone in the street. This is the only time that he has had\nsuch an experience.\n}Irs. Colchester-Wemyss, ill a letter to a friend dated April 10th,\n1890, confirms her husband's account so far as she is concerned. After\ndescribing how they had come into Brighton fOl' one night, to stay in\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1890.] Journal of Sgciety for P8ychical Resectrch. 271\nStamford-road, Prestonville, and how she felt causelessly anxious about\nthe children, she continues :-\nAll the afternoon we were making ca.lls in Brighton and I should think\nat about 6 or 6.30 I went back with Mrs. -- in a cab, leaving Maynard to\nfollow. \u2022 . . \u00b7When we arrived, the servant came to the door and said\nthere was a telegram for me and that something dreadful had happened.\nThe telegram wlloSfor Maynard, from ourdoctor, and it said that the coachman in\nreturning from the station had taken up our nurse and children, that the horses\nhad bolted, the carriage had been upset and smashed to pieces. He went 011\nto say that I was not to be anxious, as their injuries were but trifling; but\nlong before I came to that I had made up my mind to the worst and could\nIlot believe that they were not seriously hurt, even when Mrs. -- kept on\nsaying, \"Their injuries are but trifling.\" My one idea was to go to them,\nand I kept saying, \"Oh! Maynard, MaYMrd ! where are you 1 Why don't\nyou come 1\" I don't think I ever said it very loud, but, of course, when one is\nin that state of agitation it is impossible to know whether you are shouting\nor whispering. At any rate, he could not by any possibility have heard if I\nhad screamed. At la.st I seized my portmanteau by one end, and the cook took\nthe other, and I ran into the street. I think I must have gone on saying\n\" Oh !Maynard, Mayna.rd !\"-1 am almost sure I did-and I remember I had\nrun out of the house once or twice into the road and said it. When we got\nto the end of the road I tumed down the hill to go to the station, Mrs. --\nwent on along the road by which Maynard would come from the town. She\nsoon met him and told him, and he ran after me, and we ran on together.\nWhen we were in the train, he said, \"Did you call me about 7 0'clock1\" (The\ntrain went at 7.30.) I said, \"I sliould think I did!\" Then he told me what\nhe (has written] to you. [He] always laughs at everything of the kind, but\nhe ha.s never forgotten this and always says it certainly is very strange.\nIf I can tell you more I shall be very glad to do so. I was nearly frantic\nwhenI got that telegram, and I remember how angry I WIloS with poor Mrs.--\nwhen she tried to make me eat, ot: pack my\u00b7 clothes. . . . Every idea\nseemed to be concentrated in that of going to the children, and the longing\nfor Maynard to come to me.\nIn answer to inquiries,l\\Jrs. Colchester-Wemyss tells us that the name\nwhich Mr. Colchester-Wemyss heard was his Christian name, Maynard.\nL. 841 CI. Dream.\nThe following dream suggests something of the nature of telepathic\nclairvoyance :-\nTumours Hall, nr. Chigwell, Essex. J1!ly, 1888.\nStatement by Willism Bass, farm bailiff to Mrs. Palmer:-\nOn the night of Good Friday, 1881, I went to bed at half past 10, and\nvery soon fell asleep. Just before the clock struck one I awoke in violent\nagitation and profuse perspiration. I told my wife I dreamt that something\nwas wrong at the farni stables, and I was so convinced it was the fact that\nI should get up at once and go there. She persuaded me to lie down again\n(I was sitting up in bed and the night was cold). Still 1 could not rest. At\nDigitized by Google\n\f272 Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. [June,1890.\na quarter to two I dressed hastily, and taking a lamp and matches with\nme went as fast as I could to the stables (distant about a third of a mile). I\nat once perceived the place had been broken into and that a grey mare had\nbeen stolen. From appearances where the mare had lain I judged she had\nbeen taken away about two hours previously.\nWILLIAH BASS.\nMr. J. B. Surgey, enclosing this account, writes as follows:-\n22, Holland-street, Kensington. July 9th, 1888.\nDEAR MR. MYERS,-Probablya few lines will be acceptable to you beyond\nthose to which William Ba.ss has signed his name. Before being employed\nas ba.iliff he was coachman at Turnours Hall, and has been 32 years in\nhis place-a thoroughly trustworthy, straightforward, and the most unimagi-\nnative, matter-of-fact fellow conceivable. Before his dream of Good Friday,\n1884, he was never known to speak of one. I had all particulars of it\nalmost immediately, but only jotted them down last week. I asked if he\ncould guess how long he had been dreaming when he awoke. No, not\npossible to guess; but he was in a horrible fright and his shirt was \"dripping\"\nwith perspiration, by which he supposed he might have been in a state of\nexcitement a good while.-Very truly yours,\nJ. B. SURGEY.\nMr. Bass has recently been int,erviewed by Mr. Barkworth, who\nwrites:-\nApril 18th, 1890.\nWilliam Bass confirmed his previous evidence to me this day.\nAbout the time when the incident occurred (and for a long while after-\nwards) systematic horse stealing had gone on in the neighbourhood, but Bass\nhas no recollection of being specially anxious about this. Pressed as to the\ndetails of the dream, he recollected that he saw the horses in the dream, and\nhad a vivid impression of \"something wrong,\" but what it was he did not\nknow. Although thus vague, the impression was so strong as to be irresistible,\nso that although his wife begged him to go to sleep &gain, he lay awake for\nabout 11 hours until he could bear it no longer, when he got up and went to\nthe stable.\nHis wife confirmed all this, particularly as to his having twice said there\nwas something wrong in the stable and he must go and see to it. He had\nalways reproached her since with having prevented his going to the stable\nwhen he first woke.\nBass states he is not in the habit of dreaming. Pressed as to any previous\nexperience of the kind, he said that about 20 years ago he dreamt he saw hi.\nfather dead. The father who was quite well at the time died suddenly 10\ndays afterwards.\nOn the evening before the horse was stolen, he had heard a cart driven\nby very fast. The neighbourhood is so lonely that anything unusual is\nremarked upon, and he said to his wife, \"There is something wrong.\" He\nhad made the same remark on previous occasions when a vehicle was driven\nrapidly by.\nWhen he interviewed the police in Scotland Yard, they asked him how\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune,1890.] Journal of Society for P8ychical Re,search. 273\nhe knew the horse had been stolen ill the middle of the night, and when he\ntold his dream they ridiculed him, and evidently suspected complicity on his\npart. Mr. Bass is a most respectable man, well known and esteemed in the\nparish. He has lived in his present situation for many years.\nT. B.\nCLASSIFICATION OF CASES RECEIVED BY THE\nLITERARY COMMITTEE.\nAs we find that many members of the Society are unaware how the\nevidence received is dealt with by the Literary Committee, we propose here\nbriell.y to explain our plan, as a preface to a catalogue of cases which for\nvarious reasons we do not print at length.\nWhen the Literary Committee was first instituted, its members found it\na.lmost impossible to study satisfactorily ill manuscript the mass of evidence\nthat came in. To meet this difficulty some members of the Committee for a\ntime supplied the funds necesssry for printing on slips all the cases which\nseemed worthy of consideration. The original documents were, of course,\nalso retained, and are stored at the rooms of the Society.\nFor convenience the cases were roughly classified under the heads L, M,\nP, G, and S, and were numbered.\nL stands for Phantasms of the Living, and the class includes any\nphantasm, &c., coinciding with some event with which it appears to be\nconnected. It also includes thought-transference in the normal state and\nspontaneous telepathic clairvoyance. But automatic writing and table-tilting,\neven if giving messages from living persons, are not included under L, but\nunder M. L cases are often further described by the letters Ad pn equiva-\nlent to \"agent dying, percipient normal,\" or ps \"percipient sleeping,\" or\nAe \"agent excited,\" &c.\nM stands for Mesmerism, and in this class are included psychical phe-\nnomena connected with the hypnotic state and also automatic writing and\nautomatism of all kinds, crystal vision, and induced telepathic clairvoyance j\nclairvoyance proper (meaning by this apparent direct perception of present\nfacts without the intervention either of the senses or of another mind\ncognisant of those facts; e.g., perception of cards enclosed in opaque\nenvelopes and unknown to anyone) is also included under M, except when it\nis associated with the idea of a future event; when it is so associated it is\nincluded under Pas. a premonition, although the seeming premonition can\nbe explained by supposing an extended knowledge of the present.\nP stands for Premonition. Under this head we class premonitions,\nmonitions (or premonitions which by foresight are prevented from coming\ntrue), and, as stated above, such clairvoyance as includes the idea of a\nfuture event.\nG (or \"Ghosts\") includes all apparitions, &c., of dead persons, of\nunrecognised persons, of animals, of lights, and of inanimate objects,\nwhich have some characteristic to distinguish them from purely subjective\nhallucinations, ~ut which yet do not coincide with the death of anyone or with\nsome other occurrence to a living person in such a way as to suggest a con-\nDigitized by Google\n\f274 Journal of Society fm' Psychical Research. [June, 1890.\nnection between the event and the phantasm, and thus to bring it under the\nhead of L.\nS includes the physical phenomena of Spiritualism and things happening\nat Spiritualistic seances other than automatic writing and table-tilting. This\nclass is now in the main handed over to the \"Physical Phenomena\"\nCommittee.\nWe have not, of course, enumerated above every possible variety of\npsychical phenomenon, but we have probably sufficiently indicated the plan\nof classification. It has not, as will be perceived, any claim to be regarded\nas a scientific classification, but it has been found to be on the whole\npractically convenient. Sets of the slips on which the cases were printed\nare kept at the rooms, I\\l1d, with the exception, of co~rse, of those which by\nour informants' desire are kept private, may be studied there by Members\nand Associates.\nIn 1885 the plan of printing cases in the Journal instead of on slips was\nbegun_e JOUl\"'ual Vol. I., p. 245-and by degrees printing on separate slips\nwas discontinued. For a time some cases were type-written, but this also\nhas now been left off. Gradually, too, as the mass of evidence increa~ed, the\nstandard to which a case mustattain before it is considered worth printing at\nall, rose. It is not, for instance, worth while to printL cases manifestly below\nthe evidential standard of Phantasms of the Living, unless they illustrate some\nspecial point. The present plan is to print in the J O1t'\/\"lUll cases which appear\nto one or two members of the Committee to have sufficient interest to be\nworth printing. They are then in a convenient form for study by the -Com-\nmittee, and at the same time are accessible without trouble to all Members\nand Associates of the Society; who may, and sometimes do, criticise them\nor send additional information about them. Printing them in the JOU'\/\"lUlZ\nis not publishing them, and it should be understood that no guarantee by\nthe Literary Committee is implied ill printing them there. They are there\nprimarily for consideration by the Committee. The cases used in Phanta8ms\nuf the Living, or in papers in the P\"uceed-ings have for the most part been\nselected from those on slips or in the JUII'\/\"lUlZ; but in some instances cases\nclearly suitable have been taken at once into the book or papers; this\ncourse having the double advantage of economising the funds of the Society\nand of putting before Members and Associates in the P.ruceedings some\nevidence that has not been already before them in another form. When this\nis done the MSS. of the cases are stored and numbered and catalogued along\nwith those that appear first in the J01tmal, &C.\nNow that the old plans of printing on slips and of type-writing have\nbeen abandoned, it has been found desirable to form a kind of second class of\ncases, consisting of those which it is not at present proposed to print at\nall. These are stored, numbered, and catalogued separately from the others\nand are marked B L, B P, &c., the letters L, P, &c., having the same\nmeanings as in the printed cases. Among the various reasons for placing\ncases in division B rather than printing them may be mentioned (1) Pro-\nhibition by our informants to print; (2) Comparative evidential weakness,\nnotwithstanding which the case may be well worth kebping either as con-\ntaining points which may prove important and instructive from some particular\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1890.] JouNUtl of Society for P8ychicctl Re8ectrch. 275\npoint of view, or as possibly to be improved. Evidential weakness is of differ-\nent kinds; for example, the case may be (a) not at first hand; or (b) remote ;\nor (c) evidence may be wanting to show that the supposed phantasm was not\na real sound or sight; or (d) there may be too great a probability on the\nevidence that the coincidence was due to chance, as with many dreams; or\n(e) the evidence may be incomplete. There is generally some hope that\nfurther evidence may be obtained about incomplete cases at some future\ntime, which may raise them out of class B into the printed class. This\nmight happen, for instance, as regards a case supposed to be coincidental\nthough no evidence as to dates is at present forthcoming; or again, as regards\na single appearance in a haunted house with no information as to its relation\nto other supposed experiences there. Such cases would, generally speaking,\nremainin class B until further evidence reached us.\nAbstracts of a few of the B cases have already been printed recently in the\nJournal. It is proposed to print by degrees in the Jonrno.l a descriptive cata-\nlogue of all of them, both as a convenience to students and as a means of\nobtaining further information, should any of our Members and Associates be\nable to furnish it. The cases themselves, with the exception of private ones,\ncan under certain conditions be studied at the rooms of the Society.\nCATALOGUE OF UNPRINTED CASES.\nB L 1.

HVPNAGOGIQUES.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR,-A letter in the May Jott1\"nrd on the above subject having interested\nme deeply, I am emboldened to address you, and to relate my own experience,\nnow I know that it has a really delightful scientific name.\nDuring my mother's lifetime, she and I often discussed our\" dream-faces,\"\nas we called them, for want of a better name, for we never saw them in our\ndreams, only when lying wide awake with our eyes shut. The faces usually\nmelt into each other in such rapid succession that it is quite impossible to\ndescribe them quickly enough in words-such as \"lovely face, golden hair,\n&c. ; hideous face, glaring eyes, making grimaces, nose long and red ;\npale, cadaverous face, much lined; lawyer's face, wig and spectacles,\" and\nso on indefinitely. Last night, for instance, I had just put out my light,\nwhen I clearly saw, on a black background, a skull. I had the instant\nbefore been thinking of something widely different, and nothing had happened\nall day to bring such an object into my thoughts. In fact, I had not time to\nthit,}.; of it. before it vanished, and in a second was succeeded by a vision of\nangels. They departed as speedily, and were succeeded by the more prosaic\nprocession of \"faces.\" The odd circumstance about these latter is that though\nall are familiar and distinct, as no real face ever is to my short-sighted eyes, I .\ncould not put a name to one. I never see a friend's face, nor that of a well-\nknown personage, though I seem to have seen each face before. My mother saw\nonly \"faces,\" a.nd imagined herself feverish when she did so. I see them at all\ntimes; but have never noticed them if I closed my eyes in the daylight when\nin health. Like your correspondent, I frequently see definite pictures too.\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1890.] Journal of Society for Psychical Resea1'ch. 277\nGlorious sun or moon lighted landscapes, mountains and rivers, grand\ncathedrals, village spires-all of these, too, seem familiar, but I cannot\nremember to have ever seen them in reality. When ill of a fever in 1884, I saw\nexquisite faces and scenes, but instead of melting harmoniously into the next\npicture, a blood-red veil seemed to gradually descend, and to make each\nfeature of face or landscape horrible or grotesque. So painful was this inevit-\nable conclusion that I dreaded closing my eyes. This I remember happened\nin broad daylight, and I described each picture, as it came, to my husband, as\nI have often done since.\nI hope this rather lengthy account will induce others to relate similar\nillusions, with a view to their being scientifically explained. Is it \"such\nstuff as dreams are made of\" 1-1 am, &0.,\nMay 10th, 1890. A. M. W.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCIIICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR,-A letter on \"Illusions Hypnagogiques\" which is printed in the\nlast number of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research has greatly\ninterested me. The faot is that I have had experiences of a similar kind\nalmost as long as I can remember. I have always tried to discover whether\neveryone can see such mental images, or whether it is a characteristicI feature\nof a few persons only; but I have never succeeded in making this point\nperfectly clear to myself.\nI hardly ever Bee any distinct mental images now; but when I was a boy\nof 13 or 14 this faculty of mine was exceedingly developed. Every evening\nafter I had gone to bed and had closed my eyes I began to see images of remark-\nable distinctness which followed each other ceaselessly. These images were\nalways in motion, and there seemed to be some kind of intelligible relation\nbetween them-sometimes at least, I mean. If after having closed my eyes I\nhad seen a flower, I could be perfectly certain that I should see flmve1's for\nsome time, until another class of objects should take their place. As I have\nalready said, these curious images were always in motion, and each of them\nwas comparatively of very little duration.\nAs for the character of these images, so far as I can remember, I used to\nsee flowers oftener than any other objects, and I am unable to account for\nthis, as I have never liked flowers exceedingly. It is true that almost every\nyear I used to spend five or six months in the country, where, of course,\nthere were plenty of flowers. That there was-often at least-a connection\nbetween the objects I had seen during the day and the images I saw every\nevening is for me ce1\u00b7tain. I will give you an instance of this. One evening\nI saw almost all the time dry leaves covering the ground, with stalks of grass\nhere and there. This must be undoubtedly explained by the fact of my\nhaving spent a great part of the day in a forest, where, of course, I had\nhad under my eyes almost all the time the same scene that I saw with closed\neyes in the evening. In other cases stra'!Vberries were the principal object\n. that persistently remained in the field of my mental vision (as I think it\nmust be called), and in that case these ideal strawberries had followed rea!\nones which I had seen and eaten in the course of the day.\n\f278 Jmwnal of Society fur Psychical Research. [June, 1890.\nThe distinctness of these curious images was often striking, and when,\nfor instance, I saw images of my friends and relations, these image!! were\nfar more like the real persons than what I could voluntarily represent\nto myself even if I tried to do so.\nTo show you how unexpected these images could be, I will tell you that\nonce-I think I was then seven or eight years old-I was dreadfully frightened\nby the image of an ugly old woman suddenly appearing before my closed\neyes. I had behaved badly during the day and had been sent to bed early;\nand, so far as I can remember, I considered this image and the fear that\nfollowed its appearance as a punishment which God had sent me for my bad\nbehaviour.\nI must add that I have never had any objective hallucinations, and even\nwhen these mental images continued-as they sometimes did-to flock before\nmy eyes when they were open (in the dark, of course), I always knew them\nperfectly well to be merely subjective and melltal.-I am, dear sir, yours\nvery truly,\nMICHAEL SOLOVOY,\nAssociate of the Society for Psychical Research.\n9, Mohovaia, St. Petersburg.\nApj\u00b7il 28th\/j}IaylOth.\nTo the Editor of the JOlJRNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR,--The letter of \"An Associate\" deserves attention. May I suggest\nthat members of the Society for Psychical Research who are light sleepers\nmight follow out a serie3 of interesting experiments on this subject. Some\n2~ yean ago, in consequence of the pain of a slight surgical operation which\nhurt the nerve3 of one side of my head, I found I could, as it were, watch my\nown dre:l.ms. It seemed as though one\u00b7half of the brain were dreaming\nwhile the other was awake. The effect was like a theatrical representation.\nI noticel that the dreams formed very rapidly, and tried to time them by my\nwatch, but found the effort of looking at the watch prevented my testing the\nquestion (so often mooted) of the length of time occupied in a dream.\nMay I ask these questions :-\n1. What is the cause of the white or light grey light one sees in closing\none's eyes 1 I know many people who notice this light (in rooms perfectly\ndark), and then as sleep comes on first geometrical forms and then figures.\n(Sailors say that these form often into ships on the sea.)\n2. Another point in dreams is, are the figures always complete 1 In light\nsleeping I have tried to notice this. Is not sometimes .only the part\ndeveloped to which we give attention-in fact, do we not often dream of\nbodiless heads or headless bodies?\n3. Taste dreams are in my experience very common (though Borne people\nsay they never experience them). The usual taste SAAms that of fruit. But\ndreams of smelling appear to me to be rare.\nI have noticed the brown sand\" An Associate\" mentions.\nw. S.

The new subject is first ignored,\nthen ridiculed, then hotly opposed, and finally adopted with enthusiasm.\nThe science or practice of hypnotism which has passed through all the pre-\nvious stages seenlS now to be in transition between the two last of those\nnamed. In particular the medical faculty, who ignored Braid and Esdaile,\nand who persecuted Elliotson, have, in France at least, become enthnsiastic\nstudents of hypnotism, and even in England are waking up to its claims\nupon their attention. But this new attitude is accompanied by a very sin-\ngular characteristic. Since the reality and significance of hypnotism can no\nlonger be denied, it is sought to forbid the study of it to non-professional\npersons, without whom it would in all probability have never been discovered.\nAccordingly, in most European countries the medical faculty have succeeded\nin prohibiting the practice ofhypnotism in public, and in some cases I believe\nin private also ; and it is not unlikely that in a short time they will seek to\u00b7\ndo the same in England. It seems to me, therefore, opportune to consider\nthe arguments for legislation.\nThe subject naturally divides itself into two branches, public exhibition.'!\nand private experiments.\n1. I will deal with the latter first, since it is only in private that actual\nabuses of hypnotic influence could occur. The most important objection to\nlegislation against private experiments is its impotence. Practically, no one\ncan be hypnotised for the first time without their consent, and even afterwards\nan involuntary submission is exceedingly rare. But given such consent, how\nis the legal prohibition to be enforced 1 We are never likely in England to\nattain to the spy system of Russia under which anyone is liable to be denounced\nby their own servants to the police; and without such a system nothing can\nprevent two persons from going into a room by themselves, and hypnotising,\nthe one the other, as much as they please. The only effect of legislation, then,\nwould be to impose certsin precautions of secresy upon the practice, which\nwould increase indefinitely its liability to abnse. The only people in fact who\nwould be bound by the law would be those who were ruled by a rather strained\nconscientiousness, and these are not the people that require restriction.\n2. But if the practice of hypnotism cannot be prevented in private, where\nis the good of prohibiting it in public 1 No advantage could be taken of a\nsubject (e.g., a young girl) in public without exciting at once the indignation\nand interference of the spectators. Is it, then, pretended that to familiarise\nthe people publicly with a practice which may be abused on other occasions is to\nrender its abuse more probable 1 The exact contrary is the case. For when\nthe spectators see the helpless, defenceless, and absurd condition to which\nthe professional hypnotist reduces his subjects they will be tallght in the\nmost forcible and practical ma.nner the da.nger of submitting themselves to\nthe opera.tion'! of anyone in whom they ha.ve not grounds of absolute con-\nfidence. Already I have met with persons who object to be hypnotised on\nDigitized by Google\n\f280 Joto'lutl of Society for Psy('hical Rese(trch. [June, 1890.\nthe very natural ground that they \"do not want to be made ridiculous.\"\nBut this objection would never have occurred to them had they not seen\npublic performances.\nIf the apostles of grandmotherly legislation are so anxious to distinguish\nthemselves there is plenty of work for them to do without interfering with\nhypnotism. The indiscriminate sale of revolvers might be stopped, for\ninatance ; scarcely a month passes without someone being murdered with a.\nrevolver. On the other hand I doubt if there has yet been a single case, in\nEngland, of serious abuse of hypnotic influence. Indeed, if we are to legislate\nagainst comparative evils it would be more reasonable to prohibit all young\npersons from dancing after midnight, since it is certain that more injury\nresults to the public health from late hours than is ever likely to be produced\nby hypnotism.\nBut I am aware it may be urged that, apart from criminal or malevolent\nacts, hypnotism is liable to abuse by innocent but ignorant persons meddling\nwith what they imperfectly understand. Most of what I have said above,\nhowever, applies to this argument also. You cannot prevent private experi-\nments, and they are not more liable to produce injury than the family\nmedicine-chest or the family spirit-case. If grown people of sound mind are\nto be judged incapable of taking care of themselves, then the only alternative\niR to keep them under police supervision by night and by day, and make\neverything they eat and everything they do the subject of legal enactment.\nBut what you cannot upon any reasonable grounds justify is to restrain them\nhere and there from any practice on which, for the moment, you can catch the\npublic ear, because it happens to offend the private taste or private judgment\nof individuals.\nTHOMAS BARKWORTH,\nHYPNOTISM AND CRIME.\nProfessor Litlgeois writes as follows to Mr. Walter Leaf, with reRpect to\nthe question raised in the last number of the Proceedings, p. 223: Whether\na criminal hypnotiser might not evade detection, even by the ingenious proceRS\nrecommended by the author, if he protected himself by a suggestion to hiR\ntool that no one but himself could produce the hypnotic state :-\n\"The objection which you raise at the foot of p. 223 is most serious; it\nhad occurred to myself, but I did not wish to state it explicitly. Still it is\nperhaps not impossible to answer it. In two words, this is what I should\nsay.\n\" Noone as yet knows for how long a good somnambule-and it is with\nsuch only that we need trouble ourselves-would remain absolutely amenable\nto a suggestion that no one but the hypnotiRer himself could produce the\nhypnotic sleep. Noone can assert that suggestion in the waking state,\nwithout complete production of sleep, would be for ever impossible with the\nsame subject.\n\"This uncertainty would of itself, it seems to me, be enough to deprive\nthe author of a really criminal suggestion, which had worked successfully, of\nany certainty of impunity.\"\nDigitized by GOL\n\f","_id":468}
