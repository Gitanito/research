SIBLY.\n\f\fA\nKEY to PHYSIC,\nWISDOM is the light of Reafon, and the bond of Peace. It aflimilates\nMan to God, and elevates his mind above unworthy purfuits. It is the\nprincipal excellence which diftinguilhes him from brutes, and the chief\nornament that dignifies his character. Whatever is founded in Wifdom\u2019s laws, de-\nfies the mouldering hand of time, and ranks with immortality. Hence it is that a\nthirft after knowledge is natural to man ; and if the cares and follies of this world\ncould be eftranged from his concerns, his defire of information would be inlepara-\nble from his exiftence. Ignorance and fuperftition may be confidered as the curfe\nof God, which chains its votaries to unworthy objeCts; whilft, on the contrary, wif-\ndom and underflanding provide us with wings, whereby to foar above the earth;\nto contemplate the works of creation\u2014to difeern the myfteries of divinity, and con-\nverfe with angels.\nThe beautiful defeription given by Solomon of his acquirements in wifdom, is\nhighly deierving the attention of all men ; but particularly of thofe who profefs the\nfcience of phyfic, and the cure of fouls. \u201c I prayed, fays Solomon, and under-\nftanding was given me; I called upon God, and the fpirit of Wifdom came to\nme. All good things came with her, and innumerable riches in her hand.\u201d What\ngreater reward could any one defire ? And though the intellectual faculties of all\nmen are not alike ftrong and apt for occult fpeculations *, yet it is manifeft that all\nNo. i. B perfons\nAND THE\nO C C SCIENCES.\n\f2 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nperfons are capable of deriving great improvements from reading ; and, that it is\nnot fo much the want of natural ability, as of induftry and application, that fo ma-\nny men difgrace the image of the Deity, and degrade the venerable profeffions of\nDivinity, Phyfic, and Lav\/.\nIr rarely happens that the want of intellect, or natural endowments of the mind,\nare the rocks on which men fplit in their profeffional character. Indocile and unapt\nindeed mull that man be, whom education, experience, obfervation, reading, or en-\nquiry, will not fet generally right in his progrels through life. Yet, without indufi-\ntry, and an anxious defire of knowledge and improvement, neither education, nor\nall the advantages of natural ability, can fave us from the wreck of error, or the dif-\ngrace of ignorance. Obftinate men, though of the firft capacity in the world, are\na forlorn hope, and often irrecoverably loft, by unadvifedly purfuing the phantom\nof their own brain ; whilft others, enriched by dignity of fenfe, and qualified by\ndepth of underftanding, to form the brighteft characters amongft fociety, furrender\nup their talents for difcernment and enquiry, and content themfelves with taking\nupon truft whatever they fee or hear ;\nparticularly in the praCtice of phyfic \u2022, in the\nlaw \u2022, and in the church. The mifchiefs attendant on this general conduCt of man-\nkind, are great and many ; for by thus implicitly fubfcribing to the vague notions,\nand falle doCtrines of others ; by fhutting their eyes againft the light of reafon and\nenquiry, and refuting to receive the conviction of their own fenfes, they transfer er-\nror from one generation to another, until the unlettered multitude, dazzled by the\nfplendid ignorance of the learned few, become difciples to their miftakes, and make\nerror and enthufiafm an hereditary difeafe.\nHence, then, we fee the necefiity of confulting our own reafon, and employing\nour own underftanding, in the difcrimination of all our temporal and eternal affairs\n\u2022and of aCling and judging for ourfelves on all occafions which immediately regard\nour health, our happinefs, or our life; and under all thofe afflictions and misfor-\ntunes wherewith we ftruggle in this world, in our pafiage to a better ; to one more\nglorious and permanent; the ultimate end and reward of all our labours! Our\nfenfes, on thefe occafions, are ever ready to fupport our endeavours, and perform\ntheir office; and it is unqueftionably the duty of all men to exercife, to improve,\nand employ them. Yet it is aftonifhing in general to fee how diftruftful we are of\nthofe very faculties Nature has given us for our guide, and how fondly we fubmit\nto the opinions of others, whofe nerves cannot feel for us, and whofe judgment is\noften founded upon erroneous principles, and fometimes on no principles at all.\nThis, however, is a conducl; by no means fitted to the dignity and office affigned\nto man ; who being placed at the head of all God\u2019s works upon earth, walking in\nhis\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 3\nhis image, and exercifing dominion over his creatures, is bound to improve that in-\ntellect of reafon and underftanding, whereby he is to govern and diredt them, ac-\ncording to the dictates of truth, of juftice, and of mercy. For this purpofe he ought,\nlike Solomon, to ftudy the occult properties and qualities of all things : \u201cfrom the\ncedar tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyffop that fpringeth out of the wall\nwith whatever relates to a proper knowledge of himfelf, \u201c and of beafts, and of\nfowls, and of creeping things, and of filhes\u201d-\u2014 not toworffiip the fun, nor the moon,\nnor the ftars, nor any of the hoft of heaven ;\nbut to confider, to admire, and to in-\nveftigate their characters, fixed by the hand of God for figns, for feafons, and for\ndays, and years. They, in faCt, contain no more than what every man ought to be\nacquainted with, to the belt of his abilities ; becaufe they lead to a comprehenfive\nidea of thofe occult caufes and effeCts, which aCt the molt, though they are the lead\nfeen ; and whereby the human underftanding is enlightened and improved, and the\nmind enriched with thofe divine precepts, which lead to a manifeftation of that\nFIRST and omnipotent CAUSE, to whole power all lecond caufes are fubfervient,\nand operate but as the agents of his Will ; and under whofe provident care and fuf-\nferance we fee, feel, move, fpeak, and have our being ! The ten thoufand blefiings\nwhich refult from this ftudy, are found in our enquiries after truth, and the myfte-\nries which furround us; of the aftonifhingfympathy and antipathy betwixt heavenly\nand earthly fubftances ; of the wonderful harmony and conftruCtion of the celeftial\nbodies; of the nature and qualities of our own exiftence, and the propagation of\nour fpecies \u2022, of the occult properties implanted in all created beings ; and the end\nfor which they are and were created I\nTo fuch enquiries all men are alike competent, and may boafl the fame preten-\nfions, unlefs obflinacy, or indolence, are fubftituted to prevent them. There is cer-\ntainly implanted in the human mind, a power which perceives truth, and commands\nbelief, in all the occult properties of nature, not by the force of argument, nor learn-\ning, norfcience; but by an inflantaneous, inftindlive, and irrefiftible impulfe, de-\nrived neither from education, nor from habit \u2022, but from the peculiar gift of Provi-\ndence, adting independently of our will, whenever thefe objedts are prefented\nbearing evidence of their reality, even when the pride of our external deportment,\nand our very words, affedt to deny them. This is an intelledlual fenfation, which I\nwill venture to affirm, is felt more or lefs by all mankind ; and I know the hearts of\nall my readers, if not their tongues, will admit thefadf. It is therefore evident that\nthe humble cottager, the claffical curate ; the regular phyfician, and the village doc-\ntor, ftand on the fame level in this refpedl. The ftudy of Nature\u2019s laws, of the oc-\ncult properties in medicine, and in the frame and temperature of our bodies, is no\n2 lets\nCi\n\f4 AKEYTOPHYSIC,\nlefs firnple, than important to our welfare ; and without knowing thefe, we know\nnothing that can place us beyond the fagacity of the brute creation. We can nei-\nther forefee danger, nor fhun it when it is near\u2014we are fubjetft to mifguided treat-\nment, and miftake, in our medical applications, and advice-\u2014 we receive intuitive\nfigns and tokens of misfortune or advantage, without knowing how to benefit by\nthe admonition-\u2014 In fhort, without this ftudy, our enquiries are vain\u2014 -our percep-\ntions are clouded-\u2014our views limited, and all our purfuits are vanity, vexation, and\ndifappointment. The weaknefs of our reafon, and the avocations arifing from the\ninfirmities and neceflities of our fituations, require the moll powerful inftrudtions,\nand the cleareft perceptions of heavenly and earthly things, for the prefervation of\nour fouls and bodies, and for the illumination of our minds ; advantages that can\nin no wife be more completely obtained than by an intimate acquaintance with the\nOccult Sciences, or, in other words, by a contemplation of\nGOD, AND NATURE.\nTHOUGH God has given us no innate ideas of himfelf, yet having furniftied us\nwith thofe faculties our minds are endowed wkh, he hath not left himfelf without a\nwitnefs; fince we have fenfe, perception, ancf reafon, and cannot want a clear proof\nofhim, as long as we carry any thought of ourfelves about us. To (hew, therefore,\nthat we are capable of knowing, that is, being certain that there is a God ;\nand how\nwe may come by this certainty, I think weJReed go no farther than ourfelves, and\nthat undoubted knowledge we have of o#r own exiftence. I think it is beyond\nqueftion, that man has a clear perception of his own being : he knows certainly that\nhe exifts, and that he is fomething. In the next place, man knows, by an intuitive\ncertainty, that bare nothing can no more produce any real being, than it can be equal\nto two right angles. If, therefore, we know there is fome real being, it is an evi-\ndent demonftration, that from eternity there has been fomething ; fince what was\nnot from eternity, had a beginning ; and what had a beginning, muft be produced\nby fomething elfe. Next it is evident, that what has its being from another, muft\nalfo have all that which is in and belongs to its being from another too ;\nall the\npowers it has, muft be owing to, and received from, the fame fource. This eternal\nfource of all being, muft be alfo the fource and original of all power ; and fo this\neternal being muft be alfo the moft powerful.\nAgain, man finds in himfelf perception and knowledge : we are certain then that\nthere is not only fome being, but fome knowing intelligent being in the world?\nThere was a time when there was no knowing being, or elfe there has been a know-\ning\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 5\ning being from eternity. If it be laid, there was a time -when that eternal being\nhad no knowledge ; I reply, that then it is impoffible there fhould have ever been\nany knowledge : it being as impoffible that things wholly void of knowledge, and\noperating blindly, and without any perception, fhould produce a knowing being, as\nit is impoffible that a triangle fhould make itfelf three angles bigger than two right\nones. Thus, from the confiderationof ourfelves, and what we infallibly find in our\nown conftitutions, our reafon leads us to the knowledge of this certain and evident-\ntruth, that there is an eternal, moft powerful, and knowing being, which whether\nany one will call God, it matters not. The thing is evident ;\nand from this idea,\nduly confidered, will eafily be deduced all thofe other attributes we ought to afcribe\nto this eternal Being.\nFrom what has been faid, it is plain that we have a more certain knowledge of the\nexiftence of a God, than of any thing our fenfes have not immediately difcovered to\nus. Nay, I prefume I may fay, that we more certainly know that there is a God,\nthan that there is any thing elfe without us. When I fay, we know, I mean, there is\nfuch a knowledge within our reach, which we cannot mifs, if we will but apply our\nminds to that, as we do to other inquiries.\nIt being then unavoidable for all rational creatures to conclude, that fomething\nhas exifted from eternity, let us next fee what kind of thing that muft be. There\nare but two forts of beings in-the world, that man knows or conceives ; fuch as are\npurely material, without fenfe or perception ; and fenfible perceiving beings, fuch\nas we find ourfelves to be. Thefe two forts we fhall call cogitative and incogita-\ntive beings \u2022, which, to our prefent purpofe, are better than material and immaterial.\nIf then there muft be fomething eternal, it is very obvious to reafon, that it muft\nneceffarily be a cogitative being *, becaufe it is as impoffible to conceive that bare\nincogitative matter fhould ever produce a thinking intelligent being, as that nothing\nof itfelf fhould produce matter. Let us fuppoie any parcel of matter eternal, we\nfhall find it in itfelf unable to produce any thing. Let us fuppofe its parts firmly at\nreft together-, if there were no other being in the world, muft it not eternally re-\nmain fo, a dead unatftive lump ? is it poffible to conceive that it can add motion to\nitfelf, or produce any thing? Matter then, by its own ftrength, cannot produce in\nitfelf fo much as motion. The motion it has, muft alfo be from eternity, or elfe ad-\nded to matterby fome other being, more powerful than matter. But let us fuppofe\nmotion eternal too ; yet matter, incogitative matter, and motion, could never\nproduce thought. Knowledge will ftili be as far beyond the power of nothing\nto produce. Divide matter into as minute parts as you will, vary its figure and\nmotion as much as you pleafe, it will operate no otherwife upon other bodies.\nNo. i, C of\n\f6 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nof proportionable bulk, than it did before this divifion. The minuted: particles of\nmatter, knock, repel, and refill one another, juft as the greater do, and that is all\nthey can do : fo that if we fuppofe nothing eternal, matter can never begin to be :\nif we fuppofe bare matter without motion eternal, motion can never begin to be : if\nwe fuppofe only matter and motion eternal, thought can never begin to be: for it is\nimpofiible to conceive, that matter, either with or without motion, could have origi-\nnally in and from itfelf, fenfe, perception, and knowledge, as is evident from hence,\nthat then fenfe, perception, and knowledge, mull be a property eternally infeparable\nfrom matter, and every particle of it. Since, therefore, whatfoever is the firft eternal\nbeing, mull neceflhrily be cogitative ; and whatfoever is firft of all things, mull ne-\ncefiarily contain in it, and actually have at leaft all the perfections that can ever\nafter exift ; it necefiarily follows, that the firft eternal being cannot be matter. If,\ntherefore, it be evident, that fomething muft necefifarily exift from eternity, it is\nalfo as evident, that that fomethingmuftbeacogitativebeing. For it is as impofiible\nthat incogitative matter fhould produce a cogitative being, as that nothing, or the\nnegation of all being, fhould produce a pofitive being, or matter.\nThis difcovery of the necefifary exiftence of an eternal mind, fufficiently leads us to\nthe knowledge of God ; for it will hence follow, that all other knowing beings that\nhave a beginning, muft depend on him, and have no other ways of knowledge or ex-\ntent of power, than what he gives them; and therefore if he made thofe, he made\nalfo the lefs excellent pieces of this univerfe, all inanimate bodies, whereby his om-\nnifcience, power, and providence, will be eftablilhed ; and from thence all his other\nattributes necefifarily follow.\nThus, a manifeftation of the Deity is vifible in all his works. There is not the\nfmalleft partof that immenfe fpace our eyes behold, or our imaginations conceive, that\nis not filled with His prefence. Theworlds which revolve with fo much order, beau-\nty, and harmony, through the immenfity of fpace, the fun, moon, liars, and planets,\nare upheld by the light of his countenance ; but for which they would drop from\ntheir orbs, and, plunged into the vail abyfs, would return to their primitive chaos.\nTo the mercy of God we owe all the blefilngs of this life, as the reward of good and\nvirtuous aftions. To his anger, we juft] y attribute all violent concufilons of the\nelements, famine, plague, pellilence, &c. brought on a wicked and abandoned peo-\nple, like the ftorm of fire and brimftone on Sodom and Gomorrah. The vengeance\nof the Deity cannot be more awfully defcribed, than by David in his Pfalms, which\nfhould aCt as a timely warning to thofe atheifts and unbelievers, and to thofe wick-\ned, idolatrous, and polluted countries, againft whofe deteftable crimes thefe terrible\nicourges have been fo often fent. The lhaking of the earth ; the trembling of the\n2 hills\n\fand OCCULT SCIENCES, 7\nhills and mountains; the flames of devouring fire darting through the firmament*,,\nthe heavens bending down with forked thunderbolts; their riding on the clouds,\nand flying on the wings of a whirlwind ; the burfting of the lightnings from the hor-\nrid darknefs ; the tremendous peals of thunder; theftorms of fiery hail ; the melting\nof the heavens, and diflfolving into floods of tempeftuous rains ; the earth opening\nand fwallowing up her inhabitants ; the rocks and mountains cleaving afunder, and\ndifclofing their fubterraneous channels, their torrents of water, and bituminous fire,\nat the very breath of the noftrils of the Almighty, are all of them circumftances\nwhich fill the guilty mind with horror and difmay, and admirably exprefs the pow-\ner, the prefence, and omnifcience of God\n!\nTo what has been ftated above, I would earneftly recommend an attentive peru-\nfalof what I have written in the firfl: volume of my complete Illufbration of the Oc-\ncult Sciences, from page 7 1 to 80 ; whence it will be manifeft to the full conviction,\nof the molt obftinate atheift, (if fuch a thing can really exifi:,) that there is a God,\nall powerful and intelligent ; fupremely perfedt ; eternal and infinite ; omnipotent\nand omnifeient ; who endures from eternity to eternity, and is prefent from infinity to\ninfinity\n!\nBut though, from the nature and perfections of the Deity, he is invifibly prefent\nin all places, and nothing happens without his knowledge and permifilon ;\nyet it is\nexprefsly revealed in Scripture, and admitted by all wife and intelligent authors, that\nhe is vifibly prefent with the angels and fpirits, and blefied fouls of the departed, in\nthofe manfions of blifs called Heaven. There he is pleafed to afford a nearer and\nmore immediate view of himfelf, and a more fenfible manifeftation of his glory, and\na more adequate perception of his attributes, than can be leen or felt in any other\nparts of the univerfe ; which place, for the fake of pre-eminent diftindtion, and as be-\ning the feat, and centre, from whence all things flow, and have their beginning, life,\nlight, power, and motion, is called the interior, or empyrean,\nheaven.\nThe pofition and order of this interior heaven, or center of the Divinity, has been\nvariouflydeferibed, and its locality fomewhat difputed amongft the learned ; but all\nagree as to the certainty of its exiftence. Hermes Trilmegiftus defines heaven to be\nan intellectual fphere, whofe center is every where, and circumference no where; but\nby this he meant no more than to affirm, what we have done above, that God is.\nprefent every where, and at all times, from infinity to infinity, that is to fay, without\nlimitation, bounds, or circumference. Plato fpeaks of this internal heaven in terms\nwhich bear fo ftriCt a refemblance with the books of Revelation, and in to elevated\nand magnificent a flile, thatitis apparent the heathen philofophers, notwithftanding\ntheir worfhipping demi or falfe gods, poffeifed an unfhaken confidence in one om-\nnipotent.\n\f'*\nA KEY TO PHYSIC,\n\u2022nipotent, fupreme, over-ruling Power, whofe throne was the center of all things,\nand the abode ofangels and bleffed fpirits.\nTo defcribe this interior heaven, in terms adequate to its magnificence and glory,\nis utterly impoffible. The utmoft we can do, is to colled from theinfpired writers,\nand from the words of Revelation, affifted by occult philofophy, and a due know-\nledge of the celeftial fpheres, that order and pofition of it, which reafon, and the di-\nvine lights we have, bring nearelt to the truth. That God muit be ftridly and lite-\nrally the center, from whence all ideas of the Divine Mind flow, as rays in every di-\nredion, through all fpheres, and through all bodies, cannot admit of adoubt. That\nthe inner circumference of this center is furrounded, filled, or formed, by arrange-\nments of the three hierarchies of angels, is alfo confonant to reafon and Scripture,\nand form, what may be termed, the entrance or inner gate of the empyrean heaven,\nthrough which no fpirit can pafs without their knowledge and permiffion \u2022, and with-\nin which we mull fuppofe the vaft expanfe or manfions of the Godhead, and glory\nof the Trinity, to be. This is ftridly conformable to the idea of all the prophets\nand evangelical writers. From this primary circle, or gate of heaven, Lucifer, the\ngrand Apoftate, as Milton finely defcribes it, was hurled into the bottomlefs abyfs\nwhofe office, as one of the higheft order of angels, having placed him near the eternal\nthrone, he became competitor for dominion and power, with God himfelf ! But,\nHim the Almighty Power\nHurl\u2019d headlong flaming from the ethereal fky.\nWith hideous ruin andcombuftion, down\nTo bottomlefs perdition, there to dwell\nIn adamantine chains and penal fire !\nMilton, Parad. LoJl> b. i. 1 . 44, &c.\nThe circles next furrounding the hierarchies, are compofed of the miniftering an-\ngels and fpirits, and meffengers of the Deity. In pofitions anfwering to the ideas of\nthe holy Trinity, and interfering all orders of angels, are feated, in fulnefs of glo-\nry and fplendor, thofe fuperior angels or intelligent Spirits, who anfwer to the divine\nattributes of God, and are the pure efiences cr ftream through which the Will or\nFiat of the Godhead is communicated to the angels and fpirits, and inftantaneoufly\nconducted to the Anima Mundi. Round the whole, as an atmofphere round a pla-\nnet, the Anima Mundi,\nor univerfal Spirit of Nature, is placed ;\nwhich receiving the\nimpreffions or ideas of the Divine Mind, conduds them onward, tQ the remoteft\nparts of the univerfe \u2022, to infinity itfelf ; to, and upon, and through all bodies, and to\nall God\u2019s works.

When fpeakingof the\nnature of a thing, we moft commonly mean its effence ; that is, the attributes or\ncaufe which makes it what it is, whether the thing be corporeal or not ; as when we\nattempt to define the nature of a fluid, of a triangle, &c. oftentimes we confound\nthat which a man has by nature, with what accrues to him by birth ; as when we\nfay, that fuch a man is noble by nature. Sometimes we take nature for an internal\nprinciple of motion ; as when we fay, that a flone by nature falls to the ground.\nSometimes we underftand by nature, the eftablifhed courfe and order of things.\nSometimes we take nature for an aggregate of powers belonging to the fame body,\nefpecially a living one; in which fenfe phyficians fay, that nature is ftrong, weak,\nor fpent ; or that, in fuch and fuch difeafes, nature left to herfelf will perform the\ncure.

Sometimes too, and that not unfrequently,\nwe exprefs by the word nature a kind of femi-deity, or fupernatural fpirit prefiding\nover all things.\nThis general abufe of the word nature, is by no means peculiar to the Englilh\npeople or language ; it prevails more or lefs in all countries, and amongft all feels;\nand feems to have been copied from the fabulous ideas of the ancients. Ariftotle\nhas written a whole chapter, exprefsly to enumerate the various acceptations of the\nGreek word <pv<n*rendered in Englilh, nature ; and, among Latin writers, there are\nnot lels than fifteen or fixteen different acceptations of the fame word, with ad-\nvocates out of number, for their interpretation. The bulk of them infifl, that the\nword nature radically means the fyftem of the world ; the machine of the univerfe ;\nor the affemblage of all created beings ; in which fenfe they fpeak of the Author of\nnature; and call the fun the eye of nature, becaufe he illuminates the univerfe-\nand father of nature, becaufe he warms the earth, and makes it fruitful.\nOthers, underftanding the word in a more confined fenfe, apply it to each of the\nfeveral kinds of beings, created and uncreated; fpiritual and corporeal ; thus they\nfay, divine nature, angelical nature, and human nature, meaning all men together\nwho poffefs the fame fpiritual, reafonable foul. In this fenfe the fchoolmen and\ndivines fay, natura naturans,\nand natura naturata, fpeak ing of God, who is the\nnatura naturans,\nas giving being and nature to all others ; in oppofition or diftindtion\nto the creatures, who are the natura naturata,\nas receiving their nature from the\nbands of another.\nNature, in a dill more limited fenfe, is ufed for the effence of a thing ; accord-\ning to which the Cartefians fay, it is the nature of the foul to think ; and that the\nnature of matter confids in extenfion. Others more properly ufe the word Nature,\nfor the eftablilhed order and courfe of material things ; the feries of fecond caufes ;\nor the laws which God has impofed on every part of the creation ; in which fenfe\nit is they lay, nature makes the night fucceed the day ; nature has rendered refpiration\nnecefifary to life, &c. According to which, St. Thomas fpeaks of nature as a kind\nof divine art, communicated to beings, which diredl and carry them to the ends they\nwere intended for ; in which fenfe nature can be neither more nor lefs than a conca-\ntenation of caufes and effedls, or that order and oeconomy which God has eftablilh-\ned in all parts of his creation. Others dill more dridlly confider nature as the\nadtion of Providence, and the principle of all things ; or that fpiritual power or\nbeing, which is diffufed throughout the creation, and moves and adts in all bodies,\nand gives them peculiar properties, and produces peculiar effedts. In this fenfe\ncur modern philofopher Mr. Boyle confiders nature as nothing elfe but God,\n2 adling\n*'pkc.svs YuWra\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. it\nacting himfelf, according to certain laws he himfelf has fixed. This correfponds\nvery much with the opinion of a fedt of ancient philofophers, who made Nature\nthe god of the univerfe. To n\u00ab>\/, whom they conceived to prefide over, and govern\nall things; but this they acknowledged to be only an imaginary being; and that\nnature meant no more than the qualifies, or virtues, which God implanted in his\ncreatures, but which their poets and orators had figuratively perfonified as a god.\nHence F. Malebranche was aggravated to fay, \u201c that the nature fo much fpoken\nof in the fchools, is only fit to lead us back to pagan idolatry ; fince it taught us to\nunderftand fomething, which without being God, adts continually throughout the\nuniverfe,\u201d according to which, he fuppofes nature would be adored as an idol, con-\nceived to poflefs an adtual principle, which, in concurrence with God, was the next\nand immediate caufe of all the changes which befal matter.\nAriftotle, with a view of concentrating thefe ideas of nature into one point, as beft\nadapted to the works of an infinitely perfedt and all-powerful Being, defines nature,\nfrincipium et caufa motus et ejus in quo ejiprimo per _\/f, et non per accidens f which de-\nfinition being miftaken by the Peripatetics and Stoics, they from hence con-\nceived the principle of nature to be a certain fpirit or virtue diffufed throughout\nthe univerfe, which gave every thing its motion by the invariable order of an ine-\nvitable neceflity, without liberty or knowledge. This induced the idea of a plaftic\nnature,\nwhich feveral learned modern writers have defcribed to be an incorporeal\ncreated fubftance, indued with a vegetative life, but not with fenfation or thought,\npenetrating the whole created univerfe, being co-txtended with it, and under God,\nmoving matter fo as to produce the phenomena, which cannot be folved by me-\nchanical laws ; active for ends unknown to itfeif, not being confcious of its *wn\nactions, and yet having an obfcure idea of the adlion to be entered upon. In lup-\nport of this plaftic nature,\nDr. Cudworth argues thus: \u201c fince neither all things are\nproduced fortuitoufly, or by the unguided mechanifm of matter, nor God himfelf\nmay reafonably bethought to do all things immediately and miraculoufly, it may\nwell be concluded, that there is a plaftic, or formative nature under him, which as\nan interior and fubordinate inftrument, executes that part of his providence, which\nconfifts in the regular motion of matter ;\nyet fo as that there is alfo, befides this, a\nhigher providence to be acknowledged, which, prefiding over it, doth often fuppiy\nthe defeats of it, and fometimes over-rule it, for as much as this plaftic nature can-\nnot a\u00a3t eledtively, nor with difcretion.\u201d This dodtrine, he conceives, had the fur-\nfrageof the beft philosophers of all ages, Ariftotle, Plato, Empedocles, Heraclitus,\nHippocrates, Zeno, and the Stoics, and the latter Platonifts and Peripatetics, as\nwell as thechemifts and ParacelfianSjand feveral modern writers,\n\u2022f* 7\ntCo \u2022\n7an TKc. , i n 0 W\ncaweofhwVianH of WtaVtixWKvcH ftrjl CXtih?

From the celeftial regions, the\nfame influx of pure etherial fpirit defcends into every part of the immeafurable\nfpace, and is diffufed through the mafs of this world, informing, adluating, and\nuniting the different parts thereof into various fubftances ; and being the primary\nfource of life, every where breathing a fpirit like itfelf, it pervades all elementary\nbodies, and intimately mixing with all the minute atoms thereof, conftitutes the\npower or inftrument we call Nature, forming, fafhioning, and propagating all\nthings, conformable to the ideas or will of the Divine mind, in the firft adt of crea-\ntion. -\u2014And fo the poet :\nSpiritus intus alit, totofque infufa per artus\nMens agitat molem,\net magnofe corpore mifcet. =*-\nThe only thing that has been objedted to the notion of an anima mundi, is, that it\nmingles the Deity too much with his creatures*, confounds, in fome meafure, the\nworkman with his work, making this, as it were, a part of that, and the feveral\nportions of the univerfe fo many parts of the Godhead.\u2014Yet is the fame principle\nafferted by Seneca, Epift. 92, \u201cToturn hoc quo continemur, et mum <?\/?, et Deus.

And we may\nfurther obferve, from what is above premifed, that thofe who deny the ani-\nma mundi on one hand, generally admit it on the other.

The Cartefians have\ntheir fubtle matter, which anfwers to the active fpirit of the anima mundi. Others\nfuppofe an actuating fpirit to flow from the fun, and the other heavenly bodies,\nwhich is diffufed over all parts of the world, and is the fource or principle of life,\nmotion, &c. which is ftill the fame thing. Some philofophers, in the place of thefe,\nhave fubftituted the idea of fire, or an etherial elaftic fpirit, diffufed through all\nparts of fpace, as the medium by which elementary bodies are nourifhed and fuf-\ntained *, which nearly comes to the fame thing. Even thofe who have contended\nfor a plaftic nature, fall in with every principle of the anima mundi ;\nonly they infifl\nthat the formative power is lodged in the earth *, whereas the truth is, that it dwells\nin the heavens, and is conveyed to the earth, to the elements, and into all matter,\nby the medium I have defcribed.\nI fhall conclude this definition of Nature, with remarking, agreeable to the\nopinion of the ingenious Mr. Boyle, that in order to regulate our conceptions of\nthe word in common, and to render the application of it lefs ambiguous, we fhould\ndiftinguifh between the univerfal, and the particular nature of things. Univerfal\nnature we fhould confider to be the aggregate of all the bodies that make up the\nworld, under the anima mundi, confidered as a principle by virtue whereof they ad:\nand fuffer, according to the laws originally prefcribed by the author of all things.\nAnd this makes way for the other fubordinate notion ; fince the particular nature of\nan individual confifls in the general nature, but only applied to that diftind part or\nportion of the univerfe j or, which is the fame thing, it is a particular afiemblage of\nthe mechanical properties of matter, motion, &c. of that fubjed which immediately\nengages our attention.\nOf the VISIBLE and OCCULT Properties of NATURE.\nHAVING thus far explained the foregoing fubjed, we come next to an inveftiga-\ntion of Caufes, and their Effedis, or the means whereby Nature ads in the frudifica-\ntion of the univerfe. We derive the idea of caufes and effeds from our obfervations\nof the viciffitudes of things, while we perceive fome qualities or fubftances be-\ngin to exift, and that they receive their exiftence from the due application and oper-\nation of other beings; in all which circumftances that which produces, is the\nCaufe, and that which is produced, is the EfFed. There is fuch a relation and con-\nnedion between the caufe and the effed, that we cannot have a true notion of the\none, unlefs at the fame time we have a conception of the other. So in general we\nNo. 2. E fay\n\fH A I&EY TO PHYSIC,\nfay that a caufe is nothing elfe but that which gives being to another thing, which\nis the effed of it, which way foever it happens, according to the various caufes.\nThe Firfi Caufe, which ads of itfelf, and of its own fupreme power and will, is\nGod. This is a truth fo evident, and fo confpicuous, that it cannot be denied.\nThe exiftence of a Firft Caufe, may be deduced from the certainty of our own ex-\niftence ; for that we exifb in the world, is a felf-evident truth ; but that we came into\nit of ourfelves, or by cafualty, neceflity, or chance, is abfolutely impoflible. The\nfource of our exiftence muft therefore be derived from fome being, who as the au-\nthor, muft alfo be the free principle of that efTence, or life, we poffefs. To fay that\nwe ourfelves were the caufe of our being, would be ridiculous ; becaufe from thence\nit would follow that weexifted before we had a being ; that we gave ourfelves that\nwhich we were not in the poffeflion of; and that the caufe and the effed were one\nand the fame thing ; which is likewife impolfible. It is no lefs an error to affirm\nthat we are in the world by neceflity ; for if fuch were the cafe our exiftence would\nhave never had a beginning, and we fhould have been immutable, and independent,\nand infinite in every kind of perfedion ; but as thefe qualities are only applicable to\na firft caufe, it follows that fuch caufe muft be Almighty.\nThofe who are convinced of the exiftence of a firft caufe, muft neceffarily attri-\nbute to it all the perfedions which are or can be in the world; that it is not only\nmoft perfed, and moft noble, but alfo, that all the effeds which it hath produced\nor is capable of producing, are contained within itfelf, in the utmoft perfedion ; and\nthat every one of them is infinite, in the unity of its being; for it is neceffary it\nfhould poflefs the perfedions of thofe beings it hath, or can produce, other wife it\nwould be laid to communicate that which it neither hath, nor can have. The firft\ncaufe would not be abfolutely perfed, if it was not Eternal ; for fo it would have\nhad a beginning, and might have an end ; and then it could not have been the firft\ncaufe, in fo much that it derives its exiftence from that which was pre-exiftent to it,\nand by confequence this caufe, which we fuppofe to be the firft, would be a fecond\ncaufe, limited in its being and perfedions, as in its duration ; and it would feem to\nhave a dependence upon another; whereas when we fuppofe it to be the firft, all\nothers muft depend upon, and be fubordinate to it. Whence it follows that thefe\nqualities muft be infeparable from it, independence, eternity, infinity, and fupreme\nauthority ; and that we cannot conceive any firft caufe, but at the fame time we\nmuft acknowledge the exiftence of God.\nThis firft caufe, which is God, muft neceffarily have that perfect unity, which ad-\nmits no multiplication either of nature or perfedions. Certainly if God was not\none in his being, but had feveral natures, the number of them ought to be infinite,\n2 and\n\f15\nand occult sciences.\nand yet none of thefe beings in particular would be infinite, becaufe when the per.\nfedion of one cannot be theperfedion of another, there will not be one to be round\nbut will ftand in need of the other, that is, in whom there would noc be requrfite that\nperfedion which the other beings poffefs. Therefore we may add, that all thefe\nfuppofed beings would beoppofite, independent, and all fupreme, which isimpofii-\nble; or that all would be fubjed to one or other of them, which is ridiculous;\nwhence it follows that there is but one only God, who is one in his exiftence, incap-\nable ofany multiplication, and who is the primary and univerfal caufe of all things.\nThe great number, or rather the infinity of perfedions which we apprehend to be\nin the firft caufe, is not repugnant to the Trinity, becaufe that does not divide the\nbeing ;\nand thefe perfedions are but one and the fame thing, though we give them\nfeveral names, and confider them under feveral ideas, which we are forced to cor-\nred ;\nfince without that unity there would be neceffariiy a compofition of parts,\nwhich would be the materials of the whole compound, and would precede its exift-\nence ;\ntherefore could not be the ingredients of that compofition, without fomething\nelfe intervening. They may alfo be divided and feparated ; fo that by the diffolu-\ntion of the parts, the compound would ceafe-, which is plainly inconfiftent with that\nidea we have of God, who is fimple in his nature, independent in his will, and eve-\nry way incorruptible. The firft caufe is not only one, and without its like in its\neffence, but alfo one foie, and without a fecond, in that adion by which this world\nwas produced ; and for this reafon the adion is called creation,\nfuppofing nothing\nbut mere nothing, out of which all things were made, by the only power of God,\nwithout the help of any other, having either the quality of an agent or a fubjed.\nThe world being produced by this firft caufe, remains fubjed to the will and plea-\nfure of it ; and in the fame manner as it was produced by the foie ad of this firft\ncaufe, fo it is preferved in the fame ftate, by the foie influence of the fame caufe ;\nwho as it did not want any help in the creation of the univerfe, fo neither doth it\nftand in need of any aftiftance in the confervation of it. If the firft caufe was free in\nthe creation of the world, thence it follows that all things were made by diredion\nofreafonand underftanding,and by confequence according to a certain idea and rule:\nand fince the firft caufeoperates after an independent manner, it could not have the type\nof its produdion any where elfe but from itfelf ; neither could it ad by a rule dif-\ntind from its own being ; fo that in truth God is not only the firft, but the exempla-\nry caufe of all things. For the fame reafon it may be faid, that the firft caufe, which\nis God, is the final caufe of all things ; for when he, as an intelligent and free being,\nproduced this world, he propofed to hirnfelf an end anfwerable to his dignity, that\nis, to hirnfelf, and his own proper glory. So that the firft caufe is neceffariiy, the\nultimate\n\f16 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nultimate end of all its effefts. This is a nice fubjeft, wherein all preachers and\nwriters feem at a loi's ;\nbut the cafe is clear and beautiful to thofe who purfue the\nleffonsof wifdom and fcience.\nSecond Caufes are thofe which derive the power orfaculty of afting, from the influ-\nence of the firfb caufe. Hence the anitna mundi, is the feat of all fecond caufes, which\nare alfo termed natural caufes, becaufe they have implanted in them by the firft\ncaufe, the occult power of diffufing through all fpace, and of communicating to all\nbodies, that univerfal foul, or etherial fpirit, whereby every particle of matter is\nmoved, and made to aft upon one another, fo as to produce the various phenomena\nin nature, in the animal, vegetable, and mineral worlds ; in the elements, and in the\nfirmament of heaven. This univerfal fpirit or caufe, afts univerfally with particu-\nlar caufes ; but after a manner agreeing with the nature of every particular thing,\nand according to the power which was given it when it was created ; which neither\nalters the quality of the caufes, nor the neceflity or liberty of their aftions. This\npower of afting, wffiich is communicated by fecond caufes, is not a quality different\nfrom thofe things impowered to aft ; whence the power which the atoms have of\nmoving in all directions doth not differ from the atoms themfelves*, the power of\nburning or heating doth not differ from the fire to which it is inherent, unlefs it be\nin the manner of our conceiving things, or of fpeaking of them according to our\nconceptions. So it is of an aftion which terminates from the caufe to the effeft,\nand which is nothing elfe than a certain relation, or an aftual fubordination which\nis always found betwixt the caufe and the effeft. Hence we perceive that fecond\ncaufes are what all philofophers, ancient and modern, have contended for under dif-\nferent forms ; and are neither more nor lefs than that univerfal fpirit, or inherent\nlaw, implanted in nature at the creation, whereby all God\u2019s works are regulated and\npreferved, and the ends and purpofes of that creation condufted to God\u2019s glory and\nmanifeftation, and to the good of all his creatures, the ftudy of which opens our eyes\nto the bright beams of true wifdom*, to the mutual harmony and dependence one\nthing has upon another j to thefympathy and antipathy of material bodies ; to the\nperceptions of fenfe, reafon, and intellectual vifion *, to the nice faculties and exqui-\nfite connexion of foul and body; and ultimately to the knowledge of ourfelves, of\nour progrefs through this world ; of our fublunary fate and fortune ; and of the\nthings calculated to preferve life, or to deftroy it.\nEfficient Caufes are all thofe aftions of bodies or things, which are the agents or\ndireft means whereby any effefts are produced. Thus a painter, painting a pifture,\nis an efficient caufe ; and the pifture itfelf, when finiffied, is the effeft thereof.\nEfficient caufes comprehend a number of compound or fubordinate caufes, which\nalio\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 17\nalfo contribute towards the produdion of their effed. If the efficient caufe ads\nby a power proper to itfelf, then it is called the principal caufe; but if only by the\nforce and ftrength of another, then it is termed the inftrumental caufe. So we dif-\ntinguiffi between the painter, and the pencil, though both contribute to the pro-\ndudion of the pidure. Again, the fubjed whereon the agent works, or whereof\nthe thing is formed, is called the material caufe ; thus the marble out of which a\nflatue is carved, is called the material caufe ; as is likewife the paint and canvas of\na pidure, as being the matter, or materials of which they are made; the fculptofr\nand painter being the efficient caufes. There is alfo an efficient caufe in the fun,\nmoon, flars, and elements, whereby they ad upon fublunary matter, and produce a\nvariety of effeds in the frudification and phenomena of this world. From theie\narife neceffary and free caufes, the firft of which ad neceffarily and without choice y*\nas fire, the fun, and all created beings, except angels and men ; for they ad by a free\nwill, wherein confifts the effence of liberty. The efficient caufe is likewife either\nphyfical, or moral \u2022, tht phyficalxs that which produces a fenfible corporeal effed,\nand ads obvioufly and immediately *, thus fire is the phyfical caufe of burning, and\nthe fun the phyfical caufe of heat. The moral caufe alfo produces a real effed, but\nin things immaterial ; thus, repentance is the moral caufe of forgivenefs. Again,\nwe define a phyfical caufe to be that which produces its effed by a phyfical virtue;\nand a moral caufe, that which determines the phyfical caufe, though not nece\/farily , to\nproduce the effed ; thus, the funis the phyfical caufe of light; a (tone, that falls\nfrom an eminence, and fradures thefkull, is a phyfical caufe of death ; and thus'\nthe advice, intreaty, commands, or menaces, which determines us, though not ne-\ncejjarily , to do, or not to do, any thing, are moral caufes. In this fenfe it is obvious\na moral caufe is only applicable to a free intelligent agent-*, and it is this notion of a\nmoral and phyfical caufe that is the molt juft, clear, and diftind.\nWhenever the efficient caufe applies to a free intelligent being, and ads from\nknowledge, all the fubordinate caufes concur to the produdion of one and the fame\neffed ;\nas for example, the painter drawing his pidure is the principal caufe ; the pen-\ncil the inftrumental ; the end propofed by the painter is the final caufe; the idea di-\nreding the performance is the exemplary caufe ; the form and difpofition of its parts\nis the formal caufe ; the colours and the canvas are the material caufe, as being the\nconftituent matter of the work ; and if theartift, by any accidental touch, improves\nhis pidure, like Agillaus, who labouring many days to draw a foaming horfe, and\ncould not, in a paffion flung his brufh at the painting, and the thing he wanted was\nthus accompliflied when it was not intended ; it is termed an accidental caufe.\nSo that we fee all fubordinate caufes are in effed under the efficient caufe; and are\nfubfervient to its when applied by reafon, and di reded by fkill.\nNo. 2. F\n\fV? A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nForm, and formal caufe, is one and the fame thing \u2022, and when we fay there are two\nforts of forms, that is only according to our manner of conceiving things; fo we\nfay there are two forts of formal caufes, the fubftantial, and accidental. But all\nforms are imaginary ; neither do true philofophers acknowledge any other fubftance\nto be in natural compounds, than matter, except only in man ; nor any other form\nthan the difpofition of the parts, becaufe all thefe forms are altogether ufelefs.\nMoreover, the exemplary caufe may be referred to the formal ; becaufe it is the idea\nend inward form of that which we frame in our fpirit ; fo the formal caufe of a\npifture is the dilpofition of its parts, according to the difpofition and ordination\nwhichjt then had in the mind of the painter. The fame may be faid of all rational\nagents which are endued with underftanding.\nThere is no difference betwixt matter and a material caufe; and there are two\nforts of material caufes, as well as of matter. That is the firft matter out of which\nall bodies are compofed, and into which, by an univerfal divifion, they may be re-\nduced ; the fecond is nothing elfe, but bodies made of the firft, and upon which the\nefficient caufes exercife their adtion. Therefore it is apparent, that there is nothing\nin the world but what is a compound, and that there is no compound without mat-\nter. It isalfo certain that there is nothing made without an efficient caufe, which\nadts upon compounds, and deftroys them, that ofthem others may be made ; becaufe\nthe matter of the firft ferves for the compofition of the fecond ; the matter which\ngoes to the compofition of the firft and fecond, is the firft matter, or material caufe\nof the compound ; and that matter which ferves the efficient caufe for a fubjedt and\npatient, is called the fecond matter. Both of them may be an efficient caufe; for\ncompounds adt upon one another like the elements, which drive one another back-\nwards and forwards. That which drives another is called the agent, as that which\nis driven is called the patient ; and if there be any thing which refifts it, and drives\nback another, this regrefs of the motion is called re-adtion. So that one and the\nfame thing, may be the fubjedt and caufe of motion ; and that to give and receive\nbeing the principle of agent and patient, both may happen at the fame time, but in\ndivers refpedts.\nEfficient caufes, in folid and fluid bodies, we often fee adt in a moft wonderful\nmanner ; and if they were not vifible to our eyes, we fliould fcarcely believe any of\nthefe occult properties exifted in them. Thus, the adtion ofoil, in flopping the vi-\nolent ebullition of various fubftances, is truly furprifing. It is well known that if a\nmixture of fugar, honey, or the like, be boiling on the fire, and in danger of rifing\nover the fides of the veflfel, the pouring in a little oil immediately makes it fubfide.\nIn many cafes the marking a circle round the infide of a veflfel, in which a liquor of\nthis\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 19\nthis kind is to be boiled, with a piece of hard foap, Ihall, like a magic ring, conFne\nthe ebullition to that height, and not fuffer it to ftir any farther. This is wholly\nowing to the oil, or fat, contained in the foap : but there is, befid.es thefe, another very\nimportant ufe of oil, on a like occafion, which is the pouring a little of it on any me-\ntallic folution, while making ; this reftrains the afcent of the noxious vapours*, pre-\nferves the operator from danger \u2022, and, at the fame time, by keeping down the evapo-\nrating matter, gives redoubled ftrength to the menftruum. Pliny has mentioned an\nextraordinary effedt of oil, in (tilling the furface of water when it is agitated with\nwaves, and the ufe made of it, by the divers, for this purpofe. Omne,\nfays he, oleo\ntranquillari*&cc. lib. ii. cap. 103. and Plutarch, in Qugeft. Natur. afks, Cur mare oleo\nconjperfum perlucidumfit et tranquillum ? t Pliny\u2019s account feems to have been either\ndifcredited or difregarded by our writers on experimental philofophy, till it was con-\nfirmed by leveral curious experiments of Dr. Franklin, which were publifhed in the\nyear 1774. The property of oil above mentioned has, however, been well known to\nmodern divers and dredgers for oyfters, at Gibraltar, and elfewhere. The divers in\nthe Mediterranean, in particular, defcend, as in Pliny\u2019s time, with a little oil in their\nmouths, which they now and then let out; and which, on rifingto the furface of the\nfea, immediately renders it fmooth, fo as to permit the light to pafs through the wa-\nter, undifturbed by various and irregular refraftions. The Bermudans are enabled\nto fee and ftrike fifh, which would be concealed from their view, through the\nroughnefs of the fea, by pouring a little oil upon it. And the Lifbon fifhermen ef-\nfect a fafe paffage over the bar of the Tagus, by emptying a bottle or two of oil in-\nto the fea, when the furf is fo great as to endanger its filling their boats. Our failors\nhave alfo obferved, that the water is always much fmoother in the wake of a (hip that\nhath been newly tallowed than it is in one that is foul. Dr. Franklin was led, by\nan accidental obfervation made at fea, in 1757, to attend particularly to Pliny\u2019s ac-\ncount *, and the various informations which he afterwards received relating to it in-\nduced him to try fome experiments on the fubjedt. Standing on the windward fide\nof a large pond, the furface of which was rendered very rough with the wind, he\npoured a tea-fpoonful ofoil on the water.

On repeating this experiment,\nwhich conftantly fucceeded, one circumftance ftruck him with particular furprife ;\nthis was the fudden, wide, and forcible fpreading of a drop of oil on the face of the\nwater, which, he adds, \u201c I do not know that any body has confidered.\u201d When a\ndrop of oil is put on a looking-glafs, or polifiied marble, it fpreads very little ^ but\n2 on\n^ ^ l*!

It feems, fays Dr. Franklin, as if a mutual repulfion\nbetween its particles took place as foon as it touched the water, and a repulfion fo\nftrong as to adl on other bodies fwi.mming on the furface, as draws, leaves, &c.\nforcing them to recede every way from the drop, as from a center, leaving a large\nclear fpace. In endeavouring to account for the fingular effedts of oil. Dr. Frank-\nlin obierves, that there feems to be no natural repulfion between water and air, fuch\nas to keep them from coming into contadt with each other.\u2014Therefore air, in mo-\ntion, which is wind, in paffing over the fmooth furface of water, may rub, as it were,\non that furface, and raifeit into wrinkles, which if the wind continues, are the ele-\nments of future waves. The fmal left wave does not immediately fubfide, but in\nfubfiding raifes nearly as much of the water next to it. A fmall power, continually\noperating, will produce a great adtion : fo that the firft-raifed waves, being continu-\nally adted upon by the wind, are, though the wind does not increafe in ftrength,\ncontinually increafed in magnitude, rifing higher and extending their bafes, fo as to\ninclude a vaft mafs of water in each wave, which, in its motion, adts with great vio-\nlence. But if there be a mutual repulfion between the particles of oil, and no at-\ntradtion between oil and water, oil dropt on water will not be held together by ad-\nhefion to the fpoton which it falls ; it will not be imbibed by the water ; but be at\nliberty to expand itfelf and fpread on a furface, that prevents, perhaps, by repelling\nthe oil, all immediate contadt > the expanfion will continue till the mutual repulfion\nbetween the particles of oil is weakened, and reduced to nothing by their diftance.\nDr. Franklin imagines, that the wind, blowing over water, thus covered with\na film of oil, cannot eafily catch upon it, fo as to raife the firft wrinkles, but Aides\nover it, and leaves it fmooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil, indeed, which\nbeing between it and the water, ferves it to Aide with, and prevents fridtion : hence\nthe oil, dropt on the windward fide of the pond, proceeds gradually to leeward, as\nmay be feen by the fmoothnefs it carries with it quite to the oppofite fide : for the\nwind, being thus prevented from raifing the firft wrinkles, which he calls the ele-\nments of waves, cannot produce waves, which are to be made by continually adting\nupon and enlarging thofe elements, and thus the whole pond is calmed. Upon the\nwhole, there is great room to fuppofe fnotwithftanding the partial failure of an ex-\nperiment made at Portfmouth, by Dr, Frankl'n, and others), that feafaring people\nmay derive advantages from ufingoil on particular occafions, in order to moderate\nthe violence of the waves, or to leffen the furf which fometimes renders the landing\non\n\fsi\nAND OCCULT SCIENCES.\non a lee-fhore dangerous or impracticable. To this purpofe we are informed, that\nthe captain of a Dutch Eaft India fhip, being overtaken by a ftorm, found himfelf\nobliged, for greater fafety in wearing the fhip, to pour oil into the fca, to prevent\nthe waves breaking over her, which had an excellent effedt, and fucceeded in prefer-\nving her.

Thus, we fay, the ftroke, or percuffion, is only the occafional caufe of the\nmotion produced in the body ftruck ; it is God is the diredt efficient caufe. And\nthus the adtion of objedts on our organs is not the efficient caufe of our ideas and\nperceptions, but merely the occafional caufe, which determines God to adt on the\nmind, according to the laws of the union of foul and body.\nIn a medicalfenfe, whatever produces a difeafe, is called the caufe thereof. This\noperates, either by inducing a new ftate of the folids and fluids, or by taking away\nfomething which is abfolutely requilite to the exercife of forae function. If a cauie\npre-exifted in fome meafure in the body before the effedt produced, it is called an\ninternal caufe but if it exifeed out of the body, and by its application to it produced\nthe difeafe, it is called external.\nInternal caufes generally injure, firft the humours, and then the folid parts\n;\nwhereas the external caufes affcdl the folids, and9\nin conlequence of that, the hu-\nmours 5 and this holds univerfally, unlefs perhaps in fome few aifeafes produced by\npoifon or contagion.

The prefence of this con-\nftitutes and continues the difeafe: and theabfence of it removes the diforder, being-\nvery little different from the difeafe itfelf. Theinveftigation therefore of this is ex-\ntremely ufeful and very necefiary. The remote caufe is that which changes the body\nin fuch a manner, as to difpofe it for the reception of a difeafe upon the acceffion of\nanother caufe; but it is never adequate or Efficient to produce a difeafe alone; nor\nwould that other caufe, the acceffion of which is necefiary, be of itfelf Efficient for\nNo. 2.

The bufinefs of phyfic there-\nfore, is to eradicate both together, which in conjunction conftitute the proximate\nor immediate caufe. The remote caufe inherent in the body, is called predifponent,\nantecedent, and by the Greeks itQO'ij^ov[Aivri ? and confifts principally in temperaments,\nplethora, and cacochymy. The caufe whofe accefllon to the remote caufe excites,\nand in conjunction with it forms the difeafe, is called the procatardtic caufe, or the\n#?\nopa<nf,fbr occafion of the difeafe. It is fometimes internal, fometimes external.\nThefe Boerhaave reduces to four clafles. Firft, the ingefta, or things entering the\nbody ; fuch as the air, aliments, drink, medicines, poifons, luch things as enter\nby the pores of the Hein and noftrils ; by the feveral paffages of the mouth, lungs,\ncefophagus, ftomach, inteftines, and pudenda of women, while in a vifible or in-\nvifible manner-, whether by fleam, draught, deglutition, clyfter, or injedlion.\nSecondly, th egejla, or things adted, as motion of the whole or any part of the body,\naffedtions of the mind, reft, both of the body and mind, fleeping and watching.\nThirdly, things retained, or excreted, whether falubrious, fecrementious, or mor-\nbid. Fourthly, things applied to the body ; as air, vapours, fomentations, cloths,\nliniments, ointments, plafters, together with whatever wounds, contufes, or corrodes 5\nall which circumftances fhould be well conftdered by medical men.\nOf the FIRST MATTER.\nALL philofophers agree that there is a firft matter, which was produced from the\nbeginning; and, though it can never undergo any change, yet it is to be feen in all\nthe generations and corruptions which are in nature. Hence it appears, that the\nfirft matter exifted before the generation of the compounds wherein it is found, and\nthat it ftill remains and furvives the corruption of it ; as for inftance in fire which is\nmade of chips; the matter of the fire was in the chips, and is found partly in the\nfire, partly in the fmoke, and partly alfo in the afhes. It is agreed by all, that no-\nthing produces nothing, and that there is not any thing in nature that can be redu-\nced into nothing, but that the firft principles remain in all revolutions which can\nhappen; therefore, in refpedl of matter, wemayjuftly fay, that there is nothing\nnew in the world fince the creation, and that this matter in its nature is incorrupti-\nble -, fo that to explain theeflenceof this firft matter is the only difficulty.-\u2014Ariftotle\nmakes it the fubjedt of all forms, and nothing but a pafiive power or a mere capacity\nof producing them. He fays alfo, that matter in itfelf hath neither qualitynor quan-\ntity, nor any effence befide that which it received from that form which perfected it\nbut this explication gives us no clear idea of matter, neither doth it teach us any\n.\u2019thing of the nature of it. Thofe were nearer the truth who faid that the firft matter\nwas\nJ>v<jecliOP3menC(\nprectdtnf\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 23\nwas nothing elfe but the fir ft elements into which compounds by a total diflolution\nare reduced \u2022, alfo that thefe elements ought to be fimple and indivifible, for other-\nwife the firft elements are not fuch as we fuppofe them to be. It follows, from this\ndodtrine, that neither water, air, earth, nor fire, are firft elements, becaufe they are\ncompounds, therefore we muft look for other elements which are fimple and indivi-\nfible. Now it is obvious, that fimple and indivifible atoms are the only firft matter,\nand the principle and elements whereof bodies arecompofed : out of thefe atoms are\ncorpufcles made, out of thefe corpufclesfmall mafles, out of mafTes greater parts, and\nof thefe parts greater bodies whereof the univerfe itfelf confifts. And vice verfa, going\nbackward analytically, the world is divided intogreat bodies, thofe bodies are redu-\nced by mortality and time into parts, parts into fmall mafles, mafles into corpufcles,\nand laftly, corpufcles into atoms.\nOf ATOMS, and their NATURE.\nTO demonftrate the exiftence of atoms,\nwe muft fuppofe that every compound\nmay be divided into fo many parts as they are which make the compound ; and di-\nvifion muft neceflarily ceafe when there is a failure of parts to be divided. On\nthe other hand, there is no end of divifion as long as there are particles to be di-\nvided \u2022, one of the two we muft allow, that is either that a body cannot be fo exa&ly\ndivided but that there always remain divifible parts in infinitum, or that there are\nparts after a certain number ofdivifions which will not admit any further divifions.\nAriftotle holds the former, but Gaflendus and the ancient philofophers defend the\nlatter \u2022, and, according to this laft doctrine, after all the divifions are made, nothin^\ncan remain befides atoms, that is, indivifible beings, which are the firft elements of\nnatural bodies.\nI confefs it is hard to imagine a corporeal thing to be indivifible, becaufe we fee no-\nthing in this world which is not divifible; but this makes nothing agafnft atoms which\nare corporeal becaufe they compofe bodies, and are indivifible, becaufe they are the\nfirft and molt fimple elements of bodies. Hence arifes another difficulty, becaufe it\ncannot be eafily explained after what manner a thing that is divifible is compofed of\nparts which are indivifible. Impartial minds do not find fo much difficulty in concei-\nving this matter, as thofe do who follow the prejudices they have received ; fome\npeople do not confider, firft, that there are many things which efcape our fenfes, and\nyet are moft real \u2022, fecondly, that that which compofes a body is not a compound, as\nwe fee that unity makes number, though itfelf be not a number ; letters, whereof\nnouns and words are framed, yet are neither one or the other ; the drops of water,\nwhereof rivers confift, are not rivers : fo atoms, though they are invifible and indi-\n\u2022\nvifible*\n\f$4 A K E \u00a5 TO P IT Y S I C,\nvifible, yet they cotnpofe bodies which are viftble and divifible, They are alfo im-\nmutable, in order to the world\ns\ns continuing in the fame (late, and bodies being of\nthe fame nature now as formerly.\nThe PROPERTIES, MAGNITUDE, FIGURE, WEIGHT, and MO-\nTION, o? ATOMS.\nAN atom is a corporeal being, fimple, invifible, and indivifible* folidity confti-\ntutes its effenceor effential property, which diftinguilhes itfromfpirit and vacuity,\nwhich hath no power of refilling, Atoms neceffarily avoid all our fenfes, becaufe\nthey are compofed of many di(lin\u00a3l and grofs parts, whofe objedl ought to be com-\npered ere it can be perceived by the external organ *, this however does not deftroy\nthe truth and reality of atoms, becaufe fmall corpufcles efcapeourlenfes ; as weob-\nferve in dull, which (licks to our cloaths v in the corpufcles of a (lone which is made\nhollow by the drops of water ; in divers occult parts in a mite, which cannot befeen\nwithout the help of a migrofcope j and, laftly, in fmall corpufcles which are feen to\nmove in a chamber by the fun- beams : we may omit many others that are fmaller,\nw hich without doubt we could fee if our fight was more acute.\nThough atoms are mod fubde and imperceptible, yet they have their particular\nextenfion, magnitude, and figure, from whence their differences arife : for the figure\nof fome of them is round, as the atoms of water, oil, and quickfilver \u2022, others have\ncubicular figures, fuch as the atoms of fea-water j and others are pyramidal, as thofe\nwhereof nitre confifts i there are fame which have (harp points like needles, as thofe\nof fire ;\nwhence we have to fuppofethere are others varioufiy figured. This difference\nis neceffary to diftinguifti compounds; and as thefe atoms, as to their folidity or in-\nvifibilky and indivifibility (which are their infeparabie properties), are alike ; fo\nalfo, if they did not differ in their figure and thicknefs, all bodies would be alike.\nWeight is the principle of the faid natural motion, in as much as it doth refid a\nviolent motion. I mention this that we -may know whether motion of atoms hath\nan internal or external principle, or whether weight be determined only to one motion\nor that it be indifferently inclined to many \u2022, and whether the motion of atoms doth\ntend to fome center and whether it be continuant or interrupted ; and, laftly\nwhether it be perpendicular or horizontal, parallel or declined, right or parabolical\nor circular.\nIn order to folvethis difficulty, I fuppofe that atoms may be confidered in a double\n(late ; the firft ft ate is before the compofition of the bodies which are made of them\nand may be called the (late of liberty ; the other is that which they have in the bodies\nwhich confiftof them, which may .be termed the (late of obligation or fervitude.\nIf\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES, at\nIf atoms beconfidered in their firflflate, their motion is perpetual , fo that an atom\nthat is loofe and freed from any compofition, is effentially in motion, which ought\nnot in the leaf: to be wondered at ; for motion in refpedt of a free atom is the lame\nthat underftanding is in refpedl of an angel, which is never without knowing, un-\nlefs his intellect be bound and clouded.\nFrom this principle it is evident, that atoms are in continual motion, unlels\nthey are hindered, or that they meet with fome obflrudion, or that there are other\natoms refilling or repelling them, or that they find fuch as will flick to them, or that\nthey infinua r\ne themfelves into the atoms of certain bodies, or that they enter into\nfome compofition whereby their motion is flopped. Neverthelefs, atoms in com-\npounds are not altogether void of motion, becaufe they are not fo flraightly imbodi-\ned together but that they have fome motion, like vibrations and palpitations, ac-\ncording to the liberty which is granted them by the diffeminated vacuities ; nay,\nfome of them do fometimes attempt their efcape, efpecially in porous bodies, which\ntherefore fooner corrupt and perifh, than other bodies, which are more folid\nand more clofe. It is yet more evident in living bodies, out of which the animal\nSpirits, which are but the bodies of atoms, and molt fubtle corpufcles, are diflipated\nby tranfpiration, whence aliments are neceffarily requifite to fupply the fpirits of the\n\u2022whole body which are diflipated by motion and agitation. This motion of atoms\nor the leaft corpufcles in living bodies, may bedefervedly accounted the image of\ntheir firfl liberty, and, though they do but feldom enjoy their full liberty, yet they\nare apt to raife the greatefl commotions in order to be freed and to gain their liber-\nty, this istheorigin of many diftempers \u2022, as, in acute fevers, the atoms or corpuf-\ncles of the boiling blood, or obflrudted choler, are carried and driven into the brain,\nwhere they produce watchfulnefs, deliriums, and phrenfies. According to this prin-\nciple, that which we faid before may be concluded, That many diftempers arife from\nminute corpufcles and emancipated atoms for thefe, being driven forwards by other\natoms, and forced back, run into the membranes, perioftium,\nmeninges, or intef-\ntines, and caufe the cholic, headach, gout, and rheumatifm; fo that this folution\nof corpufcles and emancipation of atoms in our bodies are much to be dreaded ; and\nto prevent their danger, all motions of the body which are too violent muft be\navoided \u2022,\nfor thefe are the external caufe of the confufion of the fpirits and the\nemancipation of the atoms.\nThe emancipation of the atoms, and alfo of the fmall corpufcles which are corn-\npofedof thole atoms, are to be feen no lefs in the great world, than in the little ;\nforthe winds are nothing elfe than emancipated atoms, which, by their impetuoh-\nty, being driven backwards and forwards, force all bodies that Hand in their way ;\nNo. 2. H Jt\n*\n\f2 6 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nit is thefe atoms which agitate the air, and overturn all things which refill their mo-\ntion ; therefore the motion of atoms is not equal, nor every where alike, but varies\naccording to the diverfity of bodies whereby they are driven, or as the figures of\nthem are more or lefs fitted for motion, or otherwife, according to the proportion\nof vacuities which are difperfed in bodies ; fo that fome atoms are moved quicker,\nand others flower, not becaufe fome are heavier than others, but becaufe they are\ndriven backwards or forwards, or are flopped, by others, which happen to fix\nthem with greater or lefs violence.\nAn atom is not a body according to the notion we have, that it is a compound\nbeing; but a fimple being, and alfo corporeal ; that is, fimple, becaufe it is indivifi-\nble ; and corporeal, becaufe it hath a certain extenfion, and makes up the compofi-\ntion of bodies, which in the total divifion of them are reduced again into atoms.\nTwo other difficulties arife from the former opinion : for, if an atom be indivifi-\nble, after what manner can we propofe to ourfelves that it hath extenfion, or how\ncan it be an ingredient in thecompofition of divifible bodies ? To this we anfwer,\nin few words, that extenfion is according to the nature of the thing extended \u2022, for,\nif the thing extended be divifible, in the fame manner is the extenfion; and fo, on\nthe other fide, it is of the rational foul, which is pofTefled of the whole body, and ex-\nerciies its operations in all the parts of it; neverthelefs, it is, like an atom, indivisi-\nble; and, though it be divifible in refpeftof the fpace it occupies, yet it hath an in-\nternal extenfion which is indivifible ; it is the fame thing which divines are forced to\nfay of angels, and fome philofophers about their phyfical tumid points. But fome\nwill fay, that atoms are neither like fouls, angels, nor phyfical points, becaufe they\nhave parts, and thefe have none-, and fince that which confifls of parts is divifible, it\nfollows alfo that an atom is divifible. To this difficulty I anfwer, with the divines,\nthat angels and our fouls, which are Spirits\u2014and alfo, with philofophers, that phy-\nfical points which are material\u2014 have no real but only potential parts ; that is, an\nangel and rational foul in refpedt of the operations which they exercifeand the fpace\nwhich they occupy ; and the tumid points in refpedt of the fpace which they fill up.\nIndeed an angel and the foul have two powers whereof the one is the intellect, the\nother the will, which, being only an indivifible fubftance, capable of underftanding\nand willing, yet no man will deny but they, notwithflanding their indivisibility\n(which at lead is equal to the indivisibility of an atom), do fill up a divifible fpace ;\nas no man can doubt but that an angel can be at the fame time in the four corners\nof the room and in the middle of it, and that it hath a four-fquare figure by com-\nmunication of the four angles or corners, and that it can quit this and affume another\nfigure at its pleafure ;\nwhich cannot be faid of tumid points and atoms, which are\ndeftitute\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 27\ndeftituteof underftanding and will. The rational foul being equally indivisible\nwith an atom, angel, or point, doth wholly pofiefs a great body, no lefs than it did\nwhen the body was little; therefore it dilates itfelf without being divided, becaufe\nin its nature it is fimple and indivifible, and is without diftinft parts. This is the\nopinion of Ariftotle, and indeed it is the mod common opinion. But if the foul\nwere not by its own fubftance extended through the whole body, and had its feat on-\nly in the heart, as Empedocles would have it; or in the fpleen and the ftomach, as\nVan Helmont places it ; or in the glandula pinealis of the brain, according to Cartefi-\nus ;\nor in the Jlriate bodies of the brain where the common fenfe is, or the fenfe it-\nfelf, as it is called by way of excellency ; and in the callous parts, becaufe there it\nforms the ideas of things and judges of them ; and in the cineritious part of the\nbrain, becaufethere it performs the funftions of the memory, according to the opin-\nion of Duncane ; it is certain that all thefe parts, which are taken to be the feat of\nthe foul, are divifible, and that they have diftinft parts and figures fo the foul,\nas it is indivifible, occupies a fpaceor place which is divifible ; whence I conclude\nthat indivifibility does not hinder but that a fubftance may have a certain indivi-\nfible extenfion, but divifible as to theplace which it poflfefies, or that it may have an-\ngles and figure in refpeftof place, though its fubftance eflentially remain one, fim-\nple, and indivifible.\nHence it follows that there is one catholic or univerfal matter, called corpuf-\ncles or atoms, filling all fpace, which is an extended, impenetrable, and divifible\nfubftance, common to all bodies, and capable of all forms ; infinitely harder than any\nof the fenfible porous bodies compounded of them ; even fo hard, as never to wear,\nor break in pieces ; no other power being able to divide what God made one in the\nfirft creation. While thefe corpufcles remain entire, they may compofe bodies of\none and the fame nature and texture in all ages ; but fhould they wear away, or\nbreak in pieces, the nature of things depending on them would be changed. Wa-\nter and earth, compofed of old worn particles, and fragments of particles, would not\nbe of the fame nature and texture now, with water and earth compofed of entire par-\nticles at the beginning ; and therefore, that nature may be lafting, the changes of\ncorporeal things are only to be placed in the various reparations and new afibciations\nof thefe permanent corpufcles. That in order to form the vaft variety of natural\nbodies, this matter muft have motion in all its affignable parts, and aft in all man-\nner of direftions and tendencies. Thefe corpufcles have therefore not only a vis\ninertie,\naccompanied with fuch pafiive laws of motion as naturally refult from that\nforce; but alfo are moved by certain aftive principles, fuch as that of gravity, and\nthat which caufes fermentation, and the cohefion and fympathy of bodies. That\nthis\n\f2$ A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthis matter muft alfo be actually divided into parts, and each of thefe primitive par-\nticles, fragments, or atoms of matter, mufc have their proper magnitude, figure,\n.and fhape *, and muft have different orders, poficions, fituations, and poftures,\nfrom whence all the varieties of compound bodies arife. This view of the firft prin-\nciples of matter, accounts for an infinity of phenomena, otherwife inexplicable, and\npoints out all the occult operations in nature, by fympathy, antipathy, fafcination,\neohefion, coagulation, diffolution, &c. for fince thefe corpufcles are every where\nand at ail times in motion, ifluing from and cohering to all bodies that fall in their\nway-, and fince they are operated upon and diverfly altered by the four elements\nproper to this world ; and thefe elements again by rays of light, heat, and influx of\nthe anima mundi, and celeftial bodies, all the viciffitudes of nature are deduced\nfrom them ; and, according to the qualities and temperature of the matter fo-formed,\nand of thofe they come in contadt with, are the affedtions of the mind, the fundtions\nof the body, the paffion of love, and a thoufand inexplicable circumftances attendant\non human affairs, regulated and governed ; as we fhall now proceed tofhew.\nOf SYMPATHY and ANTIPATHY in NATURAL BODIES.\nTHE wonderful effedts we lee in nature, whofe true and efficient caufes are not\ncafily found out, obliged philofophers heretofore to have recourfe to occult caufes,\nand to attribute all thofe effedts to natural fimpathy and antipathy, which happen\namongft the feveral bodies whereof the world is compounded.\nThat we may the better underftand what may be faid upon a fubjedt fo nice and\ndelicate, and give a reafon for thofe wonderful effedts which are attributed to fympa-\nthy and antipathy, in the firft place we muft iuppofe that the difficulty which oc-\ncurs in explaining an effect of this nature, is becaufe the mind is not able to know\nthe truth of things but by the fenfes, which are^he gates through which the objedts\nenter and form their ideas in our undemanding ; but, becauie there are an abun-\ndance of things that efcape our fenfes, it is no wonder that it is fo hard to give a\nreafon for thofe caufes which are fo remote from our view : as for example, iron\nmoves itfelf, and that by way of local motion, and joins itfelf to the loadftone we\ndo not fee that which draws the iron to it, though we fee itattradfed j and therefore,\nthat we may give a folid reafon for this and other phenonema of the like nature, we\ndeclare according to our philofophy, that there are no bodies but what continually\nemit certain fubtle particles and imperceptible corpufcles which are difperfed through\nthe air, and are at fome times carried to a great diftance, unlefs.they arefurroundedby\nother bodies in their way. By this principle we find the reafon why a dog follows\n2 the\n\fJVH3\n:y\ny H\n\f\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 29\nthe footflep of the hare, or from a heap of a thoufand ftones he readily knows the\n{lone his matter threw, and picks it out, and by his command brings it to him ;\nfrom this difperfion of corpufcles, we find the reafon how the contagion of the plague,\neither from the perfon infeded, or from the wind blowing from that region, is carried\na great way off ; by this appears the reafon why wounds may be cured at a hundred\nmiles diftance by means of the fympathetic powder, the aftonifhing properties of\nwhich arefully defcribed in my llluftration of the Occult Sciences ; fo likewife of the\nfermentation of Canary wine brought into England, which ferments here at the fame\ntime of the vintage there.\nWe mutt; fuppofe, farther, that thefe fmall corpufcles differ in figure and magni-\ntude, and are not equally received by this or that body \u2022, fo one man is infected by\nthe plague in the fame place where many others efcape ; for the fame reafon the\nbeams of the fun melt wax, and not lead ; unlefs they are collected and united by\nthe help of a burning lens, or the like ; and the heat of fire melts metals in a very\ndifferent manner.\nAgain, the palm-tree of the male kind is barren unlefs the female be planted near\nit ; and, if feparated by a river, they lean to each other as if they would embrace \u2022,\nif you tlrike the firing of a lute in one corner of a room, it fhall caufe the firing of\nanother lute, tuned to the fame height, and placed in an oppofite corner, to give\na found ;\nthe cock always crows and claps his wings in the fame moment the fun\nafcends the horizon.

The loadflone is found in iron mines,\nand is not much different from the nature of iron \u2022, wherefore the particles which\nproceed from the loadflone have a kind of agreement with the pores of iron; and\nthefefmall corpufcles, going out of the loadflone, and meeting with the iron in the way,\nrufh into the pores of it ;\nbut, becaufe all cannot enter at once, a great many remain\nwithout, and thefe are as flrongly beaten back by the particles of the iron which they\nmeet with, as if they were of the numberof thofe corpufcles, which, beingat liberty,\nreturn of their own accord, and at length fend thefe by a refledive motion to the\nloadflone, from whence they firfl came. Hence it is that the iron is drawn towards\nthe loadflone, principally by the agitation of thofe minute magnetic corpufcles moved\nin the concavities of the iron ; and being ffiaken together by the fundry motion of\nthofe corpufcles which are twilled one within another, thofe corpufcles which return\nby refledion are complicated and annexed to thofe which are m the pores of the\niron, and cannot be returned or moved towards the loadflone, unlefs they draw along ;\nwith them thofe corpufcles to which they are annexed, and which cannot follow.\nNo. 3. I unlefs\n\fjo A KEY TO PHYSIC,\n%\nunlefs by their motion the iron be carried with them ; fo the iron follows and is mo-\nved toward the loadftone, except the iron be bigger than the loadftone; for then\nthecorpufcles which proceed from the loadftone are not fo many, nor by confequence\nfo powerful, as to draw the iron. The reafon the loadftone draws no other body but\niron, is becaufe other bodies do not return the atoms, neither are their pores well\nfitted for thofe magnetic corpufcles. By the fame reafon it appears that the load-\nftone does not approach to the iron, but the iron to the loadftone. It may be\nfaid that hard and folid bodies, fuch as iron, cannot emit fuch a great number of cor-\npufcles as other bodies, which, like the loadftone, are lefs folid and more porous.\nThere may be a reafon given alfo why the loadftone, being rubbed with garlic or oil,\ndoes not fo eafdy draw iron to it, which is, that thefe ftrange corpufcles, by their\noilinefs, hinder the emifiion of the corpufcles out of the loadftone, and alfo their en-\ntrance into thl? pores of the iron, and thus break their elaftic force.\nWe may obferve many other effects of the loadftone : as for example, that iron put\nupon a table is moved by the virtue of this ftone placed under the table ; for it is\ncertain that the corpufcles of the loadftone which moves the iron penetrate through\nthe vacuity or pores of the table, as if by fmall and invifible threads it had been\ntied to the loadftone. It is the fame thing if the table be of marble or glafs, provided\nit be not greafy nor too thick, which proves the porofity of bodies. Another effed\nof the loadftone is feen in a needle, which, being touched by it, always turns towards\nthe north pole; the reafon is, becaufe there are mountains ofloadftones under the poles,\ndifperfing their attractive fpirits through the univerfe, fpirits which are entangled\nwith thofe which adhere to the magnetical needle, whofe force is leffened as the\nfpirits of it are diffipated ; efpecially if thecompafs be fet in a place where there are\npieces of iron to which the fpirits ftick, and leave the needle, which had taken no\ngreater quantity of them than what was requifite according to its capacity. But the\nmoil wonderful property in this ftone is, that it draws iron on one fide, and rejeds it\non the other, fo thatit appears in every loadftone that there are two polesof the world,\nthe north pole attrads iron, the fouth pole repels it ;\nbecaufe the fpirit of the north\npole enters in at the pores of the iron, but the fouthern cannot, for it ftrikes againft the\niron, and drives back too much its elaftic particles. This explication prefuppofes the\nbeing of fpirits and atoms, and their figures and motions, as alfo fmall occult vacui-\nties, which are difperfed through all bodies.\nThere are obferved to be many effeds for which no reafon can be given, without\nthe help of the word antipathy. We will inftance fome few : and, firft, of the ba-\nfilifk, who kills all whom he fees, which is by the antipathy fubfifting betwixt it\nand other animals ; but this is rather done by the emiffion of certain venomous fpirits,\nwhich\n\f(\nAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 3 ,\nwhich penetrate the eyes of thofe feen by the bafilifk ; the nature of this poifon\ncannot be explained, unlefs we know the occult property of poifon, becaufe poifon\nkillsonly by a contrariety betwixt us and it; whence we difcover the principle of this\ncontrariety of the bafilifk, that the fpirits. iffuing out of the pores of its eyes kill thofe\nanimals which they meet with, becaufe the fpirits penetrate them by their fubtilty,\norfharp figure, like needles piercing the heart. The poifon of vipers, and fuch like,\nis not fo acute nor fo deadly, nor fo ready in its effects, as that of the bafilifk. In\nreference to this matter, there are many things that are worth confidering. In the\nfirfl place, it is certain that the bafilifk is not engendered but in moift, deep, and dry\nplaces, as in the bottom of pits where there is nothing but muddy, thick, (link-\ning, water. In the fecond place, it is to be obferved, that, if you take a glafs, and\nhold it againfl the bafilifk\u2019s eyes, thofe fpirits which ififue from his eyes reflecting up-\non the glafs are lent back from whence they came, and will kill the bafilisk : now\nit cannot be faid that the bafilifk hates itfelf; but that the venomous fpirits, re-\nflecting from the glafs, receive a more violent motion, and forcibly drive back the\nother fpirits which are iffuing from his eyes, fo that they penetrate his brain and\nheart, and thence occafion his death ; in the fa me manner as vapours often arife\nwith fo great violence from the hypocondria, the mefentery, and the ftomach, into\nthe head, that they caufe an apoplexy, epileptic dizzinefs, or lethargy ; and fome-\ntimes they are carried with fuch fubtilty and violence into the heart, that the perfons\nfo affliCled die fuddenly.\nAflrange antipathy fubfifts in fome vegetables, as between the colewort and the\nvine, which, if planted near together, will infenfibly give back and lean fideways,\nas if they really hated one another. This effeCl cannot be afcribed to any thing but\nthe emifflon of the corpufcles and material fpirits of both of them, which rufh up-\non one another, and mutually repel, by the irregularity of their figures. This is ap-\nparent in the juice of coleworts, which if taken by a man when he is drunk, he pre-\nfently comes to himfelfand is fober j becaufe the corpufcles of the juice of coleworts\nblunt the corpufcles of the juice of the vine. In the fame manner, we find by expe-\nrience, that fpirit of opium or laudanum cures the cholic, head-ach, tooth-ach, and\nother kinds of pains it alfo cures the phrenfy, and procures deep. But there is\nneed of the greatefl care in ufing thefe narcotic medicines, becaufe it often happens\nthat the vital fpirits are fo flupified by them, that they are deprived of their motion,\nwhich caufes a deadly fleep. The colewort and the vine have not fo powerful an\neffe6l on each other, as narcotic medicines have on the animal fpirits ; for neither the\nvine nor the colewort will lean fideways if there be cloth or paper fet betwixt them,\nbecaufe the corpufcles flowing from each are then flopped in their way.\nA third\n\f$2 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nA third effeit, which is afcribed to antipathy, is obferved in the ufe of medicines,\nas well internal as external \u2022, the external, of which we now fpeak, are thole we carry\nabout us, which by their quality take away the malign air, and prefcrve us from the\nplague and other contagions, as prepared quickfilver, or a toad dried and fhut up\nin a box ; this phenomenon is afcribed to the peftiferous fpirits or corpufcles, which,\napproaching towards us, find fubjeils more apt for their reception, and fix in them,\nbut not in us, at leaft in fuch a quantity as to hurt us; which molt evidently ap-\npears in this, that the prepared quickfilver, or the toad, being once filled with\nthefe contagious atoms, become ufeleis, and ought to be changed and renewed ; and\nI know by experience that quickfilver, prepared white and fhining like an adamant,\nor polifhed filver, being carried about a perfon who is frequently with fick people,\nin time becomes black, fo that afterwards it ufelefs to him who carries it, becaule\nthere are nofmall vacuities left to retain the airy poifons ; but it may be renewed by\nanother preparation, whereby it may be made as white, tranfparent, and ufeful, as\nbefore. Quickfilver turns black more or lefs, fooner or later, according to the\nproportion of the greater or lefs malignity in the air, where the perfon goes, who\ncarries it about him \u2022, and thefe antidotes can never hurt, nay, if rightly prepared ,\nthey not only withftand the contagious air, when they hinder its nearer approach\ntowards us, but alfo fupprefs inward vapours, which, alcending into the head,\noccafion many diftempers. Thefe confequences, properly lpeaking, are the joint\neffcils of fympathy and antipathy ailing together!-, for the animal effluvia or corpuf-\ncles ififuing from our bodies, repel as much as poffible the malignity of the ambient\nmatter, by antipathy ; whilfl bodies compofed of poilonous or noxious particles,\ndraw to themfelves, by fympathy, the foul or poifonous atoms which furround them,\njuft the fame as the loadftone draws iron. In this we fee, and fhall hereafter prove,\nthat amulets or charms, worn about the body; that eledlricity, animal magnetifm,\nand other occult properties, ailing upon our bodies, though attributed to witch-\ncraft, or fome inexplicable caufe, are nothing more than the natural effcils of\nfympathy and antipathy, pre-ordained at the beginning of all things. Aromatic\nherbs, and fweet fuelling flowers, ufed againft infectious air, ait by repulfion, or\nantipathy ; whereas nightlhade, hemlock, and all poifonous herbs ail by fympathy,\ndrawing into their pores the infeilious atoms, juft the fame as horle-raddifh draws\nin vinegar ; and hence it follows that both thefe claflfes of plants are ufeful in pre-\nferving the animal juices from infeilion.\nI now proceed to effects internal. Rhubarb, and the leaves of fenna, purge\nmelancholy ; jalap and diagridium, phlegm and wateriffl humours. It is a conftant\nand certain truththat every purgative medicine comprehends in it certain fpirits\n2 or\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 33\nor corpufcles which are venomous, that is, acute, pungent, and biting ; fo that,\nnature being ftirred up by them, and thereby the internal parts and membranes be-\ning touched and agitated, the animal fpirits rufh together in order to affift the part\naffected, and draw with them the foreign humours which are lefs fixed ; and then\nnature, by the help of thefe fpirits, expels them by their proper paffages : fo that af-\nter a purgation by rhubarb, the urine is yellow, but, after fenna or caffia, it is dark\nand high coloured.\nThus fympathy and antipathy exift in all fubftances, whether animal, vegetable,\nor mineral-, and things of one clafs have affinity or correfpondence with things of\nanother clafs, or contrariwife, according to the nature and quality of the atoms or\ncorpufcles whereof they are formed. Hence it is that fo ftrong a fympathy exifts be-\ntween rue and the fig-tree ; and that the elm rejoiceth to cohabit with the vine; and\nhence it is likewife that ferpents preferve their fight by fennel; and that the hind\ndraws out the piercing dart with dittany, or garden ginger. Hence :lfo by antipathy\nwater and oil, and wine and the juice of hemlock, repel each other ; as does the\nvine and brafic plants, for the vine, which ufually entwines round everything it is\nnear, ffuns and inclines another way from thefe. Rue, and the afh-tree, are fo\ninimical to ferpents, that they cannot exift under their branches ; and the herb poly-\npody is fo obnoxious to crabs, that if they are covered over with its leaves, they will\nin a ihort time caft off their fhell and claws.\nFrom an'inveftigation of thefe properties in nature, medicine, and the art of hea-\nling, was fir ft difcovered. All things temperate in quality, concord fympathetical-\nly with our bodies, as fweet marjoram and nutmeg to the head, and wormwood to\nthe belly. Thofe wdiich exceed this medium in their temperaments, are noxious\nand hurtful ; and are the more dangerous or deadly, in proportion as they recede\nfrom the temperate quality, which we perceive in opium, arfenic, and the like.\nFrom this caufe we likewife find that fympathy and fimiJitude are fynonimous, and\nthat all fubftances which have refemblance by fignature, have fympathy and agree-\nment by nature, and lerve for the conlervation of each other. Thus fiilphur is found\nto preferve wine, which hath great analogy with our blood ; and if wood, or cables,\nor any thing whofe ufe is in the water, be done over with a preparation of the oil\nof fulphur, they will be preferved, in a molt fingular and remarkable manner,\nfrom injury or decay. From hence Paraceifus concludes, that the particles of ful-\nphur are of themfelves a balfam, fufficient to prevent wine, or any inanimate fub-\nftance from putrefadion ; and fo confer ves the body, that no adverfe qualities can\nprejudice or affed it. Querintius in his Pharmacy, affures us, that fulphur rightly\nprepared is the true balfam of the lungs, and the principal ingredient ufed by the\nNo. 3. K ancient\n\f34\nA KEY TO PHYSIC,\nancient Egyptians to embalm their mammies, or bodies of their deceafed nobles,\nwhereby they are preferved even to this day from putrefaction, as maybe feen in the\nBfitifh Mufeum, at Rackftrow\u2019s, and in mcft other magazins of curiofities. Sul-\nphur is certainly the efficient cauie of all mineral fprings ; of all cryftallizations, Hones,\npebbles, Sec. by which they concrete, and are held together, as is evident from lin-\nking them again it Heel, the fparks of fire produced being the fulphurous or inflam-\nmable part. All volcanos, burningmountains, and fubterraneous fires, are occafioned\nby fulphur ; as are likewife earthquakes, thunder and lightning, meteors, &c. The\nactive properties of fulphur are indeed wonderful ; and were I to inltance many that\nI have difeovered in the various chemical preparations I have made of it, few of my\nreaders would be difpofed to give me credit. For ten fucceffive years I applied my-\nielf to the daily toil of making chemical experiments ; and there is fcarcely an herb,\nor a mineral fubftance to be found, that I have not pafifed through the retort, or the\ncrucible, in order to afeertain their native qualities, and power of adtion, previous to\nthe invention of my Solar and Lunar Tindtures ; and I muftconfefs that the occult\nproperties of fulphur coft me more labour to fix, to inveftigate, and to afartain,\nthan all things elfe together, except mercury. And I do in confequence affirm, that\nthere are no mineral fubftances in the bowels of the earth, whofe virtues are not\ncommunicated to plants and herbs, growing on the earth\u2019s furface \u2022, and that the\ncorrefpondent virtues found in thefe herbs, are infinitely more pure, innocent, bal-\nfamic, nutritive, and better adapted to medicine, than any grofs or earthy particles\nwhatever. Even from the common herb borage, we can extradt nitre, fea fait,\ntartarum vitriolatum, and the common fixed alkali ; and it is no trivial informa-\ntion to the medical world, to know, that the three mineral acids are all to be found\nin one humblepiant. Indeed vegetables appear tobethe medium contrivedby an all-\nwife and omnipotent Creator, for feledting, concodting, and combining, the me-\ndical and occult virtues of the different fubftances found in the bowels of the earth,\nand for adapting their virtues by an eafy and natural concodtion to the alleviation of\nhuman infirmities; according to that paffage in fenpture which fays, that the Lord\nhath caufed medicine to grow out of the earth,\nand he that is wife will not abhor them, for\nwithfuch doth he heal men,\nand taketh away their pains. Eccl. xxxviii. 4, 7. Whence\nI conclude, that all diforders, incident to mankind, are to be cured, preferably,\nand more elegantly, more fafely, and certainly, by preparations from medical plants\nand herbs, than from any mineral fubftances whatever ; and that mercury, for the\nlues venerea, for the fcrophula, and impurities of the blood, ought to be wholly ex-\npunged from our pradtice. Its baneful effedts are every day more or lefs experien-\nced, in the rotten bones, and ruined conftitucions of thofe, who have habitually\ntaken\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 35\ntaken it in advertifed noftrums, for a certain complaint, until it has fixed itfelf,\nand the difeafe likewife, fo ftrongly in the habit, as to be almoft beyond the reach\nof a proper remedy, which in reality and truth can only be found in the vegetable\nworld.\nVegetables bear relation to the feven planets, and have form and affinity with the\nmicrocofm, or parts of man-, and conftitute the original aliment intended by the\nCreator for the fuftenance of our bodies. And whatever fignature or fimilitude a\nplant has with any member or part of our body, it will promote a cure in that\npart, and tends fympathetically to its comfort and prefervation. For example, thofe\nherbs which in any refpeft refemble the form of the eyes, are falubrious and heal-\ning to the eyes, as eyebright, fcabius, marigold, chamelion, fempervivum, nar-\ndum, and ftar-wort. So plants which refemble the head, are cephalic, and help the\ndiforders and infirmities thereof ;\nthe walnut refembles the brain : fo that if the oil\nor fpirit of the nut be applied to the head, it (Lengthens the fibres, and comforts the\nbrain. Maiden hair and the mofs of quinces have the figure of the hair of our head^\nand a decoftion of thefe herbs, in reftoring hair loft by the lues venerea, is wonderful-\nly efficacious. So plants, which in root, leaves, or fruit, refemble the figure of the\nheart, have a power of comforting and fuftaining the heart -,\nas the citron-apple,\nfuller\u2019s-thiftle, fpikenard, mint, balm, white-beet, trefoil, and mother-wort. Herbs\nwhich refemble the lungs, promote refpiration, and (Lengthen the lungs, as hounds-\ntongue, lung-wort, fage, camphorey, wall-wort, &c. Plants which refemble the\nears, conduce much to the relief of all diforders of the ears, as fools-foot, or wild\nfpikenard, which are a fpecific for deafnefs and fo an oil, extracted from the\n(hell of fea-fnails, which refembles the ear, has been found of wonderful efficacy in\nreftoring the faculty of hearing, even after feveral years deafnefs. The lenfe of\nfmelling is greatly promoted by the application of thofe herbs which refemble the\nnofe, as water-mint, &c. So plants that bear refemblance with the womb, conduce\nmuch to (Lengthen and comfort the fame, to purge the uterus, and promote fecun-\ndity, as the round birth-wort, briony, ladies-feal, heart- wort, fatyrium, and man-\ndrakes, which hath round and hollow roots. Plants which bear fimilitude with the\ngall and bladder, contribute to the benefit of thofe parts, by breaking the (lone,\n(Lengthening the urinary paffages, and bringing away the gravel ; as particularly\npointed out in my edition of Culpeper\u2019s Herbal. So likewife herbs and roots\nwhich bear affinity with the generative parts, contribute much to their virility,\n(Length, and vigour ; as truffles, potatoes, and the capfula of the cafhew-tree,\nwhich having fimilitude with the tefticles, wonderfully ftir up and promote the fe-\nmen ; as does the parfnip, the root of rag-wort, and the mangel-wurzel,\nor root of\nfcarcity.\n\fs6 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfcarcity, contribute much to ftimulate the virile member. Herbs having forma-\ntion like the milt, nourifh and preferve the fame, fuch as fpleen-worr, milt-wort,\nlupines, and ivy. Plants which in leaves or roots bear fignature with the liver, do\nwonderfully concur to promote a good digeftion and concaftion of the blood, to\nprevent the liver from decay, and to heal and cure all infirmities thereof ; fuch vir-\ntue has the herb trinity, agaric, liver-wort, fumitory, lent-figs, &c. Plerbs and\nfeeds refembling the teeth, confer much to the good and prefer vation of them ; as\ntooth-wort, the pine- kernel, and feeds of hemlock. Thole plants which have re-\nfembTance with the knuckles and joints of the body, are wonderfully efficacious\nagain ft the gout, white-fwelling, and all pains whatfoever in thejoints, fuch as ga-\nlingal, and knotty odoriferous ruffies, &c. Plants and herbs expreffing a natural\nfatnefs or oilinefs, encreafe corpulency, or fatnefs of the body, as all pulfe, almonds,\nand kernels of every kind \u2022, and, by the fame rule, thofe vegetables which have a\nlean and fpare defignation, macerate and reduce the body, fuch as farfaparilla, long,\nleafed rofa-folis, &c. Plants nervofus fupple and fortify the nerves and finews, as\nfennel, flax, hemp, the nettle, the herb neuras, and the root of mallows. Vegeta-\nbles pofiTeffing a milky j uice, propagate milk in all female animals ; and thofe pof-\nfeffing a ferous quality, purge the noxious humours between the fleffi and fkin, as\nfpurrage, fcammony, and the like. ' Plants that are hollow, as the ftalks of corn,\nreeds, leeks, mallows, hollyocks, garlic, and buglofs, are Angularly good to purge,\nopen, and comfort the porous and hollow organs of the body. St. John\u2019s-wort, ha-\nving its leaves perforated, is fanative to wounds ; and palma Chrifti, having in its\nroot a flrong refemblance of the hands and fingers, is remarkably healing to all cuts,\nburns, fcalds, and injuries thereof.\nThere is another fimilitude found between fome vegetables, and the brute fpecies,\nwhich diretfl us to a very curious occult virtue, in curing hurts or injuries received\nfrom thofe creatures they bear affinity with. Thus, the herb dragon, which in form\nrefembles a fnake, and the bramble called Chrifl\u2019s-thorn, having its thorns fet like\nthe teeth of ferpents, are an abfolute cure for the bite of thofe animals. Ragwort,\nwhich is like a bee, is the beft cure for the fling of bees. Fleabane, which grows\nas if covered with vermin, caufeth all fleas to avoid the room. Scorpion-grafs,\ndart-wort, and the flowers of turnfoil, having fimilitude with the tail of a fcorpion,\nhave furprifing efficacy in curing hurts by all venomous creatures.\nThe properties and virtues of plants are alfo known by the analogy oftheir form ;\nthofe of the fame or like figure having the fame or like virtues and ufes. Thus the\numbelliferous tribe have all a carminative tafle and fmell, and confequently pow-\nerful expellers of wind , and good in all flatulent diforders. The galeate or verticil-\nlate\n\f3?\nAND OCCULT SCIENCES.\nlate kind are all of them a degree warmer, and more potent, and therefore may be\nreputed aromatic, and proper for nervous diforders. The tetrapetalous kind are\nhot and biting, and exert their power by means of a diuretic volatile fait, with\nwhich they abound, and are therefore good in chronical difeafes, obftrudtions, ca-\ncochymias, &c.\nThe colour of plants and herbs likewife bear fimilitude or fympathy, and du\nredt us to a knowledge of their temperature and ufe ; thofe of a light colour, fuch\nas briony and water-lily, are profitable for the cure of phlegmatic difeafes. Thofe\nof a yellow afpedt, purge choler, and remove obftrudions occafioned thereby, as\nis the effedt of rhubarb, celandine. Sec. Thofe of a fanguine hue, purify the\nblood and juices, and contribute greatly to a good complexion, as the root of\nfernbrake, agrimony, germander, and forrel. And this rule is to be obferved\nwith refped to plants in general, that fo many diftind colours as it hath com-\nmixed, lo many virtues will it poflefs-, and whatever difeafe it bears analogy or\nfympathy with, that difeafe it will cure. The flower of the water-lily, bearing\nthe fignature of a drop of water, is a prefervative againft the apoplexy. The\nroot of fafifafras, and the {tones of cherries, are good againft the {tone and gravel\nin the bladder and kidneys. The feeds of marigolds, have refemblance with the\ncanker, and are a certain cure for that complaint. All plants of a glutinous na-\nture, having their {talks fignated with cuts and ftabs, are fanative to cuts, fears,\nand wounds. The root of galengal growing in marfhy grounds, and taken up\nin May or June, and worn as an amulet againft the belly, will perform moft\naftonifhing cures in the dyfentery and flux \u2022, it has a ftrong refemblance of the na-\ntural excrements, both in figure and colour. All the excrefcences of trees\narifing above the branches, are good againft excrefcences of the arteries. The\nftrawberry, very much refembles puftules of the leprofy ; and the diftilled water\nof ftrawberries is a moft admirable cure for that complaint, as well as for red and\npimpled faces.\nWe may further remark, that the more fignatures or fimilitudes are found\ncohering in a plant to one and the fame fignification, fo much the more powerful\nand efficacious will its operation be, in any of the purpofes for which it is applied ;\nfor the fpirit is in quality the fame in all bodies, but different in quantity, which\nconftitutes that variety or difference rerceivable by our fenfes. In fome bodies,\nthis fpirit is more copious and adtive \u2022, in others, more fparing and debilitated-, fo\nthat, by how much the more the fame fpirit produces a convenient form and figure,\nin divers things or fubjedts under the fame climate, by fo much the more the fame\nfubjefts are enabled to fympathize with, and affift, each other. For fympathy is\nNo. 3. L by\n\f3 S A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nby the fpirit ; and fimilitude points out the things that adt by fympathy. Hence\nit is that fimilitude of affedtion encreafes ftrength, and the contrary, hatred. So\nit is that plants whofe parts referable the fcorpion, as libards-bane, hellebore, and\naconitum, will cure the bite of that reptile \u2022, and that the flowers of plants, having\nthe refemblance of butterflies, conduce to fruitfulnefs and virility, as gandergoofe,\nthe flower of beans, woodbine, and rag-wort. Plants fpotted like ferpents, as cow-\ngarlic, wake-robin, dragons-wort, fea-dragon, &c. are fanative againft the bite cf\nferpents \u2022, and plants, which refemble the head of fuch animals, are alfo good againft\ntheir poifon ; as the flowers of wild buglofs, which refemble the head of a viper,\nDiofcorides affirms to be a certain cure.\nThe virtues of plants and herbs, are however, variable, and liable to be injur-\ned by change of climate, which will alter or deftroy them, as we fee in many of the\nmedical plants of other countries, brought into England \u2022, which, though they feem\nto fiourifh with us, never poffefs their virtues in the fame excellent degree as in\ntheir own climate, which is the reafon that Culpeper recommends Engliffi herbs\nfor an Englifh conftitution. The bodies of different animals alfo render the effedt\nof the fame plant different ; the tithymals or fpurges, being all very violent cathar-\ntics when taken by us \u2022, but yet, they are eaten by goats, and feveral other animals,\nwithout any purgative effedt, and feem to give them a particular fhare of vigour\nand fpirits. Fifties, on the contrary, are more ftrongly affedted by them, than we\nare \u2022, for the juice of fpurge, made into a pafte with flower and honey, will fo much\nintoxicate them, that they may betaken out of the water with one\u2019s hand. Again,\nbitter almonds are of no ill confequence to us, yet they kill all forts of birds that\ntouch them.\nThe foregoing notions may be ridiculed, from their extreme fimplicity ; yet where\nis the man, at all converfant with natural philofophy and phyftc, and poffeffed of\nan impartial mind, that will dare to controvert thefe fadts ? Every wayfaring man\nknows fomething of the herbs I have mentioned, and is capable ofjudging of their\nfimilitude and fympathy. Let him apply them for the purpofes I have pointed out,\nand their occult properties will foon be vifible to his fenfes. The track of nature\nis a plain and obvious road, abounding with molt pleafing profpedts, and the fureft\nguides. God, in the plenitude of his omnifcience and mercy, feems to have fet a\nmark on the minuteft particles of his creation, for man\u2019s information and benefit\nin the contemplation of which, our happinefs, as well as our health, will invaria-\nbly be found.\nOf\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 39\nOf the OCCULT PROPERTIES of GENERATION\nin PLANTS and PI E R B S.\nALL plants are produced from feeds, as all animals are produced from eggs,\nand the procefs of nature is very fimilar in both kinds of generation. The fmalleft\nvegetables have feeds, though often not difcoverable by the naked eye. Miftletoe is\nalfo known to be produced from feed-, and the fefiile a.^d Hat fungufes, which\nfome confider as morbid excrefcences, are true fpecies of thofe agarics, which are\nfurnifhed with caps and ftems, and grow on the ground, whofe feeds falling on a\nmoift tree, produce, as it were, half caps without ftems. Beftdes, that feeds are\nthe eggs of plants, appears from hence, that as every egg produces an offspring\nfimilar to the parent, fo do alfo the feeds of vegetables, and, therefore, 'they alfo\nare eggs. A feed refembles the egg of an hen as this, as well as the egg, has a\n(hell, external membrane or film, a membrane including the yolk, the yolk itfelf,\nand the fear or point of life. In feeds, the white is wanting, becaufe the moifture\nof the earth fupplics its place, and nourifhes the embryo of the plant. When the\nflower is going off, the feed begins to fwell, and on the outfide there is feen a ve-\nficle, which is the amnion, furnifhed with an umbilical chord or navel-firing,\nwhich is introduced through the chorion to the oppofite fide of the egg. While\nwith the egg, the amnion increafeth, on its top is obferved another fmall body,\nwhich likewife increafeth continually, till it has filled the whole chorion and egg-,\nand the amnion and chorion are turned into the external fhell or coat of the feed.\nThus, as the fame changes are brought about on the feed as in the egg, the feeds\nmu ft be the eggs of plants. Farther, that plants fpring from eggs, is plain from\nthe lobes, which, when we fpeak of cows and fimilar quadrupeds, are nothing\nelfe than feveral fecundines, always adhering to the foetus, drawing their fupply\nof fluids from the matrix, which fluids they prepare for the nourifhment of the\ntender foetus. That moft plants have feminal leaves or lobes is very well known.\nThefe feminal leaves once conftituted the whole feed, except the hilum, or littie\nheart, in which is the point of life -, and thefe lobes prepare the nourifhment for\nthe very tender plant, until it be able to ftrike root in the earth ; in the fame\nmanner as the yolk in an egg, becoming the placenta, prepares the nourifhment,\nand fends it by the navel-ftring to the chick after which they drop off. Hence\nit appears, that the feminal leaves are the lobes; but fince all lobes proceed from\nthe egg or feed, we may fairly conclude that plants are produced from eggs. But,\nas no egg can produce an animal till it be impregnated or fecundated by the male,,\nit will be neceflary to inveftigate the fituation of the genital organs deftined by na-\nture for this purpofe in plants.\nIt\n\f4\u00a9 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nIt is plain, that the genital organs of plants muff be ficuated where the feeds\nare produced, but the feeds are produced where the flower and fruit are ; therefore\nin the flower and fruit are the genital organs of plants. And as there was never a\nclear and evident example produced of any plant which wanted flowers and fruit,\nthough they might not be diftindily known on account of their exceeding minute-\nnefs, we may jufcly fay, that the eflence of plants confifts in their fructification.\nMoreover, as generation precedes the birth in animals, the flower in plants\nalways precedes the fruit; and, therefore, we are neceffarily led to afcribe fecun-\ndation to the flower, and the birth or exclufion of the feed to the ripe fruit. The\nflower may, confequently, be defined to be the genital organs of a plant, ferving\nfor fecundation, and the fruit to be the genital organs ferving for the birth or\nmaturation of the feed. And, fince we know that there are many plants, iome\nof which want the calyx, others the corolla, others the filaments of the ftamina,\nand others the ftyle ; but that all flowers, the moflfes only excepted, are furnifhed\nwith the antherae,- or ftigmata, or both together-, thefe parts muff conftitute the\neflence of the flower. If we find a flower with antherae, but no ftigmata, we may alfo\nafluredly find another flower either in the fame, or a different plant of the fame fpe-\ncies, which has ftigmata with the antherae, or without them. The a<ft of fecundation\nis performed in the flower, and, therefore, the genital organs of both fexes rnuft be\nprefent in the flower -, not, indeed, always in one and the fame flower, but it is\nfufficient that thofe of the male be in one flower, and thofe of the female in ano-\nther ;\nand thefe genital organs are the antherae and ftigmata. The antherae, or\nmale organs of generation in flow'ers, are nothing elfe but the bodies which pre-\npare and contain the male fperm therefore thefe antherae are the tefticles toge-\nther with the feminal veficles, and their duft the genuine male fperm of plants,\nanfwering to thofe particles which are called animalcules in the male fperm of\nanimals. This propofition may be evinced by the following arguments : the\nantherae and the duft always come before the fruit-, and, when they fhed their\nduft, which they do before the flower has attained its full vigour, they have per-\nformed their office, and then drop and become ufelefs. Beftdes, the antherae are\nfo fituated in the flower, that their duft, which is the male fperm, may reach the\npiftil or female organs ; for the ftamina either furround the piftil, as in moft\nflowers, or if the piftil incline to the upper fide of the flower, the ftamina do the\nfame-, ct if the piftil nods, the ftamina afcend.\nFarther, the antherae and ftigmata are in full vigour at the fame time, both\nwhen they are in the fame flower, and when they are in feparate flowers. More-\nover, if we cut afunder the anthers before they have fhed their duft, their\nftru&ure will be found altogether as wonderful and curious as that of the feed-\nveflels\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 4 *\nveffels themfelves \u2022, for within, they confift of one, two, three, or four, cells\n;\nand they open either longitudinally, or at the bale, feparating into pieces or\nvalves, or from the top, or at the two points or horns. And, if we cut off the\nanther\u00ae of any plant which bears but one flower, taking care at the fame time\nthat no other plant of the lame lpecies is near it, the fruit proves abortive, or at\nlead produces feeds which will not vegetate. Finally, the figure of the fertilizing\ndull will clearly convince any one, that this fine powder is not accumulated by\nchance, or from the drynefs of the anther\u00ae.\nThe powder of the anther\u00ae, in point of fecundation, anfwers to the animalcules\nin the male fperm ; and the ftigma which receives this duft is always moiftilh,\nthat the duff may inftantly adhere or flick to it. That the ftigmata, which are\nthe other effential parts of the flower, are the female organ of generation, may be\nproved by the following confiderations : the parts of the piftiilum are the ger-\nmen, the ftyle, and the ftigma ; the germen, or feed-bud, while the plant is in\nflower, is always imperfeeft and immature, being only the rudiment of the future\nfoetus ; the ftyle is no effential part, for it is wanting in many fpecies of plants\n;\nbut the germen can never bring the fruit to maturity, except it be within the\nflower along with the ftigma. Hence it follows, that the ftigma is that part of\nthe flower which receives the impregnating duft. This will farther appear, if we\nconfider, that the ftigma is always fo fituated, that the anther\u00ae, or their impregnating\nduft, can reach it: moreover, it has always a figure peculiar to itfelf, fo that in\nmoft (though not all) plants it is double when the fruit confifts of two cells ; triple\nwhen the leed-veffel has three cells \u2022, quadruple when it has four cells, &c. Again,\nthe ftigmata are always in full vigour at the fame time with the anther\u00ae : befides,\nthe ftigmata in moft plants, when they have difeharged their office, drop off in\nthe fame manner as the anther\u00ae do *, which proves, that the ftigmata contribute\nnothing to the ripening of the fruit, but ferve only for the purpofe of genera-\ntion. If the ftigmata be cut off before they have received the impregnating duft\nof the anther\u00ae, the plant is caftrated as to the female organs, and the fruit\nperilhes. The ftigma of the flower has, befides, two other Angular properties \u201e\u2022\nviz. that it is always diverted of the cuticle or film, nor has it any bark as the\nother parts have, and then it is always bedewed with a moifture. Upon the\nwhole it appears, that the generation of plants is accompliftied by the anther\u00ae ffied-\nding their duft on the ftigmata. In the generation of animals, we are certain, tfrat\nthe male fperm muft come in contact with the female organ, if there be any irrw\npregnation. In the vegetable kingdom the genital duft is carried by tlje air to the\nmoift ftigmata, where the particles burft and difeharge their exceeding fine or\nNo. 3.

This will appear if it be confi-\ndered, that when a plant is in flower, and the dull of the anthers flying about,\npart of this duft vifibly lights upon and clings to the ftigma; the ftamina and\npiftillum are generally of the fame height, that the male duft may more eafily\ncome at the ftigma, and in thofe plants where this is not the cafe, a Angular pro-\ncefs of fecundation may be obferved ; thus in the African tree crane\u2019s-bill, or\ngeranium inquinans, where the piftillum is fhorter than the ftamina, the flowers before\nthey blow are pendulous, but upon their opening they ftand upright, that the\npowder may fall upon the ftigma ; after which they again nod till the fruit is ripe,\nand then ftand upright a fecond time, that their feeds may be more eafily fcattered\nabout. In forne of the pinks, the piftilla, which are longer than the ftamina, are\nbent back like rams horns towards the anthers.\nAgain, the ftamina for the moft part furround the piftillum, fo that forne of\nthe duft is always blown by the wind on the ftigma. Moreover, the ftamina and\npiftillum come at the fame time, not only in one and the fame flower, but alfo\nwhere forne are male and others female, on the fame plant, very few excepted.\nFarther, in almoft all forts of flowers we fee how they expand or open by the\nheat of the fun, but in the evening and a moift ftate of the air, they clofe or\ncontract their flowers, left the moifture getting to the duft of the anthers fhould\ncoagulate the fame, and render it incapable of being blown on the ftigma > but\nwhen once the fecundation is over, the flowers neither contradl in the evening, nor\nyet againft rain. The wind on many occafions ferves as a vehicle for bringing the\nfarina of the males to the females. M. Geoffroy cites a ftory from Jovius Pon-\ntanus, who relates, that in his time there were two palm-trees, the one male,\ncultivated at Brindifi, the other female, in the wood of Otranto, fifteen leagues\napart ; that this latter was feveral years without bearing any fruit ; till at length,\nrifing above the other trees of the foreft, fo as it might fee (fays the poet) the\nmale palm-tree at Brindifi, it then began to bear fruit in abundance. M. GeofFroy\nmakes no doubt but that the tree then only began to bear fruit, becaufe, it was\nin a condition to catch on its branches the farin a of the male brought thither by\nthe wind. In the male and females of the piftachia-nut-tree they obferve the fame\nmethod as in thofe of the date-tree. We may obferve farther, that fince the male\nduft is generally of greater fpecific gravity than the air, in moft plants that have\nthe piftillum longer than the ftamina, the all-wife Creator has made the flowers\nnodding, that the powder may more eafily reach the ftigma. With refpedt to\nthofe plants, whofe ftems grow under water, the flowers, a little before they\nblow, emerge or rife above the furface of the water j and thofe, all whofe parts\ngrow\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 43\ngrow under water, about the time of flowering, raife their genital items above\nthe water, which items fink again as foon as the time of generating is over. A\nfimilar conclufion may be farther eitablifhed from the confideration oi all forts of\nflowers ;\nbut enough has been faid to prove, that the generation of plants is per-\nformed by the genital duftof the antherae falling on the moiit itigma or female\norgan, which duit, by the help of the moifture, adheres and burits, difcharging\nits contents, the fubtile particles of which are abforbed by the ftyle, into the ova-\nrium, germen, or feed- bud. However, the duft of the antherae does not penetrate\nthrough the ftyle to the germen and rudiments of the feed, as fome writers have\nfuppofed : the contrary appears to be cafe from opening a flower of the oriental\nrough poppy, with a large flower, cutting its piftillum perpendicularly down-\nwards \u2022, and the lamellae or folds, the placentae and the fmall feeds fticking to\nthem will be found of a pure white colour, though at the fame time the ftyle and\nall the ftigma are wholly tinged with a purple hue from the duft of the antherae.\nHence we may conclude, that not one grain or particle of the farina enters the folds\nof the receptacle or feeds themfelves.\nWe may clofe this account with obferving upon the whole, that the calyx is\nthe marriage-bed, in which the ftamina and piftilla, the male and female organs,\ncelebrate the nuptials of plants, and where they are cherifhed and defended from\nexternal injuries : the corolla or petals are the curtains, clofely furrounding the\ngenital organs, in order to keep off ftorm, rain, or cold ; but, when the fun\nfhines bright, they freely expand, both to give accefs to the fun\u2019s rays, and the\nfecundating duft: the filaments are the fpermatic veflfels by which the juice, fe-\ncreted from the plant, is carried to the antherte ; the antherae are the tefticles, and\nmay not improperly be compared to the foft roe or milt of fifties : the duft of the\nantherae anfwers to the fperm and feminal animalcules ; for, though it is dry, that\nit may be the more eafily conveyed by the wind, yet it gets moifture upon touch-\ning the ftigma : the ftigma is that external part of the female organ, which re-\nceives the male duft, and on which the male duft adts : the ftyle is the vagina or\ntube, through which the effluvia of the male duft pafs to the germen or feed- bud :\nthe germen is the ovary, for it contains the unimpregnated or unfertilized feeds\n:\nthe pericarpium or feed-veflel, anfwers to the impregnated ovary, and in fadt is\nthe fame with the germen or feed-bud, only increafed in bulk and loaded with\nfertile feeds \u2022, the feeds are the eggs. Moreover, the calyx is a production of the\nexternal bark of the plant \u2022, the corolla of the inner bark ; the ftamina of the al-\nburnum or white fap ; the pericarpium or feed-veflel of the woody fubftance j\nand the feeds of the pith of the tree -\n3 for in this manner they are placed, and in\nthis\n>\n\f4* A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthis they are alfo unfolded \u2022, fo that in the flower we find all the internal parts of a\nplant unfolded.\nThe ftomach of plants is the earth, from which they receive their nourifhment,\nand the fineft and moft fubtile parts of its foil is their chyle : the root, which car-\nries the chyle from the \u2022ftomach to the body of the plant is analogous to the lafteals\nor chyliferous vefiels of animals : the trunk, which fupports and gives fcrength to\nthe whole plant, is analogous to the bones : the leaves, by which plants tranlpire,\nare inflead of lungs, and they may be alfo compared to the mufcles of animals, for\nby their agitation with the wind the plant is put in motion ; on which account\nherbs furnifhed with leaves cannot thrive, except they have air* but fucculent\nplants which have no leaves, though {hut up in green-houfes and quite deprived of\nthe external air, thrive very well : heat is to plants analogous to the heart in animals,\nfor they have no heart nor have they occafion for any ; becaufe they live like po-\nlypes in the animal kingdom \u2022, their juices mixed with air being propelled through\ntheir vefiels, but not circulated back again by returning vefiels. Plants have ge-\nnerally their genital organs placed at their ramifications, as animals have theirs at\nthe ramification of the iliac vefiels, with this difference, that the ramifications of\nplants afcend, whereas thofe of animals go downwards or backwards j whence the\nancients called a plant an inverted animal. Pliny obferves, that there is in plants\na natural inftimft to generation, and that the males by a certain blafi, and fubtle\npowder, do confummate their nuptials <?n the females. For the manner wherein the\nfarina fecundifies, M. Geoffroy advances two opinions i. That the farina being\nalways found of a fulphureous compofition, and full of fubtile penetrating parts (as\nappears from its fprightly odour), falling on the pifbils of the flowers, there refolves,\nand the fubtilefi; of its parts, penetrating the fubftance of the piftil and the young\nfruit, excite a fermentation fufficient to open and unfold the young plant, inclofed\nin the embryo of the feed. In this hypothefis the feed is fuppofed to contain the\nplant in miniature, and only to want a proper juice to unfold its parts, and make\nthem grow. The fecond opinion is, that the farina of the flower is the firft germ\nor bud of the new plant, and needs nothing to unfold it, and enable it to grow, but\nthe juice it finds prepared in the embryos of the feed. Thefe two theories of veget-\nable generation, the reader will obferve, bear a ftrift analogy to thofe two of animal\ngeneration \u2022, viz. either that the young animal is in the femen mafculinum, and only\nneeds the juice of the matrix to cherifli and bring it forth *, or that the animal is\ncontained in the female ovum, and needs only the male feed to excite a fermenta-\ntion, &c. M. Geoffrey rather takes the proper feed to be in the farina j inafmuch\nas the beft microfcopes do not difeover the lead: appearance of any bud in the little\n* embryos\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 45\nembryos of the grains, when examined before the apices have flied their duft. In\nleguminous plants, if the leaves and ftamina be removed, and the piftil, or that\npart which becomes the pod, be viewed with the microfcope, before the flower\nbe opened ; the little green tranfparent veficulae, which are to become the grains,\nwill appear in their natural order; but ftill fhewing nothing elfe but the mere coat\nor (kin of the grain. If the obfervation be continued for feveral days fucceffively,\nin othef flowers, as they advance, the veficulae will be found to fwell, and by degrees\nto become replete with a limpid liquor ; wherein, when the farina comes to be fhed,\nand the leaves of the flower to fall, we obferve a little greenifh fpeck, or globule, float-\ning about at large. At firft there is not any appearance of organization in this little\nbody ; but in time, as it grows, we begin to diftinguifh two little leaves like two\nhorns. The liquor diminifhes infenfibly, as the little body grows, till at length\nthe grain becomes quite opake ; when, upon opening it, we find its cavity filled\nwith a young plant in miniature j confifting Of a little germ or plunnda, a little root,\nand the lobes of the bean, or pea, &c.\nThe manner wherein this germ of the apex enters the veficula of the feed, is not\nvery difficult to determine. For, befides that the cavity of the piftil reaches from\nthe top to the embryos of the grains, thofe grains or veficulae have a little aperture\ncorrefponding to the extremity of the cavity of the piftil, fo that the fmall duft, or\nfarina, may eafily fall through the aperture into the mouth of the veficulae, which\nis the embryo of the grain* This cavity, or cicatricula, is much the fame in moft\ngrains, and it is eafily obferved in peas, beans, &c. without the microfcope. The\nroot of the little germ is juft againft this aperture, and through this it pafies out\nwhen the little grain comes to germinate.\nFrom what has been faid, it becomes evident, that unlefs the female plant is im-\npregnated by the male, it can bring forth no fruit, nor feed, that will grow. This\nholds good throughout the whole fyftem of vegetation. But as trees and plants are\nimmovably fixed, and cannot like animals rove about in fearch of a mate, the all-\nwife Creator has compenfated this, by means of little infefts, the bee, and the winds,\nwhich doubtlefs carry the pollen, or fecundating matter of the male, to the piftilla\nof the female, whereby impregnation and generation follows. But as this, in the\nproduction offruits, is rather a fortuitous event, which fometimes happens in profu-\nfioft, artdat others but fparingly, thofe who cultivate fruits have been led by art,\nto affift nature, in this necefiary contaft of the fexes. While in Arabia, I was taken\nto feethiscurious Operation performed on the date-tree, by which the Arab\u2019s always\nfecuretothemfelves a plentiful harveft of that fruit, which is of fo much importance\nto their traffic, and araongft whom this art appears to have been known long before\n\u2018\n' No. 4. N any\n\f46 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nany botanift dreamed of the difference of fexes in vegetables. Of this the gardener\ninformed me, but was furprifed to find I knew the cireumftance before ;\nfor, fays\nhe, all who come from Europe to this country, have regarded this operation as a\nfable. When they obferve a tree where the fpadix has female flowers, they fearch\non a tree that has male flowers, (which they know by cuftom and experience) for a\nmale fpadix, which has not yet burfl: out of its fpatha or hufk \u2022, this they open,\ntake out the fpadix, and cut it lengthwife infeveral pieces, taking care not to hurt\nthe flowers. Thefe pieces of fpadix with male flowers, they put lengthwife between\nthe fmall branches of the fpadix which hath female flowers, and then cover them\nover with a palm leaf ; in this fituation the piftilla of the female flower becomes im-\npregnated by the male, which foon after withers and dies ; and unlefs the natives\nthus wed and fecundate the female date-tree, it bears no fruit. Or even if they\npermit the fpadix of the male flower to burfl, or come out, before it is taken, it is\nufelefs for fecundation ; it mufl for this purpofe have its maidenhead, as the Arabs\nterm it, or it will not do j and this is loft the fame moment the bloffoms burfl out\nof their cafe. From this curious procefs of nature in the generation of vegetables,\nand from a contemplation of the apparatus fhe has contrived for that purpofe, ma-\nny ufeful hints may be derived how to alter, improve, enrich, and vary the tafte,\nform, and quality, of fruits, &c. by impregnating the flower of one with the farina\nof another of the fame clafs ; and to this artificial coupling and mixing it is, that\nthe numberlefs varieties of new fruits, flowers, &c. produced every year by our\nnurferymen and gardeners, with many other phenomena in the vegetable kingdom,\nare to be attributed.\nIn the cultivation of many of our home plants, we fometimes meet with circum-\nftances not unfimilar to thofe of the date-tree, which become barren when deprived\nof the males. Thus if the flowers of the male hemp are pulled off before thofe of\nthe female are fully expanded, the females do not produce fertile feeds. But as a\nmale flower is fometimes found upon a female plant, this may be the reafon why fer-\ntile feeds are fometimes produced even after this precaution has been obferved. The\ntulip affords another experiment to the fame purpofe.\u2014Cut off all the antherae of a\nred tulip before the pollen is emitted ; then take the ripe antherse of a white tulip,\nand throw the pollen of the white one upon the ftigma of the red ; the feeds of the\nred tulip being thus impregnated by one of a different complexion, will next feafon\nproduce fome red, fame white, but moftly variegated flowers.\nIn the year i744,Linnteus publilhed a defcription of a new genus, which he called\npeloria, on the fuppofition of its being a hybrid or mule plant, i. e. a plant produced\nby an unnatural commixture of tyvo different genera. The root, leaves, caulis, &c.\nof\n\f47\nAND OCCULT SCIENCES.\nof this plant are exceedingly fimilartothofe of the antirrhinum linaria ; but the flow-\ner and other parts of the fru&ification are totally different. On account of its fimi-\nlarity to the linaria in every part but the flower, Linnaeus imagined it to have been\nproduced by a fortuitous commixture of the linaria with fome other plant \u2022, and\nfrom this dodtrine he fuppofes that only two fpecies of each genus of plants exifted ab\nengine, and that all the variety of fpecies which now appear have been produced by un-\nnatural embraces betwixt fpecies of different genera. Under this head he defends the\ncafe of Richard Baal, gardener at Brentford. This Baal fold a large quantity of the\nfeeds of the braflica florida to leveral gardeners in the fuburbs of London. Thefe\ngardeners, after fowing their feeds in the ufual manner, were furpriled to find them\nturn out to be plants of a different fpecies, from that which Baal made them believe\nthey had purchafed j for, inftead of the braflica florida, the plants turned out to be\nthe braflica longifolia. The gardeners, upon making this difeovery, commenced a\nprofecution of fraud againft Baal in Wcftminfter-hall. The court found Baal guil-\nty of fraud, and decerned him not only to reftore the price of the feeds, but like-\nwife to pay the gardeners for their loft time, and the ufe of their ground. \u201c Had\nthefe judges (fays Linnaeus) been acquainted with the fexual generation of plants,\nthey would not have found Baal guilty of any crime, but would have aferibed the\naccident to the fortuitous impregnation of the braflica florida by the pollen of the\nbraflica longifolia.\u201d\nWith refpeft to the nourifhment of plants, we need only recur to the analogy that\nis known to fubfift between plants and animals. It is highly probable that the ra-\ndical fibres of plants take up their nourifhment from the earth, in the fame manner\nthat the ladteal veffels abforb the nutriment from the inteftines ; and, as the oily\nand watery parts of our food are perfeftly united into a milky liquor, by means of\nthe fpittle, pancreatic juice, and bile, before they enter the latfteals, we have all\nthe reafon imaginable to keep up the analogy, and fuppofe that the oleaginous and\nwatery parts of the foil are alfo incorporated, previous to their being taken up by\nthe abforbing veffels of the plant. To form a perfect judgment of this, we muft\nreflect that every foil, in a ftate of nature, has in itfelf a quantity of abforbent\nearth, fufficient to incorporate its inherent oil and water ; but when we load it with\nfat manures, it becomes effentially neceffary to beftow upon it, at the fame time,\nfomething to aflimilate the parts. Lime, foap-afhes, kelp, marl, and all the al-\nkaline fubftances, perform that office. In order to render this operation vifible to\nthe fenfes, diffolve one drachm of Ruffia pot-afh in four ounces of water ; then add\none fpoonful of oil \u2022, ffiake the mixture, and it will inftantly become an uniform\nmafs of a whitiffi colour, adapted to all the purpofes of vegetation. This eafy and\nfamiliar\n\f43 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfamiliar experiment is a juft reprefentation of what happens after the operation of\nburn-baking, and, confequently, may be confidered as a confirmation of the hy-\npothefis advanced. In this procefs, the fward being reduced to afhes, a fixed al-\nkaline fait is produced ; the moifture of the atmofphere foon reduces that fait into\na fluid ftate, which, mixing with the foil, brings about an union of the oily and\nwatery parts, in the manner demonftrated in the experiment. When the under-\nftratum confifts of a rich vegetable mould, the effects of burn-baking will be lad-\ning \u2022, but when the foil happens to be thin and poor, the firft crop frequently\nfuffers before it arrives at maturity. The farmer, therefore, who is at the expence\nof parring and burning a thin foil, Ihould beftow upon it a portion of rotten dung,\nor fhambles manure, before the allies are fpread, in order to fupply the deficiency\nof oily particles: in this way the crop will be fupported during its growth, and\nthe land will be preferved in health and vigour. But plants not only receive nou-\nrilhment by their roots, but alfo by their leaves. Vegetables that have a fucculent\nleaf, fuch as vetches, peas, beans, and buck-wheat, draw a great part of their nou-\nrifhment from the air, and on that account impoverilh the foil lefs than wheat, oats,\nbarley, or rye, the leaves of which are of a firmer texture. Rape and hemp are\noil-bearing plants, and, confequently, impoverilhers of the foil ; but the former lefs\nfo than the latter, on account of the greater fucculency of its leaf. The leaves of\nall kinds of grain are fucculent for a time, during which period the plants take little\nfrom the earth \u2022, but as foon as the ear begins to be formed, they lofe their foftnefs,\nand diminilh in their attractive power. The radical fibres are then more vigoroufly\nemployed in extracting the oily particles of the earth for the nourifhment of the\nfeed. The leaves of plants ferve, not only as excretory duCts to feparate and carry\noff the redundant watery fluid, which, by being long detained in the plants, would\nturn rancid and prejudicial to them, but likewife to imbibe the dew, and rain, which\ncontain fait, fulphur, &c. and to be of the fame ufe to plants, that the lungs are to\nanimals. But as plants have not a dilating and contracting thorax, their infpirations\nand expirations will not be fo frequent as thofeof animals, but depend wholly on\nthe alternate changes from hot to cold for infpiration, and vice verfa for expiration.\nBut the greater part of their nourifhment is derived from the roots. Thefe, there-\nfore, are found to bear a confiderable proportion to the body of the plant above\nground the fuperficies of the former being above four-tenths of that of the latter.\nHence appears theneceffity of cutting off many branches from a tranfplanted tree;\nbecaufe in digging it up, a great part of their roots is cut off.\nIt is a curious occult faCt, with refpeCt to vegetables, that they thrive beft from\nputrefaction, and flourifh moft in putrid air.

Yet it is as true, that though thefe vegetables eagerly fuck in and imbibe\nfo foul a moifture, and thrive in air fo ftrongly tainted with putrefafticn, even\nin fuch as would prove fatal' to human life, yet thofe very plants exhale a di red\noppofite effluvia, tending to refrefh and fweeten the atmofphere, and to render\nit wholefome, when it is become noxious in conlequence of epidemical complaints,\nor of animals dying and putrifying in it ; whence it follows that vegetables draw in\nthe foul orinfeded corpufcles, as favourable to their fuftenance, which being con-\ncoded, altered, and changed in thebody of the plant, it again emits them purified and\nfweet. This I have proved by the following experiment. A quantity of air was\nmade thoroughly noxious, by fome mice breathing and dying in it. This I divided\ninto two parts, in glafs receivers. Into one Iput a moufewitha fprig of mint, which\nlived very well, and the mint alfo flourifhed ; but in the other, where there was no\nmint, the moufe died almoft immediately. This experiment I have many times re-\npeated with d\u2019fferent kinds and portions of infeded air, and have always found the\nrefult nearly the fame \u2022, wherefore this plain reafoning follows j that as vegetables\ndraw in by their leaves and roots the putrid effluvium of the air, fo their emifflonof\npurified corpufcles contributes to make the remaining air more fit and wholefome\nfor refpiration ; and from this circumftance I recommend all perfons who vifit the\nfick, or have putrid diforders in their families, to uie as many frefii vegetables as\npoffible, and never to be without fome fprigs of mint about them.\nOf SYMPATHY, ANTIPATHY, SAGACITY,\nand OCCULT INSTINCT, in BRUTES.\nBRUTE, is a general name given to all animals, except man \u2022, and an animal\nmuft be an organized living body, endowed with fenfe ;\nfor minerals are laid to\ngrow and increafe, plants to grow and live; but animals alone are endowed with\nfenfation. It is this property of fenfation alone, that conftitutes theefiential charac-\nteriftic of an animal ; and by which the animal and vegetable kingdoms ieem to be\nfo materially feparated. Thofe naturalifts, who have fuppofed the diftindtion between\nanimals and vegetables to confifl in any thing elfe than the gift of fenfation, have\nfound themfclves greatly embarraffed ; and have generally agreed, that it was ex-\ntremely difficult, if not impoffible, to fettle the boundaries between the animal and\nvegetable kingdoms. But this difficulty will be eafily feen to arife from their tak-\ning the charafteriftic marks of the animal kingdom, from fomething that was evi-\ndently common to both. Thus Boerhaave attempted to diftinguifh an animal from\nNo. 4. O a veget-\n\f50 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\na vegetable, by the former having a mouth, which the latter has not : but here, as\nthe mouth of an animal is only the inftrument by which nouriihment is conveyed to\nits body, it is evident that this can be no effential diftindtion, becaufe vegetables, as\nwe have above demonftrated, require nouriihment, and have inftruments proper for\nconveying it into their bodies ; and where the end is the fame, a difference in the\nmeans can never be effential. The fixing the difference in an animal\u2019s having a gula,\nftomach, and inteftines, as is done by Dr. Tyfon, is as little to the purpofe.\nThe power of moving from one place to another, hath by many been thought to\nconftitute their effential difference ; and indeed, in mofl cafes, it is the obvious mark\nby which we diftinguifh an animal from a vegetable : but Lord Karnes hath giv-\nen us feveral very curious inftances of the locomotive power of plants; fome of\nwhich, would doubtlefs do honour to an animal.\u2014Upon the flighteft touch, the\nfenfitive plant * fhrinks back, and folds up its leaves, fimilar to a fnail ; which on\nthe flighteft touch retires within its fhell. If a fly perch upon one of its flower-leaves,\nit clofes inftantly, and crufhes the infedt to death. There is not an article in botany\nmore admirable than a contrivance, viftble in many plants, to take advantage of\ngood weather, and to proteft themfelves againft bad. They open and dole their\nflowers and leaves in different circumftances ; fome clofe before funfet, fome after :\nfome open to receive rain, fome dole to avoid it. The petals of many flowers ex-\npand in the fun ; but contract at night, or on the approach of rain. After the feeds\nare fecundated, the petals no longer contradt. All the trefoils may ferve as a baro-\nmeter to the hufbandman ;\nthey always contradt their leaves on an impending florm.\nSome plants follow the fun, others turn from it. Many plants, on the fun\u2019s recefs,\nvary the pofition of their leaves, which is ftyled the fleep of plants. A Angular\nplant was lately difcovered in Bengal. Its leaves are in continual motion all day\nlong : but when night approaches, they fall down from an eredt pofture to reft.\nA plant has a power of diredting its roots for procuring food. The red whortle-\nberry, a low ever-green plant, grows naturally on the tops of our higheft hills,\namong ftones and gravel. This flirub was planted in an edging to a rich border,\nunder a fruit wall. In two or three years, it over-ran the adjoining deep-laid gra-\nvel-walk ; and feemed to fly from the border, which was not congenial to its nature,\nand in which not a Angle runner appeared. An effort to come at food in a bad fltu-\nation, is extremely remarkable in the following inftance. Among the ruins of\nNewabbey, formerly amonaftery in Galloway, there grows on the top of a wall a\nplane-tree about 20 feet high. Straitened for nourifhment in that barren fituation,\nit feveral years ago diredled roots down the fide of the wall, till they reached the\n* See a particular defcription of the fenfitive plant, in the Appendix to this work.\n\u00bb ground\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 5 l\nground ten feet below ;\nand now the nourifhment it afforded to thofe roots during\nthe time of their defcending, is amply repaid, having every year fince that time\nmade vigorous fhoots. From the top of the wall to the furface of the earth, thefe\nroots have not thrown out a Tingle fibre ; but are now united in a fingle root.\nPlants, when forced from their natural pofition, are endowed with a power to\nreftore themfelves. A hop-plant, twilling round a Hick, directs its courfe from\nfouth to weft, as the fun does. Untwift it, and tie it in the oppofite direction ; it\ndies. Leave it loofe in the wrong direction, it recovers its natural direction in a fingle\nnight. Twill a branch of a tree fo as to invert its leaves, and fix it in that pofition ;\nif left in any degree loofe, it untwifts itfelf gradually, till the leaves be reftored to\ntheir natural pofition. What better can an animal do for its welfare ? A root of a\ntree meeting with a ditch in its progrefs, is laid open to the air. What follows ? It\nalters its courfe like a rational being \u2022, dips into the ground, undermines the ditch,\nrifes on the oppofite fide to its wonted diftance from the furface, and then proceeds\nin its original direction. Lay a wet fponge near a root laid open to the air; the root\nwill direct its courfe to the fponge. Change the place of the fponge ; the root varies its\ndirection. Put a pole into the ground .at a moderate diftancefrom a fcandent plant:\nthe plant diredts its courfe to the pole, lays hold of it, and rifes on it to its natural\nheight. A honeyfuckle proceeds in its courfe, till it be too long for fupporting its\nweight; and then {Lengthens itfelf by {hooting into a fpiral. If it meet with another\nplant of the fame kind, they coalefce for mutual fupport ; the one fcrewing to the\nright, the other to the left. If a honeyfuckle twig meets with a dead branch, it\nfcrews from the right to the left. The clafpers of briony fhoot into a fpiral, and lay\nhold of whatever comes in their way for fupport. If, after completing a fpiral of\nthree rounds, they meet with nothing, they then try again for further fupport, by\naltering their courfe.\nBy comparing thefe and other inflances of feeming voluntary motion in plants,\nwith that fhare of life wherewith fome of the inferior kinds of animals are endowed,\nwe can fcarce hefitate at afcribing the fuperiority to the former ; that is, putting\nfenfation out of the queftion. Mufcles, for inftance, are fixed to one place, as\nmuch as plants are ; nor have they any power of motion, befides that of opening\nand [hutting their fhells ; and in this refpedt they have no fuperiority over the mo-\ntion of the fenfitive plant ; nor doth their adtion difcover more fagacity, or even fo\nmuch, as the roots of the plane-tree, or the action of other vegetables.\nM. Buffon, who feems to be defirous of confounding the animal and vegetable\nkingdoms, denies fenfation to be any effential diftindtion. \u201c Senfation (fays he)\nmore effentially diftinguifhes animals from vegetables : but fenfation is a complex\nideaj\n\f52 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nidea, and requires fome explication. For if fenfation implied no more than mo-\ntion confequent upon a ftroke or an impulfe, the fenfitive plant enjoys this power.\nBut if, by fenfation, we mean the faculty of perceiving a'nd comparing ideas, it is\nuncertain whether brute animals are endowed with it. If it ffiould be allowed to\ndogs, elephants, &c. whole adions feem to proceed from motives fimilar to thofe by\nwhich men are aduated, it mu ft be denied to many fpecies of animals, particularly\nto thofe which appear not to poffefs the faculty of progreffive motion. If the fenfa-\ntion of an oyfter, for example, differed only in degree from that of a dog ; why do\nwe not afcribe the fame fenfaiion to vegetables, though in a degree ftill inferior ?\nThis diftindion, therefore, between the animal and vegetable, is neither fufficient-\nly general nor determined. Hence we are led to conclude, there is no a'bfoiute and\nelfential diftindion between the animal and vegetable kingdoms ;\nbut that nature\nproceeds, by imperceptible degrees, from the mod perfed to the mod impeded\nanimal, and ftom that to the vegetables ; and the frefh-water polypus may be regard-\ned as the lad of animals and the fird of plants.\u201d\nIt were to be wifhed, that philofophers would on fome occafions condder, that\na fubjed may be dark as well on account of their inability to fee, as when it really\naffords no light. This great author boldly concludes, that there is no ehential dif-\nference between a plant and an animal, becaufe we afcribe fenfation to an o> der, and\nnone to the fenfitive plant \u2022, but we ought to remember, that though we cannot\nperceive a didindion, it may neverthelefs exid. Before M. Buffon, therefore,\nhad concluded in this manner, he ought to have proved that fome vegetables were\nendowed with fenfation.\nIt is no doubt, however, as much incumbent on thofe who take the contrary fide\nof the quedion, to prove that vegetables are not endowed with fenfation, as it was\nincumbent on M. Buffon to prove that they are. But a little attention will (how\nus, that the difficulty here, proceeds entirely from our inability to fee the principle\nof fenfation. We perceive this principle in ourfelves, but no man can perceive it\nin another. Why then does every individual of mankind conclude, that his neigh-\nbour has the fame fenfations with himfelf ? It can only be from analogy. Every man\nperceives his neighbour formed in a manner fimilar to himfelf ; he ads in a fimilar\nmanner on fimilar occafions, &c. Jud fo it is with brute animals. It is no more\ndoubtful that they have fenfations, than that we have them ourfelves. If a man is\nwounded with a knife, for indance, he expreffes a fenfe of pain, and endeavours to\navoid a repetition of the injury. Wound a dog in the fame manner, he will alfo\nexprefs a fenfe of pain ; and, if you offer to drike him again, will endeavour to\nefcape,\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 53\nefcape, before he feels the droke. To conclude here, that the action of the dog pro-\nceeded from a principle different from that of the man, would be abfurd and unphi-\nlofophical to the laft degree.\nWe muff farther take notice, that there are fenfations effentially didindt from one\nanother-, and in proportion as an animal is endowed with more or fewer of thefe\ndifferent fpecies, it is more or lefs perfedt as an animal : but, as long as only one of\nthem remains, it makes not the lead approach to the vegetable kingdom ; and,\nwhen they are all taken away, is fo far from becoming a vegetable, that it is only\na mafs of dead matter. The fenfes of a perfect animal, for inftance, are live in\nnumber. Take away one of them, fuppofe fight, he becomes then a lefs perfedt\nanimal ; but is as unlike a vegetable as before. Suppofe him next deprived of hear-\ning, his refemblance to a vegetable would be as little as before; becaufe a vegeta-\nble can neither feel, tade, nor fmell ; and we fuppofe him dill to enjoy thefe three\nfenfes. Let us, ladl'y, fuppofe him endowed only with the fenfe of feeling, which,\nhowever, feems to include that of tade, and he is no more a vegetable than for-\nmerly, but only an imperfedt animal. If this fenfe is then taken away, we connedt\nhim not with the vegetable kingdom, but with what M. Buffon calls brute-matter.\nIt is to this kingdom, and not to the vegetable, that animals plainly approximate\nas they defcend. Indeed, to fuppofe an approximation between the vegetable and\nanimal kingdoms, is very abfurd ; for, at that rate, the mod imperfedt animal\nought to be the mod perfedt plant : but we obferve no fuch thing. All animals,\nfrom the highed to the lowed, are poffeffed of vegetable life ;\nand that, as far as\nwe can perceive, in an equal degree, whether the animal life is perfedt or imperfedt :\nnor doth there feem to be the fmalled connedtion between the highed degree of ve-\ngetation and the lowed degree of fenfation. Though all animals are poffeffed of\nvegetable life, thefe two feem to be as perfedtly didindt and incommenfurate to one\nanother, as any two things we can poliibly imagine.\nThe power of vegetation, for indance, is as perfedt in an onion or leek, as in a\ndog, an elephant, or a man : and yet, though you threaten a leek or an onion ever\nfo much, it pays no regard to your words, as a dog would do ; nor, though you\nwound it, does it avoid a fecond droke. It is this principle of felf-prelervation in\nanimals, which, being the mod powerful one in their nature, is generally taken,\nand with very good reafon, as the true charadteridic of animal life. This principle\nis undoubtedly a confequence of fenfation; and, as it is never obferved to take\nplace in vegetables, we have a right to fay that the foundation of it, namely, fen-\nfation, belongs not to them. There is no animal, which makes any motion in con-\nfequence of external impulfe where danger is threatened, but what puts itfelf in a\nNo. 4. P podure\n\f\u00a34 A KEY TO PHYSIC.\npoflure of defence; but no vegetable whatever does fo. A mufcle, when it is\ntouched, immediately fhuts its {hell; and, as this a ft ion puts it in a (late of de-\nfence, we conclude that it proceeded from the principle of felf-prefervation. When\nthe fenfitive plant contrafts from a touch, it is no more in a flate of defence than\nbefore ; for whatever v\/ould have deflroyed it in its expanded (late, will alfo do it\nin its contrafted flate. The motion of the fenfitive plant, proceeds only from a cer-\ntain property called irritability \u2022, and which, though our bodies pofifefs it in an\neminent degree, is a charafteriflic neither of animal nor vegetable life, but belongs\nto us in common with brute-matter. It is certain, that an electrified filk-thread\nfhows a much greater variety of motions than any fenfitive plant. If a bit of filk-\nthread is dropt on an eleftrified metal-plate, it immediately erefts itfelf ; Spreads\nout the fmall fibres like arms \u2022, and, if not detained, will fly off. If a finger is\nbrought near it, the thread feems greedily to catch at it. If a candle approaches,\nit clafps clofe to the plate as if afraid of if. Why do we not conclude that the\nthread in this cafe is really afraid of the candle ? For this plain reafon, that its\nfeeming flight is not to get away from the candle, but to get towards the eleftrified\nmetal ;\nand, if allowed to remain there, will fuffer itfelf to be burnt without offer-\ning toftir. The fenfitive plant, in like manner, after it has contrafted, will fuffer\nitfelf to be cut in pieces, without making the leafl effort to efcape. The cafe is not\nfo with the meaneft animal. An hedge-hog, when alarmed, draws its body toge-\nther, and expands its prickles, thereby putting itfelf in a poflure of defence.\nThrow it into water, and the fame principle of felf-prefervation prompts it to ex-\npand its body and fwim. A fnail, when touched, withdraws itfelf into its fhell\nbut if a little quicklime is fprinkled upon it, fo that its fhell is no longer a place of\nfafety, it is thrown into agonies, and endeavours to avail itfelf of its locomotive pow-\ner in order to efcape the danger. In mufcles and oyflers, indeed, we cannot obferve\nthis principle of felf-prefervation fo ftrongly, as nature has deprived them of the\npower of progreffive motion : but, as we obferve them conflantly to ufe the means\nwhich nature has given them for felf-prefervation, we can have no reafon to think\nthat they are deftituteof that principle upon which it is founded.\nBut there is no need of arguments drawn from the inferior creation. We our-\nfelves are pofTefTed both of the animal and vegetable life, and certainly mufl know\nwhether there is any conneftion between vegetation and fenfation or not. We are\nconfcious that we exift ; that we hear, fee, &c. but of our vegetation we are abso-\nlutely inconfcious. We feel a pleafure, for inflance, in gratifying the calls of hun-\nger and thirft ; but of the procefs by which our aliment improves our growth and\nvigour, we are altogether ignorant. If we, then, who are more perfeft than other\nvege-\n\fand occult sciences. 55\nvegetables, are utterly infenfible of our own vegetable life, why fhould we imagine\nthat the lefs perfect vegetables are fenfibleof it ?\nTo illuftrate our reafoning here by an example. The direction of the roots of the\nplane-tree mentioned above, fhows as much fagacity, if we are to look only to the\noutward aClion, as can be obferved in any motion of the mold perfect animal what-\never; neverthelefs, we have not the lead fufpicion, either that the tree faw the\nground at a diftance, or that it was informed of its being there by the reft of its roots.\nIf a wound is made in the body of a man,- and a lofs of fuhftance is to be repaired,\nthe fame fagacity will be obferved in the arrangement of the fibres, not only as if\nthey were animated, but they will difpofe of themfelves feemingly with a degree of\nwifdom far fuperior to what we have any idea of ;\nyet this is done without our hav-\ning the leaft knowledge either how it is done, or of its being done at all. We have\ntherefore in ourfelves a demonftration, that vegetable life acts without our knowing\nwhat it does : and if vegetables are ignorant of their moft fagacious actions, why\nfhould we fufpeCt that they have a fenfation, let it be ever fo obfcure, of any of their\ninferior ones, fuch as contracting from a touch, turning towards the fun, or ad-\nvancing to meet a pole ? Thus we may eafily give M. Buffon a reafon why we\nafcribe fenfation to an oyfter, and none to a vegetable; -namely, becaufe we per-\nceive the vegetable do nothing but what is alfo performed in our own bodies, with-\nout our having the leaft fenfation of it ; whereas an oyfter puts itfelf in a defend re\npofture on the approach of danger; and this being an adtion fi mi 1 i a r to our own\nupon a like occafion, we conclude that it proceeds from the fame principle of fen-\nfation. Elere it may alfo be obferved, that though the inferior animals are deficient\nin the number, they are by no means fo in the acutenefs of their fenfations ; on the\ncontrary, though a mufcle or an oyfter is probably endowed with no other fenle than\nthat of feeling, yet this lenfe is fo exquifite, that it will contract upon the flighted:\ntouch, fuch as we fhould altogether be infenfible of.\nAs to that power of contractility, or irritability, which is obferved in fome plants ;\nour folids have it, when deprived both of vegetable and animal life ; for the human\nheart, or a mufcle, cut out of an animal body, will continue to. contract, if it is\nirritated by pricking it, after it has neither fenfation nor vegetation.\nA very good moral reafon may alfo be adduced, why vegetables are not endowed\nwith fenfation. Had they been fo, we muft fuppofe them to fuffer pain when they\nare cut or deftroyed ; and if fo, what an unhappy ftate muft they be in, who have\nnot the leaft power to avoid the injuries daily offered them ? In faft, the goodnefs\nof the Deity is very confpicuous in not giving to vegetables the fame fenfations as\nto animals; and, as he hath given them no means of defence, though we had not\nbeen\n\f56 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nbeen told it by himfelf, we might have known that he gave them for food to ani-\nmals; and, in this cafe, to have endowed them with fenfation would have been\ncruelty. Though animals without number prey upon one another, yet all of them\nhave fome means of defence ; from whence we j uftly conclude, that their mutual de-\nftru&ion was not an original appointment of the Creator, but what followed from\nthe fall of Adam, and what he forefaw would happen in a courfe of time, and which\nhe therefore gave every one of them fome means of guarding againft. It may no\ndoubt be here objected, that the giving fome means of felfdefence to every animal\ncannot be reckoned a fufficient proof that it was not the original defign of the Creator\nthat they fhould be deftroyed, feeing thefe means are not always effectual for their\nprefervation. This objection, however, cannot be completely obviated without a\nfolution of the queftion concerning the origin of evil among the works of a per-\nfectly good Being. But whatever difficulty there may be in folving this queftion,\nit is certain, that, as fome means of felf-defence is given to every animal, it has\nbeen the original defign of the Creator, that in all cafes one fpecies of animals fliould\nnot be deftroyed at the pleafure or will of any other fpecies ; and, as no means of\nfelf-defence is given to any vegetable, it is plain that they have been deftined for a\nprey to every fpecies of animals that had accefs to them. Philofophers have infilled\nmuch on the neceffity of one animal\u2019s devouring another, that there might be room\nfufficient for all ; but this, fo far from being a fyftem worthy of the divine wifdom,\nfeems to be a reflection upon it, as if the Author of nature could not have found\nmeans to preferve the life of one part of his creatures, without the deftruCtion and\nmifery of the reft. The facred writings leave us at no lofs to fee how this carnivo-\nrous difpofttion came in ; and in the next world, this piece of perfection (as the\nfanguinary philofophers abovementioned would have it to be) feems to be left out\nfor there, it is faid, \u201c They (hall not hurt nor deftroy \u2022, the lion ihall eat ftraw like\nthe ox, and there ffiall be no more pain.\u201d\nOf ANIMAL FLOWERS.\nTHE grand argument for animal life in vegetables, was inferred from the curious\nconftruCtion of the frefh- water polypus, and the aftinia genus, called animal flowers,\nfea-anemone, fea-fun-flower, &c. which having indeed the external form and figure\nof vegetables, with fcarcely any progreffive motion, might eafily deceive fuperficial\nobfervers ; but, when more minutely examined, the polypus, and all the affinia\nclafs, turn out to be abfolute animals, of the viviparous kind, and feed on fiffi ;\nthe heads, or mouths of which, when open, referable a full-blown flower, whence\nthey\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 57\nthey are called flower-fifh. There is one fpecies of them, which the pured white,\ncarmine, and ultramarine, are fcarce fufficient to exprefs their brilliancy. The\nbodies of fome of them are hemifpherical, of others cylindrical, and of others fhap-\ned like a fig. Their fubftance likewife differs j fome are ftiff and gelatinous, others\nfleffiy and mufcular ; but all of them are capable of altering their figure when they\nextend their bodies and claws in fearch of food. They are found on many of the\nrocky coafts of the Weft India iftands, and on fome parts of the coaft of England.\nThey have only one opening, which is in the centre of the uppermoft part of the\nanimal ;\nround this are placed rows of flelhy claws ; this opening is the mouth of\nthe animal, and is capable of great extenfton. The animals themfelves, though\nexceedingly voracious, will bear long fading. They may be preferved alive a whole\nyear, or perhaps longer, in a vefiel of fea water, without any vifible food ; but,\nwhen food is prefented, one of them will fuccefiively devour two mufcles in their\nfhells, or even fwallow a whole crab as large as a hen\u2019s egg. In a day or two the\ncrab-fhell is voided at the mouth, perfectly cleared of all the meat. The mulcle-\nfhells are likewife difcharged whole, with the fhells joined together, but entirely\nempty, fo that not the lead particle of fifh is to be perceived on opening them. An\nanemone of one fpecies will even fwallow an individual of another fpecies ; but, af-\nter retaining it ten or twelve hours, will throw it up alive and uninjured. Through\nthis opening alfo it produces its young ones alive, already furnifhed with little\nclaws, which, as foon as they fix themfelves, they begin to extend in fearch of\nfood. One of the extremities of the fea-anemone exactly refembles the outward\nleaves of that flower ; while its limbs are not unlike the fhag or inner part of it.\nBy the other extremity it fixes itfelf, as by a fucker, to the rocks or ftones lying in\nthe fand \u2022, but it is not totally deprived of the power of progreflive motion, as it can\nfhift its fituation, though very (lowly.\nA particular fpecies of animal-flowers, called the cindered animal-flower, has\nbeen found in fome of the iflands ceded to Britain at the lad treaty of peace with\nFrance; and an account of them was publifhed in the Philofophical Tranfadtions,\n* vol. 57, by Mr. Ellis, in a letter to Lord Hillfborough. This compound animal,\nwhich is of a tender flelhy fubftance, confifts of many tubular bodies, fwelling\ngently towards the upper part, and ending like a bulb or very fmall onion ; on the\ntop of each is its mouth, furrounded by one or two rows of tentacles, or claws,\nwhich when contracted look like circles of beads. The lower part of all thefe bo-\ndies have a communication with a firm flefhy wrinkled tube, which dicks fad to\nthe rocks, and fends forth other flefhy tubes, which creep along them in various\nNo. 4.

This adhering tube, that fee ures\nthem fail to the rock, or fbelly bottom, is worthy of our notice. The knobs are\nformed into feveral parts of it by its infinuating itfelf into the inequalities of the\ncoral rock, or by grafping pieces of [hells, part of which [till remain in it, with\nthe flefhy fubftance grown over them. This fhows us the in(tin6t of nature, that\ndireCts thefe animals to preferve themfelves from the violence of the waves, not\nunlike the anchoring of mufcles, by their fine filken filaments that end in fuckers ;\nor rather like the fhelly bafis of the ferpula, or worm-fhell, the tree-oyfler, and\nthe flipper-barnacle, &c. whofe bafes conform to the fhape of whatever fubftance\nthey fix themfelves to, grafping it faft with their teftaceous claws, to withftand the\nfury of a ftorm. When we view the infide of this animal diffedted lengthwife, we\nfind a little tube leading from the mouth to the ftomach, from whence there rife\neight wrinkled fmall guts, in a circular order, with a yellowifli foft fubftance in\nthem ; thefe bend over in the form of arches towards the lower part of the bulb,\nfrom whence they may be traced downwards, to the narrow part of the upright\ntube, till they come to the flefliy adhering tube, where fome of them may be per-\nceived entering into the papilla, or the beginning of an animal of the like kind, moft\nprobably to convey it nourifhment till it is provided with claws; the remaining\npart of thefe [lender guts are continued on in the flefliy tube, without doubt for\nthe purpofe of producing and fupporting more young from the fame common parent.\nThe Abbe Dicquemarre, by many curious, though cruel, experiments, related\nin the Phil. Tranf. for 1773, ^ as ^own that thefe animals pofifefs, in a moft extra-\nordinary degree, the power of reproduction ; fo that fcarce any thing more is necef-\nfary to produce as many fea-anemones as vfe pleafe, than to cut a Angle one into as\nmany pieces. A fea-anemone being cut in two by a feClion through the body, that\npart, where the limbs and mouth are placed, ate a piece of a mufcle offered to it\nfoon after the operation, and continued to feed and grow daily for three months af-\nter. The food fometimes palled through the animal ; but was generally thrown up\nagain, confiderably changed, as in the perfect fea-anemone. In about two months, **\ntwo rows of limbs and a mouth were perceived growing out of the part where the\nincifion was made. On offering food to this new mouth, it was laid hold of and\neaten ; and the limbs continually increafing, the animal gradually became as perfeCl\nas thofe which had never been cut. In fome in#ances, however, when one of thefe\ncreatures was cut through, new limbs would be produced from the cut place, thofe\nat the mouth remaining as before \u2022, fo that a monftrous animal was the confequence,\nhaving two mouths, and feeding at both ends.\nUnder\nf\n\fAND OCCULT SCI ENCES. 59\nUnder a large hollow cliff, in the ifland of Barbadoes, in the Weft Indies, where\nthe fea flows up, and forms a bafon, there is a fixed (tone, or piece of rock in the\nmiddle, which is always under water. Round its fides, at different depths, fel-\ndoin exceeding eighteen inches, are feen, at all times of the year, iffuing out\nof little holes, certain l'ubftances that have the appearance of fine radiated flowers,\nof a pale yellow, or a bright flraw colour, (lightly tinged with green, having a cir-\ncular border of thick-fet petals, about the fize of, and much refembling, thofe of\na fingle garden-marigold, except that the whole of this feeming flower is narrower\nat the difcus, or fetting on of the leaves, than any flower of that kind. 1 have at-\ntempted to pluck one of thefe from the rock, to which they are fixed ; but never\ncould effeCt it : for as foon as my fingers came within two or three inches of it, ic\nwould immediately contract together its yellow border, and Ihrink back into the\nhole of the rock ; but if left undifturbed for about four minutes, it would come gra-\ndually in fight, expanding, though at firft very cautioufly, its feeming leaves, till\nat laft it appeared in its former bloom. However, it would again recoil, with a\nfurprifing quicknefs, when my hand came within a fmall diftance of it. Having\ntried the fame experiment by attempting to touch it with my cane, and a fmall (len-\nder rod, the effect was the fame. But, though I could not by any means contrive\nto take or pluck one of thefe animals entire, yet I cut off (with a knife which I had\nheld for a long time out of fight, near the mouth of an hole out of which one of\nthefe animals appeared) two of thefe feeming leaves. Thefe, when out of the water,\nretain their (hape and colour ; but, being compofed of a membrane -like fubftance,\nfurprifingly thin, they foon fhrivelled up, and decayed.\nThe reproductive power of the Barbadoes animal-flower is prodigious. Many\npeople coming to fee thefe ftrange creatures, and occafioning (bme inconvenience\nto a perfon through whole grounds they were obliged to pals, he refolved to deftroy\nthe objeCts of their curiofity ; and, that he might do fo effectually, caufed all the\nholes out of which they appeared, to be carefully bored and drilled with an iron in-\nItrument, fo that we cannot fuppofe but their bodies mud have been entirely crufh-\ned to a pulp : neverthelefs, they again appeared in a few weeks in ftill greater\nabundance, from the very fame places.\nThefea-carnation, or animal-flower, found in the rocks at Haftingsin Suflfex, is\nvery fimilar to the animal flower of Barbadoes. This animal adheres by its tail, or\nfucker, to the under part of the projecting rocks oppofite the town j and, when\nthe tide is out, has the appearance of a long white fig j this is the form of it when\nput into a glafs of fea- water.\nOr\n\f6o A KEY T O PHYSIC,\nOf the POLYPUS.\nI HE Polype, or Polypus, which fo long divided naturalifts in opinion, whether\nitwasof vegetable, oranimal conformation, isa frelh water in fed, of thehydra genus,\nin the clafs of worms, and order of zoophytes,\nin the Linnaean fyltem. It is of a\ncylindric figure, but variable, with very long tentacula, or claws. There is fcarce\nan animal in the world more difficult to defcribe, than this furprifing infed ; it va-\nries its whole figure at pleafure, and is frequently found befet with young in fuch a\nmanner, as to appear ramofe and divaricated j thefe young ones adhering to it in\nfuch a manner as to appear parts of its body.\nWhen fimple and in a moderate date as to contradion or dilation, it is oblong,\n{lender, pellucid, and of a pale-reddiffi colour : its body is fomewhat fmaller to-\nwards the tail, by which it affixes itfelf to fome folid body ; and larger towards the\nother extremity, where it has a large opening, called its mouth, around which are\nthe tentacula, or claws, which are eight in number, and are ufually extended to about\nhalf the length of its body. By means of thefe tentacula, or arms, as they are com-\nmonly called, expanded into a circle of more than half a foot diameter, the creature\nfeels every thing that can ferve it for food ; and, feizing the prey with one of them,\ncalls in the affiftanceof the others, if neceffary, tocondud it to its mouth.\nThe produdion of its young is different from the common courfe of nature in\nother animals ; for the young one iffues from the fide of its parent in the form of a\nfmall pimple, which, lengthening every hour, becomes, in about two days, a perfed\nanimal, and drops from off its parent to ffiift for itfelf : but, before it does this, it\nhas often another growing from its fide ; and fometimes a third from it, even before\nthe firft is feparated from its parent ; and what is very extraordinary is, that there has\nnever yet been difcovered among them any diftindion of fex, or appearance of co-\npulation ; every individual of the whole fpecies being prolific, and that as much if\nkept feparate, as if fuffered to live among others ; but what is even {till more fur-\nprifing, is the reprodudion of its feveral parts when cut off; for, when cut into a\nnumber of feparate pieces, it becomes in a day or two fo many diftind and feparate\nanimals ; each piece having the property of producing a head and tail, and the\nother organs neceffary for life, and all the animal fundions.\nThere is no diftinguiffied place in the body of the polypus, from whence the\nyoung are brought forth ; for they fpring out like (hoots or branches of a tree, from\nall the exterior parts of their bodies. M. Trembley, who had heard much of this\ncreature, and being determined to convince himfelf, by real experiments, whether\nit was a vegetable, or an animal, cut one in the middle, when, to his utter amaze-\nment,\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 6\n1\n* m t\n\u2022\n1\njfcNy\nment, he found that in two days, each of thofe pieces was become a perfeft animal,\nthe head part having (hot forth a tail, and the tail a head. Numerous trials of a\nfimilar nature have been made in my own laboratory, and I have always found that\nit is of no confequence how often you cut them, for they fill! put out new members,\nand become fomany diflindl polypes.\nThey are always to be found in clear allowly running waters, adhering by the tail\nto flicks, flones, and water-plants, and live on fmall infedls. They are eafily kept\nalive a long time in glaffes, often changing the water, keeping the glades clean,\nand feeding them with a fmall red worm, common in the mud of the Thames, or\nwith other fmall infedls. The creature has its name from the Greek many,\nand a foot, fignifying an animal with many feet \u2022, but a more appofiteone might\neafily have been invented, fince it has in reality no feet at all. What were originally\ntaken for feet, are what have fince been called its horns, and of late more properly\nits arms, their office being to catch its prey. With thefe little arms, which are\ncapable of great extenfion, it feizes minute worms, and various kinds of water in-\nfers, and brings them to its mouth-, and, like the fea-anemone, often fwallows\nbodies larger than itfelf ;\nhaving a furprifing property of extending its mouth wider,\nin proportion, than any other animal. After its food is digefled in its flomach, it\nreturns the remains of the animals upon which it feeds through its mouth again,\nhaving no other obfervable emundlory. In a few days there appear fmall knobs or\npapilla on its fides : as thefe increafe in length, little fibres are feen rifing out of\nthe circumference of their heads, as in the parent animal ; which fibres they foon\nbegin to ufe for the purpofe of procuring nourifhment, &c. When thefe are ar-\nrived at mature fize, they fend out other young ones on their fides in the fame man-\nner -,\nfo that the animal branches out into a numerous offspring, growing out of\none common parent, and united together and difpofed in the manner reprefcnted in\nthe annexed plate. Each of thefe provides nourifnment not only for itfelf, but for the\nwhole fociety ; an increafe of the bulk of one polype by its feeding, tending to an\nincreafe in the reft. Thus a polype of the freffi- water kind becomes like a plant\nbranched out, or compofed of many bodies, each of which has this fingular cha-\nradleriflic, that if one of them be cut in two in the middle, the feparated part be-\ncomes a complete animal, and foon adhering to fome fixed bafe, like the parent\nfrom which it was feparated, produces a circle of arms ; a mouth is formed in the\ncentre-, it increafes in bulk, emits a numerous progeny, and is foon, in every refpedl,\nas perfedt an animal as that from which it was fevered. The feveral flrange pro-\nperties recorded of the polypes and animal-flowers, though very furprifing, are nor,\nhowever, peculiar to them alone. The Surinam toad is well known to produce its\nNo- 5- R vouncr\n\f62 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nyoung not in the ordinary way, but in cells upon its back. And, as to the moft\namazing of their properties, the reproduction of their parts, we know the crab and\nlobfter, if a leg be broken off, can always produce a new one.\nI have annexed a copper- plate of fome excellent drawings of thefe curious phe-\nnomenons in nature, in which No. i. reprefents the frefh-water polype, with its ten-\ntacula or arms extended upwards. No. 2. reprefents the fame animal, with its young\nbranching from ir, and putting out their claws for food, which howfoever taken,\ngoes to the common fupport of the whole family. No. 3. fhews the animal-carna-\ntion-flower of the rocks near Haftings in Sufiex, with its tenticles extended in\nfearch of food. No. 4. is an exadl reprefentation of the fea-anemone, above defcrib-\ned. No. 5. fhews the head of the animal-flower of Barbadoes. No. 6. is a brilliant\ndifplay of the fea fun-flower animal, with its innumerable tenticles expanded to\ncatch its prey, which being allured to it by its elegant appearance, they clofe in-\nilantly upon ir, and convey it to the interior concavity or mouth. No. 7. reprefents\na clufter of the animal-flower defcribed by Mr. Ellis, in the iflands ceded by France,\nin which a fhews one of the animals ftretching out its tenticles in fearch of food.\nNo. 8. is a perpendicular difledfion of one of the fame animals, in order to fhew the\ngullet, inteftines, ftomach, and fibres or tendons, that move the claws.\nOf ANIMALCULES.\nTHE next raoft furpriflng part of animal nature, is that of animalcules, which\nare an innumerable tribe of living beings, that are wholly invifible to the naked eye,\nand cannot even be perceived to exift, but by the afliftance of microicopes. The\nfmallelf living creatures our inftruments can fhow, are thole that inhabit the waters ;\nfor though poflibly animalcules equally minute, or perhaps more fo, may fly in the\nair, or creep upon the earth, it isfcarce poflible to bring fuch under our examina-\ntion ; but water being tranfparent, and confining the creatures in it, we are able,\nby applying a drop of it to our glafles, to difcover, to a certain degree of fmallnefs,\nall that it contains.\u2014Some of the moft curious of thefe animalcules, which have\nbeen defcribed by microfcopical obfervers, are as follow.\n1. The Hair-like Infeft. This is fo called on account of its fhape ; being extremely\n(lender, and frequently an hundred and fifty times as long as broad. The body or\nmiddle part, which is nearly ftraight, appears, in fome, compofed of fuch rings as\nthe windpipe of land-animals, but in others, feems rather fcaled, or made up of\nrings that obliquely crofs one another. Its two ends are hooked or bent, pretty\nnearly in the fame degree, but in adireftion opposite to one another j and as no eyes\ncan\n\f\f\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 63\n-can be difcerned, it is difficult to judge which is 'the head or tail. Its progreffive\nmotion is very lingular, being performed by turning upon one end as a centre, and\ndefcribing almoft a quarter of a circle with the other ; its ffiape and form may be\nfeen in the following curious plate of animalcules, No r. Its motions are very\nflow, and require much patience and attention in the obferver. Thefe creatures\nare fo fmall, that millions of millions of them might be contained in the circle. No.\n2. When viewed fingly, they are exceedingly tranfparent, and of a beautiful green\ncolour; but when numbers of them are brought together, they become opaque,\nlofe their green colour, and grow entirely black. The hair-like infedt was fir ft\ndifcovered in a ditch at Norwich, one end of which communicates with the river\nthere, and the other end with a fecond ditch, into which feveral kennels empty\nthemfelves. The length of this ditch, v\/as at leaf!; ioo yards, and its breadth nine.\nThe bottom, for more than a foot thick, was covered with a blackifh green fub-\nftance, in appearance like mud, made up for the in oft part of thefe infedts ; but,\nfuppofing only an half or a quarter part of it to be compofed of them, according to\nthe above dimenfions, their numbers mull exceed ail imagination.\n2. Eels inpajle,\n&c. When pafte is allowed to Hand till it becomes four, it is\nthen found to be the habitation of numberlefs animalcules, which may be difcerned\nby the naked eye ; and though their form cannot be perfectly diftinguiffied, their\nmotion is very perceptible, and the whole pafte will feem to be animated. No. g.\nreprefents one of thefe anguillse magnified. The moft remarkable property of thefe\ninlefts is, that they are viviparous. If one of them is cut through near the middle,\nfeveral oval bodies, of different fizes, will be feen to iffue forth. Thefe are young\nanguillae, each of them coiled up and inclofed in its proper membrane, which is lo\nexquifitely fine, as fcarce to bedifcernible by thegreateft magnifier, while it inclo-\nfes the embryo animal. The largeft and moft forward immediately break through this\ncovering, unfold themfelves, and wriggle about in the water nimbly; others get\ncut, uncoil, and move themfelves about more (lowly; and the leaft mature continue\nentirely without motion. The uterus,\nor veffel that contains all thefe oval bodies,\nis compofed of many ringlets, not unlike the afpera arteria of land-animals, and\nfee ms to be confiderably elaftic; for as foon as the animalcule is cut in two, the\noval bodies are thruftout with fome degree of violence,- from the fpringing back or\nattion or thisjaowel. An hundred and upwards of the young ones have been feen\nto iffue from the body of one Angle eel, whereby the prodigious increafe of them\nmay be accounted for ; as probably feveral fuch numerous generations-are produced\nin a fhort time. Animalcules of a fimilar kind are likewife found in vinegar; and,\nlike thole already defcribed, are found to be viviparous. But it is not only in acid\nmatters that fuch appearances are obferved. In fome fields of wheat, many grains\nmay\n\f64 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nmay beobferved, that appear blackifh outwardly, as iffcorched ; but when opened,\nare found to contain a foft white fubftance, which, attentively confidered, appears\nto be nothing elfe than a congeries of threads or fibres lying ciofe to each other in a\nparallel direbtion, much refembling the unripe down of fome thirties on cutting\nopen the flower-heads before they begin to blow. This fibrous matter difcovers\nnot the leaft fign of life or motion, unlefs water is applied : but immediately on\nwetting, provided the grains of wheat have been newly gathered, the fuppofed\nfibres feparate, and appear to be living creatures. Their motions at firft are very-\nlanguid *\ns but gradually become more active and vigorous, twilling and wriggling\nthemfelves fomewhat in the manner of the eels in parte, but always flower and with\nlefs regularity.\n3. The Proteus, fo called on account of its affuming a great number of different\nfbapes, fo as fcarce to be known as the fame animal in its various transformations\nand indeed, unlefs it be carefully watched while parting from one fhape to another,\nit will often become fuddenly invifible. When water, wherein any fort of vegetable\nhas been infufed, or animals prefe^ved, has flood quietly for fome days, or weeks,\nin any glafs or other veffel, a (limy fubftance will be collected about the fides : fome\nof which being taken up with the point of a pen- knife, placed on a flip of glafs in a\ndrop of water, and looked at through the microfcope, will be found to harbour fe-\nveral kinds of little animals that are feldom found fwimming about at large ; among\nwhich the proteus is one. Its fhape is better underftood from the following plate, than\nfrom any defcription that could be given. Its fubftance and colour leem to refemble\nthat of a fnail ;\nand its whole fhape feems to bear a confiderable refemblance to that,\nof a fwan. It fwims to and fro with great vivacity : but will now and then flop for\na minute or two \u2022, during which time its long neck is ufually employed as far as it\ncan reach, forwards, and on every fide, with a fomewhat flow, but equable motion,\nlike that of a fnake, frequently extending thrice the length of its body, and feeming-\nly in fearch of food. There are no eyes, nor any opening in the head like a mouth,\nto be difcerned : but its abtions plainly prove it to be an animal that can fee: for\nthough multitudes of different animalcules fwim about in the fame water, and its\nown progreflive motion is very fwift, it never ftrikes againft any of them, but direbls\nits courfe between them with a dexterity wholly unaccountable, fhould we fuppofe it\ndeftitute of fight. When it is alarmed, it fuddenly draws in its neck, reprefented in the\nplate, at No. 4. and 5. transforming itfelfintothe fhape reprefented at No. 6. when it\nbecomes more opaque, and moves about very flowly, with the large end foremoft.\nWhen it has continued fome time in this pofture, it will often, inftead of the head\nand neck it had formerly, put forth a new one, with a kind of wheel-machinery,\nreprefented\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. %\nreprefented at No. 7. the motions of which draw a current of water to it from a con-\nfiderable diftance. Having often pulled in and thruft out this fhort head, fometimes\nwith and fometimes without the wheel-work, the creature, as if weary, will remain\nmotionlefs for a while \u2022, then its head and long neck will be very (lowly protruded,\nas in No. 8. and it foon refumes its former agility. Sometimes it difpofesof its neck\nand head, as reprefented in the plate, at No. 9.\n4, The Wheel-animal, or Vorticella. This wonderful animalcule is found in rain-\nwater that has ftood fome days in leaden gutters, or in hollows of lead on the tops\nofhoufesj or in the (lime or fediment left by fuch water-, and perhaps may al(o be\nfound in other places : but if the water Handing in gutters of lead, or the fediment\nleft behind it, has any thing of a red colour in it, one may be almoft certain of\nfinding them therein. Though it difcovers no figns of life except when in the wa-\nter, yet it is capable of continuing alive for many months after it is taken out of\nthe water, and kept in a ftate as dry as duft.- In this Hate it is of a globular (hape,\nexceeds not the bignefs of a grain of fand, and no figns of life appear but, being\nput into water, in the fpace of half an hour a languid motion begins, the globule\nturns itfelf about, lengthens itfelf by (low degrees, affumes the form of a lively\nmaggot, and moft commonly in a few minutes afterwards puts out its wheels ;\nfwimming vigoroufiy through the water, as if in fearch of food or elfe, fixing\nitfelf by the tail, works the wheels in fuch a manner as to bring its food to it. No.\n10, 11, 12, and 13, fhew the different appearances of its wheels ; and No. 14, and 15,\nIhew its globular form. The moft remarkable part of this animalcule is its wheel-\nwork. This confifts of a couple of femicircular inftruments, round the edges of\nwhich many little fibrillas move themfelves very brifkly, fometimes with a kind of\nrotation, and fometimes in a trembling or vibrating manner. When in this ftate,\nit fometimes unfaftens its tail, and fwims along with a great deal of fwiftnefs, feem-\ningly in purfuit of its prey. Sometimes the wheels feem to be entire circles, armed\nwith fmall teeth, like thofe of the balance-wheel of a watch, appearing projected\nforwards beyond the head, and extending Tideways fomewhat wider than its diame-\nter. The teeth or cogs of thefe wheels feem to ftand very regularly at equal diftances ;\nbut the figure of them varies according to their pofition, the degree of their protru-\nfion, and perhaps the will of the animal itfelf. All the adtions of this creature feem\nto imply fagacity and quicknefs of fenfation. At the leaft touch or motion in the\nwater, they inftantly draw in their wheels -, and their eyes feem to be lodged iome-\nwhere about the wheels becaufe, while in the maggot ftate, its motions are (low\nand blundering ; but, after the wheels are protruded, they are performed with great\nregularity, fwiftnefs, and fteadinefs.\nNo. 5. S BeTides\n\f66 A KEY TO PHYSIC.\nBefides the above, there are found in our waters feveral other fpecies of animals\nfurnifhed wich wheels, lome of which appear to have a rotatory, and others a vi-\nbratory, motion. No. 16. reprefents a kind found in the ditch at Norwich, where\nthe hair-like in led is produced. They differ from the loregoing only in having\nvery long tails. No. 17, 18, and 19, reprefent a lpecies of wheel-animals, which are\nalio covered with fhells. The body of this fpecies conlifts of three parts, in like\nmanner as the other \u2022, only the thorax and abdomen, in this, are not feparated by\nany gut, or intermediate vefifel, but arc joined immediately together. The heart is\nplainly perceived, having a regular fyftole and diaftole, at a a a, as in the former fpe-\ncies. Thefe creatures occafionally draw themielves entirely within their Ihells ; and\nthe Ihell then appears terminated by fix Ihort fpikes on one fide and two on the\nother. The young ones of this fpecies are carried in oval facculi, or integuments,\nfattened externally to the lower part of their fhells fomewhere about the tail. When\na young one is about to burft its integuments, the parent aflifts it greatly, by\nwagging its tail, and ftriking the oval bag, lo that the young one\u2019s head becomes\nas it were forced into the water, though the tail cannot be lo loon difengaged. In\nthis condition the young one fets its wheel a going, and exerts all its endeavours to\nfree itfelf from its confinement. When it has got clear, it fv\/ims away, wagging\nits tail as the old one does, and leaving the integument adhering to the fhell of the\nparent. Thefe wheel-animals are great tormentors of the water-flea, of which a\nfigure is given in the following plate \u2022, No. 20. fhows it magnified, with fome of the\nwheel-animals adhering to it. No. 21. fhows the natural fize of the flea. Thefe\ninfedts are often found in great numbers in the lame water j and when that is the\nca!e, it is not uncommon to difcover live or fix of thefe cruttaceous wheel-animals\nfattened by their tail to the fhell or horns of the flea : caufing it, feemingly, a vaft\ndeal of uneafinefs y nor can they be driven away, or fhaken off, by all the efforts the\nflea can ufefor that purpofe.\n5. The Bell-flower Animal,\nor Plumed Polype. Thefe animalcules dwell in colonies\ntogether, from ten to fifteen, (feldom falling fhort of the former number, or ex-\nceeding the latter,) in a flimy kind of mucilaginous or gelatinous cafe ; which,\nout of the water, has no determined form, appearing like a little lump of flime ;\nbut, when expanded therein, has fome refemblance to the figure of a bell with its\nmouth upwards; and is ufually about half an incn long, and a quarter of an inch in\ndiameter. Thefe bells, or colonies, are to be found adhering to the large leaves of\nduckweed, and other aquatic plants. They may be moft ealily dilcovered by let-\nting a quantity of water, with duckweed in it, ftand quietly for three or four hours\nin glafs vefiels in a window, or other place where a ftrong light comes : for then,\nif\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 67\nif any are about the duckweed, they will be found, on careful infpeClion, extending\nthemfelves out of their cafes, and making an elegant appearance. Befides the par-\nticular and feparate mot;\non which each of thefe creatu es is able to exert within its\nown cafe, and independent of the reft ^ the whole colony together has a power of\naltering the pofition of the bell, or even of removing it from one place to another\n;\nand hence this bell is fometimes found (landing perfectly upright, as in No. 22. and\nfometimes bending the upper part downwards. As thefe animalcules feem not to\nchoofe to (lay together in fociecies whofe number exceeds fifteen, when the colony\nhappens to increafe in number, the bell may be obferved to fplit gradually, begin-\nning from about the middle of the upper or anterior extremity, and proceeding\ndownwards towards the bottom, as in No. 23. till they at lad feparate entirely, and\nbecome two complete colonies independent of each other, one of which fometimes\nremoves to another part of the veflel. The arms of each individual of this colony\nare let round the head, to the number of forty, having each the figure of an Italic f,\none of whofe hooked ends is fattened to the head ; and all together, when expand-\ned, compofe a figure (haped fomewhat like a horfe\u2019s flioe, convex on one fide next\nthe body, but gradually opening and turning outwards, fo as to leave a confidera-\nble area within the outer extremities of the arms. When the arms are thus extend-\ned, the creature, by giving them a vibrating motion, can produce a current in the\nwater, which brings the animalcules, or whatever other minute bodies are within\nthe fphere of its aCtion, with great velocity to its mouth, fituated between the arms j\nwhere they are taken in if liked, or driven away by a contrary motion. Though\ntheir eyes cannot be discovered, yet they have perception of the light : for when\nkept in the dark, they always remain contracted \u2022, but on being expofed to the light\nof the fun or of a candle, they conftantly extend their arms, and (how evident figns\nof being pleafed.\n6. The Globe-animal. This animalcule, reprefented at No. 24. feems exaClly glo-\nbular, having no appearance of either head, tail, or fins. It moves in ail directions,,\nforwardsor backwards, up or down, either rolling over and overlikea bowl, (pin-\nning horizontally like a top, or gliding along fmoothly without turning itfelf at all.\nSometimes its motions ate (low, at other times very fwift ; and, when it pleafes,\nit can turn round, as it were upon an axis, very nimbly, without removing out of\nits place. The whole body is tranfparent, except where the circular black fpots\nare fhown in the figure. Some of t\nu\ne animals have no fpots, and others from one\nto feven. The furface of the whoie body appears, in fome, as if all over-dotted\nwith points -, in others, as if granulated like fhagrten : but their more general ap-\npearange is, as if befet thinly round with fhort moveable hairs or bridles, which\nprobably\n\f6 * A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nprobably are the inftruments by which the\u2019 motions are performed. Thefe ani-\nmalcules may be feen by the naked eye, but pear c.dy like moving points.\n7. The Pipe-animal, i hefe creatures are found on the coaft of Norfolk, living in\nImall tubes or cafes offandy matter, in fuch multitudes as to compofe a mafsfome-\ntimes of three feet in length. No. 25. fhows a piece or fuch a congeries broke off,\nwhere aaaa reprefent the mouths or openings of the pipes wherein the little ani-\nmals make their abode. No. 26. fhows one fingle pipe, with its inhabitant, iepa-\nrated from the reft, and magnified nine or ten times in diameter. The pipe or cafe\nh is made of fand, intermixed here and there with minute fhells, and all cemented\ntogether by a glutinous fiime, probably iffuing from the animal\u2019s own body c,\nwhich is compofed of mufcular ringlets like thofe of a worm, capable of great ex-\ntenfion or contraction. The anterior end or head, d, is exceedingly beautiful, hav-\ning round it a double row of little arms difpofed in a very regular order, and proba-\nbly capable of extenfion, in order to catch its food, and bring it to its mouth.\nSome of thefe tubes are found petrified, and conftitute one fpecies of fyringoides.\n8. An lnjeft with net-like arms. The properties and fhape of this little animal are\nvery extraordinary. It is found only in cafcades, where the water runs very fwift.\nThere thefe infeCts are found in clufters, (landing ereCt on their tails ; and refem-\nbling, when all together, the combs of bees at the time they are filled with their\naurelire. On being taken out of the water, they fpin threads, by which they hang\nexadtly in the fame manner as the garden-fpider. No. 27. (hows one of thefe infeCts\nmagnified. Its body appears curioufly turned as on a lathe; and at the tail are\nthree fharp fpines, on which it raifes itfelf, and (lands upright in the water : but,\nthe moft curious apparatus is about its head, where it is furnifhed with two inftru-\nments like fans or nets, which ferve to provide its food. Thefe it frequently fpreads\nout and draws in again \u2022, and when drawn up they are folded together with the ut-\nmoft nicety and exadtnefs, fo as to be indifcernible when brought clofe to the body.\nAt the bottom of thefe fans a couple of claws are faftened to the lower part of the\nhead, which, every time the nets are drawn in, condudl to the mouth of the ani-\nmal whatever is taken in them. Some of thefe creatures being kept with water\nin a vial, moft of them died in two days \u2022, and the reft, having fpun themfelves\ntranfparent cafes, (which were faftened either to the fides of the glafs, or to pieces\nof grafs put into it,) feemed to be changed into a kind of chryfalis. None of them\nlived above three days 5 and, though frefh water was given them two or three\ntimes a day, yet in a few hours it would (link to a degree fcarce conceivable, and\nthat too at feveral yards diftance, though in proportion to the water, all the in-\ncluded infe&s were not more than as one to one million one hundred and fifty thou-\nfand.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 69\nfand. This makes it probable, that it is neceffary for them to live in a rapid dream,\nleft they (hould be poifoned by the effluvia ifluing from their own bodies, as no\ndoubt they were in the phial.\n9. A curious aquatic worm. This animalcule is fhown, magnified, at No. 28. It\nis found in ditch-water ; and is of various fizes, from one fortieth to half an -inch in\nlength. About the head it has fomewhat of a yeilowilh colour j but all the reft of\nthe body is perfectly colourlefs and tranfparent, except the inteftines, which are con-\nfiderably opaque, and difpofed as in the figure. Along its fides are fcveral papillae,\nwith long hairs growing from them : it has two black eyes, and is very nimble. But\nthe moft remarkable thing in this creature is a long horn or probofcis \u2022, which, in\nthe large ones, may be feen with the naked eye, if the water is clear, and is fome-\ntimes one tenth of an inch in length ;\nthis it waves to and fro as it moves in the wa-\nter, or creeps up the fide of the glafs-, but it is not known whether it is hollow,\nor of what ufe it is to the creature itfelf.\n10. Spermatic Animals,\nand Animalcula Infuforia. The difcovery of living animal-\ncules in the femen of moft animals, is claimed by Mr. Lewenhoek. According to\nthis naturalift, thele animalcules are found in the male feed of every kind of animal\n;\nbut their general appearance is very much the fame, nor doth their fize differ in\n\u2022o roportion to the bulk of the animal to which they belong. The bodies of all of\nthem feem to be of an oblong oval form, with long tapering (lender tails ifluing\nfrom them \u2022, and, as by this (hape they refemble tadpoles, they have been frequent-\nly called by that name ; though the tails of them, in proportion to their bodies, are\nmuch longer than the tails of tadpoles are : and it is obfervable, that the animal-\ncules in the feed of fifties have tails much longer and more (lender than the tails of\nthofe in other animals ; infomuch, that the extremity of them is not to be difcern-\ned without the beft glaffes, and the utmoft attention. No. 29. a, \u00a3, c,\nd, reprefent\nthe fpermatic animalcula of the rabbit ; and No. 30. e,f, g, h, thofe found in the feed\nof a dog. The numbers of thefe animalcula are inconceivable. On viewing with\na microfcope the milt or feed of a male cod-fifii, innumerable multitudes of animal-\ncules are found therein, of fuch a diminutive fize, that at leaft ten thoufand of\nthem are capable of being contained in the bulk of a grain of fand ; whence it is\nconcluded, that the milt of this fingle fifh con ained more living animalcules than\nthere are to be found people living in the whole world. To find the comparative\nfize of thefe animalcules, Mr. Lewenhoek placed an hair of his head near them ;\nwhich hair, through his microfcope, appeared an inch in breadth ; and he was\niatisfied, that at leaft fixty fuch animalcules could eafily lie within that diameter 3\nwhence their bodies being fpherical, it follows, that two hundred and fixteen thou-\nNo' 5- T &nd\n\f70 AKEYTOPHYSIC,\nfand of them are but equal to a globe wbofe diameter is the breadth of a hair. He\nobferved, that when the water wherewith he had diluted the feed of a cod-filh was\nexhaled, the little bodies of the animalcules burft in pieces ; which did not happen\nto thole in the feed of a ram : and this is imputed to the greater firmnefs and con-\nfiftency of the latter, as the flefti of a land-animal is more compabl than filh. Thefe\nanimalcules appear to be very vigorous, and tenacious of life *, for they may be ob-\nferved to move long after the animal from which they are taken is dead. They have\nthis peculiarity alfo, that they are continually in motion, without the leaf: reft or in-\ntermiflion, provided there is fluid fufticient for them to fwim about in. Thefe\nanimalcula are only peculiar to the feed ; nothing that has the leaft token of life\nbeing difcoverable, by the beft glafles, either in the blood, fpittle, urine, gall, or\nchyle. Great numbers, however, are to be found in the whitifh matter that fticks\nbetween our teeth ; fome of which are of an oval figure, and others refemble eels.\nThe Animalcula Infuforia, take their name from their being found in all kinds\neither of vegetable or animal infufions. Indeed, there is fcarce any kind of water,\nunlefs impregnated with fome mineral fubftance, but what will difcover living\ncreatures. Mr. Lewenhoek fays, that at firft he could difcern no living creatures\nin rain-water ; but after Handing fome days, he difcovered innumerable animal-\ncules, many thoufands of times lefs than a grain of fand, and in proportion to a\nmite as a bee is to a horfe. In other rain-water, which had likewife flood fome\ntime, he found the fmalleft fort he had ever feen ;\nand, in a few days more, met\nwith others eight times as big as thefe, and almoft round. In another quantity of\nrain-water, that had been expofed like the former, he difcovered a kind of ani-\nmalcules with two little horns in continual motion. The fpace between the horns\nwas flat, though the body was roundifh, but tapering a little towards the end\nwhere a tail appeared, four times as long as the body, and the thicknefs of a fpi-\nder\u2019s web. He obferved feveral hundreds of thefe within the fpace a grain of fand\nwould occupy. If they happened on the leaft filament or firing, they were entan-\ngled in it; and then would extend their bodies into an oblong round, and ftruggle\nhard to difengage their tails. He obferved a fecond fort of an oval figure, and\nimagined the head to ftand at the fharpeft end. The body was flat, with feveral\nfma'll feet moving exceeding quick, but not difcernible without a great deal of at-\ntention. Sometimes they changed their fhape into a perfebl round, efpecially when\nthe water began to dry away. He met alfo with a third fort, twice as long as broad,\nand eight times fmaller than the firft : yet in thefe he difcerned little feet, whereby\nthey moved very nimbly. He perceived likewife a fourth fort, a thouland times\nfmaller than a loufe\u2019s eye, and which exceeded all the reft in brifknefs : he found\nthefe\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. yi\nthefe turning themfelves round, as it were upon a point, with the celerity of a top.\nAnd he fays, there were feveral other forts. The production of animalcula infuforia\nis very furprifing. In four hours time, an infufion of cantharides has produced\nanimalcula lefs than even the tails of thefpermatic animals we have already defcrib-\ned. Neither do they feem to be fubjeCl to the fate of other animals ; but, feveral\nkinds of them at lead, by dividing themfelves in two, to enjoy a fort of immortality.\nNor do the common methods by which other animals are dedroyed, feem to be\neffectual for dedroying their vital principle. Hot mutton-gravy, fecured in a\nphial with a cork, and afterwards fet among hot alhes to dedroy as effectually as\npofiible every living creature that could be fuppofed to exid in it, has neverthelefs\nbeen found fwarming with animalcules after (landing a few days. In the Philofo-\nphical Tranfadions, vol. lix. we have a very curious account, given us by Mr.\nEllis, of animalcules produced from an infufion of potatoes and of hempfeed.\n\u201c On the 25th of May, 1768, Fahrenheit\u2019s thermometer feventy degrees, I boil-\ned a potatoe in the New River water till it was reduced to a mealy confidence.\n1 put part of it, with an equal proportion of the boiling liquor, into a cylindri-\ncal glafs-veffel that held fomething lefs than half a wine-pint, and covered it clofe\nimmediately with a glafs cover. At the fame time, I diced an unboiled potatoe:\nand, as near as I could judge, put the fame quantity into 'a glafs-veffel of the\nfame kind \u2022, with the fame proportion of New River water not boiled ; and co-\nvered it with a glafs cover ; and placed both veffels clofe to each other. On\nthe twenty-fixth of May, twenty-four hours afterwards, I examined a (mall\ndrop of each, by the fird magnifier of Wilfon\u2019s microfcope, whofe focal didance\nis reckoned at the fiftieth part of an inch ; and, to my amazement, they\nwere both full of animalcula of a linear fhape, very didinguifhable, moving\nto and fro with great celerity ; fo that there appeared to be more particles of animal\nthan vegetable life in each drop. This experiment I have repeatedly tried, and al-\nways found it to fucceed in proportion to the heat of the circum-ambient air ;\nfo that\neven in winter, if the liquors are kept properly warm, at lead in two or three days\nthe experiment will fucceed. What I haveobferved are infinitely fmaller than fper-\nmatic animals, and of a very different fhape : the truth of which every accurate ob-\nferver will loon be convinced of, whofe curiofity may lead him to compare them ^\nand I am perfuaded he will find they are no way akin. At prefent I fhall pafs over\nmany other curious obfervations, which I have made on two years experiments, in\norder to proceed to the explaining a hint which I received lad January from M. de\nSauffure of Geneva, when he was here ;\nwhich is, that he found one kind of thefe\nanimalcula infuforia that increafe by dividing acrofs into nearly two equal parts. I\nhad\n\f, A KEY TOP II Y S I C,\nhad often feen this appearance in various fpecies a year or two ago, as I found upon\nlooking over the minutes I had taken when I made any new obfervation \u2022, but always\nfuppofed the animal, when in this hate, to be in coition. Not hearing, till after\nM. de Sau fibre left this kingdom, from what infufion he had made his obfervation,\nhis friend Dr. de la Roche of Geneva informed me the latter end of February laft,\nthat it was from hempfeed. I immediately procured h: mpfeed from different feeds-\nmen in diftant parts of the town. Some of it I put into New River water, fome in-\nto diftilled water, and fome I put into very hard pump water. The refult was,\nthat in proportion to the heat of the weather, or the warmth in which they were\nkept, there was an appearance of millions of minute animalcula in all the infufions\nand, fome time after, fome oval ones made their appearance. Thefe were much\nlarger than the firft, which ftill continued ;\nthefe wriggled to and fro in an undu-\nlatory motion, turning themfelves round very quick all the time that they moved\nforwards. Nothing more plainly fhows thefe animals to be zoophytes than this cir-\ncumftance, that when, by accident, the extremity of their bodies has been fliri vei-\nled for want of a fupply of frefh water, the applying more frefii water has given\nmotion to the part of the animal that was ftill alive-, by which means, this fhapelefs\nfigure has continued to live and fwim to and fro all the time it was fupplied with\nfrefn water.\u201d Thus we have given as full an account as our limits would admit, of\nthe moft curious kinds of animalcules that have hitherto been obferved. We can-\nnot, however, difmifs this fubjedt, without taking notice of the animalcules found\nin the feed of man.\nBefore the invention of microfcopes, the dodtrine of equivocal generation, both\nwith regard to animals and plants of fome kinds, was univerfally received : but\nthis inftrument foon convinced every intelligent perfon, that thofe plants which\nformerly were fuppofed to be produced by equivocal generation arofe from feeds\nand the animals, in like manner, from a male and female. But, as the microfcope\nthrew light upon one part of nature, it left another involved in darknefs : for the\norigin of the animalcula infuforia, or of the fpermatic animals already mentioned\nremains as much unknown, as that of many other kinds was, when the dodtrine\nof equivocal generation reigned in full force.\nThe difcovery of fpermatic animalcules was thought to throw fome light on the\nmyfterious affair of generation itfelf, and thefe minute creatures were imagined to\nbe each of them individuals of the fame fpecies with the parent. Here the infinite\nnumber of thefe animalcules was an objedtion, and the difficulty remained as great\nas befoie; for, as every one of thefe animalcules behoved to be produced from a\nmale and female, to explain their origin by animalcular generation in the fame\nmanner.\n\fn\nand occult sciences.\nmanner, was only explaining generation by itfelf. This hypothecs, therefore, ha-\nving proved unfatisfadtory, others have been invented, but which are likewife in-\nvolved in doubt. M. Buffon, however, fo far as concerns human generation, has\ngiven fuch a particular account of the animalcules in the feed of man, that we ihall\nftate it here, for the information of the curious.\n\"\nHavin'* procured the private parts of a man who died a violent death, he extrac-\nted all the feed from them while they were Hill warm: and having examined a drop\nof it with a double microfcope, it had the appearance, as in the plate, at No. 31.\nLarge filaments appeared, which in fome places fpread out into branches, and in\nothers intermingled with one another. Thefe filaments clearly appeared to be agita-\nted by an internal undulatory motion, like hollow tubes, which contained fome\nmoving fubftance. He faw diftindtly this appearance changed for that at No. 32.\nTwo of thefe filaments, which were joined longitudinally, gradually feparated from\neach other in the middle, alternately approaching and receding, like two tenfe cords\nfixed by the ends, and drawn afunder in the middle. Thefe filaments were compo-\nfed of globules that touched one another, and refembled a chaplet of beads. After\nthis, he obferved the filaments fwelled in feveral places, and perceived fmall globu-\nlar bodies ifiue from the fwelled parts, which had a vibratory motion like a pendu-\nlum. Thefe fmall bodies v\/ere attached to the filaments by fmall threads, which\ngradually lengthened as the bodies moved. At laft, the fmall bodies detached them-\nfelves entirely from the filaments, drawing after them the fmall thread, which\nlooked like a tail. When a drop of the feminal liquor was diluted, thefe fmall bodies\nmoved in all diredtions very brifkly. The feminal matter was at firft too thick, but\ngradually became more fluid ; and, in proportion as its fluidity increafed, the fila-\nments difappeared, but the fmall bodies became exceedingly numerous. Each of\nthem had a long thread or tail attached to it, from which it evidently endeavoured to\nget free. Their progreffive motion was extremely flow, during which they vibrated\nto the right and left, and at each vibration they had a rolling unfteady motion in a\nvertical diredtion.\nAt the end of two or three hours, the feminal matter becoming ftill more fluid, a\ngreater number of thefe moving bodies appeared. They were then mQre free of\nincumbrances \u2022, their tails were ihorter \u2022, their progreffive motion was more diredf,\nand their horizontal motion greatly diminiflied. In five or fix hours, the feed had\nacquired almoft all the fluidity it could acquire, without being decompofed. Moft:\nof the fmall bodies were now difengaged from their threads ; their figure was oval.\nThey moved forward with confiderable quicknefs, and, by their irregular motions\nbackward and forward, they had now more than ever the appearance of animals.\nNo. 5. U Thefe\n\f74 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nThofe that had tails adhering to them, feemed to have lefs vivacity than the others\nand of thofe that had no tails, fome altered both their figure and their fize. In twelve\n\"hours, the feed had depofited at the bottom of the vial a kind of afh-coloured ge-\nlatinous fubftance, and the fluid at top was almoh as tranfparent as water. The little\nbodies, being now entirely freed from their threads, moved with great agility, and\nfome of them turned round their centres. They alfo often changed their figures,\nfrom oval becoming round, and often breaking into fmaller ones. Their activity\nalways increafed as their fize diminiftied. In twenty-four hours, the feed had depo-\nfited a greater quantity of gelatinous matter, which, being with fome difficulty dilu-\nted in water, exhibited an appearance fomewhat refembling lace. In the clear feed it-\nfelf only a few fmall bodies were now feen moving ; next day, thefe were ftill farther\ndiminiffied ; and after this nothing was to be feen but globules, without the leait ap-\npearance of motion. All the above-mentioned appearances in the feed' of man, are\nIhown in the plate, at No. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38. No. 39 and 40 reprefent an\nappearance of the globules in another experiment, in which they arranged them-\nfelves in troops, and paffed very quickly over the field of the microfcope. In this\nexperiment they were found to proceed from a fmall quantity of gelatinous mucilage,\ndepofited by the feed.\nAn objection has however been made to the exigence of animalcules in the feed,\nor in any other part of animal bodies, from the total exclufion of air, which is found\nfo neceffary to the life of larger animals. Many inhances, however, have been ob-\nferved of large animals being found in fuch fituations as they could not poffibly have\nenjoyed the leaft benefit from the air for a great number of years ; and in this hate\nhave not only lived, but lived much longer than they would otherwife have done.\nIn Toulon harbour and the road, are found folid hard hones, and perfeffly entire,\ncontaining, in different cells, fecluded from all communication with the air, feverai\nliving ffiell-fifn, of an exquifite tafte, called DaElyli, i. e. Dates ; to come at thefe\nfifh, the hones are broken with mauls. Alfo, along the coah of Anconia, in the\nAdriatic, are hones ufually weighing about fifty pounds, and fometimes even more ^\nthe outfide rugged, and eafily broken, but the infide fo hard, as to require a hrong\narm and an iron maul to break them ; within them, and in feparate niches, are found\nfmall hiell-fifh, quite alive, and very palatable, called Solenes,\nor Cappe lunghe.\nThefe faffs are attehed by Gaffendi, Blondel, Mayol, the learned biffiop of Sultu-\nrara, and more particularly by Aldrovandi, a pnyfician of Bologna. The two lat-\nter fpeak of it as a common faff which they themfelves faw.\nIn the volume for the year S7iga of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, is the\nfollowing paffage t *\n\f\f\f75\nAND OCCULT SCIENCES.\nIn the foot of an dm, of the bignefs of a pretty corpulent man, three or four\nfeet above the root, and exa&ly in the centre, has been found a live toad, rniddle-\nfized, but lean, and filling up the whole vacant fpace : no fooner was a paftage\nopened, by fplittingthe wood, than it fcuttled away very haftily : a more firm and\nfound elm never grew ; fo that the toad cannot be fuppofed to have got into it.\nThe egg or lpawn whence it was formed, muft, by fome very fingular accident, have\nbeen lodged in the tree at its firft growth. There the creature had lived without air,\nfeeding on the fubftance of the tree, and growing only as the tree grew. This is\nattefted by Mr. Hubert, profeffbr of philofophy at Caen.\u201d\nThe volume for the year 1731 has a fimilar obfervation, exprefled in thefe words\n:\n\u2014\u201c In 1719, we gave an account of a fad, which, though improbable, was well\nattefted ; that a toad had been found living and growing in the ftem of a middling\nelm, without any way for the creature to come out or to have got in. M. Seigne,\nof Nantes, lays before the academy a fad juft of the very fame nature, except that,\ninftead of an elm, it was an oak, and larger than the elm, which ftill heightens the\nwonder. He judges, by the time requifite for the growth of the oak, that the toad\nmuft havefubfifted in it, without air, or any adventitious aliment, during eighty or\none hundred years. M. Seigne feems to have known nothing of the fad in 1719.\u201d\nWith the two foregoing may be clafled a narrative of Am'orofe Pare, chief fur-\ngeon to Plenty III. King of France, who, being a very fenfible writer, relates the\nfollowing fad, of which he was an eye-witnefs ;\n\u201c Being (fays he) at my feat, near the village ofMeudon, and over-looking a\nquarry-man whom I had fet to break fome very large and hard ftones ; in the middle\nof one we found a huge toad, full of life, and without any vifible aperture by which\nit could get there. I began to wonder how it received birth, had grown and lived j.\nbut the labourer told me, it was not the firft time he had met with a toad, and the\nlike creatures, within huge blocks of ftone, and no vifible opening or ft flu re.\u201d\nObfervations of living toads, found in very hard and entire ftones, occur in feve-\nral authors, particularly Baptift Fulgofa doge of Genoa, the farpous phyficians\nAgricola and Horftius, and lord Verulam ; others give very fpecious accounts of\nfnakes, frogs, crabs, and lobfters, being found alive, inclofed within blocks of\nmarble, rocks, and large ftones.\nAn inftance fimilar to thefe, of the truth of which we have no reafon to doubt,\nwas obferved in this country in the year 1773, where a large toad was found in the\nmiddle of a piece of coal, having not the leaft vifible crack or fiffure.\nUpon the whole, though philofophers are not yet able to difcover how thefe mi-\nnute creatures are produced; yet, that there really are animals much fmaller than\nwhat\n\f76 AKEYTOPHYSIC,\nwhat we can difcern with our naked eye, feems to be indifputable. And the fubje<ft\nevidently requires the utmofl attention of philofophers, as well as further improve-\nments in the conftruftion of microfcopes, fully to invefligate and explain it.\u2014\nMolt naturalifls fuppofe another fpecies or order of invifible animalcules, fuch as\nefcape the cognizance even of the belt microfcopes, and give many probable conjec-\ntures in relation to them. Reafon and analogy give fome fupport to the exigence of\ninfinite imperceptible animalcules. The naked eye takes in from the elephant to\nthe mite ; but there commences a new order, referved only for the microfcope,\nwhich comprehends all thefe from the mite to thofe twenty feven millions of times\nfmaller ;\nand this order cannot be yet faid to be exhaufted, if the microfcope be not\narrived at its laft and higheft perfection.\nAnimalcula are the caufe of various diforders. The itch, from feveral experi-\nments, is a diforder arifing from the irritations of a fpecies of animalcula found in\nthe puftules of that diforder; whence the communication of it by contaCt from one\nto another is eafily conceived, as alfo the reafon of the cure being effected by ex-\nternal applications. Many other cutaneous eruptions, often fuppofed to originate'\nin the blood, are nothing more than fettlements made by colonies of thefe invifible\nbeings. A fwarm of them light upon the fkin, and, finding in its pores a comforta-\nble habitation foon produce a punCture, with fcabs and irritation. But this is not\nthe worft. Obfervation has long convinced me that a variety of internal complaints\nin the flomach, pancreas, lungs, liver, and inteftines, are brought on by fwallow-\ning myriads of thefe, and other imperceptible living creatures, which inhabit raw\nvegetables, and foul water; and finding the heat and food of the flomach congenial\nto their growth, they become a new fpecies, of an alarming fize, and prey upon the\nvital parts, to the great detriment of the patient\u2019s -health, and oftentimes at the ex-\npence of his life, before the malady can be known, or even fufpeCted.\nA patient of mine, a young man near eighteen years of age, had been a confider-\nable time in a confumptive habit, and difordered in the flomach ; and notwithfland-\ning he had the advice of feveral eminent phyficians, and had taken a variety of\nmedicines, he never found the fmallefl alleviation of his pain. Upon enquiring\ninto the nature of his food for fome time before, he told me he came from a village\nnear Bridport in Dorfetfhire, which abounds with water-crefles, and on thefe he had\nfed almofl daily -for fome months previous to his coming to London. I gave him\nthree emetics fucceffively, with a view to cleanfe the flomach from all flime, phlegm,\nand undigefted food ; and immediately after the laft had operated, he took a flrong\ndofe, undiluted, of my Solar Tinfture. In lefs than ten minutes it brought up an\nanimal of the molt hideous form, which at firft appeared incapable of motion, be-\ne ing\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 77\ning overcome by the ftrength of the medicine \u2022, but on putting it into a bafon of warm\nwater it quickly recovered, and fent forth a let oftenticles or claws, which, though\ngreatly enlarged, and diverfely altered, foon convinced me it mull originally have\nbeen a fhoot from the frefh-water polypus ;\nthat on leaving the parent animal, it had\nattached itfelf to a root or leaf of the water-creffes, which this young man unfortu-\nnately fwallowed. And it appeared further, that thele tenticles or claws had been\nfo ftrongly affixed to the bowel or cotes of thefbomach, as to have defied the power\nof all common remedies to remove them. The patient happily found immediate\nrelief, and is now healthy and robuft.\n* From feveral other patients, apparently in confumptions, or afflicted with nau-\nfea, or uncommon fenfations in the ftomach and bowels, I have brought a way living\nanimals, that would terrify many people to look upon ; and which mud have come\nfrom the fpawn, or eggs, of minute animals, taken in with the food. For this rea-\nfon I would admonilh all my readers to have the utmoft care taken in the waffling\nand cleanfing of fallads, water-creffes, and all raw vegetables ; and particularly to\nguard againft the long red worm which almoft continually lies concealed in the very\nheart or centre of a head of cellary. The fame caution is neceffary in eating all kinds\nof fruit \u2022, fince nothing much more abounds with animalcules, and various living crea-\ntures. Cold raw water, particularly when ftagnant, ought never to be drunk. It\nis ever the fafeft way to boil your water, before it be ufed in the co mpofition of\nany kind of beverage, or even to drink alone.\nI might here adduce many other inftances of perfons having engendered living\ncreatures in their bowels, by fwallowing the eggs or fpawn of the parent animal. A\nyoung man, fervant to Lord Stawell, at Holt-park near Farnham, had eaten vora-\ncioufly of water-creffes. Sometime afterwards he went into a decline, and complain-\ned of a continual fenfation of pain at the pitof his ftomach, which no medicine could\nremove. His lordfhip having a value for the man, fent him to town for the advice\nof the molt able phyficians ; but ftill to no purpofe. He was in this ftate fent home\nto his friends, and given over as a loft and incurable cafe. In this ftage fome ftrong\nemetics were given him, by a country apothecary, and he threw up, to the amaze-\nment of all the country round, an incredible number of fmall tadpoles, which were\nevidently the production of fpawn attached to the water-creffes, eaten without care,\nand perhaps without walking. The patient recovered rapidly, and in lefs than a\nmonth was able to refume his former avocation.\nBut a ftill more extraordinary cafe happened in the county of Hampfhire, fo re-\ncently as the year 1792, of a girl about fourteen years of age, who found a molt un-\ncommon fenfation in her ftomach and bowels, and could plainly feel and diftin-\nNo. 6.

This\nunqueftionably muft have been taken into her ftomach in that ftate of the fpawn\nwhich is juft emerging to tadpoles, and was attributed to her eating water-creffes,\nwhich had long been a common food with her. Nothing could have faved her from\npoifon, but the C'^ature having been bred and nourifhed up as it were in her own\nbody, and had aftlmilated fo much with the nature thereof as to have thus long pro-\nved harmlefs. It is however certain, that had it not been thus timely brought\naway, fhe muft very foon have died.\nA-nimalcula are the moft common caufes of foul and rotten teeth. They attack\nthe roots below the enamel, which they perforate, andinafhort time form crufta-\ntio.ns or fcales round the teeth, as hard as ftones ; but which are nothing more than a\ncongeries or cruftaceous fhell, which thefe little animals inhabit, and are probably\nformed of the fine particles falling from the teeth during their perforations, cemen-\nted together by a glutinous fiimy matter iffuing from their own bodies, which are\ncompofed of ringlets like a worm. Hence too we difcover the true caufe of foetid\nor (linking breath ; for when thefe little eels have made their way to the marrow,\nor internal part of the tooth, the whole crown foon becomes rotten, and the marrow\nfends forth a putrid effluvia, fomewhat fimilar, but much more offenfive, than the\nanimalcula in (linking cheefe. Thefe circumftances ieem to be but little known to\nthe generality of dentiftsand operators on the teeth ; otherwife I am perfuaded their\nmode of practice would be widely different. Inftead of applying powders and den-\ntifrices calculated to deftroy thefe little worms, they prepare fuch as multiply and\nnourifh them \u2022, of which any perfon may be convinced, who will take the pains to\nmake a few fimple experiments. Let the roots of the teeth be fcraped, and the mat-\nter collected from them put into a few drops of any dentifrice or tooth-tindlure,\nparticularly of the aromatic kind. If viewed with a microfcope, it will be feen\nthat the animalcules or eels found in this matter, will move about with great cele-\nrity, as if delighted with the liquor; and in proportion as it evaporates or dries\naway, the animals appear diffatisfied, and become very uneafy.\nHappening to have a patient who had a very bad fet of teeth, he fuffered me to\nmake fome experiments upon them. I took off a few of the fcales, and emerged\nthem in a fmall quantity of fpring water. It was quickly filled with the little eels\nor animalcules ; but imparted no ill fmell. I examined the fcales with the microf-\ncope, and found them full of pores, out of which thefe invifible animals were\niffuing. I then took out as much of the foul matter from the cavities of his hollow\nteeth, as I could conveniently get at; and the moment I put it in the water, it be-\ncame foetid, and fent forth an offenfive fm.eff* Viewing it with the microfcope, the\nanimals\n\f79\nAND OCCULT SCIENCES.\nanimals appeared in the fame fhape as theformer, but quiteopaque, and the inteflinal\ncanal much fuller, and more diftended. I poured into the water a few drops of the\nSolar TinCture, and in lefs than five minutes all motion ceafed, and they weie\nquite dead. This induced me to perfuade the man to wafh his teeth and gums well\nwith the Solar TinCture. Hedidfo; and I then took off more of the icales, and\ncollected all the matter I could from the rotten teeth ; but very few living animal-\ncula could be found therein, and the foetid fmell was confiderably abated. He\ncontinued to wafh his mouth with the TinCture every other day for a week, and\nthen ufed the following preparation : Chalk finely powdered, burnt hartfhorn le-\nvigated, Florentine orris-root, and myrrh, of each two drams; fpirit of fait, fix\ndrops; the whole mixed into a fine powder. With this he rubbed his teeth every\nthird day, with a foft brufh, and in lefs than three weeks his black fet of teeth be-\ncame beautifully white ;\nhis breath fweet ; and his gums hard and firm ; and he\nhas ever fince continued them fo by the fimple means above defcribed. I am no\ndentift. What I have (fated was matter of mere accident ; but I would caution all\nmy readers againft too free a ufe of thofe numerous powders and preparations con-\ntinually recommended for .the teeth. Inflead of preferving them, they have too\noften the direCt contrary tendency, by deftroying the whole fet. The world howe-\nver is fond of tooth-powders ;\nand a moderate ufe of fomeofthem may be of fervice;\nbut the daily rubbing does more injury to the teeth, than wholly neglecting them.\nFine levigated powders may be prudently ufed once in fix or feven days, to keep the\nteeth white and fplendid. But the generality of powders prepared for this purpole are\nmuch too hard, and wear away the gums, as well as the enamel of the teeth. Yet,\nnotwithstanding the danger of thefe preparations, it is a very defirable thing to be\nenabled to preferve the beauty and foundnefs of the teeth, from infancy to old age.\nFor this purpofel would advife, that children fhould be accuftomed to wafh their\nteeth every morning with common water, and a foft tooth-brufh ; and after meals\nto rince the mouth, and rub the teeth with their fingers, where a brufh cannot con-\nveniently be ufed. Thofe who conftantly purfuethis method, may expeCt to be free\nfrom rotten teeth, putrid (lough, external difcolourations, flaccid gums, and pain\nand loofenefs of the teeth arifing from the anjmalcula which prey upon them. When\nthe teeth have been negleCted for a time, and fcales and cruftations are affixed to\nthem, thefe mould be removed by inftruments, and the teeth and gums well wafh-\nen with a powerful infinuating TinCture, to kill the animalcules ; then the teeth\nfhould be rubbed with a fine teftaceous powder, in order to remove the difcoloura-\ntion. When the enamel is become perfectly clean, white, and polifhed, even this\nfine powder fhould be ufed very fparingly, and at diftant intervals. The colour and\nfweetnefs\n\f8o A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfweetnefs are only to be preferved by frequent brufhing and wafhing. The common\ntrick of dentifts, is to give a wa(h that inftantly cleanfes and whitens the teeth, the\nfudden effects of which are apt to furprize and pleafe people ; but their confequen-\nces are very pernicious. All the acid fpirits will do this -, but they deftroy the\nenamel, and rot the teeth. The fafeft liquid to take off black, green, and yellow\ndifcolourations, is the following : Take plantane water, an ounce ;\nhoney of rofes,\ntwo drains ^\nfpirit of fait ten drops ; mix the whole together, and rub the teeth\nwell with a linen rag dipped into the mixture, everyday till they are perfectly white.\nIf the roots of the teeth are very foul, inclined to grow rotten, and furrounded\nwith fcales and cruftations, I fhould by all means recommend them to be well wafh-\ned with the Solar Tindlure, which will (lop them from further decay, entirely re-\nmove the fcurvy from the gums, and perfectly fweeten the breath.\nThe form, difpofition, and order of the teeth, are admirable-, and furnifh us with\na noble inftance of the wifdom and goodnefs of the Creator ; the foiemoft are weak\nand far from the center, as being only preparers to the reft ; the others being to\ngrind and mafticate, are accordingly ftronger, and placed near the center of motion.\nTheir peculiar hardnefs is very remarkable, confidering the tender fubftance they\nare formed of. Again, their various forms, in various creatures, are no lefs con-\nfiderable, being all curioufly adapted to the peculiar food and occafions of the\ndifferent fpecies of animals. Thus in the rapacious, they are fitted for the catching,\nholding, and tearing the prey ;\nin herbaceous, for the gathering and comminution\nof vegetables \u2022, and in fuch as have no teeth, as birds, the bill fupplies the defedl.\nAdd to this, that the temporary defedt of them is no lefs obfervable in fome : that\nchildren, for inftance, fhould have none while they are not able to ufe them, but\nto hurt themfelves, or the mother-, and that at the very age when they can take in\nthe more fubftantial food, and live without the bread, and begin to need teeth for\nthe help of fpeech, that then their teeth fhould begin to appear, and gradually\no-row, as they more and more Hand in need of them ; and that when this firft crop\nare worn out or decayed they fhould be fucceeded by a new fet, more firm and du-\nrable than the former. Nature indeed, fometimes deviates from the ordinary rule\naccording to the conftrudlion of the elementary influx then operating, as is fhewn at\nlarge in my Illuftration of the Occult Sciences ;\nwhence we have inftances of per-\nfons born with all their teeth, as Marcus Curius Dentatus ; and Cneius Papirius\nCarbo : others have only had one continued tooth, reaching the whole length of the\njaw, as Pyrrhus king of Epirus, and Prufias fon of the king of Bithynia. A\nGerman phyfician named Mentrelius, affures us that he faw an old man at Cleves,\nin 1666, aged one hundred and twenty years, who had a new fet of teeth only two\nyears\n\fSi\nand occult sciences.\nyears before, which were cut with great pain; and he alfo faw an Englifhman at\nthe Hague, who cut a new fee of teeth in his one hundred and eighteenth year.\nTo the fame purpofe Dr. Slare mentions a relation, who had all his teeth at eighty\nyears of age, and afterwards fhed them, and had a new fet all round. See Phil.\nTran. Abr. vol. v. p. 353.\nOf INSTINCT.\nINSTINCT is an occult power or difpofition of mind, by which animals are\nunerringly directed to do fpontaneoully whatever is neceffary for the prefervation\nof the individual, or the continuation of the fpecies. From this caufe, all the\nactions of brutes, or inferior animals, are faid to be directed by infkinft ; but thofe\nof man, by reafon. Philofophers, however, have greatly differed in their opinions\nconcerning this fubjeCt ; and modern authors are extremely at a lofs where to draw\nthe line. Some maintain that man is endowed with a greater number of inftinCts,\nthan any fpecies of brutes whatever. Others infift, that in human nature, there\nis not any power or propenfity at all, which can properly be called infbincftive.\nSome contend that brutes are guided wholly by an invariable inftinCt, without the\nfmalleft power of memory, or of any intellectual faculty ; whilft others infift,\nthat they poffefs a vegetative foul, directed by a certain inftinCt, capable both of\nreafon, of memory, and\u2019 of experience.\nWith refpeCt to man, nothing can be more apparent, than that as being the\nmicrocofm, or epitome of all created nature, he mult of neceflity partake of all\nits effential properties ; of which reafon and inftinft rank amongft the foremoft.\nUpon the flighted: reflection, it will be obvious to every reader, that reafon can\nnever be exercifed but from experience; confequently, until man is arrived to a\ncertain degree of maturity, he muft be directed, in molt of the propenfities of na-\nture, by mere inftinCt. Thus an infant, a few moments after its birth, is directed\nby an inftinCtive impulfe for its prefervation, to feek the bread, and to fuck it\n;\nand to the fame caufe, in the earlier ftages of life, and in all favage uneducated\ncountries, are to be attributed the firft fenfations, or defires of copulation, not\nfrom the pleafures of enjoyment, for they are then unknown ; but from an impul-\nfive inftinCt, for the propagation of the fpecies. It has been infifted, that the\nfirft commerce of the fexes amongft human beings is directed by reafon ; and the\narguments affigned for it are thefe ; that as foon as the organs of generation, ia\neither fex, become fufficiently ripe for the purpofe intended by nature, they fym-\npathize with the fenfes, and are affeCted with vibrations in the nerves, which rife\ninto pleafure above the power of controul, and are heightened by youth, health,\n\u2022\nNo. 6. y grateful\n\fgrateful aliment, imagination, ambition, fympathy, and various other involuntary\nfenfations \u2022, which, under fuch circumftances, pervade the whole fyftem. And\nas thefe organs are endued with a greater degree of fenfibility than the other parts,\nboth from their make, and the peculiar ftrudure and difpofition of their nerves \u2022,\nfrom the great diftenfion of the mufcular fyftem and feed vefiels in males ; as well\nas from the extenfion of the clitoris and finufes of the uterus in females, which\nnever fail to take place about the time of puberty, the genital organs in both fexes\nbecome fo extremely irritable, that reafon being thereby awakened,\ndirects and impels\nto that ad, by which alone the human fpecies can poffibly be continued, and the\nworks of an Omnipotent Creator carried on and conducted to the ends intended.\nIn the above ftatement, I am perfuaded every rational mind will agree, that the\nword infiindl ought to have been fubftituted v\/here that of reafon is ufed ; becaufe in\ncivilized focieties we are taught by reafon to overcome thofe inftindive paflions, in-\nftead of having our reafon awakened by them ; but we too often find that thefe in-\nftindive pafiions are proof againft both reafon and refolution, even in the moft\nvirtuous families, in all countries, and in the bell; regulated focieties. What fhall\nwe fay then of that part of the human race which yet remains in a ftate of nature,\nuncultivated, and unenlightened, by any precepts of morality or fcience ? They\nare fubjed to the primary command, \u201c encreafe and multiply and they obey it.\nA couple of young favages go together for the firjl time, without any view to\noffspring, without any knowledge of the pleafure to be derived from it, and with-\nout any determinate idea at all ; and, as we fee thefe means invariably purfued by\nall animals, as well rational as irrational, without experience, and without inftruc-\ntion, we muft refer the mutual defire of the fexes to a much higher principle than\ncan poffibly arife from human motives ; and that principle can be nothing but in-\nftind, But as I fhall have occafion to fpeak more at large on this fubjed under\nthe article lovet\nwhen I come to treat of the affedions and paffions of the mind,\nand of the nature and perfedions of Man, I fhall in the interim proceed to fhew,\nthat the inferior animals are diredecl by inftind to performances of the moft fur-\nprifing kind, and are, within certain limits, endued with memory, and a reafon-\ning intelled.\nThe moft remarkable inftance of the power of inftind is obferved in the con-\nftrudion of an honey-comb. Bees, it is well known, conftrud their combs with\nfmail cells on both Tides, fit both for holding their ftore of honey, and for rearing\ntheir young. There are only three poftible figures of the cells, which can make\nthem all equal and fimilar, without any ufdefs interfaces. Thefe are the equila-\nteral triangle, the fquare, and the regular hexagon. Of the three, the hexagon is the\n\fAND OCCULT S CIENCES. *3\nmod proper, both for convenience and ftrength, Bees, as if they knew this,\nmake their cells regular hexagons. As the'combs have cells on both fides, the\ncells may either be exactly oppofite, having partition againft partition, or the\nbottom of a cell may reft upon the partitions between the ceils on the other fide,\nwhich will ferve as a buttrefs to ftrengthen it. The laft way is the beft for ftrength ;\naccordingly the bottom of each cell refts againft the point where three partitions\nmeet on the other fide, which gives it all the ftrength poftible. The bottom of a\ncell may either be one plane, perpendicular to the fide partitions ; or it may be\ncompofed of feveral planes, meeting in a folid angle in the middle point. It is\nonly in one of thefe two ways that all the cells can be fimilar without lofing room.\nAnd for the fame intention, the planes, of which the bottom is compofed, if there\nbe more than one, muft be three in number, and neither more nor fewer. It has\nbeen demonftrated, that by making the bottoms of the cells to conflft of three\nplanes meeting in a point, there is a faving of material and labour no way inconfi-\nderable. The bees, as if acquainted with thefe principles of folid geometry, fol-\nlow them moft accurately j the bottom of each cell being compofed of three planes,\nwhich make obtule angles with the fide partitions and with one another, and meet\nin a point in the middle of the bottom ; the three angles of this bottom being fup-\nported by three partitions on the other fide of the comb, and the point of it by the\ncommon interfedtion of thefe three partitions. One inftance more of the mathema-\ntical fkill difplayed in the ftrudture of a honey-comb deferves to be mentioned. It\nis a curious mathematical problem, at what precife angle the three planes which\ncompofe the bottom of a cell ought to meet, in order to make the greateft poftible\nfaving of material and labour. This is one of thofe problems belonging to the\nhigher parts of the mathematics, which are called problems of maxima and minima.\nThe celebrated M\u2019Laurin refolved it by a fluxionary calculation, which is to be\nfound in the Tranfadtions of the Royal Society of London, and determined pre-\ncifely the angle required. Upon the moft exadt menfuration which the fubjedt\ncould admit, he afterwards found, that it is the very angle in which the three\nplanes in the bottom of the cell of a honey-comb do adtually meet. If a honey-\ncomb were a work of human art, every man of common fenfe would conclude,\nwithout hefitation, that he who invented the conftrudtion muft have underftood\nthe principles on which it was conftrudted. We need not fay that bees know none\nof thefe things. They work moft geometrically without any knowledge of geome-\ntry *, fomewhat like a child, who by turning the handle of an organ makes good\nmufic without any knowledge of mufic. The art is not in the child, but in him\nwho made the organ. In like manner, when a bee makes its combs fo geometri-\ncally.\n\fSi A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ncally, the geometry is not in the bee, but in that Great Geometrician who made\nthe bee, and made all things in number, weight, and meafure. This places, in a\nmolt ftriking point of view, the difference betwixt inftindt and reafbn. There are\nno improvements made by man, but what we fee carried ftill further by fucceeding\ngenerations ; but in bees, and in all inferior animals, we fee precifely the fame eco-\nnomy and contrivance now, in conftrudting their cells, building their nefts, lay-\ning up provifions, &c. as at the beginning-, and that in all ages, and in all gene-\nrations, they have neither improved, nor departed from, that fixed fyftem aftign-\ned to them by nature, for their prefervation and guide ; whereas men, adting by\nreafon and fcience, improve from the labours and inventions of each other. Were\nvve to attribute reafon inftead of inftindt, to bees, in the conftrudtion of their combs,\n-\nwe fhould at the fame time admit them to be rational creatures, endued with think-\ning and reafoning faculties, far fuperior to men ; for the principle upon which the\nhoney-comb is conftruded, is founded on thofe high departments of the mathema-\ntics, which were altogether unknown to the human race till the beginning of the\nprefent century, and which at this moment are beyond the comprehenfion of nine-\ntenths of mankind in the moft enlightened nations on earth. Hence it is plain that\nthe contrivance is not in the bees, but in the Creator of the bees, whodiredts them,\nand all brute creatures, to adt by an inftindt for their own immediate benefit; with-\nout knowing the principles upon which they adt. And this is by no means contrary\nto reafon ; for we daily fee men, working under the diredtion of others of fuperior\nunderftanding, to effedt purpofes, and accomplifh ends, without having themfelves\nany idea of either and if we look through the endlefs variety of human avocations,\nwe fhall find that the greater part of mankind feem deftined by God and nature\nto be governed in this way. But to proceed\u2014\nCaterpillars, when fhaken off a tree in every diredtion, inftantly turn round\ntowards the trunk, and climb up, though they had never formerly been on the fur-\nface of the ground. This is a ftriking inftance of inftindt. On the tree, and not\nupon the ground, the caterpillar finds its food. If therefore it did not turn and\nclimb up the trunk, it would inevitably perifh. The folitary wafp digs holes in\nthe fands, in each of which fhe depofits an egg: fhe colledts a few fmall green\nworms, which fhe rolls up in a circular form, and fixes in the hole in fuch a man-\nner that they cannot move. When the wafp-worm is hatched, it is amply ftored\nwith the food which nature has deftined for its fupport. The green worms are de-\nvoured in fucceflion ; and the number depofited is exadtly proportioned to the time\nneceffary for the growth and transformation of the wafp-worm into a fly i then it\nifiues from the hole, and is capable of procuring its own nourifhment. This in-\nftindt\n\fandoccultsciences, g5\nftindl of the parent-wafp is the more remarkable, that fhe feeds not upon flefh her-\nfelf. Birds of the fame fpecies, unlefs when reftrained by peculiar circumftances,\nuniformly build their nefts of the fame materials, and in the fame form and fitua-\ntion, though they inhabit very different climates ; and the form and fituation arc\nalways exadtly fuited to their nature, and calculated to afford them fhelter and pro-\ntection. When danger, or any other circumftance peculiar to certain countries,\nrenders a deviation from the common form or fituation of nefts neceffary, that de-\nviation is made in an equal degree, and in the very lame manner, by all the birds\nof one fpecies; and it is never found to extend beyond the limits of the country\nwhere alone it can ferve any good purpofe. When removed by neceffity from their\neggs, birds return to them with hafte and anxiety, and fhift them fo as to heat\nthem equally ; and it is worthy of obfervation, that their hafte to return is always\nin proportion to the cold of the climate. Thus the oftrich in Senegal, where the\nheat is exceftive, negledts her eggs during the day, but fits upon them in the night.\nAt the Cape of Good Hope, however, where the degree of heat is lefs, the oftrich,\nlike other birds, fits upon her eggs both day and night. In countries infefted with\nmonkeys, many birds, which in other climates build in bufhes and clefts of trees,\nfufpend their nefts upon (lender twigs, and thus elude the rapacity of their enemies.\nThe following is remarkable. A cat frequented a clofet, the door of which was\nfattened by an iron latch. A window was fituated near the door. When the door\nwas fhut, the cat gave herfelf no uneafinefs. As foon as fhe was tired of her con-\nfinement, fhe mounted on the lole of the window, and with her paw dexteroufty\nlifted the latch, and came out. This practice, which we are told continued for\nyears, muft have been the confequence of reafoning in particular ideas. It could\nnot be the effedt of inftindt ; for inftindt is adapted only to a ftate of nature, in\nwhich cats have neither latches to lift nor doors to open ; and as it is not laid that\nthe animal attempted to lift the latches of other doors, we are not authorifed to\ninfer that this particular adtion was the confequence of reafoning in ideas enlarged\nby abftradtion : the cat had repeatedly feen one door opened by an exertion which\nfhe was capable of imitating. It is well known that crows feed upon feveral kinds\nof fhell-fifii when within their reach \u2022, and that they contrive to break the fhell by\nraifing thefifh to a great height, and letting it drop upon a ftone or a rock. This may\nperhaps be confidered as pure inftindt diredting the animal to the proper means of\nacquiring its food. But what is to be thought cf the following fadt, communi-\ncated by a gentleman whofe veracity is unqueftioned, and who, being totally un-\nacquainted with the theories of philofophers, has of courfe no favourite hypothecs\nto fupport ? In the fpring of the year 1791, a pair of crows made their neft in a\ntree, of which there are feveral planted round his garden ; and in his morning- walks\nNo. 6.

The crows continued for a fhort time to make a threatening\nnolle $ but perceiving that on the ground they could do nothing more than threaten,\none of them lifted a (lone from the middle of the garden, and perched with it on a\ntree planted in the hedge, where (he fat watching the motions of the enemy of her\nyoung. As the cat crept along under the hedge, the crow accompanied her by\nflying from branch to branch, and from tree to tree ; and when at laft puts ven-\ntured to quit her hiding-place, the crow, leaving the trees and hovering over her\nin the air, let the ftone drop from on high on her back. That the crow on this\noccafion reafoned, is felf -evident $ and it feems to be little lefs evident, that the\nideas employed in her reafoning were enlarged beyond thofe which Ihe had received\nfrom her fenfes. By her fenfes fhe may have perceived, that the fhell of a filh is\nbroken by a fall j but could her fenfes inform her, that a cat would be wounded or\ndriven off the field by the fall of a ftone ? No; from the effedt of the one fall pre-\nferved in her memory, fhe rnuft have inferred the other by her power of reafoning.\nAs to the natural afifedtion of brutes, fays an ingenious writer, \u201c the more I re-\nfledt on it, the more I am aftonilhed at its efte&s.\u201d It feems to awaken the pafilons,\nquicken the invention, and fharpen the fagacity of the brute creation. Thus an\nhen, juft become a mother, is no longer that placid bird fhe ufed to be, but with\nfeathers ftanding on end, wings hovering, and clocking note, fhe flies at every\nthing which feems to threaten her brood. Dams will throw themfelves in the way\nof the greateft danger in order to avert it from their progeny. Thus a partridge\nwill tumble along before a fportfman, in order to draw away the dogs from her\nhelplefs covey. In the time of nidification the moft feeble birds will aflault the\nmod rapacious.

Unlike the generality of birds, they do not pair. When\na female appears on the wing, fhe is often attended by two or three males, who\nfeem\n\fAND O.C CULT SCIENCES. 87\nfeeirj to be earneftly contending for her favours. From the time of her appearance\ntill after the middle of fummer, the nefts of the birds felefted to receive her egg are\nto be found in great abundance ; but, like the other migrating birds, fhe does not\nbegin to lay till fome weeks after her arrival. It is on all hands allowed, that the\ncuckow does not hatch its own eggs. The hedge-fparrow, the water- wagtail, the\ntitlark, the red-bread, the yellow-hammer, the green-linnet, or the winchat, is\ngenerally the nurfe of the young cuckow. It may be ftippofed, that the female\ncuckow lays her egg in the abfence of the bird in whole neft Ihe intends to depofit 5\nas it has been known, that on fight of one of thefe, a red-bread and its mate jointly\nattacked her on approaching the neft, putting her to flight j and fo effectually drove\nher away, that fhe did not dare to return. Among the birds above-mentioned, it\ngenerally felefts the three firft, but fhews a much greater partially to the hedge-\nfparrow. This iaft commonly takes up four or five days in laying her eggs. Dur-\ning this time (generally after fhe has laid one or two) the cuckow contrives to de-\npofit her egg among the reft, leaving the future care of it entirely to the hedge-\nfparrow. When the hedge-fparrow has fat her ufual time, and difengaged the\nyoung cuckow and fome of her own offspring from the fhell, her own young ones,\nand any of her eggs that remain unhatched, are foon turned out, the young cuc-\nkow remaining poffeffor of the neft, and foie objedt of her future care. The\nyoung birds are not previoufly killed, nor are the eggs demolifhed j but all are\nleft to perifh together, either entangled about the bufh which contains the neft, or\nlying on the ground under it. The early fate of the young hedge-fparrow s, (fays\nMr. Jenner, who made thefe experiments) is a circumftance that has been noticed\nby others, but attributed to wrong caufesj but the true caufe we fhall prefently\nexplain. A variety of conje&ures have been formed upon it. A cuckow laid\nher egg in a water-wagtail\u2019s neft in the thatch of an old cottage. T he wagtail fat\nher ufual time, and then hatched all the eggs but one ; which, with all the young\nones except the cuckow, was turned out of the neft. The young birds, confifting\nof five, were found upon the rafter that projected from under the thatch, and with\nthem was an egg not in the leaft injured. The cuckow was reared by the wagtails\ntill it was nearly capable of flying, when it was killed by an accident.\nAn hedge-fparrow built her neft in a hawthorn bufh in a timber-yard. After fhe\nhad laid two eggs, a cuckow dropped in a third. The fparrow continued laying\nas if nothing had happened, till fhe had laid five, her ufual number, and then fat.\nOn infpeefting the neft, June 20, 1786, (fays Mr. Jenner,) I found that the bird\nhad hatched this morning, and that every thing but the young cuckow was thrown\nout. Under the neft I found one of the young hedge-fparrows dead, and one egg\nby the fide of the neft entangled with the coarfe woody materials that formed its out-\n, fide\n\f88 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfide covering. On examining the egg, I found one end of the fhell a little crack-\ned, and could fee that the fparrow it contained was yet alive. It was then reftored.\nto the neft, but in a few minutes was thrown out. The egg being again fufpended\nby the outfide of the neft, was faved a fecond time from breaking. To fee what\nwould happen if the cuckow was removed, I took out the cuckow, and placed the\negg containing the hedge-fparrow in the neft in its ftead. The old birds, during\nthis time, flew about the fpot, fhewing figns of great anxiety j but when I with-\ndrew, they quickly came to the neft again. On looking into it in a quarter of an\nhour afterwards, I found the young one completely hatched, warm, and lively.\nThe hedge-fparrows were fuffered to remain undifturbed with their new charge for\nthree hours (during which time they paid every attention to it), when the cuckow\nwas again put into the neft \u2022, and on examining it again in a few minutes, I found\nthe young fparrow was tumbled out. It was a fecond time reftored, but again ex-\nperienced the fame fate. From thefe experiments, and fuppofing, from the feeble\nappearance of the young cuckow juft difengaged from the fhell, that it was utterly\nincapable of difplacing either the egg or the young fparrows, I was induced to be-\nlieve that the old fparrows were the only agents in this feeming unnatural bufinefs.\nBut I afterwards clearly perceived the caufe of this ftrange phenomenon, by difco-\nvering the young cuckow in the aft of difplacing its fellow-neftlings, as the follow-\ning relation will fully evince. June 18, 1787, I examined the neft of a hedge-fpar-\nrow, which then contained a cuckow\u2019s and three hedge-fparrow \u2019s eggs. On in-\nfpedting it the day following, I found the bird had hatched, but that the neft now\ncontained only a young cuckow and one young hedge-fparrow. The neft was\nplaced fo near the extremity of a hedge, that I could diftinflly fee what was going\nforward in it \u2022, and, to my aftonifhment, faw the young cuckow, though fo newly\nhatched, in the aft of turning out the young hedge-fparrow. The mode of accom-\nplifhing this was very curious. -The little animal, with the afliftance of its rump\nand wings, contrived to get the bird upon its back ; and making a lodgement for\nthe burden by elevating its elbows, clambered backward with it up the fide of the\nneft, till it reached the top where refting for a moment, it threw off its load with\na jerk, and quite difengaged it from the neft. It remained in this fituation a fhort\ntime, feeling about with the extremities of its wings, as if to be convinced whe-\nther the bufinefs was properly executed, and then dropped into the neft again.\nWith thefe (the extremities of its wings) I have often feen it examine, as it were,\nan egg and neftling before it began its operations ; and the nice fenfibility which\nthefe parts appeared to poffefs, feemed fufficiently to compenfate the want of fight,\nwhich as yet it was deftitute of. I afterwards put in an egg 5 and this, by a fimi-\nlar procefs, was conveyed to the edge of the neft and thrown out. Thefe experi-\nments\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 89\nmerits I have fince repeated feveral times in different nefts, and have always found\nthe young cuckow difpofed to a<5t in the fame manner. In climbing up the neft,\nit fometimes drops its burden, and thus is foiled in its endeavours ; but, after a\nlittle refpite, the work is refumed, and goes on almoft inceffantly till it is effe&ed.\nIt is wonderful to fee the extraordinary exertions of the young cuckow, when it is\ntwo or three days old, if a bird be put into the neft with it that is too weighty for\nit to lift out. In this ftate it feems ever reftlefs and uneafy. The Angularity of\nits fhape is well adapted to thefe purpofes \u2022, for, different from other newly-hatch-\ned birds, its back, from the fcapulas downward, is very broad, with a confider-\nable depreffion in the middle. This depreffion feems formed by nature for the de-\nfign of giving a more fecure lodgement to the egg of the hedge-fparrow, or its\nyoung one, when the young cuckow is employed in removing either of them from\nthe neft. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and\nthen the back affumes the fhape of neftling birds in general. It appears a little\nextraordinary,, that two cuckows eggs Ihould ever be depofited in the fame neft,\nas the young one produced from one of them muft inevitably perifti ;\nyet two in-\nftances of this kind fell under our author\u2019s obfervation, one of which he thus\nrelates: Two cuckows and a hedge-fparrow were hatched in the fame neft this\nmorning, (June 27, 1787;) one hedge-fparrow\u2019s egg remained unhatched. In a\nfew hours after, a conteft began between the cuckows for the poffefiion of the\nneft, which continued undetermined till the next afternoon, when one of them,\nwhich was fomewhat fuperior in fize, turned out the other, together with the\nyoung hedge-fparrow and the unhatched egg. This conteft was very remark-\nable. The combatants alternately appeared to have the advantage, as each car-\nried the other feveral times nearly to the top of the neft, and then funk down again,\noppreffed by the weight of its burden ; till at length, after various efforts, the\nftrongeft prevailed, and was afterwards brought up by the hedge-fparrows. But\nthe principal circumftance that has agitated the mind of the naturalift refpedling\nthe cuckow is, why, like other birds, it fhould not build a neft, incubate its\neggs, and rear its own young ? The moft probable fuggeftion is, the fhort refi-\ndence this bird is allowed to make in the country where it is deftined to propagate\nits fpecies; and the call that nature has upon it, during that refidence, to produce\na numerous progeny. The cuckow\u2019s firft appearance here is about the middle of\nApril, commonly on the 17th. Its egg is not ready for incubation till fome weeks\nafter its arrival, feldom before the middle of May. A fortnight is taken up by\nthe fitting-bird in hatching the egg. The young bird generally continues three\nweeks in the neft before it flies, and the fofter-parents feed it more than five weeks\nafter this period ; fo that if a cuckow fhould be ready with an egg much fooner\nNo. 6. A a than\n\/\n\f90 A KEY TO PHYSIC*\nthan the time pointed out, not a fingle neflling, even one of the earlieft, would\nbe fit to provide for itfelf before its parent would be inftindlively directed to feek\na new refidence, and be thus compelled to abandon its young one; for old cuc-\nkows take their final leave of this country the firfb week in July. Among the\nmany peculiarities of the young cuckow, there is one that (hews itfelf very early.\nLong before it leaves the neft, it frequently, when irritated, afiumes the manner\nof a bird of prey, looks ferocious, throws itfelf back, and pecks at any thing pre-\nfented to it, with great vehemence, often at the fame time making a chuckling noife\nlike a young hawk. Hence probably the vulgar opinion, that this bird changes\ninto a hawk and devours its nurfe on quitting its neft ; whence the French pro-\nverb, Ingrat comine un coucou. Sometimes, when difturbed in a fmaller degree, it\nmakes a kind of hiffing noife, accompanied with a heaving motion of the whole\nbody. From what has been faid, it becomes evident, that the fame inftinclive\nimpulfe which directs the cuckow to depofit her eggs in the nefts of other birds,\ndirefts her young one to throw out the eggs and young of the owner of the neft.\nThe fcheme of nature would be incomplete without it ; for it would be extremely\ndifficult, if not impoffible, for the little birds deftined to find fuccour for the\ncuckow, to find it alfo for their own young ones after a certain period ; nor would\nthere be room for them to inhabit the neft. Cuckows may be, and often are,\nbrought up tame, fo as to become familiar. They will eat in this ftate bread and\nmilk, fruits, infedts, eggs, and fleffi, either cooked or raw; but in a ftate of\nnature, they chiefly live on caterpillars. When fat, they are faid to be as good\neating as a land-rail : the French and Italians eat them to this day. The ancient\nRomans admired them greatly as food : Pliny fays that there is no bird which can\nbe compared to them for delicacy. In migrating, the major part of thefe birds are\nfuppofed to go into Africa, fince they are obferved to vifit the ifland of Malta twice\nin a year, in their paflfage backwards and forwards, as is fuppofed, to that part of\nthe world.\n1 he inftindt which has been difcovered in ants, beavers, &c. is too well known\nand admired, to need any mention in this place ; and we fee in a great variety of\nbirds, infedts, and quadrupeds, a fimilar economy in laying up {lores of provifion\nin time of plenty, that they might have accefs to it in time of need; The common\ndaw has a peculiar knack of this fort ; and in houfes where they have been brought\nup tame, have frequently been known to hide with their meat, money, rings,\nfeals, lockets, and other fmall trinkets, thereby occafioning injurious fufpicions\nof theft in fervants or others, who are perfectly innocent.\nWe have a remarkable anecdote given by the Rev. Mr. Robinfon, of Oufby in\nWeftmoreland, relative to an inftindl in the crow, by which they are made the na-\nSL.S \u201cBxe CwkoO tUraI\nft uiot\\\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 9 *\ntural planters of all forts of wood and trees. They difleminate the kernels upon the\nearth, which like nurferies bring them forth till they grow up to their natural\nftrength and perfection. He fays, \u201c About twenty-five years ago, coming from\nRofecaftle early in the morning, I obferved a great number of crows very bufy at\ntheir work upon a declining ground of a mofTy furface \u2022, I went out of my way on\npurpofe to view their labour, and I found they were planting a grove of oaks.\nThe manner of their planting was thus : they firft made little holes in the earth\nwith their bills, going about and about till the hole was deep enough \u2022, and then\nthey dropped in the acorn, and covered it with earth and mofs. The feafon was\nat the latter end of autumn, when all feeds are full ripe.\u201d Mr. Robinfon feems to\nthink that Providence had given the crows this inftinft folely for the propagation\nof trees \u2022, but I imagine it was given them principally for their own prefervation,\nby hiding proviiion in time of plenty, in order to fupply them in a time of fcarcity \u2022,\nfothat fuch an inftind in thefe birds may anfwer a double purpofe j\nboth their own\nfupport in times of need, and the propagation of the trees they plant : for when-\never they hide a great number of nuts or grains in the earth, we cannot fuppofe\nthey find them all again \u2022, but that as many will remain in the plot of ground they\nmake ufe of, as can well grow by one another.\nA wonderful fpirit of fociality in the brute creation, independent of fexual attach-\nment, has been frequently remarked. Many horfes, though quiet with company,\nwill not ftay one minute in a field by themfelves: the ftrongeft fences cannot reftrain\nthem. A horfe has been known to leap out at a liable window through which dung\nwas thrown, after company \u2022, and yet in other refpeCts to be remarkably quiet. Oxen\nand cows will not fatten by themfelves ; but will negleCl the fineft pafture that is\nnot recommended by fociecy. It would beneedlefs to inftance in fheep, which con-\nftantly flock together. But this propenfity feems not to be confined to animals of\nthe fame clafs or fpecies. Even great difparity of kind and fize does not always pre-\nvent focial advances and mutual fellowfhip. Of this the following remarkable in-\nfiance is given. A gentleman who kept but one horfe, happened alfo on a time to\nhave but one folitary hen. Thefe two incongruous animals fpent much of their\ntime together in a lonely orchard, where they faw no creature hut each other. By\ndegrees an apparent regard began to take place between thefe two fequefiered indi-\nviduals. The fowl would approach the quadruped with notes of complacency, rub-\nbing herfelf gently againft his legs \u2022, while the horfe would look down with fatisfac-\ntion, and move with the greateft caution and circumfpedtion, lefi he fhould trample\non his diminutive companion ; and thus by mutual good offices each teemed to con-\nfole the vacant hours of the other.\nIn\n\f$2 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nIn the Gentleman\u2019s Magazine for March 1788, we have the following anecdotes 0 1\na. raven. The raven alluded to \u201c lives, or did live three years fince, at the red\nlion at Hungerford i his name, I think, is Rafe. You muft know then, that\ncorning into that inn, my chaife run over and bruifed the leg of my Newfound-\nland dog j and while we were examining the injury done to the dog\u2019s foot, Rafe\nwas evidently a concerned fpeftator; for the minute the dog was tied up under\nthe manger with rny horfe, Rafe not only vifited, but fetched him bones, and\nattended upon him with particular and repeated marks of kindnefs. The bird\u2019s\nnotice of the dog was fo marked, that I obferved it to the hofller ; for I had not\nheard a word before of the hiftory of this benevolent creature. John then told me,\nthat he had been bred from his pin-feather in intimacy with a dog \u2022, that the affec-\ntion between them was mutual; and that all the neighbourhood had often been\nwitneffe.s of the innumerable a6ts of kindnefs they had conferred upon each other.\nRafe\u2019s poor dog, after a while, unfortunately broke his leg ; and during the\nlong time he was confined, Rafe waited upon him conflantly, carried him his\nprovifions daily, and never fcarcely left him alone! One night by accident the\nhoftler had fhut the liable door, and Rafe was deprived of the company of his\nfriend the whole night ; but the hoftler found in the morning the bottom of the\ndoor fo pecked away, that had it not been opened, Rafe would in another hour\nhave made his own entrance-port. I then enquired of my landlady (a fenfible\nwoman), and heard what I have related confirmed by her, with feveral other Angu-\nlar traits of the kindnefies this bird Ihews to all dogs in general, but particularly to\nmaimed or wounded ones. I hope and believe, however, the bird is ft ill living\nand the traveller will find I have not over-rated this wonderful bird\u2019s merit.\u201d\nTo thefe inftances of attachment between incongruous animals from a fpirit of fo-\nciaiity or the feelings of fympathy, may be added the following inftance offondnefs\nfrom a different motive, recounted by Mr. White, in his Hiftory of Selborne.\n\u201c My friend had a little helplefs leveret brought to him, which the fervants fed\nwith milk in a fpoon ; and about the fame time his cat kittened, and the young\nwere difpatched and buried. The hare was foon loft, and fuppofed to be gone\nthe way of moil foundlings, or killed by fome dog or cat. However, in a fortnight\nafter, as the mafter was fitting in his garden in the dufk of the evening, he obier-\nved his cat, with tail erefl, trotting towards him, and calling with little fhort\nimvard notes of complacency, fuch as they ufe towards their kittens, and fome-\n'\nthing gamboling after, which proved to be the leveret, which the cat had fuppor-\nted with her milk, and continued to fupport with great affedtion. Thus was a\ngraminivorous animal nurtured by a carnivorous and predaceous one ! Why fo cruel\nand fanguinary a beaft as a cat, of the ferocious genus of fel is, the murium leo,\nas\n2\n\fas Linnaeus calls it, fhould be affedted with any tendernefs towards an animal\nwhich is its natural prey, is not fo eafy to determine. This ftrange affedtion\nprobably was occafioned by that defiderium, thofe tender maternal feelings,\nwhich the lofs of her kittens had awakened in her bread; *, and by the compla-\ncency and eafe (he derived to herfelf from the procuring her teats to be drawn,\nwhich were too much diftended with milk, till from habit flhe became as much\ndelighted with this foundling as if it had been her real offspring. This incident\nis no bad folution of that ftrange circumftance which grave hiftorians as well as\nthe poets affert, of expofed children being fometimes nurtured by female wild\nbeads that probably had loft their young. For it is not one whit more marvellous\nthat Romulus and Remus, in their infant ftate, fhould be nurfed by a fhe-wolf,\nthan that a poor little fucking leveret fhould be foftered and cherifhed by a bloody\ngrimalkin.\nThat brute animals poffefs refledlion -and fentiment, and are fufceptible of the\nkindly as well as the irrafcible pafilons, independently of fexual attachment and na-\ntural affedtion ; and that they have a great fhare of fidelity, of pride, and even a\nfenfe of glory, may be demonftrated from the elephant, the horfe, and the dog.\nElephants, even in a favage ftate, are peaceable and gentle creatures. They never\nufe their weapons but in defence of themfelves or companions. Their focial dif-\npofitions are fo ftrong, that they are feldom found alone, but march always in large\ntroops : the oldeft and moft experienced lead the van *, the younger, or lame ones,\nkeep in the middle ; and thofe of a fecond rate, as to age, walk in the rear. The\nfemales carry their young on their tufks, embracing them at the fame time with their\ntrunk. They feldom march in this regular order but when they reckon the jour-\nney dangerous, fuch as an expedition to cultivated lands, where they expedt to\nmeet with refiftance. On other occafions they are lefs cautious ; fome of them fall-\ning behind of feparating from the reft, but feldom fo far as to be without the\nreach of afliftance by alarming and affembling their companions. It is dangerous\nto offer them the leaft injury ; for they run ftraight upon the offender \u2022, and al-\nthough the weight of their body be great, their fteps are fo large, that they eafily\noutrun the fwifteft man, whom they either pierce with their tufks, or feize with\ntheir trunk, dart him in the air like a ftone, and then trample him under their feet.\nBut they never attack any perfon unlefs when provoked. However, as they are\nextremely fenfible and delicate with regard to injuries, it is always prudent to keep\nout of their way. Travellers who frequent thofe countries kindle large fires, and\nbeat drums during the night, in order to prevent their approach. After being\nonce attacked by men, or falling into any ambufh, they are faid never to forget\nthe injury, but fearch for every opportunity of getting revenge. As they are en-\nNo. 7.

In a fhort\ntime he underftands figns, and the found of his mafter\u2019s voice. He diftinguifhes\nthe language of paffion, of command, of fatisfadion ; and ads accordingly.\nHe receives his orders with attention, and executes them with prudence and alai-\ncrity, but without precipitation. He eafily learns to bow his knees and lower his\nbody, for the convenience of thofe who mount him. He carefles his friends with\nhis trunk. He lifts burdens with his trunk, and aflifts thofe who are loading him\nin laying them on his back. He delights in fhining harnefs and trappings. When\nyoked in a cart or waggon, he pulls equally and cheerfully, unlefs he be abufed\nby injudicious chaftifeme-nts. His guide is generally mounted on his neck, with\na fmall rod of iron fharp at the point in his hand; he direds his motion by prick-\ning him on the ears and head ; but, for the moft part, a word is fufficient, A\ntame elephant will do more labour than fix horfes*, but then he requires a propor-\ntional quantity of food. T hey are the principal beafts of burden in many parts of\nAfrica and the Eaft Indies. They carry facks and bundles of all kinds on their\nneck, back, and tufks. They never lofe or damage any thing committed to their\ncare: they will ftand on the edge of a river, take bundles off their necks and tufks,\nlay them carefully in a boat whenever they are defired, and try with their trunk\nwhether they are properly fituated ; if they be loaded with cafks, they go in queft\nof ftones to prop them and prevent them from rolling. The elephant is not only\nthe moft tradable, but the moft intelligent, of animals; fenfible of benefits, and\nrefentful of injuries. In India, they were once employed in the launching of\nfhips : one was direded to force a very large veflfel into the water ; the work prov-\ned fuperior to his ftrength ; his mafter, with a farcaftic tone, bid the keeper take\naway this lazy beaft and bring another : the poor animal inftantly repeated his\nefforts, fradured his fkull, and died on the fpot. In Delli, an elephant palling\nalong the ftreets, put his trunk into a taylor\u2019s fhop, where feveral people were at\nwork ; one of them pricked the end with his needle : the beaft pafled on ; but in\nthe next dirty puddle filled his trunk with water, returned to the fhop, and fpurt-\ning every drop among the people who had offended him, fpoiled their work. An\nelephant in Adfmeer, which often paffed through the bazer or market, as he went\nby a certain herb-woman, always received from her a mouthful of greens : at\nlength he was feized with one of his periodical fits of rage, broke his fetters, and,\nrunning through the market, put thearowd to flight ;\namong others, this woman,\nwho\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 95\nwho in hafte forgot a little child fhe had brought with her. The animal recolledt-\ning the fpot where his benefadtrefs was wont to fit, took up the infant gently in his\ntrunk, and placed it in fafety on a flail before a neighbouring houfe. Another,\nin his madnefs, killed his cornac or governor : the wife feeing the misfortune,\ntook her two children and flung them before the elephant, faying, \u201cNow you\nhave deftroyed their father, you may as well put an end to their lives and mine.\u201d\nIt inftantly flopped, relented, took the greatefl of the children, placed him on\nits neck, adopted him for his cornac, and never afterwards would permit any body\nelfe to mount it. A foldier at Pondicherry, who was accuftomed, whenever he\nreceived the portion that came to his fhare, to carry a certain quantity of it to one\nof thefe animals, having one day drank rather too freely, and finding himfelf pur-\nfued by the guards, who were going to take him to prifon, took refuge under the\nelephant\u2019s body and fell afleep. In vain did the guard try to force him from this\nafylum, as the elephant protected him with his trunk. The next morning the fol-\ndier, recovering from his drunken fit, fhuddered with horror to find himfelf\nflretched under the belly of this huge animal. The elephant, which without\ndoubt perceived the man\u2019s embarraffment, carefled him with his trunk, in order\nto infpire him with courage and make him underftand that he might now depart in\nfafety. A painter was defirous of drawing the elephant which was kept in the me-\nnagerie at Verfailles in an uncommon attitude, which was that of holding his trunk\nraifed up in the air with his mou.th open. The painter\u2019s boy, in order to keep the\nanimal in this pofture, threw fruit into his mouth ; but as the lad frequently de-\nceived him, and made an offer only of throwing him the fruit, he grew angr^l\nand, as if he had known that the painter\u2019s intention of drawing him was the caufe\nof the affront that was offered him, inftead of revenging himfelf on the lad, he\nturned his refentment on the maffcer, and taking up a quantity of water in his\ntrunk, threw it on the paper on which the painter was drawing, and fpoiled it.\nAt the Cape of Good Hope, it is cuftomary to kill thffe animals, for the fake of\ntheir teeth, by the chace . Three horfemen, well mounted and armed with lances,\nattack the elephant alternately, each relieving the other as they fee their compa-\nnion preffed, till the beafl is fubdued. Three Dutchmen (brothers), who had\nmade large fortunes by this bufinefs, determined to retire to Eqrope, and enjoy\nthe fruits of their labours ; but refolved, before they went, to have a laft chace\nby way of amufement: they met with their game; and began the attack in the\nufual manner j but unfortunately one of their horfes fell down and flung its rider :\nthe enraged animal inftantly feized the unhappy man with its trunk, flung him\nup to a vaft height in the air, and received him on one of its tufks ; then turning\ntowards the two other brethren, as if it were with an afpedt of revenge and infult,\nheld out to them the impaled wretch writhing cn the bloody tooth.\nWhen\n\fgt> A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nWhen the elephant is properly managed, he lives very long even in a ftate of\nilavery and labour. That fome have lived in this ftate an hundred and thirty\nyears, is pretty well authenticated. In a natural ftate, they often exceed two hun-\ndred years, and propagate their fpecie3 till they are an hundred and twenty : it is\nthirty years before they come to their full growth. Elephants do not copulate like\nother quadrupeds. The fituation of the parts feems to render this mode of jun&ion\nimpoflible. The female elephant has not like other quadrupeds the orifice of the\nvagina adjacent to the anus ; for it is fituated nearly in the middle of the belly,\nabout two and a half or three feet diftant from the anus. On the other hand, the\nmale organ is by no means proportioned to the magnitude of his body, nor to fo\nlong an interval, which in the fituation fuppofed would preclude the pra&icability\nof his approach. Naturalifts as well as travellers agree in affirming, that the male\norgan of the elephant exceeds not either in length or diameter that of a horfe. It\nis, therefore, impoffible that he fhould attain his end in the ordinary pofition of\nquadrupeds. The female muft neceffarily lie on her back. De Feynes and Ta-\nvernier pofitively aflfert, that thefe animals cannot intermix in any other manner,\nand the fituation of the parts confirms their evidence. They require, therefore, more\ntime and conveniency for this operation than other quadrupeds \u2022, and it is perhaps\nfor this reafon that they never copulate but when they enjoy full liberty, and have\nevery neceffary article at their command. The female muft not only confent, but\nfolicit the male, by a pofition which ffie never affumes unlefs when fhe thinks her-\nfelf in perfect retirement. The male makes a pit or hollow in the ground, and\naffifts his confort to lay herfelf on her back ; and in cafe he finds her perfectly\ncompliant and agreeable, very complaifantly helps her up again after the bufinefs\nis finifhed, by throwing his trunk round her neck. Thefe animals, during the\nfeafon of love, remain almoft in the moft inacceffible places of the forefts. They\nobferve the greateft delicacy in their amours, abhorring nothing fo much as to be\nfeen by their companions. The troop divide themfelves into couples, fteal off into\nthe moft fecret places of the foreft, and then give way to all the impulfes of na-\nture. The force of nature is fo very ftrong, that in the rutting feafon, the tame\nmale elephants are obliged to be chained for four or five weeks, during which time\nthey difcharge vaft quantities of femen, and are fo furious, that their cornacs or go-\nvernors cannot come near them without danger. The approach of the rutting feafon\nis eafily known ; for fome days before it happens, an oily liquor flows from a fmall\nhole on each fide of the head. The domeftic female on thefe occafions fometimes\nmakes her efcape, and joins the wild males in the woods.

They bring forth but one at a time, though the female has\ntwo dugs, one on each fide the bread:. The young one, as foon as it comes into the\nworld, is as large as a wild boar, and is furnifhed with teeth : however, the large tufks\ndo not make their appearance till fome time after, and at the age of fix months\nthey are feveral inches long. Elephants of this age are as large as an ox when in a\nnatural Hate.\nThe intrepidity and fagacity of the horfe, has been regarded with admiration by\nall ranks of men, and in all ages of the world. Even in a domeftic Hate he is bold\nand fiery; and, equally undaunted as his mailer, faces danger and death with\nardour and magnanimity. He delights in the noife and tumult of arms, and feems\nto feel the glory of vidlory : he exults in the chace ; his eyes fparkle with emula-\ntion in the courfe. But though bold and intrepid, he is docile and tradlabie : he\nknows how to govern and check the natural vivacity and fire of his temper. He\nnot only yields to the hand, but feems to confult the inclination of his rider.\nConftantly obedient to the impreffions he receives, his motions are entirely regu-\nlated by the will of his mailer. He in fome meafure refigns his very exillence to\nthe pleafure of man. He delivers up his whole powers, he referves nothing; he\nwill rather die than difobey. Who could endure to fee a character fo noble, abufed ?\nwho could be guilty of fuch grofs barbarity ? none but wretches moll relentlels\nand unfeeling ! We need go no further than the horfe, to prove how ftrongly na-\nture has endowed brute animals with memory ; for whatever roads, paltures, inns,\nor llables, a horfe has been accuftomed to, though removed for years to a diffcant\npart of the country, he never forgets them ; but if ever he returns, or pafies by\nthem again, he gives evident tokens that he has been accuftomed to the place.\nThe celebrated equeftrians, Hughes and Aftley, could, I doubt not, furnifh a\nthoufand curious anecdotes to illuftrate this faft; but the following, I think,\nbeing incontrovertible, will be fufficient for the purpofe.\nMr. James George, a gentleman of Southampton, in the county of Hants,\nloll his horfe from off the common on which he had been accuftomed to be turn-\ned out. About twelve months after, the horfe was feen and recognized, grazing\non a common near Burfiedon. Soon as this was made known, Mr. George fent\nhis fervant with a bridle, and ordered the horfe to be caught, and brought home.\nIn a few days after, a Mr. Langtree of Burfiedon, came to Mr. George, to demand\nthe horfe, infilling it was his property, and had been fo for years. The horfe,\nhowever, being pofitively withheld, Mr. Langtree brought an adlion for his re-\ncovery, which was tried at Winchefter Lent affizes, in March 1789. The plain-\ntiff, on the pofitive affirmations of fix or feven witnefies, traced the fale of the\nhorle from one dealer\u2019s hands to another, as far back as the year 1784, when he\nNo. 7. Cc was\n\foS A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nwas purchafed of one farmer Mofes, in the county of Suffex, who bred him ; and\nthe horfe was identified by them all. On the part of the defendant, the mod po-\nfitive evidence was adduced, to (hew that this horfe was not the horfe fworn to\nhave been fo bought and fold by the witnefies on the other fide, but was, and\nhad been, the real property of Mr. George, from the year 1786. In this fituation,\nwith the horfe equally fworn to and identified by the witneffes on both fides, who\nhad all been to infpeft him but the day before the trial, the judge, by crofs-exa-\nmining the lad witnefs, difcovered, that when the defendant\u2019s fervant brought\nthe horfe back, he turned him into his old pafturage on Southampton common,\nwhere he had not been many minutes, before he fet off, of his own accord, towards\nSouthampton and in his way eroded a number of lanes and turnings, pafied by\neight or ten (tables, until he came to the (table of Mr. George, where he inftantly\n(topped, and neighed at the (table door, as much as to fay he was come back,\nand begged to be taken in. This circumftance decided the verdidt. The learned\njudge remarked, that there could be no collufion in the evidence derived from the\nmemory of the horfe, and diredted the jury to find for the defendant. This cha-\nradter, though natural to the animal, is improved by habit and education. His\neducation commences with the lofs of liberty, and is finilhed by conftraint. In\nthe vad defarts of America, they roam at large without any redraint. M. de Salle\nrelates, that he faw, in the year 1685, horfes feeding in the meadows of North\nAmerica, near the bay of St. Louis, which were fo ferocious that nobody durft\ncome near them. Oexmelin fays, that he has feen large troops of them in St. Do-\nmingo running in the valleys ; that when any perfon approached, they all (lopped ;\nand one of them would advance till within a certain didance, then fnort with his\nnofe, take to his heels, and the whole troop after him. Thefe relations fufficiently\nprove, that the horfe, when at full liberty, has no inclination to alfociate with\nmankind \u2022,\nthat all the foftnefs and dudlility of his temper proceed entirely from\nthe culture and polifh he receives in his domeftic education, which in fome mea-\nfure commences as foon as he is brought forth.\u2014The horfe has not only a gran-\ndeur in his general appearance, but there is the greateft fymmetry and propor-\ntion in the different parts of his body. The regularity and proportion of the dif-\nferent parts of the head gives him an air of lightnefs, which is well fupported by\nthe (Irength and beauty of his cheft. He eredls his head, as if willing to exalt\nhimfelf above the condition of other quadrupeds: his eyes are open and lively;\nhis ears are handfome, and of a proper height ; his mane adorns his neck, and\ngives him the appearance of (Irength and boldnefs. At the age of two years, or\ntwo years and an half, the horfe is in a condition to propagate ; and the mare,\nlike mod other females, is ready to receive him (till fooner. But the foals pro-\nduced\n\f99\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nduced by fuch early embraces are generally ill-made and weakly. The horfe\nfhould never be admitted to the mare till he is four or four and a half-, this is\nonly meant with regard to draught-horfes. Fine horfes fhould not be admitted to\nthe mare before they be fix years old \u2022, and Spanilh ftallions not till feven. The\nmares are generally in feafon from the beginning of April to the end of June;\nbut their chief ardour for the horfe lafts but about fifteen or twenty days, and this\ncritical feafon fhould always be embraced. The ftallion ought to be found, well\nmade, vigorous, and of a good breed. For fine faddle-horfes, foreign ftallions,\nas Arabians, Turks, Barbs, and Andalufians, are preferable to all others. Next\nto thefe, Britifh ftallions are the beft ; becaufe they originally fprang from thofe\nabove-mentioned, and are very little degenerated. The ftallions of Italy, and\nefpecially the Neapolitans, are very good. The beft ftallions for draught or\ncarriage horfes, are thofe of Naples, Denmark, Holftein, and Frizeland. The\nftallions for faddle-horfes fhould be from fourteen to fifteen hands high, and for\ndraught horfes at leaft fifteen hands. Neither ought the colour of ftallions to be\noverlooked \u2022, as a fine black, grey, bay, forrel, chefnut, &c. Befides thefe external\nqualities, a ftallion ought to have courage, tradlability, fpirit, agility, a fenfi-\nble mouth, fure limbs, &c. Thefe precautions in the choice of a ftallion are the\nmore neceflary, becaufe he has been found by experience to communicate to his\noffspring almoft all his good or bad qualities, whether natural or acquired.\nTo fhew, more obvioufly, the reafoning faculty of brutes, and to diftinguifh\nthe operations of intellect from thofe of inftinct, we need only contemplate the\nadtions and difpofition of the dog. In a favage ftate, it muft be allowed, that\nhe is fierce, cruel, and voracious-, but, when civilized and accuftomed to live\nwith men, he is poflefled of every amiable quality. He feems to have no other\ndefire than to pleafe and protedt his mafter. He is gentle, obedient, fubmiftive,\nand faithful. Thefe dilpofitions, joined to his almoft unbounded fagacity, juftly\nclaim the efteem of mankind. Accordingly no animal is fo much careffed or\nrefpedted : he is fo ductile, and fo much formed to pleafe, that he affumes the\nvery air and temper of the family in which he refides. An animal endowed with\nfuch uncommon qualities, muft anfwer many ufeful purpofes. His fidelity and\nvigilance are daily employed to protect our perfons, our flocks, or our goods.\nThe acutenefs of his fmell gains him employment in hunting: he is frequently\nemployed as a turnfpit : atBruflels and in Holland he is trained to draw little carts\nto the herb-market ; and in the northern regions draws a fledge with his -mafter in\nit, or loaden with provifions. It is a remarkable inftindt in the dog, that when op-\nprefled with ficknefs, to which he is very fubjedt, efpecially in the beginning of\nfummer, and before ill weather;, in order to procure him a puke, he eats the leaves\nof\n\fJOO A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nof the quicken. grafs, the bearded wheat-grafs, or the rough cock\u2019s-foot grafs,\nwhich gives him immediate relief. He does not throw out his excrements protnif-\ncuoufly upon every thing that happens to be in the way, but carefully feeks ftones,\ntrunks of trees, or barren places. This is a wile inftitution of nature i for the ex -\ncrements of a dog deftroy almoft every vegetable or animal fubftance. They are of\n{uch a putrid nature, that if a man\u2019s ffioe touches them when recently expelled, that\nparticular part will rot in a few days. He obferves the fame method in making his\nurine, which he throve out at a fide. It is remarkable, that a dog will not pafs a\nftoneor a wall againft which any other dog has pified, without following his exam-\nple, although an hundred fhould occur in a few minutes, infomuch that it is afto-\nniffiing how fuch a quantity can be fecreted in fo fnort a time. The principal ob-\njection to dogs, is the {hocking circumftance of their going mad, and of commu-\nnicating the diforder to whatever perfon, or animal, it may chance to bite ; and of\nwhich the cure has ever been confidered precarious and uncertain. From a minute\ninveft\u2019igation of the poifonous qualities of the hydrophobia, and the effeCt it has on\nthe blood \u2022, as well as from a confideration of what the blood and juices undergo\nby emerging the body in the fea, I am bold to affirm that my Solar TinCture, ad-\nminiftered in the way I have directed, is a certain and infallible cure for this de-\nplorable malady ; at leaft as far as human certainty can go with refpeCt to medi-\ncine. I would not however be underftood to encourage a negligence in thofe who\nkeep dogs, to watch well their aCtions, and on the fmalleft fufpicion that fuch a\nmisfortune is near, to have them inftantly difpatched, as they may be eafily re-\nplaced, and much anxiety and diftrefs prevented.-\u2014With regard to the propagation\nof dogs, the females admit the males before they are twelve months old. They\nremain in feafon ten, twelve, or even fifteen, days, during which time they will\nadmit a variety of males. They come in feafon generally twice in the year, and\nmore frequently in -the cold than in the hot months. The male difeovers the con-\ndition of the female by the finell ;\nbut ffie feldom admits him the firft fix or feven\ndays. One coition will make her conceive a great number of young ; but, when\nnot reftrained, ffie will admit feveral dogs every day \u2022, ffie feems to have no choice\nor predileClion, except in favour of large dogs : from this circumftance it fome-\ntimes happens, that a ftnall female, who has admitted a maftiff, periffies in bring-\ning forth her young. During the time of copulation, thefe animals cannot fepa-\nrate themfelves, but remain united fo long as the ereCtion fubfifts. This is owing\nto the ftruCture of the parts. The dog has not only a bone in his penis, but in the\nmiddle of the corpus cavernofum there is a large hollow, which is blown up in the\ntime of ereCtion to a confiderable bulk. The female, on the other hand, has a\nlarger clitoris than perhaps any other animal : befides, a large firm protuberance\nrifes\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 101\nrifes in the time of copulation, and remains perhaps longer than that of the male, and\nprevents him from retiring till it fubfides : accordingly, after the ad of penetrating\nis effected, the male turns about in order to reft himfelf on his legs, and remains\nin that pofition till the parts turn flaccid. The female goes with young about nine\nweeks. They generally bring forth from fix to twelve puppies. Thofe of a fmall\nfize bring forth five, four, and fometimes but two. They continue to copulate and\nbring forth during life, which lafts generally about fourteen or fifteen years. The\nwhelps are commonly blind, and cannot open their eyes till the tenth or twelfth\nday : the males are like the dog, the females like the bitch. \u2014The dog, the wolf,\nand the fox, are certainly derived from one original parent ; and all dogs whatso-\never, from the terrible boar-dog, to Pompey the little, were all one in the firft\ncreation. All the variety we behold in them, is either produced by change of cli-\nmate, or the accidental effed of foil, food, or Situation; or from the iftue of hu-\nman care, experiment, or caprice. Every huntfman knows what a vaft alteration\nmay be made in dogs, by induftrioufly improving the breed for twenty or thirty\nyears. Nature wifely tends to render every kind of creature fit for the country\nwhere it is to inhabit, or be employed, which is the reafon why hounds, and all\nother animals, degenerate, by being removed into contrary climates. This is ma-\nnifeft from the following experiment; if a couple of right Southern hounds be re-\nmoved to the north, and Suffered to propagate without art or mixture, they will,\nby fenfible degrees, decline into lighter bodies, and Shriller accents ; and in the\nfame way are all dogs varied, by being carried from one country to another.\nBut the utmoft efforts of human induftry and contrivance, whether afiifted by\nchange of climate, or mixture of breed, could never add one new fpecies to the\nworks of the creation. Nature is Still uniform as to the main, nor Suffers the\nAlmighty Creator to be imitated by fhort-fighted mortals. Jn Spite of art, our\nmules are always barren ; nor can the rnoft curious projector produce one amphi-\ngeneous animal that will encreafe and multiply. There appears a diftind Specific\ndifference in all living creatures; the horSe, the dog, the bear, the goat, how-\never diversified by art, by copulation, or by climate, either in Size, Shape, or\nfigure, will ever diScover Something that approximates to the charader of their\nfpecies. Above all, the peculiar inftind and appetite for generation, will prompt\nthem to own and indicate their relation. Animals of different Species will never\ncopulate together. This is one of the moft undeniable arguments that wolves,\nfoxes, and dogs, are originally the fame fpecies, becaufe in coition they are not\nonly all held together in the fame manner, but we have frequent instances of litters\nof puppies both from the dog and fox, and from the dog and wolf. Mr. Brooke,\nanimal-merchant in Holborn, turned a wolf to a Pomeranian bitch in heat\n;\nNo. 7. D d the\n\f102 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthe congrefs was immediate, and as ufual between dog and bitch : (he produced\nten puppies. Mr. Pennant law one of them at Gordon Caftle, that had very\nmuch the refemblance of a wolf, and alfo much of its nature ; being flipped at\na weak deer, it inftantly caught at the animal\u2019s throat and killed it. I could not\nlearn flays Mr. Pennant) whether this mongrel continued its fpecies ;\nbut another\nof the fame kind did, and flocked the neighbourhood of Fochabers, in the coun-\nty of Moray (where it was kept), with a multitude of curs of a molt wolfifh afpeCt.\nThere was lately living a mongrel offspring of this kind. It greatly refembled its\nwolf parent. It was firft the property of Sir Wolftein Dixey ; afterwards of Sir\nWilloughby Affon. During day it was very tame; but at night fometimes re-\nlapfed into ferocity. It never barked, but rather howled ; when it came into fields\nwhere fheep were, it would feign lamenefs, but if no one was prefent would in-\nftantly attack them. It had been feen in copulation with a bitch, which after-\nwards pupped : the breed was imagined to refemble in many refpe&s the fuppofed\nfire. It died between the age of five and fix.-\u2014The woodman of the manor of\nMongewell, in Oxfordfhire, has a bitch, which conftantly follows him, the off-\nfpring of a tame dog-fox by a fhepherd\u2019s cur j and fhe again has had puppies by a\ndog. Since there are fuch authentic proofs of the further continuance of the breed,\nwe may furely add the wolf and fox to the other fuppofed ftocks of thefe faithful\ndomeftics, particularly as moft naturalifts fuppofe the dog to have been originally\nthe production of one or other of thefe animals, tamed and civilized.\nMany and wonderful are the inftances of fagacity, fidelity, and attention, and\neven of forefight, which thefe faithful animals have evinced towards their matters.\n<Some fuch will doubtlefs occur to the minds of my readers, as falling under their\npwn obfervation ; I (hall therefore only recite two or three fuch inftances, of un-\nqueftionable authenticity.--- In the year 1791, a perfon went to a houfe in Dept-\nford, to take lodgings, under pretence that he was juft arrived from the Weft-\nIndies \u2022, and after having agreed on terms, faid he (hould fend in his trunk that\nnight, and come himfelf the next day. About nine o\u2019clock in the evening, the\ntrunk was brought in by two porters, and was carried into his bed-room. Juft\nas the family were going to bed, their little houfe-dog, deferting his ufual\nftation in the (hop, placed himfelf clofe to the chamber door where the cheft\nwas depofited, and kept up an inceffant barking. The moment the chamber\ndoor was opened, the dog flew to the cheft, againft which it barked and\nfcratched with redoubled vehemence and fury. At firft they tried to get the\ndog out of the room \u2022, but in vain. Calling in fome neighbours, and making\nthem eye-witneffes of the circumftance, they began to move the trunk about,\nwhen they quickly difcovered that it contained fometh\u2019mg alive.

He went to Mr.\nBradley\u2019s machines, to be conducted into the water. Being unacquainted with\nthe depth of the water, and no fwimmer, he found himfelf, the indant he\nquitted the machine, nearly out of his depth. Fright increafed the peril of his\nfituation, and, unnoticed by the perfon who attends the machines, he had funk\nfor the lafb time in the agonies of drowning. A large Newfoundland dog,\ndanding by accident on the fhore, and feeing the didrefs of this dranger,\nplunged in after him ;\nand feizing him by the hair of the head, conducted\nhim fafely on fliore, though it was fome time before he recovered. The gen-\ntleman afterwards purchafed the dog at a high price, but values him equally\nwith the fum total of his fortune.\u2014At the feat of the late Earl of Litchfield,\nthree miles from Blenheim, there is a portrait in the dining-room of Sir Henry\nLee, by Johndon, with that of a madid\" dog which faved his life. It feems\na fervant had formed the defign of afifaffinating his mailer and robbing the houfe j\nbut the night he had fixed on, the dog, which had never been much noticed\nby Sir Henry, for the firft time followed him up Hairs, got under his bed,\nand could not be got from thence by either mailer or man ; in the dead of\nnight, the fame fervant entered the room to execute his horrid defign, but\nwas inilantly feized by the dog, and being fecured, confeflfed his intentions.\nThere are ten quaint lines in one corner of the pidture, which conclude thus :\nBut in my dog, whereof I made no ilore,\nI find more love than thofe I trufted more.\nUpon what hypothefis can we account for a degree of forefight and penetration\ni'uch as this ? Or will it be fuggeiled, as a fclution of the difficulty, that a\ndog may poffibly become capable in a great meafure of underilanding human\ndifcourfe, and of reafoning and adling accordingly ; and that, in the prefent\ninilance, the villain had either uttered his defign in foliloquy, or imparted it\nto an accomplice, in the hearing of the animal ? It has been much difputed\nwhether the brutes have any language whereby they can exprefs their minds\nto each other ;\nor whether all the noife they make confifts only of cries inarti-\nculate, and unintelligible even to themfelves. We may indeed, from analogy,\nconclude, with great reafon, that fome of the cries of beads are really ex-\npreffions of their fentimtnts but whether one bead is capable of forming a\ndefign, and communicating that defign by any kind of language to others, is\nwhat I fhall leave to the judgment of the reader, after fubmitting tc his confider-\nation\n\fJ04 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nation the following inftance. A fparrow finding a neft that a martin had juft\nbuilt, Handing very conveniently for him, poffeffed himfelf of it. The martin,\nfeeing the ufurper in her houfe, called for help to expel him. A thoufand mar-\ntins came full fpeed, and attacked the fparrow ; but the latter being covered on\nevery fide, and prefenting only his large beak at the entrance of the neft, was in-\nvulnerable, and made the boldeft of them who durft approach him repent of their\ntemerity. After a quarter of an hour\u2019s combat, all the martins difappeared. The\nfparrow thought he had got the better, and the fpedtators judged that the martins\nhad abandoned their undertaking. Not in the leaft. Immediately they returned\nto the charge *, and each of them having procured a little of that tempered earth\nwith which they make their nefts, they all at once fell upon the fparrow, and in-\nclofed him in the neft to perifh there, though they could not drive him thence.\nCan it be imagined that the martins could have been able to hatch and concert\nthis defign all of them together, without fpeaking to each other, or without fome\nmedium of communication equivalent to language ?\nFrom all thefe extraordinary endowments, manifefted by brute animals of differ-\nent countries and kinds, fome philofophers have maintained that brutes are endow-\ned with a foul, though effentially inferior to that of men ; and to this foul they\nhave allowed immortality. Father Bougeant, a Jefuit, has lately publilhed a\ntreatife exprefsly on this fubjedt, entitled, A philofophical amufement on the language\nof brutes ,\nin which he affirms that they are animated by evil fpirits, or devils.\nThe ftrangenefs of this dodtrine, has induced me to give the outline of his argu-\nments, fince they cannot fail to prove entertaining to the reader. \u201c Reafon (fays\nhe) naturally inclines us to believe that beafts have a fpiritual foul j and the only\nthing that oppofes this fentiment is, the confequences that might be inferred from\nit. If brutes have a foul, that foul muft be either matter or fpirit ; it muft be one\nof the two, and yet you dare affirm neither. You dare not fay it is matter, be-\ncaufe you muft then neceffarily fuppofe matter to be capable of thinking ; nor will\nyou fay that it is fpirit, this opinion bringing with it confequences contrary to the\nprinciples of religion and this, among others, that man would differ from beafts\nonly by the degrees of plus and minus ; which would demoliffi the very foundation\nof all religion. Therefore, if I can elude all thefe confequences ; if I can affign\nto beafts a fpiritual foul, without ftriking at the dodtrines of religion ; it is evident,\nthat my fyftem, being moreover the moft agreeable to reafon, is the only warrant-\nable hypothefis. Now I ffiall, and can do it, with the greateft eafe imaginable.\nI even have means, by the fame method, to explain many very obfcure paffages in\nthe Holy Scripture, and to refolve fome very great difficulties which are not well\nconfuted. This we ffiall unfold in a more particular manner. Religion teaches\nus.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 103\nus, that the devils, from the very moment they had finned, were reprobate, and\nthat they were doomed to burn for ever in hell ; but the church has not yet deter-\nmined whether they do adually endure the torments to which they are condemned.\nIt may then be thought that they do not yet fuffer them, and that the execution of\nthe verdift brought againd them is referved for the day of final judgment.\u2014Now\nwhat I pretend to infer from hence is, that, till doomfday comes, God, in order\nnot to fuffer fo many legions of reprobate fpirits to be of no ufe, has didributed\nthem through the feveral fpaces of the world, to ferve the defigns of his Provi-\ndence and make his omnipotence to appear. Some, continuing in their natural\ndate, bufy themfelves in tempting men, in feducing and tormenting them ; either\nimmediately, as Job\u2019s devil, and thofe that lay hold of human bodies -,\nor by the\nminiftry of forcerers or phantoms. Thefe wicked fpirits are thofe whom the fcrip-\nture calls the powers of darknefs, or the powers of the air. God, with the others,\nmakes millions of beads of all kinds, which ferve for the ufes of men, which fill\nthe univerfe, and caufe the wifdom and omnipotence of the Creator to be admired.\nBy that means I can eafily conceive, on the one hand, how the devils can tempt\nus ; and on the other, how beads can think, know, have fentiments, and a\nfpiritual foul, without any way driking at the dodtrines of religion. I am no\nlonger furprifed to fee them have forecad, memory, and judgment. I fhould\nrather have occadon to wonder at their having no more, fince their foul very likely\nis more perfect than ours. But I difcover the reafon of this : it is becaufe, in beads\nas well as in ourfelves, the operations of the mind are dependent on the material\norgans of the machine to which it is united j and thofe organs being grolfer and\nlefs perfedt than in us, it follows, that the knowledge, the thoughts, and the\nother fpiritual operations of the beads, mud of courle be lefs perfect than ours :\nand if thefe proud fpirits know their own difmal date, what an humiliation mud\nit be to them thus to fee themfelves reduced to the condition of beads ! But, whe-\nther they know it or no, fo fhameful a degradation is dill, with regard to them,\nthe primary effedt of the divine vengeance I jud mentioned ; it is an anticipated\nhell.\u201d\u2014Having mentioned the prejudices againd this hypothefis, fuch particular-\nly as the pleafure which people of fenfe and religion take in beads and birds, efpe-\ncially all forts of domedic animals ; he proceeds, \u201c Do we love beads for their\nown fakes ? No. As they are altogether drangers to human fociety, they can have\nno other appointment but that of being ufeful and amufing. And what care we\nwhether it be a devil or any other creature that amufes us ? The thought of it,\nfar from Ihocking, pleafes me mightily. I with gratitude admire the goodnefs of\nthe Creator, who gave me fo many little devils to ferve and amufe me. If I am\ntold that thefe poor devils are doomed to fuffer eternal tortures, I admire God\u2019s\nNo. 7.

But the cure of a prejudice is not to be\neffected in a moment ; it is done by time and reflection : give me leave then lightly\nto touch upon this difficulty, in order to obferve a very important thing to you.\nFerfuaded as we are that beafts have intelligence, have we not all of us a thoufand\ntimes pitied them for the exceffive evils which the majority of them are expofed to,\nand in reality fuffer P How unhappy is the condition of horfes ! we are apt to fay\nupon feeing a horfe whom an unmerciful carman is murdering with blows.

What are we,\nthen, to think of the horrible exceftes of miferies undergone by beafts ? miferies,\nindeed, far greater than thofe endured by men. This is, in any other fyftem, an\nincomprehenfible myftery ; whereas nothing is more eafy to be conceived from the\nfyftem I propofe. The rebellious fpirits deferve a punifhment ftill more rigorous,\nand happy is it for them that their punifhment is. deferred. In a word, God\u2019s\ngoodnefs is vindicated, man himfelf is juftified : for what right can we have,\nwithout neceffity, and often in the way of mere diverfion, to take away the life of\nmillions of beafts, if God had not authorifed us fo to do ? And beafts being as\nfenfible as ourfelves of pain and death, how could a juft and merciful God have\ngiven man that privilege, if they were not fo many guilty victims of the divine\nvengeance ?\u2014But hear ftill fomething more convincing, and of greater confe-\nquence: beafts, by nature, are extremely vicious. We know well that they\nnever fin, becaule they are not free; but this is the only condition wanting to\nmake them finners. The voracious birds and beafts of prey are cruel. Many\ninfeCts of one and the fame fpecies devour one another. Cats are perfidious and\nungrateful ; monkeys are mifchievous ; and dogs envious. All beafts in general\nare jealous and revengeful to excefs ; not to mention many other vices we obferve\nin them : and at the fame time that they are by nature fo very vicious, they have,\nfay we, neither the liberty nor any helps to refill the bias that hurries them into\nfo many bad aCtions. They are, according to the fchools, neceffitated to do evil,\nto\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 107\nto difconcert the general order, to commit whatever is moil contrary to the notion\nwe have of natural juftice and to the principles of virtue. What monfters are thefe\nin a world originally created for order and juftice to reign in ? This is, in good\npart, what formerly perfuaded the Manicheans, that there were of neceflity two\norders of things, one good, and the other bad \u2022, and that the beafts were not the\nwork of the good principle : a monftrous error ! But how then fhall we believe\nthat beafts came out of the hands of their Creator with qualities fo very ftrange !\nIf man is fo very wicked and corrupt, it is becaufe he has himfelf through fin per-\nverted the happy nature God had given him at his creation. Of two things, then,\nwe aiuft fay one : either that God has taken delight in making beafts fo vicious as\nthey are, and of giving us in them models of what is moft fhameful in the world ;\nor that they have, like man, original fin, which has perverted their primitive na-\nture.\u2014 -The firft of thefe propofitions finds very difficult accefs to the mind, and\nis an exprefs contradidlion to the holy fcriptures ; which fay, that whatever came\nout of God\u2019s hands, at the time of the creation of the world, was good, yea very\ngood. What good can there be in a monkey\u2019s being fo very mifchievous, a dog\nfo full of envy, a cat fo malicious ? But then many authors have pretended, that\nbeafts, before man\u2019s fall, were different from what they are now ; and that it was\nin order to puniffi man that they became fo wicked. But this opinion is a mere\nfuppofition of which there is not the leaft footftep in Holy Scripture. It is a piti-\nful fubterfuge to elude a real difficulty : this at moft might be faid of the beafts\nwith whom man has a fprt of correfpondence ; but not at all of the birds, fifties,\nand infedts, which have no manner of relation to him. We muft then have re-\ncourfe to the fecond propofition, that the nature of beafts has, like that of man,\nbeen corrupted by fome original fin : another hypothefis, void of foundation, and\nequally inconfiftent with realon and religion, in all the fyftems which have been\nhitherto efpoufed concerning the fouls of beafts. What party are we to take ?\nWhy, admit of my fyftem, and all is explained. The fouls of beafts are refrac-\ntory fpirits which have made themfelves guilty towards Gcd. The fin in beafts\nis no original fin \u2022, it is a perfonal crime, which has corrupted and perverted their\nnatureinitswholefubftar.ee-, hence all the vices and corruption we obferve in\nthem, though they can be no longer criminal, becaufe God, by irrecoverably re-\nprobating them, has at the fame time divefted them of their liberty.\u201d\nThefe quotations contain the ftrength of father Bougeant\u2019s hypothefis, which alfo\nhath had its followers -, but the reply to it is obvious. Beafts, though remarkably\nmifch'ievous, are not completely fo j they are in many inftances capable of grati-\ntude and love, which devils cannot poffibly be. The very fame paffions that are\nin the brutes exift in the human nature j\nand if we chofe to argue from the\nexiftence\n\fio8 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nexiftence of thofe pafllons, and the afcendency they have over mankind at fome\ntimes, we may fay with as great juftice, that the fouls of men are devils, as that\nthe fouls of brutes are. All that can be reafonably inferred from the greater pre-\nvalency of the malignant pafllons among the brutes than among men, is, that the\nformer have lefs rationality than men - and accordingly it is found, that among\nfavages, who exercife their reafon lefs than other men, every fpecies of barbarity\nis pradtifed, without being deemed a crime. \u2014Upon the whole, it is impoffible\nro deduce this variety of adtion, in animals, from a general and uniform inftindt\nonly. For they accommodate their operations to times and circumftances. They\ncombine \u00bb they choofe the favourable moment j they avail themfelves of the\noccafion, and feem to receive inftrudtion by experience. Many of their operations\nannounce refledtion : the bird repairs a fhattered neft, inftead of conftrudting in-\nftindlively a new one : the hen, who has been robbed of her eggs, changes her\nplace in order to lay the remainder with more fecurity : the cat difcovers both\ncare and artifice in concealing her kittens. Again, it is evident, that, on many\noccafions, animals know their faults and miftakes, and corredt them ; they\nfometimes contrive the molt ingenious methods of obtaining their ends, and\nwhen one method fails, have recourfe to another ; and they have, without doubt,\na kind of language for the mutual communication of their ideas. How is all this\nto be accounted for, unlefs we fuppofe them endowed with the powers of perceiv-\ning, thinking, remembering, comparing, and judging ? They certainly have\nthefe powers, in a degree inferior to the human fpecies, and form claffes below\nthem in the graduated fcale of intelligent beings 5 but their adtions not being di-\nredted to moral ends, are confequently not accountable and proper fubjedts for\nreward or punilhment in a future world.\nAfter all, it does not appear upon what principle of reafon and juftice it is,\nthat mankind have founded their right over the lives of every creature that is placed\nin a fubordinate rank of being to themfelves. Whatever claim they may have in\nright of food and felf-defence, did they extend their privilege no farther, number-\nlefs beings might enjoy their lives in peace, who are now hurried out of them by\nthe moft wanton and unneceffary cruelties. It is furely difficult to difcover why\nit fliould be thought lefs inhuman to crulh to death a harmlefs infedt, whofe Angle\noffence is that he eats that food which nature has prepared for his fuftenance, than\nit would be were we to kill any bulky creature for the fame reafon. There are\nfew tempers fo hardened to the impreflions of humanity, as not to Ihudder at the\nthought of the latter ; and yet the former is univerfally pradtifed, without the\nleaft check of compaffion. This feems to arife from the grofs error of fuppofing,\nthat every creature is really in itfelf contemptible, which happens to be clothed\n2 with\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 109\nwith a body infinitely difproportionate to our own, not confidering that great\nand little are merely relative terms. But the inimitable Shakefpeare would teach\nus, that\n\u2022\nthe poor beetle that we tread upon,\nIn corp\u2019ral fuff \u2019ranee, feels a pang as great\nAs when a giant dies.\nAnd, indeed, there is every reafon to believe, that the fenfations of many infefls\nare as exquifite as thofe of creatures of far more enlarged dimenfions, perhaps\neven more fo. The millepede, for inftance, rolls itfelf round upon the flighted:\ntouch, and the fnail gathers in her horns upon the leaft approach of our hand.\nAre not thefe the ftrongeft indications of their fenfibility ? and is it any evidence\nof ours, that we are not therefore induced to treat them with a more fymphathifing\ntendernefs ?\nI cannot conclude thefe obfervations on the inftin\u00a3t and oeconomy of brute\nanimals, without reciting the following mod remarkable account of the land-\ncrab, which inhabits the Bahama Ifiands, as well as mod parts between the\ntropics, and feeds upon vegetables. Thefe creatures live not only in a kind of\norderly fociety in their retreats in the mountains, but regularly once a year, march\ndown to the fea-fide in a body of fome millions at a time. As they multiply in\ngreat numbers, they choofe the month of April or May to begin their expedition ;\nand then Tally out by thoufands from the flumps of hollow trees, from the clefts\nof rocks, and from the holes which they dig for themfelves under the furface of\nthe earth. At that time the whole ground is covered with this band of adven-\nturers ; there is no fetting down one\u2019s foot without treading upon them. The\nfea is their place of deftination, and to that they direct their march with right-\nlined precifton. No geometrician could fend them to their deftined flation by\na fhorter courfe ;\nthey neither turn to the right nor left, whatever obflacles\nintervene-, and even if they meet with a houfe, they will attempt to fcale the\nwalls to keep the unbroken tenor of their way. ' But though this be the general\norder of their route, they, upon other occafions, are obliged to conform to\nthe face of the country ; and if it is interfe&ed with rivers, they are then feen\nto wind along the courfe of the ftream. The proceflion fets forward from the\nmountains with the regularity of an army under the guidance of an experienced\ncommander. They are commonly divided into three battalions; of which the\nfirft confifts of the ftrongeft and boldeft males, that, like pioneers, march for-\nward to clear the route and face the greateft dangers. Thefe are often obliged\nto halt for want of rain, and to go into the molt convenient encampment till\n\u2022the weather changes. The main body of the army is compofed of females.\nNo. 8. F-f which\n\fno A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nwhich never leave the' mountains till the rain is fet in for fome time, and there\ndefcend in regular battalia, being formed into columns of fifty paces broad*\nand three miles deep, and fo clofe that they almoft cover the ground. Three\nor four days after this, the rear-guard follows, a ftraggllng undifciplined tribe,\nconfifting of males and females, but neither fo rebuff nor fo vigorous as the\nformer. The night is their chief time of proceeding \u2022, but if it rains by day,\nthey do not fail to profit by the occafion \u2022, and they continue to move for-\nward in their flow uniform manner. When the fun fhines and is hot uporr\nthe furface of the ground, they then make an universal halt, and wait till the\ncool of the evening. When they are terrified, they march back in a confufed\ndisorderly manner, holding up their nippers, with which they fometimes tear\noff a piece of the fkin, and then leave the weapon where they infii&ed the\nwound. They even try to intimidate their enemies ; for they often clatter\ntheir nippers together, as if it were to threaten thofe that come to difturb them.\nBut though they thus ftrive to be formidable to man, they are much more\nfo to each other ; for they are poflefled of one moft unfocial property, which\nis, that if any of them by accident is maimed in fuch a manner as to be inca-\npable of proceeding, the reft fall upon and devour it on the fpot, and then\npurfue their journey.\u2014When, after a fatiguing march, and efcaping a thou-\nfand dangers, (for they are fometimes three months in getting to the fhore,)\nthey have arrived at their deftined port, they prepare to caft their fpawn.\nThe peas are as yet within their bodies, and not excluded, as is ufual in ani-\nmals of this kind, under the tail ;\nfor the creature waits for the benefit of\nfea-water to help the delivery. For this purpofe the crab has no fooner reached\nthe fhore, than it eagerly goes to the edge of the water, and lets the waves\nwafh over its body two or three times. This feems only a preparation for\nbringing their fpawn to maturity ; for, without further delay, they withdraw\nto feek a lodging upon land ; in the mean time the fpawn grows larger, is ex-\ncluded out of the body, and flicks to the barbs under the flap, or more pro-\nperly the tail. This bunch is feen as big as an hen\u2019s egg, and exactly refem-\nbling the roes of herrings. In this ftate of pregnancy they once more feek\nthe fhore for the laft time ; and fhaking off their fpawn into the water, leave\naccident to bring it to maturity. At this time whole fhoals of hungry fifh.\nare at the fhore in expectation of this annual fupply \u2022, the fea to a great diftance\nitems black with them \u2022, and about two thirds of the crabs eggs are im-\nmediately devoured by thefe rapacious invaders. The eggs that efcape are\nhatched under the fandy and, foon after, millions at a time of the little crabs\nare feen quitting the fhore, and flowly travelling up to the mountains. The\nold.\n\fm\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nold ones, however, are not fo aftive to return ; they haVfe become fo feeble\nand lean, that they can hardly creep along, and the flelh at that time changes\nits colour. The moft of them, therefore, are obliged to continue in the flat\nparts of the country till they recover, making holes in the earth, which they\ncover at the mouth with leaves and dirt, fo that no air may enter. There\nthey throw off their old {hells, which they leave, as ft were, quite whole > the\nplace where they opened on the belly being unfeen. At that time they are quite\nnaked, and almoft without motion for fix days together, when they become\nfo fat as to be -delicious food. They have then under their ftomachs four\nlarge white {tones, which gradually decreafe in proportion as the fhell hardens,,\nand, when they come to perfection, are not to be found. It is at that time\nthat the animal is feen flowly making its way back ; and all this is moft com-\nmonly performed in the fpace of fix weeks.---This animal, when poflefied of\nits retreats in the mountains, is impregnable; for only fubfifting on vegetables,\nit feldom ventures out ; and its habitation being in the moft inaccefiible places,\nit remains for a great part of the feafon in perfeCt fecurity. It is only when\nimpelled by the defire of bringing forth its young, and when compelled to\ndefcend into the flat country, that it is taken. At that time the natives wait\nfor its delcent in eager expectation, and deftroy thoufands ; but difregarding\ntheir bodies, they only feek for that fmall fpawn which lies on each fide of\nthe ftomach v\/ithin the fhell, of about the thicknefs of a man\u2019s thumb. They\nare much more valuable upon their return after they have caft their Ihell ;\nfor, being covered with a fkin refembling foft parchment, almoft every part\nexcept the ftomach may be eaten. They are taken in the holes by feeling\nfor them with an inftrument; they are fought after by night, when on their\njourney,, by flambeaux. The inftant the animal perceives itfelf attacked, it\nthrows itfelf on its back, and with its claws pinches moft terribly whatever it\nhappens to faften on. But the dexterous crab-catcher takes them by the hind-\ner legs in fuch a manner that the nippers cannot touch him, and thus he\nthrows them into his bag. Sometimes alfo they are caught when they take\nrefuge in the bottoms of holes in rocks by the fea-fide, by clapping a flick to\nthe mouth of the hole, which prevents their getting out; and then foon after,\nthe tide coming, enters the hole, and the animal is found, upon its retiring,\ndrowned in its retreat.-\u2014 Thefe crabs are of various fizes, the largeft about\nfix inches wide; they walk fide-ways like the fea-crab, and are fhaped like\nthem : fome are black, fome yellow, fome red, and others variegated with red,\nwhite, and yellow, mixed. Some of thefe are poifonous ; and feveraL people\nhave died of eating of the crabs, particularly of the black kind. The lights\ncoloured\n\fA KEY TO PHYSIC\n312\n-coloured are reckoned heft; and when full in flefh, are very well tailed. Io.\nfome of the fugar iflands they are eaten without danger; and are no fmall help\nto the negro flaves, who, on many of thefe iflands, would fare very hard\nwithout them.\nOf S C E N T.\nNOTHING more eminently demonftrates the dodtrine of atoms, than [cent. It\nis an effluvium continually arifing from the corpufcles that iflue out of all bo-\ndies ;\nand being impregnated with the peculiar date and quality of the blood\nand juices of that particular animal from which they flow, occafions the vaft\nvariety of fmells or fcents cognizable by the olfadlory nerves, or organs of\nfmelling. Hence the reafo-n why one perfon differs from another in fcent, and\nwhy a dog will trace the footfteps of his mafter for an hundred miles together,\nfollow him into any houfe, church, or other building, and diftinguifh him from\nevery other perfon, though furrounded by ten thoufand. And when the faith-\nful animal has thus diligently fought out and recognized his mafter, he is\nfeldom willing even to truft the evidence of his own eyes, until, with eredted\ncreft, he has taken a few cordial fniffs, to convince himfelf he is right. Hence\nalfo we perceive how a pack of hounds are enabled to purfue the hare, fox,\nflag, or any other animal they are trained to hunt, acrofs the fcent, and amidft\nthe fociety of others of the fame fpecies, without being diverted from the pur-\nsuit of that felf-fame animal they had firfi on foot. And hence too we dif-\ncover how it is poffible for birds and beafts of prey to be directed to their\nfood at fuch vaft diftances ; for thefe corpufcles, ifluing from putrid bodies,\nand floating in the air, are carried by the wind to different quarters ; where\nftriking the olfadlory nerves of whatever animals they meet in their way*, immediately\ncondudt them to the fpot. It matters not how much the effluvia may be gone\noff, fo as enough remains to irritate the olfadlory organ; for whether it be\nbird or beaft, they try the fcent in all directions, till at length they difcover\nthat which is ftronger and ftronger in proportion as they proceed, and this na-\nture has taught them to know is the diredl and obvious road to their prey,\nand prevents them from following the contrary courfe, which is naturally weak-\ner and weaker, and what in hunting is termed heel. This obfervation is con-\nfirmed by the encrealed eagernefs we perceive in all animals, the nearer they\napproach the objedt of purfuit ; as we fee hounds and fpaniels in hunting and\n* It is by this means the fmall-pox, mealies, putrid fevers, and all epidemic complaints are communicated,\nand the plague andpeftilence conveyed from one place to another.\ni fhooting.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 1J 3\nfhooting, are the more earned, in proportion as the fcent is recent, and as\nthey draw nearer to the game. The fame thing, amongft quadrupeds, whether\nwild or domeftic, diredts the male to the female that is in feafon for love \u2022,\nand hence we fee the dog, the boar, the bull, and the ftallion, when turned\nloofe, apply their noftrils to the ambient air, and proceed accordingly. By the\nfame medium the vermin which infeft our dwellings, know how to diredt\ntheir operations, whether to undermine walls, eat through folid boards, crofs\nrivers, or climb fpouts ;\nwhich lhews how much ftronger the faculty of fmel-\nling is poffeffed by the brute fpecies, than by the human ; wifely ordained by\nnature, to enable them to feek their food, and propagate their fpecies, but\nfor which they would often perilh, or have long fince became extindl.\nThere are wonderful inftances of fome animal carcafes, which, though flaked\nwith lime, and buried ten feet under ground, have fent forth fo ftrong a fcent, as\nto have attradled dogs to the fpot, that eagerly endeavoured to dig away the\nearth to get at them. And an infcance happened only a few years fince at\nPetersfield in Hampfhire, where an unfortunate female, having privately deli-\nvered herfelf of two children, went and buried them in a deep hole in an adjoin-\ning field ; but within three days fome dogs were attradled to the fpot by the fcent,\ndug them up, and partly devoured them, before the fhocking circumflance was\ndifcovered. No wonder then a pack of hounds, which have caught the fcent\nof a polecat or weaftl, will purfue them into the thickefb foreft, and afiemble\nround the very tree up the trunk of which they have run for fhelter \u2022, or that blood-\nhounds, as in times of old, fhould trace out fugitives and robbers in fub-\nterraneous caverns, in trees, caves, or forefts, or in clefts of inacceflible rocks,\nof which inftances are given by the moft reputable hiftorians. It is however\nto be remarked, that as all animals hunt for and purfue their prey by its fcent,\nfo they feem inftindtively to know that they themfelves are hunted and purfued\nby means of the fcent ififuing from their own bodies ; but as this fubject admits\nof much curious and occult fpeculation, I fhail give a few inftances of the effedts\nof fcent upon different animals, and the fenfe and fagacity they difplay in\nthe management of it.\u2014 And firft, of the hare.\nThe hare is naturally a timid animal, but emanates a very ftrong fcent. He\nfleeps in his form or feat during the day \u2022, and feeds, copulates, &c. in the night.\nIn a moon-light evening, a number of them are fometimes feen fporting together,\nleaping and purfuing each other : but the lead motion, the falling of a leaf, alarms\nthem-, and then they all run off feparately, each taking a different route. They\nare extremely fwift in their motion, which is a kind of gallop, or a fuccefiion of\nquick leaps. When purfued, they always take to the higher grounds : as their,\nNoi 8. G g fore-\n\f1 14 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfore-feet are much fhorter than the hind ones, they run with more eafe up-hill than\ndown-hill, The hare is endowed with all thofe inftindts which are neceffary for his\nown prefervation. In winter he choofes a form expofed to the fouth, and in fum-\nmer to the north ; and has a thoufand contrivances to elude the vigilance of his\npurfuers, and to cut off his fcent from the hounds. If it be rainy, the hare ufually\ntakes to the highways ; and if fhe come to the fide of a young grove, or fpring,\nflie feldom enters, but fquats down till the hounds have over-fhot her ; and then\n(lie will return the very way fhe came, for fear of the wet and dew that hangs on\nthe boughs.\u2014 -When file comes near brook-fides, and plafhes, fhe will make all\nher crofiings, doublings, and works. Some hares have been fo crafty, that as foon as\n*\nthey have heard the found of a horn, they would inftantly ftart out of their form,\nthough it was at the diftance of a quarter of a mde, and go and fwim in fome pool,\nand reft upon fome rufii-bed in the midfi of it : and would not ftir from thence till\nthey have heard the found of the horn again, and then have flarted out, fwim-\nming to land, and have flood up before the hounds four hours before they could\nkill them, fwimming and ufing all fubtilties and croffings in the water. Nay,\nfuch is the natural craft and fubdlty of the hare, that fometimes after fhe has been\nhunted three hours, flie will drive up a frefb hare, and fquat in the fame form her-\nfclf. Others having been hunted a confiderable time, will creep under the door\nof a fiieep-cot, and hide themfelves among the fheep ; or, when they have been\nhard hunted, will run in among a flock of fheep, and will by no means be gotten\nout from among them till the hounds are coupled up, and the fheep driven into\ntheir pens. Some of them will take the ground like a rabbit, and run up a wall,\nand hide in the grafs on the top of it. Some hares will go up one fide of the hedge\nand come down the other, the thicknefs of the hedge being the only diftance be-\ntween the courfes. A hare that has been forely hunted, has got upon a quickfet-\nhedge, and ran a good way upon the top thereof, and then leapt off upon the\nground. And they will frequently betake themfelves to furze bufhes, and will\nleap from one to the other, to cut off the fcent, whereby the hounds are frequent-\nly in default.\u2014In the fpring time or fummer, a hare will not fit in bufhes, be-\ncaule they are frequently infefted with pifmires, fnakes, and adders j but will fit\nin corn-fields, and open places. In the winter-time, they fit near towns and vil-\nlages, in tufts of thorns and brambles, efpecially when the wind is northerly or\nfoutherly.\u2014It is remarkable that the hare, although ever fo frequently purfued by\nthe dogs, feldom leaves the place where fhe was brought forth, or even the form\nin which fhe ufually fits. It is common to find them in the fame place next day,\nafter being long and keenly chaced the day before. The females are more grofs\nthan the males, and have lefs ftrength and agility *, they are likewife more timid,\nand\n\fH5\nand occult science.\nand never allow the dogs to approach fo near their form before riling, as the males.\nThey likewife pradlife more arts, and double more frequently than the males.\u2014\nThe hare is diffufed almoft over every climate ; and, notwithftanding they are\nevery where hunted, their fpecies never diminifhes. They are in a condition of\npropagating the firft year of their lives ; the females go with young about thirty\ndays, and produce four or five at a time ; and as foon as they have brought forth,\nthey again admit the embraces of the male \u2022, fo that they may be faid to be always\npregnant. The eyes of the young are open at birth \u2022, the mother fuckles them\nabout twenty days, after which they feparate from her, and procure their own food.\nThe young never go far from the place where they were brought forth ; but ftill\nthey live folitary, and make forms about thirty paces diftant from each other:\nthus, if a young hare be found any where, you may almoft be certain of finding\nfeveral others within a very fmall diftance.\nThe fecundity of the rabbit is ftill greater than that of the hare. They will\nbreed feven times in the year, and the female fometimes brings eight young ones at\na time. Suppofing this to happen regularly for four years, the number of rabbits\nfrom a fingle pair will amount to one million, two hundred feventy-four thoufand,\neight hundred and forty.\u2014 They are in a condition for generating when fix months\nold ; and, like the hare, the female is almoft conftantly in feafon ; fhe goes with\nyoung about thirty days, and brings forth from four to eight at a litter. A few\ndays before littering, (lie digs a hole in the earth, not in a ftraight line, but in a\nzig-zag form : the bottom of this hole fire enlarges every way, and then pulls off\na great quantity of hair from her belly, of which fhe makes a kind of bed for her\nyoung. During the two firft days after birth, fhe never leaves them, but when\nprelfed with hunger, and then fhe eats quickly and returns j\nand in this manner\nfhe fuckles and attends her young for fix weeks. All this time both the hole and\nthe young are concealed from the male ; fometimes, when the female goes out,\nflae, in order to deceive the male, fills up the mouth of the hole with earth mixed\nwith her own urine. But when the young ones begin to come to the mouth of the\nhole, and to eat fuch herbs as the mother brings to them, the father feems to know\nthem ; he takes them betwixt his paws, fmooths their hair, and careffes them with\ngreat fondnefs.\nThe fox is efteemed to be the moft fagacious and mod crafty of all beafts of\nprey. The former quality he fhews in his method of providing himielf with\nan afylum, where he retires from prefting dangers, where he dwells, and where\nhe brings up his young : and his craftinefs is chiefly difcovered by the fchemes\nhe falls upon in order to catch lambs, geefe, hens, and all kinds of fmall birds.\nThe fox fixes his abode on the border of a wood, in the neighbourhood of ou-\ntages :\n\fA KEY TO PHYSIC\n1 1\ntages : he liftens to the crowing of the cock, and the cries of the poultry. He\nfcents them at a diflance ; he choofes his time with judgment; he conceals\nhis road as well as his defign ; he flips forward with caution, fometimes even\ntrailing his body, and feldom makes a fruitlefs expedition. In this manner\nhe has been feen, on a moon-light night, enter a pafture where feveral hares\nwere feeding, when lying down, and taking his tail in his mouth, has trailed\nalong like a rolling ftone, unfufpefted by his prey, till he had got too near for\nthem all to efcape. If he can leap the wall, or get in underneath, he ravages\nthe court-ya,rd, puts all to death, and then retires foftly with his prey, which he\neither hides under the herbage, or carries off to his kennel. He returns in a few\nminutes for another, which he carries off, or conceals in the fame manner, but\nin a different place. In this way he proceeds till the progrefs of the fun, or fome\nmovements perceived in the houfe, advertife him that it is time to fufpend his\noperations, and to retire to his den. He plays the fame game with the catchers of\nthrufhes, wood-cocks, &c. He vifits the nets and bird-lime very early in the\nmorning, carries off fucceffively the birds which are entangled, and lays them in\ndifferent places, efpecially near the fides of highways, in the furrows, under the\nherbage or brufhwood, where they fometimes lie two or three days ; but he knows\nperfedlly where to find them when he is in need. He hunts the young hares in the\nplains, feizes old ones in their feats, never mifies thofe which are wounded, digs\nout the rabbits in the warrens, difcovers the nefts of partridges and quails, feizes\nthe mothers on the eggs, and deftroys a vaft quantity of game. The fox is ex-\nceedingly voracious ; befides flefh of all kinds, he eats, with equal avidity, eggs,\nmilk, cheefe, fruits, and particularly grapes. When the young hares and par-\ntridges fail him, he makes war againft rats, field-mice, ferpents, lizards, toads,\n&c. pf thele he deftroys vaft numbers ; and this is the only fervice he does to\nmankind. He is fo fond of honey, that he attacks the wild bees, wafps, and hor-\nnets. They at firft put him to flight by a thoufand flings ; but he retires only for\nthe purpofe of rolling himfelf on the ground, to crufli them ; and he returns fo\noften to the charge, that he obliges them to abandon the hive, which he foon un-\ncoyers, and devours both the honey and wax. In a word, he eats fifhes, lobfters,\ngrafs-hoppers, &c.-~ Foxes produce but once a year ; and the litter commonly con-\nfifts of four or five, feldom fix, and never lefs than three. When the female is full,\nfhe retires, and feldom goes out of her hole, where fhe prepares a bed for her\nyoung. When fhe perceives that her retreat is difcovered, and that her young have\nbeen difturbed, fhe carries them off one by one, and goes in fearch of another ha-\nbitation. The fox, as well as the congenerous wolf, will produce with the dog\nkind, as noticed before.-\u2014 The fox fleeps found, and may be eafily approached\nwithout awakening : he fleeps in a round form, like the dog ; but when he only\nrepofes\n\/\n\fii7\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nrepofes himfelf, he extends his hind legs, and lies on his belly. It is in this fitua-\ntion that he fpies the birds along the hedges, and meditates {cherries for their fur-\nprife. The fox flies when he hears the explofion of a gun, or fmells gun-powder.\nBeing exceedingly fond of grapes, he does much mifchief in vineyards. --When\npurfued by the hounds, he feldom fails to deceive and fatigue them, becaufe he\npurpofely paffes through the thickeft parts of the foreft or places of the mod diffi-\ncult accefs, where the dogs are hardly able to follow him ; and, when he takes to\nthe plains, he runs ftraight out, without {topping or doubling.\u2014It is a great ad-\nmirer of its bufliy tail, with which it frequently amufes and exercifes itfelf, by run-\nning in circles to catch it : and, in cold weather, wraps it round its nofe. The\nfmell of this animal is in general very ftrong, but that of the urine is remarkably\nfetid. This feems fo offenfive even to itfelf, that it will take the trouble of dig-\nging a hole in the ground, ftretching its body at full length over it ;\nand there,\nafter depoliting its water, covers it over with the earth, as the cat does its dung.\nThe fmell is fo obnoxious, that it has often proved the means of the fox\u2019s efcape\nfrom the dogs; who have fo ftrong an averflon at the filthy effluvia, as to avoid\nencountering the animal it came from. It is faid the fox makes ufe of its urine as\nan expedient to force the cleanly badger from its habitation : whether that is the\nmeans, is rather doubtful ; but that the fox makes ufe of the badger\u2019s hole is cer-\ntain ; not through want of ability to form its own retreat, but to fave itfelf fome\ntrouble ;\nfor after the expulfion of the firft inhabitant, the fox improves as well as\nenlarges it confiderably, adding feveral chambers, and providently making feveral\nentrances to fecure a retreat from every quarter. In warm weather, it will quit its\nhabitation for the fake of balking in the fun, or to enjoy the free air * but then it\nrarely lies expofed, but choofes fome thick brake, that it may reft fecure from\nfurprize. Crows, magpies, and other birds, who confider the fox as their com-\nmon enemy, will often, by their notes of anger, point out his retreat.\nThe ftag or buck is the mod crafty of all the fpecies of deer. He conceals him-\nfelf with great addrefs, is mod difficult to trace, and derives fuperior relources from\ninftinft: for though he has the misfortune to leave behind him a ftrong lcent,\nwhich redoubles the ardour and appetite of the hounds, he knows how to withdraw\nhimfelf from their purfuit, by the rapidity with which he begins his flight, and by\nhis numerous doublings. He delays not his arts of defence till his ftrength fails\nhim *, but, as foon as he finds that the firft efforts of a rapid chace have been un=\nfuccefsful, he repeatedly returns on his former fteps; and after confounding, by\nthefe oppofite movements, the direction he has taken, after intermixing the pre-\nsent with the paft fcent from his body, he rifes from the earth by a great bound,\nand, retiring to a fide, he lies down flat on his belly, and in this immoveable\nNo. 8. H h fituation,\n\fii8 A K E Y T O P H Y S I C,\ni\nfituation, he allows the whole troop of his deceived enemies to pafs very near him.\nHis laft refuge when forely hunted, is the foil, keeping the middle, fearing,\nleft by touching a bough, or a fhrub, he may give greater fcent to the hounds.\nHe always fwims againft the ftream, and will often cover himfelf under water, fo\nas to fhew nothing but his nofe. Where opportunity of water fails, he will fly\ninto herds of cattle, as cows, fheep, &c. and will fometimes leap on an ox, cow,\nor the like, that he may leave no fcent on the ground. What is (till more re-\nmarkable, it is related by the principal huntfman of Louis XII. that a buck Which\nthey had hunted for a long time, and being at laft hard prefled, leaped into the\nmiddle of a very large white-thorn, in order to cut off its fcent ; and there flood\naloft till he was run through by the huntfman, rather than ftir from the place, to\nbe worried by the dogs.\u2014Their feafon of love commences about the end of Auguft\nor beginning of September, when they leave the coppice, return to the forefts, and\nfearch for the hinds. They cry with a loud voice; their neck and throat fwell;\nthey become perfectly reftlefs, and traverfe in open day the fields and the fallow\ngrounds ; they ftrike their horns againft the trees and hedges ; in a word, they feem\nto be tranfported with fury, and run from country to country, till they find the hinds\nor females, whom they purfue and compel into compliance; for the female at firfl\navoids and flies from the male, and never fubmits to his embraces till fhe be fatigued\nwith the purfuit. The old hinds likewife come in feafon before the younger ones.\nWhen two bucks approach the fame hind, they muft fight before they enjoy. If\nnearly equal in ftrength, they threaten, paw the ground, fet up terrible cries, and\nattack each other with fuch fury, that they often inflidt mortal wounds with the\nftrokes of their horns. The combat never terminates but in the defeat or flight of\none of the rivals. The conqueror lofes not a moment in enjoying his vidtory, unlefs\nanother rival approaches, whom he is again obliged to attack and repel. The oldeft\nflags are always mafters of the field ; becaufe they are ftronger and more furious\nthan the young ones, who muft wait patiently till their fuperiors tire, and quit their\nmiftrefles. Sometimes, however, the young flags accomplifh their purpofes while\nthe old ones are fighting, and, after a hafty gratification, fly off. The hinds prefer\nthe old flags, not becaufe they are moft courageous, but becaufe they are much\nmore ardent. It has been alledged, that, attradled by the fcent of the hinds, the\nflags, in the rutting feafon, throw themfelves into the fea, and pafs from one ifland\nto another at thediftance of feveral leagues. They leap ftill more nimbly than they\nl'wim ;\nfor, when purfued, they eafily clear a hedge or a pale fence of fix or feven\nfeet high, and on all prefling occafions fhew aftonifhing fenfe and fagacity.\nThefenfesofthewolf are likewife excellent, particularly his fenfe of fmelling, which\noften extends farther than his eye. The odour of carrion ftrikes him at the diftance\n2 of\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE, ,, 9\nof more than a league. He likewife fcents live animals very far, and hunts them\na long time by following their track. When he i flues from the wood, he never lofes\nthe wind. He flops on the borders of the foreft, fmells on all fides, and receives\nthe corpufcles of living or dead animals brought to him from a diftance by the\nwind. Though he prefers living to dead animals, yet he devours the mod putrid\ncarcafes. He is fond of human flefh ; and, if ftronger, he would perhaps eat no\nother. Wolves have been known to follow armies, and to come in troops to the\nfield of battle, where bodies are carelefsly interred, to tear them up, and to devour\nthem with an infatiable avidity : and, when once accuftomed to human flefh, they\never after attack men, prefer the fhepherd to the flock, devour women, and carry\noff children. The wolf, unlike the dog, is an enemy to all fociety, and keeps no\ncompany even with thofe of his own fpecies. When feveral wolves unite together, it\nis not a fociety of peace, but of war ; it is attended with tumult and dreadful howl-\nings, and indicates an attack upon fome large animal, as a flag, an ox, or a for-\nmidable maftiff. This military expedition is no fooner finifhed, than they feparate,\nand each returns in filence to his folitude. There is even little intercourfe between\nthe males and females : they feel the mutual attractions of love but once a-year, and\nnever remain long together. The females come in feafon in winter: many males\nfollow the fame female-, and this afloeiation is more bloody than the former; for\nthey growl, chace, fight, and tear, one another, and often facrifice him that is prefer-\nred by the female. The female commonly flies a long time, fatigues her admirers,\nand retires, while they fleep, with the moft alert or moft favourite male. The wolves\ncopulate like dogs,, and have an ofleous penis, furrounded with a ring, which fwells\nand hinders them from feparating. When the females are about to bring forth, they\nfearchfor a concealed place in the inmoft recefies of the foreft. The puppies come\ninto the world blind, like the dogs -, the mother fuckles them fome weeks, and foon\nlearns them to eat flelh, which fhe prepares for them by tearing it into fmall pieces.\nSome time after fhe brings them field-mice, young hares, partridges, and living\nfowls. The young wolyes begin by playing with thefe animals, and at laft worry\nthem -, then the mother pulls off the feathers, tears them in pieces, and gives a part\nto each of her young. They never leave their den till the end of fix weeks or two\nmonths. They then follow their mother, who leads them to drink in the hollow\ntrunk of a tree, or in fome neighbouring pool. She conduces them back to the den,\nor, when any danger is apprehended, obliges them to conceal themfelves elfewhere.\nThough, like other females, the fhe-wolf is naturally more timid than the male,\nyet, when her young are attacked, fhe defends them with intrepidity; fhe lofes all\nfenfe of danger, and becomes perfectly furious. She never leaves them till their\neducation is finifhed, till they are fo ftrong as to need no afllftance or protection,\nand\n\f120 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nand have acquired talents fit for rapine. The wolf has great ftrength, efpecially in\nthe anterior parts of the body, in the mufcles of the neck, and jaws. He carries a\nfheep in his mouth, and, at the fame time, outruns the fhepherds; fo that he can\nonly be (topped or deprived of his prey by dogs. His bite is cruel, and always\nmore obftinate in proportion to the fmailnefs of the refiftance ; for, when an animal\ncan defend itfelf, he is cautious and circumfpedf. He never fights but frotfn necef-\niity, and nor from motives of courage. When wounded with a ball, he cries *, and\nyet, when difpatching him with bludgeons, he complains not. When he falls into\na fnare, he is fo overcome with terror, that he may be either killed or taken alive\nwithout refiftance: he allows himfelf to be chained, muzzled, and led where you\npleafe, without exhibiting the lead fymptom of refentment or difcontent. Wolves\nare how fo rare in the populated parts of America, that the inhabitants leave their\nfheep the whole night unguarded :\nyet the governments of Penfylvania and New\nJerfey did fome years ago allow a reward of twenty (hillings, and the laft even thirty\n('hillings, for the killing of every wolf. Tradition informed them what a fcourge\nthofe animals had been to the colonies ;\nfo they wifely determined to prevent the like\nevil. In their infant ftate, wolves came down in multitudes from the mountains,\noften attracted by the fmell of the corpfes of hundreds of Indians who died of the\nfmall-pox, brought among them by the Europeans : but the animals did not con-\nfine their infults to the dead, but even devoured in their huts the fick and dying\niavages.\u2014Britain, a few centuries ago, was much infefted by them. It was, as ap-\npears by Hollingfhead, very noxious to the flocks in Scotland in 1577; nor was it\nentirely extirpated till about 1680, when the laft wolf fell by the hands of the famous\nSir Ewen Cameron. Edward I. iflued out his royal mandate to Peter Corbet to fu-\nperintend and aflift in the deftruftion of them in the feveral counties of Gloucefter,\nWorcefter, Hereford, Salop, and Stafford; and in the adjacent county of Derby,\ncertain peribns at Wormhill held their lands by the duty of hunting and taking\nthe wolves that infefted the country, whence they were (filed wolve-hunt. To\nlook back into the Saxon times, we find, that in Athelftan\u2019s reign, wolves abound-\ned fo in Yorkftiire, that a retreat was built at Flixton in that county, \u201c to defend\npafiengers from the wolves, that they (hould not be devoured by them and fuch\nravages did thefe animals make during winter, particularly in January, when the\ncold was fevered, that the Saxons diftinguifhed that month by the name of the\nwolf-month. At the Cape of Good Hope, there is a fpecies called the tiger-wolf,\nwhich is actually poflefied of the peculiar gift of being enabled, in fome meafure,\nto imitate the cries of other animals ; by which means this arch deceiver is fome-\ntimes lucky enough to beguile and attradf calves, foals, lambs, and other animals.\nNear fome of the larger farms, where there is a great deal of cattle, this ravenous\nbeaft\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 12 I\nbeaft is to be found almoft every night; and at the fame time frequently from one\nhour to another betraying itfelf by its howlings, gives the dogs the alarm. In this\ncafe the cunning of the wolves is fo great, that a party of them, half flying and half\ndefending themfelves, will decoy the whole pack of dogs to follow them to the dif-\ntance of a gun-fhot or more from the farm, with a view to give an opportunity to the\nreft of the wolves to come out from their ambufcade, and, without meeting with\nthe leaft refiftance, carry off booty fufficient for themfelves and their fugitive bre-\nthren. The tiger-wolf, though a much larger and ftronger animal, does not ven-\nture, without being driven to the utmoft neceflity, to meafure its ftrength with the\ncommon dog, which is certainly an evident proof of its cowardice. Notwithftand-\ning this, the Hottentots inform us, that it is ftill within the memory of man, that\nthe tiger-wolf was bold enough to fteal upon them and moleft them in their huts,\nparticularly by carrying off their children. This, however, is now no longer the\ncafe; a circumftance, perhaps, proceeding from the introduction of fire-arms into\nthe country, an invention which, in thefe latter times, has caufed this, as well\nas other wild beafts, to ftand in greater awe of man than it did formerly. I have\nheard the following ftory of the tiger-wolf mentioned, which is laughable enough,\nthough perhaps not quite fo probable :\n\u201c At a feaft near the Cape one night, a trum-\npeter who had got his fill was carried out of doors, in order that he might cool him-\nfelf, and get fober again. The fcent of him foon drew thither a tiger-wolf, which\nthrew him on his back, and dragged him along as a corpfe, up towards Table-\nmountain. During this, however, the drunken nuifician waked, enough in his\nfenfes to know the danger of his fituation, and to found the alarm with his trum-\npet, which he carried faftened to his fide. The wild beaft, as may eafily be fuppof-\ned, was not lefs frightened in his turn.\u201d Any other befides a trumpeter would in\nfuch circumftances, have undoubtedly been no better than wolf\u2019s meat.\nThe jackal appears to have the gift of fcenc equal to a dog, of which it feems to\nbe a wild fpecies. They go in packs of forty, fifty, and even two hundred, and hunt\nlike hounds in full cry from evening to morning. They deftroy flocks and poultry,\nbut in a lefs degree than the wolf or fox : ravage the ftreets of villages and gardens\nnear towns, and will even deftroy children, if left unprotected. They will enter\nftables and outhoufes, and devour fkins, or any thing made of that material. They\nwill familiarly enter a tent, and fteal whatfoever they find from the fleeping traveller.\nIn default of living prey, they will feed on roots and fruits ; and even on the moft\ninfected carrion : the-y will greedily difinter the dead, and devour putrid carcafes.\nThey attend caravans, and follow armies, in hopes that death will provide them a\nbanquet. Their voice naturally is a howl. Barking, Mr. Pennant obferves, is la-\ntently inherent ;\nand in their ftate of nature feldom exerted : but its different modi-\nNo. 8.

Dellon fays, their voice is\nlike the cries of a great many children of different ages mixed together :_w hen one\nbegins to howl the whole pack join in the cry. This animal is vulgarly called the\nLion\u2019s Provider, from an opinion that it rouzes the prey for that quadruped. The\nfad is, every creature in the fored is fee in motion by the fearful cries of the jackals\nthe lion, and other beads of rapine, by a fort of inflind, attend to the chace, and\nlie in wait, to feize fuch timid animals as betake themfelves to flight at the noife\nof this nightly pack.\nFrom what has been dated, as well as from the contemplation of nature in general,\nit will appear, that there is an occult indindive principle infufed into the whole race\nof animal beings, whereby they are unerringly led on to the propagation and pre-\nJervation of their fpecie9 j yet fo as that no one {hall become too numerous for the\nexidence of another, upon which they prey, or with which they live in a conti-\nnual date of warfare. We may likewife remark, that the more fimilarity we did\ncover among brutes, the more amicable we find them towards each other, becaufe\nthe corpufcles of their bodies have an agreement pleafing to their fenfitive faculty,\nwithout exciting the appetite ; but for which the fame fpecies would inceflant-\nly devour each other, and the purpofes of creation would be annihilated by the\noperation of its own works. Contrary however to fuch a violation of order, we\nfind the beads of the fored, and brute animals in general, prey by antipathy upon\nthofe which are oppofite or inimical in feent and fpecies to themfelves ; and affociate\nby fympathy with thofe of fimilar and concordant qualities ; but the mod powerful\neffed of fympathy is to be found between the male and female of one and the fame\nclafs of beings *, as we lhall demondrate more fatisfadorily and pleafingly, in our\ncondderations\nOf MAN.\nM A N is placed at the head of the animal creation, and is a being who feels,\nrefleds, thinks, contrives, and ads ; who has power of changing his place upon\nthe earth at pleafure \u2022, who poiTefles the faculty of communicating his thoughts by\nmeans of fpeech ; and who has dominion over all other creatures on the face of the\nglobe.

The firft is the ftrength of the mufcles of the\nlegs, by which the body is fuppcrted in a vertical pofition above them ;\nthe fecond\nconfifts in the articulation of the head with the neck by the middle of its bafe. We\nftand upright, bend our body, and walk, without thinking on the power by which\nwe\n\f,28 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nwe are fupported in thefe feveral pofitions. This power refides chiefly in the\nmufcles which conftitute the principal part of the calf of the leg. Their exertion\nis felt, and their motion is viflble externally when we Hand upright and bend our\nbody backwards and forwards. This power is no lei's great when we walk even on\nan horizontal plane. In afcending a height, the weight of the body is more fenfi-\nbly felt than in defending. All thefe motions are natural to man. Other animals,\non the contrary, when placed on their hind legs, are either incapable of performing\nthem at all, or do it partially, with great difficulty, and for a very Ihort time. The\ngibbon,\nand thzjocko or curang-outang,\nare the animals moft refembling man in their\nconftrudtion : they can (land upright with much lefs difficulty than other brutes\n;\nbut the reftraint they are under in this attitude plainly ffievvs that it is not natural to\nthem. The real'on is, that the mufcles in the back part of the leg in the gibbon\nand the jocko are not, as in man, fufficiently large to form a calf, and confequently\nnot fufficiently ftrong to fupport the thighs and body in a vertical line, and to\npreferve them in that pofture.\u2014 The attitudes proper to man, and to the animals,\nare pointed out by the different manners in which the head is articulated with the\nneck. The two points, by which the offeous part of the head is conne&ed with the\nfirft vertebra of the neck, and on which every movement of the head is made with\nthe greateft facility, are placed at the edge of the great foramen of the occipital bone,\nwhich in man is fituated near the centre of the bafe of the cranium, affords a paffage\nfor the medullary fubffance into the vertebras, and determines the place of the ar-\nticulation of the head with the neck. The body and neck being, according to the\nnatural attitude, in a vertical direction, the head muff be placed in equilibrium\nupon the vertebrae as upon a pivot or point of fupport. The face is on a vertical\nline, almoft parallel to that of the body and neck. The jaws, which are very ffiort\ncompared with thofe of moft other animals, extend very little farther forwards than\nthe forehead.\u2014 -No animal has, like man, its hind legs as long as the body, neck,\nand head, taken together, meafuring from the top of the head to the os pubis.\n\u2014\nIn the frame of the human body the principal parts are nearly the fame with thofe\nof other animals ; but in the connection and form of the bones, there is as great a\ndifference as in the attitudes proper to each. Were a man to affume the natural\npofture of quadrupeds, and try to walk by the help of his hands and feet, he would\nfind himfelf in a very unnatural fituation ; he could not move his feet and head\nbut with the greateft difficulty and pain; and, let him make what exertions he\npleafed, he would find it impoflible to attain a fteady and continued pace. The\nprincipal obftacles he would meet with would arife from the ftru&ure of the pelvis,\n*\nthe hands, the feet, and the head.-\u2014The plane of the great occipital foramen,\nwhich in man is almoft horizontal, puts the head in a kind of equilibrium upon\nthe\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE, 129\nthe neck when we Hand ereft in our natural attitude; but, when we are in the\nattitude of quadrupeds, it prevents us from raifing our headfo as to look forwards,\nbecaufe the movement of the head is Hopped by the protuberance of the occiput,\nwhich then approaches too near the vertebrae of the neck.\u2014In mod animals, the\nforamen magnum of the occipital bone is fituated at the back part of the head ; the\njaws are very long ;\nthe occiput has no protuberance beyond the aperture, the\nplane of which is in a vertical direflion, or inclined a little forwards or backwards ;\nfo that the head is pendant, and joined to the neck by its pofferior part. This po-\nfition of the head enables quadrupeds, though their bodies are in a horizontal di-\nrection, to prefent their muzzle forwards, and to raiie it fo as to reach above them,\nor to touch the earth with the extremity of their jaws when they bring their neck\nand head down to their feet. In the attitude of quadrupeds, man could touch the\nearth only with the fore part or the top of the head.\u2014When man is Handing, his\nheel reHs upon the earth as well as the other parts of his foot ; when he walks, it is\nthe firH part which touches the ground ; man can Hand on one foot : thefe are pe-\nculiarities in Hru&ure and in the manner of moving which are not to be found in\nother animals. We may therefore conclude that man cannot be ranked in the clafs\nof quadrupeds. We may add, that in man the brain is much larger, and the jaws\nmuch fliorter, than in any other animal. The brain, by its great extent, forms\nthe protuberance of the occipital bone, the forehead, and all that part of the head\nwhich is above the ears. In animals, the brain is fo fmall, that moH of them have\nno occiput, or the front is either wanting or little raifed. In animals which have\nlarge foreheads, fuch as the horfe, the ox, the elephant, &c. they are placed as\nlow, and even lower, than the ears. Thefe animals likewife want the occiput,\nand the top of the head is of very fmall extent. The jaws, which form the greateH\nportion of the muzzle, are large in proportion to the fmallnefs of the brain. The\nlength of the muzzle varies in different animals : in folipede animals it is very\nlong; it is fliort in the ourang-outang; and in man it does not exiH at all. No\nbeard grows on the muzzle : this part is wanting in every animal.\nAnatomiffs have employed much pains in the Hudy of the material part of man,\nand of that organization which determines his place in the animal creation. From\ntracing and combining his different external prrts ; from obferving that his body is\nin fome places covered with hair; that he can walk upon his hands and his feet at\nthe fame time, in the manner of quadrupeds ; that, like certain animals which hold\ntheir food in their paws, he has two clavicles ;\nthat the female brings forth, her\nyoung alive, and that her breaffs are fupplied with milk : from thefe circumffances\nwe might be led to affign man a place in the clafs of viviparous quadrupeds. But,\nin truth, fuch an arrangement would be defective, arbitrary, and abfurd, Man is\nNo. 9. LI not\n\fI\n130 AKEYTOPHYSIC,\nnot a quadruped : of all the animals, he alone can fupport himfelf continually*\nand without reftraint, in an ereCt pofture, (that is, with his head and body in a\nvertical line upon his legs.) In this majeftic and dignified attitude, he can change\nhis place, furvey this earth which he inhabits, and turn his eyes towards the vault\nof heaven. By a noble and eafy gait, he preferves an equilibrium in the feveral\nparts of his body, and tranfports himfelf from one place to another with different\ndegrees of celerity. To man alone nature has denied a covering > but ft ill he is her\nmafterpiece, the laft work which came from the hands of the Almighty Artift, the\nfovereign and the chief of animals, a world in miniature, the centre which connects\nthe univerfe together. The form of his body, the organs whereof are conftruCted\nin fuch a manner as to produce a much greater effeCt than thofe of other animals,\nannounces his power. Every thing demonftrates the excellence of his nature, and\nthe immenfe diftance placed by the bounty of the Creator between man and beaft.\nMan is a reafonable being ; brute animals are deprived of that noble faculty. The\nweakeft and moft ftupid of the human race is able to manage the moft fagacious\nquadruped \u2022, he commands it, and makes it fubfervient to his ufe. The operations\nof brutes are purely the effect of mechanical impulfe, and continue always the fame\n;\nhuman works are varied without end, and infinitely diverfified in the manner of\nexecution. The foul of man is free, independent, and immortal. He is fitted for\nthe ftudy of fcience, and the cultivation of art; he has the exclufive privilege of\nexamining every thing which has exiftence, and of holding communication with\nhis fellow-creatures by language, by particular motions of the body, and by\nmarks and characters mutually agreed upon. Hence arifes that phyfical pre-emi-\nnence which he enjoys over all animals ; and hence that power which he poffeffes\nover the elements, and (fo to fpeak) over nature itfelf. Man, therefore, is une-\nqualled in his kind ; but the individuals thereof differ greatly from one another in\nfigure, ftature, colour, manners, and dilpofitions. The globe which man inha-\nbits is covered with the productions of his induftry and the works of his hands\n:\nit is his labour, in fhort, which gives a value to the whole terreftrial mafs.\nNothing (fays M. Buffon) exhibits fuch a ftriking picture of our weaknefs as\nthe condition of an infant immediately after birth. Incapable of employing its\norgans, it needs afliftance of every kind. In the firft moments of our exiftence,\nwe prefent an image of pain and mifery, and are more weak and helplefs than the\nyoung of any other animal. At birth, the infant paffes from one element to\nanother : when it leaves the gentle warmth of the tranquil fluid by which it was\ncompletely furrounded in the womb of the mother, it becomes expofed to the im-\nprefiions of the air, and inftantly feels the effeCts of that aCtive element. The air\naCting upon the olfaCtory nerves, and upon the organs of refpiration, produces a\nftiock\n\ffhock fomething like fneezing, by which the bread is expanded, and the air ad-\nmitted into the lungs. In the mean time, the agitation of the diaphragm prefles\nupon the vifcera of the abdomen, and the excrements are thus for the fird time\ndifcharged from the inteftines, and the urine from the bladder. The air dilates\nthe veficles of the lungs, and, after being rarefied to a certain degree, is expelled\nby the fpring of the dilated fibres re-a\u00a3ting upon this rarefied fluid. The infant\nnow refpires and articulates founds, or cries.\u2014Moil animals are blind for fome\ndays after birth : infants open their eyes to the light the moment they come into\nthe world \u2022, but they are dull, fixed, and commonly blue. The new-born child\ncannot diftinguifh objects, becaufe he is incapable of fixing his eyes upon them.\nThe organ of vifion is yet imperfect ; the cornea is wrinkled ; and perhaps the\nretina is too foft for receiving the images of external objefts, and for communicating\nthe fenfation of diftindt vifion. At the end of forty days, the infant begins to hear\nand to fmile. About the fame time it begins to look at bright objedts, and fre-\nquently to turn its eyes towards the window, a candle, or any light. Now like-\nwife it begins to weep \u2022, for its former cries and groans were not accompanied with\ntears. Smiles and tears are the effedl of two internal fenfations, both of which de-\npend on the adtion of the mind. Thus they are peculiar to the human race, and\nferve to exprefs mental pain or pleafure j while the cries, motions, and other marks\nof bodily pain and pleafute, are common to man and moft of the other animals.\nConfidering the fubjedt as metaphyficians, we (hall find that pain and pleafure are\nthe univerfal power which lets all our pafiions in motion.\nThe fize of an infant born at the full time is commonly twenty-one inches ; and\nthat fcetusy which nine months before was an imperceptible bubble, now weighs\nten or twelve pounds, and fometimes more. The head is large in proportion to\nthe body, and this dilproportion, which is ftill greater in the fird ftage of the\nfoetus, continues during the period of infancy. The fkin of a new-born child is of\na reddifh colour, becaufe it is fo fine and tranfparent as to allow a flight tint of the\ncolour of the blood to Ihine through. The form of the body and members is by\nno means perfect in a child foon after birth all the parts appear to be fwollen. At\nthe end of three days, a kind of jaundice generally comes on, and at the fame time\nmilk is to be found in the breads of the infant, which may be fqueezed out by the\nfingers. The fwelling decreafes as the child grows up.\nThe liquor contained in the amnios leaves a vifcid whitifh matter upon the body\nof the child. In this country we have the precaution to walk the new- born infant\nonly with warm water-, but it is the cuftom with whole nations inhabiting the\ncolded climates, to plunge their infants into cold water as foon as they are born,\nwithout their receiving the lead injury. It is even faid that the Laplanders leave\ntheir\n\f134 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ntheir children in the fhow till the cold has almoft (lopped their refpiration, and then\nplunge them into a warm bath. Among thefe people, the children are alfo wafhed\nthrice a-day during the firft year of their life. The inhabitants of northern coun-\ntries are perfuaded that the cold bath tends to make men ftronger and more robuft,\nand on that account accuftom their children to the ufe of it from their infancy.\nThe trutii is, that we are totally ignorant of the power of habit, or how far it can\nmake our bodies capable of fuffering, of acquiring, or of lofing.\nThe child is not allowed to fuck as foon as it is born ; but time is given for dif-\ncharging the liquor and (lime from the (lomach, and the mvconium or excrement,\nwhich is of a black colour, from the inteftines. As thefe fubftances might four the\nmilk, a little diluted wine mixed with fugar is firft given to the infant, and the\nbread is not prefented to it before ten or twelve hours have elapfed.\nThe young of quadrupeds can of themfelves find the way to the teat of the mo-\nther: it is not fo with man ; the mother, in order to fuckle her child, muft raife\nit to her breads j and, at this feeble period of life, the infant can exprefs its wants\nonly by its cries.\nNew-born children have need of frequent nourifhment. During the day, the\nbread ought to be given to them every two hours, and during the night as\noften as they awake. At firft they deep almoft continually j and they feem never\nto awake but when prefled by hunger or pain. Sleep is ufeful and refrefhing to\nthem ; and it fometimes becomes necefiary to employ narcotic dofes, proportioned\nto the age and conftitution of the child, for the purpofe of procuring them repofe.\nThe common way of appealing the cries of children is by rocking them in the\ncradle ; but this agitation fhould be very gentle, otherwife a great ri(k is run of con-\nfufing the infant\u2019s brain, and of producing a total derangement. It is necefiary to\ntheir being in good health, that their deep be long and natural. It is pofiible, how-\never, that they may deep too much, and thereby endanger their conftitution. In\nthat cafe, it would be proper to take them out of the cradle, and awaken them by a\ngentle motion, or by prefenting fome bright objeft to their eyes. At this age we\nreceive the firft imprefiions from the fenfes, which, without doubt, are more im-\nportant during the reft of life than is generally imagined. Great care ought to be\ntaken to place the cradle in fuch a manner that the child (hall be direftly oppofite\nto the light : for the eyes are always directed towards that part of the room where\nthe light is ftrongeft : and, if the cradle be placed fideways, one of them, by turn-\ning towards the light, will acquire greater ftrength than the other, and the child\nwill fquint. For the two firft months, no other food (hould be given to the child\nbut the milk of the nurfe; and, when it is of a weak and delicate conftitution, this\nnourifhment alone fhould be continued during the third or fourth month. A child,\nhowever\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 133\nhowever robuft and healthful, may be expofed to great danger and inconvenience,\nif any other aliment is adminiftered before the end of the firft month. In Holland,\nItaly, Turkey, and the whole Levant, the food of children is limited to the milk\nof the nurfe for a whole year. The favages of Canada give their children fuck for\nfour, five, and fometimes even feven, years. In this country, as nurfes generally\nhave not a fufficient quantity of milk to fatisfy the appetite of their children, they\ncommonly fupply the want of it by panada, or other light preparations.\nThe teeth ufually begin to appear about the age of feven months. The cutting\nof thefe, although a natural operation, does not follow the common laws of nature,\nwhich ads continually on the human body without occafioning the fmalleft pain\nor even producing any fenfation. Here a violent and painful effort is made, accom-\npanied with cries and tears. Children at firft lofe their fprightlinefs and gaiety\n;\nthey become fad, reftlefs, and fretful. The gums are red, andfwelled-, but they\nafterwards become white, when the preflure of the teeth is fo great as to ftop the\ncirculation of the blood. Children apply their fingers to their mouth, that they\nmay remove the irritation which they feel there. Some relief is given, by putting\ninto their hands a bit of ivory or of coral, or of fome other hard and fmooth body,\nwith which they rub the gums at the affeded part. This preffure, being oppofed\nto that of the teeth, calms the pain for a moment, contributes to make the mem-\nbrane of the gum thinner, and facilitates its rupture. Nature here ads in oppo-\nfition to herfelfj and an incifion of the gum muft fometimes take place, to allow\na paffage to the tooth.\nWhen children are allowed to cry too long and too often, ruptures are fometimes\noccafioned by the efforts they make. Thefe may eafily be cured by the fpeedy ap-\nplication of bandages*, but, if this remedy has been too long delayed, the difeafe\nmay continue through life. Children are very much fubjed to worms. Some of\nthe bad effeds occafioned by thefe animals might be prevented by giving them a\nlittle wine now and then, for fermented liquors have a tendency to prevent their\ngeneration.\nThough the body is very delicate in the ftate of infancy, it is then lefs fenfible of\ncold than at any other part of life. The internal heat appears to be greater : the\npulfe in children is much greater than in adults j from which we are certainly in-\ntitled to infer, that the internal heat is greater in the fame proportion. For the\nfame reafon, it is evident that fmall animals have more heat than large ones ; for\nthe beating of the heart and of the arteries is always quicker in proportion to the\nfmallnefs of the animal. The ftrokes of the heart in a fparrow fucceed one another\nfo rapidly that they can fcarcely be counted.\nNo. q. M m Till\n\fi 34 A K E Y T O PHYSIC,\nTill three years of age, the life of a child is very precarious. In the two or three\nfollowing years, it becomes more certain \u2022, and at fix or feven years of age, a child\nhas a better chance of -living than at any other period of life. From the bills of\nmortality publifhed at London, it appears, that, of a. certain number of children\nborn at the fame time, one half of them die the three firft years : according to\nwhich, one half of the human race are cut off before they are three years of age.\nBut the mortality among children is not nearly fo great every where as in London.\nM. Dupre de Saint Maur,\nfrom a great number of obfervations made in France, has\nfihewn that half of the children born at the .fame time are not extinft till feven or\neight years have elapfed.\nThe period of infancy is followed by that of adolefcence. This begins, together\nwith puberty, at the age of twelve or fourteen, and commonly ends in girls at fif-\nteen, and in boys at eighteen, but fometimes not till twenty-one, twenty-three,\nand twenty-five, years of age. According to its etymology (being derived from\nthe Latin word cdolefcentia), it is completed when the body has attained its full\nheight. Thus, puberty accompanies adolefcence, and precedes youth. This is\nthe fpring of life; this is the feafon of pleasures, of loves, and of graces: but\nalas ! this finding feafon is of fhort duration. Hitherto nature feems to have had\nnothing in view but the prefervation and increafe of her work: fhe has made no\nprovifion for the infant except what is necefiary to its life and growth. It has lived,\nor rather enjoyed a kind of vegetable exiftence, which was fhut up within itfelf,\nand which it was incapable of communicating. In this firft ftage of life, reafon\nis ftill afieep : but the principles of life foon multiply, and man has not only what\nis neceffary to his own exiftence, but what enables him to give exiftence to others.\nThis redundancy of life, this fource of health and vigour, can no longer be con-\nfined, but endeavours to difi'ufe and expand itfelf.\nThe age of puberty is announced by feveral marks. The firft fymptom is a kind\nof numbnefs and ftifrnefs in the groins, accompanied with a new and peculiar fen-\nfation in thole parts which diftinguifh the fexes. There, as well as in the arm-pits,\nfinal! protuberances of a whitifh colour appear, which are the germ9 of a new pro-\nduction of a kind of hair, by which thefe parts are afterwards to be veiled. The\nvoice, for a confiderable time, is rough and unequal ; after which it becomes ful-\nler, ftronger, and graver, than it was before. This change may eafily be diftin-\nguifhed in boys but lei's fo in girls, becaufe their voices are naturally fharper.\nThefe marks of puberty are common to both fexes : but there are marks peculiar\nto each, fucn as the difeharge of the menfes, and the growth of the breafts, in girls ;\nthe beard, and theemiffion of femen, in boys; in fhort, the feeling of venereal\ndcfire, and the appetite which unites the fexes. Among all races of mankind, the\nfemales\n1\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. {35\nfemales arrive at- puberty fooner than the males ; but the age of puberty is different\nin different nations, and feems partly to depend on the temperature of the climate\nand the quality of the food. In all the fouthern countries of Europe, and in cities,\nthe greateft part of girls arrive at puberty about twelve, and boys about fourteen,\nyears of age. But in the northern parts, and in the country, girls fcarcely arrive\nat puberty till they are fourteen or fifteen, and boys not till they arefixteen or feven-\nteen. In our climate, girls, for the greateft part, have attained complete maturity\nat eighteen, and boys at twenty, years of age.\nAt the age of adolefcence, and of puberty, the body commonly attains its full\nheight. About that time, young people (boot out feveral inches almoft at once.\nBut there is no part of the human body which increafes more quickly and more per-\nceptibly than the organs of generation in both fexes. In males, this growth is no-\nthing but an unfolding of the parts, an augmentation in fize \u2022, but in females, it\nOften occafions a fhrinking and contraction, which have received different names\nfrom thofe who have treated of the fignsof virginity.\nMarriage is a ftate fuitable to man, wherein he muft make ufe of thofe new fa-\nculties which he has acquired by puberty. At this period of life, the defire of pro-\nducing a being like himfelf is ftrongly felt. The external form and the corref-\npondence of the organs of fex occafion without doubt that irrefiftible attraction\nwhich unites the fexes and perpetuates the race. By connecting pleafure with the\npropagation of the fpecies, nature has provided moft effectually for the continu-\nance of her work. Increafe and multiply is the exprefs command of the Creator, and\none of the natural functions of life. We may add, that at the age of puberty a\nthoufand impreffions aCt upon the nervous fyftem, and reduce man to fuch a fitua-\ntion that he feels his exiftence only in that voluptuous fenfe, which then appears to\nbecome the feat of his foul, which engroffes the whole fenfibility of which he is fuf-\nceptible, and which at length proceeds to fuch a height, that its attacks cannot\nlong be fupported without a general derangement of the whole machine. The\ncontinuance of luch a feeling may fometimes indeed prove fatal to thofe who in-\ndulge in exceffive enjoyment \u2022,\nbut it is equally dangerous to thofe who obftinately\nperfift in celibacy, efpecially when ftrongly folicifed by nature. The femen, being\ntoo long confined in the fetninal vefiels, may, by its ftimularit property, occafion\ndifeafes in both fexes, and excite irritations fo violent as to reduce man to a level\nwith the brutes, which, when aCted upon by fuch impreffions, are perfectly furious\nand ungovernable. When this irritation proceeds to extremity, it produces what\nis called the furor literinns in women. The oppofite habit, however, is infinitely\nmore common, efpecially in the temperate, and above all in the frozen, zones.\nAfter all, excefs is much more to be dreaded than continency. The number of\n. dififolute\n\fi$6 A. -KEY TO PHYSIC,\ndiffolute and intemperate men afford ns plenty of examples. Some have loft their\nmemory, fome have been deprived of fight, fome have become bald, and fome have\ndied through mere weaknefs. In fuch a cafe, bleeding is well known to be fatal.\nYoung men cannot be too often warned of the irreparable injury they may do to\ntheir health; and parents, to whofe care they are entrufted, ought to employ all\nthe means in their power to turn them from fuch dangerous excefles. But at the\nage of puberty, young men know not of how great importance it is to prolong this\nfmiling feafon of their days, whereon the happinefs or mifery of their future life fo\nmuch depends. Then they look not forwards to futurity, nor reflect on what is\npaft, nor enjoy prefent pleafures with moderation. How many ceafe to be men,\nor at leaft to have the faculties of men, before the age of thirty ? Nature muft not\nbe forced : like a true mother, her objedt is the fober and difcreet union of the fexes.\nIt is fufficient to obey when fhe commands, and to anfwer when fhe calls. Neither\nmuft we forget here to mention and condemn an outrage committed againft nature,\nthe Ihameful practice of which endangers the lofs of health, and the total ruin of\nthe conftitution \u2022, I mean that folitary libertinifm, fo extenfively explained in the\nMedical Part of my edition of Culpeper, by which a man or woman, deceiving\nnature as it were, endeavours to procure thofe enjoyments which religion has for-\nbidden except when connected with the happinefs of being a parent. Such then is\nthe phyfical order which the Author of nature, the great preferver of the fpecies as\nwell as the individual, has appointed to induce man, by the attraction of pleafure,\nto propagate and continue his race.\nAccording to the ordinary courfe of nature, women are not fit for conception till\nafter the firft appearance of the menfes. When thefeftop, which generally happens\nabout forty or fifty years of age, they are barren ever after. Their breafts then\nfhrink and decay, and the voice becomes feebler. Some, however, have become\nmothers before they have experienced any menftrual difcharge \u2022, and others have\nconceived at the age of fixty, and fometimes at a more advanced age. Such ex-\namples, though not unfrequent, muft be confidered as exceptions to the general\nrule ; but they are fufficient to ffiew that the menftrual difcharge is not eflential to\ngeneration. The age at which man acquires the faculty of procreating is not fo\ndiftindtly marked. In order to the production of femen, the body muft have at-\ntained a certain growth, which generally happens between twelve and eighteen years\nof age. At fixty or feventy, when the body begins to be enervated by old age,\nthe voice becomes weaker, the femen is fecreted in fmaller quantities, and it is often\nunprolific. There are inftances, however, of old men who have procreated at the\nage of eighty or ninety.

But fuch fails, which are very rare, ought to\nbe confidered as extraordinary phenomena in the courfe of nature.\nAt the age of puberty, or a few years after, the body attains its full flature.\nSome young men grow no taller after fifteen or fixteen, and others continue to grow\ntill the age of twenty or twenty-three. At this period they are very (lender : but by\ndegrees the members fwell and begin to affume their proper (hape \u2022, and, before the\nage of thirty, the body in men has attained its greatefl perfection with regard to\nftrength, confidence, and fymmetry. Adolefcence ends at the age of twenty or\ntwenty-five \u2022, and at this period youth (according to the divifion which has been\nmade of the years of man\u2019s life into different ages) begins. It continues till the\nage of thirty or thirty-five.\nThe common flature of men is about five feet and three, four, five, fix, or feven,\ninches \u2022, and of women about five feet and two, three, and four, inches. Men be-\nlow five feet are of a fmall flature. The Laplanders do not exceed four feet and a\nhalf ; and the natives of fome other countries are flill fmaller. Women attain their\nfull height fooner than men. Haller computes, that, in the temperate climates of\nEurope, the medium flature of men is about five feet and five or fix inches. It is\nobferved by the fame author, that in Switzerland the inhabitants of the plains are\ntaller than thofe of the mountains. It is difficult to afcertain with precifion the\nailual limits of the human flature. In furveying the inhabited earth, we find\ngreater differences in the flatures of individuals than in thofe of nations. In the\nfame climate, among the fame people, and fometimes in the fame family, there are\nmen whofe flature is either too tall or too diminutive.-\u2014The body having acquired\nits full height during the period of adolefcence, and its full dimenfions in youth,\nremains for fome years in the fame (late before it begins to decay. This is the pe-\nriod of manhood, which extends from the age of thirty or thirty-five to that of\nforty or forty-five years. During this flage, the powers of the body continue in\nfull vigour, and the principal change which takes place in the human figure arifes\nfrom the formation of fat in different parts. Exceffive fatnefs disfigures the body,\nand becomes a very cumberfome and inconvenient load.\nThe body of a well-fhaped man ought to be fquare, the mufcles ought to be\nflrongly marked, the contour of the members boldly delineated, and the features\nof the face well defined. In women, all the parts are more rounded and fofter, the\nfeatures are more delicate, and the complexion brighter. To man belong ftrength\nand majefty ;\ngraceful nefs and beauty are the portion of the other lex.\u2014 Every\nthing in both iexes points them out as the fovereigns of the earth j even the exter-\nnal appearance of man declares his fuperiority to other living Creatures.'

The image of his foul is\npainted in his face ; the excellence of his nature pierces through the material organs,\nand gives a fire and animation to the features of his countenance. His majeftic de-\nportment, his firm and emboldened gait, announce the noblenefs of his rank. He\ntouches the earth only with his extremity ; he views it only at a difiance, and feems\nto defpife it. It has been juftly obferved, that the countenance of man is the mir-\nror of his mind. In the looks of no animal are the expreffions of pafilon painted\nwith fuch energy and rapidity, and with fuch gentle gradations and fha'des, as in\nthofe of man. We know, that in certain emotions of the mind, the blood rifes to\nthe face, and produces bluffing; and that in others the countenance turns pale.\nThefe two fymptoms, the appearance of which depends on the ftrudure and tranf-\nparency of the reticulum, efpecially rednefs, conftitute a peculiar beauty. In our\nclimates, the natural colour of the face of a man in good health is white, with a\nlively red fuffufed upon the cheeks. Palenefs of the countenance is always a fuf-\npicious fymptom. That colour which is fhaded with black is a fign of melancholy\nand of vitiated bile ; and conftant and univerfal rednefs is a proof that the blood is\ncarried with too great impetuofity to the brain. A livid colour is a morbid and dan-\ngerous fymptom ;\nand that which has a tint of yellow is a fign of jaundice or re-\npletion of bile. The colour of the fkin is frequently altered by want of fleep or of\nnouriihment, or by loofenefs and diarrhoea.\nNotwithftanding the general fimilitude of countenance in nations and families,\nthere is a wonderful diverfity of features. No one, however, is at a lofs to recoi-\nled; the perfon to whom he intends to fpeak, provided he has once fully feen him.\nOne man has livelinefs and gaiety painted in his countenance, and announces be-\nfore-hand, by the cheerfulnefs of his appearance, the character which he is to fup-\nport in fociety. The tears which bedew the cheeks of another man would excite\ncompanion in the molt unfeeling heart. Thus the face of man is the rendezvous of\nthe fymptoms both of his moral and phylical affedions: tranquillity, anger, threat-\nening, joy, fmiles, laughter, malice, love, envy, jealoufy, pride, contempt, difdain\nor indignation, irony, arrogance, tears, terror, aftonifhment, horror, fear, Ihame or\nhumiliation, forrow and afflidion, compafiion, meditation, particular convulfions,\nfleep, death, &c. &c. The difference of thefe charaders is of fufficient importance\nto form a principal article in the natural hiftory of man.\nWhen the mind is at eafe, all the features of the face are in a ftate of profound\ntranquillity. Their proportion, harmony, and union, point out the ferenity of the\nthoughts. But when the foul is agitated, the human face becomes a living canvafs,\nwhereon the palfions are reprefented with equal delicacy and energy, where every\nemotion\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 135\nemotion, of the foul is expreffed by fome feature, and every aflion by fome mark ;\nthe lively impreflion of which anticipates the will, and reveals by pathetic figns\nour fecret agitation, and thofe intentions which we are anxious to conceal. It is\nparticularly in the eyes that the foul is painted in the ftrongeft colours and with the\nmod delicate {hades.\nThe different colours of the eyes are, dark hazel, light hazel, green, blue, grey,\nand whitifh-groy. The mcft common of thefe colours are hazel and blue, both\nof which are often found in the fame eye. Eyes which are commonly called black\nare only dark hazel ; they appear black in confequence of being contrafted with\nthe white of the eye. Wherever there is a tint of blue, however flight, it becomes\nthe prevailing colour, and outfhinesthe hazel, with which it is intermixed, to fuch\na degree, that the mixture cannot be perceived without a very narrow examination*\nThe moft beautiful eyes are thofe which appear black or blue. In the former, there\nis more exprtffion and vivacity; in the latter, more fweetnefs and perhaps delicacy.\nNext to the eyes, the parts of the face by which the phyfiognomy is molt ftrongly\nmarked are the eye brows. Being of a different nature from the other parts, their\neffeft is increafed by contraft. They are like a {hade in a pifture, which gives re-\nlief to the other colours and forms.\nThe forehead is one of the largeft parts of the face, and contributes moft to its\nbeauty. Every body knows of how great importance the hair is in the phyfiognomy,\nand that baldnefs is a very great defeat. When old age begins to make its ap-\nproaches, the hair which firft falls off is that which covers the crown of the head\nand the parts above the temples. We feldom fee the hair of the lower part of the\ntemples, or of the back of the head, completely fall off. Baldnefs is peculiar to\nmen-, women do not naturally lofe their hair, though it becomes white as well as\nthat of the men at the approach of old age.\nThe nofe is the moft prominent feature of the face. But as it has very little mo-\ntion, and that only in the moft violent paflions, it contributes lefs to the expreffion\nthan to the beauty of the countenance. The nofe is feldom perpendicular to the\nmiddle of the face, but for the moft part is turned to one fide or the other. The\ncaufe of this irregularity, which, according to the painters, is perfectly confiftent\nwith beauty, and of which even the want would be a deformity, appears to be fre-\nquent preflure on one fide of the cartilage of the child\u2019s nofe againft the breaft of\nthe mother when it receives fuck. At this early period of life, the cartilages and\nbones have acquired very little folidity, and are eafiiy bent, as may be obferved in\nthe legs and thighs of fome individuals, who have been injured by the bandages of\nthe fwaddling clothes.\nNext\n\fi 4o A Kfl TO PHYSIC,\nNext to the eyes, the mouth and lips have the greateft motion and expreffon.\nThefe motions are under the influence of the paffions. The mouth, which is fet\noff by the vermillion of the lips and the enamel of the teeth, marks, by the various\nforms which it affumes, their different characters. The organ of the voice like-\nwife gives animation to this feature, and communicates to it more life and expref-\nfion than is poffeffed by any of the reft. The cheeks are uniform features, and\nhave no motion or expreffion excepting from that involuntary rednefs or palenefs\nwith which they are covered in different paffions, fuch as lhame, anger, pride, and\njoy, on the one hand ; and fear, terror, and forrow, on the other.\nIn different paffions, the whole head affumes different pofnions, and is affeCted\nwith different motions. It hangs forward during fhame, humility, and forrow ;\nit inclines to one fide in langour and compaffion ; it is elevated in pride, ereCt and\nfixed in obftinacy and felf-conceit \u2022,\nin aftonifhment it is thrown backwards; and\nit moves from fide to fide in contempt, ridicule, anger, and indignation.\u2014In grief,\njoy, love, fhame, and compaffion, the eyes fwell, and the tears flow. The effufion\nof tears is always accompanied with an extenfion of the mufcles of the face, which\nopens the mouth.\u2014In forrow, the corners of the mouth are depreffed, the under-\nlip rifes, the eye-lids fall down, the pupil of the eye is raifed and half concealed by\nthe eye-lid. The other mufcles of the face are relaxed, fo that the diftance be-\ntween the eyes and the mouth is greater than ordinary ; and confequently the\ncountenance appears to be lengthened.\u2014In fear, terror, confternation, and horror,\nthe forehead is wrinkled, the eye-brows are raifed, the eye-lids are opened as wide\nas poflible, the upper lid uncovers a part of the white above the pupil, which is\ndepreffed and partly concealed by the under lid. At the fame time, the mouth\nopens wide, the lips recede from each other, and difcover the teeth both above and\nbelow.\u2014In contempt and derifion, the upper lip is raifed at one fide and expofes\nthe teeth, while the other fide of the lip moves a little and wears the appearance of\na fmile. The noftril on the elevated fide of the lip fhrivels up, and the corner of\nthe mouth falls down. The eye on the fame fide is almoft fhut, while the other is\nopen as ulual ; but the pupils of both are depreffed, as when one looks down from\na height.\u2014In jealoufy, envy, and malice, the eye-brows fall down and are wrinkled\n;\nthe eye-lids are elevated, and the pupils are depreffed. The upper lip is elevated\non both fides, while the corners of the mouth are a little depreffed, and the under\nlip rifes to join the middle of the upper.-In laughter, the corners of the mouth are\ndrawn back and a little elevated; the upper parts of the cheeks rife; the eyes\nate pore or lefs clofed * the upper lip rifes, and the under one falls down ; the\nmouth opens ; and, in cafes of immoderate laughter, the Ikin of the nofe wrinkles.\nThat gentler and more gracious kind of laughter which is called fmiling, is feated\nwholly\n\fHi\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nwholly in the parts of the mouth. The under lip rifes ; the angles of the mouth\nare drawn back; the cheeks are puffed up; the eye-lids approach one another;\nand a fmall twinkling is obferved in the eyes. It is very extraordinary, that\nlaughter may be excited either by a moral caufe without the immediate a6tion of\nexternal obje&s, or by a particular irritation of the nerves without any feeling of\njoy. Thus an involuntary laugh is excited by a flight tickling of the lips, of the\npalm of the hand, of the foie of the foot, of the arm-pits, and, in fhort, below\nthe middle of the ribs. We laugh when two diffimilar ideas, the union of which\nwas unexpected, are prefented to the mind at the fame time, and when one or\nboth of thefe ideas, or their union, includes fome abfurdity which excites an\nemotion of difdain mingled with joy. In general, ftriking contrails never fail to\nproduce laughter. \u2014A change is produced in the features of the countenance by\nweeping as well as by laughing. When we weep, the under lip is feparated from\nthe teeth, the forehead is wrinkled, the eye-brows are depreffed, the dimple, which\ngives a gracefulnefs to laughter, forfakes the cheek ; the eyes are more compreflfed,\nand almoft conftantly bathed in tears, which in laughter flow more feldom and\nlefs copioufly.\nThe arms, hands, and every part of the body, contribute to the exprefiion of\nthe paflions. In joy, for inftance, all the members of the body are agitated with\nquick and various motions. In languor and forrow, the arms hang down, and\nthe whole body remains fixed and immoveable. In admiration and furprife, this\ntotal fufpenfion of motion is likewife obferved. In love, defire, and hope, the\nhead and eyes are raifed to heaven, and feem to folicit the wilhed-for good ; the\nbody leans forward as if to approach it ; the arms are ftretched out, and feem to\nfeize before-hand the beloved objeCt. On the contrary, in fear, hatred, and horror,\nthe arms feem to pufh backward and repel the objeCt of our averfion ; we turn\naway our head and eyes as if to avoid the fight of it ; we recoil in order to fhun it.\nAlthough the human body is externally much more delicate than that of any\nother animal, yet it is very nervous, and perhaps ftronger in proportion to its fize\nthan that of the ftrongeft animals. We are afiured that the porters at Conftanti-\nnople carry burdens of nine hundred pounds weight. A thoufand wonderful flories\nare related of the Hottentots and other favages concerning their agility in running,\n. Civilized man knows not the full extent of his powers, nor how much he lofes by\nthat effeminacy and ina&ivity by which they are weakened and deftroyed. He is\ncontented even to be ignorant of the ftrength and vigour which his members are ca-\npable of acquiring by motion, and by being accuftomed to fevere exercifes, as is\nobferved in runners, tumblers, and rope-dancers. The conclufion is, therefore,\nfounded on the molt juft and indifputable indudtion and analogy.\u2014 The attitude\nNo. 10. O o\n\f142 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nof walking is lefs fatiguing to man than that in which he is placed when he is\nflopped in running. Every time he fets his foot upon the ground, he paffes over\na more confiderable fpace ; the body leans forwards, and the arms follow the fame\ndirection ; the refpiration increafes, and breathing becomes difficult. Leaping\nbegins with great inflexions of the members ; the body is then much ffiortened,\nbut immediately ftretches itfelf out with a great effort. The motions which accom-\npany leaping make it very fatiguing.\nIt is obferved that a ceffation from exercife is not alone fufficient to reftore the\npowers of the body when they are exhaufted by fatigue. The fprings, though not\nin adtion, are ftill wound up while we are awake, even when every movement is\nfufpended. In fleep nature finds that repofe which is fuited to her wants, and the\ndifferent organs enjoy a falutary relaxation. This is that wonderful ftate in which\nman, unconfcious of his own exiftence, and funk in apparent death, repairs the\nlofs which his faculties have fuftained, and feems to affume a new exiftence* In this\nftate of drowfinefs and repofe, the fenfes ceafe to adt, the functions of the body are\nfufpended, and it feems abandoned to itfelf. The external fymptoms of fleep, which\nalone are the objedts of our attention, are eafily diftinguiffied. At the approach of\nfleep, the eyes begin to wink, the eye-lids fall down, the head nods and hangs\ndown: its fall aftonifhes the Deeper ; he ftarts up, and makes an effort to drive\naway fleep, but in vain ; a new inclination, ftronger than the former, deprives\nhim of the power of raifing his head j his chin refts upon his breaft, and in this\npofition he enjoys a tranquil fleep.\nThe age of decline extends from forty or forty-five to fixty or fixty-five years of\nage. At this time of life, the diminution of the fat is the caufe of thofe wrinkles\nwhich begin to appear in the face and fome other parts of the body. The fkin, not\nbeing fupported by the fame quantity of fat, and being incapable, from want of\ndafticity, of contradting, finks down and forms folds. In the decline of life, a re-\nmarkable change takes place alfo in vifion. In the vigour of our days, the cryftal-\nline lens, being thicker and more diaphanous than the humours of the eye, enables\nus to read letters of a very fmall charadter at the diftance of eight or ten inches.\nBut when the age of decline comes on, the quantity of the humours of the eye di-\nminiffies, they lofe their clearnefs, and the tranfparent cornea becomes lefs convex.\nTo remedy this inconvenience, we place what we wiffi to read at a greater diftance\nfrom the eye : but vifion is thereby very little improved, becaufe the image of the\nobjedt becomes ftnaller and more obfeure. Another mark of the decline of life is\na weaknefs of the ftomach, and indigeftion, in moft people who do not take fufficient\nexercife in proportion to the quantity and the quality of their food.-\u2014At fixty,\nftxty-three, or fixty-five, years of age, the figns of decline become more and more\nvifible.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. i 4?\nvifible, and indicate old age. This period commonly extends to the age of feventy,\nfometimes to feventy-five, but feldom to eighty. When the body is extenuated\nand bent by old age, man then becomes crazy. Crazinefs therefore is nothing but\nan infirm old age. The eyes and ftomach then become weaker and weaker ; leannefs\nincreafes the number of the wrinkles ; the beard and the hair become white; the\nftrength and the memory begin to fail. \u2014After leventy, or at moft eighty, years of\nage, the life of man is nothing but labour and forrow : luch was the language of\nDavid near three thoufand years ago. Some men of ftrong conftitutions, and in\ngood health, enjoy old age for a long time without decrepitude ; but fuch inftances'\nare not very common. The infirmities of decrepitude continually increafe, and at\nlength death concludes the whole. This fatal term is uncertain. The only con-\nclufions which we can form concerning the duration of life, mult be derived from\nobfervations made on a great number of men who were born at the fame time, and\nwho died at different ages.\nThe figns of decrepitude form a ftriking picture of weaknefs, and announce the\napproaching d'ffblution of the body. The memory totally fails ; the nerves be-\ncome hard and blunted; deafnefs and blindnefs take place; the lenfes of fmell, of\ntouch, and of tafte, are deftroyed ; the appetite fails ; the necefilty of eating, and\nmore frequently that of drinking, are alone felt ;\nafter the teeth fall out, maftica-\ntion is imperfectly performed, and digeftion is very bad; the lips fall inwards;\nthe edges of the jaws can no longer approach one another; the mufcles of the\nlower jaw become fo weak, that they are unable to raife and fupport it ; the body\nftnks down; the fpine is bent outward; and the vertebras grow together at the\nanterior part ; the body becomes extremely lean ; the ftrength fails ; the decrepid\nwretch is unable to fupport himfelf ; he is obliged to remain on a feat, or ftretched\nin his bed : the bladder becomes paralytic ; the inteftines lofe their fpring ;\nthe\ncirculation of the blood becomes flower ; the ftrokes of the pulfe no longer amount\nto the number of eighty in a minute, as in the vigour of life, but are reduced to\ntwenty-four and fometimes fewer: refpiration is flower ; the body lofes its heat;\nthe circulation of the blood ceales ; death follows ; and the dream of life is no\nmore.\nMan, however, has no right to complain of the fhortnefs of life. Throughout\nthe whole of living beings, there are few who unite in a greater degree all the in-\nternal caufes which tend to prolong its different periods. The term of geftation is\nvery confiderable ; the rudiments of the teeth are very late in unfolding; his\ngrowth is flow, and is not completed before about twenty years have elapfed. \u2014The\nage of puberty, alfo, is much later in man than in any other animal.

Inftead of faying that he has finilhed his life, we ought rather to\nfay that he has not completed it. \u2014The natural and total duration of life is in fome\nmeafure proportioned to the period of growth. A tree or an animal, which foon\nacquires its full fize, decays much fooner than another which continues to grow for\na longer time. If it be true that the life of animals is eight times longer than the\nperiod of their growth, we might conclude that the boundaries of human life may\nbe extended to a century and a half.\nIt does not appear that the life of man becomes Ihorter in proportion to the length\nof time the world has exifted.

In the early part of his life, he was a fervant\nin the family of the prince de Beaufremont. His memory continued good to the\nlaft day of his life \u2022, and the principal inconveniences which he felt from his great\nage were, that his fight was weakened, and the natural heat of his body was fo\ndiminifhed, that he fhivered with cold in the middle of the dog-days if he was\nnot fitting by a good lire. This old man was received in the body of the houfe\nby the national affembly, indulged with a chair, and directed to keep on his hat\nleft he fhould catch cold if he were to fit uncovered. A collection was made for\nhim by the members, which exceeded 500I. fterling-, but he lived not to return to\nMount Jura. He was buried on Saturday the 31ft of January 1790, with great\nfuneral pomp, in the parifh-church of St. Euftace, at Paris.

In a word, thofe\nwho have exceeded 100 years,* .have in general been robuft, laborious, fober, and\ncareful to obferve the ftridteft regimen. Enjoying a good conftitution from nature,\nthey have feldom or never been fubjedt to difeafe. They have even enjoyed the\ngreateft health and vigour, and retained the ufe of their fenfes to the laft moment\nof their lives.\nAmong\n\fand occult science. 147\nAmong thofe who have led a life of contemplation and ftudy, many have reached\na very advanced age. Longevity is frequent among the different orders of religious,\nwho by their ftatutes are confined to a moderate diet, and obliged to abflain from\nwine and the ufe of meat. Some celebrated anchorets have lived to a great age\nwhile they fed upon nothing but the wild roots and fruits which they found in the\nd'efart whither they had retired. The philofopher Xenophilus, who lived to the\nao-eof 106, was of the Pythagorean fe<5t. It is well known, that thofe philofophers\nwho held the tranfmigration of fouls denied themfelves the ufe of meat, becaufe\nthey imagined that killing an animal would be to afiaffinate another felf. A coun-\ntry life has produced many found and vigorous old men. It is fuppofecl that a\nhappy old age is attained with greater difficulty in towns than in the country. Sir\nHans Sloane, Duverney, and Fontenelle, however, are inftances of men whofe\nlives have been fpent in cities, and yet extended to a very great length. It has been\nobferved, that men deprived of reafon live very long ;\nwhich is to be imputed to\ntheir being exempt from thofe inquietudes which are the moft deadly poifon. Per-\nfons poffeffing a fufficiently good underitanding, but deftitute of ambition, have*\nbeen found to enjoy very long life. Men who are devoid of pretenfions, who are\nfree from thofe cares which a defire of fhining by a difplay of talents, or of acquir-\ning dignity and power, neceffarily brings in its train, who feel no regret for the\npair nor anxiety about the future, are Grangers to thofe torments of the mind which\nwafte and consume the body. To that tranquillity of foul, which is fo excellent a\nprerogative of infancy, they add that of being long young by phyfical conftitution,\non which the moral has a linking and powerful influence.\nPremature wifdom, and early talents, are often fitter to excite aflonifhment than\nexpectation. The rapid unfolding of the moral faculties, by fiiortening the period of\nyouth, feems to diminifh in proportion the total duration of life. We have known\na young lady of feventeen, who could fpcak very corredtly feven languages: ffie\ntranfiated and wrote Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanifn, German, Englifh, and French ;\nbut ffie died at the age of eighteen. The young man by whom ffie was afked in\nmarriage, having been informed that he could not obtain her hand till he had made\nhimfelf worthy of her by the fame degree of talents and information, died the fame\nyear, and at the Erne age.\nFrom the preceding obfcrvations, Dr. Haller has attempted to deduce the caufes\nwhy a few men are longer exempted than others from the common fate. \u2014The cir-\ncumstances which oppofe their influence are independent of our will ;\nfuch as the\nravages of epidemic diftempers, trouble, and anxiety of mind, which create difeafes\nin the body, or the torments of ambition. It is neceffary to live in a falubrious\nclimate, to enjoy a fortune fufficiently eafy to exclude thofe uneafy defires which\ncreate\n\fA KEY TO PHYSIC,\n14&\ncreate a feeling of want and privation, to be defcended from healthy parents, to\navoid drinking wine in youth, to drink water, and to eat little meat and a great\ndeal of vegetables. It is neceffary alfo to be temperate in meals \u2022, moderate in plea-\nlures, ftudy, and exercife ^ to be naturally inclined to cheerfulnefs ^ and to allot\na due time to fleep and repofe.\u2014Long life is certainly very rare i\nbut, as has been\nalready obferved, we mull diftinguifh between what is natural to the conftitution\nof man and that which is the confequence of his condition. By the former he is\nmade to be long lived ; but nature is arrefted in her courfe by local and accidental\ncaufes, which it is not always in our power to avoid.\nLet us take a retrofpedlive view of man\u2019s life from his infancy, and enumerate\nthe chief of thefe different caufes. Ofa thoufand infants, extradted from the Lon-\ndon bills of mortality, twenty-three died almoft as foon as they came into the world :\nteething carried off fifty, and convulfions two hundred and feventy-feven : eighty\ndied of the fmall-pox, and feven of the meafles. Among the adult females, eight\nat leaft died in child-bed : confumption and afthma, difeafes more frequent in Eng-\nland than in France, carried off an hundred and ninety-one of the fame fex, and\nalmoft a fifth part of the full-grown men. An hundred and fifty died of fevers.\nAt a more advanced age, twelve died of apoplexy, and forty-one of dropfy, with-\nout mentioning thofe to whom difeafes of little importance in themfelves became\nmortal. There only remained feventy-eight whofe death could be afcribed to old\nage \u2022, and of thefe twenty- feven lived to the age of eighty and upwards. Among\nthe different difeafes of which we have juft now feen the fatal effedts, and which\ncarry off more than nine-tenths of mankind, not one, it muft be allowed, is na-\ntural to the conftitution. The inhabitants of this ifland are in general but little\nfubjedt to difeafes, excepting the fmall-pox and the meafles ; and many of them\nenjoy uninterrupted health to old age.-~And here it may be proper to mention\nwhat are the moft prevalent difeafes in other countries, which prove equally\nfatal to the duration of human life. In northern climates, fcurvy, the cholic of\nthe Laplanders, and difeafes of the lungs, moft frequently occafion death. In\ntemperate climates, dropfy carries off a great many at the beginning of old age,\nwhich is the boundary of life in the greateft part of both fexes, when they have\nefeaped the acute difeafes, fuch as putrid fever, &c. Acute difeafes are moft com-\nmon in warm countries. In fome places, the rays of the fun kill in a few hours\nthofe who are expofed to its burning heat. The air of Egypt and of Afia Minor\nengenders the plague, by which one half of their inhabitants are carried off. Be-\ntween the tropics men are fubjedt to dyfenteries and violent fevers. The cold of\nthe night, in warm climates, occafions fometimes violent difeafes, fuch as pally,\nquinfey, and a fwelling of the head. Damp and marfliy places give rife to fevers\nof\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 149\nof a different kind, but alfo very dangerous. The life of failors has a great ten-\ndency to produce fcurvy. How many profeffions prove fatal to the health, and in\nmod men haften that period which nature would have brought on by flow degrees !\nMiners, ftone-cutters, gilders, perfons employed in emptying privies, &c. are fub-\njeft to difeafes of the lungs, and become paralytic. Other profeffions of life bring\non other accidents, of which it would carry us too far to give a particular account.\nWhat has been faid is fufficient to fhew, that it is the dangers with which we are\nfurrounded that ftiorten the period of human exiftence.\nBy examining the lift of thofe who have attained a great age, it will be found thac\nmankind are longer lived in northern than in fouthern countries. It has been ob-\nferved, that there are more old men in mountainous and elevated fituations than in\nplains and low countries. We repeat it, if the duration of life among the inhabi-\ntants of fouthern climates be compared with the duration of life in northern nations,\nit will be allowed, that the latter enjoy both longer life and better health than the\nformer. Their growth being retarded by the rigour of the climate, their decay\nmuff: alfo be flower, becaufe of the proportion which exifts between the growth of\nanimals and the length of their lives. Among ten perfons who have lived to the\nage of an hundred, eight or nine will be found to have lived in the north.\nIt appears from the bills of mortality, that in the country more boys are born\nthan girls ; in cities, on the contrary, the number of females is commonly greateft.\nObfervations made with great care prove, that in moft countries there are fewer men\nalive than women, and that more males die, chiefly at the firft and laft periods of\nlife. In Sweden, the whole number of females, in 1763, was to that of males in the\nproportion of ten to nine. The number of old women who exceeded eighty years\nof age was to that of old men of the fame age in the proportion of thirty-three to\nnineteen : and there were more women than men who had attained the age of eighty-\nfix, in the proportion of almoft two to one.\nThe late Dr. Price made obfervations, after Dr. Percival, on the difference of\nlongevity, and the duration of human life, in towns, country-pariflies, and vil-\nlages \u2022, of which the following is the refult: a greater number in proportion die\nin great towns than in fmall ones, and a greater number in the latter than in vil-\nlages. The caufe of this difference, which is found to be very great, muft be, in\nthe firft place, the luxury and diffipation which prevail in towns j and, fecondly,\nthe badnefs of the air. In the town of Manchefter, according to obfervation, i-2Sth\nof the inhabitants die annually ; whereas, in the neighbouring country, the num-\nber of deaths does not exceed i-46th of the whole inhabitants. It may be laid down\nas a general principle, that in great towns, the number of deaths annually is from\none in nineteen to one in twenty-two or twenty-three j in middling towns, from\nNo. 10. ~ Q_q one\n\f150 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\none in twenty-four to one in twenty-eight ; and in country parifhes and villages fel-\ndom more than one in forty or fifty. In 1763, the number of inhabitants in Stock-\nholm amounted to feventy-two thoufand nine hundred and feventy-nine. The\naverage number of deaths for the fix years preceding had been three thoufand eight\nhundred and two, which makes one in nineteen annually-, while throughout all\nSweden, including the towns and the country, not more than one in thirty-five die\nannually. At Rome the inhabitants are numbered every year. In 1771 they were\nfound to amount to one hundred and fifty-nine thoufand fix hundred andfeventy-five:\nthe average number of deaths for ten years was feven thoufand three hundred and\nfixty-feven -, which makes one in twenty-three and a half annually. In London\nnot lefs than one in twenty three-fourths of the inhabitants die every year.\nM. Daubenton has given, in the Encyclopedic Methodique, a table of the proba-\nbilities of the duration of life, conftrudled from that which is to be found in the\nfeventh volume of the Supplemens a I'llijtoire Naturelle de M. de Buffon.\nThe following is an abridgement of it\n:\nOf twenty-three thoufand nine hundred and ninety-four children, born at the\nfame time, there will probably die.\nIn one year\nRemaining 2-3ds, or 15996.\nIn eight years\nRemaining i-half, or 1 1997-\nIn thirty-eight years\nRemaining i-3d, or 7998.\nIn fifty years\nRemaining i-4th, or 5998.\nIn fixty-one years\nRemaining i-6th, or 3999.\nIn feventy years\nRemaining i-ioth, or 2399.\nIn eighty years\nRemaining i-40th, or 599.\nIn ninety years\nRemaining i-30oth, or 79.\nIn one hundred years\nRemaining i-iooooth, or 2.\nIt thus appears, that a very fmall number of men indeed pafs through all the pe-\nriods of life, and arrive at the goal marked out by nature.

No looner has the body attained its utmoft perfection,\nthan it begins to decline. Its decay is at firlt imperceptible ; but in the progrcfs of\ntime the membranes become cartilaginous, the cartilages acquire the confidence of\nbone; the bones become more folicl, and all the fibres are hardened. Almoft all\nthe fat wades away \u2022, the fkin becomes withered and fcaly ; wrinkles are gradually\nformed; the hair grows white; the teeth fall out; the face Iofes its fhape ; the\nbody is bent; and the colour and confidence of the crvftalline humour become\nmore perceptible. The fird traces of this decay begin to be perceived at the age of\nforty, and fometimes fooner ;\nthis is the age of decline. They increafe by flow de-\ngrees till fixty, which is the 'period of old age. They increafe more rapidly till the\nage of feventy or feventy-five. At this period crazinefs begins, and continues al-\nways to increafe.

Little now remains to be loft ; and, before the\nage of ninety or an hundred, death terminates at once decrepitude and life.\nThe body then dies by little and little ;\nits motion gradually diminifhes ; life is\nextinguilhed by fucceftive gradations, and death is only the laft term in the fuc-\nceftion. When the motion of the heart, which continues longeft, ceafcs, man has\nthen breathed his laft ;\nhe has pafted from the ftate of life to the ftate of death ; and,\nas at his birth a breath opened to him the career of life, fo with a breath he finifhes\nhis courfe.\nThis natural caufe of death is common to all animals, and even to vegetables.\nWe may obferve that the centre of an oak firft perifhes and falls into the dull, be-\ncaufe thefe parts having become harder and more compadt can receive no further\nnourilhment. The caufes of our diffolution, therefore, are as neceflary as death is\ninevitable; and it is no more in our power to retard this fatal term than to alter\nthe eftablilhed laws of the univerfe. Hence the following maxim has been uni-\nverfally adopted, Contra vim mortis,\nnullum medicamentum in hortisf In whatever\nmanner death happens, the time and circumftances thereof are unknown.

This is produced by an inteftine fermentation,\nwhich occafions putrefaction, and reduces the body to volatile alkali, fetid oil,\nand earth.\nThe defire of felf-prefervation, and of protracting the fhort fpan of life, is fo in-\ntimately interwoven with our conftitution, that it is juftly efteemed one of the firft\nprinciples of our nature, and, in fpite even of pain and mifery, feldom quits us to\nthe laft moments of our exiilence. It feems, therefore, to be no lefs our duty than\nour intereft to examine minutely into the various means that have been confidered\nas conducive to health and long life -,\nand, if poffible, to diftinguilh fuch circum-\nftances as are efiential to that great end, from thofe which are merely accidental.\nIt has long been known that frefh air is more immediately necefiary to life than\nfood *, for a man may live two or three days without the latter, but not many mi-\nnutes without the former. The Vivifying principle contained in the atmofphere, fo\neffential to the fupport of flame, as well as animal life, concerning which authors\nhave propofed fo many conjectures, is nothing elfe but that pure dephlogifticated\nfluid lately difcovered by that ingenious philofopher Dr. Prieltly, The common\natmofphere may well be fuppofed to be more or lefs healthy in proportion as it\nabounds with this animating principle. As this exhales in copious ftreams from\nthe green leaves of all kinds of vegetables, even from thofe of the molt poifonous\nkind, may we not, in fome meafure, account why inftances of longevity are fo\nmuch more frequent in the country than in large cities ; where the air, inftead of\npartaking fo largely of this falutary impregnation, is daily contaminated with\nnoxious animal effluvia and phlogifton ?\nWith refpeCt to climate, various obfervations confpire to prove, that thofe regions\nwhich lie within the temperate zones are beft calculated to promote long life.\nHence, perhaps, may be explained, why Italy has produced fo many long livers,\nand why iflands in general are more falutary than continents ;\nof which Bermudas\nand fome others afford examples. And it is a pleafing circumftance that our own\nbland appears to contain far more inftances of longevity than could well be imagin-\ned. The ingenious Mr. Whitehurft allures us, from certain faCts, that Englifh-\nmen are in general longer lived than North Americans ; and that a Britilh confti-\ntution will laft longer, even in that climate, than a native one.

Befides, we find, that by the wonderful powers\nof the digeftive organs, a variety of animal and vegetable fubftances, of very dif-\ncordant principles, are happily afiimilated into one bland homogeneous chyle\n;\ntherefore itfeems natural to diftruft thofe cynical writers, who would rigidly confine\nmankind to one fimple difh, and their drink to the mere water of the brook.\nNature, it is true, has pointed out that mild infipid fluid as the univerfal diluent,\nand therefore moft admirably adapted for our daily beverage. But experience has\nequally proved, that vinous and fpirituous liquors, on certain occafions, are no\nlefs falutary and beneficial, whether it be to fupport ftrength againft ficknefs or\nbodily fatigue, or to exhilarate the mind under the preflure of heavy misfortunes.\nBut, alas ! what Nature meant for innocent and ufeful cordials, to be ufed only\noccafionaliy, and according to the direction of reafon, cuftom and caprice have,\nby degrees, rendered habitual to the human frame, and liable to the moft enormous\nand deftrudtive abufes. Hence it may be juftly doubted, whether gluttony and in-\ntemperance have not depopulated the world more than even the fword, peftilence,\nand famine. True, therefore, is the old maxim, \u201c Modus utendi ex veneno fact\nt\nviedieamentum, ex medicamento venenum.\u201d *\nIt is allowed on all hands, that alternate motion and reft, and deep and watch-\ning, are necefiary conditions to health and longevity ; and that they ought to be\nadapted to age, temperament, conftitution, temperature of the climate, &c. but\nthe errors which mankind daily commit in thefe refpe&s become a fruitful fource of\ndifeafes. While fome are bloated and relaxed with eafe and indolence, others are\nemaciated, and become rigid through hard labour, watching, and fatigue.\u2014Where\nthe animal functions are duly performed, the fecretions go on regularly; and the\ndifferent evacuations fo exactly correfpond to the quantity of aliment taken in, in a\ngiven time, that the body is found to return daily to nearly the fame weight.

The animating pafiions,\n, fuch as joy, hope, love, &c. when kept within proper bounds, gently excite the\nnervous influence, promote an equable circulation, and are highly conducive to\nhealth ; while the deprefling afFedions,. fuch as fear, grief, and defpair, produce\nthe contrary effed, and lay the foundation of the moft formidable difeafes.\nFrom the light which hiftory affords us, as well as from the foregoing lift of\nlong lives, there is great reafon to believe, that longevity is in fome meafure here-\nditary ; and that healthy long-lived parents would commonly tranfmit the fame to\ntheir children, were it not for intemperance, and the frequent errors in medical ad-\nvice, which fo evidently tend to the abbreviation of human life. \u2014Where is it, but\nfrom thefe caufes, and the unnatural modes of living, that, of all the children which\nare born in the capital cities of Europe, nearly one half die in early infancy ? To\nwhat elfe can we attribute this extraordinary mortality ? Such an amazing proportion\nof premature deaths is a circumftance unheard of among favage nations, or among\nthe young of other animals ! In the earlieft ages, we are informed, that human life\nwas protraded to a very extraordinary length ; yet how few perfons, in thefe latter\ntimes, arrive at that period which nature feems to have defigned ! Man is by na-\nture a field-animal, and feems deftined to rife with the fun, and to fpend a large\nportion of his time in the open air, to inure his body to robuft exercifes and the\ninclemency of the feafons, and to make a plain homely repaft only when hunger\ndidates. But art has ftudioufly defeated the kind intentions of nature ; and by\nenflaving him to all the blandilbments of fenfe, has left him, alas ! an eafy vidim\nto folly and caprice. Let the confideration of the following fubjeds dired every\none, who values health and long life, to purfue the means nature has pointed out,\nfor their prefervation and fuftenance.\nOf NUTRITION.\nNUTRITION, in the animal ceconomy, is the acceffion of new parts to the\nbody, either for its augmentation, or for the reparation of fuch as are worn off,\nor exhaled through the pores and perfpiring veffels, whereby the fluids are dimi-\nnifhed, and the body falls away. So that, to preferve life, it is neceflary that a\nreftitution be made to the juices and folids of the body, at leafl: equal to what is\nloft by thofe motions, which is what we call the action of nutrition. Now the\nloft juices are eafily and quickly fupplied by aliment, air, &c. but the nutrition\n3 of\n* , \u2022\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. t$5\nof the folid parts is much more obfcure. This, indeed, has proved a fubjeCt of\ninfinite doubts and differences among authors \u2022, nor had we any rational or iatisfac-\ntory account of the fame, till that of the accurate Boerhaave, whofe doCtrine is as\nfollows.\nEvery folid part of the body conflfts of other fmaller ones, in all refpeCts like the\nlarger \u2022, veffels, of veficles, and thole of others ft ill fmaller ; bones, of ofticles, &c.\nWhich ftruCture goes beyond all limits of fenl'e, however aflifted by art\n;\nas appears\nby the experiments and obfervations of Malpighi, Ruyfch, Leeuwenhoeck, and\nHook. Yet it is fcarce poflible this divifion and fubdivifion fhould be infinite, as\nthofe of foods and juices are. Again, it appears from microfCopes, injections,\nfmall wounds, exficcations, &c. that the folid parts of the body* are very fmall,\ncompared with the fluids-, and it is alfo demonftrable, from confidering the rife\n'\nand generation of the veflels, and the refolution of the greater veflels into their\nfmaller conftituent ones, that all the folid mafs of the body is conflruCted of mere\nnerves, as its elements. And, in effeCt, all this mafs, an incredible fmall particle\nonly excepted, at firft, arofe out of what was a very fmall colliquament, much like\nthe nervous juice itfelf ; as is abundantly fhewn by the great Malpighi, in his two\ntreatifes on incubated eggs. For neither does the white of the egg nourifh, till by-\nmeans of the incubation, it have pafied innumerable degrees of fluidity, from its\nfirft thicknefs, to that exceeding fubtilty wherein it terminates. But, even then,\nthe liquor, thus given to the embryo, is exceedingly thick, in comparifon with\nwhat it is to be, when converted into its veflels and vifcera. Now, the firft tender\nfolids, arifing from this fubtile humour, do again pals infinite intermediate degrees,\nbefore they arrive at their utmoft ftate and confiftence as is fhewn by Malpighi in\neggs, and by Ruyfch in embryoes and foetufes. Hence, therefore, it follows, that\nthe folids, in their firft formation out of the liquids whence they arife, only differ\nfrom them in reft, cohefion, and figure. Therefore fuch a particle, now in its\nfluid ftate, will become a part of the folid to be formed out of it, as foon as there\nhappens to be a power to effeCt its cohefion with the other folid parts, howfoever\nthat cohefion be effected.\nThis cohefion is eafily produced in a fibre already formed, if there happen to be\na proper cavity in the folid, left open by fome loft particle, and, at the lame time,\na particle in the fluid, anfwerable thereto in bulk, figure, and nature ; and, laftly,\nif there be a power wherewithal to intrude it into that place, or accommodate ic\nthereto. Thus will arife a real nutrition of the folids in the minute veffels, by\nwhofe union the large ones are formed -, that is, in the nerves, or in veffels fimilar\nthereto. Which being impracticable by any other liquid than that brought into\nthefe veffels, it appears very evident, that the nervous juice, at leaff a juice perfect-\nly\n\f-.156 A KEY TO PH Y S l C,\n]y like it, is the immediate matter of nutrition : whence nutrition appears one of the\nlad and mod perfe<ft actions of the body ; fince, to have this laudable, all the pre-\ncedent actions mud of neceffity have been fo. The chyle, therefore, which fome\nmake the immediate matter of nutrition, is, indeed, fitted to fill the larger vefiels ;\nbut it cannot nourifh or reftore them. This, when attenuated, changed, more\nintimately mixed in the lungs by means of refpiration, and thus fitted for the\npaffage of certain vefiels, is indeed rendered fitter, yet far from being quite fit to\nbe the matter of nutrition. 'But, by the repeated adtion of the lungs, the vifcera,\nvefiels, &c. there is formed, out of this humour, a foft, tenacious, pladic, infipid,\nferum, which, thickening by the fire, becomes perfectly like the white of an egg.\nThis fluid, therefore, has in it all the conditions found in that, from whence, by\nfure experience, we know all the folid parts of an animal arife by mere incubation.\nIt is, therefore, a dep nearer; but is not yet quite difpofed for nutriment \u2022, much\nlefs is the cruor, or red globular part of the blood fo. Neither are yet fitted to\nenter. the vefiels; yet both the one and the other are, by different authors, made\nthe nutritive juice. But as the heat of the incubation, fo the adtion of the vifcera\nand vefiels on the ferum, introduces various changes therein, till at length a part\nof it be rendered fubtile enough for the purpofe required. This, when exhauded,\nis indantly repaired : and thus we have the true immediate matter of nutrition.\nThe matter of nutrition thus afcertained, the manner wherein, and the caufe\nwhereby it is effected, are as follows : a juice being driven diredtly through a full,\nconic, or cylindric, eladic or rigid, canal ; if its courfe be from a wider to a nar-\nrower part, or if it have any thing to oppofe its motion, will endeavour to dretch\nthe fides of its canal, according to the axis of its length. This mud be the cafe\nevery where in the body, except, perhaps, in the veins and receptacles. By this\nnifus or endeavour, how weak foever, continually repeated, the vefiels will be\ninfenfibly lengthened out ; and, in lengthening, they will be made more and more\nflender. Hence the lad extremities of the vefiels, which in man are extremely\nfmall, are continually dretched, and rendered lefs and lefs coherent, i. e. dill\nnearer and nearer to a diffolution ; and thus at length will they cohere fo weakly,\nas fcarce to differ from fluids. While fuch motion goes on, therefore, and the\npropulfion is continued, there will, of neceffity, happen thefe two things : fird,\nthe outmod particles of the minuted tubes, being torn off, will again be converted\ninto a kind of humour, what part of the body foever they dick in. Secondly, the\nfmalled particles, which, by their union, compofed the flendered fibrillae, will be\nfo feparated from each other, as to leave open interdices in thofe places, where,\nbefore, they cohered. Both thefe effe&s will be produced at all times, and in all\nparts of the body, fo long as life continues, efpecially where nature is drong, and\nthe\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. i 5y\nthe adlions of the body violent. But the fame humour whereby thefe efforts are pro-\nduced containing abundance of particles fimilar to thofe thus feparated and loft, con-\nveys and applies them to thofe interftices, by that very impetus whereby it endeavours\nto diftend the canals ; and thus intercepted, at length, it forms, adapts, and faftens,\nthem, fo as to adhere in the fame manner as the former, The matter, preparation,\napplication, energy of motion, ftill remaining the fame ; what, from time to time,\nis loft, is thus prefently reftored \u2022, and the folids continue in the fame date as before,\nthat is, they are perpetually nourifhed, and fupplied, and preferved.\nIn this the Creator\u2019s wifdom is very confplcuousi in that the fame power which\ninevitably deftroys, does repair again at the fame time, and by the fame artion ;\nand that the greater the lofs is, the more copious the fupply-, and, laftly, that\nthofe parts firft fpent in the adion of the body, are the firft reftored. Farther, it\nis evident, that the newer, the more tender, and the nearer to the moving caufe,\nthefe veftels are, the more eafily will they be lengthened, diftended, dellroyed, and\nrepaired : our bodies, therefore, the nearer to their origin, the more do they grow.\nFor, the adion ftill continuing, the greater veftels become more extended by their\nfluid \u2022, and at the fame time, the fmaller, whereof the membranes, or coats, of the\nlarger fort are compofed, are compreffed, dried, and at haft, concreted, and grow'\nup ; whence arifes a firmnefs, indeed, of the fibres, but a lofs of the veficles. Thus\nwhat were formerly veftels, commence mere hard ligaments ; and thus the fluids\nbeing once fixed, the feveral veftels coalefce \u2022, from the concurrence of thefe caufes\narife the ftrength, hardnefs, rigidity, and thicknefs, of the folid parts. Hence the\nnumber of veftels is greateft in embryoes, and, as age comes on, it fenfibly dimi-\nnifhes; and hence it is, that their weaknefs conftandy declines, and their ftrength\nand firmnefs increafe. In young people, therefore, the quantity of humours is\nredundant, and greatly exceeds the folids : in old men, the folids exceed the fluids.\nAnd hence we fee the reafon, manner, and appearance, of growth, ftate, declenfion,\nand, at length, of death, from pure old age.\nA perfon who conflders this account, and compares it with what is artually ob-\nfervable in the body, will find every circumftance to obtain : thus the whole cuti-\ncula is every where, and at all times, conftantly defquamating, peeling off\u2019, and\nagain renewing-, and thus the hair, nails, teeth, continually rubbed, torn, and\nworn, off, come again : parts taken off from the veftels and the bones foon grow\nagain : and the fordes, or filth, rubbed off from the extremities of the veftels,\nwhen examined by a microfcope, or diluted, and viewed in -water, appear plainly to\nconflft both of folid and fluid parts , and thole carried off by waffling, (having, &c.\nare the fame. Flence, too, we fee, that a general increafe of the bulk of the body,\nwith regard to habit, as in fat, flefhy, brawny, perfons, does not arife from any\nNo. ix. Ss increafe\n\f1.58 A K E Y T O P H Y S I C,\n, 9\nincreafe of the folia\u2019s, but by their extenfion into larger cavities, crouded with ftag-\nnant humours. And hence fatnefs becomes hurtful, as it loads, weakens, and\nfuffocates. Whence arifes a very confiderable diftindtion between nutrition and\nrepletion, to which a phyfician muft have fpecial regard*, the one ftrengthening\nand Gondenfmg the vefiels, the other weakening, loofening, and extending, the\nfame. Hence, laflly, we lee, why the fabric of the folids is not deftroyed by the\ncontained fluids ; how our machine comes to fubftft fo long ; why, when a nerve\nis corrupted, the nutrition of that part it belongs to ceafes ; and why the fame\nobtains in an artery \u2022, why in an embryo there are no folids, in a foetus very few,\nin old men a great deal ; and why even the nerves, tendons, arteries, and recep-\ntacles, become firft cartilaginous, and then bony. Dr. Prieftley concludes, from\nfome experiments undertaken with a view of difcovering the principle of nutrition,\nin vegetable and animal fubftances, that this principle is phlogifton, in fuch a ftate\nas to be capable of becoming, by putrefaftion, a true inflammable air, but not\ngenerally fuch as to burn with explofions \u2022, but rather with a blue and lambent\nflame, mixed with a certain proportion of fixed air. This principle in nutrition\nis immediately held in folution by the gaftric juice, and in the chyle formed by it;\nand when it has entered into the circulation with the chyle, and anfwered the pur-\n\"pofe in the animal ceconomy for which it is defigned, it is thrown out again by\nmeans of the blood in the lungs, and communicated to the air, which is phlogifti-\ncated with it.\nOf FOOD, or ALIMENT.\nFROM aliment or food, by the procefs of digeftion, is prepared a very mild,\nfweet, and whitilh, liquor, refembling milk, and diftinguifhed by the name of\nchyle ; which being abforbed by the iafteal veins, by them conveyed into the cir-\nculation, and there aflimilated into the nature of blood, affords that fupply of nu-\ntrition, which, as we have feen above, the continual wafte of the body is found to\nrequire. Food is the molt neceffary thing for the prefervation of our bodies : and\nas on the choice thereof our health greatly depends, it is of much importance to un-\nderftand, in general, what is the propereft for our nourifhment ; and, in particular\ndeviations from health, what is the beft adapted to reftore us. Our blood and\njuices naturally incline to become putrid and acrimonious : frefh chyle, duly re-\nceived, prevents this deftruiflive tendency, and preferves in them that mild ftate\nwhich alone confifts with health. An animal diet affords the moft of this bland\nnutritious mucilage ;\nwatery fluids dilute the two grofs parts, and carry off what\nis become unfit for ufe. It is only the fmall portion of jelly which is feparated from\nthe farinaceous parts of vegetables, that, after being much elaborated, is con-\nverted\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 159\nverted into the animal nature ; yet the ufe of vegetables prevents both repletion and\na too great tendency to a putrefcent acrimony of the blood. In hot climates, as\nwell as againft the conftitutional heat of particular perfons, vegetables are demand-\ned in the largeft portion*, animal fubftances afford the higheft relifh while our ap-\npetite continues ; but will fate the appetite before the ftomach is duly filled. Ve-\ngetables may be eaten after either flefhor fifh : few herbs or fruits fatiate fo much\nas that the ftomach may not be filled with them, when it is already fatisfied with\nflefh or fifh \u2022, whence it may be obferved, that no diet which is very nourifhing can\nbe eat to fulnefs, becaufe its nutritious parts are oily and fatiating. Health depends\nalmoft wholly on a proper crafts of the blood \u2022, and to preferve this, a mixture of\nvegetables in fome degree is always required, for a loathing is foon the confequence\nof animal food alone : hot acrid habits, too, receive from milk and vegetables the\nneedful for corre&ing their exceffes ; but in cold, pituitous, and nervous, habits,\nwho want moft nourifhment from leaft digeftion, and from the fmalleft quantity\nof food, animal diet is to be ufed more freely.\nAs the blood, the nutritive juice, and in general all the parts of the body, are\nmade up of three elements, viz. of one which is fulphureous, oily, and inflam-\nmable ; of one of an earthy, fubtile, alkaline, nature \u2022 and of one of an aquaeous\nnature : fo the feveral kinds and virtues of food may be moft commodioufly re-\nduced to thefe three claffes \u2022, and aliments of thefe three feveral qualities, duly mix-\ned with one another, afford a proper nourifhment for the human body.\u2014The flefh\nof animals, efpecially when roafted, affords the body its principal fupply of the\nfulphureous part ; but it is to be obferved, that wild animals are preferable in this\nrefped to the tame and domeftic kind, becaufe their oils and falts are exalted by\nhabitual exercife. Among the aliments which furnifh the blood with its humid\nparts, of animals, fifh ; and of vegetables, pot-herbs, the milder roots, and fome\nfummer-fruits, are reckoned the principal. To the third clafs, which fupplies the\nblood with its fixed and earthy parts, belong all kinds of grains, as the feveral forts\nof bread, rice, peas, beans, lentils, chefnuts, almonds, cacoa, cheefe, &c. From\nwhat has been faid, it will appear that all fuch aliments as are of a mild quality,\nand refemble the chyle and blood, are fit for nourifhment that all fuch food as\neither recedes from, or is quite oppofite to, the nature of the chyle and blood, is\nunfit for nourifhing the parts j that all food in which there is too much of an acid,\nis improper for nourifhment, becaufe milk and blood will not mix with an acid\nwhich is quite oppofite to their natures, and induces a coagulation of the circulat-\ning juices-, that all falts, and all foods too highly faked, muft be unfit for nou-\nrifhment, becaufe no fait whatever can be mixed with the biopd, chyle, and milk-,\n2 and\n\fi6o A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nand laftly, that the free ufe of fpirits muft be very det imental both to health- and\nriourifhment, becaufe blood and chyle never incorporate with fpirituous liquors, but\nrather feparate from them.\nThis much being obvious as general principles with refped to the matter and\nquality of our aliment, the valetudinarian may eafily regulate his diet with fome ad-\nvantage to himfelf by an attention to the few enfuing particulars. In winter, eat\nfreely, but drink fparingly : roaft meat is to be preferred, and what is drank fhould\nbe ftronger than at other feafons. In fummer, let third; determine the quantity to\nbe drunk \u2022, cold ftomachs never require much : boiled meats and vegetables, if\nnot otherwife contradicted, may now be more freely ufed. Lax habits require\nthe winter\u2019s diet to be continued all the year, and rigid ones fhould be confined to\nthat of fummer. Fat people fhould fa ft at times, but the lean fhould never do fo.\nThofe who are troubled with erudationsoccafioned by their food fhould drink but\nlittle, and ufe fome unaccuftomed exercife. The thirfty fhould drink freely, but\neat fparingly. In general, let moderation be obferved ; and though no dinner hath\nbeen had, a light fupper'is at all times to be preferred. After very high-feafoned\nmeats, a glafs of water acidulated with the acid elixir of vitriol, or in very weak\nftomachs the fweet elixir of vitriol, is far more afliftant to the work of digeftion\nthan the common method of taking brandy.\nAs to common drink, water alone is fufficient and effectual for all the purpofes of\nnature. Strong liquors were never defigned for common ufe. They were formerly\nkept here in England, as other medicines are, in apothecaries (hops, and prefcrib-\ned by phyficians, as they do diafcordium, and Venice treacle, to refrefhthe weary,\nftrengthen the weak, and raife the low-fpirited. The effed of the ordinary ufe of\nwine, and fpirituous liquors, as natural caufes will always produce their effeds,\nis to inflame the body into gout, ftone, and rbeumatifm, fevers, pleurifies, fmall-\npox. See. to dry up the juices, and fcorch and fhrivel thefolids. Thofe whofe ap-\npetite and digeftion are good and entire, never want ftrong liquors to fupply them\nwith fpirits ;\nfuch fpirits are too volatile and fugitive, for any folid or ufeful pur-\npofes of life. Two ounces of flefh-meat, well digefted, beget a greater ftock of\nmore durable and ufeful fpirits, than ten times as much ftrong liquors.\nAll ftrong liquors are as hard to digeft, and require as much labour of the con-\ncodive powers, as ftrong food itfelf. Water is the only univerfal diffolvent, or\nmenftruum, and the moft certain diluter of all bodies proper for food. There are\na great many fpirituous liquors, which not only will not diftblve, but which will\nharden, and make more indigeftible, certain parts, efpecially the falts of bodies,\nwherein their adive qualities, that is, thofe which can do moft harm to human con-\nftitutions.\n\fAN D OCCULT SCIENCE. 162\nftitutions, confift. And we have known perfons of tender conftitutions, who could\nneither eat, nor digeft, upon drinking wine, who, by drinking at meals common\nwater, warmed, have recovered their appetites and digeftion, and have thriven,\nand grown plump. It is true, ftrong liquors, by their heat, and flimulation on the\norgans of conco&ion, by increafing the velocity of the motion of the fluids, and\nthereby quickening the other animal functions, will carry off the load that lies upon\nthe ftomach, with more prefent chearfulnefs. But then, befide the future damages\nof fuch a quantity of wine to the ftomach, and the fluids, by its heat, and inflam-\nmation, the food is hurried into the habit unconcocted, and lays a foundation for\na fever, a fit of the cholic, or fome chronical difeafe. With refpecl to fermented\nliquors, which are commonly ufed, it may be obferved, that thofe which are too\nftrong hurt digeftion, and are fo far from ftrengthening the body, that they weaken\nand relax it. They keep up a conftant fever, which exhaufts the fpirits, heats and\ninflames the blood, difpofes to numberlels difeafes, and occafions a premature old\nage. But fermented liquors may be too weak, as well as too ftrong : thefe muft\neither be drank new, before the fermentation is over, and in this cafe will generate\nair in the bowels, and occafion flatulencies ; or they foon become ftale, four the\nftomach, and injure digeftion. On this account all malt-liquors, cyder, &c. fhould\nbe fufficiently ftrong, to keep till they are ripe, and then they fhould be ufed \u2022, and\nneither fooner nor later. Liquors that are adulterated with a mixture of ingredi-\nents of the opiate kind, which are poifonous in their quality, by thofe who make\nthem for fale, hurt the nerves, relax and weaken the ftomach, and fpoil its digef-\ntive powers.\nA due regulation of the quantity and quality of our meat and drink, and a nice\nadjuftment thereof to the concodtive powers, is of the utmoft confequence to health\nand long life. What we expend in motion, excretion, effluvia, &c. is but a deter-\nminate quantity *, and the fupply fhould only keep pace with the expence : a juft:\nproportion of the two would, probably, preferve us from acute diftempers, as it\ncertainly would from chronical ones*, moft, or all, of which, proceed from reple-\ntion, as appears from their being cured by evacuation.\nPhyficians have attempted to determine the healthful quantity of food for a hu-\nman body. Some fay, that in winter, where the perfpiration of an unexercifed per-\nfon is only equal to the urine, the diet for twenty-four hours ought not to exceed four\npounds, or four pounds and a half. In fummer, the diet may be fix pounds and\na half, which may be carried off without the help of exercife, when the air is hot\nand dry. If the quantity of food be fuch as to make the perfpiration and urine of\na natural day always nearly equal, and the morning weight of the body always\nnearly the fame, that quantity is the truly healthful quantity of food for grown\nNo. 11. Tt bodies.\n\f162 A K E Y T O PHYSIC,\nbodies, which ufe but little exercife. The quantity of food neceffary to keep a\ngrown body in health, will be better and more eafily digefted, when it is fo divided\nas to make the meals equal, than when they are very unequal. The diftance be-\ntween one meal and another fhould bear fome proportion to the largenefs of the pre-\nceding meal. Good and conftant health confifts in a juft quantity o^ food, and a\njuft proportion of the meat to the drink-, and in order to be freed from chronical\ndiforders contracted by intemperance, the quantity of food ought to be leffened,\nand the proportion of the meat to the drink increafed more or lefs, according to\nthe greatnefs of the dilorders -, and both the quantity of food, and the proportion\nof meat to the drink, ought to be fuch as fhall make perfpiration and urine nearly\nequal at all feafons of the year.\nThe quantity of animal food confumed by the Englifh is generally pernicious,\nbecaufe it produces but little of that air which is antifeptic : hence they are fubject\nto the fcurvy, and its numerous train of confequences, indigeftion, low fpirits,\nhypochondriacifm, &c. whereas if vegetables and milk, whofe antifeptic quality,\narifing from the gas or air which they plentifully afford, were more ufed as food,\nwe fhould have lefs fcurvy, and likewife fewer putrid and inflammatory fevers.\nOne great reafon why leprofies, hot fcurvies, dyfenteries, plagues, peftilential\nfevers, and the like diftempers, formerly fo frequent in London, are now fo rare,\nis the change that has been made in the food of the inhabitants. Hopped beer,\nwine, and fpirituous liquors coming into general ufe, have been a great means of\nfupprefiing putrid difeafes; greens and fruit are likewife more univerfally eat, and\nfalted meats make a much lefs part of our food than formerly: to which may be\nadded the more general confumption of tea and fugar.\nVegetable food is moft proper for fcorbutic and hedtical perfons, and does very\nwell with people who have much exercife ; but in other circumftances, a mixed\ndiet of vegetable and animal fubftances, fuch as is commonly ufed, feems beft cal-\nculated to nourifh and preferve the body from decay.\nThe fofter and milder kinds of aliment are proper for children, and for youth\nthe ftronger. Old people ought to lefien the quantity of their food, and increafe\nthat of their drink : but yet fome allowance is to be made for cuftom, efpecially in\ncold climates i for as in thefe the appetite is keener, fo is the digeftion ftronger\nand better performed.\nDifferent fexes alfo require a different food and regimen. Women are weaker\nthan men, and for that reafon require a food and regimen peculiar to themfelves\n;\nthey are of a fpungy and lax habit, and for the moft part addidted to indolence and\npleafure, drink little, have bodies of a highly delicate and fenflble nature, much\ninclined to fpafms, and convulfive motions, and difpofed to generate a redundance\nof\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 16$\nof blood. Befide, at certain ftated times, they have a regular evacuation by the\nveins of the uterus \u2022,\nand in confequence of thefe circumftances it is neceffary that\nwomen, rather than men,lhould obferve a regimen and method of living, peculiar-\nly and accurately adapted to their habit and conftitution.\nHence it is obvious, that the phyfician acts a prepofterous and unaccountable\npart, who to every one prefcribes the fame method of living \u2022, or thinks, that what\ncontributes to the health ofone, will without diftinbtion or referve prove falutary to\nall. For we are fufficiently taught by daily experience, that all fubftances are not\nequally adapted to all patients ; and that what one may bear without being fenfible\nof any bad effects, may to another prove prejudicial, and even fatal. Time itfelf\nhas a confiderable influence in determining the falutary or noxious effects of ali-\nments ; fince fome fubftances may fafely, and without any bad confequence, be\nufed at one feafon, which at another may contribute not a little to the deftrudtion\nof health.\nAs to the effedts of food on the mind, it is plain, that delicacy of feeling, live-\nlinefs of imagination, quicknefs of apprehenflon, and acutenefs ofjudgment, more\nfrequently accompany a weak ftate of the body. True it is, indeed, that the fame\nftate is liable to timidity, fluctuation, and doubt ; while the ftrong have that fteadi-\nnefs of judgment, and firmnefs of purpofe, which are proper for the higher and\nmore adtive fcenes of life. The moft valuable ftate of the mind, however, ap-\npears to refide in fomewhat lefs firmnefs and vigour of body. Vegetable aliment,\nas never over-diftending the veftfels or loading the fyftem, never interrupts the\nftronger motions of the mind ; while the heat, fulnefs, and weight, of animal food,\nare an enemy to its vigorous efforts. Temperance, then, does not fo much confift\nin the quantity, for that always will be regulated by ouf appetite, as in the quality,\nviz. a large proportion of vegetable aliment.\nOf AIR.\nIT is no eafy talk to afcertain the nature and origin of air, as being a fluid im-\nperceptible to all our fenfes, except that of feeling. Indeed, from the refinance\nand impreffion it makes, we know that there is fuch a body, which every where\nfurrounds our earth, and is of the utmoft importance not only to mankind, in pro-\nmoting many ufeful arts, but abfolutely neceffary for the prefervation of health\nand life.\nThe wholefomenefs or unwholefomenefs of air, is certainly owing to the differ-\nent effluvia with which it abounds, and ought to be particularly attended to by the\nvaletudinarian. The beft air is to be met with in open champaign countries\nwhere the foil is dry, not parched or fandy, and fpontaneoufty produces wild\n2 thyme.\n\f1 64 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthyme, wild marjoram, and the like fweet-fcented plants. That near rivers is\nrather prejudicial, unlefs they are fmall, clear, and have a gravelly channel. The\nmorning air is deemed more refrefhing than that of the evening, and air agitated\nwith breezes, than that which is ferene and ftill. As good air contributes greatly\nto health, fo that which is bad is no lefs prejudicial to it. Stagnating air is pro-\nductive of putrid and malignant diforders, as dyfenteries, bilious fevers, &c. and\nthat which is too moift, of inflammatory ones, as coughs, rheumatifms, &c.\nMoift and rainy feafons, however, differ widely in this refpeCt ; fince in marfhy\ncountries, intenfe and continued heats occafion the greateft moifture in the air\n:\nwhereas frequent fhowers, during the hot feafon, cool it, check the excefs of va-\npour, dilute and refrefh the corrupted ftagnating water, and precipitate all noxious\nand putrid effluvia.\nTo the preffureof air, we are to attribute the coherence of the parts of bodies.\nBreathing too, on which depends animal life, is owing to the preffure and fpring\nof the air; and to the fame caufe may be attributed the production of fire and\nflame, as appears from the fudden extinction of a coal or candle in the exhaufted\nreceiver. It is likewife neceffary for the exiftence and propagation of founds, for\nthe germination and growth of plants, for conveying all the variety of fmells, and\nfor tranfmitting the rays and influence of the celeftial bodies. In fhort, fuch is the\ngenerating and vivifying power of air, that fome of the ancient philofophers confi-\ndered it as the firft principle of all things. Air not only aCts upon all bodies by its\ncommon properties of weight and elalticity, but by the peculiar virtues of the in-\ngredients whereof it is compofed. By means of a corroding acid it diflolves iron\nand copper, unlefs well defended by oil. Even gold, in the chymifts laboratory,\nwhen the air is impregnated with the effluvia of aqua regia, contracts a rufl: like\nother bodies. It fixes volatile bodies, and volatilizes thofe which are fixed. From\nthe different effluvias, diffufed through the air, proceed a variety of effeCts. Near\nmines of copper, it will difcolour filver and brafs ; and in London, the air of\nwhich abounds with acid and corrofive particles, metalline utenfils rufl; fooner than\nin the country. It is very difficult to obtain oil of fulphur in a clear dry air, as its\nparts are then more ready to evaporate ; whereas, in a moift cloudy air, it may be\nobtained in abundance. All falts melt moft readily in cloudy weather ; and fepa-\nrations fucceed beft in the fame ftate of the air. If pure wine be carried into a place\nwhere the air is full of the fumes of wine then fermenting, it will begin to fer-\nment afrefh.\nWherever air ftagnates long, it becomes unwholefome. Hence the unhappy\nperfons confined in goals not only contract malignant fevers themfelves, but ofcen\ncommunicate them to others. Nor are many of the holes, for we cannot call them\nhoufes.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nhoufes, poflefied by ^he poor in great towns, much better than gaols. Thefe low\ndirty habitations are the very lurking-places of bad air and contagious difeafes.\nSuch as live in them feldom enjoy good health j and their children commonly die\nyoung. In the choice of a houfe, thofe who have it in their power ought alv\/ays to\npay the greateft attention to open free air. The various methods which luxury has\ninvented to make houfes dofe and warm, contribute not a little to render them un-\nwholefome. No houfe can be wholefome unlefs the air has a free paffage through\nit. For which reafon houfes ought daily to be ventilated, by opening oppofite\nwindows, and admitting a current of frefli air into every room. Beds, inftead of\nbeing made up as foon as people rife out of them, ought to be turned down, and\nexpofed to the frefli air from the open windows through the day. This would ex-\npel any noxious vapour, and could not fail to promote the health of the inhabitants.\nIn hofpitals, gaols, {hips, &c. where that cannot be conveniently done, venti-\nlators fhould be ufed. The method of expelling foul, and introducing frefh, air,\nby means of ventilators, is a moil falutary invention, and is indeed the moft ufeful\nof all our modem medical improvements. It is capable of univerfal application,\nand is fraught with numerous advantages, both to thofe in health and in ficknefs.\nIn all places where numbers of people are crowded together, ventilation becomes\nabfolutely neceflary. Air which ftagnates in mines, wells, cellars, &c. is ex-\ntremely noxious. That kind of air is to be avoided as the moft deadly poifon. It\noften kills almoft as quickly as lightning. For this reafon, people fhould be very\ncautious in opening cellars that have been long fhut, or going down into deep\nwells, or pits, efpecially if they have been kept clofe covered. We have daily\naccounts of perfons who lofe their lives by going down into deep wells and other\nplaces where the air ftagnates ;\nall thefe accidents might be prevented by only let-\nring down a lighted candle before them, and flopping when they perceive it go out 5\nyet this precaution, Ample as it is, is feldom ufed.\nIf frefh air be neceflary for thofe in health, it is ftill more fo for the fick, who\noften lofe their lives for want of it. The notion that fick people muft be kept very\nhot, is fo common, that one can hardly enter the chamber where a patient lies,\nwithout being ready to faint, by reafon of the hot luffocating fmell. How this\nmuft affe\u00a3t the fick any one may judge. No medicine is fo beneficial to the fick\nas frefh air. It is the moft reviving of all cordials, if it be adminiftered with pru-\ndence. We are not, however, to throw open doors and windows at random upon\nthe fick. Frefh air is to be let into the chamber gradually, and, if poflible, by\nopening the windows of fome other apartment.\nThere are many kinds of air, produced by accidental or artificial caufes, of\nwhich the following are the moft material\n:\nNo. n. U u DephlogijliCiited\n\f1 66 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nDephlogifticated air,\nwhich is an elaftic fluid naturally extricated in the pro-\ncefs of vegetation, artificially procured from nitre, minium, magnefia, water,\nThis is eminently capable of fupporting flame and animal life, and is one of the\ncomponent parts of our atmofphere.\nPhlogifticated air, is produced in great quantities during putrefaction and fer-\nmentation, and is alfo obtained in the calcination of metals and other phlogiltic\nprocefles. It deltroys animal life, and extinguifhes flame, but is very friendly\nto vegetation, and is another of the component pares of our atmofphere.\nFixed or fixable air,\nderives its name from the property of adhering to certain\nbodies, and fixing irfelf in them. It confilts of dephlogifticated air united to char-\ncoal \u2022, this is obtained by fermentation, and in all phlogiftic procefles, and ma-\ntt ifefts the properties of an acid. It extinguifhes flame and deftroys animal life.\nInflammable air, confifts wholly of charcoal and water, rarified by heat *, and is\nremarkable for being the lighted; of all gravitating fubfiances. It is produced\nnaturally from all putrid waters, and may be artificially procured from certain\nmetallic folutions, by palling the fleam of water over red hot iron, and by\ndiflilling wood, pit coal, &c. with a ftrong heat, or by oppofing charcoal to the\nheat of a burning lens in vacuo.

By union with fome metals it is. converted\ninto volatile alkali. In fome cafes it may be made to fupport flame, and even,\nanimal life. Its property of condenfing with dephlogifticated air, renders it a\nteft of the falubrity of the atmofphere.\nMarine acid air, is the fame as marine acid reduced into vapour, and deprived\nof moft of its waters.\nDephlogifticated marine acid air, is fuppofed by fome, to be the marine acid de-\nprived of its phlogifton ;\nby others, to be the fame acid, with an addition of\npure air. It deftroys many kinds of colours, and with inflammable air, re-\ngenerates common marine acid*\nAlkaline air, is the fame with pure volatile alkali, and is formed by an union\nof phlogifticated and inflammable air.\nHepatic air, is produced from the decompofttion of liver of fulphur by acids j\nand in the common atmofphere, it is inflammable, but does not burn with\nexplofion*\nAtmofpherical\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 167\nJimojpherical is compofed of dephlogifticated and phlogifticated air, and\nthus fupporrs and fuftains bath animal life and vegetation.\nThe exterior part of our habitable world is the air or atmofphere, a fpringy\nbody, that incompaffes the folid earth on all Tides, and is near a thoufand times\nlighter than water ; and the higher it is, the lels it is compreffed by the fuperior\nIncumbent air; and fo confequently it being a fpringy body, the thinner it is.\nAnd as a pillar of air of any diameter is equal in weight to a pillar of quickfilver\nof the fame diameter of between twenty-nine and thirty inches high, we may\ninfer that the top of the atmofphere is not very near the furface of the folid\nearth. Now as quickfilver being near fourteen times heavier than water, the\natmofphere would be about fourteen times higher than the column of quickfilver,\nthat is, about thirty-four feet ; and if we confider that air is a thoufand times\nlighter than water, then a pillar of air, equal in weight to a pillar of quick-\nfilver of thirty inches high, will be fix thoufand eight hundred feet, whereby\nvve come to know that the air or atmofphere is fix thoufand eight hundred\nfeet, that is near feven miles high : and if we confider that the air is a fpringy\nbody, and that which is neareft the earth is compreffed by the weight of all\nthe atmofphere above it, we fhall find that the air near the furface of the earth\nis much denfer and thicker than it is in the upper regions. On this theory\nmay be accounted why great cities are not fo healthful to refide in, as fmall\ntowns and country villages, and why London is much more prejudicial to\nhealth, owing to the many works containing noxious effluvia poffeffed of\nthe component parts mentioned in the different kinds of air, and confequently\nforms an air to breathe in that is not congenial to the life of Man.\nOf EXERCISE.\nEXERCISE may be faid to be either active or paffive. The active is walking,..\nhunting, dancing, playing at bowls, and the like; as alio fpeaking, and other\nlabour of the body and mind. The paffive is riding in a coach, on horleback,\nor in any other manner. Exercife may be continued to a beginning of vvearinel\u2019s,\nand ought to be ufed before dinner in a pure light air ; for which reafon, journeys,\nand going into the country, contribute greatly to preferve and re-eftabliffl health.\nExercife increafes the circulation of the blood, attenuates and divides the fluids,\nand promotes a regular perfpiration, as well as a due fecretion of all the humours^\nfor it accelerates the animal fpirits, and facilitates their diftribution into all the\nfibres of the body, {Lengthens the parts, creates an appetite, and helps digeftion.\nWhence it arifes, that thofe who accuftom themfelves to exercife are generally\nvery robuft, and feldom fubjedtto difeafes.\n1 Boerhaave\n\f*63 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nBoerhaave recommends bodily exercife in difeafes of a weak and lax fibre. By\nriding on horfeback, the pendulous vifcera of the abdomen are Ihaken every mo-\nment, and gently rubbed as it were one againft another, while in the mean time\nthe pure air a<5ts on the lungs with greater force. But it is to be obferved that a\nweak man ffiould not ride with a full ftomach, but either before dinner, or after\nthe digeftion is near finifhed; for when the ftomach is diftended, weak people do\nnot bear thefe concufiions of the horfe without difficulty.; but when the primae vise\nare near empty, the remaining faeces are difcharged by this concuffion. Sailing in\na fhip is alfo an exercife of great ufe to weak people. .If the veflel moves with an\neven motion, by increafing perfpiration it ufually excites a wonderful alacrity,\ncreates an appetite, and promotes digeftion. Thefe exercifes are more efpecially\nferviceable to weak people ; but, in order to ftrengthen the body by mufcular mo-\ntion, running, and bodily exercifes, are to be ufed. In thefe we ffiould begin\nwith the moft gentle, fuch as walking, and increafe it by degrees till we come to\nrunning. Thole exercifes of the body are more efpecially ferviceable which give\n.delight to the mind at the fame time, as tennis, fencing, &c. for which reafon,\nthe wifdom of antiquity appointed rewards for thole who excelled in thefe gym-\nuaftic exercifes, that b.y this means the bodies of their youth might be hardened for\nwarlike toils.\nAs nothing is more conducive to health than moderate exercife, fo -violent exer-\n.ciie diffipates the fpirits, weakens the body, deftroys the elafticity of the fibres,\nand exhaufts the fluid parts of the blood. No wonder, then, that acute and mor-\ntal fevers often arife from too violent exercife of the body ; for the motion of the\nvenous blood towards the heart being quickened by the contraction of the mufcles,\nand the veins being thus depleted, the arteries more eafily propel their contained\nhumours through the fmalleft extremities into the now lefs refilling veins ; and\ntherefore the velocity of the circulation will be increafed through all the vefieis.\nBut this cannot be performed without applying the humours oftener, or in a\ngreater quantity, to the fecretory organs in the fame time, whence the more fluid\nparts of the blood will be diffipated, and what remains will be infpifiated ; and by\nthe greater aftion of the vefieis upon their contained fluids, and of the re-adting\nfluids upon the vefieis, the blood acquires an inflammatory denfity. Add to this,\nthat by the violent attrition of the folids and fluids, together with the heat thence\narifing, all the humours will incline to a greater acrimony, and the fairs and oils\nof the blood will become more acrid and volatile. Hence thofe fevers which arife\nfrom too much exercife or motion, are cured by reft of body and mind, with fuch\naliments and medicines as moiften, dilute, and foften or allay acrimony.\nThe exercife of a foldier in camp, confidered as conducive to health. Dr. Pringle\ndiftinguifbes into three heads > the firft relating to his duty, the fecond to his\nliving;\nA ^\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 169\nliving more commodioufly, and the third to his diverfions. The firft, confifting\nchiefly in the exercife of his arms, will be no lefs the means of preferving health\nthan of making him expert in his duty : and frequent returns of this, early, and\nbefore the fun grows hot, will be made more advantageous than repeating it fel-\ndom, and ftaying out long at a time ; for a camp affording little convenience for\nrefrefhment, all unneceffary fatigue is to be avoided. As to the fecond article,\ncutting boughs for {hading the tents, making trenches round them for carrying off\nthe water, airing the ftraw, cleaning their clothes and accoutrements, and affifting\nin the bufinefs of the mefs, ought to be no difagreeable exercife to the men for\nfome part of the day. Laftly, as to diverfions, the men muft be encouraged to\nthem either by the example of their officers, or by fmall premiums to thofe who\n{hall excel in any kind of fports as fhall be judged moft conducive to health : but\nherein great caution is neceffary, not to allow them to fatigue themfelves too much,\nefpecially in hot weather or fickly times ; but above all, that their clothes be kept\ndry, wet clothes being frequent caufes of difeafes and death.\nExercife, above all, is peculiarly neceffary to the philofopher, the ftudent, and\nyoung gentlemen at fchool. How ufeful, how agreeable foever, ftudy may be to\nthe mind, it is very far from being equally falutary to the body. Every one ob-\nferves, that the Creator has formed an intimate connexion between the body and\nthe mind ; a perpetual adtion and re-adtion, by which the body inftantly feels the\ndiforders of the mind, and the mind thofe of the body. The delicate fprings of\nour frail. machines lofe their adlivity and become enervated, and the veffels are\nchoaked by obftrudtions when we totally defift from exercife, and the confequences\nneceffarily affedt the brain : a more ftudious and fedentary life is therefore equally\nprejudicial to the body and the mind. The limbs likevvife become ftiff ; we con-\ntrad!: an aukward conftrained manner ; a certain difguftful air attends all our\nadtions, and we are very near being as difagreeable to ourfelves as to others. An\ninclination to ftudy is highly commendable ; but it ought not, however, to in-\nfpire us with an averfion to fociety. The natural lot of man is to live among his\nfellows : and whatever may be the condition of our birth, or our fituation in life,\nthere are a thoufand occafions where a man muft naturally deftre to render himfelf\nagreeable; to be adtive and adroit ; to dance with a grace ; to command the fiery\nfteed ; to defend himfelf againft a brutal enemy ; to preferve his life by dexterity\n;\nas by leaping, fwimming, &c. Many rational caufes have therefore given rife\nto the pradlice of particular exercifes ; and the moft fagacious and benevolent le-\ngiflators have inftituted, in their academies and univerfities, proper methods of\nenabling youth, who devote themfelves to ftudy, to become expert alfo in laudable\nathletic exercifes.\nNo. ii. X x Whoever\n\fA KEY TO PHYSIC,\nWhoever confiders the ftruCture of the human body will foon be convinced of\nthe neceflity of exercife for the health of children. The body is compofed of an\ninfinite number of veffels, whofe fluids cannot be pufhed on without the aCtion\nand prefllire of the mufcles. But, if the fluids remain ina&ive, obstructions muft\nhappen, and the humours will of courfe be vitiated, which cannot fail to occaficn\ndifeafes. Nature has furnifhed both the veffels which carry rhe blood and lymph\nwith numerous valves, in order that the aCtion of every mufcie might pufh for-\nward their contents ; but without aCtion, this admirable contrivance can have no\neffeCt. This part of the animal ceconomy proves to a demonftration the neceflity\nof exercife for the prefervation of health. Without exercife, the circulation of the\nblood cannot be properly carried on, nor the different fecretions duly performed ;\nwithout exercife, the humours cannot be properly prepared, nor the folids rendered\nftrong or firm. The aCtion of the heart, the motion of the lungs, and all the\nvital functions, are greatly aflifted by exercife. But to point out the manner in\nwhich thefe effcdls are produced, would lead us farther into the oeconomy of the\nhuman body, than molt of thofe for whom this treatife is intended would be able\nto follow. We fnall therefore only add, that, where exercife is negleCted, none\nof the animal fundtions can be duly performed j and when that is the cafe, the\nwhole conflitution muff go to wreck.\nThe love of adlivity fhews itfelf very early in man. So ftrong is this principle,,\nthat a healthy youth cannot be reftrained from exercife, even by the fear of punifh-\nment. Our love of motion is finely a ftrong proof of its utility. Nature implants\nno difpofition in vain. It feems to be a catholic law throughout the whole ani-\nmal creation, that no creature, without exercife, fhould enjoy health, or be able\nto find fubfiftence. Every creature, except man, takes as much of it as is necef-\nfary. He alone, and fueh animals as are under his diredtion, deviate from this\noriginal law, and they fuflfer accordingly. Inactivity never fails to induce an uni-\nverbal relaxation of the folids, which difpofes the body to innumerable difeafes.\nWhen the folids are relaxed, neither the digeftion, nor any of the fecretions, can\nbe duly performed. In this cafe, the worft confequences muft enfue. How can\nperfons who loll all day in eafy chairs, and deep all night on beds of down,, fail\nto be relaxed ? Nor do fuch greatly mend the matter, who never ftir abroad but\nin a coach, fedan, or fuch like. Thefe elegant pieces of luxury are become fo\ncommon, that the inhabitants of great towns feem to be in fame danger of lofing\nthe ufe of their limbs altogether. It is now below any one to walk, who can afford\nto be carried. How ridiculous would it feem, to a perfon unacquainted with mo-\ndern luxury, to behold the young and healthy Twinging along on the fhoulders of\ntheir fellow creatures ! or to fee a fat carcafe, over-run with difeafes occafioned by\nInactivity, dragged through the ftreets by half a dozen horfes\n!\nGlandular\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. i yi\nGlandular obftrubtions, now fo common, generally proceed from inactivity.\nThefe are the moftobftinate of maladies. So long as the liver, kidneys, and other\nglands, duly perform their functions, health is feldom impaired ; but, when they\nfail, nothing can reftore it. Exercife is almoft the only cure we know for glan-\ndular obftruCtions ;\nindeed, it does not always fucceed as a remedy; but there is\nreafon to believe that it would feldom fail to prevent thefe complaints, were it\nufed in due time. One thing is certain, that, amongff thofe who take fufficient\nexercife, glandular difeafes are very little known ; whereas the indolent and\ninactive are feldom free from them. Weak nerves are the conftant companions of\ninactivity. Nothing but exercife and open air can brace and ftrengthen the nerves,\nor prevent the endlefs train of difeafes which proceed from a relaxed ftate of thefe\norgans. We feldom hear the aCtive or laborious complain of nervous dileafes ;\nthefe are referved for the fons of eafe and affluence. Many have been completely\ncured of thefe diforders by being reduced from a ftate of opulence to labour for\ntheir daily bread. This plainly points out the fources from whence nervous dif-\neafes flow, and the means by which they may be prevented. It is abfolutely im-\npoffible to enjoy health, where the perfpiration is not duly carried on ; but that\ncan never be the cafe where exercife is neglected. When the matter which ought\nto be thrown off by perfpiration is retained in the body, it vitiates the humours,\nand occafions the gout, fevers, rheumatifm, &c. Exercife alone would prevent\nmany of thofe difeafes which cannot be cured, and would remove others where\nmedicine proves ineffectual.\nNo piece of indolence hurts the health more than the modern cuftom of lying\na-bed too long in a morning. This is the general practice in great towns. The\ninhabitants of cities feldom rife before nine or ten o\u2019clock ; but the morning is\nundoubtedly the belt time for exercife, while the ftomach is empty, and the body\nrefrefbed with fleep. Befides, the morning air braces and ftrengthens the nerves,\nand, in fome meafure, anfwers the purpofe of a cold bath. Let any one who has\nbeen accuftomed to lie a-bed late, rife by fix or feven, fpend a couple of hours in\nwalking, riding, or any aCtive diverfion without doors, and he will find his fpirits\ncheerful and ferene through the day, his appetite keen, and his body braced and\nftrengthened. Cuftom foon renders early rifing agreeable, and nothing contributes\nmore to the prefervation of health. The inactive are continually complaining of\npains of the ftomach, flatulencies, indigeftions, &c. Thefe complaints, which\npave the way to many others, are not to be removed by medicines. They can\nonly be cured by a vigorous courfe of exercife, to which they feldom fail to yield.\nExercife, if poffible, ought always to be taken in the open air. When that\ncannot be done, various methods may be contrived for exercifing the body within\ndoors,,\n\f172 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ndoors, It is not necefiary to adhere driCtly to any particular kind of exercife. The\nbelt way is to take them by turns, and to ufe that longed: which is mofl fuitable\nto the ftrength and conditution. Thofe kinds of exercife which give aftion to\nmod: of the bodily organs, are always to be preferred, as walking, running, riding,\ndigging, fwi mming, and fuch like. It is much to be regretted, that active and\nmanly diverfions are now fo little praftifed. Diverfions make people take more\nexercife than they otherwife would do, and are of the greateft fervice to fuch as\nare not under the neceflity of labouring for their bread. As a&ive diverfions lofe\nground, thofe of a fedentary kind feem to prevail. Sedentary diverfions are of no\nother ufe but to confume time. Indead of relieving the mind, they often require\nmore thought than either ftudy or bufinefs. Every thing that induces people to\nfit dull, unlefs it be fome necefiary employment, ought to be avoided.\nThe diverfions which afford the bed exercife are, hunting, fhooting, playing at\ncricket, bowls, &c. Thefe exercife the limbs, promote perfpiration, and the\nother fecretions. They likewife drengthen the lungs, and give firmnefs and aeility\nto the whole body. Such as can, ought to fpend two or three hours a-day on\nhorfeback ; thofe who cannot ride, fhould employ the fame time in walking.\nExercife fhould never be continued too long. Over-fatigue prevents the benefit\nof exercife, and indead of drengthening the body tends to weaken it. Every man\nfliould lay himfelf under fome fort of neceffity to take exercife. Indolence, like\nother vices when indulged, gains ground, and at length becomes agreeable.\nHence many who were fond of exercife in the early part of life, become quite\naverfe from it afterwards. This is the cafe of mod hypochondriac and gouty\npeople, which renders their difeafes in a great meafure incurable. Indolence not\nonly occadons difeafes, and renders men ufelefs to fociety, but promotes all man-\nner of vice. To fay a man is lazy, is little better than calling him vicious. The\nmind, if not engaged in fome ufeful purfuit, is condantly in qued of ideal plealures,\nor impreded with the apprehenfion of fome imaginary evil. From thefe fources\nproceed mod of the miferies of mankind. Certainly man was never intended to be\nidle. Inactivity frudrates the very defign of his creation ; whereas an aCtive life\nis the bed guardian of virtue, and the greated prefervative of health.\nOf SLEEP.\nSLEEP, as well as food, ought to be duly regulated. Too little deep weakens\nthe nerves, exhauds the fpirits, and occadons difeafes \u2022, and too much renders the\nmind dull, the body grofs, and difpofes to apoplexies, lethargies, and other com-\nplaints of a dmilar nature. A medium ought therefore to be obferved; but this\nis not eafy to dx. Children require more deep than grown perfons, the laborious\ni than\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 173\nv\nthan the idle, and fuch as eat and drink freely, than thofe who live abftemiouily.\nBefides, the real quantity of fleep cannot be meafured by time; as one perfon will\nbe more refrefhed by five or fix hours fleep, than another by eight or ten. Chil-\ndren may always be allowed to take as much fleep as they pleafe ; but, for adults,\nfix or feven hours is certainly fufficient, and no one ought to exceed eight. Thofe\nwho lie a-bed more than eight hours may dumber, but they can be hardly faid to\nfleep; fuch generally tofs and dream away the forepart of the night, fink to reft\ntowards morning, and dofe till noon. The beft way to make fleep found and re-\nfrefhing is to rife betimes. The cuftorn of lying a-bed for nine or ten hours, not\nonly makes the fleep lefs refrefhing, but weakens the conftitution. Nature points\nout night as the proper feafon for fleep. Nothing more certainly deftroys the con-\nftitution than night-watching. It is great pity that a praftice fo deftru&ive to\nhealth fhould be fo much in falhion. How quickly the want of reft in due feafon\nwill blaft the mod blooming complexion, or ruin the beft conftitution, is evident\nfrom the ghaftly countenances of thofe who, as the phrafe is, turn day into night,\nand night into day. To make fleep refrefhing, the following things are requifite :\nfirft, to take fufficient exercife in the open air ; to avoid ftrong tea or coffee ; next,\nto eat a light fupper ; and laftly, to lie down with a mind as cheerful and ferene\nas poffible.\nIt is certain that too much exercife will prevent fleep as well as too little. We\nfeldom however hear the active and laborious complain of reftlefs nights. It is\nthe indolent and flothful who generally have thefe complaints. Is it any wonder\nthat a bed of down fhould not be refrefhing to a perfon who fits all day in an eafy\nchair ? A great part of the pleafure of life confifts in alternate reft and motion;\nbut they who negledt the latter can never reliffi the former. The labourer enjoys\nmore true luxury in plain food and found fleep, than is to be found in fumptuous\ntables and downy pillows, where exercife is wanting. That light fuppers caufe\nfound fleep, is true even to a proverb. Many perfons, if they exceed the leaft at\nthat meal, are fure to have uneafy nights ; and, if they fall afleep, the load and\noppreffion on their ftomach and fpirits occafion frightful dreams, broken and\ndifturbed repofe, the night-mare, &c. Were the fame perfons to go to bed with\na light fupper, or fit up till that meal was pretty well digefted, they would enjoy\nfound fleep, and rife refrefhed and cheerful. There are indeed fome people who\ncannot fleep unlefs they have eat fome folid food at night, but this does not imply\nthe neceffity of a heavy fupper.\nNothing more certainly difturbs our repofe than anxiety. When the mind is\nnot ateafe, one feldom enjoys found fleep. That greateft of human bleffings flies\nthe wretched, and vifits the happy, the cheerful, and the gay. This is a fufficient\nNo. 12. Y y reafon\n\f*74 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nreafon why every man fhould endeavour to be as eafy in his mind as poffible when\nhe goes to reft. Many, by indulging grief and anxious thought, have banifhed\nfound deep fo long, that they could never afterwards enjoy it. Sleep, wnen taken\nin the forepart of the night, is generally reckoned mod rcfrefhing. Whether this\nbe the effeft of habit or not, is hard to fay but as mod people are accuftomed to\ngo early to bed when }oung, it may be prefumed that deep, at this leafon, will\nprove mod refrefning to them ever after. Whether the forepart of the night be\nbed for deep or not, furely the forepart of the day is fitted both for bufinefs and\namufement ; and we hardly ever find an early rifer who does not enjoy a good date\nof health.\nExperience proves that, the more a perfon deeps, the more is he inclined to deep ;\nif in the morning we deep an hour beyond our cudom, the confeq ence is, that\nvve dull be dull and heavy all the day \u2022, and, as to thefe fadts, there are f me very-\nremarkable. A youth in Germany, of immenfe wealth, was fummoned by hi&\nprince to take up a title of nobility, on which occafion, he drank to fuch an excefs,\nthat the prince, in order to cure him of fuch a fcandalous vice, had him carried\ninto a dark and remote place, where he dept three days and three nights; for\nwhenever he awoke, believing it to be the middle of the night, he betook himfelf\nto deep again. \u2014The memoirs of the academy of fciences at Paris mention a deep\nof two months, caufed by a catalepfy, a difeafe by which the patient is inftantly\nrendered as immoveable as a ftatue.\u2014 Samuel Chilton, a labourer, in Somerfc fhi e,\nfell, and without any vidble caufe, into a profound deep, out of which no means\ncould recover him, till, after a month\u2019s time, he arofe of himfelf. H s mo;her,\nfearing he fhould be flarved in that lullen humour, as die called it, put bread and\ncheefe and fmall beer by him, and\u2019it was daily fpent. On the ninth of April,\n1696, he was feized with a like deepy fit, which laded till the feventh of Auguft,\nwhen he awaked, without knowing he had dept above a n :\nght. He occadonally\nufed the food fet by him, and had evacuations, till, about the tenth week, his\njaws feemed to be fet, and his teeth clinched fo clofe, that his mouth could not be\nopened f and all the nourifhment he received, during thefe feven weeks, was about\nthree pints of tent infinuated through a cavity in one of his teeth. He had made\nwater but once, and never had a ftool all the time. On the 17th of Augud, 1697,\nhis fit returned, and Dr. Oliver, the author of the memoir, in order to try whe-\nther there might not be fome impodure in this extraordinary phenomenon, went\nto the houfe ; he put hns mouth to his ear, and called him feveral times, by his\nname, as loud as he could ; pulled him by the fhoulders, pinched his nofe, flop-\nped his mouth and nofe at the fame time-, lifted up his eye-lids, when he found\nthe balls drawn up under the brows ; he farther, held a phial of fpirit of fal ammo-\nniac\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. r\/5\nmac under one noftril -,\nthat producing no effed, he poured up his nofe near a\nhalf ounce bottle, and the fpirit, he fays, being drawn from quick lime, was\nalmoft as hot as fire itfelf. Not fatisfied with this, he crammed the fame nodril\nwith powder of white hellebore : all thefe experiments producing no other effed,\nthan to make his eyes fhiver a little. Dr. Oliver left him, convinced that he was\nreally afleep. A few days after, an apothecary drew fome ounces of blood from\nhis arm, and bound up the orifice, without his making the lead motion : like-\nwife, a gentleman, though fomewhat indifcreetly, ran a pin into his arm, up to\nthe very bone-, and in this date of infenfible fleep he continued till the nineteenth\nof November -, during all this time, he eat and evacuated, but never fouled his\nbed. The above indance of deep is to be feen at large in Jones\u2019s abridgement of\nthe Philofophical Tranfadions, vol. v.\nOf DREAMS.\nSCARCE any part of nature is lefs open to our obfervation than the human\nmind in this date. The dreamer himfelf cannot well obferve the manner in which\ndreams arife or difappear to him. When he awakes, he cannot recoiled the cir-\ncumdances of his dreams with fufficient accuracy. Were we to watch over him\nwith the mod vigilant attention, we could not perceive with certainty what emotions\nare excited in his mind, or what thoughts pafs through ir, during his deep. But\nthough we could afeertain thefe phenomena, many other difficulties would dill re-\nmain. What parts of a human being are adive, what dormant, when he dreams ?\nWhy does not he always dream while afleep ? Or why dreams he at all ? Do any\ncircumdances in our conditution, fituation, and peculiar charader, determine the\nnature of our dreams ? We may lay before the reader fuch fads as have been\nafeertained concerning dreaming, and the mod plaufible conjedures that have been\noffered to explain thole particulars, about which we caii only conjecture, or have\nat lead hitherto obtained nothing more certain than conjedure.\nIn dreaming, we are not confcicus of being afleep. This is well known from a\nthoufand circumdances. When awake, we often recoiled our dreams-, and we\nremember on fuch occafions, that while thofe dreams were palling through our\nminds, it never occurred to us that we were feparated by fleep from the adive\nworld. We are often obferved to ad and talk in dreaming as if we were bufily\nengaged in the intercourfe of focial life. In dreaming, we do not confider ourfclves\nas witneffing or bearing a part in a fiditious feene : we ieem not to be in a fimilar\nfituation with the adors in a dramatic performance, or thefpedators before whom\nthey exhibit, but engaged in the bufinefs of real life. All the varieties of thought\nthat pafs through our minds wnen awake may alfo occur in dreams all the images\nwhich\n\fij6 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nwhich imagination prefents in the former ftate, {he is alfo able to call up in the lat-\nter ; all the fame emotions may be excited, and we are often actuated by equal\nviolence of paftion none of the tranfactions in which we are capable of engaging\nwhile awake is impoffible in dreams : in fhort, our range of action and obfervation\nis equally wide in one ftate as in the other and while dreaming, we are not fen-\nfible of any diftindtion between our dreams and the events and tranfactions in which\nwe are actually concerned in our intercourfe with the world.\nThough in dreams imagination appears to be free from all reftraint, and indulges\nin the moft wanton freaks, yet it is generally agreed, that the imaginary tranfactions\nof the dreamer bear always fome relation to his particular character in the world,\nhis habits of action, and the circumftances of his life. The lover, we are told,\ndreams of his miftrefs \u2022, the mifer of his money-, the philofopher renews his re-\nfearcbes in deep often with the fame pain and fatigue as when awake ; and ever\nthe merchant, at times, returns to balance his books, and compute the profits of\nan adventure, when numbering on his pillow. And not only do the more general\ncircumftances of a perfon\u2019s life influence his dreams ; his paflions and habits are\nnearly the fame when afleep as when awake. A perfon whofe habits of life are vir-\ntuous, does not in his dreams plunge into a feries of crimes ; nor are the vicious\nreformed when they pafs into this imaginary world. The choleric man finds him-\nfelf offended by flight provocations as well in h*is dreams as in his ordinary inter-\ncourfe with the world, and a mild temper continues pacific in deep. The charac-\nter of a perfon\u2019s dreams is influenced by his circumftances when awake in a (till\nmore unaccountable manner. Certain dreams ulually arile in the mind after a per-\nfon has been in certain fituations. Dr. Beattie relates, that he once, after riding\nthirty miles in a high wind, paffed a part of the fucceeding night in dreams beyond\ndefcription terrible. The ftate of a perfon\u2019s health, and the manner in which the\nvital functions are carried on, have a confiderable influence in determining the cha-\nracter of dreams. After too full a meal, or after eating of an unufual fort of food,\na perfon has always dreams of a certain nature. In dreaming, the mind for the moft\npart carries on no intercourfe through the fenfes with furrounding objects. Touch\na perfon gently who is afleep, he feels not the impreflion. You may awake him\nby a fmart blow but when the ftroke is not fufficiently violent to awake him, he\nremains infen Able of if. We fpeak foftly befide a perfon afleep without fearing\nthat he overhear us. His eye-lids are {hut; and even though light fhould fall\nupon the eye-ball, yet ftill his powers of vifion are not awakened to active exertion,\nunlefs the light be fo ftrong as to roufe him from fleep. He is infenfible both to\nfweet and difagreeable fmells. It is not eafy to try whether his organs of tafte retain\ntheir activity, without awakening him yet from analogy it may be prefumed\ni that\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 177\nthat thefe too are inadtive. With refpedt to the circumftances here enumerated, it\nis indifferent whether a perfon be dreaming or buried in fleep.\nYet there is one remarkable fad: concerning dreaming which may feem to contra-\ndid what has been here afferted.. In dreams, we are liable not only to fpeak aloud\nin confequence of the fuggeftions of imagination, but even to get up, and walk\nabout and engage in little enterprifes, without awaking. Now, as we are in this\ninftance fo adive, it feems that we cannot be then inlenfible of the prelence of llir-\nrounding objeds. The deep-walker is really fendble in a certain degree of the pre-\nfence of the objeds around him ;\nbut he does not attend to them with all their cir-\ncumftances, nor do they excite in him the fame emotions as if he were awake. He\nfeels no terror on the top of a houfe, or the brink of a precipice; and in confe-\nquence of being free from fear, he is alfo without danger in fuch a fuuation, unlefs\nfuddenly awaked. This is one of the mod: inexplicable phenomena of dreaming.\nThere is alfo another fad not quite confonant with what has been above advanced.\nIt is faid, that in deep a perfon will continue to hear the noile of a catarad in the\nneighbourhood, or regular ftrokes with a hammer, or any fimilar found diffidently\nloud, and continued uninterruptedly from before the time of his falling adeep.\nWe know not whether he awakes on the fudden ceffation of the noife. This fad\nis afferted on diffident evidence ; it is curious. Even when awake, if very deeply\nintent on any piece of ftudy, or clofely occupied in bufinefs, the found of a clock\nftriking in the neighbourhood, or the beating of a drum, will efcape us unnoticed :\nand it is therefore the more furprifing that we fhould thus continue fenfible to\nfounds when adeep. Not only do a perfon\u2019s general charader, habits of life, and\ndate of health, induence his dreams; but thofe concerns in which he has been\nmoftly deeply interefted during the preceding day, and the views which have\narifen moft frequently to his imagination, very often afford the fubjeds of his\ndreams. When I look forward with anxious expectation towards any future event,\n1 am likely to dream either of the difappointment or the gratification of my wiflies,\nHave I been engaged through the day, either in bufinefs or amufements which I\nhave found exceedingly agreeable, or in a way in which I have been extremely un-\nhappy ? either my happinefs or my mifery is likely to be renewed in my dreams.\nThough dreams have been regarded among almoft all nations through the world,\nat lead in fome periods of their hiftory, as prophetic of future events ; yet it does\nnot appear that this popular opinion has been eftablifhed on good grounds. Chrif-\ntianity, indeed, teaches us to believe, that the Supreme Being may, and adually\ndoes, operate on our minds, and induence at times the determinations of our will,\nwithout making 11s fenfible of the reftraint to which we are thus fubjefted. And,\nin the fame manner, no doubt, the fuggeftions which arife to us in dreams may be\nNo. 12. Z z produced.\n\f% *\ni;8 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nproduced. The imaginary tranfa&ions in which we are then engaged, may be\nfuch as are adtually to occupy us in life \u2022, the ftrange and feemingly incoherent ap-\npearances which are then prefented to the mind\u2019s eye, may allude to fome events\nwhich are to befall ourfelves or others. It is, therefore, by no means impofiible,\nor inconfiftent with the general analogy of nature, that dreams fhould have a refpedfc\nto futurity. We have no reafon to regard the dreams which are related in the Holy\nScriptures to have been prophetic of future events, as not infpired by heaven, or\nto laugh at the idea of a prophetic dream as abfurd or ridiculous.\nWe know of no other fadls that have been fully afcertained concerning dreaming.\nBut we are by no means fufficiently acquainted with this important phenomenon in\nthe hiftory of the mind. We cannot tell by what laws of our conftitution we are\nthus liable to be fo frequently engaged in imaginary tranfa&ions, nor what are the\nparticular means by which the delufion is accomplifhtd. The deluiion is indeed\nremarkably ftrong. One will fometimes have a book prefented to him in a dream,\nand fancy that he reads, and actually enter into the nature of the compofltion be-\nfore him, and even remember, after he awakes, what he knows, that he only\nfancied himfelf reading. Can this be delufion ? If delufion, how or for what\npurpofes is it produced ? The mind, it would appear, does not, in deep, be-\ncome inactive like the body ; or at leaft is not always inadive while we are afleep.\nWhen we do not dream, the mind muft either be inactive, or the connexion be-\ntween the mind and the body muft be conftdered as in fome manner fufpended\n:\nand when we dream, the mind, though it probably a\u00a3ts in concert with the body,\nyet does not a<Tt in the fame manner as when we are awake. It feems to be clouded\nor bewildered, in confequence of being deprived for a time of the fervice of the\nfenfes. Imagination becomes more aftive and more capricious *, and all the other\npowers, efpecially judgment and memory, become difordered and irregular in\ntheir operation.\nVarious theories have been propofed to explain what appears here moft inexpli-\ncable. The ingenious Mr. Baxter, in hisTreatife on the Immateriality of the Hu-\nman Soul, endeavours to prove that dreams are produced by the agency of fome\nfpiritual beings, who either amufe or employ themfelves ferioufly in engaging man-\nkind in allthofe imaginary tranfaftions with which they are employed in dreaming.\nThis theory, however, is far from being plaufible. It leads us entirely beyond\nthe limits of our knowledge. It requires us to believe without evidence. It is\nunfupported by any analogy. It creates difficulties ftill more inexplicable than\nthofe which it has been propofed to remove. Till it appear that our dreams can-\nnot poffibly be produced without the interference of other fpiritual agents, pof-\nfeflmg fuch influence over our minds as to deceive us with fancied joys, and involve\nus\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 179\nus in imaginary affiiftions, we cannot reafonably refer them to fuch'a canfe. Be-\nfides, from the fafts which have been dated as well known concerning dreams, it\nappears that their nature depends both on the date of the human body and on that\nof the mind. But were they owing to the agency of other fpiritual beings, how\ncould they be influenced by the date of the body ? Thofe mud be a curious fet of\nfpiritual beings who depend in fuch a manner on the date of our corporeal frame.\nBetter not to allow them exidence at all, than to place them in fuch a dependance.\nWolfius, and after him M. Formey, have fuppofed, that dreams never arife in\nthe mind, except in confequence of fome of the organs of fenfation having been\nprevioufly excited. Either the ear or the eye, or the organs of touching, tading,\nor fmclling, communicate information, fomehow, in a tacit, fecret, manner ; and\nthus partly roufe its faculties from the lethargy in which they are buried in deep,\nand engage them in a feries of confufed and imperfect exertions. But what paffes\nin dreams is fo very different from all that we do when awake, that it is impoffible\nfor the dreamer himfelf to didinguifh, whether his powers of fenfation perform\nany part on the occaflon. It is not neceffary that imagination be always excited\nby fenfation. Fancy, even when we are awake, often wanders from the prefent\nfcene. Abfence of mind is incident to the dudious ; the poet and the mathema-\ntician many times forget where they are. We cannot difcover from any thing that\na perfon in dreaming difplays to the obfervation of others, that his organs of fen-\nfation take a part in the imaginary tranfadlions in which he is employed. In thofe\nindances, indeed, in which perfons adeep are faid to hear founds $\nthe founds\nwhich they hear are faid alfo to influence, in fome manner, the nature of their\ndreams. But fuch indances are Angular. Since then it appears that the perlon\nwho dreams is himfelf incapable of didinguifhing either during his dreams, or by\nrecolle&ion when awake, whether any new imprefilons are communicated to him\nin that date by his organs of fenfation ; that even by watching over him, and com-\nparing our obiervations of his circumdances and emotions, in his dreams, with\nwhat he recollefts of them after awaking, we cannot, except in one or two Angu-\nlar indances, afcertain this farft i and that the mind is not incapable of adling while\nthe organs of fenfation are at red, and on many occafions refufts to Aden to the\ninformation which they convey ; we may, without hefitation, conclude, that the\ntheory of Wolfius and Formey has been too hadily and incautioufly advanced.\nOther phyfiologids tell us, that the mind, when we dream, is in a date of\ndelirium. Sleep, they fay, is attended with what is called a collapfe of the brain ;\nduring which either the whole or a part of the nerves of which it confids, are in a\ndate in which they cannot carry on the ufual intercourfe between the mind and the\norgans of fenfation. When the whole of the brain is in this date, we become en-\ntirely\n\f1*0 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ntirely unconfcious of exiftence, and the mind finks into adlivity : when only a part\nof the brain iscoliapfed, as they term it, we are then neither afleep nor awake, blit\nin a fort of delirium between the two. This theory, like the laft mentioned, fup-\npofes the mind incapable of adting without the help of fenfation : it fuppoles that\nwe know the nature of a (fate of which we cannot afcertain the phenomena ; it alfo\ncontradicts a known fad, in reprefenting dreams as confufed images of things\naround us, not fanciful combinations of things not exifting together in nature or in\nhuman life. We muft treat it likewife, therefore, as a bafelefs fabric.\nInftead of the attendant fpirits watching over our bodies, and inciting us to\ngood or evil in our dreams, may we not more rationally fuppoie, that thefe\nincitements, or rather exertions towards real and ienfible adionf, are produced\nby the foul or fpirit within us, which being mortal, never fleeps ; but which\nrather, during that paffive ftate of the body, aflumes an endeavour to ad\nwithout it, or to efcape from it, as from a prifon, wherein it is reftrained to\ncertain limits, and obliged to ad under the will of its keeper. This furely\nwili belt explain the fads attending fleep-walkers, who, in the darkeft nights\nvifit different apartments, walk up and down flairs, lock and unlock doors,\nopen windows, and crawl over the roofs of houfes, with the utmoft eafe and\ncelerity ;\nwhich, if the body were awake, would be impofiible. May we not\nlikewife attribute to the fame fourcc, thole elevated ideas, and fublime com-\npofitions, which Milton, and other celebrated authors have confeffed, were\ncommunicated rightly in their dreams ? It lately happened, that a young gen-\ntleman, about fifteen years of age, from one of the public fchools, flept in\nthe fame room with me. He chofe to go to bed early ; and when I came into\nthe fame apartment, about two hours after, he appeared remarkably intent\nupon his ftud\n:\nes, though faft locked in the arms of fleep. I flood fome time\nat his bed- fide, and heard him repeat feveral lines from Homer and Virgil.\nAfter this he repeated, with a bold and nervous accent, the whole of the He-\nbrew alphabet \u2022, then turning, feemed to fall into a more compofed fleep.\nThe next morning at breakfaft, I related this circumftance to the company,\nin the prefence of the young gentleman, and all were inflantly commending the\ngreat progrefs he muft have made in his ftudies. The young man inflantly\ndeclared, that however converfant he might be with Virgil and Homer, he\nhad never heard the Hebrew alphabet repeated, nor did he ever know the\nname of any one of its chara&ers.\u2014The nature of the connexion by which the\nfoul and body are united, feems to be almoft beyond our comprehenfion. And\ntill we can apply experiment and obfervation in a better manner to this branch of\nphyfiology.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 181\nphyfiology, it muft undoubtedly remain unknown. To fo.nething myfterious in\nthe nature of that connexion, the delufion produced in dreams is in all pro-\nbability owing.\nAmid this uncertainty with refpedt to the manner in which our powers of mind\nand body perform their functions in dreaming, it is pleafing to find that we can,\nhowever, apply to ufeful purpoles the imperfeCl knowledge which we have been\nable to acquire concerning this feries of phenomena. Our dreams are affeCted by\nthe ftate of our health, by the manner in which we have palled the preceding day,\nby our general habits of life, by the hopes which we moft fondly indulge, and the\nfears which prevail moft over our fortitude when we are awake. From recollecting\nour dreams, therefore, we may learn to correct many improprieties in our conduct ;\nto refrain from bodily exerciles, or from meats and drinks, that have unfavour-\nable effeCts on our .confutation.; to refill in due time evil habits that are Healing\nupon us ; and to guard againft hopes and fears which detach us from our proper\nconcerns, and unfit us for the duties of life. Inftead of thinking what our dreams\nmay forebode, we may with much better reafon r.efleCt by what they have been\noccafioned, and look back to thofe circumflances incur ,paft life to which they are\ntawing. The fleep of innocence and health is found and refrelhing \u2022, their dreams\ndelightful and pleafing. A diiiempered body, and a polluted or perturbed mind,\nare haunted in fleep with frightful, impure, and unpleafing, dreams.\nOf INTEMPERANCE.\nIT is unlverfally agreed, that temperance and exercife are the two belt phy\u00a3U\ncians in the world, and that if thefe-were duly regarded, there would be little oc-\ncafian for any other. Temperance may juftly be called the parent of health ; yet\nnumbers ot mankind aCt as if they thought difeafes and death too flow in their pro-\ngress, and by intemperance and debauch, feem, as it were, to folicit their approach.\nThe danger ofintemperance appears from the very conftruClion of the human body.\nHealth depends on that ftate of the folids and fluds which fits them for the due\nperformance of the vital funClions ; and, while thefe go regularly on, v\/e are\nfound and well.; but whatever difturhs them neceffarily impairs health. Intem-\nperance never fails to diforder the whole an mal ceconomy ; it hurts the digeftion,\nrelaxes the nerves, renders the different fecretions irregular, vitiates the humours,\n: and occafions numberlefs difeales.\nThe analogy between the nourifbment of plants and animals affords a fluking\nproof ot ttie da.r\nger of intemperance. Moifture and manure greatly promote ve-\ngetation ; vet an over quantity of either will entirely deftroy it, The beft things\n(become hurtful, nay deftruClive, when carried to excefs. Hence we learn, that\nNo. 12. 3 A fhe\n\fA KEY TO P H Y 5 I C,\nthe higher degree of human wifdom confifts in regulating our appetites and paf-\nfions to at to avoid all extremes.

The Have of appetite will ever be the difgrace of human\nnature. \u2014The Supreme Being hath endued us with various paffions, for the pro-\npagation of the fpecies, the prefervation of the individual, &c. Intemperance is\nthe abufe of thefe paffions; and moderation confifts in the proper regulation of\nthem. Men, not contented with fatisfying the Ample calls of Nature, create ar-\ntificial wants, and are perpetually in fearch of fomething that may gratify them ;\nbut imaginary wants can never be gratified. Nature is content with little: but\nluxury knows no bounds. Hence the epicure, the drunkard, and the debauchee,\nfeldom ftop their career, tiil their money, or their conftitution, fails : then indeed\nthey generally fee their error when too late.\nIt is impoffible to lay down fixed rules with regard to diet, on account of the\ndifferent conftitutions of mankind. The moft ignorant perfon, however, certainly\nknows what is meant by excefs ; and it is in the power of every man, if he choofes,\nto avoid it. The great rule of diet is to ftudy fimplieity. Nature delights in the\nmoft plain and fimple food ; and every animal, except man, follows her dictates,\nMan alone riots at large, and ranfacks the whole creation in queft of luxuries, to\nhis own deftrudtion. An eleganc writer of the laft age fpeaks thus of intemperance\nin diet :\n\u201c For my part, when I behold a fafhionable table fet out in all its mag-\nnificence, I fancy that I fee gouts and dropftes, fevers and lethargies, with other\ninnumerable diftempers, lying in ambufcade among the difbes.\u201d Nor is intem-\nperance in other things lefs deftru&ive than in diet. How quickly does the im-\nmoderate purfuit of carnal pleafures, or the abule of intoxicating liquors, ruin the\nbelt conftitution ! Indeed thefe vices generally go hand in hand. Hence it is that\nwe fo often behold the votaries of Bacchus and Venus, even before they have ar-\nrived at the prime of life, worn out with difeafe, and halting with fwift pace to an\nuntimely grave. Did men reflect on the painful difeafes, and premature deaths,\nwhich are daily occafioned by intemperance, it would be fufficient to make them\nfbrink back with horror from the indulgence even of their darling pleafures.\nIntemperance does not hurt its votaries alone \u2022, the innocent too often feel the\ndireful effedts of it. Flow often do we behold the miferable mother, with her\nhelplefs infants, pining in want, while the cruel father is indulging his infatiate\nappetites? Families are not only reduced to mifery, but even extirpated, by in-\ntemperance. Nothing tends fo much to prevent propagation, and to Ihorten the\nlives of children, as the intemperance of parents. The poor man who labours all\nday, and at night lies down contented with his humble fare, can boaft a numerous\noffspring, while his pampered lord, funk in eafe and luxury, often languilhes\n2 without\n\fand OCCULT SCIENCE. 183\nwithout an heir to his ample fortunes. Even ftates and empires feel the influence\nof intemperance, and rife or fall as it prevails. Inftead of mentioning the different\nkinds of intemperance, and pointing out their influence upon health, we fhall only,\nby way of example, make a few obfervations on one particular fpecies of that\nVice, viz. the abufe of intoxicating liquors.\nEvery aft of intoxication puts Nature to the expence of a fever, in order to dis-\ncharge the poifonous draught. When this is repeated almofc every day, it is eafy\nto forefee the confequences. That conflitution muft be ftrong indeed, which is\nable long to hold out under a daily fever ! But fevers occafioned by drinking do\nnot always go off in a day*, they frequently end in an inflammation of the bread,\nliver, or brain, and produce fatal effects. Though the drunkard fhould not fall\nby an acute difeafe, he feldom efcapes thofe of a chronic kind. Intoxicating\nliquors, when ufed to excefs, weaken the bowels and fpoil the digeftion *, they\ndeftrov the power of the nerves, and occafion paralytic and convulfive diforders *,\nthey likewife heat and inflame the blood, deftroy its balfamic quality, render it\nunfit for circulation, and the nourifbment of the body. Hence obftrudtions, atro-\nphies, dropfles, and confumptions of the lungs. Thefe are the common ways in\nwhich drunkards make their exit. Difeafes of this kind, when brought on by\nhard drinking, feldom admit of a cure. Many people injure their health by drink-\ning, who feldom get drunk. The continual habit of foaking, as it is called,\nthough its effedls be not fo violent, is not lefs pernicious. When the veffels are\nkept conflantly full and upon the flretch, th? different digeftions can neither be\nduly performed, nor the humours properly prepared. Hence mod people of this\ncharacter are affiidted with the gout, the gravel, ulcerous fores in the legs, &c.\nIf thefe diforders do not appear, they are feized with low fpirits, hypochondriacal\naffe&ions, and other fymproms of indigeftion.\nConfumptions are now fo common, that it is thought one-tenth of the inhabitants\nof great towns die of that difeafe. Hard drinking is no doubt one of the caufes to\nwhich we muft impute the increafe of confumptions. The great quantities of vifeid\nmalt-liquor drunk by the common people of England cannot fail to render the\nblood fizy and unfit for circulation; from whence proceed obftrudions, and in-\nflammations of the lungs. T here are few great ale-drinkers who are not phthiftcal\n:\nnor is that to be wondered at, confidering the glutinous and almoft indigeltibl'e\nnature of ftrong ale. Tho!e who drink ardent fpirits or ftrong wines run Itill\ngreater hazird *, ihefe liquors heac and inflame the blood, and tear the tender\nveflels of the lungs in pieces *, yet fo great is the coniumption of them in this coun-\ntry, that one would almoft be induced to think the inhabitants lived upon them.\nThe habit of drinking proceeds frequently from misfortunes in life. The mifera-\nble\n\f3*4 A KEY'TO PHYSIC,\nble fly to it for relief. It affords them indeed a temporary eafe. But, alas! this\nfolace is fhort-lived; and when it is over, the fpirits (ink as much below their\ntifual tone as they had before been raifed above it. Hence a repetition of the dofe\nbecomes neceflfary, and every frefh dofe makes way for another, till the unhappy\nwretch becomes a Have to the bottle, and at length falls a facrifice to what at firfr\nperhaps was taken only as a medicine. No man is fo dejefted as the drunkard when\nhis debaych is gone off. Hence it is, that thofe who have the greateft flow of\nfpirits while the glafs circulates freely, are of all others the mod melancholy when\nfober, and often put an end to their own miferable exiftence in a fit of ipleen or\nill humour.\nDrunkennefs not only proves deftruftive to health, but likewife to the faculties\nof the mind. It is ftrange that creatures who value chemfelves on account of a\nfuperior degree of reafon to that of brutes fhould take pleafure in finking fo far\nbelow them. Were fuch as voluntarily deprive themfelves of the ufe of reafon\nto continue ever after in that condition, it would feem but a juft punifhment.\nThough this be not the confequence of one aft of intoxication, ic feldom fails to\nfocceed a courfe of it. By a habit of drinking, the greateft genius is often reduced\nto a mere idiot. Intoxication is peculiarly hurtful to young perfons. It heats\ntheir blood, impairs their ftrength, and obftrufts their growth ; befides, the fre\u00ab\nquent ufe of ftrong liquors in the early part of life deftroys any benefit that might\narife from them afterwards. Thofe who make a praftice of drinking generous\nliquors when young, cannot expeft to reap any benefit from them as a cordial in\nthe decline of life. Drunkennefs is not only in itfelf a moil abominable vice, but\nis an inducement to many others. There is hardly any crime fo horrid that the\ndrunkard will not perpetrate for the love of liquor. We have known mothers fell\ntheir children\u2019s clothes, the food that they fhould liave eaten, and afterwards even\nthe infants themfelves, in order to purchafe t{ie accurfed draught.\nIt is amazing that our improvements in arts, learning, and politenefs, have not\nput the barbarous cuftom of drinking to excefs out of fafhion. It is indeed lefs\ncommon in South Britain than it was formerly : but it ftill prevails very much in\nthe North, where this relic of barbarity is miftaken for hospitality- There no man\nis fuppofed to entertain his guefts well, who does not make them drunk. Forcing\npeople to drink, is certainly the greateft piece of rudenefs that any man can be\nguilty of. Manlinefs, complaifance, or mere good-nature, may inducea man to\ntake his glafs, if urged to it, at a time when he might as well take poifon. The\ncuftom of drinking to excefs has long been out of fafhion in France; and, as it\nbegins to lofe ground among the politer part of the Englifh, we hope it will foon\nbe banifhed from every part of the kingdom.\nOf\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 185\nOf the PASSIONS.\nTHE paffions have great influence both in the caufe and cure of difeafes. How\nthe mind affe&s the body, will, in all probability, ever remain a fecret. It is\nfufficienc for us to know, that there is eftablifhed a reciprocal influence betwixt\nthe mental and corporeal parts, and that whatever injures the one, diforders the\nother.\nOf Anger.\u2014The paffion of anger ruffles the mind, diflorts the countenance,\nhurries on the circulation of the blood, and diforders the whole vital and animal\nfunctions. It often occafions fevers, and other acute difeafes, and fometimes even\nfudden death. This paffion is peculiarly hurtful to the delicate, and thofe of weak\nnerves. I have known fuch perfons frequently iofe their lives by a violent fit of\nanger, and would advil'e them to guard againft the excefs of this paffion with the\nutmolt care. It is not indeed always in our power to prevent being angry, but\nwe may furely avoid harbouring refentment in our breaft. Refentment preys upon\nthe mind, and occafions the moft obftinate chronical diforders, which gradually\nwafte the conftitution. Nothing fhews true greatnefs of mind more than to forgive\ninjuries : it promotes the peace of fociety, and greatly conduces to our own eafe,\nhealth, and felicity. Such as value health fliould avoid violent gufts of anger, as\nthey would the moft deadly poifon. Neither ought they to indulge refentment,\nbut to endeavour at all times to keep their minds calm and ferene. Nothing tends\nfo much to the health of the body as a conftant tranquillity of mind. Add to this,\nthe indecency of extravagant anger j how it renders us, whilft it lafts, the fcorn\nand fport of all about us, of which it leaves us, when it ceafes, fenfible and afham-\ned \u2022, the inconveniences and irretrievable mifcondudt into which our irrafcibility\nhas fometimes betrayed us ;\nthe friendfflips it has loft us *, the diftreffes and em-\nbarraffinents in which we have been involved by it, and the fore repentance which\non one account or other it always cofts us.\nPhyficians and naturalifts afford inftances of very extraordinary effects of this\npaffion. Borrichius cured a woman of an inveterate tertian ague, which had baffled\nthe art of phyfic, by putting the patient in a furious fit of anger. Valeriola made\nufe of the fame means, with the like fuccefs, in a quartan ague. The fame paffion\nhas been equally falutary to paralytic, gouty, and even dumb, perfons ; to which\nlaft it has fometimes given the ufe of fpeech. Etmuller gives divers inftances of\nvery fingular cures wrought by anger ; among others, he mentions a perfon laid\nup in the g< ut, who, being provoked by his phyfician, flew upon him, and was\ncured. It is true, the remedy is fomewhat dangerous in the application, when a\npatient does not know how to ufe it with moderation. We meet with feveral in-\nNo. 12. 3 B ftances\n\f186 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfiances of princes to whom it has proved mortal*, for example, Valentinian the\nfirft, Wenceflas, Matthius Corvinus king of Hungary, and others. There are\nalfo inftances wherein it has produced the epilepfy, jaundice, and cholera-morbus,\ndiarrhoea, &c. In fa\u00a3t, this paflion is of fuch a nature, that it quickly throws\nthe whole nervous fyftem into preternatural commotions, by a violent ftridlure of\nthe nervous and mufcular parts \u2022, and furprifingly augments not only the fyftole of\nthe heart and of its contiguous vefiftls, but alfo the tone of the fibrous parts in\nthe whole body. It is alfo certain, that this pafiion, by the fpafmodic ftridture it\nproduces in the parts, exerts its power principally on the ftomach and inteftines,\nwhich are highly nervous and membranous parts ; whence the fymptoms are more\ndangerous, in proportion to the greater confcnt of the ftomach and inteftines with\nthe other nervous parts, and almoft with the whole body. The unhappy influence\nof anger likewile, on the biliary and hepatic dufls, is very furprifing \u2022, fince by an\nintenfe conftridlion of thefe, the liver is not only rendered fcirrhous, but ftones alfo\nare often generated in the gall bladder and biliary du<5ts; thefe accidents have\nfcarcely any other origin than an obftru&ion of the free motion and efflux of the\nbile, by means of this violent ftridture. From fuch a ftrifture of thefe dudts like-\nwife proceeds the jaundice, which in procefs of time lays a foundation forcalculous\nconcretions in the gall-bladder. Laftly, by increafing the motion of the fluid, or\nthe fpafms of the fibrous parts, by means of anger, a larger quantity of blood is\npropelled with an impetus to certain parts ; whence it happens that they are too\nmuch diftended, and the orifices of the veins diftributed there opened. It is evi-\ndent from experience, that anger has a great tendency to excite enormous hemor-\nrhages, either from the nofe, the aperture of the pulmonary artery, the veins of\nthe anus \u2022, or in women, from the uterus, efpecialiy in thofe previoufly accuftomed\nand difpofed to fuch evacuations.\nOf FEAR.\u2014The influence of fear, both in occafioning and aggravating difeafes,\nis very great. No man ought to be blamed for a decent concern about life \u2022, but\ntoo great a defire to preferve it, is often the caufe of lofing it. Fear and anxiety,,\nby deprefling the fpirits, not only difpofe us to difeafes, but often render thofe\ndifeafes fatal which an undaunted mind would overcome. Sudden fear has gene-\nrally violent effects. Epileptic fits, and other convulfive dilorders, are often oc-\ncafioned bv it. Hence the danger of that practice, fa common among young\npeople, of frightening one another. Many have loft their lives, and others have\nbeen rendered miferable, by frolics of this kind. It is dangerous to tamper with\nthe human paflions. The mind may eafily be thrown into fuch diforder as never\nagain to a& with regularity.\nBut\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 187\nBut the gradual effects of fear prove moft hurtful. The conftant dread of fome\nfuture evil, by dwelling upon the mind,, often occafions the very evil itfelf.\nHence it comes to pafs, that fo many die of thole very difeafes of wnich they long\nhad a dread, or which had been impreffed on their ninds by lome accident, or\nfoolifh predidtion. This, for example, is often the cafe wirh women in child- bed.\nMany of thofe who die in that fituation are impreffed with the notion of . their death\nalong time before it happens ; and there is rcaion to believe, that this impreffion\nis often the caufe of it. The methods taken to imprefs th. minds of women with\nthe apprehenfions of the great pain and peril of child-birth, are very hurtful.\nFew women die in labour, though many lofe their lives after it ; which may be\nthus accounted for. A woman after delivery, finding herfelf weak and exhaufted,\nimmediately apprehends fhe is in danger ; but this fear feldom fails to obftrudl the\nneceffary evacuations upon which her recovery depends. Thus the lex often fall\na iacnfice to their own imaginations, when there would be no danger, did they\napprehend none. It feldom happens that two or three women, in a great town,\ndie in child-bed, but their death is followed by many others. Every woman of\ntheir acquaintance who is with child, dreads the fame fate, and the dileafe becomes\nepidemical by the mere force of imagination. This fhould induce pregnant\nwomen to defpile fear, and by all means to avoid thofe tattling goffips who are\ncontinually buzzing in their ears the misfortunes of others. Every thing that may\nin the lead alarm a patient, or a child- bed woman, ought with the greatefl care to\nbe guarded againfl.\nIn general, the effects of terror are a contradlion of the fmall veffels and a repul-\nfion of the blood in the large and internal ones \u2022, hence proceed a fupprefBon of\nperfptration, a general oppreflion, trembling, and anguifh of the heart, and lungs,\novercharged with blood. Frights often occafion incurable difeafes, as epilepfy,\nftupor, madnefs, &c. In acute difeafes, they have evidently killed many, by the\nagitation into which they have thrown the fpirits, already too much disordered.\nWe have alfo accounts of perfons abloiutely killed by terrors when in perfect health\nat the time of receiving the lhock from them : people ordered to be executed, buc\nwith private orders tor a reprieve, have expired at the block without a wound.\nOut of many inftances of the fatal effedts of fear recorded in writers, the following\nis feledted as one of the moft fingular. \u201c George Grochantzy, a Polander, who\nhad inlifted as a foldier in the fervice of the king of Pruffra, deferted during the\nlaft war. A fmall party was fent in purfuit of him *, and when he leaft expedted it,\nthey furprifed him ftnging and dancing among a company of peafants, who were\ngot together in an inn and were making merry. This event, fo fudden and un-\nforeseen,. and at the fame time fo dreadful in its confequences, ftruck him in fuch\na\n\fI$g A K E y T O P H Y S I C,\na manner, that, giving a great cry, he became at once altogether ftupid and in-\nfenfible, and was feized without the lead: refinance. They carried him away to\nGiocau, where he was brought before the council of war, and received fentence\nas a deferter. He buffered himfelf to be led and difpofed of at the will of thofe\nabout him, without uttering a word, or giving the lead; fign that he knew what\nhad happened or would happen to him. He remained immoveable as a ftatue\nwherever he was placed, and was wholly paffive with refped to all that was done\nto him or about him. During all the time that he was in cuftody, he neither ate,\nnor drank, nor dept, nor had any evacuation. Some of his comrades were fent\nto fee him \u2022, after that he was vifited by fome officers of his corps and by fome\nprieds ;\nbut he ftill continued in the fame ftate, without difcovering the lead; figns\nof fenfibility. Promifes, intreaties, and threatenings, were equally ineffedual.\nThe phyficians who were confulted upon his cafe were of opinion, that he was in\na ftate of hopelefs idiocy. It was at firft fufpeded, that thofe appearances were\nfeigned ; but thefe fulpicions neceffarily gave way, when it was known that he\ntook no fuftenance, and that the involuntary fundions of nature w'ere in great\nmeafure fufpended. After fome time they knocked off his fetters, and left him at\nliberty to go whither he would. He received his liberty with the fame infenfibility\nthat he had fhewed upon other occafions : he remained fixed and immoveable;\nhis eyes turned wildly here and there without taking cognizance of any objed, and\nthe mufcles of his face were fallen and fixed like thofe of a dead body. Being left\nto himfelf, he paffed twenty days in this condition, without eating, drinking, or\nany evacuation, and died on the twentieth day. He had been fometimes heard to\nfetch deep fighs ; and once he ruffied with great violence on a foldier, who had a\nmug of liquor in his hand, forced the mug from him, and having drank the\nliquor with great eagernefs, let the mug drop to the ground.\u201d\nWhen a pe Ton is affeded with terror, the principal endeavour ffiould be to re-\nftore the circulation to its due order, to promote perfpiration, and to allay the\nagitation of the patient. For thefe purpofes he may drink a little warm liquor,\nas camomile-tea, &c. the feet and legs may be put into warm water, the legs rub-\nbed, and the camomile-tea repeated every fix or eight minutes ; and when the fkin\nis warm, and there is a tendency to perfpiration, fleep may be promoted by a\ngentle opiate. But frights have been known not only to caufe, but alfo to cure,\ndifeafes. Mr. Boyle mentions agues, gout, and fciatica, cured by this means.\nTo turn from the ferious to the ludicrous effeds of fear, the following inftance\nof the latter fort, quoted from a French author by Mr. Andrews in his volume\nof ..nredotes, ffiews upon what flight occafions this paffion may be fometimes exp-\norted in a very high degree, even in perfons the moft unlikely to entertain fuch a\n2 gueft.\n\fAND. OCCULT SCIENCE. 1S9\ngueft. \u201cCharles Guftavus (the fucceffor of Chriftina of Sweden) was belieein\u201d\nPrague, when a boor of mod extraordinary vifage defired admittance to his tent;'\nand being allowed entrance, offered, by way of amufing the king, to devour a\nwhole hog of one hundred weight in his prefence. The old general Konigfmarcv\nwho flood by the king\u2019s fide, and who, loidier as he was, had not got rid of the\nprejudices of his childhood, hinted to his royal mafter that the peafant ought to be\nburnt as a forcerer. \u2018\nSir,\u2019 faid the fellow, irritated at the remark, \u2018\nif your ma-\njefty will but make that old gentleman take off his fword and his fpurs, 1 will eat\nhim immediately before I begin the hog.\n5\nGeneral Konigfmarc (who had, at the\nhead of a body of Swedes, performed wonders againft the Auftrians, and who was\nlooked upon as one of the bravefl men of the age) could not (land this propofal,\nefpecially as it was accompanied by a moll hideous and preternatural expanfion of\nthe frightful peafant\u2019s jaws. Without uttering a word, the veteran fuddenly turned\nround, ran out of the court, and thought not himfelf fafe until he had arrived at\nhis quarters; where he remained above twenty-four hours locked up fecurely, be-\nfore he got rid of the panic which had fo feverely affedled him.\u201d\nFear fhould not rife higher than to make us attentive and cautious; when it\ngains an afcendency in the mind, it becomes an infupportable tyranny, and ren-\nders life a burden. The objedt of fear is evil; and to be exempt from fear, or at\nleaf! not enflaved to it, gives dignity to our nature, and invigorates all our facul-\nties. Yet there are evils which we ought to fear. Thofc that arife from ourfelves,\nor which it is in our power to prevent, it would bemiadnefs to defpife, and auda-\ncity not to guard againft. External evils, which we cannot prevent, or could\nnot avoid without a breach of duty, it is manly and honourable to bear with for-\ntitude. Infenfibility to danger is not fortitude, no more than the incapacity of\nfeeling pain can be called patience; and to expofe ourfelves unneceffarily to evil is\nworfe than folly, and very blameable prefumption.\nOf IMPOTENCY occasioned by FEAR.\nIT has been proved by Dr. Hunter, that impotency is frequently the refult of\nfear. He obferves, that as the \u201c parts or generation are not neceffary for the\nexiftence or fupport of the individual, but have a reference to fomething elfe in\nwhich the mind has a principal concern ; fo a complete adtion in thofe parts can-\nnot take place without a perfedt harmony of body and of mind : that is, there muft\nbe both a power of body and difpofition of mind ; for the mind is fubjedt to a\nthoufand alarms, which affedt the adtions of thefe parts.\u2014Copulation is an adt of\nthe body, the fpring of which is in the mind ; but it is not volition : and according\nNo. 13. 3 C to\n\f3 go A KEY TO PHYSIC*\nto the ftate of the mind, fo is the aft performed. To perform this aft well, the\nbody fhould be in health, and the mind fhould be perfectly confident of the powers\nof the body: the mind fhould be in a fate entirely difengaged from every thing\nelfe ; it fhould have no difficulties, no fears, no apprehenfions, not even an\nanxiety to perform the a<5t well for even this anxiety is a ftate of mind different\nfrom what fhould prevail ; there fhould not be even a fear that the mind itfelf\nmay find a difficulty at the time the aft fhould be performed. Perhaps no function\nof the machine depends fo much upon the ftate of the mind as this. \u2014The will and\nreafoning faculty have nothing to do with this power; they are only employed in\nthe aft, fo far as voluntary parts are made ufe of ; and if they ever interfere, which\nthey fometimes do, it often produces another ftate of mind which deftroys that\nwhich is proper for the performance of the aft ; it produces a defire, a wifh, a\nhope, which are all only diffidence and uncertainty, and creare in the mind the\nidea of a poffibility of the want of fuccefs, which deftroys the proper ftate of mind\nor neceffary confidence.\u2014 There is perhaps no aft in which a man feels himfelf\nmore interefted, or is more anxious to perform well ; his pride being engaged in\nfome degree, which if within certain bounds would produce a degree of perfeftion\nin an aft depending upon the will, or an aft in voluntary parts ; but when it pro-\nduces a ftate of mind contrary to that ftate on which the perfeftion of the act de-\npends, a failure muft be the confequence.\u2014The body is not only rendered inca-\npable of performing this aft by the mind being under the above influence of fear,\nbut alfo by the mind being, though perfeftly confident of its power, yet confcious\nof an impropriety in performing it ; this, in many cafes, produces a ftate of mind\nwhich fhall take away all power. The ftate of a man\u2019s mind refpefting his After\ntakes away all power. A confcientious man has been known to lofe his powers on\nfinding the woman he was going to be connefted with unexpectedly a virgin.\u2014 Shed-\nding tears arifes entirely from the ftate of the mind, although not fo much a com-\npound action as the aft in queftion ;\nfor none are fo weak in body that they can-\nnot ihed tears \u2022, it is not fo much a compound action of the mind and ftrength of\nbody joined, as the other aft is ;\nyet if we are afraid of fhedding tears, or are de-\nfirous of doing it, and that anxiety is kept up through the whole of an affecting\nfcene, we certainly fhall not fhed tears, or at leaft not fo freely as would have\nhappened from our natural feelings.\nFrom this account of the neceffity of having the mind independent relpefting the\naft, we muft fee that it may very often happen that the ftate of mind will be luch\nas not to allow the animal to exert his natural powers \u2022, and every failure increafes\nthe evil. We muft alfo fee from this ftate of the cafe, that this act muft be often\ninterrupted ; and the true caufe of this interruption not being known, it will be\nlaid\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 191\nlaid to the charge of the body or want of powers. As thefe cafes do not arife from\nreal inability, they are to be carefully diftinguifhed from fuch as do \u2022, and perhaps\nthe only way to diftinguiflh them is, to examine into the ftate of mind refpefting\nthis aft. So trifling often is the circumftance which fhall produce this inability\ndepending on fear, that the very defire to pleafe fhall have that effeft, as in making\nthe-woman the foie object to be gratified.\nCafes of this kind we fee every day \u2022, one of which I fhall relate as an illuftration\nof this fubjeft, and alfo of the method of cure.\u2014A gentleman told me, that he\nhad loft his virility. After above an hour\u2019s inveftigation of the cafe, I made out\nthe following fafts : that he had at unneceflfary times ftrong ereftions, which\nfhewed that he had naturally this power ; that the ereftions were accompanied\nwith defire, which are all the natural powers wanted ; but that there was ftill a\ndefeft fomewhere, which I fuppofed to be from the mind. I inquired if all women\nwere alike to him ? his anfwer was. No; fome women he could have conneftion\nwith as well as ever. This brought the defeft, whatever it was, into a fmaller\ncompafs ; and it appeared there was but one woman that produced this inability^\nand that it arofe from a defire to perform the aft with this woman well ; which\ndefire produced in the mind a doubt or fear of the want of fuccefs, which was\nthe caufe of the inability of performing the aft. As this arofe entirely from the\nftate of the mind produced by a particular circumftance, the mind was to be ap-\nplied to for the cure ; and I told him that he might be cured, if he could perfeftly\nrely on his own power of felf-denial. When I explained what I meant, he told\nme that he could depend upon every aft of his will or refolution. I then told him,\nthat, if he had a perfeft confidence in himfelf in that refpeft, he was to go to bed\nto this woman, but firft promife to himfelf that he would not have any conneftion\nwith her for fix nights, let his inclinations and powers be what they would ; which\nhe engaged to do, and alfo to let me know the refult. About a fortnight after,\nhe told me, that this refolution had produced fuch a total alteration in the ftate\nof his mind, that the power foon took place ; for inftead of going to bed with the\nfear of inability, he went with fears that he fliould be pofifeflfed with too much\ndefire, too much power, fo as to become uneafy to him \u2022, which really happened j.\nfor he would have been happy to have (hortened the time : and when he had once\nbroke the fpell, the mind and powers went on together, and his mind never re-\nturned to its former ftate.\u201d\nImpotency alfo happens from a want of proper correfpondence between the\naftion of the tefticles and penis : for we find that an irregularity in the aftions of\nthefe parts fomeumes happen in men, producing impotence ; and fomething fimilar\nprobably may be one caufe. of barrennefs in women. In men, the parts fublervient\n\fto generation may be divided into two *. the effential, and the acceflory. The\ntefticles are the effential * the penis, &c. the acceffory. As this divifion arifes\nfrom their ufes or adions in health, which exadly correfpond with one another, a\nwant of exadnefs in the correfpondence or fufcepti bility of thofe actions may alfo\nbe divided into two : where the adions are reverfed, the acceffory taking place\nwithout the fir it or effential, as in eredions of the penis, where neither the mind\nnor the tefticles are ftimulated to adion and the fecond is where the tefticles per-\nform the adion of fecretion too readily for the penis, which has not a correfpond-\ning eredion. The firft is called priapifm *\nand the fecond is what ought to be\ncalled feminal weaknefs.\u2014The mind has confiderable effed on the correfpondence.\nof the adions of thefe two parts but it would appear in many inftances, that\neredions of the penis depend more on the ftate of the mind than the fecretion of\nthe femen does * for many have the fecretion, but not the eredion * but in fuch,\nthe want of eredion appears to be owing to fears of the mind only.\nPriapifm often arifes fpontaneouQy * and often from vifible irritation of the\npenis, as in the venereal gonorrhoea, efpecially when violent. The fenfation of\nfuch eredions is rather uneafy than pleafant ;\nnor is the feniation of the glans at\nthe time fimilar to that arifing from the eredions of defire, but more like to the\nfenfation of the parts immediately after coition. Such as arife fpontaneoufly are\nof more lerious confequence than thofe from inflammation, as they proceed pro-\nbably from caufes not curable in themfclves or by any known methods. The pria-\npifm ariflng from inflammation of the parts, as in a gonorrhoea, is attended with\nnearly the fame fymptoms ;\nbut generally the fenfation is that of pain, proceeding\nfrom the inflammation of the parts. It may be obferved, that what is Paid of pria-\npifm is only applicable to it when a difeale in itfelf, and not when a fymptom of\nother difeafes, which is frequently the cafe.\nSeminal weaknefs, or a fecretion and emiflion of the femen without eredions,\nis the reverfe of a priapifm, and is by much the worft difeafe of the two. There\nis great variety in the degrees of this difeafe, there being all the gradations from\nthe exad correfpondence of the adions of all the parts to the tefticles ading alone *\nin every cafe of the difeafe, there is too quick a fecretion and evacuation of the fe-\nmen. Like to the priapifm, it does not arife from defires and abilit ies ; although\nwhen mild it is attended with both, but not in a due proportion * a very flight de-\nfire often producing the full effed. The fecretion of the femen fhall be fo quick,\nthat Ample thought, or even toying, fhall make it flow. \u2014Dreams have produced\nthis evacuation repeatedly in the fame night \u2022, and even when the dreams have been\nfo flight* that there has been no confcioufnefs of them when the fleep has been\nbroken by the ad of emiflion. I have known cafes where the tefticles have been\nfo\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 193\nfo ready to fecrete, that the lead fridion on the glan 9 has produced an emifllon :\nI have known the fimple adion of walking or riding produce this effed, and that\nrepeatedly, in a very fhort fpace of time. A young man, about four or five and\ntwenty years of age, not fo much given to venery as moft young men, had thcfe\nlad-mentioned complaints upon him. Three or four times in the night he would\nemit ;\nand if he walked fad, or rode on horfeback, the fame thing would happen.\nHe could fcarcely have connection with a woman before he emitted, and in the\nemifllon there was hardly any fpafm. He tried every fuppofed ftrengthening me-\ndicine, as alfo the cold bath and fea-bathing, but with no effed. By taking\ntwenty drops of laudanum on going to bed, he prevented the night emiflions ;\nand by taking the fame quantity in the morning, he could walk or ride without\nthe before-mentioned inconvenience. I direded this practice to be continued for\nfome time, although the difeafe did not return, that the parts might be accudomed\nto this healthy date of adion \u2022, and I have reafon to believe the gentleman is now\nwell. It was found neceflary, as the conditution became more habituated to the\nopiate, to increafe the dofe of it.\u2014 -The fpafms, upon the evacuation of the femen\nin fuch cafes, are extremely flight, and a repetition of them foon takes place; the\nfirflemiflion not preventing a fecond ; the conditution being all the time but little\naffeded. When the tedicles ad alone, without the acceffory parts taking up the\nneceflary and natural confequent adion, it is dill a more melancholy difeafe : for\nthe fecretion arifes from no vifible or fenflble caufe, and does not give any viable\nor fenflble effed, but runs off fimilar to involuntary dools or urine. It has been\nobferved that the femen is more fluid than natural in fome of thele cafes.\nThere is great variety in the difeafed addons of thefe parts ; of which the follow-\ning cafe may be confidered as an example. A gentleman has had a dridure in the\nurethra for many years, for which he has frequently ufed a bougie, but of late has\nnegleded it. He has had no connedion with women for a confiderable time, being\nafraid of the confequences. He has often in his deep involuntary emiflions, which\ngenerally awake him at the paroxyfm ; but what furprifes him mod is, that often\nhe has fuch without any femen pafling forwards through the penis, which makes\nhim think that at thofe times it goes backwards into the bladder. This is not\nalways the cafe, for at other times the femen pafles forwards. At the time the\nfemen feems to pafs into the bladder, he has the eredion, the dream ; and is\nawaked with the fame mode of adion, the fame fenfation, and the fame pleafure,\nas when it pafles through the urethra, whether dreaming or waking. My opinion\nis, that the fame irritation takes place in the bulb of the urethra without the femen,\nthat takes place there when the femen enters, in confequence of all the natural\npreparatory fteps, whereby the very fame adions are excited as if it came into\nNo. 13. 3 D the\n\f194 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthe pafiage \u2022, from which one would fuppofe, that either thefemen is not fecreted j\nor if it be, that a retrograde motion takes place in the a&ions of the acceleratores\nurinse. But, if the firft be the cafe, then we may fuppofe, that in the natural date\nthe actions of thofe mufcles do not arife fimply from the flimulus of the femen in\nthe part, but from their adtion being a termination of a preceding one making\npart of a feries of actions. Thus they may depend upon thefridfion, or the ima-\ngination of a fridtion, on the penis-, the tefticles not doing their part, and the\nfpafm in fuch cafes arifing from the fridfion and not from the fecretion. In many\nof thofe cafes of irregularity, when the eredtion is not ftrong, it fhall go off with-\nout the emifiion ; and at other times an emiflion fhall happen almoft without an\neredtion but thefe arife not from debility, but affedtions of the mind. In many\nof the preceding cafes, wafhing the penis, fcrotum, and perinasum, with cold\nwater, is often of fervice j and, to render it colder than we find it in fome feafons\nof the year, common fait may be added to it, and the parts wafhed when the fait\nis almoft diffolved.\nOf GRIEF.\nGRIEF is the mofl deftrudlive of all the paffions. Its effedls are per-\nmanent, and when it finks deep into the mind, it generally proves fatal. An-\nger and fear being of a more violent nature, feldom laft long ; but grief often\nchanges into a fixed melancholy, which preys upon the fpirits, and waftes the\nconftitution. This paffion ought not to be indulged. It may generally be con-\nquered at the beginning j but, when it has gained ftrength, all attempts to remove\nit are vain. No perfon can prevent misfortunes in life 5 but it fhews true great-\nnefs of mind to bear them with ferenity. Many perfons make a merit of indulging\ngrief, and, when misfortunes happen, they obftinately refule all confolation,\ntill the mind, overwhelmed with melancholy, finks under the load. Such con-\ndudl is not only deftructive to health, but inconfiftent with reafon, religion, and\ncommon fenfe.\nChange of ideas is as nectffary for health as change of pofture. When the\nmind dwells long upon one iubjedt, efpecially of a dilagreeable nature, it hurts\nthe whole fundtions of the body. Hence grief indulged fpoils the digeffion and\ndetfroys the appetite j\nby which means the fpirits are depreffed, the nerves relaxed,\nthe bowels inflated with wind, and the humours, for want of frefh fupplies of chyle,\nvitiated. Thus many an excellent conftitution has been ruined by a family mis-\nfortune, or any thing that occafions exctfiive grief. It is utterly impoffible, that\nany perfon of a dejedted mind fhould enjoy health. Life may indeed be dragged\nout for a few years : but whoever would live to a good old age muft be good-\nhumoured\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 195\nhumoured and cheerful. This indeed is not altogether in our own power j\nyet\nour temper of mind, as well as our adtions, depend greatly upon ourfelves. We\ncan either affociate with cheerful or melancholy companions, mingle in the amufe-\nments and offices of life-, or fit ftill and brood over our calamities, as we choofe.\nThefe, and many fuch things, are certainly in our power, and from thefe the\nmind generally takes its caft.\u2014The variety of fcenes which prelent themfelves to\nthe lenles, were certainly defigned to prevent our attention from being too long\nfixed upon any one objedt. Nature abounds with variety, and the mind, unlefs\nfixed down by habit, delights in contemplating new objedts. This at once points\nout the method of relieving the mind in diftrefs. Turn the attenrion frequently to\nnew objedts : examine them for fome time: when the mind begins to recoil, fhift\nthe fcene : by this means a conftant lucceffion of new ideas may be kept up, till\nthe difagreeable ones entirely dilappear. Thus travelling, the ftudy of any art or\nfcience, reading or writing on fuch fubjedts as deeply engage the attention, will\nfooner expel grief than the moft fprightly amufements.\nIt has already been obferved, that the body cannot be healthy unlefs it be exer-\ncifed ;\nneither can the mind. Indolence nouriffies grief. When the mind has no-\nthing elle to think of but calamities, no wonder that it dwells there. Few people\nwho purfue bufinefs with attention are hurt by grief. Inftead therefore of abftradt-\ning ourfelves from the world or bufinefs, when misfortunes happen, we ought to\nengage in it with more than ufual attention, to difcharge with double diligence\nthe fundtions of our ftation, and to mix with friends of a cheerful and focial tem-\nper. Innocent amufements are by no means to be negledted. Thefe, by leading\nthe mind infenfibly to the contemplation of agreeable objedts, help to difpel the\ngloom which misfortunes caft over it. They make time leem lefs tedious, and\nhave many other happy effedts. Some perfons, when overwhelmed with grief,\nbetake themfelves to drinking. This is making the cure worfe than the difeafe.\nIt leldom fails to end in the ruin of fortune, charadter, and conftitutiom\nOf LOVE.\nLOVE is perhaps the ftrongeft of all the paffions j\nat leaft, when it becomes\nviolent, it is lels fubjedt to the controul either of the underftanding or will, than\nany of the reft. Fear, anger, and feveral other paffions, are neceffiary for the\nprefervation of the individual, but love is neceffiary for the continuation of the\nfpecies itfelf : it was therefore proper that this paffion ffiould be deeply rooted in\nthe human breaft.\u2014 Though love be a ftrong paffion, it is feldom fo rapid in its\nprogrefs as feveral of the others. Few perfons fall delperately in love all at once.\nWe would therefore advife every one, before he tampers with this paffion, to con-\nfide?\n\ft$6 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfider well the probability of his being able to obtain the object of his love.\nWhen that is not likely, he fhould avoid every occafion of increafing it. He\nought immediately to fly the company of the beloved objedl ; to apply his mind\nattentively to bufinefs or ftudy ; to take every kind of amufement ; and, above\nall, to endeavour, if poflible, to find another objedl which may engage his affec-\ntions, and which it may be in his power to obtain. There is no paflion with\nwhich people are fo ready to tamper as love, although none is more dangerous.\nSome men make love for amufement, others from mere vanity, or on purpofe to\nfhew their confequence with the fair. This is perhaps the greateft piece of cruelty\nwhich any one can be guilty of. What we eagerly wifh for, we eafily credit.\nHence the too credulous fair are often betrayed into a fituation which is truly de-\nplorable, before they are able to difcover that the pretended lover was only in jeft.\nBut there is no jefting with this paflion. When love is got to a certain height, it\nadmits of no other cure but the poflefllon of its objedl, which, in this cafe, ought\nalways if poflible to be obtained. The condudt of parents with regard to the dif-\npofal of their children in marriage is often very blameable. An advantageous\nmatch is the conftant aim of parents ; while their children often fuffer a real mar-\ntyrdom betwixt their inclinations and duty. The firfl: thing which parents ought\nto confult, in difpofing of their children in marriage, is certainly their inclinations.\nWr\nere due regard always paid to thefe, there would be fewer unhappy couples, and\nparents would not have fo often caufe to repent the feverity of their condudt, after\na ruined conftitution, a loll character, or a diftradled mind, has fhewn them their\nmiftake.\nWith regard to love, in its ufual and more appropriate fignification, it may\nbe defined, \u201c that affedtion which, being compounded of animal defire, efteem,\nand benevolence, becomes the bond of attachment and union between individuals\nof the different fexes ; and makes them feel in the fociety of each other a fpecies\nof happinefs which they experience no where elfe.\u201d We call it an affedtion rather\nthan a paflion, becaufe it involves a defire of the happinefs of its objedl : and that\nits conftituent parts are thofe which have been jufl enumerated, we fhall firfl: en-\ndeavour to prove, and then proceed to trace its rife and progrefs from a felfifh\nappetite to a generous fentiment.\nAnimal defire is the adlual energy of the fenfual appetite; and that it is an\neflential part of the complex affedlion, which is properly called love, is apparent\nfrom this confideration, that, though a man may have fentiments ofefteem and bene-\nvolence towards women who are both old and ugly, he never fuppofes himfelf to\nbe in love with any woman towards whom he feels not the fenfual appetite to have\na ftronger tendency than to other individuals of her fex. On the other hand, that\ni animal\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE; 197\nanimal defire alone cannot 'oe called the affedtion of love is evident ; becaufe he\nwho gratifies fuch a defire without efteeming its objedt, and wifhing to communi-\ncate at the fame time that he receives enjoyment, loves not the woman, but him-\nfelf. Mere animal defire has nothing in view but the fpecies and the fex of its\nobjedl ; and before it make a felection, it mud be combined with fentiments very\ndifferent from itfelf. The firft fentiment with which it is combined, and by\nwhich a man is induced to prefer one woman to another, feems to be that by which\nwe are delighted with gracefulnefs of perfon, regularity of features, and beauty of\ncomplexion. It is not indeed to be denied that there is fomething irrefiflible in\nfemale beauty. The moft fevere will not pretend, that they do not feel an imme-\ndiate prepofieflicn in favour of a handfome woman ; but this prepofiefiion, even\nwhen combined with animal defire, does not conftitute the whole of that affection\nwhich is called love. Savages feel the influence of the fenfual appetite, and it is\nextremely probable that they have fome ideas of beauty j but among favages\nthe affection of love is feldom felt. Even among the lower orders in civil fociety\nit feems to be a very grofs pafllon, and to have in it more of the felfifhnefs of\nappetite than of the generofity of efteem. To thefe obfervations many exceptions\nwill no doubt be found, but we fpeak of favages in general, and of the great body\nof the labouring poor, who in the choice of their mates do not ftudy\u2014who indeed\nare incapable of ftudying\u2014that reflitude of mind and thofe delicacies of fentiment,\nwithout which neither man nor woman can deferve to be efteemed.\nIn the favage ftate, and even in the firft ftages of refinement, the bond of\nunion between the fexes feems to confift of nothing more than mere animal defire\nand inftindtive tendernefs for their infant progeny. The former impels them to\nunite for the propagation of the fpecies ; and the latter preferves the union till\nthe children, who are the fruit of it, are able to provide for their own fubfiftence.\nThat in fuch unions, whether cafual or permanent, there is no mutual efteem and\nbenevolence, is apparent from the ftate of fubje&ion in which women are held\nin rude and uncultivated nations, as well as from the manner in which marriages\nare in fuch nations contra&ed.\nSweetnefs of temper, a capital article with us in the female character, difplays\nitfelf externally in mild looks and gentle manners, and is the firft and perhaps the\nmoft powerful inducement to love in a cultivated mind. But fuch graces are fcarce\ndifcernible in a female favage ; and even in the moft polifhed woman would not\nbe perceived by a male favage. Among favages, ftrength and boldnefs are the\nonly valuable qualities. In thefe, females are miferably deficient j\nfor which\nreafon they are contemned by the males as beings of an inferior order.

To join young perfons in marriage is\naccordingly the bufinefs of the parents ; and it would be unpardonable meannefs in\nthe bridegroom to fhew any fondnefs for the bride. In Guiana a woman never\neats with her hufband, but after every meal attends him with water for wafhing-,\nand in the Caribbee iflands fhe is not permitted to eat even in the prefence of her\nhufband. Dampier obferves in general, that among all the wild nations with\nwhich he was acquainted, the women carry the burdens, while the men walk be-\nfore and carry nothing but their arms ; and that women even of the highefl rank\nare not better treated. In Siberia, and even in Rufila, the capital excepted, men\ntill very lately treated their wives in every refped like flaves. It might indeed be\nthought, that animal defire, were there nothing elfe, fhould have raifed women\nto fome degree of eftimation among men \u2022, but male favages, utter ftrangers to\ndecency and refinement, gratify animal defire with as little ceremony as they do\nhunger or thirft.\nHence it was that in the early ages of fociety a man purchafed a woman to be\nhis wife as one purchafes an ox or a fheep to be food \u2022, and valued her only as fhe\ncontributed to his fenfual gratification. Inftances innumerable might be colleded\nfrom every nation of which we are acquainted with the early hiftoryj but we (hall\ncontent ourfelves with mentioning a few. Abraham bought Rcbekah, and gave\nher to his fon Ifaac for a wife. Jacob, having nothing elfe to give, ferved Laban\nfourteen years for two wives. To David, demanding Saul\u2019s daughter in marriage,\nit was faid, \u201c the king defireth not any dowry, but an hundred forefkins of the\nPhiliftines.\u201d In the Iliad, Agamemnon offers his daughter to Achilles for a wife;\nand fays that he would not demand for her any price. By the laws of Ethelbert\nking of England, a man who committed adultery with his neighbour\u2019s wife was\nobliged to pay the hufband a fine, and to buy him another wife. But it is needlefs\nto multiply inftances * the pradice has prevailed univerfally among nations emerg-\ning from the favage ftate, or in the rudeft ftage of fociety ; and wherever it pre-\nvailed, men could not poffibly have for the fair fex any of that tender regard and\nefteem which conftitute fo effential a part of the complex affedion of love.\nBut if among favages and the vulgar, love be unknown, it cannot poffibly be\nan inftindive affedion ; and therefore it may be afked, How it gets poffeffion of\nthe human heart-, and by what means we can judge whether in any particular\ninftance it be real or imaginary ?

Love, therefore, has a natural tendency to make\nmen and women pair, or, in other words, it is the fource of marriage : but in\npolifhed fociety, where alone this affeftion has any place, fo many things befides\nmutual attachment are neceflary to make the married life comfortable, that we\nrarely fee young perfons uniting from the impulfe of love, and have therefore but\nfew opportunities of tracing the rife, progrefs, 2nd confequences, of the affedtion.\nWe fhall, however, throw together fuch reflections as have occurred to us on\nthe fubjedt, not without indulging a hope, that they may be ufeful to the younger\npart of our readers when forming the mod important connection in life.\nWe have faid, that the perception of beauty, combined with animal defire, is\nthe firft inducement which a man can have to prefer one woman to another. It\nmay be added, that elegance of figure, a placid mafculine countenance, with a\nperfon which indicates ftrength and agility, are the qualities which firft tend to\nattach any woman to a particular man. Beauty is defined, \u201c That particular form,\nwhich is the moft common of all particular forms to be met with in the fame fpe-\ncies of beings.\u201d Let us apply this definition to our own fpecies, and try, by\nmeans of it, to afcertain what conftitutes the beauty of the human face. It is\nevident, that of countenances we find a number almoft infinite of different forms,\nof which forms one only conftitutes beauty, whilft the reft, however numerous,\nconftitute what is not beauty, but deformity, or uglinefs. To an attentive ob-\nferver, however, it is evident, that of the numerous particular forms of uglinefs,\nthere is not one which includes fo many faces as are formed after that particular\ncaft which conftitutes beauty. Every particular fpecies of the animal as well as of\nthe vegetable creation, may be faid to have a fixed or determinate form, to which,\nas to a centre, nature is continually inclining. Or it may be compared to pendu-\nlums vibrating in different directions over one central point \u2022, and as they all crofs\nthe centre, though only one pafles through any other point, fo it will be round\nthat perfeCt beauty is oftener produced by nature than deformity : we do not\nmean than deformity in general, but than any one kind and degree of deformity.\nTo inftance in a particular part of a human feature: the line which forms the\nridge of the nofe is deemed beautiful when it isftraight; but this is likewife the\ncentral form, which is oftener found than any one particular degree of concave,\nconvex, or any other irregular form that (hall be propofed. As we are then more\naccuftomed to beauty than deformity, we may conclude that to be the reafon why\nwe approve and admire it, juft as we approve and admire fafhions of drefs for na\nother reafon than that we are ufed to them. The lame thing may be faid of colour\nas of form : it is cuftom alone which determines our preference of the colour of\nthe Europeans to that of the Ethiopians, and which makes them prefer their own\ncolour\n\f20\n0\nA KEY TO PHYSIC,\ncolour to ours; fo that though h&bit and cuftom cannot be the caufe of beauty,\nthey are certainly the caufe of our liking it. That we do like it cannot be denied.\nEvery one is confcious of a pleafmg emotion when contemplating beauty either in\nman or woman ; and when that pleafure is combined with the gratification of the\nfenfual appetite, it is obvious that the fum of enjoyment muft be greatly increaled.\nThe perception of beauty, therefore, neceffarily directs the energy of the fenfual\nappetite to a particular obje<5t \u2022, but ftill this combination is a mere felfifh feeling,\nwhich regards its obje<5t only as the beft of many fimilar inftruments of pleafure.\nBefore it can deferve the name of love, it muft be combined with efteem, which is\nnever beftowed but upon moral chara&er and internal worth ; for let a woman be\never fo beautiful, and of courfe ever fo defirable as an inftrument of fenfual gratis\nfication, if fhe be not poffeffed of the virtues and difpofitions which are peculiar to\nher fex, fhe will infpire no man with a generous affecftion. With regard to the\noutlines, indeed, whether of internal dilpofition or of external form, men and\nwomen are the fame j but nature, intending them for mates, has given them dif-\npofitions, which, though concordant, are, however, different, fo as to produce\ntogether delicious harmony. The man, more robuft, is fitted for fevere labour,\nand for field exercifes ; the woman, more delicate, is fitted for fedentary occu-\npations, and particularly for nurfing children. The man, bold and vigorous, is\nqualified for being a protestor ;\nthe woman, delicate and timid, requires protec-\ntion. Hence it is, that a man never admires a woman for poffefting bodily ftrength\nor perfonal courage ; and women always defpife men who are deftitute of them.\nThe man, as a protestor, is directed by nature to govern ; the woman, confcious\nof inferiority, is difpofed to obey. Their intellectual powers correfpond to the\ndeftination of nature. Men have penetration and folid judgment to fit them for\ngoverning * women have underftanding to make an engaging figure under good\ngovernment : a greater proportion would excite dangerous rival fhip between the\nfexes, which nature has avoided by giving them different talents. Women have\nmore imagination and fenfibility than men, which make all their enjoyments more\nexquifite ; at the fame time that they are better qualified to communicate enjoy-\nment. Add another capital difference of difpofition : the gentle and infinuating\nmanners of the female fex tend to foften the roughnefs of the other fex ; and wher-\never women are indulged with any freedom, they polifh fooner than men.\nThefe are not the only particulars that diftinguifh the fexes. With refpeCt to\nthe ultimate end of love, it is the privilege of the male, as fuperior and protestor,\nto make a choice : the female, preferred, has no privilege but barely to confent,\nor to refufe. Whether this diftinClion be the immediate refult of the originally\ndifferent difpofitions of the fexes, or only the effeCt of affociations inevitably form-\ned.\ni\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 201\ned, may be queftioned ; but among all nations it is the practice for men to court,\nand for women to be courted : and were the moft beautiful woman on earth to\ninvert this practice, fhe would forfeit the efteem, however by her external grace\nfhe might excite the defire, of the man whom fhe addreffed. The great moral\nvirtues which may be comprehended under the general term integrity, are all\nabfolutely neceffary to make either men or women eftimable > but to procure efteem\nto the female charadter, the modefty peculiar to their fex is a very efiential circum-\nftance. Nature hath provided them with it as a defence againft the artful folici-\ntations of the other fex before marriage, and alfo as a fupport of conjugal fidelity.\nA woman, therefore, whofe difpofitions are gentle, delicate, and rather timid\nthan bold, who is poffefied of a large lhare of fenftbility and modefty, and whofe\nmanners are fofc and infinuating, mult, upon moral principles, command the\nefteem and benevolence of every individual of the other fex who is poffefied of\nfound underftanding \u2022, but if her perfon be deformed, or not fuch as to excite\nfome degree of animal defire, fhe will attract no man\u2019s love. In like manner, a\nman whofe moral character is good, whofe underftanding is acute, and whofe con-\nverfation is inftrudive, mult command the efteem of every fenfible and virtuous\nwoman \u2022, but if his figure be difagreeable, his manners unpolifhed, his habits\nflovenly, and above all, if he be deficient in personal courage, he will hardly\nexcite defire in the female breaft. It is only when the qualities which command\nefteem are, in the fame perfon, united with thofe which excite defire, that the\nindividual fo accomplifhed can be an objedt of love to one of the other fex*, but\nwhen thefe qualities are thus united, each of them increafes the other in the ima-\ngination of the lover. The beauty of his miftrefs gives her, in his apprehenfion,\na greater fhare of gentlenefs, modefty, and every thing which adorns the female\ncharadter, than perhaps fhe really pofiefles ; whilft his perfuafion of her internal\nworth makes him, on the other hand, apprehend her beauty to be abfolutely\nunrivalled.\nThe affedtion thus generated is more or lefs pure, and will be more or lefs per-\nmanent, according as the one or the other part of which it is compounded, pre-\ndominates. Where defire of poffeflion prevails over our efteem of the perfon and\nmerits of the defirable objedt, love lofes its benevolent charadter ; the appetite\nfor gratification becomes ungovernable, and tends violently to its end, regardlefs\nof the mifery that muft follow. In that ftate love is no longer a fweet agreeable\naffedtion ;\nit becomes a felfifh, painful paffion, which, like hunger and thirft,\nproduceth no happinefs but in the inftant of fruition ; and when fruition is over,\ndifguft and averfion generally fucceed to defire. On the other hand, where efteem,\nfounded on a virtuous character and gentle manners, prevails over animal defire.\nNo. 13. 3 F the\n\f\u2022202 A KEY TO PHYSI C,\nthe love- would not for the world gratify his appetite at the expence of a lady's\nhonour, or peace of mind. He wifihes, indeed, for enjoyment*, and to him en-\njoyment is more exquifne than to the mere fenfual lover, becaufe it unites fenti-\nment with the gratification of fenfe ; at the fame time that, fo far from being fuc-\nceeded b# difguft or averfion, it increafes his benevolence to the woman, whofe\ncharacter and manners he edeems, and who has contributed fo much to his plea-\nfure. Benevolence to an individual, having a general end, admits of adls without\nnumber, and is feldom fully accomplished. Hence mutual love, which is com-\npofed chiefly of efteem and benevolence, can hardly be of a fhorter duration than\nits objeds. Frequent enjoyment endears fuch lovers to each other, and makes\ncondancy a pleafure*, and when the days of fenfual enjoyment are over, edeem and\nbenevolence will remain in the mind, making fweet, even in old age, the fociety\nof that pair, in whom are colleded the affections of hufband, wife, lover, friend,\nthe tendered: affedions of human nature.\nFrom the whole of this invedigation, we think it appears, that the affedion be-\ntween the fexes which deferves the name of love, is infeparably conneded with\nvirtue and delicacy *, that a man of gallantry cannot be a faithful or a generous\nlover \u2022, that in the bread: of him who has ranged from woman to woman for the\nmere gratification of his fenfual appetite, defire muff have effaced all efleem for\nthe female character; and that, therefore, the maxim too generally received,\n\u201c that a reformed rake makes the bed hufband,\u201d has very feldom a chance to be\ntrue. We think it may likewife be inferred, that thou fands fancy themfelves in\nlove who know not what love is, or how it is generated in the human bread *, and\ntherefore we beg leave to aclvife fuch of our readers as may imagine themfelves to\nbe in that date, to examine their own minds, with a view to difcover, whether,\nif the objeds of their love were old or ugly, they would dill edeem them for the\nvirtues pf their charader, and the propriety of their manners. This is a quedion\nwhich deferves to be well weighed by the young and amorous, who, in forming\nthe matrimonial connedion, are too often blindly impelled by mere animal defire,\ninflamed by beauty. It may indeed happen, after the pleafure of gratifying that\ndefire is gone, (and if not refined by edeem and benevolence, go it mud with a\nfwifc pace), that a new bond of attachment may be formed upon more dignified\nand more lading principles ; but this is a dangerous experiment. Even fuppofing\noood fenfe, good temper, and internal worth of every fort, yet a new attachment\nupon fuch qualifications, is rarely formed ; becaufe it commonly, or rather always,\nhappens, that fuch qualifications, the only folid foundation of an indiffoluble con-\nr.edion, if they did not originally make edeem predominate over animal defire, are\nafterwards rendered altogether invifible by fatiety of enjoyment creating difgud,\nwhich\n\f2C3\nand occult science.\nwhich is generally the cafe with violent love, founded on the defire of enjoyment\nonly. As the delicate nature of female honour and decorum, and the inexpreflible\ngrace of a chafleand modeft behaviour, are the fureft and indeed the only means of\nkindling at firft, and ever after of keeping alive, this tender and elegant flame,\nand of accomplifhing the excellent ends defigned by it ; to attempt by fraud to\nviolate one, or, under pretence of pafflon, to fully and corrupt the other, and,\nby fo doing, to expofe the too often credulous and unguarded objedt, with a warn\nton cruelty, to the hatred of her own fex and the fcorn of ours, and to the loweft\ninfamy of both, is a condudt not only bafe and criminal, but inconfiftent with that\ntruly rational and refined enjoyment, the fpirit and quinteflence of which is\nderived from the bafhful and facred charms of virtue kept untainted, and there-\nfore ever alluring to the lover\u2019s heart.\nThe fymptoms produced by love as a difeafe, are as follow : the eye-lids often\ntwinkle-, the eyes are hollow, and yet appear as if full with pleafure: the pulfe\nis not peculiar to the paflion, but the fame with that which attends folicitude and\ncare. When the objedt of this afFedtion is thought of, particularly if the idea is\nfudden, the fpirits are confufed, the pulfe changes, and its force and time are very\nvariable : in feme inftances, the perfon is fad and watchful ; in others, not being\nconfcious of his ftate, he pines away, is flothful, and regardlefs of food. As the\npaflion prevails, fighs grow deeper -, a tremor affedts the heart and pulfe ; the\ncountenance is alternately pale and red j the voice is fupprefled ; the eyes grow\ndim-, cold fweats break out -,\nfleep abfents itfelf -,\nthe fecretions become difturbed ;\nand a lofs of appetite, a hedtic fever, melancholy, or perhaps madnefs, or death,\nconftitutes the fad cataftrophe.

Such were\nthe ingredients that entered into the compofition of that infernal draught a love\npotion.\n\f204 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\npotion. The antidotes againft love were generally agnus cajlus, which has the\npower of weakening the generative faculty ; fprinkling the dull in which a mule\nhad rolled herlelf ; tying toads in the hide of a beaft newly (lain i\napplying amu-\nlets of minerals or herbs, which were fuppofed of great efficacy.\nOf MELANCHOLY.\nTHE pathology of melancholy and mania is very obfcure j as coming on with-\nout any fever, or difturbance in the blood\u2019s motion. Often alfo they are hereditary,\ndepending on the original ftrudture of the body, efpecially of the brain *, the fault\nof which, however, cannot be detedted by the niceft anatomift. But it is well\nknown, that various difeafes of the brain, obftrudtions, tumors, either of the\nbrain itfelf, or of the cranium preffing upon it, any injury done to the head, and,\nas fome phyficians relate, the hardnefs and drinefs of the brain, and fome peculiar\nirritations affedting the nervous fyftem, are capable of bringing on this malady.\n.\nAnd indeed fo great are the irritations affedting the nervous fyftem in mad people,\nthat they often fleep little or none for a long time. Yet even this fo defedtive and\nimperfedt knowledge of the difeafes of the brain and nerves, is by no means free\nfrom difficulties. For though we know that the brain, or a certain part of it, is\nhurt, or that it is irritated by a fwelling, or a pointed bone growing into it, no-\nbody can foretel how great, or what may be the nature of the malady from fuch\na hurt : for examples are not wanting of people who, after lofing a large part of\nthe brain, have recovered and lived a long time \u2022, or of thofe who have perceived\nno inconvenience from a large portion of that vifcus being corrupted, until at\nlength they have fallen fuddenly down and died in convulfions.\nMany perfons of a religious turn of mind behave as if they thought it a crime to\nbe cheerful. They imagine the whole of religion confifts in certain mortifications,\nor denying themfelves the fmalleft indulgence, even of the moft innocent amufe-\nments. A perpetual gloom hangs upon their countenances, while the deepeft\nmelancholy preys upon their minds. At length the faireft profpedts vaniffi, every\nthing puts on a difmal appearance, and thofe very objedts which ought to give\ndelight afford nothing but difguft. Life itfelf becomes a burden, and the un-\nhappy wretch, perfuaded that no evil can equal what he feels, often puts an end\nto his own miferable exiftence. It is great pity that ever religion fhould be fo far\nperverted, as to become the caufe of thofe very evils which it was defigned to\nprevent. Nothing can be better calculated than true religion, to raife and\nfupport the mind of its votaries under every afflidtion that can befal them. It\nteaches thorn, that even the fufferings of this life are preparatory to the happinefs\nof\n\f205\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nof the next \u2022, and that all who perlift in a courfe of virtue fhall at length arrive at\ncomplete felicity.\nPerfons whofe bufinefs it is to recommend religion to others, fhould beware of\ndwelling too much on gloomy fubjetts. That peace and tranquillity of mind,\nwhich true religion is calculated to infpire, is a more powerful argument in its\nfavour, than all the terrors that can be uttered. Terror may indeed deter men\nfrom outward a\u00a3ts of wickednefs ;\nbut can never infpire them with that love of\nGod, and real goodnefs of heart, in which alone true religion confifts. In fhort,\nthe beft way to counteract the violence of any palTion, is to keep the mind clofely\nengaged in fome ufeful purfuit.\nOf the PROGNOSTICS of DISEASES; with RULES\nfor Preserving Health.\nPROGNOSTIC is a judgment of the event either of a Hate of health, or of a\ndifeafe ; as, whether it fhall end in life or death, be long or fhort, mild or malig-\nnant, &c. taken from certain fymptoms thereof. When, by the following remarks,\nthe perfon fhall judge what dilorder is coming upon him, or already prefent, a fafe\nand effectual remedy will in general be found in the Medical Part of the Herbal;\nbut, whenever that work is not fufficiendy full to the purpofe, I fhall add fuch oc-\ncafional obfervations for prevention and cure as have occurred to me in my late\npractice.\nHippocrates was the firft who treated of medicine in a regular and rational man-\nner, and he is therefore juftly confidered as the father of phyfic. Hippocrates re-\nmarked four ftages in diftempers ; viz. the beginning of the difeafe, its augmenta-\ntion, its ftate or height, and its declination. In fuch difeafes as terminate fatally,\ndeath comes in place of declination. In the third ftage, therefore, the change is\nmoft confiderable, as it determines the fate of the lick perfon ; and this is mold com-\nmonly done by means of a crifis. By this word he underflood any fudden change in\nficknefs, whether for the better or for the worfe, whether health or death fucceed\nimmediately. Such a change, he fays, is made at that time by nature, either abfol-\nving or condemning the patient. Hence we may conclude, that Hippocrates ima-\ngined difeafes to be only adiflurbance of the animal economy, with which Nature\nwas perpetually at variance, and uftng her utmoft endeavours to expel the offending\ncaufe. Her manner of aCting on thefe occafions is to reduce to their natural\nft ate thofe humours whofe difcord occafions the difturbance of the whole body,\nwhether in relation to their quantity, quality, mixture, motion, or any other way\nin which they become offensive. The principal means employed by nature for this\nNo. 14. 3 G end\n\f206 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nend is what Hippocrates calls concodtion. By this he underftood the bringing the\nmorbific matter lodged in the humours to fuch a (late, as to beeafily fitted for ex-\npulfion by whatever means nature might think moft proper. When matters are\nbrought tothispafs, whatever is fuperfiuous or hurtful immediately empties itfelf, or\nnature points out to phyficians the way by which fuch an evacuation is to be accom-\nplifhed. The crifis takes place either by bleeding, ftool, vomit, fweat, urine, tu-\nmors or abfcefies, fcabs, pimples, fpots, &c. But thefe evacuations are not to be\nlooked upon as the efFedls of a true crifis, unlefs in confiderable quantity \u2022, fmall\ndifcharges not being fufficient to make a crifis ; which, on the contrary, area fign\nthat nature is deprefied by the load of humours, and that fbe lets them go\nthrough weaknefs and continual irritation. What comes forth in this manner is\ncrude, becaufe the diftemper is yet tooftrong-, and while matters remain in this\nftate, only a bad or imperfect crifis is to be expedted. This (hows that the dif-\ntemper triumphs, or at lead: is equal in ftrength to nature, which prognofticates\ndeath, oraprolongation of thedifeafe. In this laft cafe, however, nature often has an\nopportunity of attempting a new crifis more happy than the former, after having\nmade frefh efforts to advance the concodtion of the humours.\u2014It muft here beob-\nferved, however, that, according to Hippocrates, concodtion cannot be made but\nin a certain time, as every fruit has a limited time to ripen *, for he compares the\nhumours which nature has digefted to fruits come to maturity. The time required\nfor concodtion depends on the differences among diftempers mentioned above. In\nthofe which Hippocrates calls very acute, the digeftion or crifis happens by the\nfourth day ; in thofe which are only acute, it happens on the feventh, eleventh,\nor fourteenth day \u2022, which lafl is the longeft period generally allowed by Hippocrates\nin diftempers that are truly acute : though in fome places he ftretches it to the twen-\ntieth, or twenty-firft, nay, fometimes to the fortieth or fixtieth, days. All difeafes\nthat exceed this laft term are called chronical. And while in thofe difeafes that ex-\nceed fourteen, days, he confiders every fourth day as critical, or at leaft remarkable,\nby which we may judge whether the crifis on the fourth day will be favourable or\nnot\n;\nfo in thofe which run from twenty to forty he reckons only the fevenths, and\nin thofe that exceed forty he begins to reckon by twenty. Beyond the hundred\nand twentieth he thinks that the number of days has no power over the crifis.\nThey are then referred to the general changes of the feafons ; fome terminating\nabout the equinoxes ; others about the folftices ^ others about the rifing or fetting\nof the ftars t^ertain conftellations ;\nor, if numbers have yet any place, he reckons\nby months, or even whole years. Thus (he fays), certain difeafes in children have\ntheir crifis in the feventh month after their birth, and others in their feventh or even\ntheir fourteenth year.\nI Though\n\f20\/\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nThough Hippocrates mentions the twenty-firft as one of the critical days in acute\ndiftempers, as already noticed *, yet, in other places of his works, he mentions alfo\nthe twentieth. The reafon he gives for this in one of thofe places of his works is,\nthat the days of ficknefs were not quite entire. In general, however, he is much\nattached to the odd days : infomuch that in one of his aphorifms he tells us, \u201c The\nfweats that come out upon the third, fifth, ieventh, ninth, eleventh, four-\nteen, feventeenth, twenty-firft, twenty-feventh, thirty-firft, or thirty-fourth, days,\nare beneficial ;\nbut thofe that come out upon other days fignify that the fick fhall be\nbrought low, that his difeafe fhall be very tedious, and that he (hall be fubjedt to\nrelapfes .'\n5\nHe further fays, \u201c That the fever which leaves the fick upon any but an\nodd day is ufually apt to relapfe.\u201d Sometimes, however, he confeftes that it is other-\nwife \u2022, and he gives an inftance of a falutary crifis happening on the fixth day. But\nthefe are very rare inftances, and therefore cannot, in his opinion, overthrow the\ngeneral rule. Befides the crifis, however, or the change which determines the fate\nof the patient, Hippocrates often fpeaks of another, which only changes the fpecies\nof the diftemper, without reftoring the patient to health ; as when a vertigo is turn-\ned to an epilepfy, a tertian fever to a quartan, or to a continual, &c.\nBut what chiefly contributed to procure the vaft refpedl generally paid to Hippo-\ncrates, was his accuracy in prognoftics : thus he not only diftinguifhed one difeafe\nfrom another by the figns which properly belonged to each ; but by comparing\nthe fame fort of diftemper which happened to feveral perfons, and the accidents\nwhich ufually appeared before and after, he could often foretel a difeafe before it\ncame, and afterwards give a right judgment of the event of it. By this way of prog-\nnofticating, he came to be exceedingly admired: and this he carried to fuch a\nheight, that it may juftly be faid to be his matter-piece ; and Celfus, who lived,\nafter him, remarks, that fucceeding phyficians, though they found out feveral new\nthings relating to the management of difeafes, yet were obliged to the writings of\nHippocrates for all that they knew of figns. The firft thing Hippocrates confider-\ned, when called to a patient, was his looks. \u2014It was a good fign with him to have\na vifage refembling that of a perfon in health, and the fame with what the fick man\nhad before he was attacked by the difeafe. As it varied from this, fo much the\ngreater danger was apprehended. The following is the defcription which he gives\nof the looks of a dying man:\u2014\u201c When a patient (fays he) has hisnofe fharp, his eyes-\nfunk, his temples hollowy his ears cold and contra&ed, the fkinofhis forehead\ntenfe and dry, and the colour of his face tending to a pale-green, or lead-colour,,\none may give out for certain that death is very near at hand ; unlefs the ftrength of\nthe patient has been exhaufted all at once by long watchings, or by a loofenefs, or\nbeing aflong time without eating. \u201d This obfervation has been confirmed by thofe\nof\n\f468 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nof fucceeding phyficians, who have, from him, denominated it the Hippocratic\nface. The lips hanging relaxed and cold, are likewife looked upon by this author\nas a confirmation of the foregoing prognoftic. He took alfo his figns from the\ndifpofition of the eyes in particular. When a patient cannot bear the light ; when\nhe fheds tears involuntary j when, in fleeping, fome part of the white of the eye is\nfeen, unlefs he ufually deeps after that manner, or has a loofenefs upon him : thefe\ndgns, as well as the foregoing ones, prognofticate danger. The eyes deadened,\nwith a mid before them, or their brightnefs loft, prefages death, or great weaknefs.\nEyes fparkling, fierce, and fixed, denote the patient to be delirious, or that he foon\nwill be feized with a frenzy. \"When the patient fees any thing red, and like fparks\nof fire and lightning pafs before his eyes, you may expect an hemorrhage and\nthis often happens before thofe crifes which are to be attended by a lofs of blood.\nThe condition of the patient is alfo fhown by his pofture in bed. If you find him\nlying on one fide, his body, neck, legs, and arms, a little contracted, which is the\npofture of a man in health, it is a good fign : on the contrary, if he lies on his back,\nhis arms ftretched out, and his legs hanging down, it is a fign of great weaknefs;\nand particularly when the patient Aides or lets himfelf fall down towards the feet,\nit denotes the approach of death. When a patient in a burning fever is continually\nfeeling about with his hands and fingers, and moves them up before his face and\neyes as if he was going to take away fomething that paffed before them ; or on his\nbed-covering, as if he was picking or fearching for little-ftraws, or taking away\nfome filth, or drawing out little flocks of wool j all this is a fign that he is delirious,\nand that he will die. Amongft the other figns of a prefent or approaching delirium,\nhe alfo adds this : When a patient who naturally fpeaks little begins to talk more\nthan he ufed to do, or when one that talks much becomes filent, this change is to\nbe reckoned a fort of delirium, or is a fign that the patient will foon fall into one.\nThe frequent trembling or ftarting of the tendons of the wrifts prefage likewife a\ndelirium. As to the different forts of delirium, Hippocrates is much more afraid\nof thofe that run upon mournful fubjeCts than fuch as are accompanied with\nmirth.\nWhen a patient breathes faft, and is opprefled, it is a fign that he is in pain, and\nthat the parts above the diaphragm are inflamed. Breathing long, or when the\npatient is a great while in taking his breath, fhows him to be delirious ; but eafy\nand natural refpiration is always a good fign in acute difeafes. Hippocrates depended\nmuch on the refpiration in making his prognoftics \u2022, and therefore has taken care in\nfeveral places to defcribe the different manner of a patient\u2019s breathing. Continual\nwatchings in acute difeafes, are figns of prefent pain, or a delirium near at hand.\nHippocrates alfo drew figns from all excrements, whatever they are, that are fepa-\nrated\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 209\nrated from the body of man. His molt remarkable prognoftics, however, were\nfrom the urine. The patient\u2019s urine, in his opinion, is beft when the fediment is\nwhite, foft to the touch, and of an equal confiftence. If it continue fo during the\ncourfe of the diftemper, and till the time of the crifis, the patient is in no danger,\nand will foon be well. This is what Hippocrates called concodted urine, or what\ndenotes the concodtion of the humours *, and he obferved, that this concodtion of\nthe urine feldom appeared thoroughly but on the days of the crifis which happily\nput an end to the diftemper. \u201c We ought (faid Hippocrates) to compare the urine\nwith the purulent matter which runs from ulcers. As the pus, which is white, and\nof the fame quality with the fediment of the urine we are now fpeaking of, is a fign\nthat the ulcer is on the point of clofing \u2022, fo that which is clear, and of another co-\nlour than white, and of an ill fmell, is a fign that the ulcer is virulent, and there-\nfore very difficult to be cured: the urines that are like this we have deferibed\nare only thofe which may be named good ;\nall the reft are ill, and differ from one\nanother only in the degrees of more and lefs. The firft never appear but when na-\nture has overcome the difeafe *, and are a fign of the concodtion of humours, with-\nout which you cannot hope fora certain cure. On the contrary, the laft are made\nas long as the crudity remains, and the humours continue unconcodted. Among\nthe urines of this laft fort, the beft are reddifh, with a fediment that is foft, and\nof an equal confiftence ;\nwhich denotes, that the difeafe will be fomewhat tedi-\nous, but without danger. The worft are thofe which are very red, and at the fame\ntime clear and without fediment ; or that are muddy and troubled in the making.\nIn urine there is often a fort of cloud hanging in the veffel in which it is received ;\nthe higher this rifes, or the farther diftant it is from the bottom, or the more differ-\nent from the colour of the laudable fediment above-mentioned, the more there is of\ncrudity. That which is yellow, or of a fandy colour, denotes abundance of bile \\\nthat which is black is the worft, efpecially if it has an ill fmell, and is either alto-\ngether muddy or altogether clear. That whofe fediment is like large ground wheat,\nor little flakes or fcales fpread one upon another, or bran, prefages ill, efpecially\nthe laft. The fat or oil that fometimes fwims upon the top of the urine, and ap-\npears in a form fomething like a fpider\u2019s web, is a fign of a confumption of the\nflefh and folid parts. The making of a great quantity of urine is the fign of a crifis,\nand fometimes the quality of it fhows how the bladder is affedled. We muff alfo\nobferve, that Hippocrates compared the ftate of the tongue with the urine ; that is\nto fay, when the tongue was yellow, and charged with bile, the urine he knew muft\nof courfe be of the fame colour : and, when the tongue was red and moift, the urine\nwas of its natural colour. His prognoftics from the excretions by ftool are as follow 1\nThofe that are foft, yellowilh, of fome confiftence, and not of an extraordinary ill\nNo. 14. 3 H fmell,\n\f210 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfmell, that anfwer to the quantity of what is taken inwardly, and that are voided at\nthe ufual hours, are the beft of all. They ought alfo to be of a thicker confiftence\nwhen the diftemper is near the crifis ; and it ought to be taken for a good prognof-\ntic, when fome worms, round and long, are evacuated at the fame time with them.\nT he prognofis, however, may ftill be favourable, though the matter excreted be\nthin and liquid, provided it make not too much noife in coming our, and the eva-\ncuation be not in a fmall quantity nor too often, fo as to make the patient faint. All\nmatter that is watery, white, of a pale green, or red, or frothy and vifcous, is bad.\nThat which is blackifh, or of a livid hue, is the mod' pernicious. That which is\npure black, and nothing elfe but a difcharge of black bile, always prognofticates\nvery ill ;\nthis humour, from what part foever it comes, fhowing the ill difpofition\nof the inteftines. The matter that is of feveral different colours denotes the length\nof the diftemper ; and, at the fame time, that it may be of dangerous confequence.\nHippocrates places in the fame clafs the matter that is bilious or yellow, mixed\nwith blood, or green and black, or like the dregs or fcrapings of the guts. The\n{tools that confift of pure bile, or entirely of phlegm, he alfo looks upon to be very\nbad. Matter caft up by vomiting ought to be mixed with bile and phlegm ; where\nOne of thefe humours only is obferved, it is worfe. That which is black, livid,\ngreen, or the colour of a leek, indicates alarming confequences. The fame is to be\nfaid of that which fmells very ill \u2022, and, if at the fame time it be livid, death is not\nfar off. The vomiting of blood is very often mortal. The fpittings which give\neafe in difeafes of the lungs and in pleurifies, are thofe that come up readily and\nwithout difficulty ;\nand it is good if they be mixed at the beginning with much yel-\nlow : but if they appear of the fame colour, or are red, a great while after the begin -\nning of the diftemper, are fait and acrimonious, and caufe violent coughings, they\nare not good. Spittings purely yellow are bad ; and thofe that are white, vifcous,\nand frothy, givenoeafe. Whitenefs is a good fign of concoChon in regard to ipit-\ntings v but they ought not at all to be vifcous, nor too thick, nor too clear. We\nmay make the fame judgment of the excrements of the nofe according to their con-\nco&ion and crudity. Spittings that are black, green, and red, are of bad confeqence-\nIn inflammations of the lungs, thofe that are mixed with bile and blood prefage well\nif they appear at the beginning, but are bad if they arife not about the feventh day.\nBut the worft fign in thefe diftempers is, when there is no expectoration at all, and\nthe too great quantity of matter that is ready to be dilcharged this way makes a rat-\ntling in the breaft. After fpitting of blood, the difcharge of purulent matter often\nfollows, which brings on a confumption, and at laft death. A kind good fweat is\nthat which arifes on the day of the crifis, and is difcharged in abundance all over the\nbody, and at the fame time from all parts of the body, and thus carries off the fe-\nver.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 212\nver. A cold fweat is alarming, efpecially in acute fevers, for in others it is only a\nfign of long continuance. When the patient fweats no where but on the head and\nneck, it is a fign that the difeafe will be long and dangerous. A gentle fweat in\nfome particular part, of the head and bread, for indance, gives no relief, but de-\nnotes the feat of the didemper, or the weaknefs of the part. This kind of fweat was\ncalled by Hippocrates ephidrofis. The hypochondria, or the abdomen in general,\nought always to be foft and even, as well on the right fide as on the left. When\nthere is any hardnefs or unevennafs in thofe parts, or heat and fwellings, or when\nthe patient cannot bear to have it touched, it is a fign the intedines are indifpofed.\nHippocrates alfo inquired into the date of the pulfe, or the beating of the\narteries. The mod ancient phyficians, however, and even Hippocrates himfclf,\nfor a long time, by this word underdood the violent pulfation that is felt in an in-\nflamed part, without putting the fingers to it. It is obferved by Galen, and other\nphyficians, that Hippocrates touches on the fubjecl of the pulfe more dightly than\nany other on which he treats. But that our celebrated phyfician underdood fome-\nthingeven on this fubjedd, is eafily gathered from feveral padages in his writings ;\nas when heobferves, that in acute fevers the pulfe is very quick and very great i\nand when he makes mention, in the fame place, of trembling pulfes, and thofe that\nbeat (lowly \u2022, when he obferves, that in fome difeafes incident to women, when the\npulfe drikes the finger faintly, and in a languifhing manner, it is a fign of ap-\nproaching death. He remarks alfo, in the Coacae Prasnotiones, that he whofe\nvein, that is to fay, whofe artery of the elbow, beats, is jud going to run mad, or\nelfe that the perfon is at that time very much under the influence of anger. Many\nother variations of the pulfe are enumerated by phyficians, but mod of them un-\ncertain, and not confirmed by experience. See the Article Pulfe, in the Medical\nPart of the Herbal, where the fubjedl is more fully treated.\nWe (hall now proceed to fome farther remarks on the prognodics of particular\ndifeafes.\nThe tertian ague hath one prognodic peculiar to itfelf, namely, dry fcabby ulcers\nbreaking out upon the lips \u2022, thefe fometimes appear about the third or fourth\nparoxyfm ; and then we may venture to foretel that the difeafe will go off fponta-\nneoufly after the feventh.\nThe following are the prognodics of a nervous fever ; and therefore, when they\nappear, people (hould take precautions accordingly, by confulting the Medical\nPart of the Herbal, for a fafe and certain preventative and cure : the patient at fird\ngrows fomewhat lidlefs,and feels flight chills, and fhudders, with uncertain fluflies\nof heat, and a kind of wearinefs all over, like what is felt after great fatigue. This\nis always attended with a fort of heavinefs and dejedtion of fpirit, and more or lefs\nof\n\f212 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nof a load, pain, or giddinefs of the head ; a naufea and difrelifh of every thing foon\nfollows, without any confiderable thirft, but frequently with urging to vomit,\nthough little but infipid phlegm is brought up. Though a kind of lucid interval\nof feveral hours fometimes intervenes, yet the fymptoms return with aggravation,\nefpecially towards night ; the head grows more giddy or heavy ; the heat greater j\nthe pulfe quicker, but weak ; with an oppreffive kind of breathing. A great tor-\npor, or obtufe pain and coldnefs, affects the hinder-part of the head frequently,\nand oftentimes a heavy pain is felt on the top all along the coronary future ; this,\nand that of the back-part of the head, generally attend nervous fevers, and are\ncommonly fucceeded by fome degree of a delirium. In this condition the patient\noften continues for five or fix days, with a heavy, pale, funk, countenance ; feem-\ningly not very fick, and yet far from being well ; reftlefs, anxious, and common-\nly quite void of fieep, though fometimes very drowfy and heavy ; but, although he\nappears to thofe about him actually to fieep, he is utterly infenfible of it, and denies\nthat he doth fo. The pulfe during all this time is quick, weak, and unequal ;\nfometimes fluttering, and fometimes for a few moment flow ; nay, even intermit-\nting, and then, with a fudden flufli in the face, immediately very quick, and per-\nhaps foon after furprifingly calm and equal ; and thus alternately.\nPrognoses of a fcarlet fever : with various general fymptoms of fever, the pa-\ntient at fir ft complains of a dejection of fpirits, a flight forenefs or rather ftiffnefs in\nthe neck, with a fenfe of ftraightnefs in the mufcles of the neck and fhoulders, as\nif they were bound with cords. The fecond day of the fever this forenefs in the\nthroat increafes, and the patients find a difficulty in fwallowing; but the difficulty\nfeems lefs occafioned by the pain excited in the attempt, or by the ftraitnefs of the\npafiage, than by an inability to throw the necefiary mufcles into adtion. The fkin\nfeels hot and dry, but not hard \u2022, and the patients experience frequent fmall pun-\ngent pains, as if touched with the point of a needle. The breath is hot and burning\nto the lips, and thirft makes them wiffito drink \u2022, but the tendency to ficknefs, and\nthe exertions necefiary in deglutition, are fo unpleafant, that they feldom care to\ndrink much at a time. They have much uneafinefs alfo from want of reft during\nthe night. In the morning of the third day, the face, neck, and breaft, appear\nredder than ufual : in a few hours this rednefs becomes univerfal ; and increafes to\nfuch a degree ofintenfity, that the face, body, and limbs, refemble a boiled lobfter -\nin colour, and are evidently fwollen.\nThe figns of an impending phrenitis, or inflammation of the brain, are fully ex-\nplained in the Medical Part of this work. In the difeafe, the following are the moft\nfatal fymptoms : A continual and furious delirium, with watching \u2022, thin watery\ni urine,\n\f2X3\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nurine, white feces, the urine and ftools running off involuntarily, or a total fup-\npreffion of thefe excretions ; a ready difpoficion to become ftupid, or to faint ; trem-\nbling, rigour, chattering of the teeth, convulfions, hiccough, coldnefs of the extre-\nmites, trembling of the tongue, fni ill voice, a fudden ceffation of pain, with ap-\nparent tranquillity. The following are favourable: Sweats, apparently critical,\nbreaking out\na\nfeeming effort of nature to terminate the difeafe by a diarrhoea-,\na large hemorrhage from the nofe ; fwellings of the glands behind the ears ;\nhaemorrhoids.\nA vertigo is obferved to be both the fymptom and forerunner of feme dangerous\ndifeafes fuch as apoplexy, epilepfy, hyfteria ; haemorrhages from the nofe and\nother parts ; fuppreffions of the menfes plethora ; fevers, as well fuch as are\naccompanied with debility as thofe in which there is an increafed impetus of the\nblood towards the head.\u2014Though a vertigo be for the moft part a fymptom and con-\ncomitant of other difeafes, yet it is fometimes a primary difeafe, returning at inter-\nvals, increafing gradually, and equally impeding and deftroying the functions of the\nbody and mind.\nA delirium accompanies fevers of many different kinds. Sometimes it is\nflight, eafily removed, and fcarcely to be accounted a bad fign. Often, however,\nit is very violent, and one of the very word; of figns, requiring the utmoft care and\nattention. A delirium is either fierce or mild. The fierce delirium is preceded and\naccompanied by a rednefs of the countenance, a pain of the head, a great beating\nof the arteries, and noife in the ears the eyes in the mean time looking red, infla-\nmed, fierce, fhining, and unable to bear the light ; there is either no deep at all,\nor deep troubled with horrid dreams -, the wonted manners are changed, an unu-\nfual peevifhnefs and ill-nature prevail. The depravation of judgement is firft obfer-\nved between deep and waking, and by the perfon\u2019s crediting his imagination, while\nthe perceptions of fenle are neglebted, and the ideas of memory occur in an irregular\nmanner. Fury at lad: takes place, and fometimes an unufual and incredible degree\nof bodily flrength, fo thatfcveral people can fcarce keep a fingle patient in his bed.\nThe mild delirium, on the contrary, is often accompanied with a weak pulfe, a\npale collapfed countenance, and a vertigo when the patient fits in an ereft pollute ;\nhe is feldom angry, but often ftupid, and fometimes remarkably grieved and fear-\nful. The lofs of judgment, as in the former kind, is firft perceived when the\npatient is half awake ;\nbut a temporary recovery enfues upon the admiffion of the\nlio-ht and the converfation of his friends. The patient mutters much to himfclf,\nand attends little to the things around him -, atlaft, becoming quite ftupid, he nei-\nther feels the fenfations of hunger or third:, nor any of the other propenfities of na-\nture, by which means the urine and excrements are voided involuntarily. As the\nvr of diforder\nMo. 14. 3 A\n\f214 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ndiforder increafes, it terminates in fubfultus tendinum, tremors, convulfions,\nfainting, and death. The other fpecies of delirium alfo frequently terminates in\nthis, when the fpirits and ftrength of the patient begin to fail. The fymptoms ac-\ncompanying either of thefe kinds of delirium Ihow an unufual, inordinate, and une-\nqual, motion of the blood through the brain, and a great change in that ftate of it\nwhich is neceffary to the exercife of the mental powers. It is fufficiently probable,\nthat an inflammation of the brain, more or lefs violent and general, fometimes takes\nplace, although the figns of uni^erfal inflammation are frequently flight. This we\nlearn from the difledtion of dead bodies, which often fliovv an unufual rednefs of\nthe brain or of lome of its parts, or fometimes an effuflon or fuppuration.\nThe prognoftics of the malignant, putrid, or ulcerous, fore throat, are very\ndifferent in different perfons. Sometimes a rigour, with fulnefs and forenefs of the\nthroat, and painful ftiffnefs of the neck, are the fir ft fymptoms complained of.\nSometimes alternate chills and heats, withfome degree ofgiddinefs, drowfmefs, or\nhead-ach, ufher in the diflemper. It feizes others with much more feverifh fymp-\ntoms ;\ngreat pain of the head, back, and limbs ; a vafl oppreflion of the praecordia,\nand continual fighing. Some grown perfons go about for fome days in a droop-\ning ftate, with much uneafinefs and anxiety, till at lafl they are obliged to take to\ntheir beds.\u2014Thus various is the difeafe at the onfet. But it commonly begins with\nchills and heats, load and pain of the head, forenefs of throat, and hoarfenels ;\nfome cough, ficknefs at ftomach, frequent vomiting and purging, in children\nefpecially, and fometimes very fevere ; though a contrary ftate is more common to\nthe adult. There is commonly a very great dejection of fpirits, very fudden weak-\nnefs, great heavinefs on the breaft, and faintnefs, from the very beginning. The\npulfe in general is quick, fmall, and fluttering, though fometimes heavy and undu-\nlating. The eyes heavy, reddifh, and as it were weeping *, the countenance often\nfull, flufhed, and bloated, though fometimes pale, and funk. The following are\nthe prognoftics in the difeafe:\u2014If agentle eafy fweatcomes on the third or fourth day ;\nif the pulfe becomes more flow, firm, and equal \u2022, if the floughs of the fauces caft off\nin a kindly manner, and appear at the bottom tolerably clean and florid ; if the brea-\nthing is more foft and free, and fome degree of vigour and quicknefs return in the\neyes ;\nall is well, and afalutary crifis follows foon by a continuance of the fweat, and\na turbid, fubfiding, farinaceous, urine, a plentiful expectoration, and a very large\ndefquamation of the cuticle. But if a rigour comes on, and the exanthemata fud-\ndenly difappear or turn livid *, if the pulfe grows very fmall and quick, and the fkin\nremains hot and parched as it were; the breathing more difficult, the eyes dead and\nglaffy, the urine pale and limpid ; a phrenzy or coma may be expedted to fucceed\n\f215\nand occult science.\nwith a coldifh clammy fweat on the face or extremities ; life will now be delpair ed\nof, efpecially if a fingultus and choaking or gulping in the throat fhould attend,\nwith hidden, liquid, involuntary, livid, ftools, intolerably fetid.\nSymptoms of the croup, or inflammation of the glottis. A hoarfenefs, with fome\nfhrillnefs and ringing found, both in fpeaking and coughing, as if the noife came\nfrom a brazen tube. At the fame time, there is a fenfe of pain about the larynx,\nfome difficulty of refpi ration, witha whizzing found in infpiration, as if the paffage\nof the air were ftraitened. The cough which attends it is commonly dry ; and, if\nany thing be fpit up, it is a matter of a purulent appearance, and fometimes films\nrefembling portions of a membrane. With all thefe fymptoms, there is a frequen-\ncy of pulfe, a reftleffnefs, and an uneafy fenfe of heat. When the internal fauces\nare viewed, they are fometimes without any appearance of inflammation \u2022, but fre-\nquently a rednefs, and even fwelling, appears-, and fometimes there is an appear-\nance of matter like to that rejected by coughing, together with the fymptoms now\ndefcribed, and particularly with great difficulty of breathing, and a fenfe of ftrang-\nling in the fauces, by which the patient is fometimes fuddenly taken off.\nIn a pleurify the pathognomonic figns are a cough, a difficulty of breathing, a\npain of the fide, and a continued fever -,\nthe adjunct figns are the various forts of\nmatter expectorated, which are fometimes bloody, fometimes bilious, &c. When\nthe pains, which at firft affeCted one fide only, (hall afterwards fpread into the other >\nor when, leaving the fide firft affeCted, they pafs entirely into the other-, thefe are\nalways marks of a dangerous difeafe. A delirium coming on during a pneumonic\ninflammation is always a fymptom denoting much danger. VenefeCtion is the re-\nmedy chiefly to be depended on y and may be done in either arm, as the furgeon\nfinds mod convenient -, and the quantity taken away ought in general to be as large\nas the patient\u2019s ftrength will allow. Befides bleeding, every part of the antiphlo-\ngiftic regimen ought here to be carefully employed : the patient muft keep out of\nbed as much as he can bear-, muft have plenty of warm diluting drinks, impregna-\nted with vegetable acids, accompanied with nitre or fome other cooling neutral fait 5,\nand the belly alfo ought to be kept open by emollient glyfters or cooling laxative\nmedicines. Vomiting in the beginning is dangerous ; but in a fomewhat advan-\nced ftate of the difeafe emetics have been found the beft means of promoting expec-\ntoration. Fomentations and poultices to the pained part have been found uleful ;\nbut bliftering is found to be much more effectual. A blifter, however, ought not\nto be applied till at leaft one bleeding hath been premifed, as venefeCtion is lefs ef-\nfectual when the irritation of a blifter is prefent. If the difeafe be moderate, a blif-\nter may be applied immediately after the firft bleeding ; but in violent cafes, where\nk\n\f21\n6\nA K E Y TO PHYSIC,\nit may be prefumed that a fecond bleeding may foon be neceffary after the firft, it\nwill be proper to delay the blifter till after the fecond bleeding, when it may be fup-\npofed that the irritation occafioned by the blifter will be over before a third bleed-\ning becomes neceffary. It may frequently be of ufe in this difeafe to repeat the\nbliftering ;\nand in that cafe the plafters ffiould always be applied fomewhere on the\nthorax, for when applied to more diftant parts they have little effebt. The keep-\ning the bliftered parts open, and making what is called a perpetual blifter, has\nmuchlefs effebt than a repeated bliftering. When this difeafe terminates unfavoura-\nbly it often ends in an empyema, which is occafioned by the effufion of a quantity\nof purulent matter into the cavity of the thorax, producing a lingering and painful\ndiforder, very often incurable. The firft fignofan empyema is a ceffation of the\npain in the breaft, which before was continual : this is followed by a fenfation of\nweight on the diaphragm ; and a fiubtuation of matter, fometimes making a noife\nthat may be heard by the by-ftanders : the acute fever is changed into a hectic, with\nan exacerbation at night : a continual and troublefome dry cough remains. The\nrefpiration is exceedingly difficult, becaufe the lungs are prevented by the matter\nfrom fully expanding themfelves. The patient can lie eafiiy on that fide where the\nmatter is effufed, but not on the other, becaufe then the weight of the matter on\nthe mediaftinum produces uneafinefs. The more thehedic heat is augmented, the\nmore is the body emaciated, and its ftrength decayed. In fome there is danger of\nfuffocation when they ftoop down, which goes off when they alter that poft-\nure of the body ; and in fome there is a purulent fpitting. \u2014Thefe fymptoms are\naccompanied with great anxiety, palpitations of the heart, and faintings. Very\nfew recover after an empyema has been once formed, efpecially if the operation\nparacentefis be negleded. After this operation is performed, if a great quantity of\nbloody fetid pus be difcharged, if the fever continue, and if the patient fpit up a\npurulent, pale, frothy, livid, or green, matter, with a decay of ftrength, there is\nno hope : but when a final 1 quantity of pus, of a white colour, not very fetid, is dif-\ncharged ; when the fever and thirft prefently ceafe, the appetite returns, and faeces\nof a good confiftence are difcharged, the ftrength alfo returning in fome degree ;\nthere is then hope of a perfebt recovery. If the matter be not dried up in feven weeks\ntime, the difeafe readily changes to a fiftuious ulcer, which is very difficult to cure.\nAn empyema affebting both fides of the thorax is more dangerous than that which\naffebts only one.\nThe inflammation of the heart is attended with all the fymptoms before mention-\ned, but in a higher degree ; it is befides fometimes accompanied with hydrophobic\nfymptoms, fainting, palpitation of the heart, a feeming madnefs, a funk and\nirregular pulle, watery eyes, and a dejebted countenance, with a dry black tongue.\nThe\ni\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 217\nThe figns of an inflammation of the ftomach are great heat and pain in the\nepigaftric region, extreme anxiety, an almoft continual and painful hiccough, with\na mod painful vomiting of every thing taken into the ftomach. This difeafe is\nalways very dangerous, and the prognofis doubtful, which alfo muft always be in\nproportion to the feverity of the fymptoms. A ceflationof pain, coldnefs about the\npraecordia, great debility, with a languid and intermitting pulfe, and an abatement\nof the hiccough, denote a gangrene and fpeedy death. From the lenfibility of the\nftomach alfo, and its great connection with the reft of thefyftem, it muft be obvious,\nthat an inflammation of it, by whatever caufes produced, may be attended with fatal\nconfequences ;\nparticularly, by the great debility it produces, it may prove fuddenly\nfatal, without running through the ufual courfe of inflammations.\u2014 Its tendency to\nadmit of refolution may be known by its having arifen from no violent caule, by the\nmoderate ftate of the fymptoms, and by a gradual remiffion of thefe in the courfe\nof the firft or at moft of the fecond week of the difeafe. The tendency to gangrene\nmay be fufpedted from the fymptoms continuing with unremitting violence, not-\nwithftanding the ufe of proper remedies ; and a gangrene already begun may be\nknown by the fymptoms above-mentioned, particularly great debility and fudden\nceflation of pain. The tendency to fuppuration may be known by the fymptoms\ncontinuing but in a moderate degree for more than one or two weeks, and by a\nconfiderable remiffion of the pain while a fenfe of weight and anxiety ftill remain.\nWhen an abcefs has been formed, the frequency of the pulfe is firft abated, butfoon\nafter it increafes, with frequent cold ftiivering, and an exacerbation in the after-\nnoon and evening ; followed by night-fweats, and other fymptoms of hectic fever.\nThefe at length prove fatal, unlefs the abcefs open into the cavity of the ftomach,\nthe pus be evacuated by vomiting, and the ulcer foon healed.\nAn inflammation of the inteftines flaews itfelf by a fixed pain in the abdomen,\nattended with fever, vomiting, and coftivenefs. The pain is often felt in different\nparts of the abdomen, but more frequently fpreads over the whale, and is particu-\nlarly violent about the navel. Inflammations of the inteftines may arife from the\nfame caufes as thofe of the ftomach , though commonly the former will more rea-\ndily occur from cold applied to the lower extremities, or to the belly itfelf. It is\nalfo found furpervening on thefpafmodic cholic, incarcerated hernia, and volvulus.\nThe inflammations of the inteftines have the fame terminations with thofe of the\nftomach, and the prognofis in both cafes is much the fame.\nInflammation of the liver is attended with confiderable fever ; a frequent, ftrong,\nand hard, pulfe; high-coloured urine ; an acute pain in the right hypochondrium,\nincreafed by preffing upon the part. The pain is very often in fuch a part of the fide\nas to make it appear like a pleurify j and frequently, like that, is increafed on infpi-\nNo. 14. *\n3 K ration.\n\f2i8 a k e y t o p h y s i c,\nration. The difeafe is alfo commonly attended with a cough, which is generally\ndry, but fometimes moid ; and, when the pain thus refembles a pleurify, the patient\ncannot lie eafily except upon the fide affedted. The pain is frequently extended to\nthe clavicle, and to the top of the fhouldcr ; and is attended fometimes with hic-\ncough, and fometimes with vomiting. The inflammation of the liver, like others,\nmay end by refolution, fuppuration, or gangrene \u2022, and the tendency to the one or\nto the other of thofe events may be known from what has been already mentioned.\nInflammation of the fpleen, comes on with a remarkable fhivering, fiucceeded by a\nmod intenfe heat and very great third \u2022, a pain and tumour are perceived in the left\nhypochondrium, and the paroxydns for the mod part aflame a quartan form. When\nthe patients expofe themfelves for a little to the free air, their extremities immediately\ngrow very cold. If an haemorrhage happens, the blood flows out of the left nodril.\nIt is often a very difficult matter to didinguiffi rheumatifm from gout : but in\nrheumatifm there in general occurs much lels affedtion of the domach ; it affedts\nchiefly the larger joints, and often feveral of them at the fame time : it occurs at an\nearlier period of life than gout \u2022, it is not obferved to be herditary \u2022, and it can in ge-\nneral be traced to fomeobvious exciting caufe, particularly to the adtion of cold. To\ndidinguifli the chronic rheumatifm from the acute: when the pains are dill ready to\ndrift their place ; when they are efpecially fevere in the night-time \u2022, when, at the\nfame time, they are attended with fome degree of pyrexia, and with fome fwelling,\nand efpecially fome rednefs, of the joints ; the difeafe is to beconfidered as partaking\nof the nature of the acute rheumatifm. But when there is no longer any degree of\npyrexia remaining ; when the pained joints are without rednefs ; when they are cold\nand diff; when they cannot eafily be made to fweat ; or when, while a free and warm\nfweat is brought out on the red of the body, it is only clammy and cold on the pain-\ned joints ; and when, further, the pains of thefe are increafed by cold, and relieved by\nbeat, applied to them; the cafe is to be confidered as that of a purely chronic rheu-\nmatifm : or perhaps more properly the fird of the conditions now defcribed may be\ntermed the date of irritability, and the fecond the date of atony. The chronic rheu-\nmatifm, or rather the atonic, may affedl diflferentjoints ; but efpecially apt to affedl is\nthofe which are furrounded with many mufcles, and thofe of which the mufclesare em-\nployed in the mod condant and vigorous exertions. Such is the cafe of the vertebrae\nof the loins, the affedtion of which is named lumbago ; or of the hip-joint, when the\ndifeafe is named ifchias or fciatica. Violent drains and fpafms, occurring on fudden\nand fomewhat violent exertions, bring on rheumatic affedlions, which at fird partake\nof the chronic rheumatifm. Such are frequently the lumbago, and other affedlions\nwhich feem to be more feated the mufcles than in thejoints. The didindtion of the\nrheumatic pains from thofe refembling them which occur in the fiphylis and fcurvy\nmud\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 219\nmull be obvious, either from the feat of the pains or from the concomitant fymp-\ntoms peculiar to thofe difeafes. What we call a paroxyfm of the gout is principally\nconftituted by an inflammatory affedlion of fome of the joints. This fometimes\ncomes on fuddenly, without any warning, but is generally preceded by feveral fymp-\ntoms ;\nfuch as the ceafing of a fweating which the feet had been commonly affetted\nwith before ; an unufual coldnefs of the feet and legs ; a frequent nutnbnefs, alter-\nnating with a fenfeof prickling along the whole of the lower extremities \u2022, frequent\ncramps of the mufcles of the legs ; and an unufual turgefcence of the veins. While\nthefe fymptoms take place in the lower extremities, the body is affedted with fome\ndegree of torpor and languor, and the functions of the ftomach in particular are\nmore or lefs difturbed. The appetite is diminilhed ; and flatulency, or other fymp-\ntoms of indigeftion, are felt. Thefe fymptoms take place for feveral days, fome-\ntimes for a week or two, before a paroxyfm comes on but commonly, upon the\nday immediately preceding it, the appetite becomes keener than ufual. It is common-\nly fuppofed, that there are fome cafes of rheumatifm which are fcarcely to be diftin-\nguifhed from the gout : but thefe, Dr. Cullen thinks, are but few y and that the\ntwo difeafes may be for the moft part diftinguifhed with great certainty, by obferving\nthe pre-difpofltion, the antecedent circumftances, the parts affedled, the recurren-\nces of the difeafe, and its connexion with the fyflem \u2022, which circumftances, for the\nmoft part, appear very differently in the two difeafes.\nPrognoftics that a perfon is infedted with the plague : 1. Great lofs of ftrength. 2.\nStupor, giddinefs, and consequent ftaggering, which refembles drunkennefs, or the\nhead-ach and various delirium. 3. Anxiety, palpitation, fyncope, and eipecially\nthe weaknels and irregularity of the pulfe, denoting a confiderable difturbance in the\nadtion of the heart. 4. Naulea and vomiting, particularly the vomiting of bile,\nwhich (how an accumulation of vitiated bile in the gall-bladder and biliary dudts, and\nfrom thence derived into the inteftines and ftomach \u2022, which alfo denote a confidera-\nble fpalm, and lots of tone in the extreme veffels on the furface of the body.\n1 he fmall-pox begins with a fynocha or inflammatory fever. It generally comes\non about mid-day, with fome fymptoms of a cold ftage, and commonly with a con -\nfiderable langour and drowfinefs. A hot ftage is foon formed, and becomes more\nconfiderable on the fecond and third day. During this courfe children are liable to\nfrequent ifartings from their (lumbers \u2022, and adults, if they are kept in bed, are dif-\npofed to much fweating. On the third day, children are fbmetimes affedted with\none or two epileptic fits. Towards the end of the third day the eruption commonly\nappears. The principal marks by which the chicken-pox may be diftinguifhed from\nthe fmall-pox are, 1. T he appearance, on the fecond or third day from the eruption,\nof that veficle full ofierum upon the top of the pock. 2. The cruft, which covers\nthe\n\f220 A K E4\nY TO PHYSIC,\nthe pocks on the fifth day ; at which time thofe of the fmali-pox are not at the height\nof their fuppu ration. Foreign medical writers hardly ever mention the name of\nthis diftemper : and the writers of our own country fcarcely mention any thing more\nof it than its name. Morton fpeaks of it as if he fuppofed it to be a very mild genuine\nfmall-pox. But thefe two diftempers are furely totally different from one another,\nnotonlyon account of their different appearances above-mentioned, but becaufe thofe\nwho have had the fmall-pox are capable of being inferred with the chicken-pox \u2022, but\nthofe who have once had the chicken-pox are not capable of having it again, though\nto fuch as have never had this diftemper it feems as infectious as the fmall-pox.\nDr. Heberden wetted a thread in the moft concofted pus-like liquor of the chicken-\npox which he could find \u2022, and, after making a flight incifion, it was confined upon\nthe arm of one who had formerly had it; the little wound healed up immediately,\nand fhewed no figns of any infection. From the great fimilitude between the two\ndiftempers, it is probable, that, inftead of the fmall-pox, fome perfons have been\ninoculated from the chicken-pox ; and that the diftemper which has fucceeded has\nbeen miftaken for the fmall-pox by hafty or inexperienced obfervers.\nIt is a promifing fign, in the palfy, when the patient feels a flight degree of pain-\nful itchinefs in the affeCted parrs ; and, if a fever fhould arife, it bids fair to cure the\npalfy. When the fenfe of feeling remains, there is much more room to hope for a\ncure than where it is gone, as well as the power of motion. But when we obferve\nthe flefh to wafte, and the fkin to appear withered and dry, we may look upon the\ndifeafe to be incurable. Convulfions fupervening on a palfy are a fatal fign.\nWhen fainting happens in the beginning of any acute diftemper, it is not a good\nomen ; but, when it takes place in the increafe or at the height of the difeafe, the\ndanger is fomewhat lefs ; but in general, when fainting comes on without any evi-\ndent cauTe, it is to be dreaded. In violent haemorrhages it is favourable ; as the\nbleeding veffels gain time to -contract and recover themfelves, and thus the pa-\ntient may efcape . When perfons of a full habit faint through excefs of pafiion, they\nought to be bled without delay, and fhould drink vinegar or lemon-juice diluted\nwith water \u2022, and, after the bowels are emptied by a clyfter, take a paregoric\ndraught, and go to bed.\nPrognoftics from convulfions. Except in fome few cafes, convulfive diforders\nare always to be dreaded ; but lefs in young people than in fuch as are advanced in life.\nThofe which attack girls under the age of puberty will generally ceafe on the ap-\npearance of the menfes ; and boys have likewife a chance of being relieved as they\nadvance in life : but in grown-up people, unlefs the caufe be very evident, a cure is\nhardly to be expedted, efpecially after the difeafe has been of long continuance.\u2014The\ntreatment is much the fame with that of epilepfy.\nThe\n\f221\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nThe epilepfy frequently is preceded by a pain in the head, Jaffitude, fome diftur-\nbanceofthe fenfes, unquiet deep, unufual dread, dimnefs of fight, a noife in the\nears, palpitation of the heart, coldnefs of the joints, and in fome there is a fenfati-\non of formication, or a cold-air, &c. afc'ending from the lower extremities towards\nthe head. If the epilepfy comes on before the time of puberty, there are fome\nhopes of its going off at that time. But it is a bad fign when it attacks about the\n21ft year, and ftill worfe if the fits grow more frequent ; for then the animal-func-\ntions are often deftroyed, as well as thofe of the mind, and the patient becomes ftu-\npid and foolifh. Sometimes it will terminate in melancholy or madnefs, and fome-\ntimes in a mortal apoplexy or palfy. It has fometimes, however, been obferved,\nthat epilepfies have been removed by the appearance of cutaneous difeafes, as the\nitch, fmall pox, meafies, &c. therefore, if any of thefe appear, it may be reckoned\na favourable prognoftic.\nSigns of a diabetes.\u2014The diabetes firft fhows itfelf by a drinefs of the mouth and\nthird;, white frothy fpittle, and the urine in fomewhat larger quantity than ufual.\nA heat begins to be perceived in the bowels, which at firft is a little pungent, and\ngradually increafes. The third; continues to augment by degrees, and the patient\nby degrees lofes the power of retaining his urine for any length of time. The molt\nfingular phenomenon in this difeafe is, that the urine feems to be entirely or very\nmuch divefted of an animal nature, and to be largely impregnated with a faccharine\nfait fcarce diftinguilhable from that obtained from the fugar-cane. This difeovery\nwas firft made by Dr. Dobfon of Liverpool, who made fome experiments on the\nurine of a perfon labouring under a diabetes, who difeharged 28 pints of urine every\nday, taking during the fame time from 12 to 14 pounds only of folidand liquidfood.\nWhen a perfon perceives any of the before-mentioned fymptoms upon him, (parti-\ncularly the quantity and infipidity of the urine,) he fhould lofe no time in taking\nthe proper precautions, for the diabetes is rarely cured unlefs when taken at the\nvery beginning, which is feldom done. Briftol water is reckoned a fpecific in this\ndiforder.\nHydrophobia. This difeafe commonly does not make its attack till a confidera-\nble time after the bite. In fome few inftances it has commenced in leven or eight\ndays from the accident ; but generally the patient continues in health tor 20, 30, or\n'40, days, or even much longer. The bite, if not prevented, will in general be hea-\nled long before that time, frequently with the greateft eafe ; though fometimes it\nrefills all kinds of healing applications, and forms a running ulcer which difeharges\na quantity of matter for many days. It has been faid, that the nearer the wounded\nplace is to the falivary glands, the fooner the fymptoms of hydrophobia appear.\nThe approach of the difeafe is known by the cicatrix of the wound becoming high.\nNo. 15. 3L hard.\n\f222 i A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nhard, and elevated, and by a peculiar fenfe of prickling at the part *, pains fhoot\nfrom it towards the throat : fometimes it is furrounded with livid or red ftreaks, and\nfeems to be in a ftate of inflammation ; though frequently there is nothing remarka-\nble to be obferved about it. The patient becomes melancholy, loves folitude, and\nhas ficknefs at ftomach. Sometimes the peculiar fymptom of the difeafe, the dread\nof water, comes on all at once. We have an inftance of one who, having taken a\nvomit of ipecacuanha for the ficknefs he felt at his ftomach, was feized with the hy-\ndrophobia in the time he was drinking the warm water. Sometimes the difeafe be-\ngins like a common fore throat ; and, the forenefs daily increafing, the hydrophobic\nfymptoms fhow themfelves like a convulfivefpafm of the mufcles of the fauces. In\nothers, the mind feems to be primarily affeded, and they have a real dread of water\nor any liquid before they try whether they can fwallow it or not. Dr. James, in his\nTreatife on Canine Madnefs, mentions a boy fent out to fill two bottles with water,\nwho was fo terrified by the noife ofthe liquid running into them, that he fled into the\nhoufe crying out that he was bewitched. He mentions alfo the cafe of a farmer,\nwho, going to draw fome ale from a calk, was terrified to fuch a degree at its run-\nning into the veflel, that he ran out in great hafte with the fpigot in his hand.\nBut, in whatever manner this fymptom comes on, it is certain that the moft painful\nfenfations accompany every attempt to fwallow liquids. Nay, the bare fight of wa-\nter, of a looking-glafs, of any thing clear or pellucid, will give the utmoft uneafi-\nnefs, or even throw the patient into convulfions. With regard to the affedion of\nthe mind itfelf in this difeafe, it does not appear that the patients are deprived of rea-\nfon. Some have, merely by the dint of refolution, conquered the dread of water,\nthough they never could conquer theconvulfivemotions which the contad of liquids\noccafioned : yet even this refolution has been of no avail ; for the convulfions and\nother fymptoms, increafing, have almoft always deftroyed the unhappy patients.\nHowever, in this diftemper, the fymptoms are fo various, that they cannot be enu-\nmerated for we feldom read two cafes of hydrophobia which do not differ very\nremarkably in this refped. When a perfon is bitten, the prognofis with regard to\nthe enfuing hydrophobia is very uncertain. All thofe who are bit do not fall into\nthe difeafe ;\nnay, Dr.Vaughan relates that out of thirty bitten by a mad dog, only one\nwas feized with the hydrophobia. During the interval betwixt the bite and the time\nthe difeafe comes on, there areno fymptoms by which we can certainly judge whether\nit will appear or not.\nPrognoftics of a dropfy of the breaft. This affedion, particularly with refped\nto itscaufes, is in many circumftances fimilar to other kinds of dropfy, particularly\ntoafcites. But from the fituation of the water which is here depofited in the cavity\nof\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 223\nof the thorax, it may naturally be fuppofed that fome peculiar fymptoms will occur.\nBefides the common fymptoms of dropfy, (palenefs of the countenance, fcarcity of\nurine, and the like,) thisdifeafe is, in fome inftances, attended with a fluctuation\nof water within the bread \u2022, which when it does occur may be confidered as a certain\ndiftinguiffiing mark of this affeCtion. But, befides this, it is alfo diftinguifhed by\nthe remarkable affections of circulation and refpiration with which it is attended.\nThe breathing is peculiarly difficult, efpecially in a recumbent pofture; and in\nmany inftances patients cannot breathe with tolerable eafe, unlefs when fitting ereCt,\nor even {looping fomewhat forwards. The pulfe is very irregular, and has often\nremarkable intermiffions. But the difeafe has been thought to be principally cha-\nracterized by a fudden darting from deep, in confequence of an almoft inexpreffible\nuneafy fenfation referred to the bread, and attended with ftrong palpitation, which\nmay probably arife from an affeCtion either of circulation or of refpiration. That\nthefe fymptoms are common attendants of this difeafe is undeniable ; and they are\ncertainly the beft charaCteriftics of this affeCtion with which we are yet acquainted :\nbut it mud be allowed that they are prefent in fome cafes where there is no water in\nthe bread j\nand that in other inftances where the difeafe exifts, they are either alto-\ngether wanting, or occur only to a very flight degree. Certain diagnoftics, there-\nfore,. of this difeafe dill remain to be difcovered. When hydrothorax is prefent,,\nfrom the affeCtion of the vital functions with which it is attended, it may readily be\nconcluded that it is a dangerous difeafe, and in many inftances it proves fatal. The\ncure, as far as it can be accomplifhed, is obtained very much on the fame principles\nas in other dropfies. Benefit is often obtained from an artificial difcharge of water\nby the application of blifters to the bread : but in this, as well as other dropfies, a\ndifcharge is chiefly effected by the natural outlets, particularly from the ufe of ca*\nthartics and diuretics. In this fpecies of dropfy, more perhaps than in any other, ,\nrecourfe has been had to the ufe of the digitalis purpurea, or fox-glove, fo ftrongly\nrecommended as a diuretic by Dr. Withering in his Treatife refpeCting the ufe of it.\nThere can be no doubt that this, though fometimes productive of inconvenience,\nfrom the diftreffing ficknefs and fevere vomiting which it not frequently excites,\nthough ufed even but in fmall dofes, often operates as a powerful diuretic, and\nproduces a complete evacuation of water, after other remedies have failed. From\nthe effeCts mentioned above, however, as well as from its influence cn the pulfe,\nwhich it renders much flower, it is neceffary that it ffiould be employed with great\ncaution and in fmall dofes. A drachm of the dried leaves of the digitalis, macerated 1\nfor four hours in half a pint of warm water, forms an infufion which may be given\nin dofes of an ounce, and the dried powder of the leaves in dofes of one or two grains : .\nthefe dofes may be gradually increafed, and repeated twice or oftener in the day \u2022, ,\nbut\n;\n\f224 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nbut this requires to be done with great caution, left fevere vomiting, or other dif-\ntreffing fymptoms, fhould take place.\nScurvy. The firft indication of the fcorbutic diathefis is generally a change of\ncolour in the face, from the natural and healthy look to a pale and bloated complex-\nion, with a liftlefihefs, and averfion from every fort of exerciie ; the gums foon af-\nter become itchy, lwell, and are apt to bleed on the flighted: touch ; the breath grows\noften five ; and the gums, dwelling daily more and more, turn livid, and at length\nbecome extremely fungous and putrid, as being continually in contad with the ex-\nternal air ; which in every cafe favours the putrefaction of jubilances difpofed to\nrun into that date, and is indeed abfolutely requifite for the produ&ion of aflual rot-\ntennefs. The fymptoms of the fcurvy, like thole of every other difeafe, are fome-\nwhat different in different fubje&s, according to the various circumftances of con-\nflritution ;\nand they do not always proceed in the fame regular courfe in every patient.\nBut what is very remarkable in this difeafe, notwithflanding the various and immenfe\nload of diftrefs under which the patients labour, there is noficknefs at theftomach,\nthe appetite keeps up, and the fenfes remain entire almofl to the very laft : when\nlying at reft, they make no complaints, and feel little diftrefs or pain ; but the mo-\nment they attempt to rife or ftir themfelves, then the breathing becomes difficult,\nwith a kind of ftraitnefs or catching, and great oppreffion, and fometimes they have\nbeen known to fall into a fyncope. This catching of the breath upon motion, with\nthe lofs of ftrength, deje&ion of fpirit, and rotten gums, are held as theeflential or\ndiftinguifhing fymptoms of the d ifeafe.\nThe jaundice firft fhews itfelf by a liftleflnefs and want of appetite, the patient\nbecomes dull, opprefted, and generally coftive. Thefe fymptoms have continued\nbut a very fhort time, when a yellow colour begins to diffufe itfelf over the tunica\nalbuginea, or white part of the eye, and the nails of the fingers ; the urine becomes\nhigh coloured, with a yellowifh fediment capable of giving a yellow tint to linen;\nthe flools are whitifh or grey. In fome there is a moil violent pain in the epigaftric\nregion, which is confiderably increafed after meals. In fome toe difeafe degenerates\ninto an incurable dropfy ; and there have been many inltances of people who\nhave died of the dropfy after the jaundice itfelf had been totally removed. The com-\ning on of a gentle diarrhoea, attended with bilious flools, together with the ceflation\nof pain, are figns of the difeafe being cured. We are not, however, always to con-\nclude, becaufe the difeafe is not attended with acute pain, that it is therefore incura-\nble \u2022, for frequently the paflage of a concretion through tne biliary dudls is accompa-\nnied only with a fenlation of flight uneafinefs. If the d feafe goes off, its return\nmud be prevented by a courfe of tonic medicines, particularly the Peruvian bark\nand antifeptics: but we can by no means be certain that thejaundice. will not return,\nand\ni\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 225'\nand that at any interval ; for there may be a number of concretions in the gall-\nbladder, and, though one hath palled, another may very quickly follow, and pro-\nduce a new fit of jaundice ; and thus fome people have continued to be affedted\nwith the didemper, at Ihort intervals, during life.\nStone in the bladder. The figns of a ftone in the bladder are, pain, efpecially\nabout the fphindter ; and bloody urine, in confequence of riding or being jolted in\na carriage ; a fenfe of weight in the perinaeum ; an itchinefs of the glans penis j flimy\nfediment in the urine \u2022, and frequent doppages in making water > a tenefmus alfo\ncomes on while the urine isdifcharged.\nImaginary vifion of objedts which do not exid. This often takes place when the\nbody is difeafed, and then the patient is faid to be delirious. Sometimes however,\nin thefe cafes, it does not amount to delirium ; but the perfon imagines he fees\ngnats or other infedts flying before his eyes ; or fometimes, that every thing he looks\nat has black fpots in it, which lad is a very dangerous fign. Sometimes alfo fparks\nof fire appear before the eyes ; which appearances are not to be difregarded, as they\nfrequently precede apoplexy or epilepfy : on the other hand, it is feared that little\nbenefit can be derived from an attention to this prognodic, as the fits commonly\nfollow fo fuddenly.\nI fhall now proceed to defcribe two diforders not noted by Culpeper, or any old\nwriter. And firft of the\nANGINA PECTORIS.\nDr. Heberden was the fird who defcribed this difeafe, though it is extremely dan-\ngerous, and, by his account, not very rare. It feizes thofe who are fubjeft to it\nwhen they are walking, and particularly when they walk foon after eating, with a\nmolt difagreeable and painful fenfation in the bread, which feems to threaten imme-\ndiate deftrudtion : but, the moment they ftand dill, all the uneafinefs vanifhes. In\nall other refpedts the patients at the beginning of this diforder are well, and have no\nfliortnefs of breath ; from which the angina pectoris is totally different. After it\nhas continued fome months, the fits will not ceafe indantaneoufly on danding\ndill ;\nand it will come on not only when the patients are walking, but when they are\nlying down, and oblige them to rife up out of their beds every night for many\nmonths together. In one or two very inveterate cafes, it has been brought on by the\nmotion of a horfe or carriage, and even by fwallowing, coughing, going to dool,\nfpeaking, or by any didurbance of mind. The perfons affedted were all men,\nalmofi all of whom were above 50 years of age, and mod of them with a fhort neck\nNo. 15. 3 M and\n\f226 AKEYTOPHYSI C,\nand inclining to 8e fat. Something like it, however, was obferved in one woman*\nwho was paralytic; and one or two young men complained of it in a flight degree.\nOther practitioners have obferved it in very young perfons. When a fit of this fort\ncomes on by walking, its duration is very (hort, as it goes off almoft immediately\nupon (topping. If it comes on in the night, it will laft an hour or two. Dr.\nHeberden met with one in whom it once continued for feveral days ; during all which\ntime the patient feemed to be in imminent danger of death. Molt; of thofe attacked\nwith the diftemper died fuddenly : though this rule was not without exceptions\n;\nand Dr. Heberden obferved one who funk under a lingering illnefs of a different\nnature. The os fterni is ufually pointed to as the feat of this malady ; but it feems\nas if it was under the lower part of that bone, and at other times under the middle\nor upper part, but always inclining more to the left fide-, and in many cafes there is\njoined with it a pain about the middle of the left arm, which appears to be feated in\nthe biceps mufcle.\nThe appearance of Dr. Heberden\u2019s paper in the Medical TranfaCtions very foon\nraifed the attention of the faculty, and produced other obfervations from phyficians\nof eminence ;\nnamely, Dr. Fothergill, Dr. Wall of Worcefter, Dr. Haygarth of\nChefter, and Dr. Percival of Manchefter. It alfo induced an unknown fufferer to\nwrite Dr. Heberden a very fenfible letter, defcribing his feelings in the mod natural\nmanner; which, unfortunately, in three weeks after the date of this anonymous\nepiftle, terminated in a fudden death, as the writer himfelf had apprehended. The\nyoungefl: fubjeCt that Dr. Fothergill ever faw afflicted with this diforder was about\n30 years of age ; and this perfon was cured. The method that fucceeded with him\nwas a courfe of pills, compofed of the mafs of gum-pill, foap, and native cinnabar,\nwith a light chalybeate bitter : this was continued for fome months, after which he\nwent to Bath feveral fuccefllve feafons, and acquired his ufual health : he was or-\ndered to be very fparing in his diet ; to keep the bowels open ; and to ufe moderate\nexercife on horleback, but not to take long or fatiguing walks. The only fymp-\ntom in this patient that is mentioned, was a ftrifture about the cheft, which came\non if he was walking up hill or a little fafter than ordinary, or if he was riding a\nvery briflk trot ; for moderate exercife of any kind did not affeCt him : and this un-\neafy fenfation always obliged him to (top, as he felt himfelf threatened with imme-\ndiate death if he had continued to go forwards. It is the (harp conftriCtive pain\nacrofs the cheft, that (according to Dr. Fothergill\u2019s obfervation) particularly marks\nthis Angular difeafe ; and which is apt to fupervene upon a certain degree of mufcu-\nlar motion, or whatever agitates the nervous fyftem. In fuch cafes as fell under the\ninfpeCtion of Dr. Fothergill, he very feldom met with one that was not attended with\nan irregular and intermitting pulfe-, and this, not only during the exacerbations,\n1 but\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 227\nbut often when the patient was free from pain and at reft : but Dr. Heberden ob-\nferves, that the pulfe is, at leaft fometimes, not difturbed \u2022, and mentions his having\nonce had an opportunity of being convinced of this circumftance, by feeling the\npulfe during the paroxyfm. But no doubt thefe varieties, as well as many other\nlittle circumftances, will occur in this difeafe as they do in every other, on account\nof the diverfity of the human frame ;\nand, if thofe which in general are found to pre-\ndominate and give the diftinguifhing character be prefent, they will always authorife\n11s in giving the name to the difeafe : thus, when we find the conftridtory pain acrofs\nthe chdf, accompanied with a fenfe of ftrangling or fuffocation ; and ftill more, if\nthis pain fhould flrike acrofs the bread: into one or both arms, we fhould not hefitate\nto pronounce the cafe an angina peftoris.\nAs to the nature of this difeafe, it appears to be purely fpafmodic : and this opi-\nnion will readily prefent itfelf to any one who confiders the fudden manner of its\ncoming on and going off \u2022> the long intervals ofperfedt eafe \u2022, the relief afforded by\nwine and fpirituous cordials ; the influence which palfionate affections of the mind\nhave over it ; the eafe which comes from varying thepofture of the head and fhoul-\nders, or from remaining quite motionlefs ; the number of years for which it will con-\ntinue, without otherwife difordering health ; its bearing fo well the motion of a horfe\nor carriage, which circumftance often diftinguifhes fpafmodic pains from thofe\nwhich arife from ulcers ;\nandlaftly, its coming on for the moft part after afullmeaL\nand in certain patients at night, juft after thefirft fleep, at which time the incubus,\nconvulfive afthma, and other ills, juftly attributed to the difordered functions of\nthe nerves, are peculiarly apt to return or to be aggravated. From all thefe cir-\ncumftances taken together, there can belittle doubt that this affeCtion is of a fpafmodic\nnature : but, though this fhould be admitted, it may not be foealyto afcertain the\nparticular mufcles which are thus affeCfed. The violent fenfe of ftrangling or choak-\ning which fhows the circulation through the lungs to be interrupted during the\nheight of tire paroxyfm ; and the peculiar conftridtive pain under the fternum, al-\nways inclining (according to Dr. Heberden\u2019s obfervation) to the left fide ; together\nwith that moft diftreffing and alarming lenfation, which, if it were to increafe or con-\ntinue, threatens an immediate extinction of life ; might authorife us to conclude\nthat the heart itfelf is the mufcle affeCfed : the only objection to this idea (and, if it had\nbeen conftantly obferved, it would be infurmountable) is, that the pulfe is not always\ninterrupted during the paroxyfm. The appearances in two of. the difledtions favour\nthe opinion that the fpafm affeCts the heart ; as in one fubjeCt the left ventricle (and,\nthough it be not mentioned, we may prefume the right one alfo) was found as empty\nof blood as if it had been wafhed ; and in another, the fubftanceof the heart appear-\ned whitifh, not unlike a ligament; as it fhould feem, in both cafes, from the force\nof;\n\f228 A KEY TO PHYSIC,.\nof the fpafm fqueezing the blood out from the vefiels and cavities. If this hypothefis\nbe allowed, we miift conclude that the fpafm can only take place in an inferior de-\ngree, as long as the patient continues to furvive the paroxyfm ; fince an affection of\nthis fort, and in this part, of any confiderable duration or violence, mull inevitably\nprove fatal : and accordingly, as far as could be traced, the perfons who have been\nknown to labour under this difeafe have in general died fuddenly. The difle&ions\nalfo fhew, that whatever may be the true feat of the fpafm, it is not neceflary for the\nbringing of it on, that the heart, or its immediate appendages, fhould be in a mor-\nbid ftate ;\nfor, in three out of the fix that have as yet been made public, thefe parts\nwere found in a found ftate. On opening the body of the poor gentleman who wrote\nthe letter to Dr. Heberden, \u201c upon the mod careful examination, no manifeft caufe\nof his death could be difcovered \u2022, the heart, in particular, with its vefiels and valves,\nwere all found in a natural condition.\u201d In the cafe communicated by Dr. Percival\nto the publifhers of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, \u201c the heart and aorta\ndefcendens were found in a found ftate.\u201d And in Dr. Haygarth\u2019s patient, on opening\nthe thorax, the lungs, pericardium, and heart, appeared perfectly found. Not to\nmention Dr. Fothergill\u2019s patient (R.M.), in whofe body the only morbid appearance\nabout the heart was a fmall white fpot near the apex. So that the caufe, whatever\nits nature might have been, was at too great a diftance, or of too fubtile a nature, to\ncome under the infpedtion of the anatomift. But there was a circumftance in two\nof the fubjefls that is worthy of remembrance; and which fhows that the crafis of\nthe blood, while they were living, rnuft have been greatly injured, namely, its not\ncoagulating, but remaining of a cream-like confidence, without any feparation into\nferum and craftamentum.\nFrom all that we have feen hitherto publifhed, it does not appear that any confi-\nnerable advances have been made towards the actual cure of this anomalous fpafm.\nThe very judicious and attentive Dr. Heberden (to whom the public are highly in-\ndebted for firft making the diforder known) confeffes, that bleeding, vomits, and\nother evacuations, have not appeared to do any good : wine and cordials, taken at\nbed-time, will fometimes prevent or weaken the fits ; but nothing does this fo effec-\ntually as opiates : in fhort, the medicines ufually called nervous or cordial, fuch as\nrelieve and quiet convulfive motions, and invigorate the ianguifbing principle of\nlife, are what he recommends. Dr. Wall mentions one patient, out of the 12 or 13\nthat he had feen, who applied to him early in the difeafe, and was relieved confider-\nably by the ufe of antimonial medicines joined with the fetid gums : he was ftill liv-\ning at the time that the Dodlor wrote his paper (November 1772), and going about\nwith tolerable eafe. Two were carried off by other diforders ; all the reft died fud-\ndenly. Dr. Fothergilfs directions are chiefly calculated with the view to prevent the\ndiforder\n\fAND OCCUL T SCIENCE. 229\ndiforder from gaining ground, and to alleviate prefent diftrels. Accordingly he\nenjoins fuch a kind of diec as may be moft likely to prevent irritability : in particu-\nlar, not to eat voracioufly : to be ftridtly abftemious in refpecl to every thing\nheating \u2022, fpices, fpirits, wines, and all fermented liquors : to guard moll lcrupu-\nloufly againft paflion, or any vehement emotions ; and to make ufe of all the ufual\nmeans of eftablifliing and preferving general health : to mitigate exceflfes of irritabi-\nlity by anodynes \u2022, or pains, if they quicken the circulation : to difperfe flatulencies\nwhen they diftend the ftomach, by moderate dofes of carminatives ; amongft which,\nperhaps, Ample peppermint-water may be reckoned one of the fafeft. But, fince\nobefity is juftly confldered as a principal predifpofing caufe, he infills llrongly on\nthe neceflity of preventing an increafe of fat, by a vegetable diet, and ufing every\nother practicable method of augmenting the thinner fecretions. Thefe were the\nonly means which occurred to the Englilh phyficians of oppofing this formidable\ndifeafe.\u2014In my own practice I have never known the Solar Tincture to fail in remo-\nving by degrees this dangerous diforder. The cafes indeed that have occurred to\nme have been very few ; and my uniform practice has been to order a wine-glafs of\nthe Tincture, diluted with water, to be taken at going to bed; and, in thofe where\nthe diforder had gained great afcendency, I prefcribed a like quantity to be taken\nat getting up in the morning, at leaft an hour before breakfaft. This has always\nrendered the attacks lefs violent, and at laft totally removed them. Two table\nfpoonfuls of the Tindture undiluted Ihould be adminiftered, if poflible, during the\nhieght of the paroxyfm, which will generally give immediate eafe.\nDr. Smyth of Ireland has, we are told, difcovered that it may be certainly cured\nby iflues, of which Dr. Macbride gives the following inltance :\n\u201c A. B. a tall well-made man ; rather large than otherwife ; of healthy parents,\nexcept that there had been a little gout in the family ; temperate ; being very atten-\ntive to the bufinefs of his trade (that of a watch-maker), led a life uncommonly fe-\ndentary ;\nhad, from his boyhood upwards, been remarkably fubjedt to alarming\ninflammations of his throat, which feizedhim at leaft once in |the courfe of the year;\nin all other refpedts well. In 1767 (then 48 eight years of age), he was taken,\nwithout any evident caufe, with a fudden and very difpiriting throbbing under the\nfternum. It foon afterwards increafed, and returned upon him every third or fourth\nweek, accompanied with great anxiety, very laborious breathing, choaking, a fen-\nfation of fulnefs and diftenflon in the head, bloated and flulhed countenance, turgid\nand watery eyes, and a very irregular and unequal pulfe. The paroxyfm invaded him\nalmoft conftantly while he was fitting after dinner -, now and then he was feized with\nit in the morning, when walking a little fafter than ufual ; and was then obliged to\nreft on any objedt at hand. Once or twice it came on in bed ; but did not oblige\nNo. 15. 3\nhim\n\f23\u00b0 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nhim to fit up, as it was then attended with no great difficulty in breathing. In the af-\nternoon fits, his greatefteafe was from thefupine pofture-, in which he ufed to conti-\nnue motionlefs for fome hours, until, quite fpent and worn out with anguiffi, he\ndropt into a (lumber. In the intervals between thefe attacks, which at length grew\nfo frequent as to return every fourth or fifth day, he was, to appearance, in perfedb\nhealth. Thus matters continued for more than two years ; and various antifpafmodics\nwere ineffectually tried for his relief. In 1769, there fupervened a very (harp con-\nftridtory pain at the upper part of the fternum, (trenching equally oneach fide, atten-\nded with the former fymptoms of anxiety, dyfpncea, choaking, &c. and with an ex-\ncruciating cramp, as he called it, that could be covered with a crown-piece, in each\nof his arms, between the elbow and the wrift, exactly at the infertion of the pronator\nteres ; the reft of the limb was quite free. The fits were fometimes brought on, and\nalways exafperated,by any agitation of mind or body. He once attempted to ride on\nhorfeback during the paroxyfm ; but the experiment was near proving fatal to him.\nThe difference of feafon or weather made no impreffion upon him. Still, in the inter-\nvals, his health was perfectly good ; except that his eyes, which before his illnefs\nwere remarkably ftrong and clear, were now grown extremely tender \u2022, and that his\nfight was much impaired. He had no flatulency of ftomach, and his bowels were re-\ngular. In this fituation, February 22, 1770, heapplied to me for affiftance. I had feen,\nI believe, eight or ten of thefe frightful cafes before. Two of the patients dropt\ndead fuddenly. They were men between 40 and 50 years of age, andof a make fome-\nwhat fleffiy. The fate of the others I was not informed of ; or, atleaft, cannot now\nrecolleCt. Having found the total inefficacy of blifters and the whole clafs of nervous\nmedicines in the treatment of this anomalous fpafm, I thought it right to attempt the\ncorrecting or draining off of the irritating fluid in the cafe now before us. To\nthis purpofe, I ordered a mixture of lime-water with a little of the compound juni-\nper-water, and an alterative proportion of Huxham\u2019s antimonial wine: I put the\npatient on a plain, light, perfpirable, diet \u2022, and reftrained him from all vifcid, flatu-\nlent, and acrimonious, articles. By purfuing this courfe, he was foon apparently\nmended ; but, after he had perfifted regularly in it for at lead two months, he kept\nfor fome time at a ftand. I then ordered a large iffue to be opened on each of his\nthighs. Only one was made. However, as foon as it began to difcharge, he amend-\ned. The frequency and feverity of the fits abated considerably ;\nand he con-\ntinued improving gradually, until, at the end of 18 mbnths, he was reftored to per-\nfect health ; which he has enjoyed, without the lead interruption, till now, except\nwhen he has been tempted (perhaps once in a twelvemonth) to tranfgrefs rules, by\nmaking a large meal on faked meat, or indulging himfelf in ale or rum-punch, each\noi which never failed todiforder him from the beginning of his- illnefs : but even on\n: thefe\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 231\nthefe occafions, he has felt no more than the flighted: motion of his former fufferings \u2022\u00bb\ninfomuch that he would defpife the attack, if it did not appear to be of the fame\nflock with his old complaint. No other caufe has had the lead; ill effedl on him.\nThough rum was conftantly hurtful, yet punch, made with a maceration of black\ncurrants in our vulgar corn-fpirit, is a liquor that agrees remarkably well with him.\nHe never took any medicine after the ifiue began to difcharge ;\nand I have directed\nthat it fhall be kept open as long as he lives. The inflammations of his throat have\ndifappeared for five years paft ; he has recovered the ftrength and clearnels of his\nfight; and his health feems now to be entirely re-eftablifhed.\u201d\nDr. Mackbride, in a letter to Dr. Duncan, publifhed in the Edinburgh Medical\nCommentaries, gives the following additional obfervations on this difeafe :\n\u201c Within thefe few weeks I have, at the defire of Dr. Smyth, vifited, three or\nfour times, a very ingenious man who keqps on academy in this city, of about 34\nyears of age, who applied to the dodtor fof his advice in January laft. 1 fhall give\nyou his fymptoms as I had them from his own mouth, which appear to me to mark\nhis oafe to be an angina peftoris, and as deplorable as any that I have read of. It\nwas ftrongly diftinguifhed by the exquifite conftridtory pain of the fternum, extend-\ning to each of his arms as far as the infertion of the deltoid mufcle, extreme anxiety,\nlaborious breathing, ftrangling, and violent palpitation of the heart, with a molt\nirregular pulfe. The paroxyfms were fo frequent, that he fcarcely ever efcaped\na day, for fix or feven years, without one. They were ufually excited by any agi-\ntation of mind or body, though flight. He had clear intervals of health between\nthe fits. The diftemper feems hereditary in him, as he fays his father was affedted\nin the fame manner fome years previous to his death. He has a ftrong gouty taint,\nwhich never fhowed itfelf in his limbs ; and he has led a life of uncommon fedenta-\nrinefs, from intenfe application to mathematical ftudies, attention of mind, and\npaflion, even from his boyifh years. Thefe circumftances may, perhaps, account\nfor his having been taken with this difeafe at fo early an age as 17. A large ifiue\nwas immediately opened in each of his thighs. In a month afterwards he began to\nmendj and has gone on improving gradually. He can now run up flairs brifkly, as\nI faw him do no later than yeflerday, without hurt ; can bear agitation of mind ;\nand has no complaint, excepting a flight opprefiion of the breafl, under the iter-\nnum, which he feels fometimes in a morning, immediately after drefllng himfelf, and\nwhich he thinks is brought on by the motion ufed in putting on his c loaths ;\nthough\nfor a complete week preceding the day on which I faw him laft, he told me that he\nhad been entirely free from all uneafinefs, and was exulting that he had not had luch\nan interval ofeafe for thefe laft feven years. Doftor Smyth alfo fhowed me, in his ad-\nverfaria, the cafe of a gentleman who had been under his care in 1760, which he\nhad\n\frp A K E Y TO PHYSIC,\nhad forgotten when my book went to the prefs, which he was'reminded of the other\nday -by a viiit from his patient. It was a genuine angina pedtoris, brought on by a\nvery fedentary life, and great vexation of mind, clearly marked by the exquifite\npain under the fternum, that extended acutely to the upper extremities, particularly\nalong the left arm, together with the other fymptoms of dyfpncea, anxiety, palpi-\ntation of the heart, &c. recited in the cafe above. Thediforder went off in 1762, by\nlarge fpontaneous difcharges from the piles, but returned upon him feverely in\n1765. Ilfues in his thighs were then recommended to him, but not made. But,\nwhether it was by the perfuafion of fome friend, or of his own accord, he went into\na courfe of James\u2019s powder, in fmall alterative dofes, combined with a little caftor\nand afafoetida. This he perfifted in for about fix weeks \u2022, in the mean while, he had\nlarge acrimonious gleetings from the fcrotum, and a plentiful difcharge of ichor\nfrom the anus.\u2014From this time he began to find his complaints grow lefs and lefs\ndiftrefling, and he has now been totally free from them for fix years paft.\u201d\nDangerous Affection of the (ESOPHAGUS.\nThis diftemper has only been treated of by Dr. Muncldey, who reckons it one of\nthe moft deplorable difeafesof the human body. Its beginning is in general fo flight\nas to be fcarcely worth notice, the patients perceiving only a fmall impediment to the\nfwallowing of folid food : they ufually continue in this ftate for many months \u2022, du-\nring which, all liquid foods, and even folids themfelves when cut fmall and fwal-\nlowed leifurely, are got down without much difficnlty : by degrees the evil increafes,\nand the paffage through the oefophagus becomes fo narrow, that not the fmalleft\nfolid whatever can pafs through it ; but, after having been detained for fome time\nat the part where the obftacle is formed, is returned again with a hollow noife of a\nvery peculiar kind, and with the appearance of convulfion. The feat of this malady\nis fometimes near the top of the oefophagus, and at other times father down, nearer\nthe fuperior orifice of the ftomach. In this laft cafe, the part of the alimentary tube\nwhich is above the obftrudtion is frequently fo dilated by the food which is detained\nin it as to be capable of containing a large quantity \u2022, and the kind of vomiting, by\nwhich it is again returned through the mouth, comes on fooner or later after the at-\ntempt to fwallow, in proportion to the nearnefs or remotenefs of the part affedted.\nIn the laft ftage of this difeafe, not even liquids themfelves can be fwallowed fo as to\npafs into the ftomach, and the patient dies literally ftarved to death. On the dififec-\ntion of fuch as have died in this manner, the oefophagus is found to be confiderably\nthickened ; and in fome fo contradted within at the difeafed part, as fcarcely to\nadmit the palling of a common probe j in others, to adhere together in fuch a\n2 manner\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nmanneras entirely toclofeup the paffage, and notto be feparated without great diffi-\nculty. He comes next to ffiew what he has found to be the moft efficacious method\nof treating this difeafe, which, though not uncommon, yet in general has been con-\nfidered as incurable. He claims not the merit of having difcovered the method of\ncure, but hopes that fome fervice may arife from publiffiing what his experience has\nconfirmed to him \u2022, having firft received the hint from another eminent phyfician.\nThe only medicine, then, from theufeof which he has ever found any fervice, is mer-\ncury; and in cafes which are recent, and where the fymptoms have not rifen to any\ngreat height, fmalldofes of mercury given every night, and prevented, by purga-\ntive medicines, from affedting the mouth, have accompliffied the cure. But where\nthe complaint has been of long {landing, and the fymptom has come on of the food\u2019s\nbeing returned through the mouth, a more powerful method of treatment becomes\nneceflary. In this cafe he has never found any thing of the Jeaft avail in removing\nany of the fymptoms but mercury ufed in fuch a manner as to raife a gentle but\nconflant fpitting : and this method he has purfued with the happieft fuccefs. If\nthis method be commenced before the complaint has gained too much ground upon\nthe conftitution, the cafe is notto be defpaired of; and, of thofe who have corne un-\nder his care in this (late, by much the greater part have received confiderable benefit\nfrom it, and many have been entirely cured. The complaint itfelf, he obferves, is\nnot very uncommon ; but there is no inftance, to his knowledge, recorded, of fuc-\ncefs from any other manner of treating it than that he has recommended.\nOBSERVATIONS on the MEANS of PRESERVING HEALTH.\nI. Rules for the Management of Valetudinarians.\nThat part of the medical fyftem which lays down rules for theprefervation of health\nand prevention of dileafes, termed Hygeine, is not to be ftridlly underftood as if it\nrefpedted only thofe people who enjoy perfedt health, and who are under no appre-\nhenfions of difeafe, for fuch feldom either defire or attend to medical advice ; but\nffiould rather be confidered as relating to valetudinarians, or to fuch as, though not\nadtually Tick, may yet have fufficient reafon to fear that they will foon become fo :\nhence it is that the rules muft be applied to corredt morbific difpcfitions, and to ob-\nviate the various things that are known to be the remote or poffible caufes of dif-\neafes. From the way in which the feveral temperaments are ufually mentioned by\nfyftematic writers, it ffiould ieem as if they meant that every particular conftitution\nmuft be referred to one or other of the four; but this is far from being reducible to\npradlice, fince by much the greater number of people have conftitutions fo indif-\ntindlly marked, that it is hard to fay to which of the temperaments they belong.\nNo. 15. 3 O When\n\f234 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\n\\\\ hen we actually meet with particular perfons who have evidently either, i. Too\nmuch ftrengch and rigidity of fibre, and too much fenfibility; 2. Too little ftrength,\nand yet too much fenfibility; 3. Too much ftrength, and but little fenfibility? or,\n4. But little fenfibility joined to weaknefs ; we fhould look on fuch perfons as more\nor lefs in the valetudinary ftate, who require that thcfe morbific difpofitions be parti-\ncularly watched, left they fall into thofe difeafes which are allied to the different\ntemperaments.\nPeople of the firft-mentioned temperament being liable to fuffer from continued\nfevers, efpecially of the inflammatory fpecies, their fcheme of preferving health\nfhould confift in temperate living, with refpeft both to diet and exercife ; they\nfhould ftudioufly avoid immoderate drinking, and be remarkably cautious left any\nof the natural difcharges be checked. People of this habit bear evacuations well,\nefpecially bleeding: they ought not, however, to lofe blood but when they really\nrequire to have the quantity leffened \u2022, becaufetoo much of this evacuation would be\napt to reduce the conftitution to the fecond-mentioned temperament, wherein\nftrength is deficient, but fenfibility redundant.\nPerfons of the fecond temperament are remarkably prone to fuffer from painful\nand fpafmodic difeafes, and are eafily ruffled ; and thofe of the fofter fex who have\nthis delicacy of habit are very much difpofed to hyfterical complaints. The fcheme\nhere fhould be, to ftrengthen the folids by moderate exercife, cold bathing, the Pe-\nruvian-bark, and chalybeate-waters-, particular attention fhould conftantly be had\nto the ftate of the digeftive organs, to prevent them from being overloaded with any\nfpecies of faburra which might engender flatus, or irritate the fenfible membranes of\nthe ftomach and inteftines, from whence the diforder would foon be communicated\nto the whole nervous fyftem. Perfons of this conftitution fhould never take any of\nthe draftic purges, nor ftrong emetics ; neither fhould they lofe blood but in cafes\nof urgent neceflity. But a principal fhare of management, in thefeextremely-irritable\n'conftitutions, confifts in avoiding all fudden changes of every fort, efpecially thofe\nwith refpefl to diet and clothing, and in keeping the mind as much as pofflble in a\nftate of tranquillity : hence the great advantages which people of this frame derive\nfrom the ufe of medicinal waters drunk on thefpot, becaufe of that freedom from\ncare and ferious bufinefs of every kind which generally obtains in all the places\nlaid out for the reception of valetudinarians.\nThe third mentioned temperament, where there is an excefs of ftrength and but\nlittle fenfibility, does not feem remarkably prone to any diftreffing or dangerous\nfpecies of difeafe ; and therefore it can hardly be fuppofed that perfons fo circum-\nftanced\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 235\nftanced will either of themfelves think of any particular fcheme of management, or\nhaV6 recourfe to the faculty for their inftrubtions : fuch conftitutions, however, we\nmay oblerve, bear ail kinds of evacuations well, and fometimes require them to\nprevent an over-fulnefs, which might end in an oppreflion of the brain or fome othei\norgan of importance.\nBut the fourth temperament, where we have weaknefs joined to want of fenfibi-\nlity, is exceedingly apt to'fall into tedious and dangerous difeafes, arifing from a\ndefedt of abforbent power in the proper fets of veflfels, and from remiflhefs of the\ncirculation in general \u2022, whence corpulency, dropfy, jaundice, and different degrees\nof fcorbutic affedlion. In order to prevent thefe, or any other fpecies of accumula-\ntion and depravation of the animal fluids, the people of this conftitution fhould ufe\na generous courfe of diet, with brifk exercife, and be careful that none of the fecre-\ntions be interrupted, nor any of the natural difeharges fupprefied. Thefe conftitu-\ntions bear purging well, and often require it \u2022, as alfo the ufe of emetics, which are\nfrequently found neceflary to fupply the place of exercife, by agitating the abdo-\nminal vifeera, and are of fervice to prevent the flagnation of bile, or the accumula-\ntion of mucous humours, which hinder digeftion, and clog the fir ft paflages. The\nfree ufe of muftard, horfe-radifh, and the like fort of ftimulating dietetics, is fervice-\nable in thefe torpid habits.\nWhen the general mafs of fluids is accumulated beyond what is conducive to the\nperfedtion of health, there arifes what the writers term a plethora, which may prove\nthe fource of different difeafes-, and therefore, when this over-fulnefs begins to pro-\nduce languor and oppreflion, care fhould be taken in time to reduce the body to a\nproper ftandard, by abridging the food and increafing the natural difeharges, ufing\nmore exercife, and indulging lefs in fleep. But in oppofite circumftances, where the\nfluids have been exhaufted, we are to attempt the prevention of further wafte by\nthe ufe of ftrengthening ftomachics, a nourifhing diet, and indulgence from fa-\ntigue of body or mind. Vitiated fluids are to be confidered as affedted either\nwith the different kinds of general acrimony, or as betraying figns of fome of the\nfpecies of morbific matter which which give rife to particular difeafes, fuch as gout,\nrheumatifm, calculus, feurvy, &c.\nDuring the ftate of infancy, we may fometimes obferve a remarkable acidity,\nwhich not only fhows itlclf in the firft paflages, but alfo feems to contaminate the\ngeneral mafs of fluids. As it takes its rife, however, from weak bowels, our views\nwhen we mean to prevent the ill conlequences, mull be chiefly diredled to {Length-\nen the digeftive organs, as on their foundnefs the preparation of good chyle depends ;\nand hence fmall dofes of rhubarb and chalybe2 tes (either the natural chalybeate wa-\nters\n\f236 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nters mixed with milk, or the flores martiales in dofes of a few grains, according to\nthe age of the child) are to beadminiftered ;\nand the diet is tobc fo regulated as not\nto add to this acid tendehcy : brifk txercife islikewife to be enjoined, with fridtions\non theftomach, belly, and lower extremities.\nWhere the fluids tend to the putrefcent ftace, which fhows itfelf by fetid breath,\nfponginefs, and bleeding of the gums, a bloated look and livid caft, the diet then\nfhould be chiefly of frefh vegetables and ripe fruits, with wine in moderation, brilk\nexercife, and ftrengthening bitters.\nWhere acrimony fhows itfelf by itching eruptions, uncommon third, and fluk-\ning heats, nothing will anfwer better than fuch fulphureous waters as the Harrow-\ngate and Moffat in Britain, or the Lucan Swadlimbar in Ireland ; at the fame time\nufing a courfe of diet that fhal! be neither acrid nor heating.\nSo far with refpe<tt to thofe kinds of morbific matter which do not invariably pro-\nduce a particular fpecies of difeafe : but there are others of a fpecific nature, fome of\nwhich are generated in the body ipontaneoufly, and feem to arife from errors in diet,\nor other circumftances of ill management with refpedt to the animal economy ; and\nhence it is fometimes poffible, in fome degree if not altogether, to prevent the ill con-\nfequences. Thus, there are inftances where returns of the gout have been prevented\nby adhering ftri&ly to a milk-diet.\nThe rheumatifm has alfo been fometimes warded off by wearing a flannel fhirt, or\nby ufing the cold bath without interruption.\nCalculus may be retarded in itsprogrefs, and preventedfrom creating much diffrefs,\nby the internal ufe of foap and lime-water, by foap-lees taken in milk or in veal-\nbroth, or by the ufe of aerated alkaline water, which may perhaps be confidered as\nbeing both more fafe and more efficacious, and at the fame time more pleafant, than\nany of the other practices.\nThe feurvy may be prevented by warm clothing and perfeverance in brifk exercife,\nby drinking wine or cider, and eating freely of fuch vegetable fubftances as can be\nhad in thofe fituations where this difeafe is moft apt to ffiew itfelf.\nIn conftitutions where there is an hereditary difpofition to the fcrofula, if early\nprecautions be taken to ftrengthen the folids by cold bathing, a nouriffiing courfe\nof diet, and moderate ufe of wine, the acrimony which rile to the difeafe will proba-\nbly be prevented from producing any very bad effects.\nThe other kinds of morbific matter, which are of the fpecific nature, are received\ninto the body by infedlion or contagion.\nThe infection of a putrid fever or dyfentery is beft prevented by immediately\ntaking an emetic on the firft attack of the ficknefs or Ihivering ; and, if that do not\ncompletely anfwer, let a large blitter be applied between the Ihoulders : by this\n1 method\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 237\nmethod the nurfes and other attendants on the fick in the naval hofpitals have often\nbeen preferved. As to other infectious morbific matter, we muft refer to what has\nalready been faid when treating of hydrophobia, poifons, &c.\nThe ill effects which may arife from the different fpecies of faburra, are to be ob-\nviated, in general, by the prudent adminiftration of emetics, and carefully attain-\ning from fuch kinds of food as are known to caufe the accumulation of noxious\nmatters in the firft paffages.\nCrude vegetables, milk, butter, and other oily fubftances, are to be avoided by\nperfons troubled with a fournefs in the ftomach ; brifk exercife, efpecially riding,\nis to be ufed, and they are to refrain from fermented liquors : the common drink\nfhould be pure water ; or water with a very little of fome ardent fpirit, fuch as rum\nor brandy. Seltzer and Vahls water are to be drunk medicinally ; and aromatic bit-\nters, infufions, or tin&ures, with the acid elixir of vitriol, from 10 to 20 drops,\nwill be found ferviceable, in order to ftrengthen the fibres of the ftomach, and pro-\nmote the expulfion of its contents, thereby preventing the too hafty fermentation of\nthe alimentary mixture. In order to procure immediate relief, magnefia alba, or\ncreta and praeparata, will feldom fail ; the magnefia, as weft as the chalk, may be\nmade into lozenges, with a little fugar and mucilage \u2022, and in that form may be\ncarried about and taken occafionally by people afflidted with the acid faburra.\nIn conftitutions where there is an exuberance or ftagnation of bile, and a trouble-\nfome bitternefs in the mouth, it is necefiary to keep the bowels always free, by ta-\nking occafionally fmall dofes of pure aloes, oleum ricini, cream of tartar, fome of\nthe common purging falts, or the natural purging waters.\nWhen there is a tendency to the empyreumatic and rancid faburra, people ftiould\ncarefully avoid all the various kinds of thofe oily and high-feafoned things generally\ntermed made-difhes, and eat fparingly of plain meat, without rich fauces or much\ngravy ; and in thefe cafes the moft proper drink is pure water.\nII. Rul es for thofe who enjoy perfed Health.\nThere can be no doubt, that, in general, temperance is the true foundation of\nhealth \u2022, and yet the ancient phyficians, as we may fee in the rules laid down by\nCelfus, did not fcruple to recommend indulgence now and then, and allowed peo-\nple to exceed both in eating and drinking : but it is fafer to proceed to excefs in\ndrink than in meat \u2022, and, if the debauch ftiould create any extraordinary or diftreffmg\ndegree of pain or ficknefs, and a temporary fever fhould enfue, there are two ways of\nfhaking it off, either to lie in bed and encourage perfpiration, or to get on horfe-\nNo. 16. 3 P back\n\f23S A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nback and by brifk exercife reftore the body to its natural ftate. The choice of thefe\ntwo methods muft always be determined by the peculiar circumftances of the parties\nconcerned, and from the experience which they may before have had which agrees\nbelt with them.\nIf a perfon fhould commit excels in eating, efpecially of high-feafoned things,\n'with rich fauces, a draught of cold water, acidulated with vitriolic acid, will take\noff the fenfe of weight at the ftomach, and aflift digeftion, by moderating and keep-\ning within bounds the alimentary fermentation, and thus preventing the generation\nof too much flatus. The luxury of ices may be here of real fervice at the tables of\nthe great, as producing flmilar effedts with the cold water acidulated. Perfons in\nthefe circumftances ought not to lay themfelves down to fleep, but fhould keep up\nand exercife until they are fenfible that the ftomach is unloaded, and that they no\nlonger feel any opprefllve weight about the prascordia.\nIf a man be obliged to faft, he ought, if poflible, during that time, to avoid la-\nborious work : after fuffering fevere hunger, people ought not at once to gorge and\nfill themfelves \u2022, nor is it proper, after being over-filled, to enjoin an abfolute faft\n:\nneither is it fafe to reft totally immediately after exceflive labour, nor fuddenly fall\nhard to work after having been long without motion : in a word, all changes fhould\nbe made by gentle degrees for, though the conftitution of the human body be fuch\nthat it can bear many alterations and irregularities without much danger, yet, when\nthe tranfitions are extremely fudden, they cannot fail of producing fome kind or\ndegree of diforder.\nIt is alfo the advice of Celfus to vary the fcenes of life, and not confine ourfelves\nto any fettled rules : but as inadtion renders the body weak and liftlefs, and exercife\ngives vigour and ftrength, people fhould never long omit riding, walking, or go-\ning abroad in a carriage ; fencing, playing at tennis, dancing, or other fimilar en-\ngagements, which afford both exercife and amufement, as each fhall be found mod\nagreeable or convenient, are to be ufed in their turns, according to the circumftan-\nces and tendency to any particular fpecies of difeafe. But, when the weaknefs of old\nage fhall have rendered the body incapable of all thefe, then dry fridlions with the\nflefh-brufh will be extremely requifite to preferve health, by accelerating the flow\nof humours through the fmalleft orders of veffels, and preventing the fluids from\nftagnating too long in the cellular interftices of the flefhy parts.\nSleep is the great reftorer of ftrength *, for, during this time, the nutritious par-\nticles appear to be chiefly applied to repair the wafte, and replace thofe that have\nbeen abraded and wafhed off by the labour and exercife of the day. But too much\nindulgence in fleep has many inconveniencies, both with refpeft to body and mind,\nas it blunts the fenfes, and encourages the fluids to ftagnate in the cellular mem-\nbrane 5\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 239\nRrane; whence corpulency, and its neceffary confequences languor and weaknefe.\nThe proper time for fleep is the night feafon, when darknefs and filence naturally\nbring it on : therefore day-deep in general is not fo refrefhing ; and to fome people\nis really diftrefsful, as creating an unufual giddinefs and languor, efpecially in per-\nions addifted to literary purfuits. Cuftom, however, frequently renders deep in the\nday neceffary; and in thofe conftitmions where it is found to give real refrelhment it\nought to be indulged.\nWith regard to the general regimen of diet, it has always been held as a rule, that\nthefofterand milder kinds of aliment are mod proper for children and younger\nfubjedts; that grown perfons fhould eat what is more fubftantial; and old people\nleffen their quantity of folid food, and increafe that of their drink.\nOf FIXED AIR as a Medicine.\nTHE antifeptic qualities of fixed air, or as it is now more generally called of the-\naerial or carbonic acid, have of late introduced it as a medicine in cafes of putrid\ndiforders,. and various other complaints. \u2014Dr. Percival obferves, that, though fatal\nif infpired in a very large quantity, it may in fmaller quantities be breathed without\ndanger or uneafinefs. And it is a confirmation of this conclufion, that at Bath,,\nwhere the waters copioufly exhale this mineral fpirit, the bathers infpire it with im-\npunity. At Buxton alfo, where the bath is in a clofe vault, the effedts of fuch ef-\nfluvia,. if noxious, muft certainly be perceived.\nEncouraged by thefe and fome other confiderations, he has adminifiered fixed air\nin more than 30 cafes of the phthifis pulmonalis, by directing his patients to infpire\nthe fleams of an effervefcing mixture of chalk and vinegar through the fpout of a\ncoffee-pot. The hedtic fever has in feveral inftances been confiderably abated, and\nthe matter expedtorated has become lefs offenfive and better digefted. He has not,\nhowever, been fo fortunate in any one cafe as to effedt a cure ; although the ufe of\nmephitic air has been accompanied with proper internal medicines. But Dr. With-\nering has been more fuccefsful. One phthifical patient under his care, by a fimilar\ncourfe, entirely recovered. ; another was rendered much better and a third, whofc\ncafe was truly deplorable, feemed to be kept alive by it more than two months. It\nmay be proper to obferve, that fixed air can only be employed with any profpedl: of\nfuccefs in the latter ftages of the phthifis pulmonalis, when a purulent expedloration\ntakes place. After the rupture and difcharge of a vomica alfo, fuch a remedy pro-\nmifes to be a powerful palliative. Antifeptic fumigations and vapours have been\nlong employed, and much extolled, in cafes of. this kind. The following expert\n1 ment\n\fment was made to determine whether their efficacy in any degree depends on the re-\nparation of fixed air from their fubftance.\nOne end of the bent tube was fixed in a phial full of lime-water ; the other end\nin a bottle of the tindure of myrrh. The junctures were carefully luted ; and the\nphial containing the tindure of myrrh was placed in water, heated almoft to the\nboiling point, by the lamp of a tea-kettle. A number of air-bubbles were fepara-\nted, but probably not of the mephitic kind-, for no precipitation enfuedin the lime-\nwater. This experiment was repeated with the tinSi. TolutanaPh. Ed. and with fp.\nvinof. camph. and the refult was entirely the fame. The medicinal adion therefore\nof the vapours raifed from fuch tindures cannot be afcribed to the extrication of\nfixed air, of which it is probable bodies are deprived by chemical folution as well\nas by mixture.\nIf mephitic air be thus capable of correding purulent matter in the lungs, we may\nreafonably infer it will be equally ufeful when applied externally to foul ulcers-, and\nexperience confirms the conclufion. Even the fanies of a cancer, when the carrot-\npoultice failed, has been Sweetened by it, the pain mitigated, and a better digeftion\nproduced. But, though the progrefs of the cancer feems to be checked by the fixed\nair, it is to be feared that a cure will not be effeded. A palliative remedy, however,\nin a difeafe fo defperate and loathfome, may be confidered as a very valuable acqui-\nsition. Perhaps nitrous air might be ftill more efficacious. This Species of fadiri-\nous air is obtained from all the metals, except zinc, by means of the nitrous acid -,\nas a fweetner and antifeptic, it far furpaffes fixed air.\nIn the ulcerous fore throat, much advantage has been experienced from the va-\npours of efferveScing mixtures drawn into the fauces. But this remedy fhould not\nfuperSede the ufe of other antifeptic applications.\nIn malignant fevers, wines abounding with fixed air may be adminiftered to check\nthe Septic ferment, and Sweeten the putrid colluvies in the primrn vim. If the laxa-\ntive quality of Such liquors be thought an objedion to the ufe of them, wines of a\ngreater age may be given, impregnated with aerial acid.\u2014The patient\u2019s common\ndrink might alfo be medicated in the fame way. A putrid diarrhoea frequently oc-\ncurs in the latter ftage of fuch diforders -, and it is a molt alarming and dangerous\nSymptom. If the difcharge be flopped by aftringents, a putrid fomes is retained in\nthe body, which aggravates the delirium, and increafes the fever. On the contrary,\nif it be Suffered to take its courfe, the ftrength of the patient mufl Soon be exhaufted,\nand death unavoidably enfue. The injedion of mephitic air into the inteflines, un-\nder thefe -circumftances, bids fair to be highly Serviceable. And in Some cafes of\nthis kind, the gas emitted from a mixture of chalk and oil of vitriol, conveyed into\nthe body by the machine employed for tobacco-clyffers, quickly reflrained the\ndiarrhoea.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. i4i\ndiarrhoea, corrected the heat and fetor of the (tools, and in a fhort-timc removed\nevery fymptom ofdanger.\nAs a folvent of the calculus, its virtues have been already mentioned ; but the\nexperiments made on that fubjed do not determine the matter with fufficient accu-\nracy.\nOf MEDICAL ELECTRICITY.\nTHE application of this fubtile fluid to medicinal purpofes was thought of foon\nafter the difcovery of the eledric fhock \u2022, and, after various turns of reputation, its\nmedical virtues feem now to be pretty well eftablifhed. Mr. Cavallo, who has pub-\n1 iflaed the latefl: and the bed treatifeon Medical Eledricity, entirely difapproves of\ngiving violent (hocks, and finds it mod: efficacious to expofe the patient to the elec-\ntrical aura difcharged from an iron or a wooden point ; or, if (hocks are given, they\nfhould be very flight, and not exceed 12 or 14 at a time. In this way he recom-\nmends it as effedual in a great number ofdilorders. The patient may be eledrified\nfrom three to ten minutes : but, if fparks are drawn, they (hould not exceed the\nnumber of (hocks above mentioned.\nRheumatic diforders, even of long (landing, are relieved, and generally quite\ncured, by only drawing the eledric fluid with a wooden point from the part, or by\ndrawing fparks through flannel. The operation (hould be continued for about four\nor five minutes, repeating it once or twice every day.\nThe gout, extraordinary as it may appear, has certainly been cured by means of\neledricity, in various inftances. The pain has been generally mitigated, and fome-\ntimes the difeafe has been removed fo well as not to return again. In thole cafes,\nthe eled ric fluid has been thrown by means of a wooden point, although fometimes,\nwhen the pain was too great, a metal point only has been ufed.\nDeafnefs, except when it is occafioned by obliteration or other improper configu-\nration of the parts, is either entirely or partly cured by drawing the fparks from the\near with the glafs-tube diredor, or by drawing the fluid with a wooden point. Some-\ntimes it is not improper to fend exceedingly fmall (hocks (for inftance, of one-thir-\nteenth of an inch) from one ear to the other.\u2014It has been conftantly obferved, that,\nwhenever the ear is eledrified, the difcharge of the wax is confiderably promoted.\nThe toothach, occafioned by cold, rheumatifm, or inflammation, is generally\nrelieved by drawing the eledric fluid with a point, immediately from the parr, and\nalfo externally from the face. But, when the body of the tooth is affeded, eledriza-\ntion is of no ufe ; for it feldom or never relieves the diforder, and fometimes increa-\nfes the pain to a prodigious degree.\nNo. 16. 3 Q_ Inflammations\n\f242 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nInflammations of every fort are generally relieved by a very gentle electrization.\nIn inflammations of the eyes, the throwing of the electric fluid by means of a wood-\nen point is often attended with great benefit ; the pain being quickly abated, and\nthe inflammation being generally diffipated in a few days. In thefe cafes, the eye of\nthe patient muft be kept open ; and care fnould be taken not to bring the wooden\npoint very near it, for fear of caufing any fpark. Sometimes it is fufficient to throw\nthe fluid with a metal point \u2022, for in thefe cafes, too great irritation fhould be always\navoided. It is not neceflary to continue this operation for three or four minutes\nwithout intermiflion *, but, after throwing the fluid for about half a minute, a fhort\ntime may be allowed to the patient to reft and to wipe his tears, which generally flow\nvery copioufly : then the operation may be continued again for another half minute,\nand fo on for four or five times every day. The gutta ferena has been fometimes\ncured dy electrization ;\nbut at the fame time it muft be confefled, it has proved in-\neffectual in many fuch cafes, in which it was adminiftered for a long time and with\nall poffible attention. However, it has never been known that any body was made\nworfe by it. The beft method of adminiftering eleCtricity in fuch cafes, is firft to\ndraw the eleCtric fluid with a wooden point for a fhort time, and then to lend about\nhalf a dozen of fhocks of one- twentieth or an inch from the back and lower part of\nthe head to the forehead, very little above the eye. A remarkable difeafe of the eye\nwas fome time ago perfectly cured by electrization \u2022, it was an opacity of the vitreous\nhumour of the eyes. All the cafes of flftula lacrymalis, which Mr. Cavallo hath\nknown to have been electrified by perfons of ability for a fufficient time, have been\nentirely cured. The method generally praCtifed has been that of drawing the fluid\nwith a wooden point, and to take very final 1 fparks from the part. The operation\nmay be continued for about three or four minutes every day. It is remarkable, that\nin thofe cafes, after curing the fiftula lacrymalis, no other difeafe was occafionedby it,\nas blindnefs, inflammations, &c. by fuppreffing that difcharge.\nPalfies are feldom perfectly cured by means of eleCVricity, efpecially when they\nare of long Handing ; but they are generally relieved to a certain degree. The me-\nthod of electrifying in thofe cafes is to draw the fluid with the wooden point, and\nto bring fparks through flannel, or through the ufual coverings of the part if they\nare not too thick. The operation may be continued for about five minutes per day.\nUlcers, or open fores of every kind, even of a long Handing, are generally difpo-\nfed to heal by eleCtrizat'on. The general effeCts are a diminution of the inflamma-\ntion, and at firft a promotion of the difcharge of properly-formed matter ; which\ndifcharge gradually leflens, according as the limits of the fore contract, till it be\nquite cured. In thefe cafes the gentleft electrization muft be ufed, in order to avoid\ntoo great an irritation, which is generally hurtful. To draw or throw the fluid with\na wooden\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 243\na wooden or even with a metal point, for three or four minutes per day, is fully\niufficient.\nCutaneous eruptions have been fuccefsfully treated with electrization: but in\nthefe cafes it muft be obferved, that if the wooden point be kept too near the fkin,\nfo as to caufe any confiderable irritation, the eruption wili be caufed to fpread more;\nbut if the point be kept at about fix inches diftance, or farther, if the electrical\nmachine be very powerful, the eruptions will be gradually diminifhed, till they are\nquite cured. In this kind of difeafe, the immediate and general effeCt of the wooden\npoint is to occafion a warmth about the electrified part, which is always a fign that\nthe electrization is rightly adminiftered.\nThe application of eleCtricity has perfectly cured various cafes of St. Vitus\u2019s dance,\nor of that difeafe which is commonly called fo ; for it is the opinion of fome very\nlearned phyficians, that the real difeafe called St. Vitus\u2019s dance, which formerly was\nmore frequent than it is at prefent, is different from that which now gees under that\nname. In this difeafe, (hocks of about one-tenth of an inch may be fent through the\nbody in various directions, and alfo fparks may be taken. But, if this treatment\nprove very difagreeable to the patient, then the fhocks muft be leffened, and even\nomitted ;\ninfteadof which, fome other more gentle applications muft be fubftituted.\nScrophulous tumours, when they are juft beginning, are generally cured by draw-\ning the eleCtric fluid with a wooden or metal point from the part. This is one of\nthofe kinds of difeafes in which the aCtion of eleCtricity requires particularly the\naid of other medicines in order to effeCt a cure m, ore eafily \u2022, for fcrophulous af-\nfections commonly accompany a great laxity of the habit, and a general cachexy,\nwhich muft be obviated by proper remedies.\nIn cancers, the pains only are commonly alleviated by drawing the eleCtric fluid\nwith a wooden or metal point. Mr. Cavallo, however, mentions one cafe in which\na moft confirmed cancer of very long ftanding, on the breaft of a woman, had been\nmuch reduced in fize. It is remarkable, that this patient was fo far relieved by draw-\ning the fluid with a metal point from the part, that the excruciating pains (he had\nbuffered for many years did almoft entirely difappear \u2022, but, when the eleCtric fluid\nwas drawn by means of a wooden point, the pains rather inereafed.\nAbfceffes, when they are in their beginning, and in general whenever there is any\ntendency to form matter, are difperfed by electrization. Lately, in a cafe in which\nmatter was formed upon the hip, called thelumbar abfeefs, the difeafe was perfectly\ncured by means of cleCtricity. The fciatica has alfo been often cured by it. In all\nfuch cafes, the eleCtric fluid muft be fent through the part by means of two directors\napplied to oppefite parts, and in immediate contaCt either with the fkin, or with\nthe coverings, when thefe are very thin. It is very remarkable, that the mere\npafiage\n\f244 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\npaffage of eledric fluid in this manner is generally felt by the patients afllided with\nthofe diforders nearly as much as a fmall fhock is felt by a perfon in good health.\nSometimes a few fhocks have been alfo given, but itfeems more proper to omit\nthem \u2022, becaufe fometimes, inftead of difperfing, they rather accelerate the forma-\ntion of matter.\nIn cafes of pulmonary inflammation?, when they are in the beginning, eledriza-\ntion has been fometimes beneficial ; but in confirmed difeaies of the lungs it does\nnot feem to have ever afforded any unqueftionable benefit ; however, itfeems that\nin fuch cafes the power of eledricity has been but feldom tried.\nNervous headachs, even of a long {landing, are generally cured by electrization.\nFor this difeafe, the eledric fluid mud be thrown with a wooden and fometimes\neven with a metal point, all round the head fucceflively. Sometimes exceedingly\nfmall fhocks have been adminifte'red ; but thefe can feldom be ufed, becaufe the\nnerves of perfons fubjed to this difeafe are fo very irritable, that the {hocks, the\nfparks, and fometimes even the throwing the eledric fluid with a wooden point kept\nvery near the head, throw them into convulfions.\nThe application of eledricity has often been found beneficial in the dropfy when\njuft beginning, or rather in the tendency to a dropfy ; but it has never been of any\nufe in advanced dropfies. In fuch cafes, the eledric fluid is lent through the part,\nin various diredions, by means of two directors, and fparks are alfo drawn acrofs\nthe flannel or the clothes ;\nkeeping the metal rod in contad with them, and fhifting\nit continually from place to place. This operation fhould be continued at leaft ten\nminutes, and fhould be repeated once or twice a-day.\u2014-Perhaps in thofe cafes, a\nAmple electrization (viz. to infulate the patient, and to conned him with the prime\ncondudor whilft the machine is an adion), continued for a confiderable time, as\nan hour or two, would be more beneficial.\nSwellings in general, which do not contain any matter, are frequently cured by\ndrawing the eledric fluid with a wooden point. The operation fhould be continued\nfor three or four minutes every day.\u2014It is very remarkable, that, in fome cafes of\nwhite fwellings quite cured by means of eledricity, the bones and cartilages were\nin fome meafure disfigured.\nAgues have not unfrequently been cured by eledricity, fo that fometimes one elec-\ntrization or two have been fufficient. The moft effedual and fure method has been\nthat of drawing fparks through flannel, or the clothes, for about ten minutes or a\nquarter of an hour. The patients may be eledrified either at the time of the fit or\na fhort while before the time in which it is expeded.\nThe fuppreflion of the menfes, which is a difeafe of the female fex that often oc-\ncafions the moft difagreeable and alarming fymptoms, is often fuccefsfully and fpee-\ni dily\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 245\ndily cured by means of eleCtricity, even when the difeafe is of long {landing, and\nafter the moft powerful medicines ufed for it have proved ineffectual. The cafes\nof this fort in which electrization has proved ufelefs are fo few, and the fuccefsful\nones fo numerous, that the application of eleCtricity for this difeafe may be juftly\nconfidered as an efficacious and certain remedy. Great attention and knowledge is\nrequired, in order to diftinguifh the arreft of the menfes from a ftate of pregnancy.\nIn the former, the applicaton of eleCtricity, as we obferved above, is very benefi-\ncial ; whereas, in the latter, it may be attended with very difagreeable effeCts : it is\ntherefore a matter of great importance to afcertain the real caufe ot the dileale, be-\nfore the eleCtricity be applied in thofe t.afes. Pregnant women may be electrified\nfor other difeafes, but always ufing very gentle means, and directing the eleCtric\nfluid through other parts of the body diftant from thofe fubiervient to generation.\nIn the real fuppreffion of the menfes, final! {hocks, i. e. of about one-twentieth of\nan inch, may be fent through the pelvis-, fparks may be taken through the clothes\nfrom the parts adjacent to the feat of the difeafe ; and alfo the eleCtric fluid may be\ntransmitted by applying the metallic or wooden extremities of two directors to the\nhips, in contaCt with the clothes ;\npart of which may be removed in cafe they be too\nthick. Thofe various applications of eleCtricity fhould be regulated according to\nthe conftitution of the patient. The number of {hocks may be about 12 or 14. The\nother applications may be continued for two or three minutes ;\nrepeating the ope-\nration every day. But either ftrong {hocks, or a ftronger application of eleCtricity\nthan the patient can conveniently bear, fhould be avoided; for by thofe means fome-\ntimes more than a fufficient difcharge is occafioned, which is not eafily cured. In\ncafes of uterine haemorrhages, it is not known that the application of eleCtricity was\never beneficial. Perhaps a very gentle electrization, fo as to keep the patient infu-\nlated and connected with the prime conductor whilft the eleCtrical machine is in ac-\ntion, may be of fome benefit.\nIn refpeCt to unnatural difcharges and fluxes in general, it may be obferved, that\nfome difcharges are quite unnatural or adventitious, as the fiftula lacrymalis -nd\nfomefpecies of the venereal difeafe; but others are only increafed natural difcf rges,\nfuch as the menfes, perfpiration, &c. Now the power of eleCtricity in general has\nbeen found more beneficial for the firft than for the fecond fort of difcharges, which\nare moftly increafed by it.\nIn the venereal difeafe, electrization has been generally forbidden ;\nhaving com-\nmonly increafed the pains, and other fymptoms, rather than diminiffied them. In-\ndeed, confidering that any fort of ftimulus has been found hurtful to perfons affliCted\nwith that diforder, it is no wonder that eleCtricity has produced fome bad effeCts,\nefpecially in the manner it was adminiftered fome time ago, viz. by giving ftrong\nt\nNo. 16. 3 R ffiocks.\n\f246 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfhocks. However, it has been lately obferved, that a very gentle application of\nelectricity, as drawing the fluid by means of a wooden or metal point, is peculiarly\nbeneficial in various cafes of this kind, even when thedifeafe has been of long {lan-\nding. Having remarked above, that tumors, when juft beginning, are difperfed,\nand that unnatural difcharges are gradually fuppreffed, by a judicious electrization,\nit is fuperfluous to defcribe particularly thofe ftates of the venereal difeafe in which\neleClricity may be applied \u2022, it is only neceffary to remind the operator to avoid any\nconfiderable ftimulus in cafes of this fort.\nThe application of eleClricity has been found alfo beneficial in other difeafes be-\nfides thofe mentioned above ; but, as the faCts are not fufficiently numerous to\nafford the deduction of any general rules, we have not thought proper to take any\nparticular notice of them.\nWe may laftly obferve, that, in many cafes, the help of other remedies to be pre-\nfcribed by the medical praClitioner will be required to afiift the aCtion of eleClricity,\nwhich by itfelf would perhaps be ufelefs j\nand, on the other hand, electrization\nmay often be applied to afiift the aCtion of other remedies, as of fudorifics, ftrength-\nening medicines, &c.\nMr. Lichtenberg with a large eleCtrophorus made fome very curious experiments;\nin which, the knob of an electrified phial beingdrawn over the furface of the eleCtric\nplate, finely-powdered rofin afterwards fifted upon the place affumed the figure of\nftars and other beautiful ramifications, indicating not only an inclination to arrangi\nitfelf in the fame regular order with the cryftals of halts, but to run out into branches\nlike thofe of vegetables. Thefe experiments have been repeated to great advantage\nby the Reverend Mr. Bennet, according to whofe method the figures reprefented\nin the annexed Plate were made. The apparatus ufed for making them confifted\nonly of a common Leyden phial, and a plate of glafs 15 inches fquare covered on one\nfide with a varnifh of gum lac diffolved in fpirit of wine and feveral times laid over.\nTwo ounces of fhell-lac powdered and mixed with fix ounces of fpirit of wine anfwers\nvery well for this purpofe. The glafs mud be warmed, and the varnilh fpread upon\nit with a camel\u2019s- hair pencil. Care muft be taken, however, not to lay it on too\nthick, otherwife the effeCt will not follow.\u2014The other fide is covered with tin-foil\nlaid on with common pafte. When it is to be ufed, the glafs-plate is put upon a\nmetallic Hand with the tin-foil fide laid undermoft ; the phial is to be charged, and\nthe knob drawn over the varnilhed fide. Thus any kind of figure may be drawn, or\nletters made, as reprefented in the plate ; and from every figure beautiful ramifica-\ntions will proceed, longer or fhorter according to the ftrength of the charge. On\nfome occafions, however, the charge may be too ftrong, particularly where we wifh\nto\n\f[A\nui\/r,j\n\fT\nW'\n-\n,\n'\n'\n** \u2022\u2022\n\/\"\u2022Min ,\n,\nm\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 247\nto reprefent letters, fo that the whole will be blended into one confufed mafs. The\nround figures are formed by placing metallic rings or plates upon the eledr ical plate\n;\nand then giving them afpark from the eleftrified bottle, or fending a fhock through\nthem. The figures may be rendered permament by blowing off the loofe chalk,\nand dapping on a piece of black fized paper upon them y or, if they are wanted of\nanother colour, they may eafily be obtained by means of lake, vermilion, rofe-pink,\nor any of the ordinary colours ground very fine.\nElectricity feems alfo to be the caufe of cryftallization y which probably is only\nan incipient or imperfeft vegetation. Different faks affume different figures in cry-\nllallization, and are thus moft eafily diftinguifhed from one another. Each fait is\ncapable of affuming a very different appearance of the cryftalline kind, when only a\nAngle drop of the faline folutionis made ufeof, and thecryftallization viewed through\na microfcope. For our knowledge of this fpecies of cryftallization we are indebted,\nto Mr. Henry Baker, who was prefented with a gold medal for the difcovery, in the\nyear 1744. Thefe microfcopical cryftals he diftinguifhes from the large ones by the\nname of configurations y but this term feems inaccurate, and the diftinClion may\nwell enough be preferved by calling the large ones the common, and the fmall ones\nthe microfcopical, cryftals of the fait. His method of making thefe obfervations he\ngives in the following words t\n\u201c I diffolve the fubjeft to be examined in no larger a quantity of rain or river\nwater than I am. certain it is fufficient tofaturate. If it is a body eafily diffolvable,.\nI make ufe of cold water y otherwife I make the water warm, hot, or even boiling,\naccording as I find it neceffary. After it is perfectly difiolved, I let it reft for fome\nhours, till, if overcharged, the redundant faline particles may be precipitated and\nfettle to the bottom, or {hoot into cryftals ; by which means I am moft likely to have\na folution of the fame ftrength at onetime as at another y that is, a folution fully\ncharged with as much as it can hold up, and no more-, and by thefe precautions thecon-\nfigurations appear alike, howoften foever tried: whereas, if the water be lefs fatura-\nted, the proportions at different times will befubje&to more uncertainty; and, if exa-\nmined before fuch feparation and precipitation of the redundant falts, little more\nwill be feen than a confufed mafs of cryftals. The folution being thus prepared, l\ntake up a drop of it with a goofe-quill cut in fafliion of a fcoop, and place it on a\nflat flip of glals of about three quarters of an inch in width, and between three and\nfour inches long, fpreading it on the glafs with the quill, in either a round or an\noval figure, till it appears a quarter of an inch, or more, in diameter, and fo (hal-\nlow as to rife very little above the furface of the glafs. When it is fo difpofed, I hold\nit as level as I can over the clear part of a fire that is not too fierce, or over the flame\nof a candle, at a diftance proportionable to the heat it requires (which experience\nonly\n3\n\f24& A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nonly can dirett), and watch it very carefully till I difcover the faline particles begin-\nning to gather and look white, or of fome other colour, at the extremities of the\nedges. Then (having adjufted the microfcope before-hand for its reception, armed\nwith the fourth glafs, which is the fitted: for moft of thofe experiments) I place it\nunder my eye, and bring it exadtly to the focus of the magnifier \u2022, and, after running\nover the whole drop, I fix my attention on that fide where I obferve any increafe\nor puffing forwards of cryftalline matter from the circumference towards the centre.\nThis motion is extremely flow at the beginning unlefs the drop has been overheated,\nbut quickens as the water evaporates ; and, in many kinds, towards the conclufion,\nproduces configurations with a fwiftnefs inconceivable, compofed of an infinity of\nparts, which are adjusted to each other with an elegance, regularity, and order,\nbeyond what the exadteft pencil in the world, guided by the ruler and compaffes,\ncan ever equal, or moft luxuriant imagination fancy. When this adlion once begins,\nthe eye cannot be taken off, even for a moment, without lofing fomething worth\nobfervation : for the figures alter every inftant till the whole procefs is over ; and,\nin many forts, after all feems at an end, new forms arife, different entirely from any\nthat appeared before, and which probably are owing to fome fmall quantity of fait\nof another kind, which the other leparates from, and leaves to aft after itfelf has\ndone : and, in fome fubjefts, three or four different forts are obfervable, few or none\nof them being fimple and homogeneous. When the configurations are fully formed,\nand all the water evaporated, moft kinds of them are foon deftoryed again by the\nmoifture or adtion of the air upon them ; their points and angles lofe their\nfharpnefs, become uneven and defaced, and moulder, as it were, away. But\nfome few are permanent, and, being inclofed between giaffes, may be pre-\nferved many months, or even years, entertaining objedts for the microfcope.\nIt happens oftentimes that a drop of faline folution can hardly be fpread on the\nflip of glafs, by reafon of the glafs\u2019s fmoothnefs, but breaks into little globules, as\nit would do if the furface were greafy : this was very troublefome, till I found a\nway of preventing it, by rubbing the broken drop with my finger over the glafs, fo\nas to leave the furface fmeared with it; on which fmeared place, when dry, another\ndrop of the folution may be fpread very eafily in what form one pleales. It likewife\nfometimes happens, that, when a heated drop is placed properly enough for exami-\nnation, the obferver finds he can diftinguifh nothing : which is owing to faline\nfleams that, rifingfrom the drop, cover and obfeure the objedt-glafs, and therefore\nmuft immediately be wiped away with a foft cloth or leather. In all examinations\nby the microfcope of faline folutions, even though made in the day-time, I always\nemploy the light of a candle, and advife every obferver to do fo likewife ; for the\nconfigurations, being exceedingly tranfparent, are rendered much more diftinguifha-\nble\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE, 249\nble by the brown light a candle affords than by the more white and tranfparent\nday-light; and betides, either by moving the candle or turning microfcope, fuch\nlight may be varied or directed juft: as the objedt requires.\u201d\nIn this manner were produced the beautiful cryftallizations reprefented in the an-\nnexed Plate. They are vaftly different from fuch cryftals of the fame falts as are\nobtained by the common proceffes ; but Mr. Baker allures us they are no lefs con-\nftant and invariable than they, and that he has repeated the experiments a great num-\nber of times with the fame fuccefs.\nFig. 1.

Thefe fhoot from\nthe edges, with very little heat, into flattilh figures of various lengths, exceedingly\ntranfparent, and with ftraight and parallel fides. They are (hewn in their different\ndegrees of progrefiion at the letters a, \u00a3, c, d, e \u2022, where a reprefents how they firft\nbegin. After numbers of thefe are formed, they will often diffolve under the eye,\nand difappear entirely \u2022, but, if one waits a little, new fhoots will pulh out, and the\nprocefs go on afre'b. Thefe firft figures fometimes enlarge only with altering their\nfhapes, and fometimes form in fuch fort as the drop reprefents \\ but, if the heat has\nbeen too great, they Ihoot haftily into ramifications very numerous and beautiful,\nbut very difficult to be drawn ; and which Mr. Baker therefore did not attempt.\nThere feems ali the while a violent agitation in the fluid, and molt commonly, to-\nwards the conclufion, a few odtaedra (compofed of eight triangular planes, or two\nquadrangular pyramids, joined bafe to bafe) make their appearance.\n2. Blue vitriol produces cryftals round the edges, very ffiort at the beginning,\nbut increafing gradually, as reprefented at the figures 1,2, 3, which denote their dif-\nference of form, and the progrefs of their growth. Thefe cryftalline (hoots are folid\nregular, tranfparent, and reflect the light very beautifully from their poliffied fides\nand angles. As the watery part evaporates, numbers of long (lender bodies like\nhairs are feen here and there, fome lying fide by fide, or eroding each other as at 4;\nothers forming ftar-like figures with many radiations (5, 5). This fait (hoots but\n(lowly, and therefore requires patience. At laft the true cryftals begins to appear\ncommonly in the middle of the drop, and are very prettily branched, as at 6.\n3.

Thefe figures are a long time in growing; and, whilft they are doing fo, re-\ngular cryftals appear forming in feveral parts of the drop, of the molt lovely eme-\nrald colour, and reflecting the light from their ficles and angles, which are molt\nexactly difpofed, and finely polifhed. No cryftals are formed in the middle till the\nwater is nearly evaporated ; and then they begin to form haft ily, for which reafon\nthey muft be carefully attended. Their common figure refembles two long ffcrofT-\nirig each other in an angle of about 6o\u00b0, and fhooting branches every way j\neach of\nwhich again protrudes other branches from one, and fometimes from both, its\nfides ;\nmaking together an appearance like four leaves of fern conjoined by their\nftalks (5, 5). Separate clufters of the fame fharp-pointed figures, as thofe at the\nedges of the drop are alfo formed in the middle of it (6). Sometimes alfo they put\non another form, like the leaves of dandelion (7). Very beautiful figures are like-\nwile produced by a kind of combination of fharp points and branches ;\n8, 8). All\nthefe cryftals are of a mod beautiful green colour, but deeper or lighter according\nto the time of their production. The deepeft are conftantly produced firft, and the\npaler ones afterwards. Towards the end of the procefs fome circular figures are for-\nmed, extremely thin, and fo fiightly tinged, with green lines radiating from a cen-\ntre, as to be almoft colourlefs (9, 9). When all feems in a manner over, bundles\nof hair-like bodies appear frequently fcattered here and there throughout the drop,\nlike thofe of blue vitriol already deferibed.\n4. Alum. The microfcopical cryftals of this fait prove more or lefs perfect accor-\nding to the ftrength of the folution and the degree of heat employed in making the\nexperiment. The folution of alum, however faturated with the fait, will not be\nfound over-ftrong after Handing fome days : for in that time many cryftals will have\nformed in it. This reparation will often leave the remainder too weak for the pur-\npofe -,\nbut, -by holding the vial over or near the fire, the cryftals will again diffolve.\nAfter it has ftood about half an hour, it may then be ufed. The drop put on the\nglafs, and properly heated, exhibits commonly at firft a dark cloud which appears\nin motion fomewhere near the edge, and runs pretty fwiftly both to the right and\nleft until it is either flopped by the intervention of regular cryftals, or elfe it pro-\nceeds both ways at unce, till, having furrounded the whole drop, the two ends rufh\ntogether, and join into one {a. a). This cloudy part, which feems to be violently\nagitated while it is running round, appears on a ftridt examination to confift of\nfalts (hot into long and very (lender lines, much finer than the fmalleft hair, eroding\neach other at right angles. As they go along, rows of folid cryftals are produced\nfrom their internal edges. Thele are compofed of many oblique plain fides (\u00a3, bj,\nand which have all a tendency towards the figures of the regular cryftals to be def-\neribed\n\f\/\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE. * 5I\ncribed prefently. But it frequently happens, that, in fo\/ne parts of the drop, many\nminute and circular figures are feen rifing at fotne little diftances from the edge,\nwhich, enlarging the nfelves continually, appear at la It of a ftar-like form (f, c ).\nThe cryftals in the middle feldom appear tiil the fluid feems aimoft wholly evapo-\nrated ;\nwhen, on a fudden, many ftraight lines appear pufhing forwards, whole\nTides or edges are jagged, and from which other fimilar ftraight and jagged lines\nfhoot out at right angles with the firft. Thefe again have other Imail ones of the\nfame kind (hooting out likewife from themlelves, and compole altogether a moil;\nbeautiful and elegant configuration (D). Each of thefe lines, increafing in breadth\ntowards its end, appears as if it were fomewhat club -headed fe, e, e). Some-\ntimes, inftead of fending branches from their fides, many of thele lines rife parallel\nto each other, refernbling a kind of palifadoe, and having numberlefs minute tranf-\nverfe lines running between them (F). But the moft wonderful part of all, though\nnot producible without an exaCt degree of heat and right management, is the dark\nground-work (G). It confills of an infinity of parallel lines having others crofting\nthem at right angles, and producing a variety fcarce conceivable from lines difpofed\nin no other manner : the direction of the lines (which are exquifitely ftraight and\ndelicate) being fo frequently and differently changed, that one would think it the\nrefult of long ftudy and contrivance. During the time this ground-work is framing,\ncertain lucid points prefent themfelves to view moft commonly on one fide. Thefe\ngrow continually larger, with radiations from a centre, and become ftar-like figures\nas before mentioned. Some of them fend out long tails, which give them the ap-\npearance of comets : and at the end of all, a dark lineation in various directions\ndarts frequently through, and occupies all or moft of the fpaces between them, ma-\nking thereby no ill reprefentation, when viewed by candle-light, of a dark fky il-\nluminated with ftars and comets. The regular cryftals are often formed in the fame\ndrop with the others (\/).\n5. Borax. If a drop of folution of borax is held too long over the fire, it hardens\non the (lip of glafs in fuch a manner that no cryftals can appear.

Before the middle of\nthe drop begins to (hoot, feveral exceedingly minute bodies may be difcernable at the\nbottom of the fluid. Thefe in a little while rife to the top, and foon diftinguifh\ntheir fhape as at (5). Their growth is very qu ck, and for fome time pretty equal;\nbut at laft fame branch gets the better of the reft, and forms the figure (6). The\n-other branches enlarge but little after this, all the attraction feeming to be lodged\nin that one that firft began to lengthen ;\nand from this more branches being pro-\ntruded, and they again protruding others, the whole appears as at (8). It is not\nuncommon to fee in the middle of the drop fome cryftals, where, inftead of the\nftraight Items above deferibed, there is formed a kind of zig-zag, with fpiculte\nlike thole in the other figures (7).\n7. Salt of lead, or faccharum faturni. A little of this fait diflolved in hot water,\nwhich it immediately renders milky, after Handing a quarter of an hour to lubfide,\nis in a fit condition for an examination by the microfcope. A drop of it then applied\non a flipofglafs, and held over the fire to put the particles in aCtion, will be feen\nforming round the edge a pretty even and regular border of a clear and tranfparent\nfilm or glewy fubftance ( aaaa) ; which, if toofudden and violent a heat be given,\nruns over the whole area of the drop, and hardens fo on the glafs as not to be got off\nwithout great difficulty. But, if a moderate warmth be made ufe of, which likewife\nmull not be too long continued, this border proceeds only a little way into the drop,\nwith a kind of radiated figure compofed of fine lines, or rather bundles of lines, be-\nginning from the centres in the interior edge of the border, and fpreading out at\nnearly equal diflances from each other every way, towards the exterior .( bbbb ). From\nthe fame centres are produced afterward a radiation inwards, compofed of parallel-\nograms of different lengths and breadths ; from one and fometimes both the\nangles of thefe, are frequently feen ffiootings fo exceedingly {lender, that they are\nperhaps the beft pofiible reprefentations of a mathematical line. The extremities of\nthe parallelograms are generally caff: off at right angles; but they are fometimes alfo\nfeen oblique (cccc). Centres with the like radii ifluing from themn, and fome of the\nglutinous matter for theirroot, are fometimes formed in the drop, entirely detached\nfrom the edges ; and in thefe it is very frequent to find a kind of fecondary radii pro-\nceeding from fome of the primary ones ; and others from them again to a great\nnumber of gradations, forming thereby a very pretty figure (D).\n8. Salt of tin produces at the edges of the drop a number of oftaedra, partly\ntranfparent, Handing on long necks, at fmall diHances from each other, with an-\ngular fhoots between them (aa).

The figure (\/) is compofed of\ntwo high pyramids united at their bafe. Some in this kind of form are found trun-\ncated at one of their ends, and others at both. Several of the hexagonal bodies\nmay be obferved with floping fides, forming a fmooth, triangular, rifing plane,\nwhofe angles point to three intermediate fides of the hexagon (g).\n9. Epfom fait begins to {hoot from the edge in jagged figures (a). From other\nparts differently figured cryftals extend themfelves towards the middle, fome of\nwhich have fine lines proceeding from both fides of a main ftem, in an oblique di-\nrection \u2022, thofe on one fide {hooting upwards in an angle of about 6o\u00b0, and thofe on\nthe other downwards in the fame obliquity (c, f). Others produce jags from their\nfides nearly perpendicular to the main ftem, thereby forming figures that refemble\nfomefpecies ofthepolipody (e) 5 but in others the jags are Ihorter id). Now and\nthen one of the main items continues {hooting to a confiderable length, without any\nbranchings from the fides : but at laft fends out two branches from its extremity\n(\u00a3). Sometimes a figure is produced having many fine and minute lines radiating\nfrom a centre {b). The laft; lhootings in the middle of the drop (h) are not unlike\nthe frame-work for the flooring or roofing of a houfe, but with the angles oblique :\nand fometimes a form of another kind prefents itfelf (j).\n10. Scarborough fait begins to {hoot from the edges : firft of all in portions of\nquadrilateral figures, much refembling thofe of common fait ; but two of their an-\ngles inftead of 90, are about ioo\u00b0. They {hoot in great numbers round the borders\nof the drop, having their fides as nearly parallel to one another as the figure of the\ndrop will allow : fome proceed but a little way, others farther, before they renew\nthe {hoot {ad). In fome places they appear more pointed and longer ( b ) and fome-\ntimes, inftead of the diagonal, one of the fides is feen towards the edge, and the\nother {hooting into the middle (r). The middle cryftals {def) feem to be of the vi-\ntriolic kind.\n11. Glauber\u2019s fait produces ramifications from the fide of the drop, like the\ngrowth of minute plants, but extremely tranfparent and elegant (c). Some of them,\nhowever, begin to {hoot from a centre at fome diftance from the edge, and pro-\ntrude branches from that centre in a contrary direction (bj. Sometimes they fhoot\nfrom one and fometimes from more fides of the central point in different varieties\n(d). Other figures are produced from different parts of the edge of the drop (\na\nt ft\ne) \u2022,\nbut the moft remarkable and beautiful cryftallization forms laft of all near the mid-\ndle of the drop. It is compofed of a number of lines proceeding from one another\nNo. 17.

Salt of Jefuits bark. The few fhootings which this fait produces at the edge\nof the drop are of no regular figure (a). The whole area becomes quickly filled with\ngreat numbers of rhombi, of different fizes, extremely thin and tranfparent ( h).\nSome of thefe enlarge greatly and acquire a confiderable thicknefs, forming them-\nfelves into folids of many fides (cc). Near the conclufion fome cry flals of fea-falt\nare formed (dd), and likewife a few odd triangular figures e).\n13. Salt of liquorice begins fhooring from the edge with a fort of rhombic fpi-\nculas (a). Some four-branched figures like thofe of vitriol commonly appear, but\nmoulder away before their ramifications are completed, leaving only their ftamina\nbehind (bb). The middle of the drop is ufually overfpread with great numbers of\nparallelograms, fome exceedingly tranfparent, being mere planes; having fometimes\none, fometimes more, of the angles canted in fuch a manner as to produce penta-\ngonal, hexagonal, and other, figures. Others have much thicknefs, and form pa-\nrallelepipeds or prifms (c). Some of the plane figures now and then protrude an ir-\nregular kind of fbooting which appears very pretty (,d).\n14. Salt of wormwood. The firfl fhootings of this fait from the edges of the\ndrop appear of a confiderable thicknefs in proportion to their length : their fides are\ndeeply and fharply jagged or indented, being made up of many fomewhat obtufe\nangles, and their ends point with angles of the fame kind ( a ). But other fhoots fre-\nquently branch out from thefe original ones, and they again fend forth others, ma-\nking altogether a very pretty appearance (bb). The cryflals of this fait are very\ndifferent from each other, confiding of fquares, rhombi, parallelograms, &c. (c).\n15. Salt of tobacco. If a moderate degree of heat is given to a folution of this\nfait, its firft fhootings will be from the edges of the drop, in (lender tapering figures,\nending with very fharp points, but at confiderable diftances from one another.\nAlong with thefe are formed other cryflals, nearly of the fame kind, but entirely\ndetached, and farther within the drop, having the thicker ends towards the centre\nof the drop, and the fharp points turned towards its edge (a). When a little more\nheat has been given, other fpiculse are produced from the edge, whofe ends fpread\non either fide, and then terminate in a point and which have all along their fides tri-\nangular pointed cryflals, placed alternately fo as to reprefent a zig-zag, with a line\ndrawn through its middle (b). The regular cryflals are produced in the middle of\nthe drop, arud are either hexagons or rhombi (c).

A violent agitation may be difcovered in the fluid by the\nfirft magnifier during the whole procefs, but efpecially at the beginning, and ex-\ntremely minute cryftals rifing from the bottom.\n16. Salt of hart (horn. On the application of a very fmall degre of heat, fait of\nhartfhorn fhoots near the edges of the drop into folid figures fomewhat refembling\nrazors or lancets, where the blade turns into the handle by a clafp [d). The cryftals\nof this fait are produced with great velocity, and are fomewhat opaque, (hooting\nfrom the edges of the drop, on both fides a main Item, and with a kind of regulari-\nty, rugged branches like thofe of fome forts of coral (a a). But fometimes, inftead\nof thefe branches, (harp fpiculas, fome plain, and others jagged, are protruded to\na confiaerable depth on one fide only (b). As the fluid exhales, fome one of the\nbranching figures generally extends to a great length, producing on one fide (hoots\nthat are rugged and irregular, and on the other curious regular branches refembling\nthofe of fome plant (c).\n17. Salt of urine fhoots from the edges of the drop in long parallelograms like\nnitre {a a). But in other places, along the fides of the drop folid angles are formed,\nthat feem to be the rudiments of common fait (b). Some of the parallelograms in--\nerea(e much in fize, and fprejid themfelves in the middle, fo as to change their firft\nfigure, and become three or four times bigger than the reft : and thefe have a divi-\nding line that runs through their whole length from end to end, whence iffue other\nfhort lines at fmall diftances, oppofite to one another ; all pointing with the fame\ndegree of obliquity towards the bafe (c c '). A mong thefe enlarged figures, fome few\n(hoot (till forward and tapering towards a point, but, before they form one, fwell\nagain, and begin as it were anew \u2022, and thus they proceed feveral times before their\nfigure is quite finifhed {a a). The figures 1,2,3, 4> 5> 6, are the regular cryftals of\nthis fait when it is allowed to diflolvein the air, and no heat at all is given.\n18. Rheum, or the clear liquor which diftils from the noftrils when people catch\ncold, is ftrongly faturated with fait. A drop of it on a flip of glafs will (oon cry-\nftallize in a beautiful manner, either with or without heat ;\nbut if heated to about\nthe warmth of the blood, and then viewed through the microfcope, many lucid\npoints will be feen rifing and increafing gradually, till their form is (hewn to be\nquadrangular, with two tranfparent diagonals eroding each other (d d). Thefe di-\nagonals (hoot foon after far beyond the fquare, protruding other lines at right angles\nfrom their fides 5\nand thus they go on to form the moft elegant and beautiful cry-\nftals ( b b,\nc c ).

M. Mefmer, a phy-\nfician of the fame country, by adopting the principles of Hehl, became the direct\nfounder of the fyftem. He had already diftinguiShed himfelf by A- DiSfertation on\nthe Influence of the Stars upon the human Body, which he publicly defended in a\nthefis before the univerfity of Vienna. He afterwards made a tour through Ger-\nmany, publishing every where the great cures he performed by means of animal\nmagnetifm, and arrived at Paris in the beginning of the year 1778. Here he was\nfirft patronifed by the author of the Diftionnaire des Merveilles de la Nature \u2022, in\nwhich work a great number of his cures were published, Mefmer himfelf receiving\nlikewife an ample teftimony of his candour and Solid reafoning. Our phyfician Soon\ncollected fome patients ; and in the month of April 1778 retired to Crete ij, from\nwhence he in a Short time returned with them perfectly cured. His fuccefs was now\ngreat, and patients increafed fo rapidly, that the dcdtor was foon obliged to take\nin pupils to afilft him in his operations. Thefe pupils Succeeded equally well as\nMeS'mer himfelf; and fo great was their emolument, that one of them, named M.\nDeflon, realized upwards of ioo,oool. Sterling. In 1779 Mefmer published a me-\n1 moir\n\f\f1\n.\n*\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 2 57\nmoir on the fubjedt of Animal Magnetifm, promifing afterwards a complete work\nupon the fame, which fhould make as great a revolution in philofophy as it had\nalready done in medicine.\nThe new fyftem gained ground daily \u2022, and foon became fo falhionable, that the\njealoufy of the faculty was thoroughly awakened, and an application concerning it\nwas made to government. In confequence of this a committee was appointed to\ninquire into the matter, confifting partly of phyficians and partly of members of the\nroyal academy of fciences, with Dr. Benjamin Franklin at their head. Mefmer\nhimfelf refufedto have any communication with the committee ; but his moll cele-\nbrated pupil Deflon was lefs fcrupulous, and explained the principles of his art in\nthe following manner :\ni. Animal magnetifm is an univerfal fluid, conftituting an abfolute plenum in\nnature, and the medium of all mutual influence between the celeltial bodies and\nbetwixt the earth and animal bodies.\u20142. It is the moft fubtile fluid in nature ; ca-\npable of a flux and reflux, and of receiving, propagating, and continuing, all kinds\nof motion.\u2014 -3. The animal body is fubjedled to the influences of this fluid by means\nof the nerves, which are immediately affedted by it.\n\u20144. The human body has poles\nand other properties analogous to the magnet.\u20145. The adtion and virtue of animal\nmagnetifm may be communicated from one body to another, whether animate or\ninanimate.\u2014 -6. It operates at a great diftance without the intervention of any body.\n\u20147. It is increafed and refledted by mirrors; communicated, propagated, and in-\ncreafed, by found; and may be accumulated, concentrated, and tranfported.\u20148.\nNotwithftanding the univerfality of this fluid, all animal bodies are not equally af-\nfedted by it ; on the other hand, there are fome, though but few in number, the pre-\nfence of which deftroys all the effedts of animal magnetifm.\u20149. By means of this\nfluid nervous diforders are cured immediately, and others mediately ;\nand its virtues\nin Ihort extend to the univerfal cure and prefervation of mankind.\nFrom this theory, M. Deflon engaged, 1. To prove to the commiflioners, that\nfuch a thing as animal magnetifm exilted; 2. To prove the utility of it in the cure\nof difeafes ; and to communicate to them all that he knew upon the fubjedt. The\ncommiflioners accordingly attended in the room where the patients underwent the\nmagnetical operations. The apparatus confided of a circular platform made of oak,\nand raifed about a foot and an half from the ground. At the top of it were a num-\nber of holes, in which were iron rods with moveable joints for the purpofe of apply-\ning them to any part of the body. The patients were placed in a circle round, each\ntouching an iron rod, which he could apply to any part of the body at pleafure ;\nthey werejoined to one another by a cord palling round their bodies, the defign be-\ning to increafe the effedt by communication. In the corner of the room was a piano\nNo. 17. 3 U forte.\n\f258 A K E Y T O PHYSIC,\nforte, on which fome airs were played, occafionaily accompanied with a fbng.\nEach of the patients held in his hand an iron rod tenor twelve feet long \u2022, the inten-\ntion of which was to concentrate the magnetifm in its point, and thus to render its\neffedts more fenfible. Sound is another condudtor of this magnetifm ; and, in or-\nder to communicate the magnetifm to the piano forte, nothing more is neceffary than\nto bring the iron rod near it. Some magnetifm is alfo furnifhed by the perfon who\nplays it *, and this magnetifm is tranfmitted to the patients by the founds. The in-\nternal part of the platform was lb contrived as to concentrate the magnetifm, and\nwas the refervoir whence the virtue diffufed itfelf among the patients.\nBefides the different ways of receiving the magnetifm already mentioned, viz. by\nthe iron, cord, and piano forte, the patients alfo had it diredtly from the dodtor\u2019s\nfinger, and a rod which he held in his hand, and which he carried about the face,\nhead, or fuch parts of the patient as were difeafed-, obferving always the direction\nof the poles. His principal application of magnetifm, however, was by preffure of\nthe hands or fingers on the hypochondria or lower regions of the ftomach.\nThe effedts of thefe operations upon Deflon\u2019s patients were very amazing. Some\nfpit, coughed, fweat, and felt extraordinary heats in different parts of the body.\nMany had convulfions, which is what is called their crifis, &c.~-The commiffio-\nners after this determined to try the experiments themfelves. For the fluid was\ntotally imperceptible by any of the fenfes, and they could only afcertain its exiftence\nby ultimately curing difeafes, or by its obfervable effedts upon the human body.\nThe pradtice having been fince purfued in England with great fuccefs by the in-\ngenious Dr. Bell, I fhall give theprocefs and effedts of this difcovery in his own\nwords.\n\u201c There is an univerfal fluid which fills all fpace. Everybody is endowed with a\ncertain quantity of eledtric fluid. There exifts an attradlion, or fympathy and anti-\npathy, between animated bodies. The univerfal currents of the univerfal fluid, are\nthe caufe and exiftence of bodies. One may accelerate thofe currents in a body, and\nproduce crifes and fomnabulifm, which is done by adting reciprocally upon one\nanother, by increafing the currents going acrofs their interftices or pores, in confe-\nquence of the abfolute will of the operator. As there exifts a general and reciprocal\ngravitation of all celeftial bodies towards each other, fo there exifts a particular and\nreciprocal gravitation of the conftitutive parts of the earth towards the whole, and\nof that whole towards each of its parts.\n\u201c The reciprocal adtion of all thefe bodies is operated upon by tlieinfenflble perf-\npiration, or vapor, flowing in and out, as you fee in a real loadftone or in an ar-\ntificial magnet, forming an outfide atmofphere ; it alfo produces currents in a more\nor lefs direct manner, according to the analogy of bodies.

It is of courfe by that means eafily underftood, that two beings have\nover each other the greateft influence poffible, when they are fo placed that their\nanalogous parts aCt on one another in the moft harmonical manner. It is neceffary\nthat the perfon who fubmits to be treated is willing, as well as that the operator\u2019s\nmind muff be abfolute, and think of nothing but of the different fenfations he then\nfeels. Credite & volete.\n\u201c Therefore, in order that two perfons may a<5t on each other in the ftrongefl\nmanner poffible, they muff be placed oppofite each other ; from North to South\nis the beft; you turn your patient\u2019s face towards the South ; you may treat in other\ndirections, according to your idea and circumftances. In that oppofite pofition your\natmofpheres are joining ;\nand you may be confidered as forming but one whole,\naCting in an harmonic manner. When man fuffers, all the aCtion of life is directed\ntowards him in order to deftroy thecaufe of fuffering; likewife, when two perfons\nare aCting on each other, the whole aCtion of that union aCts on the difordered parts\nwith a force proportioned to the increafe of the mafs. It may therefore be in general\nafferted, that the aCtion of Animal EleCtricity and Magnetifm, &c. increafes in\nproportion to the maffes.\n\u201c It is poffible to direCt the aCtion of Animal EleCtricity and Magnetifm more\nparticularly on any individual part,, by fixing your idea and directing the fluid up-\non the part affeCted. Our arms may be confidered as conductors to the animal fluid,\nand ferve to attradt or repel according to our will,, and eftablifh a kind of continui-\nty between bodies. It follows, from what has been faid on the moft advantageous\npofition of two beings aCting on each other in order to maintain the harmony of the\nwhole, one ought to touch the right part with the left arm, and the right foot in\ncontaCt with the left. In that pofition you are in affinity with your patient, your\ntwo atmofpheres are joined ; it ffiews the oppofition of poles in the human body,,\nand is nearly the fame as thofe which may be obferved in the loadftone, or artificial\nmagnet.\n\u201c Paracelfus, as well as many other anatomifts, have admitted poles in man. Mr.\nGeorge Adams, in his Treatife on Magnetifm, juftly fays,\n4\nIn fome future period\nit may be difcovered that moft bodies are poffeffed of a polarity, as well as one direc-\n\fA KEY TO PHYSIC,\n260\nr ion relative to the various affinity of the elements of which they are compounded.\u2019\nThe better to conceive the poles of the human body, we ought to confider man di-\nvided into two parts, by a line drawn from the top to the pubis ; all the joints of\nthe left part may be confidered as poles oppofite to thofe correfponding therewith ^\nthe fluid paffes out more fenfibly, and in a greater abundance, from the extremities,\nas thofe extremities are confidered as poles oppofite to the right, and are the belt con-\nductors of the animal fluid.\n\u201c You may give polarity to animate and inanimate bodies ; that is to fay, to in-\ncreafean action to a degree which they had not before, only by a fridfion very near-\nly refembling that which you give to a piece of fteel before it becomes a magnet,\nexcept that it will not be fo palpable. You may alfo change the poles in the human\nbody pretty nearly the fame as you change thofe of a magnet. You may alfo ftrength-\nen or increafe the adtion of Animal Eledtriciry and Magnetifm by animate and inani-\nmate bodies, as you may increafe the adtion of an artificial magnet by adding more\nmagnets, provided the poles are contrary : therefore every thing is filled in the uni-\nverfe by means of an univerfal fluid in which all bodies are immerfed, and confe-\nqfiently all beings touch one another in confequence of the continual cirgulation by\nwhich the currents of the magnetic fluid flow out and pafs in j in confequence of\nthis you may affedf a perfon at a difiance, provided he is of a weak habit of body,\nand has been in acrifis before you put the column of air into vibration which exifte\nbetween the perfon you treat and yourfelf j\nthat will affedf him, as is feen or felt by\nthe force of founds at a concert. ,\n\u201c In order to be in affinity or harmony with your patient, you mufi touch him by\nthe hand ; as there is a circulation which forms itfelf between you and him, and\ntends to an equilibrium, it is generally by that mean eafier to take your patients out\nof their crifes. You next hold up both your hands parallel to the head, and bring\nthem gently down as far as the pubis \u2022, you may follow the diredtion of the nerves *,\nthen fix your hands upon the diaphragm or ftomach, where lies the greateft abun-\ndance of nerves ; you may put your thumbs upon the plexus, and put the nerves in\nmotion ; you may alfo fix one hand upon the ftomach, and draw the other tov\/ards\nyou, by that mean you attradl or repel at pleafure.---There are various ways of ma-\nnipulation which the operator makes ufe of, according to circumftances. If you\nwiffi to procure fleep foon, change your pofition get either to the right fide of your\npatient gt left ; in that pofition you fix one of your hands before the head, and the\nOther behind j keep them there v\/ith all your might, till you feel fome heat in the\npalm of the hand \u2022, if the perfon is not inclined to fleep, you mufi charge the head in\ndifferent diredfions, by ihutting your hands as if you were boxing--then you open\ntheta quick, and this you repeat often \u2022, tb 1\n\u201crfon feels then a drowfinefs.\u2014You\ni mufi\n\fmnimae Magnetism \\ys\/n O\/wi#for\/rfo\/\/ ry \/\/,> l\/a\/fo\/fo \/\/\/fo'r^\/^\/.r.\n\f)\nI\n\\\n\/\ni\n\/\nI\nV\nJ\n\u2022\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 261\nmuft keep your hands in oppofition as before ; by this mean the animal fluid gets\ninto the abforbent veflels\u2014ads alfo upon the nerves, which ftimulates the body and\nproduces a crifis. If you fee the patient too much agitated, get oppofite to him,\nand bring both your hands downwards from head to foot, or as if you were to fan a\nperfon, and, getting backwards, it will compofe him.\u2014Then you feek for the caufe\nand place of the illnefs ; or you hold the perfon\u2019s hand, and you afk him where he\nfeels pain, as it is increafed by treating : if he does not anfwer your queftions proper-\nly, it is afign he is not in a perfed ftate of fomnabulifm ; you muft keep him afleep\nlonger without fpeaking to him\u2014you then feek for the feat of the difeafe, by exten-\nding your hand at a little diftance from his body, beginning from head to foot 5 if\nyour fenfations are good, you may feel, with a little attention within yourfelf, pains\nin the fame part as where the perfon is affeded\u2014or you may feel at the end of your\nfingers a heat, if it is an inflammation or obftrudion \u2022, if you feel a coldnefs, it is in\nthe lymphatic veflels ;\nif biiious, you feel a numbnefs, and many other ways which\ndifferent conftitutions feel ; \u2014either of thefe circumftances will inform you where\nthe difeafe lies\u2014but by touching, which is the fureft way, you foon become certain\nof the feat and caufe of the difeafe, which fometimes lies in the oppofite fide to the\npain, particularly in nervous affedions, &c. You may touch, if you like, the caufe\nof the difeafe, or charge it as you do the head, by that means you keep up the fymp-\ntomatical pain, till you have rendered it critical\u2014 you fecond the effort of nature\nagainft the caufe of the difeafe, and ad like a ftimulus, which will produce a faluta-\nry crifis, by putting the whole frame in adion, which will remove any difeafe pro-\nceeding from obftrudions, &c. after the patient finds himfelf compofed, and the\ncaufe of the diforder diminiihed. When the patient is afleep, you afk him if it is\ntime to take him out of it \u2022, if he anfwers yes, draw your hands towards his head\ndown to the feet, and rub the eyes with your thumbs feveral times, and wave your\nhand as if you were to fan a perfon who is too hot\u2014you get by degrees backwards\ntill he is recovered.\n\u201c The caufe of mofc part of difeafes is an irritability or fever debility, or obftruc-\ntions \u2022, by the flownefs or abolition of motion, it is an obftrudion or debility, and by\nits acceleration produces an irritability, inflammation, and fever.\n\u201c The feat of thofe difeafes is generally in the vifcera, as the inteftines, the fpleen,\nthe liver, the epiploon, mefentery, the loins, &c. in women, the ftomach, the\nwomb, &c. Thefe aberrations or obftrudions are an impediment in the circula-\ntion of one part, which prefles on the blood or lymphatic veflels, and on the nerves,\nwhich produce thofe fpafms, on account that the fluid circulates flowly ; for that\nreafon thofe perfons are the fooneft affeded, and put into a crifis, when they are la-\nbouring under thofe maladies ; if thofe veflels prefs upon the root of a nerve, the\nNo. 17. 3 X motion\n\f$62 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nmotion and fenfibility of the correfponding parts are quite fupprefied, as in an apo-\nplexy, palfy, &c. There is not a better conductor for the animal fluid than the\nnerves, as they are fpread all over the body ; they abound more particularly in the\ndiaphragm, ftomatical and ombelical plexus, where lies the root of the nerves which\nextend their branches (as a tree does its branches and roots in the earth) all over\nthe body.\n\u201c Many philofophers have thought it is in them that the foul lies, it is through\nthem that the fomnabules fee in the dark when their eyes are fhut,\u2014When you treat\na perfon, you mud follow as much as polTible the direction of the nerves ; you may\ntreat at a fmall diftance, and fix your hand upon the part affebted, and by motion\nyou put the column of air (which exids between you and your patient) into vibra-\ntion, which will caufe an irritation and produce a crifis.\n\u201c Many profeffors make ufe of conductors, either glafs, fteel, filver, or gold *\nabout eight inches long \u2022, they have a good effeCt in fome cafes : all this proceeds\nfrom the idea of the operator. Mr. Mefmer tells us, \u2018\nWhen you make ufe con-\nductors, you mult magnetite from right to right.\u2019 that is, the poles are changed.\u2014\nI have repeatedly produced the fame effebt by treating from left to left, except when\nI have put a perfon into a fleep without a conductor ; if while a deep I magnetifed\nthem from right to right, fome have gone into a crifis, others have awaked.' If you\ntouch the forehead with your right hand, you muft put your left inoppofition behind ;\nand in the fame manner to any other part of the body, becaufe there is a re-abtion of\nfluid from one pole to the other, like a magnet, as Dr. Mefmer reprefents the hu-\nman body as a magnet ; if you edablifli the North to the right, the left becomes\nthe South, and the middle like the Equator, which is without predominant aCtion.\nI repeat it ; it is mod advantageous to be oppofite the perfon you want to treat, in\norder to cure him effectually. Curing confifts in re-edabl idling the difturbed har-\nmony\u2014the general remedy is the application of animal duid, which ferves to re-ef-\ntablifh the equilibrium which is loft in fome part of the body. As there is but one\ndifeafe, there is but one remedy : if motion isdiminifhed, it ought to be increafed :\nif there is too great irritability, it ought to be decreafed : as it is on folid bodies that\nthis duid operates, particularly on our vifcera, in order to rebtify them, as they are\ndeflined by Nature to prepare, to diffolve, and affimilate our humors, they lhould\nbe brought to their equilibrium by any means whatever, either by employing inter-\nnal or external remedies $ but we ought to be very cautious how we adminifter\nthem, except fuch as the patients will order for themfelves or prefcribe for others,\nwhich are generally very dmple. There are few remedies taken internately which\nare good, becaufe, when received in the domach and the firft paffages, they expe-\nrience the fame elaboration as our aliments, the parts of which analogous to our hu-\nmours\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 263\nmours are aflimilated there by chylification, and tfie heterogeneous particles are ex-\npelled by the means of excretions. Thofe remedies which may be given will prove\nto have often the effebts contrary to the intentions of the prefcriber, becaufe moft of\nthem are very aqueous, ftimulate too much, and will increafe irritation, fpafms, &c.\nand produce effedts dilcordant to the harmony of the parts, which ought to be efta-\nblifhed and reftored to their proper equilibrium. If treating is not fufffcient to pro-\nduce vomiting in the cafe of a perfon who has too much putridity, or abundance of\nbilewhich has been too long Handing, then a gentle emetic is to be given, or mag-\nnefia, if there is too much acid ; if alkali is predominant, order a folution of\nfoluble tartar or other acid, which you think will agree with your patient. In cafe\nof a violent cholic and coftivenefs, or fore throat, injedtions are the beft. Thefe\nare the general remedies which ought to be adminiftered to the patients, as I\nam fare that all thofe preparations of minerals, &c. which we fee in an apothecary\u2019s\nfhop, were never intended by Nature for the human body. Modern phyficians have\nfrom an interefted view negledted the knowledge of the vegetable kingdom, more\nadapted by Providence for the human body. The diet of the patient is whatever\nNature points out to him ; it is her who didtates what every man ought to follow,\nbecaufe fhefeldom deceives us in our manner of living. It is not what we eat, nor\nthe quantity, which does good\u2014it is what we digeft. Animals by inftindt will ne-\nver touch any thing but what Nature hasdidlated to them. In this their inftindl is\nfar fuperior to our reafon. Spirituous liquors are forbidden, ftrong green tea with-\nout milk, coffee, hot aliments, and the ufe of fnuff, becaufe it irritates the pituita-\nry membranes in the throat, the ftomach, and the head, and will produce crifpation\nand irritation. The ufual drink may be water with a bit of toaft in it, wine and\nwater, or good rich wine, old fmall beer, good porter, lemonade, or different fy-\nrups\u2014all thefe may be ordered according to the cafe of the patient. The eating\nmay be good broth, either ofjpeef, mutton, or veal, chicken boiled, and roafted\nmeat. Avoid any fait or fat meat ; make ufe of any fallads, good ripe fruits, &c.\nGentle exercife in an open air, either riding or walking. Cold or waim baths are\nmod excellent ; the drinking of fome mineral waters is good in fabt, a good ob-\nferver (though not a phyfician) may cure more people than a man of the faculty\u2014\nbecaufe a dobtur never goes without an apothecary\u2014 they all go together hand in\nhand, and do more harm than good.\n\u201c If you have but one patient, and cannot move him out of bed, gather round\nhim as many healthy perfons as you can make them rub well their hands\u2014then\nmake them hold one another, and communicate to the patient : this is what I call\nto form a chain,\u2014 by that you communicate to him the animal fluid, which will vi-\nvify him if he is too much debilitated. You may fet him upon an infulated ffool,\nas.\n\f264 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nas when you eleftrify aperfon ; you may fet him upon a chair, and make a healthy\nperfon fit upon the fame chair back to back ; you may magnetife a tree in a garden ;\nyou may have one in your room, or a fmall refervoir :\u2014there are various ways,\nwhich depend upon the idea of the magnetifer.\n\u201c There are feveral ways of treating and curing; for that effeft much attention\nand prudence are required ; and an honeft man, willing to do good to his fellow-\ncreatures who labour under any infirmities, will never treat his patients in public,\nand make them walk in their fleep, or do many other things : it is very well to con-\nvince many incredulous people of the effefts, but cannot do good to the patient. I\nwill fay alio, that a perfon cannot treat more than two or three patients in a day to\ndo them juftice, and thofe who do treat more feldom cure by magnetifing alone;\nthe patients may fancy they have been cured,-\u2014but, if they had not been fo treated,\nthey might alfo have been well ; as their treatments are long, Nature operates, and\nis a better doftor. There are fome who will firmly aifure you they have cured peo-\nple at the difiance of two or three hundred miles off, without ever having feen the\npatient, and putting them into crifes.\u2014 I will anfwer them, they are either fools or\nmadmen ;\ntheir imagination being heated with this idea, they are like vifionaries. I\nknew an ingenious phyfician who faw every body with the yellow jaundice, and a-\nnother who thought that everybody had a virus in their blood, and all the patients\nwho applied to him he treated as having a gallicus morbus ; and another who preten-\nded to cure every body only by looking at them : all thefe are fome degrees of infa-\nncy. I knew feveral perfons who fuppoled I had been treating them after I had\nleft their houfes\u2014they fall afleep, fome twenty miles off, and they have related this\nas a faft to feveral of their friends, while I was amufing myfelf, and never thought\nof them ; and nevertheiefs, fuppofe I had been treating them, and they might by\nchance fall afleep, I could not with with propriety relate the ftory as a fa ft, becaufe\nit muft be repeated often to hold good. I never reft^ny judgment upon a fingle ex-\nperiment; in experimental philofophy fafts are ftubborn, and no one can contradict\nthem when repeated. Now I fhall explain the manner of treating and curing effec-\ntually, on reafonable principles, each complaint particularly.\n\u201c Suppofe you have one patient who has a head-ach, you feat him in a chair, the\nback towards the North, or otherwife; you fit oppofite to him ; you put yourfelf\nin affinity with him, as I have obferved before; you draw the general current, fol-\nlowing the direftion of the nerves ;\nyou hold your hands the fame as if you were to\nhold a pen ; you feek for the caufe of the pain, which may lie in different parts\u2014\nperhaps the patient will tell you, if you cannot find it out. If it is a hemicrania,\nwhich is owing to the foulnefs of the ftomach, you fix your eyes upon your left\nhand, which you direft towards the ftomach with your right hand\u2014you do the fame\ni as\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 265\nas if you was to turn a pancake ; this you repeat feveral times, by that mean you ftir\nthe atmofphere and relax the ftomach, and may make him vomit; you may give\na little warm v\/ater to promote your operation; you may alfo treat the head by\ndrawing the fluid downwards, if the pain has been of long (landing ; you may or-\nder a vomit or a gentle purge, and treat them every day, and after order bitters to\nftrengthen the ftomach. There are different head-achs, as the cephalalgia, when\nthe head is affedted (lightly in one particular part. Cephalsea is when the whole\nhead is affetted, and one fide only is called hemicrania, and a fmall (pot affeded is\ncalled clavis hiftericus. Thefe various head-achs arife from different cauies : if it\nproceeds from obftrudions, crifes are very falutary, as they put the whole body in-\nto motion, and will remove thecaufe. Treating the part which you think is affec-\nted is very neceflary ; you do the fame with one hand or both, by drawing your\nhands towards you feveral times as before. To treat the head, you may apply your\nhands upon the temples, and put your thumb upon the frontal finus, which will of-\nten remove it.\n\u201c Deafness.-\u2014If the want of hearing proceeds fometimes from a fault in the\nftrudture of the ear, there is no cure. If it proceeds from cold, fever, hard wax, or\ndrinefs, you may magnetile according to my principles ;\nyou keep yourfelf within\na yard or two, according as you feel a re-a\u00a3tion : you then fix your left hand toward\nthe ear, and you move your right open, and bring it towards the left hand, and do\nthe fame as if you were to clap your hands, by that mean you put the air into vibra-\ntion, and, guided by your left hand as a conductor, you apply the palm of the hand\nupon the ears ;\nyou may put your thumb in the ear, and with your finger, as you\nhold a pinch of fnuff, prefs the thumb towards the ear\u2014 -you accelerate the fluid in-\nto it. You may make ufeof a conductor, either glafs or artificial magnet, and put\nit into the ear, and prefs jvith two fingers from the bafis towards the ear; you may\nmagnetife the head, by drawing the fluid towards you : all thefe means you are to\nmake ufe of according to your fenfations and judgment ;\nfometimes an injection made\nof Caftilefoap\u2014 warm brandy and water will affift you in your operation.\n\u201c Of the Tooth-Ach This violent, though not dangerous, difeafe proceeds\nfrom rheumatifm, obftruded perfpiration, inflammation, &c. this being the caf^\nyou treat according to my rules : if there is inflammation, you draw the fluid from\nthe head; you touch the temples, the frontal finus, the top of the head, and articu-\nlation of the jaws, and under the chin ; you may touch the tooth with your index\nand thumb, but a fure w-ay is to get an artificial magnet, and, as your patient\u2019s face\nis towards the South, apply the South pole upon the tooth, and touch the next teeth,\nand after draw the fluid downwards, and you will perform a cure.\nNo. 17. 3 Y \u201c Diseases\n\f1 66 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\n\u201c Diseases of the Ey es.\u2014There is nothing fo difficult as to cure thofe difeafes,\nand none of our organs is more fubjedt to be affedted than the fight, or from fo ma-\nny caufes. When they proceed from obftrudlions in the cuftomary evacuations, you\nmud magnetife according to my rules \u2022, you treat the caufe, alfo the eyes, by fixing\nyour thumbs oppofite ;\nyou prefs with the index the fluid into the eyes \u2022, you move\nyour thumb oppofite you\u2014and may rub the eyes gently ; you drop magnetifed wa-\nter into them with a quill, \u2014this you do three or four times a day, and you order a\nlittle lemonade or fyrup to your patient.\n\u201c The gutta ferena, ophthalmia, cataradl, fpecks on the eyes, and fiftula lacryrna-\nlis, are very difficult and almoft incurable. I have heard many magnetifers boafling\nof the cures they had made of thefe difeafes. I have had more practice in that way\nthan many of them ; I confefs candidly I have made but few. I fhall explain the\nbeft manner of treating You muft know firfl the caufe, which you treat \u2022, after\nyou apply your thumbs gently on the eyes ; you rub them often---you fix your\nthumb with the next finger at a diftance from the eye; but I have had fuccefs in\nfome cafes of this kind by making ufe of an artificial magnet, by fixing it at the\ndiftance of half an inch from them-, it has by that mean removed fpots and gutta\nferena, proceeding from thecornpreffion of the nerves by fuperfluous humours. I\nhave dropped magnet ifed water three or four times a day with fuccefs ; a proper re-\ngimen is neceflary, and fome internal and external application.\n\u201c Of the Epilepsy and Hysteric Affections.-\u2014 Thofe difeafes are the oppro-\nbrium of the faculty, with many others, as they cannot be cured by internal medi-\ncines, except when proceeding from obftrudlions, worms, or affedtion of the mind,\n&c. In thofe cafes you treat according to the rules ; then you touch the head on the\ntop apply your thumb on the root of the nofe, you endeavour to diftoive the ob-\nftrudtions which may be the caufe; apply your hand upon. the diaphragm, and en-\ndeavour to put the nerves in motion ; you may treat at a diftance alfo, but try to pro-\nduce a crifis.\u2014Dr. Andry, and Touret, at Paris, have cured feveral epileptics by\napplying artificial magnets round the head, or like a horfe-ffioe applied upon the\ntop of the head ; when they are in a fit, apply a magnet in each hand, it will foon\nrecover them. I have brought fome to, by applying a key in their hands ; they are\nvery good in fpafms, fainting, and cramps---by applying the magnet under the foot,\nit ceafes inftantly.\n\u201cOf the Schrophula, called the King\u2019s Evil.\u2014This difeafe is a difgrace to\nphyfic. Some perfons have had the gift of curing by touching. I have leen in\nLondon two perfons who had been touched by a man after he was hanged ; they\nwere relieved ; but I really 'believe it was the force of imagination, being frightened\nby the dead man made fuch a revolution in the blood, that it removed the obftruc-\ntion\n\fAND OCCULT S C.

You may touch your patient in thofe parts, and draw the ef-\nfluvia in order to rcfolve the glands : if there is an ulcer, order the perfon to bathe the\npart with magnetifed water, and keep a bit of rag always upon the part. Sea-bea-\nthing, decodtion of celery, and hemlock juice, may be tried, befides treating.\n\u201c Sore Throat, ---Sore throat, or any inflammation in the head, is to be treated\nby drawing the fluid out of the part, either by putting yourfelf in oppolition, or by\nfranding on one fide, and putting one hand behind the neck and the other before.\n\u201c Of the Palsy.-\u2014\nT\nhe pally, when it happens to an old perfon, or has been of\nlong (landing, is feldom cured ;\nbut if it happens to a middling age, and one fide\nonly is (truck, called an hemiphlegia, a cure will be effected by being treated foon\nafter. You may magnetite your patient oppoflte as ufual. After you turn the fide\naffedted towards the North, you treat the oppoflte fide, which is fuppofed to be\nwhere lies the caufe: you may touch with one hand along the back-bone, or within\nan inch from it, along the great intercoflal, by applying your right hand upon the\n(lomach \u2022, you treat him about two hours \u2022, if you can put him into a crifis, which\nis very eafy, you may expedt to cure him. You make him lift up his bad arm, or\nhave fomebody to fupport it \u2022, you put a conductor in his hand to attradl the univer-\nfal fluid ;\nyou may infulate him, and turn the part affcdled towards the North ; tie\na (ilk firing to the ceiling, at the end of it have a ftiong compounded magnet, the\nNorth pole parallel to the hand \u2022, to the other hand tie likewife another firing, at the\nend of which there is a large piece of iron whofe furface is larger than the magnet j\nhave an eledlric machine, and connect the chain to the patient, then make him\nilretch his arms \u2022, then touch the magnet and the piece of iron together, or one after\nanother, to the extremities of the hands, it will cure him ; I have cured feveral that\nway: but this does not belong to Animal Magnetifm, fay many. But has not a\nmagnetifer a right to cure his patients as foon as pofiible, and employ every means\nhis mind fuggefls to him ? It is not fo among the faculty, they muft cure or kill them\nfecundam artem, according to art. A general vomit or purge is often neceffary ; the\ndiet mud be good j if the tongue is affcdled, put a condudlor upon it, or an artifi-\ncial magnet, fuch as you make ufe of for the teeth, by prefling the fluid from the\nbafis towards the point on the tongue : fometimes a little gargarilm is ufefuh\nEledlricity and the cold bath are very good,\n\u201c Rheumatism.\u2014Nothing is more common in this country than that difeafe, on\naccount of the dampnefsand change of the weather, which will abforb the eledlric\nand magnetic fluid from flying oft certain parts, particularly from the feet, whence\nthere flies out a greater aoundance of fluid than from any other part of the body.\nIt is for that reafon dogs will follow our tracks. There are very obftinate rheuma-\ntifms which proceed from different caufes, and are difficult to cure. The method\nof\n\f2.68 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nof curing this difeafe is to magnetife the patient in oppofition : try to promote per-\nfpiration, by putting him into a crifis. If the rheumatifrn is in a particular part of\nthe body, you muft treat the part affefled either by touching or rubbing, which is\nthe belt. You may make ufe of an artificial magnet in the form of a horfe-fhoe.\nIf the rheumatifinis in the head, you apply it upon the top of it \u2022, if it is on the face\nand teeth, apply it on the temples \u2022, if it is in the hip, you apply it above the knee,\nwith the poles up ; if in the knees, apply it on the tarfus, with the poles up ; if it\nis on the Ihoulders, you place it on the humerus of the arms, bone, &c. Electrici-\nty, hot and cold bath, earth-bathing, according to Dr, Graham\u2019s principles, &c.\n&c. Some internal and external applications will affitl the operation.\n\u201cConsumption, or Decay.\u2014 This difeafe, fo common in England, is difficult\nto cure ; it proceeds from want of the animal fluid in the body, which waftes it to\nnothing ; therefore it is necefiary that the perfon who treats be very ftrong and heal-\nthy. His patient is like a child at the breaft, pumping his animal juice, and may be\nmuch hurt by it, like a child who fleeps with an old and unhealthy perfon \u2022, there-\nfore I would advile you to treat as few as poffible. Riding a young horfe without a\nfaddle, a cow, a bullock, or to be among cattle, is very good ; to deep in a liable,\nby communicating a rope from the bed to the cattle, which ferves as a conductor to\nthe animal fluid.\n\u201c Difeafes in the llomach are common in this country among women, owing to\nthat pernicious cuftom of wearing Hays ; not only that, but they mult have a piece\nof wood two or three inches broad, and proportionally thick, in it, called a bulk,\nwhich occafions fo many difeafes. They Ihould be loofe round the body. You\ntreat the llomach by throwing fluid into it. Crifes are not good for it.\n\u201c Flatulency, or wind in the llomach and bowels, arifes from want of tone in thofe\nparts. It is to be treated upwards, which will make the patient break wind and\nproduce a crifis, which is the bell. After the crifis, you mull treat the llomach\ndownwards in order to fettle it ;\nyou may order carminatives. Bile on the llomach\nis treated upwards \u2022, alfo to make the patient vomit, and crifes. are good for it \u2022, a glafs\nof magnetifed water after will fettle the llomach. In all forts of inflammation of\nthe lungs, liver, &c. you treat towards you, and avoid the crifes, as well as when\nthofe parts are ulcerated. In the Hone and gravel you treat; throw a quantity of\nfluid and produce crifis ; it will promote evacuation, which may do fervice to the\npatient. In external fwellings, or ulcers, draw towards you, and bathe with\nmagnetifed water.\n\u201c Pregnant women, and in labour, may be treated without a crifis. I have mag-\nnetifed women in labour, and put them afleep while the acoucheurwas performing\nhis duty ; the woman did not recoiled! it, and was furprifed afterwards. I have\npur\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 26g\nput a man a fleep who had an hydrocele ; the furgeon performed the operation, but\nthe patient never recolledfted any thing after. Relaxation, and the blood flowing\nfrom a cut, may be Hopped by fixing your thumb and prefling the fore finger over\nthe part.\n\u201c Fevers of every kind may be cured by crifes ; it is during that time that nature\nendeavours to get rid of what difturbs her, either by perfpiration, vomiting, &c.\nThofe people are the bell; fomnabulifts, as I fhall explain hereafter. It is very eafi-\nly underftood, by the method I have taken to explain the treating of the foregoing\ndisorders, that an ingenious magnetifer may treat all others, as it would require a\nwhole volume to explain them.\n\u201cOfNcRvous Diseases. It is in thofe difeafes that magnetifm afts more forcibly\nby putting the whole nervous fyftem in motion-, it operates crifes as well as fonam-\nbulifm, and offers to the attentive eye a vail field of obfervation. There is as great\na variety in thofe difeafes as there are combinations between all poffible numbers.\nDifferent organs may be affeCted, and diftin&ly from others. In fome perfons the\nextenfion of fight is fo great, that it feerns as if they made ufeof amicrofcope. Some\nof them can fee in the dark, the animal fluid flying in all directions, and appearing\nluminous ; others will fee the Hein appear to them like a fieve, and fee the grofs hu-\nmours or perfpiration as big as fmall fhot ; and by rubbing the hands they fee fpar-\nkies of fire coming out. Mr. Boyle mentions a perfon, after getting half fuddled\nwith claret (which 1 fuppofe relaxed the ftomach and his nervous fyftem), when he\nwalked in the night, could fee to read moderate print. Another who could in the\nnight diftinguilh colours. Grimaldi tells us, that fome women can, by their eyes\nalone, diftinguilh between eggs laid by black hens and thofe by white ones. This\nfinglefaft will lead to many things which I fhall relate about fomnabules. Wemuft\nnot attribute to whim all the Angularities which you obferve among people affected\nin the nerves ; it is areal caufe, as that which determines the molt reafonable man.\nI knew a gentleman in London, who fhook his head and arm every inftant, like a\nperpetual motion ; a lady, I treated when in his company, had the fame involuntary\naffefticn. A gentleman in Cork, when in company, would pronounce Peter often,\nand the fame word during a week ; then he would pronounce it a bad one during\nanother week, and could not help it. There are different methods of treating thofe\ndifeafes, either by treating without crifes, or with it ; fuch people are the beft fom-\nnabules. If a perfon is irritable, you treat gently, in oppofition, by drawing a cer-\ntain quantity of fluid from him; if on the contrary you throw the fluid towards him,\nyou may put him into a gentle crifis ; if the patient has a trembling of the limbs\nlike the head, you treat that part; if you cannot fucceed by treating, apply a mag-\nNo. 18.\n3 Z netic\n\farc A KEY T O 'P 'H Y S I G,\nnetrc bandeau round the head, it will flop it inftantly. For trembling of the hands,\nyou apply magnetic bracelets.\n\u201cTo magnetife or treat a perfon at a diftance, is not impoffibie. The manner\nwhich feveral profeffors make ufe of, is different. There are quacks in that art who\npretend to have found it out before Dr. Mefmer ; but that none of them dreamt of\nit is well known. The faculty of our foul, thought, or idea, can perceive, contem-\nplate, and unite itfelfto, any objedt, prefent, diflant, vifible, or invifible. That it\nhas adtion upon matter is well demonftrated \u2022, it adts diredtly upon the vivifying\neledtric and magnetic fluid, and by its will determines it to be directed upon fuch\npart. We know that our foul adts upon our body, and forces any part of it to move\nin any diredtion, according to its will. This being the cafe, we may reafonably\nbelieve that it may adt as well upon merely organical matter as upon animated bo-\ndies. The thought, or foul, goes to any diftance. No obftacles can refift it. It\narrives and unites itfelf, by a fympathetic power, to any objedt it wifhes, without a\nmafter of ceremonies *, neither the fize of the body, its ftrength, or figure, impede;\nall give way\n;\nthe union is made in an inftant, the will, and the will only, is the\ncaufeofir, becaufe it diredts the fluid towards the difeafes and aflfedted vifcera, by\nfixing them in your imagination, as much as it is poffible, and by that mean it will\nforce the magnetic fluid to touch and to penetrate to a great diftance any bodies to\nwhich the foul is willing to unite herfelf, and to re-eftablifh the animal oeconomy,\nof which fhe is the indeftrudtible principle. Thefe refledtions (hew the poflibility\nand the mean made ufe of, to treat a perfon at a diftance ; of which experience\nwill fhew the reality, and an ingenious mind may make many curious experiments\n:\nrepeated trials will convince us.\n\u201c To treat a perfon at a diftance, from one houfe to another, is poffible, provided\nyou have feen the perfon before, and put him in a crifis. The manner you do this,\nis to know where the perfon is, and fix the hour by your watch, and have fome\nfriends with the patient to divert him : you muft be alone in a room, to avoid any\nnoife, or any thing to diftradt the attention of your mind. In that pofition you paint\nthe perfon in your imagination ; you reprefent in your idea the part which you fup-\npofe aflfedted, and you treat in the fame manner as if the perfon were before you.\nThat fympathy of body and mind which exifts between you and him will produce\na crifis and fonabulifm ; that phsenomenon is very interefting. You may alfo from\nthe fame principles treat a perfon in the fame room, without his or her knowledge,\nby fixing you mind and your eyes upon the part aflfedted, or upon the heart, fto-\nmach, &c. and produce crifes and fonabulifm.\n\u201c Dropsy. There are different forts of this difeafe, according to the parts which\nare affedted. I fhall treat of the manner of curing the afcite, which is, when there\nis\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 271\nis a collection of water in the belly proceeding from obdrudtions, 'living too low,\nand fometimes from drinking fpirits or cold water when the body is hot. You treat\nthe patient in oppofition ; you fix your hands upon the parr, either at a didance,\nor by applying the hands on the belly ; you try to produce a crifis, which is the\nquickefi way. You may apply a mggnetifed bell-glafs on the belly when the pa-\ntient is in bed, the fame on the legs if they are fwelled, and various accefiaries, ac-\ncording to the operator\u2019s fancy. Dropfy of the brain, of the bread, and of the\nlegs, are treated by extrafling the fluid and promoting circulation and perfpiration.\n\u201cOf the Asthma. This difeafe of the lungs is very feldom cured when it proceeds\nfrom a bad formation of the bread, or is hereditary. If it comes from obdruftions,\ntreat the lungs and put the patient into crifes to promote circulation ; but if theadh-\nma proceeds from another caufe, as violent paflions of mind, humoreal or nervous,\nand the patient fpits a great deal, treat the domach upwards to promote expectora-\ntion. If the patient coughs much at night, give him a glafs of magnetifed water\ngoing to bed, and another in the morning. Moderate exercife in a gentle air is\nvery ufeful.\n\u201c Apoplexy. This fudden lofs of the fenfes may be cured by applying immedi-\nately, and with proper care. The caufe is an effufion of the blood, or a collection\nof watery humours. There are two forts, a fanguine and ferous apoplexy ; it is\ngenerally towards the brain that the caufe lies, becaufe the blood does not return\nfrom the head. That being the cafe, you magnetife the patient either in bed or up\n:\nif he is in bed, you day at his feet ;\nyou magnetife the head downward \u2022, you may\nget at his right fide, and magnetife as before; you touch his head, one hand behind\nand the other before, and bring your hands downwards ; you mud raife the head\nof the patient high. If it is a fanguine apoplexy, and you fee there is no change,\nyou may order a bleeding, or put the feet in warm flannel. Let the patient have\nfree air. You mud treat him four hours a day.\n\u201c Night Mare. This difagreeable difeafe puts the patient into the greated tor-\nture during his deep ; he feels often a weight upon his domach, like a man, cats,,\nor dogs, &c. He endeavours to cry aloud, and fancies himfelf going to be drown-\ned, or to be killed. It proceeds from a weak domach, nervous affections, &c.\nI have attended a patient who ufed to be blooded every year in May. During March\nand April he was always fo; but, as foon as he was bled, the pain was over. They\nare a kind of fomnabules. You may treat the domach, by throwing a quantity of\nfluid, in order to drengthen it ; alfo treat the head downwards. A glafs of magne-\ntifed water, going to bed, is very good.\n\u201c Of Sensations, looked upon as a fixth fenfe. There are as many fenfations\nas there are poffible differences between proportions, In all fenfations we mud con-\n1 fider\n\f272 AKEYTOPHYSIC,\nlider three things: the caufe producing the imprefllon, the nature and di\/pofition of\nthe organs receiving it, and the fenfations which have preceded it. It is by the\ncombination of thofe affinities that the organs of our fenfes may be magnified or in-\ncreafed to fuch a degree, as to become, for every objedt which they prefent to us,\nwhat telefcopes and microfcopes are to the fight ; confequently our fenfations are the\nrefultofall the effedts which objedts make on our organ. Our fenfes can only draw\nus, more or lefs, near to knowledge of objedts and their nature, by a conftantufe'\nand a ferious application, in order to attain to their reality. We have a great num-\nber offmall organs proper to receive fenfations ; but the habit we are in of making\nufe of fome particular organs only, abforbs the reft. Blind people have different\nfenfations from us ; they will perceive a wall, or other body, before they touch it.\nThere is no doubt but we are endowed with an internal fenfe, which is in affinity\nwith the univerfe, and is confidered as an extenfion of fight; it is by thofe means\none may comprehend the poffibility of finding the difeafe of another ; of forefights,\npredidtions, and the phenomenon of fomnabules and fybils, &c.\n\u201c It is poffible to be affedted in fuch a manner, as to have the idea of a body at\nan immenfe diftance, in the fame manner as we fee the ftars, the impreflion of which\nis tranfmitted to us in aright line, the fucceffion and continuity of a co-exifting\nmatter between them and our organs, bounded by the nature of their form: why\nfhould it not be poffible, by the means of an inward organ, by which we are in con-\ntact with the whole univerfe, for us to be affedted by beings, the fuecefilve motion\nof which is propagated to us in curve or oblique lines, in any diredtion ? and why\nftiould we not be affeded by the connedion of beings which fucceed one another ?\n\u201cI was acquainted with Monfieur de Botinau, who had a place under govern-\nment in the Iftandof St. Helena. During twenty years he made a particular ftudy\nof a fenfe unknown to us : he could perceive a fleet or a fingle fhip two or three\nhundred miles off ; laft war he defcribed M. de Suffrein\u2019s fleet, the number of fhips,\nand thofe which had pafled by and did not touch at the ifland. He could do more :\nat fea he could tell the diftance he was off land, as has been proved by repeated ex-\nperiments in the Channel. 1 cannot fay this fc# certain, but I have feen the certifi-\ncates granted him from the governor and principal people of the ifland, and the pe-\ntition and recommendation to the minifter, who granted him 1800 iivres per annum.\n\u201c The famous Bleton, called the fourcier, or fpring-finder, whenever he walked\nupon a ground where there was a vein of water, felt within himfelf a certain fen-\nfation which gave him notice there was water. Another countryman fhook where-\never there was water-, the elementary, eledtric, or magnetic, fire paffing through the\npores of the earth, gave him that fen fat ion.\n\u201c Of\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 2 73\n\u201c Of the Crises. The crifes are an effort of nature againfl the diforder, endea-\nvouring to diffipate the obftacles that are in the circulation, and to reftore har-\nmony or equilibrium in all the parts of the body. Few difeafes can be cured with-\nout a crifis, particularly when it proceeds from obftruCtions, &c. There are two\nforts of crifes. The natural one, which is attributed to nature alone, gets rid of\nwhat offends her by an increafe of movement, producing vomiting, motion, per-\nfpiration, &c. Thefe are the moft falutary, as nature aCts filently, without violence,\nand expels the obftacles that impede circulation, by moving gently the molecules\nwhich form thofe impediments, and go off by perfpiration, &c. The forced one is\nfometimes falutary in obftruCtions, windy and bilious complaints. Thefe are pro-\nduced when nature is infufticient to expel what offends her. The ufe of animal\nelectricity and Magnetifm puts in aCtion the whole body, and, in conjunction with\nher, aCts efficacioufty on the patient, and he difcovers benefit and eale, particularly\nif it has produced evacuations, &c. There are various means of producing them,\naccording to the fubjeCt, and the caufe of his dileafe. Some fay there are fix degrees\nof crifes*, I fay there are as many as there are different conftitutions to treat. Some\nwill alfo call it luminous crifis, from that new feCt called the illuminated. All thefe\nare imaginary. Suppofeyou have a patient on whom you would wifh to produce a\ngentle crifis *, you muft put yourfelf firft in affinity ; then put one hand behind the\nhead, and the other before, till the perfon is afleep. If the perfon is agitated, calm\nhim, by drawing the fluid downwards from the head ; if you treat the caufe by\ntouching, it will increafe the pain ; if you put your thumb upon the frontal finus,\nthey will fall into a crifis : you may magnetife your watch, and to fhew what\no\u2019clock it is, they will go into it. You may magnetife a flower, andjgive them afmell,\nthey will fall in. Magnetife a harpfichord, as foon as you play on it they will go\nin. Put a perfon between you and the patient, and magnetife him, you will put\nhim in. To magnetife a pond, make the patient ftay on the other fide of it ; you\nmuft Hand oppofite *, make the patient hold a flick in his hand to touch the water ;\nyou muft touch alfo the water with your magnetifed conductor ; the perfon will go\ninto a crifis immediately. Have fomebody behind him, to prevent his falling into\nthe water : it is the belt conductor of animal fluid. To make a perfon read, be be-\nhind him *, you magnetife the lines as he reads ; he will go in. To make a perfon\nftay behind you oppofite the looking glafs, magnetife with a conductor the perfon\nin a looking glafs, that you may fee him ;\nthe re-aCtion of the fluid will produce a\ncrifis. Magnetife a tree in a walk, make the perfon walk as foon as he comes near\nthe magnetifed tree, he will fall into a crifis. One may put a perfon in a crifis\nfrom one room to another ; and, in faCt, an ingenious obferver may, by what I have\nrelated, make a great many curious experiments, provided he has proper fubjeCts.\nNo. 18. 4 A \u201cOf\n\f274 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\n\u201c Of Somnabulism. Somnabulifm is a ftate between fleeping and waking, par-\nstaking of both ; the patient is a fomnabule when he can do the fame as if he were\nawake. Thefe natural fornnabules, who get up at night, and do many wonderful\nthings, are well demonftrated. They are difeafed, and may be cured by treating.\nThe magnetic fornnabules are thofe whom art has found out a mean of ablorbing or\nfufpending fome of their external fenfes for a while, and the patient eats and drinks,\ngoes up and down, plays upon the harpfichord, and does many things which you\n\u2022defire him, provided he be willing. The firft I faw was at the Marquis de Puyfegur\u2019s,\nin the year 1784, and all thofe who pretended in this country before were impoftors ;\nand none of them had yet dreamt of it ; and for all this we are indebted to Dr. Mef-\nmer. Whenever any perfon has a real fomnabule, which is very eafy, by care they\nhave a treafure. They are called by us malades medians, or fick phyficians.\nThefe beings fee in the dark, and go through an external atmofphere, the fame as a\nglow-worm ; they have befides an internal atmofphere, which they make ufe of to\nperceive objedts prefent, diftant, vilible, and invifible. I have had feveral who re-\nlated to me what they could perceive. All of them differ in many refpebts, accor-\nding to their conftitution. One muff not depend always upon what they fay, on\naccount of their differing fometimes. You may make them move in any direction,\nby your will alone j or, by moving your conductor any way upon the floor, they\nwill follow its directions. You may make them play on any inftrument they can\nplay upon , they will read, write, and work : all this they will do better than if awake.\nBeing deprived of their other faculties, they become ftronger. No phyfician can\ntell the difeafe of a perfon better than a real fomnabule. They feldom fail to tell\nunknown perfons their difeafes, and prefcribe for them. At a future time, when\nthe fcience is better efcablifhed, I fhall publifh a full account of the theory of\nfomnabulifm.\n\u201c Some will accufe me of having faid too much-, but thofe who know me perfonal-\nly will never accufe me of relating any thing which I cannot demonftrate -, and thofe\nwho repeat thefe marvellous narrations hurt themfelves and the fcience in the eyes\nof really learned men. Thofe flories, like tradition, which are handed down from\ngeneration to generation, and become improbable, like antiquity, lofe their for-\nmer luftre. I would advife my pupils to try thofe experiments I have fhewn them\nfirft, and try the others afterward.\n\u201c To make an Electric or Magnetical Apparatus. I fhall not give you a\nfull account of the apparatus of our fociety in Paris. It is more like a grove. Mine,\nwhich I had in London and Dublin, is a large oak tub, eight feet in diameter, well\npitched in the inflde, about an inch thick, infulated upon four glafs feet bottles,\nof water well corked \u2022, you magnetife the bottles, and lay them down, the\nneck\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 275\nneck of one in the bottom of the other all round, fo that the laft comes to the cen-\ntre. You may fill up the fpace with broken bottles, or any vitrifiable matter, brim-\nftone, or refinous matter, minerals, &c. fill it up all but fix inches ;\nput fome\nloadftones and artificial magnets in different directions, then cover the whole to the\nedge with fine dry river fand *, put the lead over ;\nplace in the middle a polifhed\niron bar about eight feet high, with fprigs to it, to attract the univerfal fluid which\nconcentres itfclf in the refervoir. At the far corner place an arbor vit\u00a3 in a box,\nand place under it aftrong magnet, the north pole upwards ; the fouth pole is fix-\ned in a hole upon the cover, by that means you increafe the motion of the tree, and,\nbecoming vegetalifed, it will grow without water. You make holes all round,\nabout eighteen inches diftant \u2022, put iron or brafs conductors behind, fo as to touch\nthe patients who come next to it. Conned a chain of an eledric machine ; infulate\nyour patients, and make them hold hands, it will increafe the adion in them.\nYou may treat them in that manner \u2022, you will the fooner put them into crifes. I\nhave had all my patients round my refervoir in a crifis at a time. I could not at-\ntend them. You may have a tree in a box, upon infulated feet \u2022, have a fmall box\nfilled with vitrifiable matter, and fill it with water ;\nyou may make ufe of a large\nbottle filled with water only, and conned a chain to it. All this apparatus may be\nmade differently, according to the idea. Some take every morning brimftone or\nlozenges, and have brimftone in their fleeves, and rub themfelves with different in-\ngredients ;\nbut I never made ufe of any, and produced a great many effeds.\n\u201c To magnetife a tree, you muff Hand facing the north ; you mud: have a con-\ndudor which you have magnetifed ; you muff then point it fx-om the top of the\nhigheft branches to the roots ; do the fame from the other branches : if the tree is\nfo large that you cannot fee the branches on the other fide, change your pofition\nfrom fouth to north, and do the fame ; then approach the tree ; clap your hands\nround it, and ftay in that pofition five minutes, your tree becomes magnetifed.\nAny patient who has been in a crifis, or fomnabuliifn, will diftinguifh it. Some\nwill go in a crifis as foon as they come near it ; others, if they are in fomnabulifm,\nwill difcover it among the reft.\n\u201c You may magnetife a myrtle, or any other fhrub ; it will appear luminous in\nthe dark. You may magnetife a flower, by putting your thumbs in the middle,\nand eftablifh an equator ; then, drawing your thumbs to the extremities, you prefs\nyour thumb with the next finger, and you throw the fluid upon the flower ;\nit will\nappear luminous in the dark : by giving it to a perfon to fmeH, who has been in a\ncrifis before, he will go into one again.\n\u201c To magnetife a condudor or a cane, put your hands in the middle of it; Hide\nyour hands to the extremities, your thumbs at the top, and rub the extremities with\nthem ; %\n\f-275 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthem ; by thefe means you will impregnate it with an electrical fluid, that feems\nluminous in the dark, and as fulphurous as the electric rubbing.\n\u201c To magnetite a (hilling, or a guinea, put your thumbs in the middle, and\ndraw them to the extremities, it will appear as a ball of fire. A watch is magne-\ntifed in the fame manner, by drawing your two thumbs at the top, and your index\nunder it *, eftablifh an equator, and draw your fingers to the two poles : by (hewing\nit to a perfon who has been already in a crifis, he will fall in one again. They can\ntell you what o\u2019clock it is in the dark ; if afleep they can tell you the fame, by\nfire wing a watch.\n\u201c To magnetife a harpfichord, fix your hands fpread in the middle, and draw\nthem towards the extremities; then rub the end you touch the firings with one af-\nter another, in the fame manner, by that mean you will impregnate it with an elec-\ntric fluid. As foon as a perfon plays upon the harpfichord, make your patient touch\nit with his hand or finger, he will fall in a crifis immediately.\n\u201c To magnetife a room, or a bed, is the fame. Set it to the north facing the\nfout\u2019n \u2022, point your conductor up to the ceiling ;\nbring it down towards you ; point\nit to the weft and eaft, and bring it alfo to your feet ; the room will appear all lu-\nminous, and the bed alfo.\n\u201cA pond may be magnetifed in the fame manner, by pointing your conductor over\nthe furface of the water, from the cardinal points ;\ntouch the water with it, and\nmake your patient do the fame, he will have a (hock, in falling in, and it may be\ncf fervice to him. From thefe few experiments it iseafy to conceive, that any in-\nanimated body may be electrified or magnetifed by another animal body, juft as\neafy as by an eledtrifying machine, or by the force of magnets.\u201d\n\\\nARGUMENTS to PROVE, that ANIMAL MAGNETISM is the CAUSE\nof SYMPATHY in MAN and other ANIMALS, and in PLANTS, &c.\nTHAT conftant flux and reflux of the vital principles and corporal humours in\nman (without which both motion and life are (topped) produce thofe effedts of\nfympathy and antipathy which become more natural and lefs miraculous ; the at-\nmofpherical particle to each individual receives from the general fluid the proper\nattradlion and repulfion. In the divers erodings of thofe individual atmofpheres,\nfome emanations are more attradlive between two beings, and others more repulfive;\nfo again, when one body pofleffes more fluid than another, it will repel *, and that\nbody which has lefs will make one effort to reftore itfelf into equilibrium or fym-\npathy with the other body. Robin Abraham Benhannes fays, iron or ferruginous\nparticles are every where, not only in the mineral world, but in ourblood and bones\ni now,\nc\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. *77\niow, as the magnet attra&s ferruginous particles, every thing of courfe is fubfer-\nvient to magnetifm, by the power of attraction or fympathy.\nI could relate a variety of examples to prove that fympathetic affeCtion which pre-\nvails with people of the fame family, views, feCt, or any other caufe that binds them\nharmonioufly together ; but, as it is a fubjeCt which every one mutt have experien-\nced, I Ihall not touch further on it.\nThe magnetic fluid often occaflons fome contractions in other parts of the body,\nwhen a mufcle has been wounded, which produces different motions in the organs\nof the fame body. Whether they have a fecret affinity or not is a queftion not yet\ndetermined ;\nhowever, l am inclined to think they have. Thefe motions have afto-\nnifhed many phyficians who have reflected upon this art, particularly Barthe, who\nhas well explained them by a fubtile motion which he calls vitalfluids and which he\nmight as well have called animal electricity and magnetifm.\nOf ANTIPATHY.\nWE do not all refemble the Trojan fhepherd, who awarded the apple to the\nfaireft ; it is not always the handfomeft woman that wins our affeCtions ; our inte-\nrior emotions are involuntary feizures independent of the influence of beauty, and\nare the forerunners of love. So again, when two atmofpheres are in equilibrium,\nthat is to fay, when thofe corpufcular emanations are in affinity with each other, it\nproduceth fympathy or attraction ; but, when thofe atmofpheres are eroding each\nother, it produceth antipathy or repulflon.\nThe difcordance of tempers, religious deputations, politics, &c. have frequent-\nly been the caufe of inveterate hatred ;\nhow can we otherwife account forthat fudden\naverfion we feel for certain objeCts or perfons, if it be not in the difagreeable im-\npreflions communicated to the nerves, and then to the brain, from the emiflion of\nthofe perfons or objeCts ? This can be called by no other name than antipathy.\nBy antipathy many people And out the difeafes of others; they feel within them-\nfelves, in the oppofite fide, the fame pain the other perfons have. If I put a difea-\nfed perfon in contaCt with another perfon in fomnabulifm, they inftantly feel the\nfame pain ; however, only during the time they are in contaCt. It may be called\nfympathy ; but, as they l'uffer in fome proportion during that time, it is properly an-\ntipathy. It is well known there are many people who entertain an antipathy to\ndifferent animals, &c.\nEFFECTS- of ANTIPATHY and SYMPATHY in BRUTE ANIMALS.\nANIMALS in general, like ourfelves, move at the afpeCt of pleafure, and fly\nfrom that of diff: refs ; in fome refpeCts they are fenflble beings that feem to enjoy a\nNo. 1$. 4 B will\n\fty8 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nwill adequate to determine their different motions, nay fometimes to be poffeffed of\nthe fentiments, vices, and paffions, of mankind, and experience likewife inclination\nand hatred, which feldom vary in their objefts ; whence proceeds that conftant love\nthat fome animals fhew for certain fpecies, whilft they bear the ftrongeft antipathy\nand averfion to others. They are differently affe&ed acording to their different\nfpecies by corpufcularemifiions, but are nearly the fame when they flow from the\nfame fpecies. Hence the one conftantly becomes the objefl of the other\u2019s averfions.\nThus one animal only lives to deftroy and devour; and in his turn contributes, by\nhis own diftru&ion, to the prefervation of a ftronger animal. Thus nature is fup-\nported by thefe fuccefllve deftrudions, new combinations arife from the compofi-\ntions operated in her bofom : likfe the phoenix, fhe only dies to revive, and return\nbrighter out of her own afhes. Without thinking (as the antients did) that a firing\nmade out of the bowels of a wolf and another from a fheep cannot agree, or if two\ndrums were made out of their fkins the found proceeding from that of the wolf fkin\nwould deprive the other of all found, antipathy between certain fpecies is evidently\na means allotted them by inftind to difcover their prey or avoid their enemy. Thus\nthe wolf purfuCS the lamb, the dove dreads the falcon, the wren the eagle, the gold-\nfinch the toad, the hen the fox, the water-fowl the ftork, the grafshopper the fwal-\nlow, the blackbird the hawk, the nightingale the fpeckled magpie, the frog the eel,\nthe fnail the partridge, the oyfter the crab, the tench the pike, the fly the fpider,\nand the fpider the fcorpion. The lion diflikes the cock, the ape the tortoife, the\nhorfe the camel, the lizard the ferpent, the boar the fea-calf, the martin the vulture,\nthe owl the crow, the tunny the dolphin, the conger the lamprey, with an infinite\nnumber of others too tedious to be mentioned. The fmell of lobfters drives bees\naway ; the owl deftroys the eggs of the crow, the flock thofe of the bat, and weafel\nthofe of the hen ;\nthe heron and the lark are continually at war, by deflroying each\nother\u2019s young. If the eagle devours the ferpents, the latter climbs up the rocks and\nrevenges itfelf by fucking its enemies eggs ; the toad and the rattlefnake, under the\ngrafs, by darting through their pores the magnetic fluid, fafcinate their prey ; the\nweafel in vain endeavours to avoid them ; fhe leaps from one place to another, and -\nherftrength is at laft exhaufled to no purpofe ; obliged to draw near her enemy,\nfheifluesadifmalcry,and, being violently attracted towards the reptile\u2019s mouth, perr\ncipitates herfelf into it, and there finds her grave. To revenge this vidlim, the field\nfpider fpins her web fufpended over the toad : her influence troubles and at laft lulls\nhim to deep. In like manner the flag\u2019s breath attracts the ferpent, and occafions in\nhim a giddinefs. The viper, with fiery eyes and contradled mufcles, darts veno-\nmous corpufcles on the branch of the tree where the nightingale finds an afylum ;\nfoon after, the wood-finger lofes his voice, is thrown into convulfions, falls down,\nv and\nV\n\fand OCCULT SCIENCE. *7$\nand is devoured by the viper. It is owing to the effe&s of emifiion that the hound\nfinds out the game, and purfues it to its den, where it feek for a refuge. It is by\nthis fame fenfation that the partridge flops in the middle of a fallow ground, and\nforgets (he has the power of flying.\nAnimals are as fufceptible of fympathetical as of antipathetical attachments : ac-\ncording to fome naturalifts, the fox is fond of the ferpent\u2019s comipany, and the duck\nthat of the toad ; the bear avoids treading on the ant, the nightingale loves the pear\ncock, the kite prote&s the cuckoo, partridges and pheafants doat on the flag, and\ndoves on teal. We v\nare told that a lizard, elephant, and dolphin, are fond of a\nman ; but this is nothing to the attachment of a dog to its mafter : he follows him\nto all places ;\nand, fhould he happen to lofe fight of him, he ftill finds out where he\npaffed only by the emanation he has left in his way, (which efcapesmore abundantly\nthrough the toes, as being more porous ;) and, if he meets him, by a thoufand tranf-\nports teftifies his joy.\nOf ATTRACTION and REPULSION, otherwife called SYMPATHY and ,\nANTIPATHY in PLANTS.\nPLANTS, like men, have their tranfpiration and emifiion produced by a preff\nfure of a magnetic fluid which penetrates them ; and they carry in all their fibres >\nthat vivifying fluid, and have alfo their private fpheres of attraction and repulfion.\nHence that inclination that fome vegetables feem to have to come nearer to each *\nother, to grow and die together; hence that hatred that has been obferved amongft\nothers, and the efforts feemingly made ufe of to repel each other.\nThe vine feems to improve under the elm, the olive-tree with the aloe-tree, the\nplantain with the fig-tree, the agaric with the cedrus, afparagus with penny-royal, ,\nand the cocoa grows powerfully under the fhade of ebony ; the rofinous-tree is favour-\nable to the femla, and the colyledon and the fir-tree to the different fpecies of aco-'\nnitum and folanum. By a like fympathy the poppy adorns the harveft, the water-\nlily likes the ranunculus, and rue likes the water-lily ; the lily fprings delightfully\nby the rofe, near garlic, where it appears more fhining, and fmells more perfu-\nmed, notwithftanding the fmell of the latter is fo offenfive ; the rofe is unfavoura-\nble to onions, bafilicum dries up near rice, and cabbages die away near the cycla--\nmen and origuiam ; the oak does not like the olive, the vines diflike laurel and\nhemlock, and hemlock dies away near the vines. The latter brings to our recollec-\ntion the doftrine of old Robin Abraham Benhannes, who in the 14th century attri-\nbuted the colour of wine and its fermentation to the ferruginous particles of the\ngrape, and to their union by magnetifm.

This clover will appear whitifh in the morning, of a\npurple colour in the middle of the day, and towards the evening it looks yellow and\npale. It is the abundance of that fluid in fome plants which renders them fo apt to\ninfpire men and other animals with a defire of love ; and it is the want of it in other?\nthat appeafes the heat of blood, and flops the progrefs of rifing paflion.\nCONSIDERATIONS on the INDISPOSITIONS and DISEASES of MAN.\nMAN, with regard to his prefervation, ought to be confidered,\n1.

The whole of the matter whichconftitutes him may be either\nincreafed or diminifhed. The diminution ought to be repaired from the general\nmafs by the means of aliments, as food, drink, and other ftimuli.\nMotion may in like manner be either encreafed or diminifhed. The diminution\noccafioned by motion, as walking or any other bodily exercife, is repaired by fleep.\nMan fuftaining two kinds of Ioffes, it neeeffarily follows that there muft be two\nkinds of reparation in theflateof fleep. Man aCts like a machine whofe principles\n\u00a9f motion are applied inwardly and independently of the organs of fenfe. The\nj fleeping\n\fA-ND OCCULT SCIENCE. 2S1\nfleeping ftate of man, is when the life and function of a confiderable part of his in-\ndividual faculties are fufpended for a while, during which the quantity of motion\nloft while awake is repaired by the general currents in which he is placed. There\nare two forts of currents with regard to man, gravity and the magnetic current from\none pole to another ; that is to fay, from head to foot, man receives and colleCts a\ncertain quantity of the univerfal current as if in a refervoir; the overplus of motion\n(or the overflowing of this refervoir) determines the ftate of waking. This exiftence\nof man begins in a ftate of fleep ; the degree of motion he receives, in that ftate,\nproportionate to the mafs, is employed in the formation and unfolding of his organs.\nAs foon as his formation is completed, he awakes, and makes efforts on his mother\npowerful enough to bring him into the world. If his conftitution is debilitated,\nhis motion being too flow owing to his weaknefs, he will prefent a wrong pofltion,\nand will not come into the world without afliftance, owing to his not having fuffi-\ncient ftrength to turn himfelf the proper way.\nMan is in a ftate of health, when all the parts of which he is compofed have\nthe power of exercifing the functions they were defigned for with pleafure and eafe.\nIf there is perfect order in all the functions, it conftitutes a ftate of harmony or\nequilibrium. Illnefs is the oppofite ftate, wherein harmony is difturbed, and is\neither extended over the whole fyftem or confined to one part.\nHealth may be reprefented by a right line. Illnefs is a deviation from that right\nline : that deviation is more or lefs confiderable, according to the ftrength of the\ndifeafe \u2022, the remedy adjufts the order or harmony which were difturbed \u2022, the quan-\ntity of the univerfal motion that man receives in his origin becomes tonical by be-\ning modified in the womb, and helps the unfolding of the vifcera, and all the other\norganical parts of his conftitution.\nThis power of motion is the principle of life 1 this principle maintains and recti-\nfies the functions of the vifcera. Vifcera are the conftituent and organical parts,\nwhich prepare, reCtify, and afiimylate, all humours, determine their motion, fecre-\ntions, and excretions. The vital principle, being a part of the univerfal motion, and\nobeying the common laws of the univerfal fluid, is confequently fubjeCted to the\nimpreflions of the influences of celeftial, earthly, and particular, bodies with which\nit is furrounded. That faculty or property of man, which renders him fufceptible\nof all thefe impreflions, is animal magnetifm or animal electricity.\nMan, being conftantly in the univerfal and particular currents, is penetrated by\nthem ; the motion of the modified fluid by the different organizations of its confti-\ntuent parts becomes tonical *, it follows in that ftate the continuity of the body to\nthe extreme parts. From thefe extremities of the body either flow out or pafs in\nNo. 18. 4C currents\n\f282 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ncurrents of the univerfal fluid, when another body capable of receiving or returning\nthem is placed in an oppofitfc point.\ni. There is a circulation formed between the currents pafflng in and out. 2. Thefe\ncurrents are ftraitened and almofi: re-united in the fame point \u2022, and thefe two caufes-\nconcur together to encreafe fucceflively the celerity of motion.\nThefe points of emanation or introdu&ion to or from the tonical current are\npoles, bearing analogy to thole we fee in loadftones or artificial magnets; confe-\nquently there are fome currents coming or ifiuing out of the poles which deftroy or\nftrengthen each other; their communications being the fame, it fuffices to determine\none for the oppoflte to be formed at the fame time. Upon a fuppofed line between\ntwo poles there is a center or point of equilibrium, the a&ing of which is fuch that\nno direction is predominant. Thefe currents may be propagated and communica-\nted at any diftance whatever, either by continuities, connection of bodies and minds,\nas fympathy, or that of a fluid, fuch as air, water, found, &c. It is a conftantlaw,\nthat, in each variety of an intermediate body, the poles are either overturned or\nchanged.\nAll bodies whofe form ends in a point or angle ferve to receive the currents, and\nbecome their conductors. We may confider the currents as openings or channels\nto convey other currents. Currents can penetrate all folid and liquid bodies, prefer-\nring always the direction they have received. Thefe currents may be communica-\nted and propagated by any means, whenever there exifts a continuity, either folid\nor fluid, in the rays of light, and by a fucceffion of the vibrations of found. Thefe\ncurrents may be reinforced, 1. bycaufcs of common motion, fuch as the inteftines,\nand local motion, found, noife, wind, &c. the eleCtrical friCtion, and every other\nbody which is aloadftone, is already endowed with a determinate motion, by ani-\nmate bodies, by trees, and all vegetables : 2. by their communication with hard\nbodies in which they may happen to be concentered and aflembled, as in a refer-\nvoir, to be afterwards at pleafure diftributed in every direction : 3. by the multi-\nplication of bodies to which they are communicated, that principle being not a\nfubflance ; by a modification its effeCt encreales like that of fire, in proportion to\nits communication. If the current of animal electricity and magnetifm concurs in.\n\/\nrts direction with the general magnetic current of the world, the encreafing of all\nthefe currents is the general efFeCt which relults from it. Thefe currents may again,\nbe reflected by looking-glafies, after the laws of light.\nOf\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 2 %\nOf INDISPOSITION and DISEASE.\nIT has been obferved, that man\u2019s life is a quantity of univerfal motion, which in\nits origin becomes tonical, applied to matter, deftined to form the organs and vifcera,\nand afterwards to maintain and rectify their fundtions. Man\u2019s life begins in mo-\ntion, and ends in reft. The entire abolition of tonical motion is death. As in all\nnature motion is the fource of every combination, as well as reft is of matter, fo,\nin man, the principle of life becomes the caufe of death.\nEvery unfolding and formation of an organical body depends on the various and\nfucceffive relations between motion and reft ; their equality being determined, the\nnumber of poffible relations between the one and the other ought alfo to be deter-\nmined. The diftance between two terms or given points may be confidered as re-\nprefenting the duration of life ; one of thefe terms or points is motion, the other\nreft. The fucceffive progreffion of the various proportions of the one and the other\nconftitutes the progrefs and revolution of life. Proceeding thus from motion to\nreft, we arrive at at the point of their equilibrium \u2022, after that point we begin by-\ndegrees to die.\nThat progreffion of divers modifications between motion and reft may have an\nexadt proportion, or that proportion may be difturbed. If man runs through that\nprogreffion without the proportions being difturbed, he lives in a good ftate of\nhealth, and arrives at his term without illnefs : on the contrary, as foon as the pro-\nportions are troubled, difeafe begins. Illnefs is nothing elle but a perturbation in\nthe progreffion of motion and life, which may be confidered as exifting either in\nfolid or fluid bodies. If it exifts in folids, it difturbs the harmony of the properties\nof organical bodies by diminifhing the one and encreafing the other. If it exifts in\nfluids, it difturbs their local and internal motion.\nThe abberation from motion in folids, by altering their properties, difturbs the\nfundtionsof the vifceraand the various elaborations which ought to take place. The\nabberation from the inteftine motions of humours produces their degeneration.\nThe abberation from local motions produces obftrudtion or debility, fever or irri-\ntation.\nThe flownefs or abolition of motion produces obftruflions or debility \u2022, die acce-\nleration of motion produces fever or iritability. The perfedlion of folids or vifcera\nconfifts in the harmony of all their properties and fundtions, and the refult of the\nfunction of the vicera are the quality of fluids with their inteftine and local motion.\nTo be able to rectify the general harmony of the body, we muft rectify the fundtron\nof the vifcera \u2022, becaufe, their fundlion being once re-eftabiifhed, they rectify every\nthing that can be fo, and. divide every thing that cannot be redtified.\nThat\n\f2% A KEY TO PHYSI C,\nThat effort of nature or vifcera upon the humour is called crifis, or paroxyfm i\nand no difeafe can be cured without a crifis. In all crifes, we diftinguifh three\nHates, the perturbation, digeftion, and evacuation. Difeafe being an abberation\nfrom harmony, that abberation or pre-difpofition may be more or lefs confiderable,\nand produce more or lefs fenfible effects which are called fymptoms. If thofe ef-\nfects are produced by the courfe of the difeafe, they are called fymptomatic fenfa-\n'tions; if on the contrary they are the efforts of nature againft the caufe of illnefs,\nthey are called critical fymptoms. It is of the greateft moment to diftinguifh them\nwell in practice, to prevent and flop the one, and favour the other.\nIt follows from what has been faid, that all caufes of difeafe difturb and alter\nmore or lefs the proportion between matter and motion, the proportion of the vifcera,\nthe proportion between fluids and folids, and confequently they produce by their\ndifferent applications a remiflion or perturbation more or lefs confiderable in the\nproperties of matter. To remedy the effects of remiflion and their perturbation,\nand to deftroy or ftop them, the remiflion of properties rauft be provoked ;\nthat\nis to fay, in animal bodies, the irritability or animal eleCtricity muft be increafed by\ndifferent ftimula. There are two methods of doing this : i. to leffen the obftacles;\n2. to increafe the aCtion of nature, by a continual, fhaded, foft and harmonic,\napplication of magnetic currents.\nA body being in harmony is hardly fenfible to the effect of animal electricity\nand magnetifm, becaufe that the application of an uniform and general aCtion can-\nnot alter any thing in proportions which are both exadt and already confervant with\nthat harmony. If on the contrary a body is not in harmony, that is to fay, if it is\nin that ftate wherein proportions are diflurbed, the habit it is in to experience that\ndiffonance hinders it from being more fenfible, and it becomes fo by the application\nof animal eleftricity and magnetifm ; becaufe that difpofition and diffonance are in-\ncreafed. On thefe principles it is eafy to conceive that fick perfons drawing near\ntheir recovery become gradually infenfible to animal ele&ricity and magnetifm;\nand that abfolute infenfibility to its power conftitutes the perfedt cure.\nIt follows, from the fame principles, that the application of animal ele&ricity and\nmagnetifm muft often increafe the pain, as its aftion occafions the fymptomatic\nfenfations to diminifli or ceafe ; and, the efforts of nature againft the caufes of difeafe\nbeing increafed, it is abfolutely neceffary for the critical fymptoms to increafe in the\nfame proportion.\nIt is by the exaCt obfervations of their feveral effeCts we are enabled perfectly to\ndifcern the fymptoms. The unfolding of the fymptoms is made in the contrary or-\nder by which the difeafe was formed, and may be compared to a ball of twine which\nwinds off in the contrary order to which it was wound on.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 285\nOf HUMAN IMPREGNATION;\u2014FORMATION of the FCETUS\u2014ORI-\nGIN of DISEASES\u2014and PRINCIPLES of LIFE and DEATH.\nIT was not my intention to go into this Treatife fo much at large, in my prefent\nwork ; but confidering that the fubjedt is of the higheft importance, and that the\nMedical Part could not be made complete without it, I have refolved to introduce\nit here, though I fhall be under the neceffity of extending my Plan to a few more\nnumbers. Thefe, I truft, will not be unacceptable ;\nfince they will be accompa-\nnied with a fet of very curious and valuable plates, defigned on purpofe to iiluftrate\nthis interefting fpeculation.\nIn contemplating the works of creation and the word of God, unfolded to us by\nthe light of Revelation and Scripture; by analogy, reafon, medical experiments, and\nanatomy, we are enabled to trace the human oeconomy farther in her retirement, and\ndeeper in her occult retreat, than fome medical men are willing to fuppofe. Impo-\nverished by a fafhionable ftile of living, and driven to the neceffity of multiplying\npotions and fees, their objeCt is not to heal, but to nourilh the feeds of human infir-\nmity. The truth of this remark has been but too often experienced ;\nand indeed\nconfejjed by fome, in thofe awful moments, when diffi initiation would be vain. Far\nbe it from me to arraign the profeffional character in its general capacity ; it is\nonly the medical locufts that I wifh to eradicate ; and I am perfuaded every good\nman in the faculty, would with heart and hand affift me in fo laudable a purfuit.\nIt was principally with this view, and to affilt private families in the moments of\nextremity, that I was induced to offer thofe fimple modes of cure, and felf- preserva-\ntion, fo amply difpenfed in my edition of Culpeper\u2019s Family Phyfician. And my\nprefent purpofe being to make that invaluable family book ftill more complete, I\nfhall here explain the nature of human generation, and the principles of animal life,\nthat I may from thence deduce the origin of hereditary dileafes, and point out with\nmore facility thofe which are accidental. And in this Treatife I fhall endeavour to\nfurnifh my readers with fuch obvious directions for efchewing the evil,\nand choofing the\ngood,\nthat if refolutely followed, will not fail to preferve health and long life, and\nprove of no fmall benefit to future generations.\nWhen God created Adam, he planted in him the feeds of that Divine Effence,\nrequifite to propagate the human life and foul. Theologifts may contradict me ; yet\nI will not fo much derogate from the wifdom and omnipotence of the Creator, as\nto fuppofe he fhould watch the impregnation of every human female, and by fo\nmany feparate and diftinCt adts of his power, give life, fpirit, and foul to the foetus.\nThe Creator of Man, viewing with unbounded forefight the purpofes before him.\nNo. 19. 4 D by\n\f2X6 A K E Y TO PHYSIC,\nby oneaCt of his omnipotence, blended in Adam all the faculties of the human andce-\nleftial nature ; and, without any doubt, when he was formed one,\nin God\u2019s exprefs\nimage,\nhe pofieffed the means of propagating, from his own efience, beings like\nhimfelf. It is here difficult to affociate the imperfeCt ideas of human reafon with\nthe mechanifm of Divine Wifdom ; and yet our conceptions may in fome degree\nunravel the myfteries of nature by caufes and fpeculations, which, in proportion as\nthey captivate our fenfes, and raifeour admiration, excite in us a reverential awe of\nfuturity, and a grateful fenfibility of the goodnefs and mercy of Him, who gave us\nbeing.\nFrom the evidence of fcripture it is indifputably clear, that in the perfon of Adam\nthe male and female properties were originally combined; as indeed we now find them\nin many fpecies of the lower clafs of animals. In Genefis i. 27, we read, that Cod\ncreated man in his own image,\ni. e. of perfection ; including or containing the prolific\nor generating powers, which are diftinguifhed by the expreffion of male and female ;\nand God blejfed them, i. e. thefemale and female properties, andfaid unto them, Increafe\nand multiply,\nand replenifh the earthy i. e. with beings like Adam ; for this benedic-\ntion, and this command, were antecedent to the formation of Eve, as every one muft\nknow who reads the fcriptures.\nIn this plural capacity, therefore, Adam received the bleffing of God, when he\nfaid unto him, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenifh the earthy and fubdue it ; and\nhave dominion over thefifh of the fea,\nand over thefowls of the air, &c. The fix days\ncreation were now compleated ; and on the feventh day God refted from all his\nwork ;\nand having formed Adam, and breathed into his noftrils the breath of life,\nhe became a living foul. God alfo planted the garden of Eden, and put the man into\nit, to till it, and to drefs it ; and God commanded the man, faying, Of every tree of\nthe garden thou mayeft freely eat\n;\nbut of the tree of the knowledge of good and\nevil, thou fhalt not eat of it ; for in the day that thou eateft thereof, thou \/halt furely\ndie. Gen. ii. 27.\nLet it here be noted, that all thefe tranfaCUons, injunctions, and commands, had\npafied before Eve was formed, or, in other words, before the male and female effen-\nces were feparated and made the efiential parts of two diftinCt perfons. Adam like-\nwife, before this event took place, was appointed God\u2019s viceroy over all earthly\nthings, both animate and inanimate ; the very elements being made fubjeCt to him s\nfor \u201c he wasformed more noble than the angels, and crowned with glory and honour ;\u201d i. e.\nhaving the peculiar advantage of multiplying his own race. He was, as to his external\nform, moulded of theceleftial aether; and therefore, previous to his fall, his body\nemanated rays of brightnefs and fplendour, fimilar to thofe which our ideas furnifh\nof Mofes and Elias when they converfed with God.

For, although brute animals inherit the five fenfes, and pofTefs an inftind\nto direct them in the choice of food, and to impel the propagation of their fpecies ;\nyet thefeare only fenfes formed from the out-birth, or four elements of nature ; and\nnot from the ejfence or tintture of the Divinity, out of which the foul, the mental in-\ntellect, reafon, fenfe, and understanding, are all formed, and transferred to pof-\nterity. \u201c For with the powers God has endued man,\nwith the fame powersJhall he multi-\nply his race.\u201d\nFrom the foregoing paflfages we are warranted to infer, that the original man was\npofleffed of his fpiritual foul, and rational intellect, for the purpofe of propagating\nthe fame to all future generations. By the force of this rational intellect, or eter-\nnal fpirit, unclouded by the deformity of fin, he knew and perceived the nature and\nproperty of every animated being i and to exercife this intellect, God brought be-\nfore him every created thing, to fee what he would call them-, \u201c and whatfoever\nAdam called them,\nthat was the name thereof.\u201d He knew and perceived the nature and\nquality of all animals *, and according to their defignation and fubjeCtion to the ex^\nternal elements, fo he afiigned them thofe names which they have ever fince borne.\nAdam, however, in his primeeval State, was not himfelf under the influence of\nceleStial or terreftrial elements \u2022, but, on the contrary, they were fubjeCt to his con-\ntroul. He was immortal ; they corruptible. They fprung out of Time, and were\nelementated \u2022, he fprung from the limbus of Eternity ; and into eternity the divine\nefience or fouls propagated from him, mult indifputably return.\nBut man, thus created in honour and immortality, abideth not. The purpofe\nof his creation was to fill the place of the rebel angels ; and hence Lucifer became\nhis mortal foe. This fallen Spirit had entered the gate of Eden, and was preparing\nto feduce Adam, when the Almighty conftituted the teSt of his obedience ; for ha-\nving endowed him with afree-will,\nan innate power of choofing good or evil, and of\nmultiplying the fame, it was but reafonable to expeCt from him an implicit obedi-\nence, and an angelic race. He that is alone eternal and omnipotent, could not but\nforefee the fubfequent event \u2022, and it is his Supreme goodneSs to counteract evil, by\npreventing its worSt confequences. Foreseeing that the prolific tinCture, or eternal\neffence of fecundation, might be contaminated by the malignant fpirit of Lucifer,\ninfufing itfelf into the mind of Adam ;\nwho then, inftead of multiplying an ange-\n\u201e lie race, would generate devils \u2022, and that were man to fall in his individual capacity,\nthere was no counterpart, no feminine principle, through the medium of which\nthe\n\f288 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthe ferpent's head could he brutfed.,\nor a Saviour become incarnate. Therefore, on a\nfurther furvey, after the works of creation had been compleated, animals named,\nand man formed and compounded of the male and female tindures, God faid, Gen.\nii. 1 8 . It is not good that the manfoould be alone ; I will make him an help meetfor him ;\nwherefore the rib, i. e. the feminine or conceptive efience, was taken out of Adam,\nand concentrated or moulded into anew being, called woman. The emiflion of this\nfeminine efience or tindure, threw Adam into a deep deep ; yet when he awoke,\nhe knew that an efiential principle had departed from him, and that the woman\nwas bone of his bone,\nandflejh of his flefh, not having been created, butformed out of him-\nfelf whereby he only retained the animating princip!e,or adive power of generation-,\nwhilft the rudiments, or feeds of future beings were configned to the matrix of the\nwoman. Here then individual generation ceafed ; and Adam, without the counter\npart of himfelf,\nhad no longer the power to encreafe and multiply. Thus the two\ntindures, or divine efiences, animating and compounding foul and body, were di-\nvided and by means only of a re-union or contad of thole tindures, could gene-\nration then, or now, be performed. It is on this ground that the male and female\naffedions are continually turned towards each other ; and that the defire of love\nand union fo ftrongly pervades every individual of the human race. Hence alfo the\nTempter\u2019s reafon for beguiling Eve, and hence the feducing power of love, which\ndetermined Adam to fhare in all the horrors of her crime, fo pathetically and affed-\ningly defcribed by Milton.\nThe fatal confequences of the fall, we moll lenfibly feel, and univerfally deplore.\nThe earth fhook from her foundations. The order of nature was quite inverted.\nThe mtherial and terreftrial elements, which before were fafhioned in harmony, and\naded in unifon, were now difcordant, intemperate, and furious. Brute preyed up-\non brute, and bird invaded bird. The delicious fruits and flowers of Paradiie,\nwere exchanged for thorns and thiftles. The ferenity of a pellucid and finding fir-\nmament, was convulfed by the thunders of an incenied Deity, by forked lightnings,\nby contending feafons, by devouring winds, and impetuous ftorms. While man,\nungrateful man, from the privilege of holding thefe elements in fubjedion, became\nfubjeded to them; and hence fubjed to all the perils and misfortunes of his fallen\nnature.\nHere, then, began the conflidof the human pafiions, as violent and ungoverna-\nble as the elements themfelves. Here the toil and labour of the man, who fliould\nearn his bread by thefweat of his brow, and the tears and travail of the woman, who\nfhould conceive in pain andforrow, had each their fource. Here likewife, the dark\ncatalogue of human infirmities, of difeafe, and death, had its too early date ;\nyet\ni to\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nto this sera, which gave birth to our manifold misfortunes, niuft we look for that\nbenign fource of alleviation and cure, which the relenting hand of Providence has\ngracioufly afforded to thofe Who will feck for them ; for out of the ground hath the\nLord caufed medicine to grow ;\nand he that is wife will not defpife them , for with fuch doth\nhe heal men, and taketh away their pains. Eccl. xxxviii. 4, 7.\nSince, by his fall, man became fubjed to the elements, from them he receives\nthe conflitution of his body ;\nbut his reafoning intellect, and lpiritual foul, are de-\nrived from the pure effence or tindure of the Deity, originally infufed into the feed\nof man. To the violence and impurity of the elements, we owe the difordersof the\nbody-, to the temptations and allurements of the devil, we juftly impute the difeafes\nof the foul. Yet by due attention to our reafoning faculty, it is no hard tafk to pre-\nferve health, or prolong life, to the term of its natural diffolution; while, by the\npowers of the mind, and the light of thegofpel, we may ftill avoid the poifon of fin,\nand become members of that eternal kingdom, which is the lure reward of the good\nand virtuous.\nThe imperfedions and difeafes of the body, therefore, beginning with Adam,\nare in confequence tranfmitted to his pofterity y and may be divided into hereditary,\n,and accidental. Hereditary complaints proceed from a certain defed of the animal\npowers, or imperfed (late of the fanguiferous fyftem, at the time of copulation.\nThe accidental, confiftof all fuch maladies as are communicated by the difeordant\nor putrid ftate of the elements, not only during the time the child is encompalTed in\nthe womb, but from its birth, to the lateft hour of its exiftence. And it might her\u00ae\nbe obferved, that the increafe or decreafe of both hereditary and accidental difeafes,\ndepend almoft entirely on the purity, or impurity, of the blood. For if pure, in both\nmale and female, at the time of impregnation, the foetus will be naturally flrong and\nhealthful. So likewife, if after parturition, and during life, care be taken to keep\nthe blood in an uncontaminated and elaftic ftate, welhall not only avoid the common\neffedsof exceflive cold, heat, and moifture-, but avoid likewife that direful train of\nacute difeafes, communicated by putridity and infection y or, fhould they by chance\nattack us, the effed becomes flight and temporary. A circumftance this, which\nfurely ought to weigh perpetually on the minds of thofe, who know how to value the\nbleffing of health, or who would wifh to live a long, an adive, and a pleafant life.\nThis is therefore a fpeculation of that high importance, that I fhall now fhew how\nhereditary complaints are communicated in the ad of copulation\u2014 how increafed and\nfoftered in the womb\u2014how accidental difeafes grow up and follow,-\u2014 and how both\nthefe enemies to the health and happinefs of mankind may be prevented, or overcome.\nIn that union of the fexes to which we are inftindively impelled j\nor rather, in\nthe union of thofe effences or tindures peculiar to the generative organs of male and\nNo. 19. 4E female.\n\f290 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfemale, in the contact of which the firft moments of human exigence commence,\nthe moft whimfical and abfurd theories have been fet up. No branch of phyfiology\nhas been moreexpofed tocenfure and miftake. While the phenomena of the hea-\nvens, of the earth, and even of the human mind itfelf, are traced with a Heady hand,\nand with all the dignity of philofophy, the functions of the human body, in health as\nwell as under difeafe, though expounded with a profufion of fantaftical erudition,\nappear almoft in as much doubt and darknefsas in the days of Paracelfus.\nLet us then proceed to review the mode by which generation is accompliffied. I\nhave, in the former part of this work, already explained the Syftems of Buffon, and\nof Liewenhoek, in their fpeculations on the animalculse found in the feed of man,\nand in that of brute animals \u2022, I have alfo, in the medical part of Culpeper\u2019s Family\nPhyfician, (hewn the mode by which generation is performed, fo far as relates\nto the adtion itfelf, and to its grofs effiedt. I fhall now confider it in a new light, as\nit concerns the propagation of foul and body, and of family-temper, likenefs, and\ndifeafe; but as the female is fo materially concerned in themyfterious adt of impreg-\nnation, and in all its confequences, I fhall here take up the reafoning of a late inge-\nnious anonymous author, whofe opinion exactly coincides with my own.\nThe extremity of the uterine fyftem, without the nymphae, feems not, except\nfrom its aperture, and the lafcivious fufceptibility of its texture, materially requifite\nto generation. Immediately within the nymphae, the vagina, or great canal of the\nuterus, begins. Before coition has difturbed its proportions, it is generally about\nfive or fix inches long ; and when thrown into a circular form, without violent de-\ntention, its diameter is about a fixth part of its length. But as, in coition, the va-\ngina is the immediate receptacle of the penis, it is capable of great diftention, and\nmay be rendered of very confiderable capacity. In general, however, after fre-\nquent contact, this canal becomes much fhorter, but more proportionably increafed\nin its diameter; yet being contrived by its organization for the purpofeof exciting\ntitillation and pleafure, it can and does accommodate itfelf to whatever fize is necef-\nfary clofely to embrace the penis in the adt of copulation.\nAt the upper extremity of this canal, the uterus or womb is feated. It is of a py-\nramidal form, with its apex towards the vagina. Its greateft length, in virgins, is\nnot more than two or three inches ; and its width is fcarcely one ; its internal cavi-\nty muft therefore be very fmall. It is connedted to the vagina or great canal by a\npafiage fo fmall, that a bodkin or flilet cannot be introduced without much difficul-\nty. In the broad or upper extremity of the womb, the ovaria are feated. Their\nfubftance is fpongy, and they contain an indefinite number of vehicles of a dufkiffi\nfemitranfparent quality, the involucra of which are diftindt, and fimilar to the ge-\nneral\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 291\nneral fubftance of the ovaria. Thefe veficles are the ova or eggs, which contain\nthe rudiments of the foetus, and which muft abfolutely be impregnated with the\nmale feed, before it can be poffible for generation to take place.\nNow it has been, and is, the common opinion, that when venereal embraces take\nplace, the whole genital fyftern of the male being thrown into adtion by libidinous\nfire and violent fridtion, by this exertion the femen is thrown with confidera-\nble vehemence from the penis, and is either forced through the mouth of the womb,\nand attracted by the ovaria ; or, that it is received by the Fallopian tubes, and con-\nveyed by them through a variety of convolutions, till by their fimbriae they are\ncondudted to the ovaria, in the manner I have already fully defcribed in the medi-\ncal part of Culpeper\u2019s Family Phyfician ;\nall which tedious and complicated procefs\nis alledged to take place in the inftant of coition.\nOthers again fuppofe, that the internal orifice of the womb becomes open and\npervious, during the exertion and enjoyment of copulation, and that the glands of\nthe penis abfolutely pafs into the cavity of the womb, and ejedt the feed immediately\nupon the ovaria. To each of thefe theories there appears infuperable objedtions.\nIn refutation of the firft, we need only obferve, that the vagina, from its ftrudture,\nand from its organization in the adt of venery, is difpofed ftrongly, and in every\npart, to embrace the penis ; and as the glans muft thereby be clofely lurrounded,\nalthough it reaches not in every perfon to thefurthefl limits of the vagina ; the flight\nand momentary impetus of the femen will thus be very effedtually refifted, if not\ntotally fubdued. If the penis be not of magnitude fufficient to occupy the vagina\nto its full extent, the unoccupied fpace muft be fomehow diftended ;\nand, let this\nvacuum be what it will, its refiftance muft be effedtual ; and if it is not diftended,\nthe power or preffure which occafions its collapfe, will over-balance the impetus of\nthe femen. But fuppofmg the virile member in all cafes to be fo exadtly propor-\ntioned as to occupy the whole length of the uterine canal, which however we know\nis not the cafe \u2022, yet from what principle fhall we afeertain that the feminal tube of\nthe penis, and the apex of the womb, fhall be made fo exadtly to correfpond as to\nbecome continuous ? The femen, in the event of coition, is doubtlefsly thrown out\nbv the penis with fome force \u2022, though this force will always depend upon the vigour\nof the male organs, and therefore muft vary from the loweft to the higheft degree\nof vigour of which thefe organs can be fufceptible. But even allowing the glans\npenis and apex of the womb to fall into exact contadt upon due penetration *, and\nthat the male feed is always ejedted with confiderable force from the penis, and the\nvagina to be no barrier to the progrefs of it ; yet how is it to force its way into the\ncavity of the womb ? The aperture which leads from the vagina or great canal into\n3\n\f292 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthe womb, is in fad! no aperture a,t all. During menftruation, indeed, it is pervi-\nous \u2022, but even then it is only capable of admitting a very fmall probe ; and this is\nno argument that it is naturally, and at other times pervious. How often too has\nthis aperture been entirely blocked up by preternatural obftrudlions, and conception\nneverthelefs taken place? Inftances of this have often occurred ; and the precifion\nand authority with which they are recorded by different practitioners, leave no room\nip evade the argument. .Hence this mode of impregnation appears not only highly\nobjectionable, but utterly impoffible ; having no correfpondence with the human\nflructure, or with the economy of Nature.\nAfter what has been faid, it may appear idle to profecute any farther refutation\nof the progrefs of the male feed by the Fallopian tubes, or through the mouth of\nthe womb. But as authors of the greatefb refpedtability have believed in its pro-\ngrefs through the tubes, and tell us they have even feen it there; it may not be im-\nproper to enquire how far this is afcertainable. The Fallopian tubes, through\nwhich the femen is faid to pafs, originate, by very minute perforations, through the\nfundus of the womb; and encreafing- rapidly in their diameters, their capacities,\n<vhen dilated, may be about the third part of an inch where they approach the ova-\nria. Here, again, they fuddenly contract, leaving only a very final! opening ;\nwhile their main fubftance is Bill continued, and is expanded into that plaited or\njagged fringe called the fimbriae, which is contiguous to the ovaria*. I (hall now\nafk, by what law in Nature, by what effort of it, is the male femen to be condu&ed\nthrough this conical and convoluted canals? Can the femen now poffefs any adtive\nforce, to introduce itfelf through the rigid perforations of this organ, and to over-\ncome the collapfe of the tubes ? The ftimulating power of the femen muff foon be\nloft in a veffel which it has not power to diftend ; and we cannot fuppofe it capable\nof acting in a direction completely oppofite to what is the acknowledged office of\nthe tubes. It muft be by irritability that the ovum is conveyed into the uterus from\nthe ovaria ; and we know no veffels in any part of the body whofe adtion is double\nand contrary,. This fyftem therefore favours of great improbability. But we are\ntold, by fome, that they have adlually feen the male femen in its unaltered ftate,\nlodged in the Fallopian tubes. Thefe fagacious authors might as prudently have\naffirmed, that they had feen fnow upon the canal in Hyde-park at midfummer.\nThey did not know, or did not choofe to recoiled!, becaufe it made againft precon-\nceived opinion, that the human feed, when fubjedted to heat, efpecially to fuch a\nmoift and natural heat as thofe parts conftantly afford, foon lofes its fpiffitude and\n* See Medical part of Culpeper, page 17, 895 97, &c, where all the parts, both male and\nfemale, are anatomically defcribed.\ntenacity.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 293\ntenacity, and becomes very fubtilly fluid, and almoft colourlefs. Befides, it is uni-\nverfally acknowledged, that a conflderable part of the femen is almoft always, im-\nmediately after coition, rejeded by the female. When we attend to the many inftan-\nces of credulity and impofition, in the theories of generation, we need not marvel\nat the aptitude and facility with which pretended difcoveries creep into notice, and\nthe folemnity with which they obtrude themfelves into fyftems.\nAll the foregoing arguments againft the poflibility of a pervious communication\nbetween the vagina and the uterus, are alfo conclufive againft the fuggeftion, that\nthe penis, in the ad of coition, penetrates into the cavity of the womb. Nor is the\naflertion of thofe who contend that this orifice, by the turgidity of the parts during\ncoition, naturally opens and dilates itfelf to receive the male feed, marked with the\nleaftdegreeof probability. How is this dilatation of th\u00ab orifice to be efreded? Tho*\nthe whole uterine fyftem, during the venereal ad, be rendered tliff and turgid by\nanimal defire and influent blood, yet is it more probable that this turgidity would\nrather comprefs than dilate the orifice ; and the ftrudure and texture of the womb\nfeem exceedingly unfavourable tofudden dilatation by any means whatever. In an\nunimpregnated or virgin ftate, the womb is fo fmall that its fides coalefce or adhere\ntogether, and it has no hollow appearance whatever; though from the texture\nand elafticity of its fabric, it may be thrown into a globular form, which will\nconftitute a cavity. But in coition, with all its occult and uncommon phenomena,\nwhat charm have we left to overcome this coalefcence, and form this cavity, by\nopening or feparating the membranous fides of the womb ? Will it here be faid that\nthe forcible ejedion of the male femen will effed this purpofe ; or that the ftiff and\nturgid ftate of the penis itfelf will force its way into a fabric fo remote and delicate ?\nThough females may entertain fanguine ideas of thefe things, we mult fuppofe the\nvigilant anatomift, toiling through the unalarming and chilly organs of the dead,\nought to furnifh a more rational hypothefis, whence to deduce the adive principle\nand admirable procefs of human impregnation.\nAuthors have been always eager to eftablifh the certainty of a conflderable afflux\nof blood to the female organs, and confequent turgidity during the voluptuous com-\nmunication of the fexes ; and this has been a wonderful prop to many abfurd con-\njedures. This afflux, and confequent turgidity, they fuppofe originates, like the\neredion of the penis, from the ftrength of libidinous ideas, and other locally irrita-\nting caufes ; and is intended by nature to induce atenfion in the female organs, that\nthe progrefs of the femen may thereby be facilitated. This tenfion, again, they fup-\npofe induces fome kind of conftridion, which is faid to fupport the adion of the\ndifferent parts of the genital fyftem, but particularly of the Fallopian tubes. Thefe\nNo. 19. 4 F tubes,\nit\n\u2022v*\n\f*94 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ntubes, it is faid, are remarkably diftended, during coition, by the blood ruffling\ninto the numerous veffels which creep between their coats, by which means they are\neredfed, and their fimbriated terminations applied to theovaria^ and it is gravely\nadded, that diftedlions of gravid women, and the comparative anatomy of brutes,\ncorroborate the opinion. Were it not for the ferious refpedt v\/ith which this anato-\nmical obfervation hath for a length of time been favoured, no body furely would be\nat the pains of detedling the abfurdity. Allowing that this turgidity, with all its\nconcomitant circumstances, really happens in the living fubjedt, how can it poffibly\nexift in a carcafe flaccid with death, and, as is always the cafe in a human anatomi-\nzed body, where death muft have taken place fome confiderable time before ?\nBut this turgidity, though it fometimes may happen, and yet in a degree very li-\nmited to what is allcdged, does not always happen ; and when it really does take\nplace, it feems rather to be the companion and promoter of libidinous gratification,\nthan a principal and eflential promoter of conception. To many women the em-\nbraces of the male are extremely, if not completely, indifferent \\ and to fome they\nare abfolutely difagreeable \u2022, yet even thefe women are prolific. There is no difficul-\nty in fuggefting a very fufficient and natural reafon why the parts of the female, di-\nredlly fubjedfed to the adtion of the penis, during the venereal congrefs, Should\nbecome turgid with influent blood, and fometimes be conftridted. Nature, though\nfhe feems in general unfriendly to exceffive luff, fometimes permits it ; and thefe\nare the means fhe feems to have appointed for heightening it. Befldes, it is proper\nthat the animal inffindl, which prompts the reprodudtion of the fpecies, Should not\nbe difappointed in its gratification, however brutal thefe fenfations and ideas may\nappear to the purified philofopher. Thefe means then, however they may contri-\nbute to the mutual fenfibility of the Sexes, in the voluptuous gratification of animal\npleafure, appear to have no real influence on the procefs of generation, after the ve-\nnereal congrefs has ceafed \u2022, nay, we have reafon to believe that their action or influ-\nence does not extend beyond the limits of the vagina, except in common with the\nreft of the general fyftem, even during that congrefs. If an afflux of blood to thefe\nparts were always to be attended with thefe effedts, what violence muft the ovaria\nbe expofed to by reiterated coition, and by every return of themenftrual discharge ?\nDuring the menftrual afflux, a very considerable diftention muft furely take place\nover the greateft part, if not the whole, of the genital fyftem ; and as this turgidity\nis the principal reafon affignedfor the adtion of the tubes, by what means are the\nfimbriae diverted fromexercifing thofe fundtions which turgidity, though from ano-\nther caufe, atanother time fo Successfully inftigates ? Alfo, how happensit that grate-\nful copulation is not always produdtive, and the contrary ; that the fimbriae, in\nevery\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 295\nevery venereal ad, do not operate upon the ovaria, and thereby produce more fce-\ntufes, or a wafte of the ova ? and that the organs themfelves are not incapacitated, or\ndiminilhed in their energy, by fueh repeated exertions ? We have every reafon then\nto conclude, that the terffion and conftridion of the female organs, induced by the\nafflux of blood during coition, if of confequence, are intended folcly to promote\nanimal gratification ; and that they have no dired influence on the adual progrelsof\nthefemen through the above deferibed communications to the ovaria.\nUpon the whole, it is certainly no ways equivocal, that the femen cannot, in any\nmanner, be applied to the ovaria by means of the fimbriae ; that it cannot afeend or\nadvance through the convolutions of the Fallopian tubes ; that it cannot divaricate\nand traverfe the compreffed uterus; and that it cannot even operate a paflage through\nthe rigid bulwark of the cervix uteri. The probability of the progrefs of the aura\nfeminalis,\nthrough the fame paths, is deftroyed by the fame arguments ; and the\nwhimfical opinions founded on the prefence of animalcules in the femen, and on the\norganic bodies furnifhed by the femen of both fexes, and uniting in the uterus, as\nfar as this alledged aperture is concerned, mult hand or fall by the fame fate. It\nmay feem however ftrange, that a dodrine fo ancient, and fo univerfally believed,\nfliould be fo eafily overthrown ; and it may furnifh, to the fpeculative reader, unfa-\nvourable ideas of the prefent {late of medical literature. He may indeed wonder,\nthat though every fcience has become rational and refpedable by the exertions of\ntheir cultivators. Medicine alone has been able to refill the diligence of a thoufand\nyears; although it has been wrefted from the hands of nurfes, and its profefflon be-\ncome dignified and lucrative, it can fcarcely be faid, at this day, to afford one un-\nqueftionable idea. In the volumes of phyfiology, compiled by the molt learned phy-\nficians, and drawn from the molt learned fources, will the unconcerned philofopher\nfind the dogmata of medicine confident with Nature, or with common fenfe ?\nBut fince the femen, in fo me Hiape or other, contains that animating principle\nv\/hich is indifpenfibly neceflary to generation ; and fince the ovaria as indifputably\nproduce fomething from whence a living creature is to be evolved, it becomes de-\nmonltrably clear, that the influence of the male feed mult be powerfully incorpora-\nted with the female, and direded to the ovaria, before this effed can poffibly take\nplace. We have already feen how this cannot happen ; let us now endeavour to\npoint out a rational medium by which it may be accomplilhed. For this purpofe\nv\/e mufl; again return to the vagina, or canal of the uterus, as being the principal\norgan on the part of the female, which adually contributes to propagation ; and\nwithout the full and complete ufe of which, impregnation cannot take place. It\ntherefore demands a very minute and attentive inveftigation,\n3 The\n\f296 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nThe vagina is claftic, and fomewhat membranous, compofed of mufcular fibres\nblood-veflels, nerves, and lymphatics, it commences, from beneath, at the nym-\nphm, and rifing obliquely about five inches, is loll upon the uterus. Its capacity\nis very different in different fubjefts, and in no very diftant periods of life in the\nfame fubjeft. A very refpe&able anatomift finifhes his defcription of it by faying,\nit is \u201c membro virili fecundum omnes dimenfiones accommodabilis.\u201d Its inner membrane\nthough very uneven, is delicately fmooth, and, from its nervous texture, exquifite-\nly fenfible; the outer membrane is more fpongy and mufcular ; and, the whole bo-\ndy of the canal is very plentifully fupplied with blood- vefTels, nerves, and lympha-\ntics. We know little more of the lymphatics of thefe parts, than that they are more\nnumerous proportionally than in any other part of the body. Thofe which origi-\nnate in the exterior parts of the female genital fyftem, traverfe the inguinal glands,\nwhile the deepTeated ones take a much morediredt courfe to their place of union\nwith the lacteals ; but of thefe we fhall be more particular, when we adduce ourob-\nlervations in favour of a very powerful abforption fubfi fling in the vagina.\nThe entrance into the canal of the uterus from without, is guarded, by the\nnymphae, which form an eminence on each fide, fo peculiarly conftrudled and ar-\nranged, that we mud think lightly of the phyfiologift who could fuppofe them to\nbe only appendages in office to the urethra. Indeed, as Nature frequently operates\nmore than one end by a particular ftruftufe, we fhall not pretend to limit the fe-\ncondary or inferior offices which the nymphte may promote \u2022, but we fee much rea-\nson to believe them created to affift powerfully in preventing the fpeedy efcape of the\nmale femen, and thereby expofing it longer to the adtion of the abforbent fyftem.\nA multitude of circumftances corroborate this belief ; and it will not be impaired\nby the allegation, that thefe ridges by no means conflitute a regular and complete\nvalve. Immediately within this barrier, a ftrudture, on the fame principles as thofe\nof the nymphas, but more elegant and powerful, commences; and it is continued\nover the furface of the vagina, gradually growing finer, till it is loft in fmoothnefs\nnear the upper extremity of the canal. This ftrudture is the rugae of the vagina, fo\naccurately drawn and defcribed by Haller and others ; but degraded by fome ana-\ntomifts, who mark it only as ufeful in exciting venereal enjoyment, or admitting\nexpanfion during coition and parturition. It is infinuating a mean and difgraceful\nrefledtion on the- important order and operations of Nature to fuppofe, that thefe\nrugae, which are not cafually arranged; but are regulated with as much precifion\nand uniformity as we can trace in any other part of the general fyftem; I fay it is\nnugatory and prefumptuous to afiert, that this intricate, extenfive, and beautiful\narrangement, has been fo minutely laboured for no other purpofe, but merely to\nexcite\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. \u00bb 97\nexcite a greater titillation during the groisand libidinous commerce of the fexes, and\na greater extenfion during parturition. This ftru&ure may indeed promote thefe\nfecondary purpofes j but it is intended for much nobler ends. Had thefe rugae been\nconftruCted merely for fimple contraction and dilatation, they would have covered\nequally the whole furface of the vagina, which certainly does not happen \u2022, neither,\nif thefe had been their principal ufes, would they be fo foon and fo eafily obliterated.\nWe believe, then, that the i ug^ of the vagina are thus contrived principally to pro-\ntrad: the femen in that vifeus, after the penis is withdrawn, and thereby to favour\nabforption \u2022, efpecially as the qualities of the femen coincide wonderfully with thefe\nintentions.\nThe femen, as it is fecreted from the blood in the tefticles, is very different from\nthat heterogeneous mixture which is expelled by the urethra in coition \u2022, though,\nby the alteration, its fecundating quality is not improved. When it is conveyed\ninto the vehicles it is of a thin confidence, of a pale yellowifh colour, and little in\nquantity. In thefe vehicles it is fomewhat infpiffated, and its colour heightened j\nand after it is mixed with the liquor of the proftrate glands, it becomes ftill thicker,\nand of a more whitifh colour. This confidence which the femen acquires in its-pro-\ngrefs from the tedicles, may produce other flight properties *, but the principal in-\ntention of it feems to be, to correfpond more effectually with the abforbent power of\nthe vagina : for thus, by the increafed tenacity of the femen, the remora of its fe-\ncundating part mud be protracted in the vagina, while at the fame time the abl\u2019or-\nbentsare allowed more time to attach thofe aCtive fubtile parts intended to be carried\ninto the circulating fydem. We may add here, in order farther to confirm the opi-\nnion concerning the ufe of the tenacity of the femen, that when too little of this mu-\ncilage is derived from the glands, or when it is of a depraved or thin quality, the\nwhole mixture efcapes the machinery of the vagina too rapidly, and hence coition\nbecomes unproductive. This is the feminal ferofity, as it is called, held to be one\nof the few caufes of derility in man. And we may add farther, that when the con-\nsent and power of procreation begins to fail on the part of the woman, the crenula-\ntions of the vagina are then always vifibly decayed, whether affeCted by the advan-\nces of age, or by imprudently reiterated venery. But what are we to think of a very\nrefpeCtable author, who gravely tells us, that the femen, by dagnation, and by the\naddition of the cream-like liquor of the prodrate glands, is better fuited to the pro-\njecting effort of the urethra in the event of coition ? Indeed, it is not to be denied,\nthat the increafe in quantity of the feminal mixture may enable the projeCtile power\nof the urethra, with its aiding mufcles, to aft with greater efficacy ;\nbut a boy would\nlaugh in my face were I to tell him, that by adding to the weight and tenacity of wa-\nNo. 19. 4G ter>\n\f298 AKEYTOPHYSIC,\nter, his fquirt would throw it much farther. To aft in concert, then, with thele\nunqueftionable qualities of the femen, the furface of the vagina, by means of its\nrugae, from their elevation and arrangement, mult have a very confiderable effect\nin heightening the remora we have defcribed. No doubt, if Nature had only had\nin view the prevention of the regrefs of the femen, we might have met with a much\nAmpler mechanifm \u2022, but as to this part very different offices, and all of them mate-\nrial, were allotted, it has been intricately qualified for them all. Thus, upon the\nwhole, we fee an admirable difpofition in the femen, and in the furface of the vagi-\nna, to facilitate and promote the aft ion of the ablorbent veffels.\nThough the abforbent fyftem has not been traced with the fame minutenefs and\nfuccefs which have followed the inveffigation of the fanguiferous fyftem, it is howe-\nver known to be very general, and very powerful, and it is remarkably fo in the\ncavity of the pelvis. How, otherwife, is that effufion which is conftantly going on,\nin order to lubricate the whole genital fyftem in the female, and to prevent the coale-\nfcence or concretion of its fides, relumed ? In thofe unfortunate females whofe\nmenfes have taken place, but in whom likewife the expulfion of which has\nbeen prevented by the unruptured hymen, or by unnatural membranes blocking up\nthe paflage, much of the blood has always been reforbed ; and in thofe whofe difeafe\nhas exifted long, and where the thick parts of the blood have begun to be broken\ndown, thecolluvies has been reforbed, and a train of fymptoms induced, not to be\naccounted for by the mere turgidity which this obftrudtion occafioned. The infec-\ntion and progrefs of fyp\u2019nilis, or confirmed lues, not only eftablifh the certainty of\na very rapid and powerful abforption in the vagina j but alfo exhibit the power and\nInfluence of the irregularities of its furface. It is lurely very evident, that the chief\napplication of the venereal virus, whether in gonnorrhoea or fyphilis, but efpecially\nin gonnorrhcea, muft be near the farther extremity of the vagina, though there can\nbe no doubt but the ulcerated glans may often affedt the exterior parts by its intro-\ndudtion \u2022, but in a confirmed lues, the fundus of the vagina is rarely the feat of ulcer,\nand it is never affedted in gonorrhoea. Here the furface of the vagina being moftly\nfmooth, the poifon runs downwards, till falling upon the rugse, it is there intercept-\ned and retarded. Here then the poifon is multiplied, and leifurely applied to the\nmouths of the lymphatics, through which it is carried into the blood ; where, afli-\nmilating together, it contaminates the whole mafs. Though the progrefs of the fy-\nphilitic poifon is not always thus regular, the variations do not not aftedt the opi-\nnion. When the lymphatics, and their glands, are vigorous and eafily permeable ;\nwhen the application of the venereal virus is within the nymphse ;\nand when it is\nfufficiently active, th\u00ab firft fymptoms of difeafe arife from general contamination ;\nand\n\f259\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nand was this poifon always very mild, and taken up by the abforbents within the\nnymphte, there is no doubt but the whole mafs would almoft always be difeafed,\nwithout much chance of ulcer or preceding bubo. But there are many circumftan-\nces which tend to retard the fpeedy abforpdon of the fyphilitic virus, even when it\nis extremely aftive ;\nand, among thefe, the inflammation which in general it muft\ninduce, is not perhaps the leaft conflderable ; but thefe cannot aflfeCt the abforption\nof the feminal fluid of the male. The fyphilitic virus too, may, from the laxity and\nlubricity of the vagina, (a circumftance very general in immodeft women,) not only\nefcape abforption, but may be carried outwards, to exercife its energy on the exter-\nnal parts. And it is from thefe reafons partly, that immodeft women are fo little\ndifpofed to conception, and that modeft women, when fubjeCted to venereal infec-\ntion, generally experience the more latent and violent fpecies of this difeafe. And\nas a greater furface of abforbents is expofed in the f emale to the contaminating influ-\nence of the difealed male organs, and as the greateft part of the female genital fy-\nftem have a much readier intercourfe with the blood than through the inguinal\nglands, we meet with this fpecies of fyphilis much oftener in women than in men.\nThe cure of fyphilis, too, by fpecific remedies introduced into the vagina, fully de-\nmonftrates the ftrength and activity of the lymphatics in this canal. Is there then\na ready and eftablifhed communication, for difeafe, and for its remedies, between\nthe vagina and the general circulating fyftem of the blood, while a mild fluid, yet\npofleffed of activity infinitely beyond that of any poifon, and created for the higheft\nand belt of purpoles, is not permitted to traverle the fame channels ? Many other\ncorroborating circumftances, both in faCt and in analogy, might be adduced here,\nwere not thefe arguments in themfelves concluflve.\nInadueftate of health there is what may be called an inteftine motion in the blood,\noccafioning and promoting its commixture, as well as its feparation. In all gene-\nral difeafes, and even in many which are called local, this inteftine motion is heigh-\ntened, diminiflied, or deranged ; and in the exanthematous or eruptive diforders,\n'\nit muft be remarkably fo. In fyphilis, though this difeafe is not direCtly exanthema-\ntous, there muft beexceffi ve difturbance, and certain depravation prevailing through-\nout the whole fyftem, before fuch complete deftruCtion can be brought upon it.\nIn thefe cafes of difeafe-\u2014 where vehement infection, with all its confequences, is\noverturning all before it, we have always found, that milder infections could make\nno impreflion. Hence the practitioner never hefltates to ingraft the fmall-pox,\nthough the patient may have already received the difeafe, either by natural conta-\ngion, or by prior inoculation : hence a milder difeafe is often removed by a feverer\none; hence flow confumption is always retarded, and often overcome, by fecunda-\n3 tion\n;\n<\n\f3C0 A K E Y T O P H Y S I C,\ntion ;\nand hence fecundation itfelf, as the feebler ftirnulus, is often prevented by\nthe anticipating difturbance of fyphilis, or of fimilar difeafes vehemently pre-occu-\npying the circulating fyftem. It is this anticipation, this prior poffeffion, and change\nin the circulating blood, which reafonably and emphatically accounts for the want\nof influence in the human femen upon the female after impregnation has fully taken\nplace, or while the mother is providing milk. And we might account for the pro-\nduction of twins, triplets, and thofe rareinftances of more numerous progeny, from\nthe fame circumftances. One, two, or more ova may indeed be fo ripe as to meet\ncompletely the fecundating impulfe of the male femen at one time ; and it is perhaps\nmore flrangethat the different fcetufes fhould be maturated and expelled about the\nfame time, than if a greater period intervened between the expulfion of each ; and\nmight not a fecond intercourfe of the fexes be fuccefsful, when the female circula-\nting mafs was not fully pre-occupied by the influence of the firft ? But the extent\nand influence of prior infebtion, or impregnation of the blood, has been better ob-\nferved in the venereal, than in any other difeafe, or natural occurrence. Women\nwhofe general fyftem is vitiated by the fyphilitic virus, are always incapable of con-\nception \u2022, or if the vitiation is not complete, but in a flight degree, an imperfebt\nfecundation may take place *, but its produbt determines the want of energy, and\nthe unqualified ftate of the mother from whence it drew its principal arrangement.\nThefe ideas are corroborated by the mode of cure adopted in the circumftances we\nhave been defcribing, and by the general effebts of it.\nThus we have endeavoured, and we hope with fuccefs, to eftablifh the truth of a\nftrong power of abforption in the genital fyftem of the female, originating in the va-\ngina ; and a difpofition in the whole mafs of blood, to be affebted according to the\nproperties of what may be mingled with it. And as, from the prefent ftate of ana-\ntomical knowledge, we have no right to fufpebt any other mode than this of abforp-\ntion, by which the unrejebted and finer parts of the femen can in any fhape, and with\nany effebt, be determined towards the ovaria, let us fee how this can be farther af-\ncertained by what we may fuppofe to be the effebb of the abforbed femen, and the\nfuture appearances of impregnation.\nIn human creatures the evolution of all their parts is gradual, and the work of\ntime. From the moment in which the ovarian nucleus receives the vivifying im-\npulfe from the femen, till the period of puberty ; from the dawn of its exiftence, to\nthe completion of its figure and its powers*, its alterations are fo many, and fo vari-\ned, that our idea of the germ is not recognifable in that of the infant, and our idea\nof the infant again is loft in that of the perfebt animal. A gelatinous particle,\nwithout neceffary form and texture, becomes a ftupendous fabric, fo intricate and\nelaborate, though at the fame time perfebt and complete, that human ingenuity\nand\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3\u00b0l\nand reafon have toiled almoft fruitlefsly for thoufands of years in inveftigating the\nprogrefs. It has indeed been averred by feme, that all the different organs of the\nanimal in its complete ftate are original and diftinCt in the embryo, and are only\nunfolded and rendered more evident by its increafe. This furely is not the cafe.\nThe animal is certainly endowed with power of completing itfelf; and can, from\ninorganized parts, produce an organized ftrufture. The parts are only evolved\nand perfected as they become ufeful in the different ftages ; and the evolution of\nmany of them can be prevented without the deftruCtion of life, or exceffive preju-\ndice to thofe already evolved. If the different organs, or rather principles, are at\nfirft perfeCt, why are thofe effcCts which depend upon them not perfed alfo ? Why\nis the ftate of infancy a ftate of idiotifm ? why is the temper of youth capricious\nand flexible ? and why are the temper and pafiions of the adult but barely difeerni-\nble in the preceding ftages ?\nAs we are of opinion then, that the different organs are matured only as they be-\ncome requifite and neceffary \u2022, confequently, we believe the evolution of the gene-\nrative organs in both fexes muft be among thelaft efforts of the increafe and com-\npletion of the body. This evolution could not have taken place earlier. If it had,\nthe mind muff have been affeded by thefe impulfes which announce the maturation\nof thefe organs, by which we know the mind, body, and foul, are conneded. In\nthe male, the foundation and powers of maturation, of that ftrength, and of thofe\nmore rational qualities which belong to him, are laid to ripen with puberty : hence\ncommunication with the female, before thefe are finally arranged and fecured,\nproves inefficient, and entails upon him debility both of body and mind. The fame\nthing holds, as far as the fame ends are concerned, with refped to the female-, and\nwe cannot fuppofe that Nature could be fo idly eccentric, as to punifh the female\nwith a difpofition or propenfity to procreate, before the body was capable of under-\ngoing the various dilorders and dangers of pregnancy and parturition. For the fame\nreafons, none of the ordinary organs of fenfe are qualified to receive or communi-\ncate diftinCt impreffions, till the brain, the feat of the foul, as the heart is of life,\nhas acquired thofe properties which muft fit it for its arduous offices. It is only\nwhen the different organs of fenfe have been completely evolved, and all their parts\nfound and juft, that the power of the mind is effectuated and eftablifhed. This fa-\nculty, though it feems effentially different from Reafon, is no doubt the origin of\nit ; for the extenfion of common fenfe, from memory, or rather from comparifon,\nand what may be called the balance of thefenfes, conftitutes what is called Reafon\nand Judgment. While the organs are incomplete, from infancy, or from difeafe,\ntheir communication with the underftanding is alfo incomplete. Thofe who have\nbeen born blind, or whofe eyes have been deftroyed in infancy, before they were\nNo. 20. 4 H become\n\f302 A K E Y T O P H Y S I C,\nbecome ufeful, have none of thofe ideas which depend upon the eye ; it is the fame\nwith the deaf, and in all cafes of ideas depending upon one fenfe : and we may add,\nthe early caftrated have no comprehenfion of, or propenfity to, the gratifications of\nlove. Do not thefe things fhow--and a thoufand other circumftances might be ad-\nduced to ftrengthen the proof\u2014-that the mind acquires its powers only as the parts\nof the body are unfolded, and confirmed ; that the body is perfeded only as the\nmind is qualified to receive its impreflions ; and that the parts of the body are per-\nfeded by one another ?\nDuring infancy and youth, ftridly, the ovaria are fimple inorganic maffes, par-\ntaking of no more life than is barely fufficient to fuftain them, and conned them\nwith that energy and progrefs of conftitution which are afterwardito unfold all their\nproperties. At the period of puberty, thus denominated from the change which\ntakes place in the genital fyftem at this time of life, this progrefs and developement\nof the ovaria is finifhed by Nature; and thefe bodies are generated, and completed\nwithin them, which will exift without impregnation by the male, but which this\nimpregnation alone can finally maturate and evolve. That thefe bodies arp not ge-\nnerated at an earlier date, Anatomy as well as Reafon, founded on the foregoing\narguments, affure us ; and, that the ova of all the foetufes, which the female is\nafterwards to produce, are generated at that time, feems equally certain. Though\nthis change in the ovaria is the mod effential, the whole genital fyftem alfo under-\ngoes a very material change. The fimple alterations of ftrudure and dimenfions in\nthe different parts of this fyftem, though they are neceffary and fubfervient to gene-\nration and parturition, yet they are not fo material, either in themlelves, or to our\npurpofe, as to require a minute delcription. This, however, is not the cafe with\nrefpeft to the menfes. It is chiefly with a view to the nutrition of the foetus that\nthis extra-fanguification in the female is provided by Nature; which is determined\nto the genital fyftem, in the fame manner as the other fluids are determined to other\noutlets ; but as the continued drilling off of this extra blood would be exceedingly\ninconvenient and difgufting. Nature has prepared, as it were, a ciftern for its re-\nception. What may be fufficient to bring on the haemorrhage, however, is only\naccumulated ; and the general redundancy, induced by the obftru&ion and accu-\nrhulation, fubfides gradually as the haemorrhage goes on. This is the manner of\nmenftruation in the unimpregnated female, and thefe are the reafonswhy itaffumes\na periodical form. Jn the impregnated female again, the preparation of extra blood\nftill continues, but its confumption becomes very different. By theextenfion of the\nuterus, and by thewafte occafroned by the nourifhment of the foetus and its involu-\ncra, the furcharge, or extra preparation of blood is nearly balanced, or is taken up\nas it is prepared ; and hence the periodical efforts are almoft loft. In the firft months\nof\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3\u00b0j\nm pregnancy, however, the uterine fyftem is not always able to confume the lur-\ncharge of blood, and thereby take off the periodical effort ; and hence it is that the\nlofs of the foetus happens molt generally in the early months, and at the ufual pe-\nriod of the menfes, unlefs fome accident has fupervened. And it is nearly from the\nlame reafons that mifcarriage is fo often to be apprehended in the latter months\nof pregnancy, and that the foetus is afterwards expelled from the womb. When the\nfoetus has acquired all that bulk and ftrength which the capacity and powers of the\nuterus can confer \u2022, and when a change of circulation and mode of life becomes ne-\nceffary to it, the uterus and foetus become plethoric \u2022, a general accumulation fuc-\nceeds \u2022, and the periodical efforts of the menfes return. During the middle months\nof pregnancy the foetus is in a ftate of rapid growth, and is capable of confirming all\nthe blood which the mother can furnifh \u2022, but there is neither room nor waite, in\nthe latter months, for the blood which the mother is conflantly pouring in ; and\nhence arifes that plethora, both in mother and child, which is to inftigate the effort\nto parturition, which occafions the effufion after parturition, and which is to fupply\nthe extended circulation of the born child.\nButbefides the utility of menffruation to the foetus, there is a very evident con-\nnection between it and impregnation. To fpeak of it as a proof of the ripened qua-\nlifications of the female, is to fay nothing-, its immediate aCtion iseffential to con-\nception. In the human female, it is well known, that coition is almoft only fuccefs-\nful immediately after this evacuation has fubfided. Who will reconcile this\u2014 and\nit is no modern and groundleis obfervation---to the confequence which has been\nafcribed to turgidity and tenfion, which we have already adverted to ? Almoft every\nwoman who has frequently undergone pregnancy, and who has attendedjudicioufly\nto the phaenomena of that fituation, calculates from the laft ceffation of the menfes.\nAt this time, or rather very foon after it, the plethoric tumult of the general lyftem\nis completely fubfided, and theabforbed femen gets quiet and unanticipated poffef-\nfion of the circulating blood ;\nand at the fame time the gradually returning plethora\npromotes its aClion, and perhaps its determination to the ovaria. When the menfes\nare interrupted, or profufe and frequent, impregnation feldom takes place; and it\nadmits not of a doubt, that when the determination of this blood is towards the\nmammae, in the form of milk, coition is unfuccefsful ; and as foon as its determina-\ntion to the uterine fyftem is reftored, other things being favourable, copulation fuc-\nceeds. We may add as a known fadt, that continuing to give fuck after the ufual\nperiod, will occupy the plethora, and prevent its determination, in the form of\nblood, to the uterine fyftem. It is an additional reproach to the groffnefs of human\nnature, that this practice hath too often been put in execution, in order to obviate\nconception. Sometimes there is reafon to believe, that conception has taken place\nwhile\nt %\n\/\n\f3\u00b04 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nwhile the plethoric determination to the breads continued. I am rather difpofed to\nbelieve, that in fuch. cafes its return to the uterine fydem was recommenced-, for\nabout the fame time the milk generally lofes its alimentary qualities, and gradually\ndwindles away.\nBut we have faid enough to defcribe and fubdantiate thofe parts of the female,\nwhich puberty has prepared for generation. We (hall now confider its effedts on the\nmale. It need not be repeated, that the feminal fluid is an exceedingly penetrating\nand adtive fluid. Its effedts, after it is generated, even upon the male, demon-\ndrate its adlivicy and influence, far beyond the precincts wherein we believe it to be\naccumulated. After puberty, the lecretion of it, during even indifferent health,\nis continually going on \u2022, and thofe colledtions of it in its refervoirs, which are not\nthrown out by venereal exercife, or by other means lefs decent, are reforbed and\nmingled with the general mafs. What is adtually reforbed about the period of pu-\nberty before the fydem has been habituated to it, or faturated with it, produces very\ncurious and remarkable effedts over the whole body. The flrfh and lkin, from be-\ning tender, delicate, and irritable, become coarfe and firm \u2022, the body in general\nlofes its fucculency ; and a new exidence feems to take place. The voice, a proof\nof the tenfion and rigidity of the mufcular fibre, lofing its tendernefs and inequali-\nties, becomes ungratefully harfh \u2022, and the mind itfelf, adluated by the progreis of\nthe body, and forgetting all its former inclinations and attachments, acquires dif-\ntindlly new propenflties and pafiions. Thefe changes are not entirely the effedt of\nordinarily progrefhve age and drength \u2022, neither are they promoted by intercourfe\nwith the world *, for cadration will anticipate them, and premature venery, or even\ngradual familiarity, and early onanifm, will dimini fh them. Boys who have been\nfubjedted to cadration, never acquire either that drength of body or capacity of\nmind which dignifies the complete male \u2022, and the fame cruel and unnatural opera-\ntion performed on brute animals, diminifhes their bodily drength, their courage,\nand liberty, and the fiercenefs of their temper.\nIf fuch are the effedts of the feminal fluid when reforbed by the male, how pow-\nerful mud it be when fuddenly mingled, and mod probably in greater quantity,\nwith the circulating fluids of the attradting female ! Coition, or rather the abforp-\ntion of the feminal fluid of the male by the female, even when not fucceeded by im-\npregnation, induces an alteration very general over the female fydem. The lo-\ncal influence of which may be inferred from the general change which it is capable\nof inducing during complete health ; from the relief which it effedtuates in many\nfpecies of difeafe ; and from the general vivacity and cheerfulnefs diffufed over the\nwhole animal frame. It would be prolix to go over every difeafe which will warrant\nthefe opimonSl yet in the eye of common obfervation. the fallow and inanimate\n^ female,\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3\u00b05\nfemale, by coition, often becomes plump and robuft, and beautiful and adlive,\nwhile the widow, or married woman, deprived of commerce with her hufband,\ngradually returns to the imperfedtions and peculiarities of fmgle life ; and that the\nantient virgin, all her life deprived of this animating effluvia, is generally confumed\nwith infirmity, ill temper, or difeafe. It is well known, too, that the want of coi-\ntion at the time of life when Nature leems to require it induces many diforders in\nfemales-, and that the ule of it removes thefe, and even other difeafes. Chlorofi3\nor the whites almoft always attack females immediately after puberty ; and, even\nwhen the violence of its fymptoms have not been difcerned till a later period, its\norigin can always be traced back to that time. When the human fyftem is com-\npletely evolved, and all its parts have acquired their full growth, a balance is pro-\nduced between the circulating and folid fyfterris ; though, from the ideas we have\nfuggefted concerning the menfes, this balance in the female cannot ftridtly be called\ncomplete. It is only complete in her when in perfect health, and in an impregna-\nted ftate; at other times, the catamenia, as preponderating againft the powers of\nthe folid fyftem, in proportion to the degree of their period, difturb the equilibrium,\nand thereby more or lefs induce a ftate inconfiftent with perfedt health. But when\nthe propelling power of growth has ceafed before the folids, either from actual dif-\neafe, or want of uniformity in either period, or acceffion with refpedt to the progrefs\nof the circulating lyftem, have acquired their proper vigour and tone, and when\nthe catamenia has affirmed its deftination, before it is accompanied by the general as\nwell as local energy which is requifite to expel it, anuniverfal want of balance comes\non ; the blood lofes its ftimulating influence on the vitiated folids, and thefe, in\ntheir turn, adt feebly on the diftempered blood. Accordingly, in the cure of this\ndifeafe, no matter whether adopted from particular theories or from experience,\nmedicines are directed to reftore vigour to the folids, and confidence and ftimulus\nto the circulating mafs. Nature proceeds in the fame manner \u2022, and the beneficial\neffedts of coition in the cure of this difeafe have been too material to efcape obferva-\ntion. It may be alleged, that thefe effedts depend entirely upon local influence ;\nand that even voluptuous gratification, by quieting the turbulence of pafflon, is of\nconfequence in the cure. We fhall not fay that thefe things are unavailing ;\nfor it\nappears that the relief obtained is chiefly owing to the increafed inteftine motion,\nand confequent ftimulus, communicated to the blood by the abforbed femen, where-\nby the folids themfelves are ultimately reftored \u2022, and we are the more confirmed in\nthis opinion, becaufe all thefe fortunate effedts attend, whether coition be fucceeded\nby impregnation or not. Hyfterics, and other difeafes, would furnifh us with fimi-\nlar explanations and fimilar cures.\nNo. 20. 4 I Let\n\f30(5 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nLet us now advance a little nearer our objeCt. [t is beyond a doubt, that, in what-\never manner the femen afts upon the female, it does not aCt fuddenly, notwithftand-\ning the general affertions of many authors. However productive coition may be,\nthe fecundated produCt of the ovaria is not immediately difengaged. We dare not\navouch this faCt from obfervations made on the human fubjeCt, becaufe fuch obfer-\nvations never have been attempted, nor ever can with the fmalleft probability of\nfuccefs : but the dififeCtion of brutes, by the moft eminent anatomifts, with a direCt\nview to the elucidation of this fadt, afcertains it as far as fuch evidence can be ad-\nmitted. In the difiedtion of fmall animals by De Graaff, he found no difcernible\nalteration in the uterus during the firft forty hours after coition, but a gradual\nchange was perceivable in the ovaria ; and what he fuppofed the ripened origin of\nthe future animal, at the end of that time, iofing its tranfparency, became opaque\nand ruddy. After that time, the fimbriae were found clofely applied to the ovaria\n;\nthe cavities from whence the ova had been expreffed were difcernible *, and about\nthe third day the ova weredifcovered in the uterus. In large animals, and in thofe\nwhofe time of uterine geftation was longer, it was found that theprogrefs which we\nhave been defcribing was proportionally flower. The fame experiments have been\nmade by different anatomifts, and perhaps with very different views ; and, though\nthey have not always been managed with the fame judgment and dexterity, yet all\nof them more or lefs confirm the idea that there is a very confiderable lapfe of time\nintervening between productive copulation and the expulfion of the ovum from\nthe ovaria. But if this is the cafe with animals which foon arrive at puberty, and\nwhich, like human creatures, copulate not perfectly before puberty, ---whofe lives\narefhort, and progrefs in equal periods of time more rapid than thofe in man,\u2014 by\nparity of reafon, it mull happen, that in women the period between impregnation\nand the expulfion of the fecundated prnduCt of the ovaria muft be confiderably\ngreater than what has been obferved to take place in thefe animals. If all this is\ntrue\u2014 -how are we to fuppofe Nature to be employed during this interval ? We be-\nlieve it is during this period that the wh >le female conftitution is labouring under the\nfecundating influence of the feminal fluid taken into the blood by the abforbent\n;\nwhile the ovaria are largely participating, and their produCt ripening, by means of\nthe general ftimulating procefs.

To qualify the ovaria\nfor this, they are fupplied with a congeries of blood-veflels and nerves, at puberty\nlarger and more numerous than what is allotted to any other part of fimilar magni-\ntude. Were the ovaria merely a receptacle for the ova, which the venereal orgafm,\ncommunicated by the nerves, or by the impulfion of the applied femen, was to la-\ncerate*, what ufe would there be for fo intricate and extenfive an arrangement of\nblood-veflels and nerves ? But we may farther remark, that every didindl procefs\nin the human body, either during health or difeafe, tends to one particular and dif-\ntinft purpofe.

We know none of the operations in the human body, dedined for the or-\ndinary purpofes of life and health, or for the removal of difeafe, but in a greater or\nlefs degree involve the machinery of the whole fydem.

The evident means are fufficiently degra-\nded \u2022, we need not exert our ingenuity to degrade them farther.\nIt is during this interval, between productive coition and the exclufion of the\novum from the ovaria, that likenefs, hereditary difeafes, and the like, are commu-\nnicated and acquired. Inftead of that influence which the imagination of the mo-\nther is fuppofed to poflefs over the form of the child, might we not fufpeCt, that the\nfeminal fluid of the male, co-operating, during this interval, with the influence of\nthe female upon the ovum, inftigated a likenefs, according to the influence of the\nmale and female tin&ures, in the united principles ? It is during this period only\nthat the difeafes of the male can be communicated to the child ; and, if we admit\nnot of this interval and general operation of the feminal fluid, we cannot fee how\nthey can be communicated, though thofe of the mother may be communicated then\nor at a much later period, confidering how the child is nourifhed while it is in the\nuterus and at the breaft. It may be urged againft this early and effectual acquifi-\ntion of likenefs, that the foetus does not acquire even the divifion of its largeft mem-\nbers till long after its exclufion from the ovaria : but then we are confident, that,\nas the foetus takes all its form and other properties from the aCtive fubtilty of thefe\nblended tinCtures, we cannot fee any reafon why it fhould not poflefs this hereditary\nfaculty, in common with the reft. If likenefs depend upon the imagination of\nthe female, how happens it that the children of thofe whofe profligate manners ren-\nder the father uncertain, and whofe affeCtions ceafe with the inftant of libidinous\ngratification, are as frequently diftinguifhable by their likenefs as thofe children\nwho have been born under none of thele misfortunes ? If the features are not plan-\nted during this period, and if imagination be not idle or ufelefs, how was the fix-\nfingered family, mentioned by Maupertuis, continued ? When a female of that fa-\nmily married a man who had only the ul'ual number of fingers, the deformity of her\nfamily became uncertain, or ceafed; and we muft fuppofe her imagination could\nnot have been inactive or diminifhed, whether alarmed by the fear of continuing a\ndeformed race, or inftigated by the vanity of tranfmitting fo remarkable a peculia-\nrity. Was imagination, in a pregnant woman, fo powerful as many have endea-\nvoured to reprefent it, the mother, profligate at heart, though not actually wicked,\nwould always betray the apoftafy of her affeCtions ; and even a virtuous woman\nmight divulge that fhe had looked with as much eagernefs at a handfome ftranger\nas fhe had looked at the aquiline nofe or other prominent feature of her hufband.\nBut\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3G9\nBut admitting that the feminal fluid of every male pofleffes fome kind of influence\npeculiar to that male, andconneCted with his form, as well as his conftitution \u2022, in\nthe fame, or in fome Similar manner, it contains, notwithftanding the elaboratenefs\nof its preparation, theftamina ofdifeafes, fome of which often lie longer dormant\nthan even the features of individuals \u2022, that the ova are as peculiarly constructed,\nby the conftitution of the female, as any other parts which depend upon gradual\nand folitary evolution ;\nand that thefe, operating upon each other by the interven-\ntion of the general fyftem of the female, may, according to the power or prevalence\nof either, affeCt the features and figure of the incipient animal, or rather the inorga-\nnized mafs from which the features and figure of the animal are afterwards to be\nevolved : admitting all thefe things, will national, or even more extenfive fimilitude\ncorroborate the opinion ?\nWhile men continue in the fame climate, and even in the fame diftriCt, an uni-\nform peculiarity of features and figure prevails among them, little affeCted by all\nthofe changes which improve or degrade the mind ; but when they migrate, or when\nthey are corrupted by the migration of others, this national diftinction in time is loft,\nthough in the latter cafe it feems to be recoverable, unleis the caul'e of change be\ncontinued. The beautiful form and features of the ancient Greeks are at this day\ndifcernible in their defendants, though they are debafed by intercourfe with ftran-\ngers, and by forms of government ultimately affeCtmg their constitutions ; the de-\nfendants of the few who by chance or defign have been obliged to fettle among the\nugly tribes in the extremities of the North, have, by their intercourfe with thefe\ntribes, and by necefi^rily accommodating themfelves to the fame modes of life, be-\nfides other circumftances, become equally ugly ;\nand the Jew himfelf, though he\nabhors to mingle with a different nation, and though his mode of life is nearly the\nfame in all climates, yet the fettlement of his anceftors in any one particular climate\nfor fome centuries, will very fenfibly impair the characteristic features of his people.\nAs equally in point, and lei\u2019s liable to queftion, we may mention the following Simi-\nlar obfervations.

That after\ncirculating through the blood, it is by its natural impulfe, and the additional fti-\nmulus acquired from the mother, forced through the correfponding veflels into the\novaria \u2022,\nwhere, if it finds one or more of the ova in a ftate fit or ripe for impregna-\ntion, conception takes place accordingly ;\nand either one, or more are impregnated,\nas the maturated ftate of the ovaria might happen to be. But if none of the ova or\neggs are in a ftate fufficiently mature, or chance to be injured by any offending hu-\nmours, by debility, or difeafe, in either of thefe cafes impregnation is fruftrated, juft\nthe fame as happens to an addled egg, or to a damaged grain of corn thrown into the\nearth.\nOn the other hand, if the male organ be deficient in vigour, or the femen be defec-\ntive in quantity, confiftency, or active powers, it then fails of ftimulating the female\nfluid, and is incapable of influencing impregnation. In order therefore that the aCt\nof copulation fliould be productive, the male muft unqueftiopably convey to the\nfemale an elaborate TinCture, which poflefles the efiences of his whole fyftem, as\nwell mental, as corporeal. In this aCt, the utmoft energy and powers of the\nmind, of the body, and of the foul, are intimately connected ; and all contribute\ntheir particular influence to the feed ; of which every father muft befenfible, when\nhe recolledts the aCtion of the Heart, the feat of life\u2014 of the Brain, the feat of the\nfoul\u2014and of the whole powers of the Body, concentrated and impelled, as it were,\nthrough the genital fy ftem.

For from the blood and\nbrain is the male feed primarily elaborated, and into the female mafs is this thrown\nand aflimilated, before impregnation can poffibly take place. In the courfe of fix\ndays, I conclude the united tindlures to have travelled through the whole circula-\nting fydem---to have participated of the hereditary forms and peculiarities of the mo-\nther, and to have propelled the ovum or egg from its feat in the ovaria to a fufpend-\ned fituation in the womb, hanging by a minute thread, that afterwards becomes the\numbilical veflfel, or aperture through which nourilhment and life is conveyed from\nthe mother to the child. This firft vifible date of conception, which refembles the\nlucid appearance of a drop of water, tending to coagulation, is corredtly fhewn in\nthe firft figure of the annexed plate, precifely in the date it was extracted from the\nuterus of a female, who died on the fixth day after contad with the male, and is\nnow to be fee n, preferved in fpirits, in Rackdrow\u2019s valuable Mufeum, in Fleet -\ndreet, London.\nAt the time theovum, or rudiments of theembryo, defcends into the womb, it is in-\ndeed very minute ; but at the end of about thirty days, we may partly difcover the\nfird lineaments of the foetus, though fmall and imperfed, being then only about the\nfizeof a houfe fly. Two little vefficles appear in an almod tranfparent jelly \u2022\nthe\nlarged of which is intended to become the head of the foetus, and the other fmaller\none is dedined for the trunk \u2022, but neither the limbs nor extremities are yet to befeen;\nthe umbilical cord appears only as a minute thread, and the placenta, which only\nrefembles a cloud above, has no ramifications, or appearances of blood-veflels.\nThis date of the embryo is exprefied in the fecond figure of the annexed plate.\nTowards the end of the fecond month, the foetus is upward of an inch in length,\nand the features of the face begin to be evolved. The nofe appears like a fmall pro-\nminent line \u2022, and we are able to difcover another line under it, which is dedined for\nthe reparation of the lips. Two black points appear in the place of eyes, and two\nminute holes mark the formation of the ears. At the fides of the trunk, both above\nand below, we fee four minute protuberances, which are the rudiments of the arms\nand legs. The veins of the placenta are alfo now partly vifible ; as may be feen in\nNo. 3. of the annexed plate.\n3 In\n\fA KEY TO PHYSI C,\nIn the third month the human form may be decidedly afcertained ; all the parts\nof the face can be diftingnifhed ; the fhape of the body is clearly marked out ; the\nhaunches and the abdomen are elevated, and the hands and feet are plainly to be\ndiftinguifhed. The upper extremities are obferved to encreafe fader than the lower\nones ; and the feparation of the fingers may be perceived before that of the toes.\nThe veins of the placenta are now di (fended, and are feen to communicate with the\numbilical tube. This date of geftanon is faithfully delineated in No. 4. of the\nannexed engraving.\nIn the fourth month the foetus feems to be compleated in all its parts, and is about\nfour inches in magnitude. The fingers and toes, which at firft coalefced, are now\nfeparated from each other, and the intedines appear, in all their windings and con-\nvolutions, like little threads. The veins of the placenta begin to be filled with\nblood, and the umbilical cord is confiderably enlarged ; as may be feen in the fifth\nfigure of the fubjoined plate.\nIn the fifth month, the bodily conformation being perfected in all its parts, and\na complete circulation of the blood induced ; the mother quickens. The foetus now\naflumes a more upright figure, which correfponds with the fhape of the uterus. Its\nhead is found more elevated, its lower extremities are more diffended, its knees are\ndrawn upwards, with its arms reding upon them. It now meafures from feven to\neight inchesin length, and is defcribed in the fird figureof thefecond fubjoined plate.\nTowards the end of the fixth month, the foetus begins to vary its pofition in the\nwomb, and will frequently be found to incline either to the right or to the left fide\nof the mother. It will by this time be increafed to nine or ten inches ; and its ufual\npodure, after quickening, may be feen in the fecond figure of t\\\\tfecond annexed plate.\nIn thefeventh month the child acquires drength andfolidity ; as may be demon-\nftrated by thofe painful throws and twitchings which its mother feels from time to\ntime ;\nand it is now encreafed to eleven or twelve inches.\nIn the eighth month it generally meafures from fourteen to fixteen inches and in\nthe ninth month, or towards the end of its fulltime, it is encreafed from eighteen to\nrwenty-two inches, or more-, when the head, by be coming fpecifically heavier, than\nthe other parts, is gradually impelled downwards, and falling into the birth, brings\non what is termed the pains of parturition, or natural labour.

The remaining part of the ovum is covered by a membrane cal ledjpongy cho-\nrion ; within which is another called true chorion, which includes a third, termed\namnios. This contains a liquor, or watery fluid, in which the foetus floats till the\ntime of its birth. Before the child acquires a diftinft and regular form, it is called\nembryo ;\nbut from the time all its parts become vifible, it takes and retains the name\noffoetus till its birth. During the progrefs of impregnation, the uterus fuffers con-\nflderable changes ; but, though it enlarges as the ovum increafes, yet, in regard to\nits contents, it is never full ; for, in early geftation, thefe are confined to the fun-\ndus only : and, though the capacity of the womb increafes, yet it is not mechanically\nftretched, for the thicknefs of its fides do not diminifh ; there is a proportional in-\ncreafe of the quantity of fluids, and therefore pretty much the fame thicknefs re-\nmains as before impregnation. The gravid uterus or pregnant womb is of differ-\nent fizes in different women; and muff vary according to the bulk of the foetus and\ninvolucra. The fituation will alfo vary according to the increafe of its contents,\nand the pofition of the body. For the firft two or three months, the cavity of the\nfundus is triangular, as before impregnation ; but as the uterus ffretches, it gra-\ndually acquires a more rounded form. In general, the uterus never rifes directly\nupwards, but inclines a little obliquely, moft commonly to the right fide: its po-\nfition is never, however, fo oblique as to prove the foie caufe either of preventing or\nretarding delivery ; its increafe of bulk does not feem to arife merely from diften-\ntion, but to depend on the fame caufe and increafe as the extenfion of the fkin in a\ngrowing child. This is proved from fome late inftances of extra-uterine foetufes,\nwhere the uterus, though there were no contents, was nearly of the famefize, from\nthe additional quantity of nourifhment tranfmitted, as if the ovum had been contain-\ned within its cavity. The internal furface, which is generally pretty fmooth, ex-\ncept where the placenta adheres, is lined with a tender efflorefcence of the uterus,\nwhich, after delivery, appears as if torn, and is thrown off with the cleanfings.\nThis is the membrana decidua of Dr. Hunter ; which he defcribes as a lamella from\nthe inner furface of the uterus ; though Signor Scarpa, with.more probability, con-\nfiders it as being compofed of an infpiffated coagulable lymph.\nThough the uterus, from the moment of conception, is gradually diftended, by\nwhich confiderable changes are occafioned, it is very difficult to judge of pregnancy\nfrom appearances in the early months. For the firft three months the os tineas feels\nfmooth and even, and its orifice as fmall as in the virgin ftate. When any difference\ncan be perceived, about the fourth or fifth month, from the defeent of the fundus\nNo. 20. 4 L through\n\f3i 4 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nthrough the pelvis, the tubercle or projecting part of the os tineas will feem larger,\nlonger, and more expanded ; but, after this period, it fhortens, particularly at its\nfore-parts and lides, and its orifice or labia begin to feparate, fo as to have its coni-\ncal appearance deftroyed. The cervix, which in the early months is nearly fhut,\nnow begins to ftretch and to be diftended to the os tineas ; but during the whole\nterm of utero-geflation, the mouth of the uterus is ftrongly cemented with a ropy\nmucus, which lines it and the cervix, and begins to be difeharged on the approach\nof labour. In the laft week, when the cervix uteri is completely diftended, the ute-\nrine orifice begins to form an elliptical tube, inftead of a fifiure, or to aflfume the\nappearance of a ring on a large globe ; and often at this time, efpecially in pendu-\nlous bellies, difappears entirely, fo as to be out of the reach of the finger in touch-\ning. Hence the os uteri is not in the direction of the axis of the womb, as has ge-\nnerally been fuppofed.\nAbout the fourth, or between the fourth and fifth month, the fundus uteri begins\nto rife above the pubes or brim of the pelvis, and its cervix to be diftended nearly\none third. In the fifth month the belly fwells like a ball, with the fkin tenfe, the\nfundus about half way between the pubes and navel, and the neck one half diftend-\ned. After the fixth month the greateft part of the cervix uteri dilates, fo as to make\nalmoft one cavity with the fundus. In the feventh month the fundus advances as\nfar as the umbilicus. In the eighth it reaches mid- way between the navel and fero-\nbiculus cordis; and in the ninth to thefcrobiculus itfelf, the neck then being entire-\nly diftended, which, with the os tineas, become the weakeft part of the uterus.\nThus at full time the uterus occupies all the umbilical and hypogaftric regions ; its\nlhapeis almoft pyriform, that is, more rounded above than below, and having a\nftriCtureon that part which is furrounded by the brim of the pelvis. The appenda-\nges of the uterus fuffer very little change during pregnancy, except the ligamenta\nlata, which diminifh in breadth as the uterus enlarges, and at full time are almoft\nentirely obliterated.\nThe various difeafes incident to the uterine fyftem, and other morbid affections of\nthe abdominal vifeera, in weak and fickly females, will frequently excite the fymp-\ntoms, and affume the appearance, of real pregnancy. Complaints ^riling from a\nfimple obftruCtion are fometimes miftaken for thofe of breeding; when a tumor\nabout the region of the uterus is alfo formed, and gradually becomes more and\nmore bulky, the fymptoms it occafions are fo ftrongly marked, and the fefemblance\nto pregnancy fo very linking, that the ignorant patient is often deceived, and even\nthe experienced phyfician impofed on.\nScirrhous,\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3*5\nScirrhous, polypous, or farcomatous tumors in or about the uterus or pelvis ;\ndropfy or ventofity of the uterus or tubes fteatoma or dropfy of the ovaria, and\nventral conception, are the common caufes of fuch fallacious appearances. In many\nof thefe cafes the menfes difappear ; naufea, retchings, and other fymptoms of breed-\ning, enfue; flatus in the bowels will be miftaken for the motion of the child; and\nin the advanced ftages of thedifeafe, from the preflure of the fwelling on the adja-\ncent parts. Tumefa&ion and hardnefs of the breafts fupervene, and fometimes a\nvifcid or ferous fluid diftils from the nipple \u2022, circumftances that ftrongly confirm\nthe woman in her opinion, till time, or the dreadful confequences that often enfue,\nat lafl: convince her of her fatal miftake.\nOther kinds of fpurious gravidity, lefs hazardous in their nature than any of the\npreceding, are commonly known by the names offalfe conception and moles : the former\nof thefe is nothing more than the difiolution of the foetus in the early months ; the\nplacenta is afterwards retained in the womb, and from the addition of coagula, or\nin confequenceof difeafe, is excluded in an indurated or enlarged ftate; when it re-\nmains longer, and comes off in the form of a flefhy or fcirrhous-like mafs, with-\nout having any cavity in the centre, it is diflinguifhed by the name of mole. Mere\ncoagula of blood, retained in the uterus after delivery, or after immoderate floodings\nat any period of life, and fqueezed, by the preffureof the uterus, into a fibrous or\ncompact form, conftitute another fpecies of mole, that more frequently occurs than\nany of the former. Thefe, though they may afiume the appearances of gravidity,\nare generally, however, expelled fpontaneoufly, and are feldom followed with dan-\ngerous confequences. But, when two or more of the ova delcend into the uterus,\nattach themfelves fo near one another as to adhere in whole or in part, fo as to form\nonly one body, with membranes and water in common, this body will form a confu-\nfed irregular mafs, which is called a monjler ; and thus a monfter may be either de-\nfective in its organic parts, or be fupplied with a fupernumerary fetof parts derived\nfrom another ovum. This proceeds from a defeCt or accident in nature, which it is\nentirely beyond the power of medicine to reftify or prevent.\nIt would feem, however, from a due contemplation of the foregoing fatfts, from\nthe frame and ftrudture of females, and from the ultimate end and purpofe of their\nconformation, that almoft every malady refulting from a ftate of pregnancy, except\nthe lafl; mentioned, may be in a great meafure prevented or removed. The natural\ntemperature of women differs in a very confiderable degree from that of men, inaf-\nmuch as their blood and juices are determined to an oppofite and diftinCl purpofe ;\nand hence it is that obftrudtions of the menfes, their excefs, or privation of the of-\nfice intended them, conftitute thofe peculiar maladies which we term Difeafes oj Wo-\nmen.\n\f31(5 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nmen. The natural temperature of the male, is hot and dry ; that of the female, cold\nand rnifi. The adtion of the procreative tindture of man, is Solar, i. e. of a heat-\ning and quickening faculty \u2022, that of the woman is Lunar, i. e. of a cool and vege-\ntative quality. As the fun heats, and gives prolific energy to the fruits of the earth,\nfo man fecundates and gives life to the prolific tindture of the woman. Thus the\nmale, as the microcofm, or epitome of the celeftial fyftem, pofteffes an inherent fi-\nmilitude with the fun, which vivifies and quickens ; and thus the female, poflefling\nan inherent fimilitude with the moon, vegetates and brings forth the fruit ot her\nwomb, and not only feels the influence and fympathy of that luminary in her month-\nly difcharges, but in all the travail and viciflitudes of pregnancy. To the fame\nfource likewife we trace the caufe, and decide the queftion, Whether the fruit of the\nwomb be male or female ? for if the male feed be predominant, heat will abound,\nand a male foetus will be generated \u2022, but if the cooling moifture of the woman\novercomes the mafculine heat in the male feed, a female is then produced. The\nold and exploded notion of this caufe depending on the child\u2019s falling to the right\nor left fide of the mother, is too abfurd to weigh a moment on the mind of any rea-\nsonable enquirer.\nWe difcover likewife that the male, being conftituted of the Solar temperature,\nis naturally fubjedted to thofe infirmities of body and mind, which refult from the\nelements of fire and air; while thofe of the female are of Lunar tendency, arifing\nfrom the elements of water and earth. Of thefe four elements our grofs or material\npart is formed, and by their due and proper commixture in the conlfitution, or\ncirculating mafs, are life and health eftablifhed ; whilft, on the contrary, by their\ndifcordant, defective, or predominant power, difeafe and death are produced. Now\nthe male abounding in heat, and the female in moifture, is the reafon why many\ndiforders incident to man, are alleviated by contadt with the woman ; as thofe of\nthe woman are by contadt with the man. In the grand Scale of Nature, we find the\nmeridian heat and Scorching rays of the Sun, are qualified and corredted by the cool-\ning moifture and mild influence of the midnight Moon ; but when either of thefe\nare obftrudted in their effedt, by the intervention of accidental caufes, by ftorms,\nby tempefts, or unfeafonable blafts, we then endeavour to reprefs by art, the evil\nconfequences that are likely to enfue. Juft fo in the human economy, the grand\npurpofe and defign of medicine is to corredt and modify the difcordant elements in\nthe conftitution, and give that vigour and tone to the vital powers, which conftitute\nthe genuine principles of health and life.\nFrom what has been fuggefted we mi^ht fafely infer, that the conftitution and tem-\nperature of the female, requires a medicine of an oppofite adtion and tendency to\n2 that\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3*7\nthat adapted to the male, and which ought to be compounded of elements conge-\nnial to the intentions of Nature, calculated to purge the uterus, to purify the femi-\nnal fluid, and give ftimulus to the catamenia ; which, if not put in motion by the\nfunftions of nature, becomes dull and dagnant, and vitiates the whole circulating\nmafs ;\nwhence thofe diforders, peculiarly incident to the mod amiable, as being the\nmod virtuous of women, are confeflfedly derived ; and for the cure and prevention\nef which, a peculiar and didindl remedy has long been wanting.\nThefe, and other confiderations, influenced by the known power of fecond cau-\nfes, and their faculty of a&ing upon the mechanifm of the human frame, induced\nme to attempt the chemical preparation of two fubtile Tin&ures, condituted of a\nco-mixture of the pured elements of which our blood is compofed, and adapted to\nthe particular temperature and conditutions of the oppoflte fexes. That intended\nfor the ufe of Man, I call the SOLAR TINCTURE, as being congenial to the\nfeminal functions and vital principles of his conditution. That adapted to Woman,\nI call the LUNAR TINCTURE, as being calculated to aft upon the mendrual\nand vegetative fluids, and as being compounded of thofe elements which make up\nthe frame and temperature of her body. The invention of thefe Tin&ures hath been\nthe refult of a long and laborious application to the dudy of unveiled Nature\u2014-of\nthe properties of fire, air, earth, and water, in the propagation of animal and ve-\ngetable life, and in the compofition of medicine; in which, though thefe elements\nform the PABULUM of the univerfe, yet the art of colle&ing, uniting, and affi-\nmilating them with the vital fluids, feerns to be unknown among modern chymidso\nand hath efcaped the obfervation of medical Science. The fixidity of thefe Tinc-\ntures at once edabfifli their power and efficacy beyond all others ;\nfor they can ne-\nver be affefted by change of weather or climate, nor by heat or cold ; nor will they\ndiffer any diminution of their drength or virtue by remaining open, or uncorked ;\na circumdance which cannot be affirmed of any other fluid at prefent known,\nthroughout the world.\nI ffiall now proceed to fhew the aftion of the Lunar Tindlure on Female condi-\ntutions ; and as this medicine is only intended to remedy fuch complaints as parti-\ncularly relate to pregnancy, and the mendrual difcharge, I fhall omit to notice any\nother maladies, until I come to treat of the Solar Tin&ure ;\nwhich, though eflen-\ntially directed to give tone and vigour to the conditution of the male, is neverthelefs\nequally efficacious to the female in removing all diforders of the blood and lymph,\nthat are alike common to valetudinarians of both fexes. No complaint in the female\nhabit, therefore, comes under our prefent enquiry, till at or near the age of puberty.\nUntil this important period of the fex arrives, the Rules heretofore laid down in the\nMedical Part of my new edition of Culpeper\u2019s Family Phyficianj for the manage-\nNo. 2j\u2019>\n4 M ment\n\fgi8 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nment and future health of young ladies, deferve a very clofe and ferio-us attention*\nThe evident diftinCtion between the male and female in their ftru&ure and defign\u2014.\nin their bodily ftrength and vigour, and in the procreative fluids, demands the ut-\nmoft attention from themfelves, and the tendered care from the phyflcian. Nor\ncan we too often nor too earneftly caution parents and guardians againft the evils\nof that abfurd though fashionable {tile of bringing up young ladies, by confining\nthem almoft entirely to their apartments, keeping them on poor low diet, and ufing.\nartificial means to make them fpare and delicate, which contributes more to their\nprejudice than all the incidental difeafes to which they are otherwife fubjeCl. Thefe\nrefinementsin a female education, befides deftroying their ruddy complexion, (which\nis often the defign of it,) relaxes their folids, impoverifhes their blood, weakens\ntheir minds, and diforders all the functions of their body, whereby they are often\nrendered incapable of conception, and denied the felicity of becoming mothers. On\nthe contrary it ought to be the dudy, as it certainly is the duty, of all that have girls\nunder their care, to indulge them in every innocent diverfion, and' in every active\nexercife, that can give freedom to the limbs, or agility to the body, all of which\nhave a natural tendency to exhilarate their fpirits, to promote digedion, to dimulate\ntheir blood and juices, and,, at the proper age, to bring on a free and eafy difcharge\nof the mendrual flux.\nThough it is univerfally admitted, that this flux is abfolutely neceffary to nouriffe\nand fupport the foetus, and that without it human generation cannot be carried on ;\nand that it is confequently and obvioufly peculiar to the female uterine fydem ; yet\nis it curious to obferve the various abfurd and contradictory opinions fome phyfi-\ncians have laboured to edablifh, merely,. one would fuppofe, to bewilder the under-\nloading, and fubjeCt delicate females {till more to that erroneous or mifguided\ntreatment, in which their health, their life, and every earthly bleffing, is too fre-\nquently involved.\nDr. Bohn, and Dr. Freind, infift that this flux is nothing more than a plenitude\nof the common mafs of blood, which nature throws off only for relief againft the\ntoo abundant quantity. Dr. Freind fuppofes, that this plenitude arifes from a coa-\ncervationin the blood veffels of a fuperfluity of aliment, which, he thinks, remains\nover and above what is expended by the ordinary ways ; and that women have this\nplethora, and not men, becaufe their bodies are more humid, and their veffels, es-\npecially the extremities of them, more tender, and their manner of living generally\nmore inadive than that of men and that thefe things concurring, are the occafion\nthat women do not perfpire fufficientiy to carry off the fuperfluous alimentary parts*\ntill they be accumulated in fuch quantities as to diftend the veffels, and force their\nway through the capillary arteries of the uterus. It is fuppofed to happen to women.\nk more\n\f3*9\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nmore than to the females of other fpecies, which have the fame parts, becaufe of the\nerefl poftureof the former, and the vagina and other canals being perpendicular to\nthe horizon \u2022, fo that the prefiure of the blood is dire&ed towards their orifices\n:\nwhereas in brutes, they are parallel to the horizon, and the prefiure wholly is on the\nfides of thofe vefiels. The difcharge, he thinks, happens in this part rather than\nin any other, as being more favoured by the ftrufture of the vefiels-, the arteries be-\ning very numerous, and the veins finous and winding, and therefore more apt to\nretard the impetus of the blood -, and confequently, in a plethoric cafe, to occafion\nthe rupture of the extremities of the vefiels, which may laflr, till, by a fufficient\ndilcharge, the vefiels are eafed of their overload. To this he adds the confideration\nof the foft pulpous texture of the uterus, and the vad number of veins and arteries\nwith which it is filled. Hence a healthy maid, being arrived at her growth, begins\nto prepare more nutriment than is required for the fupport of the body j which, as\nthere is not to be any farther accretion, muft of necefiity fill the vefiels, and efpeci-\nally thofe of the uterus and breads, they being the lead comprefied. Thefe will\nbe dilated more than the others whence the lateral vafcules evacuating their humour\ninto the cavity of the uterus, it will be filled and extended. Hence a pain, heat,\nand heavinefs, will be felt about the loins, pubes, &c. the vefiels of the uterus, at\nthe fame time, will be fo dilated as to emit blood in the cavity of the uterus, and\nits mouth will be lubricated and loofened, and blood ifiue out. As the quantity of\nblood is diminifhed, the vefiels will be lefs prefied, and will contrail themfelves\nclofer, fo as again to retain the blood, and let pafs the grofier part of the ferum j\ntill at length only the ufual ferum pafles. Again, there are more humours prepa-\nred, which are more eafily lodged in vefiels once dilated j and hence the menfes go\nand return at various periods in various perfons.\nThis hypothefis isjudicioufly oppofed by Dr. Drake, who maintains, that there\nis no fuch plenitude, or at lead that it is not necefiary to menflruation y arguing,\nthat, if the menfes were owing to a plethora fo accumulated, the fymptoms would\narife gradually, and the heavinefs, diffnefs, and inactivity, necefiary fymptoms of a\nplethora, would be felt long before the periods were completed, and women would\nbegin to be heavy and indifpofed foon after evacuation, and the fymptoms would in-\ncreafe daily ; which is contrary to all experience, many women, who have them re-\ngularly and eafily, having no warning, nor any other rule to prevent an indecent\nfurprife, than the meafure of the time in which, fome that have flipped, have been\nput to confufion and drifts no ways confident with the notice a plethoric body\nwould give. He adds, that even in thofe who are difficultly purged this way, the -\nfymptoms, though very vexatious and tedious, do not make fuch regular ap-\nproaches.\n\f3zo A KEY T O P FI Y S I C,\npreaches as a gradual accumulation neceffarily requires. If we confider what vio\u00bb\n'lent fymptoms come on in an hour, we (hall be extremely puzzled to find the migh-\nty accefiaon of matter, which (hould, in an hour or a day\u2019s time, make fuch great\naltera. ions. According to the hypothecs, the laft hour contributed no more than\nthefirft; and of confequence, the alteration (hould not be greater in the one than\nin the other, fettingafide the bare eruption.\nThere are others who give into the doctrine of fermentation, and maintain the eva-\ncuation in thofe parts to be an effect of an effervescence or ebullition of the bio ;d.\nThis opinion has been maintained by Dr. Charleton, Bale, De Graaf, and Drake;\nthe two fir ft of whom fuppofe a ferment peculiar to the women, which produces this\nflux, and affeCts that part only, or at leaft principally. Dr. Graaf, lefs particular\nin his notion, only fuppofes an effervefcence of the blood, raifed by fome^ferment,\nwithout affigning how it aCts, or what it is. The fudden turgefcence of the blood\noccaffoned them all to think, that it arofe from fomething till then extraneous to\nthe blood, and led them to the parts principally affcChed to feek for an imaginary\nferment, which no anatomical inquiry could ever (how, or find any receptacle for,\nEor any reasoning neceffarily infer. Again, that heat which frequently accompanies\nthis turgefcence, led them to think the cafe more than a plethora, and that there\nwas fome extraordinary inteftine motion at that time.\nDr. Drake contends, that it is not only neceffary there (hould be a ferment, but a\nreceptacle alfo for this ferment ; concluding, from the fuddennefs and violence of\nthe fymptoms, that a great quantity muff; be conveyed into the blood in a (hort time,\nand confequently that it muff have been ready gathered in fome receptacle, where,\nwhile it was lodged, its adion was reftrained Fie pretends to afeertain the place\nboth of the one and the other, making the gall-bladder to be the receptacle, and the\nbile the ferment. The liquor he thinks well adapted to raife a fermentation in the\nblood, when difeharged into it in quantity ; and, as it is contained in a receptacle\nChat does not admit of a continual iffue, it may be there referved, till in a cer-\ntain period of time the bladder becoming turgid and full, through the compreffion\nof the incumbent vifeera, it emits the gall ; which, by the way of the ladeals, in-\nfinuating itfelf into the blood, may raife that effervefcence which occafions the aper-\nture of the uterine arteries. To confirm this, he alledges, that perfons of a bilious\nconftitution have the menfeseither more plentifully, or more frequently, than others;\naod that diftempers manifeftly bilious, are attended with fymptoms refembling thofe\nof women labouring under difficult menftruation. But, if this argument be admit-\nted, men would have the menfes as well as women. To this however he anfwers,\nthat men do not abound in bile fo much as women, the pores oTthe former being\nmore open, and carrying off more of the ferous part of the blood, which is the\nvehicle\n\f321\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE,\nvehicle of all the other humours, and confequently a greater part of each is dit-\ncharged through them than in women, wherein the fuperfluity mud either continue\nto circulate with the blood, or be gathered into proper receptacles, which is the cafe\nin the bile. The fame reafon he gives why menflruation fhould not be in brutes :\nthe pores of thefe being manifeftly more open than thofe of women, as appears from\nthe quantity of hair which they bear, for the vegetation whereof a large cavity, and\na wider aperture of the glands, is neceffary, than where no fuch thing is produced :\nyet there is home difference between the males and females even among thefe, lbme\nof the latter having their mends, fuch as the*orang outang, &c. though not fo of-\nten, nor in the fame form and quantity, as women. But without dwelling on thefe\nabftraft reafonings, the abfurdity of which will be obvious to every perfon who turns\nto the foregoing fyftem of human impregnation, we need only remark, that there\nare two critical periods in every woman\u2019s life, that completely deftroys their hypo-\nthefis. Thefe are, that at the age of fourteen or fifteen, the menfes begin to flow ;\nbutfubfide.attheageof forty or fifty. At their commencement, we generally find the\ndifficulty, and confequent difeafe, arifes from their deficiency ; whereas, according\nto the foregoing doftrine, they would then always flow with the greateft freedom.\nAt the period when they fhould ceafe, they are apt to come in fuch abundance as to\nbring on a flooding, which not only endangers, but too frequently deftroys life\u2014\na\nfatal confequence that could not poffibly happen, were the above arguments true.\nOf FEMININE, or LUNAR DISEASES.\nTHAT the vegetative or procreative faculties of women are univerfally governed\nby the lunations of the moon, their own experience, as well as the demonftrations\ngiven in my Treadle on the Occult Sciences, indifputably prove. The firft fhow\nof the catamenia, if it be natural, invariably comes with the new or full moon;\nor fometimes, though very feldom, at the commencement of her firft or la ft quar-\nters and this effort of nature isjuftly confidered as the fure fign of a procreating\nability, and of complete puberty. Whenever this feafon arrives, w hether early or\nlate, the conftitution of every female undergoes a confiderable change, and the great-\neft care and attention is then neceffary, fince the future health and happinefs of\nevery woman depends, in a great meafure, upon her conduct at this period. It is the\nduty of mothers, and of thofe who are intruded with the education of girls, to in-\nftrudl them early in the conduct and management of themfelves, at this critical mo-\nment. Falfe modefty, inattention, and ignorance of what is beneficial or hurtful\n* See this curious fuhjeft, concerning the orang outang, and other animals refembling the human fpecies,\ntreated at large, both hiftorically and philofophically, in my New Magazine of Natural Hiftory.\nNo. 21. 4 N at\n\f322 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nat this time, are the fources of many difeafes and misfortunes, which a very little\nattention might now prevent. Nor is care lefs neceflary in the fubfequent returns\nof this difeharge. Taking improper food, violent agitations of the mind, or catch-\ning cold, is often fufficientto ruin the health, or to render the female for ever after\nincapable of procreation.\nIn order to efcape the chlorofis, and other fimilar difeafes, incident to young wo-\nmen at that period when the menfes commence, let them avoid indolence and inac-\ntivity, and accuftotn themfelves to exercife in the open air as much as poflible.\nThe difeharge in the beginning is feldom fo inftantaneous as to furprife them una-\nwares. The eruption is generally preceded by fymptoms that indicate its approach\n;\nfuch as a fenfe of heat, weight, and dull pain in the loins } diftenfion and hardnefs\nof the breads, head-ach, lofs, of appetite, latitude, palenefs of the countenance,\nand fometimes a flight degree of fever. When thefe fymptoms occur, every thing\nfhould be carefully avoided which may obftruft the difeharge, and all gentle means\nufed to promote it i as fitting frequently over the fteams of warm water, drinking\nwarm diluting liquors, &c. When the menfes have begun to flow, great care\nIhould be taken to avoid every thing that tends to obftrua: them ; fuch as fifh, and\nall kinds of food that are hard of digeftion, and cold acid liquors. Damps are like-\nwife hurtful at this period ; as alfo anger, fear, grief, and other affedions of the\nmind. From whatever caufe this flux is obftruded, except in the ftate of pregnan-\ncy, proper means Ihould be inftantly ufed to reftore it ; and if exercife in a dry open,\nand rather cool air, wholefome diet, generous liquors in a weak and languid ftate of\nthe body, chearful company, and amufement fail, recourfe muft be had to medi-\ncine. In all fuch cafes blood-letting muft be carefully avoided \u2022, but let the patient\ntake from 20 to 30 drops of the Lunar Tindure, in a wine glafs of warm water or\npenny-royal tea, every morning before breakfaft, every day at noon, and every\nnight before going to bed, until the intention be anfwered, which will ufually take\nplace in three or four days, without the afliftanceof any other medicine whatever.\nBut it fometimes happens, in relaxed conftitudons, that the menftrual difeharge,\non its firft appearance, is vitiated, and over abundant ; the confequence of which\nis, that the patient becomes weak, the colour pale, the appetite impaired, and the\ndigeftion languid, fo that dropfy, or confumption, is likely to enfue. LfFedually\nto prevent thefe, let the patient be kept two or three days in bed, with her head low,\nand obferve a {lender diet, principally of white meats, and her drink red port negus.\nEvery night and morning, for ten or twelve days, let her take one table fpoonful\nof the Solar Tin&ure, diluted in double the quantity of deco&ion of nettle-roots,\nor of the greater comfrey-; and after the flux has abated, and her health and\nftrength\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3 2 3\nftrength feem to return, let her only take a table fpoonful of the Solar Tindture\nevery other day at noon, in a glafs of cold fpring water j which wonderfully con-\ntributes to reftore a due confiftency to the circulating mafs, promotes digeftion,\nand invigorates the fpirits. Before the cuftomary period returns, fhe muft difcon-\ntinue the Solar Tindture; and if there be the leaft appearance of irregularity or ob-\nftrudtion, let her again take night and morning, for two or three days, from 20 to 30\ndrops of the LUNAR TINCTURE in a glafs of penny-royal tea, and (he will\nquickly find a regular habit, and her health amazingly eftablifhed. In obftinate,\nor negledted cafes, where the menfes have feceded, and after an irregular appear-\nance, have turned wholly into the habit, both thefe Tindtures fhould be ufed with\na lefs fparing hand, particularly under circumftances in any refpedt fimilar to the\nfollowing remarkable\nCASE.\nBeing called to the afiiftance of a young lady of-\nfifteeen years of age, I was in-\nformed her menfes had made an irregular appearance about five or fix times, com-\ning firft with the full, and then with the new moon, and afterwards at the diftance\nof two or three months apart, until they totally difappeared, and turned back upon\nthe habit. No notice was taken, until the patient was'feized with a violent bleeding\nat the nofe, attended with fever, and epileptic fits. After being under the care of\nan eminent phyficianfor feveral months, who directed venefedtion, and almoft every\ncuftomary application, to no kind of purpofe, the diforder fixed in her neck, form-\ning a large tumour, the acrimony of which fell upon her lungs, and threw her in-\nto ftrong convulfions. In this extremity I was fent for. Perceiving the whole fyf-\ntem deranged by fpafmodic affedtions, and a locked jaw almoft finally compleated,\nmy firft objedt was to relieve the vital organs, by giving force and elafticity to the\ncirculating mafs. With this view I with difficulty forced open the mouth, and ad-\nminiftered one table fpoonful of the Solar Tindture undiluted j and within half\nan hour, to the aftonifhmeni of her friends, I had the pleafure of feeing every con-\nvulfive fymptom die away, and of hearing the patient\u2019s voice, of which fhe had\nbeen totally deprived for upwards of a week before. Two hours after, another fpoon-\nful of the Solar Tindture was taken with additional fuccefs ; and the patient after-\nwards continued this medicine in the quantity of a table fpoonful, in a wine glafs of\nwarm water, three times a day, for fix days, at the expiration of which time her\nappetite and ftrength were furprifingly returned *, and fhe was then put under a re-\ngular courfe of the Lunar Tindture. Twenty drops, in a wine glafs of penny-royal\ntea, were taken every night and morning for thirteen fucceftive days, and on the\nmorning following, it being the full moon, with which her menfes originally came,\nfhe\n\f3 24 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nflie had the confolation to find that every obftruftion was removed, and that the\ndue courfe of nature was completely re-eftabli(hed. The glandular fwellings gra-\ndually fubfided, her natural complexion quickly returned, and flie now continues\nin blooming health, perfectly regular, free from all obftrudtions, and from every\nconfequenr complaint, thankful for the blefiings of her recovery, and defirous of\ncommunicating the means to any unfortunate female under fimilar affliction ; and\nto whom reference may at any time be had, by application to the author.\nCHLOROSIS, or GREEN SICKNESS \u2022, by fomecalled, the Love-Fever.\nTHIS difeafe ufually attacks virgins a little after the time of puberty, and firfl:\nfhows itfelf by fymptoms of dyfpepfia or bad digeftion. But a diftinguiffling fymp-\ntom is, that the appetite is entirely vitiated, and the patient will eat lime, chalk,\nalhes, fait, &c. very greedily ; while at the fame time there is not only a total inap-\npetence to proper food, but it will even excite naulea and vomiting. In the begin-\nning of the difeafe, the urine is pale, and afterwards turbid ; the face becomes pale,\nand then afiumes a greenilh colour ; fometimes it becomes livid or yellow : the eyes\nare funk, and have a livid circle round them ; the lips lofe their fine red colour;\nthe pulfe is quick, weak, and low, though the heat is little fhort of a fever, but\nthe veins are fcarcely filled ; the feet are frequently cold, fwell at night, and the\nwhole body feems covered with aloft fwelling ; the breathing is difficult : nor is the\nmind free from agitation as well as the body ; it becomes irritated by the flighted\ncaules ;\nand fometimes the patients love folitude, and become fad and melancholy.\nThere is a retention of the menfes throughout the whole courfe of the diforder ;\nwhich eventually fix on the vital organs ; and death enfues.\nThe above complaint indifputably arifes from ftifling or fuppre fling the calls of\nnature at this vernal feafon, or juvenile fpring of life, when the primary command\nof God, \u201c encreafe and multiply,\u201d is mod fcnfibly imprefled upon the whole human\nfabric. Every tube and vdfel appertaining to the genital fyftem, being now filled\nwith fpermatic or procreative liquor, excites in the female a powerful, yet perhaps\ninvoluntary irritation of the parts, which drongly folicits the means of difcharging\ntheir load, that can only be done by venereal embraces. Thefe, from prudential\nreafons, being often neceflarily denied, the prolific tindtures feize upon the ftomach\nand vifcera, pen back and vitiate the catamenia, choak and clog the perfpirative\nvefiels, whereby the venal, arterial, and nervous, fluids become ftagnant ; and a leu-\ncophlegmatia, orwhite flabby dropfical tumour pervades the whole body, and quick-\nly devotes the unhappy patient to the arms of death. Thus, I am forry to remark,\nare thoulands of the moll delicate and lovely women plunged into eternity, in the\n3 very\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3*5\nv\u00a3ry blofiom of life, when female excellence is but budding forth, big with the\npromifed fruit of delicioufnefs and joy ? How much then does it become the duty\nof parents and guardians, who have daughters or wards in fituations likethefe, and\nwhere no very grofs objection can arife, to fuffer them to marry with the men they\nlove, otherwife to provide fuitable matches for them ; fince this will effedt the mod\nrational and moll natural cure, by removing the caufes of the complaint all together.\nIf, however, matrimony be not then convenient, nor likely, in a fhort time, to take\nplace, recourfe mult forthwith be had to proper regimen, and phyfical aid, other-\nwife delirium or confumption will quickly enfue. The belt method of regimen is\nlaid down in the medical part of this work, page 217, which, if well obferved, in\naddition to the following courfe, will generally perform a cure. Take leaves of\nmugwort, briony, and penny-royal, of each an handful * infufe them four days in\ntwo quarts of foft water, and then pour it off the clear liquor for ufe. Take a gill\nglafs three parts full, with thirty drops of the LUNAR TINCTURE added to it,\nthree times a day, viz. morning, noon, and night, till the decodtion be all ufed.\nThen reduce the dofeto 20 drops of the Tindture in a wine glafs of cold fpring wa-\nter morning and evening, for 15 days ; after which it might be taken only once a\nday, or every other day, until the patient find herfelf entirely free from every fymp-\ntom of the difeafe. For this malady, it is the only fpecific. hitherto known ; it un-\nclogs the fpermatic tubes ;\npurges and cools the uterus and vagina ;\npromotes the\nmenftrual difcharge, cleanfes the urinary paflages, diflolves vifcid humours in the\nblood, fharpens the appetite, {Emulates the nerves, and invigorates the fpirits, which\nin all ftages of chlorojis are fo apt to be deprefled. When this diforder is not very\nobftinate, nor far advanced, let the patient take from 20 to 30 drops of the Lunar\nTindture, in a wine glafs of cold fpring water for thirty or forty days fucceflively,\nand it will perform a cure without the trouble of preparing the decodtion. In this\nmalady, I have lately had the happinefs of completing an elegant cure, which I\nmention here, merely for the information of fuch unfortunate maids as may be\nlanguifliing under the fame deplorable circumftances. The following is a literal\nftatement of the\nCASE.\nA young lady, turned of feventeen, had been afflidted with chlorojis almoft three\nyears. In the early part of the malady, {he conceived an unconquerable appetite for\nwood-cinders, concreted mortar, tobacco-pipes, fealing-wax, &c. The courfes\nappeared at different intervals of the difeafe, but always irregular, and more or lefs\nin a vitiated ftate. About half a year preceding my attendance, this flux had totally\nceafedj but, upon the approach of every new moon, with which her menfes origi-\nNo. 2 z. 4 O nally\n\f32\n6\nA KEY TO PHYSIC,\nfially came, (he was afflided with pains in the back and loins, heavinefs and turgi-\ndity about the region of the womb, and other cuftomary fymptoms of the catamenia;\nyet not the fmalleft (how could be brought to appear. A little before this, the la-\ndy\u2019s affedions had been placed on a young man in the neighbourhood ; but whofe\nfituation in life was by no means on a fcale adapted to the views of her father and\nfamily. The moment therefore this attachment was difcovered, the lady was con-\nfined to her apartment, and neither buffered to take exercife or fre(h air, but when\nit fuited for fome trufty attendant to accompany her. This confinement brought on\na fettled melancholy, a green fallow complexion, dejeded fpirits, univerfal lati-\ntude, and wafting of the flefh. The morbid ftate of her body having thus undermi-\nned her conflitution, without attrading either her, own or her father\u2019s obfervation,\nthe diforder fell upon the vital organs, and with fo rapid a progrefs, that within\ntwenty-four hours the was feized with an ardent fever, attended with lofs of appe-\ntite, delirium, and a total privation of fpeech. In this (hocking ftate fhe had the\nalternate advice of three phyficians of the firft readability ; but the diforder increa-\nfing, and putting on the moft dangerous fymptoms, after having baffled their utmoft\n(kill, a confultation was had, and the miferable patient was configned to the grave.\nUnder thefe deplorable circumftances it was my lot to be called in ; and upon a\nclofe examination of the patient, fcarcely any vifible figns of life remained.

Warm nourifhing food was afterwards taken in fmall\nquantities; and I was enabled to remove the blifters, and perform the dreffings,\nwithout pain or torture to the languid patient. The Solar Tindure was now admi-\nniftered every day for ten days, in the quantity of a table fpoonful in a wine glafs of\nwarm barley-water, three times in the day, and once in the night, whenever watch-\nfulnefs came on.

The quantity, colour, and confiftence, of the\ndifchar\u00b0e, chiefly depend upon the time of its duration, the patient\u2019s habit of body,\nand the\n&\nnature of the caufe by which it was produced. Weakly women of lax fo-\nlids who have had many children, and long laboured under ill health, are of all the\nmoft fubjedt to this difagreeable difeafe \u2022, from which they unfortunately fuffer more\nfevere penance than others, as the niceft fenfations are often connected with fuch a\ndelicacy of bodily frame as fubjefts them to it. In Holland it is very frequent, and\nm a manner peculiar to the place, from the dampnefs of its Situation ; thefurround-\nino- air being fo overcharged with moifture as to relax the body, ftop perfpiration,\nand throw it upon the bowels or womb ;\nproducing in the firft a diarrhoea or flux,\nIn the laft the fluor albus or female weaknefs. The difcharge often proceeds from\nthe vefiels fubfervient to menftruationj becaufe, in delicate habits, where thofe\nveflels are weak, and confequently remain too long uncontra&ed, the fluor albus\nfometimes immediately follows the menfes, and goes off by degrees as they gradually\nclofe. It alfo comes from the mucus glands of the womb, as is particularly evident\nin very young females of eight or ten years old 3 in whom, though very rarely, it\n\f323 A K E Y TO P H Y S I C,\nhas been obferved, and where it muft then neceffarily have efcaped from thofe parts,\nas the urerine veffels are not fufficiemly enlarged for its paffage at fo early a period.\nSometimes-, as in women with child, it proceeds from the paffage to the womb, and-\nnot from the womb itfelf; which, during pregnancy, is clofely fealed up, fo that\nnothing can pafs from thence till the time of labour. The application of thofe in-\nffruments called peffaries, from the pain and irritation they occafion, are alfo apt to\nbring on this difcharge. The fluor albus has been fuppofed to fupply the want of\nthe menfes becaufe where thefirff prevails, the laft are generally either irregular or\ntotally wanting : but it might more properly be faid, that the prefence of the fluor\nalbus, which is a preternatural evacuation, occafions the abfence of that which is\nnatural ; as is evident from the return of the menfes after the fluor albus has been\n, cured. Indeed, when this difcharge appears about the age of 13 or 14, and returns\nonce a month, with fymptoms like thofe of menfes, then it may be deemed ftri&ly\nnatural, and therefore ought not to be flopped. The fluor albus may be diftin-\nguifhed into two kinds. The firffc arifes from a Ample weaknefs, or the relaxation\nofthe folids ; which may either be general, where the whole bodily fyftem is ener-\nvated and unfcrung; or partial, where the wombonly is affedted, in confequenceof hard\nlabour, frequent mifcarriages, a fuppreflion or immoderate quantity oi the menfes,\nor a fprain of the back or loins. In the firfl: cafe, the difcharge being generally\nmild, may be eafily taken away. In the fecond, it may proceed from a vitiated or\nimpure blood, where the body, from thence, is loaded with grofs humours, which\nnature for her own fecurity and relief thus endeavours to carry off In fuch cafes,\nthe difcharge is often of a reddifh colour, like that from old u3 cerous fores ; being\nSometimes fo fharp as to excoriate the contiguous parts, and occaflon a fmarting\nand heat of urine. A deap-feated darting pain, with a forcing down, attending-\nfuch a difcharge, is a very dangerous and alarming fign, and indicates an ulcera-\ntion or cancerous ftate of the womb. This malignant ftate of the difeafe, if of long\ncontinuance, is extremely difficult of cure j and difpofes the patient to barrennefs,\na bearing down, dropfy, or confumption. In fhort, as this is a malady of the molt\ndifagreeable kind, which by long continuance or negled becomes difficult of cure\nand often proves fatal, it were to be wiffied that women, on fuch occafions, would\nbe more attentive to their own fafety, by ufing all poffible means, in due time, to\nprevent the diforder.\nAs women are fometimes connected with thofe who do not confcientioufly regard\ntheir fafety, it is a circumftance of the utmoft confequence to diftinguilh a freffi ve-\nnereal infection from the fluor albus or whites ; for, if thefirff bemiftaken for the\nlaff.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCES. 329\nlaft, and be either negledted or improperly treated, the word: confluences may arife.\nIn addition therefore to what I have (dated in page 219 of the Medical Part, the fol-\nlowing figns will ferve to inform the patient whether there beoccafion for her doubts\nor not. A frefti infedtion, called gonorrhoea, is malignant and inflammatory ; the\nfluor albus moft commonly arifes from relaxation and bodily weaknefs : and there-\nfore the remedies proper in the Hrft diforder would render the laft more violent, by\nlocking up and confining the infedtious matter. In the gonorrhoea, the diicharge\nchiefly proceeds from the parts contiguous to the urinary pafiage, and continues\nwhilfl: the menfes flow \u2022, but in the fluor albus it is fupplied from the cavity of the\nwomb and its paflfage, and then the menfes are feldom regular. In the gonorrhoea,\nan itching, inflammation, and heat of urine, are the fore-runners of the difcharge \u2022,\nthe orifice of the urinary pafiage is prominent, and the patient is affedted with a fre-\nquent irritation to make water. In the fluor albus, pains in the loins, and lofs of\nftrength, attend the difcharge ; and, if any inflammation or heat of urine follow,\nthey happen in a lefs degree, and only after a long continuance of the difcharge,\nwhich, becoming fharp and acrimonious, excoriates the furrounding parts. In the\ngonorrhoea, the difcharge fuddenly appears without any evident caufe ; but in the\nfluor albus, it comes on more flowly, and is often produced by irregularities of the\nmenfes, frequent abortion, fprains, or long-continued illnefs. In the gonorrhoea,\nthe difcharge is greenilh or yellow, lefs in quantity, and not attended with the fame\nfymptomsof weaknefs. In the fluor albus, it is alfo often of the fame colour, efpe-\ncially in bad habits of body, and after long continuance j\nbut is ufually more\noffenfive, and redundant in quantity. The whites often afflidt maids of a weakly\nconftitution, as well as married women and widows ; and indeed there are few\nof the fex, efpecially fuch as are fickly, who have not known it more or lefs. For\nwhatever difeafe renders the blood poor, foul, or vifcous, and reduces a woman to\na languid condition, is commonly fucceeded by the whites, which, when they come\nin this manner, continue to weaken the body more and more, and are in great dan-\nger, without fpeedy remedy, of wearing away the patient, and making her a mi-\nl^rable vidtim to death. Let no woman, therefore, negledt this diforder, when ihe\nfinds it on her, but endeavour to obtain an immediate cure. The regimen and ge-\nneral management is pointed out in the Medical Part of this work, p. 220 ;\nand, in\nlieu of all other medicines, make a decodtion of tormentil-root, biftort, comfrey,\nand red-rofe leaves ; take a gill-glafs three parts full, and add to it thirty or forty\ndrops of the Lunar Tindture, which mufi: be perfifted in morning, noon, and\nnight, for ten days ; then take it morning and evening only for ten days more; after\nwhich difcontinue the decodtion, and take the Tindlure every morning for a month.\nNo. 21. 4P twenty\n\f320 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ntwenty drops in a wine glafs of cold fpring water, the difeafe will be found gradual-\nly to abate: and, upon any fymptoms of a return of it, take fifteen to twenty drops\nof the Tincture in a wine glafs of cold water every morning for a week, and it will\ngo entirely off ; as hath been verified in a great number of patients, who are ready\nto teftify that they owe their cure, even in the raoft obftinate cafes, entirely to the\nLunar Tinfture.\nOf BARRENNESS, or INFERTILITY.\nBARRENNESS is fuch a ftate of a woman\u2019s body, as indifpofes it, upon the ufe\nof the natural means, to conceive and propagate her fpecies. This proceeds from\nmany fources, which may be reduced to thefe two general heads : Firft, \u2014An indif-\npofition of the parts to receive the male femen in the adt of copulation, or that vi-\ntal effluvium ftreamingfrom it, which alone can impregnate the ovaria. Secondly,\u2014\n-\nAn inaptitude in the blood to retain and nourifh the vital principle after it is com-\nmunicated, fo as to make it grow and expand its parts, till it becomes a proper foe-\ntus. Conception is alfo hindered by a hedlic, hydropic, or feverifh, fickly habit\n;\nby a deficiency or obftrudtion of the monthly courfes, which impoveriffles the fluids j\nby the whites, which, continuing too long, relax the glands of the womb, and drown,\nas it were, the prolific particles j and too often by a vice, which utterly deftroys the\ntone and vigour of the parts j as is fully exemplified in the Medical Part of this work,\np. 22i. Preparatory to the cure of infertility, it is proper to ufe evacuations, unlefs\nany particular fymptom (hews them to be dangerous.

Inflead of deriving from it that blifsful gra-\ntification which gives the honoured name of Mother, fhe became weak, languid,\npale, and melancholy. The whole nervous fyftem was relaxed,\u2014 the natural func-\ntions of the body were fufpended,\u2014 cedematous tumours obftrudted the fanguife-\nrous paffages, whence incurable barrennefs, and lingering confumption, were the\nfad profpects left in view. In this melancholy ftate of body and mind, by advice\nof her phyfician, when all hopes were at an end, fhe was put under a regular courfe\nof the Lunar Tincture* which, to the aftonifhment of all, gradually deturged\nthe obftructedveffels\u2014propelled the animal juices through the fyftem\u2014 ftrengthen-\ned and braced the nerves\u2014 induced a regular habit\u2014 -reftored the fparkling eye and\nlivid cheek, and gave new vigour to the animal functions\u2014 the refult of which\nhas been, that before the end of the enfuing year, after her health was thus reco-\nvered, the lady became the happy mother of a SON and HEIR, to the inexpreffi-\nble joy of an affectionate hufband and a fympathifing family !\u2014For the fake of\nfemales labouring under a fimilar difeafe, reference to the above pleafing fact is\npermitted to be had by all refpectable enquirers, at the Author\u2019s houfe, in Upper\nTitchfield-ftreetj Cavendifh-fquare.\nINDIS-\n\f332 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nINDISPOSITIONS attendant on PREGNANCY.\nTHOUGH pregnancy is not a difeafe, but rather a natural alteration of the ani-\nmal-oeconomy, which every female is formed to undergo, yet it is attended with a\nvariety of complaints, which require great attention ; but for the cure or allevia-\ntion of which, medical aid has proved very deficient. In thefe complaints, however,\nthe Lunar Tindture exerts moft extraordinary properties, and excels whatever has\nbeen heretofore offered under a medical form. It is an univerfal purifier of thofe\nheterogeneous particles which produce naufea, and arife from the combining ef-\nforts of the mafculine and feminine Tindtures ; from whence, according to the\ngroffnefs of the procreative effences at the time of conception, proceed vomiting,\npains in the head and ftomach, fainting, &c. occafioned by the jarring elements\narifing from the difproportion in the heat and adtive principle of the conftituent\nparts of the male and female feed ; which is not only attended with great debility\nand depreflion to the mother, in her whole nervous fyftem, but often with heredi-\ntary difeafes, and dreadful confequences to the infant offspring. Indeed fo great\nhas been the conflidt of the male and female procreative Tindtures for the maftery\nor predominant power, while palling through the circulating mafs or habit of the\nmother, that the moft curious and aftonifhing phenomena have, on many occa-\nfions, been obferved to refult from it. In a fmall village in Somerfetfhire, in the\nyear 1759, a girl was born with the hair on her head of two remarkably diftindt co-\nlours \u2022, the right fide, from an exadfc parallel line which divided the fkull into two\nequal parts, was almoft black ; but the left fide, from the fame line, was of a red-\ndifh yellow. As fhe grew up, the dark hair became of a jet black, exadtly like\nthat of her father; whilft the other became of a ftrong carrotty red, precifely re-\nfembling that of her mother ; and, after the age of puberty, the hair on the privi-\nties, and under the arm-pits, as well as on her arms and legs, wasdiverfified in the\nfame manner; that on the right fide, all the way down, from head to foot, being\nblack; whilft that on the left was entirely red. The young woman lived till the\n28th year of her age, and was reforted to as a great curiofity.\nAnother well-known yet remarkable inftanceof this conflidt of the male and fe-\nmale procreative Tindtures at the time of impregnation, was the cafe of a man\nwho a few years fi nee kept a public-houfe in Tooley-ftreet, Southwark. His fa-\nther was a white man, belonging to one of the Weft-India packets; and his mother\nwas a negro girl, whom he had taken a fancy to, and purchafed on the arrival of\none of the Guinea flave-lhips at the ifland of Jamaica. He brought her with him\nto\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 333\nto London, and in the courfe of the enfuing year die was delivered of a fon, the\nwhole right fide of which was white like the father ; but the whole of the left fide\nwas black like the mother. As he grew up, this vifible didinftion became more\nftrongly marked; and during the time he kept the above public-houfe in Tooley-\nfcreet, he was reforted to by an immenfe concourfe of people, who flocked there to\nfpend their mite, in order to be fatisfied that fo great a curiofity really exifted. The\nwhole of his body appeared to be interfered by an exad parallel line, by which the\nefforts of conception feem to have united the male and female tindures in precife\nequilibrio, without fuffering them to intermix in coagula, or in impregnating and\nexpelling the ovum from the ovaria, to its fufpended ftate in the uterus. Hence\nthebair on theright fidewas longand brown, likethat of the father; and half the face,\nneck, body, and privities, with the arm, thigh, leg, and foot, on the right fide, were\nwhite ;\nwhile the correfponding parts on the left fide were black, like the mother,\nwith half the hair on the privities and head black and woolly, exadly like that\nof a true negro.\nA ftill more curious and ftriking example of this aftonifhing effort in the male and\nfemale procreative fluids, is verified in the cafe of Mr. John Clark, of Prefcot-\nftreet, Goodman\u2019s-fields. His father was a native of Africa, who by dint of good\nfortune, had amafied a confiderable fum of money, and fettled in London. He\nmarried a remarkably healthy young woman, a native of Devonfhire, who had been\nfome time his fervant. By her he had two Tons and three daughters, who were mu-\nlattos, except the elded fon, who was the fird born, and the perfon above alluded\nto. From the head to the navel, all round his body, he was remarkably fair,\nhad a fine fkin, handfome round features, light-brown hair, and fanguine complex-\nion, like his mother ; but from the navel downwards he was completely black, with\nfhort black woolly hair on the privities, exactly like the father. At the age of\nthirty, he married a young lady of good family and fortune, but of a delicate difpo-\nfition. For near three months he had the addrefs to conceal this deformity of colour\nfrom the knowledge of his wife, by wearing flefh-coloured filk drawers and dock-\nings, which he pretended were lined with flannel to keep off the rheumatifm, with\nwhich he had been forely afHi&ed, even to a degree that endangered his life, every\ntime he attempted to leave them off. It happened however, from fome negledt of\nconcealment before going to deep, that the curiofity of his wife was drongly excit-\ned; and the opportunity proving favourable in other refpefls, it being quite day-\nlight in the morning, and her huflaand fad afleep, die eagerly proceeded to latisfy v\nher doubts. Gently turning down the bed-cloaths, and removing the other impe-\ndiments in the way of a complete infpe&ion, fhe no fooner difcovered the real\nNo. 22. 4 Q date\n\f35 4 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nftate of things, than fhe fhrieked out vehemently, and fainted away ! The huf-\nband, thus fuddenly awakened, beheld his wife in a fit, and faw with forrowand re-\ngret theconfequences of a difcovery which entirely refulted from his own negleCt.\nHe immediately arofe, called up the fervants, and procured medical affiftance with\nall convenient fpeed j but in vain-\u2014the fudden furprize, added to the mortification\nand terror of mind, had fo powerful an effeCt, that the lady died in convulfions,\nnearly two months gone with child. I have often lamented that fortune did not\nthrow me in the way at this critical juncture, for two reafons ; in the firft place, I\nhave the vanity to think I could have faved the patient\u2019s life \u2022, but, had I failed, in\nthefecond, I would have perfuaded Mr. Clark, from motives of philofophical fpe-\nculation, and for the improvement of medical fcience, to have fuffered me to open\nthe womb of this unfortunate lady, in order to extraCt the foetus ; which, under the\ncircumftances of the uncommon conformation of the father, might have enabled\nme to throw a new light on this very curious fubjeCt of occult enquiry, perhaps fo as\nto have accounted, more obvioufly, for the jarring conflicts and ftruggling efforts\nof the mafculine and feminine tinCtures; to which alone we are to look for the\nformation of hermaphrodites, the production of monfters, &c.\nSympathy and antipathy moft certainly operate very powerfully on females in the\nearly ftate of pregnancy, and might, as was then fuggefted, have had a principal\nfhare in carrying off the above unhappy patient, while no means were ufed to coun-\nteract their influence on the mafs of blood. Sudden frights, longing and loathing,\nand all marks on the foetus, are obvioufly derived from this caufe, and can only be\ncorrected by giving energy and ftimulus to the circulating fyftem, whereby the func-\ntions both of mind and body are ftrengthened, and the nervous fluid fortified and\nprotected againft the fudden imprefllon of external objeCts. It feems to be admit-\nted by many eminent practitioners, that the difeafes incident to a pregnant ftate in\nthe early months, arife from fympathy.*, whilft thofe peculiar to the more advanced\nftages of geftation, are produced by the ftretching and preffure of the uterus on\nthe contiguous vifcera. Thus heart-burn and diarrhoea, tenfion and pains of the\nbreaft, naufea and head-ach, defire of unnatural food, tremors, and dejeCted fpirits,\nfainting andhyfteric fits, premature menftruation, and confequent abortion, proceed\n\u2022from the firft of thefecaufes; while coftivenefs, ftranguary, cramp, and cholic, ap-\npear to refult from the other. And though the celebrated Dr. Stahl, Dr. Cullen,\nand others, have fo much differed as to the theory of thefe difeafes, yet they all agree\nthat gentle opiates, aromatic infufions, ftrengthening bitters, and medicines calcu-\nlated to give energy to the languid ftate of the circulation, and to purify thegrofs\nand vifcid elements which opprefs the ftomach and vifcera, are the only proper re-\n2 medies\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 335\nrnedies to be adminiftered.

Whenever a woman has reafon to fufpeCt her men-\nfes are about to leave her, let her lofe four, five, or fix, ounces of blood, as her habit\nof body will admit \u2022, then let her make a decoCtion, by taking gentian-roots, one\npound \u2022, fenna, and orange-peels, of each half a pound ; pour upon them a gal-\nlon of hot water, and, after it has flood twenty-four hours, pour off the liquor for\nufe. Let her take from twenty to forty drops of the Lunar Tindlure in a gill-glafs\nfull of the above decoCtion, every night and morning for ten days ; then let her con-\ntinue it every morning for ten days more, and afterwards once every two or three\ndays, or oftener if the terms are of an ill colour and fcent, until they are corrected.\nThis courfe muflbe followed every fpringand fall, for a month or fix weeks fuccef-\nfively, by all women who find their menfes come irregularly, or toofparing, until\nthey entirely ceafe ^ after which let the patient put herfelf under a courfe of the Solar\nTinfture, for a month or fix weeks, taking one fpoonful in a wine-glafs of warm\nwater every night and morning for a week , then let it be taken only once a day, in\n.cold water, for the refidue of the time j and if file takes occafionally two table\nfpoonfuls of the Solar Tindlure, diluted in a tumbler of warm water, as a beverage\nafter dinner or fupper, inflead of wine or brandy and water, it will be productive\nof great benefit in eftablifhing an healthful ftate of her blood, and carrying off the\nvifcid humours generally produced by the menftrual flux returning into the habit.\nShould\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 337\nShould it at this time happen, which it often does, that the terms flow too abun-\ndantly, and produce a flooding, the patient muft immediately lofe fix or eight oun-\nces of blood, and be kept as much as poflible at reft, with her head low, until the\nmedicine has had time to take effeCl; let her diet be fpare, but not too lax ;\nand\nlet her apply to the following courfe : Take conferve of red-rofes, marmalade of\nquinces, juice of kermes, candied nutmegs, fyrup of quinces, and fyrup of coral,\nof each half an ounce; aromaticum rofalum, and aftringent faffron of iron, of\neach two drams ; oil of cinnamon fix drops ;\nmix into an eledbuary, (which might\nbe made up by any apothecary, if the receipt be fent him,) and take the quantity\nof a large nutmeg every day at noon for fix, eight, or ten, days, or longer, as the\nurgency of the cafe may require, drinking immediately after it twenty drops of the\nLunar TinCture in a wine-glafs of warm water; the flooding, by this means, will\ngradually abate, the feverifh fymptoms will go off, the back will be {Lengthened,\nthe womb-veflels cleanfed, and the patient wonderfully reftored. After the tenth\nday, in moft cafes, the elefluary might be difcontinued ; and the Lunar Tinfture\nfhould then be taken every morning for a month, from fifteen to twenty drops, ac-\ncording to the conflitution of the patient; by which time the parts will be braced,\ncomforted, and coiled up; fo as to fear no danger of a relapfe. About a month af-\nter, let her undergo a courfe of the Solar TinCture, for the purpofe of rectifying\nand ftimulating the mafs of blood ; this fhould be taken for a month ; a table\nfpoonful night and morning in a wine-glafs of cold fpring-water for the firft ten\ndays; and then once a day only for the refidue of the time; the good effcCts of\nwhich will be fenfibly and quickly felt.\nThe intention of nature in returning this flux back into the habit, is to nourilh\nand preferve life, not to deftroy it. Until the age of puberty, girls require this\nblood for the fuftenation and nouriihment of their bodies ; when that is fufficient-\nly eftablilhed, it is applied to the purpofes of nouriflfing the foetus, and of fuck-\nling the infant after it is born. When child-bearing ceafes, and the eve of life comes\non, the flux is returned back, to comfort and preferve it; therefore, if women were\nbut careful to obferve a regular courfe before this flux returns upon them, by\nadopting the methods I have prefcribed, and by taking the medicine fpring and fall\nfor two or three years previous to the time, they might not only efcape the perils and\ndangers attendant on this period, but would lay the foundation of a fettled ftate of\nhealth, and enjoy a found conflitution of body to extreme old age,\n4R\nNo. 22, Of\n\f33^ A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nOf MASCULINE, or SOLAR DISEASES.\nSOLAR difeafes are all fuch as proceed from a hot and dry caufe, and have\ntheir origin in the blood and lymph. For as the beams flowing from the fun are\nthe fountain of life and heat to the great world, or univerfal fyftem of nature, fo\nthe blood, flowing from the heart, is the fountain of life and heat to the little world,\nor univerfal fyftem of the microcofm,\nor body of man. And again, as the ftream of\nrays from the fun regulates the feafons, and produces the variety of climates, fo the\nftream of blood in man\u2019s body, as affeded by the fun, regulates and diverfifies the\nform and figure of the whole race of human beings. As feafons and climates are\nfubjed to the external elements, which are ftill governed by the fuperior influence\nof the fun, fo are they rendered either mild, healthful, and produdive, or turbu-\nlent, peftilential, and barren. Juft fo the whole circulating mafs is affeded by\nchange of climates and feafons, and by all the variations and agitations of the ex-\nternal elements; and hence difeafes are induced in the blood, and are either mild,\nardent, or acute, in proportion as the fanguiferous fluid becomes diftempered and\nimpaired by the adion of the ambient, or contiguous atmofphere. Thus we per-\nceive the folar influence on the human frame, and difcover that the origin of difeafe\nis in the blood; for, no longer than this vital ftream is kept in due circulation,\npure, and uncontaminated, can animal life be fuftained, or the body preferved in\nhealth and vigour.\nFrom the exprefs words of fcripture, Levit. xvii. n, 14. Deut. xii. 23. we are\nwarranted to infer, that \u201c in the BLOOD is the LIFE ;\u201d and there is not a doubt\nbut the living principle of the blood conftitutes the life of the body. Of this opi-\nnion was the celebrated Hervey, as well as many of the ancient philofophers and\nphyficians; and the late Mr. John Hunter declared himfelf to be of the fame way\nof thinking. We find the blood unites living parts, in fome circumftances, as\ncertainly as the yet recent juices of the branch of one tree unite it with that of ano-\nther. Were either of thefe fluids to be confidered as extraneous or dead matters,\nthey would ad as ftimuli, and no union would take place in the animal or vegetable\nkingdoms. This argument Mr. Hunter eftablifhed by the following experiment.\nHaving taken off the tefticle from a living cock, he introduced it into the belly of\nalivinghen. Many weeks afterwards, upon injeding the liver of the hen, he in-\njected the tefticle of the cock likewife, which had come in contad with the liver,\nand adhered to it. In the nature of things, there is not a more intimate connedion\nbetween life and a folid, than between life and a fluid. For, although we are more\naceuftomed to conned it with the one than the other, yet the only real difference\nwhich\n\f*\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 339\nwhich can be fhewn between a folid and a fluid is, that the particles of the one are\nlefs moveable among themfelves than thofe of the other. Befides, we often fee the\nfame body fluid in one cafe and folid in another. The blood will alfo become vaf-\ncular like other living parts. Mr. Hunter affirms, that, after amputations, the co-\nagula in the extremities of arteries form veflfels, and may be injected by injecting\nthefe arteries-, and he had a preparation by which he could demonftrate vef-\nfels rifing from the centre of what had been only a coagulum of blood, and opening\ninto a ftream of circulating blood. If blood be taken from the arm, in the molt in-\ntenfe cold which the human body can bear, it raifes the thermometer to the fame\nheight as blood taken in the mod fultry heat. This is a ftrong proof of the blood\u2019s\nbeing alive for living bodies alone have the power of refilling great degrees both\nof heat and cold, and of maintaining in almoll every fituation, while in health, that\ntemperature which we diftinguifh by the name of animal heat. Blood is likewife\ncapable of being adled upon by aftimulus; for it coagulates from expofure, as cer-\ntainly as the cavities of the abdomen and thorax inflame from the fame caufe. The\nmore it is alive, that is, the more the animal is in health, it coagulates the fooner on\nexpofure; and the more it has loll of its living principle, as in the cafe of violent\ninflammations, the lefs is it fenfible to the ftimulus produced from its being expos-\ned, and it coagulates the later. We may likewife obferve, that the blood preferves\nlife in different parts of the body. When the nerves going to a part are tied or cut,\nthe part becomes paralytic, and lofes all power of motion ; but it does not mortify.\nIf the artery be cut, the part dies, and mortification enfues. What keeps it alive\nin the firft cafe ? nothing but the living principle, which alone can keep it alive;\nand this phenomenon is inexplicable on any other fuppofition, than that the life is\ncontained in the blood. Another argument is drawn by Mr. Hunter from a cafe of\na fradtured os humeri. A man was brought into St. George\u2019s hofpital for afimple\nfradlure of the os humeri, or arm, and died about a month after the accident. As\nthe bones had not united, Mr. Hunter injedted the arm after death. He found that\nthe cavity between the extremities of the bones was filled up with blood which had\ncoagulated. This blood was become vafcular, or full of velfels. In fome places\nit was very much fo. He does not maintain that all coagulated blood becomes vaf-\ncular : and indeed the reafon is obvious ; for it is often thrown out and coagulated\nin parrs where its becoming vafcular could anfwer no end in the fyftem : as, for ex-\nample, in the cavities of aneurifmal facs. If it be fuppofed, that, in inch cafes as\nthat juft now mentioned, the veflels are not formed in the coagulum, but come\nfrom the neighbouring arteries, it is equally an argument that the blood is alive:\nfor the fubftance into which veflels fhoot muff: be fo. The very idea, that fuch a\n3 quantity\n\f340 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nquantity of dead matter as the whole mafs of blood, circulates in a living body, t\u00a7\nabfolutely abfurd.\nThole who have ventured to oppofe this doftrine, and the evidence of fcripture\nwith it, confiderthe brain and nervous fyftem as the fountain of life; and that, fo\nfar from receiving its life from the blood, the nervous fyftem is capable of inftanta-\nneoufly changing the crafts of the blood, or any other animal fluid ; and though the\nnervous fyftem cannot continue its a<5tion for any length of time if the adtion of the\nblood-veflels is fufpended, yet the heart and blood-veflels cannot aft for a Angle mo-\nment without the influence of the nervou fluid. For this reafon, fay they, it is\nplain we muft fuppofe the nervous fyftem, and not the blood, to contain properly\nthe life of the animal, and confequently to be the principal vital organ. The fe-\ncretion of the vital fluid from the blood by means of the brain, is, by the fupporters\nof this argument, denied. They fay, that any fluid fecreted from the blood muft be\naqueous, inelaftic, and inactive ; whereas the nervous fluid is full of vigour, elaftic,\nand volatile in the higheft degree. The great neceflity for the circulation of the\nblood through all parts of the body, notwithftanding the prefence of the nervous\nfluid in the fame parts, they fay is, becaufe fome degree of tenfion is neceflary to be\ngiven to the fibres, in order to fit them for the influx of the nervous fluid ; and this\ntenfion they receive from the repletion of the blood-veflels, which are every where\ndifperfed along with the nerves. >\nTo follow this opinion through every argument, would prove tedious and un-\nneceflary, as the following fhort obfervations will decide the matter abfolutely\nagain ft the patrons of the nervous fyftem. In the firft place, then, if we can prove\nthe life of the human body to have been communicated from a fluid to the nervous\nfyftem, the analogical argument will be very ftrongly in favour of the fuppofition\nthat the cafe is fo ftill. Now that the cafe once was fo, is moft evident ; for the hu-\nman body, as well as the body of every other living creature, in its firft ftate, I have\nfhewn to be a gelatinous mafs, without mufcles, nerves, or blood-veflels. Never-\nthelefs, this gelatinous matter, even at that time, contained the nervous fluid. Of\nthis there can be no doubt, becaufe the nerves are formed out of it, and have their\npower originally from it ; and what is remarkable, the brain is obferved to be that\npart of the animal which is firft formed. Of this gelatinous or procreative fluid\nwe can give no further account, than that it is the nutritious matter from which the\nwhole body appears to be formed. At the original formation of man and other ani-\nmals, therefore, the nutritious matter was made the fubftratum of the whole body,\nconfifting of mufcles, nerves, blood-veflels, &c. nay more, it was the immediate\nefficient caufe of the nervous power itfelf. Again, in the formation of the embryo,\nwe\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 34t\nwe fee a vital principle exifting as it were at large, and forming to itfelf a kind of\nregulator to its own motions, or a habitation in which it choofes to refide, rather\nthan to aft at random in the fluid. This habitation, or regulator, is undoubtedly\nthe nervous fyftem ; but at the fame time, it is no lefs evident that a nutritious fluid\nis the immediate origin of thefe fame nerves, and of that very nervous fluid. Now\nwe know, that the fluid which in the womb nouriffies the bodies of all embryo ani-\nmals, is necefiarily equivalent to the blood which nouriffies the bodies of adult\nones-, and confequently, as foon as the blood became the only nutritious juice of\nthe body, at that fame time the nervous fluid took up its refldence there, and from\nthe blood diffufed itfelf along the nerves, where it was regulated exaftly according\nto the model originally formed in the embryo. Perhaps it may be faid, that the vital\npower, when once it hath taken pofleffion of the human or any other body, requires\nno addition or fupply, but continues there in the fame quantity from firft to laft. If\nwe fuppoie the nervous power to be immaterial, this will indeed be the cafe, and\nthere is an end of reafoning upon the fubjeft; but, if we call this power a volatile,\nandelaftic fluid, it is plain that there will be more occalion for recruits to fuch a\npower than to any other fluid of the body, as its volatility and elafticity will pro-\nmote its efcape in great quantities through every pore of the body. Jt may perhaps\nbe objefted, that it isabfurd to fuppofe the blood capable of putting matter in fuch\na form as to direft its own motions in a particular way : but even of this we have a\npofitive proof in the cafe of the electric fluid. For if any quantity of this matter\nhas a tendency to go from one place to another where it meets with difficulty,\nthrough the air for inftance, it will throw lmall conducing fubftances before it, in\norder to facilitate its progrefs. Alfo, if a number of fmall and light conducting\nfubftances are laid between two metallic bodies, fo as to form a circle, for example;\na ffiock of eleClricity will deftroy that circle, and place the fmall conducting fub-\nftances nearer to a ftraight line between the two metals, as if the fluid knew there was\na ffiorter paflage, and refolved to take that, if it ffiould have occafion to return.\nLaftly, it is univerfally allowed, that the brain is a fecretory organ, made up of an\ninfinite number of fmall glands, which have no olher excretories than the medul-\nlary fibres and nerves. As a confiderable quantity of blood is carried to the brain,\nand the minute arteries end in thefe fmall glands, it follows, that the nervous fluid\nmuft come from the blood. Now, there is no gland whatever, in the human or\nany other body, but will difcharge the fluid it is appointed to fecrete, in very confi-\nderable quantity, if its excretory is cut. Upon the cutting of a nerve, therefore,\nthe fluid fecreted by the brain ought to be dilcharged ; but no fuch difcharge is vifi-\nble. A fmall quantity of glairy matter is indeed difeharged from the large nerves\n;\nNo. 22. 4 S but\n\f342 A KEY TO P El Y S I C,\nbut this can be no other than the nutritious juice neceflary for their fupport. This\nmakes it plain, even to demonftration, that the fluid fecreted in the brain is invifi-\nble in its nature ; and as we know the nervous fluid hath its refldence in the brain,\nit is very probable, to ufe no fcronger expreflion, that it is the peculiar province of\nthe brain to fecrete this fluid from the blood, and confequently that the blood origi-\nnally contains the vital principle.\nThis fadl being eftablilhed, I fliall now endeavour to defcribet\u2019ne adfion of quick-\nening, or mode by which life is communicated to the child in the womb, which\nulually takes place in the fifth month of pregnancy. Opportunities, however, of\ndiflefling the human gravid uterus at or near this critical juncture occurring but\nfeldom, it is with great difficulty that afubject of this delicate and abftrufe nature\ncan be treated with perfpicuity, and is the principal caufe why it has not been at-\ntempted by former phyfiologifts. I have already fhewn, that the rudiments of the\nembryo puts forth four membranes, viz. the placenta, the navel-flring, the chorion,\nand amnios, which contains the fluid above-mentioned, in which the foetus floats.\nUntil the period of quickening arrives, the embryo poflefies only vegetative life, fimi-\nlar to that of a common plant and its growth is nourifhed and preferved by the\nfluid in which it fwims, until the nerves, veins, arteries, and vital organs, are entire-\nly formed, and the circulation of its mother\u2019s blood is completed through them,\nwhich is conducted in the following manner.\nThe placenta is the medium by which the blood from the heart of the mother is\ncommunicated to that of the child ; but to check its too rapid progrefs, which would\noverwhelm the tender veflels of the infantframe, the texture of the placenta is form-\ned fimilar to that of a fponge, round like -a cake, of confiderable dimenfions, and\ncapable of great abforption, being chiefly made up of the ramifications of the um-\nbilical arteries and vein, and partly of the extremities'of the uterine veflels. The\narteries of the uterus difcharge their contents into the fubftance of this cake ; and\nthe veins of the placenta, receiving the blood either by a direct communication of\nveflels, or by abforption, at length form the umbilical vein, which pafles on to the\nflnus of the vena porta, and from thence to the vena cava, and heart of the infant,\nby means of the canalis venofus, a communication that is clofed up in the adult.\nBut the circulation of the blood through the heart is not conducted in the fcetus as\nin the adult : in the latter, the blood is carried from the right auricle of the heart\nthrough the pulmonary artery, and is returned to the left auricle by the pulmonary\nvein j but a dilatation of the lungs is eflential to the paflage of the blood through\nthe pulmonary veflels, and this dilatation cannot take place till after the child is\nborn, and has refpired. This deficiency, is therefore fupplied in the foetus by an\nimmediate\n\fAND. OCCULT SCIENCE. 3 43\nimmediate communication between the right and left auricle, through an oval open-\ning, in the feptum which divides the two auricles, called foramen ovale. The\nblood in the foetus, is likewife tranfmitted from the pulmonary artery to the aorta,\nby means of a dudt called canalis arteriofus, which, like the canalis venofus, and fo-\nramen ovale, gradually clofes after birth. The blood is returned again from the\nfoetus to the mother through two arteries called umbilical arteries, which arifefrom\nthe iliacs. Thefe two veftels, taking a winding courfe with the vein, form with that,\nand the membranes by which they are furrounded, what is called the umbilical\nchord. Thefe arteries, after ramifying through the fubftance of the placenta, dif-\ncharge their blood into the veins of the uterus, in the fame manner as the uterine\narteries difcharged their blood into the branches of the umbilical vein. So that after\nquickening, the blood of the mother is conftantiy palling in at one fide of the pla-\ncenta, and out again at the other, for the nourilhment of the child.\nNow what we call th taftion of quickening, is that inftantaneous, yet undefcribable\nmotion of the vital principle, which, the inftant the foetus has acquired a fufficient\ndegree of animal heat, and is completely formed in all its parts, rulhes like an elec-\ntric Ihock, or flafh of lightning, conducted by the fanguiferous and nervous fluids,\nfrom the heart and brain of the mother, to the heart and brain of the child. Ac\nthis moment the circulation begins ; the infant fabric is completely fet in motion ;\nand the child becomes a living foul. As foon, therefore, as the circulation commen-\nces, the child ftarts into life ; and the inftant the circulation ceafes, life ceafes alfo.\nThis aft of quickening is therefore derived from the blood, and is fo fenfibly felt by\nthe mother, that fhe often faints, and feels an internal depreflion of her animal and\nvital powers, which may be faid, in fome meafure, to have departed from her. But\nthe adt of quickening does not take place in all women at the fame period, nor al-\nways in the fame woman at the fame diftance of time from her conception ; nor is it\ngoverned by any given number of weeks or days after conception has taken place ;\nbut depends entirely on that inftant of time, when the joint influence of animal\nheat, and an entire completion of the nerves, veins, arteries, and other parts and or-\ngans, of the foetus, are fitted and ready to receive and fupport a due circulation of\nthe blood and juices; for this, and this alone, is the fource of quickening, and the.\nbeginning of animal life. Strong and healthy women will therefore quicken fooner\nthan the weak and delicate, by reafon that their procreative and ftimulating pow-\ners are more robuft and can fooner contribute that portion of animal heat, which is\nnecefiary to the entire completion of the foetus in all its parts ; and which will hap-\npen fooner or later, according to the health and ftrength of the pregnant woman,\nand her fufficiency of menftrual blood to fupport the demand. For this flux will\n3 now\n\f344 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nnow be wholly taken up by the new fubjedl, until the hour of birth ; after which k\neither renews its monthly evacuation, as being redundant in the mother \u2022, or, if (he\nfuckles the child, it is then determined to the mammae, and is converted into milk*\nSuch is this curious and moil admirable contrivance of nature, for the re-pro-\nduftion and propagation of mankind ; and fuch the nature and event of that myile-\nrious adtion of quickening, which has hitherto been involved info much darknefs\nand obfcurity, as to lead the unthinking multitude to fuppofe, that giving life to the\n'aecus, was in every inftance a new and diftindt interpofition of the Deity, inftead of\nreligioufly imputing it to that primary exertion of his omnipotence, which, in the\noriginal formation of Adam, implanted in his nature the power of re-producing his\nlike, and of imparting life and foul to his fpecies, by a fixed and immutable decree,\nto be continued down from father to fon, to the finalend and confummation of this\nfublunary world. If the feed of Adam had not been originally endued with the\ngift of imparting life and fpirit to his future generations, how could the fouls of his\ndefcendants be fubjedted to original fin ? Were any one child defcended from the\nrace of Adam, to receive the gift of life and foul from a fubfequent exertion of the\npower of God, it would become a new and diftindl adl of creation, and the offspring\ncould notpoffibly be contaminated by theFall, nor be fubjedted to themiferies and\nmisfortunes refulting from it, as having received its being from an independent\ncaufe.\nI have, to the belt of my ability, endeavoured to illuftrate this occult procefs of\nNature, by means of the annexed copper-plate engraving, taken from the vifcera\nand womb of an afflidted female, who fainted and died at the time of quickening,\nthe foetus itfelf being now preferved in fpirits. The ftrudture of the gravid uterus\nis, however, extremely difficult to be ffiewn, and the more fo under thefe peculiar\ncircumftances. In the wombs of women who die after this period, or at the time of\nlabour, or foon after delivery, fibres running in various directions are obfervable\nmore or lefs circular, that l'eem to arife from three diftindl origins, namely, from the\nplace where the placenta adheres, and from the aperture and orifice of each of the\ntubes \u2022, with all the veins and veffiels communicating to and from the placenta and\nthe mother, furcharged with bloody but it is almoit impoffible to demonftrate re-\ngular plans of veffiels and fibres, continued any length, without an interruption\nwhich involves us in doubt, and deftroys that view of the admirable connexion\nwhich nature has formed between the vital organs of the mother and child in a (late\nof advanced pregnancy.\nFrom the foregoing obfervations we may fafely conclude, that the mafs of blood is\nthe univerfal medium by which life is propagated, and health preferved, to every\nclafa\n\fl\n\/\n-\nV\/,\n--A . ..\n) J\n\f\f34 ,\nand occult science.\nclafs of beings; and that, in its impure or infe&ed ftate, it is the fource from\nwhence the endlefs number of hereditary difeafes derive their origin. Whatever\nfault impairs the parent blood, fails not to taint the tender habit of its young;\nwhence it has become an eftablifhed maxim, that, as healthy parents naturally pro-\nduce healthy children, fo difeafed parents as naturally produce a difeafed offspring.\nSome of thefe difeafes appear in the earlieft infancy; others occur equally at all\nages; whilft others lurk unfufpe<5ted in the habit to extreme old age, or even to a\nnew generation, (lowly impairing the vital organs, and gradually undermining the\nconftitution, before their fource, and fatal tendency, can poftibly be difcovered.\nThere are fome difeafes indeed, which, though born with us, cannot be faid to be\nderived from the parent, as when a foetus receives fome hurt by an injury done to\nthe mother ;\nwhile others, neither born with us, nor having any foundation in the\nconftitution, are fucked in with the nurfe\u2019s milk. Let it then be the care of every\nparent, who from fome local misfortune is fo far compelled to depart from the ties\nof nature as to abandon her tender offspring to the breaft of another, to be fatis-\nfied, as far as human forefight and medical penetration can reach, that the conftitu-\ntion and blood of the nurfe be free from fchrophula and every other hereditary\nimpurity.\nAccidental difeafes, though not derived from the parents, neverthelefs in general\nfpring from the blood ; which, conftituting or propagating animal life through eve-\nry part of the body, is neceffarily expofed to every external offending caufe, from\nwhich imprefflon particular accidental difeafes enfue. The climate itfelf, under\nwhich people live, will often produce thefe affecf ions in the blood ; and every par-\nticular climate hath more or lefs a tendency to produce a particular difeale, either\nfrom its excefs of heat or cold, or from the mutability of the weather. An im-\nmenfe number of difeafes are alfo produced in the blood by impure air, or fuch as\nis loaded with putrid, marfhy, and other noxious, vapours. The fame thing like-\nwife happens from high-fealoned or corrupted aliment, whether meat, or drink j\nthough even the beft and moft nutritious aliment will hurt, if taken in too great a\nquantity ; not to mention poifons, which are endowed with fuch pernicious quali-\nties, that, even when taken in the fmalleft quantity, they produce the moft grievous\nferment in the blood, ending perhaps with death itfelf.

The human body is poftcffed of a molt wonderful power, by which it pre-\nferves itfelf from difeafes, keeps off many, and in a very fhort time cures fome al-\nready begun, while others are by the fame means more (lowly brought to a happy\nconclufion. This power, called the autocrateia ,\nor vis medicatrix nature, is well\nknown both to phyficians and philofophers, by whom it is moft juftly celebrated j\nfor this alone is fufficient for curing many difeafes, and is of fervice in all. Nay,\neven the beft medicines operate only by exciting and properly directing thisexpul-\nfive force, by which the excrementitious humours from the aliments and blood are\nexpelled, through the proper channels of evacuation, through the excretory duffs,\nchiefly by means of the infenjibleper\/piration,\nby which power the offending humours\nfrom the blood and juices are perpetually flying off. But though phyficians juftly-\nput confidence in this power, and though it generally cures difeafes of a flighter\nkind, yet it is not to be thought that thofe of a more grievous tendency are to be\nleft to the unaftifted efforts of the footfteps of Nature. Phyficians have therefore\na two-fold error to avoid, namely, either defpifmg the powers of the vis medicatrix\ntoo much, which, if left alone, would work a radical and perfect cure ; or, putting\ntoo great confidence in thefe exertions of nature, they are left unfeconded and alone,\ntill the virulence of infection or difeafe undermines the conftitution, and bears down\nall before it.\nThe grand and perpetual means by which the foul and offending humours in the\nblood and juices are continually carried off, is undoubtedly through the perfpira-\ntive pores and veffels, which it is highly compatible with found health to keep open,\nand for which purpofe medicaments are principally ufed. When this evacuation\nis copious and grofs enough to be difcerned by the eye, as infweat, the perforation\nis faid to be fenfible but where it is fo volatile as to efcape the notice of the fenles,\nas is the cafe in the ordinary ftate of the body, it is called infenftble perfyiration,\u2014The\nveffels through which the perfpiration is performed lie obliquely open under the\nfquammae or fcales of the cuticle or fcarf-lkin. They are inconceivably fmall\nfrom a calculation of Leewenhoeck it appears, that the mouths of one hundred\nand twenty-five thoufand of them may be covered with a common grain of fand.\nThe moft confiderable of thefe pores are the orifices of the dudls arifing from the\nmiliary glands. Through thefe veffels there is continually tranfuding a fubtle hu-\nmour, from every point of the body, and throughout the whole expanfe of the cuti-\ncle. The matter evacuated this way is found by certain experience to be more than\nequal\n\f347\nand occult science.\nequal to that evacuated all the other ways, i. e. by ftool, mine, &c. Sandlorius\nfound in Italy, under the circumftances of a moderate diet, middle age, and eafy\nlife, that the matter infenfibly perfpired was five-eighths of that which was taken\nin for food : fo that there only remained three-eighths for nutrition, and for the\nexcrements of the nofe, ears, inteftines, bladder, &c.\nThe fame author (hews, that as much is evacuated by infenfible perfpiration in one\nday as by ftool in fourteen days ;\nparticularly that, in the fpace of a night\u2019s time,\nabout fixteen ounces are ordinarily difcharged by urine, four ounces by ftool, and\nabove forty ounces by infenfible perfpiration. He alfo obferves, that, if a man eat\nand drink eight pounds in a day, five pounds of it are fpent in infenlible perlpira-\ntion \u2022, and adds, as to the times, that within five hours after eating there is perfpir-\ned about one pound ; from the fifth to the twelfth hour about three pounds * and\nfrom the twelfth to thefixteenth fcarcely half a pound. M. Dodart, from a number\nof experiments made thirty-three years fucceflively, proves that we peripire much\nmore in youth than in age. In fome perfons the perfpiration is fo copious, that they\nvoid very little of the coarfer excrements, though they eat heartily. The benefits of\ninfenfible perfpiration arefo great, that without it animal life could not bepreferv-\ned. The general caufe of perfpiration is the circulation and heat of the blood,\nwhich enables it to throw off the offending matter. The great fubtlety, equability,\nand plenty, of the matter, thus perfpired, its increafe after fleep, &c. conffitute the\ngrand fymptoms of a perfedt ftate of health; and the chief means of preferving\nthe fame. On the contrary, the departing from thefe is the firft fure fign of ap-\nproaching difeafes.\nPerfpiration is performed, preferved, and increafed, by the vifcera, veffcls, and\nfibres \u2022, by motion or exercife as far as the firft appearance of fweat ; by moderate\nufe of venery \u2022, by fleep of feven or eight hours, the body well covered, yet non\nloaded with bed-clothes : cheerfulnefs ; light, fermented, yet folid, food, not fat ;\npure, not heavy, air, See. The contraries of all thefe, as alfo the increafe of the\nother excretions, diminifh, prevent, and deprave, it. Hence we fee the caufe and\nefr\u2019edt of this perfpirable matter, its ufe in preferving the parts foft and flexibl ,\nand in fupplying what is loft, but chiefly in preferving the nervous papillae moift,\nfrefh, lively, and fit to be affedted by objedts, and to tranfmit their impreffions.\nHence it is, that upon a ftoppage of the ufual perfpiration there arife fo many in-\ndifpofitions, particularly fevers, agues, rheums, Sec. Too much perfpiration oc-\ncafions weaknefs, and fwoonings \u2022, whilft too little, or none at ail, occafions the ca-\npillary veflels to dry, wither, and perifh. Hence alfo the larger emundlories come\nto be obftrudted-, hence the circulation is difturbed, fharp humours retained ;\nand\n3 hence\n\fA KEY TO PHYSIC\n348\nhence putridity, crudity, fevers, inflammations, and impofthumes. Cold prevents\nperfpiration, by conftringing the pores of the fkin and thickening the liquors cir-\nculating in the cutaneous glands ;\nheat, on the contrary, augments it, both by\nopening the excretory dudts of the glands, and by increafing the fluidity and veloci-\nty of the humours. To determine the ftate and conditions of the perfpiration, fo\nnecefiary for judging of thofe of the body, Sandtorius invented a weighing chair,\nwhereby he examined the quantity, degree, &c. of perfpiration in feveral circum-\nftances of the body, under feveral temperatures of the air, and in the feveral inter-\nvals of eating, drinking, fleeping, &c.\nSome of the more extraordinary phenomena obferved in the fpeculation, are,\nthat for fome time after eating the perfpiration is lead of all ; that between the fifth\nand twelfth hour after meals perfpiration is greateft ; that riding either on horfe-\nback, in a coach or fhip, &c. brifk motion on the ice, &c. but, above all, a brifk\nfridtion of the Akin, promote perfpiration furpriflngly ; and that perfpiration is na-\nturally always much lefs in women than in men. Perfpiration is influenced by the\npaflions of the mind. Thus anger and joy increafe, and fear and fadnefs leflen,\nboth perfpiration and urine. Anger caufes a ftrong motion in the membranes of\nthe heart, and quickens its contraction and dilatation, and thereby quickens the\ncontraction and dilatation of the blood-veflels and fecerning dudts, and of confe-\nquence increafes the difeharges of perfpiration and urine; and that more or lefs, in\nproportion to the ftrength and continuance of the paflion. Joy affiedts thefe dif-\neharges in like manner as anger. In the paflions of fear and forrow, perfpiration\nand urine are leflened, by the deprefflon of the adtivity of the foul under thofe paf-\nfions. The proportion of perfpirtaion to urine is increafed by all thofe exercifes\nwhich increafe the motion of the blood, and warm the fkin.\nWe have an account of a perfon who, by pafling many nights in aftronomical fpe-\nculations, had his perfpiration fo obitrudted by the cold and damp of the air in Hol-\nland, that a fhirt he had worn for five or fix weeks was as clean as if it had been\nworn but one day. The confequence of this was, that he gathered fubcutaneous\nwaters but was cured in time. The garments beft calculated to encourage and\npromote infenfible perfpiration, to keep the mouths of the minute veflels open, and\nto guard the body from the too fuaden and violent effedls of cold, are thofe made\nof flannel. Whence flannel fliirts and waiftcoats, ora fquare piece of flannel worn\nover the bread: or pit of the ftomach, particularly in the winter months, are produc-\ntive of fuch beneficial effedls to weakly and debilitated conftitutions, and adt as a\nvaluable prefervative to the hale and robuff. In the annexed copper-plate engrav-\ning, I have endeavoured to (hew the manner in which the infenfibje perfpiration\niffues\n*\n\f\/\n. p\n\f2k lilife\n7)cM M.\nTn\/'r .ratty\n\f30\nand occult science\niiuics from the pores of the body, which can only be difcerned by means of a ler.s ;\nbeing of fo volatile and fubtle a quality, that it partes through our garments with\nthe utmoft eafe, particularly if woollen \u2022, and it even afcends through the bed-clothes\nlike a mitt, in the greateft abundance when we are afleep, and the animal functions\nat reft.\nIn this manner Nature, from all cafual obftruftions, endeavours to relieve hcr-\nfelf; and fo long as difeafes are recent, and of a m;\nld tendency, they are ufually car-\nried off by this means, without requiring any aid from medicine. When, however,\ndifeafes are of long {landing, and the humours in the blood become too foul and vif-\ncous to be thrown off by the bis medicatrix nature, the whole habit is quickly vitiat-\ned, and the circulating mafs becomes morbid j yet even in this infected ftate, the\nvital heat and aftivity of the blood drives to purify itfelf, by determining thefe\nmorbid particles to the {kin, where they form fcabs, ulcers, pimples, and other\nfpots, as in the fcrophula, leprofy, fmall-pox, meartes, fyphilis, &c. orellethe\nvirulent matter is direfted inwards, where falling upon the lungs and other vifeera,\ndeath quickly enfues. Here then we may view the {hocking confequences which\nrefult from thofe, who enter into matrimony under a tainted or infefted ftate of the\nblood. Indeed perfons who are afflicted with the leprofy, fcrophula, or king\u2019s-\nevil, fhould never marry until a perfeft cure has been happily effefted, and a pure\nand healthful ftate of the blood induced. To enter into wedlock under a venereal\ntaint, is a moft unwife, a moft cruel, and an ungenerous, aft. A man, with only a\nflight infeftion, by contaft with the woman, will, himfelf, perhaps, experience a\nperfeft cure, in confequence of the foul and infeftious matter being drawn from the\nparts by the female organs, feconded by the aftion of the rugs and abforbent vef-\nfels on the furface of the vagina. But the unhappy female is fure to take thediforder\n;\nand, fhould ihe prove with child, fhe not only carries the poifonous infeftion into the\nmarrow of her own bones, but brings an infant offspring into the world, devoted to\nmifery and difeafe; for whatever foul or infeftious humour is-iinplanted in the pa-\nrent blood, it is immediately carried by the circulation to the vital organs of the\nchild, juft as the flame of one candle is by contaft communicated to another. Nor\ncan we be furprized at thefe things, if we only refleft on what has already been ad-\nduced, and contemplate the fyftem and oeccnomy of the human frame. Confider\nonly the powerful effects of a few grains of cantharides, which, if externally applied,\naft as a burning cauftic ; but, if taken into the ftomach, inftantly overturn the na-\ntural courfe of the circulation, by forcing the whole mafs of blood into the extre-\nmities, but more particularly, with great vehemence and turgiuity, into the private\nparts *, for which reafon cantharides are taken with intent to cure the weaknefs and\nNo. 2j. 4 U debility\n\fA KEY TO PHYSIC,\n35\u00b0 '\ndebility of the penis ; but the truth is, that greater debility, and an emaciated con-\nftitution, is fure to follow, and not unfrequently inftant death.\nIf, then, fo powerful an effedt can be wrought on the blood by fwallowing a few\nirritating particles of afmall infedl, may we not juftly infer, that by infufmg into\nthe circulating mafs, particles congenial to itfelf, the utmoft relief may be afforded\nto it, even in its moft depraved and inadtive ftate ? From this confideration alone,\nwe may venture to pronounce, that all diforders originating in the blood, might ei-\nther be prevented or repelled, could fuch a medium be difcovered, by which we\nmight infufe, immediately into the mafs, a combination of fuch elemental principles\nas the blood and juices themfelves confift of in their pureft and moft elaftic ftate ;\nfor this, in fadt, is the aim of all medicines \u2022, but which they mifs, by being admi-\nniftered in their grofs form, and being obliged to pafs the feveral digeftive opera-\ntions of the ftomach, before they can reach the blood, whereby the principal part of\ntheir occult virtue is loft among the food, orfecreted in fuch fmall quantities as to\nproduce very little effedt. But a medium, poffeffing thefe congenial principles, rea-\ndy digefted, and fo combined as to be taken inftantly, and without diminution, into\nthe habit, would not only keep the cruor and the ferum in dueproportion, which is fo\neffential to health, but would ftimulate, corredt, purify, and augment, the blood,\nas its reduced or difordered ftate might from time to time require. Such a medium,\nafter infinite labour, and unlimited experience, I pronounce the Solar Tindture to\nbe; and fuch will be found its operative effedts, under whatever circumftances it\nmay be adminiftered, in any climate or feafon ; the innocent and balfamic qualities\nof which are as grateful to the internal organs of the human frame, as the folar rays\nare cheering to the external ; and it affords me no fmall gratification to avow, that,\nin offering it to the public, I invade no man\u2019s property, nor imitate any medicine at\nprelent known in public or private practice, \u2014The experiments I have made with\nit upon a variety of difeafed wretched objedts, exceed belief ; and I fhall ftill con-\ntinue to adminifter it gratis to the poor, who are given over by others, or who have\nnot the means of applying for medical affiftance.\nThe infinite variety of complaints an impure or infedted ftate of the blood indu-\nces, almoft exceeds belief; and hence the new and deceptive forms a fcrophulous\nor fcorbutic taint puts on, which often deceives the moft eminent of the faculty,\nand baffles the belt intention towards a cure. An impure or fcrophulous taint will\ninvade the nobleft organs of the human frame, before the patient can be aware of\nhis danger. In the firft ftageof its vifible effedls, a weary pain feizes the joints and\nmufcles, attended with a wafting of the legs and loins. In the fecond ftagethe\ngums fweil, grow painful, hot, and irritable, and bleed upon the flighteft preffure;\nthe\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 351\nthe roots of the teeth become bare and loofe, and the breath naufeous. In the third\nftage, the gums grow putrid, the teeth black and rotten, the fublingular veins be-\ncome varicofe, and the breath cadaverous ; foetid blood diftils from the lips, gums,\nmouth, nofe, lungs, ftomach, liver, fpleen, pancreas, inteftines, womb, kidneys, &c.\nfcabs and ulcers break out in all parts of the body, and the joints, bones, and vifce-\nra, become morbid. In the fourth ftage, putrid, eruptive, and fpotted, fevers, en-\nfue, which end in an atrophy, or elfe follow diarrheas, dyfentery, dropfy, confump-\ntion, palfy, contrail ions, melancholy, and all the long and direful train of nervous\ndiforders, which to defcribe would fill a volume.\nTocounterafl this mod virulent of all chronic complaints, the utmoft exertions\nof human (kill have been employed. The remedies prefcribed in its different ftages\nare almoft innumerable. The objeil is to reduce the virulence of the infection, and\nto eradicate its feeds from the blood and lymph ; to which end the mildeft and moft\nAmple medicines are recommended. Mineral and tar waters, for their warm and\nftimulating quality; milk or whey, from their fimilitude to the chyle; the cold\nbath, for bracing the folids and quickening the circulation ; antifcorbutic vegeta-\nbles, &c. for purging and fweetening the blood, luch as fcurvy-grafs, water-cref-\nfes, wormwood, hemlock, centaury, vervain, water-trefoil, juniper-berries, the Pe-\nruvian bark, faffafras, guaiacum, aloes, affa-fcetida, camomile, diafcordium, faffron,\nfenna, rhubarb, manna, iEthiop\u2019s mineral, hartflhorn, native cinnabar, antimony,\n&c. When thefe fail, mercury, ora mercurial falivation, is looked upon as the only\ncure ; which, in fa\u00a3t, is but to give the human frame its laft vehement fhock, and to\nfend the wretched patient in agonies to the grave!\nThe intention of all thefe remedies is to impregnate the blood with qualities op-\npofite to thofe with which it is infe&ed ; and this rnuft be done in a fuperior degree\nof force and power, before a cure can be completed. But thefe medicaments are\noften adminiftered under fuch naufeous forms, and in fo crude and unqualified a\nftate, that they not only torture the patient, but mifs entirely their intended aim.\nThe naufeous tafte of medicine is nothing but itsgroffer particles; which, inftead\nof entering the ftomach, to irritate and opprefs its organs, ought to be drawn off\nby chemical procefs ; for it is the occult virtue of every drug, not its groffer part,\nthat performs the cure. Now the peculiar excellence of the Solar Ttndlure is, that\nit combines the effential and occult virtues of all fcorbutic vegetables, ready digeft-\ned, concodled, purified, and refolved into an elegant balfamic effence, pleafing to\nthe tafte and grateful to the ftomach. It flies immediately to the heart, whether\ninternally or externally applied, blends and aflimilates with the venal and arterial\nblood, which it generates, corrtfts, warms, purifier, animates, and impels through\nthe\n\f552 A K E Y T o P H Y S I C,\nthe whole f}dem. It clcanfes all the vifcera, and glandular parts, particularly the\nlungs and kidneys ; dimulates the fibres, whereby thegaftric juice and digeftion\nare promoted ; diffolves vifcid humours, and expels infection. It exerts very con-\nliderable effeds on the whole nervous fyftem, fenfrbly raifes the pulfe, ftrengthens\nthe folids, and invigorates the animal fpirits. It penetrates into the mod intimate\nparts, opens the mouths of the minuter vefiels, reftores the natural perforation, and\npromotes all the fluid fecretions. In every ftage of infedious difeafes, and in all\nfudden epidemical diforders, which ufually follow from a wet, putrid, and unwhole-\nfome, date of the atmofphere, it is an abfolute fpecific ; and, as a preventive, an al-\nterative, and purifier of the blood, it has not its equal in the world. It quickly re-\nlieves every common malady originating in the blood, fuch as relaxations, debili-\nty, laffitude, tremors, finking of the fpirits, and all thofe nervous affedions which\nharrafs and opprefs the weak, fedentary, and delicate; and are often the confe-\nquences of high living and luxuriant indulgences, without bodily exercife and\nfrefh air. In all thefe cafes, the Solar Tindure is calculated to warm and dea-\ndy the cold tremulous nerves ; to fheath and invigorate the mufcular fydem ; to ani-\nmate the fpirits ; and renovate the whole man, whereby the chill watery fluids be-\ncome rich and balfamic, and the circulating mafs refumes its healthful date. It is\nan infallible cure for joint- achs, cramps, fpafms, rheumatic gout, nervous head-\nach, agues, and all diforders arifing from obdruded perfpiration. In complaints of\nthe bread, domach, and bowels, it gives immediate relief ; and, in adhmatic and\nconfumptive cafes, is an elegant and expeditious cure. It will dop mortification in\nvery advanced dages, by expelling the poifonous matter, and correding the juices\nof the whole body. It requires no argument to convince, more than a fingle trial 5\nafter which, I think, no family who value their health or life will chufe to be withr\nout it j particularly under any of the following afflidions\n:\nSCROPHULA, SCURVY, or KING\u2019s-EVIL.\nIN the firftandfecond dages of this diforder, a fmall table-fpoonful of the Tinc-\nture, taken in a wine-glafs of cold fpring- water night and morning, will prevent the\nfurther progrefs of the difeafe, and in a very fhort time redore the blood to its\nhealthful date, the effeds of which will be fo obvious to the patient, that he will be\nat no difficulty when to difcontinue the medicine. In the third dage, it is often re-\nquifite that the medicine be internally and externally applied. The mouth fhould\nbe frequently wafhed with the Tindure diluted in warm-water, and it will very\nfoon expel the poifon from the gums. If the vifcera be in a morbid date, which\nmay\n2\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 353\nmay be known by the excrements, or foulnefs of expectoration, it will be neceflary\nto take the medicine, night and morning, for feveral days, in the quantity of a ta-\nble-fpoonful undiluted ; and, at noon, a table- fpoonful in the fame quantity of warm-\nwater. The fcabs, whether dry or rnoift, fhould be frequently walked with the\nTin&ure, undiluted,\nwhich, being aoforbed by the minuter vefi'els, and taken into\nthe habit, will expel the humour, and clear away the fcurf. If tumours or foul\nulcers occur, walk them frequently with a dilution of the medicine in the fame\nquantity of warm-water, until the heat and virulence be abated; then apply the\nTinfture undiluted^ with lint or fine rags, by which myans the infectious matter will\nbe totally eradicated, the blood and juices purified, and the ulcers healed.\nIn the fourth ftage, whatever may chance to be the fad malady to which the dif-\norder ultimately turns, a ftrift attention to regimen, exercife, and frefk air, as far as\nthe ftrength and condition of the patient will admit, mult be particularly attended\nto. And, in all thefe cafes, the belt and molt fimple methods of treatment are laid\ndown in theMedical Part of this work, p. 168, &c. to which I begleave to refer every\npatient in this dreadful ftage of the difeafe ; and, in aid of the advice there given,\nlet the Solar Tin&ure be regularly perfilted in every night and morning, in the\nquantity of one table-fpoonful in as much warm-water; and, at twelve o\u2019clock at\nnoon, take a table-fpoonful undiluted. ---Let this be continued eight or ten days ;\nthen take a table- fpoonful diluted in warm-water three times a day, morning, noon,\nand night, till the nerves and organs begin to refume their healthful tone; then let\nthe dofes be gradually abated to a fpoonful in water every other morning, which\nfhould be continued till health is perfectly re-eftablifhed ; and which, by God\u2019s\nbleffing, will generally happen, even in thefe defperate cafes, in the courfe of a\nmonth or fix weeks.\u2014 As a preventive of all foul or fcrophulous taints in the habit,\nand as an alterative, and purifier of the blood, it may be occafionally taken every\nother morning for a week together, particularly in the fpring and fall, in the quan-\ntity of a table-fpoonful in a wine-glafs of cold fpring water ; or it may be occafion-\nally taken as a beverage after dinner or fupper, mixed in a tumbler with warm-wa-\nter, and made palatable with fugar. It will be found pleafant to the tafte, and\ngrateful to the ftomach, fuperior to any lpirits, or punch. The many inlfanccs\nof elegant and uncommon cures effected by the Solar Tincture, on perfons of the\nfirft eminence, may be infpe&ed at any time, on application at my houfe. But at the\nparticular requeft of the parties, I have here added the following remarkable\nCASE.\nMr. R. Pinder, of Bramftone, near Bridlington, in Yorkfhire, had been long\naffli&ed with a violent lcorbutic humour in his blood, which threw out fometimes\ndry, and iometimes moift lcabs and tumours on the fkin. Being negle<fted, it at\nNo. 23. 4X length\n\f354 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nlength pervaded the whole fyftem, till turning inwardly, it fell upon his lungs, and\nreduced him to the laft ftage of a confumption. In this deplorable ftate, given\nover by the faculty, left totally emaciated, and incapable of turning in his bed, he\nfortunately had recourfe to the Solar Tincture. The firft dofe was given undiluted,\nwhich threw him into a fine perfpiration, and compofed him to fleep, which had\nlong been a ftranger to his eyes. After one large bottle had been adminiftered\nagreeable to the bill of directions, at the end of a week he was fo much reftored,\nthat with very little afliftance he was enabled to put on his own clothes ; and after\ncontinuing the medicine for little more than a month, he was able to walk abroad.\nAnd now, after having continued the TinCture night and morning, and occafional-\nly ufing it as a beverage made fimilar to warm brandy and water, he has quite reco-\nvered his former health and ftrength; being, to the furprizeof every body who be-\nheld him in his late emaciated condition, as robuft afld as hearty as it is well pof-\nfible for a man to be.\nDEBILITATED, TAINTED, and ENFEEBLED, CONSTITUTIONS.\nMUSCULAR debility was a misfortune but little known to our forefathers.\nWhether immured in venereal embraces, or facrificing at the lhrine of Bacchus,\nmoderation and feafonable hours directed the meafure of their enjoyment. If re-\nvelry or voluptuoufnefs by chance unftrung their nerves, gymnaftic exercifes and\nfield fports, or the more pleafurable delights of the chace, quickly reftored them to\ntheir proper tone,\u2014gave new vigour to the blood,\u2014health to the cheek,\u2014and\nlighted up afrelh the flame of love. But now, how ftrange is the reverfe. Ha-\nbituated to effeminacy, and fed w'ith dainties,\u2014revelling all night with wine, and\nftretcht on beds of down all day,\u2014ftiut up in ftews and brothels, fcarcely breath-\ning wholefome air,\u2014 clafpt in the arms of tainted or difeafed females, until enjoy-\nment palls upon the fenfes* and the mufcular powers abfolutely refufe their office,\nno wonder fo many men are found old in every thing but years; whofe conftitu-\ntions are fairly worn down, blood ftagnant, folids relaxed, fecretions diverted from\ntheir proper courfe, mufcles debilitated, eyes funk, palid cheek, and fpirits gone.\nThefe are not half the evils refulting from this fafhionable fource of deftruClive\nfolly. It may not be amifs, however, to defcribe the remarkable cafes of a few, of\nwhom the Solar Tinfture has made perfect cures, by infufing a new portion of\nhealth into the mafs of blood ; fincerely hoping, that a more wife and manly courfe\nof life will Ihortly eradicate thefe difgraceful complaints, and reftoreto the ladies a\ngenuine race of Englifhmen and Britons.\nCASES.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 355\nCASES.\nPrematurf. Debility.\u2014 A gentleman in the army, under thirty years of age,\ncomplained to me that he had all at once become iyicapable cf enjoying bis wife. Suf-\npecting the nature of his diforder, I defired him to be open and candid, to relate to\nme his real fituation, and not a pretended one, which was only to impofe on his own\nunderftanding. He thanked me for the rebuke\u2014 -faid he would be frank, and in few\nwords declared, That from excefiive lull, and continual debauch, he had loll his\nvirility; and, to add to the misfortune, he was on the eve of being married. In\nother refpeCts he felt no diminution in his health or conflitution ; and from exter-\nnal appearances, this was furely the lafb imperfection that could have been fufpefl-\ned. His complexion was vigorous and lively, his flefh firm, and conformation ex-\ncellent; yet, notwithftanding this, he was impotent to fuch a degree, that neither\nthe (Length of his own defires, nor the excitations of the female, could afftCl the\npart. It often happens, that though the organs remain found, yet if the nervous\nand feminal fluids have degenerated from a healthful (late\u2014if they are impoveriffi-\ned by being too much drained, or turned into an unnatural courfe, they cannot then\nperform their office, by reafonthat their moving powers and (limulus on the blood,\nare become too weak to direCl their force and a&ion in the manner nature requires\nin the a<5t of copulation. I therefore enjoined him, to abftain entirely from all at-\ntempts of the kind, for three months at lead ; directed the ointment as in p. 240 of\nthe Medical Part of this work, with the Solar TinClure three times a-day for two\nmonths; then twice a-day, until he found it no longer neceflfary. After taking fix\nlarge bottles, he generoufly thanked me for a more hale and robuft (late of body,\nthan he ever remembered to have enjoyed before. He has fincefent me feveral pa-\ntients, in almofl: as debilitated a (late as himfelf, who are now ready ro unite with\nhim in giving full tellimony to the renovating powers and peculiar efficacy of the\nSolar TinCture.\nA RELAXED HABIT.\nLITTLE more than three months ago, a gentleman, about fifty years of age, lately-\nreturned from the Eaft-Indies, applied to me for the cure of what he termed a broken\nconjlitution. He had made very free with the fable beauties of Bengal,\u2014 had un-\ndergone a mercurial lalivation, and appeared to be finking under an univerfal lan-\nguor and debility of the whole mufcular fyftem. The fphinCter of the bladder was\nfo weakened, that the urinary fecretion came from him by drops, in fo perpetual and\ninvoluntary a manner, as not to be perceived until the moifture of one fet of cloths\nbecame fo fenfibly affliCting, as made it neceftary to fupply frefn ones, which ufual-\niy\n\f35& A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nly happened every hour. The corporeal fundions were diffipated and relaxed, the\ntone of the ftomach and vifeera was nearly gone, the tremulous nerves reludantly\nperformed their office, and the circulation was become ftagnant and morbid. I\nadvifed an immediate recourfe to the moll nourifhing food, with ftrong port-wine\nnegus for his drink, and the Solar Tindure, to be taken four times a-day for the\nfirft month \u2022, three times a-day for the fecond month, and once or twice a-day after-\nwards, asoccafion might feem to render neceffary. Before the expiration of twenty\ndays, the fphinder mufcle acquired its proper tone, the pulfe became ftrong and\nregular, and the nervous tremors were confiderably abated. By the end of the fe-\ncond month, a renovation of the whole animal oeconomy feemed to have taken\nplace, and a vifible accumulation of the blood and juices had retrieved the circu-\nlation. Before the expiration of three months, I had the gratification to fee this\npatient completely reftored to fuch a ftate of bodily health and ftrength, as utterly\naftoniffied himfelf, after taking only eight large bottles of the Solar Tindure.\nHYPOCHONDRIACAL DEBILITY, or WEAK NERVES.\nA GENTLEMAN in Oxfordlhire lately came to town on purpofe to confult me\nin this complaint. He appeared to be near thirty years of age, of middling ftature,\nbut of a weakly conftitution. He had for upwards of feven years paft paid his addref-\nfes to a lady, whom he had long promifed, and very much defired, to marry, but\nwhenever he propofed in his mind to fix the day, or whenever it happened that he\nattempted to falute or embrace her, he was feized with an unaccountable tremor of\nthe whole body, his fpirits funk, his virility left him, and a violent palpitation of\nthe heart enfued. In ffiort, he was fo diftruftful of his own powers, that he confef-\nfed it was the fear of not being able to perform the rites of the marriage-bed, that\nhad been the only, and the foie caufe, of thus protrading his wedding-day. This\nis certainly a moft fingular inftance of the hypochondriacal affedion, and of its de-\nrangement of the nervous fyftem. The debility induced by it, feems to arife from\nthe weaker energy of the brain, the fault of which however, cannot be deteded by\nthe niceft anatomift. For this reafon, we do not well know how fuch deled fhould be\nreftored-, butas nature, feemingly for this purpofe, excites the motion of the heart and\narteries, we rnuft aferibe the continuance of fuch debility to the too weak readion\nof the fanguiferous fyftem. The heart will generally palpitate from a violent ex-\ncitement of the nerves, efpecially when the blood is endowed with too fmall a fhare\nof ftimulus. Hence palpitation from any affedion of the mind, and from hyfterics\nin women. Under whatever circumftances this hypochondriacal affedion happens,\nit debilitates the whole animal machine, and renders the perfon unable to perform\nthe proper offices of life. The proftration of fpirits, weaknefs, and languor, are\n\u201e often\n\f357\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\noften furprifingly great, though the pulfefeem? tolerably ftrong, as being heightened\nby animal defire. The effect, however, is lure to produce a languid circulation,\nthe blood feeming to adhere, with uncommon energy, about the region of the\nheart. I fufpedt it is in thefe cafes that cantharides arc moll; frequently ulcd- The\npatient acknowledged, after fome helitation, that he had tried them ; but they only\nproduced an involuntary, though violent ereclion, by no means adapted to the cure,\nnor to the purpofe he intended. Hence this remedy is not only inadequate, but\nextremely dangerous \u2022, for it too much exhaufts the vital powers, and is followed\nby a vaft deje&ion of lpirics, tremors, ftartings of the tendons, See. which bring\non rigours, cold clammy fweats, fyncope, and premature death.\nThe means, therefore, which nature points out for the cure of this fpecies of de-\nbility, are directed to fupport and increafe the action of the blood through the\nheart and arteries ; and the remedies to be employed are tonics and ftimulants. Of\nall the ftimulants, which in this conftitutional defett, may be advantageoufly em-\nployed, port-wine feems to be the mod eligible. It has the advantage of being\ngrateful to the palate and ftomach, and of having its ftimulant parts fo much\ndiluted, that it can be conveniently given at all times and feafons, and may\nbe employed with fufficient caution; but it is of little ferviceunlefs taken pretty\nlargely.\u2014 It may be fufpedted that wine has an operation analogous to that of opium;\nand on good grounds. But we can diftinctly mark its ftimulant power only ;\nwhich renders its effects in the phrenitic delirium manifeftly hurtful; but in cales\nof debility as remarkably ufeful.\u2014Hence I directed the Solar Tinfture to be taken\nmorning, noon, and night, in ftrong dofes, for the firft month ;\nonce a day, or\noftener, at the diferetion of the patient, until the end of the third month ; but to\ndrink every day after dinner, a pint of generous port; and to inform me at intervals\nthe change he might find in his conftitution. He took with him a dozen large\nbottles of the Solar Tin&ure, and before a month elapfed, I had the pleafure of\nreceiving an epiftle of unfeigned thanks. He found himfclf fo much reftored by\nthe courfe I laid him under, that, before the expiration of the three months, he\nmarried the lady ; and 1 have no doubt will very fhortly have ifTue. \u2014I have been\nfomewhat more elaborate in deferibing the particulars of this cafe, having reafon to\nbelieve it is not an uncommon malady, and would therefore ~wifh to enable every\npatient to become as much as pofiible a judge of his own infirmity.\nNOCTURNAL EMISSIONS, or INCONTINENCE of the SEMEN.\nA YOUNG man, of robuft make, and in the prime of life, being under twenty-\nfix years of age, applied to me for relief in the above unfortunate complaint. It\nappeared, that, from the time of puberty, he had found a weaknefs in the part, and\nNo. 23. '\n4 Y\nI\nan\n\f$53 A K E Y T O P H Y S 1 C,\nan occafional difcharge of the feed, upon the flighteft irritation. As he grew up\nto greater maturity, the malady increafed upon him. Upon every attempt to have\ncontact with a female, the femen palled involuntarily from him, before even a com-\nplete eredion could take place, whereby his purpofe was continually defeated.\nThis defed grew upon him, until the bare fight or thought of anything which\ntended to excite venereal defires, brought away the feed ; yet it had no affinity\nwhatever to a gleet, becaufe the emifiion never occurred but either in the attempt,\nor in the defire, of copulation ; or under the influence of lafcivious dreams. In\nproportion as this weaknefs grew upon him, his defire of familiarity with the fex\nbecame the ftronger ; and, I am inclined to think, was the principal reafon of the\nencreafe of the malady, and of the nodurnal emifiions, which happened more or lefs\nevery time he went to deep. This incellant difcharge had reduced him to a meagre\nvifage, fallow complexion, hollow eyes, depreftion of fpirits, and flow fever; and\na galloping conlumption would foon have followed. I direded the Solar Tinc-\nture every morning at fun-rifing, at mid-day, and at fix o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\nin the quantity of a wine-glafs full, with one third warm water ; and every night\nat going to bed, twenty drops of liquid laudanum, for the purpofe of making his\ndeep too ftrong to be affeded by the influence of dreams. This courfe, aflifted by\na ftrengthening regimen of calf\u2019s- foot jelly, veal-broth, and ftrong port-wine\nnegus, had very quickly the defired effect. His deep was perfectly found and calm,\nand, after the fir ft night, he could not recoiled the return of any nodurnal emif-\niion. The ftrengthening ointment, direded in page 240 of the Medical Part of\nmy work, was ufed every other morning, and within the fpace of only two months,\nthe feminal veffels were completely braced up, and the diforder fo totally removed,\nas not to leave a Angle fymptom of his former weaknefs.\nONANISM.\nA YOUTH, apparently under age, applied to me for the cure of a diforder,\nwhich, he Paid, had deprived him of the power of eredion, and of ail fenfation in\nthe privities. In fo young a fu\u2019ojed, I could not fuppofe this want of tone to arife\nfrom a general debility of the nervous fyftem, particularly as no other fymptoms\nwarranted the conclufion. I had a ftrong fufpicion it was the effed of Onanifm, or\nfecret venery, which ufually ends in this fpecies of abfolute impotency ;\nbut this he\ndenied. He told me he had fome time ago contraded the foul diftemper, and\nthrough fhame, and the dread of its coming to the knowledge of his friends, he\nhad negleded to difclofe his misfortune to any perfon, until the prefent malady was\nbrought on. Of the foul diftemper, however, I could find no other fymptom than\na, Ample gleet ;\nand, upon putting the neceffary queftions, not a fingle reply corre-\n3\nfponded\n\/\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 359\nfyonded with the ulual efTc<fts of that diforder. After half an hour\u2019s clofe exami-\nnation, I brought him to confefs what I above fufpefted, that he had fo much\naddi&ed himfelf to this fhameful and deftruftive vice, that the feminal veffels were\ncompletely related ; the ereiftories, the nerves, and glans, of the penis, had entirely\nloll their tone \u2022, an involuntary discharge of the fe men, without irritation, or tur-\ngidityof the parts, had long taken place, and brought on a want of appetite, an\nimpoverilhed date of the blood, and an univerfal latitude of the body. The lec-\nture I gave him upon this occafion, will never, I truft, be effaced from his memory-,\nand he has fince faithfully promifed that it fhall not. I dire&ed the ftrengthening\nelectuary and ointment, in page 239 and 240 of the Medical Part of this Work, to\nbe tiled as, therein prelcribed j then to take, four times a day, a table fpoonful of\nthe Solar Tintture in an equal quantity of warm water, for a month at lead ; then\nthree times a day for the fecond month, and twice a day, in cold fpring water, for\nthe two months following ; which gradually coiled up the debilitated parts, gave\nelafticity to the blood, retrieved the fenfation of toe glans, and the l'ympathetic\noffice of the erehtories, braced the nerves, ligaments, and tendons, and gave that\ndue tone and energy to the mufcular fyftem, which in lei's than four months reftored\nthe patient to perfedl health and vigour.\nAn IMPURE or TAINTED HABIT.\nTHIS malady, fo common among our diffipated youth, generally arifes from a\nvenereal complaint badly cured. Indeed the lchrophula, the king\u2019s evil, the\nleprofy, and other foul humours, when too long fuffered to prey upon the blood,\nw ill naturally induce this confequence-, yet ninety-nine cafes out of every hundred,\nare found to refult from the improper ufe of mercury, either taken too abun-\ndantly into the ft omach, or too often applied externally, in the venereal diieale. A\ngentleman in the militia very lately came to me under this misfortune, who had\nabfolutely worn down the organs of his ftomach by taking medicines for its cure,\nwithout obtaining the fmalleft relief. He was no fooner warm in bed, than deep-\nfeated nocturnal pains attacked his arms, fhins, and head, which many of the faculty\nmiftook for rheumatiim. The membranes, mufeies, and ligaments of the jo nts,\nwere lcarceever rree from pain ; whilft carious ulcers occafionally broke out upon\nthe ulna, tibia, and bones of the cranium. Thele fymptoms had allb deceived\nfeveral of the faculty, who, taking his complaint to be a confirmed lues, ftili added\nto the malady, by loading him with frefh doles of mercury. The truth is, that\nthis dilorder was by no means of a venereal nature, but was rather the confequence\nof the remedy, than of the diieafe, fince it aroie entirely from the long and repeated\ndofes of mercury his body had fuftained, and which was grounded in his habit by\nfalivation.\n\f3&> A K E Y TO PHYSIC,\nfalivation. The mercury had infinuated itfelf into the marrow of his bones, had\nvitiated every fluid fecretion, and tainted the very air he breathed. Under fuch cir-\ncumftances I will allow, it is very difficult, if not almoft impoffible, for a phyfi-\ncian, upon a fuperficial infpedtion, abfolutely to decide, whether th<? original difeafe\nhath been altogether overcome; yet fu rely he ought attentively to diftinguifh and\nconfider the feveral fymptoms apart ; and then, by comparing them with each othef,\na clear judgment may be formed upon the general review. Finding, by this method,\nthe real ftate of the patient\u2019s cafe, I ordered him a nourifhing diet, gentle exercife,\nand an abfolute denial of the fmalleft intercourfe with woman. To this he readily\nfubmitted, putting himfelf under a regular courfe of the Solar Tindture, which he\ntook three times a day, in the quantity of a wine-glafis three parts full, filled up\nwith warm water, for the firft month. At the expiration of this time he paid me a\nvifit, when his company was infinitely more agreeable,\nbecaufe the pleafing afpedt of\nhealth had fuperfeded the naufeous effluvia of his difeafe I now only enjoined him\nto follow the fame regimen and abfiemious mode of living for a month or two longer,\ntaking the Tindture diluted in a glafs of cold fpring water once or twice a day, as\nhe might find himfelf inclined. This he rigidly actended to ; and I have now the\npleafure to declare, that only nine large bottles of the Solar Tindture, have reftored\nthis gentleman from the mod dangerous and deplorable ftateof a tainted and cor-\nrupted habit, to found health, and a renovated ftate of the blood and juices.\nA TAINTED HABIT in a STATE of PREGNANCY.\nTHIS is the mod fhocking cafe my pradtice or experience ever produced. The\npatient was taken in labour, and in the add of parturition, the child prefented its\nright arm, which feparated from the body, while the operator was returning it into\nthe womb. The life of the mother being defpaired of, I was fent for ; when, on\ninfpedfcion, I quickly perceived conception had taken place under an infedted ftate\nof one of the parents. I performed the refidue of the operation myfelf, and brought\naway the foetus without a farther feparation of the joints, but with great difficulty,\nfince it was ulcerated and half rotten with difeafe. By a mod tender and judicious\ntreatment of the woman, affifted by the Lunar Tindture, her life was preferved ;\nand in the fpace of five weeks Ihe appeared to have regained her health and ftrength ;\nwhen, to the aftonilhment of every one, Ihefell into a violent falivation. Being\nlent for upon this Angular occafion, I thought it right to interrogate the hufband ;\nwhen, after a vaft deal of hefitation and diffembling, he confeffed having had con-\nnedtion with his wife under a venereal infedlion ; and with a view to prevent the\nconfequences, he had prevailed on her tofwallow ftrong dofes of mercury, which 1\nhave reafon to fuppofe lay dormant in the body until after her delivery; when the\nefforts\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 361\nefforts of nature being no longer diretted to the preservation of the child, fuff.\u2019red\nthe mercury to attack the falival glands, and to produce the efiocl we have jud\ndeferibed, I ordered her a fpare, but nourifhing diet-, worked off the merdury in\nthe cudomary way, and then began a courfe of theSoiar I inCturc. A table fpoon-\nful, in an equal quantity of warm water, was taken four times a day for the lull\nweek ; then three times a day until the end of the month-, afterwards twice a day\nin cold fpring water for a month longer-, and then once or twice a clay, or every\nother clay, as the patient found convenient -, by this means Hie happily experienced\na complete cure in lefs than three months, and now enjoys a perfect ffate of health,\ndefirous of certifying the fadt to any unfortunate female, who, under fimilar circum-\nftances, withes to call upon me for that purpofe. Indeed every woman, who has\nthe misfortune to fufpedt even the fmalled taint of a fimilar nature to be lurking\nin her blood, fhould put herlelf under a courfe of the Solar Tincture, and perfilt\nin it every night and morning, in the quantity of a table fpoonful diluted in a wine-\nglafs of cold fpring water, during the whole nine months date of pregnancy.\nThe above cafe brings to my recollection a very fingular inftance of an accidental\nfalivation, broucht upon a young lady by a foreign fubdance irritating one of the\nparotid glands; the particulars of which I fhall here infert for the fake of thole\nwho may happen to be under fimilar circumttances.-\u2014 111 the month of April, 1751,\na young lady about the age of fixteen years, of a delicate habit, but fubjedt to no\nparticular complaints, perceived the beginning of a difeafe which afterwards proved\nmod obdinate and loathfome, viz. an inceffant fpitting. The quantity of this dif-\ncharge was different at different times, varying from one pint to two pints and a\nhalf in twenty-four hours. As to its quality, it feemed to be no other than the\nordinary fecretion of the falival glands. By fo large and condant an evacuation,\nher drength became extremely impaired, and the mod efficacious medicines had\nproved ui'elefs. She had taken large quantities of the Peruvian bark, both alone\nand combined with preparations of iron: and afterwards the fetid gums, opium,\namber, alum, and the Neville-Holt-water, had in fucceffion been given her. In\nthe mean time an exact regimen had been preferibed : (he had been ordered to ride\ncondantly ; and to confine herfelf to a mucilaginous diet, fuch as veal, calves\u2019 feet,\n\u00a3cc. Likewife a gently-opening medicine had now and then been interpofed. The\ndifeafe dill continued unaltered -,\nfhe had afterwards tried the tinRura Jatumina\\\nand had, at the fame time, been encouraged to chew the Peruvian bark, and to\nfwallow the faliva. But all thefe attempts had been vain ; and after fhe had taken\nfome or other of the medicines above mentioned until the end of September, 1753,\nnamely, above two years, it appeared to her phyfician. Sir George Baker, 'unrea-\nsonable to expedl relief in fuch a cafe from any internal medicines whatever. He\nNo. 23. 4 Z now\n\fA KEY TO PHYSIC,\n362\nnow conceived a fufpicion, that fome extraneous body, having accidentally found its\nway into the meatus auditorms^ might poffibly be the caufe of this extraordinary\nfecretion, by keeping up a continued irritation in the parotid glands. With this\nview he examined her ears, and extracted from them a quantity of fetid wool.\nHow, or when, it came thither, no account could be given. To this fubftance he\nattributed the beginning of the falivation, notwithftanding that the difeafe did not\nimmediately abate on the removal of the wool ;\nas it appeared to be no improbable\nfuppofition that the difcharge might be continued by the force of habit, though\nthe original caufe no longer remained. It feemed therefore expedient to introduce\nfome other habit, in the place of the increafed fecretion of faliva ; which habit\nmight afterwards be gradually left off. With this intention, he prevailed on the\npatient to chew perpetually a little dry bread, and to fwallow it with her fpittle. In\na few weeks, it became neceffary for her to chew the bread only at certain hours in\nthe day ; and thus, after two months, fhe became entirely free from a moil difgufl-\nful and tedious diforder. \u2014It is worthy of obfervation, that, at firft, the fwallow-\ning of fo much faliva frequently occafioned a naufea-, and that then, for a few\nhours, fhe was obliged to to fpit it out as ufuaU and that, during the greateft part\nof the time, when fhe chewed the bread, fhe had a flool or two every day more\nthan common.\nTABES DORSALIS, or CONSUMPTION of the BACK.\nA YOUNG gentleman, twenty-two years of age, applied to me in the above\ndiforder, which had worn him down to a mere fkeleton. The Tabes isfeldom dif-\ntinguifhed by any remarkable fever, cough, or difficulty of breathing \u2022, but is attend-\ned with want of appetite, a weak digeftion, and a morbid ftateof the blood, whence\nthe body grows languid, and waftes by degrees. Sometimes this fpecies of con-\nfumption is brought on by a venereal ulcer ; but it molt commonly proceeds from\nexceffive evacuations of the femen, which was the cafe with this r\npatient. He had\ntoo early addicted himfelf to an intercourfe with lewd women, which eventually\n\"brought on an involuntary fhedding of the feed, which came from him on the leaft\nexertion, whether of walking, riding, lifting a weight, or even of pulling off his\nclothes.\u2014 I ordered him a ftrcng nutritious diet, with a table fpoonful of the Solar\nTin&ure four times a day, 'in the fame quantity of warm water, which he purfued\nfor a month. He found his ftrength was fo much recovered, that I could fafely\nadvife moderate exercife both on horfeback and on foot. The gleet, however, was\nuncommonly obftinate-, and the Tincture was continued for the fecond month in\nthe fame quantity. By this time the parts were confiderably braced ; he could run,\nor jump without perceiving the fmalleft emiffion j\nand the healthful colour of his\ncheek\n\fAND OCCULT C C I \u00a3 N C \u00a3. 363\ncheek began to return.\u2014 He now perfifted in the Tindture, only three times a day,\nfor a month longer -,\nafter which the dofe was reduced to night and morning for\nanother month ; he then took it twice a day for two months more, at the end of which\nperiod every fymptom of the complaint was removed, he had fully recovered his\nflefli and ftrength, and now prcferves it by taking the bolar Tindlure as a beverage,\nmade after the manner of brandy and water. Thisdilorder has in general been\ndeemed incurable. It is true, that even in its early attacks, it is fo eflentially necef-\nfary to abftain from venereal embraces, that without it, the belt remedies will\nprove altogether ufelefs; hence the Tabes Dorfalis fo often proves mortal, becaufe\nthe patient has l'eldom refolution enough to dilpenlc with hts amours.\nRHEUMATIC GOUT.\nA ... 4\nTHIS difeafe is generally brought on by alternate heats and colds in the blood,\nwhereby a humour is produced which attacks the joints and mufcles, fometimes ac-\ncompanied with difcolourations and fwellings, and at other times without either\nbut it is always attended with excruciating pain. Mr. John Brandham, of Brid-\nlington Quay, was attacked in this manner ; when, after lome time, the fevere pain\nof his joints falling into his legs and thighs, deprived him of the ufe of his limbs,\nand confined him entirely to his bed. He was foon after icized with a violent pain\nin his head and ftomach, which fo much affected his refpiration, that inftant death\nwas expected. In this extremity, half a wine-glafs of the Solar Tindhure was admi-\nniftered, undiluted,\nwhich removed the danger, and gave his ftomach immediate\neafe. A table fpoonful, in the fame quantity of warm water, was then given every\nthird hour, during the fucceeding day and night, by whic-h the pains were con-\nfiderably abated. He continued the medicine four times a day for a month longer j\nat the expiration of which time he experienced a perfect cure, and lias never fince\nfound the fmalleft return of his complaint \u2022, of which he is defirous of fatisfying\nany enquirer, who chufes to apply for that purpoie.\nAGUES, CONVULSIONS, CHOLIC, BLOODY-FLUX, and violent\nSPASMS in the STOMACH and BOWELS.\nDURING the fit, letoneortwo table fpoonfuls of theSolar Tindlure, undiluted, be\nadminiftered fucceffively, as the extremity of the cafe may require-, and afterwards\nlet the patient continue the medicine, night and morning, in the quantity of a table\nfpoonful in a wine-glafs of warm water, or oftener, as the obftinacy of the cafe may\nrender neceffary, and in a very fhort time a perfedt cure will be experienced ;\na few\ninftances of which I fhall add, in the words of thofe who have tranfmitted me the\nfadts.\nTo\n\f3^4 A K E Y TO PHYSIC,\n-\n'\n:\n1\nTo E..SIBLY, M.

Imprefled, therefore, with\nafenfeof gratitude to God and you, and having a certain knowledge of many\nother cures performed by your Tincture, I do hereby requeft this may be made\npublic for the benefit of the afflibted, and am with efteem, &c.\nBorough,\nSouthwark,\nMarch 10, 1794. W. YfOOLLEY, M. A,\nBILE ON THE STOMACH.\nALL bilious complaints are removed by the Solar Tinfture in a mofi: extraordi-\nnary manner. Whenever a fit appears to be coming on, with the ftomach loaded\nand oppreffed, one large table-fpoonful, taken in the fame quantity of warm water,\nwill in ten minutes carry off the offending matter, ckanfe and comfort the digeftive\norgans, and give the patient immediate relief.\nBITE of a MAD DOG, or any VENOMOUS REPTILE,\nTHE fatal difeafe confequent on the Bite of a Mad Dog, is the Hydrophobia, or\ndread of water which circumftance firft fuggefted dipping in the fea for the cure.\nIt is very remarkable that thefe patients have not only a dread of water, butof every\nthing bright or tranfparent. Soon after this affettion takes place, the mind be-\ncomes impaired j\nwhich (hews that the poifon is carried through the blood to the\nnervous fluid, and thence to the brain. Dr. James, in hisTreatife on Canine Mad-\nnefs, mentions a boy fent out to fill two bottles with water, who was fo terrified by\nthe noife of the liquid running into them, that he fled into the houfe crying out\nthat he w^s bewitched. He mentions alfo the cafe of a farmer, who, going to draw\nfome ale from a calk, was terrified tofucha degree at its running into the veflel, that\nhe ran out in a great haftewith the fpigot in his hand. But in whatever manner\nthis fymptom comes on, it is certain that the molt painful fenfations accompany\nevery attempt to fwallow liquids. Nay, the bare fight of water, of a looking-glafs,\nof any thing clear or pellucid, will give the utmoft uneafinefs, or even throws the\npatient into convulfions. In this difeafe there feems to be an extreme fenfibility\nand irritability of the nervous fyftem. The eyes cannot bear the light, or the fight\nof any thing white \u2022, the lead touch or motion offends them, and they want to be\nkept as quiet and in as dark a place as poflible. Some complain of the coldnefs of\nthe air, frequently when it is really warm. Others complain of violent heat; and\nhave a great defire for cold air, which yet never fails to increafe the fymptoms. In\nall there is a great flow of the faliva into the mouth ; which is exceedingly trouble-\nlome to the patients, as it has the fame effedt upon their fauces that other liquids\n0 have.\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. *67\nhave. This therefore they perpetually blow off with violence, which in a patient\nof Dr. Fothergill\u2019s occafioned a noife not unlike tiie h.llow barking of a dog, and\nwhich he conjectures might have given rile to the common notion that hydropho-\nbious patients bark like dogs. They have an infat iable thirft ; but are unable to get\ndown any drink, except with the utmoft difficulty, though fometimes they can\nfwallow bread foaked in liquids, dices of oranges, or other fruits. There is a pain\nunder the fcrobiculus cordis, as in the tetanus; and the patients mournfully point to\nthat place as the feat of the difeafe. Dr. Vaughan is of opinion that it is this pain,\nrather than any difficulty in lwallowing, which diftreffes the patient on every at-\ntempt to drink. The voice is commonly plaintive and mournful; but Dr. Vaughan\ntells us there is a mixture of fiercenefs and timidity in the countenance which he\ncannot delcribe, but by which he could know a hydrophobious perfon without afk-\ning any queftions. Some feem to have at times a furious delirium, and an inclina-\ntion to fpit at or bite the by-ftanders ; while others ffiow no l'uch inclination, but\nwill even fuffer people to wipe the infideof their mouths with the corner of a hand-\nkerchief in order to clear away the vilcid faliva which is ready to fuffocate them.\nIn fome male patients there is an involuntary ereiflion of the penis, and emiffion of\nthe femen ;\nand the urine is forced away by the frequent return of the fpafms. In a\nletter from Dr. Wolf, of Warfaw, to Henry Baker, F. R. S. dated Warfaw, Sept.\n26th, 1767, we have the following melancholy account of the cafes of five perfons\nwho died of the hydrophobia : None of them quite loft their right fenfes ; but they\nwere all talking without intermiffion, pray ing, lamenting, defpairing, curling, fight\ning, fpitting a frothy faliva, lcreeching, fometimes belching, and retching, but rare-\nly vomiting. Every member is convulfed by fits, but moft violently from the na-\nvel up to the breaft and osfophagus. The fit comes on every quarter of an hour;\nthe fauces are not red, ncr the tongue dry. The pulie is not ar all feveriffi ; and\nwhen the fit is over nearly like a found pulfe. The face grows pale, then brown,\nand during the fit almoft black ; the lips livid; the head is drowfy, and the ears\ntingling ;\nthe urine limpid. At laft they grow weary ; the fits are lefs violent, and\nceafe towards the end ; the pulfe becomes weak, intermittent, and not very quick ;\nthey fweat, and at laft the whole body becomes cold. They compofe themfelves\nquietly as if to get deep, and fo they expire. A general obfervation was, that the\nlint and dreffings of the wounds, even when dry, were always black, and that when\nthe pus was very good in colour and appearance. In one of Dr. Wolf\u2019s patients\nwho recovered, the blood ftunk intolerably as it was drawn from a vein ; and one\nof Mr. Vaughan\u2019s patients complained of an intolerable foetid fmell proceeding\nfrom the wounded part, though nobody but himfelf could perceive it. In general,\nthe violent convulfions ceafe afhort time before death ;\nand even the hydrophobia\ngoes\n\f368 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\ngoes off, fo that the patients can drink freely. But this does not always happen ; for\nMr. Vaughan mentions the cafe of a patient, in whom, \u201c when he had in appearance\nceafed to breathe, the fpafmus cynicus was obfervable, with an odd convulfive mo-\ntion in the mufcles of the face-, and the ftrange contrariety which took place in the\nadtion of thefe produced the moft horrid affemblage of features that can well be\nconceived. Of this patient alfo it was remarkable, that in the laft hours of his life\nhe ceafed to call for drink, which had been his conftant requeft; but was perpetual-\nly afking for fomething to eat.\u201d\nThe hydrophobia feems to be a fymptom peculiar to the human race ; for the\nmad animals which communicate the infedtion, do not feem to have any dread of\nwater. Notwithftanding this, dipping is the common remedy for the cure of dogs\nand men. With regard to the fymptoms of madnefs in dogs, they are very equivocal\n;\nand thofe particularly enumerated by fome authors, are only fuch as might be ex-\npected in dogs much heated or agitated by being violently purfued and (truck.\nOne fymptom indeed, if it could be depended upon, would determine the matter\n;\nnamely, that all other dogs avoid and run away from one that is mad; and even\nlarge dogs will not attack one of the fmalleft fize who is infedted with this difeafe.\nUpon this fuppofition they point out a method of difcovering whether a dog who\nhath been killed was really mad or not; namely, by rubbing apiece of meat\nalong the infide of his mouth, and then offering it to a found dog. If the latter eats\nit, it is a fign the dog was not mad ; but if the other rejedts it with a kind of howl-\ning noife, it is certain that he was. Dr. James tell us, that among dogs the difeafe\nis infedlious by ftaying in the fame place; and that after a kennel has been once in-\nfedted, the dogs put into it will be for a confiderable time afterwards in danger of\ngoing mad alfo. A remedy for this, he fays, is, to keep geefe for fome time in the\nkennel. He rejedts as falfe the opinion that dogs when going mad will not bark\n;\nthough he owns that there is a very confiderable change in their bark, which be-\ncomes hoarfe and hollow.\nWith regard to the immediate caufe among mankind, there is not the leaft doubt\nthat the hydrophobia is occalioned by the faliva of the mad animal being mixed\nwith the blood. It does not appear that this can operate through the cuticula ; but,\nwhen that is rubbed off, the fmalleft quantity is fufficient to communicate the dif-\neafe, and a flight lcratch with the teeth of a mad animal has been found as perni-\ncious as a large wound. It is certain alfo, that the infedtion has been communicated\nby the bites of dogs, cats, wolves, foxes, weafels, fwine, and even cocks and hens,\nwhen in a ftate of madnefs. But it does not appear that the diftemper is communi-\ncable from one hydrophobious perfon to another, by means of the bite, or any\nother way.\nIt\n\fand occult science. 369\n4\nIt has been generally allowed by pradlitioners, that though the hydrophobia may\nbe prevented, yet it can feldom be cured after the difeafc has made its appearance.\nThe molt eflential part of the treatment therefore depends on an immediate ule of\nthe proper means of prevention. For this purpofe fome advife the inftant cutting\nout the part bitten, which mutt certainly be an effiedtual mode, provided we could\nbe fure the poil'on had not reached beyond the wound. When, however, we con-\nfider the rapidity with which the blood and juices tlow, it feems impoflible we can\never wholly depend on fuch an operation. 1 fhould neverthelefs advife it to le\ndone ;\nalter which let the part be well foaked with the Solar 1 incture j and, to for-\ntify the blood, let the patient immediately fwallow a table fpoonful every three hours\nundiluted,\nfor the firft day j and the fame dole night and morning, for a month fol-\nlowing. Let the part be again foaked with the Tindlure four times a day, for three\nor four days \u2022, and I am fatisfied a fafe and perfedl cure may be relied on. For the\nbice of adders, fnakes, &c. bathing the part, and raking the medicine undiluted, will\ncounteradt the virulence of the poil'on, and preferve the patient from further injury.\nFor GUN-SHOT WOUNDS, CUTS, STABS, Szc.\nGENTLEMEN in the army and navy, and all perfons liable to gun-fhots, ftab?\nwounds, &rc. fhould never be without the Solar Tindlure. Its falutary effcdls on\nthe blood, in all thefe cafes, are really furprifing. It totally prevents, and will even\nflop, mortification, in very advanced ftages. It quickly lupplies the greatefl lols of\nblood ;\nfortifies the heart, cherifhes the vital organs, and heals and unites the fic-fh\nin an uncommon degree. If taken internally, and poured at the fame time into the\nwound, it is quickly propelled through the heart, by the veins and arteries, and\nthus renovates the exhaufled fpirits, and prelerves life. Its eftcdl on a few fimple\nwounds may be feen in the following cafes.\nTo E. S I B L Y, M. D.\nSIR,\u2014For the fake of thofe who are liable to accidents, I think it right to inform you\nof a mod remarkable cure performed by your Solar Tindlure, on a very deep and\ndangerous wound made on Mrs. Cook by a cafe-knife, of more than the depth of\nmy fore-finger. After trying every means in vain to ftop the blood, I fent for a\nbottle of your Solar 1 indfure, and well bathed the wound therewith. The blood\nand T indture readily afiimilated, and formed a crult on the orifice of the wound,\nwhich very foon flopped the effufion of blood. But what is molt remarkable, the\nwound was compleatly healed in lefs than fix days, and is now fo perfectly clofed,\nas to be almoft imperceptible. You are welcome to publifh this, and in fo doing\nwill oblige, &c.\nSeymour-firm, Portlani-fqmre, April 14, 1794, WILLIAM COOK.\nNo. 24. 5 B To\n\fTo E. S I B L Y, M. D.\nSIR,\u2014In juftice to my own feelings, I cannot but acquaint you with a cure per-\nformed by your Solar Tindture, in a very uncommon manner. As I was travelling\nin the ftage to Boxley- Abbey, near Maidftone, in Kent, a gentleman, who fat next\nme, putting his head out of the window, received a violent cut acrofs the eye with the\ncoachman\u2019s whip, which produced an immediate fwelling and inflammation, attend-\ned with fo much agony, that he declared the pain was infupportable. I had pur-\nchafed a bottle of your Solar Tindlure while in town, knowing it had performed\nmany furprifing cures in my neighbourhood. This I immediately opened, and ap-\nplied to the inflamed part; and, after walking the eye well with it, I bound a white\nhandkerchief tight over it, wetted with the Tindlure. In lefs than ten minutes the\nanguiffi was greatly affwaged ; and in the courfe of three hours it was quite well.\nThe gentleman exprefled the utmofc aflonilhment at the celebrity of the cure, as did\nevery paflenger in the coach. I wifh this to be made as public as pofiible, for the\nbenefit of thofe who are liable to accidents ; and am with refpedl, &c.\nM. STABLES. '\nI fhall only remark further, with refpedl to wounds, bruifes, &c. that a Ihort time\nago, as a coach was driving furioufly out of Cavendifh-fquare, the horfes unfortu-\nnately beat down a girl of eight years of age, the daughter of Robert and Elizabeth\nLarken, of Clipflon-ftreet ; and the wheels paling over her body, Ihe was taken up\nto all appearance dead. The fpedlators were for carrying her immediately to the\nhofpital ; but, the accident happening very near my houfe, 1 was fent for. I avoid-\ned letting blood, but bathed the bruifed parts thoroughly with the Solar Tindlure,\nand introduced half a fpoonful, undiluted,\ninto her ftomach. It was now about nine\no\u2019clock at night. She was compofed and afleep before ten, being overcome by\nthe medicine. A fpoonful more of the Tindlure was given her at different periods\nof the night, the fudorific power of which brought on a plentiful perfpiration. At\nten o\u2019clock the next morning Ihe awoke, and got up, and was fo well recovered as\nto be able to play about with her companions, in all refpedts the fame as if nothing\nhad happened. The girl, and her parents, are pleafed with every opportunity of\nrecounting the circumftances of this event, to any enquirers.\nLet it not be faid, that, becaufe this medicine appears to be prefcribed for many\ndiforders, u can be good for none.\u2014I affirm, that every complaint for which it is re-\ncommended, originates in the blood, or in obftruffed perfpiration. The adtion of the\nSolar Tindlure is on the blood and juices ; it flrikes at the root, not at the\nbranches; by which peculiar advantage it effedls a cure when other medicines fail.\nAnd though there is a medicine, fold in regular pradlice at a guinea an ounce,\no which\n\f3 7 *\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\nwhich poft'efTes no one virtue comparable to the Solar Tinfture, yet the proprietor,\nunwilling to adopt fuch examples, or to withhold from the affii&ed in every line\nof life the benefits of his difeovery, has determined to render it to the public at\nonly 7s. 6d. the final!, and thirteen killings the large, bottles, duty included, with\nample directions in every complaint for which it ought to be adminiltered. \u2014A fingle\nbottle will in many cafes perform a fpeedy cure, when, in the ordinary courfc of\nmedical praftice, it would occupy a month, and coft many pounds for unneceflary\ntttendance, and an excels of drugs.\nIt is fold at my houfe.

Life\ndenotes the animated date of nature ; and in human beings, exifts as long as an\nunion of the foul and body lafts. With us, therefore, life continues, until fuch fe-\nparation has really taken place ; which can no more be faid to have happened dur-\ning the paroxifm of a fit, or of a blow which for a time deprives us of fenfation, or\nin the early period of an unnatural or fudden death, than during the time we are\nafleep. It is the want of proper (kill at fuch times that too often occafions death\nto take place, when life abfolutely exifts in the blood, and might with little care\nhave been prefer ved. Death is therefore the aft of feparation of the foul from the\nbody; in which fenfe it ftands oppofed to life, which confifts in the union thereof.\nAn animal body, by theaftions infeparable from life, undergoes a continual change,\nand receives its diflolution by degrees. Its fmalleft fibres become rigid ; its minuter\nvefiels\n\f372 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nveflels grow into folid fibres no longer pervious to the fluids; its greater veflels\ngrow hard and narrow ; and every thing becomes contradled, clofed, and bound up :\nwhence the drynefs, immobility, and extenuation, obferved in old age. By luch\nmeans the offices of the minuter veflels are deftroyed ; the humours ffagnate, har-\nden, and at length coalefce with the folids. Thus are the fubtileft fluids in the\nbody intercepted and loft, the concodtion weakened, and the reparation prevented ;\nonly the blood continues to run flowly through the greater veflels, affiduous to pre-\nferve life, even after the animal fundtions are deftroyed. At length, in the procefs\nof thefe changes, death becomes inevitable, as the neceflary confequence of life.\nBut it is rare indeed that life is thus long protradted, or that death fucceeds merely\nfrom the natural decays and impairment of old age. Accidental difeafes, and our\nnegledt of preferving health, cut the work fhort.\nThe figns of death are often very uncertain. If we confult what Window or\nBruchier have faid on this fubjedt, we fhall be convinced, that between life and\ndeath the lhade is fo very undiftinguifhable, that even all the powers of art can\nfcarcely determine where the one ends and the other begins. The colour of the\nvifage, the warmth of the body, and fupplenefs of the joints, are but uncertain figns\nof life ftill fubflfting, while, on the contrary, the palenefs of the complexion, the\ncoldnefsof the body, the ftiffhefs of the extremities, theceflation of all motion, and\nthe total infenflbility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death begun. In the\nlame manner alio, with regard to the pulfe and breathing; thefe motions arefooften\nkept under, that it is impoflible to perceive them. By bringing a looking-glafs\nnear to the mouth of the perfon fuppofed to be dead, people often expedt to find\nwhether he breathes or not. But this is a very uncertain experiment : the glafs is\nfrequently fullied by the vapour of the dead man\u2019s body ;\nand often the perfon is\nftill alive, though the glafs is no way tarniflied. In the fame manner, neither noifes\nin the ears, nor pungent fpirits applied to the noftrils, give certain figns of the dis-\ncontinuance of life and there are many inftances of perfons who have endured\nthem all, and afterwards recovered without any external afliftance, to the aftonifh-\nment of the fpedfators. This furely ought to be a caution againft hafty burials, ef-\npecialiy in cafes of fudden death ; for it is fhocking to refledt, that fome hundreds\nof valuable members of fociety are annually torn from their difconfolate families by\nfome accidental fudden caufe, and hurried thoughtlefsly to the grave, in whom the\nprinciples of life were capable of being revived! This lamentable truth has been\neftablifhed by the happy fuccefs of the humane fociety, from whofe laudable exer-\ntions feveral hundred perfons have been reftored to life, who, to all vifible appear-\nance, were pafl recovery. Every age and country affords fome inftances of perfons\nhaving been recovered, even after lying long for dead ; and from the number of\nthofe\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\ntnofe preferved by mere lucky accidents, it is ev ident ft i 11 greater numbers might be\nfaved by timely pains and (kill. Thofe who have contemplated the druCturc of the\nhuman machine know, that its diflolution cannot mturdlly happen but by that gra-\ndual decay of the whole fyftem above delcribcd, when the vefl'cls are become imper-\nvious to the fluids, the circulation weakened or deftroyed, and the vital organs no\nlonger able to perform their office. But, when their functions are merely fufpend-\ned by fome fudden fhock, it may be likened to the date of a watch flopped by a fall,\nwhich refumes its motion the infiant that injury is repaired. In the animal areono-\nmy, \u201c the BLOOD is the LIFE-\u201d Levit. xvii. u, 14. Deut. xii. 23. therefore, if\nits circulation be fufpended or deflroyed, death follows. But if the blood can be\nre-agitated, and its circulation relumed, life will of neceffity be reftored. For this\nreal'on, whenever any accident has happened, by which fudden death appears to have\ntaken place, whether by blows, fits, falls, fuffocation, ftrangulation, drowning,\napoplexy, convulfion-fits, thunder and lightning, afiaffination, duelling, or the like,\nlet the unfortunate perfon be carried into a warm houfe, and laid by the fire, or put\ninto a warm bed ;\nlet two or three table fpoonfuls of the Solar Tincture be intro-\nduced as early as poffible into the flomach, and rubbed profufely in by a warm\nhand, upon the fpineof the back, loins, bread, and region of the heart, and poured\ninto the wound, if there be any; the warm dimulating quality of the medicine, af-\nfifted by the external heat and friction, will quickly rouze the dagnant blood and\njuices, particularly in the_ grand refervoir the heart, where, rarefying, prefling every\nway, and being refided by the valves, it will fwell fo as to fill the flaccid right auri-\ncle of the heart, which by the fhock had become empty and at red ; and thus di-\nmulating its fibres, will put them in motion. The right auricle being thus filled\nanddimulated into contraction, fills the ventricle ;\nwhich, by this means being irri-\ntated, likewife contracts and empties itfelf into the pulmonary artery ; and the mo-\nment this is done the circulation begins again where it left off; and the lungs, being\nfilled by the dephlogidicated air contained in the medicine, begin to a<ft, and life is\nredored, provided the organs and juices are in a fit difpofition for it; which they\nundoubtedly are much oftener than is imagined. Nor is this dimulating aCtion of\nthe TinCture upon the heart at all furprifing ; for every medical man knows, or ought\nto know, that the heart, even when taken out of the body, if it be pricked with a\npin, or hath warm water thrown upon it, will beat afrefh, and endeavour to exert its\nfun&ions, though for fome time before it had been motionlefs. No perfon there-\nfore ought to be confidered dead, until the energy of the blood is fo far gone, that\nit can never again be agitated fo as to fill and ftimulate into contraction the right\nfinusvenojus and auricle of the heart.\nNo. 24. 5 C When\n<-\ni\n\f374 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nWhen the patient is thus far recovered, he ought to be treated with great care and\ntendernefs \u2022, andfome warm milk, wine and water, elder-flower-tea, or any nourifh-\ning fpoon-meat, fhould be given to him as foon as he appears capable of taking\nfood. In fome cafes it may be neceflary to open the temporal artery and the exter-\nnaljugular, or to bleed in the arm ^ but this fhould never be done, if it can fafely\nbedifpenfed with, as it certainly weakens the animal principle, which it is the firit\nobjeCt of this medicine to ftrengthen. Under different circumftances, and as parti-\ncular occafions may require, the rules laid down in p. 196,\nof the Medical Part of\nthis work, and recommended by the Humane Society, will be found of confiderable\nadvantage. Above all, let me entreat an anxious perfeverance in this fublimefl: of\nall virtues\u2014the attempt to recover perifhing lives. Humanity calls for it in the\nmod moving accents \u2022, and what can infpire a good heart with more fincere, per-\nfect, confcientious, and commendable, fatisfaction, than a retrofpeCt of fuch endea-\nvours as have been generoufly exerted and fuccefsfully contributed to recover, per-\nhaps to reftore, the life of a fellow-creature from that molt deprecated calamity\u2014\nfudden death, with its alarming retmue of threatening confequences to thole who\ndie unprepared ? fince, by thus preferving a finner to a future period, perhaps a foul\nmay emerge in full maturity to felicity which fhallhave no end!\nTo demonftrate the reanimating power of the medicine, experiments may bemade\nupon a fowl, lamb, cat, dog, or other animal, by plunging them under water until\nthey are apparently dead, or piercing them through the head, or any part of the bo-\ndy except the heart \u2022, by fuffocation, or an electrical fhock : for fudden death, how-\nfoever it happens, whether by drowning or otherwife, is much the fame as to its ef-\nfects on the vital organs ; confequently they are all to be treated in a fimilar manner.\nUpon the whole it is evident, that by contemplating the ceconomy and harmony\nof our ftruCture, both external and internal, we may quickly difcern a proper line\nof conduCt for the confervation of health, and the prolongation of life ; and we (hall\nalfo perceive a more auguft view of the marvellous works of divine wifdom in the\nftruCture of the human breaft, than we fhall perhaps again find in the whole com-\npafs of nature. The gift of health was evidently the defign of our benevolent\nCreator in the conftruCtion of our bodies j it is therefore no lefs our duty than our\nintereft to preferve this blefling to our lateft moments, as the feafoning and fund\nwhich gives the relifh to all our other enjoyments. To enumerate the various\nabufes of health, which take place from our earlieft infancy, particularly among the\nrich and gay, and which are continued through the fucceeding flages of modifh\nlife, would fill a volume. Suffice it to obferve, that they prevail more particularly\namong people who are the moft highly polifhed and refined. To compare their\nartificial mode of living, with that of nature, would afford a very ftriking contrail,\nand\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 375\nfupply an obvious reafon why perfons in the lower orders of fociety are generally\nthe longeft livers, and enjoy the belt ftate of health \u2022, and hence we are warranted to\nconclude, that a large proportion of thedifeafes to which we are fubjeCted, are pro-\nduced by ourfelves.\nNotwithftanding this unaccountable abufe of our health, yet the want of it unfits\nus for moft of the common avocations of life, and is more efpecially an enemy to\nthe focial and humane affeCtions, as it generally renders the unhappy fufferer peevifn\nand fullen, difgufted at the allotments of Providence, and apt to induce fuicide, by\nfuggefting gloomy and fufpicious fentiments of the Almighty. It obftruCts the\nfree exercife and full improvement of our reafon, makes us a burden to our friends,\nand ufelefs to fociety. Whereas the uninterrupted enjoyment of health is a con-\nftant fource of good humour, and good humour is a great friend to opennefs and\nbenignity of heart ;\nenables us to encounter the various ills and difappointments of\nthis world with more courage, or to fuftain them with more patience \u2022, and, in fhort,.\nconduces much, if we are otherwile duly qualified, to our aCting our part in every\nexigency of life with more firmnefs, confiftency, and dignity. Therefore it imports\nus much to preferve and improve the habit of its enjoyment, without which every\nother external entertainment is taftelefs, and moft other advantages are of little avail.\nTo this end, we ought above all things to cultivate prudence, temperance, fobriety,\nfortitude, and equanimity of temper for without a prudent care of the body, and\na fteady government of the mind, to guard the one from difeafe, and the other\nfrom the feuds of paffion and prejudice, found health is unattainable. By temper-\nance we enjoy the real gratifications of life, without fuffering any confequent incon-\nvenience. Sobriety enables us to be content with fimple and frugal fare, and pro-\ntects us from the pain and difgrace of intoxication. Fortitude enables us to bear\nthofe infirmities which prudence and fobriety cannot fhun, and banifhes all dread of\nimaginary evils from our thoughts. Equanimity of temper contributes greatly to\nthe happinefs of life, as well as to the prefervation of health, by preferving the mind\nfrom anxiety and perturbation, and arming us againftthe calumnies and animofities\nof human nature. Violent paffions, and the excefies they induce, gradually impair\nand wear away the conftitution \u2022, whilft the calm and placid ftate of a temperate\nmind, and the healthful exercifes of the body, preferve the natural functions in full\nvigour and harmony, and exhilarate the fpirits, which are the chief inftruments of ac-\ntion. The worft confequences that could poffibly refult from a ftriCt adherence to\nthis regimen, would be that of exterminating a fwarm of locufts, and rendering the\ndifcovery of my medicine of much lefs importance to the community.\nOf\n\f376 A K E Y TO PHYSIC,\nOf the CRISIS, or CRITICAL TURN of a DISEASE.\nTHE Crifis of a Difeafe is no other than the ftruggle betwixt nature and the\ninfirmity, which of them fhall prevail. If nature at the time of the crifis over-\ncomes the malignity of the difeafe, it is a furefign it will be cured \u2022, but if the fick-\nnefs prevails, it is then a pernicious crifis, and fhews fudden alteration for the worfe.\nEvery fudden and vehement motion of the difeafemay be called a crifis; therefore\ndays critical, decretory, and crifmal, are all one and the fame thing, and import\nno more than a certain and more fure judgment of the infirmity afflicting, either\nmore powerful, or lefs vehement, at thofe times when the true crifis happens;\ntherefore a crifis is to be calculated from that moment of time when the difeafe\nfirft invaded the patient. And on this ground I fhall make fome obfervations to\nprove the truth of what I have now to deliver, and of what I have before fo often\nproved, that I cannot but admire the wonderful providence of God, who difpofeth\nall things by number, weight, and meafure, prefcribing to the whole fyftem of na-\nture fo immutable a lav\/, that it were as eafy for the Heaven and the Earth to return\nto their original chaos, as to break and infringe that immutable law, unlefs the di-\nvine will and pleafure alter it miraculoufly.\nWe difcriminate two forts of difeafes ; acute, and chronic. Of acute difeafes,\nfome are fimple acute, others peracute, that is very acute ; others again are perper-\nacute, or exceeding acute. Thofe that are fimple acute are finifhed in eight, ten,\neleven, fourteen, twenty, or twenty-one, days. They are terminated in the time\nthe Moon traceth the twelve celeftial figris of the zodiac, viz. in twenty-feven days\nand eight hours.\nThofe acute difeafes which fuffer changes are very fickle ; for fometimes they in-\ncreafe, and fometimes they are remitted, according as the Moon meets with the\nbeams of either benefic or baneful planets; and fometimes they change out of\nacute difeafes into chronic; and thus a continued fever may change into an hetftic\nfever, or an intermittent fever into a continual fever ; and thefe difeafes terminate\nin forty days.\nVery acute difeafes are fuch as terminate in five, fix, feven, or eight, days\n;\namong!! which is the difcaie called peripneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs.\nExceedingly acute difeafes are fuch as end in three or four days at fartheft, as pef-\ntilences, apoplexies, &c.\nChronic difeafes follow the motion of the Sun, and it is about ninety days before\nthe firft crifis begins to appear; for in that time the Sun comes to the proper quar-\ntile of the place he was in at thedecumbiture, as appears in hettic fevers, dropfies,\nand the like. But when he comes to thofe degrees from the decumbiture which\n\u00ab are\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 377\nare called indicative, or intercidental, which are both one, or judicial, (as may be\nl'een in the Table,) fome alteration will appear, whereby a man may judge of thecri-\nfisto come. For the patient will be well, if the Sun be well configurated with be-\nnign placets ; but worfe, if in afped with evil ones ; and this rule is infallible, if you\nconfider it from the nativity throughout the whole courfe of a man\u2019s life j for dif-\neafes are the particular attendants of the inequality of the elements in every hu-\nman being.\nAll'o a crifis may be perfed, or imperfed. A perfed crifis is when the difeafe\nappears plain, and perfedly to be judged of-, and this is fometimes hopeful, and\nfometimes defperate. Hopeful, when there is a great probability of health and re-\ncovery defperate, when there are palpable figns of death. An imperfed crifis is\nwhen the difeafe is changed upon every light occafion-, as if Mars be the author of\nthe difeafe, and in a double-bodied fign -, in this cafe the dileale will be variable.\nThat crifis may be deemed fafe, which comes without pernicious afpeds -,\nbut\nthat is doubtful and dangerous which comes with malignant afpeds -, what thefe\nafpeds are, with the fignificators of every difeafe, and the mode of afeertaining\nthem, are already explained in my Illuftration of the Occult Sciences. We have\nthere fhewn, that to judge of a difeafe, it is necefiary to obferve the motion of the\nSun, Moon, and lord of the afeendant. With refped to the lord of the afeendant,\nobferve, before you give judgment, what application he makes to any planet, either\nby conjundion, quartile, or, oppofition j\nor, fhould he apply to more than one planet,\nlook to which of them he approaches neareft, and then count how many degrees of\nlongitude are between them ; and, if the difeafe be acute, then for every degree add\na day ; bur, if chronic, a week, month, or year, according to the fituation of Jupi-\nter, Venus, Mercury, or the Moon, at a perfed crifis.\nNow the time called critical is always evil, becaufe of the contrariety of the fign\nthe Moon is then in, to the fign (he was in at the decumbiture, which induceth the\ncontrariety of her nature to the oppofite place ;\ntherefore at fuch a time there arifeth\na controverly and conteft between the difeafe and nature. The Moon upholds na-\nture in acute difeafes and hence is the real'on that a bad crifis will always happen,\nif fhe be afflided upon a critical day by the bodies or evil beams of Saturn or Mars,\nor by the lord of the eighth houfe, or by the lord of the fourth houfe if he be a ma-\nlevolent, becaufe he fignifies the grave. But if the Moon at the time of the crifis\nbehold the lord of the afeendant, or be configurated with the benefic planets, health\nenfues, and the malady will be vanquifhed and overcome in the conflict.\nIf the difeafe terminates not upon the firft crifis, obferve how the Moon will be\nconfigurated on the fecond crifis, and judge by the fame rules. If it terminates\nnot then, as will fometimes happen, view the third crifis, and judge by that the fame\nNo. 24. 5D way.\n\f378 A K E Y T O P H Y S I C,\nway. If your judgment, fupported by reafon and the former rules, declare that the\ndifeafe will not terminate one way or other, neither in health nor death ; then examine\nthe face of the heavens at the time the Moon returns to the place die was in at the\ndecumbiture, which is at the end of 27 days, eight hours and fome minutes ; and\njudge according as the Moon fhall be then configurated with benefic or malig-\nnant planets ; for this of necefiity terminates all acute difeafes; though we may ob-\nferve that not one in a hundred hold on fo long, nor one out of twenty continue half\nfo long.\nIf the acute difeafe ends not in a month, it is then turned into a chronic difeafe;\nand muft be judged of by the Sun. The rules forjudging chronic difeafes by the\nSun are fimilar to thofe by which we judge of acute difeafes by the Moon. Now,\nfor the right diftindtion and calculation of time to judge of the progrefs of a difeafe\nin this way, obferve the following method. See what degree the Moon was in at the\ndecumbiture, by an Ephemeris, and add twenty-two degrees thirty minutes, which\nis called the indicative time, becaufe it informs the phyfician the nature of the dif-\neafe; for upon thefe indicative days the difeafe is ufually remitted and mitigated.\nTo this indicative time add twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, and this\npoints out the judicial day, viz. juft forty-five degrees from the place of the Moon\nwhen the patient fell Tick, being the half of a crifis, and manifefts according as the\nMoon happens to be afpedted, whether a good or a bad crifis will enfue. To the\njudicial day add twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, and it makes fixty-feven\ndegrees thirty minutes, which produces the fecond indicative day, as falling be-\ntween the crifis and judicial day. From this the phyfician may expedt indications\nhow the difeafe will finally fhew icfeif. To this add twenty-two degrees thirty mi-\nnutes more, and you have the perfedl crifis of the difeafe from the decumbiture,\nviz. ninety degrees, or one quarter of the zodiac. At this time nature will mani-\nfeft, according to the planets that are in afpedt to the Moon, whether the fick per-\nfiori will have a good or bad crifis; and adding twenty-two degrees thirty minutes\nmore, it makes the next judicial day, when the Moon approaches to it; and fo on,\nthrough the whole twelve figns of the zodiac, and over it again, if the difeafe termi-\nnate not in that time, as will plainly appear by the following Table, which fhews\nwhen the Moon comes to an indicative or to a judicial day, that is, a femiquartile,\nor half a crifis ; and when to a true quartile, and when to an oppofition, which is\ncalled a full crifis\n;\nand fo to all the indicatives and judicial days during the fick-\nnefs, &c.\nEXAMPLE.\nSuppofe the true place of the Moon, at the time a perfon falls fick, be fixteen\n-degrees of Gemini, which will be found in the fourth column of the following Ta-\n3 ble>\n\/\n\f379\nand occult science.\nble, fo that fixteen degrees of Gemini will be the Moon\u2019s radical place in the de-\ncumbiture. Over againft lixteen degrees, to the right hand, I find 8 30, and\nover the head thereof I find 2?, fo that when the Moon came to eight degtccs\nthirty minutes of Cancer, it was the firft indicative day, wherein the phylician\nmight expeft to fee how the difeafe would fiiew itfelf. Upon every crifis or indica-\ntive day, make fpecial obfervation what planet the Moon is in configuration with \u2022,\nif with a benevolent planet, expea fome remilfnefsin the dileafe ; but, if with a ma-\nlevolent, the contrary effea will follow. Next, on the right hand to 8 3\u00b0 23 >\nyou will find 1 51, which ftiews that when the Moon comes to the fiift degree of\nLeo, file will be in femiquartile to her firft place-, and this is, as before ftated, half\na crifis, at which time the difeafe will more or lefs manifeft itfelf according to fuch\nconfigurations as the Moon is found to make with the other planets at the time file\ncomes to the firft degree of Leo. In the next column on the right hand, you lee 2\n3\n30, over it 51 . This points out the indicative day, wherein the phyfician is enabled\nf urther to judge of the increafe or decreafe of the dileafe. In the next column you\nfind 16, over it \u00abr, which indicates that when the Moon came to the fixteer.th de-\ngree of Virgo, there was a true crifis, whereby the difeafe might be more fully in-\nveftigated, and a judgment framed according to the afpe&s the Moon in that de-\ngree had to the good or evil planets for from hence will the patient or phyfician\ndeferya better or worle crifis, in progreffive order. And thus, in the continued line\nor column, you may run round the face of the Heavens, obferving the configura-\ntions of the Moon when file comes to thofe places of the zodiac wherein fiie makes\nthe indicative, judicial, and critical, days, and what planet or planets file is then in\ncontact with, and whether in the decumbiture they promife good or evil. Befides\nthis, you muft oblerve on what day the Moon, or the lord of the afeendant, tranfits\nthe cufp of the fixth, leventh, and eighth, houfes, and how die is then afpeCted with\nthe benevolent or malign planets; and obferve whether (he be combult or in via\ncombujta, which is from the twentieth degree of Gemini to the firft of Cancer, in\nthe northern part of the zodiac ; and in the fouthern from the fixth degree of Sa-\ngittarius to the fixteenth of the fame conftellation ;\nand from the twenty-fourth\ndegree of Sagittarius to the fifth degree of Capricorn, or in conjunction, quarrile,\nor oppofition, of Saturn or Mars, or of a combuft planet, or of fome fixed ftar of a\nmalignant nature ; for irj all theie cafes an indication is given of death, or of long\nand levere ficknefs, according to the number of teftimonies and aftral indications,\naccording to the rules given in my Illuftration of the Occult Sciences ; but in which\nthe following moft valuable Table was omitted.\nA LU-\n\f380 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nA LUNAR TABLE,\nWhich, by entering with the Degree of the Moon at the Time any Per-\nfon falls lick, will point out at one View the Indicative, Judicial, and\nCritical, Day, of the Difeafe.\nT r \u00ab n 25 25 a\n1\n~ X kf kf\n-\nX\n0 30 23 *5 30 8 0 3 \u00b0 23 \u20185 3 \u00b0 8 0 3023 *5 3 \u00b0 8 0 30 23 5 3o 8\n1\n3 \u00b0 24 16 30 9 1\n3 \u00b0 2 4 16 3 \u00b0 9 1\n3 \u00b0i\n2 4 1\n6\n3 \u00b0 9 1 30 24 16 30 9\n2 3 \u00b0 2 S <7 3 \u00b0 10 2 30 2 S *7 3\n\u00b0 10 2 3\n\u00b0 2 5 17 30 10 2 3 \u00b0 25 17 3 \u00b0 10\n3 3 \u00b0 26 18 3 \u00b0 1\n1\n3 3 \u00b0 26,18 3 \u00b0 1\n1\n3 3 \u00b0 26 18 30 1\n1\n3 3 o 26 18 3\n\u00b0 1\n1\n4 30 27 *9 3 \u00b0 1\n2\n4 3 \u00b0 27\ni\u2018\n9 3 \u00b0 1\n2\n4 3 \u00b0j\n2 7 19-3\u00b0 J 2 4 3 \u00b0 2\n7 19 30 1\n2\n5 3 \u00b0 28 20 3\u00b0 13 5 302820 3 \u00b0 r\n3 5 3028 20 3 \u00b0 *3 5 3\n\u00b0 28 20 3 \u00b0 *3\n6 3 \u00b0 29 21 3 \u00b0J 4 6 30 29; 21 3 \u00b0 H 6 3\u00b0| 2 9 21 3074 6 3 \u00b0 2 9 21 3 o 3\n4\n7 3 \u00b0 3 \u00b0 22 3 \u00b0 l\n5 7 3 \u00b0 3\u00b0j22 3 \u00b0 l\nS 7 3 \u00b0 3 \u00b0 22 30 *5 7 30 3\n\u00b0 22 3 \u00b0 *5\n\u00ab Si m '*\u2022*\u00bb\n8 3 \u00b0 1 2 3 3 \u00b0 16 8 3 \u00b0 I 23 3 \u00b0 16 8 30 1 23 3\u00b0 16 8 30 J 2 3 3 \u00b0 16\n9 3 \u00b0 2 24 30117 9 30 2 24 go l\n7 9 3 \u00b0 2 24 30 *7 9 3 \u00b0 \"2\n24 30 171\n10 3 o 3\n2 S 3 o 18 I c 3 \u00b0 3 2 5 30 18 10 30 3 2 5 3 \u00b0 18 10 3 \u00b0 3\n2 5 3 \u00b0 18\n'\n1\n1\n39 4 26 3 \u00b0 19 1\n1\n3 o 4 26 30 l\n9 1\n1\n3 \u00b0 4 26 3 \u00b0 19 11 3 \u00b0 4 26 30 *9 (\n12 3\n\u00b0 5\n2 7 3 \u00b0 20 12 3 o 5 27 3\n\u00b0 20 12 3 \u00b0 5 27 3 \u00b0 20 12 3 \u00b0 5 27 30 20\n1\n3 3 \u00b0 6 28 30 21 *3 30 6 28 3 \u00b0 21 *3 3 o 6 28 30 21 *3 3 o 6 28\n1\n3 \u00b0 21\nH 3 \u00b0 7 29 3 \u00b0 22 14 30 7 2 9 30 22 J\n4 3 \u00b0 7 29 3022 14 30 7 29 3 \u00b0 22\nn 4f X\nr\n5 3 o 8 I\n3 \u00b0 2 3 15 30 8 0 3 \u00b0 2\n3 15 3 \u00b0 8 0 3 \u00b0 23 1\n5 3 \u00b0 8 0 3 \u00b0 23\n1\n6\n3 \u00b0 9 2 3\u00b0 2 4 16 3\n\u00b0 9 1\n3 \u00b0 2 41 16 3 \u00b0 9 1\n3\n\u00b0 24 1\n6\n3 \u00b0 9 1\n3 \u00b0 24\nl\n7 3 o 10 3 3\u00b0 25 l\n7 3\n\u00b0 1 0 2 30 25 *7 30 10 2 3 \u00b0 25 *7 3 \u00b0 10 2 3 \u00b0 2 5\n18 30 r 1\n4 3\u00b0 26 18 3\n\u00b0 1\n1\n3 3o 26 18 3 \u00b0 1\n1\n3 3 \u00b0 26 18 3 \u00b0 1\n1\n3 30 26\n19 30 12 5 3 \u00b0 27 T\n9 3\n\u00b0 12 4 3\n\u00b0 2 7 19 3\n\u00b0 12 4 3\n\u00b0 27 !93 o 12 4 3 \u00b0 27\n20 30 T\n3 6 3\u00b0 28 20 3 \u00b0 1\n3 5 3 \u00b0 28 20 3 \u00b0 *3 5 3 \u00b0 28 20 3 \u00b0 J\n3 5 30 28\n21 3 \u00b0 14 7 3 \u00b0 2 9 21 3 \u00b0 M 6 3 \u00b0 29 21 3 \u00b0 H 6 3\n\u00b0 29 2 [\n3 \u00b0 14 6 30, 2 9\n22 3 \u00b0 *5 8 30 3\n\u00b0 22 3\n\u00b0 *5 7 3\u00b0 3 \u00b0 22 30 3\n5 7 3\n\u00b0 3 \u00b0 22 30 *5 7 3\n\u00b0'\n3 \u00b0\n25 -n.

That contraries, or oppoficcs, are the remedies for each other; aiui t iiis\nmaxim he explains by an aphorifm ; in which he fays, that evacuations cure thole\ndiflempers which come from repletion, and repletion tlnfe that are cauted by eva-\ncuation. So heat is dcftroycd by cold, and cold by heat, &c. In thefecond place,\nhe aflerted, that phyfic is an addition of what is wanting, and a lubtraction or re-\ntrenchment of what is fuperfluous : an axiom which is explained by this, viz. that\nthere are fome juices or humours, which in particular cafes ought to be evacuated,\nor driven out of the body, or dried upj and fome others which ought to be reftor-\ned to the body, or cauled to be produced there again. As to the method to bo\ntaken for this addition or retrenchment, he gives this general caution, That you\nought to be careful how you fill up, or evacuate, all at once, or too quickly, or too\nmuch \u2022, and that it is equally dangerous to heat or cool again on a ludden ;\nor ra-\nther, you ought not to do it : every thing that runs to an excefs being an enemy to\nnature. In the fourth place, Hippocrates allowed that we ought fometimes to di-\nlate, and fometimes to lock up : to dilate, or open the paflages by which the hu-\nmours are voided naturally, when they are not fufficiently opened, or when they are\nclofed ; and, on the contrary, to lock up or ftraiten the paflages that are relaxed,\nwhen the juices that pafs'there ought not to pafs, or when they pals in too great\nquantity. He adds, that we ought fometimes to fmooth, and fometimes to make\nrough ; fometimes to harden, and fometimes to foften again ; fometimes to make\nmore fine or fupple ;\nfometimes to thicken ;\nfometimes to roufe up, and at other\ntimes to flupify or take away the fenfe; all in relation to the l\u2019olid parts of the bo-\ndy, or to the humours. He gives alfo this farther leffon, That we ought to have\nregard to the courfe the humours take, from whence they come, and whither they\ngo-, and in confequence of that, when they go where they ought not, that we make\nthem take a turn about, or carry them another way, almoft: like the turning the\ncourfe of a river; or, upon other occafions, that we endeavour if pofllble to recal,\nor make the fame humours return back again ; drawing upward luch as have a ten-\ndency downward, and drawing downward l'uch as tend upward. We ought alfo to\ncarry off, by convenient ways, that which is neceffary to be carried off ;\nand no.\nlet the humours once evacuated enter into the vefiels again. Hippocrates gives al-\nfo the following inltruflion,' That, when we do any thing according to real\u201805,\nthough the fuccefs be not anfwerable, we ought not too eafily, or too haftily, to al-\nter the manner of ailing, as long as the reafons for it are yet good. But, as this\nmaxim might fometimes prove deceitful, he gives the following as a corrector to it\n:\n\u201c We ought (fays he) to mind with a great deal of attention what gives eafe, and what\ncreates pain; what is eafily fupported, and what cannot be endured.\u2019\u2019 We ought\nNo. 25. 5 E not\n\f3?2 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nnot to do any thing rafhly ; but ought often to paufe, or wait, without doing any\nthing : by this way, if you do the patient no good, you will at lead do him no hurt,\nThefe are the principal and mod general maxims of the practice of Hippocrates,\nand which proceed upon the fuppofition, that nature cures all flight difeafes.\nWhen, however, they are acute or fevere, they demand the utmod ingenuity and\nfkill of the ph>fician to moderate their violence; and it is then that their termina-\ntion may be known by confulting the foregoing Table,\nOf the UTILITY of the preceding TABLE.\nNOW in order to {hew the great utility and convenience of this Lunar Table, in\ndeciding the event of any particular fit of likenefs, I {hall here date fome real pre-\ndictions which were made, during the.indifpofition of fome of my patients, and for\nwhom the following horofcopes were erected.\n\f3 a\n3\nand occult science.\nI have placed the horofcope of this patient\u2019s nativity over the figure of his de-\ncumbiture; in order to fhew, by way of analogy, that fuch an indifpofition would\nCei tainly take place about this time, from the pofition of the fignificators, and their\nparticular configurations with the heavenly intelligencers, at the time of his birth.\nFor this reafon, the figure of the Tick perfon\u2019s nativity fhould always be infpefted\nwhere it can be had, becaufe it enables us the better to judge, in many intricate cafes,\nwhether the difcaie will terminate with life or death j\nfor although, in mod com-\nmon maladies, it is pofiible to determine this queftion pretty accurately, by the help\nof cue preceding Table, without the radical figure of birth, yet, where that can be\nhad, our judgment will in general be more certain, and often infallible.\nIn the above figure of the decumbiture of the patient, we find the Moon hath late-\nly tranfitcd the place of the Sun and Jupiter in the figure of birth ; and that this\nplace is in the fiery triplicity, afflicting the Moon in the radical point with a quar-\ntile afpeft ;\nat the fame time that the Moon and Mars beholding each other with a\ntrine, from fiery figns, at the time of birth, clearly fhews that the native would be\nfubjedt to fevers of the inflammatory kind. But I {hall decline making any com-\nments an the temperature of the native, or the defignation of his fignificators at the\ntime\n\f3*4 A KEY T'O PHYSIC,\ntime of birth ; as it is not my intention here to explain the mode of calculating a\nnativity, that being already fufficiently demonftrated in my Uluftration of the Oc-\ncult Sciences. All that can be neceffary here, is to give a few examples from the\ndecumbitures of different patients, compared with the horofcope of their nativity,\nin order to fhew, by the Table, whether fuch fick perfons would live or die. And,\nin doing this, it will be proper for thofe who wifli to be convinced of the truth and\nexiftenceof the celeftial influx, to pay the ftridteft attention to the Moon\u2019s places in\nthe Table, and what pofitions of the benefic or malefic afpedts {he tranfits, or comes\nin configuration with ; for from thefe events will the malady of each particular pa-\ntient be abated or increafed ; and from thefe of courfe mult our judgment be ulti-\nmately drawn.\nBy the decumbiture of the patient now under confideration, we fee that the Moon,\nat the time of his falling lick, was in twenty-two degrees forty minutes of Virgo.\nTo this I add twenty-two degrees thirty minutes of the zodiac, which brings her to\nfifteen degrees ten minutes of Libra, and is her firft indicative place. At the time\nfhe arrives here, I find, by examining the preceding horofcopes, that fhe is within\norbs of a fextile afpedt of Mars, which indicates a ftrong fever ; though not ex-\ntremely ardent, owing to the Moon\u2019s transiting the place of Venus in the figure of\nbirth. I now add, or pafs on to, twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more of the zo-\ndiac, which cuts an angle of forty-five degrees, and brings the Moon\u2019s place to fe-\nven degrees forty minutes of Scorpio, which gives her judicial time, and furnifhes\nthe means of diredting our judgment whether a fevere or favourable crifis would\nfollow. To this end I infpedt the figures, and find that the Moon now comes to a\nconjunction of the two benevolent planets Jupiter and Venus, which alone prog-\nnofticates a favourable crifis j\nand the more fo, as at this time the Moon nearly tran-\nfits the place of Saturn in the horofcope of birth : accordingly, the patient became\nmuch better, thefever decreafed, and his pulfe was more regular. From the Moon\u2019s\njudicial place in Scorpio, I now pafs on twenty-two degrees thirty minutes further,\nwhich fhews her fecond indicative pofition, in ten minutes of Sagittarius ; where,\nfinding no particular afpedt of the principal ftars or luminaries, it portended little\nor no alteration in the ft ate of the difeafe at this time *, and fo it happened. I now\nadvance twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, which {hews the place of the\nMoon on that day to be in twenty-two degrees forty minutes of Sagittarius, where\n{he produced the firft crifis of the diforder. It was now obfervable, that from the\nlaft indicative day to the time of this crifis, the patient fhewed figns of a delirium,\nand rambled much in his talk, concerning riding of horfes, which exadly corref-\nponds with the nature of the fign where the crifis fell; but it was evident he would\nrecover from this, and be much mended, when the Moon formed her trine with\n2 Saturn,\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 385\nSaturn, to which flu* was approaching, in twenty-nine degrees twenty-fix minutes of\nSagittarius. When this afpedt was formed, the patient had vifibly recovered, and\nthe brain was never atter afiedted. I now proceed twenty-two degrees thirty mi-\nnutes more on the zodiac, which brings the Moon to her next indicative day, in\nfifteen degrees ten minutes ot Capricorn. PL re the two celeftial luminaries form a\nquai tile, a difeordant afpedt, which gave the patient a relapie. Proceeding the next\ntwenty-two degrees thirty minutes, I come to the Moon\u2019s judicial place, in ieven\ndegrees forty minutes of Aquaries. Here we find a mundane trine, formed by Ju-\npiter and Venus with the Moon, and a zodiacal trine of Mercury, a plain demon-\nftration that the diforder mud abate, and that a favourable crifis would enfue. To\nthe feven degrees forty minutes of Aquaries, I add twenty-two degrees thirty mi-\nnutes more, which brings the Moon to her l'econd indicative place, in ten minutes\nof Pi fees. Viewing the decumbiture, I now find the Moon approaches to a\ntrine afpedt under the benign influence of Jupiter and Venus, w hich overcomes\nthe quartile of Mars, and indicates the difeafe would be completely conquered\nby the next crifis. To afeertain the truth and manner of this, I proceed onwa ds\ntwenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, which brings the. Moon to twenty-\ntwo degrees forty minutes ot Aquaries, where the fecond grand crifis was to be pro-\nduced. Now, upon maturely infpedting the decumbiture, 1 find the Moon, at the\ntime this patient was feized with his dilorder, was placed in her north node, and\ncontributed to the evil effedts of the other configurations ; but at the time of this\ngrand crifis, flic is fortunately pofited in her fouth node, thereby helping to deprel's\nthe vitiated humours of the body, and to overcome the difeafe. This poficion, con-\ntributing to the favourable influence of the other configurations, reftored the pa-\ntient from his bed of ficknefs, and his ftrength gradually increafed; fo that by the\ntime the Moon formed her conjundtion with Saturn, as exprefied on the face of\nthe heavens in the figure of his decumbiture, the mafs of blood was purified from\nall feverifh fymptoms, and the patient was reftored to his accuftomed health and\nftrength. And thus we may fee, that by erecting the decumbiture, or figure of the\npofitions of the heavenly bodies, at the time any patient is feized, and proceeding in\nthis manner to afeertain the influence of the good or evil afpedts on the indicative,\njudicial, and critical, days, we fhall, without difficulty, be able to determine whether\nthe dileafe will prove flight or dangerous, and bediredted accordingly in our regi-\nmen and mode of treatment. But in order to make this ipeculation ftill more obvi-\nous to the young practitioner, as well as to the curious reader, I fhall now proceed\nto examine the decumbiture of a patient, whole difeafe was more malignant, and\nproved fatal.\nNo. 25. 5 F DECUM-\n\f\" ^ ^ i X u r rl i S 1 C,\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 387\nThefe figures I eredted while refident in Briftol, at the requeft of my good friend\nDr. Till Adams, who being feizcd with a mali nant fever, accompanied with dan-\ngerous fymptoms, and being himfelf a friend to, and an admirer of, the Occult\nSciences, was defirous of feeing the refult of fuch an enquiry, and of judging him-\nfclf, by thefe means, whether hefhould live or die.\nIn confidering the fidereal effedt of the preceding figures, it is by no means requi-\nfite to calculate the genethliacal prognoftications of the fevcn erratics at the time of\nthe native\u2019s birth. It is however neceflary to notice their principal afpedls and po-\nrtions in the horofeope, in order to determine whether the fame pofitions are tranf-\nmitted, or fimilar or adverfe afpedts formed in the decumbiture, at the time the pa-\ntient is taken ill; but no further or more minute fpeculation is required, fince we\nare neither confidering the effeclof directions, nor the fate of a nativity ; but are en-\ndeavoui ing to prove, that, by only obferving the pofition of the heavens at the time\nthe patient is taken ill, the probable termination of the difeafe might be foretold,\nand whether it would end in life or death. Firft, then, we may obferve, the Moon\nis fituated in the eighth houfe, termed by the ancients thehoule of death, becaufeof\nits obfeurity and pofition under the earth. Brfides this we find the Moon in op-\npofition to Saturn, who was her difpofitor at the time of birth; and from this afpect\nfhe forms an oppofition with Venus, the lady of the doctor\u2019s afeendant ; and imme-\ndiately approaches to an oppofition of the Sun, the fountain of life. Thefe are\nthree evil diredtions by pofition, and furnifh a veiy unfavourable profpedt of the\nevent of the difeafe. For the Moon, the giver of radical moilture, afflicted by the\nadverfe rays of the Sun, the author of vital heat, fails not to produce fuch a putri-\nfadtion of the animal juices, as to bring on a fpeedy diffolution of the body. Let\n11s then examine the decumbiture by our Table, and fee how and when this fatal\nevent would take place.\nAt the time the patient fell fick, we find the Moon in ten degrees forty-fix mi-\nnutes of Leo ;\nto which add twenty-two degrees thirty minutes, for the firft indica-\ntive time, which falls in three degrees fixteen minutes of Virgo; and indicates the\nnature of the difeafe to be a fever; for the Moon, from this indicative place, be-\nholds the Sun in the radical point with a baneful quartile afpecl ; and the Moon,\naccording to her own nature, was Saturnine, as departing from a fextie confirma-\ntion with Saturn in the radix, to a quartile with Venus, lady of the afeendant, and\ngiver of life; and therefore, according to the aftral rules of the immortal Ptolomy,\nthis firft motion of the Moon from the radical point of the decumbiture indicated\nevil. I now go forward twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, for the firft judi-\ncial day, w hich places the Moon in twenty-five degrees forty-fix minutes of Virgo.\nNow as the Moon is not configurated at this judicial time with either of the planets,\n2 neither\n\f3 88 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nneither by tranfit in the nativity, nor afped in the decumbiture *, and her judicial\nplace falling in the twelfth houfe, the houfe of affliction, we cannot draw any fa\nvourable judgment from thefe circumftances \u2022, but on the contrary, a dangerous\ncrifis is to be expeded. ,To this judicial time, we add twenty-two degrees thirty\nminutes more, and it brings the Moon fixty-feven degrees from the place (he oc-\ncupied when the patient was feized with the diforder, and this is her fecond indica-\ntive place, which falls in eighteen degrees fixteen minutes of Libra. Now, if we in-\nfped the foregoing horofeopes, we fhali find the Moon, in approaching to this point,\nhas juft: departed from a baneful oppofition with Jupiter, which, having the dired\noppofite effeCt of a conjunction with that benevolent plajiet, which reprefents the\nheart and vital principle, Ihews a contaminated or morbid ftate of the blood and\nlymph. We likewife perceive the Moon is in quartde to her own radical place,\ntranfiting at the fame time the body of Venus, and making this alpeCt the harbin-\nger of a fatally-approaching crifis. To determine this faCt, I proceed twenty-two\ndegrees thirty minutes further in the zodiac, which brings the Moon to ten degrees\nforty-fix minutes of the fign Scorpio, at which point of time the crifis, or critical day,\nof this patient\u2019s difeafe occurred. Now oy infpeding the figures, we fhali perceive\nthis crifis is ulhered in by fuch evil configurations of the heavenly bodies, the fe-\ncond caufes under nature, as would not only heighten the malady, and put it out\nof the power of medicine to lubdue, but would infallibly terminate in death. In\nthe firft place we fhali notice, that the Moon tranfits the place of Saturn in the ra-\ndical point ; fecondly, fhe is configurated in a malefic quartile afped of Saturn in\nthe decumbiture; thirdly, fhe is within orbs of a baneful quartile of Venus, lady\nof the patient\u2019s afeendant ; and fourthly, fhe is rapidly approaching to a quartile\nconfiguration of the Sun, which is inimical to life and motion, without anyone\nfriendly afped of the benefic planet Jupiter intervening, to leffen or repel the male-\nfic influence. Such, therefore, are the teftimonies, that under any kind of malady,\nand wherever they occur, infallibly portend the death of the patient ; and they ac-\ncordingly put an end to the exiftence of this much-refpeded man, whofe integrity\nin his profeffion had gained him univerfal efteem, and renewed in him the ineftima-\nble character of the immortal Culpeper, who never, with a view to gain, gave two\nmedicines for the cure of an afflided fellow-creature, when one was fufficient.\nBut death levels all dsftindions ; and, in ftrid conformity with the time and manner\npointed out by the above decumbiture, it conduded the foul of this excellent man\nfrom an earthly to an heavenly habitation, on the 20th of February, 1786, at the\ntime the Moon formed her quartile afped with the Sun, which was in eight days\nfrom the time he was feized with the fever, and fix days after it was foretold by the\npreceding horofeopes \u2022, from whence, having forefeen the dodor\u2019s fate, I compofed\nan\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 3*9\nan Elegy on his death, while he was yet alive, which 1 got printed, and publifhed\non the very day he expired, thus manifefting to the world, with the patient\u2019s earned\napprobation, an incontrovertible inltance of the verity of afiral prediction.\nHaving thus far endeavoured to prove the utility of the Lunar Table, by the in-\ndifpofition and recovery of Charles Thomas, apprentice to Mr. Hall, engraver to\nhis majefty, in the one cafe; and by the fickneis and death of Dr. Till Adams, in\nthe other; I fhall now, for the farther fatisfaCtion of the reader, prove, that it is\npofiible to judge whether a patient will live or die, from the horofeope of the de-\ncumbiture only, without knowing or recurring to the horofeope of the patient\u2019s na-\ntivity, or time of birth. \u2014To this end, the following axiom mult ever be remember-\ned : That if we find, at the time any perfon is feized with illnefs, that the Moon is\nafflicted by more than one planet ;\nand that on the next critical day file forms a con-\ngrefs with the malefic planets Saturn and Mars, either by conjunction, quartile, or\noppofition, the fick perfon fliall die on the day and hour in which the afflicted Moon\ncomes to the interficient point of the zodiac ; as the great Ptolomy declareth in his\n16th Aphorifm :\n\u201c We mult behold the motion of the Moon as fhe pafieth through\n\u201c the critical, judicial, and mortal, days ; for if fhe be in them fortunate, it fareth\n\u201c well with the patient ; but if unfortunate the contrary.\u201d I fhall exemplify this by\nthe following example.\nPREDICTION from a DECUMBITURE.\n\fBeing fent for to a perfon who fell Tick on the icth of April, 1791, and being de-\nfirous to know the event of his difeafe, l examined the face of the heavens at the ex-\nad time the patient was feized, viz. at half paft twelve o\u2019clock at noon, when the\nceleftial intelligencers were pofited as in the above decumbiture, and which are as\nfollow : the Moon, which in all decumbitures reprefents the fick perfon, isfituated\nwithin the quartile influence of no lefs than four planets, Saturn, Mars, Mercury,\nand the Sun ;\nand, as they are all within orbs of a conjunction with each other, it\nfollows that the difeafe would bear defignarion of their joint pernicious influx,\nwhich, fcientifically confidered, manifefts a fever, with putrefaction of the animal\njuices, as thofe {killed in the aflral fcience will quickly fee. For the Sun\u2019s burning\ninfluence, in conjunction with Mars, a hot and violent planet, and Mercury being\ncontrovertible in his nature, unites in the malefic rays of the Sun and Mars ; and, al-\nthough Saturn is conftitutionally cold, yet, being alfo dry, his cold quality is over-\nbalanced, inafmuch as drought participates of the qualities of heat, being fuel for\nthe fire. Yet the cold quality of Saturn fpecificates the difeafe, by {hewing that it\nfprungfrom a cold caufe, or deathly cnill, extended over the whole circulating fyf-\ntem, or mals of blood.\nOn examining the patient, he informed me he had drunk a quart of cold water,\nbeing overcome with heat and third, and in a violent perfpiration, whence his blood\nmult have been in a highly inflamed ftate. This feems eminently prenoted by the\nMoon\u2019s pofition in a watery fign, and a moveable one, at the fame t me in oppofi-\ntion to the four planets above-mentioned, in fiery figns. Here, then, we at once\nperceive the fource and malignity of the difeafe j\nand finding neither of the benefic\nftars caft a fingle ray, either by body or afped, to the aphetic place, I thence con-\ncluded i he patient mult inevitably die, notwithftanding the Moon was beheld by a\nTextile configuration of Venus, which (Lengthened his nature, and fhewed that he\nwould greatly ftruggle with the malady. But as the teffimonies of evil arifing from\nthe joint influence of Saturn, Mars, Mercury, and the Sun, a r\ne more and much\ngreater than the contra fupport afforded by Venus, 1 reafonably concluded the pa-\ntient would die of the diforder, and that it was not in the power of medicine to fave\nhim. My next endeavour was to determine the hour of death. With this view I\nlook to the Table for the Moon in Cancer, and in the fifth column, on the left\nhand, i find the degree the Moon was in at the time the patient was feized, viz.\n7\n30 ;\nand then, gu ding my eye along till I come to the ninth column, I find 7 30 of\nLibra-, now, Libra being oppofite to Aries, the malefic planets Saturn and Mars of\ncourfe fend their opp< fite malignant beams into tha' fLn, Saturn in ten degrees\neighteen minutes, and Mars in thirteen degrees twenty-fix minutes ; I therefore con-\ncluded, that, when the Moon came to feven degrees thirty minutes of Libra in the\nv xodiaCj\n\f\f'otti\n.Mane-Anfinnette ofj\/ornzm kAiiftriai\n\\ Widow of3\/ewto Ca\/iefr \/\n^ Executed 7fi Tlcif 7721.\n\u00bbjS 3031'.in i\/ioJfirnine? \/r c?.>\ni fZws '\n\/\/1117 C.\n'7\/171\/\n\fAND OCCULT SCIENCE. 39 \u00bb\nzodiac, thecrifis would take place, as may be feen at the top of the fifth column in\nthe Table*, and thac when the Moon came to ten degrees eighteen minutes, being\nthe oppofition of Saturn, a vifible change in the patient would take place for the\nworfe; and that when file arrived at the thirteenth degree twenty-fix minutes of\nthat fame fign, thereby forming the oppofition with Mars, the difeafe would prove\nmortal, and terminate in death. If, therefore, the duration of the difeafe be reckon-\ned by the motion of the Moon, we fhall find, without any enquiry from the nurfe\nor dodlor, that the patient died about half pad four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, on the\n17th of April 1791, at which precife time the critical al'peifl on which the difeafe\nturned was formed. Thus was afforded an incontcftible proof of the correCtnefs of\nmy Lunar 'Fable, and of the force and power of the planetary influx on fublunary\nbodies. I fhall therefore conclude this decumbiture by the following axiom of\nHippocrates :\n\u201c When the fick party taketh to his bed, you muff confider whether\n\u201c the Moon departeth out of combuftion*, for then the ficknefs final 1 increafe till fhc\n\u201c come to the oppofition of the Sun, by reafon that humours then increafe in man\u2019s\n\u201c body.

For this purpolc I have annexed\na copper-plate engiaving of their nativities, with figures of the pofitions of the ce-\nleftial intelligencers a: their coronation, and on the days of their execution.

P. M. 1754. The fign Sa-\ngittarius afcended upon the eaftern fine ter of the horizon, intercepted by Capricorn;\nwherefore Jupiter and Saturn are the lords of his afcendant, and, with the Moon in\nthe tenth houfe, reprefent his perfon. From the nature and quality of thefe fignifi-\ncators, we may deduce the following inferences : that Saturn, being in the alcend-\nant, gave the native a wavering and irrefolute difpofition ; the Moon, pofited in\nScorpio, gave him a tafte for luxury; and Jupiter, being co-fignificator in the\neighth houfe, in afpeCt with Mercury, render him mild and pafiive, yet declare that\nhis principal aCtions fhall be attended with difappointment, and produce him much\nanxiety, vexation, and infult. In the royal hereditary figure of birth, we find four\nplanets occupying the houfe of death ; and as the Moon, giver of life, is difpofedof\nby one of thofe planets, it is an argument that he would not live to an old age.\nThe precifetime of death is only afcertainable by bringing up the feveral directions\nof the nativity : and, as the method of doing this is already amply explained in my\nJlluftration of the Occult Sciences, we muft refer thofe who chufe to work them\nup, for any affiftance they may want, to the rules there laid down. Suffice it here,\nthat we point out thofe teftimonies from the face of the nativity, that are always\nfound to be arguments of a violent death. Thefe are, firft, Saturn in the afcend-\nant, pofited in a violent fign. Secondly, the Moon, giver of life, configurated with\nthe violent fixed ftar Chaslae. Thirdly, the lord of the afcendant malevolently con-\njoined with the lord of the houfe of death. Fourthly, the two lights of the world\ndeprefied in the eighth houfe. And, fifthly, the Moon, elevated in the dignities of\nan infortune, and Mars, her difpofitor, having his fall in a human fign, plainly de-\nmonftrates that the native fhould fall by the hand of man. And this was unhappi-\nly verified by his execution, on the 21ft day of January, at twenty-two minutes paft\nten in the morning ; at which time thefe malefic directions came up, as reprefented\nin the figure of his execution, in the preceding plate. At that fatal moment we find\nthe Sun, the light of time, was in his detriment ; that Mercury, the fignificator of\nthe\n\f393\nAND OCCULT SCIENCE.\ni\nthe French people, occupied the culp of the tenth houfe, tranfitting the place of\nSaturn, the king's fignificator, at the time of birth ; that the two malefic planets\nSaturn and Ma:s are in reception of each other ; and that the Moon, the fignifica-\ntor of life, is Unrounded with violent fixed ttars, in oppofition to the benign planet\nJupiter, in angles, and in quartile to Mars, her d.fpoficor in the horolcope of birth;\nall which peculiar configurations are lo many tlrong and irrefiflible arguments\nof the rclolution of the people to proceed to extremities, and of the irrevocable\nfate of this unfortunate monarch. For although Jupiter, his co- fignificator, is ob-\nserved to fend a friendly ray to the aphetic place, yet having no dignities, and being\ndifpofed of by Mars, the fignificator of the convention, this benefic afpeft was de-\nprtfied, and its influence overcome, by the redundancy of a malefic influx. This\nadmirably points out the druggies of Dumourier, who flew to Paris in the hope of\nbeing able to preferve the life of his king; but his endeavours were quickly borne\ndown by the violence of the leading faction, and there was not a man to be found\nwho had courage enough to fecond his heroic intentions. This alfo, by the rules\nof the fidereal fcience, is clearly prenoted by the circumflance of Mars being the\ndifpofuor of Jupiter; and that Mars is difpofed of by Saturn, the author of pufil-\nlanimity and fear. Thus the afeendant of birth fliews that want of refolution and\nintrepidity in the native, which, if exerted in the favourable moment, would have\nturned the daggers of his enemies towards their own breads, and have permanently\nfecured himfelf and his poderity on the throne; and thus the figure of his decumbi-\nture points to the fatal execution of the guillotine, and proves, that although the\nnative fprung from a mod illudrious houfe, having the two fuperior planets for his\nfienificators, ahd although he was a king, at one time beloved and idolized by his\npeople, yet that he was but a man, lubjeft to the fevered reverfe of fortune, and\ndoomed to as ignominious an end as the viled of hisfubjefts !\nThe elegant and accomplifhed confort of this unfortunate monarch was born on\nthe 2d of November, 1755, 7h. 23m. P. M. as exprefled in the plate. In the figure\nof her nativity, we find the Moon is lady of the afeendant, rifing upon the fign Li-\nbra, in the fifth houfe, the houfe of plealure and fexual enjoyment; of which, it is\nmore than evident, fhe was pafllonately fond. Mars being poficed on the afeend-\nant, in his efiential dignities, fliews her to have been datel), audere, and proud ;\nyet predi6s that fhe would be unfortunate in her connections, ami impatient of con-\ntroul. This is the more obvious, becaufe Mars, the fignificator and influencer of\nher paflions, is dignified in her afeendant, though approaching to an oppofition of\nSaturn, lord of the feventh and eighth houfes, who is likewife configurated in his\nefiential dignities, and, more extraordinary dill, is pofited in the exaltation of Mars.\nNo. 25. 5 H This\n\f391 A KEY TO PHYSIC,\nThis gave her an unconquerable fpirit, and ftrong natural pa (lions, with an infatia-\nble appetite for intrigue, united to an inconftant and arbitrary turn of mind. This\nis ftill moreftrongly demonftrated by the prefence of four planets in the fifth houfe,\nand two of them afpedted in the fign Scorpio. That her reputation would be ar-\nraigned by the voice of the multitude, is forefhewn by the Dragon\u2019s Tail being in\nthe tenth houfe, the houfe of dignity and honour-, and the treachery of her confi-\ndants is pointed out by Mercury being in the fixth houfe, in his detriment, and in\noppofition to the Part of Fortune. That her confort would be involved in misfor-\ntunes, and fufFer greatly on her account, is made manifeft by Saturn, the fignifica-\ntor of the king, being in oppofition to Mars and the Moon, lady of her afcendant,\nin baneful quartile to both the infortunes. Indeed, there never was a nativity yet\nmade public, wherein the infortunes were fo mifchievoufiy configurated, or wherein\nthe general fignificators fo confpicuoufly denoted individual misfortune and univer-\nfal rage. But I fhall pafs over, for the prefent, any farther remarks on the unfortu-\nnate defignation of the fignificators in this nativity, and notice them no farther than\nas they point out the teftimonies of a violent and premature death. Thefe are, Firfi,\nthe Sun and Venus, configurated with a violent fixed fiar, in a violent fign. Se-\ncondly, Mars afcending to the violent fixed ftar Hercules ; and the fign afcending\nbeing of a violent nature. Thirdly, the lord of the eighth houfe, the houfe of\ndeath, afflidting the Moon in the aphetic place. Fourthly, the lord of the fixth\nhoufe afflidting the Moon, the lady of the afcendant, and fignificator of life, with\na malefic quartile ray, the harbinger of violence, and the prefage of death.\nThus we may obferve, that one of the principal luminaries is afflidted by both the\ninfortunes, and the other is pofited in a violent fign, denoting a violent death.\nAgain, the lord of the eighth houfe, a malevolent planet, afflidted by the quartile\nrays of an infortune by nature, is another prefage of untimely death. Alfo the lady\nof the afcendant, in a violent fign, banefully configurated with the infortunes, and\nthe difpofitor of the luminaries in a violent fign, is an irrefragible proof of an ap-\nproaching untimely death. Now, the Moon, who is lady of the afcendant, having\nher fall in a human fign, portends a violent death by the hand of man; and, if we\nexamine the face of the heavens at the time of her execution, we fhall find her death\nproceeded from the violence of an ufurped power, occupying the feat ofjuftice for\nthe Moon, elevated in her afcendant at the time of birth, is raoft remarkably confi-\ngurated in the fall of the Sun at the time of her execution ; and that fame fign cul-\nminating on thecufp of the tenth houfe, the houfe of juftice, and the Sun being po-\nrted therein his fall, in conjundtion with Mercury, mod aptly defcribes the man-\nner of the native\u2019s death. Mercury who is the natural fignificator of the French\n-people, being in his effential dignities, elevated, and in reception of Venus, lady\n3 thereofj\n\fm\nAND OCCULT S C I E N C E.\nthereof; and Mars beholding Jupiter with a quartile ray, pofitcd in the twelfth\nhoufe, and lord of the afcendant of death ;\nand the Moon, lady of the afcendant of\nbirth, being within orbs of an oppofition of Mars and Venus, who have their fall in\nthe houfe of dignity and honour; all tend to fore (hew that royalty is deftroyed in\nFrance; as is mod wonderfully prenoted in thehorofcope of the coronation. And\nwhat is very remarkable, at the time of the French monarch\u2019s death, the Sun, which\nis king among the planets, was pofited in his own detriment, or in that peculiar\npoint of the heavens, which is oppolcd to his own houfe ; and at the time of the un-\nfortunate queen\u2019s execution, the Sun was in his fall, without a Angle dignity to fup-\nport him, as is molt clearly evinced by the horolcopes in the preceding plate; fo\nthat we may fay, the ftars in their courfes fought againft this illu ftrious pair, as they\nfought againft Silera of old; and thus we may perceive, that the molt valiant, and\nthe molt courageous, are not proof againft the fhafts of fate ; but that the nobleft,\nand molt glorioufty clad, whether in honour, glory, or renown, are but like the ofF-\nfpring of plants, which have their fpringing up, their flowering, and their fragrant\nmaturity; until, plucked by a rude hand, they wither, fade, and die, and return no\nmore !\nErratum.

And firft, of the\nPERUVIAN, or JESUIT\u2019S BARK.\nCORTEX PERUVIAN US, called alio quinquina, kinkinna,\nquina-quina, pul-vis\npatrum, and popularly the Jef\nnit's bark, is the bark of a tree, growing in the Weft-\nIndies, called by the Spaniards palodecaknturas, q. d -fever-wood , by reafon of its ex-\ntraordinary virtue in removing all kinds of intermitting fevers and agues. The In-\ndians commonly call it the fuddling- tree, from the property it has of intoxicating fifti-\nes, when either its wood or bark is beaten, and fteeped in the water where they are.\nThe tree that yields this noble fpecific, is only found in Peru, in the Province of\nSan Francelcode Quito, or Quinto, near the city ot Loxa j though fome fay it is\nalfo found in that of Potofi; and F. Labat in the iftand of Guadeloupa. The\nbark, while on the tree, is ftreaked, of a whitifh >ellow without-fide, and a pale tan-\ncolour within.\nThe Spaniardsdiftinguifh four forts of this precious bark, viz. th tcafcarilla colorada,\nor reddifh bark ; amarylla,\nor yellowifti ^\ncre\/pilla,\nor curling ; and blanca, or whitifh.\nThzcolorada and amarylla are reckoned the beft : the crefpilla is the produce of the\nd fame\n\f2 APPENDIX TO\nfame fort of tree, only growing in a cold frody climate, which impairs the quality\nof- the bark, and renders it whitifli on the outfide, and cinnamon-coloured within,\nand unfit for medicinal ufe. As to the blanca, as it is procured from another fpe-\ncies of the tree of a much larger trunk, the leaves of a lighter green colour, and the\nbark of a very thick fpongious fubftance, whitifh on the outfide ;\nbeing withal fo\ntough, as to require the force of an ax to dice it from the tree. When fird cut\ndown it is as bitter as the bed fort, and has then the fame virtue in the cure of inter*\nmining fevers *, but when dry, and kept any length of time, it grows infipid, and\ngood for nothing. In reality, both forts are found to have much furer and quicker\neffebts when green than when dry ; fo that the Europeans only come in for the fe-\ncond-rate virtues : what is worfe, the bad fort is in great plenty, and the good is very\nfcarce, and hard to come at: for which reafon, with a little of the fine bark fent\nyearly to Panama, for Europe, large quantities of the word fort are ufually mixed.\nThe amarylla,\nor fmall bark, which curls up like dicks of cinnamon, and which in\nEngland is muchedeemed, as being fuppofed to betaken from the branches of the\ntree, and therefore more efficacious in the cure of fevers, is only the bark of the\nyounger trees ;\nwhich being very thin curls in this manner. For the bark of the\nbranches is never gathered \u2022, it would not compenfate the charge of cutting. The\nfeafon of cutting the bark is in Augud, the only fettled dry time in the country.\nAfter a tree has been barked, it requires eighteen or twenty years for a good bark to\ngrow again. Mr. Arrot, a Scotch furgeon, who had gathered the bark in the place\nwhere it grows, is of opinion, that the gathering the better fort of bark will foon be\nat end, or at lead very much reduced, partly by reafon of its didance from any in-\nhabited place, and the impenetrability of the woods were it grows, and partly by the\nwant of Indians to cut it, whofe race, through the cruelties of the Spaniards, is like-\nly to be totally extinft.\nThe mod accurate account we have ever received of the tree which produces the\nquinquina, or true Peruvian bark, is from M. de la Condamine, who, in travelling\nthrough fome parts of America, chofe the route of Loxa, where the fined bark is ga-\nthered, and where the greated number of the trees is found j and, taking indruftions\nfrom M. de Juffieu, informed himfelf concerning it. The quinquina-tree never\ngrows in the plains ; it is a condant inhabitant of the mountains, and is eafily known\nfrom the trees among which it dands by its eredt growth, and its height when of\nany confiderable age, as it always carries its head above the red, and alfo by its fize.\n1'hefe trees are never found in clumps or cluders together, but always feparate or\nAngle among other kinds. It is very rare, however, to find any large ones at this\ntime on the mountain where the bark is gathered, the great demand for it having\nmade\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERB \\ L. 3\nmade them bark all the trees, and thcfe having all perifhed by it tor the old trees\nnever recover the barking, though the young ones frequently do.\u2014 -The bark is now\ngathered at all times, if the weather be dry. When the bark is taken off, it is laid\nin the fun till it is i^rfedlly dry ; the omitting this circumllance, and packing up\nthe bark while moitt, have occafioned it often to become mouldy, and fj>oil ; and\nthe merchants have attributed this to the taking it off in the wrong time of the\nmoon, when it was wholly owing to its being put into the fkin while too moift.\nThe leaves of the quinquina \/raiftand on pedicles of about half an inch long : they\nthey are very fmooth and gloffy, and of a beautiful green ; but fomewhat paler on the\nunder fide than the upper. They are perfectly fmooth at the edges, and are of an ob-\nlong figure pointed at the end, and rounded at that part which joins to the ftalk.\nThey are from two and a half to three inches in length, and from an inch and an\nhalf to two inches in breadth. The middle rib of the leaf is rounded on the upper\nfide, and is ufually of areddifh colour, efpecially towards the pedicle ; and the whole\nleaf often becomes red, when perfciftly mature. All the fmall branches towards the\ntop of the tree terminate in one or more clutters of flowers, which before they are\nopen, refemble in their fhape and colour thofe of the common lavender. When thefe\nopen they change their colour: each ftalk that fuftains one of thcfe clutters arifes\nfrom the ala of one of the leaves, and divides into many fmall branches, each termi-\nnated by a cup divided into five parts, which fuftains a flower refembling that of the\nhyacinth. It is compofed of a pipe of three quarters of an inch long, which at the\nend is divided into five, and fometimes into fix fegments. Thefe are of a beautiful\ndeep red within, and are ierrated round the edges in a very elegant manner. From\nthe bottom of the tube of the flower there arifes a white piftil, terminated by a long\ngreen head; this arifes above the level of the fegments of the fower, and is furround-\ned by five ftamina, which fuftain apices of a pale yellow colour : thefe remain hid\nwithin the flowers. The tube is of a dirty red, and is covered with a fort of whitifh\ndown. W7\nhen the flower is fallen, the cup fwells in the middle into the form of an\nolive, which by degrees grows into a fruit divided into two cells, which in drying\nbecome fliorter, and the whole fruit rounder than in its natural condition.\nThis fruit finally opens longitudinally into two capfules, feparated by a membra-\nnaceous feptum, and coated by a thin yellowifh fkin ; the feeds are of a reddifh co-\nlour, and in fhape are flattifh, and, as it were, fofiaceous \u2022, they are not more than\nthe twentieth part of an inch in diameter, and arethickeft in the middle, becoming\nthinner at each fide. The plancula feminalis lies in the very center of the feed, be-\ntween two pellicles : thefe feeds are fattened in the manner or fo many leales to a\nplacenta of an oblong figure, pointed at the two extremities, lo as fomewhat to re-\n2 fcmble\n\f4 APPENDIX TO\nfemble a feed of the common oat, but that it is longer and flatter. This is joined to\nthe feptum, and has on that part a longitudinal furrow; but on the other fide is\nconvex, and fomewhat rough all over. Mem. Acad. Scienc. Par. 173S. By this\ndefcription it appears, that they were very ignorant of the nature and characters of\nthis tree, who, when it was firft introduced among us, called it a fpecies of febeften.\nThe ufe of this febrifuge feems to have been very long known to the natives, pro-\nbably as early as 15CO, and their manner of taking it was by pounding the bark, and\nlaying it to infufe in water, and drinking the infufion ; their hatred to the Spaniards,\ntheir conquerors, made them keep it a long time a fecret from them ; and when the\nthing became known among the inhabitants of Loxa, it frill remained a fecret to the\nreft of the world, and its great value was never generally known till the year 1653 ;\nwhen the lady of the viceroy of Peru, the countefs de Chinchon, being long ill of an\nintermitting fever, which would give way to none of the known remedies, the cor-\nregidor of Loxa fent to the viceroy a quantity of the quinquina bark, which he allu-\nred him would cure the lady, though all other means had failed. Upon this the cor-\nregidor was fent for to Lima, and, after having given the medicine to many other\nperfons with fafety and fuccefs, the lady at length took it and was cured. She imme-\ndiately on this fent for a large quantity of the bark, had it powdered, and herfelf\ndifperfed it to thofe who had occafion for it ; whence it obtained the name of the\ncountefs\u2019s powder : but this lady being foon tired of the office, gave it in charge to\nthe Jeluits ; and they continuing to give it to the fick with the fame fuccefs, it then\nwas called the Jefuit\u2019s powder. Thefe reverend fathers foon found means to fend\na quantity of it to cardinal Lugo, who difperfed it with the fame fuccefs at Rome\n;\nand after him the apothecary to the college gave it gratis to the poor with the fame\ngood effedts, and under the name of the Jefuit\u2019s, or the cardinal\u2019s powder : afterwards\nthe better lort were made to pay its weight in filverfor it, to defray theexpences of\nits importation, while the poor ftill had it gratis. Lewis XIV. at that time dauphin\nof.France, was cured by it of a fever, which had not given way to other medicines.\nWhen the count and countefs of Chinchon returned to Spain, their phyfician, J uan\nde Vega, who brought a great quantity of it over with him, fold it at a confiderable\nprice; and foon after this, large quantities were fent over by the galleons : but the\ngreat demands from Europe caufing the inhabitants of Loxa to adulterate it with\nother barks, it had like to have loft part of its juft praife. The quinquina-trees are\nfound at this time on all the chain of mountains adjoining to Cajanuma,and in many\nother parts of America.\nWhen bark was firft introduced, it is faidto have been fold for about eight ffiil-\nlings fterling the dofe ; which great price, with the little effe&s found from it, by\nreafon\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 5\nreafon of their ignora .ceof the manner of preparing an ! preferibing ir, occafioned\nits being diluted, till about the year 1679, that Mr. Talbor, anEnglilh practitioner\nin plvyfic, brought it into vogue again, by the great number of cures wrought about\nthe court and city of Paris with this powder, prepared after his manner: the fee ret\nwhereofwas loon after made public by the munificence of LouisXIV. who rewarded\nTalbor for the difeovery with 5,000 crowns. The preparation is about two ounces\nof the cortex in powder, digefted in a land-heat, with about a quart of red wine :\nafter digeftion, the wine mull be poured off, and two or three ounces given every\nthree or four hours between the paroxyfms, till the intention is anfwered.\nThe quinquina is fold either in bark, or in powder : thole who buy it in the bark,\nmull choofe it very dry and compact ; fuch as has never been moillcned, and which\nwill break dole and fmooth, is friable between the teeth, is eafily pulverized, and\nyields a powder of a pale cinnamon colour. It has a multy kind of lmell, and yet\nlb much of the aromatic as not to be dilagreeable. The inferior kinds, when bro-\nken, appear woody, and on chewing feparate into fibres. The female bark is confi-\nderably thicker, whiter on the outlide, redder within, and weaker in fmell and tafte\nthan the former, and much inferior in medicinal virtue. The fmall, fine, quilled\nbarks, fhagrecned without, and reddifh within, of a bitter mully talle, are the molt\nelteemed. The powder mult be well fifted, and care be taken to buy it of perfons\nthat may be trufted \u2022, it being very ealy to fophifticate it, and difficult to find out the\nfraud. The red bark, lately brought into reputation by the experiments of the in-\ngenious Dr. Saunders, pofiefies the virtues of the common bark in a much higher\ndegree. A quantity of it was introduced to London, as part of the cargo of a Spa-\nnilh lh ip from Lima, taken by anEnglilh frigate in 1779 and carried into Lifbon.\nWhether this is the bark of the trunk of full-grown trees, the branches, or young\ntrees yielding the pale bark, or whether the trees be of different fpecies, is not yet\naccurately determined. In the province of Santa-Fe, there has been lately difeover-\ned two kinds of cinchona, one of which is the red bark of Peru, and the other, one\nof the white lpecies.\nThe cortex is a bitter, abforbent, and aftringent, or ftyptic : from its bitternefs,\nM. Reneaume obferves it becomes fit to foften lour acrimonious juices ; for a lour\nand a bitter make a fweet. Again, as an abforbent, it blunts the points of acids,\nand prevents their adlion ;\nand, ol confequence, preferves the fluidity of the juices,\nwhich acids would coagulate. As a ftyptic, it mull have earthy parts to ablorb le-\nrofities, by which the parts, before moiftened and relaxed, will contract themlelves j\nand, by this means, the cortex augments the fpring and tenfion of the fibres. As\na bitter, it warms and it facilitates perfp'raiion by warming and augmenting the\nB fluidity\n\f6 APPENDIX TO\nfluidity of the juices. Its primary operation is that of ftrengthening the folids. On\nthefe properties it is that its medical ufes are afcertained. Its chief ufe is in curing\nof agues, and intermitting fevers \u2022, for which purpofe it is applied in all ages and\nmoft conftitutions.\u2014 It produces this effed better than any other medicine of the\nfame intention, in the ratio of 365 to 1. It is ufual to give a gentle emetic of ipeca-\ncuanha before the exhibition of the cortex : by thus preparing the pafiages, the cor-\ntex has not only more fuccefs, but alfo is notfubjedto caufethofe indifpofitions, viz.\nfwelling in the belly, naufeas, &c. which often arife whenfuch preparation is neg-\nleded. The cortex muft never be exhibited in the paroxyfm of an ague, or inter-\nmitting fever ; but given in fuch a quantity, at times, between the paroxyfms, as\nto prevent a return of the fit. The cortex exhibited in continual fevers, is held dan-\ngerous *, and care muft be taken, that the remiflion of a continual fever be not mif-\ntaken for its intermiffion, which happens at particular or ftated times. The cortex\nis given feveral ways, viz. in powder, in form of eledary, extrad, bolus, infufion,\ntindure, &c. When the ftomach will bear it, the preparation in very fine powder\nis the moil ufeful and agreeable.\nIf the bark take downward, Venice treacle, diafcordium, conferve of rofes, terra\nJaponica, dofes of laudanum, &c. muft be added to its preparations. When there\nhappens to be an obftrudion of the menfes from the exhibition of the cortex, or to\nprevent it, it isadvifable to add to its preparations black hellebore, aethiops mineral,\ncinnabar, &c. The cortex is often ufed for young children in agues, by way of\nclyfter \u2022, and alfo applied to the wrifts, and foies of the feet, wrought up in a ftifF\nmafs, with turpentine, Venice treacle, &c. which ufually anfwers the purpofe. Dr.\nHelvetius, phyfician to the king of France, above twenty years ago, wrote a book\nentirely upon the fubjed of curing agues by giving the cortex clyfter-wife; in which\nhe pretends, that this is more fafe, and no lefs certain, than the cortex given by the\nmouth. Dr. Cockburn, in hisTreatife of Sea Difeafes, aflerts the contrary : he al-\nleges, that the cortex given inwardly is as fafe, and much more certain and expe-\nditious ;\nand notes, that we know how to remedy all the inconveniences the cortex\nmay occafion. Dr. Sydenham, and after him Mr. Reneaume, and others, have\nprefcribed the the cortex, with fuccefs, in melancholic and hyfteric affedions, com-\nmonly called vapours.\nThe virtues of this medicine are at this time fufficiently known i but the largenefs\nof its dofe in the common forms of powder, or infufion in wine or in water, are\ngreat difad vantages ; and our common methods of giving it in theextrad or refin, as\nwe prepare them, not certain, and have their inconveniency. Mr. Geoffroy has\n.attempted a method of giving the bark in all it efficacy, without its ill tafte, and in\none\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 7\none third of the ufual dofe, by means of its dry extraft $ twenty-four grains of\nwhich, it is averted, contain the whole efficacy of a dram of the choice!! bark in\npowder* Hence it appears very evident, that when we take the bark in fubftance,\nit is only about a third part of what we are forced to fwallow that can be of any ufe\nto us ; and that the fame portion is all we can expeCt in the virtues of any decoCtion\nor infufion of it. Mem. Acad. Sci. Par. 1758.\nWine, which is a liquor partly aqueous, partly faline, and partly fpirituous, is a\nmenftruum much properer to extrad the virtues of the bark than mere water, as it\nis much more able to diffolve the juices or fap condenfed and infpiflated in the bark\nof the tree; and for this reafon a ftrong infufion of bark in this menftruum remains\nclear, and keeps the refin fufpended when cold \u2022, in which refped it differs from the\ninfufion in boiling water when cooled, as the refin precipitates itfelf. Thus it is the\nfire alone which can fufpend the refin in a watery infufion of the bark ; and in a vi-\nnous one, the fpirituous and inflammable part of the liquor does the fame thing:\nand as the refin of the bark, which there is great reafon to believe pofteftes all the\nvirtues of that medicine, is wholly precipitated from watery infufions when cold,\nit has been faid there can be but very little dependence placed on the common clear\ninfufions in this menftruum : the remaining tafte in thefe infufions is only a faint\nbitternefs, which arifes from the gummofe and faline parts of the dried juices of the\nbark : the whole concrete, which alone poflefies the virtue of the medicine, being\nof the nature of thofe bodies properly called gum refins, which are but very imperfectly\nfoluble in water, and of which wine is the proper diflfolvent. It has been found, that\ncold water aCting more gradually than boiling water, extracts both the gummy and\nrefinous principles of bark. And infufions made by macerating one ounce of bark\nin fine powder, in eight or twelve of water, without heat, for twenty-four (or even\ntwelve) hours, have been fuccefsfully adminiftered in dofes (of the clear liquor) of\ntwo or threeounces. It is acommon opinion, that bark in fubftance is more effectual\nthan any preparation of it. Lewis, Mat. Med.\nPeruvian bark has been found very effectual in preventing colds. The method\nin which it was ufed, in a cafe mentioned in the Philofophical TranfaCtions, was, af-\nter due preparation, by bleeding or purging, to take two ounces of it every fpring\nand fall. By this method, an habitual taking of cold, and a confequent fore throat,\nwas curedi Phil. Tranf.

The bark has alfo been applied, in conjunction with other medicines, to\nthe cure of periodic head-achs, hyfterkal, hypochondriacal, vertiginous, and epilep-\ntic, complaints. And it is a very ufeful medicine in weaknefs of the ftomach, uterine\nfluxes, and fundry chronical difeafes proceeding from a laxity and debility of the\nfibres.\nMany infiances are recorded by medical writers of the jaundice, dropfy, afthma,\nand all the train of nervous diforders, brought on in a furprifmg fhort time after an\ninjudicious adminiftration of the bark : among others, the curious may confult the\nMed.

The Uiftcry of this difeovery is\n:\nin 1715, Mr. Rufhworth, furgeon in Northampton, gave it to a patient labouring\nunder a mortification j and having afterwards other proofs of its good effects in this\ndifeafe, communicated his difcovei;y in 1731. Mr. Amyand loon tried it in fuch ca-\nfes, and found it fuccefsful in feven. Mr. John Douglas confirmed this by the hif-\ntory of a patient of his, which he publifhed in 1732 j and Mr. Shipton loon after\nrelated his fuccefs by this medicine, to the royal fociety. Mr. Rufhworth and Mr.\nAmyand confirmed its ufe in mortifications from an internal caufe -\n3 the former thinks\nit is not proper in all cafes of that kind, particularly where there is nointermiffion in\nthe fever. Mr. Douglas feems to think it will fucceed in all mortifications. All\nthefe three gentlemen gave half a dram for a dofe every fourth hour. Mr. Shipton\nincreafed the dofe to two fcruples, and gave it while the fever continued. He pro-\npofed to have it tried in nomae, phagedenas, herpes, or other chironion ulcers.\nSome call the gentian-root the European quinquina, becaufe goodagainft intermit-\nting fevers. The fea-fide beech of Jamaica, or Cinchona Carribaea of Linnseus, is\na fpedes of the Jefutt\u2019s bark, produced in Jamaica and the Carribee Hands, which\ntogether with its virtues, has lately been accurately deferibed by Dr. Wright, who\nhas found it very efficacious in the dangerous remittent fevers of the Weft Indies \u2022\nand it has lately been adminiftered in London in intermittents, in which it has ef-\nfected a cure as completely as the Peruvian bark.

It has\na cylindric amentum or catkin, which thickens gradually, and is covered with flow-\ners ; the male and female in a different amentum. In the male, the calyx is two-val-\nved, and the corolla is wanting. In the female, there is no calyx nor corolla the\nftylus is one, and thedrupa is many-celled.\nThough this tree has been mentioned by many voyagers, particularly by Dam-\npier, by Rumphius, and by Lord Anfon, yet very little notice lee ms to have been\ntaken of it till the return of Captain Wallis from the South Seas, and flnce that\ntime by others who have touched at Otaheite and fome countries in EaPc Indies. Cap-\ntain Dampier relates, that in Guam, one of the Ladrone Iflands, \u201c there is a certain\nfruit called the bread-fruit, growing on a tree as big as our large apple-trees, with\ndark leaves. The fruit is round, and grows on the boughs like apples, of the big-\nnefs of a good penny loaf; when ripe, it turns yellow, foft, and fweet : but the\nnatives take it green, and bake it in an oven till the rind is black : this they fcrape\noff, and eat the inflde, which is foft and white,, like the inflde of new- baked bread,\nhaving neither feed nor {tone \u2022, but if it is kept above 24 hours it is harlh. As this\nfruit is in feafon eight months in the year, the natives feed upon no other fort of bread\nduring that time. They told us that all the Ladrone iflands had plenty of it. I never\nheard of it in any other place.\u201d\nRumphius, after defcribing the tree, obferves, that \u201c the fruit is fhaped like a\nheart, and increafes to the fize of a child\u2019s head. Its furface or rind is thick, green,\nand covered every where with warts of a quadragonal or hexagonal figure, like cut\ndiamonds, but without points. The more flat and fmooth thefe warts are, the few-\ner feeds are contained in the fruit, and the greater is the quantity of pith, and that of\na more glutinous nature. The internal part of the rind, or peel, conflfls of a flefliy\nfubftance, full of twifted fibres, which have the appearance offline wool ; thefe ad^\nhere to, and in fome meafure form, it. The fiefhy part of this fruit becomes fofter\ntowards the middle, where there is a final! cavity formed without any nuts or feeds,\nexcept in one fpecies, which has but a lrnall number, and this fort is not good, un-\nlefs it is baked or prepared fome other way : but, if the outward rind be taken off, and\nthe fibrous flelh dried and afterwards boiled with meat as we do cabbage, it has then\nthe tafte of artichoke bottoms. The inhabitants of Amboyna drefs it in the liquor\nof cocoa-nuts ; but they prefer it roafted on coals till the outward part or peel is\nburnt. They afterwards cut it into pieces, and eat it with the milk of the cocoa-nut.\nC Some\n\fto APPENDIX TO\nSome people make fritters of it, or fry it in oil ; and others, as the Sumatrians,\ndry the internal foft part, and keep it to ufe inftead of bread with other food. It\n2.ffords a great deal ofnourifhment, and is very fatisfying, therefore proper for hard-\nworking people : and, being of a gentle aftringent quality, is good for perfons of a\nlaxative habit of body.\n<c\nIt is more nourifhing boiled in our mariner with fat meat than roafted on coals.\nThe milky juice which diftils from the trunk, boiled with the cocoa-nut oil, makes\na very ftrong bird-lime. This tree is to be found on the eaftern parts of Sumatra,\nand in the Malay language is called foccus and foecum capas. It grows likewife about\nthe town of Bantam in Java, and in Ballegaand Madura, and is known there by the\nname offoccnm\nIn Anfords voyage we are informed, \u201c that the rima, or bread-fruit tree, is com-\nmon in all the Ladrone iflands and fome of the Philippines. It is fomewhat larger\nthan our apple-tree, and bears a broad dark-coloured leaf with five indentures on\neach fide. The fruit hangs on boughs like apples : and is of the fize of a penny loaf,\nwith a thick tough rind, which when full-ripe turns yellow. The natives gather it\nbefore it is quite ripe, a red bake it till the cruft is pretty black; then they rafp it, and\nthere remains a pretty loaf, with a tender yellow cruft, and the crumb of it is foft\nand fweet as a new-baked roll : it is without eny feeds or (tones. This fruit the in-\nhabitants enjoy for about feven months ; during which they never eat any other kind\nof bread : but they are obliged to bake it every day ; for, when it grows a little\nHale, it becomes harlh and bulky, fomewhat like the potatoe-bread made in the weft\nof England. There is, however, a remedy for this ; which is cutting the loaf into\ndices when it i-s new, and drying it in the fun, by which it is changed into the plea-\nfanteft rulk that can be eaten.*\u2019\nCaptain Cook, in his voyage, obferves, that this fruit not only ferves as a fub-\nftitute for bread among the inhabitants ofOtaheite and the neighbouring iflands, but\nalfo, varioufly drafted, compofes the principal part of their food. It grows on a\ntree that is about the fize of a middling oak ; its leaves are frequently a foot and an\nhalf long, of an oblong lhape, deeply finuated like thofeof the fig-tree, which they\nrefemble in colour and confidence, and in the exfuding of a milky juice upon being\nbroken. The fruit is about the fize and lhape of a new-born child\u2019s head : and the\nfurface is reticulated, not much unlike a truffle ; it is covered with a thin lkin, and\nhas a core about as big as the handle of a fmall knife. The eatable part lies between\nthe lkin and the core \u2022, it is as white as fnow, and fomewhat of the confidence of new\nbread ; it mull be roafted before it is eaten, being firft divided into three or four\nparts; its tafte is infipid, with a flight fweetnefs fomewhat refembling that of the\ncrumb\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. it\ncrumb of wheaten bread mixed with a Jerufalem artichoke. This fruit is alfo cook-\ned in a kind of oven ,\nwhich renders it foft, and fomething like a boiled potatoe; noe\nquite fo farinaceous as a good one, but more fo than thofe of the middling fort. Of\nthe bread-fruit they alfo make three difhes, by putting either water or the milk of\nthe cocoa-nut to it, then beating it to a pafte with a (lone peftle, and afterwards\nmixing it with ripe plantains, bananas, or the four pafee which they call mahie.\nThemahie, which is likewife made to ferve as a fuccedaneum for ripe bread fruit\nbefore the feafon comes on, is thus made : the fruit of the bread-tree is gathered\njuft before it is perfectly ripe ; and, being laid in heaps, is clofely covered with\nleaves : in this ftate it undergoes a fermentation, and becomes difagreeably fweet :\nthe core is then taken out entire, which is done by gently pulling out the (talk, and\nthe reft of the fruit is thrown into a hole which is dung for that purpofe generally in\nthe houfes, and neatly lined in the bottom and fides with grafs : the whole is then\ncovered with leaves, and heavy ftones laid upon them ; in this ftate it undergoes a\nfecond fermentation, and becomes four, after which it will fuffer no change for many\nmonths. It is taken out of the hole as it is wanted for ufe ; and, being made into\nbails, it is wrapped up into leaves and baked : after it is clreffed, it will keep five\nor fix weeks. It is eaten both cold and hot ; and the natives feldom make a meal\nwithout it, though to Europeans the trfte is as difagreeable as that of a pickled olive\ngenerally is the firft time it is eaten. The fruit itfelf Is in feafon eight months in\nthe year, and the mahie fupplies the inhabitants during the other four.\nTo procure this principal article of their food (the bread-fruit) cofts thefe happy\npeople no trouble or labour except climbing up a tree ; the tree which produces it\ndoes not indeed grow fpontaneoufly ; but, if a man plants ten of them in his life-time,\nwhich he may do in about an hour, he will as completely fulfil his duty to his own\nand future generations as the native of our lefs temperate climate can do by plough-\ning in the cold of winter, and reaping in the lummer\u2019s heat, as often as thefe feafons\nreturn ;\neven if, after he has procured bread for his prefent houfehold, he Ihould\nconvert afurplus into money, and lay it up for his children.\nThere are two fpecies of artccarpus, viz. the incifus, with gaftsed leaves ; and the\nintegrifolia, with entire leaves. There is alfo laid to be another diftinbtion, into\nthat which bears fruit with ftones or feeds, and that in which the fruit has none.\nThe parts of frudtification of that tree which bears the fruit without ftones are defec-\ntive. The amentum, or catkin, which contains the male parts, never expands.\nThe ftyli, or female part of the fruit, are likewife deficient. From which it follows\nthat there can be no ftones or feeds, and therefore that this tree can be propagated\nonly by fuckers or layers j although it is abundantly evident that it mult originally\nhave\n\f*& APPENDIX TO\nHave proceeded from the feed-bearing bread-fruit tree. Inftances of this kind we\nfometimes find in European fruits \u2022, fuch as the barberry, and the Corinthian grape\nfrom Zant commonly called currants, which can therefore be increafed only by lay-\ners and cuttings. Dr. Solander wasaffured by the oldeft inhabitants of Otaheite and\nthe adjoining Hands, that they well remember there was formerly plenty of the feed-\nbearing bread-fruit j,\nbut they had been negle&ed upon account of the preference\ngiven to the bread-fruit without feeds, which they propagate by fuckers.\nCASHEW - NUT TREE.\nANACARDIUM, the cafhew-nut tree, is a genus of the monogynia order, be-\nlonging to the decandria clafs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under\nthe 1 2th order, Holoraceae. The characters are : The calyx is divided into five\nparts, the divifions ovate and deciduous ; the corolla confifts of five reflected pe-\ntals, twice the length of the calyx; the ftamina confifts of ten capillary filaments\nfhorter than the calyx, one of them caftrated the antherae are fmall and roundifh :\nthe piftil has a roundifh germen ; the ftilus is fubulated, infledted, and the length\nat the corolla ; the ftigma oblique: there is no pericarpium ; the receptaculum\nis very large and flefhy : the feed is a large kidney-ftiaped nut, placed above the\nreceptaculum.\nOf this only one fpecies is as yet known to the botanifts, viz, the occidenrale.\nIt grows naturally in the Weft Indies, and arrives at the height of 20 feet in thofe\nplaces of which it is a native ; but cannot be preferved in Britain without the grea-\nteft difficulty. The fruit of this tree is as large as an orange * and is full of an acid\njuice, which is frequently made ufe of in making punch. To the apex of this fruit\ngrows a nut, of the fize and fliape of a hare\u2019s kidney, but much larger at the end\nwhich is next the fruit than at the other. The fhell is very hard ; and the kernel\nwhich is fweet and pieafant, is covered with a thin film. Between this and the fhell\nis lodged a thick, blackifb, inflammable, liquor, of fuch a cauftic nature in the frefh\nnuts, that, if the lips chance to touch it, blifters will immediately follow. The\nkernels are eaten raw, roafted, or pickled. The cauftic liquor juft mentioned is\nefteemed an excellent cofmetic with the Weft-India young ladies, but they muft\ncertainly foffer a great deal of pain in its application ; and, as fond as our Britifh fe-\nmales are of a beautiful face, it is highly probable they would never fubrnit to be\nflayed alive to obtain one. When any of the former fancy themfelves too much tan-\nned by the fcorching rays of the fun, they gently ferape off the thin outfide of the\nftone, and then rub their faces all over with the ftone. Their faces immediately\nfv\/ell\n\f\f\f\f16\n\fI\nC U L P E P E R\u2019s BRITISH H E R B A L. i\n3\nfwell and grow black : and the {kin being poifoned by the cauftic oil above-men-\ntioned, will in thefpace of five or fix days come entirely off in large flakes, fo that\nthey cannot appear in public in lefs than a fortnight ; by which time the new fkin\nlooks as fair as that of a new-born child. The negroes in Brazil cure themfelves\neffectually of diforders in the ftomach by eating of the yellow fruit of this tree ; the\njuice of which, being acid, cuts the thick tough humours which obftruCted the free\ncirculation of the blood, and thus removes the complaint. This cure, however, is\nnot voluntary : for their matters, the Portuguefe, deny them any other fuftenance \u2022,\nand letting themloofe to the woods, where the cafhew-nuts grow in great abundance,\nleave it in their option to perifh by famine or fuftain themfelves with this fruit.\nThe milky juice of this tree will ftain linen of a good black, which cannot be\nwafhed out.\nThis plant is eafily raifed from the nuts, which fliould be planted each in a fepa-\nrate pot filled with light fandy earth, and plunged into a good hot- bed of tanners\nbark-, they muff alfo be kept from moiftuie till the plants come up, otherwife the\nnuts are apt to rot. If the nuts are frefb, the plants will come up in about a month \u2022,\nand in two months more, they will be four or five inches high, with large leaves :\nfrom which quick progrefs many people have been deceived, imagining they would\ncontinue the like quick growth afterwards; bur, with all the care chat can be taken,\nthey never exceed the height of two feet and an half, and for the moft part fcarcely\nhalf as much. The Indians eat the nuts flightly roafted, dipped in water or wine,\nand fprinlded with fait, as a provocative to venery, to which they are found a mod\nremarkable ftimulus. Thejuice will flop a diarrhoea, and cure a diabetes; and the\noil is ufed by painters to give their colour a lading black, and to preferve wood from\nputrefaction.\nCANELLA ALBA.\nTHE canella alba is a genus of the monogynia order belonging to the dodecandria\nclafs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the twelfth order, holora-\nceae. The calyx is three-lobed; the petals are five ; the anthers fixteen, growing\nto an urceolated or bladder-fhaped neftarium ; and the fruit is a trilocular berry,\nwith two feeds. There is but one fpecies, the alba; which grows ulually about\ntwenty feet high, and eight or ten inches in thicknefs, in the thick woods of mod\nof the Bahama iflands. The leaves are narrow at the dalk, growing wider at their\nends, which are broad and rounding, having a middlerib only ;\nthey are very fmooth,\nand of a light fhining green. In May and June the flowers, which are pentapeta-\nlous, come forth in clufters at the ends of the branches : they are red, and very fra-\ngrant, and are fucceeded by round berries, of the fizeof large peas, green, and when\nNo. 27. D ripe\n\f14 APPENDIX TO\nripe (which is in February) purple, containing two fhining black feeds, flat on one\nfide, otnerwife not unlike in fhape to a kidney-bean : thefe feeds in the berry are en-\nveloped in a flimy mucilage. The whole plant is very aromatic, the bark particu-\nlarly, being more ufed in diftilling, and in greater efteem in the more northern parts\nof the world than in Britain.\nThe bark is the canella alba of the (hops. It is brought to us rolled up into long\nquills, thicker than cinnamon, and both outwardly and inwardly of a whicifh co-\nlour, lightly inclining to yellow. Infufions of it in water are of a yellowifh colour,\nand fmell of the canella ; but they are rather bitter than aromatic. Tinbtures in\nrectified fpirit have the warmth of the bark, but little of its fmell. Proof- fpirit dif-\nfolves the aromatic as well as the bitter matter of the canella, and is therefore the\nbeft menftruum.\nThe canella is the interior bark freed from an outward thin rough one, and dried\nin the fhade. The fhops dilfinguifli two forts of canella, differing from each other\nin the length and thicknefs of the quills : they are both the bark of the fame tree\n;\nthe thicker being taken from the trunk, and the thinner from the branches. This\nbark is a warm pungent aromatic, though not of the moil agreeable kind ; nor are\nany of the preparations of it very grateful.\nCanella alba is often employed where a warm ftimulant to the ftomach is neceffa-\nry, and as a corringent'of other articles. It is now, however, little ufed in compofi-\ntions by the London college ; the only official formula which it enters being the pul-\nvis aloeticus : but with the Edinburgh college it is an ingredient in the tindtura araa-\nra, vinum amarum, vinum rhei, &c. It is ufeful as covering the take of fome other\narticles.\u2014This bark has been confounded with that called winter\u2019s bark, which be-\nlongs to a very different tree.\nCOFFEE-TREE.\nTHE coffee-tree is fuppofed to be a native of Arabia Felix. It feldom rifes more\nthan fixteen or eighteen feet in height ;\nthe main ftera grows upright, and is cover-\ned with a light- brown bark ; the branches are produced horizontally and oppofite,\ncroffingeach other at a every joint ; fo that every fide of the tree is fully garnifhed\nwith them, and they form a fort of pyramid. The leaves alfo ftand oppofite; and\nwhen fully grown are about four or five inches long, and two broad in the middle,\ndecreafing toward each end; the borders are waved, and the furface is of a lucid\ngreen. The flowers are produced in clulters at the root of the leaves, Acting dole\nto the branches; they aretubulous, and fpread open at the top, where they are di-\nvided into five parts; they are of a pure white, and have a very grateful odour, but\nare of Ihort duration. The fruit, which is the only ufeful part, refembles a cherry.\nIt\n\f\f-\n\/\nj\nSI-\nf'\n\f15\nCULPEPER*s BRITISH HERBAL.\nIt grows in clutters, and is ranged along the branches under the axillae of the leaves,\nof the fame green as the laurel, but fomething longer. When it comes to be oi a\ndeep red, it is gathered for the mill, in order to be manufactured into thofe coffee-\nbeans now fo generally known. The mill is compoled ot two wooden rollers, tur-\nnifhed with iron plates eighteen inches long, and ten or twelve in diameter. T. he.e\nmoveable rollers are made to approach a third wnich is nxed, anu which they call\nthe chops. Above the rollers is a hopper, in which they put the coffee, from whence\nit falls between the rollers and the chops, where it is ftripped of its firft fkin, and\ndivided into two parts, as may be feen by the form of it after it has undergone this\noperation ; being fiat on the one fide and round on the other. From this machine\nit falls into abrafs fieve, where the fkin drops between the wires, while the fruit Aides\nover them into bafkets placed ready to receive it : it is then thrown into a veficl full\nof water, where it foaks for one night, and is afterwards thoroughly wafhed. Vv hen\nthe whole is finifhed, and well dried, it is put into another machine called the peel-\ning-mill. This is a wooden grinder, turned vertically upon its trendle by a mule or\nhorfe. In paffing over the coffee it takes off the parchment, which is nothing but\na thin fkin that detaches itfelf from the berry in proportion as it grows dry. The\nparchment being removed, it is taken out of this mill to be put into another, which\nis called the winnowing-mill. This machine is provided with four pieces of tin\nfixed upon an axle, which is turned by a Have with confiderable force \u2022, and the\nwind that is made by the motion of thefe plates clears the coffee of all the pellicles\nthat are mixed with it. It is afterwards put upon a table, where the broken ber-\nries, and any filth that may remain among them, are feparated by negroes ; after\nwhich the coffee is fit fotfale. The coffee-tree is cultivated in Arabia, Perfia, the\nEaft-Indies, the I fie of Bourbon, and feveral parts of America. It is alfo raifed\nin botanic gardens in feveral parts of Europe. Prince Eugene\u2019s garden at Vienna\nproduced more coffee than was fufficient for his own confumption. It delights\nparticularly in hills and mountains, where its root is almoft always dry, and its head\nfrequently watered with gentle fhowers. It prefers a wettern afpeft, and ploughed\nground without any appearance of grafs. The plants fhould be placed at eight\nfeet diflance from each other, and in holes twelve or fifteen inches deep. If left to\nthemfelves, they would rife to the height of fixteen or eighteen feet, as already ob-\nferved ; but they are generally ttinted to five, for the conveniency of gathering their\nfruit with the greater eafe. Thus dwarfed, they extend their branches fo, that they\ncover the whole fpot round about them. They begin to yield fruit the third year,\nbut are not in full bearing till the fifth. With the lame infirmities that moil; other\ntrees are fubjebt to, thele are likewife in danger of being deftroyed by a worm or by\nthe fcorching ra>s of the fun. The hills where the coffee-trees are found have ge-\nnerally\n\fi 6 APPENDIX T O\nnerally a gravelly or chalky bottom. In the laft, it languifhes for fome time and\nthen dies: in the former, its roots, which feldom fail of ftriking between ftones, ob-\ntain nourifhment, and keep the tree alive and fruitful for thirty years. This is near-\nly the period for plants of the coffee-tree. The proprietor at the end of this period,\nnot only finds himfelf without trees, but has his land fo reduced, that it is not fit\nfor any kind of culture; and unlefs he is fo fituated, that he can break up a fpot of\nvirgin land, to make himfelf amends for that which is totally exhaufted by the cof-\nfee-trees, his lofs is irreparable.\nThe coffee produced in Arabia is found fo greatly to excel that railed in the Ame-\nrican plantations or elfewhere, that the cultivation of the tree is now but feidom\npradtifed in any of the Britifh colonies. Large plantations of this kind were for-\nmerly made in fome of them ; and it was propofed to the parliament to g\n:\nve a\nproper encouragement for cultivating this commodity there, fo as to enable the\nplanters to underfed the importers from Arabia. Accordingly, there was an abate-\nment of the duty payable on all coffee imported from our colonies in America, which\nat that time was fuppofed to be fufficient encouragement for this kind of commerce;\nbut the inferiority of the American coffee to the Arabian hath almoft ruined the\nproject. Mr. Miller propofes fome improvements in the method of cultivation.\nAccording to him, the trees are planted in too moift a foil, and the berries are ga-\nthered too foon. They ought, he fays, to be permitted to remain on the trees till\nheir fkins are Oari veiled, and they fall from the trees when fhaken. This will in-\ndeed greatly diminifh their weight, but the value of the commodity will thereby be\nincreafed to more than double of that which is gathered fooner. In Arabia, they al-\nways (hake the berries off the trees, fpreading cloths to receive them, and only take\nfuch as readily fall at each time. Another caufe may be the method of drying the\nberries. They are, he obferves, very apt to imbibe moifture, or the flavour of any\nthing placed near them. A bottle of rum placed in a clofet, in which a canifter of\ncoffee-berries clofely flopped was (landing on a fhelf at a confiderable diftance, in a\nfew days fo impregnated the berries as to render them very difagreeable : the fame\nhas alfo happened by a bottle of fpirit of wine (landing in the fame clofet with cof-\nfee and tea, both which were in a few days fpoiled by it. Some years ago, a coffee-\nfbip from India had a few bags of pepper put on-board, the flavour of which was\nimbibed by the coffee, and the whole cargo fpoiled. For thefe reafons, Mr. Mil-\nler diredts that coffee-berries fhould never be brought over in (hips freighted with\nrum, nor laid to dry in the houfes where fugars are boiled or rum diftilled. When\nthey are fully ripe, they (hould be (haken off when the trees are perfectly dry, and\nfpread upon cloths in the fun to dry, carrying them every evening under cover, to\nprevent the dews or rain from falling on them. When perfectly dry, they (hould\n\u201e have\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL 17\nhave their outer Heins beaten off, and then be carefully packed up in cloths or bags\nthree or four times double.\nThe coffee-tree, as we have already obferved, is fometimes cultivated in European\ngardens : but for this it requires the affiftance of a flove. It makes a fine appear-\nance at all feafons of the year (being an evergreen), but efpecially when in Sower,\nand when the berries are red, which is generally in the winter, fo that they continue\na long time in that Hate. It is propagated from the berries : but they muH be plant-\ned immediately when gathered from the tree, for they lofe their vegetative quality\nin a very fhort time : when they have beenfent abroad, they have conftantly failed in\nthofe that have been a fortnight on their journey \u2022, fo that, where thefe trees are de-\nfired, the young plants muft be fent, if it be at any diHance from the place where\nthey grown The frefh berries may be planted in fmallpots, and plunged into a hot-\nbed of tanners bark. If the bed be of a proper temperature, the young plants will\nappear in a month or five weeks time; and in fix weeks more will be ready for tranf-\nplanting into feveral pots. During fummer, they muft be frequently watered ; but\nnot in too great plenty, otherwife the roots will be apt to rot. The firft fign of the\nplants being difordered is their leaves fweating out a clammy juice; after which\nthey are over-run with infeffs, that cannot be deftroyed till the plants have recover-\ned their health ; fo that, on the firft appearance of thefe infedts, the trees fhould be\nremoved into frefh earth, and all poffible care taken to recover them. The difor-\nders incident to them, generally proceedeitber from their having been put into large\npots, or from the earth about them being too ftiff or over-watered. The moft pro-\nper foil for them is that of a kitchen-garden, which is naturally loofe, and notfub-\njedt to bind, efpecially if it has conftantly been well wrought and dunged.\nExplanation of the Plate.\nA. reprefents the flower, cut open to fhew the fltuationof the five filaments, with\ntheir fummits lying upon them.\nB. the flower-cup, with its four fmall indentations, inclofing the germen, or em-\nbryo feed-veflfcl ; from the middle of which arifes the ftyle, terminated by the two\nreflexed fpungy tops.\nC. the fruit intire ; marked at the top with a pundture, like a navel.\nD. the fruit open, to fhew that it confifts of two feeds ; which are furrounded\nby the pulp.\nE. the fruit cut horizontally, to fhew the feeds as they are placed eredt, with their\nflat fides together.\nF. one of the feeds taken out, with the membrane or parchment upon it.\nG. the fame, with the parchment torn open, to give a view of the feed.\nH. the feed without the parchment.\nNo. 27. E The\n\fAPPENDIX TO\nThe origin of coffee as a common drink is not well known. Some afcribe it to\nthe prior of a monaftery \u2022, who being, informed by a goat- herd, that his cattle feme-\ntimes browzing on the tree would wake and caper all night, became curious to prove\nits virtue: accordingly, he firft tried it op his monks, to prevent their deeping at\nmatins. Others, from Sehehabeddin, refer the invention of coffee to the Perfians:\nfrom whom it was learned in the 15th century by Gemaleddin, mufti of Aden, a city\nnear the mouth of the Red Sea ; and who having tried its virtues himfelf, and found\nthat it biffipated the fumes which oppreffed the head, infpired joy, opened the bow-\nels, and prevented deep, without being incommoded by it, recommended it firft to\nhis dervifes, with whom he ufed to fpend the night in prayer. Their example\nbrought coffee into vogue at Aden ; the profeffors of the law for ftudy, artifans to\nwork, travellers to walk in the night, in fine, every body at Aden drank coffee,\nlienee it paffed to Mecca ; where firft the devotees, then the reft of the people,\ntook it. From Arabia Felix it paffed to Cairo. In 1511, Kahie Beg prohibited it,\nfrom aperfuafion that it inebriated, and inclined to things forbidden. But Sultan\nCaufou immediately after took off the prohibition ; and coffee advanced from Egypt\nto Syria and Conftantinople. Thevenot, the traveller, was the firft who brought\nit into France ;\nand a Greek fervant, named Pafqua, brought into England by Mr.\nDaniel Edwards, a Turkey merchant, in 2652, to make his coffee, firft fet up the pro-\nfeffion of ccffee-man, and introduced the drink into this ifland.\nIn the year 1714, the magiftrates of Amfterdam, in order to pay a compliment\nto Lewis XIV. king of France, prefented to him an elegant plant of this rare tree,\ncarefully and judicioufly packed up to go by water, and defended from the weather\nby a curious machine covered with glafs. The plant was about five feet high, an\ninch in diameter in the ftem, and was in full foliage, with both green and ripe fruit.\nIt was viewed in the river, with great attention and curiofity, by feveral members of\nthe academy of fciences,'and was afterwards conduced to the royal garden at Mar-\nly, under the care of Monfieur de Juffieu, the king\u2019s profeffor of botany; who\nhad, the year before, written a memoir, printed in the hiftory of the academy of\nfciences of Paris, in the year 1713, deferibing the characters of this genus, toge-\nther with an elegant figure of it, taken from a fmaller plant, which he had received\nthat year from Monfieur Pancras, burgomafter of Amfterdam, and director of the\nbotanical garden there.\nIn 1718, the Dutch colony at Surinam began firft to plant coffee; and, in 1722,\nMonfieur de ia Motte Aigron, governor of Cayenne, having bufinefs at Surinam,\ncontrived, by an artifice, to bring away a plant from thence, which, in the year\n3725, had produced many thoufands.\nIn\n\fCULPEPERS\ns BRITISH HERBAL. 19\nIn 1727 the French, perceiving that this acquifition might be of great advantage\nin their colonies, conveyed to Martimco fome of the plants ; from whence it moft\nprobably fpread to the neighbouring iflands ;\nfor, in the year 1732, it was cultivated\nin Jamaica, and an aft palled to encourage its growth in that lfland.\u2014 Thus was\nlaid the foundation of a moft extenfive and beneficial trade to the European fet-\ntlements in the Weft indies.\nThe preparation of coffee confifts in roafting, or giving it a juft degree of torre-\nfaftion, on an earthern or metalline plate, till it has acquired a brownilh hue equal-\nly deep on all fides. It is then ground in a mill, as much as ferves the prefent oc-\ncafion. A proper quantity of water is next boiled, and the ground coffee put into\nit. After it has juft boiled, it is taken from the fire, and, the decoftion having flood\na while to fettle and fine, they pour or decant it into dilhes. The ordinary method\nof roafting coffee amongft us is in a tin cylindrical box full of holes, through the\nmiddle whereof runs a fpit: under this is a femicular hearth, whereon is a large\ncharcoal -fire: by help of a jack the fpit turns fwift, and fo roafts the berry-, be-\ning now and then taken up to be fhaken. When the oil rifes, and it is grown of a\ndark-brown colour, it is emptied into two receivers made with large hoops whofe\nbottoms are iron plates : there the coffee is fhaken, and left till almoft cold; and,\nif it look bright and oily, it is a fign it is well done.\nVery different accounts have been given of the medicinal qualities of this berry.\nTo determine its real effefts on the human body. Dr, Percival has made feveral\nexperiments, the refult of which he gives in the following words :\n\u201c From thefe ob-\nfervations we may infer, that coffee is (lightly aftringent, and antifeptic; that it mo-\nderates alimentary fermentation, and is powerfully fedative. Its aftion on the ner-\nvous fyftem probably depends on the oil it contains ; which receives its flavour, and\nis rendered mildly empyreumatic, by the procefs of roafting. Neumann obtained\nby diftillation from one pound of coffee, five ounces five drachms and a half of\nwater, fix ounces and half a drachm of thick fetid oil, and four ounces and two\ndrachms of a caput mortuum. And it is well known, that rye,, torrefied with a\nfew almonds, wnich furnifh the neceffary proportion of oil, is now frequently em-\nployed as a iubftitute for thefe berries.\n\u201c The medicinal qualities of coffee feem to be derived from the grateful fenfation\nwhi<. h it produces in the ftomach, and from the fedative powers it exerts on the vis\nvita. Hence it affifts digeftion, and relieves the head-ach ; and is taken in large\nquantities, with peculiar propriety, by the Turks and Arabians; becaufe it coun-\nterafts the narcotic effefts of opium, to the life of which thofe nations are much\naddifted.\n\u201c In\n3\n\f20 APPENDIX TO\n\u201cIn delicate habits, it often occafions watchfulnefs, tremors, and many of thofe\ncomplaints which are denominated nervous. It has been even fufpeCted of produ-\ncing palfies \u2022, and, from my own obfervation, I (hould apprehend not entirely with-\nout foundation. Slare affirms, that he became paralytic by the too liberal ufe of\ncoffee, and that his diforder was removed by abftinencefrom that liquor.\u201d\n\u201c The following curious and important obfervation is extracted from a letter with\nwhich I was honoured by Sir John Pringle, in April 1773 :\n6\nOn reading your\nfeCtion concerning coffee, one quality occurred to me which I had obferved of that\nliquor, confirming what you have faid of its fedative virtues. It is the bell abater\nof the paroxyfm of the periodic afthma that I have feen. The coffee ought to be\nof the belt JVIocco, newly burnt, and made very ftrong immediately after grinding\nit. I have commonly ordered an ounce for one diffi \u2022, which is to be repeated frefh\nafter the interval of a quarter or half an hour ; and which I direCt to be taken with-\nout milk or fugar. The medicine in general is mentioned by Mufgrave, in his trea-\ntife Be Arthritide anomala \u2022, but I firft heard of it from a phyfician in this place, who,\nhaving once pradtifed in Litchfield, had been informed by the old people of that\nplace, that Sir John Floyer, during the latter years of his life, kept free from, or at\nleaft lived eafy under, his afthma, from the ufe of very ftrong coffee. This difcove-\nry, it feems, he made after the publication of his book upon that difeafe.\u2019 Since\nthe receipt of that letter, I have frequently directed coffee in the afthma with great\nfuccefs\u201d\nCITRUS, or FORBIDDEN-FRUIT TREE.\nTHE forbidden-fruit tree, in trunk, leaves, and flowers, very much refembles the\ncommon orange-tree \u2022, but the fruit, when ripe, is larger and longer than the biggeft\norange. It has fomewhat the tafte of a fhaddock ; but far exceeds that, as well as\nthe be ft orange, in its delicious tafte and flavour. They are elegant evergreens, ri-\nling in this country from about five to ten feet in height ; forming full and hand-\nfome heads, clofely garnifhed with beautiful large leaves all the year round, and put-\nting forth a profufion of fweet flowers in fpring and early in fummer *, which even\nin this climate are often fucceeded by abundance of fruit that fometimes arrive at\ntolerable perfection. Though all the varieties were originally obtained by feed, yet\nthe only certain method of continuing the approved varieties is by budding or\ninarching them on ftocks raifed from feed to a proper fize. As the young trees,\nhowever, are brought in plenty from abroad, this method is never praCtifed in this\ncountry: but, for curiofity, it may be done by thofe who are fo inclined, in the fol-\nlowing manner: Early in the fpring procure fome kernels, which may be had in\nplenty from rotten fruits, or others that are properly ripened. Sow the kernels in\nMarch,\n\f\f22 APPENDIX TO\nthefe fliould be chofen preferably to others \u2022, as they will form the mod regular\nheads. Preparatory to their planting, they muft be placed for a day or two in tubs\nof water to plump their bark and roots; after this they muft be walhed and clean-\ned, their branches trimmed to half a foot long, and the roots freed from difeafed\nparts, and all the fmall dried fibres. Then they are to be planted in pots filled with\nlight rich earth ; and plunged in a tan-bed, where they are to remain for three or\nfour months; after which they are to be trained to the open air, but will not bear\nit longer than from the end of May till the middle or end of Odtober.\nSometimes thefe trees, inftead of being kept in pots or tubs, are planted in the\nfull ground ; and, where this can be done, it is by far the moft eligible method.\nWhere this is intended, there muft be frames eredted for the fupport of glafs and\nother covers, to defend the plants during inclement weather ; and in this flotation\nthe trees generally fhoot ftrong, produce large fruit, and may be trained either as\nwall or ftandard trees. A fouth wall, in a dry fituation, is proper for training them\nas wall-trees \u2022, againft which may be ereded wooden frame- work Hoping, either fix-\ned or movable, for the fupport of glafs frames for winter ; likewife, for the greater\nprotedion of the trees in fevere frofts, there may be a fire-place with a flue or two\ncarried along a low wall in the fronts and ends. To have the trees as ftandards, a\nmore capacious and lofty glafs cafe fhould be ereded againft the wall, in the man-\nner of a hot-houfe, but higher; in this one or two rows may be planted, differing\nthem to run up as ftandards, with only fome neceffary pruning juft to preferve their\nregularity. In fome places there are lofty movable glafs cafes, fo that two or three\nrows of trees are planted in a confpicuous part of the pleafure-ground. In winter\nthe frame is put over them, and in fummer wholly taken away. The flowering and\nfruit-fetting feafon of all the forts of citrus is in June and July. They are often,\ngreatly loaded with blofloms ; and, when thefe ftand very thick, it is proper to thin\nthem a little, taking off the fmalleft. It is alio to be obferved, that, as the trees\ncontinue blowing and fetting their fruit for three months, when a full crop of fruit\nis fet it is of benefit to the trees and fruit to gather off the fuperabundant bloffoms\nas they are produced, though fome permit them to remain on account of their ap-\npearance.\nG A R C I N I A.\nTHE garcinia is a genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the dodecandria\nclafs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 1 8th order, Bicornes.\nThe calyx is tetraphyllous inferior ; there are four petals ; the berries are odofper-\nmousj and crowned with a fhield-like ftigma. There is but one fpecies, the man-\ngoftana.\n\f\f\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 23\ngodana, a tree of great elegance, and producing the mod pleafant fruit of any yet\nknown.\nThis tree has been very accurately defcribed by Dr. Garcin, in honour of whom,\nas its mod accurate defcriber, Linnaeus gave it the name garcinia in the 35th vo-\nlume of the Philofophical Tranfaftions. It grows, he informs us, to about feven-\nteen or eighteen feet high, \u201c with a draight taper dem like a fir,\u201d having a regular\ntuft in form of an oblong cone, compofed of many branches and twigs, fpreading\nout equally on all fide\u2019s, without leaving any hollow. Its leaves, he obferves, are\noblong, pointed at both ends, entire, fmooth, of a fhining green on the upper-fide,\nand of an olive on the back. Its flower is compofed of four petals, almod rounds\nor a little pointed : their colour refembles that of a rofe, only deeper and lefs lively.\nThe calyx of this flower is of one piece, expanded, and cut into four lobes. The\ntwo upper lobes are fomething larger than the lower ones \u2022, they are greenifh on the\noutfide, and of a fine deep red within : the red of the upper ones is more lively than\nthat of the lower ones. This calyx inclofes all the parts of the flower ; it is fup-\nported by a pedicle, which is green, and condantly comes out of the end of a twig\nabove the lad pair of leaves. The fruit is round, of the fize of a fmall orange, from\nan inch and an half to two inches diameter. The body of this fruit is a capfula of\none cavity, compofed of a thick rind a little like that of a pomegranate, but fofter,\nthicker, and fuller of juice. Its thicknefs is commonly of a quarter of an inch.\nIts outer colour is of a dark-brown purple, mixed with a little grey and dark-green.\nThe infide of the peel is of a rofe colour, and its juice is purple. Lad of all, this\nfkin is of a dyptic or adringent tade, like that of a pomegranate, nor does it dick to\nthe fruit it contains. The infide of this fruit is a furrowed globe, divided into leg-\nments, much like thofe of an orange, but unequal in fize, which do not adhere to\neach other. The number of thefe fegments is always equal to that of the rays of\nthe top which covers the fruit. The fewer there are of thefe fegments, the bigger\nthey are. There are often in the fame fruit fegments as big again as any of thofe\nthat are on the fide of them. Thefe fegments are white, a little tranfparent, flelhy,\nmembranous, full o! juice like cherries or rafberries ; of a tade of drawberries and\ngrapes together. Each of the fegments inclofes a feed of the figure and fize of an\nalmond dripped of its (hell, having a protuberance on one of its fides. Thefe feeds\nare covered with two fmall fkins, the outermod of which ferves for a bafis to the\nfilaments and membranes of which the pulp is compofed. The fubdance of thefe\nfeeds comes very near to that of chefnuts, as to their confidency, colour, and adrin-\ngent quality.\n\u201c This tree (according to our author) originally grows in the Molucca iflands,\nwhere it is called mangodan -\n} but has been tranfplanted from thence to the iflands\nof\n\f24 APPENDIX TO\nof Java and Malacca, at which laft place it thrives very well. Its tuft is fo fine, fo\nregular, fo equal, and the appearance of its leaves fo beautiful, that it is at prefent\nlooked upon at Batavia as the moft proper for adorning a garden, and affording an\nagreeable fhade. There are few feeds, however, (he obferves,) to be met with in\nthis fruit that are good for planting, moft part of them being abortive.\u201d-\u2014He con-\ncludes his defcription by mentioning, that one may eat a great deal of this fruit\nwithout any inconvenience-, and that it is the only one which fick people may be al-\nlowed to eat without any fcruple.\nOther writers concur in their praifes of this fruit. Rumphius obferves, that the\nmangoftan is univerfally acknowledged to be the beft and wholefomeft fruit that\ngrows in India ; that its flefh is juicy, white, almoft tranfparent, and of as delicate\nand agreeable a flavour as the richeft grapes : the tafte and fmell being fo grateful,\nthat it is fcarcely poflible to be cloyed witheating it.-\u2014He adds, that, when fick peo-\nple have no relilh for any other food, they generally eat this with great delight ; but,\nihould they refufe it, their recovery is no longer expedted. \u201c It is remarkable (fays\nhe) that the mangoftan is given with fafety in almoft every diforder. The dried bark\nis ufed with fuccefs in the dyfentery and tenefmus and an infufion of it is efteem-\ned a good gargle for a fore mouth or ulcers in the throat. The Chinefe dyers ufe\nthis bark for the ground or bafis of a black colour, in order to fix it the firmer.\u201d\nAccording to Captain Cook, in his Voyage round the World, vol. iii. p. 737, the\ngarcinia mangoftana of Linnaeus is peculiar to the Eaft Indies. It is about the fize of\nthe crab- apple, and of a deep red- wine colour. On the top of it is the figure of five\nor fix fmall triangles joined in a circle; and at the bottom feveral hollow green\nleaves, which are remains of the bloffom. When they are to be eaten, the fkin, or\nrather flefli, muft be taken off; under which are found fix or feven white kernels,\nplaced in a circular order ; and the pulp with which thefe are inveloped is the fruit,\nthan which nothing can be more delicious. It is a happy mixture of the tart and\nthe fweet, which is no lels wholefome than pleafant; and, as well as the fweet orange,\nis allowed in any quantity to thofe who are afflidted with a fever either of the putrid\nor inflammatory kind.\nMANCHINEEL-TREE.\nTHIS is a genus of the adelphia order, belonging to the moncecia clafs of plants;\nand in the natural method ranking under the 38th order, Tricoccs.

T he\ntree grows to the fize of a large oak. 2. The biglandulofa, with oblong bay leaves,\nis a native of South America*, and grows to as large a fize as the firft, from which\nit differs tnoftly in the fliape of its leaves. 3. The fpinofa, with holly leaves, is a\nnative of Campeachy, and feldom rifes above twenty feet high *, the leaves greatly\nrefemble thofe of the common holly, and are fet with {harp prickles at the end of\neach indenture. They are of a lucid green, and continue all the year.\nCulture. Thefe plants, being natives of very warm climates, cannot be preserved\nin this country without a ftove ; nor can they by any means be made to rife above\nfive or fix feet high even with that afliftance. They are propagated by feeds ; but\nmuft have very little moifture, or they will certainly be killed by it.\n'Properties. Thefe trees have a very poifonous quality, abounding with an acrid\nmilky juice of a highly cauftic nature. Strangers are often tempted to eat the fruit\nof the firft fpecies ; the confequences of which are, an inflammation of the mouth\nand throat, pains in the ftomach, &c. which are very dangerous unlefs remedies are\nfpeedily applied. The wood is much efteemed for making cabinets, book-cafes,\n&c. being very durable, taking a fine polifh, and not being liable to become worm-\neaten: but as the trees abound with a milky cauftic juice already mentioned, fires\nare made round their trunks to burn out this juice; otherwife thofe who fell the\ntrees would be in danger of lofing their fight by thejuice flying in their eyes. This\njuice raifes blifters on the fkin wherever it falls, turns linen black, and makes itfall\nout in holes. It is alfo dangerous to work the wood after it is fawn out ; for, if any\nof the faw-duft happens to get into the eyes of the workmen, it caufes inflammations\nand the lofs of fight for fome time ; to prevent which, they generally cover their\nfaces with fine lawn during the time of working the wood. It is with thejuice of\nthis tree that the Indians ufed to poifon their arrows.\nMARSH- MALLOW of SURINAM.\nTHIS plant is called at Surinam okkerum, and is an elegant fpecies of the marfh-\nmallows, fo well known to botanifts. It grows about fix feet high, and bears dou-\nble flowers, fome of which are yellow and white, and others red. \u2014If the fruit be cut,\na milky liquor drops out, clammy and in the form of threads; which they boil and\nmake a drink of in America, being famous for internal bruifes, and for moft difeafes\nof the ftomach and bowels.\nBefides this, there are three other fpecies of the marfh-mallow, which I Ihall here\ndefcribe. 1.

The\nflowers come out from under the v\/ings of the leaves, like the mallow, and are of a\npurplifn white. 2. The hirfuta, or hairy marfh-mallow, is a native of Spain and\nPortugal. It is a low plant, whofe branches trail on the ground, unlefs they are fup-\nported by ftakes. The leaves and ftalks are befet with ftrong hairs, the flowers\ncome out like thofe of the common fort, but are fmaller, and have purplifh bot-\ntoms. 3. The cannabina, or flhrubby marfh-mallow, is a native of Hungary and\nIftria. It has a woody ftem, which rifles to the height of four or five feet : and puts\nout many flde-branches. The flowers come out in the fame manner as in the others,\nbut are of a deeper red colour. This fort feldom flowers the firft year, unlefs the\nfummer proves warm : but when the plants live through the winter, they will flower\nearly in the following fummer, and produce good feeds.\nCulture. Though the vulgaris is found naturally in fait marffies, it will thrive\nwhen tranfplanted into any foil, or in any fituation ; however, it will always grow\nlarger in moift than in dry foil. It may be propagated either by parting the roots\nin autumn when the ftalks decay, or by fowing the feeds in the fpring. If the feeds\nof the fecond fpeciesare fown in April, the plants will flower in July, and carry ripe\nfeed in September. They ought to be fown in the places where they are to remain,\nas the roots fhoot deep in the ground : fo that unlefs the plants are removed very\nyoung, they feldom furvive it. The feeds of the cannabina ought alfo to be fown\nwhere the plants are to remain, for the reafon juft now given. They fhould have a\nfheltered fituation and a dry foil, otherwife they will not live through the winter.\nIndeed they feldom continue in this country above two years, with all the care that\ncan be taken of them.\nMedicinal Ufcs\n:\nThe vulgaris is the only fpecies ufed in medicine. The whole\nplant, efpecially the root, abounds with a mild mucilage. It has the general virtues\nof an emollient medicine \u2022, and proves ferviceable in a thin acrimonious ftate of the\njuices, and where the natural mucus of the inteftines is abraded. It is chiefly recom-\nmended in (harp defluxions upon the lungs, hoarfenefs, dyfenteries ; and likewife in\n.nephritic and calculous complaints ; not, as fome have fuppofed, that this medicine\nhas any peculiarpower of diflolving or expelling the calculus \u2022, but as, by lubricating\nand relaxing the vefiels, it procures a more free and eafy pafiage. The root is fome-\ntimes employed externally for foftening and maturating hard tumours chewed, it is\nfaid to giveeafe in difficult dentition of children.\nThis root gave name to an officinal fyrup, decodlion, and ointment *, and was like-\nwife an ingredient in the compound powder of gum tragacanth and the oil and\nplaifter of mucilages. But of all thefe formulae the fyrup alone is now retained.\n'\n3\nI4AN-\n\fC U L P E PER\u2019s BRITISH HERBAL; 27\nMANDRAKE.\nTHE fruit of this plant has been much recommended in cafes of barrennefs. Its\nfrefflroot is a violent purge, thedofe being from ten grains to twenty in fubftance,\nand from half a drachm to a drachm in infufion. It has been found to do fervice in\nhyfteric complaints ; but mult be ufed with great caution, otherwife it will bring on\nconvulfions, and many other mifchievous fymptoms. It has alfo a narcotic quality.\nAt prefent only the frefh leaves are fometimes ufed in anodyne and emollient cata-\nplafms and fomentations. It ufed to be an ingredient in one of the old officinal un-\nguents ; but both that and the plant itfelf are now rejected from our pharmaco-\npoeias. It ftill however retains a place in the foreign ones, and may perhaps be con-\nfidered as deferving farther attention.\nNaturalifts tell ftrange ftories of this plant : but fetting afide its foporiferous vir-\ntue, the modern botanifts will fcarcely warrant any of them, nor even that human\nfigure ordinarily afcribed to its roots, efpecially fince the difcovery of the artifice of\ncharlatans in fafhioning it, to furprifethe credulity of the people. The figure given\nm the annexed plate, however, was taken from a genuine root,\nMofes informs us (Gen. xxx. 14.) that Reuben the fon of Leah, being in the\nfield, happened to find mandrakes, which he brought home to his mother. Rachel\nhad a mind to them, and obtained them from Leah, upon condition that ffie ffiould\nconfent that Jacob ffiould be Leah\u2019s bedfellow the night following. The term\ndudaim,\nhere made ufe of by Mofes, is one of thofe words of which the Jews at this\nday do not underhand the true fignification. Some tranfiate it violets, others lilies,\nor jefiamine. Junius calls it agreeable flowers ; Codurquus makes it truffle, or\nmufflroom-, and Lalmet will have it to be the citron. Thofe that would fupport\nthe tranflation of mandrakes plead, that Rachel being barren, and having a great\ndefire to conceive, coveted Leah\u2019s mandrakes, it may be prefumed, with a view to\nits prolific virtues. The ancients have given to mandrakes the name of the apples\nof love, and to Venus the name of Mandragoritis ; and the emperor Julian, in his\nepiftle to Calixenes, fays, that he drinks the juice of mandrakes to excite amorous\ninclinations.\nMIMOSA, or SENSITIVE PLANT,\nIS a genus of the polygamia order, belonging to the monoecia clafs of plants ; and\nin the natural method ranking under the thirty-third order, Lomentacea. The her-\nmaphrodite calyx is quinquedentate ; the corallaquinquefid ;\nthere are five or more\nftamina, one piftil, and alegumen : The male calyx is quinquedentate-, the corolla\nquinquefid ; with five, ten, or more, ftamina. The name mimofa fignifies \u201c mimic j\u201d\nand\n\f28 APPEND\u2019 IX TO\nand is given to this genus on account of the fenfibility of the leaves, which, by their\nmotion, mimic or imitate, as it were, the motion of animals. To this genus Lin-\nnaeus joins many of the acacias ; and it comprifes near 60 different fpecies, all natives\nof warm climates. Of the forts cultivated here in our ftoves, &c. fome are of the\nfhrub and tree kind, and two or three are herbaceous perennials and annuals. The\nfenfitive kinds are exceedingly curious plants in the very fingular circumftance of\ntheir leaves receding rapidly from the touch, and running up clofe together ; and in\nfome forts the footftalks and all are affeded, fo as inftantly to fall downward as if\nfattened by hinges, which laft are called humble fenfitives. They have all winged\nleaves, each wing confifting of many fmall pinnae, In the Syftema Vegetabilium,\nthis\ngenus, including the mimojas properly fo called, and the acacias, is divided into fe-\nveral fedions, diftinguifhed by the figure, fituation, and arrangement, of the leaves;\nas, Ample, fimply-pinnated, bigeminous and tergeminous, conjugate and pinnated,\ndoubly pinnated. The following are the molt remarkable\n:\nSpecies,\nwith their properties, i. The Senfitiva, or common fenfitive humble plant,\nfifes with an under-fhrubby prickly ftem, branching fix or eight feet high, armed\nwith crooked fpines ; conjurated, pinnated leaves, with bijugated patial lobes or\nwings, having the inner ones the leaft, each leaf on a long footitalk ;\nand at the fides\nand ends of the branches many purple flowers in roundifh heads-, fucceeded by\nbroad, flat, jointed pods, in radiated clufters.\u2014This is fomewhat of the humble fen-\nfitive kind ; the leaves, footftalks and all, receding from the touch, though not with\nl'uch facility as in fome of the following forts.\n2. The Pudica, or bafhful humble plant, rifes with an under-fhrubby, declinated,\nprickly, ftem, branching two or three feet around, armed with hairy fpines ; pin-\nnated, digitated leaves, each leaf being of five or more long folioles, attached by\ntheir bafe to a long footftalk, and fpread out above like the fingers of a hand; and\nat the fides and ends of the branches roundifh heads of greenifh white flowers, fuc-\nceeded by fmall jointed prickly pods.---This is truly of the humble fenfitive kind\n;\nfor by the leaft touch the leaves inftantly recede, contract, clofe, and together with\nthe footftalk quickly decline downward, as if afhamed at the approach of the hand.\n3. The Pernambucana, or penambuca flothful mimofa, has unflirubby, procum-\nbent, unarmed, fterns, branching two or three feet around ; bipinnated leaves, of\nthree or four pair of fhort winged foliola ;\nand at the axillas drooping fpikes of\npentandrous flowers, the lower ones caftrated.\u2014This fpecies recedes very flowly\nfrom the touch, only contrafting its pinnae a little when fmartly touched ; hence\nthe name flothful mimofa.\n4. The AJperata, or panama fenfitive plant. Of this curious fpecies, which has\nbeen well delcribedby Dr. Browne (but not figured), there is a good figure in the\nReliquiae\n\f72\n\f\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 29\nReliquiae Houjloniana,\npublifhed by Sir Jofeph Banks. It grows in moift places, and\nby the Tides of rivulets, in the parifties of St. James and Hanover, Jamaica. It fel-\ndom riles above three feet in height ; but its {lender branches extend confiderably\non the neighbouring bufhes. It is armed with crooked, {harp, fpines ; fo thickly\nfeton the trunk, branches, and leaves, that there is no touching it with fafety. But\nthe plant has a beautiful appearance ; the flowers are yellow and globular, growing\nat the extremity of the branches. The pods are hairy, brown, and jointed; each\ncontaining a fmall, flat, and brown, feed. The leaves are numerous, fmall, and\nwinged: next to thofe of the mimofa pudica, they are the moft irritable; contradt-\ning with the leaft touch, and remaining fo for feveral minutes after. This fpecies\nwould form a good hedge or fence round a garden; and by being trimmed nowand\nthen by a cutlafs or gardener\u2019s fciflars, may be eaflly kept from fpreading.\n5. The Punftata, or pundtated fenfitive mimofa, rifes with a Ihrubby, upright,\ntaper, fpotted, unarmed, ftem, branching eredtly five or fix feet high ; bipinnated\nleaves, of four or five pair of long winged folioles, having each about twenty pair\nof pinnae ; and at theaxillas and termination of the branches, oblong fpikes of yel-\nlowifh decandrous flowers, the inferior ones caftrated ; fucceeded above by oblong\nfeed-pods. This fort, though naturally Ihrubby and perennial in its native foil, yet\nin this country it fometimes decays in winter. It is only fenfitive in the foliola, but\nquick in the motion.\n6. The Viva, lively mimofa, or fmallefc fenfitive weed, has many creeping roots,\nand fpreads itfelf fo as to cover large fpots of ground. It rifes at moft to two in-\nches, has winged leaves, with numerous fmall pinnae. The flower is globular, of a\nbluifli colour, and grows in clufters from the axillae : thefe are followed by little,\nftiort, hairy, pods, containing fmooth Alining feeds. This is the moft fenfible of all\nthe mimofas, the pudica not excepted. By running a ftick over the plant, a perfon\nmay write his name, and it will remain vifible for ten minutes.\n7. The Quadrivalvis, perennial or quadrivalve humble mimofa, has herbaceous,\n{lender, quadrangular, prickly, ftems, branching and fpreading all around, armed\nwith recurved fpines ; bipinnated leaves of two or three pair of winged lobes, hav-\ning eacn many pinna; ; and at the axillas globular heads of purple flowers, fucceed-\ned by quadrivalvular pods. This is of the humble fenfitive kind, both leaves and\nfootftalks receding from the touch.\n8 . T he Plena, annual or double-flowered fenfitive mimofa, rifes with an herbace-\nous, eredt, round, unarmed, ftem, clofely branching and fpreading every way, three\nor tour feet high ; bipinnated leaves of four or five pair of winged lobes, of many\npairs of pinna; ; and at the axillas and termination of the branches fpikes of yellow\nNo. 28. 77 ^ \u201e ,\npentandrous\n\f3\u00a9 APPENDIX TO\npentandrous flowers, the lower ones double ; fucceeded by fhort broad pods. This\nannual is only fenfitive in thefoliola, but extremely fenfible of the touch or air.\ng. The Cornigera, or horned Mexican mimofa, commonly called great horned\nacacia, has a Ihrubby, upright, deformed, ftem, branching irregularly, armed with\nvery large horn- like white fpines, by pairs, connated at the bafe ; bipinnated leaves\nthinly placed \u2022, and flowers growing in fpikes. This fpecies is efteemed a curiofity\nfor the oddity of its large fpines, refembling the horns of animals, and which are\noften varioufly wreathed, twilled, and contorted.\n10. The Farnefiana, or fragrant acacia, grows in woodlands and walle lands in\nmoil parts of Jamaica ; rifing to twenty-five or thirty feet, with fuitable thicknefs.\nThe bark of the trunk is brown and fcaly, the branches are alternate. It is adorned\nwith bipinnated leaves of a bright-green colour ; and yellow globular flowers from\nthe axillae, of a fragrant fmell. The pods are about three inches long, and half an\ninch broad : they are of alight-brown colour, fmooth, comprefied, and contain five\nor fix fmooth flat feeds. Formerly the flowers of this tree were ufed as an ingredi-\nent in thttheriaca andromachi of the old difpenfatories. The tree is fometimes planted\nfor a hedge or fence round inclofures ; and the timber, though fmall, is ufeful in\nfural economy.\n11. The Arborea,\nor wild tamarind-tree, is common in all the woodlands, and ef-\npecially near where fettlements have been made in Jamaica. It rifes to a confidera-\nble height, and is proportionably thick. The timber is excellent, and ferves many\npurpofes in rural economy : it is of the colour of cedar, pretty hard, and takes a\ngood polilh. The leaves are numerous; the flowers globular and white. The\npods are about a foot in length, of a fine fcarlet colour ; when they are ripe they\nopen and become twilled. The feeds then appear ; they are oblong, fmooth, of a\nfhining black, and quite foft. On the whole, from the leaves, flowers, and pods,\nthis tree exhibits a Angular and beautiful contrail. With us this plant is raifed in\nhot-houfes ; but it appears, that with a little pains it may be made to grow in the\nopen air. A good fizeable tree of this fort grew in the garden of the late Dr. Wil-\nliam Pitcairn, at Illington, near London.\n12. The Latifolia, lhag-bark, or white wild tamarind. This excellent timber-tree\nis very common in Jamaica, and rifes to a moderate height and good thicknefs.\nThe trunk is rough and fcaly : The leaves are numerous, of a rhomboidal figure,\nand yellowifh call. The flower- fpikes are from the axillae ; their colour is yellow.\nThe feed-veflels are flat, jointed, and twilled. The feeds are of the bignefs of a\nvetch, white, and finely llreaked with blue. Of this tree there is a variety which\nfome botanills call M. ferpentina. The chief difference is in the leaves, which are\nfmaller, and of a Ihining dark green.\n13. The\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 31\n13. The Lebeck, or ebony-tree. This is a native of the Eaft-Indies, but raifed\nfrom feeds in Jamaica and St. Vincent\u2019s. It is figured, though not accurately, by\nPluckenet, Tab. 331. fig: 1. To what height this tree grows, we cannot yet fay \u2022,\nbut it muft be of a confiderable thicknefs if it be the ebony we have in ufe here.\nTime will foon determine this, as the few plants in the iflands are reared with great\ncare by Dr. Dancer in Jamaica, and Mr. Alexander Anderfon in St. Vincent\u2019s.\n14, 15. The Cinerea\u2014Pinnata, Calhew bullies. Thefe fpecies are common about\nKingfton and SpanilhTown Jamaica, and rife by (lender trunks to about twenty feet.\nSee the Plate, fig. 2.\nDr. Roxburgh of Madras, amongfta number of ufeful difcoveries, has found the\nlac infedt on this fpecies of mimofa. We have feen the native gum-lac on one of the\nfmall twigs, and a fpecimen of the plant in the collection of a gentleman. The plant\nis a variety of the cinerea, and appears rather to be the M pinnata,\nLin. It is to be\nhoped, that in a Ihort time the ufeful infeft juft mentioned may be tranfported from\nAlia to the Weft-Indies, where this gum, or rather wax, may be alfo produced.\n16. The Scandens, cacoons, or mafootoo wyth (\nGigalobium fcandens, Browne\u2019s Jam.\np. 362. Phajeolus maximus perennis,\nSloane\u2019s Cat. 68. Perein Kaku-valli,\nH. M. viiL\nT. 32, 3, 4.) This fpecies of mimofa is frequent in all the upland valleys and\nwoodlands on the north fide of Jamaica. It climbs up the tailed: trees, and fpreads\nitfellf in every direction by means of its cirrhi or clafpers, fo as to form a complete\narbour, and to cover the fpace of an Englilh acre from one root. This circum-\nfiance has a bad effect on the trees or bulhes fo lhaded. Light, air, and rain (fo\nnecefiary for all plants), being Ihut out, the leaves drop off, the tree gradually rots,\nand the limbs fall down by the weight of this parafite.\nThe roots of this plant run fuperficially under the ground or herbage. The\ntrunk is feldom thicker than a man\u2019s thigh, and fends off many branches, with nu-\nmerous fhining green leaves, each of which terminates in a tendril or clafper, that\nferves to fallen it to trees or bulhes. The flower-fpikes are from the axillae : they\nare llender, and the florets on them fmall and numerous. The pod is perhaps the\nlargeft: and longeftof any other in the world ; being fometimes eight or nine feet in\nlength, five inches broad, jointed, and containing ten or fifteen feeds. Thefe feeds\nare brown, Ihining, flattened, and very hard, and called cacoons. They are the fame\nmentioned in the Philofophical Tranfa&ions, No. 222, page 298, by Sir Hans\nSloane, as being thrown alhore on the Hebrides and Orkneys. This happens in the\nfollowing manner : The feeds or beans fall into the rivers, and are conveyed to the\nfea. The trade-winds carry them weftward till they fall into the gulf Itream,\nwhich forces them northward along the coall of America and Bahama iflands. As\nthe winds blow frequent and ftrongfrom America, thefe feeds are driven to theeaft-\n2 ward.\n\fAPPENDIX TO\n32\nward, till at length they are thrown aftiore and left with the tide as aforefaid. This\nbean, after being long foaked in water, is boiled and eaten by fome negroes ; but, in\ngeneral, there feems to be no other ufe made of it than as a fort of fnuff- box.\n17. The Catechu,\naccording to Mr. Ker, grows only to twelve feet in height, and\nto one foot in diameter ; it is covered with a thick rough brown bark, and towards\nthe top divides into many clofe branches : the leaves are bipinnated, or doubly\nwinged, and are placed alternately upon the younger branches : the partial pinnte\nare nearly two inches long, and are commonly from fifteen to thirty pair, having\nfmali glands inferted between the pinnae : each wing is ufually furnifhed with about\nforty pair of pinnulae or linear lobes, befet with fhort hairs : the fpines are fhort,\nrecurved, and placed in pairs at the bafes of each leaf : the flowers are hermaphro'-\ndite and male, and ftand in clofe fpikes, which arife from the axillae of the leaves,\nand are four or five inches long : the calyx is tubular, hairy, and divides at the limb\ninto five oval pointed fegments : the corolla is monopetalous, whitifh, and of the\nfame form as the calyx, but twice its length : the filaments are numerous, capilla-\nry, double the length of the corolla, adhering at the bafe of thegermen, and crown-\ned with roundifh antherse : the germen is oval, and fupports a flender ftyle, which\nis of the length of the filaments, and terminated by a Ample ftigma : the fruit, or\npod, islance-fhaped, brown, fmooth, compreffed, with an undulated thin margin i\nit contains fix or eight roundifh flattened feeds which produce a naufeous odour\nwhen chewed. From this tree, which grows plentifully on the mountainous parts\nof Indoftan, where it flowers in June, is produced the officinal drug long known in\nEurope by the name of terra japonica.\n18. The JSilotica,\nor true Egyptian acacia, rifes to a greater height than the pre-\nceding : the bark of the trunk is fmooth, and of a grey colour; that of the branches\nhas commonly a purplifh tinge : the leaves are bipinnated, and placed alternately;\nthe partial pinnae are oppofite, furnifhed with a fmali gland between the outermoft\npair, and befet with numerous pairs of narrow elliptical pinnulae, orleafits; the\nfpines are long, white, fpreading, and proceed from each fide of the bafe of the\nleaves : the flowers are hermaphrodite and male ; they aflame a globular fhape, and\nHand four or five together upon flender peduncles, which arife from the axillae of\nthe leaves : the calyx is fmali, bell-fhaped, and divided at the mouth into five mi-\nnute teeth : the corolla confifts of five narrow yellowifh fegments : the filaments are\nnumerous, capillary, and furnifhed with roundifn yellow antherae : thegermen is\nconical, and fupports a flender flyle, crowned with a Ample ftigma: the fruit is a\nlong pod, refembling that of the lupin, and contains may flattifh brown feeds. It\nis a native of Arabia and Egypt, and flowers in July.\nAlthough\n\f33\nCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL.\nAlthough the mimofa nilotica grows in great abundance over the vafl extent of\nAfrica, yet gum arabic is produced chiefly by thofe trees, which are fituated near\nthe equatorial regions \u2022, and we are told that in Lower Egypt the folar heat is ne-\nver fufficientlv intenfe for this purpofe. The gum exfudes in a liquid Hate from the\nbark of the trunk and branches of the tree, in a fimilar manner to the gum which\nis often produced upon the cherry-trees, &c. in this country; and by expofure to\nthe air it foon acquires foiidity and hardnefs. in Senegal the gum begins to flow\nwhen the tree firft opens its flowers and continues during the ra :\nny feafon till the\nmonth of December, when it is colleded for the firft time. Another coliedion of\nthe gum is made in the month of March, from incifions in the bark, which the ex-\ntremedrinefs of the air at that time is faid to render necefiary. Gum arabic is now\nufually imported into England trom Barbary; not packed up in fkins, which was\nthe practice in Egypt and Arabia, but in large cafks or hogfheads. The common\nappearance of this gum is well known; and the various figures which it aflumes\nfeem to depend upon a variety of accidental circumftances attending its tranfuda-\ntion and concretion. Gum arabic of a pale ydlowifh colour is moft efteemed ; on\nthe contrary, thofe pieces which are large, rough, of a roundifh figure, and of a\nbrownilh or reddilh hue, are found to be lels pure, and are faid to be produced from\na different fpecies of mimofa (M. Senegal); but the Arabian and Egyptian gum is\ncommonly intermixed with pieces of this kind, fimilar to that which comes from the\ncoaft of Africa near the river Senegal. Gum arabic does not admit of folution by\nfpiritoroil, but in twice its quantity of water it diffolves into a mucilaginous fluid,\nof the confiftence of a thick fyrup; and in this ftate anfwers many ufeful purpofes, by\nrendering oily, refinous, and pinguious, fubftances, mifcible with water. The glu-\ntinous quality of gum arabic is preferred to moft other gums and mucilaginous fub-\nftances, as a demulcent in coughs, hoarfenefles, and other catarrhal affedions, in\norder to obtund irritating acrimonious humours, and to fupply the loft of abraded\nmucus. It has been very generally employed in cafes of ardor urinae and ftrangua-\nry but it is the opinion of Dr. Cullen, \u201c that even this mucilage, as an internal de-\nmulcent, can be of no fervice beyond the alimentary canal.\u201d\nThe Senegal is a native of Guinea, and was fome time ago introduced into Jamai-\nca. Dr. Wright tells us, he faw both this and the mimofa nilotica, of thefizeof a\ncherry-tree, growing at Dr. Paterfon\u2019s, in the parifh of Hanover, Jamaica. The\nflowers are globular, and fragrant. The pods are brown, and of the fize of a goofe-\nquill. The tree, on being wounded, exfudes gum arabic, though in left quantity,\nand lefs tranfparent, than that of the ihops, which is obtained from t hz nilotica above\ndeferibed. There are above forty other fpecies charaderifed in the Syjlema Vegeta\n-\nbilium.\nNo. 28, I I n\n\f34 APPENDIX TO\nIn the annexed Plate is figured a non-defcript fpecies, of an uncommon fize, men-\ntioned by Mr. Paterfon in his Travels among the Hottentots, but not particularly\ndefcribed. Like feveral other mimofas, it produces gum, which is confidered by the\nnatives as a peculiarly delicate fpecies of food : the leaves and lower points of the\nbranches feem to conftitute the principal aliment of the Camelopardalis ; and, from\nthe extent of its boughs, and the fmoothnefs of the trunk, it affords a fufficient de-\nfence to a fpecies of gregarious bird againft the tribe of ferpents and other reptiles\nwhich would otherwife deftroy its eggs. Mr. Bruce defcribes two plants which\nfeem referable to this genus \u2022, the one named ergett el dimmo,\nthe other ergett el krone.\nThe former, in our author\u2019s opinion, fhould be named mimojafanguinea j its name in\nthe Abyffinian language hgmtyxng the bloody ergett.>\nand denvtd, as hefuppofes, from\nits being partly compofed of beautiful pink filaments. When the bloffoms are ful-\nly fpread, the upper part of them confifts of yellow curled filaments, and the under\npart of pink filaments of a fimilar fbape. In its unripe ft ate, that part which after-\nwards becomes pink is of a green colour, and compofed of tubercles of a larger fize,\nand more detached, than thofe which afterwards produce the yellow filaments ; the\nlatter being fmaller, and clofer fet together : the leaves are of the double-pinnated\nkind.\nThe name of the other fpecies, in the Abyffinian language, fignines the horned er-\ngett \\\nwhich our author fuppofes to be given it on account of the figure of the pods.\nThe flower very much refembles that of the acacia vera in fize and fbape, excepting\nthat it is attached to the branch by a ftrong woody {talk of confiderable length,\nwhich grows out at the bottom of the branch bearing the leaves, and is (heltered as\nin a cafe by the lower part of it. The branches are all covered with fhort, ftrong,\nand iharp- pointed, thorns, having their points inclined backwards towards the root.\nThe pods are covered with a prickly kind of hair, which eafily rubs off with the\nfingers, (ticks to them, and gives a very uneafy fenfation. They have thirteen divi-\nfions i\nin each of which are three hard, round, and fhining feeds, of a dufky brown\ncolour. Both of thefe fhrubs fhut their leaves on the coming on of the violent rains\nin the wet feafon, and never fully expand them till the dry feafon returns.\nMYRISTICA, or NUTMEG-TREE.\nTHE myriftica, or nutmeg-tree, is a genus of plant belonging to the clafs dice-\nda, and order fyngenefia, in the New Genera Plantarum of Linnaeus by Shreber ; and\nof the natural order Lauri, in his fourth clafs Monocotylidones. The male calyx is\nmonophyllous, ftrong, and parted into three lacinii of an oval fhape. In the middle\nof the receptacle rifes acolumnof the height ofthe calyx-, tothe upper part ofwhich the\nantherse\n\f\u2022\n\u00a5 .\n\f\fCULPEPER5\ns BRITISH HERBAL, 35\nantherae are attached. They vary in number from three to twelve or thirteen. The\nfemale calyx and corolla as in the male, on a diftinCt tree. The germen of an oval\nfhape ;\nthe ftyle fhort, with a bifid ftigma ; the lacinii of which are oval and fpread-\ning. The fruit is of that fort called drupa. It is fiefhy, roundifh, fometimes unil-\nocular, lometimes bivalved, and burfts when ripe at the fide. The feed is envelop-\ned with a fiefhy and fatty membraneous fubftance, which divides into filaments (this\nin one of the fpecies is the mace of the fhops). The feed or nutmeg is round or\noval fhaped, unilocular, and contains a (mail kernel, variegated on the furface by\nthe fibres running in the form of a fcrew.\nSpecies. There are five fpecies of this genus according to fome authors-, but fe-\nveralof thefe being only varieties, may be reduced to three, viz.\n1. Myriftica fatua, or wild nutmeg : this grows in Tobago, and rifes to the height\nof an apple-tree-, has oblong, lanceoiated, downy, leaves, and hairy fruit: the nut-\nmeg of which is aromatic, but when given inwardly is narcotic, and occafionsdrunk-\nennefs, delirium, and madnefr, for a time.\n2. The myriftica febifera, ( Virola Sibifera Aublet, page <304. Tab. 345.) A tree\nfrequent in Guiana, riling to forty or even to fixty feet high -, on wounding the\ntrunk of which, a thick, acrid, red, juice runs out.

The myriftica mofchata, or nutmeg, attains the height of thirty feet, producing\nnumerous branches which rife together in ftories, and covered with bark, which of\nthe trunk is a reddifh brown, but that of the young branches is of a bright green\ncolour : the leaves are nearly elliptical, pointed, undulated, obliquely nerved, on the\nupper fide of a bright green, on the under whitilh, and ftand alternately upon foot-\nftalks : the flowers are fmall, and hang upon (lender peduncles, proceeding from the\naxillae of the leaves: they are both male and female upon feparate trees. M.\nSchwartz, who has carefully examined this as well as the two firft fpecies, preferved\nin fpirits, places them amongft the monodelphia.\nThe nutmeg has been fuppofed to be the Comacum of Theophraftus, but there\nfeems little foundation for this opinion; nor can it with more probability be thought\nto be the Chryfobalanus of Galen. Our firft knowledge of it was evidently derived\nfrom the Araoians ;\nby Avicenna it was called jiaujibun, or j(lujibcind, which figni-\nfies nut of bands. Rumphius both figured and delcribed this tree; but the figure\ngiven by him is fo impeded, and the defcription fo confufed, that Linnaeus, who\ngave it the generic name myriftica^ was unable to affign its proper characters. Son-\nnei at s account of the mufcadier is ftill more erroneous ; and the younger Linnaeus\n3\nwas\n\f36 APPENDIXTO\nwas unfortunately mided by this author, placing the myriftica in the clafs Pollan-\ndria,\nand defcribing the corolla as confiding of live petals. Thunberg, who exa-\nmined the flower of the nutmeg, places it in the clafs Monoecia ; and, according to his\ndefcription, the male flower has but one filament, furrounded at the upper part by\nthe antheras ; and as the filaments are fhort and (lender, and the anthers united, this\nmiftake might eafily arife. M. De La Ma ck informs us, that he received feveral\nbranches of the myriftica, both in flower and fruit, from the Ifle of France, where a\nnutmeg-tree, which was introduced by Monfieur R ivre in 1770, is now very large,\nand continually producing flowers and fruit. From thefe branches, which were\nfent from Monf. Cere, director of the king\u2019s garden in that ifland, Monf. De La\nMarck has been enabled to defcribe and figure this and or her fpecies of the myrifti-\nca with tolerable accuracy ; as will appear from the annexed plate, of which the fol-\nlowing is an explanation :\nFig. a.

A tranfverfe fedion of the\nnutmeg.\nThe feed or kernels called nutmegs are well known, as they have been long ufed\nboth for culinary and medical purpofes. Diftilled with water, they yield a large\nquantity of eflential oil, reiembling in flavour the fpice itfelf; after the diftillation,\nan infipid febacious matter is found fwimming on the water; the decodion infpif-\nfated, gives an extrad of an unduous, very lightly bitterifb, tafte, and with little or\nno aftringency. Redified fpirit extrads the whole virtue of nutmegs by infufion,\nand elevates very little of it in diftillation ; hence the fpirituous extrad poffefies the\nflavour of the fpice in an eminent degree.\nNutmegs, when heated, yield to the prefs a confiderable quantity of limpid yel-\nlow oil, which on cooling concretes into a febaceous confiftence. In the {hops we\nmeet with three forts of unduous fubftances, called oil of mace,\nthough really expref-\nfed from the nutmeg. The beft is brought from the Eaft Indies in ftone jars *, this\nis of a thick confiftence, of the colour of mace, and has an agreeable fragrant fmell;\nthe fecondfort, which is paler coloured, and much inferior in quality, comes from\nHolland in folid mafles, generally flat, and of a fquare figure: the third, which is\nthe worfl of all, and ufually called common oil of macefs an artifical compofition of fe-\nvum, palm-oil, and the like, flavoured with a little genuine oil of nutmeg.\nMethod\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 37\nMethod ofgathering andpreparing Nutmeg. When the fruit is ripe, the natives af-\neend the trees, and gather it by pulling the branches to them with long hooks.\nSome are employed in opening them immediately, and in caking off the green fhell or\nfirft rind, which is laid together in a heap in the woods, where in time it putrefies.\nAs foon as the putrefaction has taken place, there fpring up a kind of mufhrooms,\ncalled boleti mojchatyni,\nof a blackifh colour, and much valued by the natives, who\nconfider them as delicate eating. When the nuts are ftripped of their firft rind,\nthey are carried home, and the mace is carefully taken off with a fmall knife. The\nmace, which is of a beautiful red, but afterwards affumes a darkifh or reddifh co-\nlour, is laid to dry in the fun for the fpace of a day, and then removed to a place lefs\nexpofed to his rays, where it remains for eight days, that it may foften a little. They\nafterwards moiflen it with fea-water, to prevent it from drying too much, or from\nlofing its oil. They are careful, however, not to employ too much water, left it\nfhould become putrid, and be devoured by the worms. It is laft of all put into\nfmall bags, and fqueezed very clofe. Mace mull not be co. founded with macer.\nThe nuts, which are ftill covered with their ligneous fhtl), are for three days ex-\npofed to the fun, and afterwards dried before a fire till they emit a found when they\nare fhaken ; they then beat them with fmall flicks in order to remove their fhell,\nwhich flies off in pieces. Thcfe nuts are diftributed into three parcels : the firfi of\nwhich contains the largeft and moft beautiful, which are deflined to be brought to\nEurope-, the fecond contains inch as are referved for the ufe of the inhabitants;\nand the third contains the fmaileft, which are irregular or unripe. Thefe are burnt,\nand part of the reft is employed for procuring oil by preffure. A pound of them\ncommonly gives three ounces of oil, which has the confiftence of tallow, and has\nentirely the tafte of nutmeg. Both the nut and mace, when diftilled, afford an ef-\nfential, tranfparent, and volatile, oil, of an excellent flavour. The nutmegs which\nhave been thus feledted would foon corrupt if they were not watered, or rather pick-\nled with lime-water made from calcined fhell-fifh which they dilute with falt-water\ntill it attain the confiftence of fluid pap. Into this mixture they plunge the nut-\nmegs, contained in fmall bafkets, two or three times, till they are completely cover-\ned over with the liquor. They are afterwards laid in a heap, where they heat, and\nlofe their fuperfluous moifture by evaporation. When they have fweated fu Ancient-\nly, they are then properly prepared, and fit for a fea-voyage.\nIn the ifland of Banda, the fruit of the nutmeg-tree is preferved entire in the fol-\nlowing manner : When it is almoft; ripe, but previous to its opening, it is boiled\nin water and pierced with a needle. They next lay it in water to foak for ten days,\ntill it has loft; its four and fharp tafte. They then boil it gently in a fyrup of fugar,\nto which, if they wilh it to be hard, a little lime is added. This operation is repeat-\nNo. 28. K ed\n\f5 8 APPENDIX TO\ned for eight days,, and each time the fyrup is renewed. The fruit when thus pre-\nferved is put for the lafh time into a pretty thick fyrup, and is kept in earthern pots\nclofely ffiut. Thefe nuts arelikewife pickled with b ine or with vinegar-, and, when\nthey intend to eat them, they firft fteep them in freffi water, and afterwards boil\nthem in fyrup of fugar, &c.\nIJfes. Nutmegs preferved entire are prefented as deferts, and the inhabitants of\nIndia fometimes eat them when they drink tea. Some of them ufe nothing but the\npulp ; others likewife chew the mace * but they generally throw away the kernel,\nwhich is really the nutmeg. Many, who perform fea-voyages to the north, chew\nthis fruit every morning. The medicinal qualities of nutmeg are fuppofed to be\naromatic, anodyne, ftomachic, and reftringent ;\nand, with a view to the laft-mention-\ned effedts, it has been much uled in diarrhoeas and dyfenteries. To many people\nthe aromatic flavour of nutmeg is very agreeable; they however fhould be cautious\nnot to ufe it in large quantities, as it is apt to affedt the head, and even to manifeft\nan hypnotic power in fuch a degree as to prove extremely dangerous. Bontius\nfpeaks of this as a frequent occurrence in India ;\nand Dr. Cullen relates a remarka-\nble inftance of this foporific effedt of the nutmeg, which fell under his own obferva-\ntion, and hence concludes, that in apopledlic and paralytic cafes this fpice may be\nvery improper. He obferves, that a perfon by miftake took two drachms ora little\nmore of powdered nutmeg : he felt it warm in his ftomach, without any uneafinefs;\nbut in about an hour after he had taken it he was feized with a drowfinefs, which\ngradually increafed to a complete ftupor and infenfibility ; and not long after he\nwas found fallen from his chair, lying on the floor of his chamber in the ftate\nmentioned. Being laid a- bed he fell afleep ; but, awaking a little from time to time,\nhe was quite delirious -, and he thus continued alternately fleeping and delirious for\nfeveral hours. By degrees, however, both thefe fymptoms diminilhed -, fo that in\nabout fix hours from the time of taking the nutmeg he was pretty well recovered\nfrom both. Although he ftill complained of head-ach, and fome drowfinefs, he\nflept naturally and quietly the following night, and next day was quite in his ordi-\nnary health. The officinal preparations of nutmeg are a fpirit and efiential oil, and\nthe nutmeg in fubftance roafted, to render it more aftringent. Both the fpice itfelf\nand its efiential oil enter feveral compofitions, as the confedtio aromatica, fpiritus\namoniae com. &c. Mace poffefies qualities fimilar to thofe of the nutmeg, but is\nlefs aftringent, and its oil is fuppofed to be more volatile and acrid.\nRemarks on the Trade of Nutmegs. Nutmeg-trees grow in feveral iflands in the\neaftern ocean. The wood-pigeon of the Moluccas is unintentionally a great\nplanter of thefe trees, and difieminates them in places where a nation, powerful by\nits commerce, thinks it for its intereft that they ffiould be rooted out and deftroyed.\ni The\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 39\nThe Dutch, whofe unwearied patience can furmount the greateft obftacles, have ap-\npropriated to themfelves the crop of nutmeg, as well as that of cloves and cinna-\nmon, growing in the iflands of Ternate, Ceylon, &c. either by right of conqueft or\nby paying fubfidies to the iflanders, who find thefe much more profitable than the\nformer produce of their trees. It is neverthelefs true, that they have prevailed upon\nor compelled the inhabitants of the Moluccas to cut down and root out all the\nclove-trees, which they have preferved only in the iflands of Amboyna and Ternate,\nwhich are in a great meafure fubjeft to them. We know for certain, that the Dutch\npay 18,000 rixdollars yearly to the king of Ternate, by way of tribute or gift, in or-\nder to recompenfe him for the lofs of his clove-trees in the other Molucca iflands *,\nand that they are moreover bound by treaty to take, at. three-pence three-farthings a\npound, all the cloves brought by the natives of Amboyna to their magazines. They\nhave likewife fucceeded to deftroy the cinnamon every where except in the ifland of\nCeylon, which is in their pofleflion. The fame is the cafe with white pepper, &c.\nfo that the trade of the whole of Europe, and of great part of Afia, in this fpecies of\ncommodity, pafles through their hands.\nThe Dutch have immenfe and very rich magazines of thefe precious aromatics,\nboth in India and Europe. They have adtually by them the produce of fixteen\nyears, and never fupply their neighbours with the laft, but always with the oldeft,\ncrop : in 1760 they fold what was laid up in 1744. It is commonly faid, that when\nthe Dutch have too great a quantity of cloves, nutmeg, &c. in their magazines, they\nthrow them into the fea *, but the fadt is, that they get rid of their fuperfluous aro-\nmatics by burning them. On the 10th of June 1760, M. Beaumare law at Amfter-\ndam, near the admiralty, a fire, the fuel of which was valued at 8,000,coo of livres j\nand as much was to be burned the day following. The feet of the fpedlators were\nbathed in the eflential oil of thefe fubftances ; but no perfon was allowed to gather\nany of it, muchlefs to take any of the fpices which were in the fire. Some years be-\nfore, upon a fimilar occafion, and at the fame place, a poor man who had taken up\nfome nutmegs which had rolled out of the fire, was, as M. Beaumare was inform-\ned, feized and condemned to immediate execution. We will only add, that not-\nwithftanding the jealoufy of the Dutch, and the pains they take to prefefve the fale\nof cloves wholly to themfelves, they have never been able to prevent their own offi-\ncers in feveral parts of India from embezzling and felling confiderable quantities of\nthem. M. de Jaucourt informs us, that, in order to defraud the company, they fell\nthem to the veffels of other nations which they meet at fea, and moiiten the remain-\nder with water, that they may Hill have the number of quintals of which their cargo\ncon ft fled. I he quantity iold may amount to ten quintals in one hundred before it\ntan be perceived by the clerks of the magazines at Batavia, where they are received.\nWe\n\f40 APPENDIX TO\nWe are informed by M.

The French, to prevent the exportation of fpecie\nfor theie aromatic and exotic produdions, have attempted to introduce the cu ture\nof them into fomeof their colonies. A great many plants of the clove and nutmeg\ntree have been procured, and planted in the Ifle of France, the ifland of Bourbon,\nand alfo at Cayenne, where they have a very promifing appearance.\nThe FLOWERING P A V O N I S.\nTHIS plant grows nine feet in height, and bears rnoft beautiful yellow flowers.\nThe feed fteeped in water, and a ftrong decodiun of it given to a woman in labour,\ngreatly facilitates the delivery. For this reafon, thofe Indian flaves who have con-\niidered themfelves cruelly ufed by their tafk-matlers in the plantations, take great\npains to get at this tree, for the purpofe of procuring abortion, which they know it\nnever fails to effect. Thofe negroes who are brought from Guinea, and Angola,\n\u2022were the firft who were dilcovered making ufe of this plant \u2022, and while they ate of\nit, or drank a decodion of its leaves or feeds, they neither conceived, nor brought\nforth children. On being remonftratrd with, they faid they would fooner die than\nbring forth children in flavery, who, as they grow up, muft undergo the fame yoke,\nand iuffer all the cruelties inflided on their unfortunate parents. Tournefort calls\nthis tree poinciana fiore pulcherrimo. It grows in all the warm climates, and is found\nin many parts of America.\nPIMENTO, or JAMAICA PEPPER TREE.\nTHE Jamaica pepper tree is a fpecies of the myrtle, a genus of the monogynia\norder, belonging to the icofandria clafs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking\nunder the 19th order, Hefperide<e.

As thefe leaves come up rolled in the manner\nbefore-mentioned, their advance upward is fo quick, that their growth may almoft\nbe\n\fCULPEPER*s BRITISH HERBAL. 45\nbe aifcerned by the naked eye*, and, if a fine line is drawn acrofs level with the top\nof the leaf, in an hour\u2019s time the leaf will be near an inch above it. When the\nplant is grown to its full height, the fpikes of flowers will appear in the centre,\nwhich is often near four feet in length, and nods on one fide. The flowers come\nout in bunches; thofe in the lower part of the fpike being the larged ; the others\ndiminifh in their fize upward. Each of the bunches is covered with a fpath or\nfheath of a fine purple colour, which drops off when the flowers open. The upper\npart of the fpike is made up of male or barren flowers, which are not fucceeded by\nfruit, but fall off with their covers. The fruit or plantains are about a foot long,\nand an inch and a half or two inches diameter: it is at firft green, but when ripe of\na pale-yellow colour. The fkin is tough ; and within is a foft pulp of a lufcious\nfweet flavour. The pikes of the fruit are often fo large as to weigh upwards of\nforty pounds. The fruit of this fort is generally cut before it is ripe. The green\nfkin is pulled off, and the heart is roafted in a clear fire for a few minutes, and fre-\nquently turned: it is then fcraped, and ferved up as bread. Boiled plantains are\nnot fo palatable. This tree is cultivated on a very extenfive fcale in Jamaica;\nwithout the fruit of which, Dr. Wright fays, the ifland would fcarcely be habita-\nble, as no fpecies of provifion could fupply their place. Even flour or bread itfclf\nwould be lefs agreeable, and lefs able to fupport the laborious negro, fo as to ena-\nble him to do his bufinefs or to keep in health. Plantains alfo fatten horfes, cattle,\nfwine, dogs, fowls, and other domeftic animals. The leaves being fmooth and foft\nare employed as dreflings after blifters. The water from the foft trunk is aftrin-\nsent, and employed by fome to check diarrhoeas. Every other part of the tree is\nufeful in different parts of rural oeconomy. The leaves are ufed for napkins and\ntable-cloths, and are food for hogs.\nThe fecond fort differs from the firft, in having its ftalks marked with dark pur-\nple ftripes and fpots. The fruit is fhorter, ftraighter, and rounder: the pulp is fofter\nand of a more lufcious tafte. It is never eaten green ; but, when ripe, it is very\nagreeable, either eaten raw or fried in dices as fritters ; and is relifhed by all ranks\nof people in the Weft-Indies. Both the above plants were carried to the Weft-In-\ndies from the Canary iflands ; whither, it is believed, they had been brought\nfrom Guinea, where they grow naturally. They are alfo cultivated in Egypt, and\nin moil other hot countries, where they grow to perfection in about ten months,\nfrom their firft planting to the ripening of their fruit. When their ftalks are cut\ndown, there will feveral fuckers come up from the root, which in fix or eight months\nwill produce fruit; fo that, by cutting down the ftalks at different times, there is a\nconftant fucceffion of fruit all the year.\nNo. 29. M In\n\f46 A P P E N D I X T O\nIn Europe there 2re fome of thefe plants preferved in the gardens of curious per-\nfons, who have hot-houfes capacious enough for their reception, in many of whom\nthey have ripened their fruit very well ; but as they grow very tall, and their leaves\nare large, they require more room in the ftove than raoft people care to allow them.\nThey are propagated by fuckers, which come from the roots of thofe plants which\nhave fruited \u2022, and many times the younger plants, when they are Hinted in growth,\nwill alfo put out fuckers.\nThe fruit of the banana-tree is four or five inches long, of the fize and fhape of a\nmiddling cucumber, and of a high grateful flavour : the leaves are two yards k ng,\nand 2 foot broad in the middle ; they join to the top of the body of the tree, and\nfrequently contain in their cavities a great quantity of water, whkh runs out, upon\na fmail incifion being made into the tree, at the jun&ion of the leaves. Bananas\ngrow in great bunches, that weigh a dozen pounds and upwards. The body of the\ntree is fo porous as not to merit the name of wood ;\nthe tree is only perennial by its\nroots, and dies down to the ground every autumn.\nWhen the natives of the Weft-Indies (fays Labat) undertake a voyage, they make\nprovifion of a pafte of banana-, which, in cafe of need, ftrves them tor nourilh-\nment and drink : for this purpole they take ripe bananas and, having fqueezed\nthem through a fine fieve, form the lolid fruit into fmail loaves, which are dried in\nthe fun or in hot allies, after being previoufly wrapped up in the leaves of Indian\nflowering reed. When they would make ufe of this pafte, they dftfolve it in water,\nwhich is very eaftly done ; and the liquor, thereby rendered thick, has an agreeable\nacid tafte imparted to it, which makes it both refrelhing and nourifhing. The ba-\nnana is greatly efteemed, and even venerated, by the natives of Madeira, who term\nit the forbidden fruit, and reckon it a crime almoft inexpiable to cut it with a knife*,\nbecaufe, after difleclion, it exhibits, as they pretend, a fimilitude of our Saviour\u2019s\ncrucifixion ; and to cut the fruit open with a knife, is, in their apprehenfion, to\nwound his facred image.\nSome authors have imagined, that the banana-tree was that of the leaves of which\nour firft parents made themfelves aprons in Paradife. The facred text, indeed, calls\nthe leaves employed for that purpofe fig-leaves; and Milton, in a mod beautiful\nbut erroneous defeription, affirms the bearded or Bengal fig to have been the tree\nalluded to. But, befides that the fruit of the banana is often by the moft ancient au-\nthors called a fig, its leaves, by reafon of their great fize and folidity, were much\nmore proper for a veil or covering than thofe of the Bengal fig, which are feldom\nabove fix or eight inches long and three broad. On the other hand, the banana-\nleaves, being three, four, and five, feet long, and proportionably broad, could not\nfail to be pitched upon in preference to all others ; efpecially as they might be ea-\nfily\n\f\\\nCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 47\nlily joined, or fewed together, with the numerous thread-like filaments that may,\nwith the utmoft facility, be peeled from the body of this tree.\nSome have fuppofed the Abyfiinian plant enfete to be a fpecies of mufa. It is faid\nto be a native of the province of Narea, where it grows in the great marfhes and\nfwamps for which that province is remarkable, owing to the many rivers which\noriginate in that country, and have but a fmall declivity to the ocean. This plant\nas well as the coffee- tree, is faid to have been unknown in Abyffinia before the arri-\nval of the Galla, who imported them both along with them. It comes to great\nperfection about Gondar; but the principal plantations of it are in that part of\nMaitfha and Gouth, to the weft of the Nile, where it is almoft the foie food of the\nGalla who inhabit that country. Maitfha is almoft entirely on a dead level ; fo that\nthe rains ftagnate and prevent the fowing of grain. Were it not for the er^ete,\ntherefore, the Galla would have fcarcely any vegetable food. Mr. Bruce thinks that\nthe enfete may have been cultivated in fomeof the gardens of Egypt about Rofetto,\nbut that it was not a native of the country. He ftrongly controverts the opinion\nthat this plant is a fpecies of mufa. \u201c It is true (fays he), the leaf of the banana re-\nfembles that of the enfete: it bears figs, and has an excrefcence from its trunk,\nwhich is terminated by a conical figure, chiefly differing from the enfete in fizeand\nquantity of parts-, but the figs of the banana are of thefizeand figure of a cucumber,\nand this is the part which is eaten. This fig is fweet, though mealy, and of a tafte\nhighly agreeable. It is fuppofed to have no feeds, though in fa<5t there are four\nfmall black feeds belonging to every fig. But the figs of the enfete are not eatable :\nthey are of a fofc tender fubftance ; watery, taftelefs, and in colour and confiftence\nrefembiing a rotten apricot : they are of a conical form, crooked a little at the low-\ner end about an inch and an half in length, and an inch in breadth where thickeft.\nIn the infide of thefc is a large ftone half an inch long, of the fhape of a bean or ca-\nfhevv-nut, of a dark-brown colour; and this contains a fmall feed, which is feldom\nhardened into fruit, but confifts only of Hein. The long ftalk that bears the figs of\nthe enfete fprings from the centre of the plant, or rather is the body or folid part of\nthe plant itfelf. Upon this, where it begins to bend, are a parcel of loofe leaves ;\nthen grows the fig upon the body of the plant without any ftalk ; after which the\ntop of the ftalk is thick fet with fmall leaves, in the midft of which it terminates the\nflower in the form of an artichoke; whereas in the banana, the flower in form of the\nartichoke grows at the end of that (hoot or ftalk which proceeds from the middle\nof the plant, the upper part of which bears the row of figs. The leaves of the en-\nfete are a web of longitudinal fibres clofely fet together ; the leaves grow from the\nbottom without ftalks : whereas the banana is in form like a tree, and has been mif-\ntaken for fuch. One half of it is divided into a ftem, the other is a head formed with\nleaves a\n\fAPPENDIX TO\n48\nleaves \u2022, and, in place of the ftem that grows out of the enfete, a number of leaves,\nrolled round together like a truncheon, fhoots out of the heart of the banana, and\nrenews the upper as the under leaves fall off: but all the leaves of the banana\nhave a long ftalk \u2022, this fixes them to the trunk, which they do not embrace by a\nbroad bafe or involucrum as the enfete does.\n\u201c But the greateft differences are ftill remaining. The banana has by fome been\nmiffaken for a tree of the palmaceous kind, for no other reafon but a kind of fimila-\nrity in producing the fruit on an excrefcence or ftalk growing from the heart of the\nftem i but ftill the mufa is neither woody nor perennial ^ it bears the fruit but once \u2022,\nand in all thefe refpedts it differs from trees of the palmaceous kind, and indeed\nfrom all fort of trees whatever. The enfete, on the contrary, has no naked ftem ;\nno part of it is woody : the body of it, for feveral feet high, is efculent \u2022, but no part\nof the banana plant can be eaten. As foon as the ftalk appears perfedt and full of\nleaves, the body of the plant turns hard and fibrous, and is no longer fit to be eaten :\nbefore, it is the beft of all vegetables. When boiled, it has the tafte of the beft new\nwheat-bread not perfectly baked. When you make ufe of the enfete for eating,\nyou cut it immediately above the fmall detached roots, and perhaps a foot or two\nhigher, as the plant is of age. The green muft be ftripped from the upper part till\nit becomes white ; when foft, like a turnip well boiled, if eaten with milk or butter,\nit is the beft of all food, wholefome, nourilhing, andeafily digefted.\u201d\nOur author now proceeds to confider an hieroglyphic fometimes met with in\nEgypt, viz. the figure of Ifis fitting between fome branches of the banana-tree, as\nis fuppofed, and fome handfuls of ears of wheat. You lee likewife the hippopota-\nmus ravaging a quantity of the banana-tree. Yet the banana is merely adventitious\nin Egypt : it is a native of Syria : it does not even exift in the low hot country of\nArabia Felix ;\nbut choofes fome elevation in the mountains where the air is tempe-\nrate i and is not found in Syria farther to the l'outhward than lat. 34\n0\n.\nFor thefe reafons Mr. Bruce thinks, that the banana, not being a plant of the coun-\ntry, \u201c could never have entered into the lift of their hieroglyphics ; for this reafon,\nit could not figure any thing regular or permanent in the hiftory of Egypt or its cli-\nmate. I therefore imagine (adds he), that this hieroglyphic was wholly Ethiopian-,\nand that the fuppofed banana, which, as an adventitious plant, fignified no-\nthing in Egypt, was only a reprefentation of the enfete ; and that the record in the\nhieroglyphic of Ifis and the enfete- tree was fomething that happened between harveft,\nwhich was about Auguft, and the time that the enfete-treecame in ufe, which was in\nOctober.\u2014The hippopotamus is generally thought to reprefent a Nile that has been\nfo abundant as to be deftru&ive.

Its characters are thefe:\nthe flower has no empalement ; it hath one petal, which is narrow at the bafe,\nand impervious ; the brim is cut into fix parts, which are obtufe and alternately\nfmaller ; it hath nine hair-like ftamina inferted in the petal, and of the fame length,\nterminated by oblong fummits, which are obtufe, and a fhort three-cornered germen,\nwith fcarcely any ftyle, crowned by three-feathered ltigmas, which are reflexed ; the\ngermen afterwards becomes a large three-cornered feed, with acute membranaceous\nborders. Miller reckons four and Linnaeus five fpecies. The true rhubarb is now\nfown in many gardens, and may probably fucceed fo well here in time, as that a\nfufficient quantity of that valuable drug may be raifed to fupply our confumptiom\nThe rhubarb with hairy leaves and equal foot-ftalks has been generally reckoned\nthe true rhubarb plant, having been produced from the feeds fent from Ruflia, as\nthofeof the true rhubarb, to Juflieu of Paris, Rand at Chelfea, and Linnaeus at\nUpfal. It is a native of China and Siberia, and has been raifed in fome of our\nown gardens, where it is found to grow with vigour in the open ground. Some\nhave derived its name from Rha,\nthe river called by us Wolga, and harbarum, q. d.\nthe root found by the barbarians on the river Rha. However it is necefiary to ob~\nferve, that Dr. Hope, received, in 1763, rhubarb-feeds from Ruflia, which Dr.\nMounfey allured him were the feeds of the true rhubarb ; and, having fown them\nin the open ground at Edinburgh, they produced a different fpecies, viz. the rheum\npalmatum Linnai, with the leaves deeply cut into pointed fegments. He obferves\nthat the root'of this plant, though taken up too young, and at an improper feafon,\nviz. in July, agreed perfectly with the beft foreign rhubarb in colour, fmell, tafte,\nand purgative quality. See his botanical defcription and drawing of the plant in\nPhil. Tranf. vol. Iv. art. 32. Perhaps, fays Dr. Lewis, the roots of both fpecies\nmay be of the fame quality, and taken promifcuoufly. The rhaponticum is a dif-\nferent fpecies from either of thefe. Mr. Bell informs us, in his Travels, that the beft\nrhubarb grows in that part of the Eaftern Tartary called Mongallia, which ferves\nas a boundary between Ruflia and China. This plant, he fays, does not run and\nfpread itfelf like docks, but grows in tufts at uncertain diftances, as if the feeds had\nbeen dropped with defign. As the Mongalls do not think it worth cultivating, the\nmarmots, which burrow under the fhade of its fpreading leaves, and probably feed\non its leaves and roots, contribute to its increafe, partly by the manure which their\ndung affords it, and principally by calling up and loofening the earth, into which\nNo. 29. N the\n\f5\u00a9 APPENDIX TO\nthe ripe feeds blown by the wind fall, and where they immediately take root. Af-\nter digging and gathering the rhubarb, the Mongalls cut the large roots into fmall\npieces, in order to make them dry more readily. In the middle of every piece they\nfcoop a hole, through which a cord is drawn, in order to fufpend them in a conve-\nnient place ; and by this practice they deflroy fome of the beft part of the root.\nAll rhubarb-plants, fays Miller, are propagated by feeds, which fhould be fown\nin autumn foon after they are ripe, and then the plants will come up rhe following\nfpring j whereas, if they are fown in the fpring, they will not come up till the next\nfpring. The plants fhould remain where the feeds are fown j and, when they appear\nin the fpring, the ground fhould be hoed to cut up the weeds, and they fhould be\nthinned, like carrots and parfnips, leaving them at the firfl hoeing fix or eight inches\nafunder ; and, at the fecond hoeing, at the diftance of at leaft a foot and a half.\nAfter this the plants will require no other culture but to keep them clean from weeds\n;\nin autumn the leaves decay, when the ground fhould be made clean ; and it fhould\nalfo be hoed and cleaned in the fpring, when the plants put out their new leaves.\nIn the fecond year after they come up the ftrongefl will produce flowers and feeds\n;\nand, in the third year, molt of them will flower. The roots will remain many years\nwithout decaying, and, it is faid, that the old roots of the true rhubarb are much\npreferable to the young ones. They delight in a rich foil, not too dry nor too moift,\nand where there is a good depth for their roots to run down \u2022, in fuch land their\nleaves will be very large, and their roots will grow to a great fize.\nTwo forts of rhubarb-roots are met with in the fhops. The firfl is imported\nfrom Turkey and Ruffia, in roundifh pieces, freed from the bark, with a hole\nthrough the middle of each, externally of a yellow colour, internally variegated\nwith lively reddifh {freaks. The other, which is lefs efleemed, comes immediately\nfrom theEafl Indies, in longifh pieces, harder, heavier, and morecompaft, than the\nforegoing. The firfl fort, unlefs kept very dry, is apt to grow mouldy and worm-\neaten \u2022, the fecond is lefs fubjeft to thefe inconveniences. Some of the more induf-\ntrious artifls are faid to fill up the worm-holes with certain mixtures, and to colour\nthe outfide of the damaged pieces with powder of the finer forts of rhubarb, and\niometimes with cheaper materials. The marks of the goodnefs of rhubarb are,\nthe livelinefs of its colour when cut, its being firm and folid, but not flinty or hard^\nits being eafily pulverable, and appearing, when powdered, of a fine bright yellow\ncolour-, its imparting to the fpittle, on being chewed, a deep faffron tinge, and not\nproving flimy or mucilaginous in the mouth. Its tafle is fubacrid, bitterifh, and\nfomewhat flyptic -, the fmell is lightly aromatic.\nRhubarb is a mild cathartic, and commonly confidered as one of the fafeft and\nmoft innocent of the fubftances of this clafs. Befides its purgative virtue it has a\n\u201e mild\n\fCULPEFER\u2019s BRITISH HERBAL. 5 i\nmild aftringentone, difcoverable by the tafte, and by its ftriking an inky blacknefs\nwith chalybeate folutions-, hence it is found to ftrengthen the tone of the ftomach\nand inteftines, to leave the belly coftive, and to be one of the moftufeful purgatives\nin diarrhoeas, dyfenteries, and all diforders proceeding from a debility and laxity of\nthe fibres: it is frequently given with a view to this ftomachic and corroborating\nvirtue rather than to its producing any confiderable evacuations. It tinges the urine\nof a high yellow colour. Rhubarb in fubftance purges more effectually than any\npreparation of it: the dofe is from a fcruple to a drachm. By roafting it with a\na gentle heat, till it becomes eafily friable, its cathartic power is diminilhed, and its\naftringency fuppofed to be increafed. The purgative virtue of rhubarb is extracted\nmore perfectly by water than by rectified fpirit ; the root remaining after the aCtioni\nof water is almoftif not wholly inactive \u2022, whereas, after repeated digeftion in fpirit,\nit proves ftill very confiderably purgative : when the rhubarb has given out to fpirit\nall that this menftruum can extract, it ftill imparts a deep colour, as well as a purga-\ntive impregnation, to water. A drachm of the extraCt, formed by infpiffating the\nwatery infufion, is not more efficacious than a fcruple of the root in fubftance \u2022, but\nhalf a drachm of the extract formed from the fpirituous tinCture proves moderately\npurgative, though fcarcely more fo than an equal quantity of the powder. The fpi-\nrituous extraCl diffolves almoft wholly in water, and hence the tinClure, like the\nfpirituous infufions of moft other vegetables, does not turn milky on being mixed\nwith aqueous liquors \u2022, of the watery extraCl fcarcely above one fourth is diffolved by\nrectified fpirit, and the part that does not diffolve proves more purgative than that\nwhich does. Hence it appears, that rhubarb contains much more gummy or mu-\ncilaginous than refinous matter-, and its purgative quality feems to refide chiefly in\na combination of gummy and faline matter.\nTinClures of this root are drawn in the (hops with proof fpirit and with moun-\ntain wine, in the proportion of an ounce of rhubarb to a pint of tfie menftruum,\nThefe preparations, ufed chiefly as mildly laxative corroborants, in weaknefs of the\nftomach, indigeftion, diarrhoeas, colicky and other fuch complaints, are commonly\naromatifed with a little cardamom feeds, and faffron, as two drachms of the former\nand one of the latter to the above quantity of the root, and thus are formed the\ntinchire of rhubarb, vinofa &fpirituofa. For fome purpofes a tinClure, called tinSlura\nrhei dulcis, is drawn from the rhubarb and cardamom feeds with proof fpirit, and\ntwo ounces of white fugar-candy diffolved in the ftrained liquor. For others, in-\nfteadof fweetsand aromatics, gentian and fnake-root are joined, in the proportion\nof a drachm and a half of the former and a drachm of the latter, with the addition\nof a fcruple of cochineal as a colouring ingredient ; this laft tinClure, called tinflum\nrhii\n\fAPPENDIX TO\nSt\nrhsiamara^ is, in many cafes, an ufeful affiftantto the Peruvian bark in the cure of\nintermittents.\nThe Turkey rhubarb is generally preferred to the Eaft-India fort, though the\nlatter is more aftringent, but has fomething lefs of an aromatic flavour. Tin&ures\nmade from both, with equal quantities of rectified fpirit, have nearly the fame tafte:\non drawing off the menftrua, the extract left by the tincture of the Eaft-India rhu-\nbarb proves in tafte confiderably ftronger than the other. They feem both, fays\nDr. Lewis, to be the produce of the fame climate, and roots of the fame fpecies of\nplant, taken up probably at different feafons, or cured in a different manner.\nThe yellow colour of rhubarb, it is faid, is much lefs deftru&ible than many\nother vegetable yellows. Aqua fortis, and other acids which deftroy the colour of\nfaffron, turmeric, &c. make no change in that of rhubarb, or at moft render it only\nturbid. Volatile fpirits heighten the colour, and incline to red. Fixed alkaline falts\nhave this effect in a greater degree. Mr. Model affirms that a confiderable quan-\ntity of felenites is contained in rhubarb. In one experiment he obtained fix ounces\nof felenites from four pounds of rhubarb ; and, in the other, no lefs than an ounce\nof felenites from two ounces and five drachms of old rhubarb.\nThe Indian rhubarb fown in our gardens has this peculiar property, that it yields\na fine and clear gum. This is perfectly white and pellucid ; and in the months of\nof June and July is fo plentiful, that an ounce may fometimes be gathered at a time\nfrom one plant of it. It exfudates of itfelf from all parts of the ftalks and ribs of\nshe leaves, and fometimes from the under part of the leaves themfelves. It ftands\nin fome places in large drops, and in others the ftalks, &c. feem only to be covered\nwith a thin layer of it; and the under part of the leaves in fome have it in form of\nSwifted wires or long icicles. The plant may always be feen wounded by a fort of\ncauftic in the places where the germen makes its way out, and thefe may be followed\ni\nwith any pointed inftrument through the fkin ; in fome parts of the plant this juice\nis found to be turned gummy within it, and looks like clear ice. As this is the on-\nly known herbaceous plant that yields a true gum like that of trees, it would be\nworthy obfervation, whether fome of ourown plants may not have fome tendency of\nnature to form a juice of the fame kind. It would be moft proper to look for this\nin the plants of the fame genus, and as nearly related to the rhubarb as we can.\nThe docks, fo common about our fields, are of the fame genus; and the forrel ffiews\nby its tafte, that it is particularly allied to the plant ; for both are alike of the dock-\nkind, and both alike four. It would be proper to look carefully about the leaves\nof forrel a little before it flowers, to fee whether any thing like the fame gum ap-\npears on ito\nThere\n\f(\nl\n\f\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL, 53\nThere is yet this farther analogy between this rhubarb and our common forrel\n:\nthat the hufks of our forrel, boiled in water, with a little alum, turn it to a fine red\ncolour ; and the hufks of rhubarb do the fame, and both the one and the other of.\nten turn red in decaying.\nThe juice of the roots of this rhubarb, extracted by bruifing and fteeping it in\ncommon water, when the liquor is drained and evaporated, becomes only a clear\nuninflammable gum, and melts in the flame of a candle. This gum, as well as that\nof the (talks and leaves, is of an inlipid tafte ; and it is obfervable, that, though the\nplant naturally yields it in fo large a quantity, yet it will not flow from wounds\nmade by art in any part of the plant. Upon the confideration of the infipid tafte\nof this gum, and its folubility in water, we may found fome probable conjecture\nin regard to the different virtues of this plant in purging and binding.\nThe woody fibres have a ftrong tafte-, and, in all probability, are alone endued\nwith the aftringent quality. An infufion of rhubarb is known to purge, and a pow-\nder of it to bind : the reafon is eafily feen on this confideration. The water in in-\nfufion takes up all this gummy juice, and its other juices, but leaves the fibrofe\npart behind, in confequence of which it ought to purge without binding ;\nbut, in\ncafe of giving the powder, the juices are in great part evaporated in the drying, and\nthe woody part left almoft alone ; it therefore purges but little, and proves power-\nfully aftringent.\nThe INDIAN ROCU.\nTHE rocu is a tree of confiderable ftature, bearing flowers of a pale red, like the\nEuropean apple-blofloms. When the flowers fall off, a head of feed follows, of an\noblong roundifh form, and prickly, like a chefnut. This contains that beautiful\nred feed, which the Indians break or macerate, and, putting it in water, it finks to\nthe bottom, converting the fluid into a moft elegant tranfparent red tin&ure. This\ntinfture they pour off at their leifure, and the fediment which the feeds form at the\nbottom they fuffer to dry in little cakes, with which they paint their naked bodies\nin various figures, which they efteem a very great ornament.\nThis tree is the urucu of Pifo j and Tournefort, having joined it with the two\nfpecies of Cortufa Americana,\ncalls it mitella for the fruit of this, as well as the Cor-\ntufa Americana, burfts open and reprefents the fhape of an epifcopal mitre ; and\ntherefore he entitles it, in his Inftitut.

Mr. Bartram\u2019s defcrip-\ntion of it is as follows :\n\u201c Near here my (on found a lovely fweet tree, with leaves\nlike the fweet bay, which lmelled like faffafras, and produces a very ftrange kind of\nfeed-pop \u2022, but ail the feed was (hed, the fevere froft had not hurt it, fome of them\ngrew near twenty feet high, a charming bright ever-green aromatic.\u201d\nThisobfervationof Mr. Bartram, relating to its bearing a fevere froft, may afford\na ufeful hint in the cultivation of this tree, efpecially as I am convinced, from re-\npeated accounts of the weather in Weft Florida; that the froft is much more in-\ntenfe there, from whence thcfe plants were brought, than in Eaft Florida \u2022, fo that\nthe experiment is well worth making with one of them, to fee how far it will ftand\nthe feverity of our winters. Should it fucceed, it would be a very great acquifition\nto our gardeners, and be highly ornamental to our plantations of ever-greens.\nThe medicinal properties of this tree are certainly worth enquiring into. The\nleaves afford a moft agreeable bitter. A fprig of it fet to putrify in a phial of wa-\nter, the bark foon became full of a clear mucilage.

This points\nout itsaftringent quality.\nBefore 1 come to the botanical charabters of our Florida illicium, I inuft obferve,\nthat it appears to me to be a different fpecies from the oriental one. The feed-ve(fels\nfrom China, which aie to be feen in collections of the Materia Medica, efpecially\namong foreigners, fmell very difagreeably of anifeed : our Florida feed- veffcl is\nagreeably aromatic, as are the leaves and young branches. The flower, according\nto Kasmpfer, is o( a yellowi(h white, and looks at a diftance like a narciffus : ours\n\f56 APPENDIX TO\nis of a dark-red colour. Kaempfer reckons the number of petals fixteen, and the\nrays or feed-vefiels eight : the number of petals in ours is from twenty-one to twen-\nty-feven, and the feed-vefiels twelve or thirteen that ripen. In refpedl to the form\nand growth of the tree, they are much the fame \u2022, for inftance, they both grow to the\nfizeof a cherry-tree; their leaves are of an oblong oval fhape, pointed at both ends,\nflefhy, with few veins, growing alternately, and in tufts, at the ends of the fmail\nbranches.\nDr. Linnaeus, who takes his characters of the illicium anifatum (Gen.

If the monopoly of\nthe Weft-India Hands, where alone the wafteful culture by Haves, in the abfence of\nthe owner, can be fupported, fhould be gradually diminifhed, and at laft abolifhed,\nby a plentiful produce of fugar from the maple, humanity would no longer luffer,\nthe article would find its true level, and every nation would be more or lefs benefited.\nThe oxer faccharinum of Linnaeus, or fugar maple tree, grows in great quantities\nin the weftern countries of all the middle Hates of the American union. It is as\ntall as the oak, and from two to three feet in diameter -, puts forth a white blofiom\nin the fpring, before any appearance of leaves : its fmall branches, afford fuftenance\nfor cattle, and its afhes afford a large quantity of excellent pot-afli. Twenty years\nare required for it to attain its full growth.

The fugar is feparated\nfrom the fap either by freezing, by fpontaneous evaporation, or by boiling. The\nlatter method is the molt ufed. Dr. Rufh defcribes the procefs, which is fimple,\nand pradikd without any difficulty by the farmers.\nFrom frequent trials of this fugar, it does not appear to be in any refped inferior\nto that of the Weft Indies. It is prepared at a time of the year when neither infed,\nnor the pollen of plants, exifts to vitiate it, as is the cafe with common fugar. From\ncalculations grounded on exifting fads, it is afcertained, that America is now capa-\nble of producing one eighth more than its own confumption; that is, on the whole,\nabout 135,000,000 pounds, which in the country may be valued at fifteen pounds\nweight for one dollar. Dr. Rufh mentions many other benefits his country may\nderive from this invaluable tree, and concludes his paper with an account of feme\nof the advantages of fugar to mankind, not merely as commonly confidered to be a\nluxury, but as an excellent, wholefome, and noui idling, article of food.\nNo. 29. P TEA-\n\f3' APPENDIX TO\nTEA-TREE.\nTHE tea-tree, tbea, in botany, is the name of a genus of plants, of the polyan-\ndria monogynia clafs, the characters of which are thefe : the cup is a very fmall,\nplane, permanent, perianthium, divided into five or fix roundifh, obtufe, leaves;\nthe flower confifts of fix or nine large, roundifh, concave, and equaLpetals ; the (la-\nmina are numerous filaments, about two hundred, and are very (lender, capillary*\nand (horter than the flower; the antherasare Ample; thegermen of the piftil isglo-\nbofe and trigonal ; the ftyle is Tubulated, and of the length of the (lamina; the (lig-\nma is Ample ; the fruit is a capfule, formed of three globular bodies growing toge-\nther ; it contains three cells, and opens into three parts at the top. The feeds are\nAngle, globofe, and internally angulated.\nFrom an original drawing taken of the tree when in its flowering (late, it appears,\nthat the tea-tree, as Mr. Miller fir ft obferved, belongs to the order of trigynia ; and\nLinnaeus was led to the miftake of placing it in that of monogynia, by not having\nhad any opportunity of examining any other than dried fpecimens of this (hrub.\nOf this genus Linnaeus enumerates two fpecies : viz. the bohea tea, having flow-\ners with fix petals ; and the green tea, having flowers with nine petals.\nDr. Lettfom, in his botanical description of the tea-plant, thinks it mod proba-\nble, that there is only one fpecies, and that the difference between the green and bo-\nhea teas depends on the nature of the foil, culture, age, and the manner of drying\nthe leaves. He adds, that it has even been obferved, that a green tea tree, planted\nin the bohea country, will produce bohea, and on the contrary ; and that on his ex-\namining feveral hundred flowers, brought both from the bohea and green tea coun-\ntries, their botanical characters have always appeared uniform.\nWe are principally indebted to Kasmpfer, Le Compte, and Du Halde, for an\nauthentic hiftory of the culture of this exotic (hrub, and the manner of preparing\nor curing its leaves. The particulars of greateft importance that have been recit-\ned have lately been judicioufly collected, and the fubjeCt farther llluftrated by ad-\nditional obfervations, by Dr. Lettlom.\nThe tea-tree loves to grow in vallies, at the foot of mountains, and upon the\nbanks of rivers, where it enjoys a fouthern expofure to the fun ; though it endures\nconfiderable variations of heat and cold, as it flourilhes in the northern clime of Pe-\nkin, as well as about Canton ; and it is obferved that the degree of cold at r*ekin is\nasfevere in winter as in fome of the northern parts of Europe. However, the bed\ntea grows in a mild temperate climate, the country about Nankin producing better\ntea than either Pekin or Canton, betwixt which places it is (ituated.\nThe\n\f\f\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. \u00ae\nThe root refembles that of the peach-tree j the leaves are green, longifh at the\npoint, and pretty narrow, an inch and half long, and jagged all round. The flower\nis much like that of the wild rofe, but fmaller. The fruit is of different forms,\nfometimes round, fometimes long, fometimes triangular, and of the ordinary fize of\na bean, containing two or three feeds, of a moufe-colour, including each a kernel.\nThefe are the feeds by which the plant is propagated : a number from fix to twelve\nor fifteen being promifcuoufly put into one hole, four or five inches deep, at certain\ndiftances from each other. The feeds vegetate without any other care, though the\nmore induftrious annually remove the weeds and manure the land. The leaves\nwhich fucceed are not fit to be plucked before the third year\u2019s growth, at which\nperiod they are plentiful, and in their prime.\nIn about feven years the fhrub rifes to a man\u2019s height ; and as it then bears few\nleaves, and grows (lowly, it is cut down to the Item, which occafions an exuberance\nof frefh fhoots and leaves the fucceeding fummerj fome, indeed, defer cutting them\ntill they are of ten years growth. In Japan the tea-tree is cultivated round the bor-\nders of the fields, without regard to the foil \u2022, but, as the Chinefe export confidera~\nble quantities of tea, they plant whole fields with it.\nThe bed time to gather the leaves of tea is while they are yet fmall, young, and\njuicy \u2022, and the different periods in which they are gathered are particularly deferib-\ned by Kaempfer. They are plucked carefully one by one, and, notwithftanding the\nfeeming tedioufnefs of this operation, the labourers are able to gather from four to\nten or fifteen pounds each in one day. The tea-trees that yield often the fined\nleaves grow on the deep declivities of hills, where it is dangerous, and in fome\ncafes impra&icable, to colledt them. The Chinefe are faid to vanquifh this difficulty\nby a Angular contrivance. The large monkeys which inhabit thefe cliffs are irri-\ntated, and in revenge they break off the branches, and throw them down, fo that\nthe leaves are thus obtained.\nThe buildings, or drying-houfes, that are eredled for curing tea, contain from five\nto ten or twenty fmall furnaces, about three feet high, each having at the top a\nlarge flat iron pan. There is alfo a long low table covered with mats, on which the\nleaves are laid, and rolled by workmen, who fit round it : the iron pan being heat-\ned to a certain degree by a little fire made in the furnace underneath, a few pounds\nof the frefh gathered leaves are put upon the pan *, the freih and juicy leaves ciack\nwhen they touch the pan, and it is the bufinefs of the operator to fhift them as quick\nas poffible with his bare hands, till they become too hot to be eafily endured. At\nthis inflant he takes off the leaves with a kind of (hovel refvmbling a fan, and pours\nthem on the mars before the rollers, who, taking fmall quantities at a time, roll\nthem in the palms of their hands in one direction, while others are fanning them\njj that\n\fAPPENDIX TO\n'60*\nthat they may cool the more fpeedily, and retain their curl the longer. This pro-\ncefs is repeated two or three times, or oftener, before the tea is put into the (lores,\nin order that all the moifture of the leaves may be thoroughly diflipated, and their\ncurl more completely preferved. On every repetition the pan is lefs heated, and the\noperation performed more (lowly and cautioufly. The tea is then feparated into the\ndifferent kinds, and depofited in the (lore for domeftic ufe or exportation.\nThe Chinefe know nothing of imperial tea, flower of tea, and many other names,\nwhich in Europe ferve to didinguifh the goodnefs and the price of this fafhionable\ncommodity ; but, befides the common tea, they diftinguifh two other kinds, viz. the\n*OQui andfoumlo, which are referved for people of the firft quality, and thofe who are\nTick. We have two principal kinds of tea in Europe : viz.\nGreen tea, which is the common tea of the Chinefe, &c. F. le Compte calls it\nling-tea,\nand fays it is gathered from the plant in April. It is held very digeftive,\nand a little aftringent \u2022, it gives a palifh-green t influ re to water, and its leaves are\nmuch twilled. The fecond is,\nBohea tea, which is the voui-tea, or bou-tcha, of the Chinefe. F. ]e Compte makes\nthis only differ from the green tea by its being gathered a month before it, viz;\nrn March, while in the bud ; and hence the fmallnefs of the leaves, as well as the\ndepth of the tinflure it gives to water. Oihers take it for the tea of fome particular\nprovince j the foil being found to make an alteration in the properties of the tea,-\nas much as the feafon of gathering it. It is all bought at Nankin, and thence\nbrought into Europe, where it is now much in vogue.\nAs to the differences in colour and flavour peculiar to thefe two kinds, and to\ntheir varieties, Dr. Lettfom thinks that there is reafon to fufpeft that they are, in\nfome meafure, adventitious, or produced by art. He has been informed by intelli-\ngent perfons, who have refided fome time at Canton, that the tea about that city\naffords very little fmell while growing. The fame is obferved of the tea-plants now\nin England, and alfo of the dried fpecimens from China. We are not, however, as\nhe obferves, to conclude from hence, that art alone conveys to teas, when cured, the\nfmell peculiar to each kind; for our vegetable graffes, for inflance, have little or no\nfmell till they are dried and made into hay.\nAs to the opinion that the green tea owes its verdure to an efflorefcence acquired\nfrom the plates of copper on which it is fuppofed to be cured or dried, he (hews\nthat there is no foundation for this fufpicion. The infufions of the fined imperial\nand bloom teas undergo no change on the affufion of a volatile alkali, which would\ndetedl the minuted portion of copper contained in them, by turning the liquors blue.\nThe fine green colour of thefe teas, with as little reafon, hath been attributed to\ngreen copperas ; as this metallic fait would, on its being diffolved in water, immedi-\nately\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S B R I TM S H HERBAL. 61\nately aft on the aftringent matter of the leaves, and convert the infufion into ink,\nas happens when a chalybeate water has been employed in the making of tea.\nOn the whole Dr. Lettfom thinks it not improbable, that fome green dye, pre-\npared from vegetable iubftances, is employed in the colouring of the leaves of the\ngreen teas. And Neumann fufpefts, that the brown colour and the flavour of the\nbohea forts are introduced by art. Both the green and bohea teas have an agreea-\nble fmell, and a lightly bitterifh fubaftringent tafte-, with folution of chalybeate vi-\ntriol, they ftrike an inky blacknefs. They give out their fmell and tafte both to\nwatery and fpirituous menftrua ; to water, the green forts communicate their own\ngreen tinflure, and the bohea their brown \u2022, but to a rectified fpirit they both impart\na flne deep green. The extrafts, obtained by gently drawing off the menftrua from\nthe filtered tinftures, are very confiderably aftringent, and not a little ungrateful j\nbut the fpirituous moft fo.\nSavary alfo fpeaks of a fort of red tea, or Tartar tea, called honan tcha,\nwhich tin-\nges the water of a pale red, and which is faid to be extremely digefiive-, by means\nhereof it is that the Tartars are faid to be able to feed on raw flefli. Its tafte is\nearthy, and much the leaft agreeable of them all ; but this is fcarcely known in\nEngland.\n'Pea is to be chofen of the brifkeft fmell, and as whole as pofiible ; and the great-\neft care is to be taken that it have not been expofcd to the air to pall and evaporate.\nThe drink, tea, is made in China, and throughout the greateft part of the eaft,\nafter the fame manner as in Europe \u2022, viz. by infufing the leaves in boiling water,\n.and drinking the infufion hot. Indeed, among us, it is ufual to temper its bitter-\nnefs with fugar, but the Orientals ufe it without the addition of fugar or milk.\nHowever, the Japanefe are faid to prepare their liquor a fomewhat different way,\nviz. by pulverizing the leaves, ftirring the powder in hot water, and drinking it as\nwe do coffee. From the account given by Du Halde, this method is not peculiar to\nthe Japanefe, but is alfo ufedin fome provinces of China.\nThe common people, who have a coarfer tea, boil it for fome time in water, and\nmake ufe of the liquor for common drink. Early in the morning, the kettle, filled\nwith water, is regularly hung over the fire for this purpofe, and the tea is either put\ninto the kettle enclofl d in a bag, or by means of a bafket of proper fize preffed to\nthe bottom of the veflel, that there may be no hindrance in drawing off the water.\nThe Bantsjaa tea only is ufed in this manner, whofe virtues, being more fixed, would\nnot befo fully extracted by infufion.\nThe Chinefe are always taking tea, efpecially at meals : it is the chief treat where-\nwith they regale their friends. The moft moderate take it at leaft thrice a day j\nNo. 29. c)\nothers\n\f62\n\\\n'\nAPPENDIX TO\nothers ten times, or more -, and yet it is computed the confumption of tea among\nthe Englifh and Dutch is as great in proportion as among the Orientals.\nWith regard to the commercial hiftory of tea, we may obferve that it was firft in-\ntroduced into Europe by the Dutch Eaft-India company, very early in the laft cen-\ntury, and that a quantity of it was brought over from Holland by Lord Arlington\nand Lord Offory about the year 1666, at which time it was fold forfixty fhillings\na pound. But it appears, that before this time, drinking of tea, even in public cof-\nfee-houfes in this country, was not uncommon \u2022, for, in 1660, a duty of eight-pence\nper gallon was laid on the liquor made and fold in all cofFce-houfes.\nThe prefent confumption of it is immenfe. Dr. Lettfom tells us, that he has been\ninformed, that at leaft three millions of pounds are allowed for the annual home\nconfumption, not including the incredible quantity fmuggled into the kingdom ;\nand that the Eaft-India company have generally in their warehoufes a fupply for\nthree years. By 13 Geo. III. cap. 44. no licence fhall be granted to the Eaft-India\ncompany to export tea, unlefs there remain in the warehoufes a quantity not lefs\nthan ten millions of pounds weight.\nAs to the properties of tea, they are ftrangely controverted ; the eaftern nations\nare at leaft as much pofTefTed with an idea of their extraordinary virtues as the Eu-\nropeans but it is, perhaps, becaufe imagination bears as great a fway there as here.\nThe reafon why the gout and ftone are unknown in China, is afcribed to the ufe of\nthis plant.\nTea is extolled as the greatefl of all medicines : moderately and properly taken,\nit abts as a gentle aftringent and corroborative ;\nit ftrengthens the ftomach and\nbowels, and is good againft naufeas, indigeftions, and diarrhoeas. It a\u00a3ts alfo as a\ndiuretic and diaphoretic. The immoderate ufe of it, however, has been very preju-\ndicial to many, who have been thereby thrown into the diabetes. And alfo in Eu-\nrope, infufionsof tea- leaves have been extravagantly condemned by fome and com-\nmended by others. From the contradictory opinions even of medical writers on this\nfubjeCt, the natural inference feems to be, that they poffefs neither noxious nor bene-\nficial powers in any very confiderable degree. They feem, when moderately ufed,\nto be for the moft part innocent j\nin fome cafes they feem to be falutary ; in fome\nthey are apparently prejudicial. They dilute thick juices, and quench thirft more\neffectually, and pafs off by the natural emunCtories more freely, than more watery\nfluids \u2022, they refrefh the fpirits in heavinefs and fleepinefs, and feem to counteract\nthe operation of inebriating liquors.\nFrom their manifeftaftringency they have been fuppofed to ftrengthen and brace\nup the folids ; but this effeCt experience does not countenance, as it is in diforders\nand in conftitutions wherein corroborants are moft ferviceable that the immoderate\nufe\n1\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL- 6j\nufe of tea is peculiarly hurtful ; in cold indolent habits, cachexies, chlorofis, drop-\nfies, and debilities of the nervous fyftem.\nDr. Lettfom has particularly enquired into the medical qualities and effedts of\ntea ; and, having oblerved that infufions of bohea and green tea contribute to pre-\nferve fweet fome fmall pieces of beef immerfed in them, he infers that they poffefs\nan antifeptic power, when applied to the dead animal fibre, and from their Itriking\na purple colour with fait of iron he deduces their aftringent quality. From other\nexperiments he concludes, that the adtivity of tea chiefly refides in its fragrant and\nvolatile parts; and that, if the ufe of it be benefical or injurious to any particular\nconftitution, it becomes fo principally by means of this odorous fragrant principle.\nHe apprehends that it is the fafeft courfe to ufe the infufion of the more ordinary\nkinds of this plant, which abound lefs with this fragrant principle. Or the tea may\nbe boiled a few minutes in order todifiipate this volatile part, which Hands charged\nas thecaufe of thofe nervous affedtions that are faid to be produced, or aggravated,\nby the ufe of this liquor. By this procefs may likewife be extradled more copioufly\nthe more fixed, bitter, and ftomachic, parts of this vegetable. Dr. Lettfom, who\nfeems to be thoroughly perfuaded of the occafionally noxious effedts of this vola-\ntile principle, in the finer teas efpecially, recommends this laft-mentioned mode of\nmaking tea, or the fubftitution of the extradt inftead of the leaves ; by the ufe of\nwhich the nervous relaxing effedts, which follow the drinking of tea in the ufual\nmanner, would be in great meafure avoided. This extradl has been imported hither\nfrom China, in the form of fmall cakes, not exceeding a quarter of an ounce each in\nweight, ten grains of which might fuffi.ce one perfon for breakfaft : but it might\neafily be made here by Ample decodtion and evaporation, by thofe who experience\nthe noxious qualities of the volatile principles of this plant.\nIt may be farther obferved, that the effedt of drinking large q uantities of any warm\naqueous liquor would be to enter fpeedily into the courfe of circulation, and pafs\noff as fpeedily by urine or perfpiration, or the increafeof fome of the fecretions. Its\neffedts on the folid parts of the conftitution would be relaxing, and thereby en-\nfeebling. If this warm aqueous fluid were taken in confiderable quantities, its ef-\nfedts would be proportionable, and Hill greater, if it were fubflituted inftead of\nnutriment. The infufion of tea, however, has thefe two peculiarities. It is not\nonly poffeffed of a ledative quality, but alfo of a confiderable aftringency; by which\nthe relaxing power, alcribed to a mere aqeous fluid, is in fome meafure corredted\non this account. It is, perhaps, lefs injurious than many other infufions of herbs,\nwhich, befiaes a very flight aromatic flavour, have very little, if any, ftypticity, to\nprevent their relaxing debilitating effedts.\nSo\n\fAPPENDIX TO\n-64\nSo far, therefore, tea, if not too fine, if not drunk too hot, nor in too great quanti-\nties, is perhaps preferable to any other known vegetable infufion. And if we take\ninto consideration, likewife, its known enlivening energy, our attachment to it will\n.appear to be owing to its. Superiority in tafte and effefts to moft other vegetables.\nTea may be confidered as a very powerful aphrodifiac ; and accordingly a phyfi-\ncian of considerable eminence in his profeffion, imputes the amazing population of\nChina, amongft other caufes, to the general ufeof it.\nVarious AVis of Parliament on the Subject of 'Tea .-\u2014 No tea is allowed to be import-\ned, except from the place of its growth, on pain of forfeitu re, 1 1 Geo. cap. 30 and\nby 24 Geo.

All the fibres are to be cut\noff fmooth, and as little of the rind as poffible, to be worn always at the pit of the\nftomach, tied with a yard of white fatin ribbon, half an inch wide, round the neck\nof men and women of an ordinary fiature: if taller, an ell will be wanting; and\nchildren in proportion; but no other coloured ribbon is proper : becaufe the dye in\nfome colours may be prejudicial. The root muff never be wetted, not when frefh\ngathered, but wiped clean with a dry cloth. It muff not be fown up, or covered\nwith any thing, but always worn naked at the pit of the ftomach. If, after wearing,\nthe ends of the fibres ftick out and hurt and prick the ftomach, they muft be cut off\nwith a {harp knife as at firft. When it has been worn a few days it will (brink, by\nthe heat of the ftomach; then the ribbon muft be tied fafter. Obferve the root\nbe not decayed or rotten, but frefh and green when applied ;\nand it is necefiary to\nhave a frefh one every fpring and fall.\nThe fores fhould be wafhed night and morning, with a lotion c.ompofed of vinegar\none third, red port one-third, and diftilled vervain-water one-third. If the diftilled\nvervain-water cannot be fo eafily procured, the infufion of the leaves may be ufed ;\nthat is, boiling water poured upon the herb, like tea, and covefed, when cold, may\nbe ufed in its ftead. The fores after wafhing, fhould be dreffed with an ointment\nmade of green vervain leaves mixed with a fourth part of houfeleek-leaves, boiled\nin pork lard till of a good confidence, and the watery part wafted.\nNo. 30. R WURZEI\n\fAPPENDIX TO\nft\nWURZEL MANGEL, or ROOT of SCARCITY.\nTHIS root in time of fcarcity affords to mankind afalutary and agreeable food;\nand, when fodder is dear, prefents, both in fummer and winter, a copious and cheap\nnourifhmentfor cattle ; which in all feafons as well as in all lands, has an abundant\nand certain produce; and of which the culture is fimple, the harveft and preferva-\niion eafy.\nThis root is not to be claffed either among turnips or carrots ; and, although in\nits exterior and feed it refembles beets, it is much fuperior to thefe plants in every\nrefpect, and feems to be a diftinft genus. Its culture is fo eafy, its advantages fo\nnumerous, fupplying as it does the want of other food, that l think it deferves not\nonly to be adopted every where, but to be preferred to all other roots with which\ncattle are fed, even in the mod plentiful years. It is planted in open and fallow\nground ; and fucceeds well in all, and efpecially in moifl and light lands. If in a\nRiff and clayey foil, where it cannot deepen its fibres, it ftretches horizontally, and\ngrows as large outwardly as it would inwardly, were it not obftructed by the com-\npaftnefs of the foil.\nThis precious root is not fenfibleof the viciflitude of the feafons : it has no de-\nftrudtive enemy ;\nthe all-fpoiling vine-fretter does not bite it ; no other infedl hurts\nit : mildew never affedts it ; nor is its vegetation ever impeded by the drieft fummer.\nIt does not impoverifh the foil which nourifhes it; on the contrary, it prepares it\nfor receiving feeds of every other kind afterwards.\nIn the months of March and April, the land being well prepared, manured, and\nmade light, the largeft and foundeft fcarcity-root feed muft be chofen, fteeped in\nwater for twenty-four hours, and then dried a little, fo that they may be handled.\nLay the line upon the field, as if you were to plant the roots, at the diftance of\nnineteen inches, on each fide ; make with your finger, holes one inch deep, in each\nof which put onegrain only, which cover immediately with earth. After ten or twelve\ndays, it will fhoot, and every grain will have four, five, or fix, foots growing toge-\nther. As foon thefe fmall roots fhew their fourth leaf, the feebleft of them muft\nbe carefully plucked off, and the fineft and moft vigorous root only left. In a little\ntime the growth of the roots thus feledted will be aftonifhing ; not one will fail.\nAfter this manner, equally fimple and eafy, you avoid the tranfplantingof the roots,\nand obtain leaves four or five weeks fooner ; the roots grow finer and larger, and\ndeepen better; and, in a light land, much labour is faved.\nAs the roots naturally grow a little above the ground, you muft notice thofe\nwhich do not fo appear, and bare them by removing the earth from around their top.\nSow the remains of your feed at random, that you may tranfplant the roots where\nyou\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL.' 67\nyou pleafe. If you chufe to leave thefe in the fame place, they muft be thinned and\ndug roundearly : but this is very troublefome, and the roots planted thus never grow\nfo large as thofe whofe feed has been fet. Experience has proved this difference.\nAt the latter end of June, or in the beginning of July, when the outer leaves are\nabout one foot long, the firfl gathering of them is to be made, by breaking them\naround and clofe to the root. For that purpofe you lean your thumb on the infide,\nand at the very bottom of the leaf. You muft take care not to leave a ftump, and\nto gather only the leaves which incline to the ground, always fparing thofe of the\nheart of the plant*, they then are re-produced, and grow fafter.\nImmediately after the firft gathering, the ground round the root is to bs\nagain dug with a mattock \u2022, in which operation the furface of the ground muft be\nremoved from the top of the roots, with a wooden fpatula, fo that every root may be\nuncovered about two inches, which then feems to be planted in a kind of bafon nine\nor ten inches in diameter. A child may eafily do this. In light lands it fuffices to\ngrub the weeds, and ufe well the fpatula. After this fecond very important opera-\ntion, there is nothing more to be done, but to ufe the leaves at pleafure. From this\nmoment the roots begin to ftretch and grow wonderfully. Be careful to deftroy\nall grofs weeds, which partake of their nutrition and give them the advantage of\nthe open air, when they may be left to their own inconceivable vegetation.\nIn a good foil the leaves of thefe roots may be gathered every twelfth or fifteenth\nday. I have often remarked, that the leaves grow to the length of nearly two inches\nand a half, and to the breadth of one inch and a half, within twenty-four hours j\nand at the fecond gathering, they are twenty-eight and thirty inches long, and twenty\nor twenty-two broad. This account may appear exaggerated till experience prove,\nthe truth of it.\nOxen, other cattle, and fheep, are fond of thefe leaves, with which they are eafily\nfed and fattened to the greateft advantage, eating them whole, as they are brought\nfrom the field \u2022, but for poultry they muft be minced and mixed with bran. They\nare alfo very good nourifhment for horfes during the fummer; for this purpofe\nthey need only be minced with that kind of knife which I will hereafter defcribe,\nand mixed with cut ftraw. Swine alfo heat them very heartily.\nThe leaves of fcarcity-root afford alfo a wholefome and pleafant food for man.\nThe ftalks of them are eaten like thofe of beets, but have not the fame earthy tafte.\nThey may be prepared in different manners : when dreffed like fpinage, many prefer\nthem to it. By the continual fucceffion of their production, from fpring to the\nmonth of November, they are very ufeful to farmers, and all others who maintain\na great number of fervants. In winter time the roots are eaten, dreffed alfo different\nways j\nthey are wholeforntj of an agreeable tafte, much fuperior to the red- beet, and .\n1\n\fAPPENDIX TO\nat leaft equal to the turnip. The leaves produced by the roots when preferred in a\na cellar, during the winter, are very foft and delicate.\n1 he approach of fevere frofts fhews the time for getting in the rotts. This pre-\nvious harveft muft be made in fine weather, though it be a few days fooner than\notherwife neceflary, as the prefervation of the roots depends very much on their\nbeing houfed dry. The roots mult be plucked early in the morning, and left ex-\npoled to the air and the fun ; children go behind the perfon who plucks them, and\ncut the leaves to the heart \u2022, an operation which may as well be performed one or\nmore days before the harvelt. In the evening the roots mull be collected together,\nand, if fufficiently dr ied, lodged in a place well fecured againft fevere frofts. It there\nis nothing to be apprehended from rain, thofe which have been plucked in the even-\ning may be left in tire field, and carried home next day. It is beft to leave them ex-\npoled to the air for two or three days, when the weather will permit. As their fkin\nis very thin, they mull be handled fortly, and great care taken not to bruife them,\nwhich would be prejudicial to their prefervation.\nThe harveft time is precifely that wherein tiie roots proper for bearing feed fhould\nb>e fixed upon ; and thofe are the beft for the purpoie which have attained only to\na middle fize, arelmooth and even, roly on theoutfide, and white or marbled white\nand red within : fuch is the description of the roots which ought to be preferved for\ncultivation. Thofe which are entirely red or entirely white, are either roots dege-\nnerated, or the real red-beets, whofe feeds have not been carefully diftinguifhed by\nthe Tower. It is neceflary to feparate, and fhelter from all moifture and froft, the\nroots which are defigned for feed.\nIn the beginning of April, thofe roots which have been fet apart for feed muft be\nplanted in the open field, three feet diftant from each other. As their ftems grow\nfive or fix feet high, they muft be kept up with props feven feet high, placed a foot\nand a half in the ground, with fmall rods between them, in order to form a kind of\ntrellis, to which the ftems are tied, as they grow up, to prevent their being broken\nby the wind.\nThe feed ordinarily ripens towards the latter end of Odober : it muft be ga-\nthered immediately after the firft hoar- frofts. The ftems are then cut, and placed\nagainft a wall or palifade, if the weather permits ; if not, they are tied in fmall\nbundles, and hung up in a flickered airy place, till they are quite dry. At laft the\nfeed is taken and preferved in bags, like others of the kitchen garden.\nThe feed of the fcarcity-roots degenerate, like all others, if the foil is not changed\nevery year, or eyery two years. Care muft be taken, therefore, to low in a ftiff foil\nthat feed which has been grown in a light or Tandy foil; and in light foil, that\nwhich has been grown in a ftrong and compact foil. Thus thofe who cultivate\nfuch\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S B R I T I $ H HERBAL.\nfueh or fuch lands, may be of great fervice to one another by making annual ex-\nchanges. This feed preferves all its qualities for three or four years.\nIf the quantity of the roots you intend to preferve is too great to be lodged in the\nhoufe, fome days before they are pulled pits (hould be dug in the field, or any other\n\u00a3>lace that is fheltered from water during the winter. After the infide of thefe pits\nhas been left to dry for eight or ten days, their bottom and fides muft be covered\nwith a imall quantity of draw, and the roots afterwards be placed regularly one by\none, taking care not to bruife them, and to clean them well from the particles of\ntheir natural foil. Then let the upper roots be over-laid with ftra-v, which is to\nbe covered three feet deep with the earth dug from the pit \u2022, and this earth mull be\nhard beaten, anddifpofed in a Hoping manner, that the water may eafily flow off.\nThe dimenfions of the pits ought to be proportioned either to the riling of the\nground, or to its declivity. They may be from two to three feet deep. Their\nlength depends on the quantity of roots which are to be placed in them, but their\nbreadth is commonly three feet and a half.\nThefe roots poflcfling the valuable quality of being capable of prefervation till\nthe month of June without the lead alteration, it will not be amifs to multiply the\npits, and to make one for each month, beginning in March, when the winter\nprovifion is ordinarily over. The reafon for this advice to multiply the pits is, be-\ncaufe, if the roots, after having been deprived of the adbion of the air, are expofed\nto it a-new, they do not preferve their fre Panel's long. The multiplying of the pits\nwill prevent this inconvenience.\nEvery pit absolutely requires an air-hole, through which the fermentation of the\nroots may evaporate; for without this precaution all the roots you intend to pre-\nferve under the earth will rot. The air-hole muft be made in the following man-\nner Before any thing is put into the pit, a pole fix or feven feet long, and two\ninches in diameter, muft be planted in the middle of it ; then place therein the roots,\nand difpofe them in a Hoping direction. When the pit is full, and the roots are half\na foot above the level of the ground in the middle part, twift a rope of hay about\nan inch thick round the pole, taking care not to bind it too hard. After that is\ndone, throw on the earth, and difpofe and beat it as before-mentioned. When the\npit is quite covered, take out the pole ; the hay will remain in the hole, through\nwhich the exhalation arifing from the fermentation of the roots will pafs. After\nfome days, the hole muft be covered with a pan-tile, and, on the approach of fevere\ncold, (hut quite clofe with a flatftone.\nThat cattle of every kind may eat the roots, they muft be cut or minced, after\nthey have been walhed and cleaned ; which is done with a kind of knife, i. e. a blade\nof iron, one foot long and two inches broad, bent like an S, to the middle of which\nNo. 30. 5 is\n\f70 APPENDIX TO\nis foldered a focket about fix inches long. In this focket is fixed a wooden handle,\nabout three feet fix inches long. With this knife, which at firft fight feems intended\nfor printing the letter S, the roots are minced as equally as eafily. This operation is\nperformed in a bucket or trough ufed for that purpofe only. A fingle man in one\nhour is able to mince a quantity of roots fufficient to feed twelve oxen a whole day.\nBefore the roots are put into the trough, they muft be cut in large pieces. It will\nbe befl: to mince them as fmall as a walnut.\nThe roots, being prepared as above, may, without being mixed with any other\nfood, be given to horned cattle and fheep, and efpecially to thofe which are to be\nfattened : but, if it is neceffary to be fparing of the roots, they may be mixed with\none-fourth part or more of hay and minced ftraw. It is even proper to obferve that\nmethod during the three or four firft weeks, wibh refpedt to lean cattle, which are\nmeant to be fattened. Dry trefoil, faintfoin, &c. are belt for this ufe. Thofe who\nhave a hay-knife for cutting dry fodder, of the fame fort with that ufed in Germany\nwith fo much fuccefs and advantage, willfave much time, and confumelefs of their\nprovifion.\nHorfes may be fed, during the winter, with the fcarcity-roots, by adding to them\none half of hay and ftraw minced together, which will make them healthy, fat, and\nvigorous. But in the feafon of hard and conftant labour, a fmall quantity of oats\nmuft, from time to time, be added. This is the pradicein thofe provinces of Ger-\nmany, where the fcarcity-roots fervealmoft inftead of meadows, and of w;\nhich the\nhorfes are well known and efteemed.\nSwine eat thefe roots very well, raw, minced, and mixed in their greafy or milky\ndrink. They become as fat as thofe which are fed with potatoes, which require to\nbe boiled. By the ufe of this root, the expence of wood and coals, as well as the\ntrouble of boiling, &c. isfaved.\nBefides the advantages which have been already enumerated, the fcarcity-roots\nafford many others \u2022, amongft which, in particular, is the certainty of an abundant\nharveft, whatever may be the intemperature of the feafons.\nIf the culture of this root is adopted, it will no more be neceffary to let the grafs\nof the natural or artificial meadows be eaten by cattle during the hammer-, all\nwhich will, therefore, be converted into hay. How great, then, will be the quanti-\nty of hay to be fold, fince, during the winter, more than two thirds of it will be\nfaved! And, as the roots facilitate the feeding cattle in the ftables for the whole\nyear, the quantity of dung, fo neceffary to agriculture, will be increafed. \u2014When\nthis root fhall be well known to the farmers, there is no doubt but they will pre-\nfer it to all other fodder of the like kind.\n2 TABLES\n\fC ULPEPER\u2019s BRITISH HERBAL. 7*\nTABLES and INSTRUCTIONS for GATHERING HERBS and PLANTS\nin the PLANETARY HOUR.\nTABLE No. I.\nTo find the Beginning and End of the Planetary Hour by Day for ever.\nPlace\nof the\no.\nHotirs from Sun-r fe to Is oon. ]4ours from Noon to Sun-fet\nf . ... 1- -\nPlace\nof the\nO.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1\n9 IO 1\n1\n12\nbignD H.

So alfo the fpace of time from\nfun-fet till fun-rifeis divided into twelve parts ; thefe hours are unequal, confifting of\nmore or lefs than fixty minutes, as the fun recedes from v or =&, as will be feenby\nexample by the foregoing Table.\nThe feven planets are attributed by the ancients to prefide over the feven days of\nthe week, and each of them rules over the firft hour of each day, as may be fefen by\nthe Table. The firft planetary hour of Sunday is the Sun, the fecond is Venus, and\nfo on ; the firft planetary hour of Monday is the Moon, the fecond is Saturn ; and\nthe fame is to be obferved of the other days.\nThe ufe of thefe Tables will appear by bare infpeCtion, as they req uire no fort of\ncalculation, but a perfon of the meaneft capacity will be able to underfcand them.\nThereafon of their being placed in this manner, in the form of Tables, is, becaufe\nno Herbals which fpeak of the-force and power of planetary influx, and the necef-\nfity of gathering herbs for medical ufe under the planet which principally governs\nthem, have laid down any rule whereby an herbarift may know when thofe planetary\nhours are, and confequently could not know the fit time to gather them. This de-\nficiency has not only occafioned much uneafinefs in the minds of many medical\ngentlemen, but has much prevented the progrefs of cures, and many diforders have\nbeen deemed incurable from not making ufe of the precifion which is abfolutely\nneceflary for the perfection of fome cures.\nThefe Tables are fo calculated, as by bare infpeCtion to point out thofe beautiful\ntimes, when man, who is endowed with a rational foul derived from the centre, is\nable by expanding itfelf into the circumference of this outward nature, fo to hit\nupon the hour, not only in gathering of herbs, roots, &c. but to adminifter them\nin a time correfponding thereunto, and thereby force from the patient the offending\nmatter that robs him of the moft invaluable bleffing of health. But, as I intend\nnot this as a treatife, but as a fmall part of the Key to Phyfic, I fhall therefore pafs\nover all obfervations on the ebb and flow of all fublunary virtues in terrene things,\nand only fay truth needs not many words to recommend it, but will demonftrate\nitfelf by trial ; fo thefe Tables, and the reft of this little Key, will prove to the\nafflicted patient, or to the compaflionate phyfician, the legitimate offspring of\nTRUTH and EXPERIENCE,\n2 EXAM-\n\fCULPEPER\u2019S BRITISH HERBAL. 15\nEXAMPLE I.\nTo find the planetary hour on Sunday, the 22d of April, 1792, at half paft ten\no\u2019clock in the morning.-\u2014I examine in the Ephemeris what degree the Sun is in,\nand find on that day at noon he is in three degrees of the fign Taurus \u2022, with this\ndegree I enter the Table No. I. and feek three degrees of b in the firft column, and,\nby running even in the columns, in the feventh column I find ioh. 49m. which\nfhews me, if I look on the top of the Table, that the fifth planetary hour would finifh\nat forty-nine minutes paft ten o\u2019clock in the morning. Now I refer to the former\ncolumn, and find the fifth planetary hour began at thirty-feven minutes paft nine\no\u2019clock \u2022, now as the time I entered was ioh. 30m. in the morning, and ir being be-\ntween gh. 37m. and ioh. 49m. it proved it to be the fifth planetary hour. To\nknow what planet ruled this hour, I enter the Table No. III. and, counting down\nthe planets in the firft column under the word Sunday, find the fifth planetary hour\non that day to be Saturn ; if it had been on a Monday, the fifth planetary hour would\nhave been the Sun ; on a Tuefday, it would have been the Moon ; on a Wednes-\nday, Mars \u2022, and fo on \u2022, by which rule may be found the planetary hour for any day\nof the week.\nEXAMPLE II.\nWe will fuppofe that we want to find the hour of Venus on Saturday, the 19th\nof January, 1793.-\u2014 1 look into the Ephemeris, and find the Sun at noon on that day\nis in Deg. o I enter the Fable marked No. III. and, in the column of the pla-\nnetary hours under Saturday, I find the fifth hour is under Venus \u2022, now, as the Sun\nis in o deg. of Aquaries, I enter the Table No. II. in the right-hand column with\no and in the ninth column on the left hand, I find the planetary hour of Venus\nbegan twenty minutes paft eleven o\u2019clock, and continued till noon on that day.\nSuch was the mode of praflice, when nature only was confuked, and the intention\nreally to make a cure, without a view to gain: then difeafe was but little known, and\npeople lived to a good old age.\nCONTENTS\n\fC 76 t\nCON T ENTS of\nPEruvian or Jefuit\u2019s Bark\nBread-Fruit Tree\nCafhew-Nut Tree\nCanella Alba\nCoffee-Tree\nCitrus, or Forbidden-Fruit Tree\nGarcinia\nManchineel-Tree\nMarfh-Mallow of Surinam\nMandrake\nMimofa, or Senfitive Plant\nMyriftica, 6r Nutmeg-Tree\nFlowering Pavonis\npage 1\n9\n12\n*3\nH\n20\n22\n24\n.25\n27\n27\n34\n40\nthe APPENDIX.\nPimento, or Jama'ica Pepper Tree -\nPlantain-Tree - tr '\nTrue Turkey Rhubarb\nIndian Rocu\nSpeedwell\nStarry Anifeed - - -\nSugar Maple Tree\nTea-Tree - -\nVervain -\nWurzel Mangel, or R.ootof Scarcity\nTables and Directions. for gathering Herbs\nand Plants in the Planetary Hour.\n40\n44\n49\n53\n54\n54\n57\n58\n6s\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS to the BINDER.\nLET the Plates belonging to the APPENDIX be placed as nearly oppofite to the defcription of\n-each plant, -as circumftances will allow; obferving never to place two cuts together, hut to turn\nover the next leaf, fo as to have one leaf of letter-prefs between them.\nDIRECTIONS for binding the KEY and CULPEPER together.\nLet the APPENDIX be placed at the End of CULPEPER\u2019s BRITISH HERBAL, which\nwill complete the firft Volume; and at the End of the MEDICAL PART of CULPEPER,\nadd the KEY to PHYSIC, &c. which will divide them into two uniform Volumes, and make the\nwhole Subject complete\u2014To be lettered, Dr. SIBLY\u2019s FAMILY PHYSICIAN.\nDIRECTIONS for Binding Dr. Sibly\u2019s Works in FOUR VOLUMES.\nLET the Sixty Numbers of the Occult Sciences be divided into two Volumes; and the above\ntwo volumes added to them, making four in the whole ; to be double-lettered,\nin the following\nOrder, viz.
