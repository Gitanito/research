Election.\nThe fir\u017ft (and indeed the chief) way, of making or\nframingan Eleftion, is, from the Gene\u017fis or Nativity of\nthe Per\u017fon or thing, for whom it is de\u017figned tobe \u017fewicea\nble, in ca\u017fe that can be but truly knownand obtained.\nAnd this is the be\u017ft and mo\u017ft rational way of making or\nframing an Election, and \u017fo approved of by the be\u017ft and\nlearned of Aftrological Writers; becau\u017fe here is a \u017fe\ncure ground or foundation for the Arti\u017ft to build on :\nIt being a mo\u017ft certain, \u017fplendid, and ruled truth \u2013 That\nall Progre\u017f\u017fes and Ends of Things, are Analogous or \u017fuita\nble to their beginnings. And there can be no beginning \u017fo:\nab\u017folute and ; and, in all re\u017fpects, \u017fo fit tobe re.\nly'd on, inthe\u017fe matters, as a Radix or Nativity truly\nknown and proved. - *\nTo illu\u017ftrate this way of makingan Election, it is cond\nvenient, that I de\u017fcend to a practical In\u017ftance. *:\nKnow then, that if thou woulde\u017ft Elect atime favou-\u00ba\nrable from the Nativity or Birth of anything, for thy:\npurpo\u017fe, thou mu\u017ft then make the Figure of Heaven,\nor thy Election, agreeable thereunto, by framing it in\nSextile or Triue unto that; or by making the places ol\nthe Fortunate Stars, viz. Y. S. G). or D. or their Trint\nand Sextile places therein, the A\u017fcendant or Mid-Hea.\nven, or the Sun, or Moons, or Part of Fortune's places.\nin thy Election, ever being careful to avoid the places di\nSaturn, Mars, or the Dragons Tail inthe Radix, or their\nOppo\u017fite or Quadrantal places, as dangerous for either:\nyour Horo\u017fcope, Medium Cali, Sun, or Moon, &c in\nyour Election, and then leave the I\u017f\u017fue to providence.\nAnd, here by the way, let not the ingenious Reader\nmi\u017ftake me, or think that I a\u017f\u017fert a Remini\u017fcency in the\nStars, as in Animate or Rea\u017fonable Creatures; or that\n\fThe A\u017ftrological Sea-eM\u0101m. 19\nIbelieve the Planets to wear Socks, . . .\neither perfum'd or of an ill \u017fcent, as hi \u00ba:\u00ba\u00ba:\na lateLearned Author is plea\u017fed, in ...\u201d \u201c*\nthe room of better matter, to ca\u017ft - -\n\u017fcoffingly upon A\u017ftrologers. I only a\u017f\u017fert \u00e0 Harmony\nand Similitude in the Sphears of Heaven, and in the Mo\ntions of the Planets; together with an Energy by their\nMotion, to \u017ftimulate Influences, kind, or unkind, in re\n\u017fpect of us poor Mortals. And although the Stars\u017fhould\nhaveno knowledge of the places they were in at a Nati\nvity, that they \u017fhould be pre\u017fumed to remember what\ntheydid there, or what Influences they irritated and emit\ntedthe la\u017ft time they pa\u017f\u017fed their Radical places; yet,\ntertainly, the God of Stars knew well enough, that\nhehad Created them, and appointed them al\u017fo, to a\u010dt and\ndo his plea\u017fure (aswe mu\u017ft acknowledge they are always\nFrforming) when they come there: And that is by a\u017f\nfiringus, they have in them\u017felves a known and unaltera\nbeinfluence in one and the\u017fame part of Heaven always;\nand this as certain asin a Clocks \u017ftriking, when the hours\nit directs to, are accompli\u017fhed.\nThus the Sun when he comes to ri\u017fe Co\u017fmically with\nthe Stars of the Eagle, always pro- \u2022\nducethRainand Winds. So al\u017fo, with Tran\u017fis very Powdful\nWirgilie, or Seven Stars. And, the in tv\u00bary r\u00ba\u017fti.\nlikeal\u017fo, when he comes to their op- -\npo\u017fite places. After this manner, when he ri\u017feth with\nthe Dog-Star (although \u017fome think that Camis non A\u017fordet\n#Anglia) have we a hot and parching Air, and an in\nkmperate Sea\u017fon. Cum multis aliis, &c. And, thus al\n| F. or 3. pa\u017f\u017fing the A\u017fcendant G\u00ba, or X. in any\nbesNativity, (chiefly, if they oppre\u017f\u017fed them, or any\nf them in the Radix thereof) irritates Choller, or in\nFea\u017feth Melancholly; whereas, A. G. and Y. pa\u017f\u017fing\nHe \u017fame places, exite a Generous, Plea\u017fant, Free and\nheerful humour. And of the truth hereof, can I pro\nce abundant retive, \u00baf any Man, that \u00ba:\n- a 2. lit\n\f20 The A\u017ftrological Sea-Mam.\nbut his Nativity by him, may ea\u017fily prove the truth\nhereof in him\u017felf, and that frequently. -\nLet but the Antagoni\u017ft be \u017fo ingenious as to ob\u017ferve a\nlittle the\u017fe matters, and then Character me for an Impo\n\u017ftor, and a broacher of Fables to delude the World with,\nin the room of Truth to inform it, if he do not find the\u017fe\nthings true.

Howbeit\n>\n\fThe A\u017firological Sea-Mam. 21\nHowbeit, although its General Fate, be written in the\nparticular Po\u017fition of Heaven; yet, we find that is apt\ntobeeither augmented or dimini\u017fhed, by a careful heed\ning, or a non-ob\u017fervance, of \u017fuch Times, wherein it is to\nbe Re-launched, or, when it \u017fhall weigh Anchor, in or\n| derto \u017fome particular Service or A\u0107tion for the future.\n! Now, we know a Ship can be Launched but once, in re\ngard of its Nativity, and in relation to its General Fate:\nbut, itmay be Re-launched forty times, in re\u017fpect of its\nParticular Fate; which is terminated in every .\n;A\u00e9tion, for which \u017fhe happensto be thus particularly\ntted. - -\n. Therefore, to Elect a time favourable for this Ship to\nbegin any Eminent A\u00e9tion, from its Nativity, is to ob.\n\u017ferve the \u017fame, and the places of the good Planets there\nin; (as before you were taught) and let the Figure of\ntheElection, as near as you can, be under either \u00a3.

Asindeed,\nwith re\u017fpect had to the Original hereof, which was the\nFigure of the Que\u017ftion, it was. But, we mu\u017ftalways\ncon\u017fider, that God and Nature do nothing in vain; for,\nhad not this Querent been irritated to an Interrogation,\nthis au\u017fpicious Ele\u0107tion could never have been liable to an\nabatement of its good \u017fignifications: but, as it hatha de\npendance upon that for its Radix, we cannot expect it\n\u017fhould have the full Effects of \u017fo many Illu\u017ftriousSignifi\ncations. For we mu\u017ft know, and \u017fhall ever be \u017fure to\nfind ittrue, That an Election (be it never \u017fo good or bad\nin it \u017felf) can never totaly alter the Promi\u017fesor A\u017fenaces of\nan Original Que\u017ftion, which is its Nativity, but only\naugment to the Good, or mitigate the Evil of them. For\ntherein are the Seeds of the fift or Misfortune of\n\u017fuch Voyage or Ve\u017f\u017fel inclo\u017fed; as Fruit is originally in\nits Root; or as Scent and Colours of Wegitables are ver\nally in their Seeds. \" - - Nor\n\fThe A\u017ftrological Sea-Mam. 29\nNor need any trouble them\u017felveswith obje\u010dting, that,\nnot a Question, but a Nativity, is the Radix properly of\nan Election. Sith the Que\u017ftion, if with a \u017feriousand \u017fo\nlicitous mind propounded, is ever the \u017fame, (or very\nlike unto it) in \u017fignification with the Radix; and may\ntherefore be rea\u017fonably pre\u017fumed equal with the proper\nRoot thereof; e\u017fpecially when the true Nativity is not\nknown, or not by any means to be found. As a Step\nFather, in the room of the natural Sire, performing all\nthe Offices of a Father, is, by a Child to be looked upon\nand owned in the \u017fame Capacity, and Relation to him,\nas was his real Father, when alive. And if experience\nwill \u017ferve to vouch this verity further, (if there be at\nlea\u017ft any need thereof) I can produce \u017fufficient.\u2014 But\nto the Effect.\nThe Ship did weigh Anchor at the time Elected; and\nwithin\u017fix days did receiveDammage by a Storm,wherein\nit had like to have been Wrecked. In twenty days af\nter, it had neerly been ca\u017ft away again, by running into\nthe Quick\u017fands; but, with greater danger than lo\u017fs, in\nlittle time got very well off again.\nAfterwards, this We\u017f\u017fel made its Port both pro\u017fper\nou\u017fly and \u017fpeedily; \u017fo al\u017fo, it did make a happy return\nhomeagain, and this without any material or remarkable\nprejudiceor dammage;excepting that they weredi\u017ftre\u017f\u017fed\n\u017fomewhat intheir return, for Provi\u017fion, and fre\u017fh water,\n\u017fome of theirs proving ill; by rea\u017fon whereof, (as might\nbe rea\u017fonably \u017fupposd) both the Ma\u017fter and Marriners\nwere a little unhealthful.\u2013 There happen'd al\u017fo a \u017fmall\n| Mutiny in the Ship, (like 3 in the Horo\u017fcope of the Que\n\u017ftion) occa\u017fion'd by an unlucky impudent fellow, a Car\npenter belonging to the Ship; this was \u017ftill as they were\nreturning home,\nTo conclude, the profit of the Voyage was much le\u017fs\nthan waseither expected, or at fir\u017ft propounded by the\nOwners; or, (as I have heard the Ma\u017fter of the Ve\u017fki\n\u017fay) than was ever known before.\n- Th\u00bas\n\f3o The A\u017ftrological Sea-Mum.\nThushave you abrief, but true Hi\u017ftory of the whole\nmatter. And, in every re\u017fpect, mo\u017ft \u017fuitable to the \u017fig\nnifications of the bad portended in the Scheam of the\nQuestion, and likewi\u017fe of the \u017fafety denoted by the Fi\ngure of the Election. ! .\nBy which we may ob\u017ferve, That anill Que\u017ftion may\nbe bettered by a fortunate Election of Time. And,\nthat a good Ele\u00e3ion is really \u017ferviceable and profitable.\nBut then, we may al\u017fo ob\u017ferve, That tho' the Election\nbe never \u017fo good in it\u017felf, its au\u017fpicious \u017fignifications can\nnot totally avert the unhappy Menaces of that Figure,\nor Radix, from whence you make or frame the Election.\nAnd, \u017fo you have the \u017fecond way of framing an Electi.\non explained. |\n*\nThe Third way of making an Elim,\nThe Thirdwayof making an Ele\u017ftion, Aftrologically,\nis, when ueither the Nativity of the Ship or We\u017f\u017fel is\nknown, nor yetan Horary Qae\u017ftion propounded concer\nning it. And, thus I can a\u017f\u017fure you, it often falls out.\nFor there is \u017fcarce one Man of ten, that knows his time\nof Birth; and, I pre\u017fume, there is \u017fcarce one Ship of\nan hundred, who\u017fe Gene\u017fis, or time of fir\u017ft Launching,\nwas ever taken notice of. Thegreaterpartof the World\neither thinking to over-look all Starry Influences, or el\u017fe\nare readily willing to neglect them; as believing \u017fuch\nknowledge, (though both excellent and veritable in it\n\u017felf ) to be only the Apocriphal part of Philo\u017fophy, and\ntherefore in no wi\u017fe fit to be minded by any that Hunger\nand Thir\u017ft after true Wi\u017fdom. \u00ba\n& But this obiter.- If the Birth-hour benot known\nnor yet a Que\u017ftion concerning your matter propounded,\nthe Arti\u017ft mu\u017ft then endeavour to find a Po\u017fition of Hea\nven, wherein the A\u017foon, and Lord of the Horo\u017fcope, &c.\n\u017fhall be in good and fortunate places of the Figure, and \u017f\u00ba\nin Signs Superiour and Commanding, free from affli\u0107tion.\nand impediment of any kind. - I\n\fThe A\u017ftrological Sea-Man, 3 I\nI would not, now, here, have any over Curious or\nCritital Per\u017fon (and yet I know A\u017ftrology hath its Here\nliques, as well as Divinity) from Opinion and Humour\nonly, obje\u0107t to me.\u2014 That Elections are not to be made,\nbut from \u017fome known Radix. For, if by an nnknown\nRadix(which isthe rever\u017fe of theknown) they mean the\nNativity of a Per\u017fon or We\u017f\u017fel not to be found, or of a\nQue\u017ftion unpropounded, &c. Then to \u017fome per\u017fons,\nWe\u017f\u017fels, &c. the Heavens mu\u017ftas to humane Science be\nwholly u\u017fele\u017fs; becau\u017fe it is impo\u017f\u017fible to Derive, or\nElect, from that which is not, or is not, at lea\u017ft toour\nknowledge. But this were a gro\u017fs ab\u017furdity, as well as\na great untruth to \u017fuppo\u017fe, Syth the Aoy& anteuxliiis,\nor \u00batherial matter, isin every placecon\u017ftantly operating\nto \u017fome particular end. And, although the Lines by\nwhich this \u017fubtile Influence is directed, \u017ferve not me, or\nis not forcible enough to moveme, to doubt, it may, be\nyet \u017ftrong enough to direct me to A\u00e9t; and, \u017fo I ma\nhappily make choi\u017feof a good timetocommence my Af\nfairsin, although I know not theNativities of the Per\u017fons\nor things, which are In\u017ftruments or Mediums by which\nmy purpo\u017fed Affairsarebrought to pa\u017fs. . For, God and\nNature, as they are never idle, \u017fo they do nothing, but\nto\u017fome \u017fignaleffect or purpo\u017fe.\nHeaven hath its various Sea\u017fons in it \u017felf, as well as\ntous: and Beginnings, whether to Men known or un\nknown, have proportionate progre\u017f\u017fesand ends. And,\n(if Seneca may be believed) it is not in humane power to\ncontradi\u0107t an Original De\u017ftinated Intention: \u017fo, that if\nthy Election be good, thou neede\u017ft notdoubt, butthe Ra\ndix belouging tothe We\u017f\u017fel thou frame\u017ft thy Election for,\nisgood al\u017fo.\nIf therefore by an unknown Radix, they mean a time\ninvolved in the general Rowl of the Heavens, which are\nthe fir\u017ft movers, augmentorsand decayers of all things;\nwe mu\u017ftfreely acknowledge that \u017fuch Time, by rea\u017fon\nof aninfinite Coele\u017ftial variety, is too hard for Mortality\n- - to\ni\n\f32 The A\u017ftrological Sea-Mam.\ntodi\u017fcover, withouttheadvantage of DivineIn\u017fpiration.\nYet is this no injury to our way of Elettion, but rather\n\u017feems to conclude our \u00a7: For, it is in this fence\nthat I a\u017f\u017fert Elections, profitableand truly tobe made and\nknown, tho' the Nativity be Ignote, or that there bene\nver any Que\u017ftion propounded: Sith the Election is ever\nthe Image of the Radix; and what is Ignote to us, is\nnot \u017fo in it \u017felf, but hath a place in the Univer\u017fal Regi\nfter of Nature. And all things derive from the Heavens.\nBut yet, if any \u017fhallfurther obje\u0107t, that, \u017fhould we\nallow of \u017fuchkind of Elections, they are as probable to\nprove Bad as Good. . As Morine and \u017fome others, among\nus, very idly from him have\u017fugge\u017fted; urging that the\nEighth or Twelve Hou\u017fes, &c. as well as the Eleventh,\nFifth,or Tenth, &c. of a Radix, maya\u017fcend theEa\u017ftern\nFinitor in an Election. Or, that the places ofSaturn and\nMars, or their Oppo\u017fitions or Qgadrantal places, may\u00ba\nin a Figure of Election, happen to be Horo\u017fcopical, as\nwell as the places of jupiter or Venus, or their Sextile,\nor Trigonal Beams: And \u017fo come to render that Pernitious\nand De\u017ftructive, which our Election pronounceth good,\nhappy, and hopeful. And, on the contrary, may de--\nnotethat to be Fortunate and Succe\u017fsful, which we may\nnot only fear, but find to be attended with ab\u017folute Ruine .\nand De\u017ftru\u0107tion. To this I an\u017fwer. - \u00ba\nIf thething were po\u017f\u017fible which is urged by this Ob\nje\u0107tion, the Inference, would indeed, prove too \u017ftrong\ntobe \u017fhaken or invalidated by any Man. But it is not\npo\u017f\u017fible that there can beany Contradi\u0107tion to the Ope\nrations of Nature, where a Mans Will is at liberty, and .\nonly to be Exerci\u017fed, as him\u017felf plea\u017feth, as it is in the\nframing of an Election of Time, when a Radix is whol.\nly unknown. - -\n...Be\u017fides, Nature would be found guilty of offering\nViolenceto its own Decrees, if it \u017fhould de\u017ftroy its ge: ;\nneralintentionfor the\u017fake, or advantage of any onepar\nticular, asin this Ca\u017fe. As is theRiver, \u017fo isthe Stream,\n\fThe Aftrological Sea-JMam. 33\nforeither Goodne\u017f; or Badne\u017fs. And if the Tree be good,\ntheFruit thence i\u017f\u017fuing cannot be impro\u017fperous. Know\ntherefore, that if thy Radix be kind; (let it be known\nor unknown) thy Election cannot be cruel. Can any\none accu\u017fe Nature for want of skill in Geometry? if\nnot, why may we not (by God's Ble\u017ffing) thereby, be\ndirected to a favourable Election, although we do not\nknow our Radixor Nativity? - -\nBut, methinks, the matter is mo\u017ft plain, and put be\nyond all doubt, in the verity of Horary Que\u017ftions, (of\nwhich we mention'd \u017fomewhat before.) Ina\u017fmuch, that\neither the \u017fame Horo\u017fcope, with thatof the Nativity, or\na Sign of the \u017fame Trigon, (which is ever \u017femblable unto\ni) hath ever been found to po\u017f\u017fe\u017fs the Ea\u017ft Angle at the\ntime of the \u017ferious propounding any Horary \u00a7.\nAld this I have more than an hundred times proved true;\nbyanafter knowledge of the true Gene\u017fis or Nativity of\n\u017findry Querents. -\nA Con\u017fpicuous Truth thereofit is, that the Heavens,\ninre\u017fpect of the \u017fame Subje\u0107t, move to the \u017fame effect,\nby a \u017fimilitude of Figure. And con\u017fequently, an Electi\ni.may be profitably made, although the Radix be not\n[10Wn. -\nSome, may al\u017fo yet further obje\u0107t. If neither a Ra\ndixbe known, or a Que\u017ftion \u017feriou\u017fly propounded by a\nQurrent concern'd, and it be true that the Progre\u017f\u017fes and\nEidsof Things an\u017fwer to their Beginnings; what need\nthenhave we to make Elections 2 \u2013 1 An\u017fwer,--\n...

When in your Figure youfind the Principal Signifi\ncators of a Ship or We\u017f\u017fel, (you were acquainted which\nthey were before) and of the Men \u017failing therein, to be\n\u017ftrong and well po\u017fited, and every way freefrom Affli\n\u00e9tion, you may then Judge \u017fafety and \u017fucce\u017fs to the\nShip, and tothe A4ariners al\u017fo.\n3.

So happy is it, when you\nfind the Arguments of Mi\u017fchief under Hatches,and tho\u017fe\nof good \u017fucce\u017fs, exalted.\n4.

And if the Moon be above the Earth, in good\nA\u017fpect, viz.

Nay, I thereforefurther advi\u017fed him not to En.\n\u017fure, the Arguments of Hopes were \u017fo \u017ftrong.\nThe Querent followed my Advi\u017fe, and, had norea.\n\u017fon to repent it; for he thereby \u017faved his Premium M.\nney.\nas I Judged : and camehome in a fortnight following.\nMany Men, \u017fomewhat acquainted with A\u017ftrology, may,\nwith a \u017feeming \u017fhew of Rea\u017fon, Object, \u2014 That Saturn\nin the Fourth, in Oppo\u017fition of Mars, \u017fhouldnot declare \u017fo\ngood an I\u017f\u017fueas ishere \u017fet down. \u2014 I An\u017fwer,- Saturn\nis not in the Fourth of the Que\u017ftion, though he be of the\nFigure.

Fol. 6. If \u017fuch a piece of\n\u017fervice for the Planetary Philo\u017fophy, were worthy to be\nremembred to Po\u017fterity, certainly, a Diary of triplethe\nlength, will not, withthe Ingeniousand knowing Natu\nrali\u017ft, be refu\u017fed a Friendly Entertainment into his\nThoughts, and Library. -\nIt was the Opinion of the late Excellent Dr. Goad.\nThat the Heavens andStars were like a well-order'd In\u017ftru:\nment which the Planets making their Appul\u017fes to, or Pa\u017f\u017fing\nby, do con\u017ftantly\u017ftimulate\u017fuch Influences as are agreeableto\ntheir Natures, and to the con\u017ftellations inhence they pro\nceed.

It will prove to us, and that by more than CXL.\nIn\u017ftances, (if any will take but the pains as I have done\nto ob\u017ferve them.) That the Heavens are ever \u017fubje\u0107t to\nDi\u017fturbance and Onquietude, when Mercury Changes his\nSign. Probably one main rea\u017fon why theAntient A\u017ftrolo\ngers have Affigned him a Government equal to Saturn in\nthe Airy Trygon. - -\nII. That we havea fall of wet upon every New or Full\nMoon, at lea\u017ft withinthe compa\u017fs of the Triduum,which\nRarely failing verity is Eminently \u017fupported by Dr.\nGoad in his Aftro-Meteorologica, Con\u017fult hisadmirable\nHi\u017ftory of the Moon therein. -\nIII. That the Sun, Venus, Mars, do occa\u017fion the like\nCommotions and Alterations as Mercury, more or le\u017fs,\nwhen They pa\u017fs from one Sign to another.\u2014 Do\u010dtor\nGoad, con\u017fidering the certainty of Mars his Effetts in\nthe Mutation of the Air, was pleas'd to term him his\nIDOL. See his Learned Di\u017fcour\u017fe of the Pleiades. And\nthisour Diary affordsabundant Proofof this Truth to any\nMan that \u017fhallbe plea\u017fed to take the pains toob\u017ferve it.\nIV. That all the afore\u017faid Planets pa\u017f\u017fing by, or ri\u017fing\nor \u017fetting with the Fixed Stars, as are the Pleiades, A\u017felli,\nWindemiator, Eagle , Dolphin, &c. or tran\u017fiting their\nOppo\u017fite places, do produce an alteration in the Air, \u017futa\nbleto the Natures of tho\u017fe Con\u017ftellations,and to that of the\n\u017feveralSea\u017fonsofthe Year. The Learned Hartgilaffirm'd\nan Influence in the A\u017fpetts of the Fixed Stars, as well as\nin the Erratique. - -\nV. That hereby is \u017fufficiently evinced to every Indu\n\u017ftriousand Skilful Ob\u017ferver, how the Four Sea\u017fons of the\n\u017ftar, viz. Winter, Summer, Spring, Authmm, * to be\n- - Qll!\n\f\"POST S C R IP T.\nfound,and fairly di\u017ftingui\u017fhed, even in a Lunar Revolution,\n(and in the\u017f\/inter Sea\u017fon too) according tothe Opinion of\nCicero, de Divin; Lib. 2. though not \u017fo palpably, I mu\u017ft\nconfe\u017fs, as inthe Solar; by rea\u017fon of the Moons velocity\nof Motion, and often largene\u017fs of the Shadow, and of the\nCold, which is Naturally and univer\u017fally then prevailing.\nVI. That the greate\u017ft \u017fhare of ColdWeather in Summer,\nor of Warmweather in Winter,(for \u017fuch Variety is plainly\nto be found almo\u017ft in every year; but in \u017fome mo\u017ft re\nmarkable) happens when the Moon, and Ruling Planets\nare po\u017fited in Winter or Summer Signs.\nVII. That the Planets or Lunations, or Conjunctions,\nor Oppo\u017fitions Regnant, happening in Azimene, Deep,\nPitted or Smoaky Degrees of the Signs they po\u017f\u017fe\u017fs, do\nirritate the mo\u017ft Unwhol\u017fome and Unhealthy Storms, and\nDisturbed weather. Pray ob\u017ferve a Famous proofhereof\nin the New Moon \u017fucceeding New-Tears-day la\u017ft, which\nwas Celebrated in \u017fuch Degrees; and at the \u017fame time\nMars being in Degrees Azimene, and Pitted, and the\nMoon pa\u017f\u017fing Aquarius, where almo\u017ft half the Sign con\n\u017fi\u017fts of \u017fuch like Degrees. And lo! What a continuant\nStorm for near three days and nightstogether, happen'd im:\nmediately after. Let us remember al\u017fo the Fogs that fell\non September, the 29th. and 30th. days; and on Decem\nber the 22d. and 23d, days, Anno 1682. And con\u017fider\nhow the Planets were then Po\u017fited. To the\u017fe we may\nju\u017ftly add the\u017feveral Foul Holes which Dr. Goad hath\u017fo\nhappily \u017fet up his Mark at. You may find which they are,\nby theSecond Part ofmy Ephemerides,Printed, Anno 1680.\nwhere (that \u017fo u\u017feful a Di\u017fcoverymight not be obliviated,\nwith the con\u017fent of that my Worthy Friend) I have in\u017fer.\nted them.\nVIII. That the Conjunctions, Oppo\u017fitions, and Luna\ntions, &c. of the Sun, Moon, and Planets fallingin Bright,\nLitcid and Fortunate Parts of Heaven, are commonly at.\ntended with Plea\u017fant Air, and very Salubrious Effe:#;\nbut \u017ftill with regard to the Sea\u017fon. Pray try the\u017fe things,\n3 tru\u017ft them as you find them true. I could produce\n\f\u201cPo STsc\u00ba 1'PT:\nFundry In\u017ftances of this Con\u017fpicuous Truth, both out of\nThis, and al\u017fo out of the Learned Keplers, Diary. But\nthat is needle\u017fs,\u017fince youmay di\u017fcover them here,even by\nINSPECTION, in a manner, without further trouble.\nIt being much ea\u017fier to prove the\u017fe things by In\u017fpection,\nthan the trouble\u017fome Calculations of the PlanetsPlaces,\nas \u017fome lately, with more Confidence than Truth, have\npre\u017fumed to do. . . -\nIX. That hereby is,taught and proved, that the latter\npart of Canceris the Hotte\u017ft part of the whole Heaven.\nAnd al\u017fo, that the la\u017ft week in May is generally inclined\nto Moi\u017fture. There are but three In\u017ftances in the whole\nDiary that oppo\u017fe it; andeven tho\u017feproducegreat Heats,\nwhich are the certain Prodromi, (if not the proper Pa.\nrents) of Moisture. And, for a clear Demon\u017ftration of\nthe Former,(be\u017fidesmany others) you may con\u017fult june\n1673. May 1675. September 1689. Augu\u017ft 1682. \u00a7u\nly, in the years 1684, 1686, 1688. I need not be more\nplain in a thing \u017fo obvious. In all your Exceptions to our\nRule, mu\u017ft adverti\u017fe youtoheed theprevailingcon\u017ftitution.\nX. That Planets near the AEquinoxes are of the mo\u017ft\nPowerful, and rarely failing Influences. And this the\nLearned Woffius, and mo\u017ft Naturalists, allow of A Fa\nmous Evidence whereof is the Month of AMarch, in its\nproving Windy, Turbulent, &c. to a Proverb. Chiefly,\nthe latter part thereof; the Sun being then in Aries, in\nOppo\u017fition to the Virgins Spike. Nor is it much different\nin September, when the Sun is in the Autumnale\/Equinox.\nNeither do the other Planets fail to irritate the \u017fame re\nmarkable Commotions or Turbulencies, when they al\u017fo in\ntheir Turns approach the 44ttinoxes. This is general.\nBut the Learned Goad goes further, and affirms that the\nWeather may be found, not only to a Week, and Day,\nbut timeof the Dayal\u017fo; For the Planet Mars (faith hey\nStrikes the Hour of the Day as well as the Clock. And this\nchiefly when in the AFauinoxes, &c.\nXI. Hence likewi\u017fe is plainly proved that the rear\nwhichaffords thefewe\u017ft Fro\u011fs in it,Exhibits to us, inthis\n- - * Cl\u00baz,\n\f\u201cPos Tsc R IP T.\nclimate,more than LXX.

The\u017fe filly Wretches forget,That\n3|aniocer, is 3free;21Bot by the #ire. But I am notfor\nControver\u017fy. - -\nxii is the Ea\u017ft wind (as the Learned Mr. R\u00ban\nob\u017ferves) do mo\u017ft commonly prevail in the Spring with\nus. But we find the West-winds more generally accom ||\npany us all the year; as the whole Diary mo\u017ft plainly |\naffirms in its Evidence.\nAnd is it thus in the Alterations of the Air, and Sea\u017fon:\nof the rear 2 Then certainly we \u017fhall find A\u017ftrology \u017fo\nfar from being an Inanity, or a Sonorous Nothing, asa\nmore witty, than wi\u017fe Antagoni\u017ft (viz. Dr. More) has\nbeen plea\u017fed toterm it; That we may rea\u017fonably affirm ||\nit will hold good in other matters, viz., even in Mundant :\nMutations: and mo\u017ft probably al\u017fo, in the va\nrious De\u017ftinies of Men. Yea, perhaps, in the common\nOeconomy of all Humane Concerns: Werewebut \u017fowi\u017fe\nand fortunate as to find out the My\u017ftery.
