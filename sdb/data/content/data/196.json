Her research has focused on remote viewing, associative remote viewing, ESP dreaming, precognition, and projects involving text-book analysis. She is the founder\/director of the International School of Clairvoyance and president of the International Remote Viewing Association (IRVA).

She holds a Master\u2019s degree in social work from the University of Utah. At UWG she catalogued Ingo Swann\u2019s Papers held at Ingram Library\u2019s Special Collections. She was awarded a visiting scholar\u2019s grant by the University of Illinois to study their Merten J. Mandeville Collection in Parapsychology and the Occult Sciences.\n\nKatz and her identical twin sister began experiencing episodes of paranormal activity and telepathy during childhood. These experiences encouraged her to pursue a meditation discipline, studying clairvoyance and energy healing. At this time, she was working as a United States probation officer.\n\nAfter a series of transpersonal experiences, she left this job to devote herself to her spiritual and intuitive work, travelling to the Philippines where she lived and studied with a variety of faith healers for a year. She returned to the US where she completed books on intuitive development.\n\nIn 2005 she founded The International School of Clairvoyance which was one of the first schools to offer intuitive development via tele-seminar and webinar. In 2019, she joined the board of directors of the International Remote Viewing Association (IRVA) and became its President in 2022.  Mainstream Research\n\nKatz\u2019s doctoral work was qualitative in nature and focused on the topic of Popular Psychology, examining whether derogatory attitudes about popular psychology books by academic psychologists were justified. Using formal case study methodology, she focused on books written about the psychological construct of attention, taking a social constructionist approach.  Remote Viewing  Microscopic Organisms\n\nA bacteriophage is a virus that destroys a bacterium by growing and dividing inside it. The viruses\u2019 ability to destroy multi-drug resistant bacteria offers possible benefits for medical technology, but they are difficult to observe without either being themselves destroyed or altered. In 2011 Katz, along with plant biologist Lance Beem, published a paper describing attempts to determine whether remote viewers could describe a bacteriophage in enough detail to provide useful information to scientists. In a double-blind test, forty remote viewers attempted to observe a phage in its natural environment within bacteria without being told the nature of the target Their transcripts were given to a virologist for rating: out of 153 items, 73 were rated as accurate.1  Variables\n\nWith James Lane, Katz investigated whether the background within which an object is positioned may impact the accuracy of remote viewing. Photographic images of physical objects are common targets in remote viewing projects today. Twelve experienced remote viewers each completed 30 remote viewing trials. Results indicated that targets with white backgrounds had a clear edge over other backgrounds (p = 0.005).2  Associative Remote Viewing\n\nAssociative Remote Viewing (ARV) is a psi-based methodology used to predict such things as sporting event outcomes and stock market moves. Katz and members of her remote viewing team paired up with Dale Graff to conduct a yearlong double-blind study which utilized dreaming within an associative remote viewing (ARV) protocol. Katz served as a dreamer along with five other members of the group. The overall hit rate of 17 out of 28 predictions was significant (p = 0.05). More impressively, the monetary gain was a little under 400 percent of the initial stake. Two of the dreamers had highly significant hit rates (13 hits, 4 misses and 16 hits, &nbsp;9 misses), suggesting that remote viewing talent is narrowly distributed.3  Rater Reliability and Scoring\n\nTo investigate the contributing factors in ARV success, Katz completed 86 trials, comprising 220 remote viewing transcripts. Three teams of judges working under blinded conditions repeated the process of judging, scoring and predicting sporting events, while keeping all other variables stable. Judges were only in complete agreement on six (6.9%) of 86 trials, while experienced judges obtained statistically significantly higher hit rates than those that were less experienced. The results indicate the need to develop more consistent and reliable judging protocols, preferably using experienced individuals.4&nbsp;  Project Firefly\n\nProject Firefly was an extensive project in which more than 60 remote viewers contributed 177 intuitive-based associative remote viewing (ARV) predictions over a 14-month period.\n\nUsing ARV predictions, project Firefly traded on the Foreign Exchange (FOREX) currency market. Investors pooled investment funds totaling $56,300 with the stated goal of \u2018creating wealth aggressively\u2019. However, most of the funds were lost over the course of the project. Katz was a remote viewer on this project. On its completion she and other project members formed a research team to examine the failures, providing lessons for future ARV research in both for-profit activities and basic research.5  Works  Books\n\nExtraordinary Psychic: Proven Techniques to Master Your Natural Abilities.
