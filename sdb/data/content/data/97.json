He studied mathematics and subsequently taught at Columbia University. He was appointed an associate editor of the Scientific American magazine in 1922, resigning in 1925 to take up an appointment as research officer for the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR).  Mina Crandon (\u2018Margery\u2019)\n\nIn 1922 Scientific American offered a prize of $2,500 to anyone who could convincingly exhibit an ability to produce a visible psychic manifestation. Bird was charged with choosing an applicant, and in November of the following year he selected Mina Crandon, a Boston woman reputed to produce strong physical mediumship phenomena under the pseudonym \u2018Margery\u2019. He also recruited a six-man judging committee, including himself. Some ninety investigative sittings were held, at which Bird was one of the most regular attendees.\n\nBird quickly emerged as one of Crandon\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters, publishing articles in the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research about the phenomena he said he witnessed during sittings. In 1925 he published a book about Crandon entitled Margery the Medium. A reviewer for the British Society for Psychical Research (SPR) commented that it contained \u2018an immense number of rather disconnected accounts of alleged supernormal events\u2019, but few clues about how reliable they were or, if genuine, the mechanisms by which they were produced.1\n\nAs the investigation progressed, Bird increasingly came into conflict with more sceptical committee members, notably the stage magician Harry Houdini, who published allegations of cheating by Crandon. Bird contested Houdini\u2019s claims and resigned from the committee, leaving Scientific American to work for the ASPR. The committee eventually declared that it was unpersuaded that Crandon\u2019s phenomena were genuine, and the prize remained unclaimed. Bird continued to attend sittings with Crandon, and as editor of the ASPR Journal published further laudatory articles about her, again arousing antagonism among more critical members. These included Walter Franklin Prince, one of the most sceptical of the original investigating committee, who resigned and set up a rival organization, the Boston Society for Psychical Research (BSPR).\n\nIn 1927, Bird himself became suspicious of Crandon at a sitting that took place on 15 July, where he and another sitter noticed a \u2018thread-like connection\u2019 attached to a cable on a weigh-scale.2 Disillusioned, Bird submitted a lengthy paper to the ASPR trustees, in which he admitted being aware of normal means being used to create the phenomena not only at the July sitting but several others, and stated that Crandon had even asked him once to produce a phenomenon in case she could not.3 In the paper, he wrote:  \n\nThis proposal was clearly the result of Margery\u2019s wrought-up state of mind. Nevertheless it seems to me of paramount importance, in that it shows her, fully conscious and fully normal, in a situation where she thought she might have to choose between fraud and a blank s\u00e9ance; and she was willing to choose fraud.4\n\nFearing for its reputation, the ASPR refused to publish the paper, and an anonymous blackmail letter was sent to Bird threatening to reveal his alleged dalliance with an \u2018immoral\u2019 woman if he did not keep quiet.5 Bird nonetheless offered the paper to the BSPR, which declined to publish it in the hope of ending the controversy, though Prince recounted the request from Crandon to Bird to produce a fake effect in an article published in Scientific American in 1933.6 The SPR also refused to print Bird\u2019s paper. Bird resigned from the ASPR In December 1930.7  Other Research\n\nBird was involved in the investigation of other spiritualist mediums, namely Ada Besinnet, John C Sloan, Gladys Osborne and William Hope. In My Psychic Adventures he made a case for the genuineness of some of the phenomena witnessed, while also taking into account the possibilities of hallucination, collective hypnosis and fraud.8\n\nBird abandoned psychical research after 1930 and little is known about his later activities.
