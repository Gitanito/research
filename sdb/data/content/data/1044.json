Only 3 issues appeared.\n\n  This was the exponent of Max Theon's Mouvement Cosmique\/Philosophie Cosmique in Bohemia, although neither Theon's name nor his pseudonym \"Aia Aziz\" appears.  The first issue provided a list of the principal points of the Cosmic Philosophy: that man's mission is to be a manifestation of God, that mortality and old age are unnatural and abnormal, a result of ignorance of man's true nature, and can be overcome by restoration of the \"original tradition,\" etc.  The journal is said by the Czech scholar Helena Capkova to have been largely translated from the French writings of the group, and also carried short, didactic fiction.  Peter Kalac, \"A Brief History of the Czech Esoteric Scene from the Late 19th Century to 1989,\" ww.dcch.grimoar.cz, notes that Maixner (1873-1937) was \"an unconventional Prague Hermetician, opponent of Freemasonry, writer, translator and publisher.\"  He came of an artistic family and early on moved in the occult world in Prague before the turn of the century, contributing to Sbornik pro Filosofii Mystiku a Okkultimus, and joining the Theosophical Society and the Martinists.  In the 1920s he wrote several books on occultism for the Sfinx Library he ran with Emanuel Hauner in Prague but is better known as the translator of Yogi Ramacharaka (William Walker Atkinson), Papus, Stanislas de Guaita, Josephin Peladan, and others, and also as the translator of Jack London and Rudyard Kipling.  In 1928 he became the first editor of Vlajka (the Flag), a Czech nationalist journal of somewhat suspect tendencies in the period before World War Two.\n\n       Issues:Kosmicke Rozhledy V1 N1 Nov 1907 Kosmicke Rozhledy V1 N1 Nov 1907 Version 2 Kosmicke Rozhledy V1 N2 Dec 1907 Kosmicke Rozhledy V1 N3 Mar 1908        <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/kosmicke_rozhledy","_id":1044}
