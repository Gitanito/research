In\nrelation especially to these latter cases, the limits of hypersesthesia and\nthe possibilities of acquiring knowledge unconsciously through the\nsenses would have to be considered. In the course of the investigation\nthe relation of the supposed clairvoyance to time would also be dis\ncussed.\nAs a first instalment of evidence she read three cases. In the first\ntwo, circumstances seemed to point clearly to agency on the part of\nthose whose surroundings were seen. In the last, knowledge was\nvoluntarily obtained by a hypnotised person about what was happening\nto persons known to him and known to the hypnotiser, but who were\nneither going through any crisis nor in conscious relation with the\npercipient.\nMiss Flintoff said that she had experienced a sort of clairvoyant\ndream ; some sailors carrying something which they laid at her feet,\nt t\n\f2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1891.\nand saying he said good-bye to her. She afterwards learnt that a\nmidshipman whom she knew, and who had said good-bye to her before\nstarting on his last voyage, had fallen from a mast and been killed\nabout that time.\nThe President said that this dream illustrated the importance of\ngetting a clear idea of what was meant by clairvoyance. There was no\nknowledge in the dream of the scene that actually occurred, so that,\nthough it might be telepathic, it could not be regarded as clairvoyant.\nProfessor Barrett gave some instances of clairvoyance, either\nwithin his own knowledge or learnt by him from the persons concerned.\nIn one of them a sick lady had heard from a distant room what the\ndoctor had said to her mother. Another was a case of a lad in a\nhypnotic trance apparently seeing a troopship, the Himalaya, coming into\nKingstown harbour, about the time that it really did do so. The third\nwas of a lady truly telling him what was the matter with a friend of\nhis, when he had no accurate knowledge himself on the subject. In\nthe fourth, information concerning a lost dog was given by a\nhypnotised lady, and he had himself investigated the accuracy of her\ndescription.\nMr. Barkwortii said that a definition would be helpful which\nshould first distinguish clairvoyance from telepathy, as treated in\nPhantasms of the Living, and again from thought-transference from\npersons present, and again from reading the far past or the future,\nwhich he was inclined to think should ba regarded as a different\nphenomenon. It seemed to him that cases where persons, being\nhypnotised or in sleep, becoma cognisant of things at a distance when\nno crisis is going on might be regarded as cases of one and the same\nperson being both agent and percipient. He described an instance in\nwhich a person mesmerised in Devonshire accurately described what\nwas going on in a house in India. He concluded by deploring the\ntendency that people had to keep strange facts of this kind to them\nselves, and urging that all who could should communicate them to the\nSociety.\nMr. Matthews discussed the possible extension of hyperesthesia.\nHe knew of a case where a lady, for several weeks after recovering from\nscarlet fever, could hear what was said four rooms off. He did not see\nwhy a line should be drawn between four rooms and four miles or four\nhundred miles, nor did he see why a distinction should be supposed to\nexist between extension of hearing and extension of sight.\nMr. Myers then, after a brief introduction, read an interesting\ncase of a vivid mental experience of a person apparently dying. Dr.\nWiltse, when thought by his friends to be dead and only by his\nmedical attendant perceived to be still breathing slightly, seemed to\n\fJan., 1891. Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 3\nhimself to go out of his body and to see what was going on in the\nroom and outside. To the surprise of all he recovered consciousness,\nand at once insisted on describing his experience. What he had\nthought he perceived was believed to be correct.\nMr. Victor Horsley, in connection with Dr. Wiltse's experience,\ndescribed some experiments he had made on himself when under the\ninfluence of nitrous oxide, originally with a view to explaining reflex\naction, but afterwards to observe the dream phenomena accompanying\nrecovery of consciousness. The first point he tried to observe was\nwhether simple mental operations were recovered before complex ones.\nHe would set himself to execute a complex action continuously, then\ntake the nitrous oxide and observe when the action left off and when it\nbegan again. For instance, he would write rows of the number 3.\nWriting the 3's one after the other in a single row he regarded as a\nsimple action. Writing the 3's alternately in one row and in another as\na more complex action. His hand would stop writing, and then begin\nagain writing 3's before complete consciousness returned, but it never\nbegan again the complex action of writing them in alternate rows.\nHe found that dreams which occur as consciousness returns are often\nvery vivid, but usually they will be completely forgotten unless by\nstanders make a point of asking the patient what he dreamt before he\nhas entirely recovered consciousness.\nDr. Wallace said he had bean assistant for many years to the late\nProfessor Laycock, and had recards of experimants o:i the action of\nthe mind under anaesthetics, which he should be glad to communicate\nto the Society.\nMr. Barkworth asked Mr. Horsley whether he noticed any marked\ndifference between his earlier and later experiments in his power of\ncarrying on complex mental actions when under the influence of\nnitrous oxide.\nMr. Horsley said that he acquired no additional accomplishment\nby practice.\nMr. Pearsall Smith gave an account of a young man dying of\nconsumption, sent to sea for tho bsnefit of his health. In the excite\nment of a storm the invalid was forgotten, and seemed to die. He\nthen perceived how tha officer responsible for him began to be worried\nabout him, and came down and found him dead. In his anxiety to\nsave the officer trouble, he made an effort, and came back to life.\nWhile in the state of coma he travelled through all his history, and\nseemed to know everything that had occurred, remembering things of\nearly life back to about the age of eight months.\nMr. Sheppard asked whether the circumstances perceived by Dr.\nWiltse were such as he could not have perceived in a normal manner.\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1S91.\nMe. Myers replied that the bystanders believed that the incidents\noccurred after his eyes were closed.\nMr. Harding mentioned a friend of his who could perceive what\nwas wrong with the human frame, e.g., he perceived that an arm had\nbeen broken ten years after it was all right again.\nMEETING OF THE AMERICAN BRANCH OF THE\nSOCIETY.\nAt the rooms of the Boston Society of Natural History, Tuesday,\nDecember 2nd, 1890, at 8 p.m. At least 250 persons present. The\nhall was not large enough to accommodate all who came to the meeting.\nProfessor William James in the chair.\nThe Secretary read the records of the previous meeting, which\nwere approved.\nThe Chairman stated that so far as concerned membership and the\ngeneral increase of interest in psychical research, the results, since the\ntransformation of the American Society into a Branch of the English\nSociety, had been highly satisfactory ; the roll of the Branch showed\nabout 440 members as compared with about 350 at the beginning of\nthe year. He requested further co-operation in obtaining replies to the\nquestion in Schedule A (Census of Hallucinations\u2014International Con\ngress of Experimental Psychology), to which he had already received\nbetween 4,000 and 5,000 replies. Of these about one-tenth were in\nthe affirmative, but the affirmative replies had not yet been classified in\ndetail. He said that not so many persons as formerly were joining the\nSociety through purely sensational considerations, that a deeper\nscientific interest was manifest, and that the members generally were\nrealising that patience and time were required in this branch, as in\nother branches of science, to attain reliable results. He pointed out\nthat the research of the Branch was seriously hampered by lack of\nfunds, and that many opportunities for experimental investigation\nand for immediate inquiries concerning phenomena, while they were\noccurring, had been missed for want of money to pay travelling ex\npenses, ifec. A slight addition to the funds might be made by increas\ning the dues. Whereas the Associates of the English Society paid\n5 dollars per annum, those of the American Branch paid only 3 dollars,\nand the larger part of this went to England for payment of Journals\nand Proceedings supplied to the members of the Branch. It might be\nadvisable to raise the assessment of Associates to 5 dollars. Unless\nmore money was forthcoming as donations also, the work could not be\nefficiently continued. He called for suggestions on these points from\nthe meeting.\n\fJan., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 5\nAfter brief discussion it was resolved, on the motion of Mr. \u00a5m.\nFearing Gill, of New York, that the secretary should issue a circular\nfor the purpose of ascertaining how many Associates would be willing\nto pay an annual assessment of 5 dollars.\nProfessor James then gave an account of a case of \"double\npersonality of the ambulatory type,\" the subject of which, Ansel\nBourne, was, at the time of his seizure (January 6th, 1887), an\nitinerant preacher, 61 years old, residing in Greene, R.I. One morn\ning, whilst apparently in his usual state of health, he disappeared, and\nin spite of the publicity which the newspapers gave to the fact, and\nthe efforts of the police to find him, he remained undiscovered for a\nperiod of two months, at the end of which time he \" woke up \" at\nNorristown, Pennsylvania, where for the previous six weeks he had been\nkeeping a small variety store, under the name of A. J. Brown, appear\ning to his neighbours and customers as a normal person, but being, as\nit would seem, in a somnambulistic condition all the while. Professor\nJames gave a sketch of Mr. Bourne's life, which presented at least one\nother incident of great interest, and went on to describe in detail\nhow he had conceived that Mr. Bourne, if hypnotised, might give a\nfull account of his strange absence, including the first two weeks, of\nwhich no account had ever been forthcoming. Mr. Bourne, in his\nnormal state, recollected nothing whatever between the time of his\ndisappearance from Rhode Island and his \" waking up \" in Norristown,\neight weeks afterwards. The result justified the expectation of Pro\nfessor James. Mr. Bourne was hypnotised repeatedly by Professor\nJames and Mr. Hodgson, and gave an account of his doings during his\neight weeks' absence, and verification has been obtained of some of the\nincidents which he described as having occurred before his arrival at\nNorristown. In the hypnotic trance he called himself A. J. Brown, and\nrecollected nothing later than going to sleep in the store at Norristown.\n[A full account of this case will, it is hoped, be given in the next Part\nof the Proceedings.]\nThe Secretary then read the report by Professor Lodge on sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper in England\u2014read previously at a meeting in London.\nThe meeting then adjourned. R. Hodgson.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nM. 15.\nThe following incident, communicated by Mr. C. C. Massey, seems\nanalogous to the experiences with Mrs. Piper described in the recently\nissued Part of the Proceedings :\u2014\nJanuary 18th, 1890.\nOn April 7th, 1883, died an old and dear friend of mine, by name Francis\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., isol\nPaynton Pigott-Carleton (his patronymic was Pigott\u2014ho took the name of\nCarleton on his marriage). On April 27th in the same year I took an\nold glove of his, given to me for the purpose by his widow, to Lottie Fowler,\nputting it into her hand when she went apparently into trance and was\n\"controlled,\" and requesting the \"control\" to get into rapport with the\nowner of the glove, and give me any particulars concerning that person.\nThe \"control\" gave me a description of the person of my friend which I\nthought remarkably good. I then asked for the name. She, or the\n\"control,\" seemed to listen for it, and then said, with apparent vexation,\n\" Oh, it is all nonsense, I can make nothing of it. I hear only ' Pig\u2014Pig\u2014\nthat is not a name; what do they (sic) mean by 'Pig' 1\" It is obvious\nthat the first syllable of the name \"Pigott\" is that which would be\naccentuated most strongly, and the sound dropping (we may suppose), the\nlatter half of the name would not be caught by an ear unfamiliar with it.\nI had given her not the slightest clue, except the glove, which was not\nmarked with the name, and she had never seen or heard of my friend, who\nlived in the country and was not interested in \"Spiritualism,\" and was quite\nunknown to \"mediums\" ; though his wife had on more than one occasion been\nwith me to stances. (Not, however, to Lottie Fowler, to the best of my\npresent memory and belief. ) And I had not mentioned my friend's death\namong my Spiritualistic friends, nor my intention to visit her to anyone who\nmight, intentionally or otherwise, prepare her. C. C. Massey.\nM. 16. Crystal Vision.\nThe following accounts, received through the American Branch,\nwere taken down by Mr. Hodgson and afterwards signed by the\nwitnesses. We think the case sufficiently interesting and suggestive\nto print, although owing to the refusal of the principal witness to\ngive any assistance, the evidence is very imperfect. In particular\nthe evidence respecting the letter from Germany, on which the\nquestion whether the vision was veridical or not depends, is at second\nhand, and we are unable to say what the time relation between that\nletter, or the incident related in it, and the vision was :\u2014\nAccount by Mrs. \u2014.\nBoston, April 6th, 1889.\nOn the morning of (some weeks previously), about 10.30, Miss Z. and\nMis3 Y. called upon me and said they wished to try some experiments with\na large Japanese crystal which I possess. It appeared that on the previous\nevening they had been talking with some other friends about crystal seeing,\nghost stories, &o., and they desired to make experiments.\nMiss Y. looked into the crystal for some time, and saw various scenes\nwhich had no special relevancy, so far as I know, to any actual event. I\nhad occasion to go out that morning, and left them before Miss Z. had\nbegun to experiment. On my return, towards one o'clock, I found them\nmuch excited over the visions which Miss Z. had seen in the crystal.\n\fJan., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.\nShe told me that after a short time a round spot of light had appeared\nin the crystal ; that this spot expanded, then became blurred, and finally\ncleared, when she saw a boat on some water containing a man and a woman.\nTheir faces were turned, so that she could not see them, but the woman\nmade some gesture as if bidding adieu. She said that the vision was like a\nreal scene\u2014the boat moved and the water glittered.\nThe scene became clouded over completely and then cleared again, when\nshe saw the outside of a church, the doors opening and the people entering.\nThis scene again was clouded over, and again cleared, when she saw the\nmside of a church. A procession carrying long candles, lighted, moved to\nwards the altar with a coffin. The lid of the coffin was lifted, and she saw\nthe face of a girl whose acquaintance she had made in Germany last year.\nShe was not a special friend of hers, but her acquaintance had been made at\nthe house of another friend in Germany.\nShe was very agitated over the vision ; said she was sure something had\nhappened.\nAbout a week later I met Mrs. Y., who asked me if I had heard the\naccount of the vision on the day when it was seen. I told her that I had.\nShe then informed me that Miss Z. had just received a letter from her\nfriond in Germany, at whose house she had met the lady whose body she\nsaw in the vision, containing the news that this very lady had been drowned in\nthe Lake of Geneva. She had been married and had gone with her husband to\nGeneva, and they had gone out rowing on the lake together. They did not\nreturn, and the next morning a search was made, when the boat was found\nupside down in the lake. Their bodies were recovered shortly afterwards.\nAccount by Miss Y.\nApril mh, 1889.\nAbout two months ago Miss Z. and myself called upon Mrs. for the\npurpose of looking into her crystal. I had had some conversation a day or\ntwo before about crystal seeing, and thought I should like to experiment\nwith one.\nWe took the crystal into a somewhat dark' room and placed it upon the\nsofa, and I placed my eyes close to the crystal ball, with a dark cloth over\nmy head so that external objects could not be reflected in the crystal.\nAfter looking for some time I saw three cards, two of which I distinguished\nas the eight of hearts and the king of hearts, the third was blurred. I also\nsaw two candles standing, one of which was burning, and the other was\nnot. This picture disappeared, and aftsr a short time I again saw three\ncards\u201410 of hearts and the king of hearts, and a'spade card. I also saw\ntwo candles lying down, both out.\nMiss Z. then looked into the crystal, and after some time had elapsed\nshe told me as follows :\u2014\nShe said that a light appeared at the bottom of the ball, which expanded\nand assumed a misty appearance. This gave place to a scene in which she\nsaw a sheet of water. A boat moved across the water. In the front of\nthe boat was a woman dressed in black, holding a light. She could not see\nthe face\u2014could see the white of the hand. In the other end of the boat\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1891.\nwas a man crouched down. The boat passed across the scene several times ;\nbut afterwards the woman appeared to ba alone in the boat.\nAfter this I looked into the crystal again, and saw the cards which I had\nseen at first, but nothing further.\nMiss Z. then looked again a long time, and finally gave an exclamation\nof surprise. She then told me that she had seen the boat again, that the\nscene had clouded over, and a film seemed to move backwards and forwards,\nfinally passing away, when she saw the exterior of a church, the door of\nwhich opened. The scene changed while she was looking at it, and she saw\nthe inside of the church. From a side door came some figures in black\nwhich formed in front of the altar. These were followed by six figures in\nwhite carrying a coffin, which they laid down in front of the altar. Bright\ndots appeared which became burning candles, which the figures were\nholding. The white figures then appeared to raise the coffin higher and\nhigher up towards the top of the church, as it were, their arms extending to\nan enormous length, and the coffin seemed to be brought just under her\nfacs. The lid of it slid away, and she saw a corpse draped in black, and the\nface was that of a girl whom she had known in Heidelberg, Germany.\nAfterwards she saw another scene, the figure of a woman kneeling down\nwith hands clasped. She was dressed in black, but she had white crape\nacross her forehead. A second figure was that of a man with his hand\nextended in a peculiar way ; and a third figure, also a man, dressed chiefly\nin light blue, with some other colour. The woman appeared to be kneeling\nto the man in blue. Miss Z. said she would not look in the crystal any\nmore.\nWe began to look at some books that were lying on the table, and in one\nwe took up were some old illuminated prints. One of the pictures was that\nof which she had just given me an exact description when she detailed the\nlast scene which appeared in the crystal, viz., the woman kneeling to the\nman in blue, with the third figure present with arm extended. We were\nboth much surprisod, and did not think so much of the first scenes which she\nhad witnessed in the crystal.\nBetween a week and a fortnight later, Miss Z. came in to tell me that she\nhad received a letter announcing the news of the death of the girl whose\ncorpse she had seen in the crystal \"vision.\" She told me that another\nfriend in Germany had written to her to say that this girl had been married,\nand had gone to Geneva on her wedding trip ; that she and her husband had\ngone out on the lake, and had not roturned ; that search was made the next\nday, and the boat was found upside down ; that their bodies wore afterwards\nrecovered.\nMrs. Y. writes : \u2014\nApril 2Qth, 1889.\nOn the day on which my daughter and Miss Z. visited Mrs. for the\npurpose of looking into the crystal, I heard the details of what they had seen\nin the crystal substantially as above narrated, and a week or two later I also\nheard of the verification.\nMr. Hodgson adds :\u2014\nMiss Z. declines to give any assistance in obtaining further evidence\n\fJan, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 9\nconcerning this case. She was made very \"nervous\" by it, and was said\nto have had a veridical psychical experience when she was only a few years\nold, which caused her family to object very strongly to her being associated\nwith anything \"psychical.\"\nL. 861. A* P\" Borderland. Visual.\nFrom Mr. J. H. Kennedy, through Professor Barrett.\nRepeated appearances of an apparition, as in this experience, seem\nto be very unusual.\n[Dublin], July 20th, 1889.\nOn the night of the 10th, or rather morning of 11th February, 1884,\nwhile sleeping on a bed formed by chairs in my dining-room, my wife having\nbeen confined the night previous, I was startled by a most remarkable\nvision.\nMy cousin, Miss Amy Flint, passed by the side of my bed several times\nfrom the foot, disappearing at the head, and carrying in her hand, with her\narm stretched out, a virgin's lamp. After she had passed several times I\nstarted up in bed, the thought having struck me that my wife had either\npassed away or had become seriously ill. I sat up in the bed in a state of\nfear and anxiety, not knowing what to do, fearing if I went up to the bedroom\nI might startle my wife and perhaps cause her death, and reasoning to\nmyself that if anything was wrong the nurse would certainly let me know.\nDuring all this time the figure continued to pass and repass with a solemn,\nsteady tread. Having watched and listened for some time, my cousin ceased\nto pass. I lay down, fell asleep, and thought no more of it, excepting to\ngo up and inquire about my wife and child early that morning. They were\nboth doing well, so I dismissed the thing from my mind, till about 10 o'clock,\nwhen my cousin's brother called to say his sister had passed away just at the\ntime of my vision. In consequence of this extraordinary occurrence I had\nthe infant called after her, Amy.\nI may say my cousin had been for a long time in consumption, but the\nday previous appeared much better, went out by herself in good spirits and\nvisited my sisters. J. H. Kennedy.\nMr. Kennedy does not seem to have mentioned his vision to anyone\nbefore he heard of his cousin's death, and his aunt, to whom he men\ntioned it some weeks afterwards, is dead.\nHe writes later to correct the date given in his first account,\nsaying that his daughter Amy was born on January 2nd, 1883, and that\nhis cousin died a few days later, on January 7th, and we have verified\nthese two dates independently by reference to the Register of Births\nand Deaths. The fact of his daughter being named after his cousin\nin consequence of the occurrence, as mentioned in his first letter, affords\nsome independent evidence of the correspondence in the dates of the\napparition and the death.\nMr. Kennedy states that he has experienced no other hallu\ncinations, but he recently had a dream of a distressing kind, which\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1891.\nmade a good deal of impression on him, and which there is some\nreason to think was telepathic. In an interview with Professor Barrett\nhe also related an exporience which occurred to his mother. This was\na veridical \" vision or dream \" of the sudden death of a friend, and is\nof interest as being an instance tending to show a hereditary faculty of\n\" second-sight.\"\nG. 198.\nMr. Myers writes:\u2014 October, 1890.\nThe four incidents which follow were written out for me in 1888\nby a lady whom I will term Mrs. V., who has had other experiences\nsomewhat similar, which, for private reasons, she does not wish to give.\nI am well acquainted with Mrs. V., and with her husband, who has\nheld an important position in India.\nI have been asked by Mr. Myers to describe several manifestations which\nI experienced between 1874 and 1885.\n(I.) In 1874 I was in India, at a hill station. On the 7th June, between one\nand three o'clock in the morning, I woke with the sensation that half my life\nhad been taken from me (I can only describe the feeling in this vague way).\nI sat up and pressed my side in wonder at what was happening. I then saw\nmost beautiful lights at the end of the room ; these lights gave place to a cloud,\nand after a few moments the face of a dear sister, then living (as I believed),\nappeared in the cloud, which remained a little while and then gradually\nfaded away. I became much alarmed and at once felt I should hear bad\nnews of my sister, who was living in London and had been very ill, though\nthe last accounts we had received had been better. I told my husband what\nhad happened, and when a telegram was brought by a friend at 8 o'clock that\nmorning I knew what its contents must be. The telegram contained the\nnews of my sister's death during the previous night.\n(II.) In 1885 I was present in church at the confirmation of my sister's\nyoungest boy. I was in the left-hand gallery of the church, the boy in the\nbody of the church, on the right side. As I was kneeling, I looked towards\nthe opposite gallery, which was of dark wood. There I saw the half figure of\nmy sister ; the head and arms outstretched high above the boy, as if blessing\nhim. For the moment I thought it was impossible and closed my eyes for a\nfew seconds. Opening them again I saw the same beautiful form, which\nalmost immediately vanished.\n(III.) In India, in the winter of 1881, the husband of an acquaintance was\nlying dangerously ill at an hotel about live miles from us. Knowing this, I\nwent frequently to inquire after him. One particular evening I remained with\nhis wife some time, as the doctor thought his condition most critical. When\nI returned home, about ten o'clock that night, I ordered beef essences and\njellies to be made to send early the next morning.\nThe night was perfectly calm and sultry, not a leaf stirring. About\ntwelve o'clock the venetians in my bedroom suddenly began to shake and\nknockings were heard, which seemed to proceed from a box under my\n\fJan., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 11\nwriting-table. The knocking and shaking of the venetians went on for half\nan hour or more, off and on.\nDuring this time I heard a name whispered, A B , of which the\nChristian name was unknown to me, the surname being the maiden name of\nthe sick man's wife. I felt so certain that I was wanted at the hotel that I\nwished to start at once, but I was advised not to do so at that hour of the\nnight. Early the next morning a messenger arrived with a note begging me\nto go at once to the hotel, as my friend's husband had died at one o'clock.\nWhen I reached the hotel, she told me how she had wished to send for me\nduring the night whilst his death was impending. I went at once to stay\nwith her till after the funeral, and found that the Christian name I had\nheard whispered was the name of her brother who had died seven years\npreviously.\n(IV. ) In 1884 we were staying in a villa in the South of France. One night,\nsoon after we arrived, I went from my room upstairs to fetch something in the\ndrawing-room (which was on the ground floor), and saw a slight figure going\ndown the stairs before me in a white garb with a blue sash and long golden hair.\nShe glided on into a room near the hall door. This startled and impressed\nme so much that I afterwards went to the house agent and asked if anyone\nhad lately died in that house with long golden hair. He replied that an\nAmerican lady, young, and slight, with golden hair, had died there a few\nmonths before\u2014in the very room into which I had seen the figure gliding.\nMr. Myers adds :\u2014\nI have talked over the cases with Mr. V., and noted his remarks.\nIn Case I. he remembers being told in the morning of Mrs. V.'s\nvision, though at this distance of time he cannot state whether the\ntelegram announcing the death had arrived before he was told.\nIn Case II. he was told at once of the incident.\nOn Case III. he has made and signed the following remarks :\u2014.\n\" This noise resembled the shaking of the lid of the tin box. I\ngot up and went to the box, which continued making the noise, to see\nif there were rats, but there were none. There were no rats in the\nhouse, and there was nothing in the box. A night-light was burning\nin the room. The rattling was continuous\u2014not like what a rat could\nproduce. It went on again after I had investigated it in vain. This\nincident was unique in my experience.\"\nMrs. V. added in conversation: \"The Christian name whispered was\nHenry. This brother was not an Indian official, and I had never heard\nof him.\" Mrs. V.'s acquaintance with the lady whose husband was\ndying was not an intimate one.\nIn Case IV. Mr. V. again informs me that he was told at once of\nthe incident. The name of the villa was La Barormc ; of the house-\nagent, Mr. Taylor.\nIt will be observed that the evidence in each of these four cases has\nmerits and defects of different kinds.\n\f12 Journal of Society fur Psychical Research. [Jan., isoi.\nIn Case I.\u2014Indian time being about 5 hours earlier than English\ntime\u2014it seems probable that the apparition was about 24 hours\nafter the death. But the case is too remote in time for us to form any\ncertain conclusion on such a point without further evidence.\nCase II. derives interest from being a sort of sequel to Case I., but\nis not in itself evidential. Mrs. V. herself believes that she has had\nno hallucinations which have not been in some sense veridical.\nCase III. is well-attested ; and it may be remembered that in Miss\nX.'s experiences, and elsewhere, we have had cases of rattling sounds\ncoinciding with deaths.\nIn Case IV. the points by which the figure is identified are some\nwhat scanty. We should be glad to know if there is any other account\nof a figure seen in this villa.\nF. W. H. M.\nL. 862. Dream.\nReceived through the American Branch.\nThe amount of correspondence between dream and fact' strongly\nsuggests a telepathic explanation, Mrs. Grant's husband or mother in\nlaw being the agent.\nFrom Mrs. S. M. Grant, St. Paul's-street, Longwood, Mass.\nI was spending the summer of 1866 in Pottersville, near Dublin, N.H.,\nwith my little boy. I had left at home my husband and my husband's\nmother, and had given into their charge a canary bird\u2014a long German\ncanary, eight years old\u2014and an English ivy. I was very fond of both.\nWithin a few days of the close of my visit, I dreamed that a strange cat\nhad got in and eaten my bird, and that my husband had bought another in\nits place and had paid five dollars for it. At the breakfast-table the next\nmorning I told my sister-in-law and her aunt of my dream, and said I\nshould write home and charge them to be more careful. I did write home\nin the course of the day, but, scorning the thought of relying on a dream,\nsaid nothing of it.\nUpon arriving at my house in Boston, a few days after, at about five o'clock\non a Saturday afternoon, I followed my husband's mother down into the\ndining-room. On the way down I caught sight of the bird and cage hanging\nin their accustomed place in the back parlour. In the dining-room I said,\n\" The bird and the ivy are all right? Do you know that I dreamed that\na cat had killed the bird and \"\u2014looking up into her face, \" It has,\" for I saw\nby her face it was true. She said, \" You go up and see the bird.\" I went\nup and saw that it was quite a different bird, a young one, and of quite\nanother shape. I returned to the dining-room and went on with the story\nof the dream, that my husband had bought another bird, paying five dollars\nfor it. She said, \"I believe you are a witch.\" Then she said, \" But it wasn't\nSusie \" (a black cat she had had many years). I said, \" I knew it was a\n\fJan., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 13\nhorrid great grey cat.\" (It was a Maltese cat that looked as if it had lain\ntoo near the fire and got singed yellow in spots, with a great head and jaw, as\nlow a type of cat as I ever saw. I had never seen such a cat.) \" But,\" she\nsaid, \"I don't know anything about the price of the bird, for it only came\nhome to-day. \"\nWhen my husband came home to tea and was told the story he laughed\nand said, \"Why didn't you say three dollars and a half, and just hit it?\"\nI said I didn't care anything about that, that was a small point.\nWithin a week after this, I was at my chamber window, when I saw the\nidentical cat of^my dream running along on the sheds. I called to my\nhusband's mother and said, \"Look, there's the cat that killed my bird.\"\nShe looked out and said it was, and that she had not seen the cat since till\nnow. a It seems that the day the bird was killed, as soon as she found the bird\ngone, she went out to look for Susie, thinking it must be she who had caught\nit. A neighbour seeing her looking about, asked what she was looking for,\nand when told, said, \"That cat on the fence has just run with a bird,\" and\nshe looked and saw this strange cat.\nWe did not think very much of this story, but I used to tell it from time\nto time, and on one occasion, a long time after, when I had told it, my\nhusband said, \"You might as well have the benefit of the whole of it, \u2014the\nbird cost five dollars.\"\n(' Stephen M.

Dobbie, of Adelaide, Associate of our Society, some of\nwhose accounts of clairvoyance obtained with hypnotised persons have\nbeen printed in the Journal, sends us descriptions from Australian\nnewspapers of dental operations rendered quite painless by mere\nsuggestion.\nThe patient was a young lady who had to have a number of stumps\nof teeth extracted, causing great pain, as for some reason she appears\nto have been unable to use the ordinary anaesthetics. Under these\ncircumstances her parents brought her to Mr. Dobbie to be hypnotised.\nHe did not at first succeed in inducing the hypnotic sleep, but the\ndifficulty was overcome after a few trials and anaesthesia produced.\nThe special interest of the present experiments, however, is that at\nthe time of the operations the patient was not hypnotised at all. Mr.\nDobbie hypnotised her two days beforehand, and told her while\nhypnotised that at a certain time she was to have five stumps extracted,\nand was to feel no nervousness and no pain or discomfort. The success\nof the suggestion was complete. The teeth were extracted, in the\npresence of a number of people, without any inconvenience to the\npatient, though the operation, owing to the difficulty of getting out one\nof the stumps, took about a quarter of an hour. A few days later two\nmore teeth were taken out under similar conditions, in the presence of\nseveral doctors, with equal success. On both of these occasions Mr.\nDobbie was present, though not doing anything to influence the patient\nat the time, but we understand that on a previous occasion she had\ngone to the dentist, after receiving the suggestion in the same way,\nwith her father only, and that the result had been equally satisfactory.\nOBITUARY.\nWe regret much to have to announce the death of Mr. S.

Readers\nof our Proceedings (Vol. IV.) will not have forgotten the important\nwork done by Mr. Davey for the Society in demonstrating the extent\nto which educated and intelligent people may fail to observe the details\nof what occurred when supposed marvels are exhibited before them, and\nthe extent to which they may consequently mis-report them. The\nseries of experiments, establishing this conclusion which Mr. Davey\nand Mr. Hodgson conducted, are hardly likely to be performed again\nwith the same thoroughness, and no one who is seriously concerned in\nthe discovery of truth in this difficult inquiry can afford to neglect the\ninstruction contained in them,\n\fNo. LXXVIL\u2014Vol. V.

In laying it before the Meet\ning the Chairman read a letter from the auditor, in which he said, \" I\nhave audited your accounts for 1890, and have pleasure in again\ntestifying to their system, and the accuracy with which Mr. Bennett\nhas kept them.\" The Chairman drew attention to the state of the\nSociety's finances, which, though satisfactory twelve months ago, had\nimproved during the year. A statement of current assets and liabilities\nat the close of 1890 showed a small excess of the latter, to the amount\naof about \u00a320, due to the unexpected size and cost of Part XVII. of the\nProceedings.

It gave an account of further cases\nof clairvoyance, in which what was perceived, being known to some\ndistant person, might conceivably have been learnt telepathically.\nMr. H. B. Smith then read a translation of a paper by Monsieur\nMarillier on some recent apparitions of the Virgin Mary in a\nrural parish in France, which had been investigated on the spot by\nthe writer.

Mr. Kirk was himself the agent, and a friend\nof his, Miss G., was the percipient.\nMiss G. has once had an apparently veridical auditory hallucination,1\nbut, so far as she remembers, no other spontaneous hallucinations\nof any kind.\n1 This experience was as follows ;\u2014\nA cousin of Miss G.'s, \"Mrs. 0., had a baby, which, after an illness of a few\ndays, died about 2 a.m. on November 17th, 1872. Miss 6. had visited the family\nalmost daily during the illness, and was present the evening before the death, had\nnursed the child to relieve the mother, and returned home, not thinking the end was\nnear. Between 12.30 and 1 o'clock she was suddenly awakened by a voice, which she\nat once plainly recognised as that of Mrs. C, exclaiming, 'Jack, Jack, Jack !' So\ndistinct were the words and tone of voice that Miss G., greatly astonished, sat up in\nbed, rubbing her eyes and looking about her room to convince herself that she was\nreally awake.\n\"Mrs. C, shortly before the hour mentioned, being much exhausted with nursing,\nhad lain on the bed, the baby meanwhile being entrusted to the care of the husband.\nSuddenly, Mrs. C. awoke with the impression that the baby was dying, and in her\nalarm sprang out of bed, exclaiming to her husband, ' Oh, Jack, Jack, Jack, you are\nletting the baby die ! '\n\" Mrs. C, at this distance of time, does not remember that she was dreaming of\nMiss G., or that the latter was in any way mixed up with the impression that the\nbaby was dying.\"\nThe above account was written out by Mr. Kirk, after hearing Mrs. O.'s account,\nand the following confirmation is signed by Mrs. C. :\u2014\n\" I certify that the above account is correct, that I distinctly remembered the\ncircumstances, and recalled them voluntarily to Miss G. 's recollection. \"\nMrs. C. adds that her husband also clearly remembers the circumstance.\nMiss G. says :\u2014\n\"I well remember visiting the family during the illness of the baby, and the part\nI took in sympathising with Mrs. C. and helping to nurse the child, but hearing the\nvoice had quite escaped my memory until recalled to it by Mrs. C.\"\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., isoi.\nMr. Kirk wrote on May 29th, 1890 :\u2014\n(1) Four years ago, when I began the study of telepathic phenomena, I\nmade an experiment in impressing a lady who resided not quite half a mile\ndistant. The lady in question is Miss G. She once told my wife and\nmyself that she always sleeps with her head muffled in the bedclothes, and at\nthe moment it occurred to me to try a hallucinatory experiment on her. I\ndetermined to enter her bedroom and pull the clothes from her face, but as\nI received no intimation from her that anything had happened to her I\ndecided that I had failed.\n(2) I did not try again at that time [on account of illness but] about three\nmonths ago I again tried a similar experiment, seemingly without effect.\nBut since Miss G. mentioned to me the telepathic incident between her\nself and Mrs. C. she has told me, voluntarily, of two curious things that\nshe had experienced, but .which she had not mentioned to anyone. These\ntwo incidents proved to be the success of my two experiments!\nOn the first occasion she was awakened by feeling the bedclothes being\npulled away from her face. She felt the action as though it were being\nphysically done, but was too frightened to open her eyes, having the sensa\ntion that there was a presence near her bed. Presently the feeling of fright,\nor uneasiness, passed, and after a time she went to sleep.\nOn the second occasion (in her own house) the same performance was\nenacted, but this time it was not accompanied with fear, as she opened her\neyes and looked steadily around to see if anyone had entered her room.\nThere was no presence visible, however, and she quickly went to sleep. She\nhad not even a suspicion that it was I who had been subjecting her to\nexperiments. She had simply considered them very strange incidents, and\nwas much puzzled over their occurrence.\n(3) I have twice since succeeded in impressing her.1 The first time was\nabout three weeks ago (about the beginning of May), and the second on\nSunday night, the 11th inst. On the first occasion she had a distinct feeling\nthat I was standing by her bedside and the presence was so palpable (though\nunseen) that she felt the pressure on the bedstead. Miss G. describes this\npressure and presence as like those one feels when someone is leaning on the\nback of an easy-chair in which you are sitting.\n(4) The second impression was very rapid and realistic in its action.\nOn the Sunday night mentioned I was reading (not for the first time) Mr.\nMyers's introductory remarks to his paper \"On Recognised Apparitions\nOccurring more than a Year after Death.\" About 11.30 I began to feel tired,\nsuddenly threw myself on the couch, and immediately imagined myself\nwalking up the road where Miss G. resides and, without pause, opened the\nfront gate, passed in, and went bodily (so to speak) through the front door,\nquickly mounted the series of stairs to her bedroom door, which I opened\n(though locked) with great energy and noise. I did not, however, stay a\nsecond, as I was too mentally tired to continue the experiment.\nIt was not until the following Saturday (we see her nearly every day) that\nMiss G. suddenly asked me, \"Did you try an experiment on me on Sunday\n1 Mr. Kirk cannot say whether any unsuccessful attempts were made during this\nperiod.\n\fFeb., i89i.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 28\nnight last V \" Why do you ask V \" Because, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I\nheard my bedroom door opened with a bang. I seemed to see the door\nopened at the same moment. \" J\nMr. Kirk wrote again on July 7th, 1890 :\u2014\n(5) I have to inform you that from the 10th to 20th June I tried a telepathic\nexperiment each night upon Miss G. I did so, as suggested by you in\nyour letter of June 3rd, without her knowledge, as a preliminary to entering\nupon experiments with her under conditions of expectancy and the recording\nof dates and hours. Each trial had for its object the rendering myself visible\nto her\u2014simply visible. With the exception of one\u2014which was made one\nafternoon from my office in the Arsenal\u2014each trial took place at my house\nbetween the hours of 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.\nUp to June 23rd I heard nothing direct from my \"subject.\" Indirectly,\nhowever, I learnt that my influence was acting rather strongly. Each time\nMiss G. came to my house, while the experiments were in progress, she\ncomplained of being kept sleepless and restless from an uneasy feeling which\nshe was unable to describe or account for. On one night, so strong was thin\nuneasy feeling, she was compelled to get up, dress herself, and take to some\nneedlework, and was unable to throw off the sensation and return to bed\nuntil 2 o'clock. I made no comments on these complaints\u2014never dropped\na hint, even, as to what I was doing. Under these circumstances it seemed\nprobable to me that, although my influence was telling upon her, to her dis\ncomfort, I had not succeeded in the object of my experiments. Supposing\nthis to be the case, and that I was only depriving her of rest, I thought it\nbest to discontinue the trials for a time.\nI felt disappointed at this apparently barren result. But, on June 23rd,\nan agreeable surprise was sprung upon me, in that I learnt I had most\neffectually succeeded on one occasion\u2014the very occasion on which I had\nconsidered success as being highly improbable\u2014in presenting myself to Miss\nG. As you will find in her statement, herewith enclosed, the vision was\nmost complete and realistic. The trial which had this fortunate result was\nthat I had made from my office and on the spur of the moment. I had been\nrather closely engaged on some auditing work, which had tired me, and as\nnear as lean remember the time was between 3.30 and 4 p.m., that I laid\ndown my pencil, stretched myself, and in the act of doing the latter I was\nseized with the impulse to make a trial on Miss G. I did not, of course,\nknow where she was at the moment, but, with a flash, as it were, I transferred\nmyself to her bedroom. I cannot say why I thought of that spot, unless it\nwas that I did so because my first experiment had been made there.2 As it\nhappened, it was what I must call a \" lucky shot,\" for I caught her at the\nmoment she was lightly sleeping in her chair\u2014a condition which seems to\nbe peculiarly favourable to receiving and externalising telepathic messages.\nThe personal appearance of the apparition is of considerable interest, and\nis important in that it affords direct proof that an agent, when experimenting,\ni This is not quito accurate. See percipient's letter, p. 29.\n\" The first experiment was on the night of the 10th, the successful experiment on\nthe afternoon of June iith (Wednesday). Mr. Kirk tells us that he made a note at\nthe time on his blotting-paper, of day and hour.\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.. [Feb., 1891.\nis, in some undefinable way, conscious of his outward aspect. Thus, the figure\nseen by Miss G. was clothed in a suit I was at the moment wearing, and was\nbareheaded, the latter as would be the case, of course, in an office. This\nsuit is of a dark reddish-brown check stuff, and it was an unusual circumstance\nfor me to have had on the coat at the time, as I wear, as a rule, an office coat\nof light material. But this office coat I had, a day or so before, sent to a\ntailor to be repaired, and I had, therefore, to keep on that belonging to the\ndark suit.\nI tested the reality of the vision by this dark suit. I asked, \" How was\nI dressed 1 \" (not at all a leading question). The reply of Miss G. was,\ntouching the sleeve of the coat I was then wearing (of a light suit), \"Not this\ncoat, but that dark suit you wear sometimes. I even saw clearly the small\ncheck pattern of it ; and I saw your features as plainly as though you had\nbeen bodily present. I covld not have seen you more distinctly.\"\nMiss G.'s account of this is :\u2014\nJune 28tfi, 1890.\nA peculiar occurrence happened to me on the Wednesday of the week\nbefore last. In the afternoon (being tired by a morning walk), while sitting\nin an easy-chair near the window of my own room, I fell asleep,. At any\ntime I happen to sleep during the day (which is but seldom) I invariably\nawake with tired uncomfortable sensations, which take some little time to pass\noff ; but that afternoon, on the contrary, I was suddenly quite wide awake,\nseeing Mr. Kirk standing near my chair, dressed in a dark brown coat, which\nI had frequently seen him wear. His back was towards the window, his right\nhand towards me ; he passed across the room towards the door, which is\nopposite the window, the space between being 15ft., the furniture so\narranged to leave just that centre clear ; but when he got about 4ft from the\ndoor, which was closed, he disappeared.\nMy first thought was, \" had this happened a few hours later I should\nhave believed it telepathic,\" for I knew Mr. Kirk had tried experimenting\nat different times, but had no idea he was doing so recently. Although I\nhave been much interested by his conversation about psychical phenomena\nat various times during the past year, I must confess the element of doubt\nwmdd very forcibly present itself as to whether telepathic communication\ncould be really a fact ; and I then thought, knowing he must be at the office\nat the time I saw him (which was quite as distinctly as if he had been really\nin the room), that in this instance, at least, it must be purely imaginary, and\nfeeling so sure it was only fancy, resolved not to mention it, and did not do\nso until this week, when, almost involuntarily, I told him all about it. Much\nto my astonishment, Mr. Kirk was very pleased with the account, and asked\nme to write it, telling me that on that afternoon, feeling rather tired, he put\ndown his pen for a few moments, and, to use his own words, \" threw himself\ninto this room.\" He also told me he had purposely avoided this subject in\nmy presence lately, that he might not influence me,but was anxiously hoping\nI would introduce it.\nI feel sure I had not been dreaming of him, and cannot remember that\nanything had happened to cause me even to think of him that afternoon\nbefore falling asleep.\n\fKeb., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 25\nMr. Kirk wrote on August 1st, 1890 :\u2014\nSince my last communication to you, I regret to say I have been so unwell\nthat I have not been able to keep up a systematic course of experiments on\nMiss G. Of the attempts I did make, only one proved to be a decided\nsuccess, and that I now proceed to describe.\nl6) On the night of July 10th I resolved that Miss G. should see a\npart of the room in which I was, and which came within the front range of\nmy vision. While studying, or reading, I usually draw a couch close to my\ntable, on one end of which I place a lamp with a large cardboard shade.\nThe latter keeps the upper part of the room in shadow, but not so deep that\nI cannot distinctly see every article in the room. I began at 11.30, but\nquickly found that, although I endeavoured to focus the various articles of\nfurniture, &c., immediately in front of my gaze, in a kind of bird's-eye view,\nthe lamp obtruded itself as the most conspicuous object. From the reclining\nposition I take on the couch, the brightly illumined white inner rim of the\nshade that is farthest from me is always visible without there being any\nnecessity for turning my eyes on the shade. Z7uts, during the first part of the\nexperiment the lamp was obtrusicely prominent. Try as I would, I could not\nmake its bright light blend with its surroundings. The diameter of the Shade,\nat its widest part, is a trifle over 13 inches. This part of the experiment\noccupied from 11.30 to 11.45.\nAt 11.45 I became tired of the persistent obtrusiveness of the bright\nlight of the lamp, and held up my right hand between it and my eyes. The\nrelief was immediate, and the objects I wished to see stood out clearly,\nthough still in shadow.\nPercipient's Account :\u2014\nJuly 11th, 1890.\nLast night, about 11.35, having been in bed only a few minutes, I was\nstartled by seeing at the end of the room, near my bed, a bright streak about\nten or twelve inches in length. 1 immediately raised myself on my left elbow\nand watched it for about half a minute (it may have been rather less). It had\nthe appearance of a reflection with a deep shadow above.\nKnowing Mr. Kirk intended trying telepathic experiments from time to\ntime, I wondered whether it could proceed from that, but it appeared so real\nthat I got up to see if it were caused by a light shining through the window.\nHowever, it was not moonlight, the venetian blinds were down, and the\nstreet gas-lamps are too far aboce and below the house to throw a light on the\nwall opposite the window ; so I concluded it must be telepathic. After lying\ndown again, I did not see it, but for the next few minutes saw several\nmomentary glimpses of a dimly-lighted room, or perhaps I had better say\nlarge patches of shadow and not very bright light.\nMr. Kirk continues later in August :\u2014\n(7) I have to record another successful experiment with Miss G., which,\nin my opinion, conclusively demonstrates the arbitrary power of a strong\nlight.\nOn Sunday, the 3rd inst., I intimated to Miss G. that I should probably\nmake an experiment on her in object-transference that night. I ascertained\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1891.\nfrom her that she would most likely retire about 11 o'clock, and at that\nhour I began operations. In the window recess of my room stands a small\noctagon-shaped table, with flowers in pots. Against these pots I placed a\nrectangular piece of white-faced cardboard (17in. by 12in.), on which are the\nletters \" C A \" in black chalk. (You have heard of this cardboard in former\nexperiments.) [See experiments with other percipients described below.]\nAt starting, I used the bull's-eye lantern. With the exception of the light\nthrown by the latter, the room was in complete darkness. The lantern I\nstood on the end of the dining-table, facing the cardboard, the distance being\nabout two yards. The cardboard and letters were clearly defined. After a\nshort gaze, the board and letters became, as usual, blurred ; my eyes became\nunsteady, while the black letters ran into each other, and danced and whirled\nabout like fiery clouds, and I had to blink my eyelids with great rapidity to\ncatch even momentary glimpses of the black outlines of the letters. This\nhad lasted about five minutes when the light of the lantern suddenly\ncollapsed and I had to suspend the operation to raise the wick with a pin.\nThis done I began again, but getting only the same effect of fiery clouds.\nAfter two or three minutes the lantern went quite out and then I turned up\nthe light of my lamp for a third trial\u2014same effect of fiery clouds. In a\nfew minutes the lamp also collapsed, the servant having forgotten to\nrenew the oil. I then lit a candle (note this specially), and began a fourth\ntrial. Though the light was not so glaring as the bull's-eye lantern and that\nof the lamp, the effect was the same\u2014fiery clouds\u2014probably due to my eyes\nbeing tired, and the glare of the clouds being impressed on the retina from\nthe former trials. Presently I put out the candle, and lit the gas\u2014same\neffect of fiery clouds. To the end of the experiments I alternately tried\nboth the candle and gas.\nPercipient's Account :\u2014\nAugwt 1th, 1890.\nLast night, at 11.5, a few minutes after lying down, I saw a luminous\nappearance in the room, which soon settled into the form of a square or,\nrather, oblong. I at once thought, \"I am now going to see one of the pictures\nin Mr. K.'s dining-room,\" but was disappointed, the only change which\noccurred was a wavy, cloud-like movement within the square. Twice during\nthe time (about 20 minutes) which it remained more or less visible I very\ndistinctly saw a small, bright flame as of a candle burning, a short distance\nfrom the square. Before lying down I had darkened the window as much\nas possible, to exclude the light of the moon, which was shining full upon it,\nas I thought it probable Mr. K. would try an experiment during the evening.\nAt a later date Mr. Kirk continues :\u2014\n(8) This experiment was made on Miss G. whilst she was staying at Ilfra-\ncombe, about 230 miles from here by rail. It was arranged that I should make\none trial on the night of the second Sunday of her stay at Ilfracombe, time\n11 o'clock. I decided to transfer a disc of light, in the hope that it would\nappear as a full moon. I prepared for this by cutting a circular piece, six\ninches in diameter, out of a sheet of stiff black paper ; the frame of the paper\nI fastened over the rectangular cardboard, already mentioned, having first care\n\fFeb., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 27\nfully prepared the surface with white chalk. This produced a disc of clear white\nness. I then placed the object in the bay window of my dining-room, standing\nit against the venetian blind, behind two white window-curtains, which occupy\nthe central part of the bay. Two other white curtains hang in the bay,\none on each side, making four curtains. I now concentrated on the white\ndisc the light from two bull's-eye lanterns. These stood on a small table,\nabout twelve inches from the disc, the effect on the eyes being almost pain\nfully bright. The reflection from the disc illumined every part of the room\nas though it had been coated with luminous paint. The two curtains in\nthe centre of the bay were, especially, clearly defined. Though the latter,\nof course, came within the range of my vision, they did not enter into\nit as objects to be transferred. My attention was solely directed to the\ntransfer of the brilliant disc. At the time appointed I put out my lamp\nand began the trial.\nFrom the latter part of the report [by percipient, see below] it will be\nnoticed that, on two nights on which I had experimented on Miss G.,\nwithout her knowledge, I had succeeded in causing a manifestation. These\nare the only occasions, however, on which I have succeeded.\n[In answer to our inquiries we learn that Mr. Kirk made an attempt on\nevery night\u201413 or 14\u2014of Miss G. 's stay at Ilfracombe, but he afterwards\nfound that on several of these occasions she had not yet retired to her room . ]\nPercipient's Account :\u2014\nIlfracombe, August 18th, 1890.\nAlmost immediately on lying down last night, a few minutes after eleven,\nwith my face towards the wall, I saw a very bright reflection as if a strong\nlight were shining through a bay window and clearly showing the light and\nshade of hanging curtains. Although I expected Mr. K. to experiment, this\nwas so bright and sudden that I raised myself in the bed to see if any\nlight could possibly be coming through the window of my room ; but it\ncertainly did not. My bedroom is on the second floor ; the window flat and\nrather small, so, as the night was dark, I could only just discern it. Being\nSunday the street (High-street) was much darker and quieter than usual.\nLying down again I still saw it, thinking, \"What can he be trying to\ntransfer ? \" But it was only for a very short time ; being tired, I quickly fell\nasleep.\nAugust 19th.\nThis morning I received a note from Mr. K., asking me to make a\nmemorandum of any manifestations, and saying he had not confined his\nexperiments to Sunday night. This reminds me that on two nights during\nthe previous week I saw faint, cloudy lights, but would not notice them,\nunderstanding that Mr. K. did not intend experimenting during the first\nweek of my visit here.\nMr. Kirk continues :\u2014\nSince the experiments at Ilfracombe I have tried to transfer coloured\ndiscs to Miss G., but the results were very indefinite, if not entire failures.\nI may add that Miss G. has, on several occasions lately, tried me as a\npercipient, but I have proved myself almost quite unimpressionable.\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1891.\n(9) I will now record a final experiment, and one that was not only success\nful but exceedingly beautiful. I was determined, if possible, to make Miss\nG. see a full moon, and I set up the usual white disc, with a small circular patch\nof dark blue paper in the centre of it. As the light I threw on the discs in\nthe previous experiments seemed too strong for the purpose, I used a milder\nlight, by placing the lantern at a considerable distance away from the disc.\nMiss G. 's verbal description to me is that the luminous clouds (caused by\nthe small circular patch in centre of disc) would expand and pass away,\nand then gradually the whole would return and settle into a luminous disc ;\nthat then the disc would expand and pass away, the process being several\ntimes repeated. It was, she says, more like dissolving views than anything\nelse. And that is exactly what they were ; for I designedly, every few\nseconds, slowly closed and opened my eyes, the appearance of the vanishmg\ndisc and its reappearance presenting to me the phenomenon of a dissolving\nview with each movement of my eyelids.\nPercipient's Account :\u2014\nSeptember 29th, 1890.\nAbout 11.15, saw luminous clouds, which several times concentrated into\na bright disc about seven inches across. The circular form was only momen\ntary, but reappeared several times, lasting altogether about five minutes.\nMr. Kirk continues :\u2014\nI have now to declare that, during these experiments Miss G. has not\nhad, beforehand, the slightest idea of what I intended to transfer.\nI may add that Miss G. and myself are quite alive to the danger of\nmistaking \" floating lights \" before the eyes, common to most persons, for\nthe real things seen. I am particularly subject to these floating lights, and\nit is for this reason, when Miss G. has tried me as a percipient, I have taken\nwhat I saw as failures. But this is not so with Miss G. Excepting when she\nmakes a decided pressure on her eyeballs, she is entirely free from such lights.\nBesides, even under pressure of the eyeballs, I have never yet heard of any\none who has seen perfect squares and discs. The precautions I have taken in\nthis matter preclude the possibility of any mistakes having been made.\nI may conclude by telling you that I have only succeeded once in making\nmyself visible to Miss G. since the occasion I have already reported, and that\nhad the singularity of being only my features\u2014my face in miniature, that\nis, about three inches in diameter.\nIn a letter dated January 19th, 1891, Mr. Kirk says as to this last\nappearance :\u2014\nMiss G. did not record this at the time, as she attached no importance to\nit, but I noted the date (July 23rd) on my office blotting-pad, as it was at\nthe office I was thinking of her. I say \" thinking,\" because I was doing so\nin connection with another subject, and with no purpose of making an\nexperiment. I had a headache, and was resting my head on my left hand.\nSuddenly it occurred to me that my thinking about her might probably in\nfluence her in some way, and I made the note I have mentioned. x\n1 Mr. Kirk enclosed the piece of blotting-paper with the note.\n\fFeb., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 29\nThis is an instance in which a visible result followed in the absence of an\nexperiment by intent. I may mention that Miss G. was seated in the same\nchair and in the same spot as when she had her first vision of me.\nThe following letter from Miss G. adds some important points to\nthe evidence :\u2014\nJanuary 16th, 1891.\nDear Mr. Kirk,\u2014Reading the proof as you requested, I find you have\nmade a slight error in recording the account numbered \"4.\" You say, \"I\nheard the door opened with a bang.\" You have evidently misunderstood me.\nI quite distinctly remember the impression. I was lying with my face muffled\nin the clothes (a very frequent habit of mine), when I suddenly saw a door\nvery quickly opened, and seemed to get a momentary glimpse of the space\nbeyond. In telling you about it, most probably I said it opened as if with a\nbang, to make you understand how rapidly it all occurred.\nIn Cases 1, 2, and 3 I do not remember the dates, as at that time I had\nno idea you were trying experiments on me, and I only kept the impressions\nin mind from their being so strangely realistic.\nOf account \" 5 \" I made no memo until you asked me to do so, but I feel\ncertain the date given by you is correct, as the incident made so deep an\nimpression on me, being so remarkable an experience that it was constantly\nrecurring to my mind, and I could not have made any mistake about the\ntime. I fully endorse all your other accounts, and may just ask you to tell\nProfessor Sidgwick that I never had the faintest idea of what you intended\ntrying to transfer, whether the time for doing so was arranged or otherwise.\nIn sending the proof of above to Mr. Kirk for his revision we asked\nhim several questions as to (a) how the correspondence of dates was\nascertained ; (b) the number of unsuccessful attempts to impress Miss\nG. which he had made ; and (c) whether written records had been\nmade by himself and Miss G. before comparing notes.\nAs regards (a), the dates of experiments 1, 2, and 3 are known\nonly approximately, and their coincidence is assumed on the ground of\nthe close correspondence between the kind and number of the impres\nsions which it was attempted to produce and those experienced. The\nevidence as to coincidence in the remaining cases appears from the\nnarrative and from Miss G.'s letter.\nAs regards (6), Mr. Kirk has not recorded all his experiments and\ncannot in all cases say how many failures may have occurred. He has\nrecords of seven failures which seem to have occurred in July (see\nexperiment 6). These were all connected with attempts to render him\nself visible to, or make auditory impressions on Miss G. He distinctly\nremembers one, and only one, failure of which he did not make a\nmemorandum. Further information is given in the narrative and\nfootnotes.\nAs regards (c), he says that Miss G. did not always write her\naccount of her impressions until after they had talked them over\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1891.\ntogether (nor\u2014as will have been observed\u2014did he do so himself), but\nthat in these conversations he has always been very careful to put no\nleading questions, and to draw out all that she had to say before telling\nher what impression he had tried to produce.\nMr. Kirk has also sent us a record of another series of experiments in\nthought-transference of objects\u2014or, as he prefers to call it in such\ncases, \" object-transference.\"\nThese experiments were carried on with other percipients than Miss\nG., in February, 1890, and appear to have been very carefully planned\nand recorded, and it seems that all due precautions were taken in carry\ning them out, but he was, unfortunately, not able to make a large\nnumber of them. A certain amount of success was obtained, especially\nwith a lady as percipient who has had some spontaneous hallucinations,\nseemingly veridical, and has seen an apparition in a \" haunted house.\"\nMr. Kirk has experimented especially in the transference of light, with\nsome interesting results. In two instances when the diagram to be\ntransferred was hung up on a black board in a dark room and\nilluminated by a bull's-eye lantern, which threw an oval light on the\npaper, an oval light was seen and not the diagram. It appeared in\nother cases, too, that the parts of the object that were most strongly\nilluminated were seen most clearly by the percipient. In one experi\nment, when some black letters\u2014C A\u2014on a white ground were looked\nat by the light of the bull's-eye lantern and the light did not cover both\nletters, the A being partially in shadow, the result was that only\nthe form of the C was transferred, described as a \"semi-circle,\" which\nappeared luminous to the percipient.\nMr. Kirk thought that the objects were more or less distinctly\nseen by the percipient according to the steadiness or unsteadiness of\nthe agent's gaze. Thus, when a gold watch was looked at by three\nagents, the percipient saw a circle of white light surrounded by a sort\nof zigzag penumbra, the indistinctness of outline being, perhaps,\nthe result of the watch appsaring blurred to the agents after they had\nlooked at it for some time.\nMr. Kirk hopes that this account of his experiments may lead\nMembers of the Society to make similar ones \u2014a hope in which we\ncordially concur.\n\fFeb, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 31\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nJanuary 5th, 1891.\nDear Sir, \u2014As comment is invited on matter appearing in our Journal\nI crave space for a few words in support of Mr. Money's remarks on the\nunsuitable nature of the word \" hallucination \" as descriptive of the whole of\nthe apparitional phenomena recounted in Phantasms of the Living, the\nJournal, and elsewhere. Whatever signification the leaders of psychical\nresearch may attribute to the word \"hallucination\" and its derivatives, it\nseems to me that not only to the \"man in the street,\" but also ad clerum it can\nonly be understood to mean something deceptive or erroneous, i.e., without\nbasis in reality except, per se, as merely ' ' occurring. \" Hence I cannot under\nstand the term \" veridical hallucination \" (a term often used in the Society's\narticles). How can that which is essentially \"deceiving\" be \"truth-telling\"?\nI could understand a veridical \"image\" or \"presentment\"; and it seems\nbeyond doubt that many of the occurrences classed by the Society for\nPsychical Research under the head of hallucinations have a true relation\n(more or less accurate) with some \"thing,\" or event. Such phenomena,\nwhether subjective or pseudo-objective, I do not consider are properly classed\nas hallucinations, a term, as I said before, conveying the idea of falsity\n(deception) in its usual significance, even to Psychologists.\nA Member of our Society, Mr. F. W. Hayes, suggested a word to me\nsome time ago, which appears (to me) more suitable, viz., \" Pseudo-Soma,\"\nwhich would well designate (I think) any entity having visible form,, whether\nhuman, animal, or inorganic,\u2014a something which seems to be \"the body\"\nwhich it is not. I am, dear Sir, yours very truly,\nH. Venman.\n20, Pimlico-road, London, S.W.\n[I am unable to see what advantage the word psendo-soma, even if other\nwise convenient, would have from Mr. Venman's point of view, since his\nsole objection to the word hallucination seems to be that it conveys the idea\nof falsity, which the word \" pseudo-soma \" conveys still more definitely.\nNor can I understand Mr. Venman's criticism of the term veridical\nhallucination ; since what is \" essentially deceiving \" in one aspect may be\ntruth-telling in another. If I see my friend come into the room at the time\nof his death I receive a false impression of his bodily presence, though I\nmay afterwards find that there was a true relation between the appearance\nand the death. The analogy of dreams may, perhaps, make this clearer, since\ndreams are commonly recognised as deceptive\u2014in the sense that the dreamer\nis not really in the surroundings of which he dreams\u2014even when the dream\nconveys true information. The same kind of deceptiveness attaches to\nhallucinations of the senses, whether veridical or not. A \"truth-telling\"\ndream is a familiar idea : we miy regard hallucinations as waking dreams.\nHowever, I may take this opportunity of saying that, in the last edition\nof the forms used in collecting for the \"Census of Hallucinations,\" I have\navoided using the word hallucination in the sense to which Mr. Venman and\nothers object, in order that the strongest advocate of quasi-material ghosts\nmay be able to use these forms without feeling alienated by anything in the\ninstructions to collectors.\u2014H.

P. Langley. The Chairman hoped that members would\nendeavour to spread the knowledge of the Society among their friends.\nIf each present member should obtain three additional members for the\nBranch, it would be placed upon a permanent basis, and become\nindependent of special donations, by means of which its work is now\nchiefly maintained.\nThe Secretary then read a paper by Mr. T. Barkworth on \" Some\n\fM*reh, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 35\nRecent Experiments in Automatic Writing,\" read previously at a meet\ning in London.\nA report of some sittings with Mrs. Piper in America was then\ngiven by Mr. R. Hodgson. He was satisfied that Mrs. Piper's\n\" mediumistic trance \" was a genuine abnormal state, of whose\nmanifestations the normal waking Mrs. Piper had no direct knowledge.\nHe referred to other \" personalities \" said to \" control \" Mrs. Piper,\nbesides Dr. Phinuit, and discussed the possibility of explaining the\nsupernormal phenomena manifested in her trance-state without assum\ning the agency of disembodied spirits. Simple thought-transference\nfrom the sitter was inadequate, but nearly all the phenomena might be\naccounted for by assuming also thought-transference from persons\nconnected with the sitter. He did not feel sure, however, that this was\nthe real explanation. Many sitters believed that their deceased friends\ncommunicated with them directly through Mrs. Piper. There were\ndifficulties in the way of this hypothesis, chiefly the ignorance of the\n\" purported \" spirits concerning facts in their lives on earth. Tf the\nphenomena were not at all due to the agency of disembodied spirits, the\nalternative hypothesis apparently would be that they were due to a\nsub- or super-conscious personality of Mrs. Piper, possessing a telepathic\nand possibly some other supernormal faculty, and fictitiously represent\ning various deceased persons. Mr. Hodgson then referred to experi\nments made by Professor James and himself with Mrs. Piper's trance\npersonality, and quoted incidents from the accounts of several other\nsitters. He required further investigation of Mrs. Piper's and similar\ncases before concluding that the hypothesis of \" secondary personality \"\nwould completely explain all the phenomena.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\nR. Hodgson.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nIn the present number of the Journal we give three cases which\nare so far similar that the agent, at a distance, either tried to impress\nthe percipient at the time in the particular way in which he was\nimpressed, or at least felt an earnest wish that the percipient could be\nso impressed.\nL. 864. Ae P\" Experimental.\nMr. Myers writes :\u2014\nThe evidence for the following experimental case is, I think, substantially\ngood, although I cannot present it in a complete form. In 1888, a gentleman,\nwhom I will call Mr. A., who has occupied a high public position in India,\nand whom I have known a long time, informed me verbally that he had had\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, 1891\na remarkable experience. He awoke one morning, in India, very early, and in\nthe dawning light saw a lady, whom I will call Mrs. B. , standing at the foot of\nhis bed. At the same time he received an impression that she needed him.\nThis was his sole experience of a hallucination ; and it so much impressed\nhim that he wrote to the lady, who was in England at the time, and\nmentioned the circumstance. He afterwards heard from her that she had\nbeen in a trance-condition at the time, and had endeavoured to appear to him\nby way of an experiment.\nMr. A. did not give me the lady's name, supposing that she did not\ndesire the incident to be spoken of ; nor did he find an opportunity of him\nself inquiring as to her willingness to mention the matter. Meeting Mr. A. on\nJuly 12th, 1890, I again urged him, ineffectually, to take this step. Oddly\nenough, on that very day Mrs. B. (who was a complete stranger to me), with\nout even knowing that Mr. A. had ever mentioned this incident to me, wrote\nme the independent account which follows. Mr. A. 's name was not mentioned,\nbut I at once identified the incident. I made Mrs. B.'s acquaintance, and\nshe ultimately permitted me to publish the account with her name. I then\napplied to Mr. A. and told him that there was no objection on the other\nside. But he now declined to write out his own experience, saying that his\nmemory for the details of the incident might by this time have become\nincorrect. One of the testimonies which the case should have received at\nfirst hand is therefore represented only by my statement. Mrs. B.'s\nexperience, as will be seen, took place in the presence of a friend. I asked\nMrs. B. to apply to this friend for corroboration ; but private reasons, whose\nadequacy I recognised, rendered this at present impossible. The case,\ntherefore, as it stands is evidentially incomplete ; but the important fact is\nthat I received two concordant and absolutely independent accounts from the\nagent and percipient. F. W. H. M.\nMrs. B. writes :\u2014 july 13^ 1890.\nDear Sir, \u2014I was at the meeting at Westminster Town Hall [July 11th],\nand impressed by your desire to learn from private sources anything which\ncould be of interest to the cause of research, I send you the enclosed. My\nname you will please not make public. The experience is one which I can\nnever forget, and is as vivid now as it was the day it happened.\nShould you arrive at any theory regarding it perhaps you would tell me,\nand if I can answer any questions I shall be glad to do so.\nThe following is the account she enclosed :\u2014\nA lady friend, not a professional medium, who had succeeded in impress\ning me with the strangeness of her experiences, suggested that I on my own\naccount should submit myself to be experimented on (I use this term for\nwant of a better) by her. For this purpose I often went to her house, and we\ntwo, quite alone, had several experiences ; sometimes a maid was called in, who\nusually gave confirmation of what we had seen. It is difficult to plunge at\nonce into the experiences I wish to narrate. I must state that to my know\nledge I never attended any paid medium seance at this lady's house, or else\nwhere, and the statement I now make is entirely what I myself experienced.\nMy friend was what she called a materialising medium. She suggested to\n\fMarch, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 37\nme that I was, or could develop into, a clairvoyante. I was most anxious to\nsee something\u2014to do something\u2014but careful not to give myself too much\naway, as, feeling myself to be very impressionable, and highly sensitive, I\nfeared becoming an (unwilling) impostor or hallucination-monger. I will\nnow state the experiences of this particular evening. We were in my friend's\ndrawing-room\u2014a double room\u2014the doors leading to the staircase closed ; the\nroom lighted by two dim candles with shades. She always put out the gas,\nor put it down. I was seated in an armchair, with my back towards the\nwindow, or nearly so ; my friend stood at the end of the room, close to the\nwall, perhaps a few inches from it. She first generally made a few passes\nover me, which rather amused me, as I did not believe that she could\nhypnotise, nor do I know that she can now.\nAs she stood at the end of the room, my first sensation always was that I\nwas being pushed backwards (I have never felt any tangible touch). I\nseemed to have left this world, and in myself felt a double identity. Now\nand then, I, for a second, returned, as it were, to a consciousness that I was\nstill seated in the chair ; scarcely was that realised before I again seemed to slip\nout of life. At this stage the walls behind and at each side of my friend were\ncovered with plaques of light, so brilliant that my eyes winked ; the picture\nbecame outlined with borders of light, the lower part of the wall and the\nchairs against it. Finally, I saw my friend, who appeared to have moved\nforward into the room, about three yards from me. The light played on her\nface ; her hands, crossed, blazed like molten silver ; all the other lights were\nwarm, golden coloured, various figures seemed to pass over her, and war with\neach other, one pushing the other aside, for supremacy. When any\nparticular figure had succeeded in appearing, I was impelled to speak, to\nstate who it was, and in what way it impressed me. Just then I felt weary\nand vexed with myself that it all seemed to serve no end ; no decided\nappearance came to remain, and my brain was feeling the strain of putting\ninto coherent words the ideas with which the various appearances impressed\nme. With an effort I dragged myself forward in the chair, and said, \"I can\ndo no more,\" when a tall woman with old-fashioned grey side-curls, her dress\nI can scarcely describe, formed herself distinctly\u2014a stern, hard-looking\nwoman, whom I had seen before. I exclaimed, \"The woman with the grey\ncurls,\" and a moment after \"She tells me she is Mrs. Hill.\" I know no\nMrs. Hill. She asks me, \"Don't I remember Mrs. Ryan, my mother's\nfriend i \" In an instant I remember a Mrs. Hill, who afterwards became\nMrs. Ryan, a friend of my mother's in my early childhood. With horror I\nexclaimed, \" She is ready to answer any question about my mother. I want\nto know nothing from you.\" The figure leant towards me. I was calm in\na moment, my excitement entirely gone. I said, \"She tells me my will\npower is immense ; if I choose to use it there is nothing I cannot do, and\nasks me to put her words to the test. Whatever I toill shall happen.\" Once\nmore I seem to move backwards ; an instant, and I find myself seriously\ndebating within myself what I should do to prove to myself, and for my own\nsatisfaction, if I am indeed the victim of hallucination or not. I decided in\na flash, on a man whom I knew to be possessed of the most work-a-day\nworld common-sense ; his views and mine regarding most things were at the\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, i?\u00bbi.\nantipodes, very unreceptive, who would be entirely out of sympathy with\nme in my present experiment and experiences, at which I knew he would\nonly laugh, while regarding me as a simple tool in tricky hands. Such a man\nwas, I decided, the most satisfactory for my trial. The grey lady here\nimpressed me with a desire to will ; in her anxiety she appeared to move\ntowards me. I felt her will one with mine, and I willed with a concentrated\nstrength of mind and body, which finally prostrated me, thus : I will that\n[Mr. A.] may feel I am near him and want his help ; and that, without any\nsuggestion from me, he write to tell me I have influenced him to-night.\nThe grey lady disappeared. I was seated in the chair, weary, but feeling\nnaturally, and back in common-place life. We put down the date and the\nappearance of the grey lady, and I spoke to none of what had happened.\nSome weeks passed, when I received a letter from [Mr. A.], asking how had I\nbeen employed on a certain July evening at such and such an hour, mention\ning to what hour it would answer in London\u2014day, date, and hour were those\non which I had made my proof trial\u2014saying that he was asleep, and had\ndreamed something he would tell me, but that he awoke from the dream\nfeeling I wanted something of. him, and asking me to let him know if\nat the time he so carefully mentioned I had been doing anything which had\nany reference to him. I then, and then only, told him what I have here\nrelated.\nOf [Mr. A.'s] dream I know nothing. On meeting him I asked to hear it,\nbut he refused to tell it, and I never pressed to know, feeling little curiosity\nabout it ; the main point of interest for me was, I had made him write to me\nas I desired, and the grey lady had proved her words to me.\nShould you consider this worth investigation I can give you [Mr. A.'s]\nname. It happened in 1886.\nL. 865. Auditory, Quasi-Experimental.\nThe Rev. C. J. Taylor, member of the S.P.R., sends us the\nfollowing narrative from a lady well known to him.\nIn 1849, in November, I was staying for some mouths with an uncle and\naunt who lived in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, quite in the country. My uncle\naccepted an invitation for me to a ball in the little town of G , three\nhours' fast driving across country. The day after the ball I was staying\nwith friends in the same town, and as we were all very tired, the lady of the\nhouse proposed that we should all undress and go to bed for some hours'\nsleep, after our early lunch, as we were going to a small dance in the evening.\nMy bedroom was on the first floor, and the kitchen was next to it ; there was\nno other bedroom on the floor. Before I had time to undress I heard my\nname called loudly (Dorette). I went out into the kitchen to inquire if\nanybody had been there or had called me. The servant assured me that no\none had been, and said she did not know my name, so that she could not\nhave called me herself. I then went back to my room and undressed,\nthinking that I must have been mistaken, but before I had time to go to l>ed\nI distinctly heard my name called again twice, and it was my aunt's voice.\nThis roused me so thoroughly that I sat down and waited for quite half an\n\fMarch, 1893.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 39\nhour before I could compose myself. I then lay down ; and at that moment,\ntwice again, my name was shrieked out in a most distressing manner, and\nagain in my aunt's voice (she had a peculiar accent). I could bear it no longer,\nand, trembling with fright, I dressed myself. I wrote a few words to the\nlady of the house to explain my going away, and then, taking my bag, I went\nto the house of another friend of my uncle's, and begged him to let me be\ndriven home in his carriage, because I felt sure that something had happened\nat home. Seeing that I was so much alarmed, he kindly consented. On\narriving at my uncle's, my aunt met me, saying, \"I was sure you would come.\"\nThen my uncle explained what had happened. It appeared that just about\none o'clock, as they were taking their soup at dinner, my aunt got a letter\nfrom her sister telling her that her mother had had a fit, and begging my\naunt to come at once, if she would see her alive. My aunt called out my\nname impulsively, feeling that she could not in my absence leave home, with\ntwo new servants to look after, a little child, and the house. My uncle\nnaturally reasoned with her that calling my name was of no use, but\npromised to do all he could to start her upon her journey, but she declared\nthat she could not leave home unless I were there, and that before I could be\nfetched the only evening train would be gone. After a good deal of\nconversation, she became much excited at the thought of the difficulty of\nseeing her mother before her death ; and again, twice, called out my name\nvery loudly. Upon this, my uncle urged her most seriously to calm herself,\nand to reflect that it was perfectly useless to call after me, and advised her to\ngo and pack her things for the journey. She replied that she was determined,\nif her thoughts could reach me, to make me hear and come ; which he said\nwas very wicked. Half an hour passed whilst she was packing and making\narrangements ; and then, seeing that her husband's attention was occupied,\nshe rushed to the bottom of the garden, and throwing her arms round a tree to\nsteady herself under her excitement, she said aloud, \"I will tease (qualen) her\nso that she must come to me \" ; and then shrieked out my name again twice.\nMy uncle heard the cry, and rushing out, found his wife clinging to the tree\nas described.\nThe foregoing account was given to me orally by the percipient, Miss\nM., on September 3rd, 1890. I read it over to her, and she approved it as\ncorrect. Charles J.

Sir John\nDrummond Hay, K.C.B., G.M.C.G., who was for many years H.M.'s\nMinister in Marocco and resided at Tangier.\nL. 866. Ae Pn Borderland. Auditory.\nSeptember 16th, 1889.\nIn the year 1879 my son Robert Drummond Hay resided at Mogodor\nwith his family, where he was at that time Consul. It was in the month of\nFebruary. I had lately received good accounts of my son and his family ; I\nwas also in perfect health. About 1 a.m. (I forget the exact day in February),\nwhilst sleeping soundly [at Tangier], I was woke by hearing distinctly the\nvoice of my daughter-in-law, who was with her husband at Mogodor, saying\nin a clear but distressed tone of voice, \"Oh, I wish papa only knew that\nRobert is ill.\" There was a night lamp in the room. I sat up and listened,\nlooking around the room, but there was no one except my wife, sleeping\nquietly in bed. I listened for some seconds, expecting to hear footsteps out\nside, but complete stillness prevailed, so I lay down again, thanking God that\nthe voice which woke me was an hallucination. I had hardly closed my eyes\nwhen I heard the same voice and words, upon which I woke Lady Drummond\nHay and told her what had occurred, and I got up and went into my study,\nadjoining the bedroom, and noted it in my diary. Next morning I related\nwhat had happened to my daughter, saying that though I did not believe\nin dreams I felt anxious for tidings from Mogodor. That port, as you will\nsee in the map, is about 300 miles south of Tangier. A few days after this\nincident a letter arrived from my daughter-in-law, Mrs R. Drummond Hay,\n* The percipient here inserted the following note : \" No, not walked, but went in a\ncarriage. \"\n\fMarch, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 41\ntelling us that my son was seriously ill with typhoid fever and mentioning\nthe night during which he had been delirious. Much struck by the coincidence\nthat it was the same night I had heard her voice, I wrote to tell her what\nhad happened. She replied, the following post, that in her distress at seeing\nher husband so dangerously ill, and from being alone in a distant land, she\nhad made use of the precise words which had startled me from sleep,\nand had repeated them. As it may be of interest for you to receive a\ncorroboration of what I have related, from the persons I have mentioned,\nwho happen to be with me at this date, they also sign, to affirm the accuracy\nof all I have related.\nWhen I resigned, in 1886, I.destroyed, unfortunately, a number of my\ndiaries and amongst them that of 1879, or I should have been able to state\nthe day, and might have sent you the leaf on which I noted the incident.\nAt my request my daughter-in-law has written an account of what she\nsaw when living at Tangier in 1870. [See next case.] I remember well her\ntelling me that she had seen the Moorish hunter who had been accidentally\nshot, and of our hearing the following day that it was at the same hour\nshe had seen him when he was actually killed out hunting in a wood many\nmiles distant from my summer residence, where she was living.\n(J.

As will be observed, the agent in the\nfirst case is percipient in the second.\nL. 867. Ad Pn Collective. Visual.\nIn the spring of 1870 my husband and I were living just outside Tangier,\nin a house and garden belonging to my father-in-law, Sir John Drummond\nHay. The Moorish sportsmen often came to our house to talk over past or\nfuture boar hunts with their friend, \"Rabat,\" as they called my husband\n(Robert), and amongst their number one came more frequently than any, a\nyoung man named \"Kadour,\" son of Sir John's most devoted follower, Hadj\nHamed, and himself a great friend of my husband, for they were of the same\nage, had known each other from boyhood, married the same year, and their\nfirst children had been born not long before the time of which I write.\nKadour was always welcome, and came and went as he pleased, so my sister,\nwho was on a visit to us, was quite familiar with his appearance. One day I\nheard that Kadour and some of the men of his village were off boar-hunting\nin the neighbourhood, and wanted my husband to go with them. This,\nhowever, Robert could not do on account of his duties at the Legation, so\nKadour had to go without him. At about four o'clock in the afternoon of\nthat day, when I knew that the hunt was going on, I was walking with my\nsister in the garden, in the broad approach to the house from whence I\ncould see the entrance to our stables and a path leading to them across a\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, 1891.\nfield. Suddenly I perceived Kadour's well-known figure walking away from\nthe stables, as if he had been, as usual, to see our horses, and await in their\ncompany the arrival of their master. His dress was always remarkable, and\nin some way different from others of our visitors, and I recognised him\ninstantly by his blue \" serawot \" (or full trousers) and claret coloured gelab.\nFor the moment I looked at him without any surprise, but suddenly\nremembering the hunt, I said to my sister, \"Look, there is Kadour ! I\nthought he was to go boar-hunting to-day.\" \"Well,\" she said, \"he has\neither come back or not gone at all, for, certainly, there he is.\" So we went\nto the stables to ask about the matter, and I saw Kadour disappear behind\nsome rising ground before I got there. A groom was sitting on some straw\npolishing a bit, and to him I said, \"Has Kadour, the son of Hadj Hamed,\nbeen here?\" He looked at me astonished, and replied, \"No, Sefiora, the\nSwani men are all away hunting to-day.\" \"I thought so,\" I replied,\n\" but I am sure I saw Kadour just now ! \" The man evidently considered\nme utterly and absurdly mistaken, so, after ascertaining that no one had\nbeen to the stables, I went away, and forgot the matter till next morn\ning, when, as I was dressing for breakfast, I heard passing along the sandy\nroad above our garden the funeral chant of the Moors. At the same moment\nmy husband came into my room, and broke to me the sad news that our poor\nfriend Kadour had been accidentally shot at Awaraasit, 13 miles distant,\nthe day before, at the very hour when I thought I saw him. I could not\nbelieve it for some time, I was so sure, and so was my sister, that we had\nseen him. We afterwards found that in dying his last words had been to\ncommend his wife and infant child to the protection of his friend \"Rabat.\"\nHis last thoughts had flown to the place he had visited almost daily, and\nwhat we had soen with our bodily eyes in broad daylight was his wraith.\nEUPHEMIA DrUMMOND HAY.\nWe have asked for an account of this incident from Mrs. R. Drum-\nmond Hay's sister, who is now married and has gone to New Zealand,\nbut have not received it. In reply to inquiries we are informed that the\ndistance at which the apparition appeared to be was about 120 yards.\nIn reply to a question about similar experiences, Sir John Drum-\nmond Hay writes :\u2014\nMrs. R. Drummond Hay and I have not, since we were of age, ex\nperienced any other hallucinations. When I was a boy of nine years, living\nwith my parents at Edinburgh, I and my elder sister, who had remained in\nthe dining-room to eat dessert after our parents left, saw the figure of a\nwoman pass across the room, disappearing in the opposite wall. We were\nnot frightened and told our parents, who thought that the figure might have\nbeen reflected through the window from the street. The shutters were\nclosed, but there was a chink. I only mention this as you ask me the\nquestion.\nG. 191. ref.\nA repetition of the musical sounds in the case quoted by Mr.\nPodmore in his paper on Phantasms of the Beadfrom anotlier point of\n\fMarch, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 43\nview {Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 304), has recently occurred, as described\nbelow by Lady Z. :\u2014\nI hereby state that, on the 15th November, 1890, I again heard sounds at\nour private cemetery chapel, similar to those described in the Proceeding*\nfor June (1890).

Davey's Experiments.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir,\u2014In the January number of the Journal the death of Mr. S. J. Davey\nis announced, with a complimentary reference to his \"experiments,\"\nrecorded in Vol. IV. of the Proceedings. I, and many other Spiritualists,\nthought at the time that to publish those experiments without any elucidation\nof them other than Mr. Davey's assertion, that they were all \" tricks,\" was\nan unscientific and unfair proceeding, since it accepted as evidence in his\ncase a mere personal statement which it has always refused to consider of the\nslightest value when made by Spiritualists.\nNow, however, that further secrecy is unnecessary, I trust that Mrs.\nSidgwick, Mr. Hodgson, and any other persons to whom (as stated at p. 485\nof Proceedings, Vol. IV.) Mr. Davey communicated \" the details of his\nmethods,\" will give a full account of them, in order that we who believe that\nthere are genuine phenomena of which Mr. Davey purported to give \"trick\"\nimitations, may be able to judge how far this claim is supported by the actual\nfacts of the case.\nIf such experiments as those recorded at Sittings 11 and 12, and at the\nmaterialisation seance, are clearly and fully explained as mechanical or\nsleight-of-hand tricks, available under the conditions usually adopted by\nprofessed mediums, it will do more to weaken the evidence for Spiritualistic\nphenomena than anything that has yet been adduced by disbelievers. As\none of the witnesses says : \"I believe that a full explanation of his methods\nwould ' fire a shot heard round the world ' in almost every civilised community\nwhere the phenomena of so-called ' Spiritualism ' are perplexing, and often\nmadden true and good people.\" (I.e., p. 435.) But to have this effect it\nwill not do to explain some of the phenomena by trick, leaving the more\nmysterious unsolved. They are claimed to be all trick, and unless all can be\nso explained many of us will be confirmed in our belief that Mr. Davey was\nreally a medium as well as a conjurer, and that in imputing all his perform\nances to \" trick \" he was deceiving the Society and the public.\nAlfred R. Wallace.\n[It is a mistake to suppose that Mr. Davey's assertion that his perform\nances involved no \" mediumship \" was the only or the chief ground for\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, 1891.\nmaintaining this position. Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. Hodgson, and Mr. Angolo\nJ. Lewis were all aware of the details of ;Mr. Davey's methods, and by\nthis is meant that they were aware of the details as applied to the specific\nincidents reported in the sittings, and they had no doubt whatever but that the\nphenomena described in the reports were completely explained by ordinary\nmeans. (Vol. IV. Proc. S.P.R., pp. 400, 485, 486.) But not only was this\nthe case. Of the sixteen sittings for slate-writing reported, Mrs. Sidgwick\nattended two, and perceived some of Mr. Davey's sleight-of-hand move\nments, which were unperceived by the other witness at these sittings, and\nshe was afterwards informed of the precise methods employed by Mr.\nDavey throughout both sittings, and was absolutely satisfied that the writing\nwas produced as he described. Further, Mr. Hodgson was present at five of\nthe sittings. He was, as we learn from him, usually informed beforehand,\nas far as possible, what Mr. Davey proposed to do ; and he actually witnessed\nthe details of the trick performances in every incident of any importance.\nIn addition to this, he went over every detail of all the sittings with Mr.\nDavey, and was perfectly satisfied with the explanation given of the sittings\nwhere he was not present himself to give his \"independent testimony\nconcerning the mode of production of the phenomena.\" (Vol. IV. Proc.\nS.P.R., p. 400.)\nBut we think that Mr. Wallace greatly overrates the value of specific\nverbal explanations of Mr. Davey's methods, so far as such explanations are\npossible. Suppose, e.g., it is a question of the substitution of one slate\nfor another, as in Sitting 11. [c] (Vol. IV., pp. 427-8. See Mrs. Y.'s\naccount.) Mr. Wallace may say that there was absolutely no opportunity\nfor any substitution at a sitting which he may have had with a medium.\nMrs. Y. so affirmed :\u2014\n\" This test seemed to me perfect. The slate was under my own eye on\ntop of the table the whole time, and either my daughter's hand or my own\nwas placed firmly upon it without the intermission of even a second ; more\nover we closed and opened it ourselves. \"\nNevertheless, the substitution occurred and Mr. Hodgson saw it. Mrs.\nY. 's statement is erroneous. That the substitution was necessary for the\ntrick Mr. Hodgson knew beforehand, and in the morning of the day of the\nsitting he saw Mr. Davey write on the second slate the communication which\nwas found there during the sitting. But precisely when the substitution\nwould be effected Mr. Hodgson did not know beforehand. The description\nof the incident, however, even though in greater detail, may be of little\nvalue to Mr. Wallace ; the instructive part of it has already been emphasised\nin Mr. Hodgson's introduction, viz., that such positive statements as that\nof Mrs. Y. quoted above may be entirely erroneous. Mr. Wallace, apparently,\nis unable to believe that human testimony, under the circumstances in\nquestion, can be as unreliable as Mr. Davey's investigation proved it to be ;\nbut possibly a detailed description of some of the sittings, with accounts of\nthe devices resorted to by Mr. Davey, may lead Mr. Wallace, as well as\nothers who share his present opinion that Mr. Davey was a medium, to the\nconviction that his performances are all explicable by ordinary means, and\ntherefore\u2014this beiiuj the really important conclusion\u2014that human testimony\n\fMarch, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 45\nunder the circumstances is unreliable to the degree alleged. It is accord\ningly proposed that Mr. Hodgson should prepare an article on this subject.\nThat such an article should seem at all necessary, is, to those who are\nfamiliar with Mr. Davey's methods and with the mal-observation and lapses\nof memory shown by the uninitiated sitter, an additional proof that certain\ncelebrated professional mediums are merely conjurers\u2014since we may take\nMr. Wallace's letter to admit that he for one cannot distinguish between\nMr. Davey's performances and ordinary \" mediumistic \" phenomena. \u2014Ed.]\n\"The Religio-Philosophical Journal.\"\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir, \u2014I beg to recommend to the notice of your readers the Religio-\nPhilosophical Journal, published weekly by Colonel Bundy, Chicago. While\navowing a belief in Spiritualistic phenomena, this journal has long been\nhonourably distinguished for its prompt and fearless exposure of the frauds\ncommonly practised by professional mediums in the United States. This\nunflinching candour tends, I believe, to reduce the circulation of the\npaper, which is tabooed by the credulous and the dishonest, and finds its\naudience mainly among those whose interest in ' ' psychical \" phenomena is of\na sober and not a fanatical kind. The editor has greatly assisted Mr.\nHodgson in his work of collecting evidence in America. Several cases of\nimportance have come to our Society through this channel.

It was not proposed to\ninclude in its meaning anything to which the term ' hallucination ' (veridical\nor otherwise) could with propriety be applied.\"\n\"ANNALES DES SCIENCES PSYCHIQUES.\"\nWe welcome the announcement of a bi-monthly periodical of this\nname, whose first number is to appear on March 15.

(See Proceed\nings, Vol. III., p. 460.) It seems, therefore, desirable to mention that\nhe has recently been caught acting a supposed spirit at one of the\npublic seances given by him and Williams. Pull accounts of the\nexposure, which seems to have been very skilfully managed, have\nappeared in the Star newspaper of February 6th and 7th, Light, and\nelsewhere, and we will only briefly describe it here. Two gentlemen,\nhaving suspected fraud at previous stances, brought an electric lamp in\nthe form of a scarf-pin. The company, including the mediums, sat at\na table holding hands all round, and different \"spirits\" appeared in\nsuccession, shown by the light of a phosphorescent slate. Suddenly\nthe electric light was turned on and revealed Husk standing up, leaning\nover the table, with white drapery arranged on his head, and the\nluminous slate in his right hand, which had been set free by his\nneighbour, who was another well-known medium\u2014Rita.\nWilliams has been more than once publicly exposed, and Rita\nand he were involved in a fraudulent materialisation which was\nexposed in Holland some 10 or 12 years ago.\nCATALOGUE OF UNPRINTED CASES.\n(Continued from the January Journal.)\nFurther information improving the evidence in any of these cases\nwill be gratefully received.\nB L 82.

A\nvote of thanks was awarded to the donors.\nIt was directed that a copy of Circular III. Edition 2, and of Cir\ncular V., be sent round with the March Journal to all names on the\nEnglish List, and that a supply be sent to Mr. Hodgson for the\nmembers of the American Branch.\nThe Finance Committee, as requested, presented a report and an\nestimate of Income and a scheme of Expenditure for the current year,\nwhich, after consideration and discussion, were adopted.

A selec\ntion only of the accounts of experiments was read and those concerned\nwith drawings were illustrated by enlarged copies hung on a screen.\nThe paper will, it is hoped, appear in full in the forthcoming number of\nthe Proceedings, and need not, therefore, be given in abstract here.\nThe President spoke of his own acquaintance with Baron von\nSchrenk-Notzing, commenced on a visit to Munich three years ago,\nwhich Dr. Myers and he undertook with a view to witnessing some\nclairvoyant experiments then going on. The primary object of the\nvisit had not been fulfilled, owing to the serious illness of the clair\nvoyant, but he was glad that it had enabled him to make the acquaint\nance of so zealous, careful, and intelligent a co-operator in our work as\nBaron von Schrenk-Notzing. Commenting on the paper which had\njust been read, he drew attention to the differences observed by the\nauthor in the way in which the idea transferred seemed to reach the\nconsciousness of different percipients, as both interesting and instruc\ntive. He also remarked, in reference to Baron von Schrenk's success\nin finding percipients, that there was probably a considerable difference\nin agents, and that there was reason to think that he had the advantage\nof being an exceptionally good one.\nA paper by Professor W. James and Mr. Hodgson on a case of\n\" double personality of the ambulatory type \" (that of the Rev. Ansel\nBourne), of which an abstract was given in the Journal for January,\np. 5, was then read by Mr. Leaf.\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1891.\nMr. Leaf at the conclusion of the paper recalled to the recollection\nof the meeting similar cases that had been observed in France,\nespecially that of Emile X., of which an account, abbreviated from\nthe Revue de VHypnotisms, was given in the Journal for May, 1890,\np. 258. In this case, as in the case of Mr. Bourne, memory of what had\noccurred in the secondary state was recovered by hypnotism. He also\npointed out a difference between Mr. Bourne's case and most of the\nothers in the fact that Mr. Bourne's character and habits in his two\nstates seem to have been very much alike, whereas in many cases a\nvery complete change occurs.\nMr. Barkworth raised the question whether the degree of com\npleteness in the alternation of memory between the two states in Mr.\nBourne's case was not peculiar\u2014whether in most such cases the\nmemory did not extend in one of the states over both, though dis\ncontinuous in the other.\nThe President said that the degree of separation between the\ndifferent consciousnesses varied very much in different cases.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL. 872. Ae Pn Auditory.\nThe following case resembles those printed in the Journal for\nMarch, especially Nos. 865 and 866, in that actual words uttered by\nthe agent were apparently transferred to the percipient, who thus\nobtained more precise information than a veridical hallucination is often\nable to give.\nMrs. Howieson writes :\u2014\nRostrevor, Winterwell-road, Brixton Hill, S. W. [February, 1891.]\nThe incident which I promised to relate to you occurred in June, 1883.\nMy eldest daughter Kathleen, then a child nearly five years old, was absent\nfrom home on a visit to my mother, who lived in Newport, Monmouthshire.\nFor some months previous to her leaving home, she had been in a weak,\nnervous state of health, but an absence of three months in that charming\ncounty, and living almost entirely out of doors, wrought wonders for her.\nMy mother wrote to me from time to time, saying how well she could climb\nthe hills, and how her nervousness had given place to joyous glee, as she\nwatched from a hill top the ships sailing in sunlight up and down the Bristol\nChannel, or the wonderfully fascinating, gorgeous sunsets over Twm Barium,\nwhich even now she dreams of.\nAll my anxiety about her had vanished, and with my little baby three\nweeks old beside me, I was quietly sleeping when I suddenly awaked, hear\ning Kathleen call me, in a sharp, terrified voice, \" Mamma, oh ! mamma ! \"\nForgetting that the child was away, I sat up in bed and called to my nurse,\n\fApril, 189i.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 53\nsaying. \"Do see, nurse, what ails Miss Kathleen.\" \" Why, ma'am,\" she\nsaid, \"you've been dreaming, sure you know she's in Newport.\"\nThoroughly awake, I laughed and lay down to sleep ; but just as I was\ndozing off again, I was startled by hearing the child's voice calling down the\nstairs from the next floor, where she slept when at home, the same wordp,\n\"Mamma, oh! mamma!\" I simply screamed to nurse, \"Oh, nurse, I've\nheard her again, and there is something wrong with the child.\" I trembled\nall over, the thing was so real ; and yet so unlikely, that I allowed myself to\nbe soothed, and talked into silence.\nNo sooner had nurse settled herself comfortably in bed, and I, broad\nawake, was lying wondering about it, when Kathleen's cry broke on my ears\nagain, a scream, \"Mamma, oh! mamma, I've got scarlet fever, I've got scarlet\nfever ! \" There was no more sleep for me that night. My husband came in\nand tried to calm me, in vain, and when the morning came he telegraphed to\nNewport, and this is the sequel.\nThe evening before, Kathleen complained of headache going to bed, and\nafter she went to bed grew hot and feverish, so much so that my mother\nsat up with her, hoping to see her go to sleep. All the night she kept saying,\n\"I wish my mamma was here,\" \"I don't know why I left my mamma.\" But\nas the small hours of the morning drew on she grew so ill that my father\nfetched the doctor. On seeing her he said it was just possible she had\ncaught scarlet fever, as it was very prevalent just then. Directly the child\nheard what he said, the wild scream I had heard broke from her, in the\nvery words, \" Mamma, oh ! mamma, I've got scarlet fever, I've got scarlet\nfever ! \" And nearly 200 miles away they were flashed to my ears. But how 1\nWas it the overpowering longing of the child's spirit that, in its terror, shook\noff the clogging body, and bridging, in a moment, distance and time, rushed\nto the spirit that it believed would shelter it 1\nKathleen did not have the fever after all, and was well in a few days, but\nmy mother had such a fright with her that she embraced the first opportunity\nto send her home. Bessie Howieson.\nMr. Howieson confirms the account as follows :\u2014\nI remember this incident and can vouch for the correctness of the fore\ngoing statement. W. D. Howieson.\nMrs. Howieson's father, the Rev. John Douglas, at whose house the\nchild was staying at the time, gives the following account of the\nbeginning of the illness.\nFebruary 25th, 1891.\nThe child and her nurse came on a visit to my house during, I believe, the\nsummer months of 1883. She had been with us some time, when she was\nsuddenly taken ill and the doctor whom we called in to attend her pronounced\nit scarlet fever or scarlatina. I cannot remember what age she was, but I\nsuppose she was 5 or 6 years old. We were greatly alarmed on hearing it\nwas a fever she had caught. She understood what the doctor had said as to\nher complaint, or perhaps overheard it, from my dear wife speaking to the\nnurse, or my younger daughters, of what the doctor had said of the sudden\nillness. She then frequently called out for her mamma, who, of course, was\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1891.\nabout 150 miles away, residing in London. The child was with me in\nNewport, Mon., when ill. This is the substance of what occurred. We\nreceived next day a letter, perhaps a telegram, from Mrs. Howieson, asking\nabout the child's health, stating she feared she must be ill as she distinctly\nheard her call out, \"Mamma, I have caught scarlet fever.\" \" Come to me,\"\nI think, was added. Our reply was the first real information Mrs. Howieson\ngot of the attack. John Douglas.\nMr. Douglas himself has experienced several hallucinations, some of\nwhich were almost certainly subjective, but, among others, an apparition\nof a neighbour who he found next morning had died, unknown to him,\nseven weeks before. He and his wife had also heard knocks at the\ntime of his father's death, and they had lived for some time in a\n\" haunted house \" in the south of Ireland, where unaccountable noises,\napparently of a very violent and persistent kind, were heard often by\nthemselves and several other people.\nMiss Alice Johnson, who had an interview with Mrs. Howieson,\nwrites :\u2014.\nI saw Mrs. Howieson on December 23rd, 1890, and had a long talk with\nher about her own and her father's psychical experiences. She gave me an\naccount, which closely corresponded in all essentials with the one given\nabove, of her hearing her child's voice, adding that whenever Kathleen had\nbeen away from home since that time, she had always expected to hear her\nvoice again, but had never done so. Kathleen came in for a few minutes,\nand I found that she remembered having been ill while on a visit to her\ngrandfather, and a few trivial details connected with the illness, but had\nforgotten her alarm and her crying for her mother. Mr. Howieson told me\nthat he remembered the whole incident perfectly well, but there was not\ntime then for him to give me an independent account.\nL. 873.

As far as we know, Mr. Fremont had no supernormal impression\nabout his family at the same time that his wife had the impression\nabout him. It is an interesting feature in the case that Mrs. Fremont's\nexperience was to some extent reflected on to her sister. No doubt\nMrs. Fremont's face betrayed that something had occurred and led to\nMiss Mary Benton's (Mrs. Warren's) exclamation, but it seems pretty\n\fApril, 189i.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 55\ncertain that her sister's impression was more definite than her cousin's,\nand perhaps the most probable explanation of it is that it was due to\nthought-transference from Mrs. Fremont.\nThe first account we give is taken from Wide Awake (a periodical\npublished by D. Lothrop and Co., Boston) for December, 1888, but is\nsomewhat abridged.\n* * * * *\nWe could not look to hear from Mr. Fremont on the unoccupied line of\ncountry he was exploring that winter of 1853-54 ; he must first reach the\nclose at San Francisco, and our first news must come by the Isthmus route of\nPanama ; at the earliest, midsummer. But in midwinter, without any reason,\nI became possessed by the conviction that he was starving ; nor could any\neffort reason this away. No such impression had ever come to me before,\nalthough more than once dreadful suffering, and even deaths from starvation\nhad befallen his other expeditions. This time it came upon me as a fact I\ncould not turn from. It fairly haunted me for nearly two weeks, until,\nyoung and absolutely healthy as I was, it made a physical effect on me.\nSleep and appetite were broken up, and in spite of my father's and my\nown efforts to dissipate it by reasoning, by added open-air life, nothing\ndulled my sense of increasing suffering from hunger to Mr. Fremont and his\nparty.\nThis weight of fear was lifted from me as suddenly as it had come.\nMy house was near that of my father, and the younger part of his family\nwhen returning from parties often came to me for the remainder of the night\nthat the elders might not have their sleep broken. In this way one of my\nsisters, and a cousin, came to me after a wedding ball at General Jessup's.\nThe drive home was long and over rough frozen streets, and it was nearly one\no'clock when they came in\u2014 glad enough of the bright room and big wood\nfire waiting them. As girls do, they took off their ball dresses and made\nthemselves comfortable with loose woollen gowns and letting down their\nhair, while I, only too pleased just then to have an excuse for staying up\nwith others, made them tea as we talked over the evening and the bride.\nThe fire was getting low and I went into the adjoining dressing-room to\nbring in more wood. It was an old-fashioned big fireplace, and the sticks\nwere too large to grasp with the hand ; as I half-knelt, balancing the long\nsticks on my left arm, a hand rested slightly on my left shoulder, and Mr.\nFremont's voice, pleased and laughing, whispered my name. There was no\nsound beyond the quick-whispered name\u2014no presence, only the touch\u2014\nthat was all. But I knew (as one knows in dreams) that it was Mr.\nFremont, gay, and intending to startle my sister whose ready scream always\nfreshly amused him.\nSilently I went back into the girls' room with the wood, but before I\ncould speak my sister, looking up to take a stick from me, gave a great cry\nand fell in a heap on the rug.\n\" What have you seen 1 \" called out our cousin, Mary Benton. . . .\nI had not yet spoken ; this was all in a flash together. When I said it was\nMr. Fremont\u2014that he touched my shoulder for me to \"keep still and let\nhim scare Susy\" \u2014 then the poor child screamed again and again. We\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1891.\ncrushed her ball dress over her head to keep the sound from the neighbours,\nbut it was difficult to quiet her.\nThe girls had been distressed by my fixed idea of danger to Mr. Fremont\nand knew how out of condition it had made me. Their first thought now\nwas that my mind had broken down. They soon realised this was not so, as\nwe discussed the strange fact of my knowing\u2014and so surely that peace came\nback to me\u2014that whatever he had had to bear was over ; that he was now\nsafe and light of heart ; and that in some way he himself had told me\nso. We talked long, and the girls were too excited for sleep, though the\nunreliable little French clock chimed three. But a blessed rest had fallen\non me and I went off to \"a sleep that sank into my soul,\" deep and dreamless,\nfrom which I did not wake until ten the next day, when my eyes opened to\nsee my father sitting by my bedside. He had been guarding my sleep a long\ntime \u2014in fact the whole household were protecting it as the crisis of a fever.\n*****\nWith sleep and appetite strength soon returned, but the true \" good-\nmedicine \" was my absolute certainty of safety for Mr. Fremont.\n* * * * *\nWe all talked it over with friends, often. There was no way to verify\nwhat Mr. Fremont's part had been during those two weeks. We must wait\nuntil, his journey over, by summer at the earliest, he should reach San\nFrancisco, and then the only mail was nearly a month, vid the Isthmus.\nBut in early April there came to Washington, overland, a Mormon elder,\nnamed Babitt, from the settlement of Parowan in (now) South Utah. Mr.\nBabitt brought us letters from Mr. Fremont written at Parowan, and added\nmany details of personal intelligence.\n*****\nNow the fact was verified that there had been a starving time ; that it had\nlasted through January into the next month ; that the last fortnight had\nbeen desperately, almost fatally exhausting\u2014quite so to [one man]. This\nfortnight was the period during which I knew of their starving.\nThe relief came to them when they got into Parowan\u2014the evening of the\nsixth of February\u2014when I was made to know that also, that same night.\nEvery family took in some of the men, putting them into warm rooms and\nclean comfortable beds, and kind-faced women gave them reviving food and\npitying words. Mr. Fremont's letters could not say enough of the gentle,\npatient care of these kind women. And of his own \" great relief of mind.\"\nAfter this we heard no more until the twenty-fifth of May, when he\ntelegraphed from New York as his steamer got in from Aspinwall, and by\nset of sun he was again at home.\nSoon he was told by my father of what I have been telling you here. His\nlawyer-habit of mind had made him minutely verify what we three women\nhad to tell, but there was a point beyond\u2014the point of Time.\nAs nearly as we could settle it, two a.m. was the hour I had the flash of\ninformation that all was well again. The girls had stayed out later than\nusual as it was an assembly of family friends for a marriage festivity, and the\nlong rough drive over frozen mud of the old Washington streets was neces\nsarily slow.

In answer to inquiries, of those present there\nis only now one living witness\u2014my cousin Mary Benton. I have written\nfor her present address, as early in the winter she went to a grandchild in\nVirginia.\nWas not the General there 1 How could he know my sister was with me\nunless he saw us ?\nShe heard no voice, saw no form, but instantly knew on seeing me that I\nhad seen Mr. Fremont. Mary only saw that I \"had seen something\"\u2014enough\nto startle her from her usual balanced repose of mind. But I both heard the\nvoice, though but in the uttering my name ; felt the light touch on my\nshoulder and knew I was to make no warning, for he wanted to make Susy\nscream. She was but eight years old when he married into the family and\nwas always a pet p aymate. Her shrill prolonged scream was his delight,\nand he never lost a chance to startle her. She was a sound-nerved, healthy\nyoung thing, just twenty\u2014unmarried, and about equally dividing her life\nbetween her piano and her horse, on which she rode hours daily. This\nsister died in 1874. Another sister [Mrs. E. Benton Jones], then at my\nfather's, knew of it at once.\nIt was quite the only time I ever knew, or in any way was impressed\nwith the danger to Mr. Fremont ; though he had had other experiences\nof prolonged starvation, and often of deadly danger in other ways. I\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1891.\nwas in my usual good health\u2014unusual health always and at that age, only\nthirty ; my nerves were unshaken. I had my regular occupations of family\nlife and the usual full life of Washington in winter. My mother's ill-\nhealth made my sister and myself her representatives also. The mornings\nwere regularly full of the children's lessons, their French governess living\nwith me, and altogether there was nothing to let morbid fancies grow up,\nwhen suddenly came this certainty of starvation to the party, increasing as\nwe afterwards knew with the increasing danger. Exercise, more varied\noccupation\u2014nothing removed this fixed impression. When, just as suddenly\nas it came, it was taken from me.\nWhy I was so warned at this time, and not at other times, has often been\na question to me. I was at home \" among my own people,\"\u2014everything in\ncontented, placid routine of home happiness, and suddenly it was broken, as\nit never had been before, by my following in mind the distant exploring\nparty.\nI cannot give any more details. Often I have regretted our not putting\nit all on record at the time.\nJessie Benton Fremont.\nLater Mrs. Fremont writes :\u2014\nLos Angeles, March 15th, 1889.\nI send you the enclosed letter from Mrs. Warren\u2014the Mary Benton of\nour singular experience\u2014because, as you will notice, she speaks of their\nanxiety for me during the long sleep that followed that comforting im\npression.\nJessie Benton Fremont.\nThe following is an extract from the letter enclosed :\u2014\nMuir, Fayette Co., Ky., March 9th, 1889.\nI think I fully understand what you want, and will try to give as correctly\nas I can my testimony to your \" modern ghost story.\" But to me it is very\nreal, and your version of it correct, as I remember it that night.

While, as she says, we were so\naccustomed to seeing Mr. Fremont return home safely from his long and\nperilous journeys, still that winter we had some uneasiness from the fact\nthat he did not have his old and trusted guide, Kit Carson, with him. Mrs.\nFremont became very anxious and so much so as to make us all concerned for\nher\u2014the belief of the starvation to the party affecting her so much as to\nmake her unable to take sufficient nourishment herself. So the relief to her\nwas great when the \" vision,\" as we all felt it to be, came to her.\nThat there is some curious connection of mind between us and those we\ncare for cannot be doubted, and has in many cases been well attested. My\nfather himself, at different times, had that realising sense of another's\npresence, though, while a man of fine sensibilities, he was not what would be\ncalled an imaginative man.\nI do not recall any other circumstances than those given by Mrs.\nFremont. We were all so thankful to see her mind relieved that it was\nhailed with delight.\nE. Benton Jones.\nGeneral Fremont writes:\u2014\nLos Angeles, July 15th, 1889.\nEnclosed I send you the promised statement of my share in the\nexperience related by Mrs. Fremont. I thought it well to sketch briefly the\ncircumstances which led up to the condition in which I reached Parowan at\nthe time to which her statement refers.\nJohn C. Fremont.\nIn November of 1853 I set out on a winter expedition across the\ncontinent. Efforts towards opening up the western country had already\ntaken practical shape. The long trains of emigrant waggons working along\ndifficult and dangerous roads were enforcing the necessity of railways to\nthe Pacific. Organised efforts were being made to accomplish this. As\nbefals every good measure, strong opposition was being made to this, and,\namong other arguments, it was urged that the snows on the wide sweep of\nthe great plains and in the Rocky Mountains would present insurmountable\nobstacles. To ascertain by personal observation and experience what were\nin fact the obstructions which the winter of those regions would oppose to a\nrailway, was the object of this expedition.\nEmerging from the settlements of the Missouri frontier, I met at the\noutset the approach of an early winter ; but game was abundant on the\nprairies, the snow there light, and there was no hardship worthy of note\nuntil we were fairly engaged among the mountains. The line which I had\nin view to follow lay across the mountains by the heads of the Rio del\nNorte and the Colorados of the Gulf of California. Up to the San Luis\nValley and the head waters of the Del Norte there had been sufficient game,\nand for our animals grass enough. But, entering the mountain region of\nthe Colorado waters beyond, the game suddenly faded, and on that side\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1S91.\nthere was deep snow, though outside of drifts only some four feet on the\nlevel in small valleys and bottoms among the hills. It proved that in this\nregion the valleys were barren, only the mountains fertile. We had to keep\nto these for what of grass or game was to be had. It became difficult for the\nanimals to find enough to keep up their strength, and of the few that\nremained serviceable the best were kept for the hunters, who had to cover\nwide tracts in search of game. The rest of the party were on foot. Shortly,\nthe men grew weak upon scanty fare, hard work by day and guard by night,\nand hunger soon lengthened into starvation. This made progress slow, and\nwhen we issued from the mountains into the valley of the Colorado River\nthe broken line of our half-starved men, straggling across the naked desert\nof the great valley, did not much resemble the well-equipped party of hardy\nmen which had left the Missouri a few months back. All were now existing\non mule meat. We crossed the river at the head of one of the great canons,\nand were soon again involved among the snowfields of the mountains.\nThere remained now only the bed of the Wahsatch ranges to cross. Here,\nfor the first and only time in much travelling through inhospitable lands, I\nfairly gave out. Going up a long mountain slope, I was breaking my way\nthrough the snow a little way ahead of the party, when suddenly my strength\ngave out. All power of motion left me ; I could not move a foot. The\nmountain slope was naked, but it just happened that near by was a good\nthick grove of aspens, and across a neighbouring ravine the yellow grass\nshowed above the snow on a south hillside. Saying to Godey, as he came up,\nthat I would camp there, I sat down in the snow, and waited. After a few\nmoments, strength enough came back, and no one noticed what had hap\npened. The next day we came upon a good camping ground, when I made\na halt and disencumbered the party of everything not absolutely necessary.\nHere I had good observations, and was able to tell my men that we\nwere only 50 miles in air line from the Mormon town of Parowan, in the\ngreat basin. This certainty of near relief nerved them up to effort, and in a\nfew days more we forced our way across the last ridges of the Wahsatch\nmountains.\nWith the exception of one man who could not hold out, and died from\nstarvation just as we came out of the mountains, I had brought my people\nsafely through. It had been a narrow chance.\nAt the foot of the last hill we struck a waggon road, leading to the town\nof Parowan, and shortly after came upon a camp of Utah Indians.\nAmong them was the son of a chief whom I knew. At our last meeting I\nhad given the son a knife. He was pleased to see me, and, remembering,\ngave me a dog, which, together with some flour that we traded from the\nIndians, made for us all a welcome feast, except for my Delawares. They\nmade for themselves with the flour a kind of paste with which they filled\nup, and in consequence startled the night with many groans. The next day\nwe reached Parowan. We were received there by all the people with\ngenuine hospitality, and everything a generous kindness could suggest was\ndone for our comfort. Good quarters in the town were provided for all, and\nfresh clothing, good food, and the luxury of a real bed, made recent hard\nships seem like a bad dream.\n\fApril, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 61\nThat night I made in my notebook the entry of which Mrs. Fremont\nspeaks. I had some work with the stars which was of special interest to me,\nand I sat up by my camp fire far into the night, dreaming of home, thinking\nhow happy Mrs. Fremont would be if only she could know that I was safe.\nI knew that at home the uncertain nature of my journey was well under\nstood, and that there was constant anxiety to know how it had fared with\nme.\nMy work over, I returned to my quarters in the town, only a few hundred\nyards away. The warm, bright room and big white bed, with all their sug\ngestions of shelter and relief from danger, fell in with what I had been\nthinking, and made the picture of home rise up like a real thing before me,\nand when, as was my habit at the close of a day's work, I took up my\njournal, I put there the wish that had possession of my mind\u2014that Mrs.\nFremont could only know that all danger was past and that it was well with\nme.\nJohn C. Fremont.\nIt is an interesting point about the next case that though the agent's\nwish to communicate what was passing must have been strong, she can\nhardly have wished to impress the actual percipient.\nL. 874. Ae P8 Child Percipient.\nFrom Mr. Edward Crewdson, Jun., of Tuckerville, Chester Co.,\nNebraska, U.S.A.\nMr. Crewdson explains that at the time of the occurrence described\nhe owned two ranches in Nebraska, called the \" East \" and \" West \"\nranches. On the former he resided with his family. The other\nconsisted of three sections, partially separated from one another by a\nsection of Government land. In order to acquire a piece of this to\nconnect two of his sections, certain conditions were necessary, of which\ncontinuous residence for six months was one. He was building a\n\" frame house \" there for this purpose, and meanwhile had a sod-house\nbuilt and went over every week with one or two of his three sons to\nstay a night or two.\nHe continues :\u2014\nThis brings me to about March 20th, 1885. My wife expected to have a\nbaby towards the end of April. March 20th (as nearly as I can remember)\nI was leaving the East Banche as usual, with blankets, food, &c., for the two\neldest boys and myself, when the youngest boy Hugh came running out cry\ning and begged to be taken. I forgot to mention that the three girls were at\nschool in England. Mrs. Crewdson was standing by the buckboard, bidding\nus good-bye, and said, \" Oh yes, do take Hughie, and I will have a thorough\nrest till you come back.\" So Hughie jumped up and we left. The West\nRanche is 15 miles from the East, and we got there about 6.30. I cooked our\nsupper, had a pipe, and I suppose by 9.30 or 10 we were all sound asleep.\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1891.\nHow long I slept I could not tell, but I was awakened by Hughie, who was\nsleeping with me, sitting up and crying, ' ' Oh, pa ! pa ! \" \" What is it, Hughie % ' '\n\" Oh, pa, there is a little baby in bed with mamma.\" Now the child had no\nidea there was one expected\u2014could have had none, for our children are\nabsurdly innocent, even the older ones\u2014tawkwardly innocent at times. It\nwas so strange, and I was so thoroughly awake that I did not go to sleep for\nsome time, and was on the point of getting up and driving home, but felt that\nif there was nothing I should look so very foolish.\nIn the morning I hurried through my business, telling the last man my\nreason for cutting him short. Before I was five miles away from the ranche\na cowboy met me with the news that a baby had been born in the night.\nWe were without servants at the time, and though my old Scotch foreman\nhad done his best in sending off for the nearest women and the doctor\n(20 miles off), my wife had a very trying time, and it is quite possible that\nher intense wish for me may have had something to do with Hughie's\ncommunication.\nHughie is a very sensitive and clever boy\u2014too clever. He wants no\nencouragement, but rather holding back ; not delicate in any way\u2014none of\nour children are, I am thankful to say\u2014but a sort of child who understands\nan explanation before you have said a dozen words ; very excitable ; will wake\nup, scream, and shiver if he has been too long in the schoolroom. The\ncowboys, of course, got up all sorts of ideas, which I paid no attention to\u2014\nsuch as that they had long known that Hughie knew instinctively if it was\ngoing to rain, especially thunder rain.\nThe farmer's name to whom I told the incident, before leaving the West\nRanche, is James Whitehead ; his address is Redfern, &c.\nEdw. Cbewdson, Jun.\nNovember Wth, 1889.\nIn answer to inquiries, Mr. Crewdson says :\u2014\nHughie was 4J years old. His exclamation occurred just at the time\nor shortly after the birth of our baby. He simply stated it as a fact and did\nnot say if he dreamt it or not, but, as he jumped up suddenly awakened, it\nseems likely that he dreamt it. No explanation was ever asked, nor could\nhe, I think, have given one.\nWe wrote to Mr. Whitehead, who now resides at Broken Bow,\nNebraska, and he replied :\u2014\nJanuary 27th, 1891.\nThe circumstances you call upon me to corroborate are substantially as\nfollows.\nMr. Crewdson, with three of his boys, was at his \"West Ranche, \"looking\nafter his interests there. His wife remained at Tuckerville some 18 miles\ndistant. Some time during the night he was awakened by his youngest boy\nHughie, about 3J years old\u2014nicknamed \"Bah\"\u2014who said, \" Pa,pa, ma\nhas a little baby in bed with her.\" \"Nonsense, 'Bah.' What makes you\n\fApril, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 63\nthink that ? \" asked the father. \" Because I saw it laying beside her in the\nbed,\" the child replied.\nThe next morning, having some business with Mr. C, I visited hisranche,\nabout one mile distant from my farm. With considerable relish and amuse\nment he related his dream to me. Coming from a child so young, who could\nnot possibly be aware of the condition of its mother, the time of whose con\nfinement was drawing near, yet not sufficiently near at hand (as was\nsupposed) to excite anxiety on the part of Mr. Crewdson owing to his enforced\nabsence, the dream impressed me at the time as being remarkable. Later\non, the same day, Mr. C. remained at my place, and took dinner, repeating\nthe dream to myself and family.\nStarting for home, while still in sight, he met the young man (Mr.\nMorgan) he had left in charge at Tuckerville, who informed him that Mrs.\nCrewdson had given birth to a child during the night, about the hour he had\nbeen awakened by the child to hear his dream. Mr. C. hurried on home.

The case thus became one of the comparatively\nrare but important class distinguished in Phantasms of the Living as\n\" reciprocal \" cases. He also noted, as interesting and somewhat\npeculiar, Dr Backman's experience that he could make his clairvoyants\nremember after waking the impressions they had received in trance,\nand that they could sometimes supplement the information they had\ngiven in trance, through their greater power of co-ordinating their ideas\nin a waking state.\nHYPNOTISM AS AN ANAESTHETIC IN PRACTICE\nIN ENGLAND.\nDuring the last few months there have been some records in the\nEnglish medical Press of the successful application of hypnotism by\nthree Members of this Society, in some cases where pain would other\nwise have been acute. Dr. J. Milne Bramwell, of Goole, demonstrated\nabout a year ago {Brit. Med. Journal, April 5th, 1890, p. 801), to many\nof the leading doctors and dentists of Leeds and the neighbourhood,\nhow practicable it was to produce by hypnotism complete anaesthesia to\nthe pain of extraction of the stumps of sixteen teeth at one operation,\nor to the surgical dressing of a large, deep-seated abscess in the cheek.\nTo some patients who had been previously often hypnotised, it was\nsufficient to send a command by letter that they should go to sleep at\nonce and obey the dentist's orders during an operation, and such a\ncommand was cheerfully and intelligently obeyed, and no pain felt\nwhilst three double teeth were drawn. Again, to a large meeting last\nFebruary (Brit. Med. Journal, February 28th, 1891, pp. 460-468) of the\nLeeds and West Riding Medico Chirurgical Society, Dr. Bramwell\nshowed a case in which Mr. H. Bendelack Hewetson had performed the\nsurgical operation for correcting a squint under the anaesthesia of\nhypnotism only ; and Mr. Hewetson called attention to the fact that\nhe had found such anaesthesia complete in many other surgical operations\non the eye. Dr. Bramwell also illustrated the use of patient repetition\nof attempts at hypnotisation by giving the history of a patient of his\nwho had suffered for many months most distressing discomfort from a\ndisease of the skin, and whom he had tried to hypnotise 67 times\nwithout success. On the 68th trial, however, he had succeeded in pro\nducing complete somnambulism, and in putting an end to the discomfort\nentirely and for good.\n\fG8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1891.\nDr. G. C. Kingsbury, of Blackpool, has also found hypnotic\nanaesthesia useful in various ways, notably in the case of a girl who\nwas expecting a dangerous and painful confinement before she was\nfifteen (Brit. Med. Journal, 1891, p. 460). He found her a good\nsubject, and prudently trained her to obey his orders by hypnotising\nher twelve times, and satisfied himself of the complete anaesthesia pro\nduced. At the first signs of the birth of the child he found no\ndifficulty in keeping her for four hours in a state of hypnotic somnam\nbulism, in which she felt no pain at all, but would receive and obey his\norders. She passed through the whole of a critical period without\nconsciousness and without danger, and, after the birth of a healthy\nchild, was awakened to find herself without pain and without recol\nlection of pain. A. T. M.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL. 876. Ae P\"\nThe following instance of a visual impression, of a communication\nwhich the agent was at the moment anxious to make to the per\ncipient, is analogous to some auditory cases printed in the Journals for\nMarch and April. It is sent to us by Mr. Robert Lodge, Associate of\nthe Society. The letters are addressed to him by a relative :\u2014.\n50, Adelaide Square, Bedford, February 17th, 1891.\nIn answer to your request I send you account about the telegram.\nOn the 27th of April, 1889, we were expecting my sister-in-law and her\ndaughter from South America. My wife, being away from home, was unable\nto meet them at Southampton, so an intimate friend of the family, a Mr. P. ,\noffered to do so. It was between Derby and Leicester about 3.30 p.m. My\nwife was travelling in the train. She closed her eyes to rest, and at the\nsame moment a telegram paper appeared before her with the words,- ' ' Come\nat once, your sister is dangerously ill.\" During the afternoon I received a\ntelegram from Mr. P. to my wife, worded exactly the same and sent from\nSouthampton 3.30 p.m. to Bedford. On my wife's arrival home about 9 p.m.,\nI deferred communicating it until she had some refreshment, being very\ntired. I afterwards made the remark, \"I have some news for you,\" and\nshe answered, \"Yes, I thought so, you have received a telegram from Mr.\nP. ! \" I said, \" How do you know 1 \" She then told me the contents and\nher strange experiences in the train, and that it impressed her so much that\nshe felt quite anxious all the rest of the journey.\nWith regard to the above, my wife had no idea of her sister being ill, and\nwas not even at the time thinking about them, but was thinking about her\nown child she had just left at a boarding school. Also the handwriting my\nwife saw, she recognised at once to be Mr. P. 's. But then, again, he would\nhave been writing on a white paper form, and the one she saw was the\nusual brown coloured paper. Frepk, L. Lodge.\n\fMay, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 69\nIn reply to inquiries, Mr. F. Lodge wrote as follows :\u2014\nThe letter I sent you, with account of vision, I wrote from my wife's\ndictation. After it occurred in the train she took notice of the hour, and\nfrom the time marked on the telegram of its despatch from Southampton, we\nat once remarked it must have occurred as Mr. P. was filling in a form at\nSouthampton. Mr. P. is now in South America constructing a railway\nline, and will not return to England for about a year. The occurrence\nwas mentioned to him.\nTwo years having elapsed, my wife could not say the exact time now, but\nit was between 3 and 4 p.m., although when it happened, we did notice from\nthe telegram that the time corresponded. Fbedk. L. Lodge.\nThe two following cases, in both of which the same percipient was\nconcerned, come to us through the American Branch of the Society.\nIn the first, the conscious desire of the agent seems to have been the\npredetermining cause of the percipient's impression, and in this it\nresembles the preceding case.\nL. 877. Ae Pn Motor impulse.\nThe percipient, Mrs. Hadselle, writes to Mr. Hodgson as follows :\u2014.\n28, Bradford Street, Pittsfield, Mass., May 28th, 1888.\nLess than two years ago a curious thing happened to me. I had been in\nWash. Co., N.Y., giving half a dozen readings, and was on my way to\nWilliamstown, where I had spent a part of the summer, and where much of my\nworldly goods, in the shape of wearing apparel, was safely stowed in my room\nat the \"Mansion House.\" With ticket purchased, I was serenely seated in\nthe car, ' ' box, bundle, and bag \" beside me, the conductor's ' 'All aboard \" was\nat that instant in my ears, when I sprang to my feet with the force of an\ninward command, \" Change your ticket and go to Elizabeth (N.J.). Change\nyour ticket and go to Elizabeth. Change your \" Here a gentleman in the\nopposite seat\u2014an utter stranger\u2014rose and said: \"Madam, have you for\ngotten something, can I help you 1 \" I said : ' ' Do you think the train will\nwait for me to change my ticket 1 \" For there appeared to be no alternative.\nAs I spoke I moved towards the platform ; he followed, and seeing that the\noffice was but a few steps distant said : \" Go, I'll see that you are not left.\"\nI did go, and in a moment more was on my way to Elizabeth, though I had not\nbefore even thought of such a thing. Next morning, on reaching my friend's\nhouse, she threw her arms about me and sobbed out : ' ' Oh, I have wanted\nyou so.\" Then she led me to a room where an only and beloved sister lay\nin life's last battle. In an hour it was ended.\nMy poor grief-stricken friend declared then\u2014declares now\u2014that my\nsudden change of purpose was a direct answer to her repeated though\nunspoken demand for my presence. And who shall say it was not ? I wish\nto add that while I had learned by letter of the sister's illness of a chronic\ndisorder, I did not suppose her case hopeless ; indeed from the fact that no\ntidings had reached me lately, was hoping that she was on the road to\nrecovery, and had I been questioned concerning her that 10th of November,\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1891.\n1886, should have replied confidently, \" She will without doubt last through\nthe winter.\" My friend, by the way, is, much more than I, a believer in\npsychical phenomena.\n(Signed) C. A. C. Hadsellb.\nMr. Hodgson writes :\u2014\nMrs. G.\u2014the friend referred to\u2014has sent me her corroboration dated\nMarch 5th, 1890. The date of the incident, she states, was November 11th,\n1886. She says :\u2014\n\"I had not expected Mrs. H. ; did not at that time know where she\nwas, so could not have summoned her had I wished to do so,\u2014tbut in my\ntrouble there grew upon me a great desire for her presence, and I said many\ntimes, ' If she only would come. If she were only here.'\n\"My sister's failure at the last was somewhat rapid, but of this Mrs. H.\nknew nothing, and when she told me of her sudden change of purpose,\nhundreds of miles away, I said, ' The impulse was sent you in answer to my\nwish,' or words to that effect.\"\nThe gentleman who helped Mrs. Hadselle to change her ticket, the\nRev. James Wilson, then of Greenwich, N.Y., writes in answer to Mr.\nHodgson's inquiries :\u2014\nMarch 20th, 1890.\nI recollect the circumstance of \" assisting a lady \" at Greenwich ticket\noffice, who exchanged her ticket at the last moment, because of a change of\npurpose ; and it was in November, 1886. She sent me a few lines after\nwards, detailing certain facts touching a sick friend at the point of her\ndestination\u2014not clearly recalled at this moment.\nJ. T. Wilson.\nL. 878. Ae Pn Impression.\nMrs. Hadselle sent at the same time another narrative, of which she\nsaid :\u2014\nI send you with this a bit of experience which I had years ago\u2014so long\nago indeed as the time Dr. Holland edited the Springfield Republican.\nHe wrote me that the \"Warning\" was copied from Maine to California, and\nthat he received many letters asking if it was authentic. To this he could\nsafely reply, as I was an old-time contributor to that and other leading\njournals. A local paper lately copied it. Many of the then witnesses have\nwith Dr. Holland and my darling \"Eddie \" (Kleber Loomis Hadselle) gone\nover to the \"great majority,\" but there are several still living who remember\nthe episode, and no one of my acquaintances doubts or thinks the sketch\noverdrawn.\nThe account is taken from the Berkshire County Eagle, May 10th,\n1888, Pittsfield, Mass., and headed \"The Unspoken Warning\u2014A\nMother's Experience.\"\nOne bitter oold day in winter a merry party of us, nestled down under\nfurry robes, went to meet an appointment with a friend living a few miles\n\fMay, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 71\ndistant, with whom we were to spend the afternoon and in the evening attend\naa concert to be held near by. The sleighing was delightful, the air keen and\ninspiriting, the host and hostess genial as the crackling fires in the grates,\nand the invited guests, of whom there were many besides ourselves, in that\npeculiar visiting trim which only old-time friends, long parted, can enjoy.\nRestraint was thrown aside ; we cracked jokes ; we chattered like magpies,\nand not a little of the coming concert, which promised a rare treat to our\nunsophisticated ears. All went merry as a marriage bell, and merrier than\nsome, till just before tea, when I was seized with a sudden and unaccountable\ndesire to go home, accompanied by a dread or fear of something, I knew not\nwhat, which made the return appear, not a matter of choice, but a thing\nimperative. I tried to reason it away, to revive anticipations of the concert ;\nI thought of the disappointment it would be to those who came with me to\ngive it up, and running over in my mind the condition in which things were\nleft at home, could find no ground for alarm.\nFor many years a part of the house had been rented to a trusty family ;\nour children were often rocked in the same cradle, and half of the time eat\nat the same table ; locks and bolts wore things unused, and in deed as in\nword we were neighbours. In their care had been left a boy of ten years,\nthe only one of the family remaining at home, who knew that when he\nreturned from school he was expected to bring in wood and kindlings for the\nmorning fire, take supper alone, or with little Clara E., as he chose, and\notherwise pass the time as he pleased, only that he must not go into the street\nto play, or on to the pond to skate. He had been left many times in this\nway, and had never given occasion for the slightest uneasiness ; still, as this\nnameless fear grew upon me, it took the form of a conviction that danger of\nsome sort threatened this beloved child.\nI was rising to go and ask Mr. A. to take me home, when someone said,\n\" You are very pale ; are you ill ? \" \"No,\" I answered, and dropping back\nin the chair, told them how strangely I had been exercised for the last few\nminutes ; adding, \"I really must go home.\" There was a perfect chorus of\nvoices against it, and for a little time I was silenced though not convinced.\nSomeone laid the matter before Mr. A., who replied, \"Nonsense ; Eddie is a\ngood boy to mind, will do nothing in our absence that he would not do if we\nwere there, and is enjoying himself well at this moment, I'll warrant.\" This\nanswer was brought to me in triumph, and I resolved to do as they said,\n\" not to think about it.\" But at tea my trembling hand almost refused to\ncarry food to my lips, and I found it utterly impossible to swallow a mouth\nful. A death-like chill crept over me, and I knew that every eye was on\nme as I left the room. Mr. A. rose, saying in a changed voice and without\nceremony, \"Make haste ; bring the horse round, we must go right away.\nI never saw her in such a state before; there is something in it.\" He\nfollowed me to the parlour, but before he could speak I was pleading as for\ndear life that not a moment be lost in storting for home. \"I know,\" said I,\n\"it is not all imagination, and whether it is or not I shall certainly die, if\nthis dreadful incubus is not removed shortly.\"\nAll was now confusion : the tea table deserted, the meal scarce tested ;\nand my friends, alarmed ax much at my looks as at my words, were as anxioue\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1891.\nto hurry me off as they had been before to detain me. To me those terrible\nmoments seemed hours, yet I am assured that not more than half an hour\nelapsed from the time my fears first found expression before we were on the\nroad toward home. A horse somewhat noted for fleetness was before us,\nand with only two in the cutter\u2014the rest stayed to concert, and made Mr.\nA. promise that if nothing had happened we would return\u2014went over the\nroad at a rapid pace. I knew from the frequent repetition of a peculiar\nsignal that the beast was being urged to his best, yet I grew sick with\nimpatience at the restraint. I wanted to fly. All this while my fears had\ntaken no definite shape. I only knew that the child was in danger, and felt\nimpelled to hurry to the rescue. Only once was the silence broken in that\nthree mile journey, and that was when the house was in full view, I said,\n\" Thank God, the house is not on fire.\" \"That was my own thought,\" said\nMr. A., but there was no slackening of speed.\nOn nearing home a cheerful light was glimmering from Mrs. E.'s window ;\nbefore the vehicle had fairly stopped we were clear of it, and opening the\ndoor, said in the same breath, \" Where's Eddie 1 \" \"Eddie 1 why, he was\nhere a little while ago,\" answered Mrs. E., pleasantly striving to dissipate\nthe alarm she saw written on our countenances. \"He eat supper with the\nchildren, and played awhile at marbles ; then spoke of Libby Rose having\na new picture book, and that he wanted to see it. You'll find him over\nthere.\" With swift steps Mr. A. crossed the street to the place mentioned,\nbut returned with \" he has not been there.\" Eddie was remarkably fond of\nskating, and my next thought was that he had been tempted to disobedience.\nI said calmly, \" We will go to the pond.\" I was perfectly collected; I could\nhave worked all night without fatigue with the nerves in that state of ten\nsion ; but Mr. A. said, \" No, you must go in and lie down. Eddie is safe\nenough, somewhere about the village. I'll go and find him.\" But there\nwas nothing in the tone as in the words to reassure me.\nAs he spoke he crossed the hall to our own room and turned the knob.\nThe door was locked. What could that mean 1 Eddie was either on the\ninside or had taken the key away with him. Mr. A. ran round to a window\nwith a broken spring which could be opened from the outside. It went up\nwith a clang, but a dense volume of smoke drove him back. After an\ninstant another attempt was made, and this time, on a lounge directly under\nthe window, he stumbled on the insensible form of little Eddie, smothered\nin smoke. Limp and apparently lifeless he was borne into the fresh cold\nair, and after some rough handling was restored to consciousness.\nEddie said, on returning from school, he made a good fire, and as the\nwood was snowy thought he would put it in the oven to dry ; something he\nhad never done before. Then on leaving Mrs. E.'s room he went in for an\napple before going to see Libby Rose's picture book, and it seemed so nice\nand warm he thought he would lie down a while. He could give no explana\ntion as to what prompted him to turn the key : it was the first and last time ;\nbut this could have made no difference in the result, for no one would have\ndiscovered the smoke in time to save his life. The wood in the oven was\nburned to ashes, but as the doors were closed there was no danger of falling\nembers setting the house on fire ; and had we stayed to the concert every\n\fMay, isoi.] Joilrnat of Society for Psychical Research. 73\nthing would have been as when we left, except that little Eddie's voice would\nnever more have made music for our ears.

The nurse, although she had been expressly forbidden to do so,\nhad taken the child into her own bed to nurse it, and having gone to sleep,\nhad all but smothered it. Monsieur Pokitonoff drew out the child from\nbeneath the nurse, blue and not breathing. They had much difficulty in\nbringing it back to life again.

I also see a tall, pale lady writing to you ; I think you will be\ncalled away from here soon.\" I could not connect it with anyone, although\nthe \" tall, pale lady \" might be my daughter.\nThe next morning I received a letter from my daughter in Indiana,\n1,100 miles away, that her husband was quite ill\u2014and the next morning\n(Thursday) received a telegram that he had died a little after 12 o'clock\nmidnight\u2014and before that night I was on my way eastward.\nMy son-in-law, a Presbyterian minister, greatly beloved by his congrega\ntion, died after a very short illness of pneumonia ; and the description of\nhis surroundings (as far as they went) were perfectly correct, even to my\naughter's writing to me, which was taking place at or very near the time\nMrs. L. saw it.\nI did not even think of connecting her \"vision\" with my son, as he\nwas apparently a robust man, and I had had no intimation of his illness.\nHow did Mrs. L. see what was passing 1, 100 miles away ? There was no\ntelepathy, unless she perceived my daughter's thought reaching out to me.\nI don't understand it.\nLater, Mrs. T. adds :\u2014\nJanuary 27th, 1891.\nYour note of the 22nd inst. at hand. As evidential value, it would\nperhaps be better for you to communicate direct with the ladies present when\nMrs. Logue told me of her clairvoyant \"vision.\" It was a picture presented,\nor vision, which she declared, \" I saw as plainly as I see you now.\" She\nsaid the next day, when I met her accidentally, and told her that I had\nreceived news of my son-in-law's illness, \"I saw even more than I told\nyou, but you did not seem to recognise it\u2014I am sure you will be called\naway.\" Others coming up, she did not say what more she saw.\nIn the confusion caused by receipt of telegram, I did not think of preserv\ning it, nor did I make any \"notes,\" as I was unacquainted at the time with\nany possible value they might have in the future.

T.\nThe following accounts are from the other ladies present :\u2014\nDenver, Colo., February 23rd, 1891.\nIn the spring of 1888 I organised a circle or a class of ladies for the study\nand development of clairvoyance, clairaudience, and psychometry. All were\nstudents of spiritual phenomena, meeting one afternoon each week. I will\nonly speak now of our last meeting, as it proved to be. We usually sat\naround a small table, with paper, slates, and pencils for writing. After\nsitting quietly for a short time my hand was controlled to write in verse a\nfew lines which I have forgotten now, but they were a prophecy that that\nwould be our last meeting. Then almost for the rest of the sitting all\ninfluences seemed to surround Mrs. T. I saw and described several spirit\nforms, giving some names, one whom she recognised as her mother, I giving\nthe mother's name, at the same time repeating the verse of a hymn. Mrs.\nT. said it was a favourite hymn of her mother, who repeated it in her dying\nhour. So it went on, the influences or controls quoting passages from the\nBible and hymns, all of a consoling nature, as though they were trying to\nprepare her mind for a sad event, or for what did follow, the death of her\ndaughter's husband, but we did not understand it at the time. After sitting\nour usual time, we got up from the table. While Mrs. T. was standing\nbefore me talking, a great flash of light passed before my face, seeming to\ntransfix my gaze, and I saw a room with two persons in it ; one a man lying\non a cot or invalid's chair, quite sick ; the other a woman sitting at a table\nand writing hurriedly, and so anxiously it seemed I could read her thoughts\nbefore she penned them down. As to the result of the man's sickness, it\npassed before my eyes, and I was once more myself among my class. I\nhesitated about speaking to Mrs. T., though I knew it was for her, but\nfinally said, \" Mrs. T., is there any one sick in your family ? \" She thought\na moment and said not that she knew ; all were well the last letters from\nhome. \" Why, what do you see ? is it for me?\" I then told the class what\nI had seen, and received the impression that it was a son of Mrs. T. 's ; that\nit was a sudden and serious sickness ; that a letter had been written and was\non the way to her ; she would be sent for and leave the city in a short time,\nwhich all proved true. She received the letter the next day, telling her of\nher son-in-law's serious illness. As soon as Mrs. T. received the letter, she\ncame to me to see if I could tell her any more. I told her to prepare her\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

E. Rourke.\nDenver, February 27th, 1891.\nI gladly comply with your request to write an account of my recollection\nof the clairvoyant vision of Mrs. M. A. Logue recounted to you by\nMrs. S. T.\nThe event occurred about three years ago (the exact date I do not\nremember), at the last of a series of sittings of some two months' duration,\nin which Mrs. T., Mrs. Rourke, Mrs. Logue, and myself participated\nregularly, Mrs. Logue being recognised by those who know her as both an\nexcellent woman and medium, or sensitive. At this particular meeting, after\na few moments' silence, Mrs. Logue laughed and said, \"Well, I don't know\nwhat it means, but I'll give it to you as I get it,\" and therewith read a\ncomical little rhyme, which her hand had been used to write, the purport of\nwhich was that this was to be the last meeting of our little circle. Toward\nthe close of the sitting she saw and described a sick man in an invalid's chair,\nand said she thought he was soon to \"pass over,\" and also saw sitting at a\ntable writing with seeming haste and anxiety, a lady, whom she said she saw\nso distinctly that she should recognise her if she should ever see her. She\ntold Mrs. T. that she would be called away very suddenly, she thought before\nthe close of the week, on account of this death, which was to occur to some\none nearly connected with her, she thought a son. The next day Mrs. T.\nreceived information from her daughter of the very severe illness of the\nlatter's husband, whose death occurred before the close of the week, which\nevent caused Mrs. T. to leave Denver for Ind., and thus was fulfilled the\nrhyming prophecy given us at the opening of our circle, as we have never\nall met since that day. L. C. D.\nWe add an account of a seemingly premonitory vision, interesting\nas being experienced by the same percipient. As evidence for the\nreality of supernormal premonitions, however, the case is far from\nstrong, because the circumstances were too likely to suggest such a\nvision ; as Mrs. Hartzell perceived when told of it.\nP. CI. 136.\nRichard Hodgson, Esq. Denver, Col., Febmary 23rd, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014Can you or some one explain this 1 Some six or seven years\nago I had a dear friend who was a ladies' nurse. At this time she was\nengaged, and living with a lady whom I shall call Mrs. K., who expected to\nbe confined at almost any moment. One night my friend called to see me to\nchat a few moments, I living only a few blocks from Mrs. K. I was going\nout when she came, going to see a friend. I invited her to go with me.\nShe said she would if I would promise not to stay long. Promising her I\nwould not, we went. Arriving at my friend's house, they wanted me to sit\nfor them. We formed a circle, the lady of the house, her husband, myself,\n\fMay, 189].] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 77\nand friend. After sitting a short time, I saw the form of a woman stretched\nout on a bed as one dead. At first I could not see the face plainly, for about\nthe faoe or jaws was a cloth, pinned under the jaw on one side of the face,\nwith one end of the cloth hanging loosely down. I looked at it for a few\nmoments ; I then could distinguish the features, and as I looked closely, I\nrecognised the form and features of Mrs. K. It so disturbed me that I made\nsome excuse and left the table, telling them what I saw, but not telling who\nit was or looked like. When I left the house I told the nurse what I had\nseen, and that it was Mrs. K. laid out as if she were dead. The nurse\nlaughed at me, although a medium herself, as well as having full faith and\nknowledge in my mediumship, saying, \"Now, Mrs. Logue, you only imagine\nthis because you think I ought to be at home with Mrs. K. \" I said, \" No,\nMrs. Hartzell.\" (The name of the nurse.) Arriving at my home, bidding\nher good-night, she went on to Mrs. K., whom she found fast asleep, this\nbeing about ten o'clock p.m. The nurse found everything quiet and went to\nbed, but not to sleep. In a short time Mrs. K. called to her, telling her to\nget up, her hour of trial was at hand. (I will here say that Mrs. K. was a\ngreat, strong Irishwoman, who had given birth to one or two children, and\nhad no thought of fear as to the result.) She was taken violently sick,\nand in about two hours was delivered of a beautiful, big baby boy. But\nalmost with the birth of the baby, the spirit of the mother was born into\nlife everlasting. It came so suddenly, so unexpectedly even to the doctor,\nthat there was no time to summon priest or bishop.\nI was sent for, and went to perform the last duties for the dead, and\nwhen I went into the room, there was Mrs. K. on a bed cold in death, and\nlying in the exact position in which I had seen her clairvoyantly, some three\nhours before, with a cloth pinned around the face or jaw, with one end\nhanging loosely down.\n(Signed) Mrs. M. A. Logue.\nMrs. E. Hartzell.\nIn another letter Mrs. Logue adds :\u2014\nSuch things have been so frequent and are all the time, that I myself\nseldom speak of them unless I am brought right in contact with the parties.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\" G \" CASES.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir,\u2014I would like to know the reason why the large and, in my opinion,\nmost interesting class of cases coming under the \" G \" division seem\nabsolutely tabooed both in your Journal and Proceedings. No doubt Mrs.\nPiper and Dr. Phinuit are both useful and interesting in their own sphere as\nthrowing light on a very important and obscure branch of our Society's\nresearches, but to the general public, to the people whose interest and\nsympathy we are striving to enlist, they are somewhat tedious if not\nabsolutely unreadable, whereas after-death appearances and the phenomena\naccompanying them are not alone most interesting and instructive to all, but\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Johnson-Roberts (A.S.P.R.).\n146, Pembroke Road, Dublin.\nApril 17th, 1891.\n[Our correspondent is quite mistaken in supposing that \"G\" cases are\ntabooed in the Proceedings or Journal. The last volume of the Proceedings\n(Vol. VI.) contained two papers on Phantasms of the Dead (\" G \" cases), and\nVol. V. contained one paper on the same subject. Further, fourteen cases\nof the \"G\" class were printed in the last volume of the Journal. Another\ngroup of cases is now being reserved for a further paper which Mr. Myers\nhas in preparation, as we do not usually print in the Journal cases which\nare likely to appear soon in the Proceedings.\nOur correspondent's reference to Professor Alexander's paper, however,\nsuggests that he is not thinking only of \"G\" cases, but also of accounts of\nalleged movements of objects without contact. If so, he will be glad to learn\nthat a series of narratives of this kind, including Professor Alexander's,\nwhich have been before the Committee formed to consider the phenomena\ncommonly called Spiritualistic, have been put together by Mr. Myers and are\nnow ready for publication in the next number of the Proceedings. The\ngreater part of this paper has been read at different times to meetings of\nthe Society.\nThere is one part of our correspondent's letter with which we feel bound\nto express disagreement. We do not think that the articles in our Proceed\nings should be composed to suit the tastes of the general public. We are\nglad that popular articles should be written in magazines familiarising the\ngeneral reader with the subjects of our inquiries ; but as a Society with\nscientific aims we have to address ourselves primarily, not to the general\nreader, but to those who genuinely wish to ascertain the truth by indepen\ndent study and are willing to go through the labour required to attain this\nresult.\u2014Ed.]\nCLAIRVOYANCE FORTY YEARS AGO.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSIB\u00bb After my paper on the Evidence for Clairvoyance in the Part\nof the Proceedings just issued was ready for printing off, and when no\n\fMay, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 79\naddition could be made without delaying publication, some further facta\noame to my knowledge about the case of clairvoyance at Peterhead,\n(Proceedings, XVIII., pp. 49-54) ; which, though they do not add to the\nevidence for clairvoyance, are of some interest, and which I should, therefore,\nbe glad to be allowed now to lay before Members of the Society.\nIt appears that Mr. Reid's account of the hypnotic seance of April 23rd,\n1850, published in the Aberdeen Herald of May 18th, 1850, ends with the\nfollowing sentence, not published in my paper :\u2014a\n\" He [Park] also visited the vessel Traveller of this port and was told that\nshe had got her bows injured among the ice.\"\nMr. Boyd writes as to this :\u2014\n\" I have no recollection of having heard, and I cannot find on inquiry,\nthat the statement by the clairvoyant that the Traveller had sustained damage\nfrom the ice had been proved to be correct ; and probably it had not been so,\nand the vessel had not been injured. But, I find that in 1848, two years\npreviously, that vessel (the Traveller) sustained serious injury to her bows\nfrom the ice while in Greenland, which must have been widely known in\nPeterhead in 1848, and it no doubt was so to Reid and Park in 1850.\nCertainly the Traveller sustained no important injury in 1850.\"\nIt seems probable, therefore, that Park's statement about the Traveller\nwas founded on a reminiscence, and this adds force to the suggestion\nthat his statement about the injury to Oardno's hand may have had a\nsimilar origin.

W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, S. C. Scott, and\nH. A. Smith.\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting were read and signed as correct.\nTwo new Members and eight new Associates, whose names and\naddresses are given above, were elected. The election of twelve new\nAssociates of the American Branch was also recorded.\nThe name of Mrs. Mulholland, recently elected, was, at her request,\ntransferred from the list of Associates to that of Members.\nTwo books presented to the Library were on the table, for which\nthanks were accorded to the donor.\nIt was decided that the date of the General Meeting in July should\nbe altered from Friday, the 10th, to Friday, the 17th.\nVarious matters of business having been attended to, it was\nagreed that the next Meeting of the Council should be at the West\nminster Town Hall, at 3 p.m., on Friday, the 17th of July, previous to\nthe General Meeting on that day.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 4Gth General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, May 29th, at 8.30 p.m., the President\nin the chair.\nThe President, after a few remarks on a paper by Mr. Alfred\nRussel Wallace in the Arena, in which Mr. Wallace brought forward\nspirit photographs as a proof of the objectivity of apparitions, and\nchallenged the Society to deal with the evidence for it, called on Mr\nPodmore to read a paper by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick on \" Spirit Photo\ngraphs.\" It was shown in this paper, among other things, that the\nprincipal professional spirit photographers had been guilty of fraud in\nthe matter, and that in the case of Mr. Beattie\u2014the disinterested\ninvestigator whose private experiments were regarded by believers in\nspirit photographs as the most important that had been made\u2014it\nseemed possible that he had been imposed upon by his assistant.\nThere remained a single photograph obtained by Professor Wagner,\nof St. Petersburg, where trickery seemed very improbable, but where\nMrs. Sidgwick thought the mark resembling a deformed hand, which\nappeared on the plate above the figure of the medium, might be due\nto an unnoticed reflection off the wall or furniture.\nMb- W. Leaf said that it was remarkable that there were so few\n\fJune, 18UJ.J Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 83\naccounts published of experiments in spirit photography in these days\nwhen the taking of photographs had been made so easy for amateurs.\nHe had examined the reproductions of Mr. Beattie's photographs given\nby M. Aksakof in his Animismus und Spiritismus. Anyone wishing\nto trick and having access to a modern gelatine plate could make\nsimilar marks by means of a finger wet with a little ammonia, and in\nother ways. He said that he had himself visited the studio of a\nsupposed spirit photographer, some accounts of whose photographs\nhave been published. She had declined to see him herself, having been\ntold by her \" guides \" to keep in retirement, but had allowed him to\nexamine her studio, and he had there seen two negatives which in\ncombination made a \" spirit photograph,\" which he also saw. Whether\nthis very palpable evidence of the manufacture of \" spirit photographs \"\nhad been left for his inspection by design, he could not, of course, say.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then discussed certain \" Problems of Per\nsonality.\" Reminding his hearers of the success of Professor James'\nand Mr. Hodgson's experiment of hypnotising Ansel Bourne, in order\nto revive the memory of his secondary or \" A. J. Brown \" condition,\nhe pointed out that this was an application of hypnotism in what he\nconsidered its most significant aspect,\u2014namely, as an empirical method\nof reaching the subliminal self\u2014those strata of the personality which\nlie below the threshold of ordinary waking consciousness.\nThe speaker urged that very many phenomena, apparently isolated\nand disparate, might be rationally colligated by regarding them as\n\" messages \" sent up from the subliminal to the superficial or empiri\ncal self. These messages might be nonsensical, as in dream or delirium,\nor they might contain new truths,\u2014as in telepathic and clairvoyant\ncases,\u2014but there was a general resemblance between the modes of\nmanifestation of the false messages and the true. All such messages,\nfalsidical as well as veridical, might be divided into four classes, with\nreference to their modes of manifestation,\u2014the way in which they\nrose into the cognisance of the superficial self. There was first a class\nof impressions, neither definitely sensory nor definitely motor, but\ncapable of being developed into either of those classes. Secondly, there\nwas a class of sensory messages\u2014visual and auditory phantasms, and\nthe like. To these, as distinguished from the motor messages, the title\nof passive automatism might be given. Then came the motor messages\n\u2014automatic writing and the like\u2014which constituted active automatism.\nAnd, lastly, there were cases like Ansel Bourne's, where the \"messages\"\n\u2014alike sensory and motor\u2014had usurped the place of the superficial\nconsciousness.\nAfter some further discussion of these \" messages \" with reference\nto their content, the speaker read a curious case, sent by Mr. Hensleigh\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June. ism.\nWedgwood, where a long message had been automatically written as\nto facts alleged to have occurred in 1605\u2014which facts were afterwards\nverified as having actually occurred,\u2014although there was good reason\nto believe that the automatist had never become aware of them by\nordinary methods.\nSome questions were asked about what Mr. Myers had said, after\nwhich\nMr. Barkworth spoke of the great need of more experiments. In\nparticular he suggested that it would be very interesting to ascertain\nwhether any memory of what had occurred during unconsciousness\ncaused by an accident or by anesthetics could be recovered by\nhypnotism. This was an experiment which medical men might have\nopportunities of trying.\nMr. W. Boyd, who sent to the Society an interesting case of\nclairvoyance, published in the last number of the Proceedings, made a\nfew remarks on the importance of any good evidence about psychical\nmatters being brought forward and published, if only because the\npublication of one case led to the discovery of others.\nPHOTOGRAPHING INDIAN CONJURERS.\nWe have received several communications in answer to the note on\nthis subject, which we printed in the last number of the Journal,\nmost of which point to an article published in the Chicago Daily\nTribune for August, 1890, as the original authority for the statements to\nwhich we referred. In default of further evidence it must, we think,\nbe concluded that the writers who have given currency to these state\nments had no better evidence for them than a fictitious narrative,\nsubsequently, as will be seen, avowed to be such.\nThe article in question, which occupies nearly two columns of the\npaper, sets forth how Mr. Frederick S. Ellmore, \" son of W. S.\nEllmore, a well-known coffee broker of this city ... a pleasant-\nfaced, light-haired young man of 26 ... an '86 Yale man,\" made\na two years' trip round the world, and being a rather enthusiastic\namateur photographer, carried his beloved kodak with him. In Paris\nhe joined a college class-mate, a young New Yorker, George Lessing, an\nartist, and together they went on through Europe and Asia.\nThe article continues with an account of an interview with \" a\nTribune man,\" in which Mr. Ellmore is made to describe how he and\nLessing in India were constantly on the alert for some first-class\njuggler, and at length at Gaya came across a fakir. Ellmore had been\nimpressed by the theory that the explanation of all these alleged super\n\fJune, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 85\nnatural performances would be found in hypnotism, and they proposed\nthe following plan to test his theory. While the fakir was going\nthrough his performances, Lessing was to make a rapid pencil sketch\nof what he saw, Ellmore at the same moment taking a snapshot with\nhis kodak.\nThe article goes on to describe the mango trick, the production of\na baby under a shawl, and a boy climbing a cord thrown up into the\nsky.\n\"I had no facilities,\" continues Mr. Ellmore, \"for developing the kodak\nfilms, and it was these Lessing took with him, as well as a thousand or more\nother negatives, to be developed. The fakir pictures, with a few others, I\nreceived this afternoon. After the fakir's departure, Lessing filled in his\nsketches and these he left with me. You'll see by comparing the ones\nLessing made with the photographs that in no instance did the camera\nrecord the marvellous features of the performance. For instance, Lessing's\nsketch shows the tree grown from the bush, while the camera shows there\nwas no bush there. Lessing saw a baby and so did I, and he has got it in\nhis sketch, but the camera demonstrates that there was no baby. Lessing's\nsketch of the boy climbing the twine is evidence that he saw it, but the\ncamera says there was no boy and no twine. From which I'm compelled to\nbelieve that my theory is absolutely correct\u2014that Mr. Fakir had simply\nhypnotised the entire crowd, but couldn't hypnotise the camera.\"\nThe article was accompanied by six woodcuts illustrating the alleged\ndifferences between the photographs taken by the kodak and the\nsketches made by the artist.\nMr. Hodgson writes :\u2014.\nI saw the article shortly after it appeared, and was satisfied that it\nwas a fabrication. I saw the mango trick frequently when in India, and\nlearned the details of its modus operandi. It is an ordinary, though very\ndexterous, sleight-of-hand performance. I did not see the other tricks\ndescribed (or mis-described) in the article. The story of the boy climbing\nthe rope and disappearing is, in one form or another, very old, and I made\nmany inquiries in India concerning it, but failed to meet any person who\nhad witnessed anything that might have served as a foundation for the story.\nColonel Olcott stated that ho had met a person who had seen it, and added\nthat on one occasion a somewhat distant spectator had climbed a tree whence\nhe could see the juggler's movements but could not \"catch\" the juggler's\nwords. The near spectators were said to have averred that the juggler with\na knife pursued the boy up the \" rope \" and disappeared. That the bleeding\nlimbs, trunk, &c., of the boy fell from \"nothing.\" That the juggler then\nappeared again, descending the rope, and that the fragments of the boy joined\nthemselves together and became whole. The spectater in the tree saw only\nthat the juggler was cutting up a vegetable belonging to the pumpkin order.\nColonel Olcott vouchsafed the explanation that a \" mesmeric glamour \" was\nthrown by the juggler over those spectators who could hear his words. I was\nunable to ascertain whether the story originated in the hallucinations of some\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1891.\nhypnotised witness, or whether it is merely a gross misdescription of some\nclever sleight-of-hand performance.\nBe this as it may, the coup de grace was given to the above article from\nthe CJiieago Daily Tribune by the following statement, which appeared in\nthe same paper in its issue of December 6th, 1890 :\u2014\n\"The article on hypnotism referred to . . . was written for the\npurpose of presenting a theory in an entertaining form. The writer believed\nthat hypnotism might be the secret of the art of the Indian jugglers, and\nembodied the idea in a sketch. The principal character was Mr. F. S.\nEllmore (sell-more), and the writer considered that the name would suggest\nto a careful reader that it was a ' sell. ' It seems, however, that a\nnumber of people who read the article in the Tribune and in the exchanges\nthat copied it accepted it as a solemn fact, and that it was eagerly seized\nupon by students of hypnotism as a demonstration of the perfection to\nwhich the science has been developed. While the sketch was a fancy one, it\nis suggested to those who recognised it as such that the idea contained in it\nmight profitably be tried to prove whether the creations of the juggler be\nphantoms or realities.\"\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL. 880.

He died at 2 a.m., and in a thunderstorm\u2014as tradition says that that\nfamily always do.\nVery shortly afterwards, but before we had talked about these facts, the\npoliceman who watched in the park told us that that night he had met in\nthe park one D., a carpenter employed at the great house, who had said,\n\"I have had such a turn, I expect I shall get the sack, I have just met Mr.\nK. in the park.\" The fact was that D. had been staying on at the house\nafter the servants' ball to court the kitchenmaid, to whom he was engaged,\nand he was afraid that Mr. K. would be angry at this. The policeman\nreplied to D. : \"Yes, I have just seen Mr. K. go up the steps,\" i.e., the\nsteps which led to our cottage. We afterwards saw D., and he told\nus the same story.

Hollow, jun.,\nof the firm of Hollow and Son, dealers in stoves, hardware, and furniture,\nboth doing business at this place. They, my wife, and I sat around a small\nwalnut centre table, placing our hands on its top surface in tho usual manner,\nand in about ten or fifteen minutes the table began to move, indicating the\npresence of our spirit friends, or some intelligence with the power to move\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The lamp was\nsitting on a piano in the corner of the room, turned down so as to make a\nsubdued or mellow light, but not so low but that we could see what time it\nwas by our watches as we sat at the table, or jot down the communications\nas they were spelled out.\nMr. Cottnam had a friend, Mr. Chris. Varis, a prominent hotel keeper\nof St. James, Phelps County, Mo., and a former resident of this place. His\ndisease was a chronic affection of the throat. Mr. C. had called on him a\nfew days previous and found him very weak and sinking fast. He could\ntake no solid food, and all the nourishment he got was by painful swallow\ning a little eggnog or milk. His attendant physician, Dr. Headlee, of St.\nJames, told Mr. Cottnam that he thought Mr. Varis could live but a few\ndays at most, and from his appearance Mr. Cottnam was of the same opinion.\nAfter many other questions were asked and answered, the table answering\nby tipping two of its feet two or three inches off the floor, and then striking\nit again, once for no, twice for don't know, and three times for yes, Mr. C.\nasked, \"Do you know my friend Chris. Varis, of St. James, Mo.?\" \"Yes.\"\n\"Is he any better than when I was with him last?\" \"No.\" \"Is he worse?\"\n\"Yes.\" \" Will I have time to get to him before he passes out if I take\nthe next train?\" \"Yes.\" \" Will he live over to-morrow ? \" \"Yes.\" \"Do\nyou know when he will pass out ? \" \"Yes.\" Then the table rocked back\nand forth slowly, the feet striking the floor forty times, making forty distinct\nraps, much to the surprise of all present, as we were expecting him to pass\nout much sooner. We counted, and found that the time indicated would be\nOctober 8th ; so to make sure we were right we asked, ' ' Will he pass out\non October 8th ? \" \"Yes.\" \" In the forenoon ? \" \"Yes.\" \" Will a\ntelegram be sent to me on the morning of the 8th to that effect ? \" \" Yes.'\nA night or two after the above described seance Mr. Cottnam sat at\nanother house with different sitters, and received the following confirmation\nof the above. He says : \"We had been sitting only a few minutes when\nthe table began to move. I asked, ' Is the spirit demonstrating a friend of\nmine?' 'Yes.' (Indicated by three distinct tips of the table.) 'Will\nyou spell your name ? ' ' Yes. ' The alphabet was called in the usual way,\nand the letters signalled by tips spelled Ben Walker. ' Are you my friend,\nBen Walker, of St. Louis?' 'Yes.' 'I was not aware of your demise;\nwhen did you pass out ? ' Three distinct tips. ' Doos that mean that it\nhas been three days since you passed out?' 'Yes.' 'Is your body buried ?

' \"\nMr. Cottnam was not aware of the death of Mr. Walker, and rather\ndoubted the truth of the message about him. The Globe Democrat of the\nnext day, however, confirmed the truth of his death and stated that the\ninterment was deferred until his son arrived from a distant city.\nThe prediction about Mr. Varis became an open secret, and was talked\nof freely through the town from the morning of August 30th until October\n8th, when a telegram camo over the wires informing Mr. C. that Mr. Varis\ndied that morning at six o'clock.\n\fJune, i891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

We had a nice little circle last night, in our parlour, and good\nphenomena, so far as table-tipping goes. Myself, wife, and two neighbours\ncomposed the circle.

T. SUDDICK.\n(This extract appeared in the Religio-Philosophical Journal.)\nDr. Suddick says that the letter was returned to him at his own\nrequest, and writes :\u2014\nYou will find that the first seven or eight lines were written August 29th\nand the remainder of the letter on the 30th, or part before and part after\nthe sitting.\nMrs. Suddick sends the following account of the sitting.\nCuba, Mo., November 9th, 1890.\nReplying to your favour of the 5th inst. , requesting my confirmation of\nthe \" prophecy \" of which my husband wrote, I can say that I was one of\nthe sitters ; the seance having taken place at our house. There were two\nother sitters besides my husband (Dr. Suddick) and self, namely, J. E.\nHollow, jun., and C. H. Cottnam. The message was given in answer to\nquestions put by Mr. Cottnam concerning his friend Mr. Varis. He\ndid not call the name of the latter at the time of the sitting, but only\nspoke of him as \" my friend,\" and I, for one, did not know at the time to\nwhom he referred. (I think perhaps the other sitters did.) I heard\ncasually the next day through a neighbour lady that Mr. Varis, of St.\nJames, was expected to die at any time, and associating the two incidents, I\nconcluded that he was the sick friend of whose demise Mr. C. had been\nquestioning the \"spirits,\" and on inquiring found that I had surmised\ncorrectly.\nAt the sitting, Mr. Cottnam asked a number of questions about his sick\nfriend, among which were, \" Will he be alive when I arrive there 1 \" \"Will\nhe die to-morrow 1 \" \"Will he die the day after ? \" &c. After receiving\nnegative answers to the last two\u2014and perhaps the question whether ho\nwould live a week was asked,\u2014I do not distinctly remember\u2014he requested\nthe controlling power to rap once for every day that his friend would yet\nlive, and the table rapped forty times : each of the sitters counted the raps\nas they were given distinctly by the table rising one side off the floor and\nstriking down again. On counting the forty days from that date we found\nthat the time of his death as prophesied would fall on the 8th of October.\n(The date of the prophecy was August 29th. ) Mr. C. asked if the 8th of\nOctober was the day on which he would die, and the table rapped three\n\fJune, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 91\ntimes, the conventional signal for \"Yes.\" He then asked if the demise would\ntake place in daytime or at night ; in the forenoon or afternoon, &c., and\nreceived answers that it would bo in the daytime, and in the forenoon.\nAt several other seances held at the home of Mr. Brickey and other\nplaces, these questions were again asked, and the answers repeated that Mr.\nVaris would die on the morning of October 8th, as at the first sitting. Of\nthese dates I am perfectly confident.\nIt may, and it may not, be superfluous to add, that, unlike my husband,\nI am not a confirmed believer in the spiritual origin of those phenomena\nwhich we have from time to time witnessed, such as movements of the\ntable by some unknown power ; intelligent answers to questions ; messages\ngiven through the alphabet, &c., but have been undecided whether to\nattribute them to telepathy, thought-transference, or some other unknown\nmental or magnetic quality residing in the sitters themselves, or whether,\nas so many believe, it is really through the direct agency of the disembodied.\nWishing your Society much success in its rational and most scientific way\nof dealing with these occult problems, \u2014I am, very truly,\nLouise F. Suddick.\nMr. Hodgson has also received letters from Mr. I. P. Brickey, Mr.\nE. A. Evans, and Mr. J. A. Bost confirming the authenticity of their\ntestimony quoted above. Mr. Brickey states that it was at his house\nthat the seance at which the prophecy was confirmed was held.\nMr. Evans writes :\u2014.\nCuba, Mo., November UK, 1890.\nTouching the matter cited in yours of the 4th inst. , I desire to say that\nmy signature subscribed to the published statement of Dr. Suddick, relative\nto the prophesied death of Chris. Varis, of St. James, Mo., is authentic.\nFurther, in this connection I desire to say that I never attended a seance, as\nit is called, I believe, in my life, have no experience in that line, and have\nno personal knowledge upon which to base belief nor unbelief of Spiritualism.\nBut I was told by parties that met at Dr. Suddick's residence, some weeks\nbefore the demise of Chris. Varis, that by raps with, or on a table, I do not\nknow which, they were told that Varis would die in 40 days, or October 8th,\nand he did die on the date as given.\nEugene A. Evans.\nThere remained an important question to determine : whether Mr.\nVaris had known of the prophecy, making it possible that it had\nbrought about its own fulfilment. The following letter and statement\ngive the result of Dr. Suddick's inquiries on this point :\u2014\nCuba, Mo., December 29\/-d, 1890.\nI received your recent letter several days ago, but thought it would\nperhaps be more satisfactory to you and your Society for me to go and see\nMrs. Varis, widow of Mr. Chris. Varis, myself. So yesterday (Sunday) I\nboarded the noon train, and on arriving found Mrs. Varis and her two\ndaughters, young ladies, very intelligent and clever people. On introduc\ning the subject, just a shade of vexation passed over Mrs. V.'s face, and\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1S91.\nshe made haste to say, \"Wo are not Spiritualists, and knew nothing of\nthe prophecy until we saw it in the Crawford Mirror, at least two weeks\nafter Mr. Varis' death. I was very much vexed, as we believe nothing in\nsuch foolishness.'' . . .\nI explained that the parties who had signed their names to the paper\nhad not intended it to appear in the local Press. Mrs. V. said she had felt\nvery badly about having her husband's name bandied about in that way in a\nnewspaper, but when Mr. Cottnam explained the matter, and Dr. Headlee\nsaid he knew of the prophecy, and that the morning of the 8th of October\nhad been specified as the time in which he should die, a week or more\nbefore his death occurred, she felt that there must be some truth in it, as she\ncould not doubt Dr. Headlee.\n\"Mrs. Varis, did your husband know anything about the prophecy before\nhis death ? \"\n\"No, indeed,\" she said, \"none of us knew anything about it until two\nweeks after his death.\"\n\" Might not Dr. Headlee have said something to him about it during one\nof his visits without your knowing it 1 \"\n\"Oh, dear no,\" she said, \"I was always present at these visits, and know\nno such talk occurred at any of them. No, I am positive Dr. Headlee never\nmentioned it, and that Mr. V. never knew it.\"\nI then wrote up the little memorandum enclosed, and she signed it, or\nrather her daughter did, at her request, in my presence. . . .\nI then went out and found Dr. Headlee, and he said in answer to my\nquestions :\u2014\n\"No, I know positively that Mr. V. knew nothing of the prophecy ; no\none in St. James knew anything of it but myself, and I did not want him to\nfind it out.\" S. T. Suddick.\nTo ALL whom IT MAY concern :\u2014This is to certify that I am positive\nthat my husband knew nothing whatever of the prophecy of his death, made\nat a Spiritual circle held at the home of Dr. S. T. Suddick, in Cuba, Mo., on\nAugust 29th last. We did not hear of it for about two weeks after his death.\nWe are not Spiritualists.\n(Signed) Mits. A. Varis.\nWe may add that Spiritualistic seances (without professional\nmediums) are very frequently held in Cuba, Mo., which is, we under\nstand, a town of some 550 inhabitants; and that other prophecies have\nbeen made which have come true, as the following letter written by Dr.\nSuddick to Colonel Bundy, editor of the Religio-Philosophical Journal\n(and received from Colonel Bundy by Mr. Hodgson on October 28th,\n1890), will show. They are, however, decidedly less striking than the\ninstance we have given, and it would be difficult to estimate their\nevidential value without a precise statement of the number of pro\nphecies that have not come true.\nWe had a sitting about a month ago, spirits stating that a \"woman would\n\fJune, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 93\ndie in Cuba on October 20th,\" but they would not spell the name. Miss\nAnnie Long died here that day.\nParson Stillwell, a very old gentleman, was quite feeble, and a few nights\nago at a circle someone asked how long he would live. The spirits spelled\nout, \"He will die to-night.\" In the morning he was dead.\nThe spirits kept parties in Cuba posted in the wheat market, noting all\nthe changes from to three or four days ahead, all this fall. Thousands have\nbeen made here.\nTWO NEW CASES OF SPONTANEOUS CHANGE\nOF PERSONALITY.\nCases of permanent spontaneous change of personality are still\nsufficiently rare to deserve record in this Journal. Two cases observed\nby Professor Charcot are reported (with the authorisation of his name)\nin the Journal de Medecine et de Chirurgie, 1891, Tome LXIL, and\ncopied thenoe into the Revue de VHypnotisms, May, 1891, from which\nplace I translate and abridge them. No names are given in the reports.\nDr. Charcot's First Case.\nHere is a girl entirely natural in aspect ; sewing, talking, answermg\nquestions, at any rate if the interrogation is not pushed far ; and yet there\nexist in her two separate personalities ; she is in a secondary state. Let us\ncall this actual state B, as opposed to the primary state A, which can be\nartificially reproduced. In state B she walks well, without limping ; she\nsuffers from complete superficial analgesia (no part of her skin can feel pain) ;\nshe retains the muscular sense, but taste and smell are modified, and the\nvisual field is diminished.\nBy carefully questioning her, one discovers that her answers are some\nwhat defective on certain points : she has forgotten her age and her place of\neducation. In this state she is somewhat heavy, and although she sews with\nease she has difficulty in writing, and cannot perform the simplest arithme\ntical operation. She is attached to another young patient, and lately went\nwith her to the theatre and remembers the play fairly well.\nIn this state B she presents all the characters of what M. Charcot terms\n\" le grand hypnotisme.\" A sudden noise renders her cataleptic, and she\nis roused from catalepsy by blowing on her eyes. By blowing on her skin\nthe \"contracture somnambulique \" is produced; a contraction of the sub\njacent muscles which no one can produce by an effort of will. Her mental\ncharacteristics also resemble those of artificial somnambulism. She is\nextremely suggestible ; is intoxicated by being told that she is drinking\nchampagne from an empty glass, &c. If she is told to see a red cross\n(imaginary) on a white card, and another card is then substituted, she sees a\ngreen cross on this second card ; and so with other complementary colours,\nwith a precision which one cannot suppose due to a knowledge of the law of\ncontrast. She also constructs a suggested portrait from slight points de\nrepere, &c.\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1891.\nLet us now see her in state A. This state sometimes returns spon\ntaneously, and is at any time easily induced by energetically telling her\nto awake. There is a very slight hysterical attack, which might easily pass\nunobserved, and tho condition is then completely changed. In state A the\npatient suffers from a hysterical disturbance of the movements of walking,\nand stands with difficulty. The analgesia is now only partial ; the field of\nvision is modified ; catalepsy and somnambulic contracture can no longer bo\ninduced.\nOn the psychical side, memory has returned, and the patient recalls the\nevents of her youth, and can work a sum in arithmetic. But she has com\npletely forgotten all that passed in state B. When her young friend is pre\nsented to her she regards her as a stranger, and has no recollection of the\nvisit to the theatre, or of the piece played. Suggestion is no longer possible.\nState A, however, never lasts long ; and after 15 or 20 minutes the patient\nhas an invincible tendency to fall back into state B, which appears to be\nmore agreeable to her, and from which she is never drawn without a protest.\nOnce returned to state B, she presents the same phenomena as above\ndescribed, and entirely forgets what has passed in state A. The previous\nhistory of this patient can be briefly given. Her father was a drunkard,\nand subject to hysterical or epileptic attacks ; her mother was excitable ;\nshe has had an uncle insane. She underwent a typhoid fever at fifteen ;\nand shortly afterwards, after an emotional shock, began to suffer from\nviolent hysterical attacks. One day it was remarked that she sometimes\nseemed different from her normal self ; soon afterwards, about a year ago,\nshe was received at the Salp6triere.\nAt present she generally wakes in the morning in state A, but soon\npasses into state B, in which condition she remains all day ; in the evening\nshe re-enters state A before going to sleep. It is evident that she is not far\nfrom being a perpetual somnambule, or rather vigilambide, \u2014for she has by\nno means the look of a person asleep.\nDr. Charcot's Second Case.\n'M. Charcot's second case was at first very difficult to study, because no\nway of transforming state B into state A had been discovered, and the spon\ntaneous change took place only at long intervals. A method of transforma\ntion has now been discovered, and the case has much gained in interest.\nThis second patient also is a hysteric, who entered the Salpetriere 10\nyears ago, and has lived almost continually in state B since 1885. In that\nstate she presents an absolute general anaesthesia, and the loss of the mus\ncular sense is so complete that she falls as soon as her eyes are closed. Her\nhearing and smell are nearly normal ; but she is colour-blind and distin\nguishes no colour but red, \u2014a symptom fairly common with hysterical\nwomen. She has also hysterical attacks from time to time, but much less\nviolent and less frequent than in her earlier state.\nIn her state B, which is now habitual, she only knows her name because\nit has been taught to her afresh. She knows nothing of her past history,\nher family, &c. She remembers the Exhibition which she visited in state\nB but knows nothing before 1885. Another young patient has taught her\nto read, write, and cipher in state B, and (with some difficulty) to knit.\n\fJune, 18o1.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 95\nAs with the patient in the first case, the phenomena of \"le grand\nhypnotisrae \" are readily produced with this second patient in her state B.\nBut her colour-blindness gives a special interest to the experiment of the\ncomplementary colours. As she can only recognise red, we can suggest to\nher to see a red cross on a white card. When this card is changed for\nanother white card she immediately sees on the second card a green cross.\nAnd yet if a really green object is shown to her she cannot tell its colour.\nShe thu3 can only see green as a complementary colour, and subsequent to\na suggestion.\nIt is possible to transfer her into condition A by a kind of objurgation ;\nand the transition, as in the first case, is marked by a hysterical attack,\nrather more severe than in the former case. In state A she is at once\ntransported five years back, and the last five years disappear altogether from\nher existence. Her life seems to end in 1885, at the time when sho passed\ninto state B, and she recounts all manner of details about her early history,\nand recollects a physician whom she has not met since 1885. She saw\nhim without recognition, a moment previously, in state B. She remembers\nthe staff of the Salpetriere as it was in 1885, but does not recognise the\npersons who are actually around her every day. She recognises the patient\nwho serves as governess to state B, but imagines that that patient has only\nbeen a month in the hospital, which was true at the date when her own state\nA yielded to state B ; and at the same time she has forgotten all that that\ngoverness taught her ; she can neither read, write, nor sew, but has relapsed\ninto the illiteracy of her normal life, in which she could not read or write.\nShe has forgotten the Exhibition and the Eiffel tower\u2014everything, in short,\nwhich has occurred since 1885.\nFurthermore, she is now colour-blind with the right eye only ; the left\neye sees colours normally. Sensibility, which, in almost all its forms, had\ncompletely disappeared in state B, returns on the right side, and she can\nstand erect with her eyes shut. Catalepsy and suggestibility can be no\nlonger induced. Yet certain suggestions made in state B persist into state\nA ; for instance, having been made by suggestion in state B to see a cap with\na red feather on the head of one of the students, she still sees the absurd\nheaddress in state A, and cannot look at the student without laughing.\nState A never lasts long with this patient, and after a quarter of an hour\nor so she repasses into state B with a slight hysterical attack lasting for a few\nseconds. All the phenomena already described as characterising her state B\nare at once reproduced. Like the previous patient she prefers state B to\nstate A, and resists the attempt to transfer her to state A. Her history\nresembles that of the first patient ; after a series of violent attacks she passed\ninto state B in 1885, and since that date has seldom spontaneously relapsed\ninto state A.\nThese two cases seem to me noticeable for the very close analogy\nwhich they show between a spontaneous secondary state and the\nhypnotic state. These patients closely resemble Dr. Jules Janet's\npatient, MarcelUne, with whom the secondary state was originally\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1891.\ninduced by hypnotism, but became quasi-permanent when she was left\nunawakened in the hypnotic trance.\nThey thus illustrate what I believe to be an important fact,\nnamely, that the phenomena which the various methods classed under\nthe name of hypnotism induce are not novel or isolated symptoms, but\nrather an empirical reproduction of symptoms, most of which have\noften occurred spontaneously.\nThe balance of advantages and drawbacks between the state A\nand the state B in these two subjects is not to us very obvious. Yet\nin each instance\u2014and this is usually the case in changes of personality\nof this kind\u2014the subject herself decidedly prefers state B. May we\nnot consider the gradual transference from state A to state B as a kind\nof healing effort of nature, rather than as a degenerative change ?\nF. W. H. M.\nOBITUARY.\nMR. HENSLEIGH WEDGWOOD.\nThe death of Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood, which occurred on June\n2nd, at the age of 88, deprives our Society of one of its most helpful\nmembers, and some among us of a staunch and honoured friend.\nMr. Wedgwood's interest in this class of subjects dated, I think, from\nthe year 1873, when he was already seventy years old. During a long\nand intellectually vigorous old age he made these inquiries his principal\ninterest. On the formation of the S.P.R. in 1882 he consented to be\none of its Vice-Presidents, and since that time he has frequently con\ntributed observations or narratives of value. He was not always in\nagreement with the critical method adopted in our Proceedings ; and\ncriticisms from his pen on what he regarded as undue rigour have from\ntime to time appeared in these columns. But no difference of opinion\never checked his steady good-will ; and wherever the completeness of\nevidence depended upon his own exertions he spared no pains to attain\nit. A remarkable case of automatic messages read at our last meeting\n\u2014four days before his death\u2014had been carefully prepared by him only\na few weeks ago.\nAge and infirmity, indeed, seemed to have no effect upon his steady\ndevotion to the pursuit of truth. His correspondence retained all its\ncourteous promptitude and serene impersonality when he was suffering\nunder physical troubles which would have absorbed the whole attention\nof most other men.\nOf his good work done in other directions\u2014philological and\nantiquarian\u2014tthis is not the place to speak. Cousin and brother-in-\nlaw of Charles Darwin, a member of a family group noted for the\nunusual proportion of men of eminence which it has given to the world,\nhis intellectual achievements paled beside those of his more famous\nkinsfolk. But in moral nature he was not easily to be surpassed ;\u2014in\nthe candid uprightness, the unobtrusive beneficence, the immutable\nspirit of honour, which made one feel, if all men were like him, how\nsimple and noble a matter the life of man might be.\u2014F.

Barrett, Colonel ^\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, MM.\nHartley, Dr. A. T. Myers, Messrs. W. Crookes, F. W. H. Myers,\nSydney C. Scott, R. Pearsall Smith, and H. E. Wingfield.\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting were read and signed as correct.\nThree new Members and seven new Associates, whose names and\naddresses are given above, were elected. The election of one new\nMember and seven new Associates of the American Branch was also\nrecorded.\nA Minute was made recording the death of Mr. Hensleigh Wedg\nwood, respecting whom an obituary notice appeared in the last number\nof the Journal. Information was also received of the decease of Mrs.\nBarrett, a Member of the Society.\nThe name of Dr. H. D. B. Kingston was, at his request, transferred\nfrom the list of Members to that of Associates.\nThe Assistant-Secretary reported that, in accordance with a list\nfurnished by Mr. B. Hodgson, a surplus copy of various parts of the\nProceedings had been despatched to 522 libraries of colleges and public\ninstitutions in America, through the agency of the Smithsonian\nInstitution.\nIt was further resolved that means be taken to send surplus copies\nto Colonial college libraries, to be accompanied by a copy of the\n\" Objects,\" and of the Contents of the Proceedings.\nSome other matters of business having been attended to, it was\nagreed that the next Meeting of the Council should be at 19, Bucking\nham-street, Adelphi, W.C., on Friday, the 2nd of October, at 4.30 p.m.\nGENEBAL MEETING.\nThe 47th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, July 17th, at 4 p.m., the President in\nthe chair.\nThe President gave an address on the progress of the Census of\nHallucinations, of which he stated that 9,276 answers had been col\nlected in England, and 2,822 in France. He proceeded to discuss the\nproportion of veridical hallucinations, and in other respects to compare\nthe results obtained in England with those obtained previously by Mr.\nGuroey, and with M. Marillier's in France. He finds that the pro\nportion of apparitions at the moment of death to those of recognised\nliving people does not appear to differ very materially from that found\nby Mr. Gurney.\nMb. F. W. H. Myers then concluded his address (begun May\n29th), on \" Problems of Personality,\" the substance of which will, it\nis hoped, appear in our Proceedings. The speaker reviewed the\n\fJuly, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 99\nvarious classes of automatic and subliminal messages in their relation\nto the primary memory of the automatist.\nIn the first place, some of these messages, like the \" inspirations\nof genius,\" or the brief apparitions which showed no purposive action\nof their own, seamed to be assumed without any perceptible break\ninto the superficial chain of memory.\nSecondly, in certain cases, a subsidiary or concurrent chain of\nmemory was manifested, as, for instance, in ordinary automatic writ\ning, where the messages written exhibited an intelligence involving\nmemory, but not necessarily interfering with the automatist's primary\nintelligence and memory, which might be occupied with other matters\nwhile the message was being written.\nIn the third place, the secondary chain of memory sometimes\nbecame sufficiently dominant to alternate with the primary,\u2014as in\nsuch cases as those of Mme. B., Felida X., Ansel Bourne, <fcc.\nIn the fourth place, there were sometimes indications that a fusion\nof memories had occurred, or at any rate that the subliminal memory\nwas wider in its scope, and represented the individuality more\ncompletely than the superliminal.\nThe question of the various origins of automatic messages was then\nonce more discussed. It was concluded that, while at our present stage\nof knowledge it was very difficult to distinguish what the subliminal\nself might have itself acquired through the exercise of clairvoyant or\nsimilar powers from what it might have acquired by telepathic impact\nfrom other intelligences, yet there was reason to suppose that both\nthese factors must be taken into account. Indeed, the very existence\nof the clairvoyant powers of the subliminal self indicated a realm of\nlaws under which even direct communication from discarnate intelli\ngences lost much of its antecedent improbability.\nOases forwarded from America by Mr. Hodgson (automatic message\nto Mrs. Bryan and another), were then read, which seemed to imply\ncommunication from deceased persons.\nThe President then invited discussion on the papers read.\nMr. Edward Maitland observed that he saw no difficulty in\nassuming the agency of deceased persons in the cases quoted by Mr.\nMyers. He had had instances of writing in handwritings unknown to\nthe writer, and giving information also unknown.\nMr. Barkworth thought that though we have evidence for the\nexistence of the different \" personalities \" we had no warrant for\nassuming an underlying \" individuality \" as Mr. Myers had done. Nor\nwas he able altogether to follow him in his view about messages being\nsent up to the primary consciousness. He thought it more strictly in\naccordance with known facts to suppose that the active p^rsjonalitv is ^\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, isai.\nlaid at rest when the other manifests itself. Not only in sleep, but\nwhen fatigued or abstracted, images or broken sentences would\npresent themselves to the mind as in dreams. Quiescence of reason\nseemed to be all that was required to enable us to perceive the emotions\nof the passive consciousness, which are, perhaps, continually going on\nthough we do not know of it. By postulating two different personali\nties or memories many difficulties in understanding the working of our\nminds were removed. He would not sit down without again urging\nmembers of the Society to experiment on the passive consciousness by\ncrystal gazing, automatic writing, and, with due reservations, by\nhypnotism.\nProfessor Barrett agreed about the importance of experiment\ning, and thought the Society greatly indebted to Mr. Myers for theories\nthat might guide experiments. He went on to describe a remarkable\ncase of automatic writing, which had come under his own observation\nand which he hoped might some day be published. Though much that\nwas written in this case came from the automatist's own mind, some\nthings written seemed clearly to point to the operation of an external\nintelligence.\nTHE CASE OF \"EDINA.\"\nDuring the last year certain letters signed \" Edina \" have appeared\nin Light, giving an account of messages apparently written automati\ncally by \" Edina's \" daughter, which messages, as Edina held, contain\nmany facts with which the young lady herself has never been normally\nacquainted.\nThrough the courtesy of the editor of Light I obtained an intro\nduction to \" Edina,\" and have had much correspondence with him,\nthroughout the whole of which he has shown himself ready and\nanxious to give me the fullest information with regard to these mes\nsages. I also had the pleasure of making his personal acquaintance\nlast summer.\nThe investigation of the messages, however, promised to be a lengthy\nmatter, and I was unable to give the necessary time to the task. I\nwas fortunate enough to obtain the assistance of Mr. J. J. Withers,\nMaltravers House, Arundel-street, Strand, a graduate in honours of\nKing's College, Cambridge, and one of the partners in a well-known firm\nof London solicitors. I had known Mr. Withers for some years, and\nfelt a complete confidence, which the event, I think, has fully justified,\nthat any task which he undertook would be executed with thoroughness\nand care.\nIn May, 1891, Mr. Withers sent me his report. I informed \"Edina\"\n\fJuly, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 101\nthat it was of a negative character, and he preferred not to see it,\nalthough I offered to send it to him. He has, however, written a letter\nto Light of June 26th, giving an account of the affair, and implying\nthat Mr. Withers was not competent to perform his task. I have no\nwish for controversy with \"Edina,\" and I in no way feel myself aggrieved\nby his letter ; but in justice to Mr. Withers it has been thought fitting\nthat some grounds on which his negative conclusion was based should\nbe put on record in this Journal.\nMiss B., says Mr. Withers, aged 23, has been deaf since she was 8 years\nof age. It has been asserted in the above-mentioned articles that lately\nMiss B. has written messages from spirits of departed persons. Although in\nthe articles themselves there is no specific statement of claim, yet it is fair,\nafter reading the articles themselves, to formulate the claim of \" Edina \" as\nabove mentioned.\nThe evidence consists of a large number of the original writings made by\nMiss B. ; secondly, written and oral information supplied by Mr. B. her\nfather ; and thirdly, personal observation.\nAs regards the letters themselves they are as a rule written in hands\nwhich, to one who is not an expert in handwriting, appear dissimilar ; but in\nno case have I had before me the writing of a person made in his lifetime to\ncompare with the writing which is alleged to be made by his spirit. The\nwritings, however, of the various spirits seem to remain characteristic,\nand we are able to say, therefore, that each individuality has its handwriting,\nwhatever the individuality may be, be it real or fictitious. When tested,\nhowever, as mentioned below, the writings themselves appear of little value\nas either evidence for Spiritualism or against it.\nMr. B. endeavours most conscientiously to be accurate, but I am afraid\nthat his anxiety to prove his case makes it imperative that we should strictly\nexamine every piece of his evidence. Take one instance. In the number of\nLight published on July 5th, 1890, Mr. B. says : \" My daughter never heard\nof such a person as Professor Wilson.\" That statement is misleading, for\nthe late Professor Wilson is still well-known in Edinburgh, and there is a\nstatue of him within a quarter of a mile from Mr. B.'s house. The presump\ntion is very strong that Miss B. did know of the existence of Professor\nWilson. In the same article he mentions the fact of the existence of the\nstatue, but he does not seem to think it possible that Miss B. should have\nseen it ; why, I am unable to gather.\nAgain, all through the articles he suggests that Miss B. is deaf and can\nnot, therefore, be supposed to have the ordinary intelligence of a normal\nperson. On this supposition the editor of Light, in a comment which he\nmakes on one of the letters, says : \" That a deaf lady who could not have\nheard any facts by normal means should write out facts respecting a man with\nwhom she was quite unacquainted is in itself singular.\" Now, the fact is\nthat Miss B. has been deaf since she was 8 years old, but she is an exceedingly\ngood lip-reader, and, in my presence, Mrs. B. dictated to her 37 words and\nout of all these she only made one mistake. I do not count the errors in\nspelling, which I will refer to afterwards. I have given these instances to\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1891.\nprove that Mr. B. 's evidence, although he wishes it to be accurate, must be\nreceived with strict caution.\nI will now state the facts concerning the messages which I hold to be\nproven. I have examined 60 of the messages which Miss B. has written.\nOf these 60 messages 56 consist, roughly speaking, of statements as to\nmatters which had been previous to the time of writing admittedly within the\nknowledge of Miss B. or within the knowledge of one at least of her\nfamily.\nIn Light \" Edina \" makes a difference between knowledge of Miss B. and\nknowledge of the family, on the ground of the deafness of Miss B. This\ndistinction must be treated, for evidential purposes, as non-existent, as Miss\nB. is a good lip-reader.\nI likewise do not distinguish between past and present knowledge, as such\na distinction is immaterial.\nFirst, I will give two messages characteristic of the 56 above mentioned.1\nThey are as follows : \u2014\n(1) David Livingstone, the African traveller : \"I wrote you a few days\nago \u2022 and your pen went of the wrong line of another spirit I am quite\npleased with Stanley marriage and Miss Dorothy Tenant : he met her many\nyears ago and of course their marriage was kept a secret before he went\nastray as African explorer. I saw him put a wreath on my stone and I was\nsorry indeed to see Stanley was not very well. And he is a lucky man. You\nwill know I belonged to Lanark and I went a great deal on the desert plain\nbut oh, my dreams were of home, fain wad I be tae my ain countrie, but they\nburied me in London.3 The blacks of Africa some were good to me but\nhalf of them were rather noisy. Well, I did all I could to do something to\nteach them, and as you see in the Map of Stanleys his places are dotted in\nred. You will see some interesting pictures of some mishaps I had in Central\nAfrica. My thistle4 and prayer book, but when finished praying my\nthoughts were of home to the dear ones who were waiting for me, but alas\nmy God took me away to dwell in his own story (?) and when your days are\ndone may we meet in that Heaven above where there is no pain troubles or\nany more travels in the desert plain but travel the golden streets of Heaven\nwhere flowers bloom on the roadsides. Such flowers are made to grow in\nEden are far prettier than those on earth. So farewell young friend who I\nhave just had the pleasure of writing through the spirit Lord till we meet\nagain. \"David Livingstone.\"6\n1 The handwriting of these messages is not always easy to read ; and it is possible\nthat the text given may be slightly inaccurate.\u2014F. W. H. M.\n2 \" A Spirit \" had previously written as \" George Livingstone \" !\n3 Miss A. had visited Livingstone's grave in Westminster Abbey in 1876.\n* Miss A. had been at the presentation of the freedom of the City to Stanley, and\nhad especially visited a statue of Livingstone in which he was represented with a\nthistle in his buttonhole.\u2014J. J. W.\n6 To this Livingstone case I may append another note from personal knowledge.\nThe statement that \"their marriage\" (that of Mr. and Mrs. Stanley) \"was kept a\nsecret before he went astray as African explorer \" is altogether erroneous, as there was\nno marriage (I), nor engagement to be married, until Mr. Stanley's return from Africa.\nThe marriage in Westminster Abbey on July 12th, 1890r was, undoubtedly, the first\nwhich had taken place between the contracting parties. Nor is it true to say that\nMr. Stanley personally placed a wreath on Livingstone's stone. \u2014F. W. H. M.\n\fJvUy, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 103\nAfter analysing another message, Mr. Withers turns to the four\ncases which did not relate to matters of which Miss B.'s family were\nsupposed to be cognisant. He says :\u2014\nMiss B. has read many \"messages\" from one \"Proffesor (stc) Sandring-\nham.\" The messages in themselves, though voluminous, have nothing\nremarkable in them, dealing as they do principally with the little details of\nthe life of \"Edina's\" family. But as this \"spirit \" seemed an obliging and\nfriendly one, he was pressed to give some details of his life on earth, and ho\ngave the following facts :\u2014\n(a) His name was Professor George Islington Sandringham, M.B.,\nR.S.C.P.C.-G.\n(b) He was born at Kendal in 1841.\n(c) He died four years ago aged 46.\n('T) When at Oxford he took first honours for proficiency in medicine.\n(e) Died in Germany and was buried in Kendal.\nThis at least is tangible at first sight and if proved true might be of usej\nAsked what the letters after his name meant, he answered : \" Royal Surgical\nCollege Physician College of Germany.\" Asked what college he was at at\nOxford he replied: \"The College of Medicine in Oxford and Germany.\nThere is one named the Royal College of Medicine, and was called by a few\nstudents in my days, but I cannot give any more information.\"\nPressed further, he stated that he would \" let the Society hunt about if\nthey are particular about my whereabouts.\"\nThe Society happened to be anxious and tested the \"facts\" with the\nfollowing results as far as tangible.\n(a) At another time he stated that his name was George Frederick\nSandringham.\n(6) George Islington Sandringham was not born at Kendal in 1841, or\nbetween 1837 and 1846, or anywhere else in England at that date.\n(rf) He did not take first honours in proficiency in medicine, as he did\nnot matriculate between 1715 and 1885.\n(e) He was not buried at Kendal between 1884 and 1886, as far as I can\ndiscover.\nAnother communication, signed, \" Robert Digbye,\" gives a faulty\nreproduction of Pope's epitaph on Robert and Mary Digby, which\nappear in the editions of his collected works. \" Now Pope's poems,\"\nMr. Withers continues, \" are so universally met with that it must be\nassumed that Miss B. or any other person has at some period of her\nlife seen and read them.\" . . . \"The headnote to the epitaph in\nthe published edition gives all the information which Miss B. gives us.\"\nOn another occasion Miss B. reproduced approximately the inscrip\ntion on a fine tomb in the Church of Holy Rood, Southampton. Mr.\nWithers has not yet found this inscription in print, but so large a\nnumber of books and articles on epitaphs have appeared, especially\narticles in such magazines as Sunday at Home, Good Words, and the\nlike, that he has found it impossible to check them all.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1891.\nI pass on to the last specimen of the four cases out of sixty in\nwhich the messages contained facts of which none of Miss B.'s family\nwere cognisant. In this case, which Mr. Withers analyses at length,\na communication came professedly from Professor Wilson, which con\nsisted mainly of an almost exact reproduction of a footnote in Mrs.\nGordon's biography of Professor Wilson, published about 1860, and\nwhich \" Edina \" had read, though he had apparently no specific recollec\ntion of these facts. The message consisted of a series of dates,\nstatements of marriages, &c. ; and no one, I think, will contend that\nthe coincidence was accidental.\nSuch cases are not infrequent with automatic writing, and may be\nexplained on several hypotheses :\n(1) The writer may not really be writing automatically, but con\nsciously reproducing facts acquired for the purpose. This, of course,\nwould be the view of an ordinary jury.\n(2) The writer may be a true automatist, and the message may be\ndue to the revival of memories, forgotten by the superficial self, but\npersisting in the sub-conscious or subliminal self. That this does\nsometimes actually happen I think that our published cases prove.\n(3) The knowledge of the book may have been acquired clair-\nVoyantly by the sub-conscious self\u2014tor, if anyone prefers so to express it,\ncommunicated by some spirit\u2014who, obviously, need not be the spirit\nprofessing to give the message. Or the message might be derived\ntelepathically from the mind of another living person.\n(4) It is also, of course, conceivable that a bond fide spirit may give\na messaget largely coinciding with some printed account. But to make\nthis hypothesis admissible the message should surely be other than a\nstring of statements such as \" Andrew Wilson married Miss Aitken,\ndied 1812. Elizabeth Wilson married Sir John McNeill, G.C.B.\"\nI think that few unbiassed readers will consider that the above\ncase needs either the third or the fourth of these hypotheses.\nA point has been made of the handwritings of these messages. On\nthis matter Mr. Withers observes :\u2014\nApart from the actual communications, I have examined the handwritings\nof these various \" spirits \" who have written. I have had in all 92 original\nspirit signatures. Of these 59 appear in a list written by Miss B. when\nshe had not the former writings of the same spirits before her.

He wrote occasionally, but the last letter from\nhim was two years ago last June, saying he was going in the ship Glengoil, and\nhe did not like the crew.

' He said nothing and disappeared. She\nawoke ; and in the morning told her daughter (who is a Mrs. Macdonald,\nliving near her at Raheny) that her son was dead and she had seen his dead\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

In November, 1889, she heard her son was\ndead, that he had had a fit, but afterwards the captain wrote and told her he\nwould send further particulars when he reached port. But she heard nothing.\nIn January, 1890, she had a vision in her sleep of three men standing over and\nlooking down at the dead body of her son, whom she saw lying on the deck\nmurdered. There was no blood on the body, but she felt he had been killed.\nThe man at his head was dark and had flannels on, and had something in his\nhand like a soda-water bottle in shape, but not made of glass. The man at\nhis feet had a fireman's blue jacket on, and the one at his side was well-\ndressed and ' had a dust coat and a ring on his finger and had a sandy\ncomplexion.' Mrs. Farnane then said : 'I went up to Mr. Chatterton in the\nmorning and told him what I had seen, and said I could get no rest till I\nknew about my son. So Mr. Chatterton wrote for me and at last got a copy\nof the log of the Glengoil for the 7th August, 1889, which stated that my son\nhad been killed by the donkey-engine man, and that the man had been put\nashore at Gibraltar to take his trial. Since then I have had no dreams nor\nsight of my son, except one night when I thought I saw him standing near\nme, looking sorrowful, and he said, 'God help you.' But a queer thing\nhappened about February, 1890. One night I had gone to bed when I heard\na voice calling me to get up, so I went to the door, and opened it ; someone\nwith brown clothing on pushed me back, but I saw no one, I mean there was\nnobody really there.

It is the official log that particulars are in. It is quite a\nmistake to say the man was murdered. There is no doubt in my mind that\nthe cause of death was heart disease. The man had been drinking during\nthe day, while at Point de Galle, and in the afternoon, soon after leaving\nthere, he commenced a quarrel with the donkeyman, Thomas Ellis.

Herr Mutschlechner turned to speak to him, but could then\nno longer see him. On the 26th of September he again saw, as he thought,\nthis old gentleman walking in front of him, but he lost sight of him at the\nnext side-walk before he could overtake him. This is corroborated by\nFrau Mutschlechner, who herself subsequently had two dreams suggesting\nthe death of the gentleman in question. In November they learnt that he\nhad died on September 26th, and in the same letter were informed of brighter\nprospects for their own future which they owed to the deceased.\nWe have received letters authenticating the case and giving real\nnames, &c., from the editor of Sphinx.\nThe following is a more ordinary case of an apparition at the time\nof death.\nL 882.

He\nwas hundreds of miles distant from where I was residing at the time.\nOn this particular evening I retired to rest much earlier than usual, as I\nfelt a severe cold coming on. I was in bed at a quarter-past eight, and at 20\nminutes to nine I saw standing at the door, illumined by a soft light\nwhich appeared to emanate from his person, and thereby rendered him\nvisible, as the room was dark.

Mrs. Marshall was at Monkstown, Co. Dublin, at the time, and the lad\nGeorge was at Monkstown, Co. Cork. Mrs. Marshall is confident that\nshe had not been asleep when she had the vision ; it was about 8.30 or 20 to\n9 on a Sunday in March, 1866, about a month after the receipt of the above\nletter. About three days after the vision she received a letter announcing\nGeorge's death, which took place at 20 to 9 on Sunday. The mother died in\n1885. Mrs. Marshall is sure that she was not thinking of George at the\ntime. She has had no other hallucinations, but [on one occasion she had a\ndream that impressed her a good deal about a friend being in trouble, an\naccident which proved fatal having happened to the friend, apparently at the\nsame time.] Mrs. Marshall mentioned her experience to others at the time,\nbut these persons are not living now.\nLater, Mr. Smith wrote :\u2014\nMay 28th, 1891.\nHaving ascertained from the register of deaths, Dublin, that the date of\nGeorge 's death was February 18th, 1866, I saw Mrs. Marshall again\nthis afternoon and asked her to explain the discrepancy. She said that\nhaving her memory only to rely upon she was not surprised to find that\nshe was a month out. She is absolutely certain that her experience was on\na Sunday, because she remembers church was interfered with by her cold. I\nfind that February 18th, 1866,.was a Sunday. Mrs. Marshall is confident\nthat at the time she noticed the exactness of the coincidence ; the news of\nthe death came not later than three days after her vision.\nThe next is a case of a complicated apparition\u2014a kind of vision\nat the time of the death of the person seen, but in which the details of\nthe vision are not veridical.\nL. 883. Ad Pn Visual. Child percipient. Second hand, as good\nas first.\nThe following narrative was obtained for us by Mr. G. E.\nHumphreys, of Caius College, Cambridge, who is personally acquainted\nwith Mrs. A. He took down the account from her and witnessed her\nsignature :\u2014\nMarch 12th, 1891.\nAbout the year 1858 I was living in Jamaica. My son J. was then\nabout seven years old. One evening I was at the piano in the drawing-room,\nplaying the accompaniment for my children, who were grouped round at\nmy back and singing an old song called \" The Old English Lady. \" Suddenly\nJ. stopped singing and called out, \"I see Grannie, dressed in white, with\na spud in her hand, under the cedar tree.\" I stopped playing and told him\nto go on singing. Again he repeated, \"I see Grannie, dressed in white,\nwith a spud in her hand, under the cedar tree.\" I took it to be just a child's\nfancy, and the singing went on after this as usual. The candles were lighted\nin the drawing-room, and the piano was placed so that the children and I\nwere facing the open door which opened on to the dark verandah. The\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1891.\nverandah was closed in with jalousies. I at once understood J. to be\nspeaking of a cedar tree near a pond in the garden of an estate where\nmy mother was then living. She was in the habit of taking a spud into\nthe garden to dig up weeds, and the child may easily more than once have\nseen her as he described. [The estate in question] was 40 miles away from\nour house.\nI thought nothing more of it. The next morning, about six o'clock, a\nmounted messenger arrived with the news of my mother's death. She must\nhave been alive at the time J. declared he saw her in the garden, but\nwas no doubt ill in her room. She died of a malignant fever, very suddenly,\nand we had had no previous news of her illness.\nAt the same time, or shortly afterwards, my sister C. was taken\nill with the same fever. She lay for some time in a dangerous condition and\nwas not expected to recover. During this time J.'s nurse came to me\none morning, saying that during the night he had several times called out,\n\" I see Aunt C. riding up and down on Prince.\" A long verandah\nwas outside the nursery and it was up and down this that the child said he\nsaw his aunt riding. Prince was her grey pony.\nWhen I heard this, I at once concluded in my own mind that my sister\nwas dead. She did not die then, but was at the point of death, the doctors\nhaving given up hope. She recovered and lived for years afterwards.\n(Signed) H. A.\nIn answer to our questions, Mr. Humphreys sends the following\nfurther information :\u2014\nJamaica, May 4th, 1891.\n1. Mr. J. A. was not only not in the habit of seeing visions at that time\nbut doe3 not appear to have seen anything of the kind, either before or\nsince. These are the only two instances known.\n2. He must have known of his aunt's illness at the time he saw her\nriding up and down the verandah. Mrs. A. says, however, that she never\nmentioned to him or in his hearing the connection there was in her\nown mind between his vision of her mother and the death. As I stated,\nthe vision occurred in the evening. At (or about) daybreak next morning\nMrs. A. was awakened by her husband asking her if she could bear\nto hear bad news. She had no idea who it was of whom the bad news\nwas to be. It was not until she heard of her mother's death that she\nremembered J.'s visions. She was particularly careful never to allude to it in\nhis presence, being afraid of encouraging any such possible tendency in him.\n3. Mr. A. has \" some sort of hazy recollection\" of the matter, due most\nprobably, as he says, to having been told of it afterwards by his mother. No\ncorroboration appears possible. Mrs. A. was anxious to make little of it,\nand said nothing of it to Mr. A. until he was almost grown up. Mr. A.\nsenior has been dead many years.\nMr. J. A. strikes one as being in every way the reverse of \" visionary \"\nor \"imaginative.\"\n\fJuly, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Ill\nMR. KIRK'S EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE\nFROM A DISTANCE. (L. 863, continued.)\nThe present communication from Mr. Kirk is a continuation of the\naccount given in the Journal for February, 1891, of his experiments in\nthought-transference.\nIn the present series a time has always been fixed at which the\npercipient, Miss G., should sit in the dark waiting for an impression.\nThe success obtained is greater, we think, than may appear at first\nsight ; although in those experiments at least where the percipient was\nat Pembroke and the agent, Mr. Kirk, at Plumstead, little more than\nsomewhat indefinite appearances of light seem to have been transferred.\nThat these appearances were due to chance is unlikely, because Miss\nG. has not had any impressions of the kind when Mr. Kirk was not\nattempting to impress her (except on one occasion, described below,\np. 114, when he has reason to think the impression was due to his\naction). That they were due to her expectation of seeing something is\nimprobable, because on the only two occasions when he felt that he\nwas not succeeding in impressing her, and recorded at the time in his\nnotebook that he expected a failure, and on those occasions only, she\nhad no impression whatever.\nThe success would, no doubt, be more striking could Mr. Kirk\ncount on producing an impression when Miss G. was not expecting one\nat all. But, though he has sometimes succeeded in doing this, as\nmentioned in his former paper, he generally fails ; probably because it\nis impossible, without prearrangement, to secure that the percipient\nshall be in the quiescent condition with suitable light, itc., which seems\nnecessary for the success of the experiment.\nThe following brief tabular statement of the experiments may help\nthe reader to estimate them. We have purposely omitted from it all\nmention of the disposition of the lights, movements of the agent's eyes,\ntfcc. These and other interesting circumstances are wisely noted by\nMr. Kirk, and may quite well, as he supposes, have affected the results.\nBut we think it will require many more experiments to prove this ;\nand in order at the present stage to answer the question whether Miss\nG.'s experiences were due to chance or to Mr. Kirk's exertions, it seems\nbest to confine ourselves to the simple consideration that he was\nendeavouring on each occasion to transfer the impression of a bril\nliantly lighted object of a certain form,\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

[July, 1891.\n(2) When Miss G. was at Pembroke and Mr. Kirk at Plumstead,\nshe did not have definite impressions of form ; but in the majority of\ncases when she was no further off than her own house at Plumstead\u2014\n400 yards from Mr. Kirk\u2014some approximation to the form of the\nbright object looked at by him was perceived by her. This seems to\nshow that distance has some effect on the success of the experiments.\n(3) In no instance where Miss G. saw a definite form could it be\ncalled distinctly wrong (unless possibly in the second part of Experi\nment 14).\n(4) In two of the three instances in which the experiment was\ndivided into parts, Miss G.'s impression changed the right number of\ntimes, though the fact that there was any change on the agent's part\nwas unknown to her.\nThese facts, taken with those mentioned above, afford, we think,\na very strong presumption that telepathy was at work ; and if the\nexperiments do not appear brilliantly successful, it must be remembered\nthat we have very few systematic courses of experiment with agent\nand percipient at so great a distance from one another to compare\nthem with.\nThe following description given by Mr. Kirk, in a letter, of his\nmental attitude while experimenting, is worth noting. He says :\u2014\n\"I ought to tell you that, while making an experiment, I do not simply\nlook at the diagram and think of the percipient. I transport myself\n[mentally of course] into her room and actually see her ; and I often succeed\nso far as to carry on the experiment in her room. This was difficult at first,\nbut now I have no difficulty in being in two places at the same moment.\"\nIn this connection we may appropriately describe the occasion on\nwhich Miss G. had an impression of light when Mr. Kirk had no\nintention of producing one on her. He was trying to produce an effect\non Mr. and Mrs. G. A. Smith at a distance, with no particular result.\nIn the course of his experiment he twice used a magnesium light to\nilluminate his diagram\u2014the second time was about 11.45 p.m. He\nhad a distressing headache and found it difficult to fix his attention.\nThis is his account of what took place :\u2014.\n\"In spite of myself, I could not help taking Miss G. into this ex\nperiment. . . . Several times, to my annoyance, I awoke to the\nconsciousness that I was fixedly experimenting on Miss G., instead of my\ntwo percipients who were patiently sitting. ... On Monday evening\nMiss G. asked me what had taken place during the experiment on Sunday\nnight with Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I told her how I could not help including\nher. She said, ' I am glad to hear that, as, at first, I was inclined to think\nthat what I saw was purely imaginary, and I have a dread of thinking that\nI should be liable to subjective hallucinations. I had been in bed some\n\fJuly, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 115\nminutes, and was just dropping to sleep, when I was startled by a sudden\nblaze of light which seemed to sparkle and rise and fall. It completely\nawoke me, and I sat up in bed and examined the window to notice whether\nthe appearance came from that direction : but it did not. I, of course, was\nnot thinking of you. I struck a light to look at my watch, and found the\ntime between a quarter and ten minutes to 12.' \"\nMr. Kirk would be very glad to receive criticisms and suggestions\nfrom anyone interested in his experiments, which he is still continuing\nunder varied conditions. He also asks us to say that he will be glad\nif any lady or gentleman willing to act as percipient to him will write\nto him.\nThe following is his account of the experiments :\u2014\n2, Ripon-villas, Upper Ripon-road, Plumstead.\nOf the experiments described in this paper Nos. 4 to 13 inclusive have\nbeen made with Miss G., between Plumstead and Pembroke (South Wales),\nmyself acting as the agent in each instance. Dates and hours are recorded,\nand notes of the experiments made independently by agent and percipient.\nMy notes of each experiment, with the exception of Nos. 1, 2, and 3,\nhave been witnessed by my wife as having been written before I received\nMiss G.'s report.\nThe phenomena which have been incidental to these experiments (as also\nto some of those printed in the Journal for February) are, to the percipient :\n(1) luminous appearances in every instance ; (2) momentary or rapid flashes\nor dashes of light, continuing for some minutes ; (3) bright and constantly\nchanging appearances\u2014such as rolling clouds of light\u2014in the centre of\nfaintly luminous background ; (4) rays of strong, bright light, as though\nprojected through a small orifice ; (5) radiation, or reflection, or diffusion\nof light.\nAs probably influencing these characteristics, the visual impressions of\nthe agent will be found to be of importance, e.g., flickering of the flames of\nthe lanterns, causing moving shadows on the face of the disc, the effects of\nwhich may have distorted its shape to the eyes of the percipient. It has\nnot been found necessary to keep the body rigidly in one position during the\nexperiment,1 nor the eyes on the diagram with a fixed stare. The latter, in\nfact, has been found impossible to do, owing to the fierce glare of light\nthrown on the diagram, and relief has had to be sought by removing the\neyes from the diagram to various parts of the room, and back to the diagram,\nalternately. These movements of the eyes have probably, in some instances,\nbeen the cause of the percipient seeing \"flashes\" or \"dashes\" of light,\nand also the after-effect, or after-image, of the diagram, of which Experi\nment 1 seems to be a remarkable instance.\n1 As a matter of fact, I have frequently walked about the room, keeping my eyes,\nat the same time, on the diagram. I have also frequently altered the focus of my\ngaze by approaching close to the diagram (my eyes not being more than 12 inches from\nit) and then gradually withdrawing backwards to a distance of four or five yards,\nnoting the effect of the after-image of the diagram on the face of the diagram itself.\nAll these movements may have affected the visualisation of the percipient.\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, lsoi,\nIt must be pointed out that where black or blue letters have been on the\ndiagram they have been seen by me as black or blue letters mixed up with\nfiery, moving clouds, in the centre of the white disc or board. These\nluminous, moving, cloudy appearances are due to a defect in my vision, and\ntheir apparent transference suggests that the transference has its origin in a\nphysical or material cause.\nFor about five years, immediately past, I was troubled with a pheno\nmenon of retinal vision in seeing things either blurred or doubled. Thus, a\nnew moon appeared to me as two new moons ; a person's features were\nblurred and rendered almost unrecognisable, even at a short distance ; a\nman's legs were presented to me as four legs blended ; and a thin post, such\nas a flagstaff, became two distinct posts. To restore a normal focus, I had\nto wear specially constructed glasses ; and it is only within the past few\nmonths I have been able, without experiencing much inconvenience, to dis\npense with these glasses. Still, the visual defect is, at times, especially in\nstrong light, present, and I have experienced it more or less, in every one of\nmy experiments ; and to endeavour to overcome this tendency I have had\nto resort to a constant rapid blinking of the eyelids ; but this has only\nresulted in momentary restoration of clearness of outline ; and when an\nexperiment has been of long duration, the blinking process has entirely failed\nin its purpose, even for an instant. Besides this tendency to blur the letters,\nthe eyes became unsteady\u2014shifting\u2014and the visual combination has resulted\nin my seeing bright, central cloud-like movements, the black letters or black\ndesign in the diagram being, nevertheless, plainly visible. Again, it has not\nbeen found possible to confine these luminous clouds to a central point.\nWhenever a determined attempt has been made to keep the eyes steadily\nfixed on a diagram they have been drawn away to another part of the card\nboard in use by an exceedingly quick involuntary movement, which carried\nthe luminous after-effect with it as a trail of light.\nThere is one invariable phenomenon attending these transfers of light\nwhich, I think, it is essential to record in view of a prospective theoretical\ninvestigation, since it bears upon an unsettled question as to whether\ntelepathic transference is due \"primarily to sensation or primarily to idea.\"\nIn every instance of these experiments the white face of the disc, &c.,\nhas been seen by the percipient as faintly luminous, while the black spots,\n&c., have been seen brightly luminous\u2014in other words, the complementary\ncolours, say, or visual after-impressions of the white and black, have been\npresented to the vision of the percipient. Now, when I am looking at a\nwhite disc with, say, a black spot on it, my sensation or idea of the combina\ntion is that the white is white, and that the black is black\u2014not the comple\nmentary colours or hues, as seen by the percipient ; and if the transfer is\ndue to sensation or idea, why are not the white and black transferred as\nwhite and black? That this is not the cise would seem to demonstrate that\nthe percipient's visualisation is not affected by either sensation or idea.\nThere would appear to be a submerged activity at work transmitting, when I\nam looking at the white and black diagram, the impression of light it is making\non my brain\u2014not, it would seem, on my mind,\n\fJuly, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 117\nExperiment 1.\u2014'October 19th, 1890. 10.30. Object of transfer: A\npicture about 18in. square, narrow gilt frame, white border inside frame to\nedge of picture 4in. wide. Picture : coloured lithograph of child with white\nantimacassar thrown coquettishly over its head, on a very dark background.\nGas full on with lighted lamp, also bull's-eye lantern concentrated on picture.\nBlinked eyes many times, removed eyes from picture, casting after-impression\non various parts of the room. Closed experiment 10.50.\nMiss G.'s report:\u2014 \"Soon after 10.30 saw light reflections in various\ndirections ; cannot describe them better than by saying it seemed as if a dull\nlight were shining through a large square window. About 10.45 a small\nbright light appeared with radiations, almost as if a burning glass were being\nused ; in about two minutes it suddenly and entirely disappeared.\"\nAnalysis. \u2014Except to one \"behind the scenes,\" there would appear to\nbe little or no connection between the object set for transfer\u2014a picture\u2014\nand the \" dull light shining through a large square window.\" An outsider\nwould probably fail to see a success in the experiment. Yet it was, I think,\na remarkable success. It should be borne in mind that my experiments are\nsolely directed towards ascertaining the effects of the transfer of light. If\nyou will place a patch of dark paper on a white surface, gaze at them for a\nminute and then lift your eyes to the ceiling or cast them elsewhere, you\nwill see that the after-image of the dark patch will be more or less luminous,\nwhile the white border will appear of a bluish shade. Now, my picture was\nsquare, had a dark centre and a white border. Miss G.'s window was square,\nwith a dull light shining through the centre. The square window, then, was\nmy square picture ; the dark centre of the picture was the dull light in the\ncentre of the square window ; the dark centre of the picture having been\ntransferred sufficiently luminous to be distinguishable from the fainter lumin\nosity of the white border. Since the subject of the picture (the child) was\nnot transferred (being absorbed probably by the fierce lights employed),\nMiss G. , I think, may well be excused for likening the appearance to a window.\nBut the window is described as large. Well, your estimate of the size of the\nafter-image of the object you gaze at will depend upon the distance of the\nsurface on which you cast it. If you look beyond the object, the after-image\nwill give the idea of being larger than the object itself ; but if, on the contrary,\nyou look at the after-image nearer to yourself, it will appear smaller than\nthe object. My picture during the experiment was set upright between the\narms of an easy-chair, which was placed midway between the end of my\ndining-table and the bay window, and not more than three feet from my eyes ;\nand as I cast the after-image sometimes on the dark window curtains, some\ntimes on the wall and ceiling of the room, it seemed magnified in size.\nNow for another feature. From my notes you will see that I removed\nmy eyes from the picture, casting after-impressions of it on various parts of\nthe room. Miss G. reports that she saw light reflections (of her window) in\nvarious directions, so that it seems as though my after-images were quite\ndistinct to her perception.\n1 My notes of this experiment were made the same night, and no conversation\nrespecting it occurred between Miss G. and myself before I received her written\nreport.\n\fliS Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1891.\nThere is one more feature to be noticed. At' the end of the experiment\nMiss G. reports that she saw a \" small, bright light with radiations, almost\nas if a burning glass were being used.\"\nIn re-hanging the picture, my head would be between it and the gas\nglobe, and, as I always make a point of concentrating my mind on Miss G.\nup to the last moment, the \"small, bright light with radiations\" was probably\nthe light of the globe, and, if so, was, of course, quite an involuntary\ntransfer, since I had not the globe in my mind, but the picture only.\nExperiment 2.\u2014December 2nd, 1890. 11 to 11.30. Object : White\ncardboard (17in. by 12in.), with black letters C A in centre.

Picture hung in centre of recess. On each side of\npicture, fixed in opposite corners of recess, are two black wood fancy\nbrackets. On each bracket placed a piece of lighted candle, so that\neach candle threw a side light on face of picture. Two bull's-eye lanterns\nso placed at distances as to form reflections on picture.

Same process of\nrapidly blinking eyelids and casting after-images of picture and candles\non walls and ceiling was gone through as in former experiments. Varied\nthe process occasionally by looking directly at each lighted candle, casting\nafter-images about the walls, which reminded me of a series of fireworks.\nOn the table in the recess were piles of books ; but attention was solely\ndirected to picture and candles.

In no instance did the after-image of picture appear\notherwise than luminous.

Do not expect, however, that anything was seen but the\ncandle lights, or exhibition of 'fireworks.' Written before hearing from\nMiss G.\u2014Witness (Signed) E. Kirk.\"\nMiss G.'s report :\u2014 \"25\/1\/91 (following morning). Last night saw only\nfaint luminous appearance\u2014nothing definite. Soon after hearing eleven\nstrike, it seemed as if gas, or other light, was suddenly extinguished.\"\nRemarks from notebook:\u2014\"MissG.'s report, though short, is fully descrip\ntive of the actual result. The latter was not quite as I had anticipated, but\nwas more surprising. The light of the candles seems to have asserted its\npresence to the exclusion of every object in the recess. It will be found on\nlooking at an object placed centrally between two lights that the latter will\nclaim the most prominent attention of the eyes. Although I could see the\npicture distinctly, as also the after-images (luminous only) yet the after\nimages of the candle flames always accompanied those of the picture, and\nappeared as two blurred clouds of light. I gather from the report that\nMiss G. saw nothing but a luminous appearance\u2014a persistent patch, or\ndiffusion of light. That this luminous appearance was real, is proved by her\nremark, viz., that soon after eleven it seemed to her as if gas or other light\nhad been suddeidy extinguished. That is, she was suddenly left in the dark. *a\nNow, at about three orfour minutes after eleven, I blew out the candles, thus\nmaking the coincidence complete. It would seem from the experiment that\nthe combined candle light held entire possession of the field of vision. I\nmay add that, as I have recorded 11.15 as the time occupied with the experi\nment, I employed the remaining minutes in a catch trial on Miss G. That\nis, I cast the reflection of one bull's-eye lantern on the white disc of a\ndiagram, on the chance of impressing her while going to sleep. This was a\nfailure.\"\nThis example of the phenomenon of the dominance of candle light is not\nthe first I have noticed. It occurred in two previous experiments with Miss\nG. , but which I have to regret I have not recorded. In the first experiment\nI placed a naked candle light in front (within a couple of inohes) of the\nsame picture, casting after-images of the flame in various directions, and\noccasionally lifting my eyes from the flame in a vertical line to the ceiling\nof the room. This caused an unbroken line of light, very similar to the\nupward flight of a sky-rocket. Miss G. describes all this as something\nlike fireworks\u2014the rockets being plainly seen. The picture itself was not\nseen.\nFor the second experiment I placed the same picture on a chiffonier,\nstanding upright against a shelf which runs across it, leaving a space of\nseveral inches between the back of the picture and the back of the chiffonier,\n1 Mies G. has since told me that this effect of being suddenly left in the dark was\nwhat did actually strike her at the moment. She nardly knows how to describe\nthe luminosity she saw, but its disappearance was as sudden and realistic as though\nsomeone had really turned off the gas in her room.\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1891.\nOn the board of the latter stood various table articles, such as white stone\nware egg and cruet stands, silver toast-rack, teapot, &c. On these bright\narticles I concentrated the light of two bull's-eye lanterns, which brought\nthem into high relief. But in order to show up plainly the ornamented\nback of the chiffonier, I stood a lighted candle behind the picture. This not\nonly had the desired effect, but also cast its reflection on the wall and a bit\nof the ceiling\u2014a prominent patch of light.\nNow, bright as the reflection from the bull's-eye lanterns made the other\narticles, it was only a prominent patch of light that was seen by Miss G.,\nand this was seen very vividly.\nExperiment 5. \u2014This experiment, though somewhat more clearly defined\nthan the last, still exhibits the characteristic feature of the design in the\ndiagram being transferred as diffused and radiating light, noticeable in our\nlong-distance experiments. At a shorter distance (judging from Experi\nments 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, and 16) the form of the diagram presented to the percipient\nis more defined. These diffused and radiating effects of my long-distance\ntransfers would appear to suggest a loss of force in travelling ; that is, that\nthe initial impulse given to the vibratory current by the brain of the agent\nbecomes spent in its course, and only reaches the brain of the percipient as\ndiffused or radiating light, and sometimes in the form of \"dashes\" or\n\"flashes\" of light. Still, these luminous appearances are very far removed\nfrom flashing lights before the eyes which affect many persons. There is an\nunmistakeable resemblance to the form of the design, persistent during each\nexperiment, and which ceases when the agent ceases to operate.\n\"January 28th, 1891. 10.30 till about 11.

Wishing to kuow whether\nseeing the diagram previously would make any difference to the clearness of\nthe transfer, at my request Mr. K. rather reluctantly showed me, yesterday\nafternoon, the one he intended using last night.\n\" I did not see it any more distinctly. The five dark blue spots in centre\nof white disc were not all visible at one time ; sometimes, I caught only two,\nthen three in various positions, as very bright spots on a pale ground, with\noccasionally a brighter circle round them.\n\" This is the only time I have known what Mr. K. was going to try, and\nfeel convinced expectancy made no difference to the experiment.\n\"After about ten minutes a change came. I saw a small disc which\nseemed composed of very bright fine circular lines, which quivered and\nalmost revolved.\"\nThe feature of the receding and again advancing into view of the spots\nand circle is identical with the physical process which may be observed on\nlooking intently at an after-image. In this instance the after-image will\nremain distinct for a few moments, then gradually fade (one or two spots\nmore quickly than the others), then all the spots will return and presently\nblend into one luminous spot which, in its turn, will open out, separating\nspot by spot into five spots ; and this process will continue until the after\nimage dies away.\nIn regard to the second part of the experiment, Miss G. confesses that\nshe was unable to describe its appearances and eccentricities of movement.\nWhat occurred on my side was this :\u2014Looking fixedly, at first, at the*\ncandle flame, it presented to me the appearance of diffused faint light\nsurrounding the flame ; after gazing as long as I could endure it, I lifted the\neyes about six inches over the flame and began a revolving movement which\ncaused circular (irregular) after-images of the flame ; then returning my gaze\nto the flame, I blinked rapidly, which produced dancing and quivering\nmotions in abundance. These, with other eccentric movements I continued\nto the end of the experiment, and, in a subsequent conversation with Miss\nG. I elicited, indirectly, that these were similar to the eccentricities she\nsaw, but was unable to describe. Anything more opposite in character\nthan this change from a diagram to a candle flame could hardly be devised ;\nyet each was seen accompanied by the features corresponding to the move\nments of my eyes.\nExperiment 15. \u2014The following experiment is divided into two parts, my\nintention to do so not having been communicated to the percipient.

The diagram, however, was\nnot so brilliant under the light of the lanterns as that of the second part,\nfrom the fact that the white surface on which the letters were placed was\nonly about 4|in. by 3in., and rested on a black ground ; while the letters\nin the second part were surrounded by a large disc of white (whitening)\n7^in. in diameter.\nThe diagram as seen by Miss G. in the second part, when the smallness\nof the letters and the distance of percipient from agent (400 yards) are taken\ninto consideration, must be deemed as highly satisfactory\u2014since it is the\nfirst time I have attempted to transfer letters so small as these ; and the\nresult, to me, is surprising. I have no doubt that, but for the constant\nblinking of the eyelids, and consequent unsteadiness, or wavering (or\n\" dancing \" as Miss G. describes the phenomenon) the word itself would have\nbeen distinctly read.

J. LODGE'S ADDRESS AS PRESIDENT OF\nTHE PHYSICAL SECTION OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIA\nTION AT CARDIFF.\nIt is an epoch worth noting in the history of Psychical Research\nwhen it for the first time finds a place in an address by a President of\na section of the British Association,\u2014and this has occurred since the\nissue of the last number of our Journal. Professor Lodge brought it\nforward in his address as President of Section A at Cardiff in August\nlast, and claimed for it a right to consideration by physicists.\nWe cannot here reproduce the whole address\u2014nor even that portion\nof it which refers to our subjects. For a full report we must refer our\nreaders to the Report of the British Association meeting at Cardiff\nwhen that is published. But we may give some idea of what was said.\nAfter discussing various matters belonging to orthodox physics,\nProfessor Lodge proceeds to take a \" wider range \" and \" to speak of\na topic which is as yet beyond the pale of scientific orthodoxy.\" He\nfirst argues against the attitude of mind of those who would hinder\nfree inquiry, or who hesitate to avow an interest in unorthodox\nsubjects, concluding that :\u2014\nCaution and slow progress are extremely necessary ; fear of avowing\ninterest or of examining into unorthodox facts is, I venture to say, not in\naccordance with the highest traditions of the scientific attitude.\nHe proceeds to \"try to state what this field is, the exploration of\nwhich is regarded as so dangerous.\"\nI might call it the borderland of physics and psychology. I might call\nit the connection between life and energy ; or the connection between mhid\nand matter. It is an intermediate region, bounded on the north by psycho\nlogy, on the south by physics, on the east by physiology, and on the west by\npathology and medicine. An occasional psychologist has groped down into\nit and become a metaphysician. An occasional physicist has wandered up\ninto it and lost his base, to the horror of his quondam brethren. Biologists\nmostly look at it askance, or deny its existence. A few medical practitioners,\nafter long maintenance of a similar attitude, have begun to annex a portion\nof its western frontier. The whole region seems to be inhabited mainly by\nsavages, many of them, so far as we can judge from a distance, given to\ngross superstition. It may, for all I know, have been hastily traversed and\nrudely surveyed by a few clear-eyed travellers ; but their legends concern\ning it are not very credible, certainly are not believed.\nHe goes on to explain why and how the subject should be\napproached by physicists.\nA vulnerable spot on our side seems to be the connection between life\nand energy. The conservation of energy has been so long established as to\nhave become a commonplace, The relation of life to energy is not under\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., isoi.\nstood. Life is not energy, and the death of an animal affects the amount of\nenergy no whit ; yet a live animal exerts control over energy which a dead\none cannot. Life is a guiding or directing principle, disturbing to the\nphysical world but not yet given a place in the scheme of physics. The\ntransfer of energy is accounted for by the performance of work ; the guid\nance of energy needs no work, but demands force only. What is force ?\nand how can living beings exert it in the way they do 1\nBy what means is force exerted, and what, definitely, is force or stress 1\nI can hardly put the question here and now so as to be intelligible, except to\nthose who have approached and thought over the same difficulties ; but I\nventure to say that there is here something not provided for in the orthodox\nscheme of physics ; that modern physics is not complete, and that a line of\npossible advance lies in this direction.\nI might go further. Given that force can be exerted by an act of will,\ndo we understand the mechanism by which this is done 1 And if there is a\ngap in our knowledge between the conscious idea of a motion and the libera\ntion of muscular energy needed to accomplish it, how do we know that a body\nmay not be moved without ordinary material contact by an act of will ? I\nhave no evidence that such a thing is possible. I have tried once or twice\nto observe its asserted occurrence, and failed to get anything that satisfied\nme. Others may have been more fortunate. In any case, I hold that wo\nrequire more knowledge before we can deny the possibility. If the conser\nvation of energy were upset by the process, we should have grounds for\ndenying it ; but nothing that we know is upset by the discovery of a novel\nmode of communicating energy, perhaps some more immediate action through\nthe ether. It is no use theorising ; it is unwise to decline to examine pheno\nmena because we feel too sure of their impossibility. We ought to know the\nuniverse very thoroughly and completely before we take up that attitude.\nAgain, it is familiar that a thought may be excited in the brain of another\nperson, transferred thither from our brain, by pulling a suitable trigger ; by\nliberating energy in the form of sound, for instance, or by the mechanical\nact of writing, or in other ways. A pre-arranged code called language, and\na material medium of communication, are the recognised methods. May\nthere not also be an immaterial (perhaps an ethereal) medium of communi\ncation ? Is it possible that an idea can be transferred from one person to\nanother by a process such as we have not yet grown accustomed to, and know\npractically nothing about 1 In this case I have evidence. I assert that I\nhave seen it done ; and am perfectly convinced of the fact. Many others\nare satisfied of the truth of it too. Why must we speak of it with bated\nbreath, as of a thing of which we are ashamed 1 What right have we to be\nashamed of a truth ?\nAnd after all, when we have grown accustomed to it, it will not seem\naltogether strange. It is, perhaps, a natural consequence of the community\nof life or family relationship running through all living beings. The trans\nmission of life may be likened in some ways to the transmission of mag\nnetism, and all magnets are sympathetically connected, so that if suitably\n\fOct., 1s9L] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 133\nsuspended a vibration from one disturbs others, even though they be distant\nninety-two million miles.\nIt is sometimes objected that, granting thought-transference or telepathy\nto be a fact, it belongs more especially to lower forms of life, and that as the\ncerebral hemispheres develop wo become independent of it ; that what we\nnotice is the relic of a decaying faculty, not the germ of a new and fruitful\nsense ; and that progress is not to be made by studying or attending to it.\nIt may be that it is an immature mode of communication, adapted to lower\nstages of consciousness than ours, but how much can we not learn by study\ning immature stages 1 As well might the objection be urged against a study\nof embryology. It may, on the other hand, as W. F. Barrett has suggested,\nbe an indication of a higher mode of communication, which shall survive our\ntemporary connection with ordinary matter.\nI have sjioken of the apparently direct action of mind on mind, and of a\npossible action of mind on matter. But the whole region is unexplored\nterritory, and it is conceivable that matter may react on mind in a way we\ncan at present only dimly imagine. In fact, the barrier between the two\nmay gradually melt away, as so many other barriers have done, and wo may\nend in a wider perception of the unity of nature, such as philosophers have\nalready dreamt of.\nI care not what the end may be. I do caro that the inquiry shall bo\nconducted by us, and that we shall be free from the disgrace of jogging along\naccustomed roads, leaving to isolated labourers the work, the ridicule, and\nthe gratification of unfolding a new region to unwilling eyes.\nIt may be held that such investigations are not physical and do not concern\nus. We cannot tell without trying ; and as the results are physical, or at\nleast have a physical side, it seems reasonable to assume that the process by\nwhich they are produced is a proper subject for physical inquiry. I believe\nthat there is something in this region which does concern us as physicists.\nIt may concern other sciences too. It must indeed concern biology ; but\nwith that I have nothing to do. Biologists have their region, we have ours,\nand there is no need for us to hang back from an investigation because they\ndo. Our own science, of Physics or Natural Philosophy in its widest sense,\nis the King of the Sciences, and it is for us to lead, not to follow.\nProfessor Lodge then, after urging confidence in the ultimate Intelli\ngibility of the universe and pointing out that at first all things look\nmysterious, says :\u2014\nIf I were asked (as I am not) to suggest any practical proposal for imme\ndiate action in the direction indicated, I should not urge anything at all\nrevolutionary. I do not think that the time is ripe for the Royal Society,\nfor instance, to move in the matter ; the early stages of such an investiga\ntion, in which the human element is so obtrusive and perturbing, may very\nproperly be left to a society devoted to that special end. ... I do,\nhowever, think that whenever in the view of the leaders of that society the\ntime may have come to put the scientific world in official possession of their\nmore securely ascertained facts\u2014for instance, by presenting a report to this\nor some other section\u2014they ought not to ask in vain for some recognition\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Experimental apparition.\nFor the following account of an attempt to produce an apparition\nof himself we are indebted to Dr. A. S. Wiltse, Honorary Associate of\nthe American Branch of the S.P.R. The result if more than a coinci\ndence\u2014and it is difficult to believe that it was not\u2014was very curious:\u2014\nMarch Wtk, 1891.\nSome weeks ago several persons were passing the evening at my house,\nand two children, a little girl of eight years and a boy of six years, whose\nmother is stopping with us, had been put to bed in an adjoining room, the\ndoor between the rooms being closed. The company were engaged in games\nthat did not interest me, and I took a seat some five feet from the bedroom\ndoor and began trying to make the boy see my form in the room at his bed\nside, he being on the front side of the bed. I knew the children were awake,\nas I could hear them laughing. After some ten or fifteen minutes, the boy\nsuddenly screamed as if frightened, and, hurrying in there, I found the little\nfellow buried up in tho bedclothes and badly frightened, but he seemed\nashamed of his fright and would not tell me what was the matter.\nI kept the matter of my having tried an experiment a thorough secret,\nand after some two weeks it came out through the little girl that Charlie\nthought he saw a \"great big tiger standing by his bed looking at him, and he\ncould see Uncle Hime (myself) in the tiger's eyes.\" What was the tiger? I\nhad not thought of any form but my own. The child lives in Cleveland,\nOhio, and has seen the collections in Zoological Gardens, but has not been\ntaught the different colours. I have just now shown him the plates in\nWood's Natural History, and he pointed out a lion as the animal he saw,\nbut as the plates are not coloured, they are littlo good for the purpose ; but\nas I began at tho back of the book and took through all sorts first, and the\nlion was the first and only animal designated by him as the one he had seen\n\fOct., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 135\nin the room, I conclude he was nearly enough to the classification for our\npurpose.

I do this not from any\ndesire on my part to shirk duty, or to tax you with work I might do myself,\nbut think it better upon general principles that in these matters, whether of\nmy own experiments or those of others, the evidence should be given to\nyou as directly as possible, and with as little manipulating by the experimenter\nas may be, as it is very natural for even men of science to make their own\nsuccesses look as large as possible, and their failures as small as possible. It\nrequires self-denial to forego such desire.\nMrs. Wiltse and Dr. Wiltse's son write as follows :\u2014\nSkiddy, Kansas, March 28th, 1891.\nI was present when Josie Skene told papa what her brother Charlie was\nscared about.\nShe said that Charlie throwed the cover over his head and told her that\nhe saw a tiger, and Uncle Hime, as he called papa, was in the tiger's eyes.\nJason Wiltse.\nI certify that the above statement is substantially correct, as I also heard\nthe little girl relate it.

Whether the impulse to telegraph was really connected\nwith the dying lady's condition we cannot, of course, say, but the\ncoincidence was certainly remarkable :\u2014\nMay 24th, 1891.\nMadame X. was a very remarkable woman, and I was most deeply\nattached to her. She had had great troubles and difficulties in her life, an\nunhappy marriage, and two sons who were entirely educated by her.\nWhen they came to London as clerks in the City she followed them to make\na home for them there ; but as one was soon sent out to work at Hong-Kong\nand the other to a business at Bahia, she sought employment for herself in\nLondon and came to us as governess in 1864. In 1869 she became ill, and\nspent the winter alone at Bournemouth. She and I wrote constantly to\neach other, and when she moved to Norwood for the summer of 1870 my\neldest brother and I went often to spend long afternoons with her. He died\nthat summer, and although she had not left her sofa for months she came\nat once to see me when she heard of our great sorrow ; the doctor said he\nhad never seen such an indomitable spirit as she showed through her illness,\nand when in the spring of 1871 Sir J. Burrows told her that she had not\nmany months to live she resolved to go out to Hong-Kong and see her\neldest son once more. It was not thought that she would survive the\nvoyage. Our deep love for each other was unchangeable, and this final fare\nwell was a great grief to us both. She reached Hong-Kong and spent the\nlast 18 months of her life with her son there. I heard from her by every\nmail.\nIn 1872 I married, and shortly afterwards we were quartered at the\nCurragh. It was from there that I sent the telegram which she received less\nthan 24 hours before her death. Until 2 years ago I had in my possession a\nfew faint lines written by her on blue foreign paper, saying she had received\nmy message and that her \"fever dreams \" were filled with memories of our\nhappy days together at Cannes and elsewhere. Her son is now dead. He\ncame to see me in '76 and told me that my telegram had made his mother\nvery happy.\nThe impulse that made me communicate with her on that particular day\nwas a very strong one. It came to me suddenly and not in consequence of any\n\fOct., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 137\nincreased anxiety from news received. On the contrary, the accounts were\nquite satisfactory. I had heard from her by the mail a few days before. I\nasked my husband to go with me to the Curragh Post-office as I wished to find\nout the cost of a telegram to China, and he accompanied me to the Post-\noffice and we were told it would cost \u00a35 to send 12 words or so, I think. I\nat once wrote and sent the message containing a few words of loving greet\ning. These words she received and acknowledged only a few hours before\nher death. Evelyn de Vesci.\nLord de Vesci adds :\u2014\nI certify that the account given by Lady de Vesci is correct and accurate.\nDe Vesci.\nJune 2nd, 1891.\nL. 886. AdPn Impulse.\nThe following may also be a telepathic incident, the impulse to\nplay the particular tune being due to communication from the dying\nfriend's mind. The account was sent to Mr. Myers by Mrs. Moul,\nof 2, Prince's-mansions, Victoria-street, S.W. (whom he knows), in\nNovember, 1889.\nAfter describing how the first time she heard Schubert's JHomens\nMusicals No. 2, in 1876, it was associated with a sad and tragic\nincident, Mrs. Moul continues :\u2014\nOn my return to England some months after, I went to stay with a very\ndear friend, Mrs. Weatherby, at Cookham. We were alone, and I was in the\nhabit of playing to her always in the twilight, till the dressing bell rang. One\nevening I played this weird lament of Schubert's, which had so many sad\nmemories for me. When it was ended, my friend, contrary to her usual\nhabit, made no remark for some time ; when she did speak, she did not refer\nto what I had played or ask what it was, but said, \"I want you to make\nme a promise.\" Of course I gave it, and she said, \" Whenever I feel I am\ndying, if I am conscious, I shall send for you and you must play that to me ;\nwill you come ? \" I was impressed by the music affecting her in this way,\nand I then told her of the interest it held for me which I had not before\nspoken of, as my relatives and Mr. and Mrs. H. were all unknown to her.\nAfter this she would ask me, if we were alone, to play \" My death song.\"\nOnce she asked this in her husband's presence, and seeing he was seriously\nannoyed, I made light of the remark, but she told him she was quite serious,\nand spoke of her wish to pass from life with these notes in her ears. In the\nyears 1887 and 1888 we had seen but little of each other. I had been\nmuch out of England with the constant care of an invalid, and she had\npassed much time in Scotland. Nor did we correspond often. She had,\nand always had had, a repugnance to letter writing, and generally made a\nsecretary of her niece, who lived with her. I last saw her in the month of\nMay, 1888, when I was starting for Germany and Switzerland, and on my\nreturn she was in Scotland. She wrote me at Christmas, and said, \" Come\nsoon if you can to Cookham, I long for some music,\" but the return of my\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The next day my husband said,\n\" I saw Nellie Weatherby in Piccadilly this morning, she looked so well.\"\nHe was driving, so had not spoken to her. From this I knew she was in\ntown, but had not her address, as they always took a furnished house from\nMarch till May. On the 6th of March my brother and his wife were dining\nwith us. After dinner she asked me to play, and I began some waltzes and\nlively music. Suddenly and unconsciously to myself I found myself playing\nSchubert's Momens Musicals. When I had finished, my sister-in-law said,\n' ' That is pretty but very sad. \" \" Yes, \" I said, ' ' I can't think how I came to\nplay it, I very seldom do unless to Nellie Weatherby ; she is so fond of it.\"\n\"Have you seen her lately?\" she said, \"and how is she ? \" I replied,\n\" Perfectly well, I hear, but I am very astonished at not having received her\naddress, as I hear she is in town.\" Two days after I heard of her death.\nShe died on the 6th March, at 8.20 in the evening, having been unconscious\nto all around her for seven hours. I took no notice of the time at which I\nwas playing Schubert on the evening of the 6th, but we dined at 7, and it\nwas our usual way to be in the drawing-room a little beforo 8, and I know I\nwent to the piano on entering the room.\nL. 887. A* Pt\nThe following letter appeared in the Religio-Philosophical Journal\nfor November 22nd, 1890 :\u2014\nAnother Compact Fulfilled.\nTo THE Editor,\u2014An article in the Journal, headed, \"A Compact Ful\nfilled,\" reminds me of an incident in my own experience which occurred\nseveral years since. I was invited by a lady whose acquaintance I had made\nvery singularly, being attracted to me through my writing for the Journal, to\nvisit her. I had never met her husband or family, nor was I at all acquainted\nin Mendota, where they lived. After spending a few days with them and\npartaking of their generous hospitality, the night before I was to leave for\nhome she asked me if I was willing she should invite in a few friends of hers,\nand allow my influences to control me for anything they might have to\ncommunicate. I readily agreed. That evening their handsome parlours were\nfilled with a goodly company ; some believers in the philosophy, others investi\ngating, and still others who were entirely sceptical. The host, Mr. Johns, his\nbrother, and a friend of theirs, a professor of music, whose name has escaped\nme, gave some excellent music upon the piano, violin, and bass viol, which had\na tendency to harmonise the company ; soon my controls took possession and\npointing out different ones in the room gave whatever they were able to give,\nand all were asked whether they recognised the spirit giving the message or\nbeing described. Several expressed themselves satisfied as to the identity of\nthe spirit communication. Finally, after the description of a very small old\nlady, seemingly about eighty years of age, walking with a cane was given\nto a Mr. Marsten\u2014a prominent photographer there\u2014he was asked the usual\nquestion, whereupon he arose and said the description was a perfect one of\nhis mother who lived many miles from there ; for she was, he said, still in\n\fOct., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Mesearch. 139\nthe form, at least he supposed so, as when he heard from her only a few days\nbefore she was in her usual health. The next morning on our way to the\ndepot to take the cars for home, passing his studio in company with Mrs. Johns,\nwe called in to bid Mr. and Mrs. Marsten good-bye, when to our surprise\nMrs. Marsten told us that the night before, while they were at the house of\nMrs. Johns, a telegram had come, telling of the sudden death of his mother.\nNo one being at home the telegram was not delivered until morning, and she\nsaid Mr. Marsten was at that time packing his things to leave on the next\ntrain to attend his mother's funeral. She also said Mr. Marsten's mother\nwas not a believer, although her son had had many talks with her on the\nsubject of spirit return, and once she had told him, if she went first, and\nfound it to be a truth, she would surely come back, and if permitted would\nmanifest her presence to him. Thus was another \"compact fulfilled.\"\nC. A. R.\nMr. Hodgson having learnt from Colonel Bundy, editor of the\nReligio-Philosophical Journal, that the initials C. A. R. were those of\nMrs. J. R. Robinson\u2014a person of good repute\u2014wrote to her and\nreceived the following reply :\u2014\nChicago, January 6th, 1891.\nIn regard to the incident related in the R.-P. Journal under heading of\n\"Another Compact Fulfilled \" I think it occurred some four or five years\nsince, as far as I can now remember. I was not at that time, nor have I ever\nbeen, a public medium, but was in the habit of sitting for friends and friends'\nfriends. At that time I was hearing what I termed \"The Voices,\" and by\nrequest of Colonel Bundy allowed them to be published. But after they had\nbeen published awhile, I received so many letters, some of enquiry, but\nmore of requests, from those who seemed to think that by only asking I\ncould get messages from their friends, which I felt common politeness\nobliged me to reply to, even when many of them (through thoughtlessness I\nsuppose) came without an enclosed stamp, I found the attempt to answer\nbecame too burdensome, to say nothing of the expense ; and consequently\nsent no more for publication, telling Colonel Bundy the reason. It was\nthrough these letters that a Mrs. Belle Johns, of Mendota, wrote to me\u2014a\nperfect stranger. After corresponding and receiving several calls from her\nwhen she would come into Chicago, she invited me to spend a week with her,\nwhich I accepted, and found the family a very pleasant one\u2014everything was\ndone for my comfort and pleasure while there. At the end of my visit, my\nhusband having come after me, and spending a day with the family, Mrs. J.\nasked me if I would not consent to have her invite in a few friends the last\nevening of my stay. As my health was not good, I had merely gone there\nfor the purpose of recuperating, and until then had not been asked to use\nmy medium powers, nor had I met anyone outside of their own family and\nimmediate relatives who lived on each side of them, thus all who were\nthere that night were perfect strangers to me. My mediumship had never\nbeen tested in so large and promiscuous a company, and I assure you I had\ngrave doubts of my influences being able to use me on the occasion ; but I\nfelt so grateful to them (almost strangers as they were) for giving me such a\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1891.\nrest that I was unwilling to refuse the request. It was under these circum\nstances that the incident related in the Journal occurred. There were very\nmany tests given to others of the company, but this was more impressed\nupon my mind, on account of the annoyance I felt at my influences describ\ning so perfectly a person whom the son said was in the form, and then the\nnext morning learning that his mother had really passed on and was not as\nhe supposed in the form. Mr. Marsten and wife, I was told, not long after\nthat removed to California ; but what part I am unable to tell you, and as it is\nnearly two years since I have seen or heard from Mrs. Johns (although the\nlast pleasant letter I had from her was duly answered) I cannot tell you any\nthing about them, though I have no doubt they are still living in Mendota.\nI do not remember Mr. Johns' first name, but a letter to Mrs. Belle Johns\nwould, if they are there, be sure to reach her. I suppose the reason of our\nlosing sight of each other is on account of our moving from our former\nquarters, though had she consulted the city directory she could readily\nhave found us, as my husband is a prominent business man here, connected\nas travelling passenger agent with the Southern Pacific Co.\nI became so thoroughly disgusted with the class of mediums in this city\nthat I after a time ceased to sit for anyone, although I often still hear voices ;\nbut as I never hear them except when entirely alone, I readily understand\nthat for your purpose they would be of little, if any, use to you, as you\nwould only have my word for it that the voices came from those quite\nunknown to me.\nI could write a book on the many tests and experiences I have had and\ngiven to others from those who have passed on, not one of whom I had ever\nbefore heard from, for, strange to say, no one of my family or friends hero\nhave ever used my organism to send me a single message, and I have come\nto the conclusion that this is design on the part of my spiritual guides, as I\nthink they were more intent on convincing my husband and myself (who\nwere exceedingly sceptical on the subject of the spirit's return) that this was\nreally so, rather than to convince others, and even now neither of us believe\nany manifestation purporting to come from spirits which can be accounted\nfor in any other way.\nClaka A. Robinsok.\nMrs. Johns writes as follows :\u2014\nJanuary 23rd, 1891.\nAs near as I can remember the circumstance referred to in your letter\nwas this :\u2014Mrs. Robinson made me a visit, and the evening before she and\nher husband left for home, I invited in a few friends (a dozen or more). Mrs.\nRobinson was controlled, giving several tests to others, the nature of which\nI have now forgotten. Coming to Mr. Marsten, she described a very old\nlady, quite small, walking with a cane, standing in front of him. I do not\nthink she gave any message, but he said it was a perfect description of his\nmother, but that she was still living ; he having heard from her only a short\ntime before. The next morning I went with Mr. and Mrs. R. to the depot'\nand stopped on our way at Mr. Marsten's photo gallery. We were surprised\nwhen they informed us that Mr. Marsten's mother was dead. A telegram\nannouncing his mother's death had been brought to their house the night\n\fOot., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 141\nbefore while they were at my home.

Dean, 19, Nightingale-lane, Widmore, Bromley,\nKent. The case being a remote one it has not been possible to find\nany corroboration of the coincidence, beyond the fact that the death\noccurred on a Sunday (as stated in the first account), a date about\nwhich it is obvious that memory can be relied on more than about any\nother day in the week.\nOctober 6th, 1889.\nIn regard of the light I saw in the year 1851 at the Manor House, Lee,\nKent ; the property of Lord Northbrook, but rented by Mrs. Dent, formerly\nMrs. Robert, while I was under-gardener at that time. It was to this effect.\nIt was May, C o'clock in the evening. I was anxious to get to church\u2014our\nparish church. I had got a bedroom, sitting ditto, commonly called a\nbothy, at the back of a greenhouse in the flower-garden. I had an upright\niron stove in one corner of my bedroom, and had made it red hot, and as\nI did not like to leave it so I had determined to see it cooled down so as I\nwould leave it safe. I had been to see twice, and the third time I looked\nat it I pronounced it all right. I turned to come out of the bedroom\nquickly, and on my bed I thought I saw a light like a candle, in the corner\nof my right eye\u2014a glimpse. I did not stop to look at it, but shut the\nbedroom door, when I became trembling, and my hair stood up like hop-\npoles. I said to myself, I must see what that was ; so I opened the door of\nmy bedroom, and to my astonishment I saw the room full of fire, and it\nturned into a beautiful spinning wheel, going round at a tremendous rate.\nWhat with fire and smoke it filled the room ; I thought the place would be\nburnt down. It lasted a quarter of a minute, and then went out, and nothing\nto be seen. I locked the room up and went to church, but I thought I\nsaw in the centre of the firework at one time a face- -I mean a human face,\nbut the more I looked at it the more I was puzzled. I do not think I was\nfour feet from it, and it made no noise. I had got at that time a stout\nheart, I was not frightened at anything ; but when returning from church and\ngoing into my bothy, I was very nervous. I had a good mind not to go there\nany more, but the consequences would have been to give the situation up,\nand you know people are so ready to call you cranky if you say anything, so\nI went to bed and I had a nice night's rest, and told nobody about it.

[Oct., 1891.\nSunday following I went as usual to Chislehurst, always onco a month, to\nmy parents, and in the course of our talking my mother said to me, \"Your\nAunt Lizzy is dead.\" I then asked what time she died, and from what she\ninformed me it was about the same time as I saw the fire.\nII. Dean.\nIn answer to questions, Mr. Dean states that he had never had any\nother hallucinations than the one described, and that he did not know\nthat his aunt was ill at the time. She lived about five miles away,\nbut he never went to see her and was not in the habit of thinking of\nher.\nMr. G. A. Smith, who had an interview with Mr. Dean on May\n14th, 1891, writes:\u2014\nI called upon Mr. Humphrey Dean at Bromley to-day. He is a gardener.\nHe is of a thoughtful turn of mind, and evidently anxious to be accurate in\nhis statements. Ho described his experience to me just as he has written\nit. It certainly seems to have made a deep impression upon him, and he\nsays that nothing like it ever occurred to him before or since. He did not\nmention the matter to anyone, as he was afraid of being doubted or laughed\nat ; it was not until his mother mentioned the aunt's death on the following\nSunday that ho described what he had seen. He had not been thinking of\nhis aunt more than usual, in fact he does not think she had occurred to his\nmind for weeks ; he certainly did not, at the time, associate her with the\nfiery appearance. It seemed to him that the appearance was probably a\n\"token\" of something, and when he reflected upon it at the time he\nremembered that there was something resembling a face or head in the\ncentro of the revolving wheel of fire\u2014\" something like a small image,\" Mr.\nDean said. Whilst the wheel was presenting itself to his gaze, Mr. Dean was\nmuch impressed by the amount of brilliant fire and smoke apparently thrown\noff by it ; he thought the room must catch fire. The fiery disc was about four\nfeet in diameter, and as it rapidly revolved its edge seemed turned away\nfrom him as though deflected by a strong current of air blowing from him\ntowards it, the smoke also floating away from where he stood towards the\nopposite wall. The whole thing lasted about as long as it would take him to\ncount 20, he thinks.\nWe find from the register at Somerset House that Eliza Dean\ndied on the 2nd January, 1853, at the age of 53. The almanack shows\nthat this date fell upon a Sunday. The burial took place on the 4th\nof January\u2014two days after the death\u2014as recorded in the Chislehurst\nparish church register, a certified extract from which has been sent\nto us by Mr. Dean. Mr. Dean tells us, in a letter dated May 25th,\n1891, that on thinking over the event, before seeing the register, he\nconcluded that \"it must have occurred in 1852, and that it was in\nthe winter time, as it was so dark.\" In his first account, he gave May\nas the month when it happened.\n\fOct., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 143\nL. 889. Ad Pn Visual. Borderland.\nMiss M. Benson sends us the following narrative from a lady\nknown to her, whom we will call Mrs. L. Mrs. L. is unwilling that\nher name or that of the person whose apparition she saw should be\npublished :\u2014\nC. G. W. was a pupil of my husband's ; at the end of the term of pupil\nage he remained with him as assistant, and after three or four years he\npassed an examination very creditably and gained a good appointment in\nIndia. He bade us good-bye and set sail from Southampton. In making\nthe passage of the Red Sea he went down in the Camatic, and appeared at\nmy bedside on the night of the occurrence. When asked to describe his\nappearance at the time, I said he looked like a drowned person. When the\nvessel in which he sailed returned to Southampton, one of the officers posted\nto me a packet of lace which C. G. W. had bought for me at Malta. He\nwas prompted to this kind thought of me doubtless by the remembrance of\nmuch kindness received from my husband and by my regret at the loss to the\nlatter of a really valuable assistant.\nThis account was written in 1889. We have ascertained that the\nwreck, of the Camatic took place on September 13th, 1869.\nMiss Benson obtained verbally from Mrs. L. further particulars\nabout the appearance, and gives the following account of it :\u2014\nMrs. L. was ill\u2014it was about a fortnight after the birth of a child\u2014a\nnurse was in the room asleep. She thinks she had not been sleeping, and is\nsure she was not sleeping at the time. She saw the figure standing close at\nthe side of the bed. It was quite substantial, \" not at all like a ghost,\" but\ndressed in something light. It disappeared in a moment, and she called and\nawoke the nurse at once, who asked her what it was like. She said, ' ' Like a\ndrowned man,\"\u2014though she had never seen a drowned person. She couldn't\ntell me exactly what made her think he looked drowned, except the general\ndroop of the clothes, and the face was dead\u2014she doesn't remember that it\nlooked wet. She was frightened at the time, but says her husband thought\nmore of it afterwards than she did. She didn't connect it with anything\nhappening to him, and was surprised when she heard he was drowned.\nUnfortunately she doesn't know where the nurse is. Everyone in the\nhouse heard about it before the news of the death came. I don't think she\nis likely to exaggerate at all. She said she hadn't thought of it as a thing of\nany general interest, and she rather distrusts her own accuracy, as it was so\nlong ago. One thing\u2014which her daughter pointed out\u2014in which there is a\nwant of coincidence is the dress. She said he was working at the pumps\nuntil the ship went down, so that he could hardly have been dressed in any\nthing white and flowing.\nNo further evidence seems to be obtainable.\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1891.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\"NEGATIVE hallucinations.\nTo the Editor of the. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir,\u2014It is always instructive to trace the analogy between hypnotic\nphenomena and the actions which take place during ordinary states of con\nsciousness, and the following appears to me to be a case in point.\nI was engaged in some amateur carpentering work, and in the course of\nit I laid down the two foot rule I was using upon the carpenter's bench.\nShortly afterwards requiring to use it again I looked for it, but it was gone.\nSurprised at its disappearance I distrusted my own memory and concluded I\nmust have deposited it elsewhere, and accordingly searched all round the room.\nNot finding it I returned to the bench and this time instituted a most careful\nsearch all over it, but to no effect. Thoroughly baffled I hunted about the\nroom again, and finally turning to the bench a third time, I at once saw the\nrule lying in the most conspicuous place possible, spread open, and on the\ntop of everything else, plainly visible from every part of the room. Some\nthing like this has happened once or twice to mo before in my life, but never\nto the samo extent.\nI do not know whether any physiological explanation could be afforded\nfor the invisibility of the foot rule. If it could, it would be of a kind equally\napplicable to negative hallucinations in general. But whatever may be the\nprocess involved, the real interest of the case seems to me to lie in the\nrationale of it. Mental abstraction and indifference to sensory impressions\nhave always been considered to be dependent upon the concentration of the\nattention on other matters, but the peculiarity of the case above named\nis that it was just the reverse of this. Instead of my attention being absorbed\nin other ways, it was entirely fixed on the effort to find the foot rule ; indeed,\nthe loss was of such an irritating kind, owing to the interruption of my work,\ntogether with the knowledge that the instrument must be close at hand all\nthe time, that I felt a kind of exasperated earnestness in seeking for it.\nThe case may throw some light, I think, upon some cases in which articles\nare stated to have been mysteriously removed and replaced, and these move\nments attributed to the agency of \" spirits.\" It is well to exhaust natural\nexplanations before assuming supernatural ones.

It was more largely attended than any after\nnoon meeting yet held.\nMe. Myehs read an account of his visit to Dr. Backman, at\nKalmar, in Sweden, and of some experiments in clairvoyance tried\nwhile he was there, which will appear in the next number of the Pro\nceedings. Its main interest lay in the high opinion of Dr. Backman\nas an investigator in Psychical Research, which personal acquaintance\nhad led him to form. In the course of his remarks he mentioned, what\nDr. Backman stated in his paper published in the last number of the\nProceedings, that his subjects were put into a very light stage of\nhypnotic trance for these clairvoyant experiments, and that they\nremembered afterwards their trance impressions, and could even\nsupplement what they had said.\nIn connexion with this, a question was asked by Mr. F. W. Hayes\nas to how the sleep was induced.\nMe. Myers replied that Dr. Backman sometimes used passes, some\ntimes suggestion without passes. With an entirely new subject he\ngenerally used passes.\nPeofessoe Baeeett asked in what position letters which the\nhypnotised subject attempted to read clairvoyantly were held, e.g.,\nwere they held against the forehead or the pit of the stomach 1\nMr. Myers replied that they were merely held in her hand. Dr.\nBackman had tried different positions, but did not consider that the\nposition made any difference in the results.\nMe. Leap then read a paper by Mes. H. Sidgwick on telepathic\nclairvoyance, which was discussed mainly in relation to two special\noases in which the percipient saw in hallucination or vision the con\ndition of the distant agent. These it is proposed to print in the next\nnumber of the Proceedings.\nMe. Myees afterwards read a paper, which it is also intended to\npublish in the Proceedings, on movements of objects occurring under\ncircumstances when the movements could not apparently be accounted\n\fNov., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 147\nfor by known, physical laws. He quoted two accounts of such\noccurrences. In one of them, describing how small pieces of wood flew\nabout in a carpenter's shop in a mysterious manner for about 5\nweeks, it was mentioned that they would fall to the ground noise\nlessly even after a somewhat rapid flight.\nMr. A. R. Wallace, commenting on this last circumstance, said\nthat he had noticed a similar noiselessness when furniture was moved\nat seances, and remarked that as the carpenters did not appear to have\nhad experience of seances the coincidence between their experience and\nhis was remarkable, and tended to confirm the correctness of the\nobservation.\nAnother Gentleman, who did not wish to give his name, recounted\nsimilar incidents.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL. 892. Ad Pn Visual and Auditory.\nThe following account of a very curious experience of Mr. Dickin\nson, a photographer, of 43, Grainger-street, Newcastle-on-Tyne, was\nobtained for us by Mr. E. T. Nisbet, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, in February\nlast, but we have waited to print it until he had procured some further\nevidence that appeared necessary. Mr. Dickinson's narrative has, in\nthe meanwhile, appeared in the Practical Photographer, and been copied\nthence in various newspapers. We give it here in full, with such\nadditional evidence as we have been able to procure.\nFebruary 25th, 1891.\nOn Saturday, the 3rd of January this year, I arrived at my place of\nbusiness a few minutes before 8 a.m. The outer door is protected by an\niron gate, in which is a smaller lock-up gate, through which I passed into\nthe premises. Having opened the office and turned the gas on at meter,\nand lit the gas-fire, I stood at the office counter for a few minutes waiting for\nthe lad who takes down the iron gate at the front door. Before the lad\ncame, however, a gentleman called to inquire if his photographs were finished ;\nI asked him if he had the receipt (which usually accompanies any inquiry),\nand ho replied that he had no receipt, but his photograph was taken on\n(giving the date), and that the prints were promised to be sent to him before\nthis call. Having got the date and his name, I referred to my book and\nfound the order as he stated. I read out to him the name and address, to\nwhich he replied, \"That is right.\" In my book I found a date given on\nwhich the negative was ready to be put into the printer's hands, and the date\nbeing 17 days previous I had no hesitation in saying, \"Well, if you call\nlater on you will get some,\" and I called his attention to the fact that\nit was very early, and explained to him that the employees would not\nbe at work until nine o'clock, and if he could call after that time he would\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1891.\nbo certain to get some of his photographs. He said, \"I have been travelling\nall night, and cannot call again.\" With that he turned abruptly, and went\nout. Anxious to retain his good will, I shouted after him, \"Can I post\nwhat may be done 1 \" but I got no answer. I turned once more to\nthe book, looked at the number, and on a slip of paper wrote, \"No. 7,976,\nThompson, post.\" (This I wrote with pen and ink, and have the paper\nyet.) At nine o'clock, when Miss S. (clerk and reception-room attendant)\ncame, I handed the slip of paper to her and asked her to have it attended\nto, telling her that the man had called for them, and seemed much dis\nappointed that he had not received them before. Miss S., with considerable\nsurprise, exclaimed : ' ' Why, an old man called about theso photographs\nyesterday (Friday), and I told him they could not be ready this week owing\nto the bad weather, and that we were nearly three weeks behind with our\nwork.\" I suggested that it was quite time Mr. Thompson's were ready,\nand inquired who was printing the order. I was told that it was not in\nprint, and pointing to a pile of negatives Miss S. said : \"Thompson's is\namongst that lot, and they have been waiting quite a fortnight.\" I asked to\nbe shown the negative, and about half an hour later Miss S. called me, say\ning, \"This is Thompson's negative.\" I took it in my hands and looked at it\ncarefully, remarking, \"Yes, that is it ; that is the chap who called this morn\ning.\" Miss S. again referred to the fact that she had told the man who had\ncalled on the previous day that none were done, or could be done that week.\n\"Well,\" I said, \"put this to one side and I will see to it myself on Monday,\nand endeavour to hurry it forward.\" On the Monday (January 5th), I was\nin one of the printing rooms, and, about 10.30 a.m., having one or two print\ning frames empty, I thought of Thompson's negative, and accordingly went\ndown to the office and asked Miss S. for it. \"Oh yes,\" she replied,\n\"and here are a few more equally urgent, you may take them as\nwell.\" I said \"That cannot be, as I have only two or three frames at\nliberty\" (she had about twenty negatives in her hand, holding them\nout to me), \"give me Thompson's first and let me get my mind at rest\nabout it.\" To which she answered : \" His is amongst this lot, I will have\nto pick it out.\" (Each negative was in a paper bag.) I offered to help her,\nand she commenced at one end of the batch and I at the other, and before\nwe got halfway through I came across one which I knew was very urgent,\nand turned away to look up the date of taking it when crash ! went\npart of the negatives on the floor. This accident seemed so serious\nthat I was almost afraid to pick up the fallen negatives, but on doing so, one\nby one, I was greatly relieved to find only one was broken, but judge of my\nhorror to find that that one was Thompson's ! I muttered something (not\nloud, but deep), and would fain have relieved my feelings, but the presence\nof ladies restrained me (this accident being witnessed also by my head-\nprinter, Miss L.). I could not honestly blame Miss S. for this\u2014each thought\nthe other was holding the lot, and between us we let them drop. The\nnegative was broken in two, right across the forehead of figure. I put the\npieces carefully away, and, taking out a memo, form, wrote to Mr. Thompson,\nasking him to kindly give another sitting, and offering to recoup him for his\ntrouble and loss of time ; this letter was posted five minutes after the\n\fNov., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 149\nnegative was broken, and the affair was forgotten by me for the time. How\never, on Friday, the 9th of January, I was in the printing-room upstairs when\nI was signalled by the whistle which communicates with the office, and Miss\nS. asked if I could go down, as the gentleman had called about the negative.\nI asked, \"What negative?\" \"Well,\" she replied, \"the one we broke,\nMr. Thompson's.\" I answered, \"I am very busy, and cannot come down, but\nyou know the terms I offered him ; send him up to be taken at once. \" \" But\nhe is dead ! \" said Miss S. \"Dead ! \" I exclaimed, and without another word\nI hastened down the stairs to my office. Here I saw an elderly gentleman,\nwho seemed in great trouble. \"Surely,\" said I to him, \"you dcn't mean to\nsay that this man is dead ? \" \" It is only too true,\" he replied. \" Well, it\nmust have been dreadfully sudden,\" I said, sympathetically, \"because I saw\nhim only last Saturday. \" The old gentleman shook his head sadly, and said,\n\" You are mistaken, for he died last Saturday.\"\n\"Nay,\" I returned, \"lam not mistaken, for I recognised the negative\nby him.\" However, the father (for such was his relationship to my\nsitter) persisted in saying I was mistaken, and that it was he who called on\nthe Friday and not his son, and, he said, \"I saw that young lady (pointing\nto Miss S.), and she told me the photographs would not be ready that\nweek.\" \"That is quite right,\" said Miss S., \"but Mr. D. also saw a\ngentleman on Saturday morning, and when I showed Mr. D. the\nnegative he said, 'Yes, that's the man who called.' I told Mr. D. then\nof your having called on the Friday.\" Still Mr. Thompson sen. seemed\nto think that we were wrong, and the many questions and cross-questions I\nput to him only served to confirm him in his opinion that I had got mixed ;\nbut this he said : No one was authorised to call, nor had they any friend or\nrelative who would know of portraits being ordered, neither was there\nanyone likely to impersonate the man who had sat for his portrait. I had\nno further interview with the old gentleman until a week later, when he was\nmuch calmer in his appearance and conversation, and at this interview ho\ntold me that his son died on Saturday, January 3rd, at about 2.30 p.m. ; he\nalso stated that at the time I saw him (the sitter) he was unconscious, and\nremained so up to the time of his death. I have not had any explanation of\nthis mysterious visit up to present date, February 26th, 1891.\nIt is curious to me that I have no recollection of hearing the man come\nupstairs, or of him going down. In appearance he was pale and careworn,\nand looked as though he had been very ill. This thought occurred to me\nwhen he said he had been travelling all night.\n(Signed) James Dickinson.\n43, Grainger-street, Newcastle-on-Tyne.\nMiss S. signs the following statement :\u2014\nI am the Miss S. referred to in the foregoing narrative.

[Nov., 1S91.\nThe next statement was written by Mr. Nisbet from Mr. Thomp\nson sen.'s information, and with a little alteration and addition signed\nby him.\nMarch 22ud, 1891.\nAt the beginning of December, 1890, my son, John Thompson, got\nphotographed by Mr. Dickinson, of Grainger-strect, Nowcastle-on-Tyne.\nHe was wishful to present a photograph of himself to each of his chief com\nrades on New Year's Day. During the Christmas week he took typhoid\nfever and was very ill.\nOn Friday, January 2nd, 1891, I went to Newcastle to purchase certain\narticles for him, and being in Newcastle I thought I would kill two birds\nwith one stone, so I called at Dickinson's to see if his photos, were ready.\nI called chiefly because he seemed anxious about them\u2014he spoke of them\nwhen he was delirious. I saw a young woman at Dickinson's who told me\nthat the photos, were not ready.\nOn Saturday, January 3rd, my son died at 2.5 p.m.\nOn Monday, January 5th, 1891, I received a letter addressed to my son\nasking him to call and sit again for his photograph as the negative had been\nbroken. I still possess this letter and envelope ' (dated January 5th, 1891).\nOn Friday, January 9th, I called at Mr. Dickinson's, when he explained\nthat he had seen my son in his place on the previous Saturday. I told him\nhe must be mistaken, as my son was then ill in bed, but I told him that I\nhad called on the Friday about the photographs. Mr. Dickinson persisted\nin saying he had seen my son on the Saturday, so I showed him tho\n\" burial lines \" to convince him.\nI know of no one who could have called about the photos, on tho\nSaturday, nor do I know of any of my son's friends who could be mistaken\nfor him. My son was 21 years of age, and was studying for the Primitive\nMethodist ministry. There was always strong sympathy between me and\nmy son. I had the power of influencing him at a distance. My son was\ncalm and steady, not easily excited ; tho joy of the housohold, and a\ngeneral favourite with the public. \u2014Yours truly,\nThompson.\nMr. Dickinson informed Mr. Nisbet that he was perfectly well at\nthe time of this occurrence. He has never had any other experience\nat all resembling this, but he is subject to nightmare and walking in\nhis sleep. [On one occasion a dream figure persisting into a waking\nor semi-waking state was, he says, also seen by his wife.] He also\ntold Mr. Nisbet of an experience in automatic writing, which is of\ninterest in connection with the apparition. The following is Mr,\nNisbet's account of it.\nMr. Dickinson was standing in his office endorsing certain parcels of\ncoupons on January 2nd, 1891, [the day before the apparition] to put away\nin a store-place, as is his custom at the beginning of each year. Just as\n1 Mr, Nisbet has seen it.\n\fNov,, 1891,] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 151\nhe was going to write on one parcel with pencil, someone came in and made\na complaint to Miss S. about delay in sending photographs, &c. Mr. Dickin\nson put down the parcel and listened to the complaint without joining in the\nconversation, His hand, with pencil in it, rested on the parcel. When the\ncomplainant had gone he asked Miss S. how it was she had given cause for the\ncomplaint, &c. Then he turned round to his parcel and gave an exclamation\nof surprise (which Miss S. confirms), on finding the word \"Onwards\"\nwritten in a bold hand in pencil\u2014his writing\u2014but larger than usual. He\nhas kept the paper. I have seen it.\nMr. Nisbet learned that Mr. Dickinson was not quite sure whether\nhe was present when Mr. Thompson was photographed ; his assistant\nsays he was, but Mr. Dickinson cannot remember. They photographed\nabout 40 people on the day Mr. Thompson sat.\nMr. Nisbet further informs us that Mr. Dickinson is quite sure that\nMiss S. had said nothing to him on the Friday about Mr. Thompson\nsenior calling, and that Miss S. confirms this.\nAll the above information was conveyed to us in a letter from Mr.\nNisbet, dated March 31st, 1891.\nProfessor Sidgwick was introduced to Mr. Dickinson in September,\n1891, and heard his story vividly and fully told by himself. Extracts\nonly from his notes need be given here.\nD. did not hear T. come in, but being busy writing was not surprised at\nthis though he was surprised that he had come so early. He asked, &c.\n*****\nT. said that \" He could not call later, he had been travelling all night.\"\nHe had an overcoat on, and a careworn look\u2014looked ill. The thought passed\nthrough D.'s mind, \"Yes, poor man, you have been travelling all night and\nyou are going home to die.\" Meanwhile T. turned and went out : he had\nnot sat down, but stood all the time. D. ran round the counter towards the\ndoor and called after him, \" Can I post them ? \" but got no answer, and did not\nhear the visitor go down or out ; this he would ordinarily have done, but the\nnot hearing did not surprise him. Ho thought the visitor was \"huffed,\" and\nturned to copy out the number of the order and the name on a piece of paper\non which he wrote the word \"post.\" (This paper Mr. Nisbet saw, and\nremembers reading the number and name, but the paper seems to be lost.)\nAll this, according to his recollection, with perfect wakefulness and without\nthe least idea or feeling of anything abnormal.\nTwo explanations seem to need discussion before accepting as a\nfact that Mr. Dickinson's visitor was not a man of flesh and blood.\nThe first is that it may have been Mr. Thompson junior himself\nin a state of delirium. It seems, however, impossible that during the\nlast few hours of a fatal illness, while believed by his family to be\nunconscious, he should have got up, dressed himself, travelled 5| miles\nand back and returned to bed, and all this without the knowledge\nof those who were nursing him. In the first shock of hearing from\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1891.\nhis father that he had died on the Saturday, Mr. Dickinson, as he\ntold Professor Sidgwick, \"could not still persuade himself that he had\nnot had a visit from Thompson in the flesh, but the father said that\n' he could not possibly have got out, they were always with him.' \"\nAnd Mr. Nisbet has since learned more specifically that at 8 o'clock\non the morning of his death there were not only his father, mother,\nand sister with him, but also friends.\nThe other explanation is that a friend of Mr. Thompson's called to\nask about the photographs, and that Mr. Dickinson's recognition of the\nnegative was a mistake. When Mr. Nisbet called on Mrs. Thompson,\nthe mother of the young man, she said there was a companion of her son\nwho knew about the photographs and who might have called at Mr.\nDickinson's. She said he was very like her son. Her husband, how\never, scouted the idea altogether, said that the man in question, a\ncertain G.S., was a big man, not at all like his son, who was a small\nman, and he appeared to convince his wife. Mr. Nisbet, however,\nthought it would be desirable to ascertain whether G. S. had called, but\nfor some time could not learn his address. Mr. Thompson wrote to Mr.\nNisbet, April 14th: \"According to the information I can gather there\nwas no one called at the office of Mr. Dickinson on behalf of my son.\"\nIn September, Mr. Nisbet learnt the address of G. S.'s parents, and\ncalling found that, though out at the time, he lived with them. His\nmother told him that one day when G. S. came from chapel he had told\nher that Miss Thompson had asked him whether he had called for John\nThompson's photographs, and that he was rather annoyed at its being\nsupposed possible that he would take such a thing upon him, not being\nauthorised. His mother was quite positive that he had not called at\nthe photographer's, and that he did not know where John Thompson\nhad been photographed, and she agreed with Mr. Thompson senior as\nto the unlikeness of the two young men. 'We have heard of no other\npossible caller.\nThe above account has been revised in proof by Mr. Nisbet. Mr.\nDickinson has also seen it and consents to its being printed in the\nJournal. .\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\" NEGATIvE HALLUCINATIONS.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society fob, Psychical Research.\nSir,\u2014\" T. B.,\" in a letter in the October Journal records an experience,\nhis inability to perceive a foot-rule before his eyes. I have had many\nsimilar experiences, so many in fact that I have formed a rule of conduct by\nwhich to act upon any occasion of the disappearance of an object from a\nplace where reason affirms its presence. I look at the place and expect the\nobject to appear, and presently it emerges from nothingness into sight.\n\fNov,, 1891,] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 153\nMy explanation of my own experiences is that I have a habit of mis\nlaying things, so that my sudden want of any particular thing, say a pen, is\naccompanied by a hopeless feeling or dominant idea that it is mislaid again.\nHypnotised by this idea, I cannot see the pen, and not seeing it I fall still\nmore under the influence of the idea. Recovery, now, is by a reasoned\nbelief that the pen is in its place, and tranquil expectation of its appearance\nas above stated. Of old, it was only when I began to think of something\nelse that my eye, having no prepossession, would light on the pen as on any\nother object, and perceive it.\nJudging \"T.B.\" by myself I should suppose that while he was carpen\ntering he laid his foot-rule, now here, now there ; and that often, as a\nconsequence, he failed to lay his hand upon it immediately. After a few\nsuch failures, when he wanted his foot-rule, the want would be accompanied\nwith an expectation of not finding it immediately. This expectation would\nbe sufficient to prevent him from seeing it, even before his eyes, and then,\nnot seeing it, he would become still more hypnotised against its presence.\nWhen, after a search elsewhere, he at last perceived the foot-rule in its\nplace, this recovery would be due either to a returned conviction that it\nmust be there, or to his beginning to think of something else, as, for\nexample, what he was to do, a diversion of the thoughts which would free\nhis mind from its prepossession and leave him his ordinary vision. In all\nprobability \"T.B.\" will be unable to say with certainty whether this is a\ntrue explanation of his adventure, because he is not likely to remember\nfugitive states of mind which he saw no reason to note in their passage. He\nmay, however, test the explanation in the course of some future experience\nof a similar kind to that which he has narrated.\nThe following seems another example of the influence of the dominant\nidea in the fully conscious state. I had read a proof four times, and each\ntime had seen the word \" Obidicut \" (the name of a fiend mentioned in\nKing Lear) clearly. At last my eye happened to rest upon the word, while\nmy thoughts wandered from the page, when suddenly my attention was\nbrought back by my seeing this word \"Obidicut \" change into \"obedient\"\nunder my eyes, by a transformation comparable to a rapid change of scene\non the stage. Knowing that I had written \" Obidicut,\" and expecting to\nfind that word in the proof, I actually saw it, and but for an accident should\nnot have seen that it was misprinted \"obedient.\" C. Downing.\nSPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nDear Sir, \u2014Will you kindly allow me to make a few remarks on Mrs.\nSidgwick's interesting paper on \" Spirit Photography, \" published in Part\nXIX. of our Proceedings ?\nIt seems to me that Mrs. Sidgwick's criticisms amount to something like\nthis : when there is a professional spirit-photographer in the matter, no\nevidence can be held conclusive ; when the photographs obtained are the\nresult of private experiment, the witnesses themselves are untrustworthy, or\nat least one of them, this untrustworthy one playing the most important\npart in the experiments. Well, I think such \"canons of evidence\" as these\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., ism.\ncan hardly be satisfied, and we may find ourselves, if we accept them, in a\nvicious circle, out of which there is no issue. I wonder, for my part, what\nwould have become of a good deal of the evidence for telepathy\u2014spontaneous\nand experimental\u2014if we were to subject it to the same treatment?\nOccasionally Mrs. Sidgwick, when dealing with the evidence for tran\nscendental photography, uses a third explanation, viz.: accident, as, e.g., in\nthe case of Dr. Williams, of Hayward's Heath, commenting on whoso\nphotographs she says :\u2014\n\"I suspect that the throe earlier ones were not beyond tho range of some\nAccidental flaw resembling part of a human figure.\"\nNow, in the first place, it seems to me that believers in telepathy\u2014and\nMrs. Sidgwick is one\u2014ought to be very careful in postulating accident or\ncoincidence as an explanation of abnormal facts or phenomena ; and,\nsecondly, I feel inclined to think that an experienced photographer will\nalways be able to distinguish between a flaw in the substance of the plate and\nsome image\u2014of whatever origin\u2014on the surface of it.\nI pass on to another case. Speaking of Mr. Thos. Slater's experiments,\nMrs. Sidgwick says : \u2014\n\"He has not, so far as I know, published sufficient details to enable one\nto judge of the conditions under which they [the results] were obtained.\"\nSome details are, however, given in Mr. Alfred R. Wallace's Defence of\nModern Spiritualism, and I think the following extract may be read with\ninterest :\u2014.\n\"The first of his [Mr. Slater's] successes contains two heads by the side\nof a portrait of his sister. One of these heads is unmistakeably the late Lord\nBrougham's ; the other, much less distinct, is recognised by Mr. Slater as that\nof Robert Owen, whom he knew intimately up to the time of his death. Ho\nhas since obtained several excellent pictures of the same class. ... In\none case a second figure appeared on a plate with himself, taken by Mr. Slater\nwhen he was absolutely alone\u2014by the simple process of occupying the\nsitter's chair after uncapping the camera\" (p. 192, ed. 1875).\nMr. Wallace speaks also of the following photographs as obtained by\nMr. Slater:\u2014\n(1) \"A female in black and white flowing robes.\"\n(2) \"A pretty child's figure, draped, standing beside Mr. Slater's littlo\nboy.\"\n(3) \"A head and a bust appearing over Mr. Slater himself.\"\n(4) \"A full-length portrait of his [Mr. Slater's] sister \" ; in this case the\nsitter appears covered all over with a kind of transparent white drapery.\nWith regard to Robert Dale Owen's portrait, we learn from M. Aksakoffs\nAnimismus unci Spiritismus that as early as in 1850 Mr. Owen had promised\nMr. Slater to appear, if possible, on a photographic plate ; the promise was\ngiven in consequence of a communication through raps having been received,\nin which Mr. Slater was told that he would obtain spirit-photographs in\ncourse of time. (M. Aksakoff refers to the Spiritualist of 1873, p. 509, and\nalso to the Spirit Magazine of 1873, p. 563.) In presence of these facts it\n\fNov., 1891.] Journal oj Society for Psychical Research. 155\nseems to me that the easiest way to disposo of the evidence in Mr. Slater's\ncase would be to impugn the bonafides of Mr. Slater himself ; but have we\nany right to do this 1\nAs for Mr. Beattie's experiments, many people will, I think, agree with\nme that Mrs. Sidgwick's assumption that Mr. Josty was an untrustworthy\nexperimenter, capable of deceiving others\u2014with what aim ?\u2014is absolutely\nwithout foundation, since the fact that fourteen years after the experiments\nin question ho was found to have many debts unpaid, and not to be a\nteototaller, does not prove much. Besides that, we know that, when under\ntaking his private experiments, Mr. Beattie had already been deceived in the\nmatter of spirit-photography ; a sufficient reason, it seems to nie, that he\nwhom the British Journal of Photography calls \" a thoughtful, skilful, and\nintelligent photographer, one of the last men in the world to be deceived,\"\nshould take care not to confide in a person of whose bona fides he was not\ncertain.\nApart from this, we know that in each and every case the descriptions\ngiven by the mediums of what they saw corresponded exactly with the\nimages which appeared on the plate. Now, supposing Mr. Josty was a\ntrickster, how could he have known what plate was going to be placed in the\ncamera, the whole of the photographic work being done by Messrs. Thompson\nand Beattie ? Apart from this, how are we to explain the fact that it was\nnot only Mr. Josty but also Mr. Butland who gave accurate descriptions of\nthe invisible appearances supposed to be present 1 The following two in\ncidents appear to me to be especially noteworthy :\u2014\nMr. Josty describes a white fog ; Mr. Butland adds that he sees a figure\n\u2014both appear on the plate. Mr. Josty says he sees a black figure ; Mr.\nButland a light one (or vice versa)\u2014both figures are photographed.\nThere are also some other features in the experiments which seem to\ntell in favour of the genuineness of the photographs obtained ; these features\nare :\u2014\n(1) The very great number of total failures, i.e., cases where nothing at\nall appeared on the plate.\n(2) The gradual process of development noticeable in the images which\nappeared on the plates. Thus, says Mr. Wallace, \" One set of five [photo\ngraphs] begins with two white, somewhat angular patches over the middle\nsitter, and ends with a rude but unmistakeable white female figure covering the\nlarger part of the plate. The other three show intermediate states, indicating\na continuous change of form from the first figure to the last. Another set (of\nfour pictures) begins with a white vertical cylinder over the body of the\nmedium, and a shorter one on his head ; these change their form in the\nsecond and third, and in the last become laterally spread out into luminous\nmasses, resembling nebidce,\" &c.\n(3) A curious fact noticed by Mr. Beattie throughout his experiments,\nviz., that the \"spiritual figures\" which appeared on the plates started out\nthe moment the developing fluid touched them, while the figure of the\nsitter appeared much later.\nApropos of the gradual development of the figures I may notice here the\nexperiments of Signor Damiani (in Animismus nnd Spiritismus, reference is\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1891.\nmade to the Spiritualist of December 3rd, 1875), in which we find the same\ncharacteristic features we have seen in Mr. Beattie's photographs. It is said\nthat at the request of a young German photographer, Signor Damiani\nundertook to make experiments on the terrace of his own house, six\n(obviously private) mediums being selected for the purpose. Out of five\nphotographs taken, on the first a column of light appeared ; on the second a\nball of light over the head of one of the female mediums ; on the third\nplate there was the same ball with a spot in the middle ; on the fourth the\nspot in question had increased in size ; and on the fifth it partly resembled\na human head. Now, however loosely these experiments are described, it\nseems to me that they can hardly bo said to be of no importance evidentially,\nthe more so as they resemble so much the results obtained by Mr. Beattie,\nin which, as I have said, the gradual alteration or development of the\ninvisible images photographed is one of the most conspicuous features.\nAt the Paris Congress of Spiritualists (1889), Captain Volpi, of Rome, has,\nI believe, brought forward some interesting cases of \" transcendental photo\ngraphy \" within his own experience, and has even issued a challenge to all\nprofessional photographers to produce the same results under the same\nconditions. I am sorry I cannot give any details nor exact references since\nI have not got the Report of the Congress, which is to bo found, I think, in\ntho Library of the Society (Journal of the S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 332).\nAs for Professor Wagner's experiment, it seems to me that a very curious\nfeature of it has remained unknown to Mrs. Sidgvvick. In an article printed\nin a St. Petersburg newspaper, tho Novoic Vremia of February 5th (17th),\n1880, under title of \" Theory and Actuality \"\u2014and since reproduced in the\nRussian translation of M. Aksakoffs recent work\u2014Professor Wagner, after\ndescribing the apparatus he used, says :\u2014.\n\"I describe all these preparations in order to show all those who, like\nHartmann, wish to teach one the way in which mediumistic photographs are\nto be taken, that I took precautions which every physicist and photographer\nwill deem sufficient, and of which the celebrated German philosopher has\nprobably no idea.\n\" We had been told through psychography [I presume the word means\nhere planchette rather than direct writing ; it is, I believe, sometimes used\nwith this meaning] the day on whiclt. the experiment was to be made and the\nnumber of plates that were to be exposed; also that the mediumistic appearance\nwould manifest itself on the third plate.\"\nA little further on Professor Wagner says : \u2014\n\"We asked to be told through raps when wo must uncap the camera and\nwhen we must finish the exposure. We had not to wait long : three loud\nraps were heard on the floor, and after the exposure had lasted two minutes\nthe same raps told us to shut the camera.\"\nIn accordance with what he had been told, Professor Wagner found the\n\"appearance\" on the third plate. By the way, if, as Mrs. Sidgwick\nsuggests, this result was due to some reflection off tho wall and furniture,\nwhy did nothing appear either on the first or on the second plate ?\nIt is true that this experiment of Professor Wagner's was the only\nsuccessful one, and that, as he says, \"18 photographs were taken under the\n\fNov., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. lot\nsame conditions \" but with no result ; but still, as Mrs. Sidgwick does not\nimpugn in this case the good faith of any of the witnesses, the coincidence\nof the directions given with the result obtained remains to bo explained.\nWith regard to professional spirit-photographers, I cannot say much\nabout them, firstly, because I have but little desire to undertake the defence\nof those who have cheated\u2014if only once\u2014or may with some reason be\nsuspected of fraud ; secondly, because, from what Mrs. Sidgwick says, it\nseems that, according to her opinion, no evidence as to experiments made in\nthe presence of professional photographers can be held conclusive. Still, I\nmay point out that in the case of Mumler the evidence of fraud as presented\nin Mrs. Sidgwick's paper is somewhat weak and inconclusive,1 and that the\nevidence for Jay Hartman's photographs is not examined at all, though\nthe successful test-seance he gave in the presence of some Cincinnati photo\ngraphers in 1870, appears to have been one of the most remarkable that ever\nwere given. At the conclusion of the seance a certificate was given to Hart-\nman and, as I think that readers of the Journal are likely to be interested in\nit, I reproduce it here (from M. Aksakofl's Auimismus und Spiritismus) :\u2014\n\"We, the undersigned, having taken part in a public investigation of\nspirit-photography undertaken at the request of Mr. J. Hartman, hereby\ncertify that we carefully followed all manipulations with our own marked\nplates in the dark room as well as out of it, and that we found no proof of\nfraud or trickery on Mr. Hartman's part. We certify also that, during the\nlast experiment which gave a result, Mr. J. Hartman did neither touch the\nplate nor enter the dark room.\u2014J. Slatter, C. H. Murhman, Y. Cutter, J.\nP.

Cincinnati, Ohio, December 25th, 1875.\"\nNot to make my letter too long, I can only refer in passing to another\nseries of experiments of which an account is to be found in Auimismus\nuiid Spiritismus, but of which no mention is made in Mrs. Sidgwick's paper\u2014\nthe experiments of Professor Gunning (an American geologist), conducted in\n1807 with a Connecticut photographer, a professional one, it is true, but who\ntook no money for his seances, \"of whose good faith \" the Professor tells us he\n\"had not the remotest doubt,\" and \"whose reputation was stainless\";\nbesides that, \" we took all possible precautions \" to make fraud impossible,\nand yet striking results were obtained. (The account was originally pub\nlished in the New York Tribune, and reprinted in the Spiritual Magazine of\n1809, p. 200.)\nIt seems also that one of the chief reasons why Mrs. Sidgwick is inclined\nto reject the evidence in favour of \" transcendental photography \" is that its\nacceptance involves \"immense theoretical difficulties.\" Now, I may be\n1 Besides that, if, according to Mrs. Sidgwick (re Dr. Williams's photographs), the\nresemblance of the images which appeared on the plates to human figures may have\nbeen accidental, many people will be justified in drawing the conclusion that the\nresemblance of one of Mumler's spirit-photographs to some living person may have\nbeen accidental too !\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., isoi.\nallowed to ask whether (1) we have any right to reject a fact simply\nbecause it is difficult to imagine a theory that might fit it ; (2) whether all\nor many facts, when first discovered, were not difficult to explain ; and (3)\nwhether there are not some facts which are very difficult to explain theoreti\ncally, though Mrs. Sidgwick accepts them, e.g., telepathy? Apart from this,\nthe \"theoretical difficulties involved \"in the acceptance of transcendental\nphotography are perhaps not so \"immense\" as Mrs. Sidgwick considers\nthem. For it seems to bo a generally accepted fact that rays of light which\nthe human eye cannot see can be photographed, and that images invisible to\nthe human eye can affect the sensitized plate. (Cf. \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" in\nLight of September 26th, p. 462, footnote.) Believers in spirit-photography\nmight even suggest, I think, that it is unnecessary to suppose a real\n\"spiritual \" presence before the camera, and that the images which appear on\nthe plate may be duo to some process bearing a faint analogy to the way in\nwhich everyone of us can cause \"images \" to appear on a window-pane by\nbreathing upon it. To sum up : I do not at all pretend that the evidence in\nfavour of \"spirit-photography\" is absolutely conclusive ; but what I say is\nthat I cannot agree with Mrs. Sidgwick that it does not even present \"a prima\nfacie case for investigation \" ; nor do I think that Mrs. Sidgwick's criticisms\nmust be considered as having done away with the evidence _ existing at\npresent. \u2014I am, dear Sir, yours very truly,\n9, Mohovai'a, Saint Petersbourg. Michael Solovoy,\nSeptember 24th (October 6th).\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir, \u2014Mr. Solovoy's letter seems to call for somo reply from me, though\nI fear to weary your readers with the subject.\nI will not dwell long on mere expressions of disagreement with me. Of\nthis nature, for instance, is Mr. Solovoy's view of the bearing of our infor\nmation as to Mr. Josty's character, and his view that Mr. Beattie could not\nhave been deceived by Mr. Josty. l These points have been discussed in\nmy paper. Of the same nature, again, is Mr. Solovoy's view that Dr. Williams\ncould have distinguished between a flaw in his photograph having a rough\nresemblance to part of a human form, and a similar image due to spirit\nintervention ; but here I am not sure that Mr. Solovoy means the same thing\nby a flaw that I do. He seems to think it must be in the glass, which would\ncertainly not be my view. I should regard any accidental spot on the\nphotograph as a flaw.\nMr. Solovoy, again, disagrees with me as to the adequacy of the accounts\nof Mr. Slater's experiment, and to prove his point quotes one of them. I\ncould not desire a better justification of what I said. The account is mainly\na statement of results obtained by Mr. Slater, with practically no details as to\n1 Mr. Solovoy's statement that in Mr. Beattie's experiments \" in each and every\ncase the description given by the mediums of what they saw corresponded exactly with\nthe images which appeared on the plate,\" seems to me to be exaggerated ; as also his\nstatement that the whole of the photographic work was done by Messrs. Thompson\nand Beattie. I have given Mr. Beattie's statements on these subjects, such as they are,\nin my paper.\n\fNov., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 159\nthe processes and precautions used in obtaining these results. In no depart\nment of physical science would a competent experimenter expect to\nestablish a fact on evidence so presented. He would give a minute and\ncareful account from notes made at the time of the processes adopted in\nobtaining his result, of the possible sources of error that had occurred to him,\nand of the precautions taken to exclude them. By this means others would\nbe able to criticise his work and would have an opportunity of discovering\nsources of error, if any, which had been overlooked. And the greater the\ntheoretical difficulty of accepting a fact, the greater need is there of such\ncare in recording the experiments by which it is supposed to be demonstrated.\nMr. Solovoy begins his letter by a statement of my views which I cannot\naccept. It is true that I think it unlikely that satisfactory evidence in so\ndifficult a matter could bo obtained when the bona fides of all concerned is\nnot above suspicion, or even when a person whose co-operation is essential\nhas a direct pecuniary interest in the result ; but unless spirit-photographs\nhad been proved impossible, it would be absurd to infer from the mere fact\nof success that there had been an untrustworthy person playing an important\npart. Is it possible that Mr. Solovoy is led to accuse me of so illogical a\nproceeding by the fact that in the case of Mr. Beattio's experiment a per\nson of doubtful character\u2014Mr. Josty\u2014actually did play an important part ;\nhis studio, his instruments, his glass, and his services being used and\napparently paid for, giving him a pecuniary motive to produce results 1\nA misunderstanding of my views is unimportant, but I confess I am\nsomewhat shocked when I find Mr. Solovoy saying, \" It seems to me that\nbelievers in telepathy .... ought to be very careful in postulating\naccident or coincidence as an explanation of abnormal facts.\" Doest he\nmean that we do not give due weight to the operation of chance in esti\nmating the evidence for telepathy, and that if we did the evidence would\nfall to the ground 1 And if he does not mean this, what does he mean 1\nChance will account for a certain number of abnormal phenomena, and\nwhat can seekers after truth have to fear from giving full weight to any\nexplanation ?\nTurning to the evidence brought forward by Mr. Solovoy and not\nmentioned in my paper, I will deal first with the fulfilled prediction, that\nthe third plate exposed by Professor Wagner would be the, or a, successful one.\nI think this is of little importance evidentially because we have no reason to\nthink that the intelligence (not improbably Madame Pribitkow's subconscious\nintelligence) which regulated (very badly) the exposure of the plates by raps\non the floor was unaware of the prophecy which it helped to fulfil. The\nlight was very bad. The exposure prescribed by the raps was for the first\nplate two minutes, and for the second apparently the same, though this is not\nexplicitly stated. These plates were at once developed, and nothing of\ninterest found on them. Then the third plate was exposed, and this time\nthe time prescribed was nearly three minutes. How can we say that if the\nother plates had been exposed as long, the same or similar marks would not\nhave appeared on them ?\nWith regard to the other evidence adduced by Mr. Solovoy, I know too\nlittle about Signor Damiani and his experiments to have any opinion about\nthem.\n\f160 journal of Society for Psychical Research, pfov., lsM-\nTho photographs obtained with a photographer at Naples and one at\nRome by Captain Volpi, were unknown to mo when my paper was published.\nSince then I have seen copies sent by him to Mr. Myers, together with letters\nfrom him and an account in an Italian Spiritualistic paper, II Vess'dlo\nSpiritista for March, 1891. Space forbids my entering into details. Those\nMembers and Associates of the Society who wish to see the photographs, &c. ,\ncan do so at the Society's rooms. I will only say here that I do not think\nany importance ought to be attached to the photographs in question as\nevidence of spirit-photography ; I see no reason for thinking that Signor\nVolpi was not deceived and some reason for thinking that he was. The\nphotographs were taken in 1870-1880.\nMr. Jay J. Hartman's case is not, so far as I know, better than that of\nother spirit-photographers, and I did not think it necessary to refer to it\nspecifically. He had been accused of trickery and gave a public test-seance\non December 25th, 1875. The account of it was published in an anonymous\narticle in a Cincinnati newspaper (which for aught we know may have been\nwritten by himself), and from this seems to have been copied into Spiritual\nistic papers. There were 16 persons present ; we have no means of knowing\nthat none of them wore accomplices; nor does their certificate, quoted by Mr.\nSolovoy, prove that they were not taken in by a clever trick. Moreover, they\ncertify more than the whole party can have been in a position to affirm, since\nonly two seem to have goneinto the dark room.\nThe case reported by Professor Gunning is perhaps stronger, but here\nthe photographer concerned\u2014and on whom tho evidence must depend\u2014\nmakes no statement, is not named, and though Professor Gunning believed\nhim to be honest, he had apparently only a slight acquaintance with him.\nIn conclusion, if I thought, as Mr. Solovoy and others do, that the\nevidence showed a primd facie case for believing in spirit-photography, I\nshould at once learn the art of photography and endeavour to investigate\nthe matter thoroughly. And photography is so easily learnt now-a-days up\nto a point sufficient for this purpose, and it would so obviously be worth\nspending a great deal of time on these experiments if there were a reasonable\nhope of obtaining results, that probably some of those who do believe that\nthere is a primd facie case will take up the matter experimentally. If so, I\ntrust that their experiments will bo recorded as honestly, carefully, and\nminutely as scientific experiments should be, and that they will take care\nto have no one present who is not trustworthy and willing to take his or her\nshare in the responsibility for the results. One special precaution I should\nlike to call attention to, namely, that experiments conducted by one person\nabsolutely alone should not be regarded as evidentially important. In many\ndepartments of Psychical Research we have to do with abnormal states, and\nwith actions\u2014like automatic writing\u2014not regulated by the normal conscious\nness, and it is quite conceivable that apparent success in spirit-photography\nmight be brought about by actions of the experimenter of which his normal\nconsciousness had neither knowledge at the time nor recollection afterwards.\nAny suspicion of this should be avoided by the presence of another\nperson.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n\fNov., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 161\nCATALOGUE OF UNPRINTED CASES.\n(Continued from the July Journal.)\nFurther information improving the evidence in any of these cases\nwill be gratefully received.\nB L 117.

[Dkc., 1891.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nA Meeting of the Council was held on December 4th. Mr. H.\nArthur Smith was voted to the chair at the commencement. It was\ntaken subsequently by the President. The following Members were\nalso present : Professors 0. J. Lodge and W. F. Barrett, Rev. A. T.\nFryer, Dr. A. T. Myers, and Messrs. T. Bark worth, W. Leaf, F. W.\nH. Myers, F. Podmore, S. C. Scott, and R. Pearsall Smith.\nTwo new Members and fifteen new Associates, whose names and\naddresses appear on the preceding page, were elected. The election of\nsix new Associates of the American Branch was recorded.\nThe Council recorded with regret the death of the Bishop of Carlisle,\na Vice-President of the Society, and also of the Earl of Lytton, who\nbecame a Member early in the present year.\nAt the request of Mr. H. M. W. Bridgeman, his election as a\nMember at the last Meeting of the Council was cancelled, he having\naccepted an appointment abroad.\nThe resignation of three Members and six Associates, who for\nvarious reasons desired their connection with the Society to terminate\nat the end of the current year, was accepted.\nAt their request, the names of Mrs. Dowson, Mr. Gordon Hooper,\nand Mr. I. B. Nicholl, were ordered to be transferred from the list of\nMembers to that of Associates at the end of the year.\nThe names of five Members and four Associates, who from different\ncauses had become merely nominal members of the Society, were\nordered to be struck off the list.\nThe names of the Members of Council who retire by rotation at\nthe end of the year were read over. The Assistant Secretary was\ndirected to ascertain their wishes as to standing for re-election, and to\nsend out the usual notices in regard to the Annual Business Meeting,\naccording to the Rules.\nArrangements were agreed to for advertising the forthcoming Part\nXX of the Proceedings to a greater extent than usual.\nAs the term for which the rooms not occupied by the Society are\nlet expires at Christmas, it was resolved that they should, for the next\nthree months at all events, be retained in hand, so as to be available\nfor the gatherings mentioned on page 179.\nThe following dates were fixed for General Meetings, subsequent to\nthat already arranged for January 29th :\u2014March 4th, 8.30 p.m., April\n8th, 4 p.m., and May 27th, 8.30 p.m.\nVarious other matters of business were attended to.\nIt was agreed that the next Meeting of the Council should be at\nWestminster Town Hall, at the close of the Annual Business Meeting\non January 29th, unless it was found advisable to summon one earlier,\n\fDec, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 167\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 49th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, December 4th, 1891, at 8.30 o'clock ;\nthe President in the chair.\nProfessor Oliver Lodge read a paper on some experiments in\nthought-transference conducted by him in Carinthia last autumn, with\ntwo young ladies\u2014sisters\u2014of his acquaintance, one of them acting as\nagent and the other as percipient. They had been accustomed to\nplaying the \" Willing Game \" together with contact, but had never\nbefore tried careful experiments in thought-transference. Professor\nLodge found that contact of some kind, though it might be only\nthrough the backs of the knuckles, was essential to success in the\nexperiments he tried with them, but this may have been due only to\ntheir being accustomed to contact. With contact the success in trans\nferring cards, numbers, words, diagrams (some of them nameless), and\nobjects was far beyond what chance would produce. He did not\nexpect the experiments to carry conviction to those who did not on\nother grounds believe in thought-transference, but he had himself no\ndoubt of their genuineness.\nMr. Pearsall Smith asked whether Professor Lodge had inquired\nin what way the impression came to the percipients.\nProfessor Lodge said that they told him that when their eyes were\nclosed many indistinct images presented themselves, crowding in on\none another, and that when experimenting one such image appeared\nmore clearly and persistently than others. This one they assumed\nto be the one thought of, and guessed accordingly. He thought it\ninteresting that their description tallied with that of two young ladies\nhe had tried experiments with at Liverpool (see Proceedings, Vol. II.,\npp. 189-200) some years ago, though the percipients in the two sets of\nexperiments were completely unknown to each other and differed in\nnationality, education, surroundings, and station in life.\nGentlemen in the audience asked whether Professor Lodge had\ntried contact through gloves, or so arranging matters that the per\ncipient should not be aware whether she was in contact with the agent\nor with some other person.\nProfessor Lodge thought these both good suggestions, but had not\ntried them.\nProfessor Barrett compared these experiments to some previously\npublished by the Society, and in particular referred to some of his own\nmentioned in Proceedings, Vol. I., in which some kind of contact had\nalso been found necessary.\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Due, 1891.\nMr. Fox asked whether Professor Lodge attributed the need of\ncontact to the percipient's imagination.\nProfessor Lodge said he was not prepared to give an explanation,\nbut he thought it would be very odd if contact had any direct effect\nin facilitating thought-transference. He considered it to be a regret\ntable feature in the present experiments, and had asked the ladies to\ntry whether, by practice, they could dispense with it.\nA request being now made that he would communicate to the meet\ning his views about the performance of Mrs. Abbott\u2014advertised as\nthe Little Georgia Magnet,\nProfessor Lodge replied that he had come to a definite conclu\nsion in his own mind with regard to her performances, on the strength\nof a private interview before her public appearances began, and after\nsubsequent trials and experiments which he had made. Her perform\nance is genuine in the sense that no mechanical devices or apparatus\nare employed, and the feats she attempts she legitimately accomplishes.\nThe accounts given of those feats are often exaggerated, and the pic\ntorial representations very misleading ; but the feats themselves are\nsurprising, and at first sight incredible. He finds, however, that they\ncan nearly all be imitated, some of them very easily.\nThe alternate pulling or pushing at a man holding a chair in his\narms is absurdly simple, for no one can keep his balance under a\ncompletely irregular force.\nThe failure to slide a cue past the open hands of Mrs. Abbott, by\nexerting on it force sufficient to call out the necessary friction, is also\neasy to understand and to repeat. The way to succeed in sliding the\ncue is to decline to exert any violence at all.\nThe failure to push Mrs. Abbott from her position on the heel of one\nfoot by steadily pushing a billiard cue held by her is also a matter of\nsimple mechanics, combined with sufficient strength of arm and knack.\nA short person under thrust becomes a strut, and has a great advantage\nover a tall person : the rotating moment about her heel as fulcrum\nbeing very small. Another lady, who is also short and strong, has\nbeen found able to do the same thing. It would be impossible for a\nshort person to resist a pull in the same way ; then the tall and heavy\nperson has the advantage. But this test has been declined.\nThe resistance to pushing up against a wall faced by the lady, with\nher hands exerting very slight pressure on it, is readily explicable if\none finger be always permitted direct contact with the wall ; for a\nslight force thus applied has a considerable moment.\nThe hoisting of a chair with several persons piled on it seems to be\na feat partly of strength and partly of utilisation of the (often un\n\fDec, 1891,] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 169\nconscious and spasmodic) pressure against the floor of the feet of the\ntwo lowest persons in the pile. The raising is a jerk and very momen\ntary, and when much attention is being directed to the hands is best\ndone with the anns and knee. In the early trick with one person,\nwhen the knee and feet are likely to be watched, there is no particular\ndifficulty in doing it with the hands. When many people are on the\nchair the knee becomes necessary, unless one of those with feet on the\nfloor is an accomplice. With the knee it is possible to jerk up a good\nmany persons.\nThe apparent extra heaviness of the lady when attempted to be\nlifted by the elbows is not easy to explain. Professor Lodge con\njectures that ordinary persons have not much margin of lifting force\nto apply in this position, and that Mrs. Abbott is heavier than she\nlooks ; but even so, it is surprising that by a little inconvenient placing\nof the elbows forward or backward lifting should become so much\nmore diffioult.\nAlthough the explanation of this feat is not complete he does not\npresume it necessary to postulate an occult force for this one of the\nseries, when all the other feats are susceptible of mechanical explana\ntion. He has requested permission to try the lifting experiment\n(especially that where a boy is made difficult to lift) once more, but\nthe request was declined, unless it was done at a public performance,\nwhich is by no means so satisfactory.\nAn impromptu balance made by Professor Fitzgerald out of a chair\nand billiard cue lying on the floor indicated that Mrs. Abbott's weight\ndecreased properly as lifting force was applied ; and there is no reason\nto make the extraordinary and momentous hypothesis that the real\nweight of a person can be altered at will, though undoubtedly she can\nmake herself difficult to lift by the elbows.\nThe raising of a vertical cue held down by many hands, and with\na man perched on the top, Professor Lodge has not seen, but he\nsupposes it to be partly due to an instinctive fear lest the cue should\nbreak, with unpleasant consequences ; so that several men are liable to\nbe straining upwards instead of downwards ; especially the man whose\nhand is being hurt by pressure against the end of the cue.\nThus his report is, that Mrs. Abbott is a strong though small woman,\nand that her feats are such as would give her shortness an advantage.\nIn all cases her position with respect to the thing to be done is\nprecisely that of most mechanical advantage ; i.e., is that which a\nperson endeavouring to achieve the result by muscular force would find\nit best to assume.\nThe conclusion is that the effective agent, in all but the extra-\nheaviness case, is muscular force,\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [P\u00abc\u201e 1891.\nA paper by Mr. Hodgson, announced for this meeting, not having\nbeen received,\nMr. F. W. H. Mvers gave in its place an address on \"The\nMechanism of Suggestion.\" He endeavoured to show that the obedi\nence to hypnotic suggestions, or even to suggestions given to suscep\ntible subjects in the waking state, required us to suppose that some\nsubliminal intelligence was at work within us, and possessed powers\nwhich the supraliminal intelligence either had never possessed, or at\nany rate had now lost.\nEven the commonest of hypnotic suggestions\u2014the production of\nanalgesia or insusceptibility to pain\u2014implied (the speaker argued) an\nintelligence of this advanced type. For the absence of painful sensa\ntion was not attained (as our narcotics usually attained it) by tempor\narily abrogating all sensation ; but by dissociating the sense of pain from\nother forms of sensation\u2014by inhibiting that sense and that alone\u2014\neven in the presence of grave organic injury. Still more manifestly\nwas a watchful subliminal intelligence needed in cases of \"systematised\nanaesthesia,\" where the subject was rendered unaware of the presence,\nfor instance, of some one special person. As had been often remarked,\nthe subject must in some sense nee that person in order not to see him ;\nin order to maintain the \" negative hallucination \" that impressions of\nsight, sound, touch, proceeding from that special person were non\nexistent.\nAgain, there were many cases where hypnotic suggestion set on\nfoot some organic process\u2014as the formation of a blister\u2014which our\nsupraliminal intelligence knew no way of imitating. There must be\nsomething within us which did know how to make a blister, or the\nblister would not appear at command. Possibly our subliminal con\nsciousness might retain some power over the action of our component\ncells analogous to that possessed by our monocellular ancestors. But\nhowever far we might press this hypothesis (which Prof. Delboeuf also\nhad urged) of some renewed exercise of ancestral powers, even this\nwould not explain the action of hypnotic suggestion on tastes and\ncharacter\u2014that is to say, on cerebral ganglia which our lowly ancestors\ndid not possess, and could not therefore teach us how to modify.\nAfter briefly reviewing some of the purely physiological explana\ntions which had been put forward, and showing that they only\nattempted to cover a small fraction of the observed phenomena, the\nspeaker pointed out that the solution of the Nancy school, which\nreferred all the phenomena to \"the power of suggestion,\" was in effect\nonly a restatement of the problem itself. He urged that these marvel\nlous responses of our hidden being to mere formulae of command were\nin reality the result of self-suggestion rather than of suggestion from\n\fDeo., 1891.J Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 171\nwithout ;\u2014were analogous to many other phenomena (as automatio\nwriting, veridical hallucinations, ifcc. ) which indicated that there\nexisted within us a consciousness profounder than that with which we\nhabitually identified ourselves, and in possession of powers which our\nempirical self could not imitate, and could only dimly apprehend.\nMr. Baekwobth said that the examples given by Mr. Myers of\nthe action of suggestion were all capable of being classified under three\nheads : (a) suggestion under hypnotism, (b) involuntary self-suggestion,\n(c) voluntary self-suggestion. In the first class the active conscious\nness of the subject, which includes his will, was shut off, and the\npassive consciousness therefore lay helplessly under the operator's con\ntrol, unchecked by any interference from the voluntary activities of\nthe subject's own mind. The two other classes showed similar effects\nproduced by opposite causes respectively. Involuntary self-suggestion\nmight be considered as produced by emotion or shock strong enough to\novercome the corrective guidance of the active consciousness, as when\nthe lady seeing the child's ankle crushed in the gate instinctively\nand against facts felt the effects upon her own foot. The same truth\nis illustrated by the well-known tendency of the apprehension of a\ndisease to produce it. Such results may be induced either by the\nviolence of the shock, or of the terror, or by the weakness of the will\nin resisting them, as in nervous or hysterical subjects. Thirdly, the\ndissociative agency of self-suggestion was shown in an exactly converse\nway by persons of exceptionally strong will who imposed suggestions,\ne.g., of analgesia upon themselves, and were thus enabled to bear\nextreme pain not only without flinching but, as it seemed in many cases,\nalmost without suffering ; but this class of cases must always remain\nthe rarest of the three, because the connection of pain with physical\ninjury was one of the most deeply-rooted instincts of nature, and to\novercome it needed resistance, not only to the pain as directly induced,\nbut also to the preoccupation of inherited instincts associating it with\ninjury.\nMr. Wingfield asked Mr. Myers whether he thought that a\nsuccessful suggestion made to a person fully awake and who never had\nbeen hypnotised took effect on the subliminal consciousness.\nMr. Myers considered that since the subject carried out the sugges\ntion, not voluntarily, but because he felt he must, the suggestion did\nact on the subliminal consciousness.\nMr. Wingfield went on to say that he thought self-suggestion was\nrather common with hysterical patients. He had found a large\nnumber of cases in hospital. Erythema of a transient kind, he thought\nalso, was easy to produce by suggestion. He wished to ask how Mr.\nMyers accounted for ansesthesia produced by suggestion on a hypnotised\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Deo,, 1891,\npatient asleep, so that we must suppose the supraliminal consciousness\nto be in abeyance, and the passive consciousness supreme.\nMb. Myers was willing to assume several strata of consciousness,\nso that he saw no difficulty here.\nMk. Wingfield said that he had never been able to find a case\nwhere he could communicate, by planchette or otherwise, with any\nconsciousness below the hypnotic consciousness.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nWe give this month a number of cases of apparent thought-trans\nference. In some of these the comparative triviality either of the\nincident exciting the agent's attention, or of the percipient's experience,\nnecessarily somewhat weakens their force as evidence for telepathic\ncommunication. If telepathy be a reality, however, it probably\noperates in trifling matters as well as in serious ones, though it is\nmore difficult to observe in the former. It is important, therefore, to\nnote and record any apparent instances of it that can be observed.\nL. 893. Impression.\nFriday, March 13th, [1891].\nI am at present an undergraduate of Trinity College, Cambridge. At the\ntime the incident occurred I was a Rugby boy. I was at home for the holidays\nduring the summer of 1880. I think the month was August. I was\nemployed in reading for an Indian prize given at school ; consequently, on\nthe occasion of a tennis party given at our house, the Rectory of Great Roll-\nright, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, I did not go out with the rest when\nthey went down to our tennis court, which is about 200 yards off, but stayed in\nside the house reading Holmes' Indian Mutiny. My mother had gone out with\nthe rest to the tennis ground. Feeling it cold, she sent my youngest brother,\nH., for her white shawl. I met him halfway between the tennis ground and\nthe house carrying the aforesaid shawl [myself]. The reasons for this were :\nat the time that my mother asked my brother to get her the shawl, I felt an\nimpression that I must do something. This gradually increased in intensity\ntill I knew that my mother wanted a shawl ; then, as if by another stage of\ncompleter intuition, I knew it was a white shawl, and I knew that I had to\ngo to the drawing-room to fetch it (though I did not previously know it was\nthere). So I went and fetched it and brought it to my mother, as I felt\nobliged to do. She and my brother were, of course, greatly surprised, and I\nremember asking her whether she had thought of me in connection with the\nshawl, or wished me in any way especially to fetoh it. She responded in\nthe negative, which makes the matter more curious. The call was distinct\nand imperative, and altogether unlike anything else I have ever experienced.\nI have never seen phantasmagoria, &c., or had any other strange experiences\nof the sort before or since.

Goddard was sent to the American\nBranch of the Society by Mrs. J. A. S., who writes :\u2014\nFebruary 11th, 1891.\nMrs, Goddard's experience seems of value to me. She is an unusually\nclear-headed and sensible woman, a graduate of Mount Holyoke.\nMrs, Goddard writes :\u2014\nFebruary 11th, 1891.\nThe simple facts are these :\u2014\nI was living in Brooklyn ; my husband was travelling homeward from the\nWest. One night I was suddenly wakened as by some noise. My first\nthought was, my husband is hurt. I tried to analyse the sound. I was so\nimpressed, that to shake off the superstitious feeling, I rose, walked into the\nroom where my children were sleeping, looked at my watch, and returned to\nbed, but could not sleep.\nI said nothing of my dream, as I regarded it, to the family, but searched\nthe papers for railroad accidents.\nDuring the next night the door bell rang, and I went downstairs to let in\nmy husband. He kept one hand in his pocket ; I spoke of it ; he said he\nhad been hurt. \"Yes,\" I replied, \"I knew it\u2014at such an hour yesterday\nmorning.\" \"Why, yes, about that time\u2014but how did you know it ? \" ho\nasked, astonished.\nHe was standing on a car platform holding on to the casement of a heavy\nbrass-bound door. The conductor had suddenly slid the door together and\ncut off the end of his finger.\nMaking allowance for variation of time, we were convinced that the sound\nthat awakened me was that of the door as it crashed together.\nMr. F. B. Goddard writes to Mr. Hodgson :\u2014\nN. Y., July 31st, 1891.\nEnclosed I sent to Mrs. Goddard (at present in the country) as soon as it\nwas received by me from you. She returns it to-day, with request that I\nshould endorse and forward it to you.\nI have to say that it is some years since the occurrence, but the facts were\nsubstantially as stated.\nL. 895. Dream.\nProfessor Thomas Davidson writes :\u2014\nKeene, Essex Co., N.Y., June 9th, 1891.\nDear Mr. Hodgson,\u2014Last night, toward morning, I dreamt in a vivid\nway that my friend, Mr. S. F. Weston, whom you know, had sent me a\npostal card saying that he was \" coming on Wednesday.\" I mentioned my\ndream to two friends, Miss Kent and Mrs. John Dewey (of Ann Arbor), at\nthe breakfast-table. At ten we started for Upper Jay, some nine miles off.\nOn our way home we called at the post-office, and there I received from Mr.\nWeston the enclosed letter, the unscored part of which you are free to pub\nlish. This was about four o'clock in the afternoon,\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 18di\nYou will see from the letter that I had no reason to suppose Mr. Weston\nwas coming before the end of the month. Note that the words which I saw\non the card are not in the letter. The \" Wednesday \" made a very distinct\nimpression on my mind. The letter, as you will see, was written on Sunday.\nI enclose the independent testimonies of the two ladies.\n*****\nThomas Davidson.\nP.S. \u2014You will understand that, leaving New York to-day, Mr. W. will\nget here to-morrow (Wednesday).\u2014T. D.\nThe following are extracts from Mr. Weston's letter :\u2014\n36, Lee Ave., Brooklyn, June 7th, 1891.\nMy dear Mr. Davidson,\u2014I have delayed answering your letter for\nseveral days as I have not been quite sure where I should spend the month\nof June. I expected to return to my uncle's, but Dr. Moore urged me to\ngo to Farmington. . . . But Friday I got a letter from my brother\nsaying that his cabin had been broken into, and he is very anxious to have\nme go up there and stay during June and get things in order and repaired,\nas he has rented his cabin for July and August. ... I shall stay at the\ncabin about two weeks and hope to occupy my little tent by the last of June.\n. . . Glenmore will present the appearance of quite a villa this year. Am\nsorry I shall not be able to get the things you wanted as I shall take the boat\nTuesday night. Wish you had mentioned them in your letter. . . .\nS. F. Weston.\nMiss Kent corroborates as follows :\u2014\nThis morning, June 9th, 1891, Mr. Davidson, at the breakfast-table, said\nthat he dreamed the night before that he had received a postal card from S.\nF. W., a friend, saying that he would arrive here (Glenmore, Keene) on\nWednesday of the present week. The same evening arrived a letter from\nhim to Mr. Davidson announcing that he would leave N. Y. by the boat on\nTuesday night, which would bring him to Keene on Wednesday, according\nto the dream. Annie Kent.\nMrs. Dewey writes :\u2014\n\"Glenmore,\" June 10th, 1891.\nOn Tuesday morning, at breakfast, Mr. Davidson said he dreamed that he\nhad geen a postal card from Mr. Weston, saying that Mr. Weston would be\nin the mountains Wednesday. Tuesday afternoon there came a letter from\nMr. Weston saying he would arrive in the mountains Wednesday. He had\nnot been expected at that time. Alice Chipman Dewey.\nL. 896. Dream or Borderland Experience.\nThe following case was also communicated by Professor Thomas\nDavidson, who is well acquainted with the percipient, Mr. Alfred\nHicks, an Englishman living in America.\nThe following are the facts of a curious incident that occurred to me on\nthe 22nd of February, 1889.\n\fDec, 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 17-5\nThere has always been a keen sympathy, and a great deal of affection\nexisting between my mother and myself, and early in February I sent over a\nletter to England to be given to her on her birthday, the 22nd of February,\nI was staying at the time at 64, East llth-street, N.Y. city. Very\nearly in the morning of that day I was awakened from my sleep, and seemed\nto feel quite distinctly my mother's arms folded round me. I, too, seemed to\nhave clasped her in my arms, and her head was resting on my shoulder. I\nseemed to be saying something to her in what I should judge was Italian, but\nas I do not know that language I can only give it phonetically. As near as\nI can remember, it was \" Ma nonna mea.\"\nI was so impressed with the whole occurrence that I arose and looked at\nthe time. It was just 3.30 a.m. I was quite awake when this seemed to\noccur, and did not sleep again that morning, but lay awake thinking it over.\nThe conclusion I came to was this : that there was a subtle, mental force\nby which communications could be made between sympathetic minds, and\nto which time and space were no obstacles. I found, by calculating\nthe difference in times, that at 3.30 here it would be nearly half-past eight\nover in London, England, where my mother lives ; and as at the breakfast-\ntable, on birthdays at home, any gifts that are to be given are duly pre\nsented, of course my letter would reach her hands about then. Putting these\nfacts together, I arrived at the conclusion that when my mother received\nmy letter she had a great longing to take me in her arms again, and by some\npower I was wakened and made aware of that longing.\nIn my next letter home I told her all about my experience, and of what\nI thought was the explanation. A few days ago I received a letter in reply,\nand will now quote that part which has reference to this episode.\n[March 19th.] \" I expect your surmise is right about my waking you on\nmy birthday. I did not mean to do that, but I did long most intensely to\nfold you in my arms again, and look on your face ; but I will be patient and\nhopeful. I feel sure there is an unseen power that binds kindred sympathies\na\u2014distance cannot sever the influence. Though the bodies may be far apart,\nthere is union and communion of the higher and more mysterious part of\nour lives, I am fully persuaded.\"\nAs for the Italian (if it is such), the only explanation I can guess at is\nthis : An intimate lady friend of my mother's had just returned from a\nvisit to Italy, and may have used some such phrase, and possibly it was in\nmy mother's mind at the time. Alto. Hicks.\n64, East llth-street, N.Y. City. 31\/3\/89.\nMr. Hodgson has seen Mrs. Hicks's original letter. In a later\nletter Mr. Hicks writes: \"I have never, either before or since, had anyt\nsuch experience as that of which I have written you, and, as you may\nguess, I'm not a little interested in finding out the why and how of it.\"\nL. 897. Dream. From the Rev. H. Kendall.\nAfter being a great dreamer all my life, yet never dreaming anything\nremarkable, I at last had a dream which seems to me a clear case of thought-\ntransference. I travelled to Doncaster on Friday afternoon, February 18th,\n\f17G Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec., 1891,\n1881, to spend a day with my sister-in-law, the widow of my beloved\nbrother Thomas, who died there nearly three years before, a retired minister\namong the Primitive Methodists. After supper she showed me a book\nentitled Heaven our Home, and said that he had read it while retired at\nDoncaster. I told her that the Queen and Prince Albert read it a little\nbefore the Prince's death, and were so much interested in it that they sent\na request to the publisher to be furnished with the name of the author, as it\nwas published anonymously, and it was supplied to them privately. Nothing\nmore was said on the subject, and soon afterwards we retired to rest.\nIn the morning, a little before getting up, I had a dream about the anony\nmous book. I dreamed that my sister-in-law said to me \" Heaven our Home.\nwas written by a Primitive Methodist minister, and there is a second\nedition.\" I awoke with the impression that this dream was unique in my\nexperience. I went downstairs with my mind full of it, and at breakfast\nsoon began to speak of it to my sister-in-law. When I told her what had\ncome into my head while I was asleep she said immediately, \"Why, it\nwas written by a Primitive Methodist minister : his name is Coulbeck ; he\nwas travelling at Retford last year.\" \"Reach me that Primitive Methodist\nalmanack,\" she said to her niece. There she turned up the name and went\non to say, \"Why, he's travelling at Retford still, and there is a second edition,\nfor I saw a new edition advertised on the cover of the large magazine.\"\nThough I was confident she had not given me this information the\nprevious night\u2014lest there might have been some unaccountable lapse of\nmemory on my part\u2014I said to her, \"You did not tell me this last night? \"\n\"No,\" she replied, \"for I never thought of it myself till this morning.\"\n\" And when did you think of it ? \" \"In bed, just a little before I got up.\"\nThis was at the very time it occurred to me in sleep, and it seemed that the\nideas had been shot through the wall from her brain to mine by some subtle\nforce or other. This was all the more evident from the fact that the informa\ntion conveyed was entirely at variance with my settled belief, which was\nthat the book in question was written by some Scotch Presbyterian divine\u2014so\nmuch at variance that when I awoke it seemed to me quite laughable. It\nwas an interesting experience in the way of dreaming coming so late in life ;\nbut at the same time disappointing, for the information was not important, if\nit was true, and I felt certain it was false. . . . being, indeed, what my\nsister-in-law believed, but what was not correct. She thought she could let\nme into the secret which had been disclosed in confidence to the Queen and\nPrince. I told her that I felt certain the book was not written by a Primi\ntive Methodist minister as she supposed, and that instead of a second\nedition it was more likely there was a fiftieth, and there the subject dropped.\nMore than a year after this, being again at Doncaster, my sister-in-law\ninformed me that she had found out her mistake as to the authorship of\nHeaven our Home. Mr. Coulbeck, the minister whom she credited with it,\nhad written another book with a corresponding title, Our Heavenly Home,\nand of this a new edition had been issued.\nMy sister-in-law died at Doncaster, December 19th, 1890. This account\nis mainly from notes made shortly after the occurrence.\nDarlington, September 24th, 1891. (Signed) Henry Kendall.\n\fDec., 1891.] Journal of Society for Psychical ResedVeh. Vtl\nThis case would, of course, have been stronger had Mr. Kendall\ndreamed of the name of the minister to whom his sister-in-law attributed\nthe authorship of the book, but this, as he informs us, he did not do.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo llnt Editor of tlw. Journal of the Society foe Psychical Research.\n9, Mohovaia, St. Petersburg.\nDear Sir,\u2014 I must apologise for trespassing again upon your space, but\nI cannot leave without a reply some of the statements Mrs. Sidgwick\nmakes in the course of her remarks on my letter.\nFirst of all, I am very sorry indeed that something I said about chance-\ncoincidence versus telepathy should have shocked Mrs. Sidgwick. But as I\nmay be included myself among those who either believe in telepathy or are\nstrongly inclined to believe in it, and at any rate are very anxious to have a\nsolid basis for such a belief, I may be permitted to say that if the expres\nsion I used is offensive to anyone\u2014which I do not at all think it is\u2014it is\noffensive to myself first of all. But a belief is one thing and a proof is\nanother thing ; we may believe in telepathy, but can we say that it is\nproved ? I think no one will say that it is ; no one will, or, at least, can\nreasonably affirm that the existence of telepathy is not only probable, but\nabsolutely certain. I have always thought that the census of hallucinations\nnow in progress had been undertaken for the very purpose of supplying the\nmathematical proof hitherto lacking ; I earnestly hope it will, but mean\nwhile this is not yet the case ; in short, it has not yet been proved that\napparently telepathic phenomena cannot be the result of mere chance-\ncoincidence. We may have moral, we have no mathematical proofs that it\nis not so. Now, striving as we believers\u2014or persons anxious to believe\u2014in\ntelepathy are with this theory of \"accident \" or \"chance \"\u2014it seems to mo\nthat it is a little ungenerous and illogical to fling this very theory into the\nface of a new and perplexing fact simply because this fact is opposed to our\npreconceived opinions. I am sorry that Mrs. Sidgwick should have mis\nunderstood my position, for no one has more admiration for the work of the\nS.P.R. than myself.\nI may, however, take this opportunity of saying that in my opinion the\ntheory of chance-coincidence is applicable to some cases which others will\nconsider to be of an undoubtedly \"supernormal\" or \" supersensuous \"\ncharacter ; but I am certainly strongly inclined to think that this theory can\nnot cover the whole ground.\nI have no wish to discuss the matter here any further, nor to deal\nseparately with Mrs. Sidgwick's criticisms on the different experiments to\nwhich I had referred in my letter. Mrs. Sidgwick considers Mr. Josty to be\nan untrustworthy experimenter, but, in my opinion, fails to prove it ; I see\nno reason why his bona fides should be suspected, but naturally cannot prove\nthis too. In Mrs. Sidgwick's opinion (re Prof. Wagner's photograph) \" We\nhave no reason to think that the intelligence . . . which regulated\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec., ism.\n(very badly) the exposure of the plates by raps on the floor was unaware of\nthe prophecy which it helped to fulfil.\" I fail to see the adequacy of this\nexplanation, but obviously cannot prove that the appearance on the plate was\nof a genuinely supernormal origin. On such lines the controversy would\nnever end. It is useless, therefore, to pursue it any further ; but before\nfinishing my letter, may I be allowed to recall the fate which so many\nphenomena of different classes had to undergo before being accepted and\nsanctioned by official science ? And in our own Society, have we not the\n' ' physical phenomena of Spiritualism, \" to destroy or weaken the evidence for\nwhich so much labour, energy and talent was spent a few years ago, and\nwhich now are shunned no more, nay, are becoming almost fashionable 1\nAfter the campaign led five years ago against Eglinton's psychography\u2014and\nthat this campaign has done much good, has been very useful, I am the first\nto admit\u2014have we not Prof. Alexander's report on, inter alia, slate-writing\nphenomena still more extraordinary than those supposed to occur in\nEglinton's presence printed in our Proceedings without comment 1 Taking\nall this into account it seems to me possible that the time may come when\ntranscendental photography will have passed through the various stages\nthrough which mesmerism and hypnotism have passed already, and telepathy\nis passing now ; and, in view of this possibility, is not prudence necessary in\nrejecting evidence just as in accepting it ?\u2014Yours faithfully,\nMichael Solovoy.\nNovember 6\/13, 1891.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir,\u2014I believe that Mr. Solovoy and I are in substantial agreement\nabout chance coincidence as an explanation of psychical phenomena, but\nhe has not altogether understood my objection to his previous remarks; and\nin speaking of those \"anxious\" to believe in telepathy, \" striving \" with\nthis theory of accident, I cannot but think his mode of expressing himself\nlikely to lead to serious misunderstanding.\nA scientific attitude of mind requires that wo should not be anxious to\nbelieve one thing more than another\u2014but simply to discover the truth ; and\nif chance coincidence is an adequate explanation of any phenomena it should\nbe cheerfully accepted as such. Mr. Gurney's investigations seem to show\nthat it is not an adequate explanation of, for instance, apparitions occurring\nat the time of the death of the persons seen. It was thought, however,\nthat a more extensive investigation would make it clearer whether this is so\nor not, and accordingly we are trying to carry out such an investigation in\nthe present census of hallucinations. But there is in this no \"striving \" on\nbehalf of one theory against another ; there is only an impartial examination\ninto the facts. And if the present investigation confirms Mr. Gurney's it does\nnot follow that it would be either ungenerous or illogical to suppose that\nchance will account for certain other phenomena, such as the appearances on\nDr.Williams'photographic plates, whose alleged frequency and definiteness do\nnot seem to be beyond what accident might be expected to bring about.\nWith regard to tho \" physical phenomena of Spiritualism,\" Mr. Solovoy,\n\fDec., 1891.] Journal of Society for Pyschical Research. 179\nI think, mistakes the position both of the Society and of those members of\nit who have written on the subject. Indeed, I do not know what Mr.\nSolovoy exactly means by destroying or weakening the evidence. That\nmight be done by misrepresentation or by physically destroying notes or\nrecords, but not by criticism. And as I said in 1886, in Proceedings, Vol.\nIV., p. 74 : \"It is not because I disbelieve in the physical phenomena of\nSpiritualism but because at present I think it more probable than not\nthat such things occasionally occur, that I am interested in estimating\nthe evidence for them.\" From the foundation of the Society the subject\nhas been before it as one to be investigated, and it has never been\n\"shunned.\" It is true that it has been very difficult to find opportuni\nties of investigating except with mediums who had tricked and who\nfailed to produce evidence that did not depend on their honesty. It is\ntrue that Mr. Davey showed that we could not trust our own observation\nof phenomena such as those presented by these mediums for investigation, if\nthey desired to deceive us, and that therefore we must either have simpler\nconditions depending less on our observation, or mediums of unimpeached\nhonesty. But all this does not disprove the possibility of genuine pheno\nmena of the kind, nor would anything that has been said be vitiated by any\nfuture evidence that may be obtained. The evidence lately brought forward\nby Mr. Myers, though too small in amount to carry conviction\u2014the more so\nthat much of it is reported from recollection long after the event\u2014has at\nleast the merit that there is no known reason to distrust the honesty of any\nof the persons concerned.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwiok,\nNOTICE.\nSince the publication of the last number of the Journal, and ill\naccordance with the notice published in it, several hypnotic meetings\nhave been held on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. in the rooms of the Society\nat 1 9, Buckingham-street, Strand, which have been attended by a some\nwhat larger number than could be quite conveniently received, from\namong our Members and Associates along with a few friends. Their\nobject has been twofold, viz. : (1) to ascertain those among our Members\nand Associates and their immediate friends who have good hypnotic\nsensibilities and to gain any knowledge and experience of other good\nsubjects which they may be able to afford ; and (2) to make it easier\nto some Members and Associates who have had as yet no suitable\nopportunities for observing hypnotism to study its phenomena under\nthe convenient conditions of a small meeting of friends.\nAfter Christmas, 1891, the Society will resume the use of the rooms\nadjoining its Library, which are at present let, and with the greater\nspace thus available, which will be independent of the use of the\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec.,1891.\nlibrary in the afternoon by readers, there will be a good opportunity of\ntesting with fresh subjects some of the more important conclusions\ndrawn from previous experiments on thought-transference, &c, which\nwere chiefly carried on at Brighton ; and it is sincerely to be hoped\nthat many of the Members and Associates will have no hesitation in\nallowing their capacities as hypnotic subjects to be estimated by careful\ntrial in a small company, from which no unpleasant consequences of\nany sort need be feared. As it will never be desirable to have such\nmeetings of very large size, and as various times of meeting may be\nconvenient besides Wednesdays at 8 p.m., we should request those\nMembers and Associates who desire to attend to communicate their\nwishes to G.

[Jan., 1892.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nAn interim Meeting of the Council was held at 19, Buckingham-\nstreet, W.C., on December 23rd, to consider proposals for election to\nmembership in the Society, received since the meeting on the 4th.\nThe Rev. A. T. Fryer, and Messrs. F. Podmore, S. C. Scott, and\nR. Pearsall Smith were present. Mr. R. P. Smith was voted to the\nchair.\nThe Minutes of last Meeting were read and signed as correct. One\nnew Member and eight new Associates, whose names and addresses\nare given above, were elected. The election of nine new Associates\nof the American Branch was recorded. No other business was\ntaken.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nI. By Mr. Kirk.\n(L. 863 Continued. See Journal for July, 1891.)\nWe have received from Mr. Joseph Kirk accounts of four more\nexperiments in thought-transference with Miss G. , completing his\nseries witli her to present date. We give here an abbreviated\naccount of them. Mr. Kirk's fuller description can be seen at the\nrooms of the Society.\n(1) Made on May 23rd, 1891, in daylight while Mr. Kirk and Miss G. were\nboth waiting at a railway station. The object looked at by Mr. Kirk was a\nwhite card 3 by 4f inches with three bold black parallel sloping lines on it\nnot extending to the edges of the card. Two trials were made. The first,\nin which Miss G. was in the waiting-room and Mr. Kirk outside, was given\nup because the light was too trying for Mr. Kirk's eyes. For the second\ntrial with the same diagram Mr. Kirk sat in an outer waiting-room and\nMiss G. in an inner one out of sight of each other, but with doors open between\nthem. After 5 minutes an interruption occurred, and Mr. Kirk broke off.\nMiss G. said the diagram was just developing when they stopped. She\nsaw clearly outlined and apparently about three feet from her eyes the exact\nshape of the card in a faint bluish luminosity, while something bright, in\nwhite light, had just begun to appear on one end of it. The luminous shape\nseen by Miss G. appeared to her to be double the size of the card Mr. Kirk\nlooked at. Mr. Kirk remarks that he sees the after-image of black in daylight\nas intensely white.\n(2) The next experiment was on May 25th, 1891, in Mr. Kirk's house ;\nagent and percipient being at a distance from each other of about 11 yards,\nin two different rooms on the same floor with two closed doors between them.\nMiss G. sat in the darkest corner of a nearly dark room. The object looked\nat by Mr. Kirk was a black board 17 by 12 inches, with a round white disc\nin the middle on which was the letter A in black. This was set up against\n\fJan., 1892. Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 183\nthe wall with a bull's-eye lantern opposite to it, and Mr. Kirk sat a little to\none side to be out of the way of the lantern. He thinks that his position\nprevented the light being equally reflected towards him from all parts of the\nletter and caused the left side of it to be more clearly transferred. Miss G.\n\" saw a disc faintly luminous, with bright dashes in centre disappearing and\nreappearing with great rapidity.\" She drew what she saw as a circle with\nthree strokes below the centre and approximately converging towards a point\nnear it. These strokes do not reach the edge, and the two outer ones make\nan angle of about 45 deg. with each other, the middle and longest one being\nbetween them. The analogy between original and reproduction is obvious.\nThe time occupied in this experiment was, Mr. Kirk says, the longest he has\nknown to occur with Miss G. It was about 15 minutes before she began to\nsee anything. This experiment at a short distance was made in order to test\nthe effect of distance on clearness of visualisation by the percipient.\n(3) This experiment was made by daylight, Mr. Kirk being in the Isle\nof Wight and Miss G. at Plumstead. The object looked at was a black\ncard 3 by 4} inches, with the letter A, about 2 inches high, cut out in white\npaper pasted on to it, the strokes of the A being over J inch wide. Mr. Kirk\nnoticed that the after-images of the black were intensely white, and the\nafter-images of the white letter of a kind of smoky luminosity. By lamp\nlight he sees the after-image of black as a luminous yellow, and of white\nas a bluish shade sometimes approaching to purple. Miss G., sitting in the\ndark, saw \" a faintly luminous appearance about 12 inches across, some\ntimes settling into a smaller square more shapely defined on the right side\nthan the left, quivering brightness in centre, but too undefined to describe.\"\nThe card looked at by Mr. Kirk was placed at right angles to the window\nwith the right-hand side towards the window, which may, he thinks, account\nfor what Miss G. saw being more sharply defined on the right side.\n(4) In the next experiment, made on June 4th, 1891, from 11.15 to\n11.45 p.m., Mr. Kirk intended to impress from his house three percipients\nat once\u2014namely, Miss G. at her own house at Plumstead, and Mr. and Mrs.\nG. A. Smith at Brighton. Mr. Smith was, however, unable to sit, and Mrs.\nSmith had no visual impression\u2014although, as Mr. Kirk says, he gave each\npercipient a fair alternate trial of a few minutes each, finding it impossible\nto locate himself in two places at the same moment. He used three diagrams.\nFor the first ten minutes he looked at a black figure resembling a Maltese\ncross with a ring round it, or a wheel with 4 broad wedge-shaped spokes,\nconsiderably broader than the intervening white spaces. Then he looked at\na white oval enamelled door-plate, with black figure 3 on it, held against a\nblack notebook ; and thirdly he looked at a figure of a man's spread-out\nhand, full size, drawn in black on white paper. During the last 20 minutes\nhe glanced alternately from one of these figures to the other, but in discussing\nthe result he tells us that when he had once looked at the hand its after\nimage practically obliterated the second diagram. It will be remembered\nthat Mr. Kirk sees after-images to an unusual extent.\nMiss G.'s report is as follows:\u2014\"5\/6\/91. Sat last night from 11.15 to\n11.45. After a few minutes wavy clouds appeared [these are drawn as a\ngroup of roundish objects], followed by a pale bluish light very bright in\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

[This is drawn of an indefinite oval shape with roundish white spot\nin centre.] Near the end of experiment saw a larger luminous form, lasting\nonly a moment but reappearing three or four times ; it had lines or spikes\nabout half an inch wide darting from it in varied positions.\"\nWe reproduce Miss G.'s sketches of this last impression, the\nresemblance of which to an outspread hand is, we think, unmistak\nable.\nMr. Kirk has also tried a series of experiments with Mr. and Mrs.\nG. A. Smith at Brighton as percipients, and another with a lady at\nCambridge. The conditions under which these were tried were\nprobably difficult, not only because of the distance between agent\nand percipient but because Mr. Kirk was not personally acquainted\neither with the lady at Cambridge or with Mrs. Smith. It is not,\ntherefore, surprising that the success was small.\nMr. Kirk would be very glad to hear of any other ladies or gentle\nmen willing to experiment with him as percipients, and readers of\nthe Journal will not need to be told that he will be found a careful,\nconscientious and painstaking experimenter. He will also be glad\nto correspond with anyone wishing to inquire further into the\nphenomena.\nII. By Mr. Edmund Selous. (L. 927.)\n[In sending us the following account of his experiments Mr. Selous says :\n\" The words of the percipients were taken down as uttered, or at the con\nclusion of each, and read out to the others present. Except in the one\nunessential point given, we were all in agreement. The general account was\nwritten out the next day, generally in the morning or very shortly after.\"\nIn Mr. Selous' account of the experiments in the family of Pfarrer Schupp, the\nwords of the percipient are given in German. These we have translated.]\nOctober 30\u00abft, 1890.\nTwo examples of thought-transference.\n(1) Percipient, Hermann Schupp (age 17), second son of the Herr Pfarrer\nSchupp, Sonnenberg, bei Wiesbaden, in whose family I am now staying.\nAgents, the Herr Pfarrer Schupp, Agnes Sclrapp (his daughter), Julius\nSchupp (his eldest son), and myself. The percipient sat blindfolded in a\ncorner of the room, whilst we all sat round the table. I then placed [open]\non the table a small folding magnifying lens, the handle and part enclosing\n\fJan., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 185\nthe glass being made of some black, shiny substance. We all looked at\nthis and tried to concentrate our thoughts upon it. After a little while\nthe percipient said : \" Is it black ? \" then, \" Is it round ? \" then \" Trans\nparent ? \" The Pfarrer then took the lens and held it up so that the light\nof the lamp which was on the table fell upon the glass. Shortly after\nwards the percipient said : \" It is bright,\" and then, \"It is a pair of\nspectacles.\" He also said that it was thin towards the ends or edges. I\ncannot remember the exact German words, but this I think was the sense.\nDuring this experiment the percipient sat blindfolded in the corner, sideways\nto the gazers. It would, therefore, have been physically possible for him to\nhave shifted the bandage and stolen a glance at the table. At its conclusion\nhe gave his word that he had not seen the object, and I have not myself the\nslightest suspicion that he did so. I merely feel bound to mention the exact\nconditions.\n(2) In the second experiment the percipient, blindfolded as before, sat\nat the piano, with his back turned to the table, in which position, to the best\nof my knowledge and belief, he remained the whole of the time. I then put\none of my slippers on the table. This time there were present only the Herr\nPfarrer Schupp, Matilda Schupp (his daughter), and myself. The percipient\nwas silent rather longer than before, and, according to my own memory,\nbegan by saying \" Was it black and round ? \" so that I thought he still had\nthe mental image of the lens before him. The Pfarrer, however, contradicts\nthis and his daughter, Matilda Schupp, supports him. They are both positive\nthat after the subject said \" Black \" he went on to say, \" But not quite\nblack, more red,\" or words to that effect. As the percipient sometimes\nmuttered in a low tone, and as I had only an eight months' knowledge of\nGerman, their evidence, besides being two to one, is much stronger than\nmine. As to the continuation, however, there is no disagreement. But I\nmust first mention that my slipper was of a soft, brown, corduroy-like\nmaterial, and inside bright red and shiny. The percipient now went on to\nenumerate, one by one, almost every quality belonging to it, thus : \" It is\nred,\" \" It is hollow,\" \" It is soft,\" \" It is red and brown,\" \" It is smooth,\"\n\" It is dark underneath.\" (Where the slipper touched the cloth it was in\nshadow thrown by itself.) \" It is longish,\" \" It is pointed,\" \" It has a point\nin front.\" I then said : \" You have said quite rightly, but you must say what\nit is,\" and the Pfarrer at the same time said : \" But what is it, then ? \"\nAfter a moment or two the percipient said \" It is , it is\u2014\u2014,\" then\npaused, and at last said : \" It is a shoe.\"\nOctober 3 1st, 1890. (In the ecening.)\nExperiment in taste-transference. Percipient, Hermann Schupp, seated\nas in last case and blindfolded. I first told him that this time it was not to\nsee things but something quite different. I then took his left hand in my\nright and put some salt, which I had between my left thumb and finger, in my\nmouth. At first the percipient seemed to be seeing something, then said that\nit was \" quite indefinite,\" and so forth. I then told him that what I wanted\nto transfer was more in the nature of a \" feeling \" (Geffihl). He continued to\nsay that it was undefined and wished to take off the bandage and give it up.\nBut we pressed him to continue and after a little while longer he said, \" Is\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1892.\nit a taste ? \" The Pfarrer said, \" Yes, that was right, but he must say what\ntaste.\" He then said, first, that it was \" bitter \" and then \"salt.\" I had\nnoticed whilst holding his hand that from a little before the time when he\nsaid, \" Is it a taste ? \" he kept moving his lips about in just the same way in\nfact as I was obliged to do with the salt in my mouth. After the experiment,\nwhen I remarked that the salt had made me thirsty and drank some water,\nhe said that it had made him thirsty, too, and he also drank some. There\nwere some unsatisfactory circumstances of bustle and whispering about this\nexperiment, but nothing, as far as I could observe, to give a clue, and as my\neyes were fixed on percipient the whole time I could see that the bandage\nwas in proper position, <fec., throughout.\nNote.\u2014The occasion of whispering was that I wanted some more salt tot\nput in my mouth and made signs to Julius to this effect. When he came up\nI whispered to him but in as low a tone as possible and carefully not men\ntioning the word. In the process of giving me a little more, a few grains\nwere spilt upon the floor, there being no carpet. I certainly heard this my\nself as it was just beside me. Whether the percipient, with me between him\nand the falling salt, and the handkerchief covering his ears, could also have\nheard it I cannot, of course, be certain, but I should not think so. It must\nbe remembered, too, that he had said \"taste\" and \"bitter\" (which he\nrepeated afterwards) before this occurred.\nNovember 4th, 1890. (In the evening.)\nPercipient, Hermann Schupp. Agents, Herr Pfarrer Schupp, Julius\nSchupp, Herr Franz (a relative who had called and wished to see it), and\nmyself.\nThe object\u2014a Swedish box of matches\u2014was laid on the table, and all\nlooked steadily at it whilst the subject sat blindfolded at the piano with his\nback to the circle. On this occasion answers were given\u2014always, as it\nhappened, \" Yes \"\u2014to the questions or affirmations of the percipient. I\nshould much have preferred it otherwise, but I was no controller of the con\nditions. The percipient after a minute or two said : \" It is four-cornered.\"\n(\"Yes.\") \"It is blue.\" (\"Yes.\") \" Blue and yellow, is it not ? \" (\"Yes.\")\n\" Also red.\" (\" Impregnable \" was written across the box in large red\nletters.) (\"Yes.\") \"And brown.\" (\"Yes.\") \"There is writing on it.\"\n(\"Yes.\") \" Does it not look like a little box ? \" (\"Yes.\") \" It is a match\nbox.\" (\"Yes.\")\nHerr Franz, who was very sceptical and had been much surprised,\nsuggested that percipient had heard the matches rattle as I took them out of\nmy pocket to lay on the table (the percipient at that time sitting blindfolded\nat piano). I consider this impossible as I took them out so softly that they\ndid not rattle at all ; the box was nearly full, and, moreover, I sat the\nfarthest away of the whole circle from the percipient, at the other side of the\nroom. Herr Franz was also under the impression that I had taken the box\nout of my pocket as I went by the percipient\u2014still sitting blindfolded\u2014to\nget to my place, but this is a mistake. I feel positive I did not do so. As\nthese remarks were made I feel bound not to suppress them, but I attach no\nvalue to them.\nNote.\u2014Personally, percipient's word is amply sufficient to satisfy me,\n\fJan., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 187\nbut my rule was and always would be to act as if the contrary were the case\nHerr Franz was quite unsupported in his opinions. I think he was so astonished\nthat he took refuge in them, by force, as it were.\u2014November, 1891.\nNovember 10th, 1890. (At the Pfarrhaus, Sonnenberg ; between 6 and 7 p.m.)\n(1) Percipient, Mariechen Schupp (a little girl just 12 years old). Agents,\nMatilda Schupp, Agnes Schupp, and myself. (I was the principal agent,\nthe others not being very attentive.)\nPercipient blindfolded in chair in parlour, with her back turned to\nadjoining room. Agents in adjoining room at table. Door between the two\nrooms open and percipient in full view of one of the agents, Agnes Schupp.\nI myself had my back turned. I first took out a one-pfennig piece and laid\nit softly on the table, but immediately afterwards Agnes Schupp moved a\nlarge pair of scissors towards me as being better. I then put away the\npfennig. Shortly afterwards Matilda Schupp took away the scissors to use\nthem. I then put back the pfennig, but it being explained in pantomime\n(Matilda Schupp was sewing and did not take much interest) that the scissors\nwere wanted they were again put back, and I held the pfennig during the\nrest of the experiment shut up in my left hand. The percipient after a very\nlittle while said, \" It shines like silver,\" \" It is round \" (the handles of the\nscissors ended in two circles of steel large enough for the thumbs to go through),\n\" Rather long,\" \" Pointed,\" \" Hard,\" and on being pressed to say what it\nwas, she said, \" It is a pair of scissors.\"\nA good deal of incredulity was shown over this on account, I believe, of the\npercipient being such a volatile child and the success being quite unexpected.\nIt was asserted that she must have seen it, &c., but Agnes Schupp, who had\nbeen facing her the whole time, declared that she had never turned her head,\nand she certainly did not do so during any of the occasions when I turned\nround and looked at her, which were frequent. Moreover, my whole body\nmust have completely hidden the object on the table, which was put in front\nof me. The percipient, in the course of loudly denying these accusations,\nwhich were indeed more the outcome of surprise than anything else, said,\nto my great surprise, \" I thought first of a Pfennig.\" I consider it impossible\nthat she could have seen this minute coin lying, as it was, almost under me\non the table, and hidden by my whole bulk.\n(2) Percipient, agents, and conditions same as before, except that Hermann\nSchupp came several times in and out, and walked, once I think, through the\nroom in which percipient was sitting so that he could certainly have told her\nwhat the object was had he chosen. He gave his word that he had not done\nso, which satisfies me, but I am bound to give the whole of the facts. The\nobject placed on the table was a large bell, or rather an imitation of a bell, in\nwood, covered with a sort of silver glaze, which used to hang against the wall\nby a long silk ribbon. There was some painting round the outside, and the\nhammer was wanting. The percipient, after some minutes, said (with short\npauses between each sentence): \"It shines.\" \"It too shines like silver.\"\n\" It is hollow inside.\" \" It can be hung up.\" \" It is broad at the bottom and\nrather pointed at the top.\" \" And round.\" \" It is made of wood.\" \"There\nis something bright coloured painted on it.\" \" It has a silk ribbon.\" \" It\nlooks like a bell.\"\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1892.\nNote.\u2014I have not the same confidence in above percipient, she being\nonly a child and a very volatile one. But I consider the \" Pfennig \" incident\nunassailable ; and as regards the scissors, supposing she had here obtained\nsome clue, I do not think it at all likely that she would have said \"It is\nround.\" She would probably have thought of the general shape of the whole\ninstrument, which does not at all suggest roundness. On the other hand, it\nstruck me as odd at the time that she should at once have denned the\n\" ribbon \" as a \" silk ribbon.\" Still, this was just at the end when the idea\nof the bell, which she knew well, had probably entered her mind, and the\nsilk ribbon would, of course, be a part of it. \" It can be hung up \" is also\ncurious as being more like an abstract idea and may perhaps suggest knowing\nor guessing what it was.\u2014November, 1891.\nNovember 7th, 1890. (In the evening, at Leberberg, 3, Wiesbaden.)\n(1) Percipient, my wife. Agents, Miss Ramsey (staying with my wife)\nand myself.\nObject placed on table, a green glass smelling-bottle. The percipient,\nwho sat blindfolded, with her back to the table, said \" Round \" and \" Green,\"\nbut could not go any further.\n(2) Conditions the same exactly.\nObject on table, a Japanese photographic frame of metal in shape of\nJapanese fan, the oblong square for photograph being in the upper or fan\nend [and having a raised bronze line round its edge]. All round the square\nand covering surface of the fan, raised figures, mostly in bronze, of birds,\nflowers, &c. At base or handle end of fan, a small hole, through which was\nthreaded a bright red silk cord with tassel. In the square opening a photo\ngraph of our little boy, aged 3. [Mr. Selous sends a drawing of this fan.]\nAgent said : \" Oh, I see a plate.\" \" I see a square.\" \" Something like\na plate.\" \" Shining and ornamented all over.\" \" Something like an owl on\nit.\" (Owl not included amongst birds on frame, but the round staring face\nin photograph might well suggest one.) \"A square with a bright line all\nround, like gilt,\" \" A bright piece of red in one part.\"\nThis last assertion was repeated at intervals several times, the brightness\nof the red and its confinement to one spot being always alluded to. Could\nnot name the object. After seeing it, percipient said that she had seen little\nmen, such as children draw, in the air but had thought it such nonsense that\nshe said nothing. (The photograph was a standing-up one, in half-petticoats,\none arm being lost in shadow ; no cap.\u2014November, 1891.)\n(3) A failure. Tried after Miss Ramsey had gone to bed.\nNote.\u2014I consider it a favourable point in the two first experiments that\nthe object was not named ; it shows that the percipient did not uncon\nsciously guess at the various things in the room.\nNovember 9th, 1890.

In\nmost of the remaining experiments one of the girls acted as agent\nwith Mrs. Shield, while the other acted as percipient. It seemed to\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Then Mrs.\nShield wrote, \" Place your hand on my right foot,\" and B. did so at\nonce, asking, \" Was I to take the boot off? \" The lateness of the\nhour prevented further experiments that evening. Mrs. Shield sur\nmises that the little flutter occasioned by the entrance of the mistress\nwas just overcome when the last experiment was tried.\nSubsequently Mr. Myers was present when similar experiments\nwere tried by Mrs. Shield with the same two girls, but they failed\ncompletely. She tried again with them alone afterwards, and tells\n\fJan., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 191\nus that she was again successful, but we have not got the particulars\nof this later experiment.\nIn December, 1888, Mrs. Shield had an opportunity of experi\nmenting with a schoolmistress, Mrs. C, and her daughter A., aged\n11. On December 13th she had tried the willing-game with this\nfamily with great success and in some cases without contact. After\ndescribing this, Mrs. Shield continues: \u2014\nNext day I found only Mrs. C. and A. knitting, the maid ironing near,\nbut not included in our conversation. I was provided with fresh objects,\nand gave A. four numbers, of which two, 43 and 45, were said quickly and of\nthe others one figure of each was right. Mrs. C. had headache and I gave\nher but two ; the first was right : \"I saw the 84 dancing up and down before\nmy eyes,\" she remarked ; the second failed (we had only one try at each). I\nheld a ring in my glove and A. named it at once. \"It is wonderful, but I\nthink it must be chance, for why couldn't I see the second number ? \" was\nMrs. C.'s remark.\nThe C. family tried by themselves but \" Could do nothing worth\nmentioning\"; and when on a later day Mrs. Shield tried with A.,\nthe little girl ' ' was nervous and could do nothing either with or\nwithout contact.\" Mrs. Shield wrote her account of these experi\nments on December 27th, 1888.\nAccounts of other experiments made by Mrs. Shield will be found\nin the Journal for December, 1887.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nWe give two instances of what may have been spontaneous\nthought-transference, each of a kind difficult to make strong eviden\ntially in any special case, but alleged often to occur in a more or less\nmarked degree. It is to be desired that instances of both kinds\nshould be carefully noted, and that those who experience the first\nkind\u2014an apparent transference of a definite idea from one person\nto another,\u2014should try whether they can obtain the same result .by\nexperiment.\nL. 898. Transference of idea.\nThe following account appeared in the Boston Evening Tran\nscript, about May, 1890: \u2014\n\" Do you believe in thought-transference ? \" the master of a classical school\nasked the Listener the other day. The Listener said that he had been com\npelled by facts within his knowledge to believe that thoughts, pictures of\nobjects, and even words sometimes pass between two different minds, with\nout verbal communication. \" Well, here is a curious case,\" said the master.\n\" To-day I was hearing a class in Greek, out of this book. A young man\nwas translating from the Greek, and my eyes and thoughts were a line or\ntwo ahead of him on the page, translating for my own guidance. The\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1892.\nboy who was reciting was not particularly bright in Greek, nor noted for\noriginal or pat renderings. Well, I came\u2014a line at least in advance of him\n\u2014to the phrase, ' The Spartans did not look around,' which refers to the\nconduct of the men of Sparta in a certain emergency in battle. The verb in\nthe sentence is perieidon, and the lexicon gives ' To look around ' as the\nmeaning. As I read, to myself, it occurred to me for the first time that\n' stand by idle ' would be a better rendering in that place than ' look around.'\nBut, of course, I said nothing\u2014it only passed through my mind. The pupil\nread on. ' The Spartans,' he read, ' did not stand by idle, but ' ' Stop,\nB.,' said I ; ' When did that rendering come into your head ? ' ' Just now,\nsir,' he answered, ' as I was reading.' ' Then you didn't translate it so when\nyou got your lesson ? ' ' No, sir.' ' How did you happen to think of it ? '\n' Why it came into my head.' \"\nThe master was quite sure that his own thought had suggested the phrase\nto the boy, who, though he may not be inclined to distinguish himself in the\nclassics, is evidently a youth of a sensitive and receptive temperament.\nOn asking the master in question for confirmation, Mr. Hodgson\nreceived the following letter : \u2014\nBoston, April 9th, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014The passage in Herodotus containing the word trepieliov\nconcerning the translation of which as \"did not stand by idle,\" you asked\nme, occurs in Herodotus, VI., 108 :\u2014\n\" And when the Thebans perceived this, they marched against the Plataeans,\nwherefore the Athenians went to the assistance of the latter. When now\nthese were on the point of joining battle, the Corinthians, who happened\nto be on the spot, did not stand by idle (ov treputSov) but reconciled the two\nparties, and when both submitted the matter to them, they settled the\nboundaries of the district as follows.\"\nA boy who was only fair in Greek, but who had a good command of English,\nwas translating ; as he came to Ttput&ov, it occurred to me that \" stand by\nidle \" would be here a good rendering of the word ; I had never known of\nits being so rendered before. The boy hesitated for an instant at the word,\nand I looked at him and he at once went on, \" did not stand by idle.\" It\nseemed to me a singular coincidence.\nThe above is an account of the occurrence of which, some time since, you\nrequested information. My impression that the incident took place later in\nthe year than it really did, prevented me from looking in the right place for\nthe word ; we came across the passage some little time ago this year, and I\nam sorry not to have given you the account before.\nHoping that you have not been inconvenienced by my delay.\nWm. Nichols.\nL. 899. Emotional impression.\nThe following may be an instance of a disturbed state of mind in\none person communicating itself to another. It is, of course, diffi\ncult to estimate the importance in any special instance of feelings of\nthe sort here described in the case of a person who is, as she tells us,\n\fJan., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 193\nliable to be strongly attracted and repelled by people. But accord\ning to the account, this seems to have been a very unusually marked\ninstance of it, and one certainly justified by the event. The account\n(which we give in an abbreviated form) is sent to us by Mrs. Joseph\nPfirshing, of Chicago.\nDuring the winter of 1889-90 a company of men and women were in the\nhabit of meeting at my home, for the purpose of cultivating the German\nsides of their brains. We called ourselves simply \"The German Club,\"\nand met whenever the spirit moved us. We were a very congenial circle.\nOne day one of my neighbours came to me, saying that she had rented\nher house furnished to a German family. The gentleman who had signed\nthe lease was named L. He had been for some time book-keeper for a whole\nsale merchant, and had invited his mother and sister, who lived in Berlin,\nto spend the winter with him. The elder of the two ladies knew no English,\nexcepting the one sad word, \" homesick \" ; the daughter, a beautiful girl\nand a singer, had acquired some knowledge of our tongue at a \"pension \"\nin Germany, and \" would I call ? \"\nI promised to do so at my earliest convenience, and soon found an\nopportunity to keep my word. I only met Fraulein L. I spent a pleasant\nhalf-hour, and before I left I had the promise of the daughter that the family\nwould meet the German Club at its next session.\nOnly the ladies joined us, bringing regrets from the son, who, they said,\nwas busy with the firm's books, as the year was drawing to a close. This\nhappened several times, when one fateful evening he came.\nAs it was a very cold night, I had stepped to the door the moment the\nbell rang, and the family were the last to arrive. Mother and daughter\ncame in first, followed closely by their attendant. A quick introduction took\nplace in the vestibule, and then the ladies hastened upstairs to lay off their\nwraps. As the young man stepped into the hall I closed the door, and with\nout having clearly seen his face a terrible fear took possession of me. I\nmotioned him to hang his coat and hat on the rack, and as he passed under\nthe hall light I saw a handsome young fellow of perhaps twenty-three. He\nwas tall, fair, blue-eyed, red-cheeked\u2014a Goth. I stood perfectly still,\ndreading his coming near me again, dreading to introduce him to the others.\nI got through the ceremony somehow, and his mother and sister appearing,\nconversation became general.\nInstinct made me keep away from the stranger, but a terrible fascination\ncompelled me to watch his every motion. He seemed restless, changed\nchairs, and once he rose and began to examine some Christmas and New\nYear cards I had piled up in a basket. As he handled things precious to me\nI felt like screaming, \" Don't touch them ; they are mine ! \" A German\nbook I had given my husband was passed about. On the fly-leaf I had written\nthis verse :\u2014\n\"We should fill the hours with the sweetest things,\nIf we had but a day.\nWe should drink alone at the purest springs,\nIn our upward way.\"\nWhen he took it I could scarcely sit still. I saw him carefully read the\nwritten words, quickly close the book, rise and walk to the far end of the\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1892.\nparlour. Here his sister joined him, and as the two stood together I thought\nwhat an unusually handsome couple they were. The same Northern type of\nbeauty ; she fitted to be the mother of a race ; he a soldier in physique and\nbearing. Soon we were gathered about the tea-table ; young L. next his\nmother, I, diagonally opposite with the same dread of close contact. I saw\nher stroke his cheek. The colour forsook it for a moment and he made no\nanswering caress. It was near midnight when the club dispersed, and all\nsaid, especially the ladies, \" We have had such a happy time again with you.\"\nWhen Mr. Pfirshing and I were alone I burst out : \" How glad I am it is\nover. That young man has made me perfectly wretched. He must never,\nnever come here again. I have been almost frantic all the evening. From\nthe moment he stepped into the hall I have been obliged to hold on to myself,\nfor feer of screaming. Four hours! and now my headaches beyond endurance.\nThe club must be given up ; it is the last time we meet.\"\nOf course my husband thought me extremely silly, and no doubt I did\nappear so. He had noticed nothing unusual. Everyone had had a good\ntime ; conversation, pictures, music, had made a charming evening as far\nas he could see, and I was nervous or tired, and sleep was all that was neces\nsary ; so upstairs we went.\nThe next morning brought a heavy head and a heavier heart. T was still\nunhappy, and I could not tell why. One week I pined, and at the end of\nthat time I woke up, saying, \"Well, this morning the load is gone. I am\nso glad I feel like myself.\"\nI spent several hours in necessary housework, and in the afternoon I\nwent down town for the mere pleasure of going, a thing I did not often\nindulge in. I visited the picture stores, the book stores, the china shops,\nand, getting restle.ss again, I strayed into the Exposition building to see the\nAngelus ; then I took a train and went home. Contrary to my usual cus\ntom, I turned on Lake-avenue and entered the house through the rear door.\nIn the middle of the kitchen stood Susie, my girl, who knew all the mem\nbers of the German Club, having served them faithfully. She was leaning\non her broom perfectly motionless, and when she saw me she exclaimed,\n'' Mr. L. committed suicide this morning at three o'clock. His body was\nfound at Madison Park, near the lake. They have sent for you to comfort\nhis mother.\" He died at three o'clock, and when I awoke this morning my\nburden was gone, flashed through my mind in an instant.\nI soon knew the whole story. The night Mr. L. appeared at my house\nwas the night he knew his employer had discovered he was an embezzler.\nFor several years he had been able to hide his sin, but suddenly he had been\nentrapped. As he had rich connections here and in Milwaukee, he was given\na week's grace to make good his deficit ; failing this, arrest. His mental\nstate you may imagine. That was what affected me. No one m the room\nbut 1 alone was reserved for the fate of suffering with him. Could I only\nhave seen a little more clearly and helped him, the whole catastrophe might\nhave been averted. He would not stand before his mother a self-confessed\ncriminal ; too proud to appeal to his friends, he saw no way out of his troubles\nbut to end them.\nMrs. Joseph Pfirshing.\n3,001, Groveland-avenue, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.\n\fJan., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 195\nMrs. Pfirshing adds in a later letter: \u2014\nI have never had such a vivid sensation about a person before ; this in\nanswer to your second question. Its reality was so quickly carried out in\nthe denouement\u2014perhaps that is the reason it was so strongly impressed\nupon me. I have all my life been strongly attracted or strongly repelled by\npeople.\nMr. Pfirshing confirms, as follows: \u2014\nMr. Myers,\nDear Sir,\u2014In answer to your wish for me to corroborate my wife's\nstatements about the incident she related to you, I have only to say that I\nsaw nothing unnatural about the young man. When the company was gone\nmy wife astonished me by the statements as to her experience during the\nevening, and when, in a week, the young fellow killed himself, I recalled the\ncircumstance very plainly, but was unable to account for it.\u2014I am, yours\nvery truly, _ _\nJoseph Pfirshino.\nINDIAN CONJURING AND HYPNOTISM.\nSome of our readers may have seen\u2014either in the Daily Graphic\nof November 23rd or reproduced in Light of December 5th\u2014a letter\nnarrating the performances of a \"devil-woman\" with phos\nphorescent hair, in a chamber in a temple at Benares, who appears\nto have used hypnotism as a part of her method of wonder-working.\nThe writer describes how \" an old priest brought to the doorway a\nsmall goat. It looked in and seemed very much frightened. No\nsooner did the woman raise her hand than it became still, slowly\nadvanced towards her and, as it reached the platform, fell down and\nwas quickly drawn towards her, lying perfectly passive on its side.\"\n\"She then went through the same sort of thing\" with a cat, two\npigeons, and a snake, \"making the snake stand perfectly perpen\ndicular.\" A coolie was then fetched by the writer's servant.\n\" The woman ordered him to throw off his loose gown, so that he had\nnothing on but a loin-cloth \" ; then, \" after a few passes, she placed\nher hand under his, and slowly raised him off the ground to the\nheight of about two feet. . . She then made a few hypnotic\npasses, and he became quite stiff, and by a deft turn of her hand she\nsomehow turned his body sideways and raised him in that position\nas high as her own breast.\" The writer subsequently found the\nacoolie's arms \" rigid as iron, his fingers and hips the same.\" The\nprocess was then repeated on the writer himself. The fee for the\nperformance was two rupees.\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1892.\nMr. Barkworth has obtained from the writer\u2014Mr. W. H.\nHenderson, of 97, Eaton-Terrace, S.W.\u2014the following additional\naccount of his experiences : \u2014\nI was in Benares about a week ; I have no friends resident there, and\nonly saw the woman in question on the day before I left. She herself was\nprobably resident in the town, but did not appear to be, in any public sense,\non show. She was in a sort of temple, of which I forget the name, but it was\nin a central part of the town, and near the famous Cow Temple. From the\ninterest the temple-keepers showed at my arrival I inferred that European\nvisitors were not very frequent. The room into which 1 was brought was\ndimly lighted by one lamp, but the light fell on the face of the woman, which\nappeared to be of extreme age, very hideous and wizened ; the eyes had a\npeculiar glittering expression. She wore no headdress of any kind, and her\nhair appeared to scintillate and emit sparks (such as are sometimes produced\nin frosty weather when using a tortoiseshell comb). The goat was drawn to\nher without any contact, as though with a magnet, and the pigeons fluttered\ntowards her in a way quite unlike flying : I cannot be sure whether their\nwings were expanded at all or not The most singular animal performance\nwas that of the snake, which stood perfectly erect and rigid on the point of\nits tail ; I could see clearly that the tail was not curled on the floor at all.\nMy servant was a Calcutta man, though he had been in Benares before.\nHe seemed to view the whole performance with dread and dislike, and\nrefused to submit himself to the woman's operations in any way. He, how\never, fetched in a boy from the streets\u2014a full-grown lad. When the woman\nlifted the boy from the ground she did so by placing one of her outstretched\nhands under one of his, and as the boy was rigid she raised his whole body\noff the ground. Once she put her hand under his elbow, and in turning him\nover horizontally she used both hands. He was then apparently floating\nhorizontally in the air. I did not pass my hand or stick round him to test\nthe presence of artificial support, but I feel fully confident that there was\nnothing of the kind. At the time the lad was thus floating his feet were\npressing against the woman's body, and she had one hand in contact with\nhim, but I cannot exactly remember where. I cannot say whether the boy\nwas conscious or not, but his eyes were open.\nWhen I was raised from the ground I felt that my feet had left it, but, of\ncourse, I cannot tell whether this was an hallucination or not. I retained\nperfect consciousness all the time and a perfect recollection afterwards of all\nthat had occurred. I had never previously been hypnotised, and do not at\nall know that I was so then, though my sensations were peculiar. Most of\nher movements were exceedingly quick and rapid. The boy had his arms in\na cruciform position when I attempted to put them down. I cannot be per\nfectly certain of the absolute correct positions of the woman's hands in rais\ning the lad, or when she placed him horizontally, but have described to the\nbest of my power and recollection.\nW.

The American Branch\nnumbered 398 on the first of January, 1892. Though this showed a\nslight diminution during the year, it might be considered satisfactory,,\nseeing that the immediate loss caused by raising the subscription from\nthree dollars to five, at the commencement of 1891, had been nearly\nregained.\nThe President held in his hand an audited statement of the receipts\nand expenditure for 1891, which would appear as usual in the Journal\nand a letter from the auditor, in which he said :\u2014\" I have audited your\naccounts for 1891, which I have certified and returned to Mr. E. T.\nBennett, whose usual accuracy has been maintained, and I have much\npleasure in bearing testimony thereto.\" A statement of assets and\nliabilities at the close of 1891 showed an excess of assets of \u00a3135.\nIn this estimate, as in previous years, no account is taken of the value\neither of the Library or of the stock of Proceedings. A considerable\nportion of the excess is, however, due to Part XX. of the Proceedings\nbeing deferred to 1892, instead of having been published in 1891 as\nintended. But, after allowing for this, the financial position of the\nSociety has materially improved. The President added that the delay\nin the bringing out of Part XX. was not intended to interfere with\nthe publication of three subsequent Parts, or their equivalent, during\nthe present year.\nThe President referred to the loss the Society had sustained in the\ndeath of Professor Adams, whose name was included among the retiring\nmembers of Council who offered themselves for re-election. No other\nnominations having been made, he declared the following to be duly\n\fFeb., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 199\nelected :\u2014Professor W. F. Barrett, Lieut-Colonel J.

It would be the duty of the Council to fill\nup the remaining vacancy.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nThe Council met at the close of the Annual Business Meeting, the\nPresident occupying the chair, and there being also present, Colonel\nHartley, Messrs. Walter Leaf, F. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, S. C.\nScott, and R. Pearsall Smith.\nThe minutes of the last Meeting were read and signed as correct.\nThe proceedings at the Annual Business Meeting were reported as\nstated above.\nThe re-election of the Officers of the Society for the ensuing year\nwas unanimously carried as follows:\u2014President, Professor H. Sidgwick;\nHon. Treasurer, Mr. H. Arthur Smith ; Hon. Secretaries, Messrs. F.\nW. H. Myers and Frank Podmore.\nA vacancy in the elected members of the Council being created by\nthe death of Professor Adams, it was proposed by Mr. Myers, on behalf\nof Professor Lodge, and seconded by the President, and carried\nunanimously, that Professor Ramsay, F.R.S., be elected in accordance\nwith Rule 22.\nThe following were co-opted as members of the Council for the\nensuing year, in accordance with Rule 17 :\u2014G. W. Balfour, Esq. M.P.,\nThos. Barkworth, Esq., the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, K.T., and\nSydney C. Scott, Esq.\nThe Committees were re-elected as follows, with power to add to\ntheir number :\u2014\nCommittee of Reference. \u2014Professor Barrett, Professor Lodge, Mr.\nF. W. H.

Arthur Smith,\nMr. J. Herbert Stack, and Lieut.-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor.\nOn the proposition of the President, Mr. W. A. Carlile, of 165,\nBevington-road, Aston, Birmingham, was elected an Honorary Associate\nfor the current year. The election of Mrs. Runtz Rees as an Honorary\nAssociate of the American Branch was approved. Four new Members\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1892.\nand six new Associates, whose names and addresses are given on the\npreceding pages, were elected. The election of one new Member and\n10 new Associates of the American Branch was also recorded.\nAt his desire, the name of Mr. M. Solovoy was transferred from the\nlist of Associates to that of Members. By request, the names of Mrs.\nBoucher, Mr. W. J. Flynt, Mr. F. W. Hayes, and Miss A. Newbold were\ntransferred from the list of Members to that of Associates. A few more\nresignations at the end of 1891 were recorded.\nThe lists of Corresponding Members and Honorary Associates elected\nfor the current year will be published in Part XX of the Proceedings,\nwhich will appear almost simultaneously with this.\nTwo donations were reported as having been received before the\nclose of the year, and were directed to be acknowledged with thanks ;\none of a guinea from Miss Curtis, an Honorary Associate, and the\nother of four guineas from a member who desired it to be anonymous.\nThe Finance Committee was directed to prepare an estimate of\nincome and a scheme of expenditure for the current year, to be\npresented to the next meeting of the Council.\nThe Council agreed to meet at 19, Buckingham-street, on Friday,\nMarch 4th, at 4.30 p.m.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe Fiftieth General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, January 29th, at 4 o'clock.\nThe President, in opening the meeting, remarked that the Society,\nwas now just completing the tenth year of its existence ; that\nduring that period fifty general meetings will have been held and\ntwenty parts of the Proceedings issued completing seven volumes.\nThe Society had also gradually increased very largely in number, the\nnumber of Members and Associates, including those in the American\nBranch, being now over 1,150.\nPart of a paper by Mr. Hodgson, which will appear shortly, on \"Cer\ntain Phenomena of Trance in the Case of Mrs. Piper \" was read by Mr.\nLeaf, the part selected dealing mainly with the nature of the trance\npersonality and how far the statements made by it about itself are true.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then addressed the meeting on the subject\nof \"The Mechanism of Genius.\" The following is a summary of his\nremarks, which it is intended to publish in full in a future number of\nthe Proceedings:\u2014We have lately been concerned in tracing the action\nof the Subliminal Consciousness in hypnotic suggestion. The effects\nthus produced lie below the physiological limit of the spectrum of\nordinary consciousness ; that is to say, they involve the initiation and\n\fFeb., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 201\ncontrol of organic processes which the conscious will cannot reach.\nWe have now to consider the operation of subliminal faculty within\nthe limits of the ordinary range of consciousness ; in rendering the\nordinary senses more acute, or supplying the supraliminal self with\nintellectual products already matured below the threshold. We are\naccustomed to mass many of these phenomena together under the name\nof genius ; and perhaps we seldom give the name of genius to any piece\nof work into which some uprush of subliminal faculty has not entered.\nThere will, however, be many uprushes which are concerned with\nmatters not sufficiently interesting or important to be classed as works\nof genius. Thus there are cases where a hallucinatory clock-face has\nsuddenly appeared, conveying true information, afterwards verified, as\nto the time of day. This indicates that the sense of efflux of time is\nmore accurate in the subliminal than in the supraliminal perception.\nThere are similar instances where the sense of muscular resistance is\nfound to be more delicate in the subliminal than in the supraliminal\nstrata. So also with the various senses in turn. It is when we get to the\ncapacity of inward visualisation that we find subliminal achievements to\nwhich the word genius may fairly be applied. Such are the performances\nof arithmetical prodigies, whose feats presuppose a power of retaining\nrows of figures before the mental eye which stands to the ordinary\npower of mental picturing somewhat as a series of instantaneous photo\ngraphs stands to a dissolving view. Turning to more aesthetic triumphs,\nwe find the sense of inspiration, which is often present to inferior\npoets and painters as well as to the best, probably represents subjec\ntively some uprush of subliminal faculty, although, of course, it does\nnot guarantee the objective excellence of the product. At any rate\nthere is some satisfaction to ordinary minds in the reflection that the\nbrilliant light which the star of genius emits is due not only to its\noriginally superior magnitude, but to its fuller self-revelation, or free\ndom from the interposed and light absorbing vapours which habitually\ndim the lustre of all incarnated minds. Although we may never rival\nthe magnitude of those mighty stars, we also may some day conceivably\nfind the interposing vapours dispelled, and thus may shine with the\nfull brightness which our intrinsic magnitude allows.\nIt was asked in reference to some things said by Mr. Myers and in\nconnection with Mrs. Piper's trance whether self-hypnotisation was\npossible, and if so how it could be known when the state began or ended\nand whether one were hypnotised or not. Was not a \"census of ghosts\"\nan absurdity if it could be supposed that those seeing apparitions\nalways did so in a state of self-hypnotisation.\nMr. Myers replied that some persons could undoubtedly hypnotise\nthemselves, and that it sometimes also occurred in the case of sensitive\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1892.\nsubjects, without their intention, by self-suggestion. Usually a\ncomplete forgetfulness during waking life of what had passed in the\nhypnotic trance sufficiently marked off one state from the other.\nMrs. Gordon asked whether the extraordinary faculties shown by\ncalculating boys and some other young children did not support the\ndoctrine of reincarnation.\nMr. Myers replied that it would no doubt fit in with that Platonic\ndoctrine, or might be adduced in support of the view that faculties\nare implanted in the human being from without, but would probably\nnowadays be more often explained as a result of heredity.\nMrs. Gordon said that the frequent difficulty of tracing similar\nqualities in the immediate ancestors of the child went against the\nheredity theory.\nMr. Myers answered that the supporters of that theory would say\nthat such special faculties as those of a calculating boy were due to a\nfortuitous combination of atoms, as it were, inherited from various\nancestors\u2014it might be of any degree of remoteness.\nColonel Hartley said that an individual must be compared not\nto a private brougham but to an omnibus in which any or all of his\nancestors might be carried. Referring to what a previous speaker had\nsaid about the census of hallucinations, he thought that apparitions\nwere often seen during a brief sleep of which the sleeper was unaware,\nbut that this did not affect the interest of statistics on this subject.\nSir Lawrence Jones asked if there were instances of such a\nwelling up from the subliminal self as Mr. Myers had spoken of\noccurring only once or twice in a lifetime. If so he thought he had\nhimself experienced something of the kind. A quotation having once\nbeen made at his father's dinner-table, of which no one present knew the\norigin, he had a sudden intuition that it was from Shakespeare, and\nnamed play, act, and scene, though he had never read the play. It\nwas looked out and found correct. He had no idea how he could have\nknown, unless he had at some time turned over the pages of a Shake\nspeare dictionary and seen it.\nMr. Myers said that some such explanation was probably the true\none, and that similar experiences sometimes occurred in planchette\nwriting.\nThe President referring to the census of hallucinations, explained\nthat its value would not be interfered with by the possibility, if there\nwere such, that hallucinations were due to a species of self-hypnotisation ;\nbecause, for us members of the Society for Psychical Research at any\nrate, the chief interest of the census lay in discovering the proportion\nof cases in which the apparition appeared to be connected with some\n\fFeb., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 203\ncrisis in the life of the person seen, and in cases where such coinci\ndences were made out, self-hypnotisation will not explain the important\n-element of the phenomenon.\nTHE LATE PROFESSOR ADAMS.\nBy the death of John Couch Adams, Lowndean Professor of\nAstronomy in the University of Cambridge, our Society has lost one of\nthose rare men whose individual judgment, formed aloof from party\nand prepossession, can still carry, without published argument, a\nserious weight of its own. Cautious, modest, and retiring, even to a\nfault, Professor Adams was not lavish of words or declarations. His\nmind was a well of wisdom ; but those who would have drawn thence\nfor any slight or party purpose were apt to find that they had nothing\nto draw with, and that the well was deep. Yet on those rare occasions\nwhen he was strongly convinced that some controverted view was sound,\nsome difficult course was right, his benignant, measured speech became\nthe very weapon which a wise man addressing wise men would most\ndesire to command. Few men of eminence intervened so seldom in\nany debate ; no man, when he did intervene, left so little desire in\nprudent disputants to get up and answer him.\nWe could not have been surprised if a savant of this temper had\nkept wholly aloof from a line of research such as ours ;\u2014concerned as\nit is with questions as to which Bacon said long ago that they \" have\nnot been more laboriously inquired than variously reported ; so as the\ntravail therein taken seems rather to have been in a maze than a way.\"\nThe more encouraging was it to find that the man whose meditative\noutlook on planets, moon, meteor-streams, had veritably, and not once\nalone, transformed a maze into a way, was deeply assured that the\nsame change might be wrought in our subject-matter also by the same\nprocess of steady labour, of dispassionate care. Throughout the past\nten years of our work his sympathy never failed us ;\u2014a sympathy the\nmore valuable inasmuch as he had, of course, no illusions as to the\nstrength of our advancing column, or the nearness of our goal. But\nhe was sure that what we were doing was right to do; he held\nunwaveringly that through these adits lay an unassailable, if a slow,\nadvance into the knowledge of things unseen.\nTo a man whose fate had called him to move gropingly among\nconceptions which to him seem all-important, but which most men\nhardly care for sufficiently to investigate, or even to attack, an\napproval such as Professor Adams' comes with a force of reassurance\nwhich those who fight with great parties behind them can seldom\naeither feel or need. How greatly did this one man's few grave words\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1892.\noutweigh all hasty, momentary utterances hostile to the quest !\u2014out\nweighed them as the flashing Leonids, whose sweep he tracked through\nheaven, are outweighed by his own silent planet\u2014a telescopic object,\nmoving hidden in the deep of space, but laying from afar its unfaltering\ndue control upon the secular aberrations of the wandering family of\nthe Sun.\nEls efiol fivpioi, said Heraclitus, iav apio-ros y.

We had always been together and were as intimate as girls can be.\nClara had a little sister of four years old, whom I will call Maggie. This\nlittle Maggie was very ill, and Clara and I were very anxious about her. I\nwent away from Birmingham to Sutton for my health. I was to stay some\ntime longer. On Wednesday, September 14th, 1887, I was very anxious to\nwrite to Clara, but I had rheumatism in my hands and could not do so.\nI had been thinking much about Maggie on the night of September\n14\/15th. In the morning I suddenly found myself wide awake, the room\nbeing already light. A voice was saying, close to me, \" Don't fret, Elsie ;\nMaggie is living, but it is Clara that's dead. I looked round, but there was\nno one there. Almost at that moment the clock struck six. The voice was\nsad. Next day I felt certain that Clara was gone, and, although my hands\nwere better, I could not bring myself to write to her. On the Friday I had\nto write to a friend at home, whom I will call Mr. Dean. I said to him that\nI knew there was a great trouble at home. I said that I did not know what\nit was. But I knew quite well, only I could not mention it to Mr. Dean, I\nfelt it too much. On the Saturday I went out to do an errand for the lady\nwith whom I was staying. But suddenly I felt that I could not turn that\nway but must go towards the station. As I did so, I met my brother, who\nhad been sent to bring me home. He was surprised to see me. I at once\nsaid, \"Maggie isn't dead, is she, Win?\" He said, \"No.\" I did not\nask after Clara. I knew too well. He did not mention her either.

Both affirm they heard the sounds and\nheard their name called. Nothing seen when door opened. Certain that\nit coincided with death of their relative. Asked if they had any lurking\nsuspicion of a natural explanation, Mrs. Thompson said their servant used\nsometimes to walk about the house after they were gone to bed, and once or\ntwice they heard her and she gave them a fright. But no knocking on part\nof servant. My opinion is, possibly servant knocked and called their names.\nBut if so, the coincidence of the death of their aunt at the exact time is\ncurious. Mr. Thompson is certain he looked at his watch when the sounds\nwere heard. Never knew servant walk about so late as this. They are\nsatisfied that the servant theory does not explain the matter ; though it is an\nelement of doubt in the case in my opinion. W. F.

I went to it and there was no one there. We soon heard another\nknock, and I said it must be the back door\u2014go and see. She went\u2014no one\nwas there. Then I went to the pantry. In a few minutes I heard a knock\ning in the room above, which was my bedroom, as if a picture was tumbling\ndown ; but I did not go up to see.

Millett writes :\u2014\nRichard Hodgson, Esq. Norway, April \\Zth, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014As regards the experience you refer to, in 1857, the last days\nof November, or very first days of December, my grandfather (Soloman\nMillett) died, aged 88 years. He died in the Norway village which is three\nand a half or four miles from my farm, which he (grandfather) cleared from a\nforest and lived on it for 60 years. All of his children were born here, and\nhere his wife (my grandmother) died in 1849. Grandfather moved to\nNorway village, to live with a daughter, in 1853, and never came back to the\nold place in the body, though he greatly desired to do so, but the infirmities\nof old age prevented. The last year of his life his mind was wandering more\nor less, and he was constantly referring to the old place\u2014in spirit he seemed\nto be here.\nThe night he died, my father and mother and brother and sister, with\nmyself, were all at home. We were not expecting his immediate death.\nMy sister and brother and myself were in the front part of house, we were\nstudying our lessons for the next day's school, when all at once we heard a\ngreat noise as a horse and carriage would make driving up to the yard (the\nground was frozen hard, with no snow), and immediately raps were heard on\nthe door nearest us. We rushed out to the kitchen, where father and mother\nwere, to tell them someone had come ; but they had heard the team drive up,\nand father had already lighted the lantern to light the team into the stable,\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1892.\nbut no team was there ; no one was at the door. Early the next morning we\nlearned that grandfather died the night before at the very time the carriage\nand raps were heard.\nI was 12 years old at the time. My brother (who died in 1858) was 15 ;.\nmy sister (who is living) was older. My father and mother are both dead.\nNaturally, we have related the experience to many.\nI firmly believe, and always have, that grandfather's spirit came back that\nnight to the old place.\nGrandfather has a daughter living in South Boston, an old lady, but I\nthink she and her sons will remember our relating the experience. If you\nwould like to interview them, go to 476, Broadway, where her son Amos\nT. White is a grocer. S. H. Millett.\nMiss Millett writes : \u2014\nB. Hodgson, Esq. Norway, Maine, May 1st, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014You will pardon my delay in auswering your inquiry, as a\nletter from me can be only a repetition of my brother's letter. The evening\nmy brother refers to, my two brothers and myself were in the front part of\nthe house, in the family sitting-room, my brothers with their books, and I\nwas practising on the piano, when we suddenly heard a carriage drive into\nthe yard. The ground was frozen, so that it was a loud rumbling sound, and\nthen we heard three distinct raps on the front door. One of my brothers\nwent to the door but there was no one there. They then went out to tell our\nparents that someone had come, but our father was just going out as they\n(my parents) had heard the carriage and the raps, I think on another door.\nThe last year of my grandfather's life, his one wish had been to see the old\nhome once more, but owing to the infirmities of \u00bbge he was never able to do\nso in the flesh. We think he was permitted to do so after death. I should\nhave said that he passed away just about the time we heard the chariot\nwheels and the raps. My grandfaiher was a devout Christian. None of our\nfamily are believers in so-called Spiritualism, indeed we are opposed to it.\nYou ask my brother in your last letter if this is the only experience he\nhas had. He says it is. E. A. Millett.\nMr. Hodgson's attention was first called to this incident by an.\naccount of it, similar to the above, occurring in the course of a history\nof the Millett family, in the Oxford County Advertiser, of August 15th,.\n1890, published at Norway, Maine, U.S.A. The author of this account,\nMr. 0. N. Bradbury, writes :\u2014\nB. Hodgson. 117, Main-street, Norway, Maine, March 1st, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of the 12th inst. before me. The cutting concerning\nthe occurrence at the death of Soloman Millett was written by myself. I\nreceived the particulars from the \" three children \" mentioned therein who\nare now living at the same place\u2014two of them in the same house, and the\nthird in another house forty rods away. Their father and mother, \" Hiram\nand his wife Bhoda,\" are dead.\nAt the time the team drove up, at the time of the death of the grand\nfather, his son Hiram and wife were in the kitchen (it was early in the\n\fFeb., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 209\nevening) doing up the evening's work, and he lit his lantern and went\ndirectly to stable to open door for the team, while the children were in the\nsitting-room (with dining-room between), and they all, as they tell me, heard\nthe team, and went to the door in answer to the raps. There was no com\nmunication with parents and children until later on the subject.\nI was at the time in California, but I find abundance of people now living\nwho heard much of the event at the time.\nI doubt whether any record was made at the time. The three children,\nwho, as the cutting says, were in the parlour or sitting-room, busy with\nreading and music, are Miss Emeline A. Millett, then 25 years old ; Soloman\nMillett, then 12 years old ; and Hiram A. Millett, then quite young. . . .\n0. N. Bradbdry.\nThere was another child present at the time, then about 15 years old.\nHe died a year later.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nNOTE ON CARPENTER'S \" MENTAL PHYSIOLOGY,\" SECTION 341.\nSubjective recurrence of a previous objective sensory impression is,\naccording to Carpenter, ideational in origin, and is transmitted from the\ncortical centres downwards to the sensorium. He illustrates this by the\ncommon expression of \" It makes me sick to think of it,\" which he maintains\nto be the experience of a sensorial feeling excited by an ideational state.\nNow, in all such sensations there are three possible steps : 1st, the\nIdeational ; 2nd, the Sensorial, or, as in the case named, the Cerebro-Spinal ;\n3rd, the Peripheral or Terminal. But between the cases instanced by\nCarpenter and the sensory hallucinations which are studied by the Society\nfor Psychical Research there are two distinctions important to be observed.\n1st. The cases cited have their origin in the cortex, and are sent down to\nthe sensorium. Of this we have conscious evidence in the fact that the idea\nprecedes the revived sensation. We know this to be so, even when no\nappreciable interval is apparent, by the fact that the idea is the cause of the\nsensation, and not vice versa. Whereas, in a hallucination no such pre\ncedence is observable ; the sensory impression being immediate, and\nfrequently unassociated with any preceding idea or apprehension. From\nthis we must infer that here the sensation originates, qua the percipient, in\nthe sensorium and not in the cerebrum.\n2nd. The revived idea of the sensation, though it reaches the sensorium,\ndoes not go beyond it and become externalised1 as a quasi objective sensation\nitself. No one ever mistook the revived recollection of a scene or a flavour\nfor the sensation itself. But in telepathy this is just what does take place.\nThus we seem driven to conclude that, in the latter case, the impulse does\nnot expend itself in the sensorium, but is propagated downwards to the\nperiphery.\nIt would seem, therefore, that two distinctions are to be observed\n1 There are some rare exceptions to this rule, mostly of a pathological character,\nmentioned by Hibbert, De Boismont, &c.\u2014T. B.\n\f210 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1892.\nbetween a mental image and a hallucination. The first originates in the-\ncerebrum, but the second in the sensorium ; and the first terminates in the\nsensoriuin, but the second in the periphery.\nTelepathic hallucination may, however, conceivably have a starting point\nin the cerebrum ; not that of the percipient, however, but of the agent, from\nwhich it may be considered as acting directly on the sensorium of the\nformer. And this action would be facilitated by anything, like hypnotism\nor ordinary somnolence, tending to obscure the active consciousness of the\npercipient, and thus leave the telepathic impression unimpeded by the more\nglaring effects of the former ; just as observation of an eclipse is assisted\nby interposing smoked glass betweeu the eye and the sun. Hence the\nfrequency of hallucinations in what are called \"borderland\" conditions.\nThis view is, moreover, greatly strengthened by considering the analogy\nof certain hypnotic experiments, in which the operator tastes drugs or handles\nhot things, producing similar sensations in the subject. I take it that the\neffect upon the operator in thus tasting and handling is to strengthen his\nown mental conception of these sensations, and so promote their transfer\nence to the sensorium of the subject, so that if he could call up a sufficiently\nrealistic mental image without actual experience this tasting and handling\nmight very likely be dispensed with. In like manner phantasms of the\nliving are generally produced in times of great crises, when the impressions\nof the agent may be supposed to be peculiarly vivid.\nThomas Barkwobth.\n[For a full discussion of the subject here treated see Phantasms of the-\nLiving, chap. x.\u2014Ed.]\n\"negative hallucinations.\"\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nDear Sir,\u2014I am often teazed by what you very properly call negative\nhallucinations. After searching in vain for my pen, folder, letters, &c., which\nI know to have remained undisturbed on my table, I give up the useless\ntask, begin another pursuit and on returning to my table find easily every\nthing where I had left it I attribute this infirmity to old age, which forgets\neasily recent events while remembering those of childhood.\nTwo months ago I was returning by rail from Biarritz, and being alone in\nthe waggon with my wife I mentioned the Bidart tunnel. She stopped me\nby saying, \"There is no tunnel here ; we ought to have passed it five minutes\nago. Now I have perceived neither darkness nor the rumbling noise ; are\nyou conscious of either ? \" After a few minutes trying to remember, I quite\nagreed with her. On getting home the same evening I called a man before\nher and asked him to enumerate all the tunnels between Hendaye and\nBayonne. He quoted amongst them the one near Bidart and we were both\nnonplussed.

W. H. Myers read a paper on \" Indications of Continued\nKnowledge of Terrene Events shown by Phantasms of the Dead,\" of\nwhich the following is a summary. The paper is intended to appear in\nthe next number of the Proceedings. The following is an abstract\nof it :\u2014\nA \"ghost,\" or apparition representing a deceased person, is, on any\nexplanation, an extremely complex phenomenon. For us the primary\npoint to establish is its evidential or coincidental character ; but\nassuming this to be proved, we are still confronted with many problems\nquite beyond our solution. These problems may be divided into two\nmain groups : What takes place in the percipient when he perceives\nthe apparition ? What takes place in the agent when he causes the\napparition 1\nIt is from the study of the former of these two questions that most\nlight can at present be hoped ; and discussions as to man's subliminal\ncapacity in general will be found to have a real bearing on his capacity\nto discern these veridical phantasms of the dead. But neither must we\nneglect any indications which may throw light on the latter question :\nWhat is the condition of the discarnate personality from which the\nmessage is despatched to the incarnate mind ? And here, as a\ndefinite point for analysis, we may select the amount of knowledge\nindicated by the apparition as to terrene events which have occurred\nsince the decedent's channels of earthly information were closed.\nIn most instances the phantom\u2014vague or momentary in character\n\u2014gives no such indication one way or the other. [Case.] In some\ninstances there appears to be ignorance of events which a clairvoyant\npower might have enabled the decedent to learn. [Cases.] But here we\nseem to be in the presence of a mere dreamlike prolongation of the\nattitude of mind in which the agent passed from earth. In other\ninstances there seems to be a knowledge of the aspect and dress of the\nbody as laid out in the coffin. [Cases.] And sometimes the apparition\nso immediately precedes the arrival of news of the death that we must\nsuppose some causal connection. [Cases.] Such connection may\npossibly be found in some clairvoyant power of the percipient's ; or\nperhaps the decedent himself may be able to trace the diffusion of the\nnews of his death. Again, in some instances, the apparition seems to\noccur at a significant moment, when some crisis in the percipient's life\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, 1892.\nis impending, or has actually arrived. [Cases.] It sometimes seems as\nthough a promise given before death were followed by some manifesta\ntion from the decedent of continued interest in survivors. All should\ntry some such experiment ; should, for instance, write down and seal\nup before death some significant sentence, and after death endeavour to\ncommunicate that sentence, not necessarily to a friend, but to any\nperson who may be discerned as capable of transmitting, by automatic\nwriting or otherwise, a message from a discarnate intelligence\nMb. Leap objected that such post-mortem experiments as those\nsuggested by Mr. Myers would be vitiated a priori by the possibility of\ntelepathic impulses from the mind of the experimenter ; these might\nmake a record which would be recalled by the subliminal consciousness\nof the survivor when his attention was directed to the verification of\nthe test. Those who admit the reality of such telepathic communica\ntions between the living are bound to assign all such phenomena to this\ncause rather than to telepathic communications from the dead, of which\nwe have as yet no experimental evidence.\nMr. Myers replied that he contemplated experimental tests which\nshould have no reference to verification by any particular person. A\nsuccessful experiment, where a message left by a dead person had been\ndiscovered by a survivor with whom no previous arrangement had been\nmade, would seem to exclude explanation by telepathy.\nMr. Leaf replied that his remarks had been directed to the par\nticular experiment of the broken brick which Mr. Myers had just read.\nWhen a test had been successful without pre-arrangement it would be\ntime to consider what explanation was the least difficult ; meanwhile he\nthought that it was more useful to devote attention to the discovery of\nthe possibilities of telepathy between the living by means of experiments\nwhich were not by the nature of the case incapable of repetition.\nMr. Podmore pointed out that in most, if not all the cases quoted\nin the paper unconscious telepathy from living minds would furnish an\nadequate explanation of the facts, and he quoted an instance, published\nin Phantasms of the Living, in which an idea was proved to have been\ntransferred without design on the part of the agent or consciousness on\nthe part of the percipient. He urged that, until all the possibilities of\nthought-transference from living minds had been exhausted, it would be\npremature to invoke the agency of the dead. As a case where the\nagency of the dead would be, at all events, a plausible hypothesis, he\ninstanced the discovery through a dream or vision of a dead body in an\nunknown locality. But no such cases, he pointed out, had hitherto been\nadduced.\nMr. Baukworth said that the case quoted by Mr. Podmore could\nscarcely be held parallel to the test proposed by Mr. Myers because in\n\fMarch, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 217\nthe former there was a living agent whose mental activities continued\nin operation up to the moment of percipience. If it proved anything,\ntherefore, it would tend to show that, if Mr. Myers' test were fulfilled,\nthe mental activities of the departed were similarly continuous. On the\nother hand, a determined objector might urge that Mr. Podmore's\nproposed test would not exclude independent clairvoyance.\nTurning then to Mr. Leaf's remarks, Mr. Barkworth said that it\nseemed doing extreme violence to all probability to suppose that an\nimpression conveyed by unconscious, involuntary thought-transference\nshould remain latent for months or years, and only emerge at an\nuncertain period after the death of the agent. No such case of\nprolonged suppression had ever been observed, whether arising spon\ntaneously or experimentally. These and similar attempts to explain\naway post-mortem agency seemed to him (the speaker) like theories of\ndesperation, or the result of a willingness to accept any hypothesis\nhowever far-fetched or difficult, rather than take the phenomena simply\nfor what they stood for, viz., manifestations of a continued existence\nafter death.\nMEETINGS OF THE AMERICAN BRANCH.\nMEETING IN BOSTON.\nA General Meeting was held in the Lecture-room of the Boston\nSociety of Natural History, on Tuesday, February 9th, at 8 p.m., 113\npersons present ; Professor William Watson in the chair.\nThe Secretary read the records of the previous meeting, which\nwere approved.\nThe Treasurer read the financial statement for 1891, and the\nChairman appointed Mr. W. L. Parker and Dr. Morton Prince as\nauditors.\nThe Chairman stated that since the previous meeting (January,\n1891) a new Society, called \"The American Psychical Society,\" had\nbeen formed, and he read a list of its officers and an account of one of\nits meetings, taken from the Notes and Announcements in The Arena\nmagazine for February. This account contained some descriptions of\nsittings with a \" slate-writing \" medium, at which apparently, accord\ning to the witnesses, supernormal phenomena were manifested. The\nChairman called upon the Secretary for information concerning this\nmatter.\nThe Secretary stated that this new Society had no connection\nwhatever with the American Branch, and that the medium referred to\nin their investigations was a \" trickster,\" named Mrs. Maud Jones\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, I8i\u00bb2.\nGillett. He described a sitting which he himself hod had with her, and\nexplained how her tricks were performed. He added that the Rev.\nM. J. Savage, who was at first President of this new Society, had\nresigned from that position, and that Mr. Savage had sent a friend to\nMrs. Gillett with instructions how to detect the fraud, and that this\nfriend had caught Mrs. Gillett writing surreptitiously on a slate.\nThe Secretary then read an account by Mr. Underwood of experi\nments in automatic writing by Mrs. Underwood, and he also read\nseveral other accounts of automatic writing experiments where informa\ntion unknown to the writer, and in some cases unknown to any person\npresent, was given. In connection with these accounts he exhibited\nspecimens of various forms of instrument designed to facilitate the pro\nduction of automatic writing\u2014the planchette, the psychograph, the\nouija, the espirito, the daestu, and the oracle. He stated that Mrs.\nUnderwood usually wrote with the pen in her hand. Mr. Underwood,\nin his introduction to the samples of automatic writing obtained by\nMrs. Underwood, remarked as follows :\u2014\nI have been accustomed to regard \"automatic\" actions as those, the\nfrequent repetition of which during a long time has caused the nerve group\nings to become closely organised in the brain centres, as when actions are\nperformed from the force of habit, without consciousness, without thought.\nThe so-called messages, of which I send samples, are not written automatically\nin this sense. They indicate conscious intelligence and directive volition as\nmuch as does ordinary writing ; but these do not seem to be included in the\nordinary normal personality, which neither does the thinking nor moves the\nhand. Yet sentences are composed, verses written, and discussions are\ncarried on with Mrs. Underwood or with me, in a style always indicating\nattention, perception, reflection, and reasoning power. In writing, some\ntimes words are erased and others substituted, and occasionally the pen is\nmoved to words already written, which, connected in thought, serve as\nanswers to inquiries. The writing is usually more rapid than that of the\nconscious self, and the handwritings are different. The physical and mental\ncondition of the subject during the process is in no way abnormal or unusual.\nShe questions and criticises as freely as I do. The theories and views\nadvanced are often at variance with hers and with mine. There is a certain\noracular, authoritative manner of statement, and usually, but not always,\na stronger desire apparently to answer questions and to have the answers\naccepted than to submit to close and sharp criticism. But the spirit\nexhibited is generally a very kindly one, and sometimes there is entire\nreadiness to meet criticism. I never have been what is called a \" medium,\"\nand I do not in any way contribute to this writing except by my presence,\nwhich seems to be a necessary condition, and frequently by my attention and\nquestioning, which are often invited when not volunteered. In my absence\nlittle can be written\u2014only a few words or sentences in slow and laboured\nmanner. Once in such absence two words were written with letters reversed,\nand they could be read only when the writing was held before the mirror. It\n\fMarch, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 219\nwas the name of a person 200 miles distant, who was alive but, as was after\nwards learned, unconscious and near death, which occurred two or three days\nlater. The writing does not seem to have any exhausting or depressing\ninfluence on Mrs. Underwood, but I say, after hundreds of experiments,\nthat if prolonged it leaves me tired and with a nervous feeling.\nThe apparently extraneous intelligence was at first sometimes inferior\nintellectually to the subject, but afterwards and since, in certain lines of\nthought and in the use of language, it has evinced larger knowledge than the\nconscious self possesses. Words have been written that are obsolete or very\nrarely used, the correctness of which has been confirmed by an appeal to the\ndictionary. The spelling is often different from that of the conscious self.\nThe writing always purports to be a departed spirit\u2014a discarnate human\nbeing, and some impatience and annoyance are manifested when I try to\nobtain answers on the basis of the theory that the \" messages \" are from the\nsubconscious, or subliminal, to the ordinary self.\nMuch of the writing \u2014indeed, most of it\u2014is such as does not admit of\nverification ; some statements written, especially such as related to date,\nnames, and other details, have been found incorrect. But in other cases the\nwriting has contained evidence that the directing intelligence possessed\nknowledge not derived from the personal experience of the conscious self.\nOne evening the hand wrote the name of a person whose handwriting Mrs.\nUnderwood had never seen, and the close resemblance of the writing to the\nautograph of the person was surprising. At another time was written plainly\nand correctly a name she had never heard of, \u2014the name of the father of a\nlady who, with her husband, was present, in reply to a special and urgent\nrequest that the name be written. The gentleman, a lawyer, who took the\nwriting home with him, wrote me afterwards : \" This writing was very, very\nsimilar to the handwriting of the old gentleman. The test to my mind was\nquite convincing, more so than almost anything I ever saw, yet I have no\nfixed or positive opinion as to how it was done.\"\nI am aware that old memories may be revived undistinguishable from\nknowledge newly acquired, and I here carefully avoid referring to any inci\ndents which may belong to this class. In the August Arena Mrs. Underwood\ngave an instance of her writing a detailed statement of facts relating to\nmatters of which she knew nothing\u2014statements that were at the time dis\nbelieved by us both, but subsequently learned to be correct in the essential\nfacts and circumstances.\nOne of the peculiarities of this so-called message is the frequent assump\ntion of great names ; another is generally the impossibility of getting state\nments of facts and circumstances proving the identity of what purports to be\na departed spirit. But the theory that the messages purporting to come from\nextra-terrene minds are expressions of the subconscious to the conscious self\nis not without difficulties. Why does the subconscious self claim to be a\nspirit\u2014a departed spirit\u2014apart from the primary self, and represent itself at\ndifferent times as different spirits\u2014now an Emerson, now a slave woman,\nnow a relative, now a stranger, and write and ascribe messages to scores and\nhundreds of dead persons?\nThe writing contains evidence of knowledge, discrimination, and a moral\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, 1892.\nnature, and it is strange if the subconscious self possesses these qualities in a\ndegree which enables it to write such messages that it cannot distinguish\nbetween itself and other personalities of high and low order of intelligence.\nIf the subconscious self can make these distinctions, why does it try to deceive\nthe secondary consciousness ? Why is the lower self given to deception when\nthe upper or ordinary self is honest and trustworthy ? If the subconscious\nself really imagines it is at one time a departed Indian and at another some\ngreat personage, who passed from earth hundreds of years ago, how shall we\nreconcile such a fact with the intelligence and discrimination which it\nexhibits in the writing 1 In view of such difficulties, it is not surprising that\nmany who see this writing by persons whose character and bonafides are\nbeyond doubt find it easier to believe that the thought comes from, and the\nwriting is directed by, departed, discarnate intelligent beings. The variety\nin the handwritings at different times, the views advanced, occasional state\nments showing knowledge which must have been acquired in some super\nnormal way, and the persistence with which the controlling intelligences\ndeclare that the messages are from spirits, are plausible proofs to many of\nthe agency of spirits in producing the writing. But, on the other hand, care\nful students of the experiments of Professors Pierre Janet and Richet, of M.\nBinet, of Professor James and others in connection with the general\nphenomena of multiple consciousnesses, must be aware of a class of facts\nas difficult for Spiritism to explain as is automatic writing on the theory that\nthe messages come from the subconscious self.\nI believe with Mr. Myers, that automatic writing is but one among a\nwhole series of kindred phenomena (such as word-hearing and word-seeing)\nwhich have been intermittently noted since history began. The explanation\nof these phenomena is possible, I believe, by careful collection and study of\nall the facts according to the scientific method which has been so successfully\napplied to the study of physical phenomena.\nThe Secretary then read portions of Mr. F. W. H. Myers' paper on\n\" The Subliminal Consciousness,\" and described a case of alleged \" stig-\nmatisation\" recently occurring in Louisville, Kentucky. He had visited\nLouisville for the purpose of investigating the subject\u2014a Mrs. Stucken-\nborg, a Roman Catholic \u2014but the ecclesiastical authorities there would\nnot allow him to see her.\nProfessor H. P. Bowditch gave an account of the publication by\nProfessor Schwann of correspondence and notes in connection with\nLouise Lateau \u2014case of stigmatisation\u2014in which Professor Schwann\nexplained that he had been misrepresented by the Roman Catholic\nArchbishop as endorsing the miraculous character of the manifestations\nof Louise Lateau, whereas he was of the opinion that her phenomena\ncould be accounted for by natural causes, and he had never expressed\nany other opinion on the subject.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\n\fMarch, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 221\nMEETING IN NEW YORK.\nA meeting of the New York Section of the American Branch was\nheld in the rooms of Columbia College, on Wednesday, February 10th,\nat 8 p.m., Professor William James in the chair.

August 25th, 1886.\nI have much pleasure in acceding to your request, and I will therefore\nwrite down as accurately as I can the account of the appearance seen by\nmyself and Ella on the 22nd September, 1886, in \"Shack Lane,\" when riding\nhome together. We had been for a long ride\u2014I on my horse, and she on\nher Shetland pony, and my retriever was with us. We had arrived nearly\nat the end of the lane, Ella about 10 yards in front\u2014riding close to the\nfence, which at this part and side of the lane was very high and thick, and\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, 1S92.\nquite impenetrable by either man or horse in a hurry. We may have been\n20 yards from the end, where the lane is crossed at right angles by another\nlane, leading on to the high road and coming out on to the high road at Witton\nInn, when I missed my dog, and was going to call to Ella to ask if he had\npassed in front\u2014 or I did call to her\u2014when I suddenly saw a man at the\nhead of Ella's pony\u2014coming to meet her ; and as she met him riding very\nclose to the fence, he seemed to me to step into the fence and vanish. Ella\nput her pony into a trot to the end of the lane, i.e., about 5 yards, pulled up,\nand said, \"Did you see that man 1 He passed the head of Brownie, and has\ndisappeared. Where can he have got to 1 \"\nIt seems that we were closer to the end of the lane than I at first thought\nor could see \u2014as it was rapidly getting dusk, the time being 7.15,\u2014and what I\ntook to be a man stepping into the fence to avoid being ridden against was, to\nElla's eyes 10 yards ahead of me, a man passing her pony's head within 5 or\n6 yards of her as he crossed the head of the lane, going from C towards D,\nA being Ella's position ; B mine, 10 yards in rear of her. A man coming\nfrom C to D, would, turning his face towards Ella's pony, naturally look up\nthe lane from which we were coming. We both saw a man with a slouch\nhat\u2014an old-fashioned shepherd's frock, seemingly grey in colour, and with\ndark legs. The face I could not distinguish ; neither did Ella.\nI rode on quickly round the corner towards the high road, to see if the man\nhad run, and then turned back to the comer. I went the next morning and\ncarefully examined the bank and fence to see if there was any place a man\ncould get through, and there was no place where it was possible. Ella said,\n\"Very queer, but was it a ghost ? \" She says she could hear no footsteps, but\nthe man seemed to glide past her pony. I think she saw him longer than I\ndid, as she saw him come out of the lane to the right, and cross the whole\nopening of the lane we were in. On reaching home, Ella asked my\ngardener if he had ever heard any tales of Shack Lane being haunted. \"Oh,\nyes, miss,\" he said. \" It is said to be haunted by the ghost of a carter, in a\nsmock frock, who was murdered there long ago.\" Whether this murder tale\nhas any foundation I cannot say, but I am convinced that whatever Ella and\n\fMarch, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 223\nI saw that night was not a mortal man.

Spurgeon Green.\nI saw the man seemingly meeting Ella so distinctly, barring his face, that\nI thought to myself, Oh, here comes a man, and he will be able to say\nwhether he has met my dog. Neither of us thought there was anything odd\nin the appearance, the oddness was in the disappearance of the man. The only\ndiscrepancy in our accounts is the fact that he seemed to me to step into the\nfence to avoid being trodden on by Ella's pony, and to her he seemed to\ncross the head of the pony and disappear past the corner of the lane ; but\nthere is, I think, no real discrepancy, as it was too dusk for me to distinguish\nthe corner and what seemed to me stepping into the fence seemed to Ella\nnaturally crossing the head of the lane.\nJ.

I can learn nothing and hear nothing\nthat can fling any light on the occurrence. Of course I have not made\na practice of speaking about it to my parishioners, as many of them are\nvery much afraid of, as they say, \" meeting ghosts.\"\nI cannot, either, learn anything about the supposed murder.

I must here explain that my bedroom\nopens into my mother's, and the door between the two rooms was open.\nThere was no light beyond that which glimmered through the venetian\nblinds in each room. As I stood by the mantelpiece I was awe-struck by the-\nsudden appearance of a figure gliding noiselessly towards me from the outer\nroom. The appearance was that of a young man, of middle height, dressed\nin dark clothes, and wearing a peaked cap. His face was very pale, and\nhis eyes downcast as though deep in thought. His mouth was shaded by a\ndark moustache. The face was slightly luminous, which enabled us to\ndistinguish the features distinctly, although we were without a light of any\nkind at the time.\nThe apparition glided onwards towards my sisters, who were standing\ninside the room, quite close to the outer door, and who had first caught\nsight of it, reflected in the mirror. When within a few inches from them it\nvanished as suddenly as it appeared. As the figure passed we distinctly felt\na cold air which seemed to accompany it. We have never seen it again,\nand cannot account in any way for the phenomenon.\nOne of my sisters did not see the apparition, as she was looking the\nother way at the moment, but felt a cold air ; the other two, however, were\neye-witnesses with myself to the fact.\nf Louisa F.

The figure did not suggest to them any person they\nhad ever seen, and its dress and appearance had no associations for them.\nIts arms were held away from the body, so that they saw the light between\n\u2014about as a man's arms would be if his hands were in his pockets. They\ndid not see the hands. I think it is doubtful how much of detail each lady\nobserved independently at the time, especially as they were a good deal\nstartled and agitated, or how much the several impressions may have\ngot defined and harmonised in recollection afterwards. The figure seems to\nhave moved quietly towards them from the window.\nThere were no curtains, except a white muslin one, nor other objects\nmaking explanation by illusion plausible. It can hardly have been a real\nman, because a real man, having no business there, would not have come to\nwards them. They believe, too, that they would have heard a real man\ngoing up or down the stairs, which were at the time uncarpeted, they having\nonly recently come to the house. Moreover, had he gone downstairs he\nwould have been met by Mrs. Du Cane, who came up from the drawing-room\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Visual.\u2014Unrecognised.\nMr. Myers, in sending this case, writes :\u2014\" I have talked to Miss\nQuilty, a schoolmistress, well known to me, on the subject.\"\nI, with a young friend, was invited to spend Sunday and Sunday evening\nat a farmhouse in a certain English county. We attended evening service\nat the Wesleyan Chapel, and after supper were shown to our room, which\nwas the spare bedroom of the house. This was a long narrow room with\none window looking into the garden. As you entered the room the bed was\non the left-hand side, the window on the right, the foot of the bed towards\nthe window and about four feet from the door, and the bed itself close to the\nsame side of the wall in which was the door. The bed was an old-fashioned\nfour-poster, with heavy curtains, which were not drawn. There was a space\nbetween the bed and the opposite wall of about three feet. It was a clear,\nstill July night between ten and eleven o'clock, nearer the latter hour than\nthe former. We were both lying on our left side, facing the wall, which was\nthree feet distant, and I, to speak for myself, nearly asleep. In an instant,\nwithout the interchange of a word, we both turned over on to our right side.\nMy companion hurriedly asked if I had seen anything. Knowing she was\nnervous and rather inclined to be hysterical, I prevaricated. \"Seen any\nthing 1 Such nonsense. What is there to see 1 \" This was as much to\nreassure myself as to allay my friend's fears. I knew well what I had seen.\nStanding back in the wall I had seen a little old woman, with a white, clear\nmuslin handkerchief neatly arranged on her shoulders ; a white bordered\ncap fitting close to a sweet, calm face, her arms folded, and an apron of the\nsame material as the kerchief. I kept persuading myself that my imagina\ntion had played me a trick. I knew well how nervous and hysterical my\ncompanion was and if I let her know of my fears I might have to rouse the\ngood people of the house, and for certain reasons I was reluctant to do this.\nWaking next morning, I asked my companion, \"Did you see anything\nlast night?\" \"Yes. Did you 1\" she replied. \"I did.\" \" What did you\nsee ? \" she asked. \" What did ycm see ? \" was my reply. I would not give\nmy impressions till I had hers. Strange to relate, my companion had seen\nexactly the same vision, spectre, ghost, or what else you like to name it.\n(Signed) Ellen Quilty.\nRadwinter, November 23rd, 1891.\n\fMarch, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 227\nIn reply to further inquiries Miss Quilty writes that the date of the\noccurrence was the early part of July, 1870, and that she has never had\nany other hallucinations. Her friend's account follows. It will be\nseen that there is a little disagreement as to the date and other details,\nwhich is not surprising at this distance of time.\nIn October, 1871, myself and Miss Quilty were staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nSlight, at an old-fashioned farmhouse in Hingsmills, a village close to the\nLincolnshire coast. We had been there to tea previously, but had never slept\nthere before or knew anything of the people who had lived or died there\npreviously.\nWe retired to rest about the usual farmhouse hours. We slept in an old-\nfashioned four-post bedstead, at about 4ft. from the wall. In the centre of\nthe wall, at the side of the bed, was a cupboard.\nWe had been in bed about half an hour when I looked towards the door\nof the cupboard. I saw a little, ruddy-faced old lady, with a frilled white cap\non her head, a white handkerchief folded round her neck, and a white apron,\nas if she was sitting with her hands folded on her lap. It seemed almost as if\nit were a painting on the door ; it looked exactly as if it were living. I gave\na sudden start, and said to Miss Quilty, ' ' Did you see anything ? \" and her\nanswer was the same, \"Did you see anything 1 \" I related to her what I had\nseen, and Miss Quilty had seen exactly the same as myself; our rest was dis\nturbed for the night. On relating our story, the next morning, it proved the\nexact likeness of the farmer's mother, who had lived there before them, and\ndied in that bedroom.\nA true story. S. Moore.\nTHE WATERPORD GHOST.\nThere have been accounts recently in the Dublin papers of a family\nhaunted by \" unearthly noises \" and afflicted by having their furniture and\neffects thrown about and broken. The disturbances began about January 6th,\nin a house at Carriglea, near Passage East, which they occupied as care\ntakers, and when alarm caused them to remove to Costelloe's-lane, Waterford,\nthe disturbances followed them there. The assistance of the police had been\nsought, and, according to the newspapers, the phenomena had continued in\ntheir presence notwithstanding precautions taken by them. This, however,\nseems to be an exaggeration.\nMr. J. W. Hayes, Honorary Associate of our Society, undertook to investi\ngate the matter, and went to Waterford for the purpose on February 1st,\n\"determined,\" as he says, \"to test the following probable theories to\naccount for the doings of the Waterford Ghost : \u2014(1) The sounds were pro\nduced by what Mr. Crookes calls psychic force, or some other kindred force\nof which some person in the house was the medium. (2) The sounds, &c.,\nwere due to collective hallucination on an overwrought nervous character.\n(3) The sounds were produced by some tricks of outsiders. (4) The sounds\nwere produced by unseen intelligences. (5) The sounds were produced by a\nservant or some of the family for a purpose.\" This last is the conclusion he\nquickly arrived at. The full report of his investigations is deposited at the\nrooms of the Society, and we give here the main points.\nThe haunted family had left Waterford some days before Mr. Hayes\nwent there, but he saw the police and the neighbours. No disturbances\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [March, 1892.\noccurred, it appears, at any time while the police were on the spot except\nthat on one occasion at Carriglea knocks occurred as if made with a stick on\na door in the next room in which the eldest child of the family, a boy of 14,\nnamed Johnny, was. There seems to be no evidence that phenomena ever\noccurred beyond the reach or the power of Johnny. The police had evidence\nto show that whatever agency produced the phenomena used very human\nmeans. Thus the cross-pieces which had been knocked off a door in\nCostelloe's-lane bore marks \" as if they had been repeatedly and heavily\nstruck with a blunt instrument or were hammered off,\" and the head of a\nhatchet found in the house \" had distinct reddish paint marks just as if it had\nbeen used to crush painted timber,\" the colour of the paint on the hatchet\nand the cross-piece of the door exactly corresponding.\nTwo neighbours, a man and his wife, had, when in the house at different\ntimes, seen Johnny throwing about the things and pretending not to have\ndone so. They gave Mr. Hayes independently detailed accounts of what\nthey had observed. Another person is said to have seen Johnny in the act\nof throwing things, but Mr. Hayes did not succeed in meeting him.\nIt seems further to be generally agreed that though the father, a timid\nand credulous person, was much alarmed, and believed the disturbances to\nbe due to the spirit of a dead man named Hannington, Johnny and his\nmother were not in the least nervous or frightened by the proceedings of the\n\"ghost.\" Finally we may add that the effect of the disturbances has been to\ninduce the father to give up his caretaking jobs, leave the neighbourhood,\nand remove with his family to\u2014as it is believed\u2014the part of the country\nwhere his wife's relations live.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nDear Sir, \u2014I desire with your kind permission to make a few observa\ntions on two points which are presented in two cases\u2014one (A) of an\napparent apparition, the other (B) connected with spirit communication at a\nseance\u2014which are quoted by Mr. F. W. H. Myers, the first (A) in Part XV.,\np. 25, in the article \"On Recognised Apparitions Occurring More than a\nYear after Death \" ; the second (B) in Part XVI., p. 343, in the article on\n\"A Defence of Phantasms of the Dead\" (Appendix). One of the two\npoints bears upon the immediate destiny of the soul ; the second on an\napparent instance of evolution\u2014or growth\u2014in a departed spirit\u2014in case B.\nAs the two cases (A and B) now stand, the point that bears on the\nimmediate destiny of the soul presents a very embarrassing perplexity, since\nit seems to confirm the truth of divergent beliefs, or dogmas, held by opposed\nChristian Churches and, at the same time, to suggest a doubt as to the truth\nof either. Before quoting extracts from either case it will be as well to\nmake clear the nature of the point under observation. It is, I may venture\nto say, the general belief among members of the Protestant Church (in which\nI include Nonconformists of all denominations) that a death-bed repentance,\nwith belief in Christ, is efficacious in saving the soul, and moreover, that\nthe soul so saved passes at once into a state of eternal happiness. But this\nbelief, or dogma, is entirely opposed to that held by the Roman and Greek\nChurches. That is, according to the Protestant Church a soul enters at\nonce into either a state of everlasting happiness or punishment ; while, on\nthe other hand, the Roman and Greek Churches teach that every soul must\ngo to purgatory, where it is purified by expiating such offences committed\nin this life as do not merit eternal damnation. A soul, too, according to\n\fMarch, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 229\nthe latter Churches, may be released from this purgatorial prison on the\nprayers of the priests and others who are anxious for its repose.\nNow these two beliefs are evidently contradictory, and as each party, on\nthis point, doggedly declares the other to be in deadly error, even the\npassive recognition of the truth of both is about the last thing analysts of\npsychical phenomena of the Society for Psychical Research could be thought\ncapable of admitting as veridical communications. In case A the vision is of\na consolatory nature, and was, most certainly, believed by the narrator to\nhave been a direct answer to prayer under Divtne permission. But permission\nin this sense is distinctly uncountenanced by Mr. Myers. On this point, in\nPart XV. , p. 14, he observes : ' ' Briefly, then, the popular view regards a\n' ghost ' as a deceased person permitted by Providence to hold communication\nwith survivors. And this short definition contains, I think, three unwarrant\nable assumptions.\n\"In the first place, such words as permission and Providence are simply\nneither more nor less applicable to this phenomenon than to any other. We\nconceive that all phenomena alike take place in accordance with the laws of\nthe universe ;\u2014and consequently by permission of the Supreme Power in\nthe universe. Undoubtedly the phenomena with which we are dealing are\nin this sense permitted to occur. But there is no a priori reason whatever\nfor assuming that they are permitted in any especial sense of their own.\nNor is there any a posteriori reason for thus supposing, \u2014any such inference\ndeducible from a study of the phenomena themselves. If we attempt to find\nin these phenomena any poetical justice, or manifest adaptation to human\ncravings, we shall be just as much disappointed as if we endeavoured to find\na similar satisfaction in the ordinary course of terrene history. \"\nThe attitude of the Society's investigators is here very plainly indicated.\nThe impression made on the mind of Mr. Myers by case A (the vision of\nconsolation) may also be quoted as having an important bearing on the point\nunder consideration. On page 25 he observes : \"It is noteworthy that one\nof the percipients in this case1 (p. 26) has already experienced a ' vision of\nconsolation ' under circumstances of strong emotion. Taken by itself, that\nconsolatory vision might certainly have been classed as purely subjective.\nBut the fact that the only other hallucination which this percipient experi\nenced was (as I should myself hold) a veridical one, may inspire some doubt\nas to whether that earlier vision also may not have some veridical basis.\"\nI may now quote some extracts from A and B, which bear on the point in\nquestion. Case A : \" My father's sorrow was great [at the closely following\ndeath of his two sons] ; and at the same time he became seriously troubled\nwith many doubts regarding various points of Christian faith, and so gradually\nlost nearly all his buoyancy of spirit, and became sadly depressed. For a\nyear he thus suffered, when it was arranged that, as soon as he could plan to\nleave home, he should go to some seaside place. . . .\" The writer,\nmeantime, went to South Devonshire, but from whence she received \"a\nsudden summons [which] brought her back to find her father dead.\" Natur\nally she was much distressed at this sudden loss, and she thus describes her\nstate of mind after retiring to bed. \"I was lying in deepest anguish, beset\nnot only with the grief of the sudden loss sustained, but with the wretched\nfear that my beloved father had died too suddenly to find peace with God,\nregarding those miserable doubts that had so troubled him.\" She goes onto\ndescribe how, in the early morning, after kneeling in prayer, and earnestly\npleading that her distrustful doubts might be taken away, she was vouchsafed\na vision of her father, \"absolutely transfigured, clothed with brightness. He\n'An apparition seen by the percipient of the vision of consolation, and by her\nhusband.\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mabch, 1892.\nslowly moved towards the bed, raising his hands, as I thought, to clasp me in\nhis arms ; and I ejaculated 'Father!' He replied, ' Blessed for ever, my\nchild ! For ever blessed ! ' . . . I felt sure that Cod had vouchsafed\nto me a wonderful vision, and was not in the least afraid, but, on the\ncontrary, full of a joy that brought floods of grateful tears, and completely\nremoved all anguish except that of having lost my father from earth.\nThat is, this vision, if it is to be regarded as otherwise than purely sub\njective, records a direct answer to prayer, and a proof of the percipient's\nspecial belief - a death-bed reconciliation with God and immediate entry\ninto eternal happiness. And this is the interpretation that would be given\nto it by the Protestant Church.\nNow for the psychical aspect of case B. (Case II. [M. aut. 13], p. 343,\nPart XVI.) \" On January 19th, 1887 (says M. Aksakof), I received a visit\nfrom the engineer Kaigorodoff, who resides in Wilna. He narrated to me\nthe following circumstances. He had a governess for his children, Mile.\nEmma Stramm, a Swiss, from the town of Neufchatel, who possessed the gift\nof automatic writing. At a seance held at nine o'clock on the evening of\nJanuary 15th, at the house of Herr Kaigorodoff, at Wilna, the following\ncommunication was given in French in his presence. I have been shown\nthe original and quote this from a copy of it. The medium, who was in her\nnormal state, asked :\u2014.\n\" 'Is Lydia here 1 ' (This was a personality which had manifested itself\nat previous sittings.)\n\" ' No, Louis is here, and wishes to impart a piece of news (tme nouvelle)\nto his sister.'\n\"'Whatisitr\n\" 'A person of thy acquaintance passed away {estpartie) about three o'clock\nto-day.'\n\" ' What am I to understand by this ? '\n\" ' That is to say, \u2014he is dead.'\n\"'Who?'\n\" ' August Duvanel.'\n\" ' What was his illness 1 '\n\"' The formation of a clot of blood (d'ltn engorgement dnt sang). Pray\nfor the redemption, of his soul.' \"\nThat is, the meaning of the latter sentence, if it is to be taken as\nveridical, would be interpreted by the Roman and Greek Churches as a\nconfirmation of their belief as to the immediate destiny of the soul\u2014to\npurgatory.\nNow, as the death of Duvanel (by suicide, however, and not from the\nformation of a clot of blood) receives in this narrative an apparently indepen\ndent confirmation by other persons, there may, at first sight, seem to be\nsome warrant for classing this communication from \"Louis\" as veridical.\nBut there is a footnote appended, which presents an amazing phenomenon\nsuggestive of a great doubt as to the existence of \"Louis\" himself.\nThe note runs\u2014as an explanation why \"Louis\" communicated at the\nseance instead of \"Lydia\"\u2014thus: \" The name of a deceased brother of\nthe medium, who usually manifests at her seances. Louis died in 1809,\naged eleven months. At the beginning of the seances, about the end of\n1880, he was the first to communicate, announcing himself as his sister's\n' spirit protector. '\u2014A. A. \"\nHere, then, we surely have a clear case of spirit evolution, or growth,\nunder the same conditions observable in the growth of a babe to manhood\nin physical existence. \" Louis \" died aged eleven months, and at the age of\nseventeen years he communicates with his sister as an educated youth, who\nnot only speaks French but exhibits a knowledge of this special dogma of\n\fMarch, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 231\nthe Roman and Greek Churches, and seems to know pretty well what is going\non on either side of the veil.\nThis is a bare statement of the case, and as such, pending explanation\nfrom Mr. Myers, I leave it.\nJoseph Kirk.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nSir,\u2014Mr. Kirk's letter touches on certain problems of deep interest.\nThose problems, indeed, lie outside any realm of knowledge which we can at\npresent hope to attack by scientific methods, or to reduce to evidential form.\nYet, with the Editor's permission, I am glad to say a few words on them in\nthe tentative and informal tone which this private Journal is designed to\nencourage.\nFirst, however, and speaking from the purely evidential point of view,\nI must try to explain the apparent inconsistencies to which Mr. Kirk has\ncalled attention. He quite truly shows (1) that although disclaiming the\nidea of special Providential intervention in the case of revenants in general,\nI nevertheless incline to believe that a phantom of a departed father was in\nsome sense invoked by jirayer ; (2) and also that I quote as veridical two\ncases where the communicating intelligences give apparently discrepant\naccounts of the state of the soul after death ;\u2014in one instance implying\nimmediate bliss, and in the other instance a state of further probation,\ncapable of being benefited by the survivor's prayer. His further objection\n(3) to the idea that a soul passing away in infancy can develop in the next\nworld, is, I take it, based only upon the supposed intrinsic improbability of\nsuch development.\nI reply, then, that as to the efficacy of prayer, I conceive that prayer or\nstrong desire on the part of a percipient may have two effects. It may\ngenerate a falsidical or it may facilitate a veridical apparition. It may\ndelude the percipient into translating his own inward hopes into an imagined\nexternal communication. Or, on the other hand, it may conceivably transfer\nto some external mind the stimulus necessary to enable such communication\nreally to take place. It thus tends to make a true apparition slightly more\nprobable, but at the same time it tends to spoil the evidence for such a\nphenomenon. Thus m the case mentioned, where I hold it possible that the\ndaughter's longing may really have helped the father's manifestation, I\nshould not have ventured to suggest this possibility had not this experience\nof hers been supplemented by a more evidential experience some years later,\nwhich seems to show that she possessed the temperament, whatever it be,\nfor which veridical apparitions are possible. But in no view of the case, I\nthink, is any theological deduction from the narrative permissible. For\nthere is nothing to tell us that the daughter's longing to see her father\nreached any mind except his own.\nNext, as to the apparently divergent statements made by alleged sur\nviving intelligences. In the first place, I think that the admittedly symbolic\ncharacter of all these messages from the unseen\u2014their obvious accommoda\ntion to, or commixture with, the previous beliefs of the various percipients \u2014\nwould amply prepare us for even greater discrepancies than Mr. Kirk has\npointed out. This view has been so fully expounded by Mr. Gurney in chapter\nxii. of Phantasms of the Living that I need not further dwell on it here. I\nhave myself kept this probably symbolic character of the messages in mind\nthroughout, and have forborne to assume, for instance, that the baby con\ntrol, \"Louis, \"was a real personage ;\u2014 was anything more than a mere projec\ntion of the automatic writer's subliminal self. The question of what \"Louis\"\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mabch, 1892\nreally was\u2014like the question of what \" Phinuit \" really is, \u2014however\ninteresting in itself, does not directly affect the coincidental or veridical\ncharacter of the messages communicated under those names.\nThe difficulty of construing these messages with any certainty is curiously\nillustrated by the fact that I cannot myself see any real discrepancy between\nthe two statements which Mr. Kirk quotes as divergent. I had not myself\nsupposed (although Mr. Kirk has quite a right to suppose it) that when the\nagnostic father exclaimed ' ' Blessed for ever ! \" he had meant to imply a death-\nted return to orthodoxy. On the contrary, I had imagined him to mean\nthat he now found that his agnosticism had not stood in his way in the future\nlife, and that he was happy in spite of it. Nor need such beatitude exclude\nhis desiring (like the so-called \" Louis \") the continuance of earthly prayers\nfor him, \u2014of that earnest direction of his daughter's desire which had already\nhelped him to turn upon her the gaze of consoling love.\nBut, after all, assume that these messages are to be taken literally ; \u2014\nassume that they do really imply divergent religious views on the part of\ndeparted spirits ;\u2014what reason have we to suppose that departed spirits at\nonce discover either that their creeds have been true, or that their creeds\nhave been mistaken ? Humannm est errare may still be true beyond the\ntomb. Far be it from any of us to cling so fixedly to any dogmatic opinion\nas to incur 'the fate of those Solifidians whom Swedenborg saw seated in\neternal conclave, and perpetually quoting to one another texts in support of\ntheir favourite tenet ! For these earnest men did not perceive that the\nfurniture of their spiritual dwelling-place had gradually disappeared, and\nthat they were seated in a kind of outhouse, and round a kitchen table.\nDark figures, too, had begun to move in the background ; but these figures\nthe Solifidians, when Swedenborg left them, were still too much engrossed to\nperceive.\nSwedenborg's realistic conception of spiritual retribution may lie for us\nbetween a jest and a parable. But I would not quit such topics as Mr.\nKirk has started with any admixture of jest. I feel with him that it is\nright to hope that sooner or later our investigations may throw some light,\nnot only upon new laws of the universe, but upon the moral duty, the\nspiritual destiny of man. And no more than Mr. Kirk himself do I suppose\nthat any such new light can degrade our best conceptions as to the efficacy of\nprayer. Rather than suppose that all prayer is bootless, I would say that\nin some sense there may be no power but prayer. On earth we know\nnothing stronger than the confluence and concourse of a multitude of high\ndesires ;\u2014the flow of many hearts towards some mighty end. And in that\nworld which lies behind appearances we may perhaps discern that the true\nbasis and correlative of all apparent forces lies in some energy of the spirit ;\n\u2014some energy which may inform all extremes of operation, from the weak\naffinities and narrow oscillations which sway our feeble souls up to motions\nof vaster amplitude, \u2014 up to some Will compared with which the will of all\nmankind may be but as the axial spin of a petty planet, \u2014swept on the\nwhile in some cosmic star-stream, with the drift of the Pleiads or in the\nBear. And, lastly\u2014to turn to the question of continued evolution after\ndeath\u2014we surely may suppose that as the eternal process ripens the onward\nstruggle of our enfranchised spirit will become not weaker but more strong.\nMore and more will our innermost felicity be one with our unattained\ndesire.\n\" Blessed for ever ! \" did that phantom say? And how can a soul be\nblessed for ever, unless for ever she arise and travel on? or what better than\neternal death were any imaginable eternity which was not an eternity\nof progress, and therefore an eternity of hope ?\nF.

Hence he said he should expect to find in it indica\ntions of hyperesthesia, and of increase of suggestive power ; and as to\nmemory, that dream memory will be between the memory of our waking\nstate and of hypnotic trance, that it will fill up lacunae of waking\nmemory' which sometimes occur owing to injury or shock and that\ndream memory will be fuller than waking memory, and things\nforgotten will reappear in hypermnesic dreams. He illustrated these\nvarious points and gave instances of lost things being found through\ndreams, some of which could be explained by a revival of memory, and\nothers which seemed to require the supposition of a previous subconscious\n\fApril, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 235\nperception in the waking state, since the position of the lost object had\ncertainly never been consciously known to the dreamer though it had\nbeen within his range of vision.\nThe Chairman, speaking of Mr. Myers's brilliant series of papers on\nthe subliminal consciousness, said he understood him to be sketching a\nsort of skeleton hypothesis, with niches in it, in which could be pro\nvisionally arranged and classified a number of the facts with which our\nSociety had to deal. It was necessary in scientific investigation to\nconstruct tentative hypotheses, though it was not always necessary to\npublish them. Sometimes, however, when the subjects dealt with were\ncomplicated and obscure and but little understood it might be desirable\nto do so.\nMr. Myers then read an anonymous paper\u2014\" Records of a\nHaunted House \"\u2014by a lady known to him and who was the chief\npercipient in the case. It was an account of an apparition frequently\nseen between the years 1882 and 1889, in a certain house, by a number\nof people, and sometimes by two together.\nAN APPEAL TO NON-INFORMANTS.\nWe have reason to believe that in spite of the urgent requests for\nfurther information on all the subjects comprised within the range of\nour Society's work, which appear monthly on the cover of this Journal,\nand have been reiterated on many other occasions, it still sometimes\nhappens that our Members and Associates become possessed of interest\ning testimony, or have an opportunity of fruitful experiment, of which\nthey send no information whatever either to the Society's Secretaries\nor to the Editor of this Journal. In some cases we have accidentally\ndiscovered that this was so ; and the non-informant, if I may so term\nhim, has excused himself on the ground that he supposed that we had\nalready got enough cases of that kind,\u2014had tried these experiments\nsufficiently often. Now this is far indeed from representing the view\nof those who are carrying on the Society's work in England or America.\nOur object is not merely\u2014as some of our correspondents seem to think\u2014\nto convince ourselves that certain remarkable phenomena occur; nor\nto convince the Members of the Society; nor even\u2014to mention a still\ndistant goal\u2014to convince the whole scientific world. We want not only\nto register these phenomena but also to understand them. And\nassuredly in proportion as we do begin to understand them\u2014in pro\nportion as we begin to have hope that they may some day be set forth\nnot as isolated marvels, but as integral portions of an orderly scheme of\nthings\u2014in equal proportion do we feel the need of a far wider range of\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1892.\nevidence, a far richer material for any induction which is to lead us\nsafely toward ultimate Law.\nWe endeavour to publish as much as we can, within the limits\nimposed by paucity of workers, inadequacy of funds. But imme\ndiate publication is not the only use to which evidence sent to us may\nprofitably be put. Much which cannot at once be used should be\nstored in our archives ; there should be a fund on which our successors\nas well as ourselves may be able to draw.\nBut perhaps I am refining too much as to the reasons why\npossible informants neglect to communicate their information. Per\nhaps the \" bottom fact \" is simply that it is too much trouble to put\npen to paper. Perhaps, as the German professor phrased it, \"The\nghost is willing but the meat is weak.\" With that weakness I have\na deep fellow-feeling ; but we must all exhort each other to overcome\nit. Here is the real crux of our enterprise. People have sometimes\nspoken to me with sympathy of the aversion and contempt which my\nchosen studies were doomed\u2014not unnaturally, as they seemed to\nthink\u2014to encounter. But I have always felt that it was not in that\ndirection that my complaint against the human race would lie. \"Alas !\"\nI have been tempted to answer\u2014slightly modifying the words of a\nfavourite poet :\u2014\n\"Alas, the indolence of men\nHas oftenest left me mourning ! \"\nI may add that small informal gatherings are now generally held on\nWednesday afternoons and evenings at the rooms of the Society, for\nthe purpose of experiment and of the communication of facts. Any\nMember or Associate wishing to be present at these meetings is requested\nto write to Mr. G. A. Smith at the rooms.\nF. W. H. M.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nSELF-SUGGESTION.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Societt for Psychical Research.\nDear Sir,\u2014May I suggest that a large field of most interesting observa\ntion is open to those who wish to observe the phenomena supposed to be pro\nduced by self-suggestion, in the facts of which the most striking examples\nare given in the experiences of \"Faith Healer?\" and \"Christian Scientists.\"\nI do not mention either them or their methods in any spirit of disparagement,\nbeing myself a believer in the mysteries of prayer ; neither do I wish to vouch\nfor the truth of all their theories, which in the case of the last body seem to\nbe a fusion of mystical paradoxes with rather mixed philosophy. But it\nseems to me that they have somehow hit empirically upon what I cannot\nhelp thinking may prove to be real methods for applying psychical force both\n\fApril, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 237\nto themselves and to others. Divested of any peculiar wording\u2014and the\nChristian Scientists seem to delight in calling old things by new names\u2014\ntheir method seems to be this : Concentrate your thought upon a desired or\nundesired result, and expect the result to take place, and it very likely will\ntake place. Thus, if you are afraid of catching influenza, and are always\nthinking about it and expecting to catch it, you probably will do so ; as the\ncondemned criminal, told he was to sleep for a night in the bed of a cholera\npatient, and put into a bed perfectly free from all infection, is said to have\ndied of cholera before the morning. Again, Edward Irving went into the\npulpit with cholera symptoms upon him, concentrated his thoughts upon\ndelivering his message before he succumbed, expected\u2014as the sequel of his\nown prayers\u2014that result to take place, and the cholera symptoms passed\naway.\nIt is obvious, that while the ordinary nervous fears of the average man\nor woman are quite enough to make them expect evil, they must be of a\nremarkably sanguine temperament to make them expect good with anything\nlike the certainty with which they look forward, say, to the processes of\nnature. The old woman who prayed that the mountain in front of her house\nmight be removed, and shook her fist at it in the morning, saying, \" I\nknowed ye'd be there,\" had not felt this expectation. The Founder of\nChristianity limited the certainty of response to prayer to those who did feel\nit. Professor Huxley's well-known challenge would have excluded it.\nHitherto the purchase needed to produce this expectation has been almost\nentirely given by religious belief, true or untrue ; though possibly we may\nclass under the action of the same law the success of certain S.P.R.\nexperimenters in producing impressions upon an absent percipient. The\nsame engine of concentration of thought and expectation of result has prob\nably been used by a saint labouring for the conversion of a sinner or by an\nObi man doing his enemy to death. The moral worth of a religion would\ncome to be tested not by its thaumaturgic power but by the moral worth of\nits objects, if this were proved to be a fact. A means would also be\nindicated by which the average man could infallibly obtain physical and\nmoral mastery of his lower self, and give strength and help to his neighbours\n\u2014granted only that he desired good thoroughly and had perseverance enough\nto train himself to the exercise of the power. Has not the discovery of the\nprocess of self-suggestion brought us near enough to the subject to make it\nworth while to investigate it scientifically ?

In many departments of Psychical Research we have to do with\nabnormal states and with actions\u2014like automatic writing\u2014 not regulated by\nthe normal consciousness, and it is quite conceivable that apparent success\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1892.\nin spirit-photography might be brought about by actions of the experimenter\nof which his normal consciousness had neither knowledge at the time nor\nrecollection afterwards.\"\nNow, as regards this I should like, with your kind permission, to point\nout, first, that if we admit the principle here involved we cannot consistently\nset any limits to its application ; and secondly that the common experience of\nmankind does not justify us in admitting it as a working factor at all\nor considering it in any other light than as a quantity ne'gligeable ; thirdly,\nthat even if we admit the unconscious self as a disturbing factor which we\nare bound to take into account this would not destroy the value of experi\nments made by single individuals. No one, I suppose, will deny that this\nvitiating element would at the very most operate only in a small minority of\ncases. If, therefore, the results of a number of solitary workers supported\neach other and all pointed in the same direction, then, although each case\nsingly might be weak yet all the cases taken together would be strong. The\nargument would be cumulative. Moreover, solitary effort would not exclude\ncombined effort and it would then be time to judge of the value of the former\nwhen we had seen how it tallied with the latter. If we found the one\nsupported the other we need then have no further uneasiness on this head.\nIn writing this I am assuming the experimenter to be a non-medium, and\nI think I am justified in assuming this, for as no reservation is made in the\ntext it should be held to cover the whole of the possibilities. I am quite\naware of the general method of obtaining spirit photographs, viz., through a\nmedium, but it does not at all follow that this must be the only method.\nThere are at least two conceivable cases in which the operator might be alone\nand have no \"psychic\" powers of any description, (1) in the case of haunted\nhouses ; (2) in that of photographs taken at or about the moment of death.\nI do not know if this latter has yet been suggested, but it would seem to open\nan interesting field.\nEven, however in the case of mediums absolutely alone I do not con\nsider that the objections to the principle are disposed of, for the following\nreasons :\u2014\n(1) The photograph itself might refute the unconscious deception theory\nby its manifest want of resemblance to the medium ; but as to this a balance\nof opinion would be necessary.\n(2) Some reiutne' is yet wanted of the evidence for bond fide mediums\nunconsciously deceiving. (Paid mediums, as we know, have no grace given\nthem in this respect except perhaps by Spiritualists ; yet it is evident that if\nwe admit this theory, \" intent to deceive \" can rarely be proved, however\nlikely.) Without sufficient evidence we should not assume the action of the\nunconscious self in mediums by analogy with other abnormal states where\nspiritual agency is not asserted, for this would be to assume a knowledge of\nthe very point which has yet to be made clear, viz., the cause of mediumship.\n(3) My argument as to the possible cumulative effect of evidence from\nindividual experiments, and the testing of these by comparing them with\nothers made by two or more persons still remains ; for even with mediums\u2014\nI mean, of course, in private life\u2014this unconscious deception, as many can\ntestify, is not the rule.\n\fApril, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 239\nI think, therefore, that, taking into consideration the rarity of mediums\nand the immense interest and importance of the phenomena if established, it\nwould be extremely unwise to exclude any avenue of evidence, and that we\nshould rather be ready to receive whatever we can get. We could then judge\nof each case on its own merits, and of the whole by its cumulative effect.\nThere is also a prudential consideration which may have weight, that is to\nsay if we really desire to get evidence. Mediums can hardly help resenting\nthis assumption of their own agency however the pill may be gilded, and by\nshutting out the second best class of experiments we run a danger of lessening\nthe number of the best.

[April, 1892.\nMr. John Titterton, of Ely, describes an experience of his own in\nconnection with Mr. Harlock's death, as follows :\u2014\nEly, December 2nd, 1891.\nIt was on the 4th of August, 1863, a beautiful calm evening. I was\nfishing from a boat on the Ouse, a mile or so below Ely. I had been much\ntroubled with floating weeds, and rested from the amusement to look around.\nA few hundred yards away I saw an outrigged skiff coming down stream,\nhandled, evidently, by a tyro whose difficulties were by no means lessened by\nthe condition of the stream. As it neared me I saw it was a gentleman with\nwhom I had some acquaintance, Mr. Charles Theodore Harlock, a partner\nwith his brother in a large brewery. Seeing me, he came alongside and we\nchatted for some time. \" Yon are very uneasy in your boat, and the weeds\nare dangerous for you,\" I said, \" can you swim ? \" \" No,\" he replied, \" but\nI am all right ; I shall get on better soon.\" We parted, and I still watched\nthe awkward looking roll of his craft as he went on his way. The whole\nthing had passed quite out of my mind. The next evening [Wednesday,\nAugust 5th, 1863] I was pursuing my usual sport, accompanied by a man\nnamed John Taylor, a labourer, who generally punted the boat for me. The\nweeds were less troublesome, and the evening was delightful, and the water\nsmooth as glass. Having finished my sport, my man punted me slowly\nhomewards as I smoked my pipe, for smoker I am, but a drinker of strong\ndrinks I am not, and my health has for very many years been perfect. I\nwatched the fish as they darted from beneath the boat in the clear water.\nI saw we were approaching something unusual in the water, and there, about\ntwo feet below the surface, I saw the soles of two stockinged feet. The\ncolour was a blue-grey. They were the feet of Mr. Harlock, as I saw them\nin the straps of the stretcher, without his boots. I sprang to my feet and\nseized an extra punting pole I always carried. \" For God's sake, stop,\nJack,\" I shouted, as I got back to the spot where I had seen the feet.\n\" There is a drowned man here.\" We searched until we were tired, and\nfound nothing, yet I saw what I describe so clearly that nothing I remember\nis so clear to me as that. The time was half-past seven. As I walked\nthrough the streets on my way home I saw knots of people standing about.\n\"Has anything occurred?\" I asked of some men. \"Yes,\" replied one of\nthem, \"Mr. Charles Harlock is drowned.\" \"When?\" I inquired. \"It\nwas half-past seven this evening,\" he replied. I cannot describe the shock\nit gave me. The accident happened fully three miles from where I saw\nthose upturned feet. Taylor is living and will well remember the\ncircumstance.\nMr. Myers writes on January 7th, 1892 :\u2014\nTo-day I had an interview with Mr. Titterton, an excellent witness.\nHe has never had any other hallucination of the senses.

A-* P8 or A\" P8\nThe following narrative was sent to the American Society for\nPsychical Eesearch by Mr. Thomas Darling, of 30, St. John-street,\nMontreal :\u2014\nAugust 13th, 1885.\nThe late William Darling, of Montreal, Can., was born in Edinburgh, Scot\nland, in June, 1819. He was the eldest of a large family, the second of whom\nwas Margaret, born within two years after William. These two were much\nattached to one another. William left home and settled in Montreal about\n1838. He revisited Edinburgh from time to time down to about 1847,\nwhen he married in Edinburgh and returned to Montreal. Margaret\nmarried Robert Taylor in Edinburgh about 1843, and continued to reside\nthere. On the occasions of William's visit to Edinburgh, the friendship\nbetween Margaret and himself continued of the same warm character that\nit had been previous to his leaving home. By Margaret he was always held\nin high esteem ; she was naturally warm-hearted and impulsive.\nBetween 1847 and 1855 the brother and sister had not seen each other ;\nthey corresponded at intervals and the cordial feeling for each other was\nuninterrupted. In 1855 Margaret had two children alive, and had been for\nsome years previously in rather indifferent health from an asthmatic affec\ntion, but she was not an invalid. Her husband had always enjoyed fair,\naverage health.\nOn the morning of December 15th, 1855, William appeared in his office\nabout the usual hour. He was then at the head of a large wholesale\nhardware business, which was conducted under his immediate supervision,\nrequiring close application, for which he was well fitted. He was apt to\nappear absent-minded by reason of the preoccupation one in his position,\nbusy about manifold details, is likely to experience. On the morning in\nquestion he was more than usually preoccupied in manner, and walked\nbackward and forward, evidently influenced by a condition of mental dis\nturbance which prevented him giving any fixed attention to business\nmatters then transpiring. His brother Thomas, the present writer, was\nemployed in William's office and wrote at the same desk with him.\nThomas was then in his twenty-first year, William being in his thirty-\nseventh. The absent-mindedness of the latter continued for probably half\nan hour, when he came up to Thomas and in an agitated manner, which he\nevidently was unable to control, said : \"I am afraid something serious has\nhappened to Margaret. I appeared to see her during the night walking\nabout in a room wringing her hands and saying, ' Poor fellow ! poor fellow ! '\nShe was crying and evidently very much distressed. I don't know who was\nthe cause of her grief but the effect on my nerves and spirits I am quite\nunable to shake off. I feel overpowered with the sense that something\nserious has occurred to cause the condition of grief in which I appeared to\nsee her, and I must make note of the date so as to be able to know when\nthe mail arrives whether my fears and sufferings have been connected with\nanything that has taken place.\" That was substantially the purport of his\ncommunication, and his words are reproduced as faithfully as they can\n\fApril, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 243\nbe recollected. William's well-known matter-of-fact character made the\noccurrence just recounted rather startling. He was all the opposite of an\nimaginative man and was regarded as one of the most clear-headed of the\nmercantile men in the city. His judgment had long been, and continued\nto be, down to the date of his death in 1885, held in the highest estimation\nby all who knew him.\nIn the interval, until the arrival of the mail some two weeks afterwards,\nhe continued to show unusual signs of prttoccupation, and when the mail at\nlast arrived it was with evidently profound agitation ihat he received the\nintelligence of the death of Margaret's husband, Robert Taylor, which\noccurred on the 14th December, 1855, from inflammation of the bowels, after\nan illness of only three days. The account received was that Margaret had\nbeen somewhat unwell with the asthmatic complaint from which she suffered\nand was partially confined to bed. Her husband complained of feeling\nunwell and, being in bed, had the doctor see him. He was prescribed for\nand next day was worse. On the third day the doctor informed Mr. Taylor\nthat if he had any matters to arrange he had better attend to them, as he\ncould not recover. Taylor answered in agitated tones, \" Do you think I am\ngoing to die ? I feel no pain.\" Margaret, who was also in bed, sprang up\nin alarm and continued in a condition of great excitement until the death of\nher husband, which occurred not many hours afterwards. Until the news of\nhis death arrived there had, of course, been no intelligence of Mr. Taylor's\nillness and the coincidence of William's mental disturbance with the time of\nMargaret's excitement impressed all of us who knew the facts and had had\nan opportunity of being aware on the 15th of what had occurred to excite\nhim on the previous night. The occurrence was duly communicated in\ncorrespondence to Edinburgh and was the subject of comment in the family\nat intervals when any similar subject happened to come up. Margaret died\nabout 1862, but no similar experience ever visited William, so far as is known.\nThe unusually matter-of-fact and unimaginative character of the man\nmade all the circumstances just narrated very impressive. The coincidence\nwas startling and the facts were so fully known to the present writer at the\ndate of their occurrence as to leave no room for question that they are\ncorrectly narrated, and that no possibility existed for any intimation of\ndanger having served to produce events so foreign to ordinary experience.\nIn another letter, dated 23rd November, 1886, Mr. Darling says:\u2014\nI duly received your letter of the 2nd inst., and have since found my\nlate brother's letter-book of January, 1856. Enclosed find an extract from\nhis letter to my father of the 14ih January, 1856. This is the only allusion\nto the circumstance that I find in the letter-book. The letters from my\nfather of the 14th and 21st December, 1855, to which this is a reply, I have\nnot found, but they would bear out the account I have given of Mr. Taylor's\nshort illness and death.\nYou will notice that from the fact of William's thoughts dwelling on\nDavid as being the deceased that there was no prior intimation to turn his\nthoughts towards Mr. Taylor. William's avoidance of any allusion to his\nvision of Margaret in distress is quite explicable in view of the manner in\nwhich such a communication would have been received by my father.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [April, 1892.\nExtract from a letter written by William Barling at Montreal on January\n14th, 1856, to his father, William Darling, who resided in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nDear Father,\u2014I have your letters dated the 14th and 21st December,\nboth of which brought distressing news at the beginning of a new year.\n. . . I was quite prepared to hear of the death of a relative on the 14th\nDecember, but I supposed it to be David. I am no believer in dreams, nor do\nI ever think of them as being more than the result of a disturbed or unsound\nsleep, but at the time of Mr. Taylor's death I was suddenly startled in my\nsleep with the words \" Poor fellow,\" and an impression left, that I could not\nshake off, that someone had died that night. I mentioned at once to Mary\nthat I thought David had died that night, and on the following Sabbath I men\ntioned to Tom that I was impressed with the idea that someone had died on\nthe 14th December, and I thought we would hear it was David, and\nthat I intended to make a note of the matter.\nMr. Thomas Darling continues :\u2014\nThe foregoing conveys a very weak impression of what took place at the\ntime ; the letter is written a month after the event ; the excitement under\nwhich the writer laboured on the 15th December and for some time afterwards\nhad had time to subside, and the press of business prevented the subject\nbeing dwelt on after the knowledge of the event had been received ; besides,\nWilliam Darling, Senior, was of a disposition that had no sympathy with\nwhat he might regard as a giving way to imagination, and anything of the\nnature of a circumstantial account of what actually occurred might have\nexposed the writer to a criticism which his disposition would prompt him to\navoid. The letter is characteristic of the man ; he was of few words and was\nnot given to elaborate a statement, especially if there was reason to suppose\nthat his correspondent might not sympathise with the mental disturbance\nwhich the occurrence produced. In no subsequent letter is there any\nallusion to this matter.\nThe reference to \" David \" in the letter of January 14th, 1856, arose from\nthe fact that David, the brother of William, had been suffering from\npulmonary affection for some years, and had gone from Canada to Italy,\nwhere he was then residing, in consequence of delicate health. David died\nin Italy about December, 1856.\nMr. Darling writes again on August 2nd, 1889 :\u2014\nIn reply to yours of June 25th, I have conversed with the widow of my\nbrother William regarding the occurrences of December 14th, 1855. My\nsister-in-law's account of my brother's disturbance is to the effect that she was\nawoke during the night and found him sitting up in bed, exclaiming in tones\nof anxiety, \"What is it?

I have neglected communi\ncating with my sister in Edinburgh as to the occurrences there, but will do\nso by an early mail, and will communicate to you the reply upon receipt.\nMy brother's widow informs me that a similar disturbance visited William\nin the year 1870, when he was absent in Europe, for the space of about nine\nmonths. At that time the Fenian raids took place from the States into\nCanada, and the Volunteer corps of this city were ordered to the frontier for\nthe purpose of preventing the entrance of the Fenians at that point.\nThomas, one of the sons of William, was a member of the Cavalry corps so\nsent out. Mrs. Darling states, that in his communications to her, my brother\nreferred to serious mental anxiety which had come upon him during the\nnight under similar circumstances to those described upon the occasion of\nthe death of Mr. Taylor, the impression created upon his mind being that\nsome impending danger threatened a member of his family here. The fact\nwas, the anxiety referred to occurred on the date at which his son Thomas\nwas called out as above mentioned. His mother was under very consider\nable anxiety at the time, particularly so in the absence of her husband. It\nhas not been stated to me that William's anxiety was on her account, nor was\nit connected with any one of the family in particular, but his mental disturb\nance caused him to communicate with Mrs. Darling on the subject, and it\nappears that after his return here it was referred to more than once, and\nshe associated it with the occurrences at the time of Mr. Taylor's death as\nbeing of a similar character. This circumstance was not communicated to\nme at the time, or I would doubtless have been in a position to give a more\ncircumstantial account of it, and it was only upon my intimating to my sis\nter-in-law my belief that William had never been so affected at any other\ntime that she informed me of what took place in 1870.\nI communicate these circumstances to you so that you may be fully in\nformed of everything which might possibly affect your opinion on the\nphenomena involved in these matters.\nMrs. Darling subsequently added to a copy of above letter the\nwords :\u2014\nThese statements are all correct.\u2014Mary Darling.\nMr. Darling's sister, Mrs. Lyell, wrote to her brother as follows :\u2014\nEdinburgh, August 18<\/i, 1889.\nI have also to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant.

My husband was in the house, and\nI think it likely he was one who helped to carry her out, but I have not a\nperson to refer to, to corroborate that, as I don't think there is anyone alive\nwho was there, and my memory now is not good, unless helped by an\nincident that might biing it back to me.

Veridical Dream.\nThe following case, also received through the American Branch,\nis difficult to classify. It is one of those which so curiously suggest\nthat the mere arrival of an unopened letter or newspaper has some\ntendency to produce in the mind a knowledge of its contents. In the\npresent instance, however, telepathy from Mrs. E. F.'s correspondent\nin Connecticut is a possible explanation. Names are suppressed by\nrequest.\nStatement by Mrs. J. A. S.\nFebruary 2\u201ed, 1891.\nIn December, 1888, I was living in Colorado, and I had rented my upper\nrooms, as a flat, to a lady from Connecticut, who had an invalid son. One\nmorning she told me that the night before she had dreamed that a young\nman in Connecticut was dead. This young man had been a friend of her\nson, was nearly the same age, and a year or more previous had bad severe\nhemorrhages from the lungs, had been sent to Denver, and had gone home\ncured. It was the success of the climate in his case that had induced Mrs.\nE. F., my tenant, to come to Colorado with her son. The evening before\nMrs. E. F. had this dream, a paper from Connecticut had been brought in,\nbut she had been too busy to look at it, and it lay through the night in its\nwrapper, on a table in her room. She dreamed that this young man had had\na sudden hemorrhage and died instantly. She did not mention her dream to\nher son fearing it might trouble him, but after he had eaten his breakfast\nand was settled for the day, she sat down to read to him from her local home\npaper, and on opening it the first item she saw was one to the effect that this\nyoung man in Connecticut had died from a sudden hemorrhage just as she had\ndreamed. Mrs. E. F. related this to me that same day, bringing me the\npaper to keep for her where her son would not see it. He died soon after\nthis.\nMrs. [E.

F. herself writes on March 18th, 1891 :\u2014\nThe son of an old friend came West for his health, and, apparently much\nhelped, returned home some time before my own son's health began\nto fail. Building our hopes on doctor's advice, and what we thought\nColorado climate had done for that young man, we came out here.\nAbout six weeks after, I dreamed one night that young G. had suddenly had\na severe hemorrhage, ran right down and died in three or four days. So\nvivid was the dream that the grief of parents and only sister was deeply\nimpressed on my mind for a long time, even to peculiar expressions they\nused in speaking of his death. I wondered about it in the morning as I had\nnot corresponded with the family or heard about them from others since\nleaving home, but I was greatly startled, on getting my daily home paper\nin that morning's mail, to find a notice of the young man's death under\ncircumstances very similar to those of my dream. The mother's rebellion\nat her son's death was afterwards voiced to me in a letter, in language very\nlike that I dreamed of her using.\nI should be glad to see a copy of your Journal, and possibly, if you wish\nit, I may at some future day give you one or two other dreams I have had\nand which I should very much like to have satisfactorily explained.\nCATALOGUE OF UN PRINTED CASES.\n{Continued from the November Journal.)\nFurther information improving the evidence in any of these cases\nwill be gratefully received.\nB L 150.

Experimental Apparition (Additional Evidence about\ncase printed in the Journal for October, 1891, p. 134).\nSkiddy, Morris Co., Kansas, October 31st, 1891.\nI have been shown by my friend Dr. Wiltse the account in the last num\nber of S.P.R. Journal [October, 1891], of the Doctor's attempt to produce\napparition of himself, along with evidence of Mrs. Charles Skene, of Cleve\nland, Ohio. Will you allow me to correct her statement, which I do in the\ninterest of science ?\nMrs. Skene states that the Doctor said he wished \"to try an experiment\nwith the little boy.\" This is a mistake. I was in the house that evening\nand noticed the Doctor sitting near the door very quiet, and remember that\nsomeone asked him what he was doing, and that he told us not to disturb\nhim as he was thinking, but he said nothing as to the subject of his medita\ntions. The lady has evidently got matters confused with other occasions, as\nthe Doctor was almost daily trying experiments in his particular line. He\n\fMat, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 251\ntold me the next morning that he believed he had caused the boy's fright,\nand that if so it would come out after a few days and then he would tell\nme what experiment he had tried, but to get at the undoubted truth he\nmust not divulge it until the boy should tell what had scared him.\nSome days after this I was at the Doctor's house when the Doctor offered\nthe boy a present to tell him what had frightened him, which the boy bash\nfully refused to do, whereupon his sister (8 years old) said she knew, and\nproceeded to give the statement precisely as related by Dr. Wiltse in the\nJournal. Of course the error in Mrs. Skene's evidence is entirely uninten\ntional. She has simply got confused among the multiplicity of experiments\nshe witnessed at my friend's house, and in which as a general thing I think\nshe was not largely interested. But the mistake is rather unfortunate since\nit throws much doubt upon the Doctor's statement.\nBegging pardon for so long a voluntary trespass upon your valuable time\nfrom an entire stranger, and offering as excuse my hearty interest in the\nnoble work your Society is engaged upon, I subscribe myself\nT. Raseco.\n[The above letter to Mr. Hodgson is in the handwriting of Dr. Wiltse\nand signed by T. Raseco. ]\nL. 937. A\u00ab P3\nWe are permitted to print the dream which follows, translated from\nthe original letters in French. It will interest our readers as referring\nto the recent bereavement which Professor Richet has undergone. He\nhas prefixed a few words, giving the facts as to the last illness and\ndeath of his distinguished father.\nOn Saturday, December 2Gth, 1891, M. A. Richet, aged 70, at\nCarqueiranne, was seized with a violent bronchitis, which during the night of\nDecember 26th-27th led to violent agitation and some delirium. Next\nmorning telegrams were sent to M. Charles Richet and his other children in\nParis, saying that their father's illness, although not precisely dangerous, was,\nat his age, a serious one. M. Charles Richet at once started for Toulon, at\n7.15 p.m., December 27th. During the Sunday the patient's state grew\nworse ; and he expired at 1 p.m., December 30th.\nThe dream which follows is narrated by Professor Richet's cousin,\nMadame Vavin, who has already contributed a case to Phantasms of the\nLiving (Vol. II., p. 481).\nI was very anxious and troubled as to the health of an Aunt who is very\ndear to me ; and on the evening of December 26th-27th, 1891, I had received\na letter giving me very alarming news of this Aunt. I anticipated her\nimmediate death, and went to sleep in this state of mind. I then dreamt as\nfollows. I was present at a funeral, which seemed to belong to my family.\nI saw my brother in uniform and all my relations in mourning. I at first\nthought that this must be my Aunt's funeral ;\u2014yet my grief did not seem to\nme to be as great as I should have felt in such a case ; and I saw in the\ngroup before me my cousin, the grandchild and nearest relative of this Aunt,\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1892.\nin very slight mourning. Suddenly a voice seemed to whisper these words\nin my ear, ' ' This is not your Aunt's funeral, \u2014but the funeral of M. Richet,\nwho is about to die.\" At this moment I awoke.\nNext day my brother told me that M. Richet was ill, \u2014a fact of which I\nwas quite unaware. I then told my dream to him and to several other\npersons. Marguerite Vavin.\nThe following corroboration is from Madame Vavin's brother, above\nreferred to :\u2014\nThis is what I remember as to your dream. I had learnt from my Aunt\nde Rancy that my Uncle Richet was ill, and that Louise and Charles had\nreceived a telegram. On Sunday or Saturday evening I told you this, and\nyou replied that you had heard nothing of it. Then you repeated to me the\nstrange dream which you had dreamt on the previous night. It appears to\nme, then, that you had dreamt this dream before you knew anything of the\nillness of our Uncle. Paul.\nL. 938. A\u00b0 Pn\nThe following narrative was sent to Mr. Hodgson by Mr. William\nTudor :\u2014\nAuburndale, Mass., July 11th, 1890.\nYour favour of the 30th ult. , addressed to Mrs. Tudor, I will answer, as\nthe incident more directly concerned me.\nLate in the evening of Monday, March 17th, near midnight, my nephew,\nFrederic Tudor, Jun. , fell in front of an electric car going to Cambridge, was\ndragged some distance and so badly injured that for a time his life was in\ndoubt though he recovered with the loss of a foot. My wife heard of the\naccident on Tuesday afternoon and was much distressed all the night of\nTuesday and quite restless and wakeful.\nAt this time I was in Gainesville, Florida, having important business\nthere in connection with land purchases. On the night of Tuesday I went to\nbed rather early in a calm state of mind. I slept soundly, as I usually do.\nAbout midnight, as I should judge, I heard my wife call my name quite dis\ntinctly and waked instantly broad awake. I sat up in bed, but soon\nremembering where I was fell asleep again and waked no more until\nmorning. The next day the incident of the night made me quite uneasy,\nalso during the following day, and as I was obliged to leave on the afternoon\nof Friday for a rough journey in the country I telegraphed to my wife to\nknow what was the matter. I usually receive a letter from home every day\nand on these days no letter arrived, which added to my uneasiness. No\nanswer was received to my first telegram for the very good reason that it was\nnever delivered. I was obliged to start, however, in the afternoon of this day,\nFriday the twenty-first, and in the morning of the 22nd, from a small town\ncalled New Branford, sent another telegram, of which the following is the\nsubstance:\u2014\"Shall be gone three days, what has happened? Answer\nBranford.\" I had a strong impression that something serious had occurred,\nthat my wife was possibly ill, or some of the children were ill, or that some\n\fMay, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 253\naccident or death had occurred to a near relation, not however involving my\nimmediate family. The following extracts from my letters will illustrate\nthis feeling.\nLetter of March 19th :\n\" I thought you called me last night. I waked up and was much worried,\nI hope you are not ill.\"\nLetter of March 22nd, from New Branford :\n\" No answer comes to my telegram although I left word to have it for\nwarded here.\" \" Surely someone would telegraph if you were ill. Surely\nyou would let me know if anything had happened. I do not feel that anything\nserious has happened and yet I cannot understand such a combination of\ncircumstances.\" \"I have no confidence in these telegraph people and\ndaresay you never received my message.\"\nLetter of March 24th, from Gainesville, after telegram giving account of\naccident was finally received :\n\"I had a feeling that something was wrong but that you were all right.\"\nSuch I give as the substance of the facts in this case, which I trust may be\ninteresting to the Society. William Tudor.\nMrs. W. Tudor writes :\u2014\nAuburndale, July 29th, 1890.\nMy nephew's accident occurred on Monday night. Being out of town I\nheard of it on Tuesday afternoon. I immediately went to Boston and\nreturned the same evening about nine o'clock, feeling greatly distressed. I\nwrote a letter to my husband after my return describing the accident and\nretired to bed rather late and passed a restless night. The telegram\nreceived from my husband rather surprised me as he is not usually anxious\nwhen away from home. I believe this is all I know connected with this\nincident. Elizabeth Tudor.\nL. 939. Thought-transference 1\nThe following case, recorded, it will be observed, on the day of its\noccurrence, is of undoubted psychological interest. If it is not a case\nof thought-transference from Miss C. to Mrs. Luther we must assume\nthat a very remarkable recrudescence of latent memory occurred to\nthe latter independently, at the same time that a similar though less\nremarkable revival of memory occurred to the former.\nHartford, Conn., March 2nd, 1892.\nI send you herewith the account of a series of incidents which seem to\nme worthy of record by students of Psychology. There is little or nothing\nto be added to the bare narrative, perhaps, yet I may be permitted to point\nout that the peculiarity of this occurrence lies in its illustration of uncon\nscious or unintentional thought-transference. Miss C. is often in my study\nand consults my books freely, so that her dream was not remarkable. The\ndream of Mrs. L. (my wife) was also ordinary in character. The coincidence\nin time of the dreams may have been merely a coincidence. But that after\nthese occurrences Mrs. L. should suddenly, without the least premeditation\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mai, 1892.\nand without hesitation, take the right book and open it at the right page with\nthe certainty of a somnambulist, seems to me strange.\nIf I am mistaken in supposing that the matter is one of some interest I\ntrust you will pardon my intrusion upon your attention.\nF. S. Luther\n(Prof. Math., Trinity College).\nThese events took place yesterday, last night, and this morning.\nF. S. L.\nMrs. L. and Miss C. live at the same hotel and meet daily. Miss C. is\nengaged in writing an essay upon Emerson, and expresses to Mrs. L. her\nwish to obtain some particulars as to Emerson's private life. Mrs. L. regrets\nthat she has no book treating of the subject. During the night following\nthis conversation Mrs. L. dreams of handing Miss C. a book containing an\narticle such as is desired, and Miss C. dreams of telling Mrs. L. that she had\nprocured just the information which she had been looking for. Each lady\nrelates to the other her dream when they meet at breakfast the next morning.\nMrs. L. returns to her room, and, while certainly not consciously thinking of\nEmerson, suddenly finds in her mind the thought, \" There is the book which\nMiss C. needs.\" She goes directly to a bookcase, takes down Vol. 17 of the\nCentury Magazine, and opens immed lately at the article, \"The Homes and\nHaunts of Emerson. \" Mrs. L. had undoubtedly read this article in 1879,\nbut she had never studied Emerson or his works, nor had she made any\nspecial effort to assist Miss C. in her search, though feeling a friend's interest\nin the proposed essay. '\nAfter receiving the book and hearing how it was selected, Miss C. relates\nher dream more fully, it appearing that she had seemed to be standing in\nfront of Mrs. L. 's shelves with a large, illustrated book in her hands, and\nthat in the book was something about Emerson.\nStill later it is found that Miss C. had actually noticed the article in\nquestion while actually in the position reproduced in her dream.

Sackett, practical phrenologist and lecturer,\nof Sycamore, Illinois. He published it in the Phrenological Journal,\n\fMay, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 255\nwhence it was copied into the- Religio-Pliilosophical Journal for\nFebruary 14th, 1891, and Mr. Hodgson has since corresponded with him\nabout it.\nIn the September number of the Journal you call attention to Professor\nWilliam James's inquiries regarding hallucinations. I herewith enclose a\nstatement of my experience : ' ' About eight years ago I was delivering some\nlectures on phrenology in a school-house at Little Rock, I11. My audience\nconsisted of over one hundred adults besides a goodly number of children.\nThe school-room had but one entrance, opening from the centre of the east\nside of the room into a hallway about twelve feet long, at the east end of\nwhich was the outside door. My pictures were hanging on the east wall of\nthe room, above and on each side of the door. There was a space of from\ntwelve to fifteen feet between the door and the first row of seats, extending\nthe full width of the room with the exception of the space occupied by the\nteacher's desk on the left, and by a stove on the right of the entrance.\n' ' One evening, after I had been speaking for half an hour or more, and\nwhile fully enthused with my subject and speaking rapidly, I felt a hand laid\non my shoulder and the clasp of fingers and thumb very distinctly. In much\nsurprise I turned to see who had entered through two closed doors and\ntraversed the hallway so quietly as not to be heard. To my greater surprise\nI saw no one behind me ; the door was closed, and I was the only visible\noccupant of the space above described. I recovered quickly from the shock\nit gave me and resumed my address to the audience, but not before they had\nnoticed that something unusual was affecting me. After the lecture I gave\ntwo delineations of character.\n\" The first subject was a man about sixty years of age, an entire stranger\nto me, who, as I afterward learned, was a resident physician. While he was\nwalking from his seat in the audience to the chair placed for him, I\nremarked, ' If there is any person in this community who is fond of flowers\nand loves to cultivate them this is the one.' I had no more than said it\nbefore I would have given the night's receipts at the door to have recalled\nthe remark. I felt thoroughly vexed with myself for impulsively saying\nwhat my better judgment condemned as a foolish remark. However, I used\nboth tape and callipers and gave quite an extended delineation of his\ncharacter, and must have made some ' good hits,' as the audience frequently\napplauded, and I hoped that they would forget my remark about the flowers.\n\"But judge of my surprise when, after the audience was dismissed, a\nlady approached me and asked how I could tell by the doctor's phrenology\nthat he was passionately fond of flowers ? She informed me that flowers\nwere 'his hobby,' and that he was the only person in the village who culti\nvated a flower garden. I now felt better over my blunder, for it was the\nluckiest ' hit ' I had made that evening. I had no acquaintance in the\nvillage and stopped at another town seven miles away, and consequently\nhad no knowledge of the doctor or his flower garden.\n\" Nothing strange or unusual in all this ? No. But the strange part is\nyet to come. I continued to lecture all that winter and the following fall\nand winter, and the incident of the hand on my shoulder, the flower\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, i^92.\nincident, and even the lecture itself had faded from my mind, and would\nprobably never have been recalled for serious consideration had I not paid a\nsecond visit to Mrs. Leonard Howard, a noted clairvoyant of St. Charles,\nI11. My first visit to her had occurred about three years before, at which\ntime I was intensely sceptical as to the truth of clairvoyance. In my first\ninterview she told me of facts and incidents relating to my father's family,\nwhich I denied. She then told me what I thought were the facts, and told\nme also that my father would corroborate her statements when I saw him,\nwhich he did. She told me that I would succeed at phrenology, and advised\nme to quit my present business (photography) and try it. I gave her no\ninformation of myself, and all her statements were volunteered. I was a\nperfect stranger to her, and yet while in a trance she seemed possessed of a\nfund of knowledge of myself and people far greater than mine or theirs.\nShe advised me to try lecturing on phrenology, as I could do much good in\nthat field, saying she would help me, a statement which at the time seemed\npreposterous.\n\"Perhaps, for the better understanding of what follows, it may be\nnecessary to state that Mrs. Howard claimed to be controlled while in a\ntrance by the spirit of an old Indian doctor, and used the dialect Indians\nuse in attempting to speak the English language. The ' doctor ' told me he\nshould remember me, and would know me wherever and whenever he saw\nme, if it was not in many years. Mrs. Howard was at that time over\nseventy years of age, and her memory quite poor.\n\" At my second interview Mrs. Howard did not appear to know me, or\nhave any recollection that she had ever seen me. But after she had entered\nthe trance state, she greeted me with, 'Hello, Injun, me taut you come agin\nsome time. ' She, or perhaps it would be more proper to say, the ' doctor '\n(for Mrs. Howard had no recollection of what occurred while in her trance),\nrecalled much that he had said to me on my former visit, and asked if my\nfather did not corroborate all his statements at that time. He told me that\nI liked to make pictures better than I did when I was there before, as the\nnew way was easier. (I had adopted the dry plate process since my former\nvisit.) He told me I had lectured and succeeded as he told me I would.\nWe were sitting facing each other, when Mrs. Howard placed her hand on\nmy knee, and clasping it with a light pressure while a merry look came over\nher face, said : ' Say, Injun, why you so 'fraid when I put hand on you\nshoulder in dat ole school-house where funny old doctor like flowers so 1 '\nTo say that I was astonished does not express my feelings, for the thought\nthat I might possibly get a solution to the hallucination of the hand on my\nshoulder, and comprehend why I should make such an unfounded assertion\nas to the doctor being passionately fond of flowers, made me anxious to ask\nmany questions ; but I was given no opportunity, for the medium con\ntinued : ' Didn't me tell you me help you if you go 'round make heap talk\nand feel heads ? Injun, me made you tell ole doctor him like flowers, 'fore\nhe got to chair ; how much you gib dat night if hadn't said it, hey ? Injun,\nme put hand on you shoulder dat night ; yip, me dare ; see all dem folks\nand dat funny ole doctor\u2014all dem picturs on wall, and skulls, and dat white\nhead (bust) on table. '\n\fMay, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 257\n\" 'Well, if you were there why did you not speak to me, so I should\nhave known you 1 ' I inquired.\n\" ' 'Umph 1 me couldn't do dat\u2014didn't hab my mejum, Mrs. Howard,\ndare. Me dare ; see eberyting dare too.'\n\"The medium told me much more, and tried to explain something of\nthe philosophy of clairvoyance ; but could not explain to my satisfaction how\nthe hallucination of the hand on my shoulder was produced, or why I was\nimpelled to tell the audience the doctor was passionately fond of flowers.\n\"The impression was so strong in my mind, it 'said itself.' But\nwhether it was an impression received directly from the subject by\npsychometry, or whether (as Swedenborg would express it) it was injected\ninto my mind by an influx from a ' spirit,' I am unable to say. The in\ncidents actually occurred, and so long as I cannot account for them by any\nlaw familiar to myself, it is, perhaps, but fair to give the clairvoyant the\nbenefit of the doubt, and accept the Indian ' doctor's ' statement that he pro\nduced them as the true solution, even though we do not comprehend the\nphilosophy of the law by which they were produced.\n\"In conclusion, I wish to say that Mrs. Howard resided at St. Charles\nfrom the time that part of Illinois was settled, and until her recent death\nalways commanded the respect of all who knew her, no matter what their\nreligious belief might be. She never advertised herself as a medium, but\nwas visited by people of all shades of belief.\"\nMr. Sackett writes to Mr. Hodgson on February 26th, 1891 :\u2014\n* * * * *\nAt the time the \"experience\" occurred, I had no thoughts of Mrs.\nHoward, nor did I ever think of her in connection with the phenomena\nprevious to my second interview with her. I have given a great many\nlectures since, but have never experienced anything like the touch of a hand.\nI have many times felt impelled to tell those who have come under my hands\nfor examination of some special trait of character, of which phrenology gave\nme no clue, and have always found what I term my \" intuitive impressions \"\na safe guide, but whether the \"impressions \" originate with me or not, I am\nnot prepared to say.\nI had never thought of ascribing them to a decarnate spirit previous to\nmy second visit to Mrs. Howard, nor am I willing to do so now without\nmore proof. I confess the question is an open one with me, and I am\ndesirous of more light.\nWhen I receive the Doctor's address I will forward it to you with a\nrelation of another strange experience in which the sense of sight instead of\nfeeling was hallucinated (if there is any \" hallucination \" about it).\nDe L. Sackett.\nThe next letter is from Mrs. George Mason, of Sandwich, De Kalb\nCo., Illinois, to Mr. Hodgson.\nHinckley, March 10th, 1891.\nIt has been some years since the circumstance happened you allude to in\nyour letter.\nMr. De L. Sackett gave a lecture at the Little Bock School-house,\n\f258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1892.\nupon phrenology. The audience, I think, sent up .in old gentleman (or he\nvolunteered, I could not say which) to have his head examined. He (Sackett)\nwas standing near the door and the doctor was sitting. Before he had\nmeasured the doctor's head he turned towards the door as if someone had\nspoken to him, or touched him, and he immediately said, \"This man is\npassionately fond of flowers. \" After the lecture I asked Mr. Sackett how\nhe knew that the doctor was fond of flowers, as that was his \" hobby,\" and\nhad a yard full of very choice and beautiful flowers in their season. As I\nknew the doctor was a perfect stranger to Mr. Sackett it seemed very strange\nto me.\nThe old gentleman is living in Piano, Kendall Co., I11. His name is Dr.\nJohn Brady, an old Quaker.\nMr. Hodgson has written twice to Dr. Brady but has received no\nreply.\nThe other experience referred to by Mr. Sackett was that of seeing\na hallucinatory child's hand resting on that of his sleeping brother,\nby whose bedside Mr. Sackett was watching a few days before his\ndeath in 1887. The account of this is confirmed by his sister and\nsister-in-law. We do not quote the case in full, as it does not appear\nto have been either coincidental or collective.\nL. 940. Ad Ps or Borderland.\nFrom Mrs. Beard.\nThe following is a curious instance of an impression coinciding with\nthe death of a person entirely unknown to the percipient. It may be,\nof course, a mere coincidence, but it belongs to a group of cases of\nwhich several instances are given in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II.,\np. 365, and which \" recall,\" as Mr. Gurney remarks, \" the Greek notion\nof (j)rjM\u2014the rumour which spreads from some unknown source, and far\noutstrips all known means of transport.\"\nMay 21d, 1891.\nAbout 5 a.m. on the 27th January I awoke, saying aloud, \"Earl Howe\nof Gopsal, Earl Howe of Gopsal.\" The sound of my voice made me\nstart up and wonder why the name of Gopsal should come into a dream, as\nmy one recollection of the place was connected with a visit to it so long ago\nas the reign of William IV., when his Queen, Adelaide, stayed there, and\nher state rooms were thrown open to the public. On Wednesday, the 28th,\nor Thursday, the 29th January\u2014I cannot refer to the paper now\u2014I opened\nthe Times, and almost the first paragraph which caught my eye announced\nthe death at 5 a.m., on Tuesday, the 27th, at Cannes, I think, of a son of\nthe Earl Howe of my childhood, whose body was, the paragraph said, to be\nbrought to Gopsal for burial. I told the coincidence to my daughter, but did\nnot mention it again for some time. I cannot recall any thought of Gopsal\ncoming into my mind of late years. When travelling to London, as I did, for\n\fMay, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 259\ninstance, on the 5th of last January, I always look out for the spire of my\nnative Leicestershire town, Hinckley, but am sure no recollection connected\nwith Gopsal was with me. Mary Ellen Beaed.\nOwing to a mistake this letter was not received by us at the time it\nwas written, and it was not till November, 1891, that we had any\nfurther correspondence about it. In answer to our inquiries, Mrs.\nBeard then wrote :\u2014\nI have no means of knowing that the dream and the death coincided\nbeyond the fact that as soon as I had convinced myself of the exactness of\nthe date and hour, I went to my daughter, who was also at Mr. D.'s, and told\nher of it and made her read the paragraph. And as I had only a day or so\nbefore arrived at Mr. D.'s, there was no possibility of mistake as to what had\noccurred to me in a fresh bedroom only the previous morning. The speaking\nmade me wide awake in a moment and I sat up questioning myself as to what\ncould have caused Gopsal to come thus into my brain. And I could not\nforget so singular an occurrence, or the time of it. I did not \" believe \" it,\nI knew it. There was no recollection of any dream preceding the calling\nout the words, which made me think at the time more of the sudden call\nthan I should have done had it been the end or part of a dream.\nI cannot, after the lapse of 10 months, say with certainty whether I\nspoke of my sudden awakening and speaking aloud to my daughter, who was\nat Oxford, though not sleeping with me when it happened. My daughter has\na strong belief that I told her at once, but would not like now to assert this.\nBut on reading the Times paragraph early the next day, my first idea was not\nthat of anything singular so much as of a mistake in my reading of the date\nand hour. And I read and re-read several times before convincing myself\nthat the facts in the paper so exactly agreed with my experience. Perhaps\nI ought to say that during many long periods of nursing the sick, I have\ntried to know the hours of the night by my feeling of the time passed, finding\nthe habit useful in many ways, and that I now carry on the practice, first\nguessing the time and then verifying it by my watch. So that there is no\ndoubt as to the time, any more than the date, of my awaking at Oxford.\nGopsal was within a long drive of Hinckley in Leicestershire, where I was\nborn, and where I lived till 19 yeara old. Beyond a visit of a few hours to\nGopsal when a little child of 9, I have never seen it, nor, so far as my\nmemory serves me, heard of it. I recollect the name and the place coming\nfor a moment into my mind when passing by railway through Leicestershire,\nabout a year before last January, but it did not dwell there, and was only\nrecalled when the occurrence of last January caused me to wonder why I\nawoke speaking of Gopsal. I do not see the Times or any London paper\nregularly, so can only say that no notice of any illness of Earl Howe's son\never came under my eye. I did not even know that Earl Howe had a son.\nI had no recollection of him or of anyone belonging to him.\nIn the Times of Thursday, January 29th, 1891, we find under\nobituary notices :\u2014\nWe regret to announce the death at half-past 5 on Tuesday last at his\nhouse in South Eaton Place, of General the Hon.

BALL AND BOETEAU'S CASE OF DOUBLE\nPERSONALITY.\nThe following case of \" Automatisme Somnambulique avec dedoublement\nde la personnalite' \" is reported by J. M. Boeteau, Interne des Asiles de la\nSeine, in the Antudes Medico-psycholoyupies for January, 1892. It will interest\nour readers from its analogy to the Ansell Bourne case, insomuch as the lost\nmemory of an escapade is recovered under hypnotisation. It differs from\nAnsell Bourne's case in the presence of marked hysteria. There seems to be\nno suspicion of epilepsy. I abbreviate M. Boeteau's very full and clear\naccount.\nMarie M., now aged 22, has been subject to hysterical attacks since she\nwas twelve years old. She became an out-patient at the Hopital Andral for\nthese attacks ; and on April 24th, 1891, the house-physician there advised her\nto enter the surgical ward at the Hotel-Dieu, as she would probably need\nan operation for an internal trouble. Greatly shocked by this news, she left\nthe hospital at 10 a.m., and lost consciousness. When she recovered con\nsciousness, she found herself in quite another hospital, \u2014that of Ste. Anne,\u2014\nat 6 a.m. on April 27th. She had been found wandering in the streets of Paris,\nwith haggard aspect, worn-out boots, and lacerated feet, in the. evening of the\nday on which she left the Hopital Andral, under the shock of painful appre\nhension. On returning to herself, she could recollect absolutely nothing of\nwhat had passed in the interval. While she was thus perplexed at her\nunexplained fatigue and footsoreness, and at the gap in her memory, M.\nBoeteau hypnotised her. Like Ansell Bourne, she passed with ease into the\nhypnotic state, although she had never before been hypnotised ;\u2014and like\nhim she at once remembered the events which filled at least the earlier part\nof the gap in her primary consciousness.\nIt appears that when she left the Hopital Andral she set out at first for\nthe Hotel-Dieu, as recommended ; but that the horror of the impending\noperation upset her balance of mind, and suddenly transformed itself into a\nconviction that her baby, which had died at the Assistance Publique, was\nbeing kept from her by the nurse to whom she had entrusted it at Chaville.\nShe had walked to Chaville, and then on to Versailles, whither the nurse\nhad removed. She could learn nothing of her baby, and walked back to\nParis. During this long walk, which wore out her boots and wounded her\nfeet, she was insensible to fatigue or hunger. But on regaining Paris she\n\fMay, 1892.] Journal of Society for Pyschical Research. 261\nbegan to be haunted by spectral surgeons, endeavouring to perform operations\non her. She was found in an increasing state of maniacal excitation, and\nwas taken to a police infirmary on the 25th and to the Hospital of Ste.\nAnne on the 26th April.\nThe patient's account of her adventures was found to be correct. The\nnovel point here is the recovery by hypnotism of the memory of a state\nresembling a sudden access of mania. There seems to have been some frag\nmentary recollection of the primary state during the secondary state, inas\nmuch as the poor woman recollected the fact that she had a baby, and the\nname and address of the nurse. But there was so little of such memory that\nDr. Boeteau feels justified in saying that \"for a time she had had a real mental\nlifo differing from the normal life, with a recurrence to her normal life after\nthree days ; thus presenting a clear example of alternating and divided\npersonality, with complete separation between the two psychical existences.\"\nOne further point should be noted. If the patient is hypnotised and told\nto write the day of the month, she writes April 25th, 1891. This is one of the\ndays during her fugue\u2014the day, as it appears, on which she sank from\ncoherent into incoherent delirium. It thus appears that some kind of\nsecondary personality, identified with the earlier part of the fugue, still\nexists subliminally, although the patient has apparently quite recovered her\nmental balance. F. W. H. M.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nA SUGGESTED METHOD OF SEI.F-HYPNOTISATION.\nTo the. Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nDear Sir,\u2014Mr. Myers' fascinating paper on the Subliminal Conscious\nness (Proceedings, February, 1892) must have aroused in many of its readers\na desire to re-mould themselves \"nearer to the heart's desire,\" and to\nexploit the hidden vein of genius which each of us is now entitled to believe\nto be lurking in the depths of his being, beneath his surface self. But, un\nfortunately, the only methods yet devised for getting at the subliminal self\ninvolve a recourse to external hypnotisation, and, rightly or wrongly, a great\nmany of us have an unconquerable aversion to putting themselves, to an un\nknown extent, into the power of any hypnotic operator. Hence it may not\nbe out of place to indicate a method whereby some of us, at all events, may\nattain the practical benefits of such a psychical reconstruction. It would\napply primarily to those who are able to communicate with their subliminal\nstrata by means of automatic writing. Let such a person inquire of his sub\nliminal correspondents whether they can put him into the trance state. If\nthey affirm this and the trance ensues, we shall have a most interesting con\nfirmation of the view that at bottom all hypnotisation is self-hypnotisation.\nAnd once the hypnotic trance has been evoked, the rest is easy. The supra\nliminal self then can propose any desired suggestions to the automatically\nwriting self in its normal state, which, when assented to by the latter, may\nbe reimposed upon the supraliminal self as hypnotic suggestions in the trance\nstate. Of course the duration of the trance should always be limited by\nprevious arrangement with the subliminal self, and, if successful, I can see no\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mat, 1892.\nreason why such experiments should not be entirely beneficial in practice, as\nwell as highly instructive in theory. But perhaps Mr. Myers may have some\nthing to say on the subject. C.

There were also present : Professor W. F. Barrett, Dr. A.\nT. Myers, and Messrs. W. Leaf, F. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, S. C.\nScott, and R. Pearsall Smith.\nEleven new Associates were elected. The election of one new\nMember, and thirteen new Associates of the American Branch was\nrecorded. Names and addresses are given above.\nAt his request the name of the Rev. George Nelson was transferred\nfrom the list of Members to that of Associates.\nSome presents to the Library were reported which were directed to\nlai duly acknowledged.\nSeveral other matters of business having been disposed of, it was\nresolved that the next Meeting of the Council should be on Friday,\nJuly 1st, at 4.30 p.m., at 19, Buckingham-street.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 53rd General Meeting was held at the Westminster Town Hall\non Friday, May 27th, at 8.30 p.m., The President in the chair.\nA paper by Mrs. Sidowick about some further experiments in\nthought-transference was read by Mr. Myers. The paper contained an\naccount of the successful transference of double numbers when the\nagent (Mr. G. A. Smith) and the percipient were in separate rooms\nwith the door closed ; and also of the successful transference of mental\npictures thought of by the agent, no actual pictures being there.\nThese pictures were sometimes transferred to the percipient as pictures\non a blank card and sometimes were seen with closed eyes. They often\npresented interesting features of development. The paper, with more\ndetail than was given at the meeting, will it is hoped appear in a future\nnumlicr of the Proceedings.\nPortions of a paper by Dr. Hodoson on the late \" Mr. Davey's\nImitations by Conjuring of Phenomena sometimes attributed to Spirit\nAgency \" were then read by Mr. Myers. This paper was written in\nreply to a challenge by Mr. A, R. Wallace (see Journal for March,\n\fJcne, 1s02.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 267\n1891, p. 43), who said of Mr. Davey's experiments described in\nProceedings, Vol. IV. :\u2014 \"They are claimed to be all trick and unless\nall can be so explained many of us will be confirmed in our belief that\nMr. Davey was really a medium as well as a conjurer, and that in\nimputing all his performances to ' trick ' he was deceiving the Society\nand the public.\" The methods used by Mr. Davey in producing writing\non slates believed by the sitters to be blank were described, together\nwith their application in particular cases ; and an account was given of\nthe way in which Mr. Davey, aided by Mr. Munro, produced the\nmaterialisation seance (described in Proceedings, Vol. IV.', pp. 482-485).\nThis paper will, it is hoped, be published in Proceedings, Part XXII.,\nto be issued in July.\nThe paper was followed by an interesting discussion, in the course\nof which several questions were asked and answered.\nMb. F. Podmore gave an account of an occasion when his brother\nsat with Mr. Davey, Mr. F. Podmore looking on, and writing was pro\nduced in a locked slate which, as Mr. A. Podmore believed, he had him\nself cleaned and afterwards continuously watched. Notwithstanding\nthis the slate was changed.\nMr. Pearsale Smith, admitting that he was one of the people who\nhad been entirely unable to account for what he saw with Mr. Davey,\ncommented on the illogical position taken up by those who will admit\nconjuring as an explanation when they know the trick, but when they\ncannot themselves explain how the phenomenon was produced assume\nthat it cannot be explained by conjuring. He concluded by describing\nand explaining how he himself had completely mystified a party of\npeople by causing a handkerchief to disappear from under a hat and\nto be found in a place selected by lot.\nMr. Munro further described the parts he and Mr. Davey had\ntaken in the materialisation seance, and dwelt on Mr. Davey's great\nskill in distracting the attention of the sitters from what he did not\nwish them to observe, and in guiding their impressions.\nMr. Hayes drew attention to the difficulty of devising conditions\nfor slate-writing experiments which would render conscious or uncon\nscious fraud impossible ; and suggested that, in addition to screwing\nthe slates together and sealing the screw heads, the edges of both\nslates should be plastered up with some composition (such as artists'\nwhite or other pigment) which, when once set could not be re-softened.\nThis method could be made to preclude access to the interior of the\nslates alike to the \" medium \" and the experimenter, and be a check\nagainst possible hypnotisation or somnambulism.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers remarked that he should be very sorry if this\ndiscussion left the impression either that any disparagement was\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1892.\nintended to Mr. Wallace, or that the working members of the Society\nconsidered that their duty with regard to the \" physical \" or \" tele-\nkinetic \" phenomena was limited to the exposure of fraud. It was\nneedless to express the obligation under which all our generation lay\nto Mr. Wallace, and if at times he seemed ready to adopt some\nwhat violent suppositions rather than attribute fraud to so-called\n\" mediums;1' it must be remembered that it was partly the generosity\nand simplicity of his own nature which made the work of a detective\nimpossible to him. Speaking for himself, Mr. Myers continued, he\nbelieved, with a belief at least strong enough to impel to action, that\nsuch phenomena as Mr. Davey simulated by conjuring did sometimes\noccur through agencies as yet unknown. But he considered that this\nwas a reason for gratitude to Mr. Davey, who had placed the conditions\nof inquiry on a securer basis, by demonstrating, more convincingly per\nhaps than anyone before him, how limited was the power of attention\nand observation which the ordinary man could bring to bear upon even\nthe apparently simplest phenomena. The proved existence of such\nlimitations might impose caution in dealing with persons who had\nobvious temptations to deceive, but it in no way lessened the importance\nof the inquiry itself. He wished that there were more experiments\nmade in private families with patience and care.\nProfessor Barrett heartily concurred in what Mr. Myers had\nsaid.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nG. 224. Collective. Auditory.\nThe following account was sent by Miss Newbold, an Associate of\nthe Society. It was enclosed in a letter elated May 7th, 1892 :\u2014\nFlorence N., a little child of under four years old, to whom I was very\nmuch attached, died on May 23rd, 1889. She lived in the house where I\nhave my studio, and during the daytime was invariably with me. There\nwere no other children in the house and she was a general pet. I was ill for\nsome time after her death, and one morning in July, 1889, I went to see\nMrs. N. We were sitting talking in her room on the ground floor when I\nsuddenly heard the child's voice distinctly call \"Miss Boo\" (her name for\nme). I was about to answer, when I remembered that it could be no living\nvoice and so continued my sentence, thinking that [ would say nothing about\nthe occurrence to her mother. At that moment Mrs. N. turned to me and\nsaid, \"Miss Newbold, did you hear that 1 \" \" Yes,\" I replied, \" what was it ? \"\nAnd she said, ' ' My little child, and she called ' Miss Boo. ' \" We both noticed\nthat the sound came from below, as if she were standing in the kitchen door\nway underneath the room in which we were sitting. There was no possi>\n\fJune, 1802.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 269\nbility of its being another child as there was not one in the house. The\nupper floors were empty, too, at the time. I can vouch for the accuracy of\nthis account. Annie Newbolh.\nMrs. N.'s Account.\nMiss Newbold came to see me one morning in July, 1889, about two\nmonths after my only child's death. We were in my room talking when I\ndistinctly heard my little girl's voice call \"Miss Boo.\" I asked Miss New-\nbold if she had hoard anything and she said, \"Yes. What was it?\" I\nreplied, \"My little child, and she said 'Miss Boo.' \" Lizzie N.\nIn answer to questions, Miss Newbold writes :\u2014\n1. Mrs. N. never heard her little girl's voice on any other occasion.\n2. We were not talking about the little girl at the time, nor upon any\nsubject connected with her. I, however, had a box of roses on my knee,\nwhich I was mechanically sorting and putting all the white ones on one side\nto send to the little child's grave.\n3. Mrs. N. has never heard any other voices, either before or since.\nNeither have I ; but I have three or four times in my life been conscious of\na presence without being able to explain definitely what it was I felt. I have\nnever seen anything.\nL. 941. A<> P\" Collective. Auditory.\nFrom Mr. A. J. Turrell, and countersigned by his father and\nmother bearing witness to the correctness of the facts stated.\nClifton Villa. Cavendish-road, Brondesbury, N.W.\nOctober 11th, 1891.\nAbout five years ago I was with a firm of insurance brokers in the City,\nand during that time had an accident happen to my hand. One day being\nat the office as usual I accidentally knocked the injured member, and with\nout thinking where I was I called out to my mother to bind my hand as was\nher custom when I was at home. I was naturally chaffed by my fellow\nclerks for some time, but on my return home the first question both my\nmother and father asked was, \" What did you come home this afternoon for\nat 3 o'clock 1 We distinctly heard you call out.\" That being, as far as I\ncan recollect, the exact time that I called out.\nI notice a question as to whether it is a common thing for my parents to\nhear voices (decidedly not), and if this experience is unique (certainly).\nA. J. Turrell.\n\/ Matilda Turrell.\nArthur Turrell.\nAs it did not seem quite certain from the above account that Mr.\nand Mrs. Turrell had both heard the voice, we asked Mr. G. A. Smith\nto call and if possible get an explicit statement on this point. The\nfollowing is his account :\u2014\nMay 31d, 1892.\nI called upon Mr. A. J. Turrell to-day at Brondesbury, but was not able\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [.Tusk, 1892.\nto see Mr. Turroll, senr., uncl Mrs. Turrell. Mr. A. J. Turrell assured me,\nhowever, that his voice was heard by both of his parents. On his return\nfrom business he went straight to the drawing-room where his parents were\nsitting, and they at once asked what had brought him home earlier in the\nafternoon. When he told them that he had not been home they seemed\nmuch puzzled, and t:ild him that they had both distinctly heard him call his\nmother's name, and thought he must have been in the house and gone again.\nThere was no other person in the house whose voice could have been mis\ntaken for Mr. A. J. Turrell's. They imagined he must be in the front pas\nsage or on the staircase, but they did not go out of the room to see ; they\nwaited for him to come in, and as he did not come they concluded there was\nnothing urgent and he would come at his leisure. Mr. A. .1. Turrell, still\nfeeling a little sore about the chaff he had endured in the City, could not\navoid thinking that this experience of his parents was in some way connected\nwith the incident, and he then related that he had good reason to remember\nthat he had actually called his mother about the time they heard his voice,\nbut that it was at the office, and not at home. They talked about the matter\na good deal at the time, and have often done so since ; and Mr. A. J.\nTurrell is quite certain tha1 whatever it was his parents heard there can be\nno doubt they both heard it. His fellow clerks are now scattered. The\nfirm failed, and Mr. Turrell being no longer connected with City life (he is\nnow, like his father, an artist), has completely lost sight of them. But he\nthinks if he could trace any of them they would not fail to remember his\ncalling out that afternoon, as it was for some time made a special joke\nagainst him. He has promised to try and find one of them at least.\nG. A. Smith.\nL. 952. Telepathic Clairvoyance.\nThe four narratives that follow are given by Mrs. MeCall Black.\nMrs. Black is a Spiritualist, and is personally known to Colonel Buntly\n(Editor of the Heliffio-l'hilonophical Journal).\nIt will be seen that most of the incidents described may be regarded\nas instances of telepathic clairvoyance, and taken together they seem\nto indicate the possession by Mrs. Black of a remarkable faculty. We\nhope that she will experiment, or at least in the future record her\nexperiences at the time they occur.\n(1) In order to make the story understandable, I must make some\nexplanations about a family. The German girl who lived with me came to this\ncountry to visit an aunt who was the second wife of a Mr. N., a Presby\nterian of good standing and a baker by profession. He had a daughter by\nhis first wife who was 'i young lady at the time of which I write. She felt a\nlittle disgraced (without cause) by herDcutsch cousin who \" worked out,\" and\nnover came to my house, but there were three or four of the aunt's children\nwho visited quite often. I was called to my mother's house to care for a\nsick sister and was there two weeks (I could tell funny experiences in\nrelieving sick people) excepting 30inc days I'd run home for a few minutes to\n\fJuxK, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 271\nsee how things got on at home. Before going to mother, I placed a little\nnickel chain purse (quite pretty and uncommon) in a little drawer on the\ndresser and left ten cents in it. When I returned home I went for my little\npurse. As I opened the drawer it was gone, and a vision\u2014day dream or what\n\u2014there stood by my side Mary N. and at the same time flashed the\nsentence \" She has your purse.\" I was startled first and pushed the drawer\nshut ; then indignant that such a thought of a lady I only knew by sight and\nnever heard anything bad of should come to me, but the vision haunted me.\nStill I said nothing. I did not like to speak of the matter to the girl for fear\nshe might feel I thought she took it, and I knew she was as innocent and\nhonest as the day was long. Later on in the day, I was sweeping the sitting-\nroom and she washing dishes when I carelessly said, \" Oh, Lena, if you see\nmy nickel purse anywhere around, I wish you'd give it to me,\" and she came,\nplate in hand startled and scared like, to the door between the rooms. \"Why,\nhave you lost something, Mrs. Black ? \" and I felt sorry and said, \"Oh no.\nNow if I never see that purse again, I don't want you ever to think I think\nyou took it, for I don't, \" and then, as if something made my tongue go and\nno thought in my head, I said, or it said, the words right out:\u2014 \"But\nMary N. has it.\" Well, I was more scared than the girl, and I sat down\nweak and trembling, and as I sat I saw a bedroom and a closet and a dress\nhanging in the closet and my purse in the pocket. I said, \"Lena, I don't\nknow what made me say that. I don't know what's the matter with me. Of\ncourse, I know Mary never comes here and she is a nico girl, and \" She\nbroke in : \" But she was here one night, Mrs. Black ; all the children were\nsick and aunt made her come.\" And I said, \" Is that so ? Well, you know I\nhave never been upstairs in your aunt's house (only once at the door), but\nas I sat down, I saw a bedroom and a closet in it and a dress hanging there\nand my purse in the pocket. Has Mary's room a closet in it 1 \" and she said,\n\" Yc3, it has. Please, Mrs. Black, can I go and see ? \" and I said, \" Yes. Don't\nstop for the dishes, but go now.\" She put on her things and went. I\nfinished the dishes and was sweeping the kitchen when she came in all\nexcited and out of breath. In one hand she held the purse, in the other a\npair of bracelets I hadn't missed. She said, \" Your purse had a dollar and\nten cents in it, but as you didn't say only ten cents in it I took the dollar\nand left it in the pocket, and these bracelets I knew were yours, so I brought\nthem ; and there was a nice piece of new lace in her pocket I thought was\nyours, but wasn't sure, so I left it. Mary was up town and they were right\nwhere you said.\" I said, \" Well, that's the funniest thing I ever heard of.\nI'll give you the bracelets for getting them\" (and did). \"I had a piece in\nthe handkerchief box where the bracelets were, I'll go and see if it is gone,\"\nand we both went upstairs and sure enough it was gone. She wanted to go\nright and get it, but I wouldn't let her. She wore the bracelets time and\nagain to the aunt's, but the cousin never said a word, nor Lena to her.\nLena told me she was frightened when I first spoke of the purse being gone\nbecause the half sisters had told hor that Mary had taken gloves and such\nthings out of stoves, but she had hardly believed it, and I had never heard of\nit. I always think of this with wonderment.\nMrs. C. McCall Black.\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jine, ls\u00bb2.\nIn reply to Dr. Hodgson's inquiries, Mrs. Kaiser, the \" Lena \" of\nthe above narrative, wrote :\u2014\nJersey City, August 2nd, 1891.\nDrab Sir, \u2014Having heard from Mrs. Black yesterday, I will no longer\nwait, but tell you what I remember of the strange experience of Mrs. Black,\nto which you and Sirs. B. have reference to.\nTen years ago I was working for Mrs. B. when she was called to stay\naway with a sick friend one night. Mrs. B. herself stopped at the house of\nfriends of mine, and asked the mother of the family, of which this one in\nquestion was a member, to let one of her daughters spend the night with me,\nas I was then quite a young girl and did not like to stay alone. Mrs. B., not\nknowing which of the five girls was with me, when missing these articles on\nher return, came to me and said, \" Mary N. has my things. Was she here\nduring my absence?\" when I told her, \"Yes, she came that evening to\nspend the night,\" and asked to go and get Mary's tmother to get these things\naway from her at once. I went and told her mother, as Mary happened to\nbo busy at something else. Her mother and sister went to her room and\nbrought to me the articles which they at once recognised as not Mary's pro\nperty. They even brought more than Mrs. B. had yet missed, a little purse,\na pair of coral bracelets, two pieces of lace, a baby hair brush and comb, and\nother things which I cannot mention any more. When I returned these\narticles to Mrs. B. she gave me the bracelets to keep. It did not take\nMary's mother and sister long to get the things, as I told them of the where\nabouts of the things, just as Mrs. B. had told me.\nMrs. B. certainly has a gift which not everyone has, and I well believed\nof some other similar circumstances she told mo then, for I lived with her\nnearly two years, and always found her to bo a lady in every sense of the\nword. Mum. August Kaisek.\nJuly 16th, 1891.\n(2) I don't remember that I told anyone of the circumstance, but I\nhad burglars, and by vision or dream got my things back, and as I have\nno way of proving up my story I'll only tell enough to make the letter\nunderstandable. I saw two fellows in my vision, one I knew by sight. In\ndirections given me (in my dream) I was to go to a brother (of the one I knew\nby sight) and tell him I knew the older one was in and what he had taken,\nand gave him so long to return the things. They were returned to me in\nperson by time. The other (the one this letter is from) I was to handle dif\nferently because of his revengefitl disposition (I don't know yet anything of\nhis disposition). If I did as directed I'd get the things. I consented (all in\nmy dream). Then I saw a letter before me, and then it was put in an\nenvelope and I saw the name in large black letters\u2014it was a name I had\nnever heard. I wrote the next day as I read in the letter of my dream and\ndirected and mailed, and he returned the things with the letter among them,\nwhich I now send you. The things he speaks of not having, I had already had\nreturned by the other party who was afraid I'd report him, and he ran away\nand has never returned. The chain he speaks of was a gentleman's watch\nchain, also a lady's opera chain, old style, about two yards long and a valu\nable chain. It is now made into small chains for myself and sister. He says\n\fJo.s-b, 1s92.] Journal of Societ;\/ for Psychical Research. 273\nhe wasn't in the house, \u2014maybo he wasn't, but I don't believe him\u2014for all\nthe rest of the vision was true, and I believe that ; or it might bo I saw him\nbecause he had some of the property. The keg he speaks of was a three\ngallon keg that had some home-made grape wine, which, till I got his letter,\nwas not missed. And I don't believe the other fellow would give him such\nvaluable things for his help to get the keg. He calls the other fellow a kid\nand himself a boy. They were both somewhere from 18 to 20\u2014this one fill\ning a man's place in . . . shop where he still was for some time after.\nIf I ever hear of the brother, I would ask his testimony, for I told him when\nhe returned the things I'd tell him how I knew. When the things were\nreturned by the mother (who is now dead) I told her all and she told me\nafterwards she had told her boys, but the old one ran away and I heard\n(don't know though) he was about to be hung in Texas for murder. The\nfather and the brother sold out and left here after the mother died. I sec by\nthe date of this letter that it was in 1882, and the theft was on Saturday\nnight before the date given in this letter. C. McCall Black.\nThe burglar to whom Mrs. Black wrote, replied as follows (Dr.\nHodgson has seen the letter) :\u2014.\nCanton, August 25th, 1882.\nMy Dear Mrs. , I can return said articles all but the watch which\nI never had nor even seen\u2014know nothing whatever about it. I retain\nnothing but two articles which I return at your request. And, Mrs. B ,\nI return my thanks, and I assure you you will never hear of me being in\nanother foolish doing as that. I was not in your house. The kid had the\nthings when he came to me, but went back with him to gate and he got a\nkeg. He gave me the chains. But, Mrs. B , you have made a man of\nme, and you can see what bad company does to a foolish boy. So, thanking\nyou thousands of times for the good you have done mo, I will bid you adieu.\nRobber.\n(3) Photograph Recognised from a Vision.\nCanton, I11., April 8th, 1891.\nSoma four years ago this spring I was visiting a friend at Farmington,\nMiss Macdonald. One morning, just as I was waking, I saw very distinctly a\nyoung lady, a strange face to me, but so plain I related it at the breakfast\ntable\u2014the arrangement of hair, dress, and earrings. Wo wondered who it\ncould be and why I saw it. That day, with this same friend, she called on an\nold lady who was boarding or living with a family in the country. While\nthere I picked up an album. I was startled to see the same young lady in\nthe album just as seen in the vision, only the earring in the picture had a\npendant and those in the vision only had the upper part. I showed Miss\nMacdonald, and we quietly talked of it. Upon asking who, where, and\nwhat, we found it to be a daughter of the family who had died the fall before.\nI asked did she always wear those earrings that way, and the mother said she\nnever wore the pendant only when that picture was taken, which, if I\nremember right, was taken only a short time before she sickened and died.\nAs usual, wo didn't say much to them, for they were opposed to any such\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, ism.\n[thing], and I think, too, my friend said I had Keen her in a vision and\nrecognised the picture. But she will tell her story.\nC. McCall Black.\nMiss Macdonalrl corroborates as follows :\u2014\nFarmington, I11., April 15th, 1891.\nMy friend, Mrs. Black, had driven up from Canton intending to spend\na short time with us, and it was agreed on the first evening of her arrival\nthat on the following day we Bhould drive out to pay a visit to an old lady\nfriend boarding in a family named Stevens, and living about four miles out\nin the country. When Mrs. Black came down to breakfast on the following\nmorning, she spoke of seeing the face of a young lady near her pillow upon\nawakening, and described her quite minutely. We none of us recognised her,\nhowever, and the subject was dropped for the time. When she and I had\narrived at our destination, and were comfortably seated with our old friend,\nMrs. Black took up an album, and in turning over the leaves came to a face\nwhich she instantly recognised as the one she had seen at her pillow that\nmorning.\nShe asked our old friend as to who it was, and she replied that it was a\ndaughter-in-law of the family and who had died some time before. The\nappearance of the face in the vision and that in the photograph was the\nsame, except that in the vision the earrings consisted of the upper part only,\nwhile in the photograph they had long pendants. This was accounted for\nby the fact which Mrs. Black elicited by a few questions, that she had never\nworn the pendants except when that picture was taken. Mrs. Black and I\ndiscussed the matter privately, but did not mention it to the family, as they\nwere not believers in such phenomena. This constitutes my knowledge of\nthe affair. F. Nellie Macdonalu.\nMiss Macdoiiiild writes later :\u2014\nMay 17th, 1891.\nI cannot say with certainty when the occurrence related in my former\nnote took place, but think it was in the latter part of the winter of 1885,\nI know that it was in the winter when the sleighing was nearly at an end.\n(4) Death Foretold.\nOn Monday eveningof second week in September, 1885, I boarded the steam -\nship Hamonia, in company with an aunt and my little son from Le Havre,\nFrance \u2014 a German ship. It was storming when we left, and stormed all the\nvoyage till the last three or four days. Thursday morning of our first week out,\nI related a dream which I had through the night and whioh was this : It\nseemed there was a funeral going on in the night and I saw it, and I followed\nthe party, three or four men, up on deck, and there saw them slide the body\noff a board into the water. As I turned to go back, a form in a long black robe\noame before mo, which I felt, without an introduction, was Death, and it said,\n\"I'll claim another before you land\u2014follow me, and I will show you where.\"\nI followed down the stairs around the aislo, and as it neared my own room my\nheart stood still, for my little boy had been deathly sick all the time. But it\npassed our door ; then I breathed more easy and followed on and on till we\n\fJuse, is:)2.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 27o\nwere near the front of ship on the left-hand side, as we faced the front.\nIt stopped before a room and the door opened, and there on a couch was a\nbody covered with a sheet down to the knees ; from there down I could see\nthe pant legs and boots of a man. My aunt was dressed by this time and\nwent out. In a few moments she came back excited and said, \"There \u00ab\u00abs\na funeral last night. Do you remember hearing a child cry so the first two\ndays out ! It died last night, about six or seven, and was buried at midnight\nby the officers.\" It was from the steerage passengers. We both looked\namazed, and I said, \" Let's watch now for the other, it's a man on this side\nof the ship.\" Time ran on\u2014oh so stormy I We should have landed the next\nweek Thursday, but did not till the following Saturday (either the 16th or\n17th of September, I have books packed which would give me the exact\ndate). The day before landing, Friday, was beautiful and bright, and every\nbody was on deck. I had been thinking of my dream and the other death,\nand asked the steward if anyone was sick, and he said : \" No, everybody is\nwell.\" My aunt had done the same, for as we sat on deck she said : \"I\nguess we won't have the other death. I asked one of the waiters if anybody\nwas sick, and they said, ' No.' \" I said I had, too. We were called to lunch\nand were just coming back on deck when it was announced the doctor of the\nship was dead. It was laughed at by several who had seen and talked with\nhim in the morning, but I felt it was so. My aunt came running with the\nnews. They had gone to call the doctor to lunch and found him sitting in\nhis chair, dead. My aunt said : \" Do you know where his room is 1 \" I said,\n\"No, do you 1 \" She answered, \"No,\" but said : \" Let's go and see if it is\nwhere you said,\" and we did so. When I got to the place, I said : \" Here\nis the place.\" But there was no name on the door. (The officers' rooms\nalways had their name on the door.) I said : \" Well, let's go and look on the\nother side.\" We did so, and there met the stewardess and asked where was\nthe doctor's room, and she said, \" Just on the other side, about opposite, but\nyou will see there are two rooms, one over the other\u2014his is the upper one,\nbeing nearer and opening handy to the hospital.\" And we went back, and\nit was where the dream located it, only it was the upper room instead of\nthe one that the door opened from the passage-way.\nC. McCall Black.\nMrs. Black's aunt writes ; \u2014\n[Received April 11th, 1891.\u2014R. H.]\nCanton, 111.\nThis is to certify that on September 1st, 1885, I came from Germany on\nsteamship Hamonia, and my niece, Carrie McCall Black, was one of the\ncompany. One morning, after being out two or three days, and while\ndressing for breakfast, she said : \" I had a funny dream last night,\" and then\nrelated that it seemed a funeral was going on board of ship in the night. She\nsaw them and followed it up on deck and saw them slide the baby overboard.\nThen a figure she called Death said to her: \"There will bo another one\ncalled before landing. Follow me, and I'll show you where.\" And she\nfollowed through the ship till it stoppod at a door, on one side of the ship,\nnear the front of the ship. The door opened and there lay a body covered\nwith a shoot down to the knoes ; from there she saw the pant legs and boots\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Juse, isy2.\nof ,1 man. I was the first out of our room and was out but a few minutes\ntill I heard a child had been buried at sea during the night from the steerage.\nI hastened to our room and said to my niece : \"There was a funeral last night.\nThat child we heard cry the first two days out died last night at six and\nburied at midnight.\" We were both surprised, but expected then there\nmight be another. A week or more afterward, on Friday morning, the\nweather was clear, and everybody well. We had a stormy passage. My\nniece and I both thinking of the dream had asked officers if anyone was\nsick, and \" All well \" was the answer, and would land Saturday in New York.\nWe had just returned from lunch, on dock again, when the word came the\ndoctor of the ship was dead. They had gone to call him to lunch, and he\nwas sitting in his chair, dead. I asked my niece if she knew where his room\nwas and she said \" No,\" and returned the question to me, and I said, \"No.\nLet's go look if it is where you located it in the dream,\" and we went. When\nwe got to the place, she said, \" Right here,\" but there was no name on the\ndoor (the officers' rooms all had their names on the door). She said, \" Well,\nlet's go look on the other side,\" and we did, and there met a stewardess, and\nasked where was the doctor's room. She said, \" On the other side, near the\nfront, and you will find one room over the other, his is the upper room to be\nnearer the hospital.\" And we went back, and it was where the dream had\nlocated it, only it was the upper room instead of the one right off the aisle\nor passage. Mrs. Grace Hornstein.\nMrs. Black also describes a premonitory dream which she had in\nJanuary, 1891, of finding herself officiating as a trance speaker at a\nSpiritualist funeral, which she had never done before. Owing to an\nunexpected death and a difficulty in getting anyone else to take the\nservice Mrs. Black actually officiated a few days later, and all occurred\nas in the dream.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nL. 928 (continued).\nThe following two series of experiments by Mrs. Shield deserve\nrecording in connection with those printed in the Journal for January,\n1892, and in the Journal for December, 1887.

Sidgwick.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nSUBLIMINAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE LAPSE OP TIME.\nTo the Editor of the Journal ok the Society for Psychical Research.\nSydney, N.S.W., April Wth, 1892.\nDear Sir,\u2014I have boon reading with intense interest Mr. F. Myers's\npaper on \" The Subliminal Consciousness \" in the February number of the\nProceedings. It suggests to me a very probable solution of a difficulty which\nhas often puzzled me. Why should some people, whose consciousness of\nthe lapse of time during their waking hours is no more exact than their\nneighbours, be able to awake at the exact moment of time which they\nimpressed on their own minds before falling asleep '! If, as Mr. Myers\nsuggests, in normal sleep we have \"the truest analogy to hypnotic trance,\"\nthen it seems very probable that the carrying out of the self-suggestion to\nawake from sleep at a given hour, and the performance of a \"post-hypnotic\"\ncommand, are referable to the same cause. This cause, Mr. Myers suggests,\nis the working of the \" Subliminal Consciousness.\" No one can fail to be\nstruck by the eminent reasonableness and fitness of a hypothesis put\nforward so clearly, and with such a sympathetic grasp of the importance and\nrange of phenomena, hitherto unexplained, and even unclassified, and on\nwhich so much light is thrown by Mr. Myers's masterly investigations.\nE. J. Todd, Assoc. S.P.R.\n[The question here raised by our correspondent is one on which we should\nbe very glad to have reliable observations made and reported to us. There\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1892.\nis a very widespread belief that the power exists of awaking exactly at a\nspecified time, different from the usual hour without having previously\nawoke several other times during the night. Many trustworthy people\nbelieve that they themselves possess this power, but few, if any, appear to\nhave recorded the instances of success and failure, and without this it is\ndifficult to feel sure that the successes have not been remembered in undue\nproportion, or the completeness of the success exaggerated in recollection.\nWhat is to be desired is that those who believe themselves to have the power\nshould note down beforehand, on any occasion on which they intend to make\nuse of it, the hour at which they mean to awake, and afterwards should record\nthe exact time at which they did awake and whether they slept soundly up\nto that moment or awoke before. If the success were pretty complete and\nconstant, comparatively few observations would suffice to decide the question ;\nand if the fact were thoroughly established we should agree with our corre\nspondent in regarding it as a most interesting manifestation of the power of\nthe subliminal consciousness in sleep, \u2014Ed.]\nCONGRESS OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY.\nWe may remind our readers that the International Congress of\nExperimental Psychology, of which a provisional programme was\nprinted in the Journal for May, will meet in London, in the rooms of\nUniversity College, Gower-street, on Monday, August 1st, and the three\nfollowing days.\nA special section will be formed for the discussion of hypnotism and\nphenomena cognate to those of hypnotism, including thought-transfer\nence, crystal vision, etc. Among the foreign contributors of papers to\nthis section will be Professor Bernheim of Nancy, Dr. Berillon, the\neditor of the Revue de I'lfypnotisme, and Professor Delbceuf.

The\nmeeting was attended by over 300 persons, including nearly a hundred\nvisitors, from all parts of Europe and from America and Australia. I\nthink I may venture to describe the meeting as a success, since an\naddress so describing it was presented at the close of the Congress, with\nthe signatures of fifty of the foreign visitors. This address\u2014after\nexpressing a generous appreciation of the efforts of myself and of the\nsecretaries of the Congress, Mr. Myers and Professor Sully, on whom\nthe chief work of organising the meeting had fallen\u2014concludes with\nthe following sentences :\u2014\n\"Finally, the guests from abroad find it impossible to express in any\nadequate way their sense of appreciation of the great hospitality of their\nreception and entertainment in the great English metropolis. They carry\naway with them the most pleasant memories of the social events of the\n\f28-i Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Are., in92.\nCongress, and will always cherish the new friendships which they have\nfunned here with so many distinguished representatives of British culture\nand scientific attainment.\"\nI have quoted these cordial words here because the Members of our\nSociety took a full share in the performance of the duties of hospitality\ntowards our visitors, and I think they ought to know that their efforts\nwere duly appreciated.\nThe Congress is an event of some importance in the history of the\nS.P.R., since here, for the firs1 time in England, the representatives of\nour Society have claimed a place for their special investigations, as a\nrecognised department of the scientific study of psychology, and have\nhad their claim admitted without opposition. I set great value on the\nharmonious relations that we have thus established with psychologists\npursuing more beaten lines of inquiry, and I hope we shall succeed in\nmaintaining them. I do not, of course, infer from these relations that\nthe reality of telepathy or thought-transference is now generally\naccepted by psychologists. No vote on this subject was taken at the\nCongress, and we did not desire that it should be taken ; indeed, we\nwere particularly anxious that it should be clearly understood that no\none, by attending the Congress, was even in the most indirect way\ncommitted to a view in favour of the conclusions which the workers of\nour Society have put forward. We were quite content to have the\nunrivalled opportunity which such a Congress affords of drawing the\nattention of psychologists to the nature and extent of our evidence,\nand of explaining fully our methods of statistical and experimental\ninquiry.\nIn order adequately to obtain this advantage, it was necessary that\nthe Congress should be\u2014what its first founders in Paris intended it to\nbe\u2014fairly and fully representative of the whole range of experimental\npsychology, and should not merely represent the workers in a limited\ndepartment of the subject. When, however, the benevolent interest\naccorded in Paris to our special lines of inquiry had led Mr. Myers\nand myself to undertake the duty, offered us by the first Congress, of\norganising an International Meeting of Experimental Psychologists in\nLondon, we were aware that the task of making such a meeting fairly\nand fully representative of the whole subject would not be free from\ndifficulties. We were aware that the amount of attention given in\nParis to hypnotism and cognate subjects had incurred some disapproval,\nespecially in Germany ; and we were aware that if a Congress in Paris\nunder M. Ribot's presidency was found to be in this respect unorthodox,\na Congress in London presided over by me might be naturally expected\nto exhibit unorthodoxy of this kind in a still more alarming degree.\nWe were afraid that such expectations might have a tendency to bring\nN\n\fAlt,., 18'Ji] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. .285\nabout their own fulfilment, by leading important representatives of\nmore orthodox psychology to keep aloof from us.\nAccordingly, Mr. Myers and I thought it our duty to show clearly,\nin planning the work of the Congress and inviting papers, that we did\nnot confound our functions as organisers of the Congress with our\nfunctions as officials of the S.P.R. We therefore took special care to\navoid giving an undue place to the inquiries in which we were\nspecially interested ; and aimed, on the contrary, at making our list of\npapers as adequately representative as possible of the various lines of\ninquiry, , pursued by very diverse methods, which come within the\nrange of psychology,\u2014understood in its widest sense as including the\nphysiology of the brain and nervous system. I think the list of 42\npapers (including three reports) which were laid before the Congress\nshows that we succeeded tolerably well in this endeavour. But we\ncould hardly have hoped for anything like this degree of success with\nout the invaluable aid of Professor Sully; to whose intermediation we\nwere further indebted for the privilege of meeting in the spacious\nlecture-rooms which the authorities of University College liberally\nplaced at our disposal.\nReassured by the comprehensive nature of our programme, and by\nthe names of the contributors who had responded to the invitations of\nthe two secretaries, the foreign psychologists attended in numbers that\nrealised our highest hopes. The greatest of the living men of science\nof Germany\u2014von Helmholtz\u2014attended the afternoon meetings of the\nfirst two days, before he passed on to the British Association in\nEdinburgh. Besides him, the University of Berlin was represented by\nProfessors Preyer and Ebbinghaus, who both contributed papers on\nthe interesting subjects of the \" Origin of Numbers \" and \" Colour-\nPerception\" respectively. Dr. Goldseheider, of Berlin, who was unable\nto come, also contributed a valuable paper on \" The Muscular Sense of\nthe Blind.\" Professor Miinsterberg, of Freiburg, and Professor Lange, of\nOdessa, also represented the German school of psychology by con\ntributing papers, though they were prevented by illness from being\npresent in person. On the more physiological side, Germany was\nrepresented by the distinguished name of Hitzig, who contributed an\naccount of the cure of attacks of morbid sleep by hypnotic suggestion.\nFrom France we had Professor Richet and Professor Pierre Janet, with\nwhose names all our readers will be familiar ; Professors Bernheim,\nDellxeuf, and Liegeois, known to all students of hypnotism ; as well as\nDr. Burilion, editor of the liecae d'Hypnotising, and M. Marillier, who\nhas had the conduct of the Census of Hallucinations in France. All these\ncontributed papers or reports ; and we also received papers from Dr.\nLiebeault, the founder of the \"School of Nancy,\" and Professor Beaunis\n\f286' Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Ace, 1S92.\n\u2014formerly at Nancy\u2014who co-operated in securing for the School of\nNancy the recognition of the value of its work in hypnotism which is\nnow generally accorded to it. Belgium, Denmark, Holland. Norway,\nSweden, Roumania, and Russia also furnished representatives and\nc mtributors ; and the Transatlantic activity which is now bei'ig turned\ninto the direction of experimental psychology found expression in four\npapers \u2014one of these being by a lady, Mrs. Ladd Franklin, who main\ntained a theory of \" Colour-Perception \" opposed to that of Professor\nEbbinghaus. Among the well-known English psychologists who\nattended I may mention the distinguished names of J)r. Bain and Mr.\nShadworth Hodgson ; of whom the former opened the proceedings with a\nweighty paper on \"The Respective Spheres and Mutual Aids of Intro\nspection and Experiment in Psychology\"; and I may add that Mr. A. J.\nBalfour found time to attend one of the afternoon meetings.\nThe abundance of our material having rendered a division into\nsections necessary, we thought it best to allot Neurology and Psycho-\nphysics to one section (A), and Hypnotism and cognate questions to\nanother section (B). The discussions of section B were carried on\nfor three mornings\u2014Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday ; along\nwith these, the discussion on a paper by Professor Janet, read on\nMonday afternoon, on a peculiar case of loss of memory, and\nthat on the Report of the Census of Hallucinations, which was\nread on Wednesday afternoon, form the part of the whole proceedings\nwhich properly comes within the scope of our Society. I propose\naccordingly, in the detailed account that follows, to confine myself\nto these discussions, but I must not omit to notice that Professor\nRichet in the suggestive sketch of the Future of Psychology, with\nwhich he opened the proceedings on Monday afternoon, allotted an\nimportant place to the \" psychologic transcendentale \" which we claim\nas our special concern.\nProfessor Janet followed with a description of a case of amnesia which\ndiffered from ordinary loss of memory in being not merely \" retrograde \" but\n\"anterograde\/' i.e., the patient had not merely lost a portion of her stored\nrosollections of the past, but also her power of acquiring new recollections.\nThe malady was due to an emotional shock caused\u2014on August 28th, 1891\u2014\nby a heartless practical joke : in consequence of the shock she appeared not\nmerely to have lost the memory of all events that had occurred during the\nsix weeks preceding August 28th, but also to have become incapable of\nremembering anything that had occurred since : all impressions seemed to\nglide over her without leaving the least trace. But some sentences uttered\nin sleep showed that though these recollections were now lost to her waking\nconsciousness, they had not vanished altogether, and the application of\nhypnotism was found to restore them completely during the hypnotic trance.\nProfessor Janet also found that even in her waking state there was an\nunconscious memory of these apparently forgotten events, of which he\n\fAug., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 287\nobtained evidence by means of automatic writing or speaking, performed\nwhen her consciousness was concentrated on some other process. His\nexplanation was that the malady had not affected the memory\u2014taken in its\nwidest sense\u2014but had produced a peculiar kind of \" desagregation psycho-\nlogique \" by weakening the patient's power of ' ' attaching to her personality \"\nher more recent experiences.\nProfessor Ebbinghaus, of Eerlin, while recognising the interest of the\nfacts brought before the Congress by Professor Janet, was inclined to suggest\na different explanation ; viz., that the patient's consciousness was so com\npletely absorbed by present feelings and perceptions that she had not spare\nmental energy sufficient for the work of reproducing past experiences until\nthe distractions of the present were shut out. Accordingly, in sleep, or in\nthe hypnotic trance, the absence of such distractions was naturally accom\npanied by the revival of memory.\nThe President pointed out that though Dr. Ebbinghaus' explanation\ningeniously met the facts of recovery of memory in dreams and the hypnotic\ntrance, it hardly seemed applicable to the manifestation of unconscious or\nsubconscious memory through automatic speaking and writing in the normal\nstate.\nOn Tuesday morning, after a paper from Dr. Liebeaqlt, on \"A Case of\nSuicidal Mania Cured by Suggestion,\" had been read by Professor Liegeois,\nan interesting discussion was introduced by a paper of De. Van Eeden,\nadvocating strongly the use of suggestion as a therapeutic agency, but\ndeprecating the use of hypnotism strictly so-called ; on the ground that the\nheightened suggestibility of the hypnotic state was an \"abnormal con\ndition\" depending on \"ataxia or disintegration of the psyche,\" which must\nbo strictly avoided. In Dr. Van Eeden's view therapeutic suggestion\nshould be addressed \" to the intellect and conscious volition of the sufferer.\n. . . Suggestibility, as denned by French authors, consists of two parts,\nidioplastic power \"\u2014i.e., influence of ideas on bodily functions\u2014 \"and im\npressionability.\" His idea is to increase idioplastic power, and bring it as\nmuch as possible under the influence of conscious volition, without in\ncreasing impressionability.\nThe discussion on this papor was opened by Dr. Bernheim, who denied\nthe \"abnormality\" of tho hypnotic state. The heightened suggestibility\nwhich Dr. Van Eeden regards as evidence of abnormality is found\u2014urged\nDr. Bernheim\u2014in ordinary sleep ; dreams are \" sensorial autosuggestions.\"\nAt the same time, there are undoubtedly many ways in which suggestion\nmay be made to operate apart from hypnotism, e.g., in the processes of\nhydrotherapy and electrotherapy.\nDr. BihuLLON considered that tho School of Nancy went too far in\nidentifying hypnotic suggestibility and the hypnotic trance with ordinary\nsuggestibility and ordinary sleep. The artificial suppression of cerebral\ncontrol and the temporary reduction of tho subject to an automaton in tho\nhands of the hypnotiser\u2014doubtless in consequence of tho temporary torpor\nof certain cerebral cells\u2014must be regarded as the special characteristic of the\nhypnotic state. It was therefore abnormal, though Dr. Berillon by no\nmeans thought that it ought therefore to be excluded from medical use.\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Aug., 1892.\nDit. Bernheim' said that the susceptibility to external suggestion which\nDr. Berillon regarded as peculiar to the hypnotic trance might also be\ndeveloped in ordinary sleep, if suggestions were given to the sleeper in such\na manner as not to awaken him.\nProfessor Delbocuf, of Liege, agreed with Professor Bernheim that\nthere was nothing abnormal in the hypnotic state. He also agreed that\ncurative suggestion might be equally effective without hypnotisation as with\nit ; illustrating this by some striking examples from his own experience.\nDr. Sperling, of Berlin, said that as we do not yet know what normal sleep\nis, it is not easy to say whether the hypnotic trance is the same or something\ndifferent. Also we must avoid falling into a dispute about words. The\nhypnotic sleep was clearly a state of heightened suggestibility, but it was\nequally true that high suggestibility was sometimes found in the waking state ;\nand undoubtedly suggestion was often a factor in other modes of treatment\nthan the hypnotic\u2014such as electrotherapy, to which Dr. Bernheim had\nreferred. Only it was impossible to say exactly how far suggestion operated\nbefore we had estimated what electricity \u2014or any similar agent\u2014could do\nwithout suggestion. The determination of this by careful experiment was a\npoint of much importance.\nAfter this discussion there was an interesting controversy between Dk.\nBernheim and Dr. Mendelssohn, from St. Petersburg. The former con\ntended, in a paper on \"Hysterical Amblyopia,\" that hysterical defects of\nvision and all the disorders and diminutions of sensibility in hysterical\nsubjects were \" purely psychical \" ; i.e., that the sense-perceptions in such\ncases were normal, but that self-suggestion prevented them from havmg\ntheir due effect on tho subject's mind. Dr. Mendelssohn, on the other\nhand, argued that some more constant cerebral cause was to be inferred\nfrom tho regularity with which similar effects manifested themselves in\ndifferent cases of hysterical affections.\nOn Wednesday morning Professor DsLBCEUF,of Liege, read the first paper,\nwhioh was on \" Tho Appreciation of Time by Somnambulists.\" He began\nby distinguishing the cases brought forward by him from the ordinary cases of\nsuggestions called \" Suggestions ii echdance \"\u2014 i.e., suggestions to be realised\nat a distant date\u2014which only proved that a hypnotised subject was capable\nof performing an act at a date indicated a long time in advance, without any\nconsciousness of the real motive force that prompted the act. But the faculty\nthat he had studied was different ; it was that of appreciating more or less\napproximately, without conscious calculation or means of indication, the\npassing of time. He had studied it with two young, robust and healthy\ncountrywomen, now married and mothers, good somnambulists, whose names\nwere constantly to be met with in his works on hypnotism. Those two sub\njects weru incapable of reducing exactly into hours and minutes a number\nof minutes such as 1,000 or even 350, much less of calculating at what hour\ntho 1,050th minute after 6.35 p.m. would fall. They received suggestions\nwhich they were to perform after 350, 900, 1,(300, 1,150, 1,300, 3,300 minutes.\nIn two cases out of thirteen the suggested acts were performed exactly at\nthe time ordered ; in the other eleven cases the time at which they were per\nformed differed from the time suggested by a period varying from T'sth to aV th\n\fAlg., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 289\nof the whole interval fixed. M. Dolb<euf ended by saying that he drew no con\nclusion from his experiments except that the subject was one to be studied.\nAfter the conclusion of Dr. Delbceuf's paper, which will appear in our\nProceedings,\nThe President said that he had listened with great interest to Professor\nDelboeuf's account of his experiments. If he might venture to rush in where\nthe caution of the author had prevented him from treading, and attempt a\nsolution of the remarkable results described, he would suggest that we might\nsuppose an extension of the power of calculation ordinarily possessed by M.\nDelbo:uf's two subjects to have taken place as a consequence of the\nhypnotic condition, whether owing to the concentration of cerebral energy\nincident to that condition or to some other cause. Such an extension would\nseem to be more or less analogous to the extensions of the faculties of sense-\nperception that frequently occur in the hypnotic trance. It seemed to him\nthat this explanation was rendered all the more probable by the fact that the\nact ordered was not performed exactly at the time ordered in 11 out of the 13\nexperiments tried by M. Delbojuf. It is natural to suppose that in these\ncases the reckoning had been only rough and approximate.\n\"In connexion with this question,\" ho continued, \" it seems to me that\nit would be worth while to make a systematic inquiry into the supposed power\nof knowing the lapse of time in sleep, which many persons believe them\nselves to possess. If it could be shown that the human organism can some\nhow measure the lapse of time in sleep, more accurately than it can measure\nthis lapse through an equally long period of waking life\u2014without the aid of\nclocks or watches\u2014it would be easier to understand how this increased\nfaculty of time-measurement should appear in the hypnotic state. Now,\nprobably we have all met persons, of the most highly educated class, who\nnrraly believe themselves to have the power of waking at any hour they\nlike\u2014to catch a train, or for any similar object. For such practical purposes\na very rough approximation would, of course, be sufficient, and the explanation\nof the alleged faculty which is usually accepted among scientific persons who\ndo not possess it is that the self-wakcr has really only the power of giving\nhimself a lighter sleep than usual, so that he probably wakes several times\nduring the night, or wakes early \u2014when the morning light and noises begin\nto assail his senses\u2014 and then dozes and wakes at brief intervals till the\nappointed time arrives. But I have met several persons who altogether deny\nthat their own experiences can be explained in this way : and in one or two of\nthe experiments that I have persuaded them to try, a remarkable degree of ex\nactitude without previous waking has been reported. Systematic experiments\non the point are, however, much to bo desired, and my object in speaking\nnow is, if possible, to persuade some of the persons who believe themselves\nto possess this power to make such experiments in sufficient number and with\nthe care and exactness in recording conditions which are, of course, indis\npensable, if the result is to have any scientific value. It would be necessary\nto write down overnight, in hours and minutes, the hour appointed for waking ;\nthen to note the exact time of waking that came nearest to this, and at least the\nnumber\u2014if not the exact times\u2014of the wakings that had occurred previously\nduring the night ; to exclude all sounds of clocks or church bells, and, if\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Ate, 1892.\npossible, by varying the conditions, to exclude any important operations of\nchanges in light and noise, and in any case to note these last. If any self-\nwaker will have the patience to try such experiments systematically and to\nrecord the results, I shall be much obliged to him if he will either send nit\nsuch record, or notify me where it is published.\"\nThen followed a piper by Professor Hitzio, describing a remarkable\ncase of cure of morbid sleep-attacks by hypnotic suggestion. After this\nJIlt. Myers read a paper on the \" Experimental Induction of Hallucina\ntions.\" This is not summarised here, as it will appear in the next number of\nProceedings ; but its general character may he gathered from the interesting\nspeech of Professor Janet, which followed it.\nProfessor Janet began by saying that he would content him telf with\ncertifying the reality of the facts described by Mr. Myers. In certain\ncircumstances there were patients who could not look long on a shining\nsurface without experiencing illusions and a kind of hallucinations. Some\ntimes those hallucinations possessed interest ; sometimes they might furnish\nimportant information on the state of mind of the patient. He cited some\nof the hallucinations which he had studied. (1) It was known that after\nserious attacks of natural somnambulism there was a complete loss of\nmemory of what had passed during the attack. Sometimes recollection\ncould be restored easily, by divers processes, and in particular by\nsuggestion. Too often it was impossible to restore recollection in this\nway ; and it was then necessary to use artificial means. That of which he\nhad availed himself most often was the well-known process of automatic\nwriting ; but other methods might bo adopted. One day a young female\npatient had an attack of somnambulism, during which she had written a\nletter which she had afterwards torn up, and the contents of which she had\nforgotten. By causing her to gaze upon a shining surface he succeeded in\nmaking her read by hallucination the whole of that letter. (2) Many\npatients were tormented by fixed ideas. Some had full consciousness of\nthose ideas, and openly stated what they were. Others could not well\ndescribe them, and did not clearly know what it was which tormented them.\nOthers had no notion of those lixfid ideas, which provoked only states of\nemotion and impulses in them. For examplo, a young man had continual\nfear, without being able to explain what he was afraid of. It was sufficient\nto make him gaze on a shining surface for some time for him to see the\nflames of a fire ; and after listening to a monotonous sound for some time he\nbecame aware of certain other sounds, those of the bugle of the fire\nbrigade ; in a word, that process revealed the persistent idea of a lire which\nhe had witnessed at some previous date. (It) Certain patients attacked by\nabunlie (loss of volitional power) needed to see from tine to time a person\nwho acted as the director of their conscience. When the patient had\nquitted this director he or she was well ; but at the end of a variable time\nagain fell ill and needed, so to speak, to be wound up again. It was diflieult\nto know what characterised the period of health. .V patient of that kind\nhad, at the time when she gazed steadily at an object, the hallucination of\nseeing M. Janet's portrait, which acted as a kind of moral direction which\npersisted unconsciously. As for the explanation of the facts, he agreed that\n\fAug., 1s92.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 291\nMr. Myers was right in suggesting very different causes according to tho\ncases. It was impossible to explain all those complex phenomena by a\nsingle word. There was suggestion, certainly ; but there were ' also other\nvery different causes operating, such as associations of ideas, and modifica\ntions of the state of consciousness otherwise caused.\nOn Wednesday afternoon Professor Sidgwick read in an abridged form\na part of his final report on the Census of Hallucinations, \u2014 of which two ad\ninterim reports have bean already published in our Proceedings. It is hoped\nto publish the whole report as Part XXIV. of the Society's Proceedings early\nnext year. Professor Sidgwick began by describing the somewhat elaborate\nmethod used to secure as complete accuracy as possible in the statement of the\nresults of the 17,000 answers received by him to tho questions circulated.\nSpeaking broadly, it appeared that about one in ten of the persons (taken at\nrandom) from whom inquiry was made remembered experiences of the kind\ninquired into. Among these the largest class consisted of realistic human\napparitions of living people or unrecognised human figures, the number of\napparitions of dead persons being relatively small, and the number of grotesque\napparitions still smaller. In only a very small percentage of cases was there\nany observed disturbance of health at the time of the hallucination\u2014 the\nhallucinations of fever and madness having, of course, been excluded by the\noriginal definition. A remarkable class of cases was that of collective\napparitions, the same hallucinations being simultaneously perceived by two\nor more persons. In some of these there seemed a possibility of verbal\nsuggestion from one percipient to another ; in ethers no communication\ns'jomed to have been possible except such as may exist independently of any\nof the recognised organs of sense. The collective class led on to the still\nmore remarkable class of coincidental hallucinations, or those which occur\nsimultaneously with some distant event with which they seem to be con\nnected, especially tho death of the person whose figure appears. The actual\nproportion of coincidental to non-coincidental cases, after all deductions for\npossible sources of error, was in fact such that the probability against tho\nsupposition of chance coincidence became enormous, on the assumption of\nordinary accuracy on the part of informants. If the theory of a causal con\nnection was to be set aside it must be by straining the assumption of\ninaccuracy on the informant's part to an extreme pitch.\nM. Marillier, in tho course of his report on tho inquiries made in\nFrance on the same subject, stated that he had had great difficulty in obtaining\nany replies to his inquiries. This was due to several causes, among which\nthe chief was the repugnance of the French public to give any information\non psychological subjects. Tho statistical results obtained by M. Marillier\ncoincided broadly with the result of the English investigation : and the same\nis true of the results of tho American inquiry, forwarded by Mr. Hodgson.\nIn tho discussion that followed\nDr. Osler (Johns Hopkins University) remarked that no one who saw\na hallucinatory figure could be said to be in good health of body and mind.\nTho mere fact of experiencing a hallucination implied some serious organic\ndisturbance\nDr. Elizabeth Blackwell said that a new moaning seemed to have\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Aug., 1S92.\nbeen given to the term \" hallucination \" in the report that they had heard :\nsince, as commonly used in medicine, the term implied morbidity.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers said that Dr. Osier's view was hardly tenable iu\nface of the fact with which hypnotism had made us familiar \u2014 that a full\nblown hallucination could be produced in many healthy subjects by a mere\n\"post hypnotic order,\" with no concomitant or subsequent organic disturb\nance. A rarer, but even more instructive, class of experimental hallucina\ntions were those caused from a distance by an effort of concentration on the\npart of the agent. He saw among the audience Dr. Freiherr von Schrenck-\nNotzing, who had made a successful experiment of this rare kind.\nDit. vox Schrenck-Notzing then described briefly the experiment more\nfully recorded in the Journal for October, 1888 (Vol. III., p. 307).\nProfessor Fiianklix (Johns Hopkins University) held that if the hallu\ncinatory apparition was of a person known to be ill\u2014even if the knowledge\nwere not accompanied by anxiety\u2014the chances against the coincidence of\nhallucination and death would be very much reduced.\nThe President said that no doubt the chances would be somewhat\nreduced in this case : since, if the percipient's stnte of health at the time were\nsuch as to cause a hallucination it would perhaps be more probable that it\nwould take the form of a friend known to be ill than of one known to bo\nwell. But mere knowledge without anxietyt could not be regarded as a vera\niwisa of hallucinations : therefore, if \u2014as was most frequently the case in his\ncollection \u2014tho hallucination was the percipient's only experience of the kind,\nthe chances would still be very much against its coinciding accidentally with\nthe death of a friend. Iu reply to Dr. Osier, he wished to explain that tho\nstatements with regard to health in the report were made, after careful con\nsideration of the answers received, with the advice and concurrence of a\nphysician who was a member of the Committee.\nThe first paper on Thursday morning was read by Dr. Bkuillox, editor\nof the lieruc tie VHypnotisme. It was entitled \" Les Applications de la\nSuggestion Hypnotique a l'Education.\" He said that in 188(5 he had lirst\ncalled attention to tho applications which might be made of suggestion in\neducation. Since then he had tried to induce hypnotism in 250 children of\nboth sexes, from which he had deduced the following conclusions. Of tea\nchildren from six to fifteen years taken from all classes of society, eight were\nsusceptible of being sent into a profound sleep after the first or second seance.\nRobust, healthy children whose hereditary antecedents were in no way un\nfavourable were generally veiy liable to suggestion, and consequently very\neasily hypnotised. This capacity for suggestion and hypnotism had been\nutilised to treat the following cases, which concerned education as much as\nmedicine : \u2014Nervous insomnia, terror manifested at night, somnambulism,\nkleptomania, tics, stammering, inveterate idleness, unuleanliness, cowardice,\nthe habit of biting the nails, and moral perversity. These facts had since\nbeen verified by a large number of authors. They constituted the practical\nside of psychology. Suggestion afforded a process of psychological in\nvestigation which enabled them to submit to a rigorous analysis the develop\nment of the various intellectual faculties in the child, and to benefit education\nby the use of the experimental method.\n\fAug., 1802.] Journal oj Society for Psychical Research. 293\nDr. Van Eeden considered that artifices such as paralysing the arm by\nsuggestion, which Dr. Bsrillon had described himself as using in an extreme\ncase of thievish disposition, were undesirable with children, and that moral\nsuggestion alone should be employed.\nDr. Bernheim was of opinion that regular hypnotisation was not often\nneeded with young children. The mother was able to inspire the needed\nsuggestions at times of special susceptibility, as during the act of falling\nasleep. Even when asleep children would usually reply to any verbal sug\ngestion. It was impossible to create either an intelligence or a moral sense\nnot born in a child ; but it was possible and desirable to ropair by suggestion\nthose perversions of moral sense which wore merely due to the influence of\nbad companionship.\nM. Berillon replied that it was impossible to say by simple inspection\nwhether the lack of moral sense in a child was due to original defect or to\nsubsequent perversion. The result of treatment alone would show.\nM. Delbojuj' agreed with Dr. Van Eeden that physical artifices were of\nlittle service in curing a child, say, of the habit of theft.\nM. Bkrillon agreed that the physical artifice should be regarded as a\nlast resort.\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing, of Munich, expressed the hope that Dr.\nBerillon's interesting paper, when published, would contain statistical tables,\nindicating the proportion of successes to failures in his experience, and care\nfully distinguishing transient from permanent effects.\nThe President (Professor Sidgvvick) said that he thought they would all\nagree that Dr. Van Eeden's method of appealing to the child's moral sense\nshould be the only one tried in ordinary cases. But he thought that Dr.\nBerillon had sufficiently guarded himself against being supposed to do more\nthan recommend hypnotic treatment as supplementing, not supplanting,\nmoral suasion. It seemed to him that, so restricted, it was a valuable instru\nment which it would be a mistake to reject.\nMrs. Sidgwick then read a paper on some experiments in thought-\ntransference, most of which have already been described to the S.P.R.\nThe paper will probably be published in substance in the next number of our\nProceedings.\nThe proceedings of the morning concluded with a paper by Professor\nLikoeois (of Nancy) on a case of poisoning under the influence, as he\nbelieved, of suggestion ; which led to a discussion on the justice of punishing\ncrimes committed under the overmastering influence of another will.\nOn two afternoons during the Congress Dr. Bramwell gave interesting\nillustrations of some of the effects of hypnotism, and described some of his\nexperiences in producing analgesia relieving from sea-sickness, etc. One of\nthe most interesting things he described was the removal, in one case, of\nmyopia by suggestion. lie especially dwelt on the fact that it was easy to\ninsure that patients should exercise free choice as to whether they would\naccept or reject any particular suggestion of their hypnotiser.\nIt is intended that a Report of the Congress should be published in\nthe autumn, giving abstracts of the papers read and an account of the\ndiscussions.

We hope that further experi\nments will be made on the same subject, which has acquired additional\ninterest from Professor Delbceuf's paper on the Appreciation of Time\nby Somnambulists, communicated to the Congress of Experimental\nPsychology (Cf. mite, pp. 288, 289), In making these experiments, the\nhour at which it is intended to awake should be recorded in writing\nbeforehand, and if possible there should be no striking or even ticking\nclock within earshot.\nI. From a lady well known to the Editor :\u2014\nYou suggest in the Journal for June that observations might he made\nand reported to you on this point, so I send mine. It was a previous\nexperience of mine that when nursing in illness I could always time myself\nto wake with certainty, and these observations confirm that experience. It\nseems useless for mo to go on any further, as I never fail ; but then I am a\nvery poor sleeper, accustomed to wake a great deal, and broken in by lots of\nnursing and watching. The testimony of young and healthy sleepers would\nno doubt possess more value.\nObservations.\nJuly 4th, 1892.\u2014 Seeing that the almanack stated that the sun rose at\n3.49, I gave a casual, half-determined, half-tentative order: \"Wake me at\n13.49.\" I was awaked suddenly, got up and went into the dressing-room,\nwhere the gas burned low and a watch lay on the drawers ; it was the time\nstated exactly. Told J. of it.\nJuly 5th. \u2014Order given, again casually, with none of the seriousness of\nintention which I should have associated with it had I been going to act\nupon the sequence, instead of merely experimenting upon it. This time I\nsaid : \" Wake me to take a journey, at 4 o'clock,\" meaning, wake me at 4,\nbut not saying so. I was awaked with a struggle of consciousness, could\nnot remember where I was, or anything, but seemed to be down in a deep\nplace, like a well ; and 1 heard an inner voice say : \" Wake and get up,\nit's just 3 o'clock, you need an hour to prepare for a journey at 4.\" Still I\nwas but half conscious, when the words were repeated : \"It is 3, not 4 ; but\nyou said, 'Wake me for a journey at 4.'\" By that time I awoke com\npletely, and the clock struck 3.\nJuly 6th. \u2014 \"Don't wake me at all.\" Was awaked at 4 by a banging\nwindow, accompanied by the immediate observation that it was only the\nnoise of the unfastened window that awoke mo.

From the Rev. C. A. Goodhart :\u2014\nI send my \" observations \" as to the above. Personally I have always\nbelieved that I could wake exactly at the time I wanted to, and, indeed, I\nhave habitually set myself to do so by carefully recounting the intervening\nhours and dwelling on the total before going to sleep. I don't think I have\never missed a train from oversleeping myself, and the waking at several\nother times during the night has only been an occasional experience.

Taking an unaccustomed time has either\nirritated the subliminal consciousness or in some way upset its calculations.\nI expect we often overlook accessories to waking at unaccustomed times,\ne.g., retiring earlier in prospect ; the fidgetiness of others who know of our\nintention, and help to rouse us, &c. ; though, of course, it may be said the\nsubliminal consciousness objects to experiments and confounds the ex\nperimenter.\nC.

Journal for April, 1892, p. 246 [L. 936], but is in one respect more\ncomplete, inasmuch as it seems to show that the presence or near neighbour\nhood of a letter containing news not yet read by the percipient (in this case\na writing medium) may be without influence on the phenomenon. It has,\nmoreover, I think, a wider interest, as showing that the simple messages\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1892.\nobtained by writing or similar means may often be more trustworthy than\nmessages obtained in more complicated and elaborate ways It is most\ndesirable that cases of this type should be collected in greater numbers and\nwith greater care.\nSignora Maria Manzini, residing here in Padua, has been for a few months\nexperimenting with automatic writing, and is habitually controlled by a\npersonality which announces itself under the name of Elvira.\nOn April 21st, 1892, Signora Maria Manzini received a letter from Venice\ninforming her that her cousin, Maria Alzetta, was seriously ill with phthisis.\nIt was long since Signora Manzini had heard news of this cousin, and she\nonly knew that, having been left a childless widow, she had remarried and\nhad two children by her second husband. On the evening of the same day\nSignora M. was writing in my presence, under the control of Elvira, and\nasked questions as follows :\u2014\nQ. : Can you tell me if my cousin's illness is really serious ?\nAfter a pause of about a minute and a half the answer came\u2014\nA. : She has a very short time to live, and she leaves three lovely children.\nQ. : Did you first know this when I received news of the illness ?\nA. : No, I have known it for many days, but did not mention it for fear\nof paining Maria [the medium].\nQ. : Why, then, were you so slow just now in answering my question ?\nA. : I went to see how she was, so as to be able to tell you precisely.\nNext day Signora M. wrote to Venice offering to go and see the invalid.\nOn the 24th she received an answer expressing a desire for her arrival, and\nstating that the invalid was at the hospital. She wrote again to ask on what\ndays it was allowed to visit the hospital patients. Before an answer arrived,\nSignora M. wrote in my presence (April 28th) under Elvira's control, and we\nput the following questions :\u2014\nQ. : How is the invalid at Venice ? Do you know why the answer to my\nletter has not arrived ? and do you know on what day it is allowed to visit\nthe hospital ?\nA. : The invalid's condition is the same. There is little hope. She has\nundergone a serious operation ; there is danger. To-morrow morning Maria\nwill receive a letter. Visitors such as she are received every day at the\nhospital.\nQ. : Do you mean because Maria is a relation of the invalid's ?\nA. : No, but because she comes from a distance.\nFailing to see what connection there could be between pulmonary disease\nand a surgical operation, we asked :\nQ. : If the patient is in a consumption, what operation can she have\nundergone ?\nA. : She is in a consumption ; but the operation was necessitated by the\nbirth of her last little girl.\nNext morning Signora M. received a post-card from Venice containing\nthese words : \" Amalia inquired at the hospital and was told that you and\nyour mother would be received on any day, as strangers from another city, if\nyou will come when it suits you.\"\n\fOct., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 301\nThe date of the letter's arrival and the news contained in it thus corre\nsponded with the prediction. But an embarrassing circumstance remained.\nWhen the postman delivered this letter he said that he had in fact brought\nit to the house on the previous evening, but finding no one at home he had\ntaken it away with him again till the following morning. Thus the messages\nfrom Elvira had been received after the postman had endeavoured to deliver\nthe letter. Had, then, the fact that the letter was already in Padua deter\nmined the communication which announced its approaching delivery and\npart of its content ?\nOn April 30th Signora M. went to Venice and found that her cousin had\nreally had a third child a few months previously, and after its birth had\nbeen ill in a way which had ultimately needed a surgical operation. Another\nsmall detail previously communicated to Signora Manzini by Elvira was\nlikewise found to be true. Signora Manzini made no mention whatever of\nher own experiments, and her cousin at Venice continued entirely ignorant\nof them.\nOn that same evening, April 30th, on Signora Manzini's return from Venice\nto Padua, I was anxious to inquire from the \" control \" as to the effect of\nthe presence in Padua of the letter which had been announced on the evening\nof the 28th for the following morning. Under the control of Elvira, Signora\nM. wrote the following answer : \"I did not know that the letter had arrived ;\nbut I was sure that Maria would receive it next morning, because those\nwho wrote it had intended that it should reach her in the morning. They\nhad intended to post it in the evening, but instead of that they posted it\ndirectly it was written. I was, in fact, mistaken ; for it was a mere chance\nthat it was actually received in the morning.\"\nI then requested Signora M. to write to her friends at Venice in the follow\ning terms : \"I would beg you to satisfy a feeling of curiosity on my part\nwith regard to a presentiment which I had about your last letter. I should\nlike to know whether it was posted at the hour which you originally intended ;\nor whether you changed your intention and posted it at a different hour.\nWill you please tell me all you remember about this ? \"\nThe following answer was received on May 2nd :\u2014.\n\" I had meant to post my last letter to you in the evening, but, fearing to\nforget it, I posted it at mid-day, when I had occasion to go out.\"\nTo resume the facts. Automatic writing informed us of facts entirely\nunknown to our ordinary consciousness ; namely, the fact that the invalid\nhad three children, and the fact that she had undergone an operation. Thus\nfar we might invoke telepathy and clairvoyance as the explanation. Then\nthere was a true prediction of the arrival of a letter, and of part of its con\ntent. But although the letter was delivered on the morning specified, it\nhad, in fact, already arrived in Padua when the communication was made,\nand its non-delivery in the evening was due to accident. Clairvoyance would\nnot explain this incident, as that power might have been expected to reveal\nthe presence of the letter in Padua. Neither was there an indication of so-\ncalled psychometry,\u2014an influence from the nearness of the letter itself. But,\nlastly, an automatic message explains the incident in the simplest manner,\nand that explanation turns out to be the true one.\nDk. G. B. Ebmacora.\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1892.\nI have read Dr. Ermacora's account, and confirm its complete accuracy.\nI will add in explanation that there had been a slight difference between\nmyself and the family of my cousin Maria Alzetta. I had neither seen her nor\nreceived any letter from her since the year 1886, when I left Venice to live\nin Padua. Two years ago my brother visited Venice, and told me that he had\nheard indirectly that my cousin had remarried and had had a child. Last\nsummer a connection of mine came from Venice and told me that my cousin\nhad had a second child. After that I had heard nothing more of her till\nthe 21st of April last, when Dr. Ermacora's narrative begins.\nMaria Manzini.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL. 943.\nThe following dream, which evidently made a great impression\non the dreamer, shows a sufficient amount of correspondence with\nactual fact both in the time at which it occurred and in detail (black\nman, schooner in distress) to suggest that it was in some way caused\nby these facts\u2014and it adds interest to it that it led to the rescue of\nthe distressed men. It is not quite clear how much of Captain\nScott's narrative was taken from contemporary notes, and probably\nno further evidence could be obtained as to this now : \u2014\nDocument I.\u2014From Bishop Hale.\nThe colony of Western Australia (called at the time the Swan River Settle\nment) was founded in 1829. Captain Scott must have gone there very shortly\nafter that period.\nIn the year 1848, I being then Archdeacon of Adelaide, went to Western\nAustralia in attendance upon the Bishop of Adelaide. Captain Scott showed\ngreat readiness to assist the Bishop, and both he and I received from him\nmany acts of kindness.\nHe, one day, told me about his dreams and the circumstances connected\ntherewith. He told it all with such animation and such varying expressions\nof face that he gave one the idea that the things he spoke of were passing\nvividly before his mind's eye as he described them.\nI was, of course, greatly struck by the narrative and said I should like\nvery much indeed to have the narrative in writing. He said at once that I\nshould have it ; he would have the copy of his log, which he had by him,\ntranscribed for me. I received the MS. a few days afterwards.\nHis last illness was a long and wearisome one, and the old man was pleased\nwhen any friend would look in and sit with him for a time. I was then\nBishop of the diocese, and I was aware that the clergyman of his parish\n(Fremantle), Mr. Bostock, was in the habit of sometimes taking his seat by\nthe old man's bedside, in addition to the performance of the usual devotional\nservices.\nI never had upon my own mind the slightest doubt about the truth of\n\fOct., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 303\nthe narrative, but I was quite aware that some persons to whom I might\nchance to show it might feel doubtful about it, and it occurred to me that\nMr. Bostock's friendly visits to the old man afforded an excellent oppor\ntunity for getting some declaration such as that which he did obtain.\nMathew B. Hale (Bishop).\nMarch 9th, 1892.\nDocument II.\u2014Captain Scott's Account.\n\"June 10th, 1825.\n'' On the night of the 7th of June I dreamed that I saw a schooner, and\napparently water-logged, with several men in her and a black man among\nthem. On the eighth I dreamed the same and got up and started the mate\nup aloft. I stayed on deck until daylight. On the 9th the same dream\noccurred. Got up and altered the ship's course, having passed between\nGuadeloupe and Antigua, the day previous, and at 8 p.m. heavy squalls\nwith heavy thunder and lightning ; shortened sail. Daylight made all sail,\nfine pleasant weather. On the 10th, at 8 o'clock, altered the ship's course from\nW.S.W. to S.W. two points for the purpose of ascertaining the true position\nof the Bird Islands, or to see if these really existed (as on my chart it was\nmarked doubtful). I was at this time very uneasy in my mind, supposing\nthat something was going to happen to my ship. I had related my dream to\nmy mate and passengers, Don Joseph Sevarra, John Poingestre and Wm.\nRichenburg, Esqrs., merchants at Carthagena, who wrote the circumstances\nto the Humane Society and to their house in London.\n\" On the morning of the 10th, at 9.3 a.m., we were all at breakfast, the\nofficer on deck called down the skylight and said that a squall was coming.\nI immediately repaired on deck to take in the small sails. On looking astern\nthe ship where the squall was coming from, we saw a boat with a large flag\nflying on an oar, and a man standing up in the bow holding it. I immediately\nhove the ship to and took in all studding and small sails. My men that were\naloft furling royals said that they could see a number of men and that they\nthought it was a pirate. One of the men stated that was just the way that he\nwas taken the year previous in the same seas. My passengers and officers then\nrequested me to keep the ship away, which I did, they stating that if they\nshould turn out to be pirates, I should not recover my insurance for my ship.\nI then kept her away under her reef'd sails and went down to breakfast. After\nmy entering my cabin, I felt very uneasy and returned to the state room.\nImmediately my dream came forcibly in my mind. I then put two pistols\nand my cutlass by my side and went on deck, called all hands on deck, and\nagain hove the ship to and desired Mr. Poingestre to take the wheel and steer\nthe ship. I then ordered the first officer to lower his boat down and go and\nsee what the boat was. I then ordered the guns to be loaded, made sail, and\nmade a tack towards the boats. On my coming up with them, found that my\nmate had taken the captain and his men out of the boat and taken them into\nhis, Captain Jellard's boat having a great quantity of water in, very nearly\nup to the thwarts, also a large shark, and had her in tow.\n\" After getting Captain Jellard on board, and his men, which were in a\nvery weak state, not able to speak with the exception of the black man ;\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1892.\nfrom him I got all the particulars, as follows : it appeared that they belonged\nto the schooner James Hambleton, of Grenada, from America, bound to\nGrenada, and being short of water, having a very long passage through\nlight winds, were going on shore for water on the Island of Saints, it then\nbeing calm. After leaving their ship a light breeze sprang up and the schooner\nkept her ground, but the boat pulling in a different direction and the cur\nrent running so strong that the boat's crew became quite exhausted. That\nat daylight they had the mortification of seeing the schooner inshore of\nthem as far as they could see from the boat, the boat still drifting further\nfrom land and ship until they lost sight of her altogether. The following\nday they had a very dreadful time of it ; it blew a heavy gale, with thunder\nand lightning ; they had to make fast the oars, mast and sail to the painter\nof the boat, and let the boat drift to break off the sea that was running.\nDuring all this time they had no water or anything to eat. The following\nday was nearly calm, very light winds and a hot, scorching sun ; being in\nthe latitude of 16\u00b0 21', longitude 63\u00b0 14', their sufferings were very great all\nday. Both captain and men tore their clothes off their backs and poured\nwater on themselves to keep them cool. On the morning that I discovered\nthem the black man appealed to his God, saying, ' If God hear black man as\nwell as white man, pray send me fish or shark for massa to eat, no let him die.'\nThe all-merciful Father heard his prayers and sent him a large shark, which\nwas lying in the boat on her being brought alongside, of which they had drunk\nthe blood and eaten part of the flesh. I immediately knocked in the head of a\nwater puncheon and made them a warm bath and put them severally into it\nfor the purpose of cooling them and getting some parts of their shirts off their\nskin which were sticking to their backs, their skin being all blistered with the\nsun and salt water. I gave them a little tea to moisten their mouths every\nfew minutes, until some of them prayed for food and asked for some biscuit,\nand gave them rice water and barley water occasionally. After a good sleep\nCaptain Jellard sent for me below and wished to speak to me. On searching\nhis pockets to see if the black man had told the truth about his ship, I found\nhis register and manifest of his cargo. This satisfied me all was correct,\nand that they were not pirates. During our conversation I found that I had\nbeen in company with Captain Jellard in St. John's, Newfoundland, in the year\n1814, he then commanding a fine schooner called the Catch Me Who Can,\nbelonging to Spuryar and Co., of Cool.\n\" In a few days they all came round. I gave them up to the British Consul\nat Carthagena and requested him to lose no time to send them on, as we\nfeared that something would be brought against the mate of the schooner.\nCaptain Jellard having all his papers with him.

I was rather late for dinner and went hurriedly into\nmy dressing-room to get ready when I was startled by seeing close to me,\nand close to my washing-stand [our correspondent here gives a diagram show\ning the position of the figure] a figure of a short woman. It looked to me,\nin the second that I saw it, like an old nurse. The dress was black, and a\nwhite apron covered her chest and the front of her dress. The face I could\nnot see ; all the head seemed enveloped in some light lavender-coloured\ngauze. It was gone so quickly I could hardly realise I had seen anything,\nand yet I know I did. She went so quickly ; it reminds me now, when 1\nthink of it, of the sudden collapse of a bright-coloured soap bubble. The\nmoment I got down to dinner I told my husband what I had seen. I have\nseen Dorothy three or four times since this, but never her face, and she in\nvariably disappears, or goes out, so quickly that I have not time to be\nfrightened. A friend of ours (Miss B), who laughed us to scorn about my\n'' apparition,\" saw her one evening in our drawing-room. I was in the room\nat the time, but being very tired my eyes were closed and I saw nothing.\nShe walked from the fireplace, Miss B said, into the inner drawing-room,\nwhere her sister, Mrs. C, was sitting in a chair opposite the fire, and dis\nappeared. Mrs. C saw nothing. Miss B made a sketch of what she saw,\nand now she will not sleep in our house ! What she saw was totally different\nto my old nurse. I have not seen Dorothy now for several months. My\ndaughter, Mrs. D, has also seen the figure. I have never noticed any altera\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Mrs. C does not believe in Dorothy, but for all that\nshe told me once that when she was playing in her bedroom, on a harmonium,\na hand was laid on her shoulder ; on turning quickly to see who it was she\nsaw no one.\nDocument II. \u2014From Mrs. A's daughter, Mrs. D.\n[October, 1889.]\nI first made Dorothy's acquaintance about three years ago. I don't\nremember the date, but it was a summer evening about a quarter-past seven.\nI was sitting on the stairs (which are narrow) petting our little dog when\nI looked up and on the flight just above me saw, as I thought, one of our\nservants, so I said, \" Will you please take some hot water to my room,\"\nwhen to my surprise the figure vanished, whether into thin air or upstairs I\ndon't know. I laughed and said to the dog, \" I fancy we've seen ' Dorothy.' \"\nThen one of the maids came up and I asked her if all the rest of them were\ndownstairs, and she said, \" Yes, in the kitchen.\" We have only one flight\nof stairs in our house. The apparition was in black, with a white apron,\nbut somehow I did not notice her face. [Mrs. D gives here a sketch show\ning the head and face hidden by the turn of the stairs.] I've often men\ntioned this at home, and told other people, too.\nMy only other experience was while sleeping in our \" ghost-room.\" I\nused to go to bed perfectly happy and not in the least nervous, but always\nwoke up about four every morning, cold and shivering and in great terror ;\nat last this got so unpleasant that I would not sleep there any longer.\nSeveral friends have had various and odd experiences while sleeping in\nthat room, and a cousin who is here now says she woke up two nights in\nthe same manner, and feeling a sort of presence in the room. The first time\nshe did this she had not heard of \" Dorothy.\"\nDocument III.\u2014Miss B's Account.\nOctober 30th [1889].\nMrs. A and I were sitting in the drawing-room, dimly lighted with gas,\nand Mrs. C was in her sitting-room, brilliantly lighted with a perfect fire\nof gas ; the half of the folding doors between the two rooms was wide open,\nthe gas from the inner room falling brightly upon its white paint. I was\nnot asleep, nor had I been for an instant, but was sitting with my eyes closed,\nand had been listening to the buzz of my sister's and Mr. A's voices, a few\nmoments before. Mr. A had left the room, so that there was no one but\nmy sister in the sitting-room, and Mrs. A sitting opposite the fireplace on\none side of the table, and myself sitting at right angles on the other side\nof the table. I opened my eyes and they rested upon the object of the sketch.\nI tried every way possible to explain to myself what I saw before me, trying\nall I could to see it into Mrs. A, but it was too small a person for her, and\nwhen a few minutes afterwards I went and found her in her usual place and\ntaxed her with having gone into Mrs. C's room her reply was, \" I have not\nmoved out of this chair ! \" She was sitting as it were sideways to the ghost,\nand could not have seen it unless she had turned her head.

I neither saw her\ncome nor go. I have been several times to , and have never seen her\nbut that once. I am sure the furniture was not moved in any way. She\ndid not touch me, I am thankful to say, for I should not have liked that.\nThe sketch enclosed by Miss B represents a slight figure in flowing\ndress drawn in at the waist, and the skirt ending in cloud-like rolls,\nthe figure seen almost from the back, and of the face, only part of\none cheek visible.\nDocument IV.\u2014A Letter from Mr. A.\nMarch 22nd, 1889.\nDeak Sib,\u2014I have always been a little sorry that so many have got hold\nof the story of our ghostly (?) manifestations at my house\u2014because such may\ninjure the value of the property to the landlord, and as we really know so\nlittle about this subject it seems to me unfair. So I should not at all like\nthe matter to become more public, or the exact house mentioned if spoken\nof. I do not otherwise mind telling you briefly our experiences. Our first\nnotice of anything peculiar was about 1881, very shortly after our coming to\n, when we were attracted by frequent ringing of a bell at night, suffi\nciently loud and distinct to awaken more than one ; this generally about 2\na.m. On one occasion our large dog howled. We examined our bell wires\nand bell hangers, but never could discover movements in any bell. At\nintervals this went on\u2014sometimes months elapsing between, and then a bell\nmanifestation\u2014for some years. Now we never hear it. Second class of the\nmysterious was noises. Certainly I have on several occasions, at intervals,\nheard irregular noises in one particular room, as though furniture, &c. were\nbeing dragged about the room. This has also been heard by people sleeping\nin the said room. Rats ! Well, may be, but very big ones ? On three or\nfour occasions persons sleeping in that room have been awoke by hearing\ntheir names called\u2014neither having heard of the affair from others. I may\nsay, however, that for three years nearly all manifestations of this sort have\nceased. The third species of visitation has been the phantom. This is a\nlady\u2014or might be a servant\u2014in dark habiliments and shaded features. This\nlady has appeared four times to my wife, once to my daughter, and once to a\nvisitor in the house. We call her Dorothy. She has on the occasions of\nvisits to my wife appeared generally standing in the bedroom\u2014and directly\ndisappeared. Standing on the staircase to my daughter, who mistook her\nfor one of the maids and spoke to her ; she vanished ! The lady visitor was\na very sceptical person in regard to this subject, and was vastly amused at\nthe \" credulity \" of certain persons. But one day, while sitting in our draw\ning-room, the door being open to the other, where several persons were, she\nsaid, \" Did anyone come through the room ? \" \" No.\" \" Well, a lady\nin black (she afterwards drew a picture of her appearance) has walked right\nthrough the room and gone into your room.\" This was about 5 p.m. This\nwas about two years ago. The last visit was about nine months. My wife\ngoing upstairs\u2014just at the top landing\u2014saw a person approach her who\npassed up so close that my wife thought she would be pushed back down\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1892.\nthe stairs, and put out her hand and drew back, saying, \" Oh, don't ! \" The\nfigure vanished. This was in full gas-light and about 9 or 10 p.m. There\nare the simple facts. I have seen no visions ; but these are sufficiently inde\npendent as to preclude the idea of all being optical delusions. The lady visitor.\nI may say\u2014when visiting us last summer\u2014would not sleep in the house. We\nare none of us troubled ; even our servants do not in the least mind\u2014as they\nperhaps only consider it our fad, none of them having ever seen or heard\nanything unnatural.\nDocument V. \u2014Extract from letter from Mrs. A.\nWe certainly did not know the house had any reputation of any kind\nwhen we took it, and it was not until after I had twice seen the phantom,\nor whatever the appearance was, that I heard some sad events had taken\nplace, not in the house but in the garden\u2014two murdered children and a\nsuicide.\nWe have been unable to obtain any further information about this\ntragedy.\nSUBLIMINAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE LAPSE OF TIME.\nWe have received the following account of experiments on his\npower of awaking himself at a given moment from a Member of the\nSociety in the North Riding of Yorkshire.\nTable Showing Results.\nAwoke at Finally awoke\nAug. 31st. 9.40 5.0 5.0 7.10\nRetired Set to awake\nSept. 1st. 9.50 4.0 4.3 0.50\n\u201e 2nd. 10.15 4.30 \u2014 6.55\n\u201e 3rd. 11.0 3.0 3.4 7.7\n\u201e 4th. 10.15 4.15 1.55, 4.20 . 6.50\n\u201e 5th. 10.10 3.45 ? 6.5\n\u201e 6th. 10.20 3.45 \u2014 6.50\n\u201e 7th. 10.30 3.45 3.45 7.30\n\u201e 8th. 10.0 4.0 5.20 6.54\n\u201e 9th. 10.0 4.0 4.20 6.45\n\u201e 10th. 10.15 2.15 \u2014 7.12\n\u201e 11th. 8.30 2.15 \u2014 6.30\nNotes on above. 7.20\nAugust 31\u00ab<.\u2014My watch was 10 minutes fast.

I had been reading \" Principles of Psycho\nlogy \" (W. James), and was rather vague as to the action of subliminal con\nsciousness and habit as different motors, apart from the influence of the\nformer on the latter.\nOur correspondent adds: \u2014\nBefore retiring I noted on paper the hour of retiring, and the time at which\nJ desired to be awaked, leaving space to insert the time of waking, so there\ncould be no dispute in case I did not remember in the morning.\nThere is no striking clock that could have given any assistance in rousing\nme.

On one side of our work we had no more energetic\nor useful ally.\nOurs, as our readers know, is necessarily a destructive as well as\na constructive task. The realm which we would fain survey is of all\nunexplored realms the richest in promise to man. But for that very\nreason it has already become the happy hunting-ground of the char\nlatan and the fool's paradise of the dupe. In America especially the\nvery alertness and openness of even the commoner minds has led to\na wide uncritical interest in Spiritism ; and \" The Vampires of\nOnset \"\u2014the fraudulent mediums who infest Spiritist gatherings\nand camps\u2014live and thrive on the credulity of a populus qui wlt\ndvcipi ; of a mass of men and women whose desire to be deceived has\na blindness and eagerness to which the history of error offers few\nmodern parallels. To check this fraud, to enlighten this folly, was\nColonel Bundy's useful task. To this work he brought a sustaining\nbelief in the important phenomena which these charlatans simulate\nand discredit. He brought a command of newspaper methods which\nwas essential if he was to get hold of the right facts and to lay them\nbefore the right readers. And he brought a force of character, an\nindisputable probity, which was gradually winning him wider and\nwider recognition. The long list of adherents to the Psychical Con\ngress over which he was to preside at the World's Fair at Chicago\ntestifois to the belief of all who knew him that he would make of that\nCongress a potent encouragement to sincere and careful dealings\nwith problems which offer so many risks of error. And now we can\nform no better wish for those who take up this good man's labours\nthan that they may walk in his footsteps, and through all labyrinths\nmay hold fast the clue of his unselfish devotion to truth.\nFrederic W.

And, under the circum\nstances, it seemed most fitting that Mr. Myers, thoroughly\nacquainted as he was with Mr. Moses' work, should state frankly\nand fully his individual opinion of its value.\nMr. Podmore then read a paper on \" Some Experiments in\nThought-transference\" by Dr. A. Blair Thaw, of New York. This\npaper, which has already been read at meetings of the American\nBranch of the S.P.R. will, it is hoped, be published in the next\nnumber of the Proceedings.\nThe President remarked that we were very glad to receive records\nof experiments of this kind, and he hoped that the paper which had\njust been read might lead to similar and further efforts. We shall\nnot really establish even the fact of thought-transference in the sense\nin which a received doctrine of science is established\u2014still less will\nthere be a prospect of learning the laws which govern its manifesta\ntion\u2014unless we can bring about a more extensive experimentation.\nThe experiments are so easy and, if not pressed to monotony, so\ninteresting\u2014even with a limited amount of success\u2014that he would\nurge all who may have the opportunity of experimenting to make the\nattempt and send their results to him.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers read part of a paper on \" Sensory Auto\nmatism,\" which will appear in the forthcoming Part of the Proceed\nings. In this paper, which does not conveniently admit of brief\nsummary, Mr. Myers urged the importance of further experiments\nin \" crystal-vision.\" Glass balls, well suited to the purpose, can be\nobtained from the Assistant Secretary for 2s. 6d., and Mr. Myers\nwould be grateful for accounts of any experiments which may be\ntried.\nALFRED TENNYSON.\nThe loss which the English-speaking world has suffered, through\nthe death of the greatest English poet of this age, has been recog\nnised with so full and adequate an expression of national regret that\nanything I could say on the more general aspects of this loss would\nseem but a feeble echo of what has been better said by others.\nWhat follows, therefore, is written entirely from the special point of\nview of our Society, of which, in the third year of its existence, Lord\nTennyson became an honorary member ; a position which he con\ntinued to hold till his death. The support of a man of genius\nexercising so important an influence over contemporary thought and\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1892.\nsentiment, would in any case have been greatly valued by us ;\nespecially in the earlier period of our existence, when friends seemed\nfew and scorners numerous. But I have always felt that the\nsympathy of Tennyson meant more to us than the sympathy of\nanother poet of equal genius and eminence might have meant, on\naccount of the special affinity between the spirit and aims of his\npoetic work and the method and teachings of modern science. This\ncharacteristic was very amply recognised in a short obituary note\nwhich appeared in Nature (October 13th): \u2014\n\" By the death of Lord Tennyson, the world loses the Poet who, above\nall others who have ever lived, combined the love and knowledge of Nature\nwith the unceasing study of the causes of things and of Nature's laws. When\nfrom this point of view we compare him with his forerunners, Dante is the\nonly one it is needful to name ; but although Dante's knowledge was well\nabreast of his time, he lacked the fulness of Tennyson, for the reason that in\nhis day science was restricted within narrow limits. It is right and fitting\nthat the highest poetry should be associated with the highest knowledge,\nand in the study of science, as Tennyson has shown us, we have one of the\nnecessary bases of the fullest poetry\u2014a poetry which appeals at the same time\nto the deepest emotions and the highest and broadest intellects of mankind.\nTennyson, in short, has shown that science and poetry, so far from being\nantagonistic, must for ever advance side by side.\"\nThe last sentence faithfully represents what was, no doubt, one of\nthe deepest aspirations of the poet. At the same time, it is no less\nimportant to note that his very reverence for Science, and willing\nness to learn the lessons that she has to teach, made him feel with\nspecial force the collision and conflict between one aspect of the\nteachings of modern science\u2014as presented by some of its most\ninfluential expositors\u2014and the profoundest needs and hopes of the\nhuman soul. Some of the most thrilling passages of In Memoriam\nare those in which this conflict finds intense and concentrated\nexpression : \u2014\nAre God and Nature then at strife,\nThat Nature lends such evil dreams ?\nSo careful of the type she seems,\nSo careless of the single life ;\nThat I, considering everywhere\nHer secret meaning in her deeds,\nAnd finding that of fifty seeds\nShe often brings but one to bear ;\nI falter where I firmly trod,\n\fNov., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 317\n\" So careful of the type ? \" but no.\nFrom scarped cliff and quarried stone\nShe cries \" A thousand types are gone :\nI care for nothing, all shall go.\nThou makest thine appeal to me :\nI bring to life, I bring to death :\nThe spirit does but mean the breath :\nI know no more.\" And he, shall he,\nMan, her last work, who seem'd so fair,\nSuch splendid purpose in his eyes,\nWho roll'd the psalm to wintry skies,\nWho built him fanes of fruitless prayer,\nWho trusted God was love indeed\nAnd love Creation's final law\u2014\nTho' Nature, red in tooth and claw\nWith ravine, shriek'd against his creed\u2014\nWho loved, who suffer'd countless ills,\nWho battled for the True, the Just,\nBe blown about the desert dust,\nOr seal'd within the iron hills ?\nNo more ?

[Nov., 1892.\nWhat is it all, if we all of us end but in being our own corpse-coffins at last,\nSwallowed in Vastness, lost in Silence, drowned in the deeps of a meaning\nless Past ?\nWhat but a murmur of gnats in the gloom, or a moment's anger of bees in\ntheir hive ?\nThis twofold aspect of Tennyson's relation to modern science\u2014this\ncombination of eager receptiveness for established scientific truths\nwith vehement recoil from the conclusions to which a limited and\nnarrow application of scientific method appeared to be leading\u2014\nrendered it natural that he should give his sympathy and support to\nthe efforts of our Society. And the memory of this sympathy will\nbe an abiding possession for our workers, as the poems in which his\nconvictions were uttered will be for the world, in the widening future\nof English literature. Henry Sidgwtck.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE BY\nMEANS OF TABLE-TILTING.\nFrom Mr. G. M. Smith.\nCustom House, Amble, Northumberland.\nOctober 14th, 1892.\nI have for many years been familiar with the usual modus operandi and\nresults in table-tilting but I have no sympathy with so-called Spiritualists as\nsuch. Recently, when reading Phantasms of the Living, I was struck with the\nexperiment in table-tilting recorded there, Vol. I., pp. 77-81,1 and I made\narrangements with a few friends to meet in my house to experiment in table-\ntilting (a thing which none of them had ever seen) with the view of adding\nsome of the novel features of the case referred to in Phantasms of the Living.\nOn September 9th last Mrs. Smith (my wife), three young men and myself\nsat down with the palms of our hands on a small deal table in my house. In\na few minutes the table commenced to tilt. What follows is copied from a\nnote written immediately after the experiment and read over to all present\nat the sitting. I asked the questions, and in doing so, merely for conveni\nence, used the language and phraseology peculiar among Spiritualists on such\noccasions.\n1 The reference is to some experiments made by Professor Richet in thought-\ntransference by means of table-tilting. Here three persons, C, D and E, sat\nat a table, fitted with an electrical apparatus which rang a bell whenever the\ntable tilted. Two other persons, A and B, sat before an alphabet, screened\nfrom the view of C, D and E. A followed the letters of the alphabet in order\nwith a pen, returning to the beginning as soon as he had arrived at the end.\nB noted down the letters at which A was pointing every time the bell rang.\nA sixth person, F, apart both from the tilting table and the alphabet, con\ncentrated his mind on some word chosen by himself and unknown to the\nother five. Under these circumstances, the letters which were tilted out\nformed a more or less close approximation to the word of which F was think\ning.\nIt will be observed that in Mr. Smith's experiment the voluntary agent, F,\nwas absent.\u2014Ed.\n\fNov., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 319\nQ. : Will the influence which is controlling this table please tilt it once\nwhen \" No \" is meant and twice when \" Yes \" is meant ? A. : Yes (two tilts\nor raps). Q. : Is it a spirit that is controlling this table ? A. : Yes. Q. : Is\nit the spirit of a friend of anyone at the table ? A. : Yes.\nAfter a few more such questions and answers\u2014Q. : Will you please rap\n(tilt) the table when the letters of the alphabet are pointed to which spell\nout your name ? A. : Yes.\nI then asked Mrs. Smith to withdraw from the table and sit in a corner\nof the room about 6 ft. from the table, and to take a small book with the\nalphabet in it and commencing to point at \" A \" to move slowly towards the\nend and back to \" A \" again, and so on, observing at what letters the table\ntilted. Although she was visible to all at the table, yet she was so placed\nthat no one could form any idea of what letters were being pointed to. These\npreparations, which only took about a minute, being finished, we then\ncontinued.\nAlmost at once the table commenced to tilt at irregular short intervals,\nand when it had tilted 7 or 8 times, I being anxious to know whether any\nthing coherent was being spelled out, asked Mrs. Smith what were the results,\nand she answered that the table had tilted at the letters H-o-w-e-y J-a.\nThe name of a young man a few years deceased, and known by name at any\nrate to all at the table, was at once recognised, his name being James Howey.\nI then asked : Q. : Is it the spirit of James Howey ? A. : Yes. Q. : Have\nyou met your mother since she passed out ? A. : Yes. Q. : Is she with you\nnow ? A. : Yes. Q. : Does she wish to communicate ? A. : Yes. Q. :\nWith anyone at the table ? A. : No. Q. : With any of her family ? A. :\nYes. Q. : With Miss Howey ? A. : Yes. Q. : Will she rap (tilt) the\ntable when the letters of the alphabet are pointed to which spell out her\ncommunication ? A. : Yes. The table commenced to tilt again as before,\nbut it was not interrupted, and when it had stopped I asked what had been\nspelled out and Mrs. Smith replied '. \" Good and faithful \" had been spelled.\nQ. : Do you mean that Miss Howey is good and faithful ? A. : No. Q. : Do\nyou mean it as an injunction to her to be good and faithful ? A. : Yes. Q. :\nDo you wish to communicate further ? A. : Yes. Proceeding as before,\nthe table at once commenced tilting, and when it had ceased Mrs. Smith\nsaid it had spelled out : \" Mind father, and be sure of that.\" The experiment\nhere ended, and the striking aptness of the latter communications was much\nspoken of by the sitters.\nI should not have thought this worth writing out but for the fact that\nMrs. Smith, while pointing out the letters, sat away from the table and in\nsuch a position that no one at the table could form the faintest idea of what\nletters were being pointed to. These circumstances remove the case from the\nordinary run of table-tilting experiments.\nOf course I was aware of the imperfection of the arrangements, but they\ncould not be improved at the time, and I at once arranged for a further and\nmore testing experiment for the evening of September 13th. For this\noccasion I secured the assistance of two more young men, one of whom I\nintended should write down the letters rapped or tilted out, and the other to\nwitness that such was done correctly. I also arranged for the sitters at the\ntable to be in the room and those with the alphabet just outside the door\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1892.\n(which was almost shut) of such room. But I regret to say that, though the\ntable tilted quite briskly, and though we made several changes of persons\nfrom the table to the alphabet, and tried for about an hour, yet there could\nnot be found the least trace of coherence or intelligibility in the series of\nletters taken down as rapped out, although we tried them by inversion,\nanagrammatically, and by substituting neighbouring letters, as is done in\nthe case referred to in Phantasms of the Living. I have not further experi\nmented in this way.\nGeorge Main Smith, A.S.P.R.\n[The above experiments are interesting, not only as evidence of\nthought-transference, but as supporting the theory that telepathic\nimpressions are sometimes received unconsciously and become mani\nfest only when the percipient has some means of automatic expres\nsion. It is possible also that the unconscious or semi-conscious\nnature of the agency\u2014a peculiar feature of this case\u2014was an\nimportant factor in its success.\nWe hope that other members of the Society may be inclined to\ntry and report to us experiments under these or somewhat similar\nconditions.\u2014Ed . ]\nSUBLIMINAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE LAPSE OF TIME.\nMr. G. M. Smith, whose experiments in thought-transference\nare recorded in the preceding paper, sent us at the same time the\nfollowing communication : \u2014\nCustom House, Amble, Northumberland.\nOctober 12th, 1892.\nI may observe that I have for a long time had the belief that it was possible\nfor certain persons to wake from sleep at any appointed time ; and I have\nfor many years been able to do it myself, it being often necessary that I should\nget up and go out at stated and varying hours during the night.\nIn the experiments recorded below, the times of retiring, and proposed\nwaking, were recorded in writing before going to bed and the times of waking\nrecorded immediately I awoke. In order to make the experiments as testing\nas possible, I retired at irregular hours and, usually, appointed times of\nwaking remote from my usual hour of getting up (about 7 a.m.).\nI am rather surprised that the experiments are not more successful, but\nI feel that the fact that, behind my resolution to waken, I knew that there\nwas no actual necessity for my getting up at these untimely hours, was an\nunfavourable and potent factor, for although I have no record, I am per\nsuaded that an equal number of cases in which it has been really necessary\nthat I should get up would certainly show more success.\nI do not feel qualified to offer any comment on the general question, but\nI am of opinion that in the experiments here recorded there is an approxi\nmation to success which chance alone does not adequately explain.

Coincidental Impression.\nThe following case of an impression coinciding with an event\nof national importance, in which the percipient was not personally\ninterested, seems worth printing in connection with others of a\nsomewhat similar nature that were published in Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. II., pp. 365-7: \u2014\nOctober Sth, 1892.\nI have known and admired Tennyson's In Memoriam for some time, but\nit is very seldom that any parts of it have occurred to my memory, except at\nChristmas time, when some of the verses most appropriate to the season have\ncome into my thoughts.\nOn Wednesday, October 5th, 1892, I was staying at the small country-\nvillage of Broadway, Worcestershire, where I did not see the daily journals\nand was quite unaware that Lord Tennyson was ill, and he had not been for\nany other reason in my thoughts. I was myself in good health and spirits,\nand went to sleep almost immediately on getting into bed. I woke, however,\nsuddenly, somewhat to my surprise, about 1 a.m. on Thursday morning, with\na strong feeling of general depression and distress, for which I could find\nno cause, and my thoughts were turned towards death. Some lines from\nIn Memoriam, of which I seldom thought, came into my head :\u2014\nLast nigh1 (sic) I slept and woke with pain\nAnd almost wished no more to wake\nAnd that my hold on life would break\nBefore I heard those bells again.\nAnd\nWithin Vienna's fatal walls\nGod's finger touched him and he slept.\nAfter a time of vague but quite unique mental discomfort I lit a candle\nand found it was about 2 a.m. My thoughts did not turn towards any\nspecial person, and after about another half-hour I went to sleep again, and\nwoke as usual, after some five or six hours' quiet sleep, with a clear memory\nof what had passed but with no discomfort, and no further inclination to\nattribute this to any cause that I knew.\nAbout 24 hours afterwards [i.e., Friday morning, October 7th] I learnt\nthat Lord Tennyson had died about 1.30 a.m. on the morning of Thursday,\nOctober 6th. I had no personal acquaintance with him.\u2014A. A.\nThe Times of October 7th, 1892, prints the medical bulletin from\nwhich it appears that the hour of Lord Tennyson's death was 1.35\na.m. on Thursday, October 6th. It will be remembered that no\nalarm was expressed publicly with regard to his illness till the\nprevious Monday.\nThe above narrative was given verbally to Dr. A. T. Myers, on the\n\fNov., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 323\nevening of October 7th, and was written down by him and signed by\nMiss A. the next day.\nIn sending the account, he writes : \u2014\n[Miss A.] had heard little or nothing of such things, and told her story\nvery naively and with no sign of exaggeration. She has always had excellent\nhealth and spirits, and was very genuinely surprised at this queer fit of\nextreme depression and discomfort, and thoughts of death and In Mcmoriam,\nwhich were quite unique to her ; and next morning\u2014Thursday\u2014she was\nquite well and happy again.\nMiss A. did not mention her experience to anyone before hearing\nof Lord Tennyson's death.\nThe two following cases have a feature in common, namely, that\nthe appearance seems always to have been seen by different people in\nthe same way at the same place and from the same point of viewt\u2014\nsuggesting, of course, an optical illusion of some sort, though with\nour present information this must remain a matter of conjecture.\nIt is to be regretted that the records were both made so many years\nafter the experiences. We shall be glad if any of our readers can\ngive any information bearing on either case.\nG. 225.\nFrom a lady who does not wish to give her name. In answer to\none of Mr. Gurney's \" Census\" forms she wrote as follows: \u2014\nJanuary nth, 1885.\nAn appearance as of an old man rising from his chair and immediately van\nishing was perceived by me and a friend in a small inn [not far from]\nKeswick.1 We saw him only as we opened the door of the room. We made\nno inquiries as we were certain the proprietors would not give information\nlest their inn should be avoided.\nWe moved the rest of the furniture, rearranged the curtains and took\ngreat pains to fathom the mystery, but without success.\nWe did not see him when together or when we tried to see him.\nIn a subsequent letter, dated March 28th [1885], the same per\ncipient says : \u2014\nThe visual hallucination of which I spoke is the only one of the kind that\never happened to me.\nIt occurred in the autumn (September, I think) of the year 1867, at a\nlittle inn or hotel at . I was there two or three days. The figure of the\nold man in the armchair was perceptible only by daylight, and only upon\nentering the room. He appeared to vacate the chair when the door opened.\nI was not aware that my friend, now long dead, saw the figure, until she\nwas leaving the bedroom we jointly occupied, late at night, for a book she had\n1 The exact locality of the inn has been given in confidence.\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I then said, \" Take care of the old\nman in the chair,\" when rather to my consternation she exclaimed \" Have\nyou also seen it ? \" and evinced much agitation. We then agreed to ask\neach other alternate questions respecting the appearance, dress, manner,\noccupation, and found our impressions entirely coincided. You may imagine\nthat the book remained in the sitting-room.\nThe next day we endeavoured to see the figure simultaneously, but failed.\nWe moved the other articles of furniture, rearranged the curtains, took all\nsurrounding objects into consideration, but could discover no shadow or\naught else that could produce the appearance. We had neither of us visited\nthe inn before, nor heard of any tale attached to it. We made no inquiry,\nbeing certain that the proprietors of the place would give no information,\neven if they possessed any.\nThe only other member of our party was a gentleman to whom the appear\nance did not disclose itself. He is, however, very short-sighted.\nG. 226.\nTaken down by Mr. Gurney from the lips of Mrs. Beaumont, of\n1, Crescent-road, S. Norwood Park, about the year 1886, and signed\nby her.\n1, Crescent-road, S. Norwood Park.\nAbout 1860, 1 was staying with some friends at the Willows, near Kintbury,\nnear Hungerford. One morning I was sitting alone in the drawing-room ;\nthe window of the room was passed by anyone going to the hall door. I saw a\nlittle woman in brown pass the window, with her head turned away from it.\nAfter some minutes, not having heard anyone go to let her in, I went into\nthe hall and met the lady of the house [now dead] there, and I said to her,\n\" There is a lady at the front door, but I have not heard any of the servants\ngo to admit her.\" She said, \" Who is it ? \" I said, \" I don't know, but she\nwas dressed all in brown.\" \" Oh,\" she said, \" that's only the little brown\nlady. We often see her\u2014the children and all of us\u2014but we take no notice.\"\nThere was no tradition. The figure used always to appear in this way, pass\ning in front of the drawing-room window ; and however quickly they ran\nout nothing was to be seen.

See same No. of the Journal,\npp. 326-8.\nIt may be instructive to compare with these two cases the follow\ning account of a probably purely subjective hallucination: \u2014\nWhile walking home at about 7 o'clock, one evening, G. D. saw two gentle\nmen standing together on the opposite pathway. One of them he knew\n\fNov., 1892.] Journal of Society fen' Psychical Research. 325\nwell, the other was a stranger. The part of the road at which he had arrived\nwas clear of trees, flanked by a high wall without gates, and brightly lit by\nthe moon. G. D. was agreeably surprised to see the friend whom he supposed\nto be ill, and was about to cross over to him, but when he reached the centre\nof the road the two figures had vanished. He returned to the pathway he\nhad left, but looking toward the opposite side before resuming his walk,\ndistinctly saw the two figures exactly as he had seen them at first, and im\nputing the supposition that they had vanished to some temporary defect\nof vision he stepped into the road a second time. A second time the figures\ndisappeared, and after assuring himself that no one was there, G. D. returned\nto his starting point. Standing there he, for the third time, saw his friend\nand his friend's companion as distinctly as before. He waited some moments\nbut did not speak, and as his friend made no sign he went away. The man\nwho was known to him died a few days later.\nThe above account was written by Mr. G. W. Parker, a friend of\nMr. G. D. The latter endorses it as follows: \u2014\n\" I vouch for the absolute correctness of the foregoing statement.\"\n[Signed in full] G D .\nFebruary loth, 1891.\nThe Rev. C. A. Goodhart, who sent us this case, writes regarding\nit: \u2014\n\" [I am] well acquainted with the scene of [Mr. D.'s] experience. There is\nsimply a blank wall belonging to workhouse grounds, with the footway run\nning along the base of it. I am told [that] at the time the moon was full and\nthere were no shadows. An illusion\u2014such as that of the ' drinking foun\ntain ' in Carpenter's Mental Physiology\u2014seems hardly possible under the\ncircumstances.''\nThe close relationship of some hallucinations with illusions seems\nto be brought out by the consideration of cases such as these.\nAnother interesting illustration of the difficulty of drawing the line\nbetween hallucinations and illusions is to be found in a case printed\nin the Journal, Vol. III., p. 252, where an apparition of a woman in\nblack standing by a hallucinatory white marble cross is seen collec\ntively by three persons, but is only visible from a certain point of\nview. It was seen out of doors on a fine evening, and remained in\nsight for nearly an hour, from about 9 to 10 p.m.\u2014a very unusual\nlength of time for a hallucination to last. On the other hand, the\npercipients tried in vain to discover what could have produced such\nan illusion. The appearance does not seem to have been exactly the\nsame to all of them, but there was enough similarity to suggest that\n\u2014if not an illusion strictly speaking\u2014it originated for all of them in\nthe same points de repere.\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Mr. Hughes joined the\nS.P.R. in 1883, and for some years took an active part in the work\nof the Society. He acted for a time as Secretary to a Committee\nnominated by the Council for investigating the alleged Physical\nPhenomena of Spiritualism, and spent both time and ingenuity in\nthe endeavour to elucidate the subject.\nIn November, 1883, Mr. Hughes went, at the request of the\nCouncil, to Wem, in Shropshire, to inquire personally into a series\nof disturbances\u2014movements of furniture and crockery, and stone-\nthrowing\u2014which had excited much interest in the neighbourhood.\nHis careful report on the results of the inquiry is printed in the\nJournal for March, 1884. In the same year he assisted in drafting\na report on \"Haunted Houses\" (Proceedings, II., pp. 137 et seq.)\nand rendered valuable service by his acute analysis and criticism of\nthe evidence dealt with.\nHe was successful on more than one occasion as agent in thought-\ntransference, and records of some of his experiments are given in\nPhantasms of the Living, pp. 46-48.\nCircumstances prevented Mr. Hughes during the latter years of\nhis life from co-operating actively with us, but he remained an intel\nligent and sympathetic critic of the work of the Society.

Fearne Crowtheb.\nThe cutting referred to is from the Globe, October 14th, 1892, and is\nheaded, \" Experiments in Hypnotism. Alleged Remarkable Discoveries.\"\nIt runs :\u2014\n\" At the Charite Hospital in Paris, yesterday, the series of experiments\nwhich are being made by Dr. Luys of the ' exteriorisation ' of the human\nbody, were continued. A Dalziel representative was allowed to be present.\nSo complete was the exteriorisation of the subject that Dr. Luys was able to\ntransfer a woman's sensibility into a tumbler of water. The tumbler was\nthen taken out of sight of the hypnotised person, and the representative\nwas invited to touch the water ; and as his hands came in contact with it\nthe woman started as if in pain. This experiment was repeated several\ntimes, the requisite precaution being taken that the hypnotised subject\nshould not see the contact between the hands and the water. The water\nretained the sensibility a considerable time, and if drunk before the sensi\nbility is exhausted the patient falls into a swoon. Dr. Luys was also able\nto confirm the wonderful discovery made by Colonel Rochas, Administrator\nof the Ecole Polytechnique, who found that it was possible to transfer the\nsensibility of a hypnotised person to the negative of a photograph of the\nsubject, and that the subject not only felt, but showed signs of any mark\nmade on the negative. Supposing, for instance, a scratch was drawn with a\npin across the hand on the negative after it had been charged with sensibility,\nthe subject would shriek with pain, and a few instants later a mark similar\nto that made on the negative would be visible on the hands of the subject.\nDr. Luys tried the experiment yesterday several times with an extraordi\nnarily sensitive subject, now at the Charite, and each time with considerable\nsuccess. The experiments are creating a great deal of interest.\"\n[It seems clear, as our correspondent points out, that many more pre\ncautions than are described in the newspaper account would have to be taken\nbefore authorising the conclusion which Dr. Luys is represented to have\ndrawn from his experiments. The subject may have learnt when the water\nwas being touched by unconscious indications either from Dr. Luys or from\nany one else present who knew it, or even by thought-transference from\nthe person who touched the water, and may then have been affected as de\nscribed by suggestion from his operator. As Mr. Crowther remarks, the\nsuggestion may have been made unconsciously at the outset of the experi\nments, so that, on this hypothesis, it would not be necessary for Dr. Luys to\nbe aware at the time whether the water was being touched or not. But we\nawait an authoritative and detailed report of the experiments before forming\nany conclusion.\u2014Ed.]\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

We are indebted for it to Mr.\nEdmund Procter, son of Mr. Joseph Procter, who occupied the house\nat the time the disturbances occurred. It is a very complete and\ntypical case of what is commonly called \" haunting,\" consisting of\nunexplained noises, generally heard by all within earshot, and con\ntinued at intervals through a series of years, in the course of which\nvarious visual phantasms were seen by differnt people.\u2014Ed.]\nMr. Joseph Procter's Diary.\nThe \" Haunted House at Willington \" has been a familiar theme\non Tyneside for half a century, and the general public have been made\nacquainted with it in William Howitt's Visits to Remarkable Places,\nCatherine Crowe's Night Side of Nature, The Local Historian's Table\nBook, Stead's Ghost Stories, and other publications. I was myself\nborn in this \" haunted house,\" and have vivid recollections of many sin\ngular occurrences. As my parents, however, ceased to reside there\nwhen I was but a child of seven, any evidence of my own can be but\nof trifling value. On my father's death in 1875, a diary that he had\nkept almost from the outset of the disturbances, and during many\nyears of their occurrence, was found among his papers. The publica\ntion of this diary has been delayed for two reasons : first, my mother's\nobjection to their publicity during her lifetime : secondly, because the\nmanuscript breaks off suddenly, and I have long hoped, but in vain,\nto find the continuation and conclusion. To such readers as were not\npersonally acquainted with the writer of this diary I may briefly state\nthat he was a member of the Society of Friends, belonging to a family\nwhich had been attached members of that body from its very founda\ntion. During many years he was an \"overseer\" or \"elder,\" and was\nfrequently appointed to offices of trust in church matters. Like many\nother Quakers, he took an active interest in the Peace Society, the\nAnti-Slavery Society, and other philanthropic organisations. He was\nalso among the earliest teetotallers in the north of England.\nHis reading was fairly extensive, the Quarterly and Edinburgh being\nsandwiched with George Fox's Journal and the old Examiner, and\nEbenezer Elliot taken alternately with some French author or the\nBritish Friend. I mention these details solely to place outsiders in a\nposition to judge of the character and the reliability of the writer of\nthe diary, and will only add my own testimony that a man with a\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. {Dec, 1892.\nmore delicate sense of what it means to speak the truth I have yet to\nmeet.\nIt only remains to add that throughout the narrative \" J. P.\"\nstands for my father himself, and \" E. P.\" for my mother, and that\nthe paragraphs between brackets are my own additions. The earliest\nstatement I can find is the following, in his own handwriting :\u2014\nParticulars relating to some unaccountable noises heard in the house of\nJ. and E. Procter, Wellington Mill, which began about three months prior\nto the present time, viz., 1 mo. 28th, 1835, still continuing, and for which no\nadequate natural cause has hitherto been discovered.\nAbout six weeks ago the nursemaid first told her mistress of the state of\ndread and alarm she was kept in, in consequence of noises she had heard for\nabout two months, occurring more particularly nearly every evening when\nleft alone to watch the child [my eldest brother, then about two years old] to\nsleep in the nursery, a room on the second floor ; she declared she distinctly\nheard a dull heavy tread on the boarded floor of the unoccupied room above,\ncommonly pacing backwards and forwards, and, on coming over the window,\ngiving the floor such a shake as to cause the window of the nursery to rattle\nviolently in its frame. This disturbance generally lasted ten minutes\nat a time, and though she did not heed it at first, yet she was now persuaded\nit was supernatural, and \" it quite overset her.\" The latter was indeed\nevident from the agitation she manifested.\nThe kitchen girl said that the nursemaid had called her upstairs some\ntimes when frightened in this manner, aud that she had found her trem\nbling much and very pale. On examining her further in reference to this\nimprobable tale, she did not vary in her statement, but on searching the\nrooms above and finding nothing to cause such results, but little credit was\nattached to the story.\nBefore many days had elapsed, however, every member of the family had\nwitnessed precisely what the girl described, and from that time to the\npresent, nearly every day, and sometimes several times in the day, the same\nhas been heard by one or more of the inmates, varying unimportantly in the\nnature of the sound. A few particular instances may here be selected, in\nwhich imagination or fear could have no influence.\nOn sixth day, 1st month 23rd, 1835, my wife had in the forenoon\nrequested one of the servants to sweep out the disturbed room in the course\nof the day, and being herself in the nursery [the room below] after dinner,\nheard a noise in the room like a person stirring about, which she took for\ngranted was the maid cleaning out the chamber, when, to her surprise, she\nafterwards found that neither of the girls had been upstairs at all. The next\nday one of the maids, being in the nursery, supposed, from the noise she\nheard, that the other was lighting the fire in the room above, as had been\ndesired, which proved a similar mistake to that on the preceding day. It\nmay be remarked that the nursemaid first mentioned had left, and another\nengaged, from whom the affair was carefully concealed. A day or two after\nher arrival the noise was observed by her fellow servant whilst they were\ntogether in the nursery, but she apparently did not observe it herself, from\n\fDec., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 333\nher companion talking and using the rocking-chair. Later, however, the\nsame evening it began suddenly when she was present, and she, some\nwhat alarmed, inquired who or what was in the room above.\nOn First day, the 25th, being kept at home by indisposition, my wife was\nin the nursery about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and heard on the floor\nabove, about the centre of the room, a step as of a man with a strong shoe or\nboot going towards the window and returning. The same day, when we were\nat dinner, the maid, being with the child in the nursery, heard the same\nheavy tread for about five minutes ; she came into the sitting-room to\nsatisfy herself that her master was there, thinking it must have been he who\nwas upstairs. The following day the dull sound was resumed, and up to this\nday the boots have not done duty again. It may be noted that frequently\nthe room has been examined immediately after the occurrence of the noise ;\nit has been sat in, in one instance slept in all night, and in every case\nnothing has been elicited. Several of our friends who have waited to hear\nthe invisible disturber have all, with one exception, been disappointed.\nMy brother, John Richardson Procter,* remained in the room below\nsome time after the usual period of operation, fruitlessly, but within ten\nminutes of his departure the nurse was so terrified by the loudness of its\nonset that she ran downstairs with the child half asleep in her arms. My\n.cousin, Mary Unthank, stayed two nights and was much in the room without\nbeing gratified. All the persons who have heard, and six have been so far\nprivileged, are confident that the noise is within the room on the third floor,\nas the precise part of the floor above on which the impression is made is\nclearly distinguishable through the ceiling below, and the weight apparently\nlaid on, shaking violently the window in the room below, when no other\nwindow in the house is affected, and during a dead calm, is of itself a proof\nof this.\nIt seems impossible there can be any trick in the case ; there is a garret\nabove, and the roof is inaccessible from without ; the house stands alone,\nand during most of the time the window was built up with lath and plaster,\nwhilst the only other communication with the outside, by the chimney, was\nclosed by a fireboard which was so covered over with soot as to prove that\nnot a pebble or a mouse had passed. The room is devoid of furniture, and\nfor some time the door was nailed up. Not a rat has been seen in the house\nfor years, nor at any time anything heard like a scratch or squeak, or\nrunning between the floor and ceiling ; nor, it is conceived, could a hundred\nrats so shake the floor by their weight as to cause the window below to\nrattle as it does.\nThe noise has been heard at every hour of the day, though oftenest in\nthe evening, rarely in the night ; has no connection with weather nor with\nthe going of the mill ; [the mill was contiguous, but there was a road\nbetween it and the house] in short, it is difficult to imagine a natural\ncause having a shadow of pretension to belief.\nThose who deem all intrusion from the world of spirits impossible in the\npresent constitution of things will feel assured that a natural solution of\n* A portrait and biographical notice of this brother will be found in Quaker\nRecords, by Mrs. A. O. Boyce.\n*\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1892.\nthe difficulty will still be obtained on further investigation ; whilst those who-\nbelieve with the poet \" that millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth\nunseen,\" and that, even in modern times, amidst a thousand creations of\nfancy, fear, fraud, or superstition, there still remain some well-attested\ninstances iu which good or evil spirits have manifested their presence by\nsensible tokens, will probably deem it possible that this may be referred to\nthe latter class\u2014especially when they learn that several circumstance*\ntending to corroborate such a view are withheld from this narrative.\nWhether the \" several circumstances withheld \" are disclosed in\nthe written narratives which follow I am unable to say. I find the\nfollowing consecutive\nAdditional particulars relating to unaccountable noises, &c., heard at\nWillington Mill, containing the most remarkable from first month 25th, tot\nthe present time, second month 18th, 1835.\nOn First day night, the 31st of first month, soon after retiring to bed,\nbefore going to sleep, my wife and I both heard ten or twelve obtuse\ndeadened beats as of a mallet on a block of wood, apparently within two feet\nof the bed curtain, on one side by the crib in which the child was laid. The\nnext night, before undressing, I had hushed the child asleep in his crib, and\nwhile leaning over it with one hand laid upon it and listening to some indis\ntinct sounds overhead, which had juat ceased, I heard a tap on the cradle\nleg as with a piece of steel, and distinctly felt the vibration of the wood in\nmy hand from the blow. This might be a sudden crack not unfrequent\nwhen wood is drying in, but it sounded like a knock on the outside. Since\nthis time the walking in the empty room has not been heard oftener than\ntwice or thrice, of which this afternoon was the last time.\nOn the same evening I heard that Thomas Mann, the foreman of the\nmill\u2014a man of strict integrity and veracity, who has been two years in\nUnthank and Procter's employ\u2014had heard something remarkable, and on\nquestioning him elicited the following statement. It may be premised that\nU. and P. have a wooden cistern on iron wheels to bring water for\ntheir horses, which stands in the mill yard. When in motion, drawn by\na horse to be filled, it makes a very peculiar noise which may be heard a con\nsiderable distance, especially when the wheels want greasing, and by any\nperson accustomed to it the noise of its going could not be mistaken for that\nof any other vehicle. The mill was going all night, and T. M.'s place\nwas to attend the engine till 2 a.m. Going out to fill the barrow with\ncoals about one o'clock, he heard this machine, as he thought, going along\nthe yard, which did not at the moment strike him as out of the usual course ;\nbut remembering the hour, the apprehension that it was being stolen flashed\non his mind ; it was creaking excessively, from want of oil as might be sup\nposed, and was then drawing near the yard gates, towards which he pursued\nafter it, when, to his astonishment, he found it had never stirred from its\nplace near where he at first was, and looking round everywhere all was still\nand not a creature to be found. He afterwards searched round the premises\nwith a lantern but descried nothing. He was much puzzled, but it was not\ntill the next day that he felt himself compelled to attribute the phenomenon\nto a supernatural cause.\n\fDec, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 335\nMore than once I have, on coming through the garden at night, heard a\nsound like someone stepping down the gravel walk and have not been able\nto discover anyone. This step on the gravel has been heard by one or two\nothers, but nothing seen.\nOn First day, 2 mo., 15th [1835], my wife and I were informed by our\ncousin Unthanks that they understood that the house, and that room\nin particular in which the noises now occurred, was said to be haunted\nbefore they entered it in 1806, but that nothing that they knew of had been\nheard during their occupancy of 25 years.\nOn the same page as the above, and in my father's handwriting, is\nthe following memorandum below the above recital ; there is a line\ndrawn through them, however, whether by myself I am unable to say,\nand the sentence is apparently unfinished :\u2014\nAn infirm old woman, the mother-in-law of It. Oxon, the builder of the\npremises, lived and died in the house, and after her death the haunting was\nattributed\nI have heard my father speak of this circumstance, but the\nevidence appeared to be of a slight and hearsay character.\nI find the following occurrence described on a separate sheet of\npaper, but believe, although it is not dated, that this is the correct\nsequence of the manuscript. I have myself heard all the particulars\nfrom the lips of all the parties concerned, which completely agreed with\nthis account in my father's handwriting.\nFor about two months previously there had rarely been 24 hours\nwithout indications by noises, &c., not in any other way accountable,\nof the presence of the ghostly visitant, to some or all of the inmates. A\nfew days previously a respectable neighbour had seen a transparent white\nfemale figure in a window in the second storey of the house. On the 13th of\nlast month (November), early in the evening, two of the children in the\nhouse, one aged about 8, the other under two years, both saw, unknown\nto each other, an object which could not be real, and which went into the\nroom where the apparition was afterwards seen, and disappeared there. A\nnear connection of the family on a visit [my mother's sister], but for whom,\nfor obvious reasons, a lodging was obtained at the house of Thomas Mann\n(the foreman of the flour mill adjoining, and much respected by his\nemployers), went out as usual to sleep about 9.30 p.m. Soon after going to\nher bedroom T. M.'s wife went out of the house for some coals, and\nwas struck with a figure in the window previously referred to [nothing being\nbetween the two houses but a kitchen garden and a road] ; she called her\nhusband, who saw the same figure passing backwards and forwards and then\nstanding still in the window. It was very luminous and likewise transparent,\nand had the appearance of a priest in a white surplice. T. M. then\ncalled out the relative of the family and his own daughter. When they came\nthe head was nearly gone and the brightness somewhat abated, but it was\nfully ten minutes before it quite disappeared by fading gradually down\nwards. Both when standing and moving it was about 3 feet from the\nfloor of the room. T. M. went down close under the window, and\n\f336 Jowrnal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec., 1892.\nalso went to inform the inmates of the circumstance, but finding they had\nlocked-up for the night did not accomplish it. It was a dark night, without\na moon, and there was not a ray of light, nor any person anywhere near the\nhouse. The window blind was close down, and the figure seemed to come\nthrough both it and the glass, as had the brightness been all inside of the\nglass the framing of the window would have intervened, which was not\nvisible. In walking the figure seemed to enter the wall on each side. The\noccupier of the house [my father] slept in that room, and must have gone in\nshortly after the disappearance of the apparition.\n[My aunt, the \"near connection\" referred to above, Mrs. Christiana\nWright, of Mansfield, who is still living, has read the manuscript of this\nincident this year (1892). She has corrected it in two or three unimportant\ndetails, but otherwise confirms it as strictly according to her own\nobservation.]\nThe following account of my father's has no year stated, but it\nappears to be about this time. J. C. is my mother's sister, Jane Carr,\nof Carlisle.\nOn the 16th of 12th mo., a little before twelve o'clock at night,\nJ. C. and her bedfellow were disturbed by a noise similar to the winding\nup of a clock, apparently on the stairs where the clock stands, which con\ntinued for the space of ten minutes. When that ceased footsteps were\nheard in the room above, which is unoccupied, for perhaps a quarter of an\nhour ; whilst this was going on the bed was felt to shake, and J. C.\ndistinctly heard the sound like a sack falling on the floor above. On\nthe 3rd of 1st month, about 12 o'clock at night, J. C. being quite\nawake, was disturbed by a noise similar to a person knocking quickly and\nstrongly five times on a piece of board in the room ; when that ceased she\ndistinctly heard the sound of a footstep close by the side of her bed. About\nthe beginning of the year J. P. was awoke by a sound like a bullet lodged\nin the floor above or in the wall of his bedroom, and looked at his watch to\nascertain the time ; he found next morning that his wife in the next room\nwas awoke by the same sound.\nAbout the 21st inst. E. P. and nurse Pollard both felt themselves raised\nup and let down three times. [My mother has described this experience to\nme ; she said the bed was lifted up as if a man were underneath pushing it\nup with his back. She did not speak to nurse Pollard, nor the nurse to her,\neach thinking the other was asleep ; this not being disclosed until breakfast\ntime.] On the 15th, about 8 p.m., J. P., jun., who had been in bed about\nhalf an hour, called on someone to come to him and begged for a light ; he\nsaid that something under the crib raised him up very quickly many times,\nand wished to know what it could be. On the 11th of 1st mo., whilst\nthe servants were at dinner, E. P. was lying on the sofa in her lodging-\nroom when she felt the floor to vibrate as from a heavy foot in an adjoining\nroom ; in the writing-room underneath J. C. at the same time heard the\nsound of a person walking backwards and forwards in the room above.\nSoon after this E. P. heard the sound of a closet door in the room above\nshutting three times, after which footsteps came into the middle of the room\n\fDec, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 337\nand then all was silent. E. P. feels assured there was nobody upstairs at\nthe time. On the 17th, at 7 p.m., the two elder children and two nurse\nmaids were in the nursery when a loud clattering or jingling was heard in\nthe room ; it sounded from the closet ; the girls were very much terrified,\nas was also Jane P., who is four years and a half old. Little Joseph, per\nceiving his sister affrighted, endeavoured to calm her by saying, \"Never\nmind, Jane; God will take care of thee.\" Some weeks before this little\nJoseph said in the morning to his aunt, Jane Carr, who was sleeping with\nhim, that he was a long time in getting to sleep the night before from some\npeople walking very fast in the room above ; he wondered who it could be.\nThis was an unoccupied room. One night, whilst sleeping in a crib in his\nparents' room, he awoke his father to say that somebody had stepped close to\nhis bed. One night about this time J. P. heard, early in the morning, a\nnoise as of wood moving from the middle to one side of the boarded floor of\nthe empty room above ; after which he heard a loud beating in the mill\nyard. Another night he heard two very peculiar sounds as of whistling or\nwhizzing. [I have sometimes heard my father imitate this peculiar and\nhorrid sound.] About 11 o'clock on the night of the 23rd, J. C. and\nher little bedfellow heard a succession of thumps or blows in the empty\nroom above which continued for the space of ten minutes. A little after one\no'clock the same night J. P. was awakened by a single beat or blow in the\nroom above, after which one of the chairs in his own room seemed shifted.\nOn the night of the 26th J. P. heard the sound of footsteps in the attic,\nand afterwards as of setting things down in the room above, from about\n11.30 p.m. to 2 a.m. A little after eleven he had heard several prolonged\nand peculiar whistles which were also heard by the nurse in another room ;\nthey seemed to come from the landing ; she had described it without know\ning that J. P. had heard it. Joseph was shaken in his crib early the same\nnight.\nOn the 27th no one slept in the third storey ; about eleven o'clock Jane\nC. and the nursemaid heard in the room above the sound of some person\nwith strong shoes sometimes walking, sometimes running backwards and\nforwards, moving chairs and clashing down box lids, aud sometimes thump\ning as with a fist. These sounds also moved on to the stair-head. About\nmidnight J. C. felt the bed raised up under one side as if to turn her over,\ngiving two lifts. Nurse Pollard in another room on the same floor heard a\nnoise which roused her as she was going to sleep ; something then pressed\nagainst the high part of the curtain and came down on to her arm, which was\nweighed down with the same force ; in great terror she called out, \" Lord,\nhave mercy upon me ! \" Nothing further occurred to her that night, nor\nwas the maid who slept with her aroused.\n2nd month, 3rd. On nearly every day or night since the last entry\nmore or less has been heard that could be referred to no other than the same\ncause ; amongst them the following may be noted : Joseph and Henry have\nbeen several times disturbed in their cribs during the evening ; once they\nheard a loud shriek which seemed to come from near the foot of the bed.\nOn going up Joseph was found trembling and perspiring from the fright.\nOne evening J. P. heard a very peculiar moan or cry in the same room ; also\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1892.\nJ. and E. P. and Jane C. heard footsteps and noises which ceased on running\nupstairs to prevent the children being frightened. Another time Joseph\nsaid his bed moved backwards and forwards ; also a voice by the foot of the\nbed said, \" Chuck \" twice, and then made a noise like a child sucking. He\ndescribes other voices ; he is very inquisitive as to the origin of these noises,\nand says he never heard or felt anything like it whilst we lived at Shields.\nIt may be proper to mention that neither he nor any of the children have\nany idea of anything supernatural. Jane sleeps in another room ; she told\nher mother that she felt the bed go up and down, and other things of that\nkind, not having heard of her brother Joseph, or any of us, having felt any\nthing of the same kind.\nAbout the 30th J. and B. P. heard loud thumps in the room above, also\nfootsteps in the night, when they knew no one was upstairs, as the cook\nwas at that time sleeping for company with the nurses on the second floor.\nA day or two later, about six in the evening, whilst the servants were at tea\nin the kitchen, E. P. and J. C, whilst in the nursery on the second floor,\nheard what seemed to be heavy pieces of wood jarring on the floor above.\n2nd mo., 1st. About 11 p.m. some little time after all had gone to\nbed, the sound of chairs, &c., being moved about on the kitchen floor was\nheard.\n2nd mo., 4th. Jane C. had been poorly, and was awake about\n4.30 a.m., as well as her companion, when they heard footsteps descending\nfrom the upper storey which passed their door and went down into the\nkitchen ; they thought it was the cook and wondered at her being so early.\nThey then heard the sound of the kitchen door opening and then of the\nkitchen window being thrown up and the shutters opened with more than\nusual noise. About seven o'clock they were surprised by the cook calling\nat their room for a light ; having been up early to do washing the previous\nmorning she had this time overslept herself. She had clearly not yet been\ndownstairs.\nIn the afternoon of the same day Jon. D. Carr [my mother's brother of\nCarlisle] came to the house and stayed all night, sleeping alone on the\nsecond storey. Soon after going to bed he heard noises in the room above,\nas of a piece of wood or a balance rapidly striking each end on the floor ;\nafterwards many beats as with a mallet, some very loud ; also like a person\nstamping in a passion. He also heard a peculiar whistle, which he imitated\nso as exactly to resemble what J. P. heard some time before ; he further\nheard a noise on the stairs and landing, and for some time felt his bed to\nvibrate very much ; he put his hand down to the stock and felt it shaking.\nThis suddenly ceased. He was quite awake and collected, indeed did not\nsleep till two o'clock though unusually disposed to it. He said in the morn\ning he would not live in the house for any money.\nThe account he gave to Jonathan Carr [his father] induced the latter to\ncome over from Carlisle next morning to see if he could assist with his\nadvice under such disagreeable and dangerous disturbances.\n[I can find no other allusion to my grandfather's visit among my father's\npapers.]\n\fi>ec, 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 339\nOn 2nd mo., 5th, between 11 and 12 at night, Jane C. heard a thump\noon the landing near the bedroom door, upon which she awoke her com\npanion, Mary Young. [This was the cook whom my aunt had to\nsleep with her, not daring to sleep alone in such a house ; she was a most\nrespectable and intelligent woman whom I well remember ; she was eight\nyears in my mother's service when she married the principal tradesman in\nthe village.] Mary Young heard the slot in the door apparently slide back,\nthe handle to turn and the door to open. A rushlight was burning on the\ndressing-table, but the bed was an old four-poster, and the curtains being\ndrawn, nothing could be seen. A step then went to the rushlight, and\nappeared by the sound to snuff it and then lay down the snuffers. In the\nact of snuffing the light was transiently obscured, as when that act is\ncustomarily performed. Jane C. then felt it raise up the clothes over her\ntwice ; then they both heard something rustle the curtains as it went round\nthe bed ; on getting to Mary Young's side she distinctly saw a dark shadow\non the curtain. On getting to the bed-board where Jane C. lay a loud thump\nas with a fist was heard on it ; something was then felt to press on the\ncounterpane on M. Young's side of the bed, the bed curtain being pushed\nin but nothing more seen. Whatever the visitor might be was then heard\nto go out, seeming to leave the door open. In the morning they found the\ndoor still bolted as it was left when they went to bed. In this occurrence\nJane C. heard and felt everything described, but having her head under the\nbedclothes could not see the shadow as her companion did. [I have on three\nor four occasions heard a graphic account of this night of horror both from\nmy aunt Jane Carr in later life, and from Mary Young some years after her\nmarriage. The description they both gave exactly agreed with the above\nnarrative from my father's pen except that one or both of them stated that\na few minutes after the dreadful unknown visitor left the room they arose,\nfound the door locked as when they came to bed, and searched the room in\nevery way. This is the only discrepancy I notice. One would naturally\nexpect that my aunt would refuse to stay longer in the house after such an\nexperience, but such was not the case ; she was, as I remember her to be,\na woman of strong nerve, of very cheerful temper, and not easily disturbed.\nShe died on board the steamer Prussian Eagle, in Plymouth Sound, in\n1859.]\nOn the 7th J. C. heard the noise of a box trailed over the floor above the\nnursery when she was certain no one was upstairs, the servants being at\ndinner in the kitchen and the rest of the family in the parlour downstairs.\nOn the previous night there had been unaccountable thumpings and bed-\nshakings but nothing of special note.\nFrom 2nd mo., 6th to the 20th, nothing particular has been heard ; but\nJane, about 4\u00a3 years old, told her parents that when sleeping with her aunt\nshe one night saw by the washstand at the foot of the bed where the curtains\nwere open, a queer looking head, she thought of an old woman ; she saw her\nhands with two fingers of each hand extended and touching each other ; she\nhad something down the sides of her face and passed across the lower part of\nit. She saw it plainly though it was darkish in the room. She was afraid\nand put her head under the clothes and by-and-bye fell asleep. On the 17th,\n\f340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

P. was asleep, E. P. felt a\nheavy pressure which unnerved her very much ; it seemed to take her breath\naway and she felt quite sick after it, but did not tell J. P. of it until the\nmorning. Some night previous E. P. was awoke by feeling a pressure on th&\nface over the eye, of icy coldness ; it was suddenly laid on with a good deal\nof force and as suddenly withdrawn.

About 5 a.m. E. P. was awake when several beats were\nfelt on one side of the room, which awoke J. P. ; a vibration was felt in the\nroom, the bed shook considerably and the curtain rings rattled. The knockst\nwere repeated on the floor above.\nOn the night of the 5th E. P. heard what appeared to be a heavy box\nturned over twice in the room above where no one was sleeping and the\nentire household being asleep except herself, and everything still.\n[I omit several memoranda about this time as to the children and servants\nhearing voices and sounds of various descriptions.]\n3rd mo., 13th, 1840. Since the last entry Joseph has heard the sound\nof a thick stick being broken in his room ; of a stepping backwards and\nforwards ; of his name being called, &c. About the same date J. and E. P.\nheard unaccountable drummings and vibrations ; also the sound of someone\nstirring in the closet.\nOn the 21st J. and E. P. heard a handbell rung upstairs ; they were\nquite satisfied at the time that no one was there. On the 28th heavy thumps\nin the middle of the night, and after breakfast the next morning E. P. heard\na handbell rung upstairs when she was quite certain everyone was down\nstairs. J. and E. P. are sure it is no actual bell in the house that is rung, the\ntone being altogether different. Joseph has been disturbed nearly every\nnight lately ; he says when there is nobody upstairs the voices are loud; he-\nis now afraid of going into his room in the daytime. The words he reports\nas being uttered, such as \" Never mind \"\u2014\" Come and get,\" seem to have no-\nparticular application. To-night he has heard footsteps twice, and felt a\nbat on his pillow. At the time two of the servants were at a temperance\nmeeting, the other in the kitchen. [The inference that my brother was\nsimply dreaming, or else shamming, so as to get some one to come beside\nhim, will no doubt readily occur to some minds.

The hero, Dr. Drury, a practitioner then well known in\nSunderland, had obtained leave to sit up all night on the stairs with a\nfriend, during the absence of the family except my father and onet\nservant. He had wished to bring a loaded musket and a dog with him -r\nmy father objected to firearms, but consented to the dog.^\nWillington. Seventh day, evening.\nDear Elizabeth, . . . Last night Dr. Drury came with T. Hudson, a\nshopman of Joseph Ogilvie, chemist, and no dog. After a long chat they sat\non the high landing ; I went to my own bed ; Bell in the Camp room. About\none o'clock I heard a most horrid shriek from E. D., slipped on my trousers\nand went up. He had then swooned, but come to himself again in a state\nof extreme nervous excitement, and accompanied with much coldness and\nfaintness. He had seen the G. ; had been struck speechless as it advanced\nfrom the closet in the room over the drawing-room to the landing, and then\nleapt up with an awful shriek and fainted. The other young man had his\nhead laid against the easy-chair and was dozing, and as the G. made no noise\nin coming up he did not awake till the yell of his friend called him to his help.\nI called up Bell to make on the fires, get coffee, &c., but he continued in\na shocking state of tremour for some hours, though not irrational. He had\na ghastly look and started at the smallest sound\u2014could not bear to see any\nthing white ; he had not been in the least sleepy, and was not at all fright\nened till the moment when the G. met his gaze. They had both previously\nheard several noises, but all had been quiet for about a quarter of an hour,\nand E. D. was thinking of getting his companiou to go to bed, not expecting\nanything more that night. . . . E. D. has got a shock he will not soon\ncast off.

Our servants for some time have\nshown no symptoms of timidity, and seemed to have no apprehension of any\nrecurrence of former visitations. E. P. has not been well lately, and has\nthought she observed something in the demeanour of the servants indicative\nof fear within a day or two past ; on questioning them this afternoon they\nsaid the ghost had come back, but they wished to keep it from her if possible,\nas she was poorly. On the 29th, about 9 p.m., J. P., hearing Joseph call,\nand going upstairs, heard a rustling, like a female running out of the room,\nbut saw no one and was satisfied no one was there. Joseph said his name\nhad been called several times from near the foot of the bed in a voice like\nhis own. That night J. and E. P. heard a drumming and tapping in\ndifferent parts of their room ; at one momeut it seemed to be something\nheavy falling on the floor of the room above, then on the floor of the room\nadjoining, where it awoke the youngest child, and then to pounce down in\nthe room below on the ground floor. [I have frequently heard my father\ndescribe this peculiar case.]\n6 mo., 1st.\u2014The two maids, Davis and E. Mann, report they were\nunable to sleep before 2 a.m. from constant noises, particularly the\napparent treading of bare feet backwards and forwards at the foot of their\nbed, the noise several times awaking the youngest child ; sometimes the\ntread seemed to pass out on to the landing and run up and down stairs.\nThe nursery door was of course bolted.\n7th day, 11 mo., 13th, 1841.\u2014About 4.30 p.m. Joseph, now eight\nyears old, was in the nursery with his brothers and sisters ; he had\nseated himself on the top of a chest of drawers and was making a pretended\nspeech to them, when he suddenly jumped down, and the nursery door being\najar, J. P., who was in his own bedroom adjoining, heard him exclaim there.\nwas a monkey, and that it had pulled his leg by his shoe-strap. J. P. did\nnot himself see the monkey, but coming out of his room saw the children\npeering under the curtains of the bed in the Blue-room where, they alleged,\nthe animal had disappeared. Joseph afterwards stated that the monkey had\ngiven a sharp pull at his shoe-strap, and had tickled his foot ; he did not\nsuppose any other but it was a real monkey. Edmund, who is under two\nyears old, was frightened a short time before by what he called a \" funny\ncat,\" and showed a good deal of timidity the rest of the evening, looking\nunder chairs, &c., lest it should be lurking there, and it is to be noted that\nhe has no fear of a cat.\n[Now it so happens that this monkey is the first incident in the lugubri\nous hanntings, or whatever they may be termed, of which I have any recol\nlection.

We saw it go under the\nbed in that room, but it could not be traced or found anywhere after\nwards. We hunted and ferretted about that room, and every coiner of\nthe house, but no monkey, or any trace of one, was more to be found. I\ndon't know what to make of such a visitation, and have no explanation to\noffer ; but that it was a monkey, that it disappeared under the bed in the\nBlue-room that Saturday afternoon, and was never seen or heard of again\u2014\nof this, not merely from my own childish recollection, but from the repeated\nconfirmation of my brothers and sisters in after life, I am perfectly certain.\nI am merely recording facts as simply as I can ; readers may smile or mock\nas seemeth good unto them\u2014I cannot alter what has taken place to suit\neither them or anyone else.]\nOn the 26th of 10th mo., 1841, about 9 a.m., Joseph and Henry were\nplaying at the foot of the stairs ; they both saw a white face looking down\nupon them over the stair rails leading to the garret. Joseph called for\nhis aunt, Christiana Carr, to come and see it, but just as she was coming he\nsaw it hop away. Henry heard it give a great jump, but Joseph, being\nvery dull of hearing, did not. They both agreed in the description of what\nthey saw.\nOn First day evening, 19th of 12th, 1841, about 8 o'clock, E. P. and her\nsister, Christiana Carr, were in the nursery with the infant, and heard a\nheavy step coming up the stairs. They at first thought it might be J. P.,\nbut recollected that he had put on his slippers, and the step was with heavy\nashoes ; it seemed to pass into the adjoining room in which were some of the\nchildren asleep. They soon heard sounds in that room as of something heavy\nfalling, and by-and-bye Henry, about five years old, began to cry as if\nafraid. The only maid then at home came up to him, when he could not\nspeak for a length of time for sobbing ; at last he said something spoke to\nhim, and had also made noises with the chairs.\nAbout the middle of 11th mo., 1841, Christiana Carr went with Eliz.\nMann into a bedroom about 10 p.m. They heard a heavy labouring breath\ning, first at the far side of the room and then very near them, the floor at\nthe same time shaking with a constant vibration. They hastily retired.\nOn the 24th of 11th mo. Joseph, who had gone to bed about 8 o'clock,\npresently called on his father in some alarm ; he said a man had just been in\nwho went to the window, threw up the sash, put it down again and then\nwalked out ; he had light or grey hair and no hat on. He was astonished\nJ. P. had not met him. Within a few minutes he called out again ; he had\nheard a step from the door to the closet at the far side of the room where he\nheard something like a cloak fall. He durst not look up to see who it was.\n[If any readers exclaim that these are but the dreams and nightmares of\nchildren, I will only remind them that I am simply transcribing from my\nfather's diary, written on the dates given by his own hand, and that they\n.must form their own conclusions.\n\f344 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

P. was asleep, Jane Oarr [her mother] heard a sound\nlike a continued pelting of small substances which at first she took for cin\nders from the fire ; afterwards, as she sat up in bed, with a light burning,\nand seeing nothing, she heard the sound of somebody going gently about the\nfloor, the dress rustling as it passed from one part of the room to another.\nOn or about the 1st of 11th mo. E. P. awoke at night, heard the sound of\nan animal leaping down off the easy-chair which stood near the bed ; there\nwas no noise of its getting up and running off, but a dead silence.\n7 mo., 14th, 1841.\u2014J. and E. P. heard the spirit in their own room,\nand in the room overhead, making a noise as of something heavy being-\nhoisted or rolled, or like a barrel set down on its end ; also noises in the\nOamp-room of various and most unaccountable character. Edmund, who ia\nabout a year and a half old, roused up with every symptom of being dread\nfully frightened ; he screamed violently, was a very long time in sleeping\nagain, and frequently awoke in a fright ; he became feverish and continued\nso all the following day, seemed frightened at the sight of his crib, and\nalarmed at any noise he did not understand.\n8 mo., 3rd.\u2014Since the last date there have been few nights during\nwhich some branch of the family has not heard our visitor. One night\nJ. P. was awoke and heard something hastily walk, with a step like that\nof a child of 8 or 10 years, from the foot of the bed towards the side of\nthe room, and come back seemingly towards the door, in a run ; then it\ngave two stamps with one foot ; there was a loud rustling as of a frock or\nnight-dress. I need scarcely say the door was locked, and I am quite certain\nthere was no other human being in the room but E. P., who was asleep.\nThe two stamps roused E. P. out of her sleep. About this time Joseph, on\ntwo or three occasions, said he had heard voices from underneath his bed\nand from other parts of the room, and described seeing on one occasion a\nboy in a drab hat much like his own, the boy much like himself too, walking\nbackwards and forwards between the window and the wardrobe. He wast\nafraid but did not speak.\nNoises as of a band-box falling close at hand, as of someone running\nupstairs when no one was there, and like the raking of a coal rake, were\nheard about this time by different members of the family.\n8 mo., 6th.\u2014On the night of the 3rd, just after the previous memo\nrandum was written, about 10.30 p.m., the servants having all retired to\nbed, J. and E. P. heard a noise like a clothes-horse being thrown down\nin the kitchen. Soon the noises became louder and appeared as though\nsome persons had burst into the house on the ground floor and were clashing\nthe doors and throwing things down. Eventually J. P. got one of the\nservants to go downstairs with him, when all was found right, no one there,\nand apparently nothing moved. The noises now began on the third storey,\nand the servants were so much alarmed that it was difficult to get them to\ngo to bed at all that night.\n8 mo., 6th to 12th.\u2014My brother-in-law, George Carr, was with us. He\n\fDeo., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 345\nheard steppings and loud rumblings in the middle of the night, and other\nnoises.\n[At this point the diary abruptly comes to an end. I know, however,\nthat disturbances of a varied character continued more or less, perhaps less\nrather than more, for years. One episode during the period has been\nfrequently told to me by my father, and I think no account of it has been\npublished. All his family were in Cumberland and he was sleeping alone,\nonly one servant being in the house. He had retired about 10.30. Owing\nto the disturbances he and my mother, as well as the domestics, usually\nburnt a rushlight during the night, a description of candle at that time in\ncommon use ; but on this occasion he had no light whatever. He had not\nbeen two minutes in bed when suddenly, seemingly close to the bedside,\nthere was an awful crash as of a wooden box being wrenched open with a\ncrowbar with terrific force ; he started up and cried out with a loud voice,\n\"Begone! thou wicked spirit!\" As if in defiance of this adjuration the\nfearful crash was almost immediately repeated, and, if possible, louder than\nbefore. Cool-headed as my father was, and inured to unwelcome surprises\nfrom the unknown, he was painfully agitated by this ostentatious outburst\nof ill-will or wanton devilry ; he arose, struck a light, searched the room,\nopened his bedroom door, listened on the stairs, looked into other rooms,\nand explored the house generally, but found everything perfectly quiet.\nThere was no wind, and indeed there seemed no explanation, but one only,\nof this horrid visitation.\nFinding life in the house to be no longer tolerable ; fearing also an\nunhappy effect, if not a permanent injury on the minds of their children\nshould they remain longer in such a plague-ridden dwelling, they finally left\nit in 1847, and went to reside at Camp Villa, North Shields, social and other\nreasons also influencing them in taking this step. My parents have both\nrepeatedly told me that during the last night they slept in the old house,\nthe rest of the family having preceded them to the new one, there were con\ntinuous noises during the night, boxes being apparently dragged with heavy\nthuds down the now carpetless stairs, non-human footsteps stumped on the\nfloors, doors were, or seemed to be, clashed, and impossible furniture corded\nat random or dragged hither and thither by inscrutable agency ; in short, a\npantomimic or spiritualistic repetition of all the noises incident to a house\nhold flitting. A miserable night my father and mother had of it, as I have\noften heard from their own lips ; not so much from terror at the unearthly\nnoises, for to these they were habituated, as dread lest this wretched\nfanfaronade might portend the contemporary flight of the unwelcome visitors\nto the new abode. Fortunately for the family this dread was not realised.\nSo far as I know, and in this I am confirmed by my elder brother and sisters,\nthe eight years' residence in the new home was absolutely free from all forms\nof the annoyances and uncomfortable knockings, the stealthy steps and the\nuncouth mutterings that for ten or eleven years had disturbed the even\ntenor of a quiet Quaker family in the old house at Willington Mill.]\nThe subsequent history of the house may be briefly told. The\nforeman and chief clerk in the flour mill, less sensitive perhaps to the\ndisturbances, and with families of maturer years, raised no objection to\n\f346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, i892.\noccupying it after a time, and it was divided into two separate dwell\nings, and inhabited by them for nearly twenty years. They were\noccasionally disturbed by unaccountable noises, and Thomas Mann, the\nforeman, on one or two occasions saw what appeared to be apparitions,\nbut both families were designedly reticent on the subject, and I believe\nsuffered but little throughout their occupancy. About 1867 the mill\nand house were let for a few months to a firm of millers in an adjoining\ntown whose mill had been burnt down ; I have been informed that\nthose then occupying the house were much troubled, one family-\ndeclining to stay on any terms. Not long afterwards my father sold\nthe entire premises to a firm of guano merchants, and information\nreached us that two machinists, one of them a German, who were\nfixing machinery in the mill, spent some restless evenings and unhappy\nnights in the house in fruitlessly trying to discover the origin of fitful\nand exasperating disturbances. No effort was made, so far as I know,,\nto test the accuracy of these rumours. On one occasion, whilst the\nhouse was unoccupied shortly before its sale, I was one of a party of\nfour or five young men, one of them a doctor, who spent an entire\nnight in the house, upstairs, in the hope of hearing or seeing some\nthing, but absolutely without result. Some little time after this I was\none of another and larger party, including two ladies, who spent an\nevening in another upstairs room, accompanied by a \" medium \" of\nrepute at that time well known in Newcastle ; no person whatever\nbeing in the house besides our own party. The stance was not with\nout incidents, well understood by those acquainted with such proceed\nings, and which it would be useless at the moment to describe to-\nthose who are not, but absolutely futile as to establishing any commu\nnication with the alleged spirit or spirits supposed to haunt or to have\nformerly haunted the premises. My father never made any attempt to-\nopen up communication in this way ; his experiences were prior to the\ntime when the modern developments of Spiritualism made the lingo of\nthe seance familiar to the public ear, and although he took an earnest\ninterest in the subject, he never attended a seance, and laid stress\nupon the application of the well-known text about \"seducing spirits\nand doctrines of demons.\" The mill is now only used as a warehouse.\nThe house has been divided into small tenements ; I understand the\nowner, recognising the doubtful repute of the house, offered the apart\nments free for a short term. About two years ago I interviewed\nthree or four of the tenants, and was told that no disturbances had\nbeen experienced. Although of modest pretensions, it was formerly a\ncomfortable old-fashioned house of ten or twelve rooms, but the\nuntidiness of its present aspect is a painful spectacle to those who\nremember it at its best ; the stables and adjoining out-buildings have\n\fDeo., i892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 347\nbeen pulled down, the garden wall has disappeared, the jargonelle\npear trees that formerly blossomed up to the third storey are repre\nsented by the mere ghosts of blackened stumps, the large old thorn\ntree of red blossom, and the abundance of iris and auricula that were\nwont to bloom in the garden are as far off as the snows of last winter.\nThe singular record of the house gives it an interest nevertheless,,\neven in its squalid present and its ungracious decay.\nSome may think the whole affair altogether a very paltry story. I\nadmit it is not a very picturesque \"ghost\"; but whatever its merit it\nis at least authentic, and that is a rather important feature in a ghost.\nThe truth has been told without extenuation or reserve, and if the\nrecital points to the conclusion that the spirit or spirits, or whatever\nyou choose to call them, belonged to the residuum of the spirit world,\nI hope my family may not be held responsible.\nI may be permitted finally to briefly indicate some of my own\nconclusions.\nIf the gibberings, the preposterous incivilities, and the unwhole\nsome uproar committed in that house for ten unforgettable years by\nthese unhallowed genii may be accepted as an argument tending to\nestablish the continued existence of the individual after death, the\nseductions of futurity are scarcely increased to\nExhausted travellers that have undergone\nThe scorching heats of life's intemperate zone.\nSuch questionable intimations of immortality are hardly calculated to\nsoothe us\u2014\nWhen worn with adverse passions, furious strife,\nAnd the hard passage of tempestuous life.\nNevertheless, this singular history, taken in connection with others of\nits class, may to the impartial and philosophic mind hide a lesson of\nthe highest import. M. Renan, in one of the very last of his many\ncharming pages, troubled with doubts as to a future existence, whilst\nsmiling at the superstition of the old-fashioned and orthodox hell,\nexclaims how glad he would be to be sure even of hell, a hypothesis so\npreferable to annihilation.\nIn the same way, may we not justifiably postulate this : that if we\ncan prove the existence of spirits of a low or inferior order, then faith,\nanalogy, and evolution, if not logic and conviction, can claim those of\na progressive, a high and superior order 1 Is it not rational to suppose\nthat the more debased and the most unhappy have the greatest facility\nin giving tangible proof of their existence, under certain conditions\nimperfectly understood ; whilst the purer and nobler souls find inter\ncourse painful or impossible, but are yet occasionally able to achieve\n\f348 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, pec, 1892.\nit in those picturesque and beneficent instances where their visitation\nis recorded, not only in the Old and New Testaments, but scattered all\nthrough literature ; cases which possibly the many may still deride, but\nwhich others cherish as indications of the divine and proofs of\nimmortality 1 Each must draw his own conclusions ; as the prophet of\nTreguier says, \"Let us all be free to make our own romance of the\ninfinite.\"\nEdmund Procter.\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, October, 1892.\nAPPENDIX.\nI.

My desire is\nto remain alone in the house all night, with no companion but my own\nwatch-dog, in which, as far as courage and fidelity are concerned, I place\nmuch more reliance than upon any three young gentlemen I know of. And\nit is also my hope that, if I have a fair trial, I shall be enabled to unravel this\nmystery.

At the same time, J. P. thinks it best to inform him that\nparticular disturbances are far from frequent at present, being only\noccasional and quite uncertain, and therefore the satisfaction of E.

The best chance would be\nafforded by his sitting up alone in the third storey till it be fairly daylight\u2014\nsay 2 or 3 a.m.\nWellington, 6th mo., 21st, 1840.\n[Mr. Procter left home with his family on the 23rd of June, and got an\nold servant, who was then out of place in consequence of ill-health, to take\ncharge of the house during their absence. Mr. P. returned alone, on\naccount of business, on the 3rd of July, on the evening of which day Mr.\nDrury and his companion also unexpectedly arrived. After the house had\nbeen locked up, every corner of it was minutely examined. The room out\nof which the apparition proceeded, as well as the adjoining rooms, was un\nfurnished, and the closet out of which it issued is too shallow to contain any\nperson.

Monday morning, July 6th, 1840.\nDear Sir,\u2014I am sorry I was not at home to receive you when you kindly\ncalled yesterday to inquire for me. I am happy to state that I am really\nsurprised that I have been so little affected as I am, after that horrid and\nmost awful affair, the only bad effect that I feel is a heavy dulness in one\nof my ears\u2014the right one ; I call it heavy dulness, because I not only do\nnot hear distinctly, but feel in it a constant noise ; this I was never affected\nwith heretofore; but I doubt not it will go off. I am persuaded that no one\nwent to your house at any time more disbelieving in respect to seeing anything\npeculiar ; now no one can be more satisfied than myself. I will, in the\ncourse of a few days, send you a full detail of all I saw and heard. Mr.\nSpence and two other gentlemen came down to my house in the afternoon\nto hear my detail; but, sir, could I account for these noises from natural\ncauses, yet, so firmly am I persuaded of the horrid apparition, that I\nwould affirm that what I saw with my eyes was a punishment to me for my\nscoffing and unbelief, that I am assured that, as far as the horror is con\ncerned, they are happy that believe and have not seen. . . .\nEdward Drury.\n(4) From Mr. Procter to Mr. Drury.\nWillington, 7th mo., 9, 1840.\n. . . . I shall be glad to receive thy detail, in which it will be\nneedful to be very particular in showing that thou couldst not be asleep, or\nattacked by nightmare, or mistake a reflection of the candle, as some\nsagaciously suppose. . . . Josh. Procter.\n(5) From Mr. Drury to Mr. Procter.\nSunderland, July 13th, 1840.\nDear Sir,\u2014I hereby, according to promise in my last letter, forward you\na true account of what I heard and saw at your house, in which I was led to\npass the night from various rumours circulated by most respectable parties,\nparticularly from an account by my esteemed friend Mr. Davison, whose\n\f350 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec., 1892.\nname I mentioned to you in a former letter. Having received your sanction\nto visit your mysterious dwelling I went, on the 3rd of July, accompanied\nby a friend of mine, named T. Hudson. This was not according to promise,\nnor in accordance with my first intent, as I wrote you I would come alone ;\nbut I felt gratified at your kindness in not alluding to the liberty I had taken,\nas it ultimately proved for the best. I must here mention that, not expecting\nyou at home, I had in my pocket a brace of pistols, determining in my mind\nto let one of these drop as if by accident, before the miller, for fear he should\npresume to play tricks upon me ; but after my interview with you I felt there\nwas no occasion for weapons, and did not load them, after you had allowed\nus to inspect as minutely as we pleased every portion of the house. I\nsat down on the third storey landing, fully expecting to account\nfor auy noises I might hear in a philosophical manner. This was about\neleven o'clock p.m. About ten minutes to twelve we both heard a noise,\nas if a number of people was pattering with their bare feet upon the\nfloor ; and yet, so singular was the noise that I could not minutely\ndetermine from whence it proceeded. A few minutes afterwards, we heard\na noise, as if some one was knocking with his knuckles among our feet ; this\nwas immediately followed by a hollow cough from the very room from which\nthe apparition proceeded. The only noise after this was as if a person was\nrustling against the wall in coming upstairs. At a quarter to one,\nI told my friend that, feeling a little cold, I would like to go\nto bed, as we might hear the noises equally well there. He\nreplied that he would not go to bed till daylight. I took up a\nnote which I had accidentally dropped, and began to read it, after\nwhich I took out my watch to ascertain the time, and found that it wanted\nten minutes to one. In taking my eyes from the watch they became rivetted\nupon a closet door, which I distinctly saw open, and saw also the figure of\na female attired in greyish garments, with the head inclining downwardsi\nand one hand pressed upon the chest, as if in pain, and the other, viz., the\nright hand, extended towards the floor, with the index finger pointing\ndownwards. It advanced with an apparently cautious step across the floor\ntowards me ; immediately as it approached my friend, who was slumbering,\nits right hand was extended towards him ; I then rushed at it, giving at the\ntime, as Mr. Procter states, a most awful yell ; but instead of grasping it, I\nfell upon my friend, and I recollected nothing distinctly for nearly three\nhours afterwards. I have since learnt that I was carried downstairs in an\nagony of fear and terror.\nI hereby certify that the above account is strictly true and correct in\nevery respect.\nEdw.

Letters from, Mr. Joseph Procter, published in the \"Spiritual Magazine\"\nVol. IV., 1863, pp. 30, 33, and 432.\n(1) Camp Villa, North Shields, 9 mo. 2nd, 1853.\nThe publicity given to the occurrences at Willington\na few years ago, through Crowe's Night Side of Nature, has given occasion\nmany inquiries similar to thy own, and I have never shrunk from the\n\fDeo., 1892.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 351\navowal of undoubting assurance of these appearances, noises, &c., being\nmade by the spirit of some person or persons deceased, notwithstanding\nthat the who and the wherefor have not hitherto been ascertained. In\nreply to thy inquiry about the accuracy of the narrative in the work referred\nto, I may state that the portion of it from p. 125 to p. 137 taken from\nRichardson's Table Book, a local antiquarian publication, was written by the\nlate Dr. Clanny, of Sunderland, and revised by myself before being printed,\nand is perfectly true and correct. In that other portion, derived from\nWilliam Howitt's personal inquiries, there are trifling inaccuracies, yet not\nsuch as materially affect the nature of the facts referred to. The disturb\nances had become much less frequent before I left the house in 1847, and,\nwith a very few exceptions, have not since occurred ; nor has anything of\nthat nature ever followed us to our present dwelling. ....\n(2) Tynemouth, 1 mo. 7th, 1858.\nI remember very well having corresponded with thee on the subject of\nthe mysterious occurrences in my house at Willington, about three years\nago ; and it is a satisfaction to me to have the opportunity given me to\nassure thee that the statement referred to in thy favour of yesterday, as\ngiven by a gentleman who has lived at Newcastle, that I had found the\ndisturbances described in Mrs. Crowe's Night Side of Nature to have been\na trick practised upon me from interested motives, is entirely void of\ntruth\n(3) To the Editor of the Spiritual Magazine.\nTynemouth, 7 mo 20th, 1863.\nThe following statement of your able and esteemed correspondent,\nWilliam Howitt, in the number for July, I believe to be founded in mis\napprehension, and will thank you to insert this correction in the next\nmonth's number :\u2014\"There are said to be evidences of the .spirits haunting\nWillington Mill, having done so to an older house on the same spot for two\nhundred years.\" I believe no such evidences exist, the premises having\nbeen erected in 1800, on ground never before built on. Persons acquainted\nwith the neighbourhood, and knowing the statement I have quoted to be an\nerror, might thus be led to discredit the whole narrative, as truly and\ncircumstantially related in the number for January. There is an older\nhouse about two hundred yards from Willington Mill, in which there was a\nmysterious ringing of bells about forty years ago ; and about twenty years\nsince, the person who then occupied it told me that occasionally at night\nvery strange noises were heard, adding, \"It must be rats, you know.\"\nThat is, however, more than I know, and may be left as a doubtful question.\nJoseph Procter.\nIII. Account of an interview between Professor Sidgwick and Mrs. Hargrave,\non Jan. 'ird, 1884, taken from his notes made at the time.\nMrs. Hargrave, one of Mrs. Procter's sisters, saw on one occasion an\napparition similar to that seen by Dr. Diury. She described it as the\nfigure of a woman in a grey mantle, which came through the wall of her\nroom from the next. There was a light in the room ; her sister\nwho was with her was asleep. The feet of the figure appeared to\n\f352 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1892t\nbe about three feet from the floor. It came close up to the bed.\nShe also saw in the day time a large white cat in the garden. It was larger\nthan a real cat and with a long snout. It appeared to go through the closed\ngarden-door or through the wall into the engine-house, where Mr. Procter,\nbeing in the mill-yard, saw it go into the engine-house and disappear as if it\nhad gone into the fire. The cat was also seen by her in one of the bedrooms,\ngoing through a closed door. She often heard the noises which so many\nothers in the house heard ; e.g., she would hear sounds as of someone\ncoming downstairs with wooden shoes and rapping every rail with a stick,\nalso as of the clock being wound up. For about three months she slept in\nthe room on the third floor over the nursery, and though she heard the\nnoises for three months, said nothing about them, till her youngest sister,\nnow Mrs. Wright, heard a loud noise and talked to her about it. Mrs.\nHargrave also often felt her bed shaken as if some one was standing at the\nbottom of it and striking blows against a board placed to keep a child\nfrom falling out. She also used to hear dancing and noises in a room which\nwas used as a schoolroom (the schoolroom being ascertained to be empty),\nand shaking of the window frame in the room below. When the children\nwere playing in the room upstairs, Mrs. Hargrave and her sister, playing\nwith them, used to see a door banged in their faces, the windows being shut\nand there being no draughts to cause it.\nMrs. Hargrave also referred to many of the incidents related in Mr.\nProcter's narrative in connection with other members of the family, and\ngave Professor Sidgwick an account of the description of the haunting by the\nclairvoyants \" Jane \" (for which see Mrs. Sidgwick's paper On the evidence for\nClairvoyance, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 54, 82-84, 86, 87).\nA FRENCH REVIEW OF \"HALLUCINATIONS\nTELEPATHIQUES.\"\nThe Revue des Deux Monies for November 1st, 1892, contains a\nreview of Hallucinations TiUpathiques, the French abridgment and\nadaptation of Phantasms of the Living which M. Marillier has skilfully\ntranslated and arranged. The writer of the review (which embraces\nother works in French on similar topics) is M. Paulhan, well known as\na psychologist, and author of L'activiti Mentale et les iliments de\nVesprit. M. Paulhan's tone is very favourable to our researches, and\nthis review, taken in conjunction with others, also for the most part\nfavourable, which have appeared in other French newspapers and\nperiodicals, indicates that the translated work has been received in\nFrance with considerably more of appreciation, and even of positive\nadhesion, than we on our part had ventured to expect. It is now\nannounced as in its second edition.\n\f","_id":473}
