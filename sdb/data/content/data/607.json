Heureusement,\nnous pouvons converser ensemble, de loin comme de\npres, et, en reahte, je suis aupres de vous, par I'esprit\net par le coeur.\nJ'ai lu un grand nombre de discours academiques, et\nnotamment les 24 que la Psychical Society a pubhes\ndans son beau volume des Presidential Addresses, et j'ai\n^ The English translation of this Address was read by Sir W. F. Barrett at a\nGeneral Meeting of the Society on June 26, 1923.\n\f2 Camille Flammarion. [PABT\nconstate qu'en general celui qui a rhonneur d'etre reQU\ndans le cenacle d'une illustre Societe commence son\ndiscours de reception en exprimant son humble recon-\nnaissance d'etre admis dans une compagnie dont il n'est\npas digne. Ce serait assurement mon devoir particulier\nici, plus que pour aucun de mes predecesseurs, puisque je\nsuis, avec mon savant ami Charles Richet et avec le\nphilosophe Henri Bergson, I'un des rares etrangers qui\nont ete appeles a cette presidence, depuis 41 ans que votre\nSociete existe. J'avoue que je suis un peu ebloui par\nvotre constellation d'astres de premiere grandeur, oti\nbrillent les noms de William Crookes, de Balfour Stewart,\nd'Arthur Balfour, de WilHam James, d'Oliver Lodge, de\nWilliam Barrett, de Frederic Myers, d'Henry Sidgwick, de\nGerald Balfour et de leurs emules.\nParmi ces discours, la premiere phrase de celui du\nspirituel philosophe William James m'a particulierement\nfrappe, parce qu'elle repondait exactement a mon im-\npression lorsque votre eminent fondateur et ancien presi-\ndent Sir William Barrett est venu dans ma retraite\nd'astronome solitaire me proposer cet honneur assurement\ninattendu. J'y ai repondu, comme Sir Oliver Lodge en\n1901 :\n\" It is the wish of your Council,\" mais en ajoutant,\ncomme William James, en 1896, que c'etait la . . . un\npiege a souris, \" a mouse-trap,\" et que quand on y\nentre on est pris, sans se douter de ce qui vous arrive !\nAi-je une excuse de m'etre laisse prendre 1 Peut-etre.\nL'annee meme oil cette Societe de Recherches a ete\nfondee\u2014en 1882\u2014j'ai fonde moi-meme, en France, I'As-\ntronomie. Revue des Recherches astronomiques, d'oii est\nsortie, cinq ans apres, la Societe Astronomique de\nFrance, ou j'ai eu comme successeurs a la presidence les\nplus celebres astronomes de I'lnstitut, Faye, Janssen,\nTisserand, Callandreau, Poincare, LipjDmann, Deslandres,\nBaillaud, Puiseux, Appell, savants illustres, dignes d'etre\ncompares aux gloires de votre Conseil. En meme temps\nque vous, je travaillais done a la fondation d'une oeuvre\nayant pour mission d'elever les hommes au-dessus des\ninterets materiels et de les inviter a vivre dans la con-\ntemplation de I'infini.\n\fLXXXix.] Discours Presidentiel.\nAnimes du nieme esprit, nous voulions, vous comme moi,\nle progres et le developpement des connaissances humaines,\nsachant que :\nCroire tout decouvert est une erreur profonde ;\nCast prendre I'horizon pour les bornes du monde.\nPeut-etre me rattachai-je a vous par des liens encore\nplus anciens. En 1869, vos predecesseurs en recherches\npsychiques avaient fonde a Londres la Societe dialectique,\navec le concours de Alfred Russel Wallace, de I'ingenieur\nVarley, du Prof. De Morgan, de William Crookes, qui\nme demanda un article astronomique pour son Qtiarterly\nJournal of Science, et precisement aussi, en cette meme\nannee, pronon9ant un discours, le jour de ses obseques,\nsiir la tombe d'Allan Kardec, grand maitre du Spiritisme\nen France, j'ai pris soin de dire que le spiritisme ne\ndoit pas etre considere comme une religion, mais repre-\nsente I'aurore d'une science nouvelle, tout entiere a\ncreer. L'affaire de la science n'est pas la croyance,\nmais I'investigation.\nAinsi, mes chers CoUegues, il me semble que nous\nsommes freres depuis longtemps et que nous marchons la\nmain dans la main.\nUn souvenir plus ancien encore se rappeUe en ce\nmoment a ma pensee. En 1861, j'etais eleve astronome\na rObservatoire de Paris, et je passais tous les jours\npres de I'Odeon, pour revenir au domicile de mes parents\nhabitant I'interieiu\" de Paris, et comme tous les amateurs\nde livreSj je m'arretais sous les galeries de ce theatre pour\nfeuilleter les publications interessantes. J'en ouvre une,\net mes yeux tombent sur une page portant pour titre\nPluralite des mondes. Or, precisement, a cette epoque,\nje travaillais a mon ouvrage sur ce sujet, public I'annee\nsuivante. Je regarde le titre du volume et je lis Le\nLivre des Esprits, par Allan Kardec. Le chapitre qui\nm'interessait etait presente comme \" dicte par des Es-\nprits.\" Cette enigme pouvait intriguer un etudiant de 19\nans. J'allai rendre visite a I'auteur, qui m'inscrivit (le\n15 Novembre 1861) dans sa Societe parisienne des Etudes\nIspirites, et j'assistai aux reunions hebdomadaires ou\ns'exer9aient diverses formes de mediumnite, notamment\n\f4 Camille Flammarion. [part\nI'ecriture automatique. J'essayai moi-meme, et, de se-\nmaine en semaine, j'ecrivis, dans une demi-conscience,\nplusieurs dissertations astronomiques signees Galilee, que\nAllan Kardec a publiees plus tard dans son livre La\nGenese. Un etudiant plus age que moi, qui se fit auteur\ndramatique et membra de I'Academie frangaise, Victorien\nSardou, s'exenjait, de son cote, a un autre genre de\nmediumnite, et dessinait des habitations imaginaires sur\nla planete Jupiter, signees Bernard Palissy, dessins fort\ncurieux que Ton peut voir dans mon ouvrage sur les\nForces naturelles inconnues. A cette epoque, les astro-\nnomes pensaient que Jupiter etait un monde habitable,\nsuperieur a la Terre par son printemps perpetuel et ses\nannees douze fois plus longues que les notres. Je ne\ntardai pas a remarquer que nos communications medium-\nniques refletaient simplement nos idees personnelles, et\nque Galilee pour moi et les habitants de Jupiter pour\nSardou etaient etrangers a ces productions inconscientes\nde notre esprit.\nC'etait en 1861, au temps de Napoleon III. et de la\nreine Victoria. C'est deja loin ; mais nous pouvons re-\nmonter plus haut encore.\nPuisqu'on I'a rappele recemment a la fete officielle dont\nles Savants Fran\u00a7ais m'ont honore a la Sorbonne au mois\nde juin dernier, je me permettrai de me souvenir ici que\nle probleme de la survivance de Fame m'a preoccupe\ndepuis ma plus tendre enfance. Le Ministre Reibel,\nrepresentant le Gouvernement, a raconte que dans le\nvillage ou je suis ne, voyant, a I'age de sept ans, passer\nun convoi funebre, j'ai interroge un camarade plus age\nqui m'apprit qu'on allait enterrer un homme mort et que\nje lui ai replique :\n\" Cesser de vivre, ce n'est pas possible\n. . . on ne meurt pas.\" En rapportant ce souvenir dans\nmes Memoires, j'ajoutais : \"J'ai reve plusieurs heures,\nplusieurs jours, plusieurs semaines, plusieurs mois ; la\nconviction que la mort n'existe pas a continue de dominer\nmon esprit ; nous ne pouvons pas etre detruits.\"\n* * * *\nSi je rappelle ces souvenirs, chers CoUegues, c'est pour\nm'excuser d'avoir accepte cette presidence et pour vous\n\fLXXXIX.] Discours Presidentiet. 5\ndire que nous travaillons dans la meme voie. Vos fon-\ndateurs etaient Sir William Barrett et Frederic Myers,\nauxquels ne tarderent pas a s'associer Henry Sidgwick,\nBaKour Stewart, Edmond Gurney, Stainton Moses, Massey,\nPodmore, Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Arthur\nSmith et d'autres chercheurs. Le premier de ces fondateurs\nest toujours la, dans son infatiguable activite, et nous\nadmirons tous sa permanente jeunesse. Le nom de\nFrederic Myers reste uni au sien comme le symbole du\ntravailleur independant auquel la science metapsychique\na du ses principaux progres. Vous avez tenu, Messieurs,\na appliquer des I'origine a vos recherches les principes\nseveres et absolus de la methode experimentale proclaniee\npar votre Bacon.\nVos progres ne se sont pas realises sans luttes et sans\nobstacles. Personnellement, je les ai affrontes de pres,\nmeme a Paris, la surtout peut-etre, car dans le pays de\nVoltaire, on a un peu I'habitude de se moquer de tout.\nTandis que vous luttiez contre Faraday, nous luttions\ncontre Babinet. Ces deux physiciens avaient tort de nier.\nTout le monde salt qu'il y a des imposteurs, des farceurs,\ndes menteurs, et egalement des credules, des illusionnes,\ndes faibles d'esprit, et meme des imbeciles. Est-ce une\nraison pour ne pas etudier les problemes non resolus ?\nPlusieurs d'entre vous peuvent se souvenir d'un ecrivain\ncharmant, le Prof, de Morgan, le subtil auteur du Budget\nof Paradoxes. J'ai ete en relation avec lui dans le\ncours des annees 1864-1867, lorsque je redigeais le Cosmos.\nNous pouvons dire avec lui, comme avec luon ami re-\ngrette A. de Rochas, auquel notre science doit tant\nd'observations ingenieuses, que : refuser de s'occuper de\ncertains phenomenes quand on est convaincu de leur\nrealite, par crainte du QiCen clira-t-on, c'est a la fois\ns'abaisser soi-meme en obeissant a une faiblesse de car-\nactere meprisable, et trahir les interets de I'humanite tout\nentiere. Nul ne saurait, en effet, prevoir les consequences\nd'une decouverte, quand il s'agit de forces nouvelles.\nL'ambre des Grecs, qui a donne son nom a I'electricite,\nne paraissait qu'un jeu d'enfant, et les grenouilles de\nGalvani ne paraissaient qu'une curiosite insignifiante.\n\f6 Gamille Flammarion. Fpaet\nu\nLa connaissance des forces de la nature a avance\ngraduellement, lentement, avec des flux et des reflux,,\ndepuis les temps les plus anciens, et sous toutes les\nlatitudes, sans distinction de patries. Les separations\ngeograpliiques sont aussi inexistantes devant la science que\nles limites des constellations dans la carte du ciel. II\nn'y a pas de separations entre les peuples, pour les\nastronomes\u2014meme pour les aeronautes. Dans mes voyages\naeriens, j'ai plus d'une fois traverse des frontieres, et j'ai\ntoujours eu la plus grande difficulte a les discerner sur\nle sol glissant a mes pieds. Cependant, il est agreable\nde rencontrer des compatriotes partout oil Ton va, et je\nsuis particulierement heureux et fier de saluer ici mes\npredecesseurs en cette noble presidence, MM. Bergson et\nRichet, qui, depuis longtemps aussi, font planer les etudes\nde I'esprit au-dessus de tons les fugitifs interets materiels.\nTons les presidents de cette Association ont suivi le\nmeme programme philosophique.\nOn travaille partout a la recherche de la verite ; mais\nla branche des etudes psychiques est encore la plus\nfaible, la plus jeune. L'arbre de la science classique est\nun chene qui domine tout superieurement, et la science\nnouvelle n'est qu'un roseau. Mais ce roseau deviendra\nun arbre, et le vieux chene se transformera, au point de\nn'etre plus du tout le meme arbre, avant cent ans seule-\nment. Nous avons encore quelques luttes a soutenir\ncontre les habitudes inveterees. Tout est a renouveler.\nVotre association scientifique, si independante, si loyale,\nsi active, a joue un role important dans cette evolution,\net elle est universellement estimee. Pour ma part, dans\ntons les ouvrages psychiques que j'ai ecrits depuis sa\nfondation, je me suis fait un devoir et un plaisir de\ncelebrer ses travaux, ses conquetes, ses precieuses observa-\ntions.\nAvouons qu'il faut avoir un courage souvent mal recompense\npour agir envers et contre les opinions dominantes, qui\nsont celles de I'ignorance.\nNous Savons que la science classique n'a pas decouvert\ntoute la verite contenue dans I'univers et que presque\ntout reste, au contraire, a decouvrir. Non seulement\n\ftxxxix.] Discours Presidentiel. 7\ntoutes les forces de la nature ne sont pas connues, mais\nla plupart echappent a nos sens imparfaits et incomplets.\nCe qu'il importe de ne jamais perdre de vue, e'est I'ap-\npreciation exacte de la nature de nos connaissances. Les\nanalystes scientifiques savent, depuis plus d'un siecle, que\nI'observation s'arrete a I'apparence, au phenomene sensible,\nsans jamais pouvoir penetrer la substance, ni rien con-\nnaitre de I'essence reelie des choses. Malebranche avait\netabli ce principe avant Emmanuel Kant. Mais la\nscience avance graduellement dans ses investigations.\nElle avance vite, surtout actuellement par les applications\nmerveilleuses des ondes invisibles, de la telegraphic et de\nla telephonie sans fil. Avant un demi-siecle les decou-\nvertes depasseront autant nos connaissances actuelles que\nI'aviation et la radiotelepiionie de 1923 depassent I'aero-\nstation et la telegraphic d'il y a 50 ans.\n* H=\nLa curiosite est-elle un defaut ? Je ne le pense pas,\nquoique Ton ait fait un crime a notre mere Eve d'avoir\nvoulu gouter au fruit defendu, malgre la defense de\nJehovah, ou plutot, sans doute, a cause de cette defense !\nLa curiosite est la source de toutes les decouvertes, et\nnous ne pouvons qu'y applaudir. Pourtant d'eminents\nsavants ne ressentent pas ce sentiment subtil, et meme le\ndesapprouvent. Un jour, le fondateur actuellement sur-\nvivant de votre belle Societe psychique, I'emment pro-\nfesseur Sir Wilham Barrett, ayant eu des preuves per-\nsonnelles des transmissions psychiques a distance, amena\nla conversation sur ce sujet avec le celebre physiologiste\nallemand Helmholtz, alors a Dublin.\u2014\" Je ne puis y croire,\nlui rephqua celui-ci ; ni le temoignage de tous les membres\nde la Societe Royale, ni meme celui de mes propres sens\nne pourraient m'amener a admettre la transmission de\npensee d'une personne a une autre, en dehors de I'opera-\ntion de nos sensations normales, car c'est evidemment\nimpossible.\" Nous pouvons remarquer avec Sir Wilham\nBarrett que La^Dlace raisonnait plus sagement en distant,\ndans sa TMorie analytique des probabilites :\n\" ISlous sommes\nsi loin de connaitre tous les agents de la nature et leurs\ndivers modes d'action qu'il serait peu philosophique de\n\f8 Camille Flammarion.\nnier les phenomenes uniquement parce qii'ils sont inex-\nplicables dans I'etat actuel de nos connaissances. Seule-\nment, nous devons les examiner avec une attention\nd'autant jilus scrupuleuse qu'il parait plus difficile de\nles admettre ; et le calcul des probabilites devient indis-\npensable pour determiner jusqu'a quel point il faut\nmultiplier les observations afin d'obtenir en faveur des\nagents qu'elles indiquent une probabUite superieure aux\nraisons que Ton pent avoir, d'ailleurs, de ne pas les\nadmettre.\" ^\nCes reflexions de Laplace s'appliquent exactement a\nnos reclierches metapsychiques et nous confirment dans\nnotre interpretation de la valeur du nombre des observa-\ntions. Remarquons que I'illustre geometre les a emises a\npropos du Magnetisme animal et de la baguette divina-\ntoire, alors particulierement discutes.\nOr, la continuite des etudes scientifiques nous a conduits\na penser que tout est dynamisme. Le djmamisme\ncosmique reagit les mondes. Newton lui a donne le nom\nd'attraction. Mais cette interpretation est insuffisante :\ns'il n'y avait que I'attraction dans I'univers, les astres ne\nformeraient qu'un seul bloc, car elle les aurait reunis\ndepuis longtemps, depuis toujours ; il y a, de plus, le\nmouvement. Le dynamisme vital regit les etres : dans\nI'homme evolue, le dynamisme psychique est constamment\nassocie au dynamisme vital. Au fond, tous ces dyn-\namismes n'en font qu'un : c'est I'esprit dans la nature,\nsourd et aveugle pour nous dans le monde immateriel\net meme dans I'instinct des animaux, inconscient dans\nla majorite des ceuvres humaines, conscient dans un\npetit nombre.\nJ'ai ecrit dans Uranie (1888) :\n\" Ce que nous appelons\nmatiere s'evanouit lorsque I'analyse scientifique croit la\nsaisir. Nous trouvons comme soutien de I'univers et\nprincipe de toutes les formes, la force, I'element dynamique.\nL'etre humain a pour principe essentiel I'ame. L'univers\nest un dynamisme intelligent inco7inaissable.\"\nJ'ai ecrit dans les Forces Naturelles inconnues (1906)\n:\n\" Les manifestations psychiques confirment ce que nous\n1 Laplace. Thcorie analytiquc des prohabilitis. Introduction.\n\fLxxxix.] l)iscoiifs Presidentiel. 9\nSavons d'autre part, que I'explication purement mecanique\nde la nature est insuffisante et qu'il y a dans I'univers\nautre chose que la pretendue matiere. Ce n'est pas la\nmatiere qui regit le monde : C'est un element dynamique\net psychique.\"\nDepuis les annees ou ces lignes ont ete ecrites, le progres\ndes observations psycMques les a surabondamment con-\nfirmees. Votre Societe est a la tete de ce mouvement.\nMais revenons au professem: Barrett et a Helmholtz.\nHelmholtz n'etait pas curieux. Comme beaucoup d'autres,\nil avait sur certains points I'esprit hermetiquenient ferme.\nNous entendons assez souvent des hommes relativement\nintelligents nous dire : Je le verrais que je ne le croirais\npas. II y en a, d'ailleurs, qui n'aiment pas se dornier la\npeine de reflechir. Le professeur Barrett raconte aussi\nque Sir W. Rowan Hamilton, apres avoir publie sa fam-\neuse decouverte matliematique des quaternions, en parla\na I'astronome royal Airy et voulut lui exposer cette tlieorie.\nApres quelques instants, Airy I'arreta :\n\" Je ne vols pas\ncela du tout\" fit-il. \" J'ai etudie le sujet pendant plusieurs\nmois,\" repliqua Hamilton, \" et je suis certain du theoreme.\"\n\" Oh !\n\" repondit Airy, \" je viens d'y penser pendant deux ou\ntrois minutes et je vols qu'il n'y a rien la.\" II en est\nsouvent ainsi dans nos etudes.\nJ'ai eu moi-meme I'occasion de voir a Greenwich le\nDirecteur de I'Observatoire George Biddel Airy, et j 'admi-\nrals sa verte vieillesse ; mais je ne pouvais m'empecher de\npenser a la decouverte de Neptune par Le Verrier. Cette\ndecouverte ne serait pas frangaise si Airy avait ete plus\ncurieux, car il avait le Memoire d'Adams dans son tiroir\ndepuis plusieurs mois lorsque Le Verrier annonga sa\ndecouverte a 1' Academic des Sciences le 31 x4out 1846.\nD'ailleurs, Le Verrier avait fait cette decouverte porte\npar sa passion mathematique, et, en dehors des mathe-\nmatiques, n'etait pas tres curieux lui-meme. Un soir, de\nI'annee 1876, j'observais, au grand equatorial de I'Observa-\ntoire de Paris, une etoile double qui, par hasard, etait\nvoisine de la planete Neptune. Par curiosite, apres avoir\nmesure mon etoile double, je dirigeai la lunette sur\nNeptune, et cherchai a en apprecier le diametre. L'illustre\n\f10 Camitle Flammarion.\nDirecteur etait monte, ce soir-la, sur la terrasse, et me\nquestionna sur mes observations :\n\" Vous mesurez vos\netoiles doubles ?\n\" fit-il. \" Oui, Monsieur le Directeur, mais\nsavez-vous ce que j'ai en ce moment dans le champ ? . . .\nVotre planete Neptune ! EUe est curieuse ; elle est\nbleue. Voulez-vous la voir ?\n\"\u2014\" Oh ! non,\" me repondit-il.\n\" Du reste, je ne I'ai jamais vue.\"\nEtait-ce une boutade ? Etait-ce vrai ? Ce qui est\ncertain, c'est que I'astronomie physique ne I'interessait\npas du tout.\nTout le monde salt que Le Verrier et Adams ont\ndecouvert par le calcul la position de Neptune dans le\nciel, et que c'est un jeune astronome de Berlin, Galle,\nqui, sur I'invitation de Le Verrier, dirigea une lunette\nvers cette region du ciel dont il construisait precisement\nla carte, et ayant reyu une lettre de Le Verrier, le 23\nSeptembre, constata le soir meme, la presence de I'astre\ninconnu.\nL'Astronomie, la noble science du ciel, n'est pas seule-\nment I'etude aride des mouvements celestes et des lois de\nla gravitation. Ce n'est pas seulement la position des\nastres dans I'espace infini, qui nous interesse, c'est encore,\net c'est surtout, leur constitution, leur nature ; nous ne\nvoulons pas seulement savoir ou Us sont, mais ce qu'ils\nsont. L'astronomie physique est le complement de I'astro-\nnomie mathematique. Qu'est-ce que I'Univers ?\nL'homme est un atome pensant au sein de I'infini et\nde I'eternite, vivant, sur la Terre, entre I'infiniment\ngrand et I'infiniment petit. Les dernieres decouvertes astro-\nnomiques sont plus eloquentes que tous les poemes.\nQu'est-ce que tous les peintres, tous les poetes devant la\nrealite astronomique ?\nVos travaux ont apporte a la science les plus heureux\nresultats. Le 23 Avril 1887, votre President le Professeur\nBaKour Stewart, membre de la Societe Royale, a fonde\navec vous un Comite special dans le but de verifier \" the\nreahty of such alleged spiritualistic phenomena as may\nbe brought before them,\" comite compose de William\nCrookes, Oliver Lodge, William Barrett, E. Gurney\net E. Myers. Tout le monde connait aujourd'hui les\n\fLXXXIX.] Discours Presidentiel. 11\nconquetes obtenues par ces investigateurs independants.\nLes faits dont vous avez etabli I'authenticite sent irre-\ncusables. II y a, assurement, des observations qui par-\naissent contradictoires ; mais mille faits negatifs n'infir-\nment pas un seul fait positif.\nH\u00bb \"I^\nNous venons de dire que Fhomme est un atome pensant,\nvivant au sein de I'infini, et que les decouvertes astro-\nnomiques sont plus eloquentes que tous les poemes.\nCette realite sublime, personne ne s'en doutait au temps\nd'Homere, au temps d'Hesiode, au temps de Pytliagore,\nau temps de Moise, au temps de Jesus-Christ, ni meme\nau temps de Copernic. Hesiode croyait donner une\ngrande idee de I'etendue de I'univers en disant que\nrenclume de Vulcain avait mis 9 jours et 9 nuits a\ntomber du ciel sur la Terre, et qu'il lui en faudrait\nautant pour tomber jusqu'aux enfers. On pent calculer\nque cette pretendue hauteur du ciel ne represente guere\nplus que la distance de la Lune, I'astre le plus proche de\nnous ; elle est de 400.000 kilometres et notre satellite\ngravite a 384.000, trente fois seulement la largeur de\nnotre globe. Au temps de Copernic, les etoiles etaient\nsupposees appartenir a une sphere equidistante de la Terre.\nLes cometes etaient encore des meteores terrestres. Or,\npensons, jugeons.\nLe Soleil est 400 fois plus loin de nous que la Lune ;\nla derniere planete de notre systeme est 30 fois plus loin\nde nous que le Soleil ; I'etoile la plus proche est 9330\nfois plus loin ou a 280.000 rayons de I'orbite terrestre.\nCes mesures sont d'hier, historiquement parlant, ne datant\nmeme pas de cent ans. Le beau chant de la Bible :\nCoeli enarrant gloriam Dei, est centuple dans la pensee\nmoderne. Un palais prodigieux s'est substitue a une\nchetive cabane.\nSupposons qu'au sein du spectacle silencieux d'une nuit\netoilee notre esprit s'eleve dans la contemplation celeste.\nNous Savons aujourd'hui que chaque etoile est un soleil\net que la plus proche plane a une distance telle que la\nlumiere, a la vitesse de 300.000 kilometres par seconde,\nemploie 4 ans et 3 mois a parcourir I'espace qui nous en\n\f12 Camille Ftammarion. [part\nsepare. Nous savons aussi que le Soleil est 1.300.000\nfois plus volumineux que notre planete, et que les etoiles\nsont de meme ordre. Ainsi notre esprit se forme une\npremiere idee des espaces celestes et des grandeurs.\nParmi les etoiles qui frappent le mieux nos regards\ndans les belles nuits d'ete, ohoisissons I'une de celles que\ntoutes les contemplatrices du ciel ont le plus souvent\nremarquee, la radieuse Vega de la Lyre, de premiere\ngrandeur. Elle plane a 237 millions de kilometres, a\n25 annees de lumiere. C'est une splendide etoile blanche,\ndans laquelle I'liydrogene domine, plus blanche que notre\nsoleil d'or. Pouvons-nous imaginer atteindre cette dis-\ntance, par la pensee, en quelques secondes ? Peut-etre.\nSoit ! Allons plus loin dans la meme direction. Re-\ngardons cette petite constellation de la Lyre. Elle est\nprincipalement composee de 5 etoiles (4 en losange formant\nune petite lyre dont Vega serait la tete). Entre les\ndeux plus eloignees (\/3 et j de 3\" grandeur), il y a une\nnebuleuse particulierement curieuse, en forme d'anneau.\nElle est invisible a I'oeil nu, mais en dirigeant notre\nregard vers ce point du ciel, nous la traversons. Au\ntelescope, elle est \" splendidissima.\" C'est un anneau\nelliptique (sans doute circulaire, vu obliquement) avec\nune etoile au milieu de son disque central. L'analyse\nspectrale y montre des vapeurs de fer et de zinc. C'est\nune genese de systeme de monde en formation, qui git a\nune distance immense au-dela de Vega.\nNon loin de la ; notre regard pent plonger vers une\nautre nebuleuse, ou plutot vers un amas d'etoiles, le\ncelebre amas d'Hercule, voisin de la Lyre ; la merveille\ndes merveilles. C'est une agglomeration de soleils. . . .\nDe combien de milliers ? . . . Une pose photographique\nd'une minute en enregistre 820, une pose de six minutes\n35.000. . . .

II ne sert de rien de\nrepondre, au-dela sont des espaces, des temps ou des\ngrandeurs sans limites. Nul ne comprend ces paroles.\nCelui qui proclame I'existence de I'infini, et personne ne\npent y echapper, accumule dans cette affirmation, plus\nde surnaturel qu'il n'y en a dans tous les miracles de\ntoutes les religions ; car la notion de I'infini a ce double\ncaractere de s'imposer et d'etre incomprehensible.\"\nApres I'etendue, incommensurable et sans bornes, con-\nsiderons les grandeurs.\nSi nous prenons le globe terrestre comme terme de\ncomparaison, nous voyons que :\nJupiter est 1295 fois plus gros que la Terre ;\nLe Soleil est 1.300.000 fois plus gros que la Terre.\nC'est la proportion d'une boule de 18 centimetres de\n\f14 Camille Flammarion.

L'unite des\nmesures celestes n'est plus le kilometre, ni le diametre\nterrestre, ni la distance d'ici au Soleil (de 149.500.000\nkilometres) : c'est trop peu.

Que I'espace soit sans bornes, en\nn'importe quelle direction, que nous puissions voyager en\nesprit, avec n'importe quelle vitesse, pendant I'eternite,\nsans approclier d'aucun terme, nous le comprenons. Le\ncontraire nous est clau-ement inadmissible, puisque quelle\nque soit la barriere que nous imaginons, notre esprit saute\npar dessus. Mais I'infiniment petit ! Considerons les\nfeuilles d'or, par exemple.

[part\nla parce que, pratiqiiement, ils ne peuvent pas aller plus\nloin. Le diametre des atonies de I'or qui compose ces\nfeuilles est done inferieur au dixieme de micron, et\nleur masse inferieure a la quantite d'or qui emplit un\ncube de ce diametre, c'est-a-dire 1 cent-milliardieme del ij\nmilligramme. Ajoutons, avec M. Jean Perrin, que la\nmasse de I'atome d'hydrogene est environ 200 fois plus\npetite, et si faible qu'il en faut 20 trillions pour con-\nstituer un milligramme. La discussion conduit meme a\nconclure que les diametres des atomes sont inferieurs au\nmillionieme de millimetre, et leur masse au cent-millionieme\nde trillionieme, de gramme. ... II parait, d'apres des\ncalculs rigoureux et des experiences tres precises, qu'un\nmilligramme de radium, contient deux millions de trillions\nd'atomes. . . . C'est I'invisible dans I'invisibilite, I'extra-\ninvisible dans I'extra-invisibilite,\u2014et j'ajouterai : I'incom- s\nprehensible dans I'incomprehensibilite.\nArretons-nous. Je prie les auditeurs qui m'ont suivi\njusqu'ici de m'excuser de les avoir entraines aussi loin.\nMais c'est I'eblouissement meme de la splendeur de la\nverite.\nMaintenant, pensons que dans cet univers, du plus for-\nmidable des mondes au plus minuscule des atomes, tout\nest en activite, en mouvement, en vibration.\n^ ^ ^\nDans la contemplation des grandeurs astronomiques\nresumees tout a I'heure, nous avons ete transportes un\ninstant a travers I'infini de I'espace et du temps, et nous\navons senti que I'Astronomie est la premiere et la plus\nimportante de toutes les sciences, parce qu'elle nous\napprend quelle place nous occupons dans la creation et\ncomment I'univers est constitue : ceux qui I'ignorent vivent\nsans savoir oil ils sont. Mais la connaissance de I'univers\nmateriel ne suffit pas a une instruction qui souhaite\netre complete.

Sur la\nIB\nlanete que nous habitons, la vie est le but supreme,\nIf\nnperieux, auquel tout obeit. Chaque etoile est un\nIf\n3leil. Les systemes de mondes sont innombrables. Que\nIS\nevient I'ame apres la vie terrestre ? Existe-t-elle in-\n1-\ncinsequement ? N'est-ce pas, comme le pretendent les\na laterialistes, une fonction du cerveau, qui nait et croit\n11\nvec lui, et s'eteint aix dernier soupir ? La connaissance\nle\ne I'ame nous importe autant que celle de I'univers et\ns oit faire partie de la science integrate. Les diverses\n11 jligions ont affirme, jusqu'ici, avoir le monopole de\nIS\n3tte etude et ont pris la juridiction de I'autre monde.\n1-\nes Asiatiques, les Grecs, les Egyptiens, les Hebreux,\n> ^s Cliretiens, les Musulmans, les diverses ecoles spiritua-\n3tes modernes ont decrit les conditions de la vie future,\nii laque systeme suivant ses idees et ses croyances, mais\n1 'ont rien decouvert de reel dans I'Empyree, dans I'Olympe,\nla ans les Champs-Elysees, dans les enfers, les limbes, le\nurgatoire, les regions inconnues de I'immortalite. Quelle\n1-\nit la nature de I'ame, quelles sont les conditions de sa\nit irvivance ? Qu'est-ce que le temps ? Qu'est-ce que\nespace ? Si je rappelle que des I'annee 1866 j'ai pose\nquestions dans mon petit livre Lumen, je rappellerai,\ns 1 meme temps, que je les ai associees aux etudes astro-\nn amiques, a des voyages dans I'infini et dans I'eternite,\nIS dsant pressentir toute la complexite du plus grand des\nIS roblemes.\nIS Si Fame continue d'exister apres la mort du corps,\nle doit etre quelque part.

Mais on\n'i Durrait conclure que, si elle n'est nulle part, elle n'existe\ni! IS. II y a la un paradoxe a eclaircir. Lorsqu'a I'age\nla } douze ans, j'etais en 6\" classe des etudes latines, on\nIS )us enseignait que dix mille ames pourraient tenir sur\n1, pointe d'une aiguille.

Plus tard, la lecture de la Divine Comedi:\ndu Dante m'a mis sous les yeux la mythologie chretienn'\ndu paradis, du purgatoire et de I'enfer, tels qu'on se lei\nrepresentait au moyen-age et tels que nous les voyon\nsculptes aux portails de nos belles catliedrales, monui n\nments d'une pieuse foi anthropomorphique et seculaire! vl\nment credule.

[part\nII.\nON HINDRANCES AND COMPLICATIONS IN TELE-\nPATHIC COMMUNICATION.\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nCritics of the evidence put forward for communication\nfrom the dead often demur not only to the frequent fail-\nure to get \" messages \" at all, but to the confused\nquality of the \" messages \" for which the dead are sup-\nposed to be responsible\u2014to the fragmentariness of the\ntruthful elements in communications about matters con-\ncerning which the alleged communicator must, it would\nseem, be well informed, and the amount of irrelevant\nmatter and actual error in which the truthful elements\nare liable to be imbedded. \" Why,\" say the critics,\n\" cannot the dead, if they communicate at all, say what,\nthey mean.\"\nNow it is very difficult to obtain adequate evidence of\ncommunication from the dead, and many reasons may be\nurged for caution in the acceptance of alleged communica-\ntions as genuine. But the confused quality of many\nof the supposed \" messages \" when received is not one of\nthese reasons. Communication from the dead is presum-\nably of the same nature as telepathic communication\nbetween the living, and similar confusion is exhibited in\nwhat appear to be indubitable instances of the latter.\nI do not think that anyone experienced in psychical\nresearch doubts this. But it has occurred to me that an\nexamination of cases of telepathy between the living,\nfrom the pomt of view of imperfection of transmission,\nmight be interesting and might throw light on the process\nof telepathy. Particular cases have often been com-\nmented on, but I do not think they have been collected\nand compared.\n\f:l Lxxxix.] Tele.pathic Comnmnication. 29\nA soi disant Myers communicating through Mrs. Hol-\nland's automatic writing, once said, \" The nearest simile\nI can find to express the difficulties of sending a message\n\u2014is that I appear to be standing behind a sheet of frosted\nglass\u2014which blurs sight and deadens sound\u2014and dictating\nfeebly\u2014to a reluctant and somewhat obtuse secretary.\" ^\nThis analogy from indistinct perception and consequent\nmisinterpretation of impressions derived through the\nsenses, is as applicable to telepathic communications be-\n!\ntween the living as it is to supposed communications\nfrom the dead. But what I want to examine as far as\npossible, is what part of the failure, when a telepathic\nmessage is incompletely transmitted, is due to what we\nmay call the sheet of frosted glass\u2014that is, the inherent\ndifficulty in the passage of an idea from one mind to\nanother without the use of the senses\u2014what to the feeble\ndictation\u2014that is, want of power in the agent\u2014and what\nto the reluctance or obtuseness of the secretary\u2014that is,\nobstacles in the percipient's own mind.\nAs regards the frosted glass\u2014some hindrance to free\ntransmission between two individuals, A and B, there\nmust be so long as they retain their individuality. If\nthere were no barrier A and B would be merged into one.\nBut I may say at once that I do not think we have\nevidence of obstruction, apart' from A and B themselves\n(as we should have, for instance, if the transmission were\na physical phenomenon like the passage of light). If we\nstick to our analogy, the \" sheet of frosted glass \" must\nsymbolize the aggregate difficulties due to the minds,\nembodied or unembodied, of agent and percipient and\ncannot be studied separately from these. The one piece\nof evidence suggesting obstruction outside the two minds\nis the apparent influence of the spatial relation between\nagent and percipient in some telepathic experiments\n\u2014\nexperiments when agent and percipient are in different\nrooms succeeding less well than when they are together.\n^\n^Proceedings, Vol. XXI., p. 230.\n2 Examples of this will be found in the Brighton experiments reported\nin Proceedings, Vol. VI. and VIII. For discussion of it see Vol. VI.,\npp. 156, 157, aiia Vol. VIII.,_p. 544,\n\f30 Mrs. Henry Sidgioick. [part\nThis is undou1)tedly a fact in certain cases, whatever the\nexplanation. In other experimental cases, however, dis-\ntance appears to be no hindrance, nor does it, so far as\nwe know, affect spontaneous telepathy, and I am disposed\nto think that in experiments where it does operate ad-\nversely this is diie to a subjective effect in the mind of\nagent or percipient or both, arising perhaps from self\nsuggestion or the lack of necessary exciting stimulus.\nPractically our investigation will then be confined to\nwhat we can learn about the telepathic process in the\nminds of agent and percipient. As regards the latter,\nthere are some preliminary remarks to make before pro-\nceeding to telepathic cases.\nWe shall find that an important difficulty in the em-\nergence of an idea telepathically conveyed, appears to lie\nin the passage of the idea from one stratum, as we may\ncall it, of the percipient's mind to another. My readers\nwill doubtless grant me the existence of these strata and\nwill admit that often, and probably always, there are in\nus two or more streams of memory and intelligent mental\naction existmg concurrently, which are more or less sepa-\nrate and more or less independent of one another, though\nideas may pass from one to the other. Any such stream\nof which our ordinary waking consciousness is not at a\ngiven moment aware, may be spoken of as at that\nmoment subliminal to it. We get gliiiipses of double\nmentation at work in dreams, in automatic writing, in\nsensory hallucinations such as crystal visions, in hypnotism,\nand otherwise. Assuming this granted I need not here\ngo into the evidence for it. This will be found in many\npapers in our Proceedings and elsewhere. The problems\nabout the nature of human personality suggested by\nthese divisions of consciousness are of course of great\nimportance, but do not concern us at this moment, and\nfor simplicity I want to avoid them as far as possible.\nWhat I want to show is that in emerging from a\nsublimmal stratum an idea or intention may be distorted\nor curtailed ; and it will be best to show this in the first\ninstance in cases where there is no question of telepathy.\nExamples may be found among interesting experiments\n\fLXXXIX.] Telepathic Communication\n.\n31\ni described by Gurney in Proceedings, Vols. IV. and V.^\nand by F. W. H. Myers in Proceedings, Vol. VIII. ,^ though\nin neither case were the experiments tried exactly with a view\nI to throwing light on the question now before us. In the\nparticular experiments I am about to quote, ideas were\nimpressed on persons in hypnosis, who were found on\nbeing immediately awakened to have no conscious recol-\nlection of the said ideas. Gurney's subjects while hyp-\nnotised were instructed to write with a planchette a\ni!\nprescribed sentence or sometimes a line rhyming to a\ngiven one. After waking, their hand having been placed\non the planchette, which was screened from their eyes,\nthey were set to read aloud\u2014the idea given to the hyp-\nnotic consciousness emerging meanwhile in planchette\nwriting. In Myers' experiments a post-hjrpnotic crystal\nvision was prescribed and duly experienced. In one case,\ntherefore, the idea emerged in motor, and in the other in\nsensory automatism. In some of Gurney's experiments\nthe readmg aloud did not seem to interfere with the\nperformance of the task set to the subliminal self, but\nin others there was some mutual interference ; the following\nis a case in point.\nP\u201411 was told several times [in hypnosis] '\nIt has left\noff snowing '\n; and then, when woke and set to planchette,\nhe was made to read aloud. The writing which appeared\nwas,\nIt has Ifeft sn\nand while this was proceeding, the reading was bad and\nstumbling. When the writing stopjied, the reading became\nappreciably more correct and fluent. Re-hjrpnotisation\nafforded a glimpse of the condition in which the secondary\nintelligence had found itself. Asked what he had been\ndoing, the 'subject' rephed, \"Trying to write 'it has\nleft off snowing.' \" Asked i\u00a3 he had been reading, he\nsaid, \" Reading ! No, I haven't been reading,\" and added,\n\"something seemed to disturb me.\" \"How was that?\"\n^Peculiarities of certain Post-Hypnotic States, Proc, Vol IV., p. 268\nand Recent Experiments in Hypnotism, Proc, Vol. V., p. 3.\n^ The Subliminal Consciousness, Chap.

[PAET\n\" Something seemed to keep moving about in front of me,\nso I got back into bed agam.\" \" Didn't Mr. Gurney hold a\nbook and make you read aloud ? \" \" No, somebody kept\nmovmg about. I didn't Uke the looks of them. Kept\nwandering to and fro. Horrible, awful ! I thought to\nmyself '\nI'll get into bed.' It looked so savage\u2014quite\nmmerved me,\" etc., etc. (P\/oc, Vol. IV., p. 319.)\nHere we have an illustration of a train of thought and\naction impressed on the hypnotic stratum of the mind,\nworking itself out, but in an imperfect manner, when\nthat stratum (on awaking from hypnosis) has become\nsubliminal. The waking intelligence knows nothing of it\nunless and until it is shown the automatic writing that\nhas been produced without its participation. It has been\naware, however, of some disturbing element, some inter-\nruption to its own proceedings. On re-hypnotisation, it\nis found that the intelligence which has been writing,\nnow no longer subliminal, has been still more aware of\ndisturbance, thoiigh unconscious of the action of the\nwaking intelligence which has produced it. We have\nnot here any reception of a message from the subliminal\nstratum to the sujiraliminal except through the automatic\nwriting, but we have evidence of mutual interference\nbetween the two strata working independently. This may\nhave been due only to the two sections of the mind\nhaving simultaneously to use a common organism to\nexpress themselves. It seems possible that it was the\nmovement of the print before the eyes, or rather of the\neyes along the lines of print, that produced in the sub-\nliminal seK, unaware of the reading aloud, the night-\nmare-ish impression of the disturbance.\nIn Myers's experiments we also have the two strata at\nwork, but as it were in co-operation, not antagonism.\nAs in Gurney's experiment, an impression with instruction\nas to action is given in hypnosis to that mental stratum\nwhich, as soon as the hypnotised person is awakened,\nbecomes subliminal. But the action prescribed does not\ninvolve outward bodily action like the writing. The\nsubliminal is told to produce a visual hallucination, a\n\fLXXXIX.] Telepathic Communication. 33\ncrystal vision\/ representing a subject described to it.\nThis duly occurs and the waking intelligence without\nknowuig the origin of the picture has to observe\nand interpret it. Myers writes {Proc. Vol. VIII.,\np. 460) :\n\" Next time I suggested [in hypnosis] a hippojmtamus\u2014an\nanimal which P. had never seen m the flesh. On being\nawakened he saw on the card what he called a rhinoceros.\nHe complamed that it was rather indistinct ; he was not\nsure whether it had horns or tusks. There is a certain\ninterest m this as indicating that the haUucination was\nfounded upon a mental picture suggested by my words,\nrather than on the words themselves. One might have\nsupposed that, since my whole suggestion consisted of the\nword hippopotamus, the awakened subject, however vaguely\nhe saw the beast, would have knowTi that it was meant\nfor a hippopotamus. But the picture, vague as it was,\nseemed to be more communicable from the hypnotic to\nthe suprahminal self than the word which had originally\ngenerated it. A picture was what had been ordered and\na picture came.\" [Proc, VIII., ^5. 460.)\nI next told P. (hypnotised) the story of Robinson\nCrusoe finding the foot-print and fearing savages. . . .\nAwakened and set before the glass of water, P. at once\nexclaimed, \" Why, there's Buffalo Bill ! He's dressed in\nfeathers, and skuis rormd him ; almost hke a savage.\nHe's walldng about in a waste place. ... I can see\nsomething else coming from another part,\u2014it's a blackie.\n. . . Look at them now, how they're arguing ! Buffalo\nBiU and his black man.\" . . .\nObserve that . . . the footmark, which was the point\non which I had chiefly dwelt, was not observed.\n... P. had read Eobinson Crusoe ; but Buffalo BiU\n^ I call it crystal vision as the hallucinations were of the natvire of\nvisions in a crystal ; but in the eases quoted, what was actually aimed\nat and obtained was in one ease a hallucinatory picture on a blank\ncard, and in the other a moving picture in a glass of water.\nV\n\f34 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part'\nwas plainly fresher in his memory.^ Proc, Vol. VIII.,\np. 461.\nIn the first of these two experiments by Myers, we\nhave indistinctness in the picture evolved and transmitted\nto the sujDraliminal intelligence\u2014probably owing to in-\ndistinctness in the idea which reached the hypnotic\nconsciousness, for I do not think Myers's idea of a\nhippopotamus would hive been distmct, and the percipient\nwas not acquainted with the animal. In the second\nexperiment the hallucinatory vision seems to have been\ndistinct as far as it went, though not apparently com-\npletely representing the scene prescribed. In both the\n\" message \" which reaches the supraliminal intelligence is\nmisinterpreted by it, for in the first it did not mean a\nrhinoceros and in the second it did not mean Buffalo Bill\nI have assumed that the misunderstanding was supra-\nliminal. It is, however, conceivable that it occurred\nsubliminally. The idea derived by the hypnotic stratum\nfrom Myers's words 7nay have been m the first case a\nrhinoceros and in the second Buffalo Bill. But in these\nparticular instances\u2014at any rate the second\u2014I think it\nhighly improbable that there was subliminal misunder\nstanding of what Myers said. The hippopotamus impres\nsion was perhaps too vague to be worth discussing from\nthis point of view, for the same picture might have come\nif Myers had said \" rhinoceros \" and therefore if the'\nsubliminal had wrongly understood \" rhinoceros.\" But'\nthe idea \" Buffalo Bill \" by itself would I think have\nproduced a different picture, and one less appropriate to\nRobinson Crusoe than that produced by Myers's story.\nI think then that these cases (and others might be\nquoted) sufficiently indicate that an idea, even when\nsuccessfully impressed on one stratum of consciousness\nis liable to get distorted before it emerges in another, at\nany rate when the transmission is effected by means of\n1 \" Buffalo Bill\" was an American, touring the counti-y at this time\nwith a show representing the Wild West of America\u2014a show which was\nhaving a great success in this country.\nBoth the above experiments are quoted by Myers in Human Person\nalily, and the first is quoted also in Proceedings, Vol. XIII. p. 59.3.\ni\n:a[\n\f\" Lxxxix.] Telepathic Communication. 35\n^ what Myers calls sensory or motor automatism. And I\nthink we may add that if an idea reaches the waking\nf(\nconsciousness by such means, it is practically certain that\ned\nit has been transmitted from a subliminal stratum. In\nJ,\nautomatic writing, at any rate when not followed at the\ni time by the waking consciousness, ^ this is plainly so, for the\n1\nintelhgence using the hand is subliminal at the moment,\nnt\nso that if the writing contains ideas not in the supra-\ni liminal stratum, they must issue from the subliminal.\neiiJhat the same is true in the case of ideas expressed\nJ\nthrough sensory automatism\u2014say a hallucinatory vision\n\u2014\nlijiis hardly less obvious. For a vision which is first seen\nii\nand then independently interpreted by the supraliminal\ni\nconsciousness, must have been made up, so to speak,\n]]\nsubliminally. The supraliminal intelligence is not aware\na.\nthat such a hallucination is being constructed until it\n;(\nperceives it.\nI All this we shall have to take into account in examining\nj\nthe hindrances encountered by telepathic messages. It is\n5(\npossible that all telepathic communication from outside\nj first reaches a subliminal stratum of consciousness and\n,j therefore has to run the gauntlet of passage from one\n,j stratum to another before the supraliminal consciousness\nJ\nis aware of it. That it has to do so when it emerges\njj\nthrough sensory or motor automatism is I think certain.\n[i(\nIt is worth noting that we are more accustomed than\nIII\nwe sometimes remember to a want of complete under-\nff\n(Standing between two parts of our minds even when there\nt(\nis no question of any abnormal state. When, for instance,\nin writing a letter, we write \" there \" for \" their,\" it is\n55\nnot because we do not know which we mean, or how to\n;i\nspell what we do mean. It must be because the part of\n;5\nour mind occupied with the spelling is attending to the\njl\nidea of the sound, and not to the idea of the meaning,\noj\nThis seems to imply a subliminal element in the ordinary\noperation of writing, which is co-operating imperfectly\nj\nwith the waking intelligence.\n1 The extent to which in automatic writing the waking intelligence\n' Df the aiitomatist is aware of what is being written varies throutrh\nilmost all possible degrees.\n\f36 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nBefore concluding these preliminary observations and turn-\ning to particular cases of apparent obstruction in telepathic\nmessages, I must remark on a very important difference\nin the evidence possible for telepathic messages from the\ndead, and similar messages from the living. In the\nlatter we not only know the message received, but in\nsome cases (such as experimental ones) have independent\nknowledge of the message sent ; and in others (such as\napparitions at the time of the death of the person seen)\nat any rate know independently of some coinciding crisis\nin the supposed sender's state. And in fact the coinci\ndence between the message and what we know of the\nsupposed agent at the time, constitutes a very important\npart of the evidence for telepathy. But in the case of\nmessages from the dead we can have no independent\nmeans of knowing what passes on the supposed agent's\nside. All we know is the message as received, and we'\ncan only judge from this whether a message was really\nsent and what its contents were.\nEven in messages from the living we cannot tell whether\nthe message emerges in a truncated, or distorted, or\notherwise altered form, unless we know exactly what\nmessage was sent ; and this we can seldom know except\nin experimental cases. It is chiefly, therefore, to ex\nperimental cases that I shall refer in this paper. No\nexperiments have, so far as I know, been tried with a\nview to discovering to what kind of alterations messages\nare liable\u2014mdeed it is difficult to see how such experi\nments could be carried out\u2014we, therefore, have to ex-\namine those tried with the object of ascertaining the\nexistence of telepathy.\n'\nI shall illustrate what I have to say chiefly from the\nfollowing series of experiments pubhshed in our Pro-\nceedings.\nT.

[pAKTj ^'^\nOn the other hand the cases where the \" message\n\"\ndoes not get through at all, and the percipient receives\nno conscious impression concerning it, are also, as a rule,\nuseless for our present purpose, for they do not reveal\nwhere the obstacle is.\nA distinction must be drawn, however, between cases\nwhere a particular would-be agent, or a particular would-\nbe percipient fails persistently, and the cases where, with\napparently unchanged conditions, failures occur in the\nmidst of successes. In the former telepathic incapacity in\nagent or percipient would account for failure, but not in\nthe latter. And one would expect in failures amid\nsuccesses, to be able to discover the difference in con-\nditions which must exist and be the cause of failure.\nPractically, however, little or nothing has been done in\n|\nthis direction as yet. These failures amidst successes\nremain unaccountable and are at present of no assistance\nin our present quest. And the same is I think true of\nanother class of case, still more difficult to explain\n\u2014\nthose in which the percipient does have an impression\nwhich to him has all the appearance of being veridical,\nbut which is in fact entirely wrong. In the Brighton\nexperiments it was noticed that some expectation of success\nseemed required to produce any impression\u2014wrong or\nright. At any rate, in sets of experiments where agent\nand percipient were separated by a greater distance than\nusual (which, as already said (see p. 29 ) for some reason\nhindered success), the absence of any impression was more\nfrequent than in unsuccessful sets with agent and per-\ncipient together.\nImpressions are sometimes accompanied by a feeling of\nthe operation of some sort of influence, the absence of\nwhich may be noticed by the percipient when the \" mess-\nage \" does not get through. When this happens it seems\npossible that the want of success is due to the agent\nfaihng to give the message some necessary impulsive\nquality. What I mean is well described by Sir Oliver\nLodge in discussing experiments with Mr. Guthrie's sub-\njects. Miss E. and Miss R. He says\n:\n(tc-\nlestii\nJ\nI re\nIr.\nI\n\fjXxxix.] Telepathic Communication. 39\nWith regard to the feehngs of the percipients when\nreceiving an impression, they seem to have some sort of\nconsciousness of the action of other minds on them ; and\nonce or twice, when not so conscious, have complained\nthat there seemed to be '\nno power '\nor anjrthing acting,\nand they not only received no impression, but did not\nfeel as if they were going to. . . . They both say that\nseveral objects appear to them sometimes, but that one\namong them persistently recurs, and that they have a\nfeeling when they fix upon one, that it is the right one.\nSometimes they seem quite certain that they are right.\nSometimes they are very uncertain, but still right. Occa-\nsionally Miss E. has been pretty confident and j^et quite\nwrong. Proc, Vol. II., p. 200.\nIt would be interesting to know whether the nature of\nhe percipient's impression\u2014visual, auditory, or mere idea,\n;tc.\u2014depends on the agent. It depends partly on sug-\ngestion and expectation, and no doubt partly on the\njercipient's habit of mind ; but is there also some effect\nproduced directly though unintentionally by the agent,\nmd which would vary vt^ith different agents ? In the\nBrighton experiments, one of the percipients\u2014T.\u2014made\nI remark which may be instructive on this point. With\ntfr. Smith as agent trying to transfer numbers, T.'s\nmpressions, whether right or wrong, were generally\nowing I think to our suggestion) visual, though he\nsometimes complained of the numbers being \" such a long\nway off that you can hardly see them.\" But when Mx.\nMyers or Dr. Leaf took the part of agent\u2014in which,\njxperimenting with T., they were entirely unsuccessful\n\u2014\nr., when asked whether he saw or heard the number\nle named, said \" No, I seem to imagine it \" {Proc. Vol.\nVI., p. 161). The non -success of these agents makes it,\nlowever, improbable that their influence had any direct\njffect in producing this result. It is more likely that\nr.'s subliminal represented to him in this way the absence\ntelepathic influence.\nIf we turn now to particular telepathic experiments, and\nlook first for light on the agent's part in the process,\n\f40 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nsomething can perhaps be learnt from cases where two\nor more agents acting simultaneously produce a mixed'\neffect, or when an involuntary idea of one of them seems\nto confuse or supersede the impression it was intended\nto convey. The following case illustrates such superseding.\nI give an abstract of Sir Ohver Lodge's report in Proc,\nVol. II., p. 198, concerning an experiment with Mr. Gutlirie's\npercipients :\nAgents : \u20140 J. L., Dr. Herdman, Miss R d, Miss R.\nPercipient, Miss E. Object, \" a teapot cut out of silver\npaper.'' (Contact.)\nMiss E. [said] \" Something hght . . . No colour . . .\nLooks like a duck. . . . Like a silver duck. . . . Something\noval . . . Head at one end, and tail at the other \"...\nShe drew a rude and perverted copy of the teapot, but\n\" didn't loiow what it was unless it was a duck.\"\nDr. Herdman then explained that he had been thinking\naU the time how like a duck the original teapot was.\nIt may be objected that as Dr. Herdman had no\nintention of transferring his irrelevant idea of a duck to\nthe percipient and there was therefore no voluntary\neffort to project it, he cannot have been the effective\nagent. This raises the whole question of the efficacy\nof voluntary effort, and it is a difficult question. We\ncan say at once that voluntary effort is at any rate\nnot always necessary. For instance in the series of\nexperiments carried out by Mr. Wales and Miss Samuels (see\nProc, Vol. XXXI., pp. 124-217), the agent Mr. Wales made\nno effort to transfer any particular ideas. Miss Samuels,\nhowever, had impressions corresponding unmistakably to\nthoughts of Mr. Wales or events in which he was con-\ncerned. The activity and effort here seem to have been\nentirely on the percipient's side. The same apjjarently\nhappens in some non-experimental cases. Compare for\ninstance a case in which Mrs. Verrall was apparently the\nagent, described in Proc, Vol. XXVI., p. 44-46. It is\ntoo long to quote in full here, but Mrs. Verrall sums up\nher account of it by saying that it is \"I think, indispu-\ntable that they [her daughter and a cousin, who were\n\fLXXXIX.] Telepathic Commimication\n.\n41\ntable tilting] tapped thoughts of mine which I had\ndehberately refrained from commmiicatmg to them.\" On\nthe other hand in IVIr. and IMi's. Newnham's experi-\nments the questions which of course he mtended she\nshould apprehend though she had no normal access\nto them, reached her almost without fail. But answers\nunknown to her, which might have been got out\nof his mind, only appeared in her script in a very sHght\nand fragmentary way. Is it possible that he inhibited\nithem\u2014not voluntarily, but because they were Masonic\nsecrets, and thus as it were locked up in his mind ?\nIntentional agency at any rate serves to mark a par-\nticular idea in the agent's mind, and to associate it with\nthe percipient, and it is possible that this makes it more\navailable to the latter, even if voluntary effort on the\n1 agent's part has httle effect.\nReturning for a moment to the duck and the teapot, we\nmust not ignore the possibility that Dr. Herdman contributed\nlittle or nothmg to the result. The percipient may have been\nstruck with the resemblance of her impression to a duck\nindependently, though if so the idea of \" teapot \" was\napparently entirely obhterated by that of \" duck.\" In\na case of Professor Gilbert Murray's, however, the per-\ncipient must have caught by mistake an irrelevant idea\nof a lady present. He got the impression of \" kangaroos\n\"\nwhen, as she thereupon reported, ^ she had been thinking\nthat a kangaroo or a bear with a visiting book (the idea\ncame from Punch) would be a good subject for experiment.\nThe actual scene the idea of which it was intended to\ntransfer was \" Mr. L beating an egg at Siena.\"\n[Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 98, Exp. 66).\nI have already suggested that telepathic messages first\nreach the percipient subhminally. Erom analogy it is not\nunlikely that it is in a subHminal part of the agent's\nmind also that the eiiective action in telepathy takes\nIf\nplace. If so we can see that somehow the spontaneous\n^\n1 It is of course an evidential weakness, in the case of both duck and\nf\nkangaroo, that the supposed agent's idea was not mentioned till after\nthe percipient had spoken. At the same time a pseudo -memory does\nnot seem probable in either case.\n\f42 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nsubliminal impulses conveying the ideas \" Duck \" and\n\" Kangaroo \" in the experiments just described may have\nbeen more powerful or more accessible to the percipient\nthan the deliberate impulses conveying the ideas intended.\nThe complication of simultaneous transference of different\nideas by different agents, or the transference of two ideas\nfrom the same agents, does not necessarily produce con-\nfusion. Sir Oliver Lodge tried two experiments illustrating\nthis. The following are accounts of them abstracted from\nhis records :\nLi one {Proc, Vol. II., p. 196) two agents were set to\nlook at different drawings\u2014a square and a cross like an\nX \u2014^neither Isnowitig Avhat the other was looking at. The\npercipient Miss R., who did not know that anything\nunusual was being tried, said, \"I see things moving\nabout ... I seem to see two things ... I see first one\nup there and then one down there ... I don't know\nwhich to draw ... I can't see either distinctly.\" Told\nanyhow to draw what she had seen, she drew first a\nsquare, and then said, \" Then there was the other thing\nas well . . . afterwards they seemed to go into one,\"\nand she drew a cross inside the square from corner to\ncorner, addmg afterwards, \" I don't know what made me\nput it inside.\"\nIn the second the object was a tetrahedron outline rudely\ndrawn m projection\u2014a triangle with Imes from the angles\nmeeting in the middle (Proc, Vol. II., p. 199). The\npercipient Miss E. said \" Is it another triangle \" [A\ntriangle had been the subject of a previous experiment.]\nNo reply was given, but Sir Ohver silently passed round\nto the agents a scribbled message, \" Think of a ijyramid.\"\nMiss E. then said, \" I only see a triangle . .\n.\" then\nhastily, Pyramids of Egypt. No I shan't get this.\"\nAsked to draw, she only drew a triangle.\nA source of confusion occurs when in a series of experi-\nments the impression intended to be transferred in one\nexperiment does not emerge till the next\u2014the agent\nhaving meanwhile given vip the first and passed on to\nsomething else. But in such cases, when not due to\n\fuxxxix.] Telepathic Communication. \u2022iS\n3hance, the delay may be entkely in the percipient's mind\nand thus be a case of gradual emergence. Some instances\nwill be found below. In the Brighton experiments, m\nattempts to transfer double numbers, such deferred im-\npressions occurred on one occasion with two numbers\nn succession, in the course of a rather successful set of\nexperiments.^\nThere are cases which suggest that attention devoted\nsuccessively to different parts of the object to be trans-\nferred, by the agent or percipient or both, led to success\nwhen the attempt to transfer the whole had failed. The\nfollowing is a curious one. The attempt was to transfer\na name selected by IVIi'. Guthrie. I abstract from his\naccount :\nHe had just tried with the imagined name Patriclc,\nwith the result that the percipient said, \"Is it Peter or\nPatrick 1\" He then thought of the name Jemima, this\ntime apparently writmg it down. Mr. Guthrie began as\nsole agent but there were three or four others m the\nroom. In what follows the remarks in brackets are Mr.\nGuthrie's. The percipient said, \"Is it Lawrence ? No\u2014\nit looks hke a long name but I cannot see Avhat it is\na bit ... No .. . Angelo is it t\n\" (AU were now shown\nthe name and caUed upon to think.) . . .\"It begins with\na J . . . Oh ! I see a J. (Mr. G. \"Do you see the\nletters as a whole 1 \") \" I'll try to look at the letters.\nOh ! I can see five or sis letters, but can't get the\nname.\" (Mr. G. \"Then you see the letters. Well, take\nit letter by letter. You've named the first letter ;\nnow\nwhat is the next?\") \"Is it E?\" (A'lr. G. \"Right.\nNow the thhd letter.\") \"M\" (\" Righl^the fourth\nletter ? \") \" I \" (\" Right\u2014next letter \"? \") \" Two more,\nhke C.A.\" (\" A is right. Now look at the last letter but\none.\") \" E, I thmk.\" (N.B.\u2014The subject had no idea\nof the name nor of what letters had passed through her\nmind so as to get the name.) {Proceedings, Vol. I., pp.\n279, 280.)\nIt seems certain here that when the spelling letter by\nI See Proc, Vol. VI., p. 161.\n\f44 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PAET\nletter began the agents (as well as the percipient) must\nhave concentrated on the letter required and that this\nmay have helped the percipient ; but her failure to grasp\nthe word as a whole combined with the almost complete\nsuccess in getting the individual letters is curious and\nshows how very vague the picture of the whole, which\nyet apparently existed in her mind, must have been.\nThis contrasts with the previous experiment (Peter or\nPatrick, guessed for Patrick) where the guess seems to\nhave been made from a perception of at least part of the\nname as a whole. Note also the dream-like amnesia for\nthe impressions that had just passed through her mind.\nIt almost looks as if the percipient had fallen into a\nsemi-trance state.\nThis experience brings us to the percipient's side\nin the experiments, but before leaving the agent's side\nit will be well to give a hst of the kind of subjects it\nwas attempted to transfer in the various series under\nconsideration. In a large number of cases it was simply\na visual sensation derived from gazing at some small\nobject\n\u2014\ne.g. an apple or a key or a card or a number or\na diagram. It is a matter of some interest, but not\nalways easy to determine, whether when an impression\nreaches the percipient, it is the idea, or the image, or the\nname of it that reaches him first. To ehminate the name\nsome experiments have been successfully tried with name-\nless diagrams\u2014combinations of lines or irregular shapes\nthat cannot be described by a word or even by several\nwords. Sometimes the object gazed at was a rough\ndrawing by the agent, who thus probably reinforced the\nimpression on his mind. At other times there was no\nactual external object before the agent, but he endeavoured\nto transfer an imagined or remembered object or scene.\nIn such cases there was probably at least a visual element\nin his mental impression and with some agents perhaps a\nvery strong one. In Mr. and Mrs. Newnham's experi-\nments there may have been a visual element in the\nagent's impression as he wrote down the questions which\nthe percipient, without sight or knowledge of them,\nwas to answer by automatic writing. But so far\n\fLxxxix.] Telepathic Communication. 45\n^3 we know there was no transference in visual form\nof any such visual element. The percipient had no\nconscious impression of the question, nor, except on one\noccasion, of the answer,i till she read what the planchette\nhad written (see Proc, Vol. IIL, p. 12). Perhaps\nattempts to transfer quotations, of which there are\none or two among Professor Gilbert Murray's experi-\nments (see Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 102. Exps. 86 and 87)\nshould be classed with transferences of questions, as m\nboth the agent's impression, if visual, is of words. In\nsome of the experiments in which Miss L. Tipping was\nthe percipient {Proc. Vol. XXVIL, pp. 415-457) the agent\nnot only looked at an object but handled it and herself\nexecuted movements in connection with it, and the\nimpression of these movements seems on several occasions\nto have been transferred to the percipient in another room.\nOf course this list of kinds of transference attempted\nis far from exhaustive, even if we confine ourselves to\nthe series of experiments from which I have drawn\nillustrations. Nor of course do these series include all\nthe series in our Proceedings. I have selected those\nseries and those individual experiments which seem to me to\nthrow most light on obstacles or aids to telepathic trans-\nmission. I do not think that we have evidence to show\nthat among methods and objects of transference, one kind\nis in itself more likely to succeed than another. But\nthere is little doubt that some kinds are better adapted\nto some agents and percipients, and other kinds to others.\nSuch differences are very likely to arise both from self-\nsuggestion and from the degree of interest different kinds\nof experiments may excite in different people.\nI now turn to what is the more interesting and in-\nstructive part of our investigation\u2014the percipient's side\nof the transmission.\niThe one occasion was when, in answer to the unseen question,\n\"What name shall we give to our new dog?\" the name ' Nipen '\n(from Feats on the Fiord), not, by the way, thought of by the agent,\nshot into the automatist's conscious mind, just as she was m the act\nof automatically writing it down. (Proc, III., p. 23.)\n\f46 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nI believe, as already said, that what happens in the\ntypical case is that the telepathic impression first reaches\na subliminal part of the mind. From this it is trans-\nmitted to the waking consciousness, emerging in various\nways\u2014as by automatic writing, or in a visual or other\nhallucination, or in a quasi-sensory mental impression,\nor simply as an idea or otherwise. The impression thus\ntransmitted is often indistinct or otherwise obscure and\nneeds interpretation. There are obviously in this process\nseveral opportunities for error to intrude. The impression\nas subhminally received may be imperfect, there may be\ndefect or addition or distortion in the transmission from\nthe subliminal, and there may be misinterpretation of\nthe impression of which the percipient ultimately becomes\nconscious. This misinterpretation moreover\u2014due perhaps\nto guessing or to irrelevant association of ideas\u2014may\nreact on and modify the impression.\nFurther complication is added by the fact that the\nimjiression sometimes is received, or at least emerges,\ngradually, and premature transmission from the subliminal,\nor premature interpretation may produce errors. For\ninstance, in one of Mr. and Mi's. Newnham's experiments\nMr. Newnham who had to preach on the following Whit-\nMonday on the occasion of a Masonic ceremonial, asked\nthe question (unknown of course as usual to the per-\ncipient) \" Give me a text for Whit-Monday s sermon.\nMrs. Newnham wrote with the planchette, \"If I go not\naway, the Comforter will not come to you.\" Mr.\nNewnham writes :\nThe selection of a subject suitable for Whitsuntide is\nplainly the first idea caught by the mtelligence ; so I\nproceeded :\u2014\" That will not do for my subject. I want a\ntext for the Monday's sermon.\" Ajiswer : \"Let brotherly\nlove continue.\" (Proc, Vol. III., p. 21.)\nHere the question was apprehended in two stages. ^\nIf the experiment had been stopped after the first, the\n1 Perhaps in this case the impression first received by tlie subliminal\nwas Whit-Sunday\u2014a mishearing as it were, for Whit-Monday. The idea\nof Whit-Monday may only have reached it when the question was\nmentally repeated.\n1\n\fu>]\nLxxxix.] Telepathic Communication. 47\nk answer given would have been wrong, though it would\nles have shown a partial apprehension of the question.\nIS- Again with the same experimenters the unseen question\nIlls asked being, \" What do I mean by chaffing C. about a\nlet\nlilac tree ?\n\" Planchette replied, \" Temper and imagina-\n)D.\ntion.\" Now this answer apparently implied apprehension\nUS of the fact that there was something about chaff in the\nquestion, for we are told that these two words formed\npart of habitual family chaff, but the question as a\n)i\nwhole had seemingly not been grasped. Mr. Newnham\ntherefore proceeded, \" You are thinking of somebody else,\nm Please reply to my question.\" The answer given was\n\" Lilacs,\" showing a further fragment of apprehension of\nthe previous question though still incomplete {Proc, Vol.\nIII., p. 23). It seems to have been a delayed impression,\nfor Mr. Newnham's second question did not contain the\nword lilacs though he was of course thinking of lilacs.\nAnother complication is introduced in experiments in\nwhich the subliminal mind of the percipient operates,\nby its unwillingness at times to admit ignorance. IMr.\nNewnham was much interested in Masonic archaeology, of\nwhich Mrs. Newnham was completely ignorant. He on\nseveral occasions asked questions relating to this which\nrequired for their proper answer knowledge of Masonic\nsecrets. Answers more or less appropriate were generally\nwritten, but were never correct. They were obvious\ninventions, though sometimes showing fragments of know-\nledge beyond Mrs. Newnham's, of Masonic things. Here\nis a specimen. The unseen question was :\nQ. \" Write out the prayer used at the advancement of\na Mark Master Mason.\"\nA. \" Almighty Ruler of the Universe and Architect of\nall worlds, we beseech Thee to accept this, our brother,\nwhom we have this day received into our most honourable\nCompany of Mark Master Masons. Grant him to be a\nworthy member of our brotherhood ; and may he be in\n!\nhis own person a perfect mirror of all Masonic virtues.\nGrant that all our dokigs may be to Thy honour and\nglory, and to the welfare of all mankind.\"\n\f48 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [pabt\n[Mr. Newnham continues] This prayer was written off\ninstantaneously and very rapidly. It is a very remarkable\nproduction indeed. For the benefit of those who are not\nmembers of the craft, I may say that no prayer in the\nshghtest degree resembling it is made use of m the Ritual\nof any Masonic degree ; and yet it contains more than one\nstrictly accurate technicahty connected with the degree\nof Mark Mason. ... I proceeded to inquire as follows :\n:oiili\nQ. \" I do not know this prayer. Where is it to be\nfound ?\n\"\nA. \" Old American Ritual.\"\nQ. \" Where can I get one ?\n\"\nA. \" Most hkely none in England.\"\nQ. \" Can you not write the prayer that I make use of\nin my own Lodge ?\n\"\nA. \"No, I don't Itnow it.\"\nIn these . . . answers we see a new moral element\nintroduced. There is evasion, or subterfuge, of a more or\nless ingenious kind ; and totally foreign to the whole\ncharacter and natural disposition of the operator. A\nsimilar attempt at deUberate invention, rather than plead\nguilty to total ignorance, is contained in the following\nanswers.\" [Another case is then given by Mr. Newnham.]\n(Proc, Vol. III., pp. 14 and 15.) i\nk\n\u2022k\nThe telepathic experiment here succeeded completely\nEach question, though unknown to her supraliminal\nconsciousness, was evidently entirely apprehended by the\nsubliminal intelligence of the automatist and an answer\nappropriate in form was written.

One of the things most puzzling\nnd difficult to explain is the question raised by Mr.\n[ewnham, why, when the percipient could get from the\ngent's mind the question asked, she could not also get\ncom it the expected answer. This I have briefly dealt\nnth. above, on p. 41.\nThere was at least one occasion when Mrs. Newnham\nid apparently learn telepathically the answer as well as\nhe question, but the answer was very short. A pupil\ni Mr. Newnham's, sceptical about the whole thing, was\nUowed to suggest a question on condition that Mr.\nvTewnham saw it in writing. Mr. Newnham and his\ntupil went outside the closed door of the room where Mrs.\nNewnham was sitting with her planchette, and the young\naan wrote \" What is the Christian name of my eldest\nister ?\n\" On returning to the room they found the\n.nswer already waiting for them\u2014\" Mina.\" This was the\namily abbreviation of Wilhelmina, and was unknown to\ndr. Newnham. It is implied that it was unknown to\ntirs. Newnham also, and unless by some accident she had\nit some time happened to learn what the sister was\nailed, she must, it will be observed, have learnt the answer\nelepathically from the brother, even if the question was\n\/ransmitted as usual by her husband {Proc, Vol. III., p. 12).\nAn advantage of the percipient's impression emerging\nn automatic writing is that there is little or no room for\n1 It seems just possible that the frequent naming of a wrong niunber\nvhen an impression of a number was expected\u2014in e.g. the Brighton\nxperiments, may have been partly due to a strong subliminal dislike\no admitting failure and a determination to transmit to the consciouB\nntelligence, something, even if only a guess.\nD\n\f50 Mrs. Henry Sidgioick.\niroli\nb (\n\\i\n111\nmisinterpretation at the stage at which the waking inlj\ntelligence becomes aware of it. When the impressiorj m\nemerges as a sensory halhxcination, this is otherwise\nas we have akeady seen in cases where it had not beer,\nreceived telepathically (see above pp. 33-35). The possi'\nbilities of misinterpretation are of course liable to b\u20ac|\nincreased, when the hallucination develops gradually. In\nsome of the Brighton experiments, the percipient hypno-\ntised by the agent, Mr. G. A. Smith, was set with opened,\neyes to look at a blank card, on which he was told he\nwould presently see a picture. The agent then tried to\nconcentrate his mind on an imaginary picture, of which\nthe subject had been chosen by Miss Johnson or myseU\nand communicated to him in writing. The development\nof the picture was as a rule slow. The following (see\nProc, Vol. VIII., p. 561) is the case in which it was, I\nthink, slowest and most fragmentary. The subject was\nA Christy Minstrel with a banjo. The percipient (Miss B.j\nsaid, \" There's something long, something round in that\none\u2014a little cage of some sort\u2014something that looks like, jjj.\na cage ;\nyet there's something like a handle.^ A can !\nOh, it's a can !

At this point Mr. Smith had to wake Miss B.\nin order to ask her when she had to go. Finding there\nwas still a little time to spare she was re-hypnotised\nand another experiment tried. The subject this time was|\nA sailing boat on the sea.

But on\nhe other hand the sequence of events strongly suggests\nhat the full impression had reached Miss B. subliminally\nrom the first, but had remained latent\u2014only fragments\neing transmitted to the interpreting consciousness, until\nhe final picture got through.^\nAfter this the attempt to make Miss B. see the sailing\noat was continued, but twice produced nothing but a\nague impression. Then Miss Johnson, who had remained\na ignorance of the subject of the joroposed picture in order\nhat she might be able to talk to the percipient without\nlanger of giving indications, asked whether it was any-\nhing like an animal. Miss B. said, \" No\u2014got some\n)rong sort of things\u2014something at the bottom like a little\n)oat\u2014What can that be up in the air ? \u2014Cliffs I supx^ose\n\u2014cliffs in the air high up\u2014it's joining the boat\u2014oh,\nails\u2014a sailing boat\u2014not cliffs\u2014sails.\" This was not all\nittered consecutively but partly in answer to questions\n)ut by Miss Johnson in order to stimulate the percipient's\nittention {Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 561).\nIn this case until the picture was grasped as a whole,\nhe elements of it seem to have been seen rather vaguely,\nn the one to be now qvtoted {Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 565),\nhe elements of the picture emerged in a piecemeal manner,\n)ut each was definite when it came.

[par'\nwere turned towards me.\" This case is interesting,\nbecause notwithstanding the gradual emergence and tardy\nunderstanding of the hallucinatory picture there is strong\nreason to think that it was the idea of a sandwich man,\nand not a copy of the agent's mental image, that reached\nthe subliminal stratum of the percipient's mind. For the\nagent\u2014Mr. Smith\u2014stated afterwards that he had pictured\nto himself the man and one board facing him. And this\nwas the natural way to think of it, since the subject set\nincluded the advertisement of a play, which of course\nwould only be seen if the board faced the spectator.\nThe percipient's impression was incomplete.\nSometimes when, accordmg to the percipient's description,\nthe development of the picture has reached a point at\nwhich one would have expected the interpretation to be\nobvious, the latter lags somewhat. Thus (see Proc,\nVol. VIII., p. 562) the subject fixed on for the picture\nbeing a man and woman dancing, P. after long waiting\nsaid he saw \" A man and a girl there\u2014a lady and\ngentleman.\u2014He's got his arm round her waist\u2014^they're\nvalsing or dancing something or other \" ; each point being\nstated with an air of discovery, and the arm round the\nwaist not at first suggesting the dancing.\nOn the other hand the idea sometimes came before the\npicture had completed itself. Thus (Proc, Vol. VIII.,\np. 568) the subject for the picture being A mouse in a\nmouse-trap ; P. said, \" I can see something\u2014some lines\ncoming \" (pause) \" still 'those lines and something like\nfa\nIt\nle r\nat!\nlit\noh, I think I know what that's going to be. Is that\nmeant for a mouse trap ?\n\" I asked, \" Any mouse ?\n\"\nP. said : \"I think it looks as if the mouse were trying\nto poke its nose through the bars. I don't think it's\nfancy.\" ^\nIt was possible to have a false picture competing more\nor less with the true one. Thus {Proc, VIII., p. 267)\nthe subject on one occasion was A snake with its forked\ntongue out. P. said, \" I thought I saw something like\none of those men with an ice-cream barrow\u2014caught a\n1 This was seen, not on a card as usual, but with closed eyes.\nIt's\ntiTi\n\fjXXXix.] Telepathic Communication. 53\njlimpse of it\n\"\u2014then\n\u2014\" I just thought I could see some-\nrhing like a snake.

We may observe that\n)esides the irrelevant impression, there was what one may\n;all embroidery on the telepathic idea\u2014the addition of\n;he snake-charmer to the snake. P.'s hypnotic imagina-\ntion must have concerned itself actively with the impressions\nle received on this occasion. P. said once {Proc, Vol.\nVIII., p. 563), \" You could easily fancy anything that\n3ame into your head.\"\nOne evening we got Miss B. to see a hallucinatory\npicture and to write with a planchette at the same time\n[see Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 262-3). Five experiments were\nbried, in two of which there was a visual impression\nmth closed eyes), but nothing legible was written. In\na third there was no visual impression and the writing\nwas wrong. In only two did both methods of externalis-\ning the impression operate. In one of these the results\nof the two methods differed markedly from each other\nand both were completely wrong. There was some\napproximation to the desired impression in the remaining\ncase. The subject was A cow being milked by a dairy-\nmaid. Miss B. said, \" there's an animal I can see, a\nbig one too\u2014biggish looking\u2014got some horns I think.\u2014\nIt's a buffalo.\" She saw nothing besides the buffalo\nand said it was standing up. In the meanwhile the\nplanchette had written \" Cow.\" A few experiments in\nnumber-guessing were also tried, in which Miss B., while\ntrjing for visual impressions of numbers looked at by the\nagent, at the same time had her hands on a table, tilting\nit, here too the results of the two processes were dis-\ncordant.\nThe possibihty of impressions developing differently\naccording to the method by which they reach the in-\nterpreting mtelhgence, or of different impressions, whether\n\f54 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc.

The telepath\nimpact\u2014so far as appears in many of these cases\u2014ma\nreach the waking intelhgence dnect. I am inclined to thin!\nhowever, from analogy, that telepathic communication i\nat least as a rule, a subliminal affair and that when thiiii\ndevelopment of the conscious impression in the cases\nare about to consider is gradual or incomplete, it may liii\ndue, just as in some of the cases above considered, tiClii\ndifficulty in passing from subhminal to supraliminal lli\nand we shall find certain cases where the operation c\nthe subliminal intelhgence is strongly indicated.\nI will begin with impressions visual but not hallucinator\n\u2014not externalised, and illustrate with two cases from Mi\nGuthrie's experiments where the general form and appeal\nance of an object gazed at by the agent seems to hav\nbeen gradually apprehended by the percipient but not a\nfirst its name or meaning. Indeed the first was definitel\nmisinterpreted.\nObject looked at Mr. B's watch held at some little distanc\nbehind the percipient. Percipient says : \"Is it bright\nround ...

Moreover, it is probable that when f\nguess or an interpretation is made it reacts on the im\npression and makes this clearer. Some cases suggesting\nthis will be quoted below ; and we have had evidenc(\nabove, pointing to this kind of action and reaction be\nkill\nheiit\nthis\niniii\nthe\n\fXXXIX.] Telepathic Communication. 55\nween interpretation and hallucinatory pictures. And as\n, matter of fact the same thing happens to us in real\nion perceptions of external things either not very clearly seen\npeiir heard, or capable of more than one interpretation.\n^\nlea I have distinguished between interpretation and guessing,\nlut I must allow that the distinction is not a very well-\ntlii narked one, whether we are concerned with perception of\niia external objects or with mental images telepathically\nuii )riginated. Indeed in a certain sense our interpretations\niii)f sensory impressions might all be called guesses. I\nim, however, usmg the word guess to mean an interpreta-\n..ion which carries no conviction, at any rate before the\nli-uess is accepted and the image has adapted itself to it.\nt(Chus in the first of the above-mentioned experiments\n.he mental image seems to have been of a bright round\n)bject at an uncertain distance and therefore of an\nmcertain size.^ Casting about for an explanation, the\ndea of a button suggested itself as a possible one, but\n}here was no feeling of certainty about it. The per-\n3ipient's mental image was not obviously that of a button\na,nd recognised as such. In the second experiment, shape,\n3olour and size (the drawer knobs of a chest of ckawers\nbeing of much the same size as an apple) are appre-\nhended, and the mental image becomes complete and is\nrecognised by the percipient as an apple. Of course m\nthus figuring to ourselves the process in the percipient's\nmind, there is much of conjecture. All we know is what\nthe agents intended and what the percipient is reported\nto have said, to which we may add the experience we all\nhave of the process of ordinary sensory perception.\nIt may be worth dwelling on this last a little because\nof the importance of its bearing on the interpretation of\nmental images telepathically received. Perception of ex-\nternal objects is in effect the interpretation of sensory\nimpressions. Taking for simplicity one sense only, the\nsense of sight ;\u2014when we say we see anything\u2014a book for\niii\ninstance\u2014we mean of course that certain sensations have\ni^j affected the retina, which with the aid of previous know-\ni For want of recognition of size and consequent confusion compare\none of Miss Tippings experiments quoted below p. 62:\n\fS6 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [par:\nledge\u2014such as what a book is hke, the probabihty thai\na book would be in the place where it appears to be\nand so forth\u2014we interpret as a book. Actually if th(\npresence of a book in that place is expected, very slighl\nsensory impressions will be perceived as a book, and we\nmay in such a case interpret as a book something ir\nfnost respects entirely different. Again, when there ii\nHttle of expectation to guide us, and owing to bad lighl\nor other cause the visual sensation is unusually imperfect\nwe are sometimes compelled to guess considerably beyond\nwhat our visual sensations justify. Mistakes are ofter\nmade in semi-darkness in this way. Selection is anothei\nelement in the process of perception which may eithei\nhelp or hinder correct apprehension. Most of our visua]\nperceptions are effected by a selection of such lines and\ncolours among those presented to us, as we can combine\ninto the image of a probable object. Amusing use is\nmade of this fact in those puzzle pictures representing in\nthe same picture two entu-ely different subjects. One\ninterpretation first strikes us as obvious, but when we\nhave succeeded in perceiving the other, it is sometimes\nquite difficult to perceive the first again at all.\nI will quote next some cases where I think it is pretty\ncertain that no \" guess \" was made. The percipient's\nexperience seems to ha^e been of the nature of a gradu-j\nally developing visual image in the mind, interpreted as'\nthe development proceeded. In the first the image re-\nmained vague and indistinct to the end and it seems\npossible that an initial misinterpretation by the percipient\nabout branches hindered the proper development. The\nimpression may have been like the puzzle pictures just\nreferred to.\nObject looked at by agents, A small toy dog, coloured\nlight brown, with tail extended and in the act of leaping.\nPercipient says :\u2014\" Is it green ? . . .

No\u2014it is steel. . . .\nIt is a pair of scissors standing upright.\" {Proc, Vol. I.,\np. 267.)\nIn the following case it is certain that there was no\nguess. There was an apprehension\u2014probably vague\u2014of\na shape, but no idea attached to it. Experiments were\nbeing made with rough drawings as objects. When the\npercipient thought she had a correct impression she\nunbandaged her eyes and attempted to draw the im-\npression she had had. On one occasion the agent di-ew\nand gazed at a rough representation of a horse. It was\nextremely bad, but nevertheless that it was meant for a\nhorse or something like one was unmistakable. The\npercipient's reproduction, also extremely rough, unmis-\ntakably resembled the original, though not at all like a\nhorse. Almost all that constituted the resemblance of the\norigmal to a horse had been eliminated. The percipient\nin fact cannot have had the idea of a horse in her mind,\nthough she must have had a vague impression of the\nlines of the original. (See Proc, Vol. II., p. 42, where the\ndrawings are reproduced).\nIn Baron von Schrenck-Notzing's experiments with\nroughly drawn diagrams there are instances where the\ncorrect impression is approached through two or tliree\nwrong ones, perhaps not derived from the original at all.\nThis may be a mode of gradual development, but on the\nother hand it may merely be that the percipient has a\nmultiplicity of impressions among which she, as it were,\nfeels about for the right one. (See diagrams 14 and 15\nin the sheets of diagrams following p. 22 of Proc, Vol.\nVII.)\nIn the mental impressions discussed above, it was, 1\nthink, clearly the image of the object to be transferred\n\fk\nfive\nobjt\ncom\ninst\ndpi\nh'Ik\nofi\nI\n5^ Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pariIisS\nthat reached the percipient. What she grasped, partially,\nor completely, was the external appearance. But there arej\nother cases where it is equally clearly the idea rather\nthan the image that is apprehended. This is well seen\nin ]\\'Ir. Rawson's experiments [Proc, Vol. XI., pp. 1-17).\nIn these the agent and percipient each sat with block and\npencil before her and the latter tried to reproduce what\nthe former, unseen by her, was drawing. Sometimes\nthe reproduction was nearly exact (as in the two pigs ori\np. 4) and there is nothing to show whether it was the\nimage or the name that was transmitted. Sometimes, on\nthe other hand, it seems clearly to have been the idea\nor the name of the object that the percipient appre-\nhended ;\nas when she drew a hand (p. 4) in a totally\ndifferent position from that drawn by the agent, and\nsimilarly a ring (p. 5), or a clock and again a 'chak,\ndifferent in character from those the agent had drawn\n(pp. 10 and 11). It must, however, have been the\nimpression of form that converted a waste-paper basket\ninto a barrel (p. 10). And it is very difficult to say\nwhat happened when the agent drawing a match-box, the\npercipient drew what was even more suggestive of a\nmatch-box but in a different position, and then failed to\ninterpret her own drawing (pp. 15 and 16). \" I don't\nknow what I have drawn,\" she said, \"it is a kind of\nsquare inside a square.\" \u2022\nThe \" square inside a square,\"\nresembling the strip of luminous paint on some match-\nboxes, did not appear in the agent's match-box.\nIn one experiment in this series in which a nearly\nexact replica of the agent's drawing\u2014a nose\u2014was made,\nthe percipient apparently first apprehended the idea of\nthe object, or perhaps its function. She said, \"I can\nthink of nothing ;\nI can only hold my nose,\" and presently\nproceeded to draw the nose herself (pp. 9, 10). In one\nof the experiments of Messrs. SchmoU and Mabire series\nit was pretty clearly the function of the object rei^resented\nby the cbawing\u2014that of a musical instrument\u2014that\nfirst reached the percipient's consciousness. The object\nwas a rough drawing of a lyre\u2014its frame resembling the\noutline of a vase with a foot. It had four wires up the\nf\/ir\nw\nits\niiit\ntli(\nNo\n\fLxxxix.] Telepathic Communication. 59\nmiddle connected by a bar across the top. After two\nminutes the percipient said :\n\" I have got the notion of a flute\u2014or of some musical\ninstrument or other.\" (a little later) \"I see many Unes.\nIt resembles a vase, but it is not a vase.\" She then\ncbew and said \" Now it is Uke a harp ;\nthere are several\nstrings\u2014Uke a httle gridiron.\"\nAt the end of the experiment she handed to the agents\nI five drawings showing a progressive resemblance to the\nobject or parts of it, and ending with one very fakly\ncomplete. Here although the idea of some musical\ninstrument was the first thing apprehended by the per-\ncipient, subsequent impressions seem to have been almost\nwholly of form {Proc, Vol. V., p. 190 and for facsimiles\nof drawings p. 213).\nThe point raised above of the reaction of the per-\ncipient's interpretation on his impression is illustrated\nrather clearly, I think, by an experiment in Messrs.\nSchmoU and Mabire's series (Proc, Vol. V., p. 181, and\nfor facsimiles of drawings, p. 210). The object was\nthree horizontal lines of unequal lengths connected by a\nvertical line at their left end. It was hke a letter E with\nits horizontal lines enormously prolonged, and it was not\nintended to represent anything. After a few minutes\nthe percipient said, \"I see three fish on a skewer.\"\nNot being well understood she explained :\n\u2014\" Three fish\nheld by a skewer, that is as they are sold in the fish-\nmarkets ; but everybody knows that !\n\" Then she took\noff her bandage and drew a very rough representation\nof three fish lying parallel, with a skewer through their\nheads. Apparently a mental image of three parallel\nJ\nlines, suggested three parallel fish and was then modified\ne to fit the interpretation.\ns A more unfortunate example of development on wrong\ni lines, due apparently to ideas introduced by the per-\nt cipient in attempts at interpretation, is afforded by one\nt of the experiments of the Misses Tipping [Proc, Vol.\ne XXVII., p. 420). The object experimented with was\ne a gold watch bracelet. Miss K. Tippmg sat at the table\n\fMrs. Henry Sidgwick. [far%\nholding the bracelet up and turning it round and round\nin her hands. Miss L. Tipping in another room (the,\nexperiments were made at the S.P.R. rooms) said :\nYou are sitting at a table in a well ht room\u2014the\nfire seems burning brightly\u2014great sense of comfort\u2014and\nyou are holding a small round smooth object, bright in\ncolour. You have picked it up and keep turnmg it\nround, your hands seem movuig much. It is glowmg\ncolour\u2014orange is the colour I get and its colour is its\nattraction. The object seems very cold and smooth,\nand a great feehng of roundness comes to me.\"\nSo far the description is fairly good and in some\nrespects very good. But at this point the percipient\ngets off the right track altogether\u2014misled perhaps by the\nidea of a round orange-coloured object. She goes on :\n\" I sense a warm country and dark people movmg\nabout\u2014pickmg up fruit\u2014long groves of trees\u2014blue sky\u2014\nand very sunny. Is it fruit you are holdhig ? I get\nmany objects of the same shape. I can't make out if\nit is an orange, or some kmd of fruit with plenty of\njuice. I seem to be tastmg fruit of some kind.\"\nIn the following experiment in Professor Gilbert Murray's\nextremely mteresting series {Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 105)\ninitial misinterpretation by the percipient affected all that\nfollowed. The idea to be transferred was \"The little\ncrocodile on the Captain's trunk and him showing it to\nIsabel a7id me.\" The percipient said, \"Where's Denis's\nlizard gone ?\u2014because I thought it was Denis's lizard\npursumg you and Isabel\u2014the lizard on a bed in a cabin\nand you and Isabel lookmg at it.\" It was not un-\nnatural to mistake a Uttle crocodile for a known lizard,\nespecially if the impression thus mistaken was a rather\nvague visual or semi-visual one. And it must be allowed\nthat, notwithstanding this mitial error, the percipient got\nremarkably near to the agent's idea.\nAssociated ideas sometimes impress themselves before\nthe idea intended is grasped. Thus in one of Mr\nGutlirie's experiments {Proc, Vol. IL, p. 35) the object\nlave\nIn\nif\n'\n(Pre.\nPre\nsail\nhi\nele\n\f^' jXXXIX.] Telepathic Communication. 61\nJid ooked at was a rough bid rather spirited drawiyig of a fish,\nii ipparently swimming. The percipient said almost directly,\n'\nare you thinking of the bottom of the sea with shells\n^.\nmd fishes ?\n\" And then, \"Is it a snail or a fish ?\n\"\n, The figure she proceeded to draw was distinctly a very\n\"\n:air imitation of the original, but justified, in a way which\n^ the original did not, the doubt whether it was a snail or\na, fish. The idea of the bottom of the sea may of course\nhave originated with the agent or the percipient.\n1^' In the next case the agents were probably responsible\n'\nsince the association of ideas was involved in the selection\nof the- object to be transferred. Mr. Guthrie writes\n[Proc, Vol. II., p. 30) :\n\" One evening [during a visit to London] I called Miss\nE and a friend of mine . . . out of the room, and re-\nquested them to assist me in imagining the large stained\nig\nglass rose-window in the transept of Westminster Abbey,\nopposite to which Miss E, Miss E, and I had been\n't\nsitting at the service the same afternoon. I then asked\nf Miss R to say what object we were thinking of. After\n'f\na while she said, \" I cannot tell what you are lookmg at,\nbut I seem to be sittmg m Westminster Abbey, where\nwe were this afternoon.\" After another interval she\ni|\nsaid, \" I seem to be looking at a window,\" and again,\nJ\n\"I thmk it is the window in the chancel with the figures.\"\nJ\nWhen afterwards told which window it was, she said that\nJ\nshe did not see any wmdow distinctly, and certainly not\n,\nthe rose-window thought of.\ni\nIn the following case association of ideas\n\u2014\nMx. Keir\n1\nHardie suggesting the Labour Party\u2014misled the percipient\n\u2022\nProfessor Gilbert Murray, though the result was an amus-\n1\ning derivation from the original. The impression to be\nf\nconveyed was Keir Hardie blacking boots. The percipient\nsaid, \" Hunter's shoes. Labour Party with exceedingly\nbright boots \" {Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 99). One cannot,\nof course, be sure that what the agent actually transferred\nwas what she intended to transfer, but if it was, it seems\nclear that though the idea of Keir Hardie failed to\nemerge in the percipient's conscious impression it must\n\f62 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pabiI\nhave been tliere latent in his mind, and so must the idea\nof boots being blacked. It looks, in fact, as if the com-\nplete idea intended reached the percipient subhminally\nall right, but evolved itself otherwise in the course of\nemergence into consciousness.\nThere are other mental processes besides association of\nideas which may interfere with the successful emergence\nof telepathically received impressions. One is a tendency\nto ignore or reject ideas that the conscious intelligence\ndislikes or that seem to it absurd or unlikely to\nbe meant. This probably happens a good deal with\nsome percipients and might easily happen without our\nknowing anything about it. Here are two instances\nwhere this kind of inhibition nearly prevailed :\nIn one of the Brighton experiments, P. was to see on\na card a hallucinatory picture of A spider in the middle\nof its web. After some time he said :\n\"Now I can see something-\u2014funny shape\u2014don't loiow\nwhat it is either\u2014not quite round\u2014octagonal in some\nplaces\u2014hnes across it\u2014more sides than eight\u2014some broken.\nIf I was to compare it with anything, it would be a\nspider's web ;\nbut it can't be that. There would never\nbe a picture of a spider's web.\" {Proc, Vol. VIII p\n568.)\nIn one of the experiments of the Misses Tipping\nagent and percipient being in different rooms\u2014the\nagent occupied herself mainly with opening and closing\nan umbrella, dancing during part of the time while she\ndid so. The percipient's account of her impression began\n\"your hand seems moving up and down,\" and then\ndiverged into what might be the description of a small\ntable bell, the kind that is struck by pressing down a\nknob. She ended her written description with, \" You\nlift up your hand and let it fall. Several times you do\nthis. The shape seems hke a doll's umbrella, with a\nlittle slender stem.\" She afterwards, but before receiving\nany hint of what the experiment had been, said :\n\" the impression she had got was of her sister moving\nher hand up and down rhythmically . . . She saw an\n0\nlit\nto (\nwlio\nfn\niv\nniai\nKlf\n\fTelepafhic Communication\n.\n63\n;ej object like a mushroom, and, wondering what it was,\na- had kept on thinking of a wee doll's umbrella which she\n!1t had had when a child. She tried to banish the impression\ni as irrelevant.\" (Proc, Vol. XX^^I., pp. 426-428.)\n(It looks as if mushroom shape here had suggested\ni nusliroom size, and so the toy umbrella mstead of a real\nt Dne.)\n=y Another source of confusion is liable to occur when the\n'X\n.dea to be transferred goes beyond what the percipient's\ni'j\nmind can construct from material at its disposal. Thus\nDr. Ermacora tells us that in a dream impressed on a\n1'\n3hild between four and five years of age, a lamb figured.\n^ The child lived at Venice and had never seen a live lamb.\nThe animal that duly appeared was accordingly inter-\ns preted by her as a light -coloured dog.^ {Proc, Vol. XI.,\npp. 251,^252).\nBut it is not only mental habits and associations that\n- are liable to afiect the impression that reaches the per-\n. cipient's normal waking intelligence. Outside things actu-\n. ally occurring or existing contemporaneously sometimes\n3\nseem to mix themselves \u2022\nin and play a part in the result.\nOne of the quaintest cases was when the edge of the\n[ card P. was looking at, cut off part of the hallucinatory\npicture\n\u2014\na vase ivitli flowers\u2014which he should have seen.\nThis is what P. said :\nI see something round, hke a round ring.

The experiments\nare of quite an unusual kind, and the fulness of telepathic contact\nmanifested in them between the sleeping percipient and the secondary\nself (as it probably was) of the agent, is very remarkable.\n2 The impression was evidently confused, which may have been due\n'-\nto distraction in the agent, who, while thinking of a vase with flowers,\ni sat actually facing a pot with a growing india-rubber plant in it.\n\f64 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pari\nYou see something going up and you can't see the topj jj\nbecause of the edge of the paper\u2014it's cut off.

(Proc, Vol. VIII., pp. 565, 6.)\nTwo cases of percipients being apparently aided or\ninfluenced by an object in front of them are recorded by\nMr. Rawson. In the first the agent drew a clock. The\npercipient, Mrs. L, began drawing within ten to fifteen\nseconds and presently said, \"I am drawing something I\ncan see.\" She sketched the clock in front of her on the\nmantelpiece, which was, however, quite unlike the agent's\nclock\u2014a wall clock with weights. {Proc, Vol. XI pp 10\n11).\nThe second case was more curious. The agent's drawing\nrepresented a sand glass. This was unknown to Mr.\nRawson. He writes':\nMrs. B. [the percipient] after waitmg some three minutes\nsaid, \" I can't think of anything.\" In about fifteen\nseconds more she called me and said, \" Look here,\"\u2014\npointing to a gilt four-leaved shamrock like this [drawing\nof it given] which formed an ornament at the corner of a\npicture, frame in front of her as she sat at a table with\nher back to Mrs. L. [the agent] ... \" Look here, Mr.\nRawson, I was looking vacantly before me and I noticed\nthis. It's the only idea I have and I will draw it.\"\nWhen I looked at her drawmg I was astonished to see\nthat she had only drawn two leaves of the shamrock, and\nthose the two [opposite each other] which exactly re-\nsemble the interior of a sand glass. (See Proc, Vol. XI.,\np. 15, where the drawings are reproduced.) i ^\nh\nThe mental process here is somewhat obscure, but it\nlooks as if the idea ^ of the object to be transferred had\n1 I say idea rather tlian form, because the percipient's drawing cor- 4,\nresponded to the glass part of the sand glass\u2014the essential part of it.\nIt ignored the stand, which was prominent in the form of the agent's\ndrawing.

The reason for thinking otherwise, besides the large amount\nI telepathy manifested in the series, is that the selection of the portion\nf the shamrock drawn is a very odd one if purely arbitrary, and is\nscounted for if prompted telepathically.\n\fSSI\n66 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [par!\nme. First, the sense of smell. My daughter [the agent\nthought of Savonarola at Florence and the people burnini\ntheir clothes and pictures and valuables in the square.-\nI first felt, \"This is Italy,\" then, \"This is not modern\"\nand then hesitated, when accidentally a small tarry bit o\ncoal tumbled out of the fire, I smelt oil or paint burning\nand so got the whole scene. It seems as though hen\nsome subconscious impression, struggling up towards eon\nsciousness, caught hold of the burning coal as a means o:\ngetting through. (I am sorry to use metaphorical Ian\nguage, but exact language would be both difficult anc\ncumbrous.) In this case then the information came'\nthrough the sense of smell.\nMrs. Verrall, who reported on the whole series ol\nexperiments, makes some interesting comments on this\npassage in the address\u2014she says {Proc, Vol. XXIX i\np. 85) :\n',\nThe subjective impressions of the percipient as to method'\nare always valuable, and Professor Murray has given us con-\ncrete examples of each of the suggested processes. But a\nconsiderable familiarity with this type of phenomena, both!\"\nas critic and as percipient, leads me to warn the reader\nthat, though the subjective impression is no doubt accu-\nrately noted, we must not accept it unchallenged as an\nexplanation of the process. In other words, while we\nmay grant, for instance, that the smell of a tarry coal\nwhich fell from the fire was the means of translating a\nsubconscious impression into a conscious thought of the\nburning pictures, it is not safe to infer that such an\nincident is a necessary part of the process.

Thus in one of his instances\n^ of a fictitious association of ideas, Professor Murray\n~\nspeaks of hearing a horse in the road outside : \"I have\na noise of hoofs. I expect it's the noise of hoofs in the\n'\nstreet that makes me think of it.\" But in the con-\n^ temporary record of the note-taker we read :\n\" No noise\nof hoofs in the street.\" ^\n^\nIt is a frequent feature of telepathic \" messages, '\nand\nle fact appears in a good many of the cases discussed\nbove, that the percipient's imiDression, even when clear\nnd correct as far as it goes, does not give the whole\nmessage.\" This is a very important thing to keep in\nlind when estimating the value of information tele-\ni athically received. Telepathy, as we know it, even if it\n^' ere more readily available than it is, could not be\nV ;lied on like telegraphy to convey a message accurately\nad fully ; and the message often stops short of com-\n^ leteness for no obvious reason. I will conclude my\nsamination of develojoment of telepathic impressions, by\nJ\nuoting two cases illustrative of this fact. In both the\n^ansmission is very successful as far as it goes. In the\nrst it is also very prompt. In the second the idea\n^1\nmerged by stages.\nThe first is one of Baron von Schrenck-Notzing's ex-\nj, eriments. He, in one room, drew The staff of Msculapius\njl\nith the serpent. The percipient, Fraiilein A., in another\n. )om with the door closed drew at the same time a\nlake\u2014or at least a wavy line with a head and a tail\nJsembUiig the agent's snake. But there was no staff,\nerhaps the percipient had not heard of the staff of\n,j\nllsculapius, and so the idea failed to reach her ; and\n, le report leaves it uncertain whether she even interpreted\ner own rough drawing as a snake. In any case, how-\n.j\n;^er, it is certain that the staff was not represented either\nI\nI form or in idea. {Proc, Vol. VII., p. 12, and page 6\n^\nreproduction of diagrams).\nI\nThe second incomplete impression I shall quote is one\nj\n: Professor Murray's.

Apart from\ndifficulties on the agent's own side, and even when a\nmessage has apparently safely reached some part of the\npercipient's mind, it may fail to pass successfully from\nthat to the normal waking consciousness. And this not\nonly because the impression is sometimes too feeble to\nprevail, but because as transmitted to the normal con-\nsciousness the latter may fail to interpret it. And the\ndifficulties may be aggravated by differences in the results,\naccording as different modes of externalisation\u2014different\nmethods of transferring the subliminal impression to the\nnormal consciousness\u2014are used, and even by deliberate\ninvention in the subliminal mind.\nThe amount of light thrown incidentally in the course\nof our investigation on the telepathic process is I fear not\nvery great.

But he\nidduces instances of other phenomena, now well known and\niommonplace, which half a century ago Avould have been\n\u2022egarded as wildly incredible. For instance, these four, which\nn 1875 \"could not possibly have been foreseen :\n1. A voice spealdng in Paris is heard in Rome.\n2. The germs of disease can be bottled and cultivated\nin a cupboard.\n3. The bones of a living person can be photographed.\n4.

He will permit\nis to say that some facts are usual and some unusual ; but\nle objects to our making two classes, facts that are under-\n:tood and facts that are not understood. For he claims that\nve really understand nothing of the truths of science, whether\n^reat or small.

I can imagine someone saying,^\n\u2014\" Well, after all, tha\nis what the book is, except that the author quotes not onl\nhis own observations but the observations and experimeni\nof many others, so far as they have been made accessibl\nin one of the Romance languages.\" If this were the plat\nit might be supposed that when experiences are cited the\nwould be given in full, with all the precautions and details\nlike a description of some new experiment in a scientifi\nJournal ; so as to enable a student to put himself in a judicia\nposition, and detect, if he can, flaws of observation am\npossibilities of error.\nBut that is not the line taken by a text-book, or by an;\nother summary treatise. Nor is it consistent with Professo\nRichet's plan. It would be altogether too burdensome an(\nbulky to try and cover the ground in that manner. A com\nprehensive treatise can only give a general summary of thi\nmethods and results, with references to the original sources\nwhere the student must look up the details of any particula\npoint he thinks worthy of close attention, in the Proceeding.\nof scientific societies or other contemporary pubhcations. Ful\ndetails are never given in a text-book. And in many text\nbooks no reference to the original source is given. Incidenti\nare copied from other writers, or taken on second-hanc\nauthority from some other expositor.\nHence in judging the information given in the Traite di\nMetapsychique, we must not judge it exactly from the S.P.R\npoint of view. If we do, we shall be able to point out\nlacunae, and even a certain amount of casualness in thf\nnarration, which can only be corrected by supplementary\nstudy of the original record whence the facts summarised in\nthe text-book are drawn.\nIt is famihar to students of science that the original record\nof any experiment or discovery is usually more interesting\nand ilhiminating, when the paper written by the original\ndiscoverer is referred to, than the comparatively brief summary\nin -a text-book can possibly be. Such summaries are of\ngreat value to students, who could not otherwise be expected\nto cover the ground or to know what to look for.

For the purpose of passing examinations, and getting\na ground-work of knowledge, the text-book alone may be\nsufficient. But for anything hke serious study, by a senior\nstudent, of some special phenomenon which attracts his atten-\ntion, references to the original sources are indispensable.\nOtherwise a number of illuminating details may be missed,\nand facts may either be accepted too readily, or, on the\nother hand, rejected too readily; whereas a fuller study of\nthe whole circumstances would supply many missing details,\nand contribute to a fuller and better understanding.\nEspecially is this necessary when dealing with facts to\nwhich we have not a theoretical clue, and which in their\nown nature seem more or less incredible. In all such cases\nno amount of reading would or ought to justify a feeUng\nof complete confidence ;\nnothing can replace first-hand experi-\nence. One object of a text-book is to encourage the student\nto make experiments for himself, to open his mind to the\npossibihties of discovery, and to value the critical care and\niS precautions which have been and must be taken to avoid\ndeception.\nProfessor Richet maintains that he is careful to confine\nhimself to a summary and description of the facts of observa-\ntion and to leave theories to the future. He objects to\nmixing up hypotheses concerning the real nature of the pheno-\nmena at the present stage. The facts as conceived by many\npeople seem to have a distinct bearing on human destiny ;\nand an attempt has been made to build a great theoretical\nstructure upon them.\nBut all this is entirely foreign to Professor Richet's object.\n1, He says in his Preface that he has \"endeavoured to write\nin on science, not on dreams.\" He has therefore confined himself,\nnil or tried to confine himself, to a statement of facts and a\nJ discussion of their actuaUty, scarcely mentioning theories;\n1 for all theories as yet proposed to account for metapsychic\n[i' facts appear to him terribly frail. No doubt some day a\ntenable theory will be formulated ; but the time is not yet,\n;i for the facts themselves are in dispute. Scientific men have\ns hitherto often rejected them mthout examination. Neverthe-\n\f'^'^\nSir Oliver Lodge. [pari\nless in his view the facts are numerous, authentic, and startUng ;\nand he does not see how any unbiassed man of science could\ndare to cast doubt upon them all if he consents to look into\nthem.\nThe three fundamental phenomena of the new science he\nsums up under three heads :\n1. Cryptesthesia (which covers Clairvoyance and Telepathy\nand Premonitions).\n2. Teleldnesis (or movements of inert matter without\napparent contact or known forces).\n3. Ectoplasm (or what are commonly called material-\nisation phenomena : appearances of clothes, veils and\nliving bodies).\nThese, he says, make up the whole of Metapsychics. \"To\nadmit them is to admit a great deal. To go further is to\ngo beyond the present bounds of Science.\" He claims however\nthat these three strange phenomena will have to be admitted,\nwhatever may be the explanation at which we ultimately\narrive ;\n\" although Science, severe and inexorable Science,\nhas hitherto refused to contemplate them.\"\nIt has long been recognised that the main branches of the\nwhole subject are two, the more purely psychical variety\nand the more especially physical variety. The two are prob-\nably connected, but the connection is not always manifest.\nProfessor Richet divides his book accordingly, and calls\nthe two branches\n:\n1. Subjective Metapsycities, including Lucidity of various\nIdnds, Monitions, and Previsions ; and\n2. Objective Metajjsijchics, including physical movements\nexceptionally caused, Levitations, and MateriaUsations.\nThe subjective portion occupies some 500 pages ; the ob-\njective portion, in which he has admitted Hauntings, occupies\nabout 300 ;\nwhile the concluding chapter of the book is a\ngeneral discussion of the phenomena, with prejudice shown\nin favour of normal and material interpretation in terms of\nhuman faculty, and with hostile criticism of the other rather\nfacile hypotheses which have been made by different workers.\nThe treatment, or imphed doctrine throughout, is quite\nappropriate to the attitude of mind natural to an eminent\n\fLXXXIX.] A Text-Booh of Metapsychics. 75\nPhysiologist, accustomed to deal with bodily mechanisms,\nand not ready to admit any kind of supernormal causes\nbeyond unexpected and puzzhng extensions of human powers.\nThe facts of clairvoyance and of Lucidity generally, or\nwhat he recognises as the unexplained human faculties which\nhe sums up as Cryptesthesia, prove, he claims, that in human\nsubconsciousness there are unexpected reserves of intelHgence\nand far-reaching perceptions, not exphcable by the recognised\norgans of sense and transcending the recognised boundaries\nof both space and time. The facts of Telekinesis and\nMateriahsation tend to show that the human organism can\nexert force beyond its recognised periphery, and that temporary\nemanations' from that organism can not only exert force on\ndistant objects, but can also mould themselves into strange\nsimulacra, which for a time can be seen, felt, and photo-\nI\ngraphed, and Avhich imitate, in an extraordinary manner,\nportions of the normal body whence they arose. These ecto-\nplasmic formations are the most incredible of aU, and must\nhave seemed bizarre and almost repellent to any Biologist.\nNevertheless Professor Eichet, in spite of his recognition of\ntheir amazing and outrageous character, finds himself able\nto vouch for them as unexplained and apparently inexphcabie\nreahties.\nAU ideas about the Soul and Survival are foreign to his\nconceptions. He remains a Materiahst, satisfied with expressing\nthe facts in terms of their material substratum, and able to\ndispense with any speculation as to their psychic and spiritual\nnature. Everything is attributed to unconscious and hitherto\nunrecognised latent powers in the human organism. If\ninformation is obtained about things occurring at a chstance,\n\u2014\nthe fact is attributed to the lucidity or Cryptesthesia of the\nunconscious part of the medium, not to the conveyance of\n:| information by some other inteUigence. And when com-\nm munications are received, apparently from some deceased\n1\nI\nperson, about things which he alone might be supposed to\nknow,\u2014that also is attributed to the same kind of cryptes-\n: thesia, called forth and directed by means unknown to us,\nso as to operate unconsciously on the bodily mechanism.\n!\nAnd in such cases the impression produced, on the medium\nand on those present, is liable to take the form of a dramatic\n\floft'\n76 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part 0'\nsemblance or impersonation, so striking as to lead them to|\nimagine that the deceased person is in reality exercising some!\ninfluence ;\nit appears that he is acting as if he still retained! flich\nconsciousness and memory, and as if he utiHsed the medium's\nmechanism, and worked it as he used to work his own, so\nas by its aid to be enabled to communicate.\nWhereas, on Professor Richet's view, or at least on what\nhe considers for the present to be the only scientific view,\nsuch deceased persons, having lost their brain and bodily\nmechanism, have ceased to be, and are obviously incapable\nof doing anything whatever, let alone still possessing the\npower of giving any information or showing signs of intelli-\ngence, even though the intelligence shown is such as otherwise\nmight naturally be attributed to them. To suppose that\ndeceased people are able to communicate, or even that they\nare still in any state of existence, is to him a hypothesis, a\nspeculation, at present not scientifically justified. We must\nbe satisfied to record the facts, and leave the interpretation\nto the future. Though it must be admitted that a strong\nprejudice against the usually adopted explanation may lead\na critic, even one who tries to be scrupulously fair, into\ndiscounting and occasionally misrepresenting some of the\nfacts which he is trying to record. He may, for instance,\nbe tempted to bring an accusation of triviaUty and improba-\nbility to bear on cases which, to a less prejudiced mind,\nwould emancipate themselves readily from any such accusation\nSo far I have attempted to give some indication of the\nnature and scope of the book, which undoubtedly is a very\nimportant pubhcation, and is bound to have a considerable\ninfluence on the future development of the subject. It may\nnow be well to add a few points of genial criticism.\nAnd first on certain small matters of nomenclature. Pro\nfessor Richet's object in his nomenclature is to avoid anything\nin the nature of hypothesis. But the term \" Cryptesthesia,\"\nwhich he prefers to Lucidity or Clairvoyance and Telepathy,\ndoes seem unintentionaUy to convey the hypothesis that the\ninformation obtained is got by an extension of the powers,\nor by an enhanced sensibiHty of the organs of sense ;\nbeing\nallied to the words Telesthesia and Hyperesthesia, which are\n4\n\fjXXXIX.] A Text-Booh of Metapsychics. 77\nntended to convey that implication. Something of that\nlort may be true, but it is unwise to assume it. A term\nyhich seems to assume it may become a troublesome trap.\n^Nevertheless an assumption of that kind does seem acceptable\n;o Professor Richet, for says he :\n\"... I prefer to imagine an amazing retinal vision of\nwritten words (he means in a sealed box or at a great\ndistance) than a reading of my brain wherein nothing\nis written, but in which there are so many impressions,\nmemories, and exceedingly complex and evanescent com-\nbinations that are really ultra-microscopic modifications of\ncellular protoplasm, and have no relation, apart from\nmy own consciousness, to the sound or to the phonetic\nsign of a name. To say \"telepathy\" explains nothing.\nCerebral vibration, conscious or unconscious, is a profound\nmystery, much more mysterious than a signature, which\nis a positive, real, and tangible thing, and would be\nvisible to sight if sufficiently penetrating ; whereas the\nreading of a thought cannot be explained by any intensi-\nfication of any of our senses.\"\nFrench Edition (p. 76).\nEnghsh Edition (p. 66).\nAfter some illustrations he goes on :\n\" Some go even further. As there are facts known\nto no living person, but known to B., now dead, this\ncan still be explained by telepathy\u2014it is still by telepathy\nthat the thought of B., deceased, has been transmitted\nto the percipient.\nThese wire-drawn explanations amply show that we\nknow absolutely nothing of the means whereby cryptes-\nthetic cognitions reach the mind . . .\nI think it best to keep within the Umits of rigid science,\nand to say\u2014At certain times the mind can take cogniz-\nance of reahties which neither our senses, our insight, nor\n1\nour reasoning, permit of our knowing.

[pabi\nthe reahty alone is sufficient, without its having passed\nthrough a human mind.\nLet us go no further, and in presence of these unusual\nfacts let us be content to say that our mental mechanism,\neven more complex than it seems, has means of cog-\nnizance that escape analysis and are even beyond surmise.\nThis dispenses with all hypothesis ;\ni\nit does not imply\nthat cryptesthetic knowledge arises from transmitted\nvibrations of human thought; it merely states a fact,\nand it is more scientific to enunciate a fact without\ncomment than to enmesh one's self in theories, such as\ntelepathy, which are entirely unproven.\n\" Telepathy \" imphes a hypothesis :\n\" cryptesthesia \"\nhas the great merit that it does not. If A. sees his\ndying friend B. at the moment of death it is a hypothesis\nto say that the thought of B. has been transmitted to A.\nBut it is no hypothesis to say that A. has some special\nsensibihty that makes him aware of the death of B. . . .\nTherefore, when in this book telepathy is spoken of,\nas it often A^ill be, it must be understood as a particular\nform of lucidity, and not as a distinct phenomenon. ,\nBoth are equally mysterious.\"\nThe last thing I want to do in a review is to argue the\nmatter with the author. My object is rather to present his\ncase. But when it comes to theorising or speculating\u2014which\nis inevitable however much one tries to refrain from it,\u2014the\nidea of attributing a sort of omniscience to the unconscious\nself of the medium strikes me as so far fetched and intrinsi-\ncally absurd that I may be allowed to indicate briefly the\nargument- on the other side, which I will do by paraphrasing\nsome words of Mr. J. Arthur Hill, since they summarise the\nposition in a clear and crisp manner. He writes to me in\na letter something like this :\nTo yield preference to the hypothesis that Mrs. Piper's\nsubliminal somehow has access to the memories of, say, G. P.,\nrather than to the hypothesis of the continued existence\n1 I interrupt here to say that the word \" mechanism \" in this con-\nnexion is full of hyi^othesis; and so is the word \"sensibility'\" further\ndown.\n\f161\nLxxxix.] A Text-Book of MetapsycMcs. 79\nof G. P., appears illogical. The assumption of quasi-omni-\nscience, or access to a cosmic reservoir of information and\npersonal memories, is a step further from fact than is the\nidea of personal survival. We know at least that G. P. did\nexist, so there is nothing absurd in the supposition that he\nmay still exist, if the facts point that way ; whereas nothing\nhas ever suggested the possession by a human being of anj^\nkind of omniscience. Moreover, even if the idea of indefinite\nextension of cryptesthesia or latent sensibility could be ration-\nally entertained, there would still be the searching question\nto answer ;\n\u2014\" From among the mass of material thus open,\nwho selects the appropriate details \" ?\nI (0. J. L.) put this question to Richet briefly and forcibly,\n\" Who selects ?\n\" Qids deligit ?\nIt is permissible to add that the fact of telepathy or trans-\nmission of ideas between living persons, without perceptible\nuse of the organs of sense, makes it easier to accept the\npossibility of telepathic communion with a discarnate mind.\nThe term \" discarnate mind,\" or mind dissociated from matter,\nno doubt to Richet sounds absurd. But probably a Physicist\nis more accustomed to non-sensible and immaterial conditions\nthan is a Physiologist. A Physiologist is bound to search\nfor mechanical and molecular processes in the complex organ-\nisms he studies ; and very admirable and successful has been\nhis search. But a Physicist has had to learn, among other\nthings, that in the ether of space there are no molecules, no\nChemistry, and perhaps no ordinary Mechanics. He is not\nunaccustomed to encounter a thing sui generis, with properties\nof its own, distinct from the properties of the atomic and\nmolecular aggregates with which our animal-derived sense\norgans have made us obtrusively familiar. Professor Richet\nwould probably agree that to state a fact in terms of matter\nis after all no full and ultimate and final elucidation. Mystery\nremains even when such a statement can be made. So why\nlay undue and exclusive stress on what is after aU an inter-\nmediate stage of exposition ?\nRichet is quite within his rights in feeUng any form of\nspiritistic hypothesis highly improbable. But he must not\n\fSir Oliver Lodge. [paei\nsuppose that either in his mind or in his book he is refraining\nfrom theorising. Witness such passages as these :\nIt\nEverything seems to prove that the intelligence is a \u00ab\u00ab\nfunction of the brain, that it depends on the integrity lil\nof the cerebral mechanism, and on the volume and quality\nof the blood that irrigates it.\nIt is possible, it is even probable, that there may\nexist in nature other intelligences under other conditions\nthan the physical conditions of terrestrial life ; but they\nwould no longer be human intelligences . . . They\nwould not belong to humanity; since the mind, whether\nhuman or animal, can possess the human psychological\ncharacteristics of consciousness, memory, sensibility, reason,\nand will, only if the brain exists.

Some approximation to one of\nthe normal methods of conveying human thought is altogether\nmore likely.

Whatever may turn\n3ut to be the truth about such a matter, to state with our\npresent dearth of knowledge that there must be such a vibra-\ntion is merely dogma. So that when Richet says that a\ntelepathic impression must be due to some unknown vibration,\nlie is theorising.\nHe seems rather enamoured of the word \" vibrations \"\n;\nspelled the same in French as in English, and I suppose\n\fSllll\n82 Sir Oliver Lodge.

Of Hallucination, for instance, he sayi j,,,:\non page 708,\n^\n... in order to produce a veridical hallucination there\nmust be some kind of exterior cause or molecular vibra\ntion that starts the cryptesthetic emotion ;\nthough he admits that these \" vibrations \" do not resemblt\nordinary mechanical molecular vibrations.\nHe further says that in the case of collective hallucinations\nwhen several persons simultaneously see the same apparition,\nit is impossible to deny the objectivity. One can hardly\nsuiopose, he says, that these images which many people see,\nhave no objectivity,\u2014are not mechanically objective. But\nother views have been held and discussed by Myers and\nGurney.\nSo that the only theorising he really seems to object to.\nstrongly is the variety v\/hich is connected with spiritistic\nhyiDotheses. It may not have occurred to him that any\ntheory is implied in ordinary materialistic views; to him\nthey seem axiomatic. But confidently to assume their neces-iy\nsary truth and completeness is to close the door to a possible\naspect of the subject which many students have been driven\nto, in spite of their initial materialistic predilections.\nI see that Professor Richet not only objects to the term\n\" supernatural,\"\u2014which many people do,\u2014but also objects\nto the term \" supernormal,\" which Myers devised in order\nto take its place. He says that both terms are inadmissible,\nthat there can be nothing in the universe but the natural\nand the normal. \" From the moment that a fact exists, it\nis necessarily both natural and normal.\" I do not know\nwhether the French word normal conveys a significance\ndifferent from ours, but certainly the phenomena of Meta-\npsychics are not normal in our sense of the word. They\nmay be real, they may be natural ;\nthey may even some\nday seem connnonplace ; but certainly, in the present state\nof human knowledge, they are not customary, or universally\nadmitted, or normal. They do not come up, either, to\nany recognised standard or norm. They lie outside our regular\nexperience. They are astonishing, extraordinary, supernormal.\nThis is evidently a limitation depending on the present\nay\nill\nIf\n1 HV\nI\n\\ Me\nieim\nitas\nBfl\n\fiaji\niXXXix.] A Text-Book of MetapsijcMcs. 83\nstandard of human attainment. But then, what else is language ?\n,\nProfessor Richet's objection to the term, however, is interest-\nng, because it emphasises his object, which is to bring these\nahenomena out of the region of the occult and the mysterious,\nnto the region of the normal through unusual faculties of\nnanliind. \" Unusual \" he will -perforce allow : but \" suj)er-\nlormal \" he will not. And that is a brief summary of his\ntheoretical position throughout the work. His hope and\nendeavour are to trace and attribute everything to the normal\nacuities of man, without bringing in outside and hypothetical\nnfluences of any kind whatsoever. Not that he is foolishly\niogmatic enough to deny the possibility of such influences,\njut because he considers that they are beyond the scope of\njresent science ; and his object is to be purely scientific.\nWhether he will succeed in influencing his biological colleagues\n'avourably, by this cautious attitude, is doubtful ; but at\nmy rate it seems to give him some advantages, and inspires\nlim with an easy boldness in narrating the queerest facts.\n3e can feel sure that his sanity will not be called in question,\n^d, after all, what the theoretical view of anj^ one person\nnay be at any given time\u2014even a Professor Richet,\u2014is\niomparatively unimportant.

Criticism of course\ns far from silenced ; no one would wish it to be silenced ;\n5ut the dawn of. a more enlightened day seems approaching.\nCkiticisms of Detail.\nSo far for a general and appreciative survey of the book,\nit is rather a thankless task to descend to details and especi-\n\fI\n84 Sir Oliver Lodge. [pAEl|\nally into minutiae of criticism. But from the S.P.R. point\nof view it is necessary to say something in that direction.\nOtherwise a wrong impression may be conveyed as to the\nprecision and care taken in the selection and treatment of\nthe selected examples.\nIt appears certain and very natural that Professor Richet\nhas paid more attention to the physical and physiological\nside of things than to the more purely psychic phenomena,\nnotwithstanding the abundant space which these latter occupy\nin his book. He is not as familiar with the evidence collected\nby the S.P.R. as he doubtless is with the details of many\nother enquiries. And unintentionally he occasionally mis-\nrepresents it. It seems desirable therefore in the interests\nof truth that a few of these misrepresentations, or occasional\nerrors of detail, should be pointed out, so as to put students\non their guard and make them realise how necessary it is\nto refer to the original authorities. Unfortunately the reaUy\noriginal authorities\u2014at least in English cases\u2014are rarely cited\nor apparently referred to by Richet, who seems content with\naccepting his foreign matter in quotations by others, or to\ndepend often on abbreviated translations. He therefore does\nnot always do full justice to the exact record, sometimes\ntending to appreciate it somewhat, sometimes unduly to\ndepreciate it ; and apparently insignificant details, like proper\nnames and places, are treated rather casually. He probably\nconsiders that he has an instinct for the essential, and can\nafford to slur over the rest. The S.P.R. is more laborious\nand cautious, for it is conscious that it does not precisely\nknow which points are essential. And its leaders cultivate\na habit of scrupulosity about detail which may be wearisome\nbut is a defect on the safe side.\nThe important branch of the subject called by the S.P.R.\n\" Cross-correspondence \" seems to have been totally mis-\nconceived by Richet. Most of the instances which he gives\nare mere instances of telepathy, not of cross -correspondence\nat all. This absence of understanding about the meaning of\nwhat has been termed cross-correspondence is a defect which\nI feel sure he will wish to remedy. At present the heading\naffixed to that section of the book is misleading.

If he sees apparitions\nit is because the apparitions have an objective reality.\" But\nthis is contrary to the evidence collected by Gurney in Phan-\ntasms of the Living, and also to that collected in the \" Census\nof Hallucinations.\" (See Proceedings, Vol. X.) So that this\nmust be regarded rather as a dogmatic assertion than as a\ncarefully considered estimate, if the word \" hallucination\n\"\nis used in the S.P.R. sense. But, as I point out later, Richet's\nterminology is rather different, and his use of the word hal-\nlucination, as an impression not caused by anything outside\nthe patient, does require a pathological cause. I emphasise\nthe different signification of the term here, because otherwise\nreaders of the book who are familiar with the Proceedings\n'S.P.R. may be misled.\nIn the rapid summarising of recorded evidence there is\nalways liable to be some slight error, sometimes unimportant,\nsometimes important. And it may be helpful if I record a\nfew which have been noticed. First, certain questionable\nassertions about exact time.\nPage 379.\nMrs. Green's dream of drowning girls. Judging by the dates\ngiven, the dream as recorded occurred twelve hours after the\ndeath, not \"a cette meme heure.\" This error is quite ex-\ncusable, however, for when the case was first printed in the\nJournal S.P.R. the percipient had attributed the wrong sign\nto the difference of longitude. The correction was made later\nin Phantasms (Vol. I., page 376, footnote), and in an\narticle by Myers in the Proceedings. This case is a good one,\nand is often quoted by Richet. He will recognise that it\nis important to make no error about coincidence of time,\nbecause that may clearly affect a subsequent explanation.\nPage 305.\nThere seems no evidence in the record that the death of\n\f86 Sir Oliver Lodge. [par'\nMrs. Bagot's dog occurred on the same day as the vision\nthough it is clear that the vision occurred before the perci\npient loiew of the dog's death.\nPage 381.\nI am told that the Griffin vision preceded death by aboul\ntwenty minutes, and was not accurately at the samt\nmoment.\"\nPages 384 (the Jukes case), and 394 (the Runciman Haggil\ncase).\nThe discrepancy in time was a few hours.\nPage 406. (The Williams case.)\nThe death appears to have occurred about two days later\nthan the dream.\nThe compilers of Phantasms of the Living paid particular\nattention to time ; not only for evidential reasons, but because,\nworking on the h3rpothesis of telepathy, an impression received\nbefore a death could be attributed to the unconscious agency\nof the still living person ; whereas, an impression received\nsome time after the death of the presumed \" agent \" would\nhave to be attributed either to telepathy from the dead or\nto deferred telepathy from the living. If telepathy is thrown\noverboard, and a general crypt esthesia substituted, details\nabout time probably seem less important.\nMyers went so far as to suggest the plotting of a sort of\nprobability curve representing the time interval (before or\nafter) between death and apparition. The sort of curve he\nmeans, and indicates on page 427 of Vol. V., Proc. S.P.R.,\ncould easily be assimilated by a physicist to Maxwell's law\nof the distribution of velocities among the molecules of a\ngas. The curve of Maxwell is shaped like this :\nand its equation is\nTT\nT\nP\nP\nto\nwas\nIk\n\fLxxxix.] A Text-Book of Metapsychics. 87\nThe point A would correspond with the instant of crisis\nor death.

[paeI\nRichet appears to be under an important misapprehension\nabout the experiments with G. A. Smith by Gurney and\nMyers. He thinks that G. A. Smith ultimately denied these\nexperiments (page 104). But that is not so. By the way,\nthe reference given to these experiments is wrong ; those\npuMished in Volume VIII. of Proceedings were an entirely\ndifferent set. The invented denials and supposed surreptitious\nmethods, published long afterwards by Blackburn (called by\nRichet, Blackman) in a newspaper article, are worthy of no\ncredence. For Blackburn turned out to be a scoundrel.\n(See, for a full account of the newspaper correspondence,\nS.P.R. Journal, Vol. XV., pp. 115-132.)\nThe following brief extract will show what G. A. Smith's\nattitude was. Blackburn had concocted his article for John\nBull or some other paper, under the impression (which he\nadmits) that Smith and all who could contradict him were\ndead. Says G. A. Smith :\n\" Let me say at once that Mr. Blackburn's story is a\ntissue of errors [this is a mild term] from beginning to\nend.\nWe never contemplated the possibihty of '\ncoding\n'\nuntil we learnt it from Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney them-\nselves.

This and other\nstill more ingenious suggestions of Mr. Gurney, concerning\npossible and conceivable tricks of signalling, were later repro-\nduced by Blackburn as having been the means by which\nthe feats were actually done.\nIroi\nEVIC\nbvi\nik\niei\nmdi\nsely\non\nh\nm\nlatl\nii'ft\nbee\n\fBl XXXIX. ] A Text-Book of Metapsijchics. 89\n01 Later Mr. G.

The subsequent detection and\nadmission of signalling between these girls, on later occasions\nwhen one was agent and another percipient, do not really\nundermine previous experiments, when the investigators them-\nselves were the agents. Sir William Barrett sets special value\non his original experiments with the Creery children, because\nhe regards them as essentially the scientific discovery, as\nopposed to the mere popular suspicion, of the fact of tele-\npathy or telepathic lucidity ;\u2014a fact which, however inter-\nipreted, has since been so amply confirmed. So ample has\n'been the confirmation of this kind of lucidity, in other cases,\nthat Professor Richet is well within his rights if he prefers\nto ignore any experiments on which any kind of doubt or\nsuspicion can be thrown by reason of subsequent mal-practices.\nGurney's statement on the subject is in Proc. S.P.R., V.\npp. 269, 270. Some account of these and other early tele-\npathic experiments are given in Phantasms of the Living,\n\f90 Sir Oliver Lodge. [paB'\npp. 10-31.

S.P.R. It is tiresome to have to read the full record\nin order to find out what sort of case it is and what\" it is\nall about. A short summary would tell us this, and then\nthe record would be there for study and minute scrutiny\nin sucli cases as seemed worth while.\nlib\np\ndi\n\fii iLXXXix.] A Text-Booh of MetapsycMcs. 91\nRichet's Terminology.\nIt may help a reader to know that what the S.P.R. called\n\" Phantasms of the Livhig \" (or of the Dead for that matter),\nand \" Monitions,\" Richet calls sporadic cryiDtesthesia\n\"\n{cryptesthesie accidentelle):' The S.P.R. similarly called it\n\"Spontaneous Telepathy,\" a term which is much the same,\nthough rather more definite, and therefore Avith the chance\nof being rather more wrong (or perhaps right).\nWhat is commonly called \" Psychometry \" (which he stig-\nmatises as \"a detestable term\") Richet styles \"Pragmatic\ncryptesthesia,\" because it is excited by or in connexion with\nsome material object ;\nthough he thinks it doubtful if material\ncontact with any object is really necessary.\nPrevisions are \" Premonitory cryptesthesia,\" and may, he\nsays, be either due to some form of auto-suggestion or un-\nconscious self inference, or may be received under hypnotism,\nor may simulate spiritistic influences. Such premonitions\nmay relate to sickness or to death or to accidents or to\nsundry events.\nIt is noteworthy that Richet does not use the word \" hal-\nlucination \" freely, as the leaders of the S.P.R. have done\nor used to do ; for he considers that about an hallucination\nthere is something morbid, and if an apparition or other\ndeceptive appearance represents or corresponds to some kind\nof reality, no matter how remote, that subjective vision or\naudition is not strictly an hallucination. He interprets that\nterm as signifying \" a mental image exteriorised without any\nexterior reality.\"\nIn general we may say that Professor Richet's independent\nattitude and freedom from tradition are rather refreshing,\nikj We in this country are apt to follow a lead or general trend,\nJ especially in writing for the S.P.R., the cautious attitude of\nIII whose founders we more or less admire and desire to imitate.\nRichet is emancipated from this tradition, and, by following\n\u2022\na course of his own, sets things under a ncAV aspect.\nRichet's Chapter VII. contains a remarkable summary and\ndiscussion of cases of prevision ; for this surprising extension\nof human faculty evidently impresses him considerably, and\nthe more difficult he feels it of any rational explanation, the\n\f1\n92 Sir Oliver Lodge. [pAR'i\nmore closely he attends to and collects the evidence. Ir!\nthe end he considers it established, though he admits the\ndifficulty of reconciling such a faculty with other experiences\nand human instincts in general. This section is perhaps the\nmost notable and carefully compiled in the subjective portion\nof the book. He knows how extraordinary such a faculty is.\nand how strong the evidence necessary to establish it, but\nhe perceives that the evidence is strong enough. So he has\nfaith that an explanation will be found in time, and that\nthis phenomenon, together with all the other facts he deals\nwith, will presently fit into their niches in an orderly system\nof ascertained truth.\nIn contrast with his acceptation of prevision, may be in\nstanced his rather hypercritical attitude to what he calls\n\" Xenoglossie.\" The instances he cites of this speaking or\nwriting in unknown tongues are impressive, especially those\nin which a child is the operator; but he disdains to con-\nsider anything of the nature of partial possession or \" control,\"\neither in this or in any other connexion ; and he sums up\nby saying that :\n\" none of the facts, whether of Xenoglossie or of automatic\nwriting by children and unlettered persons, carries sufficient\nweight of proof. We cannot therefore grant them full rights\nof citizenship in the kmgdom of subjective metapsychics,\nthough I am inclined to thmk that before long some may\nbe admitted as authentic.\"\nChild prodigies, musical and other, are dismissed too, as\nexplicable by abnormally rapid development ; and when\nemphasising his own personal knowledge about the marvellous\nprecocity of Pepito Arriola, who was \"a skilful musician at\nthe age of three years and three months,\" he says that \"no\none has imagined the intervention of a spirit to explain it,\"\nBut it is difficult to contemplate some of these child and\nanimal prodigies, when weU evidenced, without at least sur-\nmising some form of outside intelligent control, I really\ncannot contemplate an untrained organism playing the piano\nor the violin, or writing Greek or even ecclesiastical Latin,\nmerely under the influence of its own unconscious or reflex\naction.\nCod\nct\n1(\ndie\nm\nI\nfb\nIks\nexpli\nSlid\nmay\ntlier\nStllf\nTO\ntrie\n4'\n\f;XXXix.] A Text-Book of Metapsychics. 93\nPhysical and Physiological Phenomena.\nConcerning the physiological phenomena treated of in the\nlecond half of the book, it would be an impertinence for me\n;o criticise or even to praise Professor Richet's investigations\nmd conclusions. In his own subject he is beyond my reach.\nBEis medical training gives him many advantages ;\nand of\n;he abnormal or unusual in this du'ection he has seen much\nnore than I have. It was indeed only through his kind\nnvitation and hospitality that I was enabled to see what\n[ did, in 1894, of the Eusapia phenomena, under admirable\n;onditions on his Mediterranean island (see Journal S.P.R.,\nVol. VI., pp. 306-360). We never got the conditions so good\nigain ; and phenomena fluctuated, till in England they almost\npetered out. Some were genuine even then\u2014notably the\nswelling of a curtain\u2014but Professor Richet may be assured\nthat Eusapia did get a hand loose, by surreptitious and\napparently rather practised means. I pass no condemnation\non her, for various reasons, but such is the fact.\nI am able however to vouch for genuine and unmistakable\nphenomena on the island, as strongly as Professor Richet\nhimself. Some of them were totally and even absurdly in-\nexplicable by any amount of hand or foot loosing, even if\nsuch loosing had been allowed ; which it is safest to assume\nmay have been done sometimes, however unUkely it may\nseem. '\nI have no fault to find with Richet's very brief summary\nof a few of our experiments on the He Riband with Eusapia.\nPhenomena were obtained which were undoubtedly genuine,\nand which overcame all suspicion. But his idea of what\nwent on at Cambridge is vague, and he may think that\nthere was no fraud. But there was. Hodgson pretended\nimbeciUty, and Eusapia fell into the trap. She adopted a\nstupid though rather skilful trick. The results so obtained\nwere feeble, not at all of the old order, and I found it\ndifficult to suppose that she was trying to fool Hodgson.\nFortunately, before the end, she tried to fool me also ;\nand\nI testify that undoubtedly she contrived, by a substitution\ntrick, to get a hand loose when I and Professor Sidgwick\nwere controlling. Myers was disgusted with her, and the end\n\f94 Sn Oliver Lodge. [pargIsS\nwas rather painful. But later on, at Richet's invitation\nMyers was prevailed on to see her again in more congenia;\nsurroundings, and his confidence in her possession of rea]\npowers\u2014however much when under difficulties she might\ntry to eke them out\u2014was restored. j\ni i\nTo throw away good experiments because of some bad\nones is an unwise procedure : and few discoveries could be\nmade if that policy were adopted in a laboratory. Laymen\nthink that Nature never deceives ; but she does. Caution\nand repetition, and renewed caution, and varying conditions,\nand repetition with greater Itnowledge of weak points,\u2014those\nare the remedies for untoward incidents.\nffC\n6 \u00ab\nMaterialisation. p\nAs to the general question of so-called physical phenomena\nand the difficulty of reconciling them with ordinary scientific\nknowledge, it is a notable circumstance that Richet finds\nhimself impelled to admit \"materialisation,\" or ectoplasmic\nformations of an anatomical and physiological kind, as a fact.\nThe evidence must have been very strong to convince him\nof so improbable a phenomenon. I myself have both seen\nand felt ectoplasmic protuberances ; though sometimes they\ncould be felt Avhen they could not be seen, and the vision\nof them Avas always more indistinct than seemed consistent\nwith their palpable activity. I doubt if the visible thing is\nthe enei-getic and forcible portion. The suggestion to my\nmind is that the filmy visible thing is more like a sustainer,\nconnector, or conveyor, of the more active and important\nagency ;\non the analogy of a placenta or an investing mem-\nbrane ;\nand that its function is to maintain organic connexion\nwith the strong substantial mechanism which itself cannot\nbe seen. Invisible agencies able to exert or transmit force,\neven enormous force, are common in physics, e.g. magnetism,'\ngravitation, cohesion, and they all depend on the Ether\u2014\nfor which we have no sense-organ.\nH\nitic\ndth\n'\neitei\nliti\nSei\npa\niOBK\nle\nigak\nijaii\nDeductions. r\nExamining now his conclusions or working hypotheses, we\nshall find that Richet is human enough to be subject to\nibjei\nlit\niiart\n\fISl iXXXIX.] A Text-Book of MetapsycMcs. 95\n01 loods.

My\n;dvice to a student is :\nSee what Richet says ;\nkeep an open mind, and, when\nhere is an opportunity, try experiments or make observations\nor yourself.

And it gives a com-\nehensive summary of the whole subject in what is intended\nbe a simple and straightforward manner. It does not of\n.urse compare with Myers's great and original Treatise on\numan Personality. It does not aim in that direction,\nyers's aim was strongly theoretical ; and the numerous facts\nhich he adduced, and which he gave in Appendices in fairly\n11 details, were purposely selected as illustrative of his theories,\nichet, we will say, has no theories. Or rather, his theories\ne of what may be called the orthodox kind. He adheres\nbiological orthodoxy so far as he can : and in so far as\ns facts do not fit into the scheme,\u2014that is not his fault,\ne really tries to fit them in, and would never wish to ex-\nude a fact on theoretical grounds. Whatever weaknesses\nay be pointed out here and there, he has dbne yeoman\nTvice by his labours, and has furnished the world with\nrobably the most comprehensive survey of the subject that\nIS yet been produced.\nHi\nSEQUEL TO THE REVIEW OF PROFESSOR RICHET'S\n\" TRAITS DE MfiTAPSYCHIQUE.\"\nHaving now reviewed the book, I feel inclined to trespass\nQ the space allowed me and carry on a half-playful argument\ndth my good friend and eminent co-worker as to the points\nn which we differ.

Thereafter its details\ncould be and were worked out, until it became established\nas a commonplace of general elementary knowledge.\nAs the other example, I take the changes popularly supposed\nto be wrought in the foetus, during pregnancy, by some\ninfluence or shock or other experience of the mother, so that\nthe offspring bears signs of the functional disturbance.\nThat this has been regarded as a superstition, and perhaps\nin some quarters still is, hardly needs showing ; but recently\nI learn, from Sir Arthur Keith's admirable lecture, in a supple-\ndoe\nand\nthe\nieqt\nII\n'Oil\nP\n[(\nk\nk\n{\nffe\nI\n\fLxxxix.] Sequel to Review of A Text-Booh of Metapsychics. 105\nnent to Nature of date 18th August, 1923, that Biologists are\n5 1( jeginning to accept the fact ; not because of specific instances,\n4 Dut because they see some chance of understanding how such\nat! reverberation or intercommunication could come about through\ni change in secretions, so that an impression on one individual\nilili\n30uld cause sympathetic response in another.\nDfs What I call attention to is that the numerous instances\n')f its actual occurrence were insufficient to prevent their\njither being denied or else attributed to coincidence ;\n\u2014that\n'oroad-backed sustainer of anything we find it inconvenient\nor unattractive to believe. Sometimes the authoritj^ for the\n\"act was unimpeachable, but that alone was not enough. I\nM nust quote from Keith's lecture :\n\u2014\nIn 1868 Darwin related \" the case of a cow in which one\n* jye was injured when she was in calf. The calf was born\nwith the corresponding eye small and blind. In more recent\np'ears Marey has recorded an identical result in a mare\n;\nme eye was injured when she was pregnant, and the foal\n;v^as born with the corresjjonding eye small and blind.\nSitherto we liave been inclined to regard such cases as mere\nioincidences, but the well Imown experiments of Guyer and\nSmith provide a rational explanation.\"\nThis \" rational explanation \" was provided by the experiment\n\u2014published in 1921\u2014of injecting a substance, having a selective\nind toxic action on the lens of the eye, into the veins of\ndoe rabbits at the end of the second week of pregnancy ;\nand then finding that the young rabbits, when born, showed\nibhe\ndefect to be expected, and that also many of their sub-\nsequent progeny were afflicted with cataract.\n\" These experiments show that the germ plasm can be reached\nfrom without.\"\nProbably a few biologists must have claimed that the facts\nof observation had alreadj^ demonstrated this, apart from special\nexperiment ; but they may have been set aside as cranks.\nAnother example might be found in the superstition which\nseemed to connect the effect of the malaria or \" bad air \" of\nthe Campagna with the prevalence of a noxious insect.\n1 Experiments in metaphysics are much to be desired.

Nevertheless, it may be that\n2iy negative attitude is somewhat more strongly repre-\nsented in my writings than in my intimate thought.\nThere are facts so unexpected, so perturbing, continually\ncropping up as we continue to study the subject, pre-\n^\nrenting themselves with such disconcerting rapidity and\n\u00ab complexity, that it would be inexcusable for me to\n! ieny, without hesitation, all possibility of the survival\n)i consciousness.\nIt therefore appears to me wise to make a reserve in\nny negation. If it is true\u2014as I have often maintained\n\u2014\nhat the most reasonable h3rpothesis is the unknown\nlypothesis X, which it will be for the future to develop,\nt is very possible that this hypothesis X need not be\n\fi 1\n108 Professor Charles Richet. [part\nantagonistic to the spiritistic hypothesis. In fact, I do\nnot wish to expose myself to the chance of seeing my\nnegations suddenly reversed by new experiments ;\nso,\nalthough I do not expect this to happen, my attitude of\nprudence may be pardoned. At the same time, in spit^\nof my prudence, I am forced to regard the spiritistic hypo-\nthesis, not only as undemonstrated, but, still more, as being\nin formal opposition to a great number of facts.\nLet it be well understood that I am not at all con-\ncerned to know whether survival is agreeable or dis-\nagreeable, nor whetlier I am in accord or disaccord with\nany particular brand of religious opinion : it is not\nthings of that kind which occupy my mind, but only a\nquestion of fact\u2014the truth.\nII.\nTo what then is the spiritistic hypothesis in opposition 1\nFirst of all, very briefly, there is Physiology, that is\nto say a very precise science, rich in demonstrations,\nwhich have estabhshed by innumerable proofs a narrow\nrigorous parallehsm between intellectual functions\u2014other-'\nwise called memory\u2014and the brain.\nMoreover, in the immense animal kingdom there is no'\ngap, no hiatus. The monkey and the dog have a memory\nanalogous to that of man : the hen and the tortoise can\nbe compared with the monkey and the dog : then the\nfish and the octopus : then all the other animals, down\nto the worms. Consciousness, mobihty, sensitiveness, are\nfunctions of the nervous system ; so that it is necessary\nto suppose, not only the survival of the human conscious-\nness, but also the survival of all animal memories.\nThat is a grave consideration, and I am not resigned\nto it.\n^\ntoo\nJlllj\nis i]\nBut the spiritists do not admit what my illustrious\nfriend Oliver Lodge humorously calls \"the fetish of the\nbrain.\" For myself, without being able to give a firm\ndemonstration (for one cannot prove a negative), I cannot\nbeheve that memory can exist without the anatomical p\nand physiological integrity of the brain. Whenever there\nm\nim\ndoa\n\fxc] For and Against Survival. 109\nis no more oxygen, whenever the temperature is either\ntoo low or too high, when there are a few drops of\natropine or morphine or chloroform introduced into the\nblood, whenever the course of cerebral irrigation is\nstopped\u2014memory alters and disappears. Sj)iritists cannot\ndeny these facts. They say merely that the brain is\nonly an instrument, which is unable to respond unless it\nis intact. And it is by reasoning of another order that\nthey try to prove that the instrument is not necessary.\nBut that is another grave consideration. It is as if\nI were to say that in an electric lamp the passage of\nthe current and the integrity of the mechanism of the\nlamp are not necessary for the production of its hglit.\nIII.\nBut let us proceed and come to the direct proofs.\nFollowing the classification that I have formulated, they\ncan be related to subjective metapsychics or to objective\nmetapsychics.\nNow in subjective metapsychics we have a great number\nof facts proving that human intelhgence has means of\nacquiring information other than through normal sensory\noharmels ; and that it acquires this information under\nconditions which exclude the attribution of this super-\nlensorial knowledge (or cryptaesthesia) to the presence of an\nindividuahty which has survived the death of the brain.\nWhen Ossowiecki reads the word \" toi \" that I have\nwritten on a scrap of paper held all crumpled up in my\nhand, or when he indicates a verse of Rostand that\nI don't know and that Mme de Noailles had enclosed\nin a carefully sealed letter, there is no need to suppose\nthe intervention of the soul of a deceased person. There\nis perception or knowledge of reality : that is all.\nAnd this perception or knowledge is profoundly\nmysterious. We might say that it has, so to speak, no\nlimit known to us. We are not leaving the scientific\niomain if we say that cryptaesthesia can reveal to us\nfragments of the real\u2014fragments which seem to have no\n3onnexion with space and time.\n\f110 Professor Charles Richet. [pAHl\nSince the facts are so, since cryptaesthesia in these cases\nis apparently not connected with the agency of any\ndiscarnate person, I do not at all see why, in spite\nof appearances\u2014sometimes startUng and disturbing\u2014one\nshould feel authorised to suppose that the individuaUty\nof some dead person has retained his consciousness, his\nmemory, and is there in order to make revelations to\nus. It is a hypothesis wliich is not at all necessary,\ngiven the mysterious and vast extent of cryptaesthesic\npower.\nConsequently, all the revelations of the discarnate about\ntheir old hfe can be logically attributed to this power\nof cryptaesthesia.\nNevertheless, I do not overlook two facts :\n(1) That\ngenuine mediums have an invincible tendency to attribute\ntheir answers to a spirit of the dead : all their phrases\nare saturated with the spiritistic hypothesis ; and it was\nso even in the beginning of their career, when they had\npractically no knowledge of spiritistic Uterature. (2) We\nmust admit\u2014what is not very satisfactory\u2014that mediums\nhave a way of selecting minute details in the hfe and\nhabits of a definite discarnate person in order to utiUse\nor adapt them in their answers. Sir Ohver Lodge and\nE. Bozzano have insisted on the difficulty there is in\nunderstanding this selection in the messages. So much\nso that in certain very rare cases the hypothesis of\nsurvival is much less far-fetched than the hypothesis of\nselective cryjjtaesthesia.\nBut these reasons, which I frankly bring forward in\nall their force, do not hinder me from conclucUng that by\nsubjective metapsychics one cannot render hkely the\ntheory of survival.\nOne must here remark that we have not taken into\naccount the wholesale nonsense furnished by automatic\nwriting in thousands of experiments. Even for the most\nhardened spiritist there is not one communication in a\nthousand which is not ridiculous : it behoves one there-\nfore to be very cautious about the thousandth observation,\neven when it has rather striking features.\nIt\nreal\n\u00abxa\nm\nsiir\nphe\nma\nme\nfor\n\fxc] For and Against Survival. Ill\nIV.\nLet us remain a moment longer in subjective meta-\npsychics and consider the most extraordinary facts in the\nwhole of known science, that is to say Premonitions.\nIt must be understood that I by no means deny the\nreality of certain premonitions ; I have quoted remarkable\n\u2022examples of them which have happened to me personally :\nand in the annals of our science there are astonishing\nexamples. But premonition has nothing to do with\nsurvival. It remains an absolutely incomprehensible\nphenomenon for our puny intelhgence. One cannot see\nhow this phenomenon, which .shocks so brutally our\nsense of free will, can ever be understood.\nThat matters httle. It is an undeniable fact ; and\nit proves to us the sheer impossibility, as yet, of finding\nany explanation for metapsychic phenomena. But I do\nnot propose an explanation or a theory. When I speak\nof cryptaesthesia I indicate a fact\u2014the perception of\nreahty by extra-sensorial channels. I do not seek to\ngo beyond that, and as yet science has no right to go\nbeyond that.\nV.\nWhat strongly confirms this opinion, about our scien-\ntific powerlessness in coming to a conclusion, are the\nexperiences of Objective metapsychics ; for they prove\nto us that we are still plunged in thick darkness. When\nan ectoplasmic formation comes out of the body of\nEusapia, of D. D. Home, of Mss Gohgher, of Eva, or\nof WiUy, we can only properly conclude that from the\nbodies of mediums can be disengaged sometimes forces\nhaving objective reahty, which can be moulded, and\njjjl photographed, and can assume the most diverse appear-\nances. What connexion can there be between these\njg.\nmateriahsations of human forms and the survival of\nmemory 1 I cannot see any.\nMoreover, there are not only materiahsations of human\nforms, but also materiahsations of veils, head-dresses.\n\f112 Professor Charles Richet. [part!\nclothes, animals., various objects ; to such an extent that I\nwe cannot doubt that the power of materiahsation or of siii\nproducing ectoplasm is not limited to human personahties.\nI know well that in certain cases, in particular the case ne'\nof Mr. Cushman [American Journal S.P.R., April, 1922,\npp. 132 to 147), the photograph of the phantom represents\nvery exactly the face of the young deceased daughter\nof Mr. Cushman. But even in this remarkable case, if tni\nthere is not some error or trickery, it is impossible to\nsuppose that the body of this young girl had not been\ndecomposed by the decay of the tomb. We cannot\nreally suppose that the forms of living people perpetuate\nthemselves after death. It must be the materiahsation of\nsomething tvhich has existed and which no longer exists.\nTo admit that is to enter a world absolutely unknown.\nIt is possible that one day it may be admitted ; but\nto-day we stand plunged into an abyss of deeper and\ndeeper mysteries. It would mean, not only the survival Mi\nof memory, but the survival of the chemical elements\nwhich constitute our body, and which retain somehow enl\ntheir molecular arrangement, in spite of incineration and\nputrefaction.\nThus objective metapsychics gives no support whatever\nto the theory of survival. It teaches us only this\u2014that,\nso far, we have understood nothing, absolutely nothing, t|i(\nof all these phenomena.\nID\nVI.\n*\nAnd now to conclude. Unknown truths, immense ph\nunforeseen horizons, open before us. Let us not hasten\nto build up a fragile theory. The further we advance\nthe more the shadows thicken. The old Egyptians had\nah-eady supposed that a human being survived the\ndisintegration of its human tatters. They put into the\nsarcophagus of their dead ones, cakes, toys, and jewels.\nThe anthropomorphism of the spiritist is of the same\norder. Truth, under the profound veils which cover it,\nmust be far more noble than this antiquated idea\n\u2014\nthe\n'prolongation of our miserable individual intellectuality.\n\fxc] For and Against Survival. 113\nI deny nothing. I claim only that the theory of\nsurvival has some extremely feeble evidence in its favour,\nbut against it a series of innumerable inductions. In\nview of the rapid progress of the sciences, and the pro-\nfound change in all our conceptions, it must be held to\nconstitute only a revival of very ancient superstitions.\nThe evolution of science will lead us to more splendid\ntruths.\nFOR AND AGAINST SURVIVAL.\nThe Possibility of Survival from the Scientific\nPoint of View.\nBy Sir Olfver Lodge.\nMy good and eminent friend Professor Richet has made\nan admirable statement or synoptic summary of the\nenhghtened materialistic position in regard to the pheno-\nmena studied in Psychic Research, and recorded in his\ngreat book, Traite de Metapsychique. His statement\nwould not be accepted by the great majority of his\ncolleagues, who being unacquainted with the facts are\ntherefore comparatively benighted ; but the interesting-\nthing is that though Professor Riohet knows facts which\nin some of their aspects conflict with materiahsm, he yet\nis able to remain a materiahst.\nNo offence is intended by this term : it is a definite\nphilosophical position. It is well to have this position\ncompetently sustained, so far as the phenomena specially\nunder consideration are concerned, and so far as it has\na bearing on our acceptance or rejection of the possibihty\nor reasonableness of human survival. If Professor Richet's\nstronghold can be stormed, it is unhkely that any\nsuccessor will be able to entrench himself in a fortress\nof equal soHdity.\nRichet shows himself remarkably open minded, for he\nsays, \" I deny nothing \" ; he also shows himself a\nthorough agnostic, for he says that we are still plunged\n\f114 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nin thick darkness and have no chie to these mysteries.\nBut here is just where I differ from him. I am less\nopen-minded, for I want to deny a good deal. I am\nless agnostic, for I have a working hypothesis, which I\ndesire to verify or else explode.\nNow although Professor Richet is acquainted with the\nfacts, I venture to say that he is not yet acquainted\nwith my version of the spiritistic point of view ;\nwhich\nI might call \" our theory \" except that I have no right\nto involve other people in a disputed and unorthodox\nposition. Why should he be acquainted with it ? If I\nhave indicated my theoretical views at all, it has always\nbeen in a faint and apologetic manner, because I want\nto confront them always with the facts, and because I\nwish to emphasise the facts themselves rather than any\nopinion or theories about them. But with my friend\nProfessor Richet I must take a different hne. There is\nno need to weary him by insistence on the facts,\u2014though\nabout a few of the subjective kind I have a more favour-\nable opinion than he has ;\njust as on the objective side\nhe has had advantages of investigation denied to me,\n\u2014\nwhat is troubling him throughout is the lack of theory.\nHe bravely faces the lacuna. He does not seek to devise\nopposition theories. He is content to say that the facts\nare mysterious and inexplicable and rather crazy, when\ninterpreted as orthodox science feels bound to interpret\nthem.\nAnd with that hmitation\u2014the limitation which orthodox\nscience at present imposes on itself\u2014crazy and incredible\nis what they are. Still more crazy must our theories\nabout them seem. But new facts often require new\ntheory for their interpretation. There are things in the\nuniverse which biological science has not yet taken into\naccount. If or when it does proceed to take another\nentity of physical existence into account, it will find its\ndifficulties gradually disappearing. And Richet himself\nwin feel sooner or later that he can have a clue to his\nfacts, a link on which to thread them, a point of view\nwhich will enable him to interpret them in a more hospi-\ntable and less dumbfounded manner.\n\fxc] For and Against Survival. 115\nFrom his present point of view no wonder they appear\nstrange, troubhng, mysterious and incredible. The marvel\nis that his loyalty to truth and to fact has enabled him\nto accept them at all, as part of the reahty of the\nUniverse. That is just what they are : but then some\nother things are hkewise part of reahtj^. And when we\naccept and incorporate the Ether into our scheme\u2014\na\nthing at present totally ignored by biological science, and\nindeed ignored by all science except one-half of the\nscience of Physics\u2014the horizon will begin to brighten,\nthe mist roll away, and a star, if not a sun, will begin\nto illuminate the darkness.\nI said that I wanted to deny as well as to assert.\nProfessor Richet refrains from denying, but some of his\nassertions are rash. He denies with hesitation : he\nasserts with vigour\u2014a procedure in general quite admir-\nable ; but on this occasion I am going rashly to take an\nopposite course. I am going to deny with vigour and\nassert with hesitation. Only, for the sake of lucidity\nand brevity, I may find it best to throw my assertions\ninto a positive and dogmatic form, which ill suits the\nsubject were it not for this explanation. And I must\ntrust my critics clearly to apprehend that when I turn\nfrom denials to assertions I am only formulating a\nworking hypothesis, only making an effort to frame a\nrational conception of the manner and method of human\nsurvival.\nThe evidence for survival ought to stand on its own\nmerits, without being hampered by effete superstitions.\nI wish to deny and repudiate some of those superstitions\nin a forcible manner ; and in this I know that I am in\nagreement with all the more reasonable spiritists. Professor\nRichet, and perhaps some others in the physiological\ncamp, seem to want to carry these superstitions over\nfrom \" the dark ages \" into the era of Science ; but\nthis must not be allowed. The subject is difficult enough\nwithout these unnecessary and impossible accretions.\nMy first denial then is of anything Uke the resuscitation\n\f116 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PABT\nof a corpse. Humanity for many centuries has been\naccustomed to think of people being put into a grave,\nthere to bide their time for some future event : and those\nwho hold or try to hold that view would be indisposed\nto accept any appearances of the departed unless they\ncould find their empty tomb. Now we maintain that\nthe idea of a resuscitated body wandering about is absurd ;\nalthough the history of folk-lore shows that beUefs of\nthis kind were held : and a stake was sometimes driven\nthrough the body of a suicide in order to keep it quiet.\nThe reason for this preposterous practice was no doubt\nsimilar to that which Professor Richet now expresses,\nviz. that the personahty is so entirely associated with\nthe material body that any visible and tangible appearance\nof that personality must necessarily be taken to mean\nthat the corpse was used for the purpose. And during\nthe Middle Ages some even of the Fathers of the Church\napparently could not dissociate the idea of ultimate\nresurrection from the notion of an abandoned grave, a\ncollection of the body's original particles, a composing\nof them together, and a revivification. But the facts\ngive no justification for such an idea. And those who\nhold the spiritistic view are as wllhng as any Physiologist\nis to admit all the facts about disintegration, decomposi-\ntion, incineration, and the rest. The materialistic survivals\nof folk-lore must be utterly discarded.\nIf it be found that an apparition or phantom has the\nfeatures and bodily marks of the discarded instrument of\nmanifestation, then those facts will have to be accepted,\nand an explanation sought elsewhere. No explanation\nbased on the revivification of the corpse can be accepted\nfor a moment. It is true that it seems like the obvious\nand childish explanation : but in the fight of modern\nknowledge it ought to be discarded as extinct. When\nwe say that the facts uphold the doctrine of survival, we do\nnot mean that I\nThe ancient Egyptian practices, and their idea of death\nmust have been troublesome and painful. The notion\nthat the surviving soul or Ka required meats and furniture\nand appfiances, which were therefore put into the tomb\n\fxc] For and Against Survival. 117\nior its sustenance and convenience, belongs to the childish\nAge of humanity, and must have given great anxiety to\nsurvivors, especiallj\" poor survivors, lest they had for-\ngotten something necessary, or lest they had not made\nadequate provision for their beloved's future existence.\nMechfeval ecclesiastical behefs were in many respects\nbetter than that. It must have been painful to put the\nloved person into the earth and leave him in the cold and\ndark for unkno-mi centuries ; but at anj^ rate they had\nfaith that the bodily part would be at peace until sum-\nmoned again and reconstituted by Divine Power. They\nhad anxieties and troubles enough however about the\nsoul, which they were told might be in torment unless\nthey mvoked the supernataral power of the priesthood.\nThis fear must have given so much pain that really those\nbehefs were hardly superior to the more ancient behefs of\nthe Egj^tians. It is known, however, that the phi'ase\n\u2022'\u2022'resurrection of the body\"\" is capable of adaptation and\nTeasonable interpretation by behevers ; as explained e.g. in\n2Ian and the Universe, and in Part III of Rayniond.\nBut with Ecclesiastical practices, science has nothing\nto do. It ought to regard the facts from a totally new\nand different aspect. We ought to maintain, and we do\nmaintain, that the material body has served its turn and\nis utterly discarded and done with, that its particles can\nbe used again for other forms of hfe, and that no sort\n\u2022of identity or personahty remains associated with them.\nAs to what becomes of the personahty, and what\ninstrument now serves its turn, that is a matter for\ninvestigation ; that is what we have to learn. Xo question\nof priestcraft should be associated -ndth it : it is a\nstraightforward scientific enquiry. It may be that we\ndo not know. But on the other hand it may be that\nwe can frame a working h\\-pothesis. Such a hypothesis\nis growing in my mind : and the beginnings of it were\nin the mind of St. Paul, of Clement of Alexandria, of\nOrigen, and other Greek Fathers of the Church. Very\nhkely their ideas were condemned as heretical at the time ;\nbut that does not prove them imtrue.\nTo avoid mistmderstanding, I should hke to say here\n\f118 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nthat in all I have said I am referring to ordinary bodies\nand ordinary people. If there is a case for an exceptional\nBody, and for a different treatment in one particular\ninstance, so that one Tomb was really empty, that is not\na matter to which I wish to refer here. I may have\nmore to say about that in a proper time and place.\nMeanwhile I am deahng with the apparitions and the\nfate of ordinary people. The facts suggest, what is\nrather the point at issue, that they do sometimes appear :\nbut the fact is certain that their material bodies remain\nin the tomb, or wherever else they were deposited by\nsurvivors. If this is fully admitted and thoroughly\naccepted, a crude materialistic explanation of the facts\nis put out of court, and the ground is to that extent\ncleared. The enquiry may now proceed freed from this\nencumbrance of folk-lore. There is no survival of the\nmaterial body\n!\nNevertheless, those of us who consider that we are\nreally in touch, sometimes, with surviving personaKties,\nare told by those personalities that they have \" bodies\n\"\njust as real and substantial as they used to have, that\nthey find themselves signally unchanged, that they pre-\nserve the same appearance, so that they can be recognised;\nthat it is by means of these bodies or instruments of\nmanifestation that they are aware of and communicate\nwith each other, and that by aid of them they occasion-\nally communicate with us. How can these statements\nbe reconciled with what has just been said ? Well, that\nis where comes in my working hypothesis\u2014a hypothesis\nnot accepted by me alone ])ut by many others who are\nfeeling their way in the same direction, a hypothesis\nwhich we can read into many of St. Paul's words, and\nwhich we therefore think that that inspired genius caught\nsome ghmpse of, though he could not have formulated it\nin modern terms.\nIf I am tempted to call it \" my hypothesis,\" it is\nbecause\u2014apart altogether from psychical conditions\u2014I have\nmade a life-long study of the Ether of Space ; so that to\nme it seems a more famihar and substantial and practical\nentity than it is likely to be to people who have not\n\f!r xc] For and Against Survival. 119\ns made that study, and to whom it seems something indefinite,\nal vague, and imaginary.\nir Among scientific men the Ether has only been studied\n)t by Physicists, and not by all of them. It has been\ne ignored by Chemists, qua Chemists, and has probably\nI\nnever entered the thoughts of Physiologists, or Biologists\nle\nI\nof any kind, at all. And yet if it is a reaMty in the\nis 'Universe it may have chemical and biological functions\n: to perform, as well as its well known functions in the\n1 [science of Physics. We know it familiarly in the pheno-\nHmena of Light, of Electricity, of Magnetism. We are\nr beginning to associate it also, rather definitely, with\ns Elasticity, Cohesion, and Gravitation. And we are\nt gradually learning that the greater part of the energy\nf in the Universe, and certainly all potential energy, belongs\ne to it, and not to matter at all. Atomic matter is one\nthing : the Ether is another. They may be related ; in\ne fact they are related. The hnk between them is electricity,\ni. But if it is possible ever to unify them, and to regard\nthem as different manifestations of one thing, there is\nt no doubt which is the more fundamental of the two.\nThe Ether is the fundamental thing. Matter is a derived\n: and secondary thing. And the electric charges which\nf constitute matter are probably composed of modifications\nt of the Ether.\nThis really is orthodox Physics, though it is not yet so\n> substantiated that all Physicists must necessarily agree with\n[ it. There may be legitimate differences of opinion, but it is\n< a recognised and reasoned scientific view. It is well founded,\nr it is deduced from the facts, and is entirely independent of\n> any psychic considerations.\n[. Suppose then, for purposes of argaiment, that we allow\n: the Ether in the physical universe to have the functions\n: which most physicists attribute to it : then it becomes a\ndefinite question whether it ought not to be taken into\n- account in philosophic discussion, and in the long run in\n'\nbiological theory too.\nI To explain all that I have said on the side of physics\n1 would need something like a treatise. In this discussion I\n[ must be brief, and must appear to be more hypothetical than\n\f120 Sir Oliver Lodge. [pabt\nI am. Still when we come to Biology we are bound to be\nhypothetical. And the working hypothesis that I promul\ngate must be held hghtly, until the facts, studied long and\ncarefully, are found to substantiate it, and constitute it\na reasonable clue to phenomena which, though real, seem\notherwise inexphcable.\nTo Professor Richet the facts seem quite inexplicable.\nHe feels that he is working in the dark, and that \" the\nonly safe statement is to say that we really know nothing,\nabsolutely nothing, about the Universe.\"' From this\npoint of view, my agnosticism is not so deep as his. I\nfeel that we have a clue, and that it is only by following\nit up that we shall find out whether it is a trustworthy\nclue or not. Any clue is better than none. Discon-\nnected facts, not joined by any thread of theory, are\nintractable and confusing things. They can hardly be\nsaid to belong to Science, which means a system of\norganised knowledge. And it is because they lack the\nclue, that Biologists in general feel so hostile, and are\nconscious of such repugnance, to the facts themselves.\nTo the honour of Professor Richet, in spite of his repug-\nnance, he is ready to accept the facts. But it seems to\nme that he raises unnecessary difficulties about them by\nhis insistence on matter alone. He will never under-\nstand them in terms of \" matter \" alone. Strictly\nspeaking, we cannot understand anything fully and com-\npletely in terms of matter alone. By concentrating on\nmatter we eliminate from our thoughts the greater part\nof the Universe. The Universe contains many things\nbesides matter. It contains magnetism and electricity\nand light and ether ; it also contains life and thought\nand mind and consciousness and memory and personahty\nand character. None of these things are material ; and\nyet, strangely enough, some of them have come into\nassociation with matter through the curious biological\nprocess of Incarnation. For a time intelligences do\ninhabit material bodies which, by barely known processes,\nthey have unconsciously constructed. It is evident that\nthere exists a formative principle, which is able to deal\nAvith the atoms of matter, or rather with the more com-\ni\nh\nlatti\ni(\nBtr\nfe\nlOti\nik\nic\nB\nte\ni\nIS\nlat\nn\n\fiiil\neol\ncc] For and Against S^vriival. 121\n)lex molecules into which the atoms have already grouped\nthemselves : and thus, by aid of the energy which these\nnolecules receive from the sun, non-material entities are\niible to manifest themselves famiharly in association with\nnatter. So vivid is the connexion that we have learnt\n.0 identify them with their material modes of manifes-\nation, and to imagine that they cannot otherwise exist.\nWe do not know why they require a habitation or\nnstrument belonging to the physical universe ; but we\nnay assume that for some unknowoa reason they do.\niVe know that they make use of matter, though we know\nlot how or why. But the facts now show that associa-\nion with matter is not essential to their existence. We\nnay assume that they can make use of something else,\nf the facts point that way. My working hypothesis is\nhat they are more closely associated with the Ether than\nvith matter, that they act primarily and directly on the\nSther, and only indirectly on matter, and that they are\nble to continue in their Ether habitations when the\nnaterial particles are worn out and discarded. In justifi-\niation for this I wish to say, as a physicist, that most,\n)ossibly all, of our actions on matter are exerted through\nhe Ether : some obviously, like propulsion by electric\nnotors, others less conspicuously, but just as really,\nvherever force crosses empty space. For atoms are never\nn contact.\nBut we have no sense organs for the Ether. To our\niresent animal senses it is entirely elusive. Hence we\nhall know nothing about any personalities associated only\nsdth an Ether body unless they can operate on our senses\nn some way. To do this they must operate on matter,\n^et us suppose then that they can extract organised\nnaterial and mould it, as a sculptor moulds his clay or\nLS a painter treats his pigments, until they have fashioned\ni material representation which we may be able to see\ni-nd touch, and which, if imbued with energy, may per-\norm physical actions, such as the motion of objects.\nThis is not an unfounded guess ; for we know that\nhe famihar material body has been built up in its present\nlefinite shape out of food not in the least hke it ; that\n\f122 Sir Oliver Lodge. [par\nthe shape of the material body depends on the formativi\norganising principle, not on the aliment provided. Tha\nis the peculiarity of live things. They are able to display\nthemselves, to exhibit their own shape, by means of an^\nkind of wholesome material. In this they are unlik(\ncrystals, of which the shape is entirely dependent on th(\nnutriment supplied.\nWe have, therefore, only to suppose that this formativf\nprinciple or constructive power persists. And we neec\nnot have any great difficulty in supposing, if the fact:\nwarrant and suggest the idea, that this same formative\nprinciple can continue to act occasionally even on matter\nwhen suitable organised protoplasmic material is provided\nand that the material can be moulded into the same hke-\nness as of old, although imperfectly and very temporarily.\nIn this general way, therefore, I would seek to account\nfor objective metapsychical phenomena. That deceased\nhuman beings are often thus engaged need not be assumed.\nThe formative unconscious power or principle may be.\nmiich more general than that, but it must also be\nspecific. In an egg the formative principle exists which\nconstructs a bird ; from the ovvim of a dog, a dog\nemerges : the formative principle in an acorn constructs\nan oak. The construction is in every familiar case\nspecific. So if human hands and faces are produced,|\nor even if things like garments and veils are imitated,\nit is not unreasonable to suppose that some human, ^\"\nelement\u2014in the latter case perhaps a conscious element\n\u2014\nis somehow concerned in the production.\nSubjective metapsychics is still easier to associate with\nhuman survival. The controlling immaterial entity, the\nhving personality, was known, while here, to be able to\noperate on the cells of its brain, so as not only to move\nmuscles but thereby to convey ideas intelUgible to other\nsimilar personalities who were acquainted with the con-\nventional signs or language. And it is a question of\nevidence whether this power of operating on brains can\nbe extended to other brains, so that a personaUty which\nhas lost the use of its own instrument may be able,\nwith difficulty and by permission, to work similarly on\nd\nIs;\nflot\n'le\nloi\nledi\nm\nmi\n\u00abh\nlow\nsac\nM\n!triv\nli li\nfe\nI\n1st\nlain\nisli(\nk\n\fin\nl:c.] For and Against Survival. 123\nhe brain of some hospitable person who partially vacates\nlis instrument in trance, or who allows part of it to be\nised for moving either his hand in writing or his organs\n)f speech. If so, the ideas thus conveyed may mainly\n)elong and be largely appropriate, not to the host or\n'\nmedium,\" but to the actuating personahty or \" control.\"\nChough admittedly the habit and cultivation of the\nuedium's brain may to some extent hamper free and\n'msophisticated and fully intelhgent control, and may\ntecessitate a judicious selection of topics or of language,\nuch as the instrument may be able to transmit Mdthout\nindue and telergic effort.\nIt is unnecessary to elaborate this further, because\nhese are the facts which more strongly than any others\nlemonstrate survival. Whether the evidence, as yet,\n:onstitutes proof is a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss ;\n,nd there may be differences of opinion. But no artificial\nObjections need be raised by the difficulty of realising\nlow it can possibly be done. The appearances are\nixactly as if the simple explanation were the true one.\n^nd there have been several cases in science where, after\ntriving for a more complicated theory, we have found\nifter all that Reality and Appearance were not so different\nbS had been surmised. For instance, after much hesitation\nve had to decide that the red appearances round the sun\nit the time of an' eclipse, which looked hke flames,\neally were flames and not anything less familiar. Again,\nv^hen in old days the Danish astronomer, Roemer, sought\no explain certain curious anomalies in the motion of\nTupiter's Satelhtes, by the supposition that light had a\ninite velocity and took a measurable time to bring the\nnformation\u2014the suggestion was in most quarters scouted\niS too simple and ad Jioc an explanation ; and under the\nlame \" the equation of light,\" it was rejected and unused\nor the best part of a century ; until an independent\n.nd quite different observation by the Enghsh astronomer\nSradley required a similar explanation, and thereby estab-\nished it beyond dispute. The messenger had lagged on\nhe journey\u2014that was all.\nLet it not be supposed, however, that the discovery of\n\f124 Sir Oliver Lodge. [par\"\nthe finite rate of propagation of light is a small dis'\nCOvery ;\nit has turned out to have the most portentous\nconsequences ;\nfor, as we learn from Einstein, the velocitj\nof light is perhaps the only absolute and unchangeablt\nthing in the physical universe.\nSo I expect it will be with the spiritistic hypothesis\nin some developed form. Childishly simple as it appears\nseemingly more appropriate to primitive man than tc\nFellows of the Royal Society, it may turn out not onlj\nto be true but to involve consequences of tremendous\nmoment to mankind ; indeed it may outweigh all othei\ndiscoveries in its influence on human will and conduct !\nI have been led on in a more positive direction than\nI had intended, and have broken off my catalogue oi\ndenials, such as I thought Professor Richet's article\ncalled for. Denial is no pleasure to me : and I have\nnothing so fundamental to deny as the resuscitation\nand utihsation of corpses\u2014a procedure which, if it were\npossible, might legitimately be stigmatised as necromancy.\nBut there are a few sentences in Professor Richet's article\nto which I wish to oppose a negative. They are as\nfollows :\n\u2014\nFirst, the imphcation (by the use of the word \" cannot \")\nthat any reasonable holder of the spiritistic view would\nliU to deny physiological and pathological facts if he were\nable. It is not a question of \" camiot,\" it is a question\nof \u2022 do not \" : we accept them fully. If the instrument\nis out of order or interfered with or drugged, no sign of\nintelhgence can be made. Injure a person's brain, and\nhis mind is cut off from our ken. It is isolated, not\nannihilated. Mind and Brain belong to different cate-\ngories. A brickbat is a curious weapon against a mind,\nbut it is effective against a brain. IMind belongs to\npsychology, not to physiology.\nSecond, that any sen.sible people hold that an instru-\nment is not necessary for communication and response.\nOn the contrary, they hold that it is necessary, quite\nnecessary, and that that is the use of a medium. If an\niieti\nCOI\nsilt\nSllJ\nIt\ninf\nk\n\fxc] For and Against Survival. 125\nelectric lamp is spoiled, the usual plan is to replace it by\nanother. That other may be an inferior one, but the\ncurrent must pass or you will get no light. Integrity of\nsome instrument is essential to rational communication.\nThirdly, that 999 communications out of a thousand\nare ridiculous. If we eliminate obvious nonsense and\nlunacy, the statement is not true. If it were true it\nwould indeed be a damning fact. Being a question of\nfact, it is important : and I maintain that communica-\ntions obtained through reputable and tested and genuine\nmediums are nearly all of them sensible, are often of\nsurprising interest, and are sometimes of value. In this\nmatter I claim to have had more experience than my\nfriend. The volumes of the S.P.R. Journal and Pro-\nceedings contain plenty of instances, and many more are\n,| known to me and to my readers. Indeed, in this\ncountry and in America the multitude of rational, and\nsometimes ingeniously devised and extremely evidential,\ncommunications is overwhelming.\nBut it will be objected, the facts whole will not\nbe content with that simple idea\u2014the idea of the vicarious\nuse of other people's brain-nerve -muscle mechanism for\nthe transmission of messages from a surviving etherially-\nembodied once-incarnate personality\u2014even if that idea can\nbe rationahzed. The notion of human survival beyond\nbodily death is well able to account for simple personal\ncommunications to surviving relatives, messages of affection\nand advice, and things of that sort. Those are what have\nsuggested the idea. It is obvious that that is their\nsuperficial appearance. The notion may also serve most\nnaturally to account for the incidents of classical scholar-\nship, and hterary allusion, beyond the scope of the\nmedium's learning or cultivation. But Subjective Meta-\npsychics contains many other phenomena besides these.\nIt contains travelling clairvoyance, for instance, when\ninformation is given about what is happening at a\ndistance, or when apparently telepathic effects are produced\nacross a continent ;\nor, more puzzhng still, when sealed\ndocuments and unopened books are read ; and. most\npuzzling of all, when future events are predicted. Do\n\fBsta\nippl;\n126 Sir Oliver Lodge. [par':'\nI seriously claim to have the beginnings of a working [^J*\nhypothesis sufficient to account for these things ? i\nWell, I do ! Let me try to expound it tentatively ir\na few words. i\nThe dissociation of personahty from the restrictions ol\nthe material body need not only occur at death. Some\npeople may have rather loose connexion during life\nTheir animated etherial vehicle, or some part of it, may\nindistinctly be conceived as able to wander during sleep,\nor to leave the main part of the body during trance.\nUsually only the spirit is supposed to leave at such\ntimes\u2014by those who hold that there is such a thing as\nspirit\u2014and possibly that may ])e sufficient for the purposes\nof travelhng clairvoyance and for cryptaesthesic sensibihty ;i\nbut if it turns out that a spirit must have a habitation\nof some kind, I shall not be deterred from pressing an\netherial body into the service. The facts may not\nnecessitate it, or they may. We shall see.\nBut how are we to account for the reading of sealed\nenvelopes, the penetration of opaque obstacles ? Well,\nopacity is a thing that can be treated physically. Iti^pe\nmeans that waves of hght cannot get through : they are\neither reflected back, or they are absorbed and turned\ninto heat, by an opaque body. A conducting metal\nrepresents one type, a \"black body\" the other type of toy\nopacity ; and there are all grades of obstruction to ether\nwaves. But opacity does not mean that nothing can\nget through. I am not prepared with a physical explana-\ntion of how these clairvoyant things can be done. The\nphenomenon is to me the most puzzling of all. I doubt\nif it can be solved in terms of \" matter.\" No adeciuate port\nattempt has yet been made to solve it in terms of\n\u2022'\nEther.\" X-rays give us a hint : but I am not sure\nthat it is done in a physical way at all. There is some\nevidence\u2014not much\u2014that the contents of the book have\nto be, or have had to be, in some person's mind : and\nwhether that which has once caused a mental impression\ncan for that reason be more easily read, or whether the\ninformation is somehow mentally conveyed by other than luid\na physical process, I do not know.

He gives examples not only of diagnosis,\n\u2014\n)ften by means of what is frequently called psychometry,\n:rom a piece of cloth or other object belonging to the\nDatient,\u2014he also gives examples of prognosis, sometimes\nT^erified ; and a few instances of what might here be\nstigmatised as \" fortune-telHng.\" The collection of cases\nn that book seem to me well, worthy of the attention\n)f Biologists ; and inasmuch as he, like Professor Richet,\nittributes them to a paranormal extension of purely\nluman faculty, without any of what might be called\njupernormal assistance, there may be less than usual in\nlis book to repel them by unacceptable and quasi- childish\nlypotheses. At any rate Dr. Osty narrates the facts\n[rankly, and quotes testimony from some of the clah'-\n\/oyants themselves as to the way the impressions seem\n;o come to them. The result seems to be a body of\njvidence which cannot reasonably be overlooked by men\n)f science. Moreover this alone shows, if it were necessary,\njhat Professor Richet is not alone in his cautious attitude\no theory, and rejection of spiritistic views, but is sup-\nported by confreres of similarly great experience.\nPrevision does not give me the profound difficulty that\nit present it gives Professor Richet. If we have to\nnodify our notion of Time, and regard it as more sub-\niective than hitherto\u2014well, we can face even that ; but\nit present I do not see the necessity. If any one survives\n;here must be many, and some have survived for a long\ntsiiime.

One\nclass of prediction is based on planning, which we may\nor may not carry out, and is contingent upon \" strikes.\"\nThe other is based upon calculation from present know-\nledge, and is contingent on their being no cometary or\nother disturbance to affect the equanimity of the moon.\nPredictions are always contmgent, never iixfallible. Yet\none may feel reasonably certain that frost will occur next\nwinter, and I hope equally certani that France and\nEngland will continue good friends.\nTo take a small instance. Why am I sure that our\ndifferences of opinion about details of the Universe will\nnot upset the amicable relations between Richet and\nmyself ? The answer is. Because we both have characters\nof fair stability on which reliance can be placed.\nVery well then, a higher being\u2014I do not mean Deity,\nfor that may go without saying, but people who have\nadvanced in knowledge, grown in intelligence,\u2014may be\nable to infer and plan and predict events, of to us\nsurjDrising improbability, far ahead. They see further than\nwe do. They have greater power of ratiocination, they\nare better judges of character, and can tell with fair\nassurance how even people will behave, as well as, more\neasily, what mechanical things will do.\nBut are we in touch with these exalted intelligences ?\nIs it hkely that they take the trouble to come and talk\nhe\nSc\npk\ndis(\n\fm ;c.] For and Against Survival. 129\nlomesticities through a medium here ?

Progress,\nndeed, has been made, but it has been a quiet and a\n;radual progress. There has been no unexpected develop-\nnent such as from time to time cheers investigators in\nither fields : no startUng discovery to attract wide atten-\nion and win instant recognition.\nIn ordinary circumstances I should not complain of\nhat ; nor should I now, were it not that my office obliges\nae to choose some subject on which to address you.\nt must often happen that Presidents of other Societies\nievoted to studies that yield quicker and more positive\nesults are spared the trouble of casting about for a\nubject for their Addresses, and have one almost thrust\npon them by some new discovery, or tangible advance\necently made in their own particular science.

Almost universe\nindifference has given place to a widely-diffused, if mile\ninterest ; the sniffings and snortings of the robust scepti\nwho would dismiss the whole subject a iwiori as rubbis\nor superstition are at least less frequent and usuaU;\nmore restrained ; and more than one orthodox psychologis\nnot merely treats us with respect but has given us hi\nblessing. It is not simply a case of hostility and ridicul\ngiving place to toleration\u2014to a toleration born parti\nof easy-going good-nature and partly of boredom ; it\nsomething more than that.

Physical science, indeed, is marching\nrora strength to strengtli ; she betrays no symptom of\necline, but rather every evidence of increasing power\n0 grapple with the problems of the material world ;\n,nd if her triumphant progress during the past 40 years\naei|\u00bbe contrasted with our relatively exiguous record of\nuccess, some may feel a sense of discouragement. Yet\ndo not think discouragement would be justified, and\nlaijhat for two reasons. In the first place, ours is a young\ncience\u2014if the name of \" science \" may be given to an\ny inquiry conducted with an unflinching regard for accuracy\nand if in its youth it progresses but slowly, it is only\nml allowing the example of physical science. In the second\nlace, we are faced at every point\u2014and, I imagine,\nIways will be\u2014with difliculties which only rarely, or\n1 a very mild form, beset workers in the realm of\nhysical science. All, or nearly aU, the phenomena we\nivestigate\u2014and here I have in mind chiefly the purely\nsychical phenomena, though much of what I am about\nD say would hold good of the alleged \" physical pheno-\nrlia\nlena \" too\u2014nearly all these phenomena are in themselves\nf a perfectly ordinary and commonplace nature. Some-\nody dreams something, or somebody says something,\nr somebody writes something. We all do those things,\nlost of us every day, unless we happen to be dumb or\nliterate. I may be told, perhaps, that many of the spoken\nr written things we investigate are spoken or written by\nperson in trance, and that trance is not ordinary or\njrfJjommonplace. That is true ; but our primary object is\nisiji\n3 discover evidence of supernormal action\u2014by which I\npiii\nlean something that goes beyond the limits of mere sub-\nanscious action, however strange\u2014 ; and in our search for\nitlj\nddence of supernormal action, as thus defined, the condi-\non of the speaker or writer is of no importance. If every-\nling that Mrs. Piper, or Mrs. Thompson, or Mi's. Leonard\nave said or written when entranced, had been said or\nixitten while they were wide awake and in a perfectly\nprmal condition, its value as evidence of supernormal\n3tivity would not be afliected one way or the other,\nere ls nothing, then in the phenomena which in itseK\nill\n\flbs\nC\u00a3\nll C'\nU\nm\n136 J. G. Piddington [pari\ncompels conviction of its supernormal character ; and it\nis just this ordinariness of the phenomena that gives\nfraud, whether conscious or subliminal, its chance. In\nphysical science fraud of either kind is practically a\nnegligible possibility, and even if fraud were practised\nit could be readily detected. In our case, it would, I\nthink, be true to say that we can never put our fingei\non a single phenomenon and unhesitatingly and con-\nfidently pronounce it to be supernormal ; we can never\nsay \" this is a certain instance of telepathy,\" or \"of\nclairvoyance \" ; we can never say \" fraud, or chance,:\nor misdescription will not suffice to explain this particular\noccurrence.\" Even if the laws governing telepathic oi\nclairvoyant action were to be discovered, we should\nnot, so far as I can see, be any better able to attain\nto certainty in any given instance, so long as super-'\nnormal phenomena remain so easily simulable as they itof\nare at present. At best we can attain only to a reason-\nable degree of certainty : not to that degree of cer-\ntainty which is so often within the reach of physicallrt\nscience.\nThere appeared in the Journal for December last aniKj\naccount of a case of smgular interest, especially from ffti\nthe point of view of theory. In bare outhne the reported\nfacts were these : A Dutch boy of 15 has been watchingi\nfrom his window some people entering a house opposite,iffld\nfor the purpose of having a seance, and has been feeling ;liop(\nvexed at not being able to take part in the seance |ip\nhimself. He then gets hold of an old school-book con-| Tl\ntaining an Enghsh poem, and sits down and reads theijtbs\npoem in a dreamy state, without, however, apparently 'iptei\nany other design than that of whihng the time away.iom\nWhilst the boy is dozing over the poem, two out of j-tl\nthe five stanzas of which it consists\u2014the only ones thejjkt\nboy knew by heart\u2014are reproduced at the seance, thejttiai\ni-eproduction being preceded by the manifestation of a\ncontrol \" who gives no name, announces in Enghsh\nthat he is going to write a song, answers in English\nquestions put in Dutch, and states that he is an English-\nman. Siiaeci\n\fm CI.] Presidential Address 137\n1 i If all the facts reported are true, they are obviously\n:iv6 uportant from the theoretic point of view. But\n1 \/hat kind of certainty can one feel as to the alleged\ni' i upernormal elements in this case 1 What odds would\nsel ou lay on their being genuine ? Would you lay\n[ 1 000 to 1 in \u00a3's sterling that there wasn't trickery,\n19? r collusion, or misdescription, or some other normal\na iause at work ? I can't answer for others, but my\n;vij ,nswer would be an emphatic \" No \" : though^ I\n\"i aight be prepared to lay 3 to 1 against a normal ex-\nDfE Sanation being the true one. But how flimsy a kind\nnlai I'f certainty this represents as compared with the kind\n9 if certainty that physical science may afford. Imagine\nhat the Astronomer Royal v\/ere invited, or dared, to\ntai vager \u00a35000 to \u00a31 that the next eclipse of the moon\npel Fould occur at the time predicted by Greenwich, or\nliei whoever it is that works out these things. Well, he\nm aight suffer from a Nonconformist conscience, or he\ncci night hold that there's no fun in betting on a certainty ;\nis )ut at any rate it would not be fear of losing his money\nhat would deter him from laying the odds. These two\nJ maginary wagers will serve to illustrate the kind of\n01\ntertainty that physical science frequently\u2014though by no\nI neans invariably\u2014attains, and the uncertainty that dogs\nJl our efforts ; and so long as that uncertainty exists\u2014\n\u2022\nmd it may well be that it will always exist\u2014we cannot\nlope to approach, let alone to rival, the rate of progress\n)f physical science.\nThis perpetual want of cut-and-dried-ness, this un-\nlubstantialit}\/ and instability that characterise all our\nphenomena, may well be one of the causes that render\n)ur investigations distasteful to so many men of science\n\u2014though fortunately not to all. And not only that,\nDut the comparative immunity from such uncertainty\nihat men of science enjoy may disqualify them from\nDeing, as they might on first thoughts be supposed to\niijioe, the best judges of our work. Frederic Myers, it\nMs true, often expressed himself as tliough the filial court\n\u00bbDf appeal before which our case would be heard would\naecessarily be composed of men of science ; and our\n\f138 J. 0. Piddington [PAM\nfirst President in his first Presidential Address spoke as\nfollows :\n\" If anyone asks me what I mean by, or how I define,\nsufficient scientific proof of thought-reading, clairvoyance,\nor the phenomena called spiritualistic, I should ask to be\nallowed to evade the difficulties of determining in the\nabstract what constitutes adequate evidence. What I\nmean by sufficient evidence is evidence that will convince\nthe scientific world.\"\nI might have hesitated to express dissent from the\nopinions of two such authorities, had I not chanced to\nre-read Professor Henri Bergson's Presidential Address\nto this Society, and gathered from it, though he does\nnot say so in so many words, that he takes the view\nwhich I am here putting forward. Training in physical\nscience and the pursuit of it, as it seems to me, do\nnot necessarily make a man a better critic of the evidence\ncollected by this Society than do some other forms of\neducation and employment. A man of science might\nbe as good a critic as others, or even a better one ;\nbut in that event he would be so, not qmi man of science,\nbut because he happened to possess qualifications which\nhis own avocation is not specially calculated to develop.\nMen of science are not, so far as I know, specially expert\nin assessing the value of human testimony ; nor are\nthey specially expert\u2014perhaps rather the contrary\u2014in\nliterary matters, and it so happens that quite a con-\nsiderable portion of our evidence can hardly be appreciated\nat its true value without some scholarly and literary\nmsight. And though men of science deal with men's\nbodies, alive or dead, they have little experience in\ndealing with the manifestations, and particularly with\nthe abnormal manifestations, of men's minds.\n\"\nUnlike\nourselves, moreover, it is but very rarely indeed that men\nof science have to beware of fraud, conscious or sub-\nliminal ;\nand if they have to make allowance for the\npersonal equation of experimenters or observers, that\nallowance, owing to various causes, presents little difficulty;\nwhereas against that possible and frequent source of\n\fXCI.] Presidential Address 139\nerror we with difficulty have to guard ourselves in every\ndepartment of our enquiries ; and in addition we have\nalways to be making allowance for the personal equation\nof the dreamer, of the percipient, of the automatist,\nand of the corroborating witnesses.\nI do not, then, believe that official science is our\nproper court of appeal ; and I do not know of any\nformal body which could assume that function with\nauthority. Neither medicine, nor law, nor history, nor\nliterature, though each might contribute some of the\nnecessary qualifications, could fill the bill ; and not even\na committee of intelligent schoolboys, though it might\npossess some useful qualifications in which physicians,\nlawyers, historians, men of letters, and even men of\nscience might be deficient. It is, I beheve, only among\nwhat for want of an exacter definition I have called\n\" educated people \" that a competent tribunal will be\nultimately found. It is they who will pass final judge-\nment ; and it is therefore their interest that we should\nspecially try to win ; and we should not be downhearted\nif men of science as a body look askance at our work ;\nand if so far only five Fellows and two Presidents of\nthe Royal Society have presided over our Society.\nI pass on now to make some observations on the\norganisation through which our researches have been\ncarried on. A large part\u2014I think I may say, a very\nlai'ge part\u2014of the Society's research has been done by\na small number of its members, of whom most are friends\nor acquaintances of each other. This small number of\nindividuals might have co-operated as a private group\nwithout a Society behind them, but to have done so\nwould have involved at least two drawbacks. They\nwould have found it much harder to form a considerable\ncircle of readers, and to maintain it if formed ; and they\nwould consequently have made less headway in attracting\nthe attention of that very class of educated people which,\nif my view is sound, will some day pass judgement on the\ninvestigation. Secondly, without a Society behind them,\nit is unlikely that any small group of workers would\nhave been able by their own unaided activities to come\n\f140 J. G. Piddington [part\noften enough into contact with what I venture to call\nthe raw material, or corpora vilia, necessary for the\nprosecution of their researches. The existence of a\nSociety made it possible to carry out the Census of\nHallucinations\u2014a work of great importance\u2014on a scale\nlarge enough to provide a dependable basis for calcula-\ntion ; and it is among the members of our Society\nthat some of the best automatists and telepathic per-\ncipients have been found : Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Salter,\nMrs. Stuart Wilson, Mrs. Home, Mrs. \" Forbes,\" Mrs.\nLyttelton, Miss Ramsden and others ; and if I do not\nadd the name of Professor Gilbert Murray, it is for\nfear of his protesting that lie is but a mere hyper-\naesthetic, innocent of all telepathic faculty.\nIn thus being largely self-supporting, and dependent\nfor its raw material only to a limited extent on imports\nfrom abroad, our Society, perhaps, differs from all other\nscientific bodies ; for even if some of the medical and\npsychological societies draw on their members for subjects\nof experiment and observation, I am sure they do not\ndo so to anythmg like the same extent. To those of\nour members who have lent themselves so unselfishly\nand docilely to experimentation and observation\u2014some-\ntimes prolonged and very tedious\u2014our sincerest thanks\nare due ; and are due, if for no other reason at least\nfor this, that it is their collaboration which has saved\nus from the awkward necessity of relying for a large\nand important part of our evidence on professional\nsubjects.\nYet while the institution of a Society has brought\nthese and other advantages with it, I would not deny\nthat it has entailed, or may entail, some drawbacks\nand disappointments. Let me begin with the disappoint-\nments : two in number. The first is the relatively small\nnumber of members who have been willing, not now\nand again and for a short period, but systematically\nand regularly, to work at our subject. When we con-\nsider the number of highly-educated people with private\nmeans in this country, and how many of them under-\ntake work of a public character without remuneration,\n\fXCI.] Presidential Address 141\nand how many of such people there must be in the\nranks of our members, we may naturally feel disappointed\nthat so few have devoted themselves to Psychical Research.\nThe second disappointment is the faUing-off of recent years\nin the number of cases contributed by our members.\nMembers would no doubt excuse their inactivity on various\ngrounds ;\nbut, short of there being no cases to report,\nno excuse is valid in face of the need, the ever-present\nneed, of fresh evidence. On this head I have to enlarge\nat some length.\nOne reason why it is highly desirable to keep up a\nconstantly fresh supply of evidence is the need for mere\naccumulation, quantity of evidence being of prime impor-\ntance where crucial tests and cases are not be had.\nA second reason is that our sort of evidence has a\ntendency to lose its value and effect as it grows old.\nA case, even if contemporaneously and carefully recorded,\nthat dates back 20, 30, or 40 years, is apt to produce\nless effect on our mmds than a well-recorded case of\nrecent date. Why this should be so I am by no means\nclear ; and no doubt the tendency to feel a lessened\nconfidence in old evidence is not entirely rational. Yet\nit is not entirely irrational, for in the case of old evidence\nwe must always have the feeling that the chances are\nagainst our being able to clear up doubtful points by\ncross-examining the witnesses, either because they are\nno longer alive, or, because if tlxey do survive, their\nrecollections after so long a lapse of time would not be\nworth much. I have purposely not spoken of cases\nthat go back more than forty years because that would\nhave included evidence collected in the Dark Ages before\nthe foundation of this Society, and much of that evidence\nwould be open to the suspicion of having been recorded\nand collected by people who were not fully alive to\nall the sources of error. I am speaking of our own\nevidence only, which m spite of its high quahty tends\nto decrease in value as time goes on. I would ask\nyou to consider what effect our evidence would be likely\nto have upon mankind 200 years hence, if for some\nreason or other aU work on and interest in the subject\n\f142 J. G. Piddington [part\nsuddenly came to a full .stop to-morrow, and all existing\nrecords of psychical phenomena were utterly lost sight\nof until by a happy accident in the year 2124 a com-\nplete set of S.P.R. Proceedings was discovered and\nattracted the attention of a group of thinkers like the\ngroup that founded our Society. These men would, I\nfancy, not fail to recognise that they had Lighted on a\nbody of first-class evidence collected with every proper\ncare and analysed with critical acumen, which prejudice\nalone could ignore. But would they accept the evidence\nas it stood ? I very much doubt it. I think they\nwould say :\n\" This evidence is too old ; it's 200 years\nold ; and before we accept it, we must see whether\nour own investigations and experiences will corroborate\nit.\" In the same way our past evidence will with every\ndecade or so lose some of its cogency with the new\ngeneration unless it is being constantly reinforced by\nnew evidence. Yet, notwithstanding that I take this\nview of our sort of evidence, I should presume that\nevidence given, say, in a trial for murder 200 years\nago would be worth as much now as then, if fully and\ncarefully recorded. How, then, should I explain the\nenduring worth of the evidence in the one case and\nits diminishing worth in the other 1 I should hesitate\nto assert, but I would venture to suggest that the differ-\nence would be due to the fact that in the one case we\nare absolutely certain that murder is committed, even\nif we have never seen a murder committed or com-\nmitted one ourselves ; while none of us is quite so\nabsolutely certain, and most people are far less certain,\nthat anything \" supernormal \" ever occurs. Will it, then,\nbe always necessary to go on collecting fresh evidence ?\nAnd if we don't, will the effect of all the evidence so\nfar collected gradually disappear in course of time ?\nOnce more I would not like to attempt a dogmatic\nanswer ; ])ut I should anticipate that it will l)e necessary\nto hammer away at the task of renewing the evidence\nuntil supernormal phenomena come to be believed in\nnearly as readily as, say, murder ;\nuntil, in fact, a habit\nof belief in them has become general.\n\fXCI.] Presidential Address 143\nWhile I am on this subject of deterioration in the\nvalue of evidence through lapse of time, I should Hke\nto touch on the effect on it of distance, especially where\ndistance involves difference of nationality, although to\ndo so involves a digression. I find in my own case\nthat as a general ride I do not attach the same weight\nto the evidence of foreigners, even of Americans, as to\nthe evidence of my own countrymen ; and having no\nreason .to think that I am singular in this respect, I\nassume the impression to be a common one. At first\nsight this may appear like mere insular prejudice ; but\nI think it is really nothing of the kind, and that the\nfeeling has a rational basis. For it is not based on\ndistrust of foreigners, but on distrust of my own ability\nto estimate the value of evidence given by foreigners.\nWhen trying to make up one's mind what amoimt of\ntrust to repose in the testimony of a fellow-countryman,\none's judgement is influenced, conscioiisly and unconsciously,\nby innumerable little impalpable imponderable indications ;\nand I feel sure that in the main such indications do\nreally help towards the formation of a correct conclusion.\nBut with witnesses of foreign nationality one is all at\nsea in this respect. If you question this, imagme to\n3'^ourselves an Enghshman being tried in this country\non a criminal charge before a jury, not of his own country-\nmen, but\u2014by some Gilbertian freak\u2014of Italians perfectly\nfamiliar with colloquial English but with no experience\nof English life ; and then imagine this jury trying to\nassess the value of evidence given by the following English\nwitnesses ; an archdeacon, a laundryman, an official of\nthe Post Office, a lodging-house keeper, a veterinary\nsurgeon, a lady's-maid, an Oxford don, a poKce-constable\nand a West-end tailor. How they would flounder\n!\nWhen we try to form an opinion of cases in which\nthe evidence comes from foreigners, our task is akin\nto the one I have imposed on my hypothetical Italian\njury. And, reciprocally, if foreigners do not feel towards\nour evidence what I feel towards theirs, I think they\nought to.\nThe extreme difficulty of making the evidence in such\n\f144 J. G. Piddmgton [part X(\nmatters as we investigate equally valid for other nation- it\nalities makes me sceptical of the utility of international ei\nco-operation in psychical research ; and inclines me to ti\nthink that if a nation desires to learn the truth about a\npsychical phenomena it must to a very large extent work 1)'\nout its own salvation. 8\nAfter this long digression you may well have forgotten 1)\nwhere I was when I started upon it. I had been men- If\ntioning two disappomting features in the history of the \u00bb\nSociety : namely, the small number of members who o\nhave systematically devoted themselves to psychical a\nresearch, and the falling-off in recent years in the number -\nof cases contributed by members. i\nI turn now to speak of certain drawbacks which our t\nexistence as a Society has entailed, or may entail. ,\ns\nThe first and most obvious one is that the work of t\nrunning a Society with a membership as large as ours f\nmeans the expenditure of a good deal of time and energy i\nthat might otherwise be spent on investigation ; for it '\n\\\nso happens that those who have borne a large share i\nof the research work have also borne a large share in i\nthe management of the business affairs of the Society. (\nWhy not divide the labour, it may be asked, and so ]\nrelieve the investigators from mere routine work ? '\nTheoretically that sounds plausible ; but I doubt whether 1\nit would work well in practice. It is right that those i\nwho have the most extensive first-hand experience of ;\nthe phenomena that the Society was formed to investigate\nshould also have a controlling voice in the direction of\nits policy, and questions of policy are too closely bound\nup with the business side of the organisation for the ]\ntwo to be under separate management.\nA second, and more serious, drawback that our existence\nas a corporate body entails is the risk of the control\nof the Society passing into the hands of a section of\nits members, who would be hkely to lower the severely\ncritical standard that has so far been maintained\u2014and\nmamtained sometimes in the face of considerable dis-\nsatisfaction. It is not easy to find a name for this\nsection, whose existence, in spite of its not being organised,\nI\n\fXCI.] Presidential Address 145\nit would be idle to deny. I would not call it the\ncredulous section, for, apart from the offence that that\ntitle would probably give, I do not think that, exceptis\nexcipiendis, they are credulous as a body. They doubtless\nbelieve some things that most members of the Royal\nSociety in common with the man in the street do not\nbeheve ; but that is no criterion of credulity ;| or at\nleast I hope it isn't, for if it is, I am \"of all men\nmost miserable.\" Sir OHver Lodge on one occasion\n\u2014\nor so I believe, though I have failed to trace the reference,\nand so if I am misrepresenting him, I ask his forgiveness\n\u2014Sir Oliver once divided the members of this Society\ninto a Bight and a Left Wing. The Right comprised\nthose of cautious and conservative views who uphold the\nstrictest methods of investigation ; the Left comprised\nthose who beheve more than the Right think is good\nfor them, who desire to join hands with or to enter\ninto closer touch mth professed Spiritualists and to\npropagate their faith in partibus infidelium with a mission-\nary zeal distasteful to the Right, and who would not\nview with alarm some relaxation in the rigorous methods\nof investigation hitherto pursued. But to christen the\nparticular section I am seeking to define \" the Left\nWing \" would be misleading ; for though it doubtless\nbelongs to the Left, it is quite possible, as I know from\nmy own case, to belong to the Left in matters of belief,\nand yet to adhere to the Bight\u2014even to the Extreme\nBight\u2014in respect of all that concerns methods of investi-\ngation. For my immediate purpose, then, Sir Oliver's\ndichotomy will not serve ; and to bring out what it\nis that separates the particular section of members of\nwhom I am speaking from those opposed to them, I\nshall call the latter the High-and-Dry School and the\nformer\u2014since the obvious antithesis might be actionable\n\u2014^the Not-High-and-Dry School. The dividing line here\nhas nothing to do with how much or how little of the\nphenomena under investigation one accepts as supernormal,\nand concerns only opinions as to methods of investigation\nand standards of evidence. The Not-High-and-Dries, if\nI do not misrepresent them, take the line that so much\n\f14fi J. n. Pifldinqfon [par\\\nhas been established be3^ond cavil that we can now\nsafely relax to some extent the stringent precautions and\nthe very high standard of evidence on which the Society\nhas hitherto insisted, and generally adopt a less suspicious\nand more genial attitude towards mediums, automatists,\ndreamers of dreams, seers of apparitions, corroborating\nwitnesses and so forth. ,\nThe High-and-Dries take the\nline that we cannot now, or for a long time to come,\nand probably ever, afford to lower our \" evidential\n\"\nstandard, or modify our methods\u2014our admittedly irritating\nand meticulously wary methods\u2014of investigation. Well,\nI for one am whole-heartedly on the side\u2014I will not\nsay, of the Angels, but\u2014of the High-and-Dries ; and\nthat there exists a school of opposite views is due, I\ncannot but suspect, to a failure to realise\u2014to realise\nnot momentarily but always and vividly\u2014one dominant\ncharacteristic of all, or very nearly all, the phenomena\nwe investigate : I mean their easy simulalnlity. For\ngenuine supernormal phenomena can be aped in various\nways : by dehberate fraud, by subliminal fraud, and by\nfraud that hovers between these two ;\nand, furthermore,\na semblance of them may be created by faulty memory,\nby careless recording, or by chance. Had the labours\nof the S.P.R. resulted in the accumulation of good\nevidence for witches riding through the air on broom-\nsticks, or for repeated correct predictions in minute\ndetail of events apparently beyond the powers of ordinary\nforesight and inference ; if , in a word, there had been\nplaced on record a mass of good evidence for the occur-\nrence of things simulable only by extraordinary and costly\nmechanical devices, or not simulalile by any known\nnormal agencies, then there might have been something\nto say for the policy of less stringency. But there is\nno such evidence, none for witches riding on broomsticks\nor similar marvels ; and unless and until there is good\nevidence\u2014not an occasional scrap, but a mass of it\n\u2014\nfor phenomena outside the range of easy simulation,\nthere is only one safe and sane policy, and that is to\nmaintain our High-and-Dry methods and standards. In\na trance-sitting, of which I have seen the record, Frederic\n\fpaeI'^'^^\"^\nPresidential Address 147\nJVtyers is represented as commenting disapprovingly on\nan unpublished piece of investigation recently carried out.\nWhether IMyers was really in any Avay concerned is, of\ncoui-se, open to question; but the plu-ase with which the\nsoi-disant Myers brought liis critical remarks to an end\nwas at least true to life: \"No sloppy work, please\"; and\nif I quote it at this point it is not because I think the\nNot-High-and-Dries like sloppy work, but because I\nbelieve that if our standards were to be lowered, sloppv\nwork would be the inevitable result.\nI have to deal with only one other disadvantage that\nmay arise from investigation being conducted through\nthe agency of a Society, and then I have almost done.\nIt IS obvious that a membership such as ours must\ninclude a large number of persons whose interest in\npsychical research is not that of the expert, Init rather\nthat of the amateur ; and. again, a considerable number\nwhose interest m the subject is emotional rather than\nintellectual. I hope I may say this without giving\noffence, and that for two reasons : one being that I\nthink it is a good thing that it should be so; the other,\nthat I am myself a member of other Societies with whose\nobjects I feel sjanpathy, but whose work I am either\nunable to follow, or can follow only in a very amateurish\nway. Now, if our Society is composed largely of members\nof these types, there must always be a risk of then?\nsevering then- connexion with it should they find our papers\ndifficult to follow, or should they fail to obtain satisfaction\nfor their emotional requirements ; or else a risk of their\nbringing such pressure to bear that genuinely scientific Avork\nwill be sacrificed for the sake of making our Proceedings'\nmore popular and attractive. Experience shows that all\nsciences, simple enough in their infancy, increase in\ncomplexity as they grow older. Take, for example,\nthe simple experiments undertaken in the early days\nof the Royal Society by men with little or no\nspecialised training and easily followed by anyone of\ndecent intelligence, and compare the reports of them\nwith the Transactions and Proceedings of that Society\nto-day. These pubhcations, I have heard it whispered,\n\f148 J. G. Piddington [part\ncontain many papers so abstruse as to be unintelligible\nto the majority of Fellows and digestible by only a very\nfew experts in the particular branch of science of which\nthey treat. Now imagine for a moment that as soon\nas physical science had begun to make progress, and as\na consequence had begun to be split up into different\nspecialised departments, and the Transactions as a further\nconsequence had become increasingly difficult to under-\nstand,\u2014imagine, I say, that the lay members of the\nRoyal Society had objected on the ground that though,\nof course, they weren't asking for light reading, they\nreally did think that these recent papers were too stiff.\nSuppose further that thek protest had met with such\nsuccess from a sympathetic but weak Council that thence-\nforward only records of experiments and observations\nwhich the average layman could follow without taxing\nhis brains had received official publication\u2014well, if that\nhad happened, what would be the position of physical\nscience in this country to-day ? Luckily for science\nand for the Royal Society no such catastrophe as I\nhave asked you to imagine overtook it ; and I hope\nthat such a catastrophe may never debilitate or destroy\nour Society. But if, like other sciences, psychical research\nincreases in complexity, I can well imagine that the\nresult might be either a very serious, even fatal loss\nof interest and consequently of members, and consequently\nof income ;\nor, still worse, surrender to a demand for\npublications of a more popular kind :\n\u2014a surrender that\nmight, indeed, preserve the Society, but which would\ndestroy its real utility. For what would it profit to\nsave the Society and to forfeit the end to which the\nSociety is but a means ? It might, indeed, matter\nlittle, if there were in this country other bodies ready\nand competent to perform what I conceive to be our\nspecial duty ; and that is to investigate certain obscure\nphenomena, and to carry on that investigation not for\nthe sake of entertaining people, or with a view to con-\nverting people to any particular articles of faith, but\nsimply and solely in the hope of discovering the true\nfacts. Though various other organisations exist for the\n\f,Oji\ntrue\nxci.] Presidential Address 149\nstudy of psychical phenomena, they seem to me to\napproach the subject with a definifce parti pris : and I\nknow of no other body actuated solely by scientific\ncuriosity and with a set determination to follow the\nevidence wheresoever it may lead, that could take our\nplace, were we to prove false to our trust ; and that is\nwhy I am a little apprehensive lest, as our subject becomes\nmore complex, we should either suffer so large a loss\nof members as to cripple our activities, or\u2014what would\nbe much worse\u2014cater for popularity by neglecting the\ninvestigation or cold-shouldering the presentment of the\nmore involved phenomena. And, as I have already said,\nas the enquiry proceeds, unless Psychical Research is\nto prove an exception to the general rule, the subject\nis bound to become more complex. Indeed, it has become\nso already, partly from the mere accumulation of material ;\nbut also from another cause. I have pointed out before\n\u2014and I do not apologise for doing so again, because\nthe thing deserves attention\u2014that up to the time of\nFrederic Myers's death in January, 1901, the phenomena\nrecorded in our Proceedings were, to speak broadly and\nroughly, of a simple and straightforward type. Within\na few weeks of his death a change takes place, though\nit is not realised\u2014at least not fully realised\u2014till much\nater. I am not speaking at this moment of what are\nsailed cross-correspondences, for that development came\nater, but of Mrs. Verrall's scripts. I cannot go into\nietail now, but speaking briefly I may say that these\njcripts mark a new departure in so far as they exhibit\n^reat complexity of structure, each several script forming\nI minute piece of a most elaborate and extensive mosaic,\nihe pattern of which cannot be traced until all the\nittle pieces are put together in accordance with subtle\nndications furnished in the scripts themselves. Then,\nn 1903, with the advent on the scene of Mrs. Holland,\nI further complication ensues. Her script, which is of\n\u2022he same tessellated character as Mrs. Verrall's, exhibits,\niS was soon recognised, coincidences with Mrs. Verrall's\nar beyond what chance will account for. Then in rapid\nuccession other automatic writers mingle in the game :\n\f150 J. G. Piddingfon [pa.rt M.\nSo\nMrs. Salter, the Macs., Mrs. Willett, Mrs. Stuart Wilson,\nand Mrs. Lyttelton. The scripts of all these automatists,\ntoo, show just the same complexity of structure as Mrs.\nVerrall's and Mrs. Holland's ; and embedded in them\nall is a very galaxy of cross-correspondences. Of these\ncross-correspondences so far only a comparatively few\nspecimens have been published ; and yet enough, I think,\nto convince a careful student of them, even if the utmost\nallowance be made for chance coincidence and ingenuity\nof interpretation, that there are purpose and intelligent\ndirection at work.\nSo, then, we have not had long to wait for psychical\nresearch to follow the example of other sciences and be-\ncome more and more complex. It has already become\nso, and become so not only from mere accumulation of I\nto\nmaterial and from the growth of literature on the subject, it\nbut from the greater complexity of the phenomena them-\nselves. And here incidentally I would call your attention\nto the fact that this greater complexity arises from\nsomeone's intelligent design. I am not troubling about\nthe question of what intelligence or intelligences are\nresponsible for the design. Assume, if you will, the\ndesign and the carrying out of it to be the work of\nan unknown living person ; or assume them to be the\nwork of more than one of the automatists themselves\n\u2014I say \" more than one,\" because for various reasons a\nthey cannot possibly be entirely the work of one only 1\nof the automatists ; or assume them to be the work I nil\nof discarnate intelligences ; the fact, or so I hold, remains it\nthat some intelligence is deliberately complicating some !\n1\nof the phenomena which this Society investigates. If j\nthat be true, we are faced with a difficulty peculiar, I\nI believe, to our own field of research, and certainly\nunknown to physical science. For though physical science\nhas to deal with immensely complex problems, it never\nhas to assume that its problems are being intentionally\ncomplicated for it by some designing Demiurge. Our\nDemiurge may have the best of motives, and may\nintroduce his complexities, not in order to bewilder us,\nbut for the purpose of rendering the phenomena as\ntre;\neei\n\fXCI.] Presidential Address 151\ndifficult as possible to explain by telepathy inter vivos,\nor for other reasons ; but however excellent his intentions,\nthere is no escaping from the fact that the increased\ncomplexity has increased the difficulty of presenting the\nevidence in a form palatable to the average member,\nwho naturally cannot be expected to give the same\nminute attention to the problems involved as the in-\nvestigators. And yet without minute attention these\ncomplicated phenomena cannot be properly understood.\nSo far our members have shown a laudable long-sufferance,\nand if I have ventured to voice a doubt of its con-\ntinuance, it is because I realise to the full how large\nis the draft Ave have made upon it. But such of us\nas have been guilty of contributing papers about these\ncomplex phenomena to the Proceedings may in one respect\nat least claim the gratitude of our readers ; for we have\nnot, as we easily might have, inflicted on them the labour\nof making themselves acquainted with a lot of new-\nfangled technical terms. When I come across some of\nthe monstrosities of this kmd that disfigure the writings\nof modern psychologists, and especially of those who\ntreat of psycho-analysis, I admit that I am seized with\nthe spirit of the Pharisee, and thank God that we are\nnot as other men are.\nOn reading over what I had written thus far, with\na view to seeing how to bring this address to a close,\nI was reminded of a remark made to me by a friend\nwho happened to know that I was engaged upon wTiting\nit. \"Don't be too depressing,\" she said. Holding, as\nI do, that results of a far-reaching and inspiriting kind\nhave been attained through the labours of the S.P.R.,\nI certamly did not set out with the intention of producing\na depressing effect ; and I hope I have not produced\none unwittingly. Yet, at the same time, I confess that\nI should not be sorry if anything I have said should\nhelp to check exaggerated notions of the degree of\ncertainty attained and attainable in such researches as\nours. There seems to me to be a growing risk of belief\noutrunnmg the evidence, and too Kttle reahsation\u2014at\nany rate among the public\u2014of the patience and care\n\f152 J. 0.

How ready and eager many\nare to seek after signs, and how utterly uncritical in\ntheir search, no unprejudiced observer, alive to what\nhas been going on around him during the past 10 years\nof crisis, can surely deny. Credulity and superstition,\ntwo of the greatest evils that afflict mankind, are plants\nof rapid growth ; and when sooner or later the day\ncomes\u2014as come, I firmly believe, it will\u2014when com-\nmunication between the dead and the living has become\npart\u2014rightly become part\u2014of the accepted beliefs of\nmankind, there will ensue, I greatly fear, a period in\nwhich these two evils will flourish ; and the general\npublic, incapable of making fine distinctions, will swallow\ngenuine, ambiguous, illusory and fraudu.lent phenomena\nwith equal avidity. I do not, of course, flatter myself\nthat any words of mine could directly serve to prevent\nor counteract so unfortunate a state of things\u2014and one,\nmoreover, calculated to bring unmerited contempt upon\nthe whole subject. To do that, one would have to\nhave the ear of the public.

H. Salter.\nIf the \" One-Horse Dawn Experiment \" were of less\ninterest to students of Psychical Research, I should feel\nthat some apology was necessary for recurring to so\nancient a topic. Happening, however, recently to have\nstumbled on a fact which seems to throw light on an\nimportant script of Mrs. Verrall, which has never been\nsatisfactorily explained, I have ventured to contribute this\nnote to a discussion which cannot be regarded as closed\nso long as the smallest dark corner remains unexplored.\nFor full details of the experiment I must refer the\nreader to Mrs. Verrall's paper {Proc, Vol. XX.) and to\nMr. Piddington's comments {Proc, Vol. XXX., pp. 175-229\nand 296-305), but the following short summary may be of\nassistance.\nIn April 1901 Dr. Verrall attempted to transmit tele-\npathically to Mrs. Verrall three Greek words (moioVwAoc e?\n'Aw) from the Orestes of Euripides, mth a view to their\ninfluencing her automatic scripts. Between this date and\nOctober 1902, when the nature of the experiment was dis-\nclosed to her by Dr. Verrall, Mrs. Verrall wrote a large\nnumber of scripts containing apparent attempts to repro-\nduce either the sound or the sense of these three words.\nThe scripts of this period also contained numerous allu-\nsions, (1) to Dr. Benson and Welhngton College, where\nDr. Verrall had been at school under Dr. Benson and\nwhere the lifelong friendship between them began ; and\n(2) to a blind old man, journeying alone and dressed in\n\f154 W. H. Salter [part\nwhite robes, whose identity is the main subject of Mr.\nPiddington's papers in Proc, Vol. XXX.\nThe particular script to which I wish to refer is that of\nthe 9th September, 1901, which contained the following\nwords :\n\u2014\nFind the herb moly that will help\u2014it is a guide\n(I'jTii. i<al Tt\/Vos- A\/yi^e(s (\n= seek and in the end you will\nunderstand).\nThe words '\nherb jnoly '\nwere written larger than the rest\nof the script.\nWhen, at the close of the experiment, Dr. and Mrs.\nVerrall went over the scripts together, they noticed several\nattempts to reproduce the sound of \/jlovottwXov (monopolon),\nand considered that '\nmoly '\nwas a not very successful\nspecimen of this class. They were, however,\" puzzled by\nthe fact that more emphasis seemed to be laid by the\nscripts on '\nherb moly '\nthan on other similar attempts at\nassonance. They considered, and, I think, there can be\nno doubt, rightly, that a reference was intended to the\npassage in Milton's Comus, where the Attendant Spirit\ngives to the two brothers the magic herb haemony. The\npassage (11. 623-637) runs as follows\nHe [i.e. '\na certain shepherd lad '] loved me well and oft\nwould hear me sing\nWhich, when I did, he on the tender grass\nWould sit, and hearken even to ecstasy,\nAnd in requital ope his leathern scrip,\nAnd show me simjiles of a thousand names,\nTelling their strange and vigorous faculties.\nAmongst the rest a small unsightly root\nBut of divine effect, he culled me out.\nThe leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it.\nBut in another country, as lie said,\nBore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil.\nUnknown and like esteemed, and the dull swain\nTreads on it daily M'ith his clouted shoon :\nAnd yet more med'cinal is it than that moly\nThat Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.\n\f)Ir.\nrag\nXCI.] \" One-Horm Dawn Scripts \" 155\nIt will be remembered that in the Odyssey (X. 281-306)\nHermes gives the herb moly to Odysseus (Ulysses) as a\ncounter-charm against the spells of Circe, just as in\nMilton's poem the Attendant Spirit gives the herb haemony\nto the two brothers as a counter-charm against the spells\nof Circe's son, Comus. But what was the connection\nbetween the passage from Comas and the passage from\nthe Orestes ?\nWhen Dr. Verrall sat for the Classical Tripos in 1873,\none of the papers, as he remembered, had included the\nOrestes passage. After she had been told all about the\nexperiment, Mrs. Verrall looked through the other papers\nset for the same examination, and discovered the curious\nfact, which Dr. Verrall had, consciously at any rate, quite\nforgotten, that the Comus passage had been set for trans-\nlation into Latin verse. Mrs. Verrall in her paper iia\nProc, Vol. XX. (p. 164), expressed the view that the\nscript registered not only an existing mental impression of\nher husband's, but also a forgotten past impression, once\nclosely associated with the first. This view is not accepted\nby Mr. Piddington {Proc, Vol. XXX., pp. 225-228), partly\non the ground that the opportunities for chance-coincidence\nin papers set in a Classical Tripos examination are ex-\nceedingly wide. It would not be relevant to the purpose\nof this note to express any opinion as to which of these\ntwo views is justified.\nRecently, however, I chanced upon another association\nof the Comus passage, which links it very closely with\nEuripides, Dr. Verrall, Mrs. Verrall, Dr. Benson, Welhngton\nCollege, and also, though the connection in this last case is\nnot quite as clear, with the blind Old Man in White.\nIn 1881 Dr. Verrall pubhshed his first book, an edition\nof the Medea of Euripides. He was at the time engaged\nto Mrs. Verrall, to whom he presented a copy now in my\nwife's possession. This copy has on the fly-leaf in Dr.\nVerrall's handwriting, \" if. de G. if.,\" the initials of Mrs.\nVerrall' s maiden name, and on the page opposite, above\nhis own initials, A. W. V., a line from the play which is\nevidently intended by him as a chaffing allusion to their\nengagement. The book is dedicated \" To the Right\n\f1\n156 W. H. Salter [part\nReverend Edward White Benson, D.D., Lord Bishop of\nTruro and formerly Head Master of WelUngton College.\"\nIn the Introduction (pp. viii to xi) Dr. Verrall discusses\nthe various ways in which classical texts become corrupted,\nand the principles which he considers should be applied in\nrestoring them. He illustrates his argument by supposing\nthat Milton's Covins had been \" preserved in manuscript\ncopies only, made by ill-educated persons, and that we\nhave to ascertain from five such copies . . . the description\nof the magic haemony.\" He then proceeds to take the\ntwo lines :\n\u2014\nUnknown and like esteemed : and the duU swain\nTreads on it daily with his clouted shoon,\nand supposes that one group of manuscripts, while pre-\nserving the sense, has departed from the exact form of\nthe words, and that the other, while keeping closer to the\nsound of the original, has degenerated into sheer nonsense.\nFinally he shows how by comparing the different per-\nversions of the manuscripts in detail, it would be possible\nto restore, with a fair degree of certainty, the original\ntext.\nHere then we have a play of Euripides, the aixthor from\nwhom the subject of the experiment was drawn, edited as\nhis first published work by Dr. Verrall, the agent in the\nexperiment, presented by him to Mrs. Verrall, the per-\ncipient, on a memorable occasion, and dedicated to Dr.\nBenson, formerly Head Master of Wellington, to whom\nand to whose former school the scripts have made frequent\nreferences ; and in the Introduction we find that this\nparticidar passage of Conius is discussed at considerable\nlength. These correspondences taken together seem to me\nto go far beyond the possibilities of chance-coincidence.\nMr. Piddington has reminded me of a later script of\nMrs. Verrall's, written during the course of the experiment,\nwhich is also, I think, designed to draw attention to Dr.\nVerrall' s edition of the Medea. 1 mean the script of the\n21st June, 1902, printed on pp. 425, 426 of Proc, Vol. XX.\nThe relevant part of the script for the present purpose is\nas follows :\n\u2014\" Not Luria but Lyssa gives the keynote, he\nI\n\fXCI.] \" One-Horse Dawn Scripts \" 157\nmust complete. It is better than the Editing\u2014more full\nof life\u2014more a thing for men.\"\nThe script was recognised by Mrs. Verrall as having\nDr. Benson for the ostensible communicator, and as\nreferrmg by the words \" Luria \" and \" Lyssa \" to an\nEssay on Euripides' Hercules Furens on which Dr. Verrall\nwas then engaged. For the sake of brevity I would refer\nthe reader to ]\\Irs. Verrairs own comments on pp. 1-iO,\n141 and 302 of Proc, Vol. XX. The \" he \" of the script\nis, of course, Dr. Verrall.\nNow the script clearly draws a distinction between the\nnature of the work which Dr. Verrall was then doing, and\n\" the Editing,\" and the point of the distinction is this.\nDr. Verrall edited two plays of Euripides {Medea and Ion)\nand four of Aeschylus, and achieved a high reputation by\nthe brilliance of his textual criticism. But his most dis-\ntinctive work was as an interpreter of these authors. In\nparticular he propounded a quite revolutionary view as to\nthe aims and method of Euripides. The Essay on the\nHercules Furens was a work of interpretation not of\nediting, and his editions of the Ion and the four plays of\nAeschylus consist largely of interpretative matter. There\nis one, and only one, of Dr. Verrall's works which can be\nconsidered as an edition in the ordinary sense, and that is\nthe Medea.\nI may add that the Essay on the Hercules Furens was\npubHshed in 1905 in a volume which also contained an\nEssay on the Orestes. I have not, however, been able to\nascertain when this last Essay was begun, and accordingly\ndo not suggest any direct connection between the script\nin question and that play, from which were drawn the\nwords which were the subject of the experiment.\nTo revert to the '\nherb moly '\nscript, while I have no\ndoubt that the object of this script, and of the Benson-\nWellington scripts, was to establish, via the Medea, an\nEuripides -Dr. Verrall -Mrs. Verrall connection, I also sug-\ngest, more speculatively, that there is an attempt to add,\nby means of the Introduction to the play, an essential\nitem to the description of the Old Man in White.\nOne of the causes of manuscript errors to which Dr.\n\f158 W. H. Salter [part 5\nVerrall refers is the substitution of common words for rare\nor archaic ones, e.g. '\npeasant ' for '\nswain.' '\nPeasant '\ni\nmight be written over '\nswain ' by way of gloss or ex- (\nplanation in one MS., and be substituted for 'swain' in [\na later MS. deriving from the first. He supposes that we\nhave among our MSS. a glossary to JMilton, containing the\nentries Swain, a peasant, and Sckip, a hag ; and that in\nconsequence some of the MSS. gave in 11. 634 and 626\nrespectiveh' the readings '\npeasant '\nand '\nleathern bag '\nfor\nthe '\nswain '\nand '\nleathern scrip '\nof the original.\nNow the f)articular example he gives of the supposed 1\nperversion of '\nscrip '\ninto '\nbag '\nseems to me significant. [\nReaders of Mr. Piddington's paper will remember that he i\nidentifies the Old Man in White of Mrs. Verrall's scripts 'i\nwith Oedipus as described by Sophocles in the Oedipus \\<\nColoneus, and by Jebb in his notes to that play. All the ^\ndetails of the description, Oedipus' blindness, his age, his\nwhite hairs, his staff, his loneliness '\nalone with God and i\nnone other,' the white robes put on by him before his t\npassing, appear clearly in the scripts. One detail only is s\nmissing, or rather fails to come out distinctly. Oedipus, i\nas beggar, should carry a wallet : the old man of the I\nscripts carries '\na small square box '\nwhich '\nmight be a [\nbook.\" Mr. Piddington conjectures, with great probability, e\nthat the box or book of the scripts was a visual misinter- a\npretation by the automatist of the idea of a wallet, c\n'\nwhich was squarish and made of leather.' i\nIf the idea of '\nwallet '\nhad come through correctly, it ?\nseems probable that Dr. and Mrs. Verrall would have '[\nrecognised the allusions to Oedipus, have Ijeen led thereby\nto refreshing their memory of Jebb's edition, and so\narrived at the connection with the Orestes passage which\nMr. Piddington has elucidated. The mistake of '\nbox '\n. or\n'\nbook,' small as it was, appears to have sufficed to put\nthem oft' the track. I suggest that the emphatic advice\nto '\nfind the herb moly,' i.e. to consult the Introduction\n'\nto the Medea, had, as one of its objects, l)y drawing their ]\nattention to perversions of sense, substitution of words and\nthe idea of a '\nleathern scrip '\nor wallet, to put them\nback on the right line of enquiry.\n\f'\nXCI.] \" One-Horse Dawn Scripts \" 159\n'\nOn my communicating the substance of this note to\nMr. Piddington, he wrote in reply, \" I think there is\nconfirmation of your conjecture to be found in the follow-\n\u00bb\ning script of M. V.'s, dated Feb. 10, 1913 :\u2014\nt\nJ\n'\nTreads on it daily with his clouted shoon\nColin Clout's come home agaui\nj\nBut perhaps the French word is more intelligible\nJ\nClou, to hit the nail on the head. That is what I\nwant to say.'\n\"\n1 This script, of which I was not previously aware, was\n,\nproduced after Dr. Verrall's death. Whoever may have\nf inspired it, there seems a clear intention to emphasise the\ni importance of the only previous reference in Mrs. Verrall's\n'\nscripts to this passage of Comtis, namely that of the 9th\nSeptember, 1901.\nIn any case, and whether my interpretation be right or\nwrong, it is curious that both Dr. and Mrs. Verrall, when\ncasting about for possibly relevant associations with Comus,\nshould have overlooked the Introduction to the Medea, in\nview of the circumstances attending the publication of the\nbook and its presentation by one to the other. It would,\nhowever, seem not infrequently to be the case that persons\nengaged in the production of scripts fail to recognise\nallusions and associations which they would in other\ncircumstances be the first to seize on. Perhaps this is a\nmerciful dispensation, framed so as to enable those of us\nwho have not the gift of automatism to take a part,\nhowever small, in the great game.\nII. THE PRECOCIOUS OLIVE.\nBy J. G. Piddington.\nIn her account (Proc, Vol* XX., pp. 156-167) of the\n\" One-Horse Dawn \" experiment Mrs. Verrall (p. 157)\nwrote as follows :\n\u2014\nThis experiment was devised by my husband in April\n1901, and the three words [\/^oi'OTrojAoi' k 'Aw, i.e. \" to the\none-horsed Dawii \"] were then written down, with the\n\f160 J. O. Piddington [part\nintention of seeing whether my hand {i.e. script] would\nmake any attempt to reproduce his thought. The paper on\nwhich the words were written was put into an envelope,\nplaced by him, to the best of his belief, in the drawer of\nhis writing-table, where he is in the habit of keeping\npapers. The drawer is not used by anyone but himself.\nHe had not made, he tells me, any experiment before.\nMrs. Verrall added a footnote to the effect that the paper\non which Dr. Verrall wrote the three words was \" mislaid\nor lost,\" and \" could not be found when the experiment\nwas ended.\"\nThe experiment, it should be observed, is here said to\nhave been devised, not merelj^ started, in April 1901 :\nthat is to say,\u2014if Mrs. Verrall chose her words in this\ninstance as carefully as she usually did\u2014Dr. Verrall did\nnot begin to think about the experiment until April 1901.\nIt is not stated whether the note made of the three words\nbore a date, and as this note was lost, we cannot now\nascertain ; and we have to depend on Dr. Verrall's memory\nfor the date on which the experiment was devised. Dr.\nVerrall, however, was a man of an accurate habit of\nmind, and there is a strong presumption that, if he stated\nthat he devised the experiment in April 1901, he did\ndevise it in that month, and not in March or May or any\nother month of 1901.\nIn a paper called \" Fresh Light on the '\nOne-Horse Dawn '\nExperiment,\" and published in Proc, Vol. XXX., pp. 175-\n229, I discussed a number of references in Mrs. Verrall's\n\/\/oi'OTTwXoi' e? 'Aw (or, \" One-Horse Dawn \") scripts of 1901\nand 1902 to an Old Man in White, and argued that they\nwere all references to Oedipus : chiefly to Oedipus as he\nappears in the Oedipus Colonens of Sophocles, though one\nvery significant reference was implied to a passage in the\nOedipus Tyrannus. I argu^ further that the point of\nthese references was to be found in various notes of Jebb's\non the Oedipus Coloneus, and especially in a note of his\non the Oedijms Tyrannus in which he gives his view of\nthe meaning of the disputed word iJLovoirwXov in the\nphrase \/jloi'ottwXov eV Aw ; and I pointed out that Jebb\n\fI\nXCI.] \" One-Horse Dawn Scripts \" 161\n1\ngives a cross-reference to this particular note of his own\nin his comments on a Chorus in the Oedipus Coloneus to\nwhich Mrs. Verrall's scripts allude. Part of this Chorus\n[\nconsists of a eulogy of the Olive of Attica, and is thus\n, translated by Jebb :\n\u2014\nAnd a thing there is such as I know not by fame on\nAsian ground, or as ever born in the great Dorian isle of\nPelops,\u2014a growth unconquered [(fivrevij.' axeiponoi'], self-\nrenewing, a terror to the spears of the foemen, a growth\nwhich mightily flourishes in this land,\u2014the gray-leafed\n'\nolive, nurturer of children [yXavi<a^ Tr(LiooTp6(f>ov (fivkkov\neAai'as].

Jebb\ndoes not mean that baca Sahina is a regular name for\nolives, like our '\nBrazil nuts '\nfor a particular kind of nut.\nHe means that baca, literally a berry, is here used for the\nfruit of the olive-tree\u2014as, indeed, it often is by other\nLatin authors, with or without an epithet to distinguish\nit from other '\nberries.' By baca Sabina Juvenal meant\nSabine olives.\nMeanwhile, the bewildered reader may be wondering\nwhat Sabine berries and Jebb's note on TratSoTpncpou have\ngot to do with the \" One-Horse Dawn \" experiment.\nThe experiment, it will be remembered, was devised in\nApril 1901. On the afternoon of March 31, 1901,\u2014that is\nto say, before Dr. Verrall devised the experiment\u2014Mrs.\nVerrall wrote a script containing a good many discon-\nnected and apparently meaningless phrases, and among\nthem this one :\n\u2014\npraecox aha baccis Sabinis ponetur dis adiuventibus.\nIt may be translated :\n\u2014\n\" the early olive with Sabine berries will be planted with\nthe help of the gods.\" .

First, it clinches the argument put\norward in ray paper \" Fresh Light on the '\nOne-Horse\nDawn ' Experiment,\" which was that the clue to the\n\u2022epeated allusions in the \" One-Horse Dawn \" scripts to\n.he Old Man in White and to a good deal of the contexts\n)f these allusions is to be found in the Oedipus Goloneus\nlid in Jebb's notes thereon.\nSecondly, it leaves us faced with a very pretty problem.\n?or, at least one day, and perhaps several days, before\nDr. Verrall devised his experiment, allusion was made in\ntirs. Verrall's script to a note of Jebb's on a passage in\n\u2022he Oedipus Coloneus ; and this passage, as well as other\nlotes of Jebb's on the same play and on the companion\n)lay Oedipus Tyrannus, was subsequently utilised in Mrs.\nVerrall's scripts to indicate the words fxoi'OTrwXov e? 'Aw\nv^hich Dr. Verrall fixed upon in April 1901 as the subject\n)f his experiment.\nVarious ways of accounting for this odd fact may be\nnvented. If we assume that there is no mistake as to\nhe time when the experiment was first devised, we might\nake the hne that this new piece of evidence only goes to\nhow the diabohcal ingenuity of Mrs. Verrall's subliminal\n^The first mention of 'olive' after July 31, 1901, is on March 21,\n906 ; but this, like all other mentions of the olive in Mrs. Verrall's\n3ripts, is in English.

'Aw as a\npossible subject for experiment. If this were really the\ncase, the promptitude and appositeness of Mrs. Verrall's\nfirst reaction to her husband's subconscious thought stand\nout in marked contrast to the slowness and difficulty with\nwhich the response was afterwards completed when Dr.\nVerrall was consciously trying to convey his thought.\nOr again, we might assume that Dr. Verrall's memory\nplayed him false, and that he consciously devised the\nexperiment before the afternoon of March 31, 1901. But\nthose who knew Dr. Verrall will not readily, I think, call\nin question the accuracy of his memory.\nThere is a fourth hypothesis that I am not disposed to\npress, but which should not be entirely ignored. It is\nthat Dr. Verrall was not the real originator of the experi-\nment, but that he carried out an experiment which,\nthough he did not know it, another intelligence had devised\nand imposed vipon him. This hypothesis, lilce the other\nhypotheses, is, of course, incapable of proof ; but it at\nleast has the merit of simplicity, and only assumes the\npossibility of Dr. Verrall's being open to teiepathk\ninfluence.\nThose who prefer to regard all the phenomena of th(\n\" One-Horse Dawn \" case as due to telepathy inter viva\ncan pitch upon Mrs. Verrall as the intelligence thai\nsubliminally devised the experiment and telepathicall;5\nimposed it on Dr. Verrall.\nI may, perhaps, be allowed to add that, knowing th(\nways of scripts, I had often j)uzzled over the '\nolive\nreference in the script of March 31, 1901, and felt that i\nought to hitch on to the '\nolive '\nreference in the scrip\nof July 31, 1901, in spite of the fact that Dr. Verrall di(\n\fXCI.] \" One-Horse.

The\nadjective praecox is applied in Latin literature not only to\nplants that flower or fruit early, but to plants that fruit\nbefore their time. And that is exactly what the praecox\nolea of Mrs. Verrall's script did when it put in a\nprecocious appearance before the \" One-Horse Dawn \"\nexperiment officially began.\nJan.

A few new -points of view are now added here,\nhowever. What folloivs upon that is wholly loritten for these\nProceedings, and does not appear in the Warsaio jiaper.\nIn this article my intention is to view the so-called\nmediurnistic trance and its more important features in\nthe light of hypnotic phenomena. I believe that by this\nmethod it is possible to attain to a better understanding\nnot only of the conditions of the trance-state itseK, but\nalso of what the so-called \" personalities,\" manifesting in\nthe state, really are or\u2014are not.\nMrs. Piper.\nIn her elaborate exposition of the psychology of Mrs.\nPiper's trance (Vol. XXVIII. of these Proceedings) Mrs.\nSidgwick came to the conclusion that Mrs. Piper's trance\nvery probably was a state of self-induced hypnosis, in\nwhich she or her hypnotic self, by the help of sugges-\ntion, personated different characters either consciously or\niniconsciously.\nTo begin with, I wish to emphasize the importance of\na certain symptom which Mrs. Piper more or less often\nshowed in the intermediate stage between her deep sleep\n\fxci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mediumistic Trance 167\nor trance and her awake-condition, i.e. in lier coming-to-\nstate or awakening-condition.\nThis symptom was echolaha (repetition of words or\nsentences uttered by persons present). This proves that\nwhen Mrs. Piper came to she passed through a state of\nconsciousness which constitutes or corresponds to a\nhystero-hypnotic state, called by Charcot, Janet, Ochoro-\nwicz and others the cataleptic state, but which I prefer\nto call the automatic state, this being a more general\nterm. In this state the subject\u2014according not only to\nmy own, but also to observations made by others, e.g.\n0. Vogt\u2014hears spoken words, but does not understand\nthem. He repeats them parrot-like. The only form of\nsuggestibihty of which he might be said to be capable\nis one caused by images. These provoke hallucinations\nand, on the motor side, correspoijding automatic actions.\nIt is interesting that echolalia may also show itself not\nonly in certain cases of mental disease, often accompanied\nby echopraxia and echomimia, but also in encejjhalitis\nlethargica or on account of a bullet-wound in the frontal\nlobe of the bram (F3), etc. Here there exists no reason\nto suppose that it is caused by suggestion or at will.\nIt can therefore very well be conceived to show itself,\nwhen functional brain disturbances or blockades of a\ncertain kind exist, as for mstance in certain trance-phases,\nwithout the help of any suggestion or volition on the\npart of the subject. The opinion, held by probably most\nmodern hypnotizers, that echolalia in hypnosis is due to\nmental suggestion, as Mrs. Sidgwick rightly puts it, cannot\nbe maintained any longer. And for these reasons : (1) it\ncan occur, as I have found it to do, quite unexpectedly and\nunprovoked ;\n^\n(2) it occurs in a definite state, lying between\nwhat I caU \" light \" and \" deep \" hypnosis, which can be\nproduced experimentally, and in which verbal suggestions are\nnot obeyed, because not understood ; (3) mtelligent intro-\nspection, as in Vogt's case, confirms the truth of this ; and\n(4) similar reactions, for instance mimicry, occur in the same\nhypnotic, i.e. the automatic state, as echolalia does.\n^ This is also the opinion of Ochorowicz and Wingfield, as stated in\na personal communication to me.\n\f168 Dr. Sydney Alrvtz [part\nAs the echolalia occurred in the awakening-stage, it is\nevident that Mrs. Piper's deep sleep and trance proper\n\u2014\nsee the synoptic table below\u2014represented a nervous\ncondition in which the inhibition was still more profound\nthan in the automatic stage. She was, consequently, in\na state\u2014let us call it a state of lethargy\u2014where her\ncapabilitj^ of giving herself auto-suggestions, or d fortiori\nof receivuag and realismg suggestions from without, had\nceased to exist. It is also evident from other symptoms\nthat the trance-sfcate involved a diminution of excitability\nstretching more or less far down in the central nervous\nsystem: the lessened respiratory frequency (7-10 per minute)\nthe general insensibility and inertness, the lessened or\ninhibited reflexivity, the total colour-blindness (Mrs. Piper\nsaw objects, faces, black), the micropsia (objects were\nseen very much diminished), etc.\nIn this deep hypnosis Mrs. Piper doubtless also was\nincapable of receiving telepathic suggestions. The experi-\nments of Ochorowicz seem to prove this. One of his\nsubjects was very clearly susceptible to telepathic impulses\nof a motor kind in the automatic state. This form of\nsensibility ceased however in the lethargic state.\nThe ijrobability tliat the personalities of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance and their sayings and doings depended on auto-\nsuggestion from the medium or on telepathic suggestions\nfrom the sitters, as Mrs. Sidgwick supposes, must therefore\nbe considered very small indeed.\nI do not want to give the impression that I accept all\ntlie characteristics of Charcot's well-known and much\ncriticized three states of hystero-hypnosis : the somnambulistic,\nthe cataleptic and the lethargic states. The important\npoint is whether, when hypnotising persons of a certain\nnervous type deeper and deeper, an inhibition of the\nmental and nervous functions, the brain and nerve centres\nrespectively, as well as a corresponding secondary enhance-\nment of other functions and centres, takes place in a\ncertain general order, independent of suggestions and auto-\nsuggestions, and whether these progressive alterations in the\nexcitability of the different parts and levels of the nervous\nsystem are in the main best accounted for by assuming\n\fxci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mecliumistic Trance 169\nthe existence of three distinct states. I am inclined to\nbelieve that this really is the case. It is, on the other\nhand, of minor importance whether the speciiic and con-\nstant characteristics of each stage were correctly appre-\nhended and described by Charcot, or not ; whether these\nstates represent hard and fast divisions or not ;\nwhether\nthey can be transformed into each other in all the ways\ndescribed by Charcot and his school, or not ; whether in\ncertain persons irregularities are to be found, dependent,\nperhaps, on nervous changes or ideas already existent in\nthe awake condition, or, perhaps, on different methods of\nhypnotization, etc. I have given a more extensive expose\nof my oi^inion of the nature of different hypnotic states\nthan I have been able to do here in my paper \" The\nPsychological Importance of Hypnotism \" (read before the\n7th Congress of Psychology, Oxford, 1923, and pubhshed in\nPsyche, 1923, p. 129-140).\nIVIi's.

Generally this snap occurred\ntwice, with a short interval between, before she completely\nrecovered her normal consciousness. {Proc, Vol. XXVIII.\np. 23.)\nMrs. Sidgwick imagines that the sensation is due to\nsome change in the flow of blood to the brain, and adds\nthat \" Mrs. Piper takes this view herseK, perhaps as the\nresult of a suggestion from some sitter.\" She said once :\n\" My head goes s-s-click. I think the blood settles back\nin my brain and then I am conscious.\"\nOnly quite lately I have been able to find an experience\nanalogous to ]Mrs. Piper's clicks. In a few articles Mr.\nOliver Fox (really Mr. Hugh G. Callawaj') has described\nexperiments in \" Dream-travelling.\" These are too com-\nplicated to be given here in full.^ I can only give certain\npoints in this paper. Mr. Callaway had been trying to\nprolong a certain kind of dream :\n\" Dreams of knowledge,\"\ni.e. dreams in which he had the knowledge that he was\ndreaming. He found that by exercising his will he could\nresist the \" attraction \" of the body and considerably\nprolong the dream. The effort, however, produced a\nslowly increasing pain in what he imagined to be the\nregion of the pineal gland. He made the experiment of\nfighting this pain. It then ceased quite suddenly and\nsomething seemed to \" click \" in his head. Upon this he\nappeared \"to be in the position of a permanently\ndisembodied spirit,\" i.e. \" out of the body.\" By will\npower he managed \" to return to his body,\" but the\nafter effects were bad. After this he found that when\nhe was in the iro\/?ce-condition he could \" leave the body \"\nby a sudden effort of will, and still later he found that the\n\" right \" method to do this was to will that his incorporate\nself should pass through the doorway of the pineal gland.\nWhen this was done the little click sounded in his brain.\n1 See The Occult Review, 1920, pp. 190 and 251, and 1923, p. 332.\n\fxci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mednimistic Trance 171\nWhen this method was -used there was no restrictmg:\n\" pineal \" pain as before, no break in consciousness, no\ndifficulty in \" re-entering the body \" when he wished.\nMr. Callaway puts forward the theory that when\n\" dreams of knowledge \" take place, a third state of con-\nsciousness is the result, and he adds : \"To prove that\nthe soul actually leaves the body is practically impossible,\nfor the experience may be purely subjective.\" Still he\nconsiders that, to his ow7i satisfaction, he has proved the\n\" existence of his soul.\"\nIn a letter to me Mr. Callaway Avrites that he has\nnever read any detailed account of Mrs. Piper's trances,\nthough her name was, of course, known to him.\nIt would, of course, be wrong to attach much import-\nance to a single person's experiences of this kind. But it\ncertainly is rather curious, that in the . only case besides\nMrs. Piper's\u2014known to me, at least,\u2014where such clicks in\nthe brain can be produced quasi-experimentally, they\nshould occur just at that point or moment when the\nexperimenter feels and considers himseh to have \" left the\nbody \"\n\u2014whatever this may mean ^\n\u2014diiring a trance\ncondition.\nThere is another experience of Mr. Callaway's which\nreminds me of one of Mrs. Piper's.\nOnce, when coming to and after the head-snap, Mrs. Piper\nsaid : \"I want to tell you the strangest thing. I had\ntwo distinct pairs of eyes. I used the one pair behind\nthe other and looked through these eyes (touching her\nown) as if they were spectacles. They looked like marbles . .\n.\nAnd Mr. Hodgson, when I saw you first ifc was through\nthe other pair of eyes and you didn't look as you do\nnow.\" (Just before she had said that she had two\ndistinct brains ...\" one looks like sulphur burning, the\notlier like flesh\") {Proc, Vol. XXVIII, p. 222).\nMr. Callaway relates that when in a certain experiment\nhe \" concentrated \" on its preliminary stages, he felt a\ngeneral numbness, his whole body stiffened and his eyes\n1 As to the nature of Mr. Callaway's experiences and his own reasons\nfor considering himself to have been out of his bodj^ see Mr. Callaway's\narticles.\n\f172 Dr. Sydney Alrutz [part\nclosed tightly {The Occult Review, 1923, p. 336). Then\ncame the sensation of possessing another pair of eyes, and\nthese \" astral eyes \" he opened. As he did this he\nseemed to turn right round within his physical body, so\nthat he faced the other direction, etc.\nWhat this felt duplication of eyes (and brain) really\nmeans is difficult to decide. Still, the coincidence between\nMrs. Piper's and IMr. Callaway's experiences deserves to be\nnoted, and investigators ought to be on the look-out for\nsimilar observations in the future.\nMrs. Leonard.\nI now intend to give as a further example of the\nmediumistic trance the case of the well-known medium\nMrs. Osborne Leonard, because she is still in full activity,\nand it is therefore probably quite possible to get a\nthorough examination of her different trance or hypnotic\nstages from a purely psychological and neurological point\nof view, which hitherto has not been done.\nThis medium presents, according to Una, Lady Trou-\nbridge (Proc, S.P.R. Vol. XXXII. , p. 349), first of all^ a\ncondition, characterised by a slight drowsiness, productive\nof automatic script, which has proved on several occasions\nto convey accurate knowledge of events unknown to the\nmedium. Lady Troul)ridge asks if we iftay see in this\ncondition a relatively light hypnosis not followed by any\namnesia.\nMrs. Leonard further presents a partially analgesic trance,\nin which she appears to be somewhat hyperaesthetic of\nhearing. In the trance she shows the characteristics of a\npersonality quite foreign to her waking self. This is the\npersonality known as Feda. Also in this state Mrs.\nLeonard gives evidence of supernormal knowledge. Lady\nTroubridge believes this state to be a lower hypnotic\nlevel than the former one, a deep somnambulism. I wish to\nsay that the hyperaesthesia of hearing seems to me in\nthis case certain only for the time which precedes a sitting,\ni.e. when hypnosis is coming on. and is then quite what\nwe should expect. This hyperaesthesia consequently does\n\fxci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mediumistic Trance 173\nnot ill an}^ way preclude the trance itself being a. deep\ncondition. A,s to the analgesia I should like to know\nwhat is really meant by partially or \"to some great\nextent \" anaesthetic and analgesic.\nFmally comes another trance condition, in which\naccording to I^ady Tronbridge IN'Irs. Leonard reproduces\nthe vocal characteristics and mannerisms of deceased\npersons of both sexes, who were never known to her\nduring their lives. In this state the motor faculties are\nlargely in abeyance. Whereas Feda can easily move\nabout and talk loudly, these so-called personal controls\nhave, as Lady Troubridge expresses it, very limited\ncommand of the organism as regards motion and vocal\nenergy (p. 362). Mrs. Leonard lies like a log against the\nchair, and therefore seems to have lost her muscular tonus\nto a great extent. The arrival so to say of a personal\ncontrol is announced by a long, sometimes very long, and\nsteady exhalation of breath, whereas Peda's arrival is\nonly heralded by a few moments of mere quiescence\n(p. 365). At least one personal control shows a pronounced\nhyperaesthesia of touch affecting the fingers. The personal\ncontrols can only be mamtained for a short time. On\naccount of this and other features (the power of mental\nconcentration is for instance weakened), Lady Troubridge\nbeheves that this condition is possibly yet another and\nstill lower hypnotic level.\nLater, on account of Mi'. Irving's letter {Journal, 1922,\np. 266), Lady Troubridge emphasises the circumstance\nthat the personal controls have access to the Feda material,\nwhereas Feda has only a very fragmentary and occasional\nknowledge of the personal control material. This, however,\nwe might regard, writes Lady Troubridge, as some unusual\nand momentary shiftmg of the levels, which gives Feda,\nfor an instant only, access to material which is generally\noutside her purview and which might be acquired\ntelepathically by her durmg the periods when she herself\ngoverns the organism (p. 291). This superiority in the\nfield of knowledge on the part of the personal controls\nwould then be another point in favour of regarding them\nas representing a still deeper hypnotic level then Feda.\n\fi74 Dr. Sydney Alruiz . [part\nI should like to accentuate the desirability of distinguish-\ning here more exactly between two things. On the one\nhand the condition of Mrs. Leonard's organism during the\nemergence of Feda or the personal controls, i.e. the trance\nstate per se ; on the other hand the psycho-physiological\nnature of these personalities themselves.^ But can such\na division be made ? How can we know what belongs\nto the one and what to the other ? Three points seem\nable to help us here : (1) our general knowledge of pure\n(hystero-) hypnotic states ; (2) our knowledge of the nature\nof Mrs. Leonard's condition immediately before and after\nthe emergence of the personalities ; (3) the circumstances\nthat these different outbursts apparently form coherent\norganic unities, of which certain utterances, movements, etc.,\nare integral parts.\nTo begin with the personal controls. It seems from the\ndescription given by Lady Troubridge as i\u00a3 there existed a\nspecial nervous condition, which precedes the trance per se,\nruns through this and also succeeds it for about a minute.\nI admit, however, that the data for this assertion are\nrather poor. In the case of Mrs. Piper they are much\nstronger. Still it seems as if there exists such a condition\nalso here, and that this is a state corresponding to a very\ndeep stage in (hystero-) hypnosis (the lethargic stage).\nDuring this condition a partial restitution or revivification\nof certain functions for an unknown reason takes place in\nthe form of speech (usually very weak), movements (very\nlimited), increase of muscular tone (hardly sufficient to\nkeep the vertebral column erect), and in one case hyper-\naesthesia (of fingers). Of these, speech seems to be the\nonly restitution which necessarily belongs to or expresses\nthe mental activity behind. Regarding the other symptoms\nthis connection is not quite clear, at least as far as Lady\nTroubridge's information goes. They probably, however,\nalso belong to these personalities, as they occur simul-\n1 Lady Trovibridge herself in her first paper {S.P.R. Proc. Vol. XXXII.) writes\nof the possibility of the different trance conditions being different hypnotic\nlevels (p. 361). Then Mr. Irving writes about the personal controls being\nthis, and finallj. Lady Troubridge in lier reply writes that her suggestion\nwas that these controls represent a deeper hypnotic level.\n\fxci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mediumistic Trance 175\ntaneously with their utterances.^ But even if this is so, they\nmay be only secondary and irradiative eifects of the resti-\ntution of speecli and its corresponding nervous apparatuses.\nAs to the personal controls themselves, I think there is\nvery little evidence that these \" entities \" as such represent\nor constitute a still deeper hypnotic level than Feda.\nEven assuming Lady Troubridge to be in the right as to\ntheir wider memory-range, I do not think that this is any\nevidence in this respect. And for this reason, that they\nare not really the inner side of coinjyhte hypnotic states,\nbut oiily\u2014at the best\u2014partial restitutions of such states.\nOnly of the former has it been assumed, with more or less\nreason, that the deeper the hypnosis the more com-\nprehensive the memory-range.^ Further : if we accept\ntelepathy as an explanation of Feda's incidental knowledge\nof a personal control, why shouldn't telepathy also be able\nto work the other way ?\nThe weakness, short duration and incompleteness of the\npersonal controls in comparison to that of Feda might very\neasily be explained by the circumstance that Feda\nobviously \" emerges \" from a lighter hypnotic state, where\nthe resistance to be overcome is less than in the lethargic\nstate, while the restitution, apparently brought about in\nsome way by the personal controls, demands a greater\noutput of energy.\nIn conclusion : all we can say is that the manifestation\nof the personal controls takes place in a state of trance or\nauto-hypnosis probably much deeper than the state from\nwhich Feda emerges. As to the personaUties themselves,\nit is of very little use comparing them to hypnotic levels\nor egos at all, much less considering them to he such\n^ Note here Lady Troubridge's observation, that the sitter must be on\nthe alert to catch Mrs. Leonard's body as the personal control comes to\nan end (p. 366). May I ask a question : Who complains of the hyperaes-\nthesia of the fingers as being \" actually distressful \" ? And does this\nsensitiveness serve any purpose ?\n^ There exists, however, no proof that Prof. Morton Prince in the case\nof Miss Beauchamp had hypnotised B2 deeper than usual on the first\noccasion B3 appeared. B3 had, however, a wider memory-range than B2.\nAnd can we also in other cases be certain at \\^'hat \" level \" a \" person-\nality \" is formed ?\n\f176 Dr. Sydney Alrutz [part xc\nlevels. The mental life of the personal controls is not\ninferior, seemingly, to that of Feda, whereas the deepest\n(hystero-) hypnotic stage (the lethargic one) generally\nshows much less mental activity, if any at all, than the\nlighter ones\u2014imless complications exist. As to the memory-\nrange, I should like to ask Lady Troubridge a question\nor two. Is there not, to begin with, some evidence of\nFeda's knowing the contents of the minds of the personal\ncontrols from the circumstance that Feda, at least on the\nface of it, transmits the thoughts of the personal controls,\nfor instance of A. V. B. 1 Now, seeing that, according to\nLady Troubridge, Feda generally has no knowledge of\npersonal control material, whereby no doubt is meant the\nutterances of a personal control when really controlling, i.e.\nwhen influencing Mrs. Leonard without intervention from\nanother source, the question arises : is there any evidence\nthat the thoughts of a certain personal control, say of\nA. V. B., which Feda transmits, and the utterances of A. V. B.\nas a personal control, really belong to each other or to a\ncommon personal source ? If there is such evidence,\nwould not this then show that Feda at times really does\nget at the minds of what we call the personal controls ?\nWhen using the expression \" restitution \" of Mrs.\nLeonard's organism, I do not of course mean that the\nwhole thing is explained by such a process. I can locally\nor partially restitute a subject in deep hypnosis by simply\nholding my hand above his : the sensibility returns then at\nthis place (on the hand). I can also by upward passes\nover one arm, again, as in the former case, without\ncontact, e.g. through a sheet of glass, and taking as before\nevery precaution so that the subject cannot Imow or\nsuspect what I am doing, restore the sensibility, etc., on\nthat half of the body. That is not, however, a complete\nanalogy to what occurs in Mrs. Leonard's case, when a\npersonal control comes on. But if we suppose that in some\nsuch way, by nervous effluence or otherwise, I could first\nrestore Mrs. Leonard's vocal organs, peripheral and central,\nand then by the help of telepathy make these restored\nparts of Mrs. Leonard's organism talk and give utterance\nto my thoughts\u2014then we should have, I believe, a process\n\fxci.] Mechanism of So-Called Medhimistic Trance 177\nwhich at least could be compared to what seems to take\nplace when a personal control manifests.\nOther Mediums.\nI lately examined (at the British College for Psychic\nScience) a young man who put himself into an apparent\ntrance without any help from anybody present, and who\nin this state manifested at least two different trance-person-\nalities. There was a very great difference in the easiness\nwith which the knee-jerk reflexes could be evoked in the\nawake condition, and the difficulty, not to say impossibility,\nwith which they could be shown to exist at all in the\ntrance state. And when the subject was awakening from\nthe trance state the returning of the knee-jerk reflex by\ndegrees could be very nicely observed. This was also\nconfirmed by a medical man present. There were also\ninteresting alterations in the sensibility. These changes\ngave me the conviction that no shamming of the trance-\nstate as such occurred in this case, and also that the\ntrance-state in question involved a deep-reaching inhibition\nof the excitability of the nervous system (as far as\nthe spmal cord). I was prevented from making further\nexaminations, but what I have put forward may be enough\nto show once more the importance of always making a\nneurological examination in such cases, if possible.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle ^ has made some observations\nwhich show the importance of studying . the pulse-rate in\ntrance. He found that a medium, Mr. Tickner, showed\nremarkable variations in this respect. Before and after\na certain sitting the pulse rate was 78 per minute, but\nduring trance and when a certain \" personality \" manifested\nit showed 124 (for about twenty minutes running), and\nwhen another \" personahty \" came on the scene it showed\n100. Sir Arthur writes with much reason that it may be\nthat we have an exceUent check against fraud in these\npulse-variations. I should like to add that they may\nalso aid us in understanding the mechanism of the trance-\ncondition and the restitutions taking place there.\n1\" Pulse-rate in Trance.\" Jour, of the Am. S.P.R., July 1923, p. 374.\n\f178 Dr. Sydney Alrutz [part\nI once registered the respiration and pulse of a gentleman\nwho claimed that he could \" leave his body,\" and who,\nin order to do this, sent himseK into a trance. No\nreactions followed in this state on stimulation of the skin\nsenses, the knee-jerk reflex was absent, etc. During the\ntrance I held a sharp-smelling liquid under his nostrils ;\nno reactions ensued, excepting a flattening out of the\nrespiration-curves for about 20 seconds. When, however,\nthe subject commenced the deep respiration which he\nusually employed in order to \" bring himseK back,\" and\nhad made two inspirations and expirations, he very\nsuddenly began to sneeze and complained of a sharp and\nnasty smell. This seems to me good evidence of the\nabsence of the sense of smell during the trance-state.\nThe phenomenon itself can be interpreted in two ways :\neither there remained enough smelling-particles in the\nnostrils to prodiice the reaction when the olfactory organ\nhad regamed its sensitiveness, or an excitation of the\nolfactory nerve and tract occurred already during trance,\nbut could not lead to a result because of the lessened\nexcitability of the corresponding centres in that state.\nThe Method of the Psycho-Galvanic Reflex.\nMr. Whately Smitli has put forward the idea {Proc.\nS.P.B., Vol. XXXT., p. 401) that these problems might be\nelucidated with the help of the phenomenon known as\nthe psycho-galvanic reflex, already inaugurated by Prince\nand Peterson for this purpose.\nThere seems to exist a difficulty here, which Mr. Whafcely\nSmith in my opinion undervalues. I mean the loss of\nsensibility which encounters us in most trances or deep\nhypnotic istates. Also hyperaesthesia may obtain here, at\nleast locally, as we have seen, and probably as a sign of\nrestitution. In light hypnosis we also often meet hjrper-\naesthesia, mostly I should think as a secondary symptom.\nMr. Whately Smith observes, however (p. 409, note), that\nin cases of functional anaesthesia in connection with\ndissociation the subject will re-act just as well on the\nanaesthesic areas as on the normally sensitive ones. But\n\fxci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mednmiistic Trance 179\nthe possibility, not to say the probability, exists here\nthat functional disturbances of sensibihty may occur which\ndo not depend\u2014or do not depend solely\u2014on dissociation,\nand that in such cases the disturbances may involve\nchanges in the excitability even of the periplieral sensitive\nnerves or nerve-organs. This is far from improbable,\nbecause such changes can be shown to exist in regard to\nmotor peripheral nerves in the deep hyjmosis of certain\nsubjects. The electric kritabihty of such nerves has in\npoint of fact been found to be considerably lessened in\nsuch a state (see my article \" Problems of Hypnotism,\"\nProc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXII., 1921, p. 169). On the other\nhand this irritability has been found to be increased ui\ncertain other hypnotic states, and Krafft-Ebuig found that\nsuch an enhancement could be observed as a result of\nparalysis by suggestion {Eine experimenteUe Studie auf dem\nGebiete des Hypnotismus, 3rd ed., 1893, p. 62). We must\ntherefore reckon with the possibiUty that functional\nanaesthesia may also mean a decrease of nervous excit-\nability stretching down as far as to the periphery. And this\nform of anaesthesia ought certainly to affect the psycho-\ngalvanic reflexes.\nIn such circumstances it would seem to be far the\nbest thing to begui the study of the psycho-galvanic\nreflex-phenomena on different forms of hjrpnosis, for\ninstance, on hypnosis with hemilateral changes, and,\nperhaps most important of aU, on forms where the anaes-\nthesia has been produced by suggestion, or by passes, or\nby the deep hypnosis itself. When all this has been\ncleared up the time may be ripe to attack the \" big\nproblem \" proposed by Mr. Whately Smith.\nI have entered rather deeply mto this question, because\n1 am of the opinion that the psycho-galvanic reflex really\nis an important method for our purpose, and because\nProfessor Veraguth himself, the uiventor of the method,\nproposed to me some time ago to use it in order to\nexamine if the changes in the sensibihty brought about\nby passes are of a peripheral nature or not. I have not\nyet, however, had the opportunity to do this. I hope now\nthat Mr. Whately Smith, with his large experience of how\nM\n\f180 Dr. Sydney Alrutz [part\nthis method works, will devote some of his time and\ninterest to the application of it to the important neuro-\nlogical problems which I have put forward and discussed\nhere.\nConclusion.\nI hope that what I have advanced in this paper justifies\nthe following assertion. If we have comjjlete and clearly\nformulated examinations of how a medium behaves and\nreacts in different states to questions and suggestions, how\nhis or her senses, pulse, respiration and reflexes function,\netc., we can with much greater confidence decide to what\nhypnotic level a certain trance condition per se corresponds,\nand consequently also what sort of mental activity the\nmedium himself in such a condition is capable of, e.g. if\nhe is suggestible or not, and also what kind of suggesti-\nbility exists. And we might also be able to decide if\nthe trance condition is of a kind which permits the\nreceiving of real telepathic impressions or not.\nFurthermore, when we encounter trance states where\ncertain curious upheavals or restitutions occur which\nsometimes seem to form a \" personality \" of some kind or\nother, if we then examine also these personalities not only\nfrom a psychological but also from a neurological point\nof view, we shall be able to distinguish better between\nthe medium's \" own \" states and the foreign ones, and\nconsequently be in a more favourable position to judge of\nthe origin and nature of the latter.\n\fXCI.\nI\nMethod of Scoring Coincidences .181\nA METHOD OF SCORING COINCIDENCES IN\nTESTS WITH PLAYING CARDS.\nBy R. a. Fisher, M.A.,\nFellow of Gonville and Cains College, Cambridge : Chief Statistician,\nRothamsted Experimental Station.\nThe problem of scoring a series of possible events so as to\nmeasure appropriately the degree of success attained in\neach trial seems to He on the borderline between the\npurely deductive region of mathematical probability and\nthe region of arbitrary choice. The particular problem in\nrespect of which this note is written serves to illustrate\nwhat abstract principles are available in arriving at a\nrational system of scormg, and may be of use in dealuig\nwith more complex cases.\nIf two playing cards are obtained from different packs,\nthe maximum degree of success is clearly obtained if they\nare corresponding cards of the same suit ;\nbut, short of\nthis we shall have obtamed some degree of resemblance if\nthe cards are either corresponding cards of different suits\nor if they are of the same suit. A lower degree of success,\nbut still one which is worth counting, will have been\nattained if the two cards are of the same rank (both\nplain or both picture cards), or even if they are of the\nsame colour. There are in fact nine possibilities, to each\nof which we need assign an appropriate score, and these\nwiU be represented as follows :\n00 No resemblance, a j^lain card and a picture card of\ndifferent colours.\nCO A plain card and a picture card of the same colour, but\nof different suits.\nSO A plain card and a picture card of the same suit.\nOR Both plain or both picture cards of different colours.\n\f182 R. A. Fisher [PAET\nCR Both plain or both picture cards of the same colour,\nbut of different suits.\nSR Both plain or both picture cards of the same suit.\nON Corresponding cards of different colours.\nCN Corresponding cards of the same colour, but of different\nsiiits. \\\nSN Corresponding cards of the same suit.\nIf the cards are both plain or both picture cards we\nmay speak of them as having the same rank ; if they are\ncorresponding cards we may speak of them as having the\nsame value, using this term to include the distinction\nbetween Knave, Queen and King.\nThere are certain conditions respecting the order of tht,\nclasses, which any satisfactory system of scoring musi\nsatisfy. It is evident that each S class must score more\nthan the corresponding C class, and still more than the\ncorresponding 0 class ;\nequally each N class must score\nmore than the corresponding R class, and still more than\nthe corresponding 0 class. These fundamental conditions\nmay be represented in the following diagram, in whic^ ^\nthe arrows point, in each case from a class with the lowe.\nto a class with tlie higher score :\n^OR .\n^CN i\n00\" 'CR 'SN\n\"'CO\"'' \"'SR^'\n^so-^\nThese conditions as to the order of the scores still\nleave much latitude as to the actual scores to be assigned\nto each class. In order to proceed further it is necessary\nto take account of the relative rarity, upon purely random\nconditions, of the several possible classes.\nA circimistance which gives a clue to a rational system\nof scoring is that in every one of the three groups 0,\nR and N, the class S differs from the class C in being\nright instead of wrong on an even chance ;\nfor, given that\nthe cards are of the same colour, it is an even chance\nthat they wiJl also be of the same suit, consequently the\n\fAET\nour,\nxci.] Method of Scoring Coincidences 183\ndifference iu score between SO and CO, should be the\nsame as the difference in score between SR and CR, and\nthe same as the difference between SN and CN. Also\neach C class differs from the corresponding 0 class in\nbeing right instead of wrong on an even chance, and we\nmay, i\u00a3 not as a logical necessity, at least as a rational\nconvention, postulate that each C class shall exceed the\ncorresponding 0 class in score by as much as it is exceeded\nby the corresponding S class. If the difference in score\nbetween each of these 6 paks of classes be x units, evi-\ndently each S class will exceed the corresponding 0 class\nby 2x xmits.\n. There is, I think, only one rational generalisation of\nthis rule, namely, that if the best class of a group of\nclasses occurs in random samples of that group once in\nn trials, then its score differs from the lowest score in the\ngroup by a quantity proportional to the logarithm of 7i.\nIf we accept this rule the determination of the relative\nscores in the R and ISl classes becomes purely a problem\nprobabihty ; the cards wUl be of the same rank 109\n.jiimes in 169 random samples, and of these 13 give the\nsame value ; the differences between the nine classes wiU\ntherefore be proportional to the following\n:\nC = log 2= -3010300\nS=2C = -6020600\nB=logi^= -1904602\n109\nN = log 13 = 1-1139434;\ngiving the following 9 scores :\n-0 -R -X\nO- 0 -1904602 1-1139434\nC- -3010300 -4914902 1-4149734\nS- -6020600 -7925202 1-7160034.\nIt is a matter of indifference to the principle upon\nwhich these values ^^\u2022ere obtained, and to our actual\nconclusions from any experiment, if these scores are\naltered either by adcUng any constant value to all the\nscores, or by multiplying them by any factor, or by both\n\f184 B. A. Fisher [PAET\nprocesses. Their application to practical tests will, however,\nrequire comparison to be made with the mean value, and\nwith the standard deviation. To simplify these applications\nit will probably be most convenient to bring the mean\nvalue to zero, so that in any experiment the observed\nmean score shall measure the actual deviation from the\nmean to be expected upon purely random conditions.\nIt will also be convenient to make the standard deviation\nto take some simple value, such as 10, in order to facili-\ntate tests of whether the observed deviation from expecta-\ntion is really significant of something more thaii chance.\nIf we do this the following scores are obtained :\n-0 -R -N\n0- -11-18 -6-11 + 18-50\nC- - 3-16 + 1-91 + 26-53\ns- + 4-86 + 9-94 + 34-55.\nUsing these scores the statistical significance of a series\nof observations may be tested by calculating the average\nscore, and comparing it to its standard error 10\/Jn,\nwhere n is the number of observations averaged.\nTo illustrate this test I am indebted to Dr. V. J.\nWoolley for the following results of 49 cards drawings\nunder approximately random conditions ; the numbers of\noccurrences in each class were\n-0 -R -N\n0- 10 18 1\nc- 1 C) 2\ns- 3 7 1\nThe total score on the above system is -31-21, from\nwhich the mean score is -0-64; the square root of 49 is 7,\nso that the standard error is 10\/7 = 1-43. The mean score\nis thus, in this case, negative, and distinctly less than the\nstandard error. In all cases where the mean score is less\nthan twice its standard error it is unsafe to argue that\nany cause other than pure chance is required to produce\nthe observed deviation from expectation.\nSome error is necessarily introduced by using a limited\nnumber of decimal places. If we use two places, as above,\n\fXCI.] Method of Scoring Coincidences 185\nthe scoring appears to be sufficiently accurate for dealing\nwith samples up to a hundred million ; if we cut off the\nlast place the bias begins to show at about 17,000.\nVery little labour is, however, saved by excluding the\nextra figure, and if we retain it the error is quite negligible\neven if a large body of data is compiled on this system\nfrom different sources.\nSummary.\nTo each guess is allotted one of the following scores :\nNothing correct- ...... -11-18\nRank {i.e. plain or picture) correct, but\nnothing else - - - - - - - 6-11\nColour correct, but nothing else - - - - 3-16\nColour and rank correct - - - - - +1-91\nSuit correct, but nothing else - - - - + 4'86\nSuit and rank correct - - - - - + 9-94\nValue correct, but colour wrong - - - + 18-50\nValue and colour correct, but suit wrong - +26'53\nValue and suit correct ..... +34-55\nIf the average score of n guesses is greater than twice\n~j- we are jastified in assuming that the guesses are\nmore accurate than we should expect them to be if they\nwere due entirely to chance.\n\f186 Eleanor Mildred SidgivicJc [part\nREVIEWS.\nThe \" Oscar Wilde \" Script.\nI.

F.\"\n{Psycltic Science for January, 1924.)\nI SHALL refer to the above-mentioned book and articles in what\nfollows as I., II., and III. The \" messages \" with which they are\nconcerned came through Mx. V. by automatic writing, or Mrs.\nTravers Smith by an ouija-board, and all between June 8 and\nOctober 8, 1923, except that Mrs. Travers Smith has included in\nher book two fragments of later date (Dec. 14, 1923, and January\n4, 1924). The majority of them have been published from time\nto time in newspapers and periodicals, and have excited con-\nsiderable interest. But this scattered pubUcation does not afford\na convenient means of studying them, and aU serious students\nof automatism will welcome both Mrs. Travers Smith's book,\nbringing together a number of the scrii^ts, and the very valuable\ndiscussion of Mi\\ V.'s script by his brother. For there is no\ndoubt that these communications, some twenty-five in number\nand generally of considerable length, professing to come from Oscar\nWilde, suggesting his style throughout and (in the automatic\nscrij^t) his handwriting, and also mentionmg a few true\nincidents in his life of which the automatists had no conscious\nknowledge\u2014there is no doubt that these communications form\nan addition to our knowledge of automatism which no one\nstudying the subject can afford to neglect. But when we\nexamine them m detail, and especially when we look for the source\nof the inspiration\u2014the mmd directing the script\u2014and ask e.g.\n\fXCI.] Reviews 187\nif Oscar Wilde was really concerned, many difficulties present\nthemselves. No hypothesis so far formulated is without them,\nand the scripts raise problems rather than solve them.\nBefore describing the development of the communications\nit may be well to point out that \" messages,\" though a con-\nvenient name for them, is perhaps a little misleading. For\nthere is no suggestion that Oscar Wilde had anything he wanted\nspecially to say except when attempting to give some reminis-\ncences which might afford evidence of identity (see especially\nI. pp. 65-67 and III. 320-323). For the rest the communications\nseem for the most part attempts to amuse and interest in\nOscar Wilde's manner by conversation or by short essays, both\nfull of Avitty or cynical epigrams, intentional exaggeration,\nquaint metaphors, and arresting turns of phrase.\nAs I have said, two automatists were concerned in the pro-\nduction of these scripts, and on the first appearance of \" Oscar\nWilde \" they were workmg together. Neither, however, had\nany special interest in Wilde, nor are they aware of anything\nhaving occurred to recall his memory, and neither was well read\nin Wilde's witings, though Mrs. Travers Smith had read more\nthan Mr. V. Mr. V., wishuig if possible to develop a power of\nautomatic writing, had jomed a class held by Mi's. Travers\nSmith for the purpose. After two blank sittings his hand\nwrote a few words purportmg to come from a deceased friend,\nand, so far as they went, appropriate I understand. But they\ncame when Mrs. Travers Smith's hand rested lightly oh his,\nand without partnership of this sort he has practically not\nsucceeded in obtaming automatic writing at all\u2014his pencil\nmerely taps the paper. Nor can any one taken at random\nserve as a partner. Mr. V. has tried with a good many in\nvain, but in the scripts before us three ladies besides Mrs.\nTravers Smith have at different times successfully given the\nnecessary help by placing hand or fingers on his wrist. One\nquestion that arises is, m what way does this partner influence\nthe writing 1 Does she merely facilitate it by increasmg Mr.\nV.'s confidence and thus perhaps breaking down some inhibition,\nor is it a case of joint automatism ? Does the partner's mind\nsubconsciously operate jointly with Mr. V.'s, or at least serve\njomtly with his as a chamiel of communication ? It must be\nremembered that Mr. V. writes with his eyes shut, and is not\n\f188 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwich [part\naware at the moment of what is bemg written except perhaps\na word now and then.^ In fact he finds it advantageous to\nconcentrate his mind on something unconnected with the work\nin hand\u2014such as a calculation or mathematical question. The\npartner on the other hand follows the writmg\u2014or at least\nMrs. Travers Smith does.^\nAt the next sitting they had the same deceased friend began,\n\" I want my daughter Lily, my little Lily,\" when at the word\nhly anotlier communicator mtervened with the words, \" No\nthe lily is mine not his \" and a soi disant Oscar Wilde made\nhis first app.earance and took possession of the script. It is\nnot unnatural that \" lily \" should suggest Oscar Wilde to any\none who remembers the aesthetic movement Avith which he was\nso much identified in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,\nand the caricatures of it by Punch and Gilbert and Sullivan, etc.\nBut did it merely suggest hioi to the subliminal consciousness\nof the automatist, or did the suggestion give Oscar Wilde\nhimself the opjjortunity of coming in ?\nThe script on that day (June 8th) proceeded in a style and\nhandwriting both of which more or less resembled Oscar Wilde's,\nand contamed sentences if not exactly quoted from, at any\nrate strongly reminiscent of, sentences in his writings. One of\nthese apparently came from a work Intentions which JVIr. V.\nhad not read but which Mrs. Travers Smith had. On the other\nhand there is a sentence almost exactly reproducing one in a\nletter of Mr. V.'s own\u2014a letter descriptive of scenery\u2014which he\nhad written some eight years previously, and which was recalled\nto the memory of his correspondent and unearthed in con-\nsequence of the pubUcation of this script (see III. p. 314).\nThis must, one supposes, have come from Mr. V.'s mmd,\nthough he had no conscious recollection of it.\n1 On at least one occasion, however, Oct. 8th, 1923, when Miss Mac-\nGregor was his partner, he seems to have read the script during pauses\nand asked questions (see II. pp. 274-6).\n2 There is I think a difference, not easy to define, in tlie style of\ncommunications obtained with the aid of three of the partners. The\nfourth was Mrs. Travers Smith's daughter, who took her mother's place\nin the middle of a sitting, with the result that the writing became very\nlarge without other obvious change. For what is said in the scripts\nabout the relations of the two automatists, see below p. 194.\n\fXCI.] Revleivs 189\nTen days later Mr. V., again with Mi-s. Travers Smith's\nassistance, produced a second script which contamed, among\nother things, sarcastic remarks about the S.P.R. m Oscar Wilde's\nepigrammatic manner. The siibject was probably suggested\nby the presence of our Research Officer, Mr. Dmgwall. After\nthis, begmning from that evening,^ Mi-s. Travers Smith obtained\nfrequent \" Oscar Wilde \" communications by herself\u2014usmg an\nouija-board\u2014an instrument with which she is a very expert\nand rapid operator.\nThe general resemblance to Oscar Wilde's style is continued\nin the communications received by Mrs. Travers Smith alone,\nbut they tend to be less spontaneous and more conversatiojial,\nthe subject bemg often suggested to begin with by the auto-\nmatist and changed by questions interposed.\nMrs. Travers Smith's book, which I have numbered I. above,\ncontams most though not all the scripts produced by Mr. V.\nwith her as partner and a large number of the ouija-board\ncommunications received by her during the period in question.\nThese are followed by several chapters of analysis and dis-\ncussion, pleasantly written, and givmg a popular account of\narguments for and against various theories concernuig the\nintelhgence behmd the scripts.\nIn II. we have two long scripts produced by Mr. V. mth\nthe hand of Miss Helen MaoGregor (of the College of Psychic\nScience) on his. These are perhaps the most interesting\nscripts of the series. They are the most fully developed in\nKterary form, and they contain the most vivid and lurid\nimagery m then account of the communicator's \" sort of\namphibian \" life \"in the twihght of existences \" with \" a foot\nin either world \" but belonguig \" properly to neither.\" The\nexistence of the communicator in twihght is, it may be remarked,\nspoken of in several scripts, includmg the first, and is possil)ly\nreminiscent of Oscar Wilde's account of his prison hie. The\ntwo scripts in II. are accompanied by very interesting and\ncareful comment and discussion by Mr. V.'s brother.\nThis comment and discussion, but now covermg the whole of\nMr. V.'s script, is continued by his brother in III. This article,\n1 This date is an inference based on internal evidence. It does not\n,\nquite agree with the dates given in the book, but this is probably due\nto a misprint. There are several in the book.\n\f190 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick [part\nafter giving a list (with brief descriptions) of the scripts, is\ndivided into three sections. The first is a careful study of the\nhandwritmg, comj)aring it in detail with that of the living\nOscar Wilde. (Facsimiles of both are given.) There were\ndefinite resemblances in the first script of the series, but their\nnumber decidedly increased as time went on, becoming remark-\nably complete in the latest scri^Dts. This need not have\nsurj)rised us very much if Mr. V. had been familiar with the\nhandwriting, for to imitate (without cojiymg) a marked hand-\nwriting is apparently a not very difficult accomplishment even\nwhen the imitation is carried on through many pages.^ But\nthe puzzle here is that Mx. V. is not aware of having ever\nseen Oscar Wilde's handwriting before the first script was\nwritten, and he did not afterwards see any tiU all the scripts\nwere written except a \" Beheve me your sincere friend Oscar\nWilde \" which appeared m the Occult Review in August 1923\n\u2014\nthat is about the middle of Mr. V.'s scriptic activities (III.\np. 305). Mrs. Travers Smith was also ignorant of the handwriting\nwhen the first script came, but she made investigations, and\nat the Chelsea Book Club (I think between the first script and\nthe second) sav\/ \" a facsimile of Wilde's writing \" and \" an\nautograph letter of his \" which \" happened to be there for\nsale \" (I. p. 81). Whether the knowledge she had thus acquired\ninfluenced the scripts at aU we cannot tell. Nor of course is\nit possible to assert positively that\u2014though they do not Ue\nabout m every book shop\u2014^Mr. V. had never at some unknown\ndate himself accidentally come across an autograph letter of\nWilde's (or a reproduction of one) which, while making no\npermanent impression on his conscious mind, remained imprmted\non his subhminal memory. However this may be the hand-\nwriting remains a very curious and interesting problem.\nThe second section of III. (pp. 305-315) deals with Oscar\nWilde's style, and compares that of the scripts with it. Space\nforbids my going fully into this. I will only say that this\nsection will be found both interestmg and instructive. The\nauthor is evidentlj^ very familiar with Wilde's witings and a\nMr. V.'.s brotlier has shown this as regards Oscar Wilde's handwriting\nby experiments of Iiis own described in a letter to the Occult Review of\nMarch 1924. And I have known of similar success in an experiment\nwith another liandwriting many years ago.\n\fXCI.] Reviews 191\ngreat admixer of them, and his articles wOl I thinly convince the\nreader that there are many real Wildean traits in the script\nthough Little plagiarism after the first day. But, as we\nshould expect whether Oscar Wilde was himself concerned or\nnot, the imitation, though it improves, is not in Mr. V.'s\nbrother's opinion equally sustained throughout each script.\nRemarkably characteristic of Wilde ui parts it is not apparently\nunmixed Wilde. And as the exteiit to which style can be\nsuccessfully imitated is not only a matter about which opinions\ndiffer, but one which is essentially indefinite, we cannot I\nthink through style alone obtain conclusive evidence as to\norigin any more than we can through handwriting. This\nsection ends with a portion of the letter written by Mr. V.\nhimself in 191.5 to which I referred above, from which a phrase\nis plagiarised or at least repeated in the first script, and which\nshows a way of looking at scenery somewhat Wildean though\nno doubt c|uite unconsciously so.\nThe third section of III. concerns the subject matter of the\nscripts. It is pointed out that ideas and opinions are expressed\nin the scripts\u2014in some criticisms of modern authors for instance\u2014\nwhich are not Mr. V.'s ; and Mi's. Travers Smith says the same\nfor herself (see I. p. 110). Also that both by excess and\ndefect the general knowledge exhibited by the scripts does not\nappear to coincide with that of Oscar Wilde in his lifetime.\nWe find in the scripts for instance a knowledge of wild flowers,\nand again of the history of astronomy, both of which might\nwell have come from Ivlr. V.'s mind but of which there is no\nappearance in W^ilde's writmgs. On the other hand Oscar\nWilde was \" a very competent Greek scholar \" and \" often\nadorned his prose with quotations from the Classics \" while\nthe automatists knew but little of Greek. It accords with this\nthat no Greek quotations appear in the scripts, and that classical\nallusions, even though \" thoroughly characteristic of Wilde,\"\nseem to be all contained in The Iliad and The Odyssey, trans-\nlations of which Mr. V. had read. On July 13th the script\ngives a \" remarkabl}^ accurate reproduction of a passage \" from\nButcher and Lang's translation of The Iliad, read by Mr. V.\nsome years before. The script reads :\n\" On that wondrous\nshield forged by Hephaestos for Achilles, on which was depicted\nthe whole of the life of man in its joy and sorrow, we are told\n\f192 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick [part\nwas wrought '\nthe earth and the sea and the unwearyhig sun,\nthe Pleiads and the Hyads and (her ?) that men call the Bear\nwho watches Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of\nOcean.' \" The passage in Butcher and Lang, evidently the\nsource of this, runs :\n\" Then wrought he the earth and the\nheavens and the sea and the unwearying sun and the moon\nwaxing to the full and the Signs every one wherewith the\nheavens are crowned, pleiads and hyads and Orion's might,\nand the Bear that men call the Wain her that turneth in her\nplace and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths\nof Ocean.\" (See III. p. 316 and I. p. 59.)\nVarious allusions in the scripts are traced by his brother to\nknowledge stored in Mr. V.'s mind as their probable or possible\nsource, but space will not allow me to dwell on these. We\nmust proceed to incidents in Oscar Wilde's life to which the\nscripts refer.\nThe Oscar Wilde of the scripts, though he complained that\n\"it is so difficult to drag the past from memory's black cave,\"\ndid on July 20th (see I. pp. 05-67) \" descend for once into\nthe dull abyss of facts,\" and recounted some seven or eight\nalleged incidents in his life. Mr. V.'s brother has been at\nconsiderable pains to verify these, and has succeeded in doing so\nin the majority of cases. But it is in five or six different books,\nbiographies of Wilde and others, that the evidence is found,\nand with none of these was Mr. V. consciously acquainted.\nMore curious still, the way the incident is told in some cases\nsufficiently resembles the account in the book Avhich furnishes\nthe verification to suggest that the book was the actual source\nof the supposed memory. I will quote the strongest instance\nof this. The script says :\n\u2014\" Other memories . . . lunching with\nMargot Tennant, Mrs. Fox, Blunt, and others in London\u2014jioor\nAsquith was hke a fish out of water, I did most of the talliing\n\u2014\nand afterwards I told Margot stories\u2014stayed behind.\" In My\nDiaries, by Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, pp. 178-9, Mr. V.'s brother\nfinds the following entry (III. p. 322) \" 17th July. A brilhant\nluncheon with Margot and her husband at 30 Upper Grosvenor\nStreet . . . The other guests were Mrs. Grenfell, Mrs. Daisy\nWhite, Ribblesdale, his brother Reggie Lister and Oscar Wilde.\nAll immensely talkative, so that it Avas almost like a breakfast\nin France. Asquith alone rather out of it. 1 sat next him\n\fXCI.] Reviews 193\nand was rather sorry for him, though he was probably happy\nenough. After the rest had gone away Oscar remained telling\nstories to me and Margot.\" There are two mistakes in the\nscript\u2014the lunch occurred after Miss Tennant's marriage to\nMr. Asquith and no Mrs. Fox appears to have been present.\nThe occurrence of the name Fox may possibly, a.s Mr. V.'s\nbrother pomts out, be due to confusion with another reminis-\ncence which had just been spoken of ui which that name\nshould have occurred but did not.\nOf course if documentary evidence of the reahty of an\nincident cannot be found, the chances of being able to verify it\nat this distance of time (Wilde died in 1900) would be rather\npoor. It would be Avise therefore in furnishing evidence of\nidentity to choose uacidents of which there are printed accounts.\nBut are we to suppose that Wilde himself knew where to look -\nin books pubhshed after his death for mcidents he could use ?\nOr is it possible that the subUminal consciousness of one of\nthe automatists put them together from then- o^^Tl subUminal\nstore of memories picked up from reviews, or conversation, or\nbooks casually glanced at, etc. ? Perhaps more light may yet\nbe obtamed on this cpaestion.\nBefore concluduig I will call attention to two curious con-\ntradictions or uiconsistencies in the Wilde communications which\ncome to light by comparmg those pubhshed in I. and in II.\nand which seem different from the kmd of confusion we might\nexpect owing to real communications passmg thi-ough the mmds\nof different automatists and being contaminated by them. The\nfirst inconsistency concerns the sensations experienced by \" Oscar\nWilde \" m entering the brain of living human beings.\nIn script of July 2nd (see I. pp. 17, 18), written by Mr. V.\nwith ]Virs. Travers Smith assisting, \" Oscar Wilde \" describes\nhow he has gazed thi'ough the eyes of others on the sights of\nthe world :\n\" Once on a pleasure steamer on its way to St.\n(Jloud I saw the green waters of the Seine and the hghts of\nParis, through the vision of a httle girl who clung weepmg to\nher mother and wondered why ... It may surprise you to learn\nthat in this way I have dipped into the works of your modern\nnovehsts. That is, I have not drawn the whole brew, but\ntasted the vintage.\"\nIn the evening of the same day through the ouija-board\u2014\n\f1\n194 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick [part\nMr. v., of coiirse, not present\n\u2014\" Oscar Wilde \" says (I. pp. 20,\n21): \"I will go on and tell you how I have wandered into the\nminds of the moderns, as you are pleased to call them. It\nis a rather entertainmg process. I watch for my opportunity,\nand Avhen the propitious moment comes I leap into their\nminds and gather rapidly these impressions, which are largely\ncollective.\"\nBut in the scripts of September and October given in II., in\nwhich Mrs. Travers Smith did not take part, the same process\nis spoken of in a much less light-hearted way. In these scripts\n\" Oscar Wilde \" seems to describe his existence as consisting\nlargely of successive brief occupation of different human\norganisms, and says :\n\" It is a strange thing, this birth\ninto a new brain. You may analyse it or dissect it as a\nscientific curiosity, but for us who hang in fearful poise twixt\nthe daylight and the dark it is an experience no less terrible\nthan strange, and one which repetition cannot rob of its terrors.\nBy some central mystery of existence Life's oldest pangs must\naccompany Life's newest creations \" (II. p. 271).\nThe second inconsistency concerns the share in the work of\nthe two automatists. At the ouija-board on June 18 (see I.\np. 13) \" Oscar Wilde \" was asked :\n\" Who did you communicate\nthrough at the sitting for automatic writing this afternoon ?\nThrough Mr. V., or through Mrs. Travers Smith ?\n\" He\nreplied :\n\" Through you dear lady. He is a tool. You are\nthe hght that lets me peep again into the world that seems so\ndazzling, now that the Divine Justice finds it His pleasure to\nkeep me m dim twihght.\"\nAnd again through the ouija-board on July 2 (see I. pp.\n21, 22) when asked :\n\" How do you manage when Mr. V. and\nI are together.\" He replies :\n\" I can control his hand, I can\nonly control your mind. Your hand is guided by your mind.\"\nAnd again on July 5th, when asked by Mrs. Travers Smith\nwhy he selected her as his medium, he gave an answer too\nlong to quote here, but in the course of it said (I. pp. 35, 36) :\n\" I tried many times to secure a vial for my ideas . . . But\nuntil the day when I seized the pencil from some unnoticeable\nbeing, who seemed to make an effort to press through the\nbrain of '\nthe tool '\nnever before had I found the exact quality\nI needed ... I can use the hand of the tool. . . . But his brainy\n\fXCI.] Reviews 195\ndoes not serve me. I cannot use it, for ideas would stick\nthere as flies do in a cloyed mass.\"\nWhat has been said in the course of this review about the\nuse in the scripts of material in Mr. V.'s mind is in itself a\nsufficient disproof of this account of the matter. But, farther,\nthese ouija-board statements are flatly contradicted in a script\nwritten by Mr. V. with Mrs. Travers Smith as his partner on\nJuly 20th, 1923. In a part of this script not included in Mrs.\nTravers Smith's book, but published in the Sunday Ex-press of\nAugust 5th, 1923, the following sentences occur and have\nbeen copied for me :\n\" Oscar Wilde ... It is through your\ntemperament that I am al)le to give my thoughts to tlie world.\nYou have that curious combination of the literary and scientific\ntemperament which creates a sort of psychic aftlruty with\nmyself. It is true that one of the ladies here supplies a\ncertain motive force\u2014just as an electric machine must have its\n'\nstarters '\nor whatever one may call them. But these are\nmerely the accessories and the accessories are not the machine.\nTlie machine I use is your human temperament. So please\nremember that there is only one Oscar Wdde and that you\nare his prophet.\"\nNor is this all, for it does not seem possible to reconcile\neither the ouija-board statements or the script .\njust quoted with\nthe following curious statements made in the script of October\n8th when Mr. V. wrote with Miss MacGregor as a partner (II.\np. 275). \" Oscar Wilde \" had been speaking of his experiences\nwhen attached to different brains, and Mr. V. asked :\n\" To whose\nbrain are you attached at present ? Ansicer : To your\nown. Question : How is it you are able to communicate\nthrough Mrs. Travers Smith if, as you say, you are imprisoned\nin my brain ? Answer : That is most probably another part\nof myself, a poor fellow-unfortunate who suffers even as I\nsuffer. Question' : What do you mean ? Surely there are not\ntwo Oscar Wildes ? Answer : Does that cause you to wonder ?\nYes, it reaUy is so. Quite possibly our name is legion. The\nsoul is no indivisible iinity, no solitary shadow seated in its\nhouse of sin. It is a thmg, highly complex, built up, layer\nupon layer . . ., etc.\"\nIt will be remembered that two of our ex-presidents in their\npresidential addresses\u2014Mr. Gerald Balfour in 1906 [Proceedings,\n\f19b Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick [part\nVol. XIX.), and Dr. McDoiigall in 1920 {Proceedings, Vol. XXXI.)\n\u2014suggested that we are in this world polypsychic beings, and\nMr. McDougall discussed this hypothesis in some detail. Mr.\nv., however, has no recollection of having read, or thought\nabout this hypothesis, and the subordinate personahties are\nnot I think conceived by either Mr. Balfour or Mr. McDougall\nas continuing after death a separate and independent existence\nin which they can masquerade as the dominant personality\nwliile they Uve in the hope of some day being reunited to it\nas the Oscar Wilde of the script of October 8th professes to do.\n\" I yearn,\" he says, \" to be united to my soul. Somewhen\nand somewhere I must surely meet my soul again. That is\nmy little taper of hope in infinite darkness.\"\nBut my paper is already too long, and I think I have said\nenough to justify what I remarked at the beginning, namely that\nthese scripts raise problems rather than solve them. For myself |\nI find it impossible to decide on the evidence before us whether\nit is most probable, or should we say least improbable, that\nwe have here to do with an extraordinarily full development of\nsubliminal power both as regards imagination, dramatisation\nand memory, or on the other hand with some distorted element\nof Oscar Wilde inspiring the scripts. Or, again, is it conceivable\nthat there is some kind of combination of the two. I believe\nthat Mr. V. and his brother are in the same attitude of\ncomplete suspense of judgment as myself, while Mrs. Travers\nSmith, if I understand her rightly, inclines to the spiritualistic\nhypothesis. But both those who feel able to come to a con-\nclusion and those who do not will agree that we have here an\nimportant addition to our knowledge of facts concerning\nautomatism.\nEleanor Mildred Sid o wick.\nProblems of Belief. By F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. \"Library\nof Philosophy and Religion.\" (Hodder & Stoughton.\n1924. Price 3s. 6d. net.)\nNo one can have followed, even sjooradically and unprofession-\nally, the controversies of the last forty years without perceiving\nthe crisis through which philosophy and religion are passing.\nThe questions raised are \" Can any philosophy be true t Is any\ni\n\fXCI.] Reviews 197\nreligion true '? \" and the answers seem to be in the negative to\nboth questions. Mr. Schiller, no doubt, would quarrel with this\nstatement and retort\n\u2014\" What do you mean by true ?\n\" involv-\ning one at once in the whole controversy about \" pragmatism.\"\nOn that ground, so far as it is a question of logic, he has\nnothing new to advance. But if a reader prefers to consider\nthe way in which men do, in fact, arrive at then- conclusions,\nhe will find this book full of interest. Sometimes the human\nmind will seem merely grotesque or mad, as in the account of\nJeremiah, the Indian chief, who conducted three times a day,\nfor a naked congregation, a service which consisted in repeating\nten times over the English alphabet and the numbers from one\nto ten. Sometimes it will a.ppear dishonest, sometimes confused,\nsometimes pitifully inadequate ;\nwith, always, that little lamp\nof what we call reason floating so desolately on so vast a sea\nof instmcts, desires, hopes, fears, passions, cupidities, necessities.\nAnd he will be a bold or an uiiimagmative man, Avho is not\nconstrained to say m the end : There, but for the Grace of\nGod, go I.\"\nThe analysis and classification of all this chaos of beliefs\nis a principal object and achievement of this little book.\nBut it has other piirposes. One, perhaps too promuient, is a\nfurther attack on those forms of ideahsm agamst which Mr.\nSchiller has so long been tilting. Possibly residence in Oxford\nhas made him exaggerate the importance of these would-\nbe rational philosophies. Perhaps too, in his controversial zeal,\nhe neglects the real qualities of some of the men he attacks.\nThe present reviewer, at any rate, when he thinks of Plato\nand Spinoza and even Hegel does not feel them to be the\nmerely ridiculous or dishonest figures that they are apt to\nappear in Mr. Schiller's polemics. That, no doubt, is because\nphilosophers of that kmd are also poets ; and one does not\nlaugh at or quarrel with Dante because one does not accept\nhis theology. But that by the way, for it is not, hi this book,\nthe important pomt.\nThe important point is Mr. SchiUer's insistence on the real\ncharacter of the beliefs that may claim to be scientific ; how\nrelative, how tentative, how modest they are, m the minds of\ntheir best exponents. And since it is here, if anywhere, that\nthe possibility of human progress lies, the service done is a\n\f108 Cr. Lowes Dickinson [part\nreal one. Science has to steer its way betAveen credulity and\nscepticism ; and how arduous that tasit is those l^est know who\nhave tried to perforin it.\nPerhajjs the most important of Mr. Schiller's points is the\none he makes about the connection of belief with action.\nCan you be said, really, to believe anything, unless you are\nprepared to act upon it ? Broadly, and admitting qualifica-\ntions, Mr. Schiller says \" No.\" And certainly for the truths\nof morals, action is a real and searching test, the candid\napplication of which must make most of us feel uncomfortable.\nMoral genius implies the power of living the beliefs that\nare professed. But it implies also that the beliefs shall be\n\" true.\" In what sense ? Mr. Schiller would like to reply,\nand does in great part reply, in the sense that they tend to\nsurvival. Clearly, however, they do not tend to the survival\nof the genius who propounds them ; or Socrates would not\nhave been heralocked, nor Jesus crucified. It may be said,\nhowever, that they tend to stu vive in others ;\nand, if not, they\nare false. But something hi us certainly rebels against this\ndoctrine. We remember \" si fractus illabatur orbis, Impavidum\nferient ruinae \" ; whicli brings one quickly to the question of\no])timism and pessimism ; for it is optimism that assumes\nthat the true valuations survive, and pessimism that holds the\ncontrary. This question of ojitimism and pessimism Mi'.\nSchiller discusses ;\nconcluding apparently that it is an open\nquestion, and that there is a fair choice between the alter-\nnatives. If uideed the pessimists shoAA'ed signs of being extin-\nguished, he seems to think that then- doctrine would be false.\nBut in fact they survive. So, by that test, pessimism might be\n\" true.\" Anyhow Mr. Schiller is himself enough of a pessimist\nto hold that optimism requires the admixture of a good deal\nof pessimism before it becomes anything but frivolous. \" Sur-\nvival \" does not helj) to conclusions about truth in this case,\nnor yet in other dilemmas, such as that of determinism or free\nwill. Mr. Schiller says that, in such cases, we can and should\nchoose, and ovu- choice may affect the course of the wox'ld,\nhowever faintly. Perhaps. But all this seems to be a hazardous\nskating over the jjrecarious smiace of our dangerous world.\nThere comes a pomt, in these discussions, at which si:)eech\nseems inadequate, unless it be the speech of poets or sauits.\n\fXCI.] Reviews 199\nBut it is not always, or commoiily, that we are effectively\nbrought up against such issues. And for the issues of common\nlife Mr. Schiller has indicated very fruitfully, both how men\ndo form behefs, and how they should form them.\nOne of the questions he touches on is of peculiar interest to\nthe iS.P.R., for it is the question of survival after death.\nMany years ago, as is well known to the older members of the\nsociety, Mr. Schiller and Mr. Hodgson sent out a question-\nnaire enquuing what the recipients believed, hoped, feared,\nand so on, about that problem. The replies, some of which\nare quoted here, showed great diversity of opinion and much\nreluctance to attempt to pursue the question in a scientific way.\nThis reluctance most people must have come across, and it\nseems to be due partly to disbelief in there being any method\nof enquiry, partly to a desire to beheve, or disbelieve, what one\nwants. Mr. Schiller discusses the reasons for this attitude\nand concludes that they are serious obstacles in. the path of\nenquiry. \" I have not yet despaired,\" he concludes, \" of the\nS.P.R., but I realise that its path lies through a terrible\ncomplex of conflicthig emotions.\" When to this is added the\ndifficulty that people are almost ine\\dtably either unduly\ncredulous or unduly sceptical, and that it is very hard to know\nwhat degree of either quality is really \" scientific,\" the obstacles\nto the work of the Society seem formidable. But w-e have no\nright to pronounce them insuperable, and it ^^'ould be very\n\" unpragmatic \" to do so.\nG. Lowes Dickinson.\nMaJcing of Man; a Study in Evolution. By Sir Oliver Lodge,\nF.R.S (Pp. Lx +185. Hodder and Stoughton. 6s.)\nIn this book Sir Oliver Lodge discusses the Evolution and\nDestiny of man from a somewhat novel standpoint. Realising\nto the full the achievements of physical science, and in no\nway underestimating the rigidity of its demonstrations, he\nnone the less considers that there is ample place for a super-\nphysical order of reality\u2014a reality distinguished from that\nwith which jihysicists normally deal by permanence and im-\nmunity from decay. This order of existence he associates with\nthe Ether as opposed to Matter, though he considers that\n\f200 W. Whately Smith\ninteraction between the two may and, indeed, habitually does\ntake place.\nAn original and interesting view is developed in the second\nchapter, \" The Effort of Evolution,\" where Sir Oliver com-\npares Evil with \" inertia \"\u2014a fundamental property of matter\n\u2014\npointing out that although effort implies a resistance, that\nresistance need not necessarily be active\u2014it is not necessary\nto postulate an Evil Force deliberately opposing our strivings\ntowards perfection\u2014for the opposition encountered may be\nmerely analogous to that experienced in acceleratmg a mass to\nthe required state of motion.\nIn a later chapter the same concej^tion dominates the\ndiscussion of \" The Best of All Possible Worlds,\" in which the\nview is advanced that given the conditions under which\nthe Universe was in fact evolved the World is as perfect as\nis possible. Another corollary is an approximation to that idea of\nthe nature of the Deity of which the Rev. Studdert Kennedy\nis j^erhaps the most notable exponent in ecclesiastical circles.\nAccording to this view God is represented not as Omnipotent\nand Omnisicient Being who, for inscrutable reasons, elects\nto permit the existence of Evil, but rather as a beneficent\nPower demanding and needing our cooperation in combating\nit\u2014or as Sir Oliver would say\u2014in overcoming the inherent\ninertia of the Universe.\nThe book is, in fact, full of suggestive passages of which\nthe above are but samples taken almost at random and is\ncertain to appeal to many who, while unwilling to violate\nthe established conclusions of physical science, still feel the\nneed for behef in possibihties transcendent thereto.\nW.

Dr. Geley is not well known in\nthis country : I doubt if he is well known personally in\nany country except in France and Poland ;\nfor, whether\nthrough overwork or through a habit of concentrated\nthinking, there was an outer husk to break through,\nbefore one came upon the man himself. The first time\nI saw him v\/as at Mariemont, Edgbaston, in 1919, when,\nin company with Mr. Stanley de Brath, he called upon me\nunexpectedly one afternoon during what was at that time\nan infrequent, perhaps exceptional, visit to England. I\ntoo was very busy at the time ; and though he brought\na letter of introduction from my friend Charles Richet,\ncalculated to predispose me in his favour, I found him\nrather reserved and difficile. Very hkely he got the same\nimpression of me ; and I was by no means as hospitable\nas I v\/ould now like to have been. Doubtless the diffi-\n\f202 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nculty of language and of nationality is partly responsible ;\nbut something of the same kind was felt at first by\nothers whose control of language was much superior to\nmy own. Later, during several visits to France, I got\nto know him and his family, and, with the friendly\nassistance of Madame Geley, felt that I knew him better,\nand established the beginning of a friendship. Moreover,\nI met at his house some delightful people, and realised\nthe importance of his life and mission.\nHe was a philosophic thinker of no small magnitude.\nHis physiological and medical training gave him many^\nadvantages, he was well read in the writings of philoso-\nphers who had dealt with the relations between the\nconscious and the unconscious, and he had made a special\nj\nstudy of the views of M. Bergson.\nHis best known book, De Ulnconscient au Conscient}\naroused the attention of many in France. In it he tried\nto deal with the philosophy and rationale of psycho-\nphysical phenomena in general, and it may be regarded\nas the most important treatise on that aspect of the\nsubject since F. W. H. Myers's great and more comprehen-\nsive work. Moreover, Geley had the advantage of being\nbetter acquainted with physiological phenomena (which are\nevidently of vital importance in supernormal psychology)\nthan even Myers was. And whether his views hold their\nground, whether they really form the initial chapter of a\nnew science, or whether they are destined to be replaced\nas well as supplemented,\u2014questions which cannot be\nlightly or quickly decided,\u2014they are certainly based on an\napj)rehension of ectoplasmic phenomena, some personally\napprehended, some collated from the experience of others,\nwhich, as far as I know, is without a parallel. Had he\nlived there seemed every prospect of our learning a great\ndeal more through his indefatigable work amid the oppor-\ntunities which friends of the subject had provided, and of\nwhich, with rare self-sacrifice (comparable with that of\nRichard Hodgson), he availed himself to the uttermost.\n^Published by Alcan in 1919, and now translated into English, From the\nUnconscious to the Conscious (Collins.)\n\fxcii.] In Memoriam\u2014Gustave Oeley 203\nIn addition to his own contemplation and study of\nthe subject he patiently devoted a great part of his time\nto the convincing of others, especially of his medical con-\nfreres, or the few who would allow themselves to be\nsubjected to a demonstration, through first-hand experience,\nof the reality of the supernormal physiological phenomena,\nwhich had long attracted the attention and overborne the\nscepticism of Richet, Schrenck Notzing, Osty, and others.\nGustave Geley\u2014killed by the crash of an aeroplane\nas he was leaving Warsaw for Paris on the 15th\nof July 1924\u2014was born in 1868 at Montceau-les-Mines.\nHe studied in the hospitals of Lyons (where incidentally\nhe obtained the first prize from the Faculty of Medicine\nfor his thesis), and then established himself as a medical\npractitioner at Annecy, being at an early age specially\nattracted by the study of metapsychic phenomena. His\nfirst book was virtually on the origin of species, or what\nwas called in France (and occasionally by Huxley) \" Trans-\nformisme;' to express capacity for racial change, Les\nPreuves du Transformisme, with a sub-title Enseignements\nde la Doctrijie Evolutionniste, in which he criticised the\ndoctrmes both of Darwin and of Lamarck, and argued for\nan element of guidance or plan as necessary to account\nfor the origin of variations. In his second book, UEtre\nSubconscient (published in 1899), he attempted a syn-\nthetic explanation of obscure phenomena m normal biology\nas well as in abnormal psychology, and broached his\ndoctrine of what he called \" dynamo psychism,\"\u2014a sort of\nsoul-energy akin to the elan vitale, and not very different\nperhaps from the conceptions, otherwise arrived at by\nancient writers, of entdechy, and the Logos. This con-\nception of dynamo psychism was fundamental in Geley's\nscheme, and in his mind took the form of a vitahstic\ntheory which sought to escape from the trammels of\nmateriaUstic philosophy through what may be treated in\na wide sense as the interaction of soul and body, or,\nmore generally, a dynamic power of the mental '\nand\nspuritual regions competent to control, guide, and rearrange\nI atoms of matter. The fact of such control is famihar in\n\f204 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nthe bodily processes of digestion and the like, carried on with\na definite object or on a definite plan, but quite uncon-\nsciously ; and of these normal analogies he makes full use.\nThis book attracted some attention, but not till 1920\ndid it develop into a more comprehensive treatise, the\noutcome probably of a philosophy which was no longer\nsatisfied with the duality inseparable from the usual idea\nof interaction, but was seeking for a unification of the\ntwo main aspects of the universe by postulating a passage\nor development or evolution of one into the other,\u2014the\ngradual growth of the conscious at the expense of the\nunconscious,\u2014somewhat perhaps as is suggested by De\nMorgan's title From Hatter to Spirit. Geley's thesis, how-\never is purely biological, it does not deal with the non-\nliving, it trealts of the gradual unfoldmg or emergence of\nconsciousness out of subconscious or unconscious life^\nIn this work {De Ulnconscient au Conscient) Geley\ntraces many analogies in the animal kingdom, where from\na formless mass of protoplasm a full-fledged seK-determm-\nino- and in some sense conscious or ultimately conscious,\norSknism is gradually elaborated. From the formless pulp\nof the chrysahs, in which all the organs except the nervous\nsystem of the larva have completely disappeared, bio-\nlogists odmit that Hmbs and organs are reconstituted,\nunder the guiding influence of \" Life \"-a term which here\nat any rate must be left vague,\u2014operating apparently\nthrough the residual trace of nervous mechanism, until a\nfully ^developed insect appears, with characteristics quite\ndifferent from those of the larva, though doubtless to\nsome extent foreshadowed by them in rudimentary and\nbarely recognisable form. From an egg again, which is\nmairly a mass of unorganised food material, isolated\nfrom \"all external influence save the random molecular\nagitation which we call heat,\u2014yet which must contain a\nmicroscopic germinal vesicle, the nucleus and container or\nvehicle of the vital principle,\u2014a bkd emerges, completely\nconstructed and able to function in every detail, with an\ninteUigence enabluig it to stand erect, to move, to see,\nand intentionally seek its food.\nIn analogies such as these, and by appeal to the pheno-\n\fXCII.] In Memoriam\u2014Gusfuve Geley 205\nmena of reproduction generally, whether in association\nwith a placenta or otherwise, Geley and others are seeking\nto rationalise the strange jphenomena exhibited by ecto-\nplasm\u2014the reality of which is testified to also by Prof.\nRichet, who gave it its name,\u2014from which there appears\nto be quickly formed a temporary living organism, having\ninevitably some of the main characteristics of the pre-\nexisting normal organism whence the ectoplasm must\nhave been derived. In beginning the study of such\ntemporary formations, controlled by intelMgence and yet\narising out of apparently formless pulp, we seem at first\nto be in the region of the frankly incredible, certamly of\nthe plainly mysterious. But biological analogies, which\nare undeniable though equally mysterious, may serve to\nmitigate our initial increduUty, and enable us more placidly\nto contemplate, and perhaps accept gradually and circum-\nspectly, the strong and repeated evidence for the existence\nof such thiags, which from time to time is forthcommg.\nFor these apparitions or simulacra, or whatever they\nmay be called, are able to make an appeal to our senses ;\nnot only to the sense of sight, but the sense of touch, and\nthe muscular sense also. They are visible, they are some-\ntimes tangible, and they can exert force on matter ;\nthey\nsimulate human bodies or limbs. Indeed the analogy of\nour own bodies may be pressed into the service ; for these\ntoo are constructed by the vital principle out of materials\nwhich, whatever their previous history, are first reduced\nby the processes of mastication and digestion to a form-\nless pulp or even to thek molecular constituents. Yet\nunder the mysterious guidance of Life, each portion of\nfood or assemblage of molecules, when it arrives at its\ndestination, is there converted into the organ or structure\nappropriate to that particular locaHty, forming here a skin,\nthere a hair, here again a blood-vessel, or a part of some\ninternal organ ;\nfilling up artificially made cavities, such\nas wounds, to the proper level, and, under healthy con-\nditions, stopping there without going beyond the normal\nlimits ; in some of the lower organisms actually replacing\nlost limbs, or even reconstructing a whole amputated\nbody ; so that by section it is possible to get two animals\n\f206 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nwhere only one existed before. In vegetable life the\nprocess is still more familiar, as when the mere cutting\nfrom a tree reproduces not only the tree, but flowers and\nfruit and innumerable descendants.\nTo those who would study the operations of Life,\nwhether as displayed by mediums in the laboratory or by\norganisms in the field, all these things have to be taken\ninto account. And we shall presently find that one class\nof phenomena is no more incredible than any other, but\nthat every class must be examined and verified, and the\nlaws of its being gradually ascertained. There is much\nwork to be done, and Geley was on the track. Fortun-\nately a few biologists are waking up to the importance and\ninterest, not only of normal, but what appear now to be\nsupernormal phenomena : and in the course of a few gener-\nations we may hope, not for a full understanding\u2014for\nthat must be far distant\u2014but for a clearer comprehension\nand more active receptivity of all responsibly vouched for\noccurrences, not only in the chemical and physical and\nbiological, but in the psycho-physical direction as well.\nFor the boundary between the normal and the super-\nnormal shows signs of breaking down. We are beginning\nto get a glimpse of a continuity running through the\nwhole of animate nature. The interaction of mind and\nbody is attracting more attention than ever before,\nand in due time Philosophy may succeed in its great and\ndifficult and perennial task of unifying the vital and the\nmaterial, and realising that the ultimate clue is to be\nfound not in the material and transient but in those\npermanent realities which appeal to us as Life and Mind.\nBut to return to Geley the man. In 1918 the Institut\nMetapsychique Internationale was founded by the munifi-\ncence of M. Jean Meyer, and was established by him at\n89 Avenue Niel, Paris ; and Geley was invited to become\nits first Director.^ This involved his abandoning his\n^ Prof. Charles Richefc accepted its Honorary Presidency, and some\nresponsibility for experiment. The President is Dr. Santoliquido, lately\nthe head of the Italian Sanitary Service. The Committee included Dr.\nLeclainche, Inspector-General at the Ministry of Agricultui'e ; Dr. Cal-\n\fxcn.] In Memoriam\u2014Oicsfave Oeley 207\nmedical practice and prospects of success in his profession,\nand entering upon an arduous and unpopular task, which\nhe must have known would subject him to a painful\namount of ridicule and hostility. Even in this country-\nsuch a step would be a sacrifice ;\nalthough here, through\nthe exemplary and cautious labours of Sidgwick, Myers,\nGurney, not to mention such of the founders of the S.P.R.\nas are still hving, the ground has been to some extent\nprepared ; the hostility of the press, of the scientific\nworld, and of theologians, has been, not indeed removed,\nbut to some degree restrained or mitigated. In France,\nhowever, it must be conceded that both among clerics and\namong professional men hostility is rampant, though the\neminence of some of the workers is such as to render\nthem more or less immune from personal attacks. Geley\nwas not immune. His standing in normal and medical\nscience was not such as to curb the fiercest kind of\ncriticism. Scientific men in this country, as elsewhere,\nhave been accused of a kind of insanity, over credulity,\nmal-observation, and the hke ; but Geley was accused, not\nso much of those things, or not only of those, but of\ndownright fraud and deceitful co-operation ; in other words,\nhe was accused of being an accomplice and a liar.\nOlder members of the Society for Psychical Research\nwill remember that it was Henry Sidgwick's ambition to\nmake the evidence so strong that this accusation of com-\nphcity would be the only one left to opponents. He\ncould well afford to take that line ; for his transparent\nhonesty was such that accusations of that kind, in his\ncase, would have been preposterous. But a comparatively\nunlmown and junior man could hardly suffer such accusa-\ntions without pain ; and to rebut such scandal Geley con-\nsented to have his premises examined for secret doors and\nthe like, and to being chained up along with other investi-\ngators,\u2014himself as well as the medium being subject\nmette, Medical Inspector-General (France) ; Professor Bozzano (Italy) ;\nProfessor Cuneo ; the veteran astronomer Camille Flammarion ; Count\nde Gramont of the French Academy ; M. Jules Roche ; M. Gabriel j;De-\nlanne ; and Professor J. Teissier. A bi-monthly journal, Revue Mdta-\npsychique, is published by the Institut.\n\f208 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nto control. In the interests of truth, all these things\nwere submitted to ; and a v\/hole year of work was de-\nvoted for the most part to convincing doctors and pub-\nlicists and men of science that under the most rigid\nscrutiny and complete control of everybody present,\nnormally inexplicable phenomena actually occurred. That\nat least was the aim. Whether it was accomplished or\nnot, is not a matter for assertion. Some were convinced,\nothers were not : each must speak for himself.\nIt may be argued that the effort to convince people\nagainst their v\/ill is neither necessary nor mse. It may\nbe argued on the other hand that the asserter of strange\nand apparently unwelcome truth is bound to make the\nattempt. Crookes made the attempt, and failed. But\nmany things have happened since the seventies of last\ncentur5^ Geley made the attempt, and partially suc-\nceeded ; the most stringent evidence that he has been\nable to produce\u2014evidence from which it is difficult to see\nany loophole for escape\u2014being the casts of hands and\nother hmbs, but mainly of hands, which he obtained at\nWarsaw through the unpaid mediumship of Franek Kluski.\nI use the term \" unpaid \" because it was so, not because\nthat is a matter of ?^ny importance. Precautions are just\nas necessary in one case as in another ; and remuneration\nis perfectly reasonable if a medium is wiUing to accept it.\nKluski, though a manual worker, was not.\nThe jjaraffin gloves from which these casts were made,\nconsidered in conjunction with the conditions under which\nthey were produced and the crucial tests made to ensure\ntheir genuineness, are a standing demonstration of some-\nthing inexphcable by normal science ;\nthey constitute the\nkind of demonstrative evidence which Zolhier, long ago,\nand many others have sought, without success ; a per-\nmanent material record, which can be examined at leisure,\nand which,^\u2014given ascertainable and recorded conditions,\n\u2014\nare, as it were, a standing miracle. These casts repose\non the shelves of a cabinet in the Institut Metapsychique,\nand this is not the place to describe them. They repre-\nsent or tyi^ify the material side of Geley's achievements :\nhis books represent the other side. ...\n\fXCII.] In Memoriam\u2014Gtistave Geley 209\nThe last book he wrote was an account of these and\nother experiments conducted at the Institut, or in other\ncountries with the Institut as base. Under the title\nL'Ectoplasmie et la Clairvoyance, it narrates experiments\nestablishing his assurance of the genuineness of meta-\npsychic phenomena. The book has only just appeared ;\nand I hope that a translation will be forthcoming through\nthe industry of ]\\Ir. Stanley de Brath, whose friendship\nwith the a;Uthor, and whose close acquaintance with his\nwork, will certainly make it a labour of love.\nOn the note of friendship and personal appreciation I\npropose to conclude this notice. In answer to my en-\nquiries, one of my daughters, who a year ago was kindly\ninvited by the Geley family to pay them a long visit, has\nsent me the following personal information :\n\u2014\n\" Dr. Geley was quiet and difficult to understand, but\nalways felt friendly and kind. He v\/orked much too hard :\nit seemed as if he was always writing in his study or\nholding a seance. These sittings seemed to take it out of\nhim, giving him a tired look, and making him rather\nabrupt in his manner ; he was so conscientious about them,\nand worried if sceptics went away still sceptical. At\nmeals he was never too tired to be thoughtful enough to\ntalk slowly and carefully whenever he spoke to me, so\nthat I should understand. There seemed but httle peace\nfor him. His heart was in his work, and he showed\ngreat dehght when any important person obtained favour-\nable and impressive results. Very often he would sit\nsilent, apparently immersed in thought. Madame Geley\nof course managed everything in the house : and the\nfamily hfe was peaceful and affectionate.\"\nAs showing the estimation in which Geley was held by\nhis friends and co-workers, I shall here translate or\nparaphrase from a panegyric in La Revue Spirite a few\npassages which speak for themselves :\n\u2014\n\" What we would speak of, we who have known\nand loved him, is his magnificent inteUigence coupled\nwith high scientific conscientiousness ; also his exem-\nplary simplicity, his rare faculty of reconciling the\n\f210 8ir Oliver Lodge [part\nenthusiasm of the investigator with the reflective\nwisdom of the savant and philosopher ;\nfinally, and\nabove all, his charity which extended itself unmeasured\nto his most sceptical adversaries. . . . Serenely he\npersevered in his honest task, remaining indifferent\nto attacks, seeking only one end, to which he was\nvaliantly devoted : namely, the advancement of the\nstatus of a subject, of which the principles are already\nindisputable, and which he sought to raise above the\ncloud of suspicion in which it had too long been\nenveloped and hampered by the negation of orthodox\nmateriaHstic science. He knew that time was on\nhis side and that by slow but sure increments his hypo-\nthesis in some form would gradually become certainty.\nHis faith equalled his courage. He saw opening before\nhim a long stretch of life. He preserved that quiet\nfaith which sustains and guides all the great leaders,\nhe pressed forward in spite of obstacles, towards the\ngoal ;\nstriving only to bring about, one day, this\nvictory, towards which the advances are better and\nsecurer when gradually and cautiously made. He\nfelt assured that the barriers would yield, one by one,\nto persuasive pressure before the evidence of facts,\nwithout any necessity for using violence ;\nalthough\nnevertheless violence was employed against him by\nadversaries who doubtless felt that their ground was\nbeginning to shake under them.\n\" This achievement was for him the mission of the\nfuture\u2014of his future. He is no longer among us.\nThe torch has slipped from his fingers. Those who\nhereafter carry on the interrupted work will not find\nin the history of Truths courageously conquered a\nfiner example than that of Gustave Geley.\n\" For VIS spiritists, Gustave Geley is not dead. . . .\nHe falls, but his spirit rises. An active worker for\ntruth while on the earth, he will remain the same,\nin the luminous regions which he has entered, without '\nsurprise, and where he has reopened his eyes on a\nvaster vision. His mission has entered on a more\nactive phase.\n\fXCII.] In Memc\/riam\u2014Oustave Geley 211\n\" If this conviction can be any alleviation to the\ngrief of his wife and children and many friends, we\nmay bless once more the knowledge which enables\nus to mingle with our tears the vivifying promise\nof future reunion.\"\nTo this tribute M. Jean Meyer adds a touching note of\nremembrance and sympathy, speaking of the admiration\nand regret which he feels for \" this great savant and\nbenefactor of humanity, who lived only for the advance-\nment of his nascent science.\" \" His work remains : it is\nfounded on a rock, and will be continued m the same\nspirit. . . . He left the earth in that fragile aeroplane, his\neyes fixed on the heavens whence he came, . . . his great\nsoul will continue to inspire the strictly scientific work of\nthe Institut.\"\n\f212 Mrs. Henry SidgivicJc [part\nREPORT ON FURTHER EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-\nTRANSFERENCE CARRIED OUT BY PROFESSOR\nGILBERT MURRAY, LL.D., Litt.D.i\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nProfessor Gilbert Murray's experiments in Thought-\ntransference are perhaps the most important ever brought\nto the notice of the Society, both on account of their\nfrequently brilhant success and on account of the eminence\nof the experimenter. It is surprising, I think, that they\nhave not attracted more general attention than, so far as\nI know, they have. All persons, however, who remember\nhis interesting Presidential address in 1915 (see Proceedings,\nvol. xxix., p. 46), in which he gave an account of the\nexperiments, or have read the report by Mrs. Verrall on\nthe 504 experiments then before her (see the same volume,\np. 64), will rejoice to hear that Professor Murray has not\nceased experimenting, and will welcome the opportunity\nof studying the further series, comprising 259 experiments,\nwhich he has now submitted to us. I should Hke to\nsay first that though I win try to make the present report\nintelhgible by itself, all who really wish to study the\nsubject should also read the above-mentioned papers.\nAs, however, we have probably not all of us got either\nthe Presidential address, or Mrs. Verrall's report fuUy in\nour minds at the moment, I will quote Professor Murray's\nbrief account of the method of procedure. He says :\n{Proc. vol. xxix., p. 58.)\nThe method followed is this : I go out of the room and of\ncourse out of earshot. Someone in tlie room, generally my\neldest daughter, thinks of a scene or an incident or anything\nshe likes, and says it aloud. It is written down, and I am\ncalled. I come in, usually take my daughter's hand, and then,\n1 This paper was read at a General Meeting of the Society on\nDecember 12, 1924.\n\fxciT.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 213\nif I have luck, describe in detail what she has thought of. The\nleast disturbance of our customary method, change of time or\nplace, presence of strangers, controversy, and especially noise,\nis apt to make things go wrong. I become myself somewhat\nover-sensitive and irritable, though not, I believe, to a\nnoticeable degree.\n^\nMrs. Verrall, who was herself present on one occasion,\ngives a somewhat fuller account of the method (pp. 64, 65).\nAs to the way he gets his impression, Professor Murray\nsays (same page, above) :\nWhen I am getting at the thing which I wish to discover\nthe, only effort I make is a sort of effort of attention of a\nquite general kind. The thing may come through practically\nany sense-channel, or it may discover a road of its own, a\nchain of reasoning or of association, which, as far as I remember,\nnever comcides with any similar chain in the mind of anyone\npresent, but is invented, much as a hallucination is invented,\nfor the purpose of the moment.\nI have not myself had the advantage of witnessing any\nof the experiments, but Mr. Gerald Balfour was present\none evening, August 26, 1916, and though the success on\nthis occasion was somewhat below the average, it will\ngive a good idea of the experiments if I quote the notes of\nthis sitting in full, and a brief note by Mr. Balfour as to\ntho impression produced on him. The persons present were\nLady Mary Murray (Professor Murray's wife), his daughters\nMis. Arnold Toynbee and Miss Agnes Murray, his son Mr.\nBa^il Murray, Mr. Arnold Toynbee, and Mr. BaKour, and Miss\nBlomfield taking notes. On this, as on aU other occasions,\nall in the room were aware of the subject selected for\n1 The \" subject \" is written down, from the words of the agent, by\nthe note-taker, who keeps it in her hand and writes on the same sheet\nof paper the remarks made by Professor Murray, etc. As the note-\ntaker faces Professor Murray after he enters the room it is difficult\nto conceive any unconscious reading of the notes by him as has\nbeen suggested by one critic. I may add that it is written so\nquickly, and often in such faint pencil, that in studying the records\nfor the purposes of this paper I have sometimes found them quite\ndifficult to decipher, and have at times used a magnifying glass\nwith advantage.\n\f214 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\ntransmission ; and all were, or may have been, agents in\nthe transmission ; but I shall use the word \" agent \" for\nthe principal agent\u2014the person responsible for the subject\nand to whom Professor Murray attends.

Oh it must be at the C's.\"\n(Mr. Murray had got the flags wrong.)\nAs regards this sitting, Mr. BaKour authorizes me to\nstate that \" he came away from it with a conviction that\nhypercesthesia, to whatever length it might be stretched,\ncould not be made to cover every case. In one instance\n(No. 1) Professor Murray, in describing a scene out of a\nbook which he had not read, added certain striking details\nthat were present to the mind of the principal agent, but\nof which no mention whatever had been made when the\nchoice of a subject was being decided.\" See, however,\nNo. 53, p. 250.\nThe experiments Mrs. Verrall reported on went down\nto the end of 1915. Among those now before us I find\nthat 23 are dated in 1913 and 1915 respectively, and\nwere, I presume, accidentally omitted when the notes of\nsittings, which are all written on loose sheets of paper, were\nsent to Airs. Verrall. Subtracting these from the whole\n259 there remain 236 between April 1916 and April 1924,\nand these were made on twenty-four separate occa-\n\f218 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [PABT\nsions, the number on each varying from 3 to 26,^ with\nan average of about 10. It will be seen therefore that the\nattempts were infrequent. They were also very irregu-\nlarly distributed. Sometimes sets would be carried out\nat short intervals, and even on two consecutive evenings,\nwhile at other times there were intervals of months, and\ntwice over of more than a year. The company present,\nexclusive of Professor Murray himself, varied in number on\ndifferent evenings from 3 to 10, but the most common\nnumber was 6. It was always in the family circle that\nthe work was done, and though others were generally\npresent there were never, I think, fewer than two\nof Professor Murray's immediate family\u2014his wife or\nchildren\u2014in the party. ^ In the 236 experiments before\nus, however, persons outside the immediate family'\nhave been present and taking active part more fre-\nquently, I think, than was the case in the earlier\nseries examined by Mrs. Verrall. Besides 6 members\nof the immediate family, who among them acted as\nprincipal agents 167 times, 30 different people have\nacted as principal agents, 19 of them only once. And\nthe success obtained by these principal agents outside the\nimmediate family was quite considerable enough by itself,\nI think, to convince most people, though it was propor-\ntionately less than that of the immediate family. Besides\nthe 36 persons who have taken the part of principal\nagents about 20 others were present at different times.\nIndeed only on two occasions, November 22, 1923, and\nJanuary 27, 1924, were no outsiders present. I imagine\nthat none of these outsiders, whether they acted as\n^ It is perhaps worth noting that on the two occasions on which 26\nexperiments were tried at a sitting (September 10, 1916, and July 14,\n1918), tliere was an unusual proportion in which Professor Murray\nhad no impression at all, especially early in the sitting, and this was\nprobably the reason why so many were tried. For an experiment in\nwhich there is no impression is apt, I imagine, to take less time than\none in which an impression is gradually developed, or is oven immediately\nfelt and discussed by the company afterwards.\n2 Except, T tliink, during 4 experiments on September 14, 1916,\nwhen Mrs. Toynhee went out of the room while Mr. Mellor acted as\nprincipal agent.\n\f'xcii.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 219\nprincipal agents or not, were, strictly speaking, strangers,\nand some of them were intimate friends or relations.\nNevertheless, that so many should have shared in the\nexperiments shows, I think, a widening of the conditions\ndescribed by Professor Murray in 1915 (see above, p. 213).\nAnd the same is true of another restriction named by\nProfessor Murray, namely, change of place, for the 24 sets\nof experiments before us were carried out in at least four\ndifferent houses. Noise appears to interfere with success\nas much as ever ; but this is to be expected, since most\npeople with psychic gifts seem to find noise a serious and\noften a complete obstacle to the exercise of them.^ It\nshould be added, to make the above statement complete,\nthat in one only of the 24 sets of experiments (January\n2, 1918) was no success whatever obtained. There were\n6 experiments\u2014all failures\u2014Mrs. Arnold Toynbee being\nagent in 5 and Lady Mary Murray in 1. In 4 of these\ncases no impression at all was received\u2014an interruption in\none and noise in another perhaps accounting for two. In\nthe other 2 of the 6 cases wrong impressions uncon-\nvincing to the percipient were experienced, but both\nperhaps show signs of some influence from the thought of\nthe agent. On the other hand there were two occasions\nwhen no failures occurred, the number of experiments\nbeing 4 and 3 respectively. On the first of these occasions\n(December 3, 1919) I have reckoned 2 experiments as\nsuccesses and 2 as partial successes. An outsider present\ntook the part of principal agent in one of the partial\nsuccesses. The other occasion was on November 22, 1923,\nwhen only members of the family were present and only\n3 experiments were tried, of which I reckon two as suc-\ncesses and one as a partial success.\nIt is time I explain this classification and state how\nmany of the 236 experiments since the end of 1915 I\nreckon as successes, etc., but first I must remark that\n236 is of course too small a number to base rehable\nstatistical conclusions upon, and secondly that the classi-\n' Seances for phyiieal phenomena at which noise\u2014shiging, talking, etc.\n\u2014is insisted on, form an exception to this, if psychic gifts are really\nexercised at them.\n\f220 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nfication is essentially indefinite ; there is no clear line\nbetween one class and another. Endeavouring, however,\nto follow the divisions and standards adopted by Mrs.\nVerrall in her report I get roughly 85 {i.e. 36 per cent.)\nsuccesses, 55 (or 23\"3 per cent.) partial successes, and 96\n(or 40.7 per cent.) failures. Mrs. Verrall gives her per-\ncentages as 33' 1, 27-9, 39-0 respectively, so that, if I have\nsucceeded in dividing the classes as she would have done,\nboth the successes and the failures in the present set are\nproportionally greater than in the previous set, at the\nexpense of course of the partial successes. But I have\ndoubts about the standard, and particularly in the failures.\nMrs. Verrall says there is little or no doubt about failures,\nand this is true of 47 cases in which no impression was\nreceived,^ and also of some 33 in which the only\nimpressions were wrong. But there remain about 16\nin which the impression was on right lines so far as it\nwent, but in which it hardly seems to me to have gone\nfar enough to be reckoned as even a partial success. How\nwould Mrs. Verrall have reckoned these ? Nos. 2 and\n8 on August 26, 1916, quoted above are instances, and\nthe following is an even clearer one :\n\u2014\nSeptember 10, 1916.\n15. Siibject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :\n\" I think of\nthe girl in [Barrie's] Quality Street bringing down the wedding\ndress.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" No. I think it's a girl in a book,\nbut can't get it.\"\nOr again on August 17, 1918.\n16. Subject. Mr. Geoffrey Curtis (agent) : \"I think of\nCharles Lamb sitting by the fire with his maniac sister Mary\nand dreaming of the wife he would have married.\"\nProfessor Murray : \"I don't think I get it. I have a\nfaint impression of a man writing a book or an essay\n\u2014\nNo\u2014I've got a little bit an old fashioned literarj' atmos-\nphere.\"\n^ I have included in these 10 cases where the note-taker has merely\nJeft a blank for the percipient's statement, as I feel sure these were\ncases of \"no impression.\"\n\fxcii.] Experiments in Thought-TransferMce 221\nOr again, to give more complicated examples\u2014complicated\nbecause a wrong idea intrudes itseH and is rejected :\n\u2014\nFebruary 24, 1918.\n17. Subject. Mr. Patok (agent) :\n\" David O'Rane in 8onia\nbeginning to teach in his [old] school, and he is blind, and the\nboys don't know it.\"\nProfessor Murray. \"I get a faint impression of a school.\nIt's not a Baltic baron who can't read.\"\n[It seems likely, as regards the rejected idea, that the name\nof Mr. Stephen M'Kemia's novel, Sonia, though of course it is\nnot a Russian novel nor about Russian people, was responsible\nfor the idea of Baltic barons, and the blmdness for that of\ninability to read.] -\nJuly 14, 1918.\n18. Subject. Lady Atjrea Howard (agent) : [Her only\nattempt.] \" I think of the American who was taken to the\nchurch where the light had never been blown out for hundreds\nof years, and he blew it out.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" Is this a sort of Gothic medieval\nthing ? \" (\" Yes.\") \" I don't think I know the book or\nthe story\u2014It's not the people ItiUing Beckett in a church\n\u2014it's something like that.\"\n[Here the percipient gets the church, and the occurrence of\nsomething tragic in it.]\nIf these 16 cases are to be counted not as failures, but\nas partial successes, the percentages become 36-0, 30-1,\nand 33-9 for successes, partial successes and failures re-\nspectively.\nA similar difficulty occurs in drawing the line between\nsuccesses and partial successes. When the subject chosen\nconsists of several elements it may easily happen that\nthe agent fails to grasp one or more of these and yet\ngets the essential ones. Mrs. Verrall decided to count as\nsuccesses for statistical purposes, \"not only all cases where\nthe complete incident is described, but also cases where\nwhat may be called the essential elements are given by\nthe percipient,\" though, as she admits, \" opinions will\n\f222 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\ndiffer as to what is essential.\" She gives examples to\nillustrate her mode of deciding, and I have endeavoured\nto judge what are to be taken as successes in the same\nway, though of course without complete confidence that\nshe would have agreed with me. Examples of successes\nand partial successes can be seen in the sitting of August\n26, 1916, quoted above. Thus No. 1 (p. 214) is clearly\na success. The scene from a Russian book is fully\ndescribed by Professor Murray so far as the agent, Mrs.\nToynbee, had spoken of it, and (what is specially inter-\nesting), though he had not read the book he gives further\ndetails that were in her mind but had not been men-\ntioned by her. He fails, however, to perceive a final\npoint she was thinking of and would have hked him\nto name. No. 4 again\u2014a fantastic subject\u2014is com-\npletely, though only gradually, developed by Professor\nMurray. It is interesting to note that the last item,\ndrawn out by a question by the agent, appeared to the\npercipient to be merely a guess. No. 14 in which\nProfessor Murray recalls the real incident thought of by\nthe agent was also apparently a complete success.\nOn the other hand, Nos. 9 and 10 though, I\nthink, undeniably successes by Mrs. Verrall's standard,\neach fail in one particular. In 9 Professor Murray did\nnot get Diana crouching by the empty grate, and in 10\nhe did not get the colour of Natacha's dress. For partial\nsuccesses we have a clear case, I think, in No. 6.\nThe percipient recognises that the subject concerns Tess\nin Hardy's Tess of the Durhervilles, but fails to get the\nscene. Nos. 7 and 11 are perhaps more difficult to\ndecide about, as they are so nearly complete successes.\nBut I have called them only partial successes because in\neach case the percipient fails to recognise a person\nimportant in the supposed incident. Failure, by the\npercipient, to get some name or other item\u2014impor-\ntant or unimportant\u2014forming part of the subject as\ndescribed by the agent happens rather often. An attempt\nis sometimes made, either spontaneously by the percipient\nor in reply to a question by the agent, to supply these\nmissing items. The attempt sometimes succeeds, as in\n\fXCII.] Experiments in Thought-Tranaference 223\nNo. 4 above (p. 215), and No. 23 below (p. 224), and see,\ne.g. Appendix Nos. 49, 68, 82, 88, 110, 134, but sometimes\nleads to a wrong guess, see, e.g. Appendix Nos. 109, 111,\n115, 120, 122.\nIt will have been realised both from Mrs. VerralFs\nreport and from the cases already reported in the present\npaper that the subjects selected by the agents are very\nvarious. We may divide them roughly into five classes :\n\u2014\n(A) Scenes or incidents, either real or imaginary but\npossible, in which the experimenters themselves or their\nfriends and acquaintances are concerned. Nos. 11,\n13 and 14 above are instances, and see also Appendix,\ne.g. Nos. 46, 96, 108, 127, etc. ;\n(B) Scenes or incidents\nfrom books, plays, or history (real or imaginary, but not\nfantastic) or newspapers. Nos. 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16,\n17, 18 above are instances, and see also Appendix, e.g.\nNos. 58, 73, 92, 137, etc. ;\n(C) Fantastic scenes or\nincidents, including dreams. Nos. 2, 4, 7, 10 above\nare instances, and see also Appendix, e.g. Nos. 109,\n110, 120, 128, etc. ;\n(D) Particular quotations asked for.\nNo. 12 above is an unsuccessful instance. The following\nare successful ones :\n\u2014\nDecember 27 (1919 ?),\n19. Subject. Miss Agnes Mtjrkay (agent) :\n\" I thmk of the\nbegimiing of Shelley's Ode to the West Wind.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" I think this is a poem\u2014O Wild\nWest Wind.\"\n[These are the first words of the poem.]\nDecember 3, 1919.\n20. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :\n\" I'll think of\nThe Shropshire Lad :\n\u2014\nWhen smoke stood up from Ludlow,\nAnd mist blew off from Teme,\nAnd blythe afield to ploughing\nAgainst the morning beam,\nI strode beside my team.\"\nProfessor Murray. \"This is a poem\u2014oh it's the thing in\n\f224 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nThe Shropshire Lad, where De dum de dum from Ludlow\nand dum de dum from Teme\u2014smoke\u2014mist.\"\nSee for other instances No. 30 below (p. 234) and\nAppendix Nos. 65, 81, and perhaps 80. In the fifth\nclass (E) are inanimate scenes, or rather scenes in which\nhuman beings do not appear, e.g. No. 21, \"The sun\nsparkling on the water yesterday on the lake,\" on J^lly 14,\n1918, and No. 22, \"The four destroyers we saw this evening,\"\non September 10, 1916. There are only five in this class\naltogether, and only one was successful, and it is perhaps\ndoubtful whether that one should be placed in the class\nas it certainly strongly suggests human activity. It is as\nfollows :\n\u2014\nDecember 30, 1919.\n23. Subject. Mr. Basil Murray (agent) :\n\" I think of Sham-\nrock IV. coming into Southampton water in a storm, after\nwinning Atlantic Cup.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" I should say it was a yacht running\nbefore a strong wind\u2014running into harbour\u2014a thing I\nhave never had before\u2014yacht running into harbour in a\nstorm. I should say a West country place like South-\nampton or Plymouth \" (\" Any particular yacht ? \")\n\"One of the Shamrocks.\"\nare divided among the classes\nThe 236 experiments\nroughly as foUows :\n(A) 81 instances\n(B) 102\n(C) 30\n(D) 18\n(E) 5\nTotal, 236 instances\nIt appears, therefore, that\nare successful a little below\ntastic\njudge\nwith 28\nwith 36\nwith 14\nwith 6\nwith 1\nwith 85\n(or 34-5 per cent.) successes\n(or 35-3 per cent.) successes\n(or 46-7 per cent.) successes\n(or 33-3 per cent.) successes\n(or 20 per cent.) successes\n(or 36 per cent.) successes\nwhile classes (A), (B), (D),\nthe average, (C), the fan-\nclass, is, so far as the small numbers enable us to\nmarkedly above the average. Mrs. Verrall observed\nthe same thing. She says {Proc, vol. xxix., p. 84), \" There\nis no doubt that the fantastic and the unusual specially\nlends itself to the successful guessing of Professor Murray.\"\n\fXcii.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 225\nProbably such subjects tend to be more amusing to the\nagent, and thus perhaps to be more vividly in his mind,\nor to be there with what one may call a more explosive\nquality. Or perhaps their oddness more easily arrests the\nattention of the percipient.\nInversely, it may be owing to then' not being vividly\ninteresting to the principal agent that subjects suggested\nby some other person present seem apt to fail. There\nare only three in the present series, two of which are\nquoted above (Nos. 2 and 8), and all of which failed ;\n^\nbut there were 40 instances, of which the undue proportion\nof 20 failed, among the experiments reported on by Mrs.\nVerrall (see Proc, vol. xxix., p. 72).\nThis brings us to the question of the function of\nthe principal agent. As already said, all the persons\npresent know the subject selected, and all try, or\nare supposed to try, to transfer it telepathically to\nthe percipient as soon as he enters the room. We\nmay therefore ask (a) whether the principal agent takes\nany larger share than the others in the transfer-\nence, and (6) if so, why ? As regards (a), it is clear,\nI think, that the principal agent has a predominant\nshare in transferring the impression, because with the\nsame group of agents in the room the success with certain\nprincipal agents is on the whole greater than with others.\nMrs. Arnold Toynbee, e.g., is more effective as principal\nagent than when she is merely one of the company. As\nregards {b), the principal agent diifers as a rule from the\nrest of the company in two respects. He or she selects\nthe subject, and therefore is likely to grasp it more clearly\nand vividly than the others present do. And, what is\nperhaps more important, the percipient attends especially\nto the principal agent, which probably tends to bring\ntheir minds into special rapport.\nIn the earlier experiments it was the practice to try to\nintensify this rapport by the percipient holding the hand\n1 In two other experiments (September 14, 1916, and July 14, 1918\nrespectively) Professor Murray imagined wrongly that the subject had\nbeen suggested to the principal agent by someone else. One of these\nwas a failure and the other a success. (See Appendix No. 93.)\n\f226 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nof the principal agent. I am not sure whether this is\nstill the usual plan. The drawback to it is, of course,\nthat in certain cases of gradual development of an impres-\nsion, indications might be given by variation in hand\npressure. Approval or disapproval might also be indicated\nby facial expression and movements of the agents gener-\nally, but more delicate shades might be given by the hand\nof the principal agent. There are some cases where, as\nan impression develops gradually item by item, the with-\ndrawal by the percipient of some item already mentioned\nwhich sometimes occurs (see, e.g. Appendix Nos. 90, 102a,\n105, 112, 129) may be influenced by subconscious perception\nof the agent's disapproval ; bvit I think there are very few,\nif any, of the experiments in which guidance of the kind\nrequired to draw out correct items could have been ob-\ntained in this way. However this may be, there have\nbeen enough successful experiments in which the hand was\nnot held to show that holding it was not a necessary\ncondition.\n1\nIt seems possible that agents sometimes interfere with\neach other. This may have happened in the sittings on\nSeptember 10 and 14, 1916, the only occasions on which\nMr. W. Mellor was present. Numerous experiments\u2014twenty-\n1 We have in the present series 7 experiments in which it is ex-\npHcitly stated that there was no contact, and 2 in which Professor\nMurray described his impression as he entered the room, and therefore\ncannot have been holding the agent's hand. Among these 9 there\nwere 1 failure, 2 partial successes, Appendix No. 55 being one of\nthem, and 6 successes, for which see Appendix Nos. 52, 54, 71, 72,\n80 and No. 40 below (p. 243). After starting an experiment with\nno contact the hand was taken in tlie middle four times. In one of\nthese (see Appendix No. 53), with good results, and in two cases, of\nwhich one, No. 66, is given in the Appendix, with apparently no result.\nIn one (.Appendix No. 56), contact is followed by a correct but entirely\nirrelevant and promptly rejected impression about a book the agent had\nbeen reading. I am disposed to think that on some other occasions,\neven when nothing is said abovit it, there was no contact, because\ncontact is mentioned in one experiment of a set, as e.g. on September\n14, 1916, Appendix No. 66. It is perhaps worth mentioning that on\nDecember 27 (1919 ?), when Professor M'Dougall was acting unsuccess-\nfully as principal agent, Miss Agnes Murray took the hand in the\nmiddle of the experiment to see if this would improve matters, but it\ndid not.\n\fxcii.] Experiments in Thought-Transference ^27\nsix and nineteen respectively\u2014were tried on these two\noccasions, and Mr. Mellor was principal agent in eighteen of\nthem, with a degree of success ranking with that of the\nimmediate family. But they were pecuhar sittings, and\nincluded a quite unusual proportion of failures. Mrs. Arnold\nToynbee started as principal agent on September 10, and\nbegan with four failures. Lady Mary Murray followed with\na failure, and then Mx. Mellor tried, two partial successes\nand a failure resulting. Then Miss Heath tried once and\nfailed, and so did Mrs. Arnold Toynbee. She had nothing\nbut failures on this day, though usually a very successful\nagent. Mr. Mellor followed with two partial successes, Mrs.\nToynbee with a failure, ]VIr. Mellor again with a very partial\nsuccess and three failures, and then Mr. Basil Murray,\nMiss Heath, and Lady Mary Murray with one failure each.\nThere had thus been twenty experiments with nothing that\nI have counted as a success. But at this point success\nbegan. Mr. Arnold Toynbee taking the part of principal\nagent obtained a complete success (No. 33, p. 236 below),\nand an interesting partial success (Appendix No. 61), and\nMr. Mellor followed with two successes (Appendix Nos.\n62 and 63), and Mr. Basil Murray with one, Appendix\nNo. 64. The sitting ended with a failure. A contem-\nporary note at the end of the sitting says :\n\u2014\n\" A curious evening. Mr. Murray had a feeling the whole\ntime that everyone was doing it very badly. Mr. Murray\njumped at everythmg with Mr. Mellor, but nothing would last\nlong. Everything was very short. After a little time with Mr.\nMellor it went off, and after trying with others\u2014Rosalind [Mrs.\nToynbee], Lady Mary, Miss Heath and Basil, Mr. Mellor was\nbetter agam. Again Mr. Mellor fell off, and Arnold [Mr.\nToynbee] was a success, and then returning to Mr. Mellor, he\nwas better than before. Mr. Murray, the whole time, had to\ndo it in Mr. Mellor's way, which rather aggravated [Note breaks\noff here].\"\nAt the next sitting on September 14, Mr. Mellor being\nagain present, there was more success, though still much\nfailure. The experimenters must, I think, have had the\nidea that there was perhaps in some unknown way inter-\n\f22? Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nference between agents, for the plan was adopted of Mr.\nMellor leaving the room during four of the experiments\nwhile Mrs. Toynbee was acting as principal agent, and\nMrs. Toynbee leaving it during four experiments while\nMr. Mellor was principal agent ; and it certainly happened\nthat of the six successes obtained that evening, five\u2014two\nwith Mrs. Toynbee and three with Mr. Mellor\u2014occurred\nwhile the other was out of the room. The matter is not\ncommented on ui the contemporary notes.\n^\nWith so large a demand for suitable subjects to transfer\nas these experiments involved, one would expect occasion-\nally to meet with repetition. And there is a httle. In\nthe present series there are two iiistances in which the\nsame subject from a book is selected by the same agent\nafter an interval of a few months, and is successful both\ntimes. (See Appendix Nos. 52 and 53.) And there\nare further two subjects from books\u2014^the Bird-droves\nchorus from Hippolytus and Shelley rescued from drowning\n\u2014which appear once m this series and also once in that\nreported on by Mjrs. Verrall (see Appendix Nos. 45 and\n99) ; but while the hrst of these produced a wrong im-\npression on the earlier occasion and was successful on the\nApropos of above paragraph Professor Murray writes to me :\n\u2014\" In the\ntwo cases of X and Y, who are both rather psychic, the experiments went\nbadly wrong until we made them themselves the agents. I.e. I could not\nget messages from Rosalind while X or Y was there, but when she\nwent away and one of them was agent, or if they went away and left\nher as agent, all went well. This happened only with these two persons,\nand once or twice with my daughter Agnes. She rather disturbed the\ncommimications until she became agent. But later on, when she had\nher full fling as agent, she did not disturb Rosalind's communications\nany more. (I never saw enough of X or Y to be able, so to\nspeak, to satiate their desire to act as agent.) I am inclmed therefore\nto think that the disturbing element is a sort of restless desire on the\npart of some one present to act as agent. If so, it is not significant,\nsince any irritation or anger ixi the room acts like a loud noise and\nincapacitates me at once. I do not think I ever foimd scepticism any\nparticidar obstacle. Putting this more briefly :\n\u2014I mean, it is generally\nsupposed in our circle that the presence of another '\nmedium '\nis dis-\nturbing ; I suggest that perhaps it is not the ' mediumistic '\nquality, but\na certain irritated feeling, '\nI could do that : I want to do that rnyself,'\nwhich causes the disturbance.\"\n\fxcii.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 229\nsecond, the other, very successful eariier, produced no\nimpression at all when given again. On none of the\noccasions do either agent or percipient appear to have\nbeen conscious of the repetition.\nSo far the experiments have been discussed either from\nthe pomt of view of success and failure, or from that of\nthe agent's share in them. I now turn to the interesting\nand important question of what light is thrown by the\nrecords on the way the ideas the agent desires to transfer\nreach the mind of the percipient. In connection with this,\nProfessor Murray's own discussion of the subject in 1915\n{Proct^edings, vol. xxix., pp. 57-63) should be read. He\ntells us in his Presidential address, among other things,\nthat he thuiks that when experimenting he probably gets\ninto a state of slight hypersesthesia and is particularly\nsensitive to every kind of impression\u2014noises, for instance,\nbecoming mtolerable. He also says he inchnes to the\nconclusion that\n\" the basis of this so-called telepathy is unconscious sense-\nperception, the sensory disturbance itself being too slight for\nconsciousness, but the state of mind resiiltrag from it being\nfuUy perceptible But,\" he adds, \"we must be prepared\nfor the possibility that this sense-perception is not confined to\nthe canonical five chamaels of Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste,\nTouch . . . Again, some of the information which seems to\ncome most clearly and rapidly, as when I feel a certam emo-\ntional atmosphere, or the country to which an uicident belongs,\nor the fact that it is in a book and not in real life, does not\nseem to be the sort that could well be conveyed by mere\nsense-impressions of the canonical sort. Thus 1 should be\ninclined provisionally to admit the likelihood that we may\nbecome directly sensitive to another person's state of mind.\"\nIn this last sentence Professor Murray of course admits\nthe probability that telepathy has operated, but without\ncommitting himself to telepathy bemg a purely psychical\nprocess. He leaves the way open, as I understand him,\nto the theory which used to be described as \"brain\nwaves,\" but of which little has been heard of late. His\n\f230 Mrs. Hennj Sidgivick [part,,\nsuggestion of hyperaesthesia, however, makes it necessary |\nto scrutinise the records carefully to see what sign of it ;\nthere is. I will begin with the less important senses.\nTouch, which can, I think, only have operated through\nholding of hands, and then only in expressing approval or\ndisapproval by the agent of what has already been said\nby the percipient, has been discussed above (p. 226). Taste\nand smell do not so far as I can see come into the ques-\ntion of hyperaesthesia at all, because there were no real\ntastes and smells to be intensified by it. It is true that i\nthe percipient's impression began with a sensation of smell\non two occasions, but this had nothing to do with any\n'\nphysically caused sensation. I shall revert to the matter later.\nThe possibility of hyperaesthesia of sight\u2014unless on the\nextreme assumption that we can potentially see anything\nanywhere at any distance and through any obstacle, and\nthat therefore the percipient can read the note-taker's record I\nof the \" subject \"\u2014is in much the same position as that of t\ntouch. The only scope for it seems to be in the seeing of I\nslight signs of approval or disapproval as the percipient\nproceeds with his description. He cannot, however much his\nsensibility is heightened, be supposed to see concrete ideas\nor names in the faces of the agents. Sight in the sense\nof mental seeing\u2014the share of mental pictures in the\npercipient's impressions\u2014like imaginary smells and sounds\nwe must return to later.\nThe only sense through which we can seriously imagine\nhyperaesthesia helping Professor Murray in his\n'\"'\nguesses\n\"\nis, I think, it will be agreed, the sense of hearing. In the\nexperiments before us the subject selected for transmission\nis always spoken before it is written down, and I learn\nfrom Professor Murray that at the beginning of the ex-\nperiments tests were made to see if any fragments of\nordinary conversation could be heard at the place where\nhe usually stood, and that the experimenters were satisfied\nthat they could not. His own ordinary hearing, he tells\nme, is normal, but certainly not unusually acute. It\nmay, however, be that though out of earshot so far as\nconsciousness or normal hearing is concerned, he yet sub-\nconsciously hears the agent's description. There are some\n\fxcu.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 231\narguments, both for and against this possibiUty, to be\nfound\n^\nin the experiments under consideration, as there\nwere in those reported on by Mrs. Verrall.\nTakuig first thuigs which suggest hearing. There were first\nand foremost two experiments stopped because Professor\nMurray heard, or thought he had heard, a name. In the\nfirst (No. 24) (August 17, 1918) the subject was \"Pendennis\nat Charterhouse,\" and Professor Murray heard the word\n'Pendennis.' In the second (No. 25) (December 20, 1919)\nthe subject was \"Denis motoring from here to London\nby, etc,\" and Professor Murray heard '\nDenis.' In both\ncases the agent was Mr. Basil Murray. Professor Murray\nwrites to me as regards these occasions, \" I am not\nclear whether accidentally from excitement somebody had\nspoken unusually loud, or whether my hearing was super-\nnormal. It seemed to me hke the first, but this is not\nevidence.\"\nIn a very curious case, in which a name was neither\nconsciously heard or apprehended, it vet seems as if it\nmust have '\ngot through,' and if so, was the only part of\nthe \" subject \" that did. It was as follows :\nJuly 14, 1918.\n26. Subject. Mr. Penmoklan Main (agent) :\n\" Sh Francis\nDrake drinking the health of Doughty before he was led out\nto be hanged.\"\nPbofessor Murray. \" Is this a-?-No, I've a faint feeling\nof Arabia or desert.\"\nNow Mr. C. M. Doughty, the traveller, wrote a well-\nknown book called Travels in Arabia Deserta, and it seems\nalmost certain that the \" faint feeling of Arabia or desert\n\"\narose from association of ideas with the name Douc^htv\n\u2014the association with Thomas Doughty, the mutineeV\ntried and executed by Drake, being at the moment absent\nIt this IS correct, how did the item Doughty reach the\npercipient with the exclusion of other items in the \"sub-\nject \" proposed ? 1 It is obviously just what might have\nca^e of orJy a single word of the \"subject\" being apprehended\ngiven m Mrs. Verrall's record, p. 74. Also one where the sound of a\nword was grasped and at first misinterpreted.\n\f232 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nhappened in case of imperfect hearing. But this kind of\nimperfect apprehension, followed by wrong associations of\nideas, might also happen telepathically.^ In the following\ncase, though the chain of association is more doubtful\nthan in the Doughty case, I think the one I shall suggest\nis probably the real one ; and if so, sound is not a link\nin it.\nSeptember 10, 1916.\n27. Subject. Mr. Mellor (agent) :\n\" I'm thinking of the\noperating room in the nursing home in which I was operated.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" I got an impression of a theatre.\nNo. I can't get it. I'm now guessing\u2014Covent Garden\nand CEdipus.\"\nI think that here the idea of an operating room reached\nthe percipient's consciousness in the form of theatre\n\u2014\noperating theatre of a hospital\u2014but was not under-\nstood, being in fact taken to be a place where plays are\nacted. But the mistake, in whatever way it arose, was\nnot auditory.\nIt should perhaps be considered on the side of auditory\nhyperaesthesia that on the two occasions when the \" subject\n\"\nhad been suggested to the principal agent by Mr. Gerald\nBalfour (see Nos. 2 and 8 above), the fact that it was\nMr. Balfour's suggestion was realised by the percipient,\nas might have been the case if he had heard his voice.\nBut again this might equally be due to telepathy.\nThe apprehension of the rhythm of a verse or a sen-\ntence before that of its meaning may be suggestive of an\nauditory channel of transmission, and there are one or two\ninstances of this. No. 20 above (p. 223), where a stanza\nfrom The Shropshire Lad is recognised but not completely\nquoted by the percipient, is perhaps a case. And the\nfollowing is one where the impression of rhythm and of\nthe sound of counting combine to suggest possible hearing.\n1 We must not altogether ignore the possibility that some one of the\nagents may have had in mind, perhaps subconscioiisly, the association\nof the name Doughty with Arabia Deserta and conveyed this telepathic-\nally to the percipient, and a similar possibility must be kept in mind in\nsome other cases.\n\fxcn.] Experiments m Thought-Transference 233\nApril 6, 1924.\n28.

In the case of poetry, how-\nver, a fuU and correct transmission of the idea would of\nourse produce the quotation asked for verbatim, if the\ntoem is known to the percipient.

The most crucia\nkind of case is that in which the percipient has corred\nimpressions of things neither mentioned by the agent ii\ngiving the \"subject\" nor such as would necessarily bej^j,\ninferred from what is mentioned. There are a few in\nstances of this. No. 1 (p. 214 above) is a case ii\npoint ; for the impression that in a scene from a bool\nthe people present were mocking and then were sorry anc\nwanted to be kind, was true, but had not been mentioned\nand Professor Murray had not read the book. Anothe\niroi\nper\nKt\nm\n115\n111!\nilrf(\n\fiij xcii.] Experiments in Tkought-Transference 235\nexample from a book which he appears not to have read\nwill be found in the Appendix No. 88. That the person\nto whom shelter was given was a spy and an Englishman\nis not either stated or implied in the words of the agent,\nbut was nevertheless arrived at by the percipient. Another\ncase where a \" subject \" is taken from a book is somewhat\ndifferent from these. It is given in full in the Appendix\nNo. 48. The subject consisted of \"the gkl skating,\"\nfrom a Swedish book named by the agent. The percipient\ngot Scandinavia and, after first being misled by another\nassociation with Scandinavia and skating, which he re-\njected, correctly got a girl skating in \"a very wild atmo-\nsphere\" \"and wild burly people,\" and named the book in\nwhich the scene occurred and which he had read. But\nthe book he named was different from that named by\nthe agent ;\nand it turned out that he was right\u2014^the\nscene intended was in the book named by him. It is\nclear that his impression went far beyond anything said\nby the agent or necessarily implied in what was said. He\nmust first, it would appear, have got the scene and the\ngeneral atmosphere, and then remembered where it came\nj^ifrom. In a fourth case the incident described was not\njt;from a book. The agent imagined a high two-wheeled\nbuggy being driven down Holywell at Oxford, and the\n,^ J\npercipient got this, but added that it was on \"a muddy\njwet day.\" The agent had not mentioned mud, but after-\nwards said that she had thought of it (see Appendix No.\nitl8jll5). It is curious that though the percipient appears\n3t|t.hus to have apprehended a sort of accidental accessory\nHo the picture in the agent's mind, he failed to realise\niwho the person was who was supposed to be driving the\nect|buggy\u2014a person well known to him.\nThe kind of case which may be put next in order as\nsvidence against auditory hyperajsthesia is that in which\nthe percipient fails to recognise a person or book named\nijby the agent but realises something which is true about\nHhat person or book though not mentioned by the agent\u2014\nsomethmg which would, however, have been a natural\ninference from the name had the name been grasped. A\nli^^.ase in point is the following :\n\fKI\nIfit\nJen\nk\nbi\nC\nh.\nK\n236 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [pabt\nMarch 10, 1913.\n32. Subject. Mks. Arnold Toynbeb (agent) :\n\" I'll think of\nMargaret K at a particular restaurant in Munich where I\nused to have lunch.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" It's some girl I don't know\u2014a Cam-\nbridge girl, I think\u2014I can't get it clear\u2014is she standing\nin a restaurant or something like that 1\n\"\nHere, if the agent had grasped the name, Margaret K ,\nhe would have known, no doubt, that she was a Cam-\nbridge girl he did not know ; but it is difficult to see how\nhe can have arrived at these unmentioned facts about her\n(except telepathically) without the name. |*\nTwo cases in the Appendix (Nos. 92 and 94) may fa\nbe referred to in this connection. In No. 92 the per-f\"ai\ncipient does not realise that it is the death of Hereward\nthe Wake that the agent had spoken of, though he does\nrealise that the somebody killed was early Saxon or Norse\nand fought with a battle-axe\u2014which facts had not been\nnamed. In No. 94 the \" subject \" is taken from a book\nthe percipient had not read, but he realises that it is a\nsort of legend or fairy story, though this is not implied\nin the agent's words, at least apart from the unappre-\nhended name.\nThe order in which the elements of a \" subject \" present\nthemselves in the impression of the percipient is often\nvery unlike what one would expect if the impression\ndepended on hearing the words spoken by the agent.\nOne form of this is when the agent names a person, and\na mental picture presents itseH to the percipient, inter-\npreted by him as representing that person whom he then,\nbut only then, names. For example, on September 10,\n1916 :\n33. Subject. Mr. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :\n\" I'll do Riff\nVan Winkle coming down the mountain.\" i^'\nProfessor Murray. \" Oh I've got this. It's an old sort d\ngnome-like person with a matted beard coming down\u2014\nr\nvery funny feeling expecting to be known and fine\nthings\u2014Oh it's Rip Van Winkle.\"\nProfessor Murray gets a good picture of Rip Van Winkle [j^\nlo,\nliim\n0,\nT\nink\npec\n\fxcn.] Experiments m Thought-Transference 237\nwith appropriate description of his mental state\u2014neither\n\"'\nderived directly from the agent's words\u2014before he realises\nthat his picture represents Rip Van Winkle after awaking\nifrom his 200 years' sleep.\nOther somewhat similar instances in the Appendix are\nNo. 70, where the saUent personality in the agent's\ni\nstatement, is named only after being described by\n- the percipient; No. 82, where Mr. Gladstone is spoken\nII- of by the percipient as a dignified person before he is\niwjrecognised ; Nos. 86 and 98, where the name Lusitania\n\u2014\neri prominent in the \" subject \"\u2014is got at by the percipient\nafter \"Torpedoed ship\u2014people getting away in boats...\nly great big ship \" has been said in the first case, and\nr-\n\" awful impression of naval disaster \" in the second. A\nrdname uttered by the agent, but only appearing after\nfeeling about the subject by the percipient occurs also in\nsome cases of confused impressions gradually developing\ninto the right one. A conspicuous example is Appendix\nNo. 90, when Rousseau and the right incident concerning\ntiim are at length grasped. Compare also Appendix\ned'No. 102a.\ne-j There are two instances where the idea required is\njintroduced by a feeUng of an appropriate smell. The\nnt 'ollowing is one of them :\npn ...\nApril 22, 1923.\n34. Subject. Mr. Patrick Murray (agent) [The only time\nie acted as such] :\n\" The lion in the Zoo tr\\ang to reach a large\nliece of meat just outside the cage.\"\nProfessor Mtjrray. \"A sort of smell of wild animals\u2014car-\nnivorous animals. Something grabbing through bars at a\npiece of meat at a Zoo. Don't know the animal.\"\n.n the other instance which is quoted in full in the\nAppendix No. 49, Professor Murray begins by saying\n'This is curious. I've got a smell of some kind of in-\n^lensy stufi\u2014I should think it was opium or hashish\u2014\n\"\n^he \"subject\" being in fact a night club and opium den.\nThe smell experienced by the percipient in both these cases\nQust have been an imaginary or hallucinatory smell ; there\n'\u00b0'an hardly have been any real smell to suggest it. And\n\f238 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [paut\nwhy the required impression should enter the consciousness\nof the percipient in this particular way is mysterious. It is\npossible, no doubt, that the agents, or one of them, may\nhave been thinking of the smell appropriate to the idea\nthey wished to transfer ; but had they been conscious of\ndoing so, the fact would almost certainly have been\nmentioned after the experiment. I think it must be \\\nassumed that the idea of the smell originated in the i\npercipient's mind, and if so, that hypersesthesia cannot\nhave had anjrthing directly to do with it.\nIt will be observed that there is a difference in the\nrelation of the smell to the whole impression in these\ncases and in the experience of smell in the case mentioned\nby Professor Murray in his Presidential address. (Proc, vol.\nxxix., p. 59). In this earlier case a small bit of tarry\ncoal falling out of the fire was the apparent means of\nbringing into consciousness the smell of oil or paint burn-\ning, and so the scene of Savonarola and the burning of\npictures, etc., in the square at Florence ; there was an\nexternal cause\u2014perhaps a real smell from the tarry coal\n\u2014\nto suggest the smell of burning pictures. In the cases\nbefore us there seems to have been nothing to suggest\nthe smell except the \" subject \" of the experiment itself.\nOn one occasion, what was presumably in part at least\na sensation of soimd, \" the feeling of something whizzing\nalong at a tremendous speed\u2014aeroplane or car \"\u2014introduced\nthe percipient's correct impression (a certain motor car\nrace, see Appendix No. 130), just as an appropriate\nsensation of smell introduced it in the two cases just\nmentioned. There was no real sound to suggest it, apparently.\nWe may note in passing that, like smells, inarticulate\nsounds seem to have entered very little into any part of\nProfessor Murray's impressions. I find but three cases\nbesides the one just referred to which suggest it. One\nis the successful impression in No. 7 (p. 215 above),\nwhere getting \" the bursting of shells \" may have meant\nthat they were heard, though not necessarily so. In the\nother two the impressions were entirely wrong, but may\nhave included sound. In No. 35, September 10, 1916,\nthe percipient got a \" sort of feeUng of a heavy hammer\n10\nlc(\n\fxcn.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 239\nin an engineering place \" when the subject was \" the waves\nbreaking on the breakwater.\" And in No. 36 on April\n29, 1917, he had a \" faint impression of an explosion or a\nfire \" when the subject was \" Mr. Asquith being taken up\nto the front in a staff car down at Verdun.\" Only once,\nso far as I know, did an agent try to impress an in-\narticulate sound on the percipient\u2014it was the croaking of\nfrogs\u2014but no impression was received (see Appendix No.\n60). It occurred, however, in the middle of a series of\nfailures.\nReturning to the question of hyperaesthesia. Cases where\nthe percipient's impressions begin with something associated\n. in idea with the \" subject \" of the experiment, but some-\nthing not alluded to by the agent at all, must I think be\nregarded as weighing against any explanation by auditory\nhyperaesthesia, for the associated idea precedes any know-\nledge of the subject. The foUowmg is a case in point :\nAugust 17, 1918.\n37. Subject. Mr. Basil Murray (agent) :\n\" I'm thinking of the\nI\nEtruscan seer who during the siege of Veil was captured by a\nyoung Roman warrior. He told them to drain the Alban lake\nin order to take Veii.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" I don't thmk it's Balaam, but it's\nsomething like\u2014It's a prophet who's serving the wrong\nside\u2014not Hebrew. I think it's early Roman\u2014I've got\nthe impression that he's telling them to drain a marsh.\n\u2014\nDoes he come in Livy ? I get an impression that he's\ncaught and made to reveal a secret.\"\nFor other examples see Appendix Nos. 77 and 81 and\nNo. 42 (p. 244 below). And perhaps we may class with\nthese the following case (only partially successful) where\nan emotion\u2014that of being frightened, unmentioned by the\nagent\u2014appears to precede any realisation by the percipient\nof facts which would have justified it.\nMay 29, 1919.\n38. Subject. Miss Agkes Murray (agent) :\n\" Don Juan eat-\ning cucumber sandwiches with [X. Y. a modern woman] on\n'\nMount Vesuvius.\"\n\f240 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nProfessok Mueray. \" Curious feeling of being frightened.\nIt's quite clearly Mount Vesuvius. It isn't an eruption.\nIt is some one quite idly on the top, not frightened\u2014\npicknickmg\u2014simply my own feeling how dangerous it is\n\"\n(\" Can you get who they are ? \") \" No\u2014Rosalind. They\nare eating their picnic.\"\n(Mr. Murray had a feelmg of cucumber at one time.)\nA case which may be compared with this is No. 78\nin the Appendix, where the emotion of being afraid in a\nfirst battle presents itself not inappropriately, though the\nimpression as a whole is a failure.\nWith these cases of emotion may be considered what\nProfessor Murray calls in his Presidential address, \" a\nsort of indeterminate sense of quality or atmosphere \" ^\n\u2014\ngeographical, literary or other\u2014which often precedes any\nmore definite idea in his impression, and which appears\nto him unlikely to be conveyed by the senses. There is,\nhowever, apt to be some word or phrase in the \" subject\n\"\ngiven which, if apprehended, might suggest the atmo-\nsphere in question, as there is, e.g. in the case No, 78\njust referred to.\nAnother argument against the source of Professor\nMurray's impressions being actual hearing is afforded by\ncases where the general idea is manifestly caught by the\npercipient and the right atmosphere, as it were, given,\nyet no single important word of the subject is reproduced\nby the percipient. No. 97 in the Appendix is a case in\npoint. We get there King George \" giving V.C.'s and\nthings \"\u2014or at any rate \" an investiture of some sort,\" for\nQueen Victoria giving medals to the Crimean soldiers,\nThere is a similar kind of transformation in No. 84.\nwhere crowded Eastern streets are substituted for the\nbazaar in Cairo ; but in this case the guess that follows\nis badly off the track. >\nI think there is not much more to be said for or\nagainst aid being received by Professor Murray through\nthe senses, or in particular the sense of hearing. In\n1 See Proceedings, vol. xxix., p. 60, and also the extract from the\naddress quoted above, pp. 212, 213.\n\fxcn.] Experiments in ThougM-Transference 241\nsome cases the evidence against it seems, as we have seen,\nconclusive, and I feel sure that if hearing, however hyper-\naesthetic, has operated at all, it has done so rarely.\nI do not propose to comment on all the experiments\nbefore us, one by one. But before concluding, there are\na few things about the way the impression comes to the\npercipient which it may be interesting to note. Though\nProfessor Murray's attempts to reproduce the agent's\nsubject are sometimes spoken of as guesses, no one, after\nreahsing the degree of success obtained, will imagine that\nmere guessing could have produced it. It is evident that\ntelepathy, or some other agency, has been at work. At\nthe same time Professor Murray distinguishes three things\n\u2014namely, the impressions that come to him from without,\ninferences from these impressions, and guesses to supple-\nment them. No doubt both inferences and guesses may\nsometimes really be impressions from without, but they\ndo not appear so at the time to the percipient. In the\nfollowing case impression, guess, and inference are all\nexemplified.\nDecember 26, 1921.\n39. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :\n\" I think of John\nBright going to speak in Birmingham on free trade\u2014so fright-\nened he feU off his chair.\"\nProfessor Murray. \"This is somebody all of a tremble-\nIt's somebody with [a] sort of stage fright who is going\nto make a big speech\u2014I think he faUs down\u2014Does he\nfaU off his chair ? Oh I'm merely guessing\u2014but I should\nthink it's John Bright\u2014oh well\u2014the rest I can guess.\nI suppose he was making [the] speech on free trade-at\nBirmingham.\"\nI\nThe percipient here gets an impression of the scene,\njj\nguesses that John Bright was the person concerned, and\nI\ngiven these facts, infers that he was making a speech on\n1 free trade ;\nfor I assume that when Professor Murray said\n'\n\"the rest I can guess,\" he meant it appeared to him a\nI\npretty obvious inference.\nIt is of course the \"impressions,\" as probable examples\n\f242 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nof telepathy, that interest us ; and their nature and\nquaUty vary in different ways. First they differ in in-\ntensity and clearness\u2014varying from strong to faint or\neven very faint, and from clear to blurred. From the\nremarks occasionally made by the percipient about the\nvividness, etc., of particular impressions, I should judge\nthat one which is strong and clear, or which comes\nquickly, is usually right, but not always.^ But, on the\nother hand, the impressions may be faint and dim or\nblurred, or slow in developing, in quite successful ex-\nperiments.\nSlow development is, sometimes at least, a kind of\ngroping after the \" subject \" with or without ultimate\nsuccess. The feeling, I suppose, is like what we have\nwhen we are trying to recall something\n\u2014\ne.g. a name or\nan address\u2014which we know we ought to remember and\nfeel on the verge of remembering, but which will not\nemerge into consciousness. Perhaps indeed the attempt in\nboth cases is to raise into consciousness what is already\nin our minds subconsciously. A very good instance of\ngroping for the right impression which does not come is\nNo. 47 in the Appendix. See also No. 16, (p. 220\nabove), and Appendix No. 139. Successful groping is\nseen in No. 4, (p. 215 above), and in other cases of\ngradual development (e.g. Appendix Nos. 61, 90, 95).\nAn instance where groping probably led to guessing is\n1 In 17 of the 33 cases of failure (spoken of on p. 220 above) in\nwhich Professor Murray got some impression, but a wholly wrong one,\nit is stated that the impression was faint or vagxie, and in all these\nbut one this statement about faintness was made before anything was\nsaid of what the impression was. In the other 16 cases nothing at all\nwas said about the intensity of the impression. There is, however, a\ncase of mixed success and failure on February 24, 1918, when the\nsubject to be transferred was an incident concerning a Mrs. B. '\nbeing\nsilly '\nat a cricket match. Professor Murray described another incident\nconcerning her and then said, \" No\u2014it is Mrs. B.\u2014I don't expect I\nshall get it\u2014because I got that ]'the wrong incident] quite clearly.\"\nOn reading this report Professor Murray added : \u2014\" But the incident,\nthough wrong, was a very characteristic example of the kind of\n'\nsilliness '\nimplied. The mistake was perhaps due to my subconscious\nself over-dramatising the vague expression.\" The principal agent in\nthis case was acting as such for the only time in the present series.\n\fxcn.] Experhnents hi Thought-Transference 243\nAppendix No. 118, where the subject is \"the four riders\nof the Apocalypse,\" and the percipient having got gallop-\ning horses, and presumably some subconscious idea that\nthere is something unreal about them, thinks for a moment\nthat it is going to be a Walkyrie ride.\nIn contrast to cases of gradual development are those\nwhere the impression comes instantly, and the percipient\nprobably could not have told us how it came to him.\nFor instances of this see Appendix Nos. 46 and 80, and\nthe following case (which chronologically followed 80).\nNovember 18, 1917.\n40. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :\n\" Alice in Wonder-\nland, falling down the rabbit hole and landing where Bill the\nLizard is watching, and White Rabbit is going by at the\nsame time.\"\nProfessor Murray (as he enters the room). \" I want to say\n'\nOh my ears and whiskers.'\n\"\n[In the book, when Alice after falling down the rabbit hole\npursues and comes up with the White Rabbit, he is saying\n'\n0 my ears and whiskers, how late it's growing.' Bill the\nLizard does not appear in this scene in the book.]\nIn this case the impression takes the form of a quotation\nso appropriate as to make it certain that the subject to\nbe transferred has been apprehended. There are several\nexamples of this. The following is one :\nAugiist 17, 1918.\n41. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :\n\" I think of the\nscene in Macbeth when the feast is beginning and Lady Macbeth\nis sittmg at the head of the table, and Macbeth comes in and\nwon't sit down because he sees the murdered ghost.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" I've got this :\n\u2014' Which of you has\ndone this ?\n'\nIt's Macbeth when he sees the ghost in\nthe chair.\"\n[The quotation is Macbetli's first remark when he sees Ban-\nquo's ghost in his chair.]\nCompare with this Appendix Nos. 76, 85, 89, 106,\n107. In No. 109 an appropriate quotation comes to\n\f244 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nProfessor Murray at once, but does not imply the whole\nsubject, most of which, however, is successfully developed\nafterwards.\nIn all these cases where the answer is given in the\nform of a quotation, it would seem probable that the\nagent's ideas reached the percipient first as ideas.\nIn other cases, as we have seen, the impression comes\nfirst through a sensory mental channel, e.g. smell in No.\n34, (p. 237), sound in Appendix No. 130, a visual image\nin No. 33, (p. 236). A very clear case of a visual image\nand nothing else wiU be found in the Appendix No. 101.\nThe percipient recognised almost all the details of the\nscene intended as though he had had the scene itself or\nan actual picture of it before his eyes, but\u2014as would\nequally have been the case with a real picture unex-\nplained\u2014he failed to realise the agent's chief idea, which\nwas that the little girl sewing under the apple trees was\na youthful Joan of Arc. Her appearance could not inter-\npret itself as Rip Van Winkle's could.\nProbably in most cases the impression comes in a mixed\nway\u2014partly as ideas not, at least to begin with, of a\nsensory kind, and partly as visual or auditory images.\nJudging from the experience of other percipients it seems\nHkely that the different avenues used are not always\ndistinguishable even by the percipient himself ; and as\nbetween different telepathic percipients, had we others to\ncompare with Professor Murray, we should probably find\nthat the comparative use of the different possible avenues\npartly depended on the make up of the percipient's own\nmind\u2014on whether he was a good visualiser and so forth.\nI imagine the following case to be a good example of\nimpressions coming in different ways in the same experi-\nment and gradually producing a comprehensible whole.\nFebruary 24, 1918.\n42. Subject. Mr. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :\n\" Isle of Capri,\nand on it is the old Master of Balliol [Strachan Davidson] and\nmy uncle [Arnold Toynbee] and they are reading the Bible,\nand my uncle says what a good book it is, and Strachan\nDavidson is chuckling.\"\n\fxcn.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 245\nProfessor Mtjrbay. \" I get T L on the Riviera\nbeing very funny about the book of Samuel. [He]\nhad never read it. It's Italy I am sure, and it's some-\nbody being impressed by the Bible or talking about it as\nthough he had never read it before. I get the manner\nof Strachan Davidson.\u2014I should say it was at Naples,\nor some place with the blue sea all about. Should say\nit was Capri. Oh your uncle Arnold Toynbee.\"\n(\n[Contemporary note]. Arnold had never seen his uncle [who\ndied in 1883], and Mr. Murray had not known him.)\nHere an idea, at first probably subconscious, of the dis-\ncussion on the Bible must have introduced the irrelevant\nrecollection of a similar conversation on the Riviera\n;\ngetting the manner of Mr. Strachan Davidson seems to\nimply a visual or auditory impression or both ; and \" the\nblue sea all about \" suggests a visual impression.\nThere is one case, Appendix No. 54, where Professor\nMurray gets almost all the items of the agent's subject\ncorrectly in detail\u2014whether visually or not we do not\nknow\u2014but complains that he \" can't get it together. [He]\nonly get[s] fragments.\" Perhaps this only means that he\nimagined there was some kind of story connecting the\nitems he got, whereas the agent had not indicated any.\nOf course all we know directly about the percipient's\nreception of the subject set by the agent is what the\nformer can teU us about his conscious impressions. That\nsubconscious work goes on in the production of the result\nis a matter of inference, but I think an inference fully\njustified. It can almost be proved true in certain cases,\nand I am inclined to think that as a matter of fact\nmost of the work in producing Professor Murray's tele-\npathic impression is subconscious. As evidence I may\nfirst refer again to the Doughty case. No. 26, (p. 231\nabove). Here, if our interpretation of the case is right,\na name must have been unconsciously apprehended and\nunconsciously associated with the title of a book ; this\nlast then emerging faintly into consciousness. Sensory\nimages, with interpretation following (not preceding) them, as\nin 33, (p. 236 above), strongly suggest subconscious manu-\n\f246 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nfacture\u2014indeed I think imply it. So does emotion felt\nappropriately, but without realised cause, as in No. 38,\n(p. 239 above). Again, when the impression comes to the\npercipient's consciousness in the form of an appropriate\nquotation which has not been in the agent's mind there\nmust, it would seem, be an idea behind it, prompting it,\nand that idea must be subconscious as the percipient is\nnot aware of it.\nGranting that the subconscious mind does play so\nimportant a part in receiving and forwarding the subject\nto be transmitted, we see that error may come in at\nfour stages. The subject may get through from the agent\nto the percipient's subconscious mind in any degree of\nincompleteness ;\n^ it may there be further distorted by false\nassociations and inferences ; loss may occur again in emerg-\ning into consciousness owing to inhibitions or otherwise ;\nand finally, the conscious mind may reject some ideas or\nimages, and misinterpret others.\nFor an example of conscious rejection of a perfectly\ncorrect impression see Appendix No. 74, where Professor\nMurray refuses to accept Lord Morley as part of the\n\" subject \" because he happened to be reading his Re-\ncollections, and therefore imagined a normal origin for the\nidea of him. I suspect the normal consciousness to have\nbeen responsible for a hasty (and rather muddled) mis-\ninterpretation of a visual image of a haK-naked Arab\ninitially presented to it in the following case :\nFebruary 24, 1918.\n43. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :\n\" AUenby.\nBritish troops in Palestine and a sort of Arab man coming up\nand standing half naked by a well.\"\nProfessor Murray. \" This is the good Samaritan guiding\nthe English troops into Jericho. I don't know that he\nis the good Samaritan. He might be a biblical figure,\ncoming up and speaking to General AUenby, and show-\ning the way.\" (\" Anything he is near ? \") \" Well a\nwell. I got him naked with no clothes.\"\nI It is at this stage presumably that deficiencies in the agent as an\navailable source for impressions would operate adversely.\n\fxcTi.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 247\n[The impression here seems to begin with a visual image of\nthe half naked Arab which suggested the man that fell among\nthieves on the way to Jericho, and thus the good Samaritan\nwho helped him.]\nIf telepathic impressions usually come through the\nsubconscious mind, which on other grounds than the\nexperiments under discussion seems to me likely, it is\npossible that one important quality in a good telepathic\npercipient may be a power of drawing easily on the\ncontents of his own subconscious mind.\nAPPENDIX I.\n\/ quote here almost all the cases counted as successes\nwhich have not already been quoted in the body of the\nReport, and also cases of partial success or of failure which\nseem to present points of interest.

Of course, other and far abler men\nboth preceded me and worked contemporaneously with me ;\nto some of these I wiU refer directly.\nEarly Psychical Reseakchees.\nBy psychical research I mean the critical investigation,\nand, where possible, the verification of alleged supernormal\nphenomena, or of hitherto unrecognised human faculties.\nSo far as regards narratives of spiritistic phenomena,\nthese of course go back to remote ages, and records are\nto be found in many different countries. Years ago\nAndrew Lang had several conversations with me on the\nvalue of the S.P.R. devoting some time to historical\nresearch on this subject, for he attached great importance\nto the fact of the wide diffusion, both in space and time,\nof phenomena similar to those we are now engaged in\ninvestigating. 2\n1 Read at a Private Meeting of the Society on June 17, 1924.\n^ The laborious and admii-able work by William Hewitt, entitled\nHistory of the Supernatural, is well known and should be consulted by\nall who are interested in the history of psychical research. It made a\ngreat impression on me when I read it some fifty years ago. The term\nsupernatural should, however, have been supernormal, as all phenomena\n\u2014\nhowever novel and inexplicable they may appear to be\u2014are really\nnatural ;\nonly God is above and beyond Nature.\n\f276 Sir William Barrett [part\nBiblical references show that Spiritualism was rampant\nin the early history of the Jews ;\nKing Saul himself being\na notable spiritualist, consulting his medium at Endor.\nAs I have said elsewhere, before science had established a\nuniversal reign of law or of the great world order, the\npursuit of these spkitistic phenomena was justly con-\ndemned by the ancient prophets as hkely to lead to !\nintellectual and moral confusion. It seems probable, how-\never, that many of the prophetic writings were done\nautomatically, as in the book of Chronicles David says\nthat the instructions he gave regarding the building of the\nTemple were not his own ideas, for \" the Lord made me\nunderstand in writing by his hand upon me.\" ^\nOne of the first psychical researchers of whom I can\nfind any report was the learned and famous German\nJesuit, Fr. A. Kircher. In his Latin foUos, published in\nj\n1640, he discusses the cause of the motion of the '\npendule\nexplorateur ' (a little ball or ring suspended by a string j\n;\nheld by one hand) and of the forked divining rod, both h\nof which at that time were the subject of acute con-\ntroversy. Kircher showed that if the '\npendule ' or the : i\nrod were held, not by the hand, but by a rigid support, ii\nno motion occurs under any circumstances. He was thus \\\nled to discover the principle of unconscious muscular i\naction, a discovery claimed two centuries later by the |\ndistinguished French chemist, Chevreul, and by Dr. W. B. |\nCarpenter subsequently. i\nSome twenty years after Kircher's work appeared, one i\nof the founders of the Royal Society, the Hon. Robert i\nBoyle, '\nthe son of the Earl of Cork and the Father of s\nChemistry,' in his Philosophical Works discusses the I\nquestion of the divining rod, and urges further experi- s\nments to test its value in the discovery of mineral veins, ]\nfor the evidence he collected was conflicting. He remarks t\nthat eye-witnesses, who were far from credulous, told him s\nof the great value of the rod, and one gentleman in whose\nhand it moved when he passed over a vein of ore, affirmed p\n\" that the motion of his hand did not at all contribute\nto the inclination of the rod, but that sometimes when\n1 See 1 Chron. xxviii. 19. ... .\nj\n\fxcn.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 277\nlie held it very fast it would bend so strongly as to\nbreak in his hand.\" ^\nIn one of the first volumes of the Philosophical Trans-\nactions of the Royal Society Boyle asks the question whether\nanyone could inform him \" whether diggers do meet with\nthe subterraneous demons which are said to inhabit the\nlead mines of Somersetshire, and in what shape and\nmanner they appear ?\n\" In a subsequent number the famous\nDr. Glanvil, also a Fellow of the Royal Society, rephed\nthat he lived near the lead mines in the Mendips, and\nthat whilst the miners heard the knockings of the demons,\nand by following the directions of these knockings were led\nto plenty of ore, nevertheless he had not found anyone who\nhad actually seen the demons or gnomes themselves, and\ntherefore he could not describe their appearance or habits.^\nA curious fact is that these knockings are heard and the\ngnomes beheved in by lead miners in various parts of\nEngland and Ireland. The simple scientific explanation of\nthese sounds I think I have discovered, but it would take\nme too far to go into the m^atter here. The point I want\nto bring out is that Boyle and Glanvil and many of the\nearly Fellows of the Royal Society were true psychical\nresearchers ; as Prof, de Morgan has said, \" they set\nthemselves to work to prove aU things, that they might\nhold fast to that which was good ;\nthey bent themselves\nto the question whether sprats were young herrings and\nwhether a spider could crawl through the powder of a\nunicorn's horn.\" They enquired whether there was any\nvalue in magnetical cures and any good in Kenelm Digby's\nsympathetic powder. Even a century later the great Sir\nIsaac Newton describes in a series of letters\u2014which I have\nseen, as they have been preserved by my friend, Mx.\nBlayny Balfour\u2014how he spent much time and money in\nbesting the value of certain alchemical powders which were\n3aid to turn lead into gold.\nThe early spiritualists really took the method of these\npioneers of physical science. Though they might have\n1 Boyle's Philosophical WorJcs (1738), vol. i., p. 172 and 173.\n^Phil. Trans., No. 19, Nov. 1666 ; and GlanvU's reply is in Phil.\nTrans., vol. iii., 1668.\n\f278 ' Sir William Barrett [part\nbeen frequently too credulous, yet what they aimed at was\nto collect facts however improbable they appeared to be,\nand as De Morgan says, \" The spiritualists beyond a doubt\nare in the track that has led to all advancement in\nphysical science ;\nthey have the spirit and the method of\nthe grand time when paths had to be cut through the\nuncleared forests in which it is now the daily routine to\nwalk. Their spirit was that of universal examination,\nwholly unchecked by fear of being discovered in the\ninvestigation of nonsense.\" ^\nOne of the earhest Fellows of the Royal Society, to\nwhom I have aheady referred, was Dr. Joseph Glanvil\n;\nhe was chaplain to Charles II. and a prebendary of\nWorcester. The historian Lecky describes him as \" a man\nof incomparable abihty.\" Speaking of one of Glanvil's\nworks, Lecky remarks, \" it would be difficult to find a\nwork displaying less of credulity and superstition than this\ntreatise.\" Glanvil's Saducismus Triumpliatus, pubhshed at\nthe end of the seventeenth century, discusses the evidence;\nconcerning witches and apparitions, and gives the fuUest\nreport of those remarkable poltergeist phenomena known\nas the '\nDemon of Tedworth ' or the \" Disturbances in\nMr. Mompesson's house in Wiltshire.\" Glanvil truly\nremarks that \" matters of fact well proved ought not to\nbe denied because we cannot conceive how they could be\nperformed. Deceit and fallacy will only warrant a greater\ncare and caution in examining.\" Glanvil had the warm\nsupport not only of Robert Boyle, but also of the famous\nHenry More.\nIn his record of the hauntings of the Epworth parsonage\nin 1716, and in his endeavour to get first-hand evidence of\nother supernormal phenomena, John Wesley\u2014as Mr. J.\nArthur Hill has said\n\u2014\" would have made an excellent\nmember of the S.P.R.,\" and it is certainly surprising\u2014as\nMr. Hill adds\n\u2014\" to find in an earnestly religious man of\nthat day, such as John Wesley, so much critical interest\nin our subject.\"\nComing to more recent times, the memoir of the eleventh\nDuke of Somerset, the great grandfather of our friend and\n1 Preface to From Matter to Spirit, pp. 18-20.\nExi\nhi\nfrie\nni'\nDr.\nCol\nabo\nper\nfac\nexc\nof\nFre\nesp\nof\nver\npai\nope\n\fT xcii.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 279\ns fellow-worker, Miss Ramsden, shows that the Duke was\ni,\nreally a keen psychical researcher, for he critically\nt\nexammed several psychic cases, among others the well-\nII\nknown dream of a Cornish farmer, WiUiams, who on\nif\nMay 11, 1812, woke his wife and told her that he had\ne dreamt he had seen a man shot in the lobby of the House\n0 of Commons, and described his appearance, etc. The\n1, dream was repeated, and told to several people ; sub-\ne sequently it was found that the details of the dream\nexactly corresponded with the facts connected with the\n0 assassination of Mr. Percival, the Chancellor of the\n;\nExchequer, on the eleventh May, the very evening Williams\n)f had his dream. ^ Percival's descendant\u2014my venerable\nn friend. Miss Percival \" of Chobham\u2014has also given me a\n1 written contemporary record of this remarkable dream.\na Among the Fellows of the Royal Society who warmly\nis advocated the investigation of psychical phenomena, was\nit Dr. Mayo, F.R.S., Professor of Physiology in King's\nle College, London, whose witings on the subject, pubhshed\nit about the middle of the last century, are well worth\nn perusal, containing as they do many new and interesting\na facts, which at the present day seem little known,\ny This period was also notable for the great interest\n0 excited by mesmeric phenomena. The remarkable report\nle of the committee appointed by the medical section of the\n!! French Academy of Sciences on this subject, together with\nn the amazmg phenomena to which they testify, excited\nIS widespread interest. Eminent Enghsh physicians and\nsurgeons, such as Dr. EUiotson of St. Thomas' Hospital\nre and Dr. Esdaile, presidency surgeon in Calcutta, made\n}f numerous contributions to our knowledge on this subject,\nJ. especially as regards the therapeutic and analgesic power\nit of mesmerism. Esdaile, as is weU known, conducted a\nIS very large number of major surgical operations, absolutely\ni)f painlessly, under the mesmeric trance ; and if the use of\n1 3hloroform as an anaesthetic had not been discovered\nibout this time, the value of mesmeric trance in surgical\n\\ aperations would have been universally acknowledged. But\n1 See p. 335 in Lady Gwendolen Ramsden's Correspondence of Two\nBrothers from 1809-1819 (Longmans & Co.).\n\f280 Sir William Barrett [part\nin spite of the eminence of Dr. Elliotson and others,\nmesmerism was nevertheless denounced by the profession\nas a whole, and the Lancet called it \" an odious fraud.\"\nIt was not until Braid of Manchester employed the word\nhypnotism instead of mesmerism\u2014and thus dissociated the\nsubject from Mesmer, who was more or less of a quack\n\u2014\nthat the medical profession began to treat the subject\nwith less contempt. Braid also gave a reasonable explana-\ntion of the phenomena, but subsequently this proved to be\ninadequate to account for all the facts. The valuable\nexperimental work of the continental hypnotists, and of\nour own members, Edmund Gurney, Dr. Lloyd Tuckey\nand Dr. Milne Bramwell, have now placed hypnotic treat-\nment among the recognised therapeutic agencies of the\nmedical profession.\nFoundation of the Society eor Psychical Research.\nSome twenty-five years before our Society was founded\na few of the younger Fellows of Trinity CoUege, Cam-\nbridge, chief of whom was Mr. B. F. Westcott\u2014afterwards\nthe famous Bishop of Durham\u2014started a '\nGhost Society\n'\nvery much on the lines of our S.P.R. In our Journal for\nApril last year I gave the object and the brief history of\nthis Society, which included among its members several\nCambridge graduates who subsequently became eminent, such\nas Archbishop Benson, Prof. Hem-y Sidgwick, and others.\nI will hand over for preservation among the archives of\nour Society the original document of the '\nCambridge\nGhost Club '\n(as it was called), given to me by my friend\nthe Archdeacon of Dublin.\nAs regards the foundation of our own Society, I have\ncorrected elsewhere the misunderstanding which Prof.\nRichet and others have fallen into ;\n^ and also I wrote, by\nrequest, a fuller account of the early history of our\nSociety. 2 Though it is true I happened to be the chief\ninstrument in the foundation of our Society in 1882\u2014and\nof kindred societies in Canada and the United States in\n1 See Journal oj the S.P.R., vol. xxi., October 1923, p. 139,\n2 See Light, June 21, 1924.\nS(\nai\nI\nPl\nft\ndi\nlei\n\fxcn.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 281\n1884\u2014^yet the high position and respect the S.P.R. has\nwon is chiefly due to Sidgwick, Myers, and Gurney, the\nthree great pillars upon which the edifice of our Society\nwas originally built. These eminent men were unlike in\nmany ways : Sidgwick by his adhesion to the S.P.R.\ngreatly impressed the academic world, for his influence,\nwisdom, and caution were widely recognised ;\nMyers by his\nenthusiasm, briUiant talents, and profound intuition, was\nthe corner stone of the S.P.R. till his death in 1901 :\nGurney with his industry and immense range of knowledge\nwas essential to the early progress and stabihty of our\nSociety.\nCrookes was really the first scientific man to devote his\nexperimental skill, from 1870 to 1874, to the critical\ninvestigation of the physical phenomena of spnitualism.\nIt is pitiful to think of the scientific ostracism to which he\nwas subjected and over which his genius eventually\ntriumphed. I am not, however, surprised at the Royal\nSociety refusing to publish his spiritistic investigations, for,\na few years later, my modest paper read before the British\nAssociation in 1876 was refused pubKcation by scientific\nji societies, of which I was member, on the very natural\nJ\nground that science dealt with the evidence furnished by\n1^\nour recognised senses, whereas my paper dealt either with\n.\nphenomena which transcended the usual channels of sense\nor with phenomena that transcended the material world.\nEaely Steps in Psychical Research.\nMany friends have asked me how I first became\ninterested in psychical research. Perhaps I may be for-\ngiven for relating an old story. Between the years 1862\nand 1867 I was assistant to Professor Tyndall at the\nRoyal Institution. The atmosphere surrounding my early\nyears there was entirely opposed to any belief in psychical\nphenomena. Faraday, to whom electrical engineers owe\nthe source of all their vast undertakings\u2014yet who Hved and\ndied a poor man\u2014Faraday I saw almost daily, before he\nleft the Royal Institution and went to Live at the Hampton\n\f282 Sir William Barrett [part;\nCourt Cottage given to him by the Prince Consort. I can\nnever forget the debt I owe that famous man for his\ngenerous kindness and guidance to a young ignoramus Uke\nmyself. Faraday had pubhshed about 1855 his famous\nexperiment on table-turning, showing how imconscious\nmuscular effort accounted for what he saw. A little later\nhe publicly declined to sit with the medium Home, saying\nhe had lost too much time over such matters already.\nTyndall also had denounced spkitualism as an imposture.\nBoth Huxley and Herbert Spencer were frequent visitors\nto the Royal Institution laboratory, and both of these\neminent men treated all psychical phenomena with con-\ntemptuous indiiJerence. Among other frequent visitors was\nan Irishman, Mr. John Wilson, who invited me to spend\nmy vacations at his place in County Westmeath. For a\ncouple of years I did so, and found to my astonishment\nthat Mr. Wilson was a firm behever in\u2014and experienced\ninvestigator of\u2014mesmerism, as it was then called. He\nshowed me some most extraordinary experiments upon a\nsensitive subject from his estate. I was naturally in-\ncredulous and asked to be allowed to repeat the experi-\nments myself, selecting another subject. We found a\nyoung uneducated Irish girl, who proved to be extremely\nsensitive. In the mesmeric trance\u2014in spite of every pre-\ncaution that I took to prevent deception\u2014whatever sensa-\ntions I felt, whether of touch, taste or smell, were trans-\nferred to the subject, and, moreover, ideas and words\nwhich I thought of were reproduced more or less accurately\nby the hypnotised subject. A brief account of some of\nthese experiments may be found in the first volume of our\nProceedings, p. 240.\nWhen I returned to London I repeated these experi-\nments with a couple of boys whom I found susceptible to\nhjrpnosis. These experiments revealed to me the extra-\nordinary power of either verbal or silent suggestion upon\nthe hypnotised subject. For instance, placing a pan- of\nshoes upon the table, I told one of the lads that I was\ngoing to float round the room and pointed to the position\nI was supposed to have reached near the ceiling. Then,\nclapping my hands, I suggested that I was safely back in.\n\fxcii.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 283\nmy shoes on the table. The boy stared at me with\nincreduhty and related afterwards, both to me and to\nothers, that he had really seen me floating round the\nroom. A similar result was obtained by me with another\nsubject when I was on a visit to America in 1884. Hence\nI was led to believe that spiritualistic phenomena, when\nnot fraudulent, were really due to the hallucination of the\nobserver ;\nthat, in fact, the phenomena, such as Home\nfloating out of the room or putting his hands into the\nfire, were really subjective and not objective. I had been\nin correspondence with Mr. Crookes on scientific matters so\nfar back as the year 1864, when I published in the Philo-\nsophical Magazine my first scientific research. In 1870\nCrookes began his experiments with the famous medium\nD. D. Home ; soon after this he wrote to me (in a letter\nwhich I have kept) as follows : -\n''May 14, 1871.\nDear Mk. Barkett,\nI must have some conversation with you respecting\nthese obscure phenomena. If you can help me to form\nanything like a physical theory I should be delighted. At\npresent all I am quite certain about is that they are\nobjectively true. I have had all my wits about me when\nat a seance, and the only person who appeared to be in\na state of semi-consciousness is the medium himself. The\nother evening I saw Home handling red-hot coals as if\nthey had been oranges. Will you favour me with a visit\none evening when you are disengaged.\nVery truly yours,\n;\n. William Crookes.\"\nI had several interviews with Crookes, but unfortunately\nlad no opportunity of any sitting with Home, and a year\n)r two later I was appointed to the Chan- of Physics at\n.he Royal College of Science, Dubhn. In 1874 I made\nny first acquaintance with the physical phenomena of\npiritualism, and was able to put to the test my pre-\n\u2022onceived theory of hallucination, which was gradually\nlispelled, and I became convinced of the objective reality\n\f284 Sir William Barrett [part\nof the phenomena. It so happened that one of the\nLondon weekly reviews had sent me about this time a\nnumber of books on spiritualism to review, and in a\nlengthy review I suggested the hallucination hypothesis,\nbut in a postscript added that this view was open to\nserious doubt.\nThe record of my experiments in Ireland on the physical\nphenomena of spiritualism was read before the S.P.R., and\nwiU be found in our Proceedings, vol. iv., p. 25, etc.\nI was singularly fortunate in these early experiments on\nphysical phenomena, as the mediums were personal friends,\nand the experiments took place in fvll light either in my\nown house or in that of my friends. After this lapse of\ntime I think I may mention without indiscretion that the\nname of the young medium I called Florrie was Miss Clark\n;\nher father, a leading London sohcitor, had taken a fur-\nnished house near my residence in Kingstown. The house\nbelonged to ]\\Ir. James Wilson (brother of my Westmeath\nfriend), who asked me to call on ]VIr. Clark. Mr. WUson\nwas the father of the late Commander-in-Chief, Henry\nWilson, an old student of mine. My prolonged investigation\nof Florrie Clark, in full daylight, and other experimentsi\nwith the family of the Landers (one of the leading photo-\ngraphers in Dublin), so impressed me with the supreme\nimportance of the whole subject that I determined to let\nno opportunity pass of pursuing these investigations.\nShortly afterwards I prepared a paper on the various\npsychical phenomena I had witnessed ;\nthis was accepted\nby and read before the British Association in 1876.\n^\nVerbatim reports of my paper were given both in the\nlocal and the spiritualist journals of Sept. 1876.2 Jt wil]\nbe seen from the reports of this paper that, while some\nnotable scientific men such as Dr. W. B. Carpenter vigor-\nously opposed my paper, others still more notable spoke ir\nmy support ;\nsuch, for example, as Mr. (afterwards Su\nWilliam) Crookes and the late Lord Rayleigh (both of whon\n1 The greater part of this paper (which the British Association refusec\nto publish) will be found in Proceedings of the S.P.R., vol. i., p. 23i\net seq.\n|)j\n2 These are preserved in a scrap-book, which I still have.\nfile\niliii\nlat\n\fxcir.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 285\nsubsequently became Presidents of the Royal Society), also\nthe president of the Section, IVIr. A. R. Wallace, and the\ndistinguished antliropologist Col. Lane Fox, who afterwards\nbecame General Pitt-Rivers. I may add that a warm\nletter in support of my paper was received by me from\nthe famous astronomer who subsequently became Sir\nWilham Huggins, also a President of the Royal\nSociety.i The main object of my paper was a plea for a\nscientific committee to examine the validity of the evidence\nthat I had adduced on behalf of what appeared to be\nthought-transference and other supernormal phenomena,\nespecially those relating to spirituahsm. Unfortunately, in\nthe violent dispute which followed between Carpenter and\nWallace, my resolution was lost sight of.\nFor weeks a great controversy ensued in the London\nTimes, which, like all the other newspapers (with the\nexception of the Spectator), poured ridicule upon my\ndaring to bring such a contemptible subject before the\nBritish Association. Among other of my vigorous opponents\nin The Times were Professors Lankester and Donkin (now\nSu- Ray and Sir Bryan); both of these distinguished men\nare still living and have not abated their hostihty to the\nsubject. Here it is interesting to note that in 1876 I\nventured to state m The Times that before we could hope\nto arrive at any definite conclusion as to the origm of\nspirituahstic phenomena, we must first ascertain whether\nsuch a thing as the transfusion of thought between sitter\nand medium really existed and its extent; and, secondly,\nvvhether such a thing as clakvoyance or a transcendental\nperceptive power had any foundation in fact ? Both\nthese questions have now been answered in the affirmative,\nind this renders the above caution the more necessary.\n' Book tests '\nshow that Richet's theory of cryptesthesia,\na^hich seems to be another name for clairvoyance, needs\nserious consideration. The critical examination of Stainton\nCloses' script by our member Mr. Trethewy has shown\nihat many apparently spirit communications are transcripts\n^ It is interesting to note that of the few scientific men who then had\nhe courage to support my B.A. paper, no less than four received the\n)rder of Merit.\n\f286 Sir William Barrett [part\nof some matter which had been written or printed, it\nmay be long ago, and, as a rule, only to be found m\nplaces inaccessible to the medium. Nothing seems able to\nelude the prying eyes of the transcendental self, whether\nit be incarnate or discarnate. In many sittings of to-day\nthe same thing holds good.^ For example, that exceUent\nbut illiterate medium, Sloan, of Glasgow, when m a trance\nstate will often give details concerning a sitter whom he\nhas never seen before and whose name even he does not\nknow, yet in subsequent investigation many of the facts\nstated by the medium will be found printed, either in\nWho's Who or other books to which the medium appears\nto have had no possibility of access.\nHence, with these and other facts known to us, we must\nrealize that, however trustworthy may be the evidence we\nobtain of supernormal phenomena, the interpretation of that\nevidence may in time alter\u2014as our experience grows wider,\nand our knowledge of human psychology more extensive\nand profound. Albeit I am personally convinced that the\nevidence we have published decidedly demonstrates (1) the\nexistence of a spiritual world, (2) survival after death,\nand (3) of occasional communications from those who have\npassed over.\nIt will be obvious that in the present paper I cannot\ngive even an outline of the evidence that has led me\nto the foregoing conclusions. The so-caUed physical\nphenomena afford striking evidence of amazing super-\nnormal power, but no proof of the survival of human\npersonality can be derived from them. In fact, many\npeople believe that they are simply due to the 'psychic\nforce\n'\nof the medium and sitters ;\nhowever, this is an\nopinion I do not share. Even the so-called 'ectoplasm,'\nwhich is seen issuing in certain cases from the body of\nthe medium and sometimes taking human shape, may\nbe attributed to some mysterious, unknown, and un-,\nconscious power possessed by the medium. There can be\nlittle doubt that the source of the ectoplasm is m some\nway derived from the human organism; but I believe\n1\nThe most amazing ilkistration of telesthesia, or travelling clairvoyance,\nI have ever known I hope to read before the S.P.R. shortly.\nA\ntepc\natM\nT\nrliii\ntie\ntti]\ni:\nH\nis\nI\nat\n\fJiT\nive\n^cii.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 287\nan unseen and intelligent supernormal agency external to\nthe medium causes this ectoplasm to take definite forms\nand apparent vitality. I myself have not had the oppor-\ntunity of ever witnessing these ectoplastic phenomena,\nand therefore I defer to the opinion of such experienced\nand critical observers as the late Dr. Geley, Prof. Richet,\nand others.\nPhysical Phenomena.\nAs regards the ordinary physical phenomena I have\nhad a long series of experiments with various mediums,\ngoing back to the time of Dr. Slade in 1876. Slade\nalways sat with me in broad daylight, and though I\nhave little doubt that he not unfrequently resorted to\ntrickery, yet there was also no doubt he had genuine\nand remarkable mediumistic powers ; his so-called exposure\nby Prof. Ray Lankester was quite inconclusive. Those\nwho are interested in the matter will find in Stainton\nMoses's Psydiography, pp. 104-110, a record of some of\nmy experiments with Slade, in part quoted from the\nLondon Tiines of September 1876, and also a careful\nreport written by my friend Mr. Conrad Cook, who\naccompanied me to a sitting with Slade in August 1876.\nThe only case of '\nmateriahzation '\nwitnessed by me,\nwhich seemed to be inexplicable by fraud, occurred with\nthe medium. Husk, many years ago. It may be worth\nwhile describing this experiment as it has never been\npublished.\nMr. Wm. de Morgan had kindly lent Myers and myself\nills studio in Cheyne Row, an almost bare room, furnished\nfnth a small deal table about 3 feet by 5 feet, and a\n:ew chairs. After dinner Myers brought Husk to Cheyne\nRow in a hansom cab, and we immediately sat round\n:he table. There were six present including the medium.\n^iVilham de Morgan and his sister (being sceptics), were\n^ijjlaced in control of the medium, whose feet were tied\n)0 the legs of the table, and his hands were grasped by\n'he sitter on each side. Mrs. de Morgan (their mother),\nat facing Myers, and I sat at the other end of the\n\f288 Sir William Barrdt. [part\ntable and had control of the light. After the wrists of\nall present had been loosely joined together by silk\nthread, I blew out the candle and phenomena very soon\noccurred. The medium went into a trance, lights, very\nlilte fireflies, were seen darting about over our heads,\nmovement of some objects in the room was heard, and\na deep guttural voice spoke to us calling himself 'John\nKing.' In reply to our request he said he would try\nand show himself. A violent convulsion of the medium\noccurred, and suddenly right in front of me appeared a\nclothed human figure from the waist upwards : the lower\npart of the body might have been concealed by the\ntable. The face was illuminated by a bluish light which\nseemed to issue from an object held in the hand of the\nmaterialized figure. The face was undoubtedly a living\none, for I saw its eyes open and close and its lips move ;\nI asked who it was and the guttural voice said \"John\nKing.\" It was a dark bearded and rather unpleasant\nface, quite unlike that of the medium. I exclaimed,\n\" Do you all see the figure ? I am going to light the\ncandle,\" and immediately risked doing so. The figure vanished\nthe moment the match was struck, and the medium\nwas found in deep trance, lying back in his chair and\ngroaning : when the medium had recovered he was sent\nhome in a cab. On comparing notes, each sitter described\nthe face accordmg to the different aspects it presented\nfrom his or her position at the table. We found upon\nexperimenting that it was impossible to reproduce the\nfigure by leaning over the table, nor could the medium\nhave put on a mask, as his hands were held the whole\ntime and the tying of his legs and wrists were found\nintact. De Morgan asked Myers and myseK to come\nthe next morning and see if we could in any way imitate\nwhat we had seen. Though de Morgan remained somewhat\nsceptical, Myers and I both agreed that it was extremely\ndifficult to explain the phenomena by trickery on the\npart of the medium, who, moreover, was found dee^ply\nentranced a few seconds later. \\\nWith regard to the so-called 'spirit photographs,'\nI have been extremely sceptical of their genuineness\nSCI\ntip\n1E(\n\fT xcn.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 289\nuntil quite lately. Recently, however, experiments con-\nducted by my friend Mr. de Brath, in one of which he\nkindly allowed me to take part, appear to afford in-\ndubitable evidence of supernormal psychic photography.\nThis conclusion confirms the opinion held by some expert\nand critical experimenters, who have discussed their\nresults with me. Of course faked '\nspirit photographs\n'\nabound and are easy to produce ; whilst heartless rascals\nexist who prey upon the grief of a credulous sitter.\nHealthy scepticism has therefore been inevitable and\nwise. But we shall never arrive at any knowledge of\nthe conditions requisite for these and other marvellous\npsychic phenomena, until hostile increduhty becomes no\nlonger possible. Then, as Sir John Herschel says, \" occur-\nrences which, according to received theories ought not to\ne; happen, are the facts which serve as clues to new dis-\ncoveries.\" ^\nThese disputable subjects illustrate the importance of our\nsociety recognizing the fact that a difference of opinion\n\u2014\na right and a left wing\u2014will necessarily have to exist\namong its different members. I mean that there are some\nwho have been convinced at first hand, from their own\ni){\nexperience, that the existence of certain psychical pheno-\njijimena\u2014especially those associated with spirituahsm\u2014admit of\nied\nole\nno doubt whatever, and are impatient with those who have\nnot had this experience and are therefore more inclined to\nbe cautious and even sceptical. The former class of our\nmembers wish to push forward and perhaps attach less\nimportance to conclusive experimental evidence than they\ndid at first : the latter class wish to go much more slowly\nand proceed step by step. This difference of opinion,\nthough healthy, naturally leads to a divergence of interest\nin our subject, and from time to time threatens to break\nup the solidarity of our society.\nNor must we forget that psychical research, as stated\nin the original articles of our societj^ embraces far more\nthan spiritistic phenomena, and I hope that our research\nofficers will ever bear in mind the varied objects of our\n^Discourse on Natural Philosophy, section 5.\n\f290 Sir William Barrett [part\nsociety, which will be found printed in the first volume of\nour Proceedings.\nPersonally I am very anxious that earnest attention\nshould be given to the so-called '\nReichenbach Phenomena,'\nwherein certain sensitives after long immersion in complete\ndarkness perceive a luminosity emanating from the poles of\na magnet and also from the human fingers. I have pub-\nlished in the Philoso-phical Magazine, and also in the early\nvolumes of our Proceedings, the experiments which led me\nto the conviction that such phenomena do really occur\nunder suitable conditions.\nAnother point, which I hope will sooner or later be the\nsubject of further experiment, is the question of the old\nmesmeric hypothesis of '\neffluence,' for which both Gurney\nand myseK obtained what appeared to be satisfactory\nevidence forty years ago, and which Prof. Alrutz has in\nrecent years confirmed.\nThe immediate work before us is to convince scientific\nauthorities that various types of supernormal phenomenal\ndo really exist, and are capable of experimental proof\nI do not think that the indifference of official science to\nour investigation, which has now replaced their former\nhostility, will be affected by an appeal to the emotions,\nsuch as the evidence obtained of survival after death.\nScience will approach the supernormal from an entirely\ndifferent angle ; it may possibly be pulled over the line of\nits present indifference by a growing recognition that\ntelepathy does really exist. Unfortunately, the difficulty of\nfinding suitable subjects both for telepathy and telesthesia\nis a great drawback. For this reason I am led to the con-\nviction that the first movement of thought of official science\nin our direction will occur from the impossibility of finding\nany normal explanation of the phenomena of dowsing. And\nthis subject is of all others the simplest and easiest to\ninvestigate. It has not only a wide practical importance,\nbut it raises no religious opposition, even from the most\ntimid of narrow-minded people. Moreover, the number of\nefficient dowsers can easily be ascertained and experi->\nmented with. Having devoted more than twenty years to\nthe critical investigation of this subject, I believe that ity\nlitl\nink\niieD\nm\nwl\nliif\nliic\nite\niiti\n\fT XCII.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 291\naffords the easiest and most conclusive evidence that a\nsupernormal perceptive power\u2014akin to clairvoyance\n\u2014\nexists in certain persons, of either sex, of all ages and\nall degrees of education.\nThis faculty is to be found not only in various races\nof men, but appears to exist, as a new and necessary\nsense, in many of the lower types of life. I am con-\nvinced that the mysterious migration of birds, even of\nvery young ones, over vast tracts of land and sea, and\nalso the homing instincts of many birds and animals,\nwill be found to be akin to the dowsing faculty in man.^\nDifference between Physical and Psychical\nResearch.\nThere is, of course, a fundamental difference between\nphysical research and psychical research. The former deals\nwith matter and energy, and the condition of the mind of\nthe observer, whether he be sceptical or not, is of no\nconsequence. The latter deals with the phenomena of the\nsubconscious, and the mental attitude both of the experi-\nmenter and his subject, is of prime importance. An\ninteresting illustration of the difference between the mental\nstates in the two cases occurred to me some time ago.\n[ happened to be staying in Edinburgh with that famous\nphysicist. Professor Tait, when the news of the discovery of\n:he telephone came to us by cable. I asked Tait what he\nthought of it. He replied, \" It is all humbug, for such a\niiscovery is physically impossible.\" When I asked him\nlow it was that well-known men had asserted that they\nlad heard speech transmitted a couple of miles through a\n^e, Tait replied it was \" probably a case of the con-\niuction of sound by long straight wires.\" A little later,\n;vhen the telephone was shown at the British Association\njy Sir W. Thomson (afterwards Lord Kelvin) and experi-\nnents with it were successfully made, Tait's obstinate\nncredulity did not interfere with the success of the\n!xperiment. A similar instance occurred in Paris when the\n1 See Chapter Two of my little book Creative Thought, published by\nVatkins, CecU Court, London, W.C.\n\f292 Sir William Barrett [part\nI\nif,\n101\nA\nID (\nAbbe Moigno, a well-known scientific writer, first showed\nEdison's phonograph to the Paris Academy of Sciences ; the\nAbbe himself related to me what occurred. All the\nsavants present declared, as Professor Tait did, that the\nreproduction of the human voice by an hon disc was\nphysically impossible owing to the subtle wave forms pro-\nduced by speech, though they admitted music might be so\ntransmitted. The Abbe was even accused of having a\nventriloquist concealed beneath the table. He left the\nchamber in disgust and told them to try the instrument\nthemselves\u2014which they did quite successfully in spite of\ntheir utter incredulity.\nHow different is the effect that is produced by mental\nenvironment in psychical phenomena is well known. Those\nexperienced observers, Stainton Moses and C. C. Massey,\nhave said, \" the most unfavourable disposition to take to\na medium is suspicion, and the most favourable is con-\nfidence.\" Sceptics may think that this is to deliver one-\nself over as a prey to the deceiver, and some men do\ncertainly get taken in, but experience after a time leads\nthem to discover their mistake. In the psychical world\n\"faith,\" as Mr. Massey says, \"is a condition of obtaining\nevidence, the key to the gate of the invisible world.\" By\nfaith Massey means that a sympathetic state of mind\nestablishes a rapport between the observer and the medium.\nThe fact that we need no sympathy with our instruments,\nwhen testing a physical or chemical discovery, naturally\nleads the physicist or chemist to a state of scornful\namusement, when told that his owir attitude of mind is of\nimportance in psychical research. But it appears to be a\nfact that even if at the back of our minds we entertain\nfeelings of prejudice and hostility, we can hope for little\nsuccess in psychic enquiry, however much we may disclaim\nthe feeling of hostility. This, of course, does not mean an\nattitude of creduhty or any relaxation of careful and\ncritical observation.\nAll psychical researchers need to bear in mind that\nevery sensitive or medium is a suggestible subject ;\nif you go\nexpecting fraud you may possibly create the very fraud\nyou suspect. If you make preparations beforehand to lay^l^\nICI\nrail\n\fxcn.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 293\na trap for the medium, it is probable that both medium\nand experimenter will fall into the trap.\nThere is another aspect of our enquiry, known to most\nof us \u2014^that is, that psychical phenomena largely depend\nupon involuntary and not voluntary effort, upon the sub-\nconscious and not the conscious self. Even in the simple\nphenomena of telepathy it is the subliminal self that is\noperative. Further, I believe that the common practice of\nexperimenters energetically ivilling the idea to be thought\nof, is of no value, and may indeed be detrimental to\nsuccess. In the early experiments which Myers, Gurney,\nand myseK conducted with the Creery children at Buxton\nwe found tha,t the best results occurred when no strenuous\nefforts were made. In fact, when we made the experi-\nments as amusing as possible, we had the greatest success,\nthough every precaution was taken to prevent coUusion or\nsignalling.\nAnother fact which seems to me brought out very clearly\nin our experiments is that psychical phenomena, whether\noi telepathy, clairvoyance, or the higher phenomena of\nspiritualism, are manifestations of, or through, the trans-\ncendental self of the subject, and are therefore independent\n3f the fundamental units of the physical world\u2014matter,\nbime, and space. It is true that, in the case of telepathy,\nhe mental response of the percipient to the idea in the\nigent's mind, naturally suggests the physical analogue of\n:he resonance of a silent tuning-fork to a sounding one\nivhich is in perfect unison with it. Indeed, I was inclined\nit first to think that telepathy was somewhat similar to\n:his\u2014that it was a nervous induction across space, analogous\no the weU-kno^TL facts of electric and magnetic induction.\nBut whilst telepathy has been made more conceivable, and\nnore credible to the pubHc generally, by the discovery and\nise of wireless telephony, we must remember that the two\nphenomena are wholly different. One belongs to the\nphysical order, the other to the psychical order. The laws\n'egulating the transmission of energy across space apply to\nihe one, but not to the other. Immense effort is neces-\nlary to transmit a wireless message across the Atlantic,\n)ut apparently no effort at all is required to transmit a\n\fileri\n294 Sir William Barrett [part\ntelepathic impact, of which we have instances, from New\nZealand to London. On the contrary, a passive condition\nof both transmitter and receiver in telepathy seems\nessential, so far at least as thek consciousness is con-\ncerned.\nThe word '\nthought-transference ' is apt to be mis-\nleading, as it seems to suggest a transmission of ideas\nbetween two persons across material space ;\nbut, as I said,\nspace does not seem to enter into the question at all.\nHere it may be interesting to note that in the first\npublication of the discovery of this super-sensuous faculty,\nI called it not '\nthought-transference,' but the transfusion\nof thought.'^ We are now coming back to this idea, for\ntelepathy is probably the intermingling of our trans-\ncendental selves or souls. The common and grossly\nmaterialistic conception of the soul is that it is limited to\nthe confines and contour of the body. This is surely an\nerroneous conception if, as we believe, the soul is an\nimmaterial entity, not simply a function of the brain. For\nall we know to the contrary, the human soul may spread\nthrough a vast orbit around the body, and may inter-\nmingle with other incarnate or discarnate souls. Tennyson\nspeaks of a di'eam condition, \" when the mortal limit of\nthe seK was loosed, and past into the Nameless, as the\ncloud melts into Heaven.\" Moreover the intimacy and\nimmediacy of the union between the soul and God is the\nfundamental idea, not only of the New Testament, but of\nall great Christian thinkers.\nCONCLTJSION.\nAs evidence of the great value which some eminent men\nattached to our investigations at their very outset, I will\nonly quote from a couple of letters which I received more\nthan forty years ago. That distinguished scientific man of \u00bb\nthe last generation. Dr. Angus Smith, F.R.S., writing to'^\nme in 1876, on the theoretic importance of thought-trans-\nference, remarked that \" the indications now obtained point\n1 See Proceedings, S.P.R., vol. i., p. 48, where will be found an\nextract from a letter of mine to The Times dated Sept. 1876.\nijcl\nlate,\n\u00abe\nHo;\nliri\nlow\ni\n'Eic\nfell\n\"pi\nWs\n\fxcn.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 295\nto some mighty truth more decidedly than even the\naberrations of Uranus to the newest of the great planets.\nIf we could prove the action of mind at a distance by\nconstant experiments it would be a discovery that would\n.make all other discoveries seem trifles.\" This was also the\ns^iew of that eminent biologist, Mr. G. J. Romanes, F.R.S.,\nwho, when writing to me on the same subject in 1881,\n-emarked \" if the alleged phenomena are true I hold it to\n)e unquestionable that they would be of more importance\n)han any other in the science and philosophy of our\niime.\"'\nQuite recently our former President, Professor W.\niI'Dougall, F.R.S., in his presidential address to the\n\\.merican S.P.R. speaks of psychical research as the most\nlopeful barrier against the oncoming tide of materialism,\nnd he remarks that \" a civilization which resigns itself\nholly to materialism lives upon and consumes its moral\napital and is incapable of renewing it. . . . Unless\nsychical research can discover facts incompatible with\nlaterialism, materialism will continue to spread ; no other\nower can stop it, both revealed religion and metaphysical\nhilosophy are equally helpless before the advancing tide.\"\n.s regards religion being helpless, I cannot, however, go\n3 far as M'Dougall.\nRichet's point of view, which is purely materialistic,\n3pears at first to contradict M'Dougall's remarks. We\nlow that Richet, with splendid courage and loyalty to\nuth, has avowed his belief in the most incredible psychical\nlenomena, some of which even we may perhaps hesitate\nI\naccept. But Richet's philosophy compels him to reject\nle spiritualistic hypothesis and to explain everything by\n'\nmodified psychic force theory ; a theory which was once\ncepted by Crookes but subsequently rejected by him.\nichet attributes all the subjective phenomena of psychical\nsearch to '\ncryptesthesia,' and some of the objective to\n\u2022ragmatic cryptesthesia.' i\nBut these polysyllables do not\nRichet uses this term instead of psychometry (soul measurement),\nich he rightly says is so detestable a word that he proposes to call\n\"pragmatic cryptesthesia, i.e. cryptesthesia by means of material\nects.\"\n\fBe-\nunl\n296 Sir William Barrett [part,\nhelp us any more than the names given by some learned\npsychologists who tell ns that all psychical phenomena are\nsimply illustrations of the \" exteriorised effects of uncon-\nscious complexes !\n\" One is reminded by this formidable\nnomenclature of the numerous and recondite hypotheses by\nwhich Ptolemaic astronomers tried to make their observa-\ntions square with the geocentric theory of the universe.\nTo the plain man it seems simpler, less improbable and\nmore in accordance with facts, for biologists to recognise\n\u2014what astronomers long since have done\u2014that the universe\nafter all is not explicable from the restricted view-point\neither of the earth or of the brain.

Doctor Alrutz asks :\n\" Who complains of th\nhyperaesthesia of the fingers as being 'actually distressful'?\nThe complaint has been made repeatedly by the persona\ncontrol known as A.V.B., and has been insisted upon i\nvarious ways ;\nnotably by asking that the sitters wi.\nrefrain from wearing tweed clothes with a rough surface\nThe trance personaHty A.V.B., i.e. the medium whe:\ncontrolled by A.V.B., who usually supports herself upo:\nthe sitter's shoulder, complained that the irregularities i;\nsuch material felt to her fingers like great knots and pits\nIK\nIt\n\f299\nsen.] Modus Operaridi in Mediumistic Trance\nind that the loose hairs of the stuff felt hke prickly\n3ristles.

Doctor Ah-utz asks on page 176\nthere is not ''Some evidence of Feda's knowing the\niaontents of the minds of the personal controls from the\n-\u2022\u2022ircumstance that Feda, at least on the face of it trans-\n'Ms the thoughts of the personal controls, for instance\nA.V.B. ?\n\"\nMy answer is that there is no evidence of Feda's know-\n.g anythmg of the contents of the minds of the Personal\nantrols or of entities purporting to communicate through\n3r agency, beyond that which they elect to tell her or\ntow her or in some other way deliberately communicate\n:\nher either during her control of the medium, or at\nich times as she claims to have 'been with them' m\neir post mortem surroundmgs.

He wishes to know, on page 176 : \"Is there any\nevidence that the thoughts of a certain Personal Control,\na: say of A.V.B., which Feda transmits, and the utterances\nDof A.V.B. as a Personal Control, really belong to each\n9 other or to a common personal source ?\n\" And Doctor\ns Alrutz adds : \"If there is such evidence would not this\n9 then show that Feda at times really does get at the\n01 (tninds of what we call the Personal Controls 1\n\"\ntil Now the meaning of the above paragraph in Doctor\nU ,A.hutz's paper is not quite clear to me, as it appears to\naae that it might be interpreted in two ways.\nID Does Doctor Ah-utz, when he speaks of Feda \"at times\n\"\nli getting at the minds of \"What we call Personal Controls\n\"\nE nean that she does so when they are (supposedly) con-\n;it <roUing the medium, or is he for the moment referring to\nit ihe discarnate entities from whom both '\nFeda material\n'\n111 ind '\nPersonal Control material ' purport to emanate ?\ni As I have already said, if Doctor Ah-utz is basing any\ntil uppositions upon the assumption that Feda has optional\nle iccess as eavesdropper to any Personal Control utterances,\nDi >r can tap the thoughts of an unwilling '\ncommunicator,'\n?e hen in my opinion all the evidence is against such being\nt he case. But if his question suggests that evidence of\na jimilarity of character between A.V.B. utterances retailed\n;[\nly Feda, and Personal Control utterances of the same\n^0 L.V.B., would be evidence that both had a common\n\\ ource in her surviving entity to whose thoughts Feda\nail^as occasionally permitted access for purposes of trans-\n11\n{lission ;\nthen my answer is that such evidence of one\nm haracter or personality running right tlxrough the utter-\nii nces abounds. It is one of the chief grounds upon\ni ^hich one could base a supposition that a common source\nle es behind the entire A.V.B. phenomena. The same\nii( pphes to a number of other '\nPersonalities '\nmanifesting\ntt uring Mrs. Leonard's trance, partially through the Feda\nBl ?ency and partially as '\nPersonal Controls.'\ne To discuss at any length the nature of this '\ncommon\n\f302 Una, Lady Troubridge\nK\nh\ni\nsource ' was, as I stated, distinctly outside the scope oi\nmy former paper, and is and probably will remain prema\nture, so long as the 'modus operaridi' of the trances undei\nconsideration is almost completely unknown to us. Bui\nit may possibly be of some interest to say a few words\nas to what sources are definitely insufficient in themselves u\nas wholly accounting for the entire manifestations of th(\n'\nLeonard A.V.B. Personality '\nas known to Miss Radclyffe^ id\nHall and myself after eight years of constant sittings\nwith Mrs. Leonard.\nAs was stated in our joint-paper on Mrs. Leonard'^ tl\nphenomena {Proc. S.PM., Vol. XXX., p. 339 ff.), both Mis!|\u00bb|\nEadclyffe-Hall and I were intimately acquainted witl\nA.V.B. for many years, up to the actual time of he:\ndeath, which took place fifteen months before either of ui\never saw or sat with Mrs. Leonard. We have in tha\npaper given a full accoiuit of our early investigations witl\nthat medium, and gone at length into our reasons fo\nbeUeving that no normal knowledge on her part of thi\nliving A.V.B. existed, that would account for even th\nsimpler early manifestations.\nThis belief has been consistently strengthened throughoufcn\nthe intervening years. Not only by the corroboration\nafforded by Mrs. Leonard's untarnished career of integrity\nand by the results of the investigation of her phenomen\nby the Society for Psychical Research. But by the fac i\nthat no humanly conceivable system of enquiry, observa\ntion, deduction, or of all three put together, could, in ov\nopinion, sufiice for the production of the great mass c\nverifiable utterances regarding matters known to A.V.I\nduring her lifetime, of facts and incidents regarding oui\nselves and others that were also known to her, of coi\ntemporary events and actions affecting us mentione\nduring the trances, and above all of a salient and intense]\ncharacteristic personality of which the point of view, senf\nof humour, judgment, prejudices and partialities, tl\nactual voice and laugh, in fine all those traits and pecul M\narities which go to make what we call '\nPersonahty ' a;\nso constantly characteristic of the living A.V.B. as \\\nknew her that they could not fail to be equalfcsi\nh\ni\n1\nisei\n\fi nil\nten.] Modus Operandi in Mediumistic Trance 303\necognised as such by anyone who had really known\njia-l.er.\nIt may be objected that since we ourselves knew her\no well it is unnecessary to seek beyond our minds for the\nDurce of the phenomena, assuming that Mxs. Leonard\nossesses when in trance an extensive and almost infal-\nible access to the mind of anyone present. Undoubtedly\nluch of what is uttered by the Feda and Personal Con-\nols might be obtained in this way, provided that we\nre justified in assuming an extent of telepathic faculty so\n,r hardly supported, in my opinion, by results obtained in\ni& nought-transference experiments between hving persons,\nritliy stretching our creduhty very far beyond our knowledge\nperhaps quite as far as would be necessary for the ac-\nDptance of the spirit hypothesis ?) we can assume that\nnee we have m past years heard and known A.V.B.'s\nrati pice and laugh, and have intimately known her character,\nsince that knowledge must remain sub-consciously in\ntogether with an instinctive knowledge of what would\n'\n3 her comments on and reactions to certain situations or\nimuH, all such useful content of our minds can be drawn\noon by the entranced Mrs. Leonard, and selected, sifted\nitioiid dramatised for her purposes.\njiU But I am bound to say that in absence of all proof of\nMich possibility, this theory makes my own personal\nfaceduhty feel rather like Alice in Wonderland's neck after\nera, .6 had sampled one side of the toadstool.\n1 01 1\nThat a fitful and intermittent telepathy between medium\n(\nlid sitter does operate and account for some of the\nV.liienomena produced I am practically convinced, and\non deed the fact is admitted by both the Feda and A.V.B.\n(Oiimtrols ; but I cannot bring myself to the belief that it\ninaei as extensive as is sometimes suggested by those who\niisele determined on explaining everything without recourse\n;eni\nthe spiritistic hypothesis. Even were I to admit it as\ntl explanation of all that occurs during the trance which\n,e(iil\nlid by this means be obtained from the mind of someone\nai\n3sent, this admission would not dispose of the entire\n; V.B. phenomena or account for all the evidence of\npal rsonality and Identity.\n\f304 Una, Lady Troubridge [pai\nWe should still be compelled to seek a source for tl\nresiduum, and that source is not the medium's OM^n norm\nknowledge, judgment or personality.\nIt cannot be too strongly emphasised that Mrs. Leonard\nnormal self and character do not in any way suggest *\nresemble those of A.V.B. j\nMrs. Leonard is not without a marked character ar\npersonality, her opinions are definite as are her approva\nand disapprovals, and no one knowing her at all w(\ncould call her colourless.\nA.V.B. was also a very definite personality, and\nmany ways unusual and characteristic.\nHad A.V.B. and Mrs. Leonard met in the flesh th(\nwould have liked and respected each other, I do not doul\nbut I equally do not doubt that had any intimate knoA\nledge of each other been possible they would have differe\non many matters great and small, reacted very different\nto identical stimuli, and maintained contrary opinions wii\nequal determination. I\nTherefore I declare that the source of the Leonari\nA.V.B. Personality as such is not to be found in a mere\ncoincidental resemblance to that of Mrs. Leonard, ev(\nwhen we are dealing with matter which necessitates i\nsupernormal knowledge of events or facts.\nConsideration must also be given to utterances both l\nthe Feda A.V.B. and the A.V.B. Personal Control\nsubsequently verified facts unknown at the time of utte\nance not only to the normal Mrs. Leonard but also\n\u2022\nanyone present at the sitting.\nIt is true that such utterances are not of frequent occu\nrence ; but they do occur, and cannot be ignored.\nCoincidence has been invoked and done to death in th\nconnection, but anyone who has studied the utterances f(\nas long as we have, or anyone for that matter who w:\nstudy in the Proceedings of the Society Mrs. Henry Sid]\nwick's Paper on Leonard Book Tests {Proc. S.P.R., Vc\nXXXI., p. 242 ff.) and a later paper on Experimental Boc\nTests tabulated by Colonel Baddeley {Proc.

I am unfortunately unable\nto include here any actual examples or extracts from\nrecords of sittings, as I am away from home and have\nnot access to any papers or books of reference. I am\ntherefore confined to dealing with the matter in a general\nway, which, however, I must ask my readers to believe,\ndoes not flatter the phenomena under discussion.\nIn conclusion, I should like to record here some addi-\ntional observations of the peculiarities of the trance which\nhave struck Miss Radclyffe-Hall and myself since my last\npaper was written. Since then the A.V.B. Personal Con-\ntrol has manifested frequently and regularly. It has much\ndeveloped and strengthened, and some of my earlier com-\nments must be modified, some reversed.\nThe voice of the A.V.B. Personal Control is now quite\nas strong as Feda's, at any rate during the greater part\nof the Control, which has gradually usurped nearly the\nentire sitting. Feda, as stated above, seldom appears at\nour sittings in these days save as a very brief introduction\nto the A.V.B. Control, and I think that but for our\ninsistence she might well have been dispensed with alto-\ngether for more than a year past. When, however, her\ncontrol began to shrink to its present proportions, we\nmade a definite request both to Feda herself and to the\nA.V.B. Control that Feda should always put in a pre-\nliminary appearance, however brief. We felt that any\nalteration of the customary procedure might increase the\nstrain on the medium's system, and initiate that deteriora-\ntion in her phenomena which we have observed in other\nmediums who admit of frequent, extended and various\nPersonal Controls, especially without introduction by an\n\f30G Una, Lady Troubridge [part\nhabitual Control. Moreover, Feda, as stated above, is\nalways anxious to appear and reluctant to go, retiring\nonly when the A.V.B. Control, to all appearance, renders j\nher presence impossible. The A.V.B. Personal Control \\\nnow therefore manifests practically throughout the entire i\nsitting, but the sittings are seldom of more than one hour's\nto one and a half hour's duration, the Control collapsing,\nusually quite abruptly, within that time, and giving evi-\ndence of having '\nheld out ' to the very last gasp. There-\nfore it cannot be said that even yet the A.V.B. Control\npossesses the field with quite the same facihty as Feda,\nwho has been known to chatter volubly for nearly three\nhours on end !\nI stated formerly that the percentage of evidential\nmatter given by the A.V.B. Personal Control was much\ninferior to that obtained through the Feda Control, and\nthis I think is no longer the case. In these days\nthe A.V.B. Control certainly equals Feda in the ease\nwith which evidential matter is volunteered and evi- !\ndential topics initiated, and the manner of giving these !\nby the A.V.B. Personal Control being much more\ndirect than are Feda's methods, more ground is often i\ncovered in less time. Feda still retains, either by choice\nor of necessity, her childish phraseology, and her habit of '\nelaborately describing an object which one would think t\nmust be as familiar to her as to the sitter. As it is i\ninvariably quicker to call a book a book than to describe \u00ab\nit in the '\nFeda manner '\nas \" A square thing\u2014no, not\nquite square, oblong\u2014and fiat, or nearly fiat\u2014and Feda if\nthinks it's got a hard outside of some shiny stuff\u2014wait it\na minute, cloth ? \u2014And paper, yes\u2014paper inside with print- j\ns\ning on it\u2014etc., etc., etc.,\" the A.V.B. Personal Control, in tf\nthe course of an hour's work will easily outstrip a two 6\nhours' Feda Control in the number of evidential points st\nvolunteered.\nOn the other hand, Feda holds the palm when it comes\nto answering a direct question put by the sitter. During \u00bb\nour early experiences with Mrs. Leonard, a definite question, \u00ab\neven when put to Feda, required a world of tact and judg-\nment on the part of the sitter. The selection of the ft)\n\fxcn.] Modus Operandi in Mediumistic Trance 307\nopportune moment, the manner of phrasing the enquiry,\nthe easy nonchalant tone of voice, the assurance that a\nreply was really immaterial, all these were necessary to\nobviate an immediate self-consciousness on Feda's part\nwhich would jeopardise not only the required answer but\nthe whole e^ddential current of the sitting. In these days\nthis difficulty is almost non-existent where Feda is\nconcerned. A direct question, simply asked, will often\n< ehcit an equally dii-ect answer or a suitable description.\nAt other times Feda will frankly express inability to reply,\nor will promise, and in that case generally give, a later\nanswer. All this exactly as one would do oneself in the\ni course of an ordinary conversation. But this particular\n!\nincrease of faciUty does not apply equally to the A.V.B.\nPersonal Control. A direct question will more often than\nnot strike her literally dumb, she is seldom able to give\nan immediate and direct answer, and indeed the injudi-\ncious asking of such a question will often cause some\nminutes of complete silence, and will only serve to break\nthe thread of the voluntary matter being given. This is\nhowever not invariably the case, and A.V.B. is decidedly\njj\nimproving ; in fact only recently a question as to the\n1|\nnature of a new pet that we had acquired was triumph-\nantly answered by A.V.B., who immediately wrote the\nj\nword '\nParrot '\nin printed letters on the back of my hand,\n'\nnaming each letter as she wrote it. She added, quite\ncorrectly, that it was an unusual bird in its markings,\n:\nthat it was more restless than any parrot she had ever\nseen, constantly moving to and fro sideways, and that\nj\nit appeared to slip upon its perch, of which it did not\nseem able to get a proper grip. However, in this matter\nof answering direct questions, the A.V.B. Personal Control\nis still very far behind Feda, and such a call upon her\nself-possession is not usually successful.\nAnother point mentioned in my paper, and to which\nDoctor Alrutz refers, is the long exhalation of breath which\nso often heralds the arrival, so to speak, of a personal\ncontrol.\nSince the further development of the A.V.B. Personal\nControl another curious feature connected with the me-\n\f308 Una, Lady Trouhridge [paet\ndium's breathing has been observed on several occasions.\nSome months ago the A.V.B. Personal Control expressed\na desire to learn to sit upright in her chair, instead of, as\nheretofore, lolling forward on the sitter's shoulder. This\nupright position did not appear materially to affect the\nmanifestations of the control, she spoke audibly, coherently\nand evidentially as usual. But on several occasions the\nmedium became scarlet in the face, a series of gasps was\nfollowed by moments of apparent asphyxia, and finally the\nA.V.B.

By E. E.\nFouRNiEK D'Albe, D.Sc, F.Inst.P. With a Foreword by\nSm Oliver Lodge. Pp. xix+413. (T. Fisher Unwin, Ltd.)\nWhoever should have undertaken to write the Life of Sir\nWilliam Crookes must have known that he was undertaking\na difficult task. The amount of material available was enor-\nmous : for Crookes was a man who kept documents of every\nkind, probably in a state of orderly arrangement but multi-\nfarious in scope, and of very different intrinsic value. Along\nwith papers of historical interest there were things little better\nthan domestic memoranda, such as a list of things packed for\na voyage, or a list of purchases made before coming home, or\nmemoranda of the fees obtained for professional services, or\ncorrespondence about what sort of fee it would be reasonable\nto charge : any number of letters also, many of no particular\ninterest, such as acceptances of invitations, or applications for\ntickets for ceremonials,\u2014in fact, a good deal of what might\nlegitimately be stigmatised as \"' rubbish.\" Beside all this,\nhowever, there were letters and controversies about the dis-\ncovery of thallium, attempts to deal with the cattle plague,\ncorrespondence and controversy about the radiometer,\nspeculations and predictions about wireless telegraphy, and\ndealings with diamond, gold, and radium ; some of these being\nof considerable, some of small, interest. And it must have\nbeen very difficult to decide what to include.\nOne result, perhaps an unfortunate result, of the biographer's\ndecision to include a large number of trivial documents is that\nmethods of abstracting gold, in one form or another, loom\nrather large throughout the volume, and are continually occur-\nring ; sometimes in the domain of chemistry, sometimes ap-\nproaching the realm of high finance, but rather frequently in\n\fxcn.] The Life of CrooJces 311\nthe petty details of business economy and comiiany specula-\ntions. The biographer's aim no doubt is to produce a com-\nposite portrait, and not to slur over anything that throws\nlight upon the character of his subject ; but it may be held\nthat the result is rather unfortunate. Trivial things occur in\nthe lives of all men, but they are usually taken for granted,\nnot emphasised or given a j^ermanent position in biography\n;\nso that when they are emphasised, or even recorded, these\ndetails loom larger than they ought, and rather spoil the\nbalance ; not because they are anything more than common-\nplace, but just because they are commonplace.\nWhat had to be brought out was that Crookes, by his own\nexertions, did achieve a sufficient fortune to enable him to\ndevote the main part of his life to science. Details of the\nfees which he received in consultation or in legal procedure,\nj\nafter he had established his reputation, are utterly unimportant\nand should be out of the picture ;\nthey distract attention from\nthe real business of life. Financial matters which lead to\ndisaster, or which lead on the other hand to increased facility\nfor work, are bound to be included ; but unnecessary details\nabout minor things of that sort are abhorrent.\nThe main outlines of what one would look for in the bio-\nI\ngraphy of a man of science, after dates and parentage or\ni\nancestry and educational opportunities, are such as these :\u2014\nthe circumstances which led him to take up science as a pro-\nfession or a hobby, some account of his early struggles and\ngaining of recognition, and then a vivid representation, with\ncontemporary documents, illustrating the main work of his life.\nFor the carrying out of such a task in the case of William\nCrookes Dr. Fournier d'Albe seemed eminently suitable ; for he\nhad graduated, so to speak, either literally or metaphorically,\nin both physics and psychics, and was sufficiently acquainted\nwith chemistry to appreciate the work of a great chemist.\nBut in spite of a brave, and no doubt earnest, effort to over-\n|Come the difficulties of the task, the result must be regarded\nt\nas somewhat disappointing : the outcome stril<es a reader who\nknew Crookes and his work as rather less than fair to his\nmemory. Superlatives are introduced from time to time, no\nioubt ; some more, some less appropriate ; but it can in no\nsense be called a panegyric. Possibly the biographer had not\n\f312 iS!ir Oliver Lodge [part\nmuch personal acquaintance with the subject of his memoir\nin his study and laboratory. Undoubtedly it must be very\ndifficult to form an estimate of a man from a miscellaneous\narray of letters and documents. From that point of view, the\nwonder is that it has been done so well.\nThis reviewer's own personal estimate of Crookes is suffi-\nciently indicated in the introduction which he wrote for Dr.\nFournier's book ; and it is unnecessary to add to that. He\nwould only like to testify of his own knowledge, what the\nbook perhaps sufficiently indicates, that the mutual devotion\nof Crookes and his wife can hardly be exaggerated ;\nthat they\nlived to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of their union ;\nand\nthat when she died he was inconsolable until he obtamed\nwhat he considered proof of her continued companionship. Ijs\nMl\ni\nm\nSome remarks must now be made concerning a few of the\nchemico-physical and psychic details recorded in this volume.\nOn the whole Crookes was more of a chemist than a physicist.\nHis traming had been that of a chemist ; and although he\nmade important discoveries in physics, he generally stated\nthem in such a way as to arouse opposition and controversy.\nControversy indeed ruled throughout his life, sometimes taking\na painful form. One of the most painful controversies must have\nbeen that at the Royal Institution with Sir James Dewar. It is\nmentioned in this review only to bring forward a privately known\nproof of Crookes's magnanimity : for when, soon afterwards, it\nwas proposed at the Royal Society that its highest honour, the\nCopley Medal, should be given to Dewar, Crookes, a previous\nrecipient of that medal, came out of his comparative retkement\nand earnestly supported the proposition ;\nwhich, needless to i\nsay, was carried.\nThe chief discoveries associated with Crookes's name are the\nnew element ThaUium,\u2014discovered spectroscopically and ex- iti\nhibited at the 1862 Exhibition, though even about that ill\nthere was much vexatious controversy ; the radiometer,\u2014 la\nagain with much disagreement about its mode of action ;\nthe\nspinthariscope,\u2014a useful and convenient and, as it turns out, II\nimportant outcome of experiments on radium ;\nand, chief ofId\nall, radiant matter or cathode rays or \"matter in a fourth\nstate,\"\u2014the foundation of a whole new branch of physics, and\nirt\n\fXCII.] The Life, of Crookes 313\nthe early beginning of the later discovery by others of the\nj\nelectron. It will probably be held by posterity that the\n;\nelectrical work in high vacua, part of which was summarised\nand demonstrated in his discourse to the British Association\nat Sheliield on August 22nd, 1879, marks the climax of Crookes's\n. lUfe and achievement.\nI\nThe discourse itself was rather brilliant, and passages from\nit are quoted in this volume, but the experiments in high\nvacua, by which it was illustrated, were far more brilliant ;\n1 and it is difficult to over-estimate their great and epoch-\nf I\nmaking importance. From a sort of toy, exhibited at scientific\ni soirees, the vacuum-tube rose to a position of extraordiaary\ni dignity and usefulness, and may be said to dominate the\nphysics of the latter portion of the nineteenth and the early\npart of the twentieth century.\nMembers of the S.P.R. will be able to form a good estimate\n?f the main outlines of Crookes's work by reading the obituary\nlotice by a contemporary man of science. Sir William Barrett,\nn Proceedings, (Vol. XXXI., pp. 12 to 29), with a portrait\ni ind with a useful appendix gi\"\\T.ng a list of the contributions\nio the S.P.R. by Sir William Crookes.\nith\nSo far, we have said not a word about that paiixful and\nmpopular episode or period in Crookes's life wherein he took\null advantage of exceptional opportunities olfered him for the\nxamination of supernormal phenomena, diiring the years 1871\no 1874, a period of great importance to the disciples of\n)sycbic science, and one in connexion with which they will\nIwaj^s hold Crookes and his pioneering work in high honour\nnd remembrance. But, as often happens to investigators\nato unpopular novelties, the work brought upon himself, as\na,r as the public were concerned, only ridicule, painful\nontroversy, and condemnation. He entered upon the subject\nath a light heart, he left it \\vith a heavy one. He\nnagined that by careful experimenting, and by frankness,\ne would disarm hostility and convince the scientific world,\nthers have been under a similar impression, both before\nnd since ! We now know, or at least the writer does, that\nrookes observed many things which, however incredible, were\n:ue ; and that, by aid of the unusual powers of D. D. Home\nX\n\f314 Sir Oliver Lodge [pabt\nand Florence Cook, he had opportunities for investigation denied\nto most of us. But the citadel of orthodoxy was too strong ;\nCrookes failed to storm it ; it is intact to this day, though\nbreaches have been made in its wall, or at any rate some o[\nthe garrison have deserted. But for the rest of his life\nthough he would willingly speak privately on the subject, and\nthough his convictions were quite unaltered,\u2014he no longer\nthought it necessary to incur the odium and the numerous\ndisabilities incurred by pressing the subject on his scientific\nconfreres. So, after a vigorous and stormy few years, he went\non with M-hat he considered his scientific work proper, and\ntherein achieved so much that, in spite of the hostility he had\naroused, scientific honours and medals flowed upon him ;\nand\nultimately he was even elected, though not without some\nsearchings of heart, to the Presidency of the Royal Society.\nUndoubtedly the researches of Crookes into psycho-physical\nphenomena must have been among the material which was in\nthe minds of the founders of the S.P.R., when in the late\nseventies and early eighties, Sir William Barrett (the only\nremaining livmg founder) discussed with Henry Sidgwick.\nFrederic Myers, and Edmund Gurney, together with Alfred\nRussel Wallace and probably some others, the prospects of a\nsociety which might be founded to take up that large and\nneglected field of investigation to the very existence of which\nthe long established scientific societies were blind and deai\nwhen not contemptuous. Fortunately, or so it seems, the\nfirst fruits of the Society, and indeed of Barrett's own work\non the subject, lay in the comparatively innocuous and less\nsensational direction of the kind of thought transference to\nwhich Myers gave the name \" telepathy.\" Crookes indeed,\nlater in life, rather regretted that his good fortune had not led\nhim to approach the subject from that end. At the same\ntime the more physical end seemed natural to an experimentei\nin chemistry and physics : and he probably had too little\ntraining in psychology and literature to be able to make the\nheadway which the co-operators who founded the Society did\nundoubtedly make. Nevertheless, physical phenomena are among|j|j\nthose occurrences which had been testified to again and again ;\nand they were by no means excluded from the purview of the\n^\nnew Society. Indeed a special committee was initiated from\ntien\nif.\nMy\n&(\nleer\nirpi\nf88\nlan\nIan\nas\ntos\n\\\nKOI\nlOoli\n\fxcii.] The Life of CrooTces 315\nthe first to try to carry on and complete the investigation\nbegun by the Dialectical Society in the previous decade. And\nif opportunity had offered, they would doubtless have been\nwilling to continue and develop the observations of Crookes.\nEven telepathy, however, would not have been acceptable to\nthe scientific magnates of that day. There are still some to\nwhom it is not acceptable now. And Barrett encountered\nhostility when, in 1876, he tried to read a paper on the subject\nbefore a scientific body, and offered to make demonstration\nof the telepathic powers possessed by members of a family\nwith whom he himself had made careful observations.\nThe best known of Crookes's experiments, and those which\n3aused the most outcry and derision, were the remarkable\nieries of experiments in full blown materiaUsation,\u2014for a\nicientific treatment of Avhich the time was evidently not yet\n\u2022ipe. The Florence Cook and Katie King episodes are not\nully described in this volume. A fuller extract from the\necords of the time is given by Dr. Fournier d'Albe himself in his\n)ook, published by Longmans in 1908, New Light on Immor-\nality, Chapters 2 and 3 of Part III.,\u2014a book which is well\n\u00ab rorth referring to ;\nthough it contains statements by Mrs,\n'\nloss Church (Florence Marryat) which cannot be credited, and\n0 some of which Crookes himself later gave unqualified denial\n3ee Proc. 8.P.R., XII., p. 268.)\nCrookes was the victim not so much of controversy as of\naeer denunciation ;\nhis most voluble antagonist being Dr. W. B.\narpenter, one of the learned physiologists of the time, who\n|as subsequently Registrar of the University of London,\u2014\na\nlan of weight and influence, but, as is now seen, of far less\nlan scientific caution and fairmindedness. Another antagonist\nas the eminent man of science Sir Charles Wheatstone, to\nhose inventions the early progress of telegraphy owed so much,\nn the other hand there were one or two who had already\njcome convinced of some of the facts, not only the famous\nologist, A. R. Wallace, but the well-known electricians Crom-\nell, and his brother S. A. Varley ; who indeed encouraged\n\u2022cokes to take up the subject, and assisted him in some\u00b0of\n3 early experiments Avith Home,\u2014making, among others, an\nictrical test which, though not really more conclusive than\n\f316 'Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nm\nim\nffltf\nIn\nmechanical ones, might appear more conclusive to the public\nmind. S. A. Varley was a man for whose contributions to\ncable telegraphy Lord Kelvin in later life frequently asserted\nthat he had not received a due meed of recognition and\napprobation. That by the way ; and only as showing, to a\ngeneration which has now nearly forgotten these workers, that\ntheir experimental ability was by no means to be despised.\nThere were others, of course, not so exactly in the line oi\nscientific ancestry, who countenanced these phenomena and were\nfully convinced of then- reality. And perhaps it was partlj\ndue to association with these that Crookes\u2014akeady recognisec\nas a discoverer\u2014conceived that when he found himself able tc\nadd his own first-hand testimony, and utilise the exception\nally favourable opportunities which then prevailed, his wore\nwould be received and opposition would crumble. Wisely, h(\nmade selection of what he thought would be palatable material\nhe did not seek to interest the oificers of the Royal Society-\nchief among whom was the world-famous mathematical phy\nsicist Sir George Gabriel Stokes\u2014in any of the strange anc\nultra-normal physiological and apparitional phenomena whicl\nhe had witnessed ; but he did seek to make a demonstratioi\nof the powers of Home, reduced to their bare elements, b\\\nmeans of a very simple mechanical arrangement for provmg thi ^\nexistence of an unknown force, which he called \" psychii\nforce.\" This experiment he begged both Stokes and Wheat\nstone to come to see ; but they declined, saying that if thi\narrangements were really as he described them, the thin|\ncould not possibly work. To this Crookes replied that he di(\nnot say the thing was possible or likely, but only that i\nhappened. He succeeded in getting Dr. Huggins, the astrono\nmer, to see the apparatus worldng, and also to be presen\nwhile an accordion, held in Home's hand by its dummy em\nin a cage, with its keyboard hanging down, moved about an(\nsounded its notes. But Sir William Huggins refrained froE\nconspicuously championing the phenomenon, and preferred fo\na considerable time to remain anonymous, at least so far a\nthe public were concerned. He, however, was not one of th\nofficials of the Royal Society at the time, though subsequentlj\nin due time, he became its President. .. -\nAll this, mth many other details, appears more or les\nm\nft\n0\nHD(1\n\u00ablai\n(til\ni f]\nilh\n\ffroi\nI\nMl\nxcii.] The Life of Crookes 317\nclearly in Chapter XII. of the book under review,\u2014a long\nchapter dealing with this phase in Crookes's life, \u2014and it is\nunnecessary to say more about it here ; except regretfully to\nsay that the author's treatment in a few particulars is not\naltogether fair to Crookes's memory, and not such as Crookes\nm his lifetim-e would have approved. Certain metrical state-\nments by Crookes are stigmatised as erroneous, while the still\nmore erroneous statements of objectors are cited without cor-\nrection as if they were true. There must have been a certain\namount of carelessness in this part of the book ; and the\nGenuineness of the whole affair appears to be left under a\n3loud of suspicion which is very far from being justified by the\nstatements themselves, and which by no means correctly repre-\nsents the attitude of Crookes hunself at any part of his life.\nIn this review, therefore, it seems desirable to call attention\nio the particularly simple experiment above mentioned, and\n)oint out some of the gratuitous errors which, judging from\n-he text, were made at that time by critics of importance.\nJnimportant and anonymous critics did not hesitate to ridicule\nhe whole thing ; that is only to be expected, and is of no\nnoment, but what responsible scientific authorities say, at any\n)eriod, is historically important, and, if uncorrected, is natur-\n% taken as accurate. The foUowuag remarks, therefore, may\nerve as a summary and supplement to this part of the book.\nCrookes arranged an apparatus of the simplest possible land\na order to verify that an unknown force actually operated,\nnd in some sense to record and measure its amount. Tor\nhis purpose he arranged a horizontal mahogany board three\n3et long, 8 1 inches wide, and 1 inch thick ; with one edge\nupported on the edge of a table, and the other end sus-\npended by a registering spring- balance, hung from a firm\nripod stand. The medium was seated at the table and his\nands were placed lightly on the fixed or fulcrum end. The\n3sult was that after a time the board tilted down, and the\nalance at the other end indicated that its spiral spring had\neen stretched as if loaded by a weight, sometimes as much\ns from 3 to 6 lbs. He also made a registering apparatus,\n'ith smoked glass moved by clockwork, so that a trace should\ne recorded, indicating by objective and permanent record the\nmount of the force at different times. All this was pubhshed\n\f318 Sir Oliver Lodge [paet\nin The Quarterly Journal for Science for July 1871, and con-\ntinned in October 1871, with confirmatory testimony by Sir\nWilliam Huggins and Serjeant Cox. The testimony was later\nreiDroduced, with an appendix of correspondence illustrating the\ncontroversial reception the experiment met with, in a book\ncalled Researches in Spiritualism, which appears to be now out\nof print.\nThese experiments are referred to in the volume now under\nreview, page 218 and thereabouts. To avoid the suspicion\nthat the medium, when touching the board, might trespass\nbeyond the fulcrum and be surreptitiously pressing with ex-\nceptional violence, so as to produce a force comparable to a\npound weight or more at the far end of the lever, Crookes\nmarked the position of Home's fingers on the board, and\nsubsequently placed on or near the fulcrum a vessel of water,\ninto which the medium was to dip his fingers without touching\nthe board at all. And to avoid accidentally or purposely\ntouching the rim or sides of this vessel, he arranged above\nit another water container, a sort of copper bowl, fixed to an\nindependent support ; the bowl being (unfortunately and\nperhaps unnecessarily) perforated at the bottom so that water\nin the bowl communicated with the water in the vessel below\nand the medium only dipped his fingers into this upper copper\nbowl, shown in an illustration on page 220 of the book.\nBut stiU the spring balance at the far end of the lever, now\nuntouched except through water, exhibited a force of nearly\na pound.\nThe most absurd arguments were used agamst these experi\nments. For instance, a writer in the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute says that, though Crookes's evidence practically shows\nthat the board apparently weighed only 6 lbs., it ought, from\nits size and from the specific gravity of mahogany, to weigh\n13 lbs. ; he therefore indicates a suspicion that the board was\na trick board, supplied by the medium ! To which Crookes,\nrepHed that the board had been in his possession for years,\nthat it had already formed part of several previous pieces ol\napparatus, and that, whatever it ought to weigh, it did actually \u201e(\nweigh only 6 lbs.\nAnother objection, more responsibly made by Sir Charles\nWheatstone, was that a water connection was no guarantee [f(\nIs\nlio\"\nso:\nMB\n\u00abet:\nm\nh\nItCO\n(IB f\ntfrj\nrtl\nsrei\nIf\n\fxcii.] The Life of Crookes 319\nagainst the exertion of force, since\u2014so he argues\u2014if only\n3 cubic inches of water were displaced by the fingers, it would\nby hydrostatic laws be equivalent to a pressure of from 12\n\"to 13 ozs., or nearly a pound. This arithmetical error is\nreproduced on p. 219 of The Life of Crookes without correction.\nAs a matter of fact the weight of three cubic inches of water\nis only an ounce and threequarters ! This matter, though\napparently trivial, is historically important because a special effort\n\" was being made to interest the Royal Society. In its early\ndays the opportunity for witnessing such an \"absurd\" ex-\nperiment would have been welcomed by the Society ; but\nnow, ui its later dignity and immense loiowledge, it is repelled\nby the apparently impossible. Crookes is accused by his\nbiographer of having, in this crucial instance, made a faux\npas, with serious consequences to Science. It is not really\nso :\nthough m his original description he probably had a\nIj\nmomentary lapse, and had expressed himself with less than\n\u00ab imeticulous accuracy. He was not a professor of Physics. When\n\"\nhe came to reply to objections, he might have admitted the\nhydrostatic argument and at the same time attacked the\nerroneous arithmetic ;\nbut, instead, he contented himself with\na, demonstration that as a matter of fact no appreciable\niefiexion of the lever could normally be caused in that way,\n3ven when the bowl was not exactly over the fulcrum.\nBrookes expressly states that dipping his whole hand to the\nl;\nlull extent in the upper bowl of water did not produce the\neast appreciable action on the balance at the other end\njf the lever. This is in accordance with common sense.\nThe whole weight of a man on the fulcrum would not\ni^liccoimt for the stretching of the spring. That the weight of\nwhatever water was displaced would give some extra pressure\nm the fulcrum is true enough, but that this effect would be\n'3 rery small is obvious from the picture of the apparatus, and\nlothing appreciable could normally reach the far end of the\n\"lever.\nWheatstone's concluding comment, when this was pointed\n>ut, was that it appeared to him contrary to all analogy that\n-ny force, acting according to physical laws, should produce\nhe forcible depression of a lever by acting on its fulcrum !\nt\u00ab\n?o which Crookes replied that he entirely agreed ; that that\n\f320 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nwas the whole gist of the experiment, and the only reason he\nregarded it as worthy of attention. \\\nThe episode illustrates one of the difficulties which is bound\nto be encountered by investigators of novel physical phenomena.\nIf a new kind of force is exerted, the experiments are almost\nbound to be surprising and, so to speak, incredible\u2014so in-\ncredible that responsible leaders in science may be unwilling\nto subject themselves to what they regard as the farce of at-\ntempted demonstration. As in Galileo's time, they may refuse\nto look through the telescope ;\nor, if they do, may regard it as\na deceptive instrument. Many Continental investigators, and\nsome in this country, are now inclined to suppose that the\nforce in these and other more striking instances of telekinesis\nis due to or is associated with the mechanical intervention or\nemployment of an invisible previously unknown material,\nprobably emanating from the medium, in the form of what we\nnow call ectoplasm,\u2014a form of substance which was then not\nrecognised or perhaps suspected by anyone. Nothing but\ndirect observation and instrumental confirmation can establish\nsuch things as realities ; and in the absence of theory ex-\nperiment must always be scrutinised with exceptional severity.\nA plausible theory need not jump into existence at the same\ntime as new facts are observed ; but until there is some guiding\ntheory or clue the facts seem detached from organised science,\nand are rebutted and disbelieved on theoretical grounds. Dis-\nbelief is only natural, and its foundation in common sense is\nrather like a modified version of David Hume's arguments\nagainst miracles, viz. that it is more likely that a witness\nshould he than that a miracle should happen ; because the one-\nis consonant with human experience and the other is not.\nThat is quite true ; but if the thing really does happen, and\nif it can be shown contemporaneously to happen, the\nargument has no weight ; the facts, when proven, are them-\nselves an expansion of human experience ; and they clearly\nestablish the need for overhauliiig and enlarging our theoretical jj\nh\nfoundations. Things that are unlikely may nevertheless be\ntrue. Our knowledge of nature is not so extensive that we\nare able to say beforehand what is possible and what is not\npossible in a novel region of enquiry. That is where even\nFaraday\u2014that prince of investigators\u2014made, in an obiter\n\fXCII.] The, Life of Crookes 321\n; dictmn, one of his few mistakes. The history of science is too\nmuch disfigured by the premature rejection and contempt with\n1 which novelties have often been received. They are accepted,\nin the long run, by some subsequent generation ; but the re-\nt sponsible generation living at the time does not rise to the\nheight of its opportunities. Contemporary men of science\nI\nunfortunately write themselves down, not only as ignorant,\nwhich was inevitable, but as blind and prejudiced and sadly\ne bigoted : though it is true that in their lifetime their contemp-\ns tuous attitude gains them credit for robust common sense and\n1 sanity. They are wise, therefore, in their day and generation,\ne It is singular, and perhaps depressing, that the obscurantist\ne attitude of theologians in the past had been so amply imitated\nIt by the pontiffs and high priests of science in the recent present.\nI, They still oppose their admirable theories aiid great knowledge\ne of the universe to resist the incursion of fresh information ;\nit they oppose observed facts on a priori and utterly inadequate\nit grounds. No one ought to consider his knowledge of the\ni universe so complete and final as to be competent to negative\ni- careful testimony based on critical and responsible experiment\nr. and observation, especially if the observer has already proved\nle his competence in more recognised branches of knowledge,\nij Explanatory hypotheses may be criticised severely, but the\ne, facts demand attention.\ns- In the light of our present or subsequent knowledge, his-\ntorical rejections of truth, and inability to recognise the value\nof testimony, or even to accept a chance of being convinced\nby actual experience, tend to arouse our impatience ; but\nthere is some excuse. Most of the orthodox facts of to-day\nhad to encounter similar opposition at their entry, and were at\none time heterodox. It has been said that even scientific fact\nis not generally accepted until it becomes a habit ; and, as\nillustrating pardonable and natural scientific scepticism, it\nmay be instructive and helpful to quote here from an old\nletter from a scientific friend about Crookes's experiments,\npreserved and cited with approbation by Crookes himself :\n\u2014\n\" Any intellectual reply to your facts I camiot see. Yet it\nis a curious fact that even I, with all my tendency and\ndesire to believe spirituahstically, and with all my faith\nin your poAver of observing and your thorough truthfulness.\n\f322 Sir Oliver Lo^ge [part\nfeel as if I wanted to see for myself ; and it is quite\npainful to me to think how much more proof I want. Painful,\nI say, because I see that it is not reason which convinces a\nman, unless a fact is rej^eated so frequently that the impres-\nsion becomes hke a habit of mind, an old acquaintance, a\nthing known so long that it cannot be doubted. This is a\ncurious phase of man's mind, and it is remarkably strong in\nscientific men,\u2014stronger than in others, I think. For this\nreason we must not always call a man dishonest because he\ndoes not yield to evidence for a long time. The old wall of\nbelief must be broken down by much battering.\"\nThe fact that Crookes fully adhered to his exceptional ex-\nperiences, throughout his life, is sufficiently plain to members\nof the S.P.R. from his \"Notes of Seances with D. D. Home,\"\nwritten for the Proceedings of the S.P.R. in 1889 (see Vol. VI.,\npage 98 et seq). Also from his holding the Presidential Chair of\nthe Society for three years, 1896-1899, and from his Presiden-\ntial Address to the Society in 1897 (see Proc. Vol. XII., page\n338).\nWhile, later still, in the critical and quite unprivileged\natmosphere of the British Association, when he was President\nof that body at its Bristol meeting in September 1898, the\nconcluding portion of his address speaks of \" one interest\n\"\nwhich to him was \" the weightiest and the farthest reaching\nof all,\" and continues :\n\u2014\n\" Thirty years have passed since I published an account of\nexperiments tending to show that outside our scientific know-\nledge there exists a Force exercised by intelligence differing\nfrom the ordinary intelligence common to mortals. . . .

(Leipzig, 1924.)\nThe importance of a new contribution to human knowledge\ncan often be estimated by a consideration of the attacks\nmade upon it by the learned world. The scientific mind is,\nunfortunately, only too often divided into watertight com-\npartments, and presents the strange spectacle of the true and\nthe false, the sublime and the ridiculous, all flourishing under\nthe same mask of a united personality. In the ordinary\nsciences of to-day, religion has but little influence. The\nbiologist does not fear that by presenting his work he is\nencroaching upon the domain of the Almighty, neither does\nthe geologist regret that his results do not appear to tally\nwith the statements in the Book. Facts concerning natural\nphenomena are now only condemned for these reasons in such\nplaces as Kentucky or the Kingsway HaU, whilst serious\nminded people smile quietly and pass on. But in psychical\n\fxcii.] Telekinetic and Teleplastic Mediumship 325\nresearch the scientist joins the priest, and the philosopher the\njournalist in deriding phenomena just as real and objective as\nthe meteor or the eclipse. As long as reports were confined to\nthe novelist or to the seeker after wonders, the learned ^^'o^ld\ncould afford to smUe disdainfully and proceed on its way,\nbut when the facts were reported by men of science them-\nselves the case assumed quite a different complexion. The\nr more important the record the greater the attack, and the\nmore virulent the abuse from all quarters. Even if in England\nwe have failed to realise the importance of Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing's contribution (I), in. Germany the attacks made upon\nit reflect great credit upon its author. For the truth is that\nit is by far the most important work on telekinesis since\nthe S.P.R. Report on Palladino or Dr. Ochorowicz's observa-\n^\ntions on Mile T. Tom from the centre of spiritistic circles\nin which he was becoming rapidly hardened through the\ntraditions of the tune, young WLUy Schneider was taken by\nDr. von Schrenck and educated with a view to a single\n,\npurpose. That goal in brief was to train the mediumistic faculty\nso that the same phenomenon could be repeated under the\nsame conditions at specified times and before varying observers.\nIt is in the achievement of this purpose that the importance\nof Dr. von Schrenck's record may be said principally to lie.\nThe methods of control and the phenomena observed are\nsubstantially the same as those described in the Journal for\ne October, 1922. Control consists broadly in the holding of\nthe medium's hands and wrists by two persons and the out-\nlining of his body by luminous pins. Phenomena occur usually\n1 m. 10 cm. from the medium and are not hindered by the\npresence of an intervening gauze screen. Four methods were\nused : (A) the medium within a gauze enclosed structure and\nthe objects to be moved upon a table in front of the observers,\nie (B) The medium sitting freely in a chair and the objects enclosed\n']3\nwithin a gauze cage about 1 m. 10 cm. from the medium. (C)\n:S The medium and the objects being 1 m. 10 cm. apart, the latter\nbeing separated from the observers by a four-winged gauze\nscreen. (D) The medium and sitters being entirely cut off from\ni the objects by a gauze enclosure. In all these four cases the\n]S medium is held by two persons as described above. {8ee I.,\nal Abb. 3-6, p. 43.) - ....... . ...= ..\n\f326 E.J. Dingivall [part\nBesides printing an account of his own sittings, Dr. von\nSchrenck records those held in the Psychological Institute\nof Munich University. The same phenomena were witnessed\nrepeatedly under the same conditions and, as far as can be\ngathered from the reports, no member of the examining com-\nmission came to unfavourable opinions as to the authenticity\nof the phenomena presented. The record is mainly one of\nimpressions and observations. Fresh experiments were not\napparently encouraged if we except the tunnel apparatus\ndescribed on pp. 11, 12. In his attempt to describe the pheno-\nmena Dr. von Schrenck leans towards the hypothesis of\nteleplastic structures proceeding from the medium (pp. 44, 47,\n49), a theory to which colour is lent by the fact that the\nmesh of the gauze is opened when the objects are separated\nfrom the medium (pp. 46, 47). Similarly the experiment\nwith tissue paper described on p. 48 supports the same hypo-\nthesis, and the observations printed on pp. 14, 16, 23, 46 and\n163 will especially interest those few amongst us who have\never attempted to examine the physical phenomena from this\npoint of view.\nRecognising the immense importance of the book and the\nunanswerable character of the records, German students who\nhad the reputation of being hard-headed sceptics set about to\ndevise suitable replies. At least two avenues of attack were\nopen. One was to declare that the whole thing was ridicu-\nlous, a preposterous and futile farce which could be left un-\nnoticed. Professor Karl Marbe adopted this course and\n(incredibile dictu) the Preussische Jahrbiicher opened its columns\nin hospitality (II). Beginning with Steiner he passes to the\nsideric pendulum and the divining rod, proceeding to teU us\nthat \" up till now there is not the slightest proof of telepathy\n\"\n(p. 53). From telepathy Professor Marbe passes to Dr. von\nSchrenck, but obviously cannot find any flaw in the control\nor in the results. He therefore resorts to ridicule and aspersions\nconcerning WiUy's character and conduct. Finally in a burst\nof almost hysterical frenzy he thus describes the book. It is,\nhe says, only \" ein Album der Blamage, sondern auch als\neine Publikation, die mit den wahren Interessen des Volkes\nim Widerspruch steht \"\n(p. 59) [not only a publication which\nmakes the author ridiculous, but also one which conflicts\nI\n\fxcii.] Telekinetic and Teleplasfic Mediumship 327\nI\nwith the true interests of the people]. Dr. Hellwig is calmer\nI\nthan Professor Marbe (III). He has read the book sine ira\n{\net studio and has made \" hundreds and hundreds of critical\nI\nnotes,\" but unfortunately, he gives us no striking example\nof them, contenting himself with vague complaints, such as\nr the lack of light and Willy's aversion to apparatus. The\n[\nsecond avenue of attack was adopted by Prof. Henning (IV).\n\\ It consists essentially in the production of a person Avho can\nj\npresent aU the phenomena of Willy Schneider under the\n. same control conditions and yet manage to produce them\n[ I fraudulently. Professor Henning has accomplished this grand\nfeat. He has discovered a Russian medium whose name he\n3\nforgets to give us. This person, under the full light of three\n\\ I\nhalf-watt lamps of sixty candle power each, works in the centre\n[ I\nof the investigators. Objects, such as a large book, a tray,\n,. a china plate, a newspaper or a walking stick rise into the\nJ\nair at a distance from the medium and float to any observer\nJ\nat command. A cigarette case opens itself and a cigarette\ns\nfloats out of it finally settling in the medium's mouth. The\nphenomena are just as good if the medium's hands and feet\ng are held. Control of the medium's person can be insisted\nD\nupon not only before and after the sittings but at any time\nQ\nduring the production of phenomena. None of the observers\ng\ni could explain the manifestations, and no confederates were\n[.\nnecessary, \" nur zwei fast mikroskopische kleine Behelfe \" [only\n[.\ntwo almost microscopic little devices] M^hich could be used\nij\n,\nwithout the help of hands, feet or head.\nu !\nProfessor Henning's contribution to the Zeitschrift fiir Psyclio-\nj\nlogie may be interesting to those engaged in the analysis of\nIJ\ndreams according to the Freudian interpretation. But as a\nI practical contribution the story is spoilt by Professor Henning\nII\nrevealing some of the amazing methods of this modern Yogi.\n\u201e1\nThe first device is a piece of thread on the end of which is\nJ,\na ball of wax and the second is a soup spoon in the sleeve\nfor levitating a table\u2014but we will not continue. It will merely\nJ\nsuffice to add that this amusing skit by Professor Henning\nhas actually been taken seriously in Germany in the same way\n^j\nas Dr. Mercier's Spirit Experiences was accepted in certain\n,|j\nquarters in England. Professor Max Dessoir published a\nIj\nlaudatory article in the Vossische Zeitung (V). He proposes\n\f328 E. J. Dingivall [part\nthat Willy shall be tested by Henning's Russian medium, but\nwe fear that the latter is even more shadowy than the phan-\ntoms produced by the former. The fact alone of Henning's\nskits being treated seriously by such a prominent scholar as\nProfessor Dessoir indicates the amount of animosity prevalent\nabroad on the subject of Baron von Schrenck's experiments\nwith Willy Schneider. For the experiments form a solid basis\nupon which to work, and Baron von Schrenck was indeed\nfortunate to obtain the help of such a medium as Willy\nSchneider. The easy and at the same time efficient methods of\ncontrol are typical of what can be done with a good medium\nfor telekinesis.\nHow different are the problems presented by teleplastic\nmediumship ! In the one case control is simple if only the\nmedium can be persuaded to consent to it. In the other\ncontrol is difficult even when the medium offers himself ap-\nparently unreservedly. In my discussion of the problems\ninvolved in the case of Eva C.^ I tried to point out how\ndifficult it is to prevent objects being smuggled into the\nseance room despite the utmost vigilance on the part of the\ncontrollers, and Dr. von Schrenck in his turn criticised my\nobjections in the Proceedings for 1923. In the first paragraph\nof that criticism Dr. von Schrenck compares his experiments\nwith Eva C. with those with WHly Schneider. But the com-\nparison is, I think, invalid, since telekinetic mediumship differs\nentirely from teleplastic mediumship in methods of control.\nIn dealing with the control of WUly Schneider I have said\nelsewhere that my objections to the Baron's control of WUl}''\nwould be as strong as those against his control of Eva C.\nwere Willy to sit for telejilasm.\"^ There is no doubt whatever\nin my own mind that Eva C, Willy Schneider, Jan Guzik,\nPasquale Erto, etc., can bring objects into the seance room in\nspite of the control exercised in Munich, London or Paris.\nMoreover the recent case of Erto shows quite conclusively\nthat such is the case in at least one instance. But the im-\nportant point to emphasise is not what the mediums can\nbring in, but what use they can make of what they do bring\nin. Willy no doubt can bring in a telescopic rod, but of what\nuse is it to him ? None whatever. With telekinesis the con-\n^ Proceedings, 1922, 309-331. ^Journal, 1922, p. 370,\n\fr XCTI.] TeleJcinetic and Teleplastic Mediumship 329\ntroUers can prevent mediums using their apparatus presupposing\nsuch to be brought with them. With teleplastic mediumship\nthe apparatus is the phenomenon. Judgment must not be\nfounded upon a sure control, although a good deal can be\ndone in this direction. It must seek a firmer basis upon the\nappearance and (above all) behaviour of the phenomenon\nitself. A dummy hand swathed in cotton wool does not behave\nlike that described upon p. 678 of Professor Richet's Traite\nde Metapsychique {2\" ed.), neither does a dummy head resemble\nthat mentioned- by Dr. Geley on p. 13 of the Bulletin of the\nInst. Gen. -Psychol. (Nos. 1-3, Paris, 1918). But since we\ncamiot dictate as to what supernormal phenomena must or\nmust not resemble, the case becomes even more complicajted\n.\nAnd in this very complication lies part of the secret of the\ntragic and at the same time farcical story of Ladislaus Laszlo\n(VI). Laszlo was an electrical artisan and is generally con-\nsidered to be neuropathic. lii December 1921 he made the\nacquaintance of M. WUhelm Tordai, who was legally con-\nnected with the Finance Ministry at Budapest. Asking to\nbe investigated, Laszlo attracted the attention of M. Tordai\nwho became convinced of the authenticity of the phenomena\nand formed a circle for their investigation. The conditions\nwere the same as those usually obtaining at such experiments.\nBefore the sitting Laszlo changed his clothes, donned a bath-\ning costume and occasionally took a bath. The cabinet and\nsurroundings were also said to be carefully examined. Dim\nwhite light was used together with red light or sometimes\ntotal darkness. Besides producing alleged teleplasm, luminous\nphenomena were observed. In this connection it is interesting\nand highly illuminating to read the accounts of the observers\nbefore the exposure. I select the following passages and\ntranslate them verbatim.\n' Luminous phenomena appeared, at first close to the\nmedium's body but latterly at a distance of several metres\nfrom him. The size of these lights varied from that of a\npea to that of a pigeon's egg. At times these lights moved\nin rapid zig-zag lines resembling comets. . .\n.\"\n\"A trembling of the Avhole body then set in. The hands\nand feet become cold. Saliva in abundance drops to the\nground. After the flow of saliva there emerges from the\nmouth a band of plasma 3 cm. broad and 20 cm. long.\"\n\f330 E. J. Dingwall [pakt\nOn April 24th, 1923, a special test took place. The medium\nwas stripped, searched, and taken to a special room con-\ntaining the minimum of furniture. A purgative was adminis\ntered, the stomach j)ump was employed and he was watched j |\nfor twenty-four hours before being taken to the seance room.i* is\nAt the sitting four photographs were taken of alleged tele- :\nplasm emergmg from the mouth. They show a strip 5 to: i\n6 cm. broad and 60 to 70 cms. long. At other sittings the I\n[a\nmedium wore . a veil as in the case of Eva C. The director k\nthus describes the phenomenon. I 51\n\" At this experiment I had shpped my hands under the\nveil, separating it with forefinger and thumb and keeping it\nas far away from the mouth of the medium as possible. With ']\nthe surface of my hand I controlled and guided involuntarily\nthe movements of the plasma. This time again, we could\nclearly observe, in the red light, the withdrawal of the sub- ; f\nstance through the veil and afterwards ascertain that the veili' la\nwas intact \"\n(p. 6). Mi\nIn criticising this account Baron von Schrenck compares the !\nphotograph with those taken with Eva C. and Stanislawa P.\nHe declares that with Eva the mouth is wide open and\nthe veil is not drawn into the cavity whilst with Stanis-\nlawa a small portion of the substance is seen inside the\nveU.i\nHow far Baron von Schrenck is correct in this assertion\nI am not prepared to say. During the sittings with Eva in\nLondon it was observed that the veil was drawn into Eva's\nmouth, and I published a statement upon that very point.^i;\nMoreover it appears to me that in Fig. 155 the veil is again i\ndrawn into Eva's mouth, and I cannot think that the case of\n^\nStanislawa P. can be called conclusive from the fact that a\nportion of the substance is seen behind the mesh apparently\ninside it.\nThe apparent vitality of the substance was also noticed by\nthe Hungarian observers. With red light falling directly upon\nthe plasma a piece was seen upon the ground at a distance\nof 60 cm. from the medium. \" As if attached to an invisible t\n\u2022 See Materialisations-Phaenomene, 2\" Aufl., figs. 155, 213.\n^Proceedings, 1922, p. 322.\n\fi\nr| xcn.] Telekinetic and Teleplastic Mediumship 331\nthread, it crawled to his feet, climbing up the body and dis-\nappeared into the mouth.\" ^\nUpon other occasions the observers handled the substance.\nThe report reads : \"A few seconds later, the white, cold and\nfoam-like plasma which lay on our hands withdrew into the\nmedium's mouth \"\n(p. 7). Upon hearing of the marvels Baron\nvon Schrenck visited Budapest and had four sittings with\nLaszlo.\nIn his published accounts it is clear that he was far from\n]\nsatisfied with the phenomena and general conditions. Indeed\ni at the conclusion of the series, he wrote to M. Tordai expres-\nsing his uncertainties. He advised him to so seize the pheno-\nmenon and ascertain its real nature. M. Tordai, however,\n]y\ndisregarded his advice and gave a lecture upon Laszlo 's medium-\nship. A professional showman was present at the lecture, and,\napproaching Laszlo offered him an engagement. To him\nLaszlo confessed that the whole thing was fraudulent, and\nproofs of his guilt were finally established. One of the\nsitters '\nhad assisted him and examples of the substance in\nthe shape of old pieces of muslin soaked in fat, etc., were\ndiscovered.\nIn Dr. von Schrenck's pungent criticism of the case two\nprincipal points are raised. His first objection is that the\nproducts were so artificial in appearance that they had to be\nregarded with extreme scepticism. Now it is clear from the\npassages I have quoted above that the Hungarian observers\nwere quite convinced of the authenticity of the phenomena\neven though they themselves may have noticed marks of\nartificiality. It is to be remarked that they reported self-\nmobility, change of form and the passage of the substance\nthrough the veil. Indeed from their reports it is difficult to\nunderstand how the deception was carried on unless we re-\nmember the religious atmosphere of the performances. Passages\nfrom the Bible were read and the medium's guide, \" Dr. Grunhut,\"\ngave salutary advice. The circle had instituted the best\n^ Cf. Mat.-Phaen., Figs. 128 and 130 where in the one case the sub-\nstance lies on the medium's chest supported by a black thread from\nthe mouth and in the other (the second photograph) the same appear-\nance is seen suspended from the breasts, the black thread being entangled\nwith it.\n\f332 E. J. Dingioall [part\nI\ncontrol they could devise and it can scarcely be contended\nthat it was not severe. It is true that it was totally in-\nefficient, like that of the medium Erto, but it was the best\nthese inexperienced observers could suggest. In spite of\nall the medium succeeded in smuggling in his apparatus.\nEven the artificial appearance of the products cannot be\nconsidered proof of their normal origin. Dr. von Schrenck\nhimself would scarcely deny, I think, that certain of the pro-\nductions of Eva C. and Stanislawa P. suffer from the same\nobjection. The answer to this point Dr. von Schrenck him-\nself i^artly furnishes when he speaks of the control of the\nhands. For if the hands are held then the arrangement of\nthe products becomes a matter of some difficulty. Laszlo's\nhands were sometimes held and sometimes not. Often the\nhands were free behind the curtains between the appearance\nof different phenomena.^ Scrupulous, though inefficient, in\nthe bodily control, the Hungarian enquirers failed to perceive\nthe enormous importance of the hand-control. It is this\ninability to discriminate the important from the unimportant,\nnot only in actual sittings but in considering the literature\nof the subject, that is at the root of many of the difficulties\nof psychical research. For if observers camiot distinguish the\ndifferences between, we will say, the phenomena of WiUy\nSchneider and those of Palladino, or of Laszlo and Eva C,\nthen the results can never be accepted by serious students\nThe history of Laszlo is not more incredible than the amazing\nperformances of Eldred whose exploits were the wonder of\nthe spiritualistic world for some two years. A solid basis\nfor our work can only be found in such laborious series of\nexperiments as those conducted by Baron von Schrenck with\nthe medium WUly Schneider. If this series contrasted with\nthe Laszlo series teaches us anything, it is the radical differences\nof treatment necessary in the investigation of telekinetic and\nteleplastic mediumship.\niCf.

Translated from the French by Stanley\nDE Brath, M.I.C.E. (London: Methuen & Co. 1923.\nPp. xi, 245. 15s. net.)\nDr. Osty is a French medical man who published in 1913 a\nwork on Lucidity and Intuition, embodying what he had learnt\nby \" three years' experimental study of the strange faculty\npossessed by certain persons of revealing the course of an\nindividual life, and that without regard to the normal exercise\nof their intelligence, to information from then* ordinary senses,\nand to the insuperable obstacles which time and space put in\nthe way of our ordinary perception,\" and sums up his sub-\nsequent researches in the present book. These, he claims (p.\nvii), show that supernormal cognition is producible at will,\nindependent of beliefs and faith in witnesses, and is susceptible\nof exact observation and indefinitely repeated experimentation.\nIt can hardly, however, be maintained that he succeeds in\nmaking good this very large claim. For, though his book is\nreadable and full of interesting stories, and no one after reading\nit could doubt either his good faith, his ingenuity, or his en-\nenthusiasm, it is disappointing to find that his method of\n'\nexperimenting '\nis merely that of consulting the oracle of the\nprofessional clairvoyants who seem to abound in France, and\nrecounting their successes with a considerable display of\ntechnical terminology. This method may be repeatable in-\ndefinitely, and even ad nauseam, but it hardly deserves to be\ncalled '\nexperiment ' or even '\nprecise observation,' and correct\n^ Mr. de Brath translates \" revealing the sequences of individual lives\nindependently of normal intelligence, of normal sensorial information,\nand also of the unavoidable obstacles \". . . , a rendering which reveals\nthe chief defect of his translation. It is adequate, though not always\naccurate, in ordinary narrative (as when on p. 234 he translates '\ngros\n'\nand '\nwOTce ' by 'big' and 'small'), but tends to become obscure in\ntheoretical passages.\n\fI\n334 F. C. S. Schiller [part\nresults are certainly not producible by it at will. Dr. Osty of\ncoui'se knows this as well as anyone ; but it is only towards\nthe end of the book, in a valuable chapter on '\nerrors in\nmetagnomy '\nthat one learns that errors abound and \" pervade\nmetagnomic seances in variable proportions. . . . Some seances\ncontain scarcely any, others contain a few, others many\n\"\n(p. 205), and that Dr. Osty, though he has had \" ideally good\nseances,\" has never come across \" an impeccable percipient\n\"\n(p. 215). All are C3.pable of starting off on a wrong clue, and\nincapable of distinguishing between a genuinely supernormal\nvision, an impression telepathically imbibed from another mind,\nand a product of the '\nfabulation ' of their own subconscious\nimagination. Moreover, their visions are always fragmentary,\nand therefore frequently misleading ; and public seances, \" or\neven private seances at which several persons are present \" are\nconducive to error (p. 233). Yet it is evident that private\nsittings at which only one '\nexperimenter '\nis jiresent, and has\nto record all that is said by both parties, are liable to errors\nof a different type : they can never inspire confidence like a\nsitting of which a contemporaneous proces verbal is extant. If\nin addition one recognises that every subject is different and\nhas idiosyncrasies to be humoured, and that hardly a glimmer\nof a theoretic explanation of the facts alleged is in sight, it\nwill not seem extravagant to say that we are still Yerj far\nfrom being in a position to call supernormal cognition an\nexperimental study reproducible at will.\nTrue there remains a considerable body of evidence in its t\nfavour, which can hardly all be explained away. Nor need it ji\nbe denied that Dr. Osty has materially added to it. But its\nquaUty is unsatisfactory and not always above suspicion, and, i\nso far as it is fact, it is still uncomprehended fact. Only\n^\nminute and co-operative study can be expected to yield the I\nclues that will lead to explanations and to experimental con-\njj\ntrol over it. And for this purpose it will be necessary to\nhave more, and more complete, accounts of the exact proceedings i;\nat the sittings at which apparently supernormal knowledge is '\nobtained. Dr. Osty (p. 239) regards these demands as un-\nreasonable, and never gives a record of even one of his sittings\nin full, as a specimen of his procedure. The reader therefore\nhas to take his accounts on trust, and cannot check his in-\nler(\n\fXCII.] Review 335\nferences. His excuse is that the accumulation of mere obser-\nvations without hypotheses is very slow work, and that such\nrecords are very dull reading. True, but the question is\nwhether they are not scientifically necessary in the present\nstate of the inquiry. They are at any rate more important\nthan that every investigator should start afresh with a new\nterminology of his own, especially when it is incorrectly formed.\nFor the term '\nmetagnomy '\nwhich Dr. Osty has adopted from\nBoirac should mean not '\nbeyond-intelligence '\nbut '\na\/ier-judg-\nment ' (or '\nopinion '). Lack of agreement about terminology is\none of the least of the difficulties of psychical research ; but\nwhat is siu-prising is that the French students of these subjects,\nwho are lacking neither in numbers, nor in enthusiasm, nor in\nability and scientific repute, should not band themselves to-\ngether into a Society like ours.\nF. C. S. ScniLLER.\n\f336 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\nAPPENDIX II. TO MRS. SIDGWICK'S PAPER ON\nPROFESSOR MURRAY'S EXPERIMENTS IN\nTHOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nThe experiments made on December 6 and 7, 1924, of\nwhich the record is given below, are of interest for three\nreasons. In the first place, only two (Mr. G. W. Balfour\nand Mr. Basil Murray) of the company had been present\nat any of the previous experiments ; in the second place,\nthese are two of the very rare occasions on which experi-\nments have been attempted elsewhere than in Professor\nMurray's own home or home-ckcle ; and in the third\nplace, three out of the five successes or partial successes\non December 6, 1924, were obtained when the subject\nhad been chosen by some one who had never been present\nbefore at experiments of Professor Murray's.\nMr. Basil Murray was asked to choose the subject of\nthe first three experiments on December 6, because, the\nsurroundings being strange, it was thought that there\nwould be a better chance of success if a beginning were\nmade with an agent to whom Professor Murray was\naccustomed.\nThe experiments on December 7, 1924, failed,\u2014probably\nbecause the conditions were unfavourable. It should be\nnoted that in one instance Professor Murray's impressions\nseem to have been infiuenced by things that had happened\nearlier in the day.\nDecember 6, 1924.\nFISHERS HILL, WOKING\nPresent\u2014Lady Betty Balfouk, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick,\nMiss Leonora Piddington, Messrs.

On subsequent occasions the\ndining-room door was left open. When the subject of\nthe experiment had been chosen and recorded, Mrs.\n[\nSidgwick on each occasion but one left the drawing-room\n;\nin order to summon Professor Murray. The drawing-room\nf \\\nis separated from the dining-room by another room about\nt\nI\nthirty-six feet in length. While the subject was being\n^\ni\nchosen and recorded Professor Murray was separated by\n. at least forty-six feet from the person nearest to the\nt\ndrawing-room door. The account of the subject chosen\n] ,\nwas dictated to the recorder in a quiet tone of voice :\n5\nin fact in so quiet a tone that more than once the\nt\nrecorder had to ask for words to be repeated. On each\n\\ I\noccasion Professor Murray held the hand of the person\nI\nwho had chosen the subject. J. G.
