He studied at the Thornton Grammar School in Bradford, then worked as a business manager until 1898. Obliged by ill-health to cut back his professional activities, he read extensively on psychical research, notably books and papers by William Crookes, Oliver Lodge, FWH Myers and Richard Hodgson.\n\nHill joined the Society for Psychical Research and was member of its governing council between 1927 and 1935. He chronicled researches on telepathy, clairvoyance, mediumship, survival of death, and other subjects, publishing several books, along with reports of his own investigations. His contributions as a historian of the spiritualist movement and the progress of scientific parapsychology were generally well received, especially the 1918 volume Spiritualism: Its History, Phenomena and Doctrine.1\n\nHill compiled and annotated an edition of Oliver Lodge\u2019s personal and professional correspondence.2 He was also a devoted scholar of the American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Views on Psychical Research\n\nHill was impressed by the experimental researcg carried out by SPR members, and their logical treatment of the evidence. He became convinced of the reality of telepathy, psychometry, clairvoyance, and other unusual phenomena unrecognized by the science of his day. He believed they could be due to subliminal powers of living people, although some might indicate the agency of discarnate human beings.\n\nPersonal experience, he thought, is necessary to attain real convictions regarding these matters, a point of view that owed much to Myers, whose pioneering work he always praised.3 Researchers in this new field had to \u2018invent the technique of the inquiry\u2019 and \u2018learn its application\u2019. He sat with several clairvoyants and mediums, notably Aaron Wilkinson, with whom he developed the methodological approaches that he recommended in his texts.\n\nBy 1930 he was inclined to think that \u2018we are perhaps doing more useful work by grubbing along at telepathy\u2019 and like subjects  \n\nwhich do not too much shock the orthodox scientific man, than by arguing for spiritualistic interpretations or by having sittings for materialisation. These things may put off some minds which would at least tolerate the less startling phenomena. Science wants to link up the unknown with the known, and it is perhaps well to avoid jumps into very far countries\u2019.4\n\nHe felt that the question of survival and a future state was \u2018urgent and abiding\u2019 for psychical research, especially in the aftermath of World War I,5&nbsp; and that the accumulated evidence was \u2018sufficient to justify belief\u2019 in such things.6  Selected Works on Psychical Research  Articles\n\n1918.
