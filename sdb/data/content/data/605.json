[part\nIntrodfction.\nThe sittings which I propose to discuss in this report are\nsome of those which were held during the period of three\nmonths, from January 14 to April 15, 1918, when the\nSociety for Psychical Research entered into an agreement\nwith Mrs. Leonard to the effect that she should give\nsittings only to people for whom appointments were made\nby the Society.\nAll the necessary arrangements with regard to the\nchoice of sitters, the obtaining of records and so forth,\nwere put into the hands of a Committee (referred to below\nas the Leonard Committee) specially appointed by the\nCouncil for this purpose ; and of this Committee I was\nthe secretary. As to the arrangements for sittings, the\nfollowing procedure was adopted :\n(a) The names of all persons wishing to have appoint-\nments with Mrs. Leonard must be submitted to the\nCommittee, with whom should rest the decision whether\nan appointment should be given or not.\n(&) When it had been decided that an appointment\nshould be given, the date of this appointment was deter-\nmined by me, as secretary, in consultation with the\nprospective sitter, whose attention was particularly drawn\nto the importance of not mentioning the appointment to\nany one, except perhaps to some member of his or her\nimmediate family, from whom it could not well be con-\ncealed.\nAs to the question of obtaining satisfactory records,,\nwith a very few exceptions, appointments were given only\nto people who were willing that a recorder selected by\nthe Leonard Committee should be present at the sitting,\nand that a copy of the record obtained should be handed\nover to the Society. Most of the records were made by\none or other of three persons, Una, Lady Troubridge, Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall (both of them members of the Leonard\n\fLxxxir.] Introduction. 3\nCommittee), and myself. On one occasion the record was\nmade by Miss Newton, the Secretary of the Society, and on\ntwo occasions by Mr. J. G. Piddington. Exceptions to the\ngeneral rule concerning the presence of a recorder were\nmade in the case of one or two old sitters who had been\nin the habit of sitting regularly with Mrs. Leonard and\ncould not therefore be entirely excluded during the period\nunder review. A few of these records made by old sitters\nare in our possession, but I shall make very little use of\nthem in this report.\n^\nWith regard to the records from which I shall quote,\nit is to be observed that they were not made in shorthand.\nBut, as Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall have\nalready said in their report on their earlier sittings with\nMrs. Leonard {Proc. S.P.B., Part LXXVIII.), it is possible\nby dint of practice and by establishing a good under-\nstanding with Mrs. Leonard's \" control,\" Feda, to obtain\nan accurate and a substantially verbatim record of what\noccurs. A special point was always made of taking down\neverything that was said by the sitter, so that if any\ninformation was thus conveyed to the medium this fact\nmight be apparent in the record.\nThe total number of sittings given by Mrs. Leonard\nduring the period under review was seventy-three ;\nthirty-\n1 1 should like to make it clear that in thus putting aside these\nrecords made by old sitters I do not intend to cast any doubt upon their\nbona fides. But experience has shown that people differ much in their\ncapacity for making an exact record, and many sitters do not realise\nthe importance of noting everything they say themselves. Moreover,\neven if a sitter is skilled and experienced in the art of recording, there\nis a distinct advantage in having the record made by some one whose\nattention is not distracted in any way. In recording my own sittings\n\u2014\nwhich I have done on several occasions\u2014I have noticed two tendencies :\n(a) my mind may be given temporarily to the problem of what response,\nif any, it is desirable tha't I should make to some statement or Cjuestion,\nand my record may sixffer in consequence ; (6) I have noticed in myself\na tendency, against which I think sitters should be on their guard, to\nrecord more carefully and minutely statements which I know to be of\nevidential value than statements which I know to be confused or\nincorrect. Close attention to the process of recording flags in pro-\nportion to the flagging of the sitter's interest in what is being said,\nand if this tendency is not immediately checked, correct and evidential\nstatements will of course have undue prominence in the record.\n\f4 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\none appointments were given to twenty-five new sitters,\nof whom one had three sittings and four had two sittings\neach ; all these new sitters were anonymous except three ;\ntwo had made appointments with Mrs. Leonard in their\nown name before she entered into the agreement with the\nSociety, and Mrs. Sidgwick, who had two sittings, was\nknown to Mrs. Leonard through having called upon her\nto talk over the terms of the agreement. Forty-two\nappointments were given to persons who had sat with\nMrs. Leonard before ; of these forty-two sittings thirteen\nwere taken by Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall,\none of them acting as sitter and one as recorder, as is\ntheir usual habit ;\ntwenty-nine sittings were given to\nother old sitters, and of all but nine of these sittings\ncareful records are in the possession of the Society.\nPutting aside therefore the nine sittings of which no\nadequate record is available, we have a total of sixty-four\nsittings, of which .thirty-one were given to new sitters,\nthat is, persons who had never sat with Mrs. Leonard at\nany time prior to January 15, 1918, and thirty-three to\nold sitters, that is, persons who had sat with her at\nleast once before that date.\nI propose in this report to classify the results under\nconsideration according to whether they were obtained by\nnew or old sitters, and to concern myself mainly with\nthose obtained by new sitters. One great advantage we\npossess in the case of these new sitters is that it is a\ncomparatively easy task to determine in weighing the\nevidence what allowance must be made for any normal\nknowledge Mrs. Leonard may have had concerning them.\nIn the case of anonymous sitters\u2014and, as I have stated\nabove, we believe all but three ^ of the new sitters to\nhave been anonymous\u2014we have only to consider what\n1 It is worth noting as a point in favour of the complete trust-\nworthiness of Mrs. Leonard that the results obtained by Mrs. Sidgwick,\nwho had two sittings and whose name was known to Mrs. Leonard,\nwere amongst the least successful during the period i^mder review. The\nresults obtained by Mr. G. W. Balfour in the course of three sittings\nwere also poor. Mr. Balfour went anonymously, but had Mrs. Leonard\nbeen in the habit of assisting the production of apparently supernormal\nphenomena by any adventitious means, it is to be supposed under the\n\fLXXXII.] Introduction. 5\ngeneral a priori assumptions Mrs. Leonard might make about\nthem and what she\u2014or Feda\u2014might infer during the sitting.\nIn the case of old sitters we must of course take into\naccount all the information that may have been given at\nformer sittings, or in the course of ordinary conversation ;\nfor some of Mrs. Leonard's old sitters have come to\nknow her well, and she has frequently been in their\ncompany when in her normal condition. With old sitters\nsuch as Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall, who\nfrom the very first have not only kept careful records\nof their sittings, but of any conversations they have had\nwith Mrs. Leonard in the course of which some infor-\nmation concerning their affairs might have been given to\nher, it is possible by consulting these records to ascertain\nwhether a particular piece of evidence is vitiated or\nmodified in any way by some earlier incident. But many\nold sitters have kept but scanty records of earlier sittings,\nand no records at all of conversations. In their case,\ntherefore, it is often impossible to determine how much of\nthe later evidence must be discounted. Almost the only\ntype of evidence which can be taken at its face value\nis apparent knowledge of events which have occurred\nsince the sitter last held any communication with Mrs.\nLeonard, and which are such that they would have been very\nunlikely to come to Mrs. Leonard's knowledge through\nany other normal channel. Knowledge of this kind is\noften displayed during sittings with Mrs. Lepnard, but it\nhappens that there are not many good instances of it\nduring the period under review.\nIn the discussion of evidence to which I shall now\nproceed I shall assume that my readers are familiar with\nthe earlier reports on Mrs. Leonard's phenomena that\nhave appeared in the Proceedings, and I shall only say\nthat in all the sittings with which I am here concerned\nMrs. Leonard was in trance and ostensibly \" controlled,\"\nby Feda, in most cases, and on one or two occasions\ncircumstances that she would have familiarised herself with the personal\nappearance of prominent members of the S.P.R. and have collected a\nlittle useful information about them\u2014not a difficidt matter in Mr.\nBalfour's case, nor in Mrs. Sidgwick's.\n\f6 Introduction. [part lxxxii.]\nby A. V. B.i (see Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXX., p. 339 fif.).\nI use the word \" control \" for convenience to designate\na well-marked psychological phenomenon. I do not propose\nto discuss in this report what may be the cause of this\nphenomenon, or the relation between Mrs. Leonard and\nthe supposed personalities who \" control \" her.\n1 See below, pp. 59 ff. A. V. B. never piuports to control except\nat sittings taken by Lady Troubridge or Miss Radclyffe-Hall.\n\fPART I.\nEvidence obtained by New Sitters.\nI WILL now proceed to consider the evidence obtained by\nthe twenty-five new sitters who were introduced to Mrs.\nLeonard during the period of her agreement with the\nSociety In justice to Mrs. Leonard it should be pomted\nout that the phenomena obtained in these circum-\nstances are not Hkely to be as interesting or remarkable\nas those obtained by sitters who have sat regularly with\nMrs. Leonard during some months or even years. J^irst\nsittings, even when they are on the whole successful, are\napt to be of a rather tentative nature, and they usually\nfollow certain conventional lines. Moreover, they afford\nlittle scope for evidence concerning the character and\npersonality of the supposed communicator. For one thing,\nsuch evidence is largely cumulative in its effect, and for\nanother, whether it is obtained by telepathy between\nMrs Leonard and the communicator, or between Mrs.\nLeonard and the sitter, or by some combined interaction\nof all three minds together, it is likely that a well-\nestablished raj>port between Mrs. Leonard and her sitter\nwill facilitate matters. I think there is a general agree-\nment amongst those who have sat repeatedly with Mrs.\nLeonard\u2014amongst whom I may include myself\u2014that\ngood evidence of surviving personality is sometimes\nobtained.'^\nBut a review of the evidence obtained during a number\nlA very striking example is quoted in Mrs. Sidgwick's paper on\n\"Book-Tests\" (see Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXI. p. 253 H), but this incident,\nbe it observed, occurred during Mrs. Talbot's second sitting.\n7\n\f8 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nof first sittings, even if it does not yield any incidents\nof a striking character, is not without a certain interest\nof its own. A great many people have neither opportunity\nnor inclination for a protracted study of trance-phenomena ;\nthey visit a medium once, or perhaps twice, with the\navowed intention of getting into touch with some dead\nfriend or relative, if they can, and therefore both from\na practical and from a theoretical point of view it is\nworth while to consider what sort of results such people\nseem likely to get.\nIn order to form an opinion on this point it is necessary\nthat we should have under review a considerable number\nof sittings for purposes of comparison, and this is just\nwhat the individual sitter can very seldom do. He knows\nwhat has occurred at his own sitting and can judge how\nfar the statements made are applicable to his particular\ncircumstances. What he cannot judge, unless he sets\nhimself deliberately to enquire into the matter, is to what\nextent the statements made at his sitting might have\nbeen applicable to the circumstances of some other sitter,\nand\u2014a more important point\u2014to what, extent statements\nmade appropriately to him have also been made to other\nsitters whose circumstances they did not fit. This point,\nI say, is important, because the comparison of a number\nof first sittings reveals the fact that certain typical lines\nof structure, so to speak, tend to recur with slight modi-\nfications, and a statement which is accepted by one\nsitter as good evidence for the identity of the purporting\ncommunicator will obviously lose much of its evidential\nvalue by frequent and indiscriminate repetition.\nWhat I have termed these typical lines of structure are\nmost apparent in sittings at which the general level of\nevidence for any supernormal source of knowledge is poor.\nThere can be little doubt, I think, that when Feda is\nat a loss, when for one reason or another she is not able\nto get any genuine impressions of a supernormal character,\nsooner than remain silent she resorts to what may be\ntermed her \" stock-in-trade,\" and pads freely. ^ She frankly\n1 Cf. similar observations made by Sir Oliver Lodge in regard to Mrs.\nPiper's control, Phinuit, and by Mr. J. G. Piddington in regard to Mrs.\nThompson's control, Nelly.\n\fLxxxii.] Evidence obtained by Neiv Sitters. 9\nrecognises this tendency herself (although she puts the\nresponsibility for it upon the communicator), alleging in\nexcuse that unless a free and more or less continuous\nflow of communication can be established, the stream is\napt to dry up entirely. In a sitting taken by Dr. T. W.\nMitchell on April 12, 1918, at which Lady Troubridge\nrecorded, the following passage occurred :\nFeda. And\u2014a spirit what Feda asks advice of said some\nj)eoples would be shocked, but not you\u2014you know\nwhen spirits comes, they sometimes all seems to say\nthe same thing ; like a young man will say he's\nwTitten a \"portant letter. And after two or three\nhas said it, Feda says : Say something new, that's\nnot proper evidence ; \"cos every one says that.\"\nThen they says : Oh, I want mother to know\nit\n\"\u2014and if you stops 'em, you shuts the door on\ntheir saying other things what may be evidence.\nAnd then that one thing becomes a key what is easy\ntapped and played upon in her [Mrs. Leonard's] mind ;\nso if Feda lets 'em play about a bit, it gives 'em a\nfeehng of confidence ; and though Feda's thinking all\nthe time \"\"\noh, they all say that,\"' Feda mustn't be\ncross about it. And the medium was cross ; 'cos\nseveral sitters told her their sons had given good\ntests about letters they had sent two days before\nthey passed over, and she said to Feda :\n\" Can't you\ngive something better than that ? Everyone has sent\nletters.\". . .\nOften Feda has to let the si^irits talk just of\nanything, to get them on a flow ; 'cos if they only\nthinks of tests, they gets all stiff and frozen up ; and\nthey all has written letters, and all boys loves their\nmothers, so it does no harm.\nThis statement of Feda's receives practical corroboration\nfrom the fact, which many sitters with Mrs. Leonard\nmust have observed, that any deliberate effort made to\ngive a particular \" test,\" in response, e.g. to a question\nasked by the sitter, is apt, as it were, to block that line\nfor the time being, although a quite correct answer may\n\f10 iMrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nafterwards be given spontaneously.^ There is an obvious\nanalogy in the experience everyone has had of trying to\nremember a half-forgotten name ; a deliberate effort to\nremember the name has an inhibiting effect, but if we\nlet our mind run on other matters, the name will rise\ninto consciousness. Similarly it would appear that if\nduring Mrs. Leonard's trance the stream of obvious and\ncommonplace communications is allowed to flow un-\nchecked it may be made to serve as a vehicle for matter\nwhich is of evidential value. In a note appended to the\nextract from Dr. Mitchell's sitting quoted above, the\nrecorder. Lady Troubridge, says that she had noticed\nthat on several occasions this stereotyped evidence was,\nas it were, made the peg upon which to hang some really\nstriking piece of evidence. For instance, out of the usual\nmeandermg anent a watch, worn on the wrist, would\nemerge some little evidential fact anent the nature or\nwhereabouts of some other watch possessed by the com-\nmunicator. Or, to quote an actual instance, on one\noccasion, when the obvious allusion was made by the\ncommunicator to a gold signet ring, obviously a man's,\nworn by the sitter, great surjjrise was expressed, and\nbe-\\vilderment, at the fact that the sitter possessed such\na ring. And this surprise was evidential in view of the\nfact that the original ring had gone to the bottom of\nthe sea with the communicator, the one worn hy the\nsitter having been specially made to the old pattern\nsubsequently to the communicator's death. It will be\nseen, therefore, that Feda's explanation to the effect that\nshe allows novice communicators to practise and acquire\nconfidence by the use of stereotyped evidence, found, as\nit were, ready to hand in the medium's brain, and that\nthereby they are encouraged, and gain the necessary\nconfidence for giving something really good, is borne out\nby the facts observed.\nIn our almost complete ignorance concerning the con-\nditions governing trance communications, Feda's word as\n1 See, for example, Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXX., pp. 444 ff.\n\fLXXXII.] Evidence obtained by New Sitters. 11\nto how the production of good evidence may be facilitated\nis worth at least as much as anyone else's, and it is\nprobably wiser for new sitters to let her take her own\ncourse. Nevertheless it must be admitted that anything\nthat can be described as mere padding is from an\nevidential standpoint regrettable, and when a friendly\nrapport has been established between Feda and the sitter\nmuch may be done to check this kind of talk. Feda\nherself, as the extract given above indicates, has a keen sense\nof what constitutes valuable evidence and has shown her\ndesire to obtain it whenever possible.\nTo return to the question of what kind of statements\nare habitually or frequently made at first sittings, there\nis one particular line of thought which constantly recurs,\npartly, no doubt, as a result of the fact that during the\nlast few years the great majority of sitters have lost a\nfriend or relative in the war, with whom they desire to\ncommunicate, and it now ^ appears to be Feda's habit to\nassume that such is the case. On each of the twenty-five\noccasions which I am now considering, when a new sitter\nwas present for the first time, communications were\nreceived purporting to come from a young man, or at\nleast a man in the prime of life, whose appearance and\nthe circumstances of his death, as described by Feda,\nstrongly suggest that he was a soldier. In most cases\nthe sitters had in fact lost some friend or relative from\nwhom the communications might be supposed to come,\nbut on three occasions young soldiers purported to com-\nmunicate whom the sitters were not able to identify at\nall. It is not to be assumed that because they were\nunidentified they were necessarily fictitious characters, but\nfrom an evidential standpoint we can only judge of such\nmatters as they present themselves to us, and all we can\nsay of these supposed communicators is that they did not\n\" make good.\" On another occasion when a sitter had\nlost a relative in the war, this relative was a naval\nofficer ; a communicator presented himself who gave some\n^ This statement is made in relation to sittings given during 1918. To\nwhat extent it still holds good, I do not know.\n\f12 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nevidence of identity,^ but no indication of any connexion\nwith the sea was obtained ; on the contrary statements\nwere made which appeared to imply some association\nwith fighting on land, the conditions of life in the trenches\nand so forth. These results suggest that Feda has what\nmight be termed a military habit of mind ; she takes it\nfor granted first that communication with a young man\nis desired, and, secondly, that any young man who\npresents himself is a soldier. On one occasion a sitter\ndesired to communicate with his daughter, a quite young\ngirl, who had lately died. The supposed communicators\nwho spontaneously presented themselves on this occasion\nwere (1) a young man, who from the statements made\nabout him was presumably a soldier killed in the war ;\n(2) an \" elderly lady \" said to be a relative ; (3) an old\nman with a grey beard ; (4) another \" elderly lady \" said\nto be much with the first. Neither of the men was\nrecognised at all by the sitter, the two women only\ndoubtfully. Then, at the recorder's suggestion, the sitter\nasked whether communication with his daughter was\npossible. A spirit was then said to be \" building up,\"\nwhom at first Feda could not clearly see ; later on she\ngave a description of this spirit which the sitter recognised\nas applicable to his daughter,- and some evidence of\nidentity was also obtained. Now the circumstances in\nthis case were peculiar\u2014it would not often happen,\nespecially during the war, when so many men were losing\ntheir lives, that the dead person with whom communi-\ncation was desired would be a young girl ; the result\nappears to indicate that during the early part of the\nsitting Feda's statements were based rather upon a priori\nassumptions as to what the sitter's circumstances were\nlikely to be than on any real knowledge of those circum-\nstances supernormally acquired. First she assumes that he\nwishes to communicate with a soldier, perhaps a son, that\nbeing in her experience the most likely contingency ;\nfailing that, she assumes that he wishes to communicate\n1 Further evidence of a more striking character was obtained from the\ncommunicator at two later sittings.\n^ See Appendix, p. 94.\n\fLxxxii.] Evidence obtained hy Neiv Sitters. 13\nwith some middle-aged or elderly relative, perhaps a wife,\nperhaps a father or mother. It is not until she has been\nset in the right course by a direct question from the\nsitter that anything of evidential value is obtained.\nThere is then a strong probability that the first supposed\ncommunicator to present himself at a sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard will be a soldier, said to have been killed, or at\nleast to have died in the war. After some statement\nfrom him it frequently happens, as on the occasion I have\njust described, that various persons whom we may call\nsecondary communicators make their appearance ;\nthey\nare usually said to be older members, or sometimes friends\n-of the young man's family, spirits who \" helped him when\nhe passed over.\" Allusions may also be made to other\npersons who are not alleged to be present themselves at\nthe sitting, but concerning whom statements are made by\na communicator ;\noccasionally other young men are\nreferred to who are said to be soldier friends of the\nfirst communicator. Another frequent type of com-\nmunicator is the child who has died young, or was still-\nborn and has \"grown up on the other side.\"^ These\ncommunicators do not usually take much active part\nin the sittings ;\nthey are described as having come from\na. higher sphere to give their assistance ; sometimes they\nare said to act as \"guides\" to the sitter.\nTaking it then as established that at a first sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard certain groups of communicators will\nnormally present themselves\u2014this method of procedure\nbeing, as it were, the scaffolding upon which the whole\nsitting is built up\u2014we must next consider to what extent\nthe individual members of each group are clearly differ-\nentiated one from another, and what kind of evidence of\npersonal identity they are able to give.\n\u00a71. Personal Appeaeance of Communicators.\nWhen a communicator is said to be present at a sitting,\nTeda usually begins by giving a description of his or her\n^ A similar tendency was observed in Mrs. Thompson's control, Nelly,\nsee Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XVIII., p. 261 ff.\n\f14 Mrs. W. H Salter. [part\npersonal appearance. A comparison of a considerable\nnumber of such descriptions suggests that in a good many-\ncases they represent types rather than individuals ;\nthey\nare frequently recognised by the sitters and said to be\ngood descriptions, but it has to be remembered that the\nsitters know who the individual is whom they hope to\nhear described ; the personal appearance of this individual\nis clearly in their mind's eye, and therefore, provided that\nthe description given by Feda is not positively inapplicable,\nthey will quite unconsciously fill in the gaps themselves\nand accept the description as an accurate representation'\nof the person they have in their thoughts. It happens\noccasionally that descriptions are given which are in-\ndividually characteristic and not widely applicable. Such,\nfor example, was the description of the communicator\ncalled A. V. B. (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXX., p. 355 ff.) ; it\nwas a very detailed description, and was such that to\nanyone familiar with A. V. B.'s manner and personal\nappearance it would be likely to suggest her identity\nwithout her name having been mentioned. This detailed\ndescription, however, was not given at a first sitting. In\nthe sittings now under consideration I have found no\ndescriptions which for accuracy of detail could compare\nwith that one, but here and there a personal characteristic\nis clearly noted. At a sitting, for example, on April 4,\n1918, after a rather vague description of a communicator's\nappearance which left the sitter in some doubt as to\nwhich of two possible communicators was intended, the\nfollowing statement was made :\nFeda (to the communicator). ^ What about a spot near your\nnose ? (Feda points vaguely to the region of the\nnose, mouth and jaw.)\nSitter. The mouth ?\nFeda. Yes ; he had a mark here. (Feda passes her finger\nacross the cheek between the side of the mouth and\n1 Those of my readers who have had sittings with Mrs. Leonard will\nbe familiar with Feda's mannerisms. When she is addressing a supposed\ncommimicator or repeating something that a communicator has said,\nso as to be sure that she has got it correctly, her remarks are in the\nnature of asides, usually half whispered.\n\fLxxxn,] Personal Appearance of Communicators. 15\nthe jaiy bOne.) Anyhov^ -he '^liash't'-. got it now.\n(Feda begins stroking the jawbone.) Feda thinks it\nwas just there ; he'd had it for some time ; Feda\nthinks that it might have been much worse than\nit was. It's not round, it's more long-shaped and\nnot quite straight ; Feda thinks it must have spoilt\nthe side of the jaw a little.\nThe sitter's comment is as follows :\nThis is correct. B [the communicator] had two serious\noperations on his jaw, and a part of the bone was removed\nfour months before he passed over. Had he lived, the\nright side of the jaw would have apjoeared shortened from\nthe ear to the chin. Feda pointed to the right side of\nthe face, which was correct, and to the exact spot where\nwould have been the long irregular scar (white) left after\nthe first unsuccessful operation which had to be repeated.\nNow that is quite a good clear piece of evidence, not\neasily explicable by chance-coincidence, since few peojDle\nhave marked blemishes of any kind upon the jaw. But,\nso far as I have been able to observe, evidence of that\nparticular kind is not frequently obtained at first sittings\nwith Mrs. Leonard. Statements concerning the personal\nappearance of communicators are usually of that vague and\ngeneral character which one associates with passports, and\nthey exhibit several noticeable limitations. For example,\nFeda frequently remarks that she is unable to see the\ncolour of the communicator's eyes, and if she hazards a\nstatement on this point she is as likely to be wrong as\nright. In some cases this difficulty may be natural enough\n(there are people in whose company one could be for\nmany weeks without observing what colour their eyes\nwere), but there are instances in which Feda has either\nfailed to give any indication about a communicator's eyes\nor has described them wrongly, when according to the\nsitter the eyes were the most noticeable feature of his\nface.^\nThe colour of a communicator's hair is another point\nupon which Feda's statements are apt to be indefinite ;\n^ See Appendix, p. 83.\n\f16 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nthe hair is said\" to. .1b:e- . brown -or! ''\"of ' si browny colour,\"\n\" rather on the light side \" or \" the dark side,\" as the\ncase may be. Where soldiers are concerned, whose hair\nis always said by Feda to be cut very short, perhaps\nnot much more than this could be expected\u2014by far the\ngreater number of Englishmen have hair of some shade\nof brown\u2014but one might have hoped for some more\nprecise differentiation in the case of other communicators,\nespecially women.\nA more general and more important limitation is that\nFeda with a very natural consideration for the sitter's\nfeelings invariably draws a communicator's portrait in\nfavourable terms. In all the sittings under consideration\nnot one admittedly plain-featured communicator has been\nportrayed. Feda occasionally permits herself to comment\nwith kindly criticism upon the personal appearance of\npeople still alive, but de mortuis nil nisi honmn. Now,\nif any one will set himself the task of describing as\ngraphically as possible and without prejudice the appear-\nance of some tolerably presentable, but not strikingly\nhandsome member of his acquaintance, he will find that\nthe aesthetic blemishes of a face characterise it as much\nas its beauties. He will observe, it may be, that his\nfriend's eyes are rather too small, or his nose is rather\ntoo long, but of such characteristics as these Feda tells\nus almost nothing.\nThe lack of precise detail which marks many of her\npersonal descriptions is most conspicuous, as we might\nexpect, in the case of soldiers. I say \" as we might\nex]3ect,\" because the average young British officer con-\nforms to type in a way that must make it a difficult\nmatter to give any description that will at once and\nclearly differentiate him individually from his fellows.\nNevertheless, if the evidence is in fact weak in this\nrespect it is important that this weakness should be\nrecognised. I will quote in illustration of my point an\nincident which occurred at one of my own sittings.\nA young man was said to be present who had died in\nthe war ; he was described, with a rather unusual amount\nof detail, in the following terms :\n\fLxxxii.] Personal Appearance of Communicators. 17\nHe [the communicator, my father] thinks he is tall,\nand well built, but in breadth he is about medium,\nnot a very big tall man. Mr. Arthur [Feda's name\nfor the communicator] j^ulls himself up, Feda thinks\nthat means that the young man is straight. His face\nis towards long-shaped with a well-shaped chin with-\nout being unduly broad, the mouth is medium size\nand he has good teeth. It's a good shaped mouth,\nnot too full, about medium. The lips are curved,\nand the mouth is inclined to turn uj) at the corners.\nOne corner turns up a little more than the other\ncorner. That was just a little habit he had, it could\nbe verified with a photograj^h. His eyes smiled too ;\nthough he had that habit, it doesn't give him a\nsmiKng ajDpearance because his mouth and chin are\ntoo strong and too decided. The nose is not quite\nstraight, you can see the bridge a little, it's a nice\nshape, not large, medium, and the nostrils are well\nopened. And here, you see, the outside of the nostril\nis well formed ; it's rather deeply curved (Feda\noutlines the ring of the medium's nostril with her\nfinger) that helps to take away from the funny look\nof the mouth ; he kept his mouth closed, not loose.\nHis skin is clear and on the fair side rather and\nthere is a little colour just in the cheeks, not all\nover. Oh dear, the colour of his eyes is difficult to\nget at. Feda don't . know, can't tell ; Feda can't\nsense the colour. What you call a blue or bluey\ngrey Feda thinks, not a very decided colour. There's\n& little streakiness in them or two colours. The\neyebrows are broadly marked, but they don't look\nheavy because they are brown, not black. His\nforehead is squarish and a good shape, just on the\ntemples it is rather full, and then it is a little\nflatter below. His hair is brown and pretty thick,\ntut rather short. It's short at the back and the\nsides but as he brushes it at the top it's a little\nlonger and sticks up a bit on his forehead. It's a\nlittle ruffled looking on top, Feda thinks it would\nget like that unless he was always pushing it down.\nB\n\f18 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nThat's exactly like him. He's got good hands, not\ngirlish, but Mr. Arthur says they are a good point.\nOh dear, Feda can't see that. Mr. Arthur thinks he\ntakes nines in boots. He thinks it might be a good\ntest, Feda don't know why he says that. His hands\nare a bit broad across the back, but he's not got\nstumj^y fingers, they are long. And his thumb sticks\nout from his hands and curves back. (Feda holds\nout her hand and indicates a wide division between\nthe thumb and fingers, and apparently a thumb much\ncurved back.)\nH. S. Do you mean his thumb is flexible ?\nF. No, it's rather stiff ; Feda would think he had a good\nfirm grip.\nNow if I were drawing up a list of people who on\na 2>^'iori grounds might not improbably attempt to com-\nmunicate with me, I should place upon it the names of\nthree young men who have been killed in the war. To\none of these young men Feda's description does not seem\nto me to apply at all, but with a few slight modifications\nit might suit either of the other two. As regards each\nof them parts of the description are inexact, and Feda\nhas missed at least one characteristic feature which anyone\nobserving closely, as she appears to do, would be likely\nto note. I may say that since this description was given\nthe young man described above has made several attempts\nto identify himself to me, but without success ; I am\nstill in complete uncertainty as to who he may be. But\nthe point I wish to emphasise here is that the description\ngiven by Feda, which I have carefully com^jared with\nphotographs of the two young men to whom I thought\nreference was perhaps intended, might apply to either of\nthem ; and yet in life these two young men could not be\nsaid to resemble each other at all, except in so far as\neach conformed to the normal type of well-grown young\nEnglishman. The inference which it seems reasonable to\ndraw is that mere general descriptions of features and\ncolouring, such as the one I have quoted, are of little\nevidential value unless the identity of the person described\n\fLxxxii.] Personal Appearance of Communicators. 19\ncan be established by some other means. Fortunately,\nevidence of other kinds is frequently available, and personal\ndescriptions in themselves rather slight and superficial are\nsometimes accompanied by allusions to characteristic habits\nor to bodily infirmities, which would not be generally\napplicable, but are recognised by the sitters as apph'ing\nto some particular friend or relative. I have given one\ninstance of this already ; another occurred at a sitting\non January 31, when the following description was given :\nThere's a lady in the spirit woiid with him\u2014she comes\nto you too\u2014and a gentleman with her. Feda'U try to\ndescribe her. The age about 60 to 65\u2014about medium\nbuild, but holds herself well\u2014very nice-shaped face\u2014rather\nlong-shaped, towards the oval. When she turns sideways,\nshe's got a nice profile. She's got a photo turned side-\nways, taken some years ago. It's old-fashioned. She's\npale rather, but she'd had a nice complexion, but had\nlost it a little ; the chin had fallen a little ; the nose\nstraight, about medium-size, not an aquihne nose, more\nstraight ; the eyebrows brown, the eyelashes brown ; her\nhair\u2014she's showing it brown, but it had gone grey before\nshe passed over. She'd had some weak condition to do\nwith the lower joart of the body for some time before she\npassed over, but on the top of that she got another\ncondition, more like in the chest, a bit to the left side,\nbefore she passed over ; her physical strength was under-\nmined, internally she was getting weaker, but she wouldn't\ngive in.\nConcerning this description the sitter comments thus :\nThis my mother and I agree is a good description of\nmy grandmother. She was however seventy-two years old\nwhen she died, but looked younger. She had been very\nbeautiful and was distinctly vain of her fine profile. Even\nin her old age she kept a little trick of turning her head\nso as to bring it to your notice. Her hair was grey, but\nshe wore a brown wig. She was very sensitive on the\nsubject of her age. I had a dim recollection of such a\nphotograph as Feda describes at the time of the sitting.\nIt was coloured, and the artist had given her a wonderful\n\f20 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\ncomplexion. My mother says of it : At first I felt sure\nshe had never had a photograph taken in profile. Then\nI remembered that she did have one taken and coloured,\nwith gold earrings and a shawl with black and lavender\nstripes. It was not good and I put it out of sight in\nher lifetime and have never seen it since ; she however\nliked it. I forget when it was taken, but it was after\nshe was fifty.\"\" The descrij^tion of her health at the time\nshe died is very good and she \"\nwould not give up.' In\nfact, she did not believe she was seriously ill and feared\nto be thought old. Her death was sudden and unexpected\nand was due to over-exertion on a hot day.\nIn this case, not only is Feda's description said to be\ngenerally applicable to the sitter's grandmother, but it is\nsuch as to indicate correctly the communicator's character\nas well as her personal appearance ; the emphasis laid\nupon the good profile and the photograph in which it\nappeared to advantage, the preference for brown hair\nand the determination not to yield to physical in-\nfirmities ^ are all characteristic traits which considerably\nenhance the evidential value of the description taken as a\nwhole.\nI have given these instances to illustrate what appear\nto be the strong and weak points of descriptions given\nthrough Mrs. Leonard. Before I pass on to consider other\nkinds of evidence I will discuss very briefly some\ntheoretical problems which these descriptions raise con-\ncerning the source from which is derived any knowledge\n(supernormally acquired) and concerning the manner in\nwhich this knowledge presents itself to Mrs. Leonard in\ntrance. There has been some discussion of this matter\nin the Journal,'^ and three theories have been propounded,\naccording to one of which the explanation is to be found\nin telepathy from the sitter, according to another in\ntelepathy from the communicator, and according to a\n1 The evidential value of this last point is weakened by the fact that\nsome such statement is very frequently made concerning old or elderly\ncommunicators.\n2 See .Jour. S.P.R., Vol. XVIII., pp. 187 ff. and 213 ff.\n\fLxxxii.] Personal Appearance of Comtminicators. 21\nthird in a quasi-materialising power in the communicator,\nwho unconsciously recreates a semblance of his body as\nit existed when he was alive. Now the first hypothesis,\ntelepathy from the sitter, seems to break down, because,\nas has been pointed out, communicators are sometimes\nwell described and subsequently identified whose personal\nappearance was quite unknown to the sitter ;\nmoreover,\nthere is a considerable body of evidence of other kinds to\nshow that telepathy from the sitter is not the only source\nof Mrs. Leonard's supernormal knowledge ;\nwhy, then,\nshould we suppose that as regards one particular kind of\nknowledge she is limited to that source 1\nWith regard to the materialisation theory, several\ndifficulties present themselves. Sir Oliver Lodge, by whom\nthis theory has been put forward in the 8.P.R. Journal\n(Vol. XVIII., p. 213), speaks of communicators having\na materialising power akin to that which we possess here,\nby which we build up our own bodies. It would seem,\nhowever, as if communicators can not only materialise\ntheir own bodies, but also any inanimate objects to\nwhich for evidential reasons they wish to call Feda's\nattention. Feda at any rate makes no distinction in this\nrespect between persons and things. According to her own\naccount she sees before her not only the spirit who is\ncommunicating but the chair in which he used to sit,\nor the stick he used to carry. The communicator, she\nsays, is building these things up or showing them to her.\nIt is theoretically possible to suppose that spirits can\nmaterialise chairs and sticks, but that power is surely\nnot akin to the power we now possess of shaping our\nown bodies. To materialise a chair by thinking about it\nis a thing we cannot do at all, and if spirits can do this,\nthe analogy between their powers and our own seems to\nbreak down. If, on the other hand, we suppose that the\nchair which Feda sees is only an externalised mental\nimage, why should we seek any other explanation to\naccount for her visions of people ?\nThen, again, we have to account for the fact that she\ncan describe living people as well as those who have\ndied. For example, at a sitting in February, 1918, at\n\f22 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nwhich communications from a young man were received,\nFeda made the following statement :\nF. There's a gentleman on the earth plane that he [the\ncommunicator] goes to see. And who, he thinks, knows\nhe goes to see him. More an elderly gentleman, not old,\nbut elderly, just past middle age. Moustache rather a\nfaded colour, going grey, it\"s been brown ; the face not\nfull, thinnish ;\nbluey-grey coloured eyes, rather deep-set,\nthe eyebrows marked, the hair thin on top (touching\nthe upper part of the temples and clearly indicating the\nupper psirt of the forehead as what was meant) ; at\nthe back the hair is all right, but it's getting bare on\nthe temples. He's rather tall, pretty straight, leans his\nhead a little forward, holds himself well when he's\nthinking of it, stoops a little sometimes. This is someone\non the earth plane, the young man goes to see him on\nthe earth plane.\nOn this the sitter notes :\n\" An excellent description of\nthe communicator's father.\"\nIt happens that I am myself acquainted with the man\nwho is here described, and certainly the description strikes\nme as a good pen-sketch, above Feda's average. The\nanonymity of the sitter was carefully preserved, and there\nis no reason to think that Mrs. Leonard can have had\nany normal knowledge concerning her family circumstances\nand connexions.\nIt is surely difficult to suppose in such a case that the\nman who is described was taking any part in the sitting,\nthat he was materialising himself. The description seems\nto fall into the same class as the descriptions of inanimate\nobjects to which I have referred ; the agent would seem\nto be the purporting communicator who is seeking to\nestablish his own identity. I put forward these objections\nto the materialisation theory briefly and tentatively for\nthe consideration of my readers. For my own part, I am\ninclined to adopt as a working hypothesis the theory that\nthe appearances which Feda describes are more or less\nexternalised mental images telepathically induced, but\nderiving, in some cases at any rate, from other sources\n\fLxxxii.] Symptoms associated with Comm unicator s Death. 23\nthan the mind of the sitter, perhaps from the mind of\nthe ostensible communicator.\n\u00a7 II. Circumstances and Physical Symptoms associated\nWITH A Communicator's Death.\nAfter describing a communicator's personal appearance\nFeda will often go on to give some account of what she\ncalls the passing-over conditions.\" At a first sitting\nthere is not usually any attempt at a detailed diagnosis ;\nthe circumstances of the death or the physical symptoms\npreceding it are described only in general terms. In the\ncase of communicators who have died in the war Feda\nalmost invariably asserts that their death has been speedy,\nand here again we can probably trace a tendency to\na priori reasoning and a desire to comfort the sitter.\nI do not know what the exact statistics may be, but\nI imagine that of those who have died in the war the\nmajority have died at least within a few hours of being\nwounded, and Feda usually follows her assertion that\nthe death was \" sudden \" or that the communicator died\n\" rather quickly \" by an assurance that he did not feel\nany pain. Doubtless sitters have often questioned her as\nto whether the communicator suffered much, with a\nstrong hope of obtaining an answer in the negative.\nIn the case of communicators who have presumably\ndied natural deaths, some attempt is usually made to\nlocate the bodily ailment from which they suffered ; for\nexample, Feda will say that it was connected with the\nthroat or with the heart, that there was some pain in the\nregion of the kidneys, and so forth. An instance has\nalready been given above in which the physical condition\nof a communicator during the last years of her life was\ncorrectly indicated (see p. 19) ; another instance occurred\nat a sitting on February 25, 1918. Feda was speaking of\nan ' elderly lady \" whom the communicator thought to\nbe his mother, and remarked :\nThis lady didn't pass over suddenly like the young\nman. Her passing over, when it carae, was pretty peaceful,\n\f24 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nbut she'd been ailing for some time. There was some\npoor condition in the blood, something internal. She's\nnot very jjale, but the condition of the blood was not\ngood for some time, not clotted, stagnated somehow.\nFeda should think the legs or feet had felt it. She pats\nherself on the legs.\nUpon this the sitter comments thus :\nMy mother had a long illness, but died suddenly at the\nlast. She died from tubercular disease, which developed\nat the knee joint, and before her death her leg was\namputated.\nThe strength of the evidence in this case lies in the\nfact that Feda rarely locates ailments of any kind in\nthe legs, and they are not a frequent seat of fatal disease.\nThe incident, therefore, is not easily explicable by chance-\ncoincidence.\n\u00a7111. Names and Initials.\nAt almost every sitting a considerable number of letters\nof the alphabet are given, said to be the initial letters of\nnames, either of persons or j^laces connected with the\ncommunicator. Sometimes these letters are spoken by\nFeda, who represents herself as repeating what the com-\nmunicator has said to her, sometimes they are drawn in\nthe air, or on the sitter's hand, and have to be inter-\npreted by the sitter or the recorder. This second method\nis not under any circumstances a very satisfactory one,\nsince there is often considerable difficulty in correctly\ninterpreting Feda's drawing ; with inexperienced and\nperhaps indiscreet sitters it is decidedly unsatisfactory.\nIt will inevitably hajjpen that they sometimes interpret\nas a letter which they know to be relevant a scrawl\nwhich in the eyes of the ignorant and therefore unpre-\njudiced recorder is not clearly decipherable. Feda herself\nis quite aware of this danger, and I have heard her ask\na sitter not to interpret her drawings, but to let her\ninterpret them herself and name the letter which they\n\fLXXXII.] Names and Initials. 25\nare intended to represent. This she will usually do, if\ngiven time.\nAt a good sitting it will generally be found that only\na few initials are given, of which most, if not all, can be\ninterpreted by the sitter as representing relevant names.\nBut even at its best this particular kind of evidence\ncannot carry much weight ; too much is left to inter-\npretation, and too much scoj^e given for chance-coincidence.\nWhen, for example, a communicator is said to be \" build-\ning up \" a letter which either stands for his own name\nor the name of someone closely connected with him, or\nmight even stand for a place with which he was closely\nassociated, it is as likely as not that some name fulfilling\none or other of these conditions, and having the given\ninitial, could be found in the circumstances of almost any\ncommunicator. At bad sittings, when it seems as though\nlittle or no supernormal knowledge of any kind can be\nobtained, Feda is apt to resort largely to this giving of\ninitials, showering them out apparently in the hope that\none or two will hit the mark and perhaps afford her a\npoint de repere from which to proceed to something more\ndistinctive.\nThe giving of names, especially of surnames or of rare\nChristian names is a far more satisfactory form of\nevidence, and some communicators appear to have, or\nat any rate to acquire with practice, a considerable\nfacility in giving names ; but it is rather unusual for any\nnames beyond the more ordinary Christian names to be\ngiven at a first sitting. There is, however, one case in\nthe period under review in which a quite uncommon\nname was correctly given to a new and anonymous\nsitter. This incident occurred in a sitting which was\nremarkable in some other respects also. But is not\nfurther discussed in this report. An elderly man was\npurporting to communicate, and after a good description\nof him had been given and other relevant statements\nmade, Feda observed :\nFeda. He's trying to say a name, it's a name more like\nMoison or Morrison.\n\f26 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nSitter. Like Morris ?\nF. Yes, Morrison. [SoUo voce : Mois, Morris.) It's not\nquite as long as Morrison. Mois\u2014Morris\u2014Morris.\n[Feda begins drawing in the air, and draws the\nfollowing letters m. u. r. k. o u g.] It's a funny\nname ! Even now Feda can't say it ; it's something\nhe thought you would recognise.\nSitter. I do, and it's very good.\nThe sitter identified the purporting communicator as her\nuncle, whose Christian name was Murrough. It will be\nseen that the name was correctly given with the exception\nof the final H, and it is worth noting that the letters\ndrawn by Feda were on this occasion interpreted by the\nrecorder to whom the relevance of the name Murrough\nwas not known.\nThe difficulty that communicators apparently find in\ngiving their own or their friends' names is often adversely\ncommented upon by sceptics. Is it reasonable to suppose,\nthey say, that nearly all those who communicate have\nforgotten an item of knowledge so familiar to them as\ntheir own names ? But this criticism overlooks the fact\nthat we are not warranted in assuming that a com-\nmunicator has forgotten a thing because he cannot com-\nmunicate it, or, in other words, because the necessary\nbrain mechanism whether for sjieech or for writing is not\nset in motion. Whatever the ultimate source of a com-\nmunication may be, there is no question but that the\nbrain of the automatist is used in recording it, and it\nappears a priori probable that some unusually strong\nstimulus might be necessary before an automatist would\ngive utterance to a name with which she was quite\nunfamiliar, a name with which she had no ready-made\nassociations tending to evoke it. Some support is lent to\nthis suggestion by the fact that upon the only two\noccasions during the period under review when the surname\nof an anonymous sitter was given by Feda as a name\nclosely connected with the supposed communicator, it can be\nproved that Mrs. Leonard had some previous knowledge\nof these names, and had associated them in her mind\n\fLxxxn.] Names and Initials. 27\nwith possible sitters. The circumstances were as follows :\neach of the two sitters had had some correspondence with\nMrs. Leonard under their own names with a view to\nobtaining an appointment, which, however, Mrs. Leonard\nhad been unable to give them. Subsequently they got\ninto touch with the Society for Psychical Research and\nobtained a sitting through the Leonard Committee. They\nhad never seen Mrs. Leonard, and so far as I have been\nable to ascertain she had no normally acquired knowledge\nwhich would lead her to conclude that the anonymous\nsitters whom the S.P.R. sent to her on two particular\ndays were a particular two out of the large number of\npeople who had recently written to her for appointments\nand failed to get them. At the same time it seems\nlikely that Mrs. Leonard's previous acquaintance with their\nnames was a relevant factor in the case ;\nFeda, as she\nherself sometimes expresses it, found the names \" ready in\nthe medium's brain.\"\n\u00a7IV. Various Topics which recur frequently.\nThere are several other topics to which allusion is\nfrequently made at sittings, such as articles belonging to,\nor closely associated with, the supposed communicator,\nanniversaries of important events in the lives either of the\ncommunicator or of the sitter. I have not thought it worth\nwhile to discuss any such incidents in detail here, but in\nthe appendix to this paper I have included a considerable\nnumber of extracts from sittings grouped under various\nheadings, which, in conjunction with the information\nsupplied by sitters as to the correctness or incorrectness\nof the statements made, will enable readers to form their\nown conclusions as to the value and significance of the\nevidence thus obtained. Briefly, it may be said that,\nwhilst the evidential value of these recurring topics is\ninevitably diminished by the mere fact of their recurrence,\nthey do- occasionally form, as suggested above, p. 10, a\npoint de repere for really good evidence of knowledge super-\nnormally acquired.\n\f28 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\n\u00a7V. A Successful First Sitting.\nI now propose to give an account in some detail of a\nsitting which I consider to be on the whole the best first\nsitting obtained during the period under review. The\nsitter on this occasion was Mrs. Montagu and I acted as\nrecorder. Mrs. Montagu, who lives in Devon, sat anony-\nmously, and except the immediate members of her family\nand the members of the Leonard Committee no one knew\nanything of her appointment. The sitting took place on\nMarch 5, 1918.\nAfter the usual whispers which herald Feda's arrival, on\nthis occasion rather prolonged, Feda opened the conversa-\ntion thus :\nF. Do you know any one missing ?\nMks. M. Yes. \u2022\nF. A condition of some one on the earth plane wants to\nget in touch, some one missing in the war. On\nthe earth plane, not in the spirit world. There's a\nlot of spirits round helping him. Quite a young\nman comes who has passed over, tall, rather\nslight, not broad, on the narrow side, holds himself\nstraight, not fat at all, the face rather thin, rather\ntowards the oval, the chin too square to be called\noval\u2014the nose shows the bridge a bit, a little\nlonger than yours\u2014the lips about medium\u2014the\neyes blue or bluey grey\u2014the eyebrows brown, not\nvery broadly marked, a little arched\u2014the hair\nbrown, short\u2014the eyes not quite right, he says\n[i.e. the description of them]\u2014the hair cut short,\nsmooth, neat and tidily brushed flat, away from\nthe face\u2014it looks straight, but he brushes it\nstraight\u2014a fine-looking forehead.

We're all helping, he says,\nas much as we can.\nMrs. Montagu's elder son, who was in the flying corps,\nwas reported missing after a raid over Hudova on the\nBulgarian front. She comments thus on the extract given\nabove :\nI heard definitely that my son had been killed about\nthree weeks before my sitting with Mrs. Leonard, but\nwhen the sitting opened so suddenly with the question :\nDo you know any one missing ? \u2014I was so startled\nthat I replied without jDausing to reflect. I suppose it\nfitted in with my own unconscious hopes. I had waited\nand hoped for news for three months.\nThe description of the first spirit described by Feda\napplies very well to my youngest son, who was killed at\nthe battle of Neuve Chapelle, March 10, 1915, except\nthat his eyebrows ivere strongly marked. He was well-\nbuilt, but his height (nearty six foot two) made him\nappear slighter than he really was.\nHe was hit in the head, and lived only a few minutes,\nbut was quite conscious, according to the account of his\nsoldier-servant who stayed by him.\nCommenting on the initial P, Mrs. Montagu says that\nthe name of her missing son was Paul.\nFeda then stated that some one in the spirit world\nwas helping who gave a letter J ; this person Mrs. Mon-\ntagu says might be her aunt Julia, who was much\nattached to her.\nNext Feda described two other young men who were\nsaid to be helping the missing one.\" These Mrs. Mon-\ntagu has not been able to identify. \" My son,\" she says,\n\" had hosts of friends in England and Australia, and since\nhis death was known I have received letters from people\nI never even heard of lamenting his loss.\"\nFeda then continued :\nThere's one spirit of a much older gentleman, past\nmiddle age, on the elderly side. He's tall, has been well-\nbuilt, but stoops slightly. He's got hair on his face, 'cause\n\f^0 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nFeda can't see the mouth distinctly. A greyish moustache\nshading the mouth\u2014the cheek-bones showing a little.

This older gentleman\npassed over before the others. Before he passed over, he\nused to suffer from his heart, not always, now and again,\nand some pain at the lower side of his back. Don't get\na name and initial, but he's been trying to help you.\nYou've had so much trouble, not only sorrow, but sus-\npense, more than usual. He says something about two\nchildren, not sure if he means in the spirit world or on\nthe earth plane\u2014think on the earth plane.\nMrs. Montagu comments thus :\nThe description aj^plies to my father. He suffered from\nhis heart now and then and also from kidney trouble.\nBy the \" two children \" my two daughters may be indi-\ncated ; both are living.\nLate in the sitting Feda returns to the subject of the\n\" elderly gentleman,\" thus :\nThe elderly gentleman seems to come to you and\nto another lady on the earth plane.

He didn't think he was, but he was.\nFeda don't think he'd have liked spiritualism very much.\nHe'd a very clever brain. He had a good many books\nround him, a room almost full of books round him, more\nin the earlier part of his earth life.\nMrs. Montagu comments thus :\nHe was distinctly orthodox, but prided himself on his\nliberal religious views, because he chsbelieved in eternal\npunishment ! Being a Scotsman he was brought up a\nPresbyterian. His little study at Bideford was lined with\nbooks, but he was middle aged then.\nFeda continues :\nF. {s.v. What ? Yes, wait a minute. Bridge, bridge, is\nit a place or a name ?) He gives Feda a name\nlike Bridge, a place he\"s lived at Feda thinks, or\nan important bridge there. Do you remember ?\nMrs. M. Yes.\nF. Like a j)lace you'd remember. It seems as if he'd got\nsomewhere outside the town, as if he'd live outside\nthe real town. . . . The ground about there isn't\nlevel like here, it's more hilly. Outside the town\nit's very hilly. You can see hills in the distance,\nlike big fat mounds of hills.\nMrs. M. Yes.\nF. When you get more outside, you see the big mounds.\nBut even the streets is not very level. There's one\nstreet lopsided. The houses on the right-hand side\n\f32 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nis lower, and the houses on the left\u2014there isn't\nmuch on the left, but they's like higher. To get\nto one you'd have to go up steps to it. The\ngentleman had to go to this street. Feda can see\nthis uneven street. A little terrace of houses and\nbetween this terrace and another house a little\nalley cutted through. When he passed up there,\nhe used to see it on one side.\nMrs. Montagu comments thus :\nBideford [where her father lived] has an old and famous\nbridge. We lived about half a mile outside the town. A\nvery good description of the town and the hilly country\nall round it.\nIn the midst of her description of the place where the\n\" elderly gentleman \" lived, Feda made two interpolations.\nImmediately after the reference to a bridge, she said :\nF. (whispering). Mow, Molesey, Mouston. He's giving Feda a\nname sounds like Molesey, a name much connected\nwith this place that he went into. Feda thinks\nyou'll remember after.\nMrs. M. I remember now. The name's not quite right.\nF. That's the nearest Feda can get.\nThis reference, Mrs. Montagu interprets as\nprobably Captain Molesworth, usually called \" Old\nMoley \" by his friends. He was greatly interested in\nBideford and Westward Ho ! and their development, and\nwas always starting schemes for building and for bringing\npeople into the neighbourhood.\nFeda then gave an account of another old resident in\nthe town whose name began with B and whom the com-\nmunicator met at a chemist's shop, which was described\nin some detail. None of this conveys anything to Mrs.\nMontagu.\nAfter the reference to the \" uneven street \" and \" the\nlittle alley,\" Feda continued :\nHe also knew some one there like Grimshaw\n\u2014\nsounds like that\u2014not quite right. Some one he\n\fLXXXII.] A Successful First Sitting. 33\nknew there too he's met in the spirit world. Quite\nan old gentleman with grey hair longer than people\nwear now and a grey moustache drooping. A\nstrong shaped nose, Roman shape, broad strongly\nmarked eyebrows\u2014the hair a little long at the\nsides, tiifty at the sides, almost white\u2014white more\nthan grey\u2014a broad forehead, rather bald on top\n\u2014\npretty tall, but not very ui^right towards the end\nof his life. He used to walk about this place, his\nhead a bit forward, his head on his chest. Some\none your gentleman often talked to there. He was\na very good gentleman. He passed over some time\nago. He metted your spirit gentleman, and they\nhave long talks. They used to have talks on the\nearth plane, but they didn't always agree. They'd\nbe like friendly, but sometimes they didn't agree\nabout it. {S.v. Ask her if she remembers.) He\nwants to know if you remember the old gentle-\nman.\nMrs. M. Yes, I do.\nF. It made him laugh, because when that old gentleman\npassed over, he\"d expected such a different place.\nIt was so interesting taking him round and showing\nhim all the spirit places. He couldn't help being\nrelieved when he saw it, because in spite of his\ntheories and other things about his earth life\u2014like\n^ his profession\u2014he was a materiahst.\nMrs. M. I don't think that.\nF. He liked material things, his chairs, his tables, things\nlike that. It was like a contradiction. When he\npassed over, he was surprised to find soUd things.\nThey seem to think this rather a joke. Spite of\nall his theories he had a good hold on to the\nmaterial. He was a man what liked to imderstand\nthings. He didn't Avant things to be intangible.\nP'raps you can understand it that way.\nMhs. M. Yes. Is he helping too ?\nF. Yes.

Then he picked up, but\ndidn't get quite right. His passing over was quite\npeaceful.\nThe spirit comes with them of a lady, an elderly\nlady, a kind sweet face, a little serious-looking.\nPeople might think she was severe, but when you\nlook a second time, you're sorry you thought that\nabout her. Not tall, about medium height\n\u2014\nspreaded out in figure, like elderly people get\nwithout being fat\u2014her face had got a little bit\nhaggard, a little bit drawn round the mouth\n\u2014\ntowards the end of the earth part the chin sagged\na little. On the dark side\u2014it's hard to tell,\nbecause her hair had been getting grey. It looks\nlike brown hair, no fringes on her forehead, the\nhair brushed back rather straight. It fell apart a\nlittle in the middle. There's a photo shows the\nlittle parting, taken some time before she passed\nover. A little pale in face. She'd not been well\nfor two or three years before she passed over, not\nbeen strong, like weak internally all through her,\nnot been able to digest her food properly. She\nhad suffered from her nerves too, but she'd tried\nto keep them under control. {8. v. What do you\nsay ? What is it ? Not getting mixed up with\nhim ? Twitch, twitch.) Not sure if she means\nherself or the sj^irit gentleman. She keeps saying\nabout a twitching, not always, for a time, like not\nkeeping the head or neck quite steady. She says\nit wasn't always, like a temporary twitching, a\nnervous movement.\nShe seems to be with the spirit gentleman, the\nfirst elderly one, not the one with the beard.\nConcerning the above extract, Mrs. Montagu notes :\nThese seem to me to be an elderly couple whom I knew\nfrom childhood and of whom I was very fond. I have\n\fLXXXII.] A Successful First Sitting. 35\nbeen unable to find out whether the details of her last\nillness were correct.\nI now return to an earlier part of the sitting to take up\nthe thread of the two young men, the one said to be dead\nand the other alive, but missing.\nF. The one who's missing this is again\u2014has been reported\nbeing killed. They say he was wounded but not very\nseriously they think. Some one should have brought\nnews lately. If you haven't seen some one recently they\nmust be on the way, a man, they give a letter B. This\nis a man who should be able to give news, because he\nwas with him ujj to the time he was lost\u2014not just when\nhe was lost, but a very short time before that, saw him\ntumbling, tumbling over something, he says. That was\nthe last they saw of him.\nAnd again later :\nF. (whispering). Gar\u2014Garson, Feda don't know who this is.\nIt sounds like Garstin, Garland, some name like that,\nhasn't passed over either. He was missing about the\nsame time. Garside it might be\u2014hasn't passed over.\nMrs. Montagu comments thus :\nThis was unintelligible to me at the time of the sitting,\nbut when I showed the notes to my youngest daughter\non March 14 she brought me two letters from a Captain\nBurgen, one received by her on January 30, in which he\nsaid that he had heard that Gubbin, the man vho was\nbrought down at the same time as Paul had been sub-\nsequently reported a prisoner, and he wondered if Paul\nhad also been taken prisoner.\nIn the second letter, dated February 2, 191S, he says :\n\" Both machines were seen to come down from about\n11,000 ft. Everyone thought both were killed.\" But later\nGubbin was reported ''\nprisoner of war,\" and Paul \"sup-\npo.sed to be killed.\"'\nJust after the reference to the man B, who is said to\nhave news of the \" missing one,\" Feda remarked :\n\f36 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nF. Did you know the one who's missing got cut off\nfrom others ?\nMrs. M. Yes.\nF. He got cut off. It wasn't like with others in a\ngroup.

Because of the one that's missing they comes\nround. {S.v. Flying in a machine. That's how it\nhappened. Engine trouble as well.) Don't know\nwhat it means.

Can you see where he is ?) That's funny.\nThey say he was in a church. [S.v. In a church.\nThat is funny. In a church.

Either the church, or\nthe place the church is in. Must be in connection\nwith the church, and a letter L again.

No, I've got nothing from the spirit world.\nF. Had they tried to impress some one else to tell you ?\nMrs. M. Yes, a sister of mine will not believe the official\nnews.\nF. It seems to Feda it's no wonder she won't beUeve,\nbecause they've tried to impress her. They keep\non saying \"reported killed.\" Do you know who\nthey've been going to see on the earth plane\ncalled M ?\nMrs. M. I can't think at the moment.\nF. (S.v. Is it a lady ?) Feda thinks a lady, but not\nsure. They keep saying \"M will help.\"\nThis first spirit's very happy in the spirit world,\nbut trying to help in the other case, because there\n\f38 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nwas a little uncertainty about his passing over for\na time. His uncertainty was cleared up fairly\nsoon, but the little bit made him terribly worried\nfor fear some one should be anxious about it.\nFeda thinks one of the spirits should be called R,\nlike that [F. draws an R.] {S.v. Going up\u2014can't\nhave been in winter then\u2014rather a hot climate\n\u2014\nthis is March.) The spirit says something about a\nhotter climate, he seems to have been very hot.\nFeda thinks he means when he was on the earth\nplane, but Feda didn't want to get it mixed up\nwith the one who's missing.\nAnd a little later :\nJ''. {S.v. Wait a bit. Margery. Wait a bit.) Keep on\ngetting a name, not sure if it's Margery or Mar-\ngaret. Not the letter M Feda got before. There's\nsome one on the earth plane, rather a young\nperson, whom one of these young men goes to see.\nFeda's almost sure it's Margery. You may hear\nabout this after.\nMrs. M. Is that the first young man ?\nF. Feda thinks so. He goes to see Margery and tries to\nhelp her very much. . . .\nUpon this Mrs. Montagu comments that the relation\nwho has passed over may be her younger son to whom\nshe referred the description given at the beginning of the\nsitting. The lady on the earth plane called M whom the\ncommunicators go to see may be Mrs. Montagu's sister\nMarion, to whom reference had just been made, but\nwithout mentioning her name. As to the reference to a\nhot climate, Mrs. Montagu notes :\nThe brother who was killed was in Bermuda with his\nregiment during the summer of 1914, before the war\nbroke out.\nThe statement that there was ever any uncertainty as\nto the fate of the son who was reported killed is incorrect,\nnor does the initial R mean anything to Mrs. Montagu.\n\fLxxxii.] A Successful First Sitting. 39\nMargery, she thinks, was \" my niece Margery of whom my\nyoungest son was very fond.\"\nThe names Stanley or Stanton, Bell and Williams or\nWilliamson were also given as being those of spirits who\nhad known the missing man and were now helping him.\nNone of these names convey anything to Mrs. Montagu.\nThere was also an allusion to the spirit of a girl who\n\" passed over very young \" ; she was said to be united to\nMrs. Montagu by a blood-tie, and to be helping also on\nthat account. Mrs. Montagu was not able to identify\nher.\nNow it will be seen from the numerous extracts I have\ngiven that whilst this sitting is in many respects typical\n\u2014\nbuilt up on what I have described as the usual scaffolding\n\u2014-it is conspicuous by reason of the large number of\ncorrect and evidential statements which it contains and\nthe proportionately small amount of padding and error.\nIt will be worth while to analyse and tabulate the evidence\nobtained with a view to estimating its value.\nTwo principal communicators took part in the sitting,\na young man identified by Mrs. Montagu as one of her\nsons, and an old man identified as her father. In proof\nof the young man's identity we have the following points :\n1. Description of personal appearance.\nThis, according to Mrs. Montagu's testimony, is good,\nbut not entirely correct. Feda is wrong, she says, in\nstating that the eyebrows are \" not very strongly marked,\"\nand this is a point upon which one would not expect a\ngood observer to be mistaken, for strongly marked eye-\nbrows are a conspicuous feature in any face.\n2. The circumstances of death.\nFeda is correct in saying that the communicator died in\nthe war, \"not quite instantly,\" and that he was hit in\nthe head. She is wrong in saying that he was also hit in\nother parts of the body, and in suggesting that there was\never any doubt as to whether he had been killed or not.\nTwo other veridical points which this communicator gives\nare the allusion to a hot climate, he having been in\n\f40 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nBermuda just before the war, and the allusion to Margery\nas the name of someone he tries to help, Margery being\nidentified by Mrs. Montagu as her niece.\nIn regard to the older man, more evidence is given.\n1. Description of personal appearance and bodily symptoms.\nThe description is not very detailed, but is said to be\ncorrect so far as it goes, and it is immediately followed by\na correct statement concerning physical symptoms, the\nheart-trouble and the pain in the lower side of the back.\n2. Description of places and persons connected with the\ncommunicator.\nSeveral good points are made concerning the place and\ncircumstances in which the communicator lived ; the place\nis said to be far from London, to be in the midst of hilly\ncountry, the town has irregular streets built on a slope,\nthe communicator is said to live a little way outside this\ntown and emphasis is laid upon a bridge. All these\nstatements are perfectly intelligible to the sitter in refer-\nence to the communicator's home at Bideford. The\nreligious standpoint of the communicator is correctly\nindicated\u2014that he was, in fact, more orthodox than he\nthought himself, an appropriate reference is made to\nbooks and some evidence is given concerning friends whom\nhe knew at Bideford. He names three and only three\ninitials ;\nthey are said to be those of women now dead\nwho are closely connected with him and with each other.\nThese initials are those of his four sisters, two of the\nsisters having names which begin with the same letter.\nHe also makes a quite intelligible reference to two chil-\ndren, said to be alive, whom Mrs. Montagu identifies as\nher two daughters. The only statement of any importance\nmade by this communicator which Mrs. Montagu could\nnot place at all was the description of the friend called B\nwhom he used to meet at a chemist's shop.\nThe theme with which both these communicators are\nprincipally concerned\u2014apart from offering evidence of their\nown identity\u2014is the fate of Mrs. Montagu's elder son,\nand their statements upon this matter involve considera-\n\fLxxxn.] A Successful First Sitting. 41\ntions of some interest and significance. On the one hand,\nnot only is the fact instantly apprehended that Mrs.\nMontagu has been in great anxiety and suspense concern-\ning the fate of a young man reported missing at the front,\nbut a considerable amount of knowledge is shown in\nregard to him. The initial P is given, his name having\nbeen Paul ; an appropriate reference is made to flying ; it\nis intimated correctly that a man whose name begins\nwith B can give some news of him and that another man\nreported missing at the same time is still alive ; in\nconnexion with this man Feda makes several shots at a\ntwo-syllabled name beginning with a hard G, the name\nbeing in fact Gubbin. Finally it is stated that the missing\nman \" was in a church,\" he having dined in a church on\nthe night before he was reported missing, as was known\nto Mrs. Montagu.\nOn the other hand, it is clearly and expressly intimated\nthroughout the sitting that the missing man is still alive,\nwhereas humanly speaking it is certain that he was at\nthat time dead. Into the theoretical questions which this\nraises I will not go at any length, but I will put one or\ntwo points forward for consideration of my readers and\nI will draw one practical conclusion. On two other\noccasions during the period I am considering sitters were\npresent who had near relatives missing at the front, and\nthis fact was recognised at the sittings. On both occasions\nthe missing men were declared to be alive, and details\nwere given of their whereabouts ; in both cases no news\nhas so far been received of these men. Whether they\nwere alive or dead at the time of the sitting is to some\nextent an open question, and in all probability we can\nnever have any proof that they were already dead,\nalthough, if, as appears to be the case, they are dead\nnow, it is likely that they were dead then ; for they had\nalready been missing a very considerable time. These\nthree cases taken together suggest that it is Feda's ten-\ndency to say that missing men are alive. In this she\nmay be actuated by that same sympathy for the sitter to\nwhich I have already referred\u2014no one is willingly the\nbearer of ill-tidings\u2014or she may be unconsciously\n\f42 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\ninfluenced by the hopes and desires of the sitter. However\nthis may be, it would certainly appear that the source of\nher supernormal information is such that she cannot\nclearly discriminate as to whether a particular individual\nis, as she would express it, \" on the earth plane \" or \"in\nthe spirit world.\" This hypothesis is corroborated by the\nfact that on at least two recorded occasions she appears\nto have made the opposite error, bringing forward as\npurporting communicators, men who are still alive.^\nThe practical conclusion which I shall draw from these\nfacts is that it is useless, and indeed worse than useless,\nto endeavour to obtain from mediums information about\nthe fate of people who are missing. If crucial mistakes\n\u2022are liable to occur even in unusually good sittings, such\nas Mrs. Montagu's, what guarantee can we ever have as to\nthe trustworthiness of the statements which are made ? It\nshould be stated that at Mrs. Montagu's second sitting,\nwhich does not fall within the period discussed in this\npaper, the young man who on the first occasion was said\nto be alive and missing appeared as a communicator\ntogether with his brother ; he gave his full name Paul,\n\u2022only the initial P having been given before. No statement\nwas made as to his having died since the previous sitting,\nso that the earlier mistake would appear to have been\nrectified. This, however, does not change the fact of its\nhaving been made.\nIf we scrutinise the evidence obtained at Mrs. Montagu's\nfirst sitting in the light of our general knowledge of what\nis usually obtained at sittings with Mrs. Leonard, we shall\nsee that its value consists in the fact that not only are\nthe correct statements numerous in proportion to those\nwhich are incorrect, but they are of a distinctive kind.\nWe do not find, for instance, at sittings with Mrs.\nLeonard frequently repeated descriptions of an old-fashioned,\nirregularly built town surrounded by hilly country and\ncontaining an important bridge. When, therefore, such a\n\u2022description is given and is appropriate to the purporting\n1 See below p. 133 for one of these cases. The other case, in which a\n:good deal of rather striking evidence of identity was obtained, does not\nfall within the period under review here.\n\fixxxii.] A Successful First Sitting. 43\ncommunicator, that is a good point. Again, allusions to\nflying are rare, and since airmen are few in jDroportion\nto the total number of soldiers, that also is a good point.\nI have tried in this section of my paper to give my\nreaders some idea of the results obtained at typical first\nsittings, good, bad and indifferent. The various points to\nwhich I have referred are coj^iously illustrated in the extracts\nfrom sittings given in the Appendix to this paper, from\nwhich readers can draw their own conclusions. In con-\nclusion I should like again to call attention to the fact\nthat evidence obtained at first sittings does not represent\nat all the best that is obtainable from Mrs. Leonard, or,\nfor that matter, from any other genuine \" trance-medium.\"\nI now turn to the consideration of a few selected\nincidents occurring at sittings taken by \" old sitters\n\"\nduring the period under review.\n\f44 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nPART II.\nEvidence obtained by Old Sitters.\nAs I have stated above, the object of this paper is mainly\nto consider what kind of evidence is hkely to be obtained\nat a first sitting with Mrs. Leonard. I shall include,,\nhowever, a few extracts from sittings taken by old sitters,\nwhich have been selected partly for their intrinsic interest\nand partly because they can be easily detached from\ntheir context. The greater number of these incidents\noccurred in sittings taken by Miss Radclyffe-Hall and\nUna, Lady Troubridge ; evidence obtained in this particular\nseries of sittings has the great advantage, to which I have\nalready alluded, that a complete record of every sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard taken by these two ladies is in exist-\nence, and a very full and careful statement concerning\nthe manner in which they first got into touch with\nMrs. Leonard, and the kind of evidence obtained at their\nearliest sittings not onh^ exists, but is available to readers\nof the Society's Proceedings {Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XXX.,\np. 339 \u00a3E.).\n\u00a7 I. Sittings taken by Miss Radclyffe-Hall and\nUna, Lady Troubridge.\nDuring the period under review Miss Radclyffe-Hall and\nLady Troubridge had thirteen sittings with Mrs. Leonard\nwhich formed part of the long series of weekly sittings\nwhich they have had for some time past. I shall assume\nthat my readers are familiar with their report on some\nof their earlier sittings, published in Proceedings, and it\nwill suffice to say here that in these later sittings also\nthe purporting communicator was A. V. B., as she has\n\fLxxxii.] Miss Roddyffe-Hall and Una, Lady Troubridge. 45\nbeen called, an intimate friend of Miss Radclyffe-HaH's\nwho died in 1916. At each of these thirteen sittings a\nconsiderable amount of time was occupied in giving a\n\" book-test\/' but this part of the evidence has already\nbeen discussed by Mrs. Sidgwick {Proc, S.P.R., Vol.\nXXXI.). I propose here to give several instances in\nwhich the purporting communicator gave evidence of\ncontinued memory, especially of names with which she\nhad been familiar during her lifetime, and some instances\nalso in which knowledge of an apparently supernormal\ncharacter was shown concerning recent events.\n1. The Dog Rufus.\nAt a sitting on March 6, 1918, at which Lady Trou-\nbridge was the sitter and Miss Radclyffe-Hall the recorder,\ngood evidence was obtained concerning a collie, called\nRufus, belonging to Miss RadclySe-Hall, which had lately\ndied. The sitting opened with a further allusion to Lady\nTroubridge's terrier, Billy (see Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XXX.,\np. 487), and the following passage then occurred :\nF. . Do you remember another dog altogether, a really\nbig dog ? A dog that had a back that high ?\n(Feda indicates with her hand about the height of\na coUie or a retriever dog, U. V.

Feda thinks he's got something darker on his nose.\nHe was a clever dog too when he was on the\nEarth Plane, yes, she says he was. He lived at\na house that was properly in the country ;\n(s.v.\nused to come up in the mornings ? what ?). She\nsays he used to come up in the mornings, Feda\ndon't know what she means. Early in the morn-\nings he used to run about in a garden place, and\nthen he would be let to come up into the house.\nIt's a big house standing by itself, and it seems\nto be raised up as if there was a kind of bank\nhad been built, and the house builted on top of\nit. Feda don't know what you say, but there\nseems to be several steps going up to the door,\nnot just two or three, and the ground floor windows\nseems a bit high, as if there was a space between\nthem and the ground, they's higher than is usual\nfor ground floor windows, it's like when you's\nstanding in the path you look up at the windows\na bit.

She's showing Feda\nwhat he's like, he was a tall man, about the\nmiddle of life, but he looked young, he had a\nmoustache, not a tiny one.

That's a\nfunny name !\nConcerning the description of the dog given above, Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge in their notes to the\nsitting state that it is\ncorrect for M. R. H.'s sable collie who died on January\n18, 1918. . . . Feda goes a little wrong when she speaks\nof his having longer hair that is wavy on the tips of his\nears. The collie, whose name was Rufus, had not got\nperceptibly long, and certainly not wavy, hair on the end\nof his ears, though it must be admitted that the hair\ngrew down slightly beyond the tips. Feda is right when\nshe states that his coat was not quite straight, however.\nFeda's statement that this dog is lumpier \" than Lady\nTroubridge's terrier, that its feet are longer and bigger,\nand that it has longer hairs sticking out from the end of\nits feet is also said to be correct. Witli regard to the\ncolour of the dog's eyes they were not hazel, as stated by\nFeda, but they were also not dark like the eyes of the\nterrier.\n^ There were five names besides Rune, all apparently names of\npersons ; four out of the five are known by Miss Radclyffe-Hall to\nhave been the names of friends of A. V. B.'s.\n\fLxxxii.] Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Una, Lady Trouhridge. 51\nThey were of a light golden-brown colour ;\nthey were\nbeautiful eyes, as she says ; the rims were black, and the\neyes wide apart. It is not quite apparent what Feda\nmeans when she says that the dog had something darker\non his nose. The dog's nose was black, but what she\nmay have noticed is that the hair receded a little on the\nbridge of the nose, exjaosing the black skin.\nA more detailed description of this dog was obtained\nat a later sitting (see below, p. 55).\nThere is some confusion at first concerning the owner-\nship of the dog. In reply to a question it is intimated\nthat Lady Troubridge will like to see him when she\n\" goes over to the spirit-world \" ; this statement is at\nonce corrected, and it is said that the dog was one which\nA. V. B. knew. In point of fact, although it is correct\nto say that A. V. B. knew the dog, he belonged to Miss\nRadcly\u00a3fe-Hall, as was recognised at a later sitting. A\ngood point is made when it is stated that A. V. B.\n' takes more interest in animals now than she did when\nshe was here,\" since during her lifetime A. V. B. had not\nbeen much interested in animals.^ Feda's statement con-\ncerning the date of the dog's death, that he had died\n\" a good long while \" after A. V. B. but not \" just\nlately \"'\nmay be considered fairly correct, but is not very\ndefinite. The dog had been dead about seven weeks at\nthe time of this sitting and had died nineteen months\nafter A. V. B., the date of whose death Feda must be\nheld to know approximately, since at Miss Radclyffe-Hall's\nfirst sitting, in August, 1916, A. V. B. was correctly said\nto have died recently.\nIn reply to a request for \" some details about that dog's\nlife \" Feda describes a house in the country ; she also\ndescribes a man in some way connected with this house\nand gives two names. The house is identified by Miss\nI\nRadclyffe-Hall as Highfield House, one of two houses at\ni\nMalvern Wells in which the dog had spent most of his\nlife. Highfield House had already been described by\nA. V. B. through Feda (see Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XXX.,\np. 383) ; the distinctive feature in the later description\n1 Cf. Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XXX., pp. 362 and 495.\n\f52 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PABT\nwith which we are here concerned is the allusion to the\nhouse being raised up, \" as if there was a kind of bank\nhad been built and the house builted on top of it.\"\nHighfield House, Miss Radclyffe-Hall states,\nstood upon a high terrace, and the terrace had evidently\nbeen built, as it was supported by a strong stone wall.\nFeda says there is a flight of steps going up to the door\n'\"not just two or three,\" and that the ground-floor windows\nseem a bit high. There was such a flight of steps\nleading up to the door of Highfield House, and the ground-\nfloor windows were perhaps higher than is customary.\nAfter the description of the house Feda describes a man\nin country clothes who, she says, used to go frequently\nto the house ; she then gives two names, first a name\n\" like Berforce \" and in connexion with it a letter M,\nsubsequently corrected to W in reply to a question from\nLady Troubridge, and secondly a name that is first said\nto \" start like \" Prang and is afterwards given as Per-\nrington.\nThere would seem to be some confusion in connecting\nthe man whom Feda describes with Highfield House, for\nin connexion with that house Miss Radclyffe-Hall can\nremember no such person. She says, however, that the\ndescription would apply well to a certain \" Squire Ber-\nrington \" who occasionally visited A. V. B. and herself at\nThe White Cottage, Malvern Wells, the house to which\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall moved from Highfield House ; \"he\nalways wore a tweed suit and invariably carried a stick ;\nhe knew the dog Rufus quite well.\" In view of the fact\nthat the name Perrington is spontaneously given and ^ after\nFeda has been told that the initial letter is wrong is\neventually corrected to Berrington, there seems little doubt\nthat it was to Mr. Berrington that the communicator\nintended to refer. But if so. Miss Radclyffe-Hall says,*\na mistake is certainly made when Feda describes his\nwalking round the house and shouting to some one at\nthe window, as Mr. Berrington was not an intimate friend\nand would never have been so informal.\n\fLxxxii.] Miss Raddyjfe-Hall and Una, Lady Troubridge. 53\nThis allusion would seem to be a picturesque addition by\nFeda.\nThe supposition that reference to Mr. Berrington was\nintended is strengthened by the fact that in connexion\nwith the man in the tweed suit and the name that\n\" starts like \" Prang, given afterwards as Perrington, an\nattempt is made at a name hke \" Berforce.\" Miss Rad-\nclyffe-Hall says that at Malvern Wells she and A. V. B.\nknew a Mr. Wilberforce, who was also a friend of Mr.\nBerrington's. - There is a special reason why A. V. B.\nshould remember this Mr. Wilberforce, and he was entirely\nconnected with that part of her life that was associated\nwith Malvern Wells and the collie, but with the White\nCottage, and not with Highfield House.\nMr. Wilberforce formed one of the little group of Roman\nCatholics that included, among others, A. V. B., Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall and Mr. Berrington. It would certainly\nappear as if the statements made at the sitting were, in\npart at least, derived from a group of A. V. B.'s memories,\nthe communicator having by a natural sequence of ideas\npassed from the recollection of one house at Malvern\nWells to that of another without the transition being\nmade apparent. A similar confusion arose on the occasion\nof an earlier reference to Highfield House and The White\nCottage (see Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XXX., p. 383). Whether\nsuch a confusion exists in the mind of the communicator,\nor only occurs in the process of transmitting ideas to the\nmedium, is a problem which we have no means of solving\nuntil we know far more than we do at present of the\nmethod of communication.\nPartly in consequence of the confusion described above,\nthe sitters were not absolutely certain to what dog Feda\nwas referring. In reply to a question as to what was the\nfirst letter of the dog's narne, she suggests that the name\nstarts with a sound like \" Jer.'\" She then apparently\ncorrects this statement by saying that A. V. B. is drawing\nthe letter R. Having been told that this letter would be\ncorrect in reference to one dog, and having been given a\nblock and pencil, Feda proceeds to draw first a house and\n\f54 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nthen a group of names, amongst them in large letters the\nname RUNE, which in reply to a question she says is\nconnected with the dog. The dog's name, as has been\nmentioned above, was Rufus, but Miss Radclyffe-Hall\nfrequently called him Rune. The writing of this name\nby Feda therefore constitutes an excellent point of evi-\ndence, which is further strengthened by Feda's remark\nthat although A. V. B. has written \" Rune,\" she says\n\" Runie.\" \" Runie \" was another form of the dog's pet\nname often used by Miss Radclyffe-Hall. Upon the\nquestion of what knowledge derived from normal sources\nMrs. Leonard might have had concerning the dog. Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall informs us that in August 1917, when\nRufus was still alive, Lady Troubridge had mentioned to\nMrs. Leonard that Miss Radclyffe-Hall possessed a collie.\nThis information was given during a short visit to Mrs.\nLeonard in Devonshire for the purpose of holding sittings ;\na record was kept of the various points mentioned during\nthat visit. Mrs. Leonard's love of dogs led to a reference\nbeing made to the collie, but no mention was made of\nhis name, or nickname, and no description was given of\nthe dog beyond naming his breed. Moreover, at the\nsitting of March 6, 1918, the dog is represented as being\n^'\nin the spirit-world,\" whereas in August 1917 Rufus was\nalive ; his death, in January 1918, did not occur in Miss\nRadclyffe- Hall's house ; it was sudden, and, in view of the\npossibility that it might be mentioned in a sitting, care was\ntaken that as few people should know of it as possible.\nBut even if Mrs. Leonard had heard by accident of the\ndog's death, she could not have learnt his nickname\nexcept by particular enquiry. In the early days of their\nsittings, steps were taken by Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady\nTroubridge to ascertain whether Mrs. Leonard was by way\nof making enquiries concerning her sitters, and the residt\nof this investigation was entirel}^ favourable to Mrs.\nLeonard.\nThree other points were given at the sitting of March 6,\n1918, as having some connexion with the dog Runie, as\nfollows: a name like \" Maggiore,\" a person whose name\nbegan with S, and a place with a name of which the first\n\fliXXXii ] Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Una, Lady Troubridge . 55\nthree letters were drawn by Feda as LIN. The reference\nto the name Maggiore is not understood by the sitters ;\nA. V. B. and Miss Radclyffe-Hal] had visited Lago\nMaggiore together, but this visit had no association with\nthe dog. The man's name beginning with S might be\nthat of the veterinary surgeon with whom the dog had\nbeen boarded on several occasions. This interpretation is\nconfirmed b}^ the allusion immediately afterwards to a\nplace-name beginning LIN. The veterinary surgeon's\nkennels were at Malvern Link, commonly known as\nThe Link.\nWe may now pass on to consider the further references\nmade to the dog at a later sitting on April 17, 1918.\nThis sitting took place immediately after the period of\nthree months discussed in this paper, but it will be\nconvenient for obvious reasons to include it here.\nThe relevant extract from the sitting, at which Lady\nTroubridge was again the sitter and Mss Radcly\u00a3fe-HaU\nthe recorder, runs as follows :\nFeda. {S.v. . . . What is it, a dog ? Whose dog ; wait\na mmute, wait a minute, can't quite see him\nLadye.) Feda can\"t quite see him but she's got\na big dog with her, quite a big one.

Ladye says he\nunderstands how much she loved him, and he's\nalways sajdng m a confidential and re-assuring\nway, \" It's all right, and you can tell me all that\nwhen you come over.\" Ladye says you needn't\npour yourself out to him, 'cos he sits and looks\nat you and says, \" Don't worry, don't worry, we\ncan talk about that when you come over.\"\nM.

Write that first letter in the air (Feda di'aws\nintelligibly in the air).\nun-\nu, V. T, I thought I understood that first letter.\nAfter it comes a letter like that (draws in the\nunintelligibly).\nair\nU. V. T. Do it on my hand (Feda draws something\nU. V. T.'s hand). Is that printed ?\non\nF. No, wroted.\nTJ. V. T. Never mind I can't follow.\nF. It looked like an S. to Feda.\nV. V. T. Yes, she did an S. in the air.\nThe description of the dog which is said to be present\na,t the sitting of April 17, 1918, so closely resembles the\nearlier description given on March 6, 1918, that on that\n.score alone it would appear almost certain that the same\ndog was referred to upon each occasion, and any doubt\nthere might be on the point is removed by further refer-\nences to the matter made by the A. V. B. control later\nin the sitting of April 17, thus :\nM. R. H. I'm glad you brought that dog.\nA. V. B. I've brought him over and over again, and I told\nyou his name, but I didn't connect it up with\nhim. I gave you his name and it's most im-\nportant.\nAnd, again, after some references to another topic :\nA. V. B. Rune, I knew you would be pleased, darling.\nM. R. H. It was sweet of you to bring him.\nA. V. B. You knew I'd have him, and he does love you.\n\f60 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nIt will be remembered that at the sitting of March 6,\n1918, the name Rune was given as being in some way\nconnected with the dog there described, although the\nnature of the connexion was not clearly indicated. It i&\ndoubtless to this slight confusion that A. V. B. is alluding\nabove when she says : \"I told you his name, but I didn't\nconnect it up with him.\" It will be remembered that on\nthe earlier occasion (see above, p. 46) there was some\nconfusion in regard to the ownership of the dog ; on this\noccasion the dog is clearly recognised as having belonged\nto Miss Radclyffe-Hall, for A. V. B. is said to be \" keeping\nthe dog for \" her. The description of the dog given on\nApril 17, 1918, is good and more detailed than the de-\nscription of March 6, 1918. Miss Radclyffe-Hall says in\nher note :\nFeda makes a good jjoint when, in describing the hair\non the dog's shoulders, she says that it turns out. and\nindicates by gesture hair turning upwards at the ends.\nThis, although not at all classical in a collie, was char-\nacteristic of the collie Rufus. Feda is correct when in\nspeaking of the eyes she implies that they are not of a\nvery dark brown. The little marks at the end of the\nmuzzle to which Feda alludes, are probably the little\nmarks at the root of the whiskers that are visible on the\nmuzzles of many dogs, and which were particularly visible\nin Rufus, whose muzzle was white. As Feda states, the\nhair on Rufus's legs was glossy and extremely velvety\nand smooth. A good point is made regarding his toes,\nwhich are said to be nicely divided ; a photograph of\nhim in my possession, which has never been seen by\nMrs. Leonard, shows this peculiarity of rather markedly\ndivided toes very clearly. Feda says that the toes look\nUghter at the ends, which would be true of one foot\nwhich was white, the leg being brown ; Rufus's other legs\nand feet were white laearly all over. Feda makes another\ngood point when she says the toes are not pointed, but\nare rounded, and that you can feel that they are \" little,\nshort, fat toes.\" This was a peculiarity of Rufus, so\nmuch so that a lady who knew him used to remark that\n\fxxxxii.] Miss Roddyffe-Hall and Una, Lady Troubridge. 61\nhis feet and ankles reminded her of an old gentleman\nof the foppish type, wearing very tight boots and tight\nwhite spats. On March 6th, 1918, Avhen describing\nRufus's feet, Feda said that they were bigger and longer\nthan those of U. V. T.'s terrier Benjamin (see above,\np. 46), and that also was correct, as owing to his breed-\ning, and the fact that he is a small dog, Benjamin gives\nthe appearance of having hardly any feet at all, a marked\ncharacteristic, and a show point of prize-bred wii-e-haired\nterriers ;\ntherefore, although Rufus's feet were plump and\nround, and tight-looking, they were bigger and longer\nthan are Benjamin's. Just after the reference to the feet\nin the sitting of April 17 Lady Troubridge asked a trick\nquestion, namely whether this dog had got a tail. She\nwondered whether Feda would describe a short tail like\nBenjamin's, or no tail at all, as she had done when\nreferring to a bob-tailed sheep dog at another lady's\nsitting. But Feda was not caught out, for she proceeded\nto give a correct description of a collie's tail.\nAfter Miss Radclyfie-Hall's statement that she had\nmissed the dog very much and wished he could under-\nstand, Rufus is represented as saying, \"in a confidential\nand re-assuring way,'\" \" It's all right, and you can tell\nme all that when you come over.\" \" Don't worry, we\ncan talk about that when you come over.\"' Now Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall's words do not on the face of them imply\nanything more than natural regret at the loss of an old\npet, but the reply put into the dog's mouth seems to\nimply that Miss RadclylJe-Hall had been worried about\nsomething which she would like to have an opportunity\nof explaining to the dog. And this was in fact the case.\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall had been feeling some remorse in\nregard to the dog Rufus, ever since his death on January\n18, 1918, for a reason which she thus explains in her\nnote :\nThe dog was sent to board in the country in the\nsummer of 1917, as he could not be taken to the lodging-\nhouse where I spent my holiday. On my return in the\nautumn [to London] I had intended to have Rufus home.\n\f62 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nbut the air-raids became so bad, and Rufus had showed\nsuch terror of them in the past that it was decided to\nleave him where he was until I settled in a country\nabode. . . . The order had just been given to send the\ndog to Datchet when a telephone message came through\nin the evening to say that he was dying.\nOwing to the breakdown of a motor, Miss Radclyffe-HalL\nwas unable to reach Rufus before he died, and con-\nsequently it had been much on her mind that the dog,,\nhaving spent his last months away from herself, to whom\nhe was devoted, had died alone. It was therefore appro-\npriate that Feda should ascribe to the dog words which\nseem to imply on the part of Miss Radclyffe-Hall a desire\nto clear up some misunderstanding. As already stated,\nprecautions had been taken to keep any knowledge of the\ndog's death from Mrs. Leonard, and, except Lady Trou-\nbridge, no living person knew that Miss Radclyffe-Hall\nthought she had anything to reproach herself wath in\nregard to Rufus.\nAfter a digression concerning the terrier Benjamin\n(omitted above), some further statements are made about\nRufus, all but one of which were correct. The habit of\nholding \" his head a bit on one side \" and looking \" kind\nof sideways '\"\nwas characteristic of the dog, and used to\nbe commented on when he was alive. It is also appro-\npriate to say of Rufus that \"he lives in the house, not\nin a kennel, he lives like what you call a Christian.\"\nThe dog during his lifetime was always kept in the house,\nand Feda makes a correct distinction upon this point\nbetween Rufus and Lady Troubridge's terrier Billy, con-\ncerning whom she said at a sitting on December 6, 1916,\nthat he was not kept in the house, but \" just outside\n\"\n(see S.P.R. Proc, Vol. XXX., p. 487). Mere guessing on\nFeda's part might have led her to surmise that a dog as\nlarge as the one she had described on April 17, 1918,.\nwould be kept out of doors.\nIn reply to a question as to the colour of the dog's\ncoat, Feda says it is brown, but, she says, it would be\ncalled by another name. She does not get nearer to this\n\fLxxxii.] Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Una, Lady Troubridge. 63\nname than to give the first letter, S. The dog was a\nsable colhe.\nThe point upon which Feda goes wrong is in describing\na particular plate which the dog is said to have used.\nRufus never had a plate of his own, but it is not an\nuncommon thing for a dog that is much petted to have\na special plate, and Feda would seem to be indulging her\nfancy here by adding what seems to her a likely touch.\n2. A Group of Names.\nOn several occasions during this period unusual names\nwith which A. V. B. had been very familiar during her\nlife were spontaneously given in the trance. One of these\nincidents occurred on March 13, 1917, during a \"personal\ncontrol,\" that is to say, when A. V. B. was pur-\nporting to communicate directly, by using the medium's\norganism herself, and not through the usual intermediary\nFeda. The relevant extract from the record is as follows :\nA. V. B. Morizion, Moritza, Morenze, oh isnt it annoying !\nIt's something I wanted to remember, a name.\nMore, Moren, Moren, Moren, Moren was the word,\nwith something else after it, Moren.\nM. R. H. I think you're getting near.\nA. V. B. Morena, Morena, Morenie, Morena !\nM. R. H. I think you've said a word I recognise. I recognise\nMorena.\nA. V. B. I know, Morena was quite good to get through, it\nisn't an ordinary word, is it ? There's something\nso excruciatingly funny about these sittings some-\ntimes, just getting words through. Morena is\nmore to do with the past, and B., oh darling\nsome wretched word that begins with a B, too.\nM. R. H. Quite right.\nA. V. B. And some awful and wretched word too\u2014 and\nsome wretched person whose name begins with an\nL too, they're all wretched when I can't get their\nnames.\n\f'64 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nCommenting on the above extract, Miss Radclyffe-Hall\nsays :\nMorena was a nickname given by A. V. B. to a friend,\nthe lady to whom this name was given being very dark.\nNobody except A. V. B. and I ever called her by this\nname. A. V. B. is correct when she says that Morena\nis more to do with the past, she is also correct when\nshe links up with this name the letters B and L. Two\nintimate friends of Morena's, both people very well known\nto A. V. B., have names that begin with a B and with\nan L. These two people were intimately associated with\nthe whole of A. V. B.'s friendship with Morena.\nAgain, on March 27, 1918, w^hen Lady Troubridge w^as\nthe sitter and Miss Radclyffe-Hall the recorder, a block\nand a pencil were given to Feda, who was controlling at\nthe time, and she wrote upon it the name Robert. Later\nin the sitting the following incident occurred :\nU. V. T. Ladye, shall I ask you a question to amuse you ?\nYou wrote a name here (indicates the block) called\nRobert. You knew a Robert, but you didn't call\nhim Robei't, what did you call him ?\nF. She\"s laughing. (Feda begins drawing in the air, but\nher letters cannot be followed.)\nIT. V. T. Make it a printed letter.\nF. A stroke down and a piece. (Feda draws a vertical\nline in the air \\\\itli a horizontal line sticking on to\nthe side of it.)\nU. V. T. That is no letter at all.\nF. She says it is, the piece is a curve. (Feda draws\nunintelligibly on U. V. T.\"s hand.)\nU. V. T. That's like a mouse walking over your hand.\nF. She says don t think her silly, but when you said\nthat, it reminded her of something to do with\nRobert, now she\"s building this up (Feda draws\nan R. followed by other unintelligible letters).\nU. V. T. I think she's Avriting Robert.\nF. She says no ! she doesn't want to write Robert !\n\fLxxxii.] Miss Radclyjfe-Hall and Una, Lady Trouhridge. 65\nU. V. T. Ladye, do try and write in capitals.\nF. One straight line, and another straight line, and a\nbar across him. (Feda draws H. distinctly in the\nair.)\nU. V. T. That's an H.\nF. Now like this. (Feda draws an I. in the air.)\nU. V. T. Yes, H.I.\nF. Do it again, now, after the I. Ladye. (She draws\nindistinctly on U. V. T.'s hand.) Can you get\nthat ? it's a round thing mth a piece on him.\n(Feda leaves U. V. T.'s hand and draws a D. in\nthe air.)\nU. V. T. Yes, that's a D.\nF. No, Ladye, that's not right, well like this ? (Feda\ndraws an A. in the air.) Not quite right Ladye,\nshe must go back. (Feda draws in the air H.I.D.A.\nand then a letter that is not understood.)\nU. V. T. Can you print the letter after A. Ladye ?\nF. Yes she must. Ladye, that isn't a printed letter !\n(Feda draws a printed G. in the air.) {S.v.\nHidagio. Hidagio. Hidag. Hidagil. Hidagio.)\nWhat a funny name ! Well she's doing that.\n\u2014\n(Feda draws in the air H.I.D.A.G.O.) (S.v.\nHidaljo ! Hidaljo !) She forgot the L., but she\ncan say it.^\nU. V. T. How ?\nF. Hidaglio. (This was pronounced as if it were\nItalian.) Yes, but she put a G. in it, that's not\n\u2022\nhow she spelt it! [S.v. Hidaglio.)\nIt will be seen that in reply to a question as to what\nwas the name which A. V. B. gave to a friend of hers\ncalled Robert, Feda drew the letters H I D A G 0 and\nstated that a letter L had been omitted between the\n^Possibly the omission of tlie letter L was due to a confusion with\nthe word \" dago,\" meaning a foreigner, a word probably known to Mrs.\nLeonard.\n'\nE\n\f66 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nletters A and G, thus giving Hidalgo. Commenting upon\nthis, Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall say :\nThe connexion between Robert and the nickname\nHidalgo is very interesting. Robert C was a great\nfriend of A. V. B.'s and M. R. H.'s ; he is rather Spanish-\nlookmg and in consequence was always called Hidalgo by\nA. V. B. There appears to have been some difficulty in\nmaking Feda pronoimce this unusual nickname, but she\nfinally managed to say Hidaljo, and then, giving the name\nan Italian pronunciation, Hidaglio. Tactful questioning\nhas elicited the fact that J\\Irs. Leonard once tried to learn\nSpanish, but did not proceed very far. The connexion\nbetween Robert and the mouse is not understood, but may\nbe correct.\nA third case of a distinctive name bemg given\noccurred on April 3, 1918, during a personal control, thus :\nA. V. B. I'm beginning to be able to think. (S.v. Selber\n\u2014\nSelbar\u2014) I can't get it, darling. Sem\u2014Sem\n\u2014\nSember\u2014Samber\u2014Sembar\u2014 isn't it stupid !

I know when I'm near, but it doesn't make it easier\nto get it. Next time I get it it's changed mto\nsomething else. {S.v. Sembenet\u2014Sem-bennett\u2014\n-\nSembennett\u2014Sem Bennett\u2014Sem Bene-e-e-) Per-\nhaps if I sing it !

(MeanwhUe A. V. B. is feeling\nU. V. T.'s face with her hand.) Oh darling t\nI didn't know I was pinching Una's nose. (The\nvoice here was very like A. V. B.'s.)

I wish I could get\nfurther than that, but I can't.\nThe name which A. V. B. was apparently trying to\ngive on this occasion was that of the well-known Italian\npoet Sem Benelli. She gets as near to this name as\nSem Benetti. In order to make it clear why A. V. B.\nmight wish to mention this name, some account must be\ngiven of two incidents which occurred at previous sittings.\nOn March 20, 1918, A. V. B. gave a book-test from a\nrow of Italian books at Miss Radclyffe-Hairs flat in\nLondon specially set aside for that purpose ; it was said\nat this sitting that, in accordance with a suggestion\npreviously made to her, A. V. B. was collaborating with\na communicator whom we will call E. A. ; in the course\nof giving this test she referred to a picture or photograph\nsaid to be in one of the \" test-books.\"\" Several of those\nbooks were by Sem Benelli and had photographs of the\nauthor pasted inside.\nOn March 26, 1918, at a sitting taken by Mrs. D. (see\nbelow, p. 68), E. A. purported to communicate and to\ngive a test from the same row of books from which\nA. V. B.'s test had been taken on March 20, 1918. It\nwas said on this second occasion that there was a picture\nconnected with the test books, the picture was said to be\nblack and white, and Feda endeavoured to pronounce a\nword which she said was connected with this picture.\nShe did not however get beyond ejaculating :\n\" Ser\n\u2014\nSe\u2014Se.\" She described the picture as being three-\nquarter length, and when given a block and pencil, she\nwrote :\n\" South, Sul, Sir,\"' and then \" Se \" followed by\nan indeterminate letter. The book-test began by the\nmention of this picture in which E. A. evinced consider-\nable interest. The description given by him through Feda\nwould apply to one of the photographs pasted into the\ntest-books, and the description given by A. V. B. on\nMarch 20, 1918, would apply to another. It is therefore\neasy to understand why A. V. B. should be interested in\nthe name Sem Benelli and should endeavour to mention\n\f68 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PART\nit at the sitting of April 3, 1918, especially as Sem Benelli\nis a personal friend of Lady Troubridge's.\n\u00a711. J. D.'s Sittings.\nThree sittings were held during the period under review\nby a lady whose name is known to the Society (of which\nshe is a member), but who will be referred to here as\nJ. D. J. D. has had a considerable number of sittings\nwith Mrs. Leonard, at which a friend of hers, whom we\n\\^dll call E. A., has purported to communicate. I have\nselected for mention here two incidents, of which one\nseems to indicate some knowledge of a contemporary\nevent unknown at the time to the sitter.\n\" - \u2022\nExtract from sitting of February 22, 1918. :\nFbda. He says what's the matter with the top of the\nhouse ? - .\n...\nJ. D. My house in the country ?\nFeda. Yes, he's laughing, he says he explores. He says\nthere is something the matter.\nJ. D. I must look.\nFeda. He says he explores and sees automatically and\nthinks, \" Oh, I'll tell J. that next time.\" He\n. doesn't mean to say he jumps down chimneys, but\nhe naturally has access to different parts of the\nhouse to what you have.\n'\u2022\n.\n'\nComment by the sitter. :\n'\nWhen I arrived home at 6 p.m. the evening after the\nsitting, the first thing I heard was that the smoking-\nroom chimney had been on fire that day about 12.30\n[p.m.], the very time E. A. asked me if anything was\nwrong.\nThe contemporary record of the sitting notes that it\nbegan at 11.35 a.m. and ended at 1.10 p.m. The reference\nto there being \" something wrong with the top of the\nhouse \" occurred towards the end of the sitting, probably\n\fLxxxn.] J. D.'s Sittings. 69\nbetween 12.30 and 12.45 p.m. The allusion to \" jumping\ndown chimneys \" suggests that the connexion of the\ntrouble with a chimney has been imperfectly transmitted.\nThe second incident I shall quote here occurred during\na part of the sitting when E. A. was purporting to\ncontrol the medium directly.\nExtract from, sittmg of March 26, 1918.\nE. A. Do you remember a dog's name beginning wdth\na T ?\nJ. D. No, I don't.\nE. A. ...

Yes, the pig is pork long ago ! Dear, where you\nphotographed with the pig ?\nJ. D. Yes, you had a photograph of me with the pig.\nE. A. Yes, isn't there a line running along the lower part\nof the photograph behind you, suggesting a path-\nway ?\nJ. D. Yes.\nE. A. And a border, a rather narrow border.\nJ. D. Yes.\nComment by the sitter.\nSix or seven years ago I had a pet pig that I had\nbrought up from a tiny thing with a bottle. I gave\nE. A. in 1912 a snapshot of myself with the pig. I was\nstanding on a grass path with a border of high flowers\nbehind.\n\u00a7 III. Mrs. Beadon's Sittings.\nMrs. Beadon is a member of the Society, and an\nincident which occurred at one of her sittings with Mrs.\nLeonard has already been recorded in the Jo^irnal (Vol.\n\fMrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nXIX., p. 226) ; some of her book-tests also are recorded\nin Mrs. Sidgwick's recent paper (Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XXXI.,\nI). 260 ff). On the occasion referred to below she took the\nnotes of the sitting herself, as she usually does. She is\nan experienced sitter and a careful recorder. The pur-\nporting communicator is her husband, Colonel Beadon ;\nthe names of the other persons concerned are known to\nthe Society, but pseudonyms are used here ; in selecting\nthe pseudonym Redhorn (see opposite) care has been\ntaken to represent as accurately as possible the degree of\nsuccess attained by Feda in giving the real name.\nExtract from the sitting of March 16, 1918.\nPeda.

She\ncould get no details and was terribly anxious. This was known\nto me, but not to the mediiom.\n^ Her son's name is [Richard], and though he is always called\n[Dick] I took it to mean his initial. What follows further on\nmakes me think it may have been the one referred to as \"some\none on this side helping.\" [See opposite.]\n' This is accurate of the father of the wounded boy.

Young Men.\nExtract, from sitting of January 15, 1918.\nFeda. Feda wants to describe one of the youngish men. He's\nabout twenty-eight or thirty, it's a bit difficult to\njudge. He's tall and well-built, holds himself\nstraight. He's about medium build and he walks\nwell, when he moves about. He's got a fine-looking\nface\u2014good features. His face slopes a bit towards\nthe chin, the chin isn't quite square. The mouth is\nabout straight, very nice shape. His nose shows the\nbridge a bit, it's narrow about the middle and narrow\nabout the tip, broadening towards the nostrils. The\neyebrows are well-marked, a little arched, brownish.\nThe forehead is square, not prominent. There's not\nmuch hollow between the forehead and nose. You'd\nnotice that if you have a photo taken sideways. His\nhair is short, a little away from the face. He's got\na brown skin, a little pale, but not naturally. That's\nthe passing over conditions.\nThe sitter notes that the age of the communicator,\nwhom she identifies as her husband, is correctly given.\nHe was twenty-eight when he died. The description she\nconsiders \" quite fairly good,\" but no point in it appears\nto have struck her as especially characteristic.\nExtract from sitting of January 17, 1918.\nFeda.

A smart\nappearance.\nThis is said by the sitter to be a good description of\nher son killed in the war.\nExtract from sitting of January 26, 1920.\nFeda. First Feda wants to describe a young man who seems\nmost impatient ;\n{s.v. wait a minute,) he's above\nmedium height, on the tall side, well builted, not\nstout or over broad, a nice shaped face, a bit more\noval than round ;\ngood features, j^retty regular. A\nnice mouth, about medium size and fullness. His\nnose is nearly straight, but the tip is rounded, not\npointed. The bridge shows quite a little bit, but it\ndoesn't make it a aquiline nose, the eyebrows are\ndarkish, bro-mi, and a little arched, and he has a\nforehead what shows a bit square at the temples.\nHis hair is bromi and quite short, brushed away\nfrom his forehead, (Feda indicates Avith gesture, hair\nbrushed backwards).\nFeda feels he has tried to get into communication\nwith Feda before, somewhere. His skin is nice,\nabout medium colour, and he holds his head straight.\nHis chin isn't pointed, it's round although the face\nslopes to it. It's a nice shaped chin and a very\nnice shaped face altogether.\nThe sitter notes that the communicator's height is\nwrongly given. He was \" if anything under medium\nheight, but well made.\"' Of the other statements he\nsays :\n\" Quite an accurate and detailed description.\nPhotographs can prove.\"\n\f76 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nExtract from sitting of January 28, 1918.\nFeda. Raymond and Bim are helping a young man to talk\nto this young man [the sitter]. He's tall\u2014about\nmedium\u2014well-built, and holds himself well ;\nhis face\n, . is not quite round, it slopes a bit towards the chin\n\u2014\nthe chin is rounded, pretty broad ;\nit's not a pointed\nface\u2014a firm mouth about medium sized, the lips a\nlittle full ; he holds his mouth straight, close together.\nThe nose shows the bridge a little, it comes down\nstraight and the tip is round\u2014it's not aquiline. His\nnose broadens a little at the nostrils\u2014it's not broad\nat the bridge. Feda can't see his eyes\u2014blue or\nbluey-gi-ey, the eyebrows brown, well-marked, not\nvery much arched from the centre part, brown, a\ngood-shaped forehead, rather a straight line, not full\n\u2022\nthe hair brown, cut short at the sides\u2014it sticks up\na little at the top ; he combs it back and a little\nsideways ; he doesn't agree it sticks up, but it's a\nlittle raised at the top, fuller.\nThe sitter notes that \" this is quite a good descriptioa\nof the communicator I hoped to meet, i.e. my brother.\"\nLater in the sitting Feda made a further reference to\nthe same communicator's appearance, thus :\nFeda.

There's a young man on the other side wants to speak\nto you. He kept saying a funny thing. Feda'll\ndescribe him. He's above the medium height, about\n'\n. medium in build, nice shaped face, a bit too long to\nbe roimd\u2014a nice skin and complexion\u2014the chin\n, .\nfirm, but kind\u2014the mouth not large, medium, the\n.\n\".. lips not very full, a little curved\u2014the lower part of\nthe face has got such a kind look, almost like a\ngirl's\u2014the nose almost straight, not sharp, a tiny bit\nbroader at the tip\u2014the eyes rather like yours in\ncolour, the eyebrows a little bit arched, brown\u2014\na\nnice forehead, well- developed\u2014pretty broad\u2014the hair\nyou'd call brown, short, a little longer at the top\nand with a crisp Avay of sticking up at the forehead\n\u2014\n.~ he brushes it away from the forehead\u2014when he\nbrushes it away, he's got a little bit sticking up a\n. little at the top. He's been to you before\u2014he tried\n\"\n. to get through several times. Wait a minute. He\nfeels you've felt him. He comes at night-time\nmostly, a bit in the day-time.\n,\nComment by the sitter.\nThe description given of my son is quite a good one.\nThe bit of hair sticking up on the top of his head, his\nhorn, as we called it, was a personal touch. His lips,\ndescribed as not very full, was wrong ; he had a very full\nunderlip, a pecuUarity of his father's family. The photo-\ngraph, which I enclose . . . shows the almost womanish\nsweetness of expression described by Feda.\nI give below an extract from a sitting on April 9, 1918.\nThis extract is included at this point (out of its order in\ntime), because the two sitters on January 29 and April 9,\n1918, respectively, were mother and daughter, and the\nostensible communicator was the same man, son to one\nsitter and brother to the other. It is therefore of interest\nto compare Feda's statements on each occasion. Nothing\n\f78 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nwas said to Mrs. Leonard to indicate any connexion\nbetween the two sitters, and there is an interval of over\ntwo months between them. It will be seen that the two\ndescriptions are generally speaking consistent. There is a\nslight discrepancy in regard to the shape of the eyebrows,\nand in the sitting of April 9, 1918, the words given on\nJanuary 29, 1918, in reference to the lips\n\u2014\" not very\nfull \"\u2014are omitted. There is, however, no indication of\nthe marked fvillness of the underlip to which the sitter of\nJanuary 29, 1918, refers. Below (see p. 130) I give\nfurther extracts from these two sittings to indicate other\npoints of connexion between them.\nExtract from sitting of April 9, 1918.\nFeda. {Sotto voce. Yes. I'm coming. Want to speak to\nher. Wait a minute.) Good morning. Give Feda\nyour hand. There's a spirit here of a man rather\nyoung. He looked at you. He thought some one\nelse might be here as well. He's tried to com-\nmunicate before, been to Feda before. He wants\nFeda to describe him. He's on the tall side, straight,\nwell-built, good shoulders, not fat, well-proportioned.\nHe's above medium in height but not in breadth.\nHis face is not round, it's a httle strong round the\njaw, it's too long to be called round.

There's several people on the other side trjdng to get\nthrough. A man-sijirit first. Feda thinks he looks\n\fLxxxn.j Description of Persoyial Appearance. 79\nabout as old as you [the sitter]. He's rather tall,\nnot fat, about medium, taller than medium in height ;\nthe shoulders broad, not a fat body, a fine -looking\nface\u2014good chin, a little square\u2014not a long square,\na rounded squareness\u2014rounded cheeks.

J., a friend killed early in the war. But that he\nshould ap23ear as a communicator was unexpected and\npuzzling, as, though I was very fond both of him and his\nwife, I was not one of their oldest or most intimate\nfriends, and none of the statements made applied to me,\nnor did I know if there was any truth in them.\nIt is of some interest that the description on this\noccasion was sufficiently distinctive to recall C. J. at once\nto the sitter's mind, although she was not expecting him\nto appear as a communicator. Some further statements\nwere made which were applicable to C. J. (see below,\np. 98 and p. 124), but they were not sufficiently definite\nto make identification certain.\nExtract from sitting of February 1, 1918.\nFeda.

[part\nmedium size, or a bit larger, and his lips are a bit\nfull. His face might be a bit broad, but it's not\nfat, so it looks about medium. His nose is not\nquite straight, 'cos it does show the bridge a little,\n; then it goes straight, and it's broader at the bottom\npart. His eyebrows are darkish brown, pretty well\nmarked, rather straight, and sloping down a bit at the\nends. He has a good shaped forehead, his hair is\nstraight Feda thinks, not curly, and it's cutted very\nshort. It's darkish brown, and it's brushed away\nfrom his forehead. This gentleman has passed on,\njjassed over.\n{Later in the same sitting.) Now Feda wants to tell\nyou that in the spirit world with him he has quite\na young man, like a boy, who Feda thinks passed\nover before him. He looks about eighteen to Feda,\nnot more, rather tall and rather slight in build, but\nwell proportioned and builted with it. He has\nrather a oval face, it's not thin and it's a nice\nshape, his mouth is medium size, the nose is straight\nand he has a nice shaped chin and it's round, not\npointed, though the face is oval. The eyebrows is\nwell marked and a little arched, they looks to\nFeda to be brown, on the dark side, but his com-\nplexion isn't dark, he has a nice pink colour in\nhis cheeks and a clear skin. His hair is dark\nbrown, and cutted rather short; it grows rather\nthickly and has got a shade on it of a lighter\ncolour.\nThe sitter notes in regard to these two descriptions that\nthey may refer to two near relatives killed in the war,\nhnt the descriptions do not appear to have struck her as\nstrikingly good.\nExtract frow, sitting of February 7, 1918.\nFeda.

There are several\nphotographs which might be referred to.\nHe [sitter's son] was about medium height, 5 ft. 9 in.,\nvery 6;-oa(i-shouldered, could not therefore be called slim.\nHe would be called on the fair side.

Feda gets\nHke an inflammation, an ache in his joints and a\nstiffness\u2014a great deal in his hands, because he's\nrubbing them.\nLater in the sitting the following passage occurred :\nSitter. My own father, do you see him 1\nFeda. Feda thinks he\"s coming up now.

It will be observed that this description was\ngiven in reply to a direct question, and Feda does not\nseem to realise that she is now describing a spirit who\nhas already appeared and been described earlier (if the\nsitter's supposition is correct). The second description,\nthat of the dark clergyman, is said by the sitter to apply\nvery well to a friend of hers, a connection by marriage.\nIn reply to the sitter's question as to whether the clergy-\nman's hands could be seen, Feda at first says that she\ncannot see them, but a little later, apparently still with\nreference to the clergyman, she describes a hand crippled\nby rheumatism. There would appear to be some con-\nfusion at this point.

He's not a young gentleman, a old\ngentleman, and he looks to Feda as though he had\nbeen a well-builted man, but towards the end of his\nlife he let his shoulders stoop a bit and dragged his\nfeet a bit slow, before he passed over. He's got\nsome grey hair on his face, so's you can't tell what\nshape his chin is. His nose shows the bridge, it\nisn't broad at the bridge, but it broadens a bit to\nthe nostrils. His eyes look to Feda rather deep set\nand so it's difficult to tell the colour, perhaps he\nwill open them later more.

They comes out just a little bit, not\nbadly like Englishes does.\nThe sitter on this occasion was Mrs. Sidgwick, whose\nidentity was known at the time to Mrs. Leonard. Con-\ncerning the above description, Mrs. Sidgwick comments\nthus :\nThe description of the old gentleman fits fairly well to\nmy husband as shown, e.g. in the portrait at the S.P.R.\nrooms. The left eyebrow, as compared to the right\neyebrow, was generally slightly raised next to the nose,\nowing to a scar. The hair was no doubt thinner than it\nhad been on the top of his head, but he was not bald.\nHe did not stoop or drag his feet, unless it may have\nbeen in extreme weakness at the end. He was only 62\nwhen he died, hardly so old a gentleman as is suggested.\nMrs. Leonard had not visited the S.P.R. rooms at the\ntime of this sitting and could not therefore have seen the\nportrait of Dr. Sidgwick which hangs there, but it may\nwell be that she had at some time seen his portrait\nelsewhere, though she is not aware of having done so.\nExtract from sitting of March 14, 1918.\nFeda.

What's in it ?\n^ Discussed in the immediately preceding part of the sitting.\n\fMrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nThere's a good many things in it, one thing's a funny\nrather shiny dark thing, it's got a dark cover, it's\nabout a foot long. It's got a light metal cap at one\nend of this dark thing, like silver looking. He had\nthat with him and he's not sure if it was sent back\nin the satchel.\nYou never got what was inside the dark cover.\nFeda don't think anything was, he used to use it, take\nit all in his hand, and there was something that as\nthough when he touched it went click, it was like\nan instrument.\nI think I know it.\n{8.V. Then\u2014what's that ? something he used to wash\nhimself with ought to have been in the satchel too.)\nHe says he was not able to wash much just before\nhe passed over. He says there was washing material\nrolled up at the bottom of the satchel. He says a\ncase or book with papers in it was in there too,\nwhen you ojoened it the paper seemed to be fixed or\nstuck in, fixed in so as not to fall out, that's on one\nside, on the other side was a compartment, that\nseems to have been there too. Another thing he has\nbeen looldng for is his watch.\nI got that.\nIt's one like this (touches a wrist watch on the sitter's\nwrist). . . . It's like this one isn't it ? (Touches\nwrist watch again.)\nYes, one of them is.\nHe says did a case come back with a little photograph\nin it ?\nNo, I want to know about that.\nHe says he had it with him when he passed over, it\nwas not a thing he would give to anyone, he's sure\nhe had it with him. Feda noticed him pause about\nthat, and Feda thinks that at one time he had an\nidea of leaving that somewhere, but he says he had\nit with him.\nCould he say who was in the photograph, or who I\nought to write to about it ?\nHe thinks he had it all the time.\n\fLxxxir.] Articles Associated with a Communicator. 121\nS.

Now G. has something to do with someone who could\nthrow light on the matter. He's pretty sure they\nshould be able to. Now wait a minute\n\u2014\nS. Can he describe the photograph to me ?\nF. (S.v. Yes he's trying to do that, something circular.)\nHe's drawing a shape like this (draws an oval on the\nsitter's hand) and he shows Feda that it's sunk in a\nlittle, and has a little raised ujd rim around. (Here\nFeda claps her hands together softly.) Feda don't\nknow what he's doing, he keeps opening and shutting\nhis hands {s.v. he seemed to put that between\nsomething).

Wait a minute,\nare you sure you're not mixing it up with S- ?)\nHe says you've got at home something that he's not\nsure if it belonged to him for not. He says he must\nexplain it's something he eels is being, or has been\nsent to you, that belongs to someone else. It will\nbe sent as belonging to him.\nS. I haven't got it yet.\nF. He's patting either his neck, or the front part of his\nchest, (Feda touches just below the collar in front)\nhe says you haven't got all his things yet.\nS. I certainly haven't.\nF. He says it must take a long time ! Something this is\nthat he's already see'd. Oh ! talking about photo-\ngraphs, he says did you know he had some photos\ntaken not mounted, they was soft paper things.\nThey was taken away from home, a few weeks\nbefore he passed over, Feda's only guessing the time.\nS. Less than a few weeks.\n\f122 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nF. Towards the end part of his earth life, he had several\ntaken, and he Says they went into different people's\nhands.\nS. Was there more than one person in the photograph ?\nF. In one he was alone, but on some there was certainly\nmore than one person, he says that's whj^ they were\ndivided up. In one Feda's not sure if he's sitting or\nleaning against something, but looldng at the photo-\ngraph something is raised up on the left hand side,\nit's about half way up the picture and it makes a\nline across the picture. (Feda makes a gesture\nindicating a horizontal line slanting upwards) whatever\nthis is it goes at the back of him too, looks like a\nbulky thing. The photograph is taken outside, not\nin a room.\nComment by the sitter.\nI certainly received a satchel, but there were 7io papers\nof his [the communicator's] in it. I got none of his old\nletters or papers.\nThere was an old memorandum diary or two among his\nthings, and an empty tobacco pouch, but not such a thing\nas Feda describes.\nAs I have received no photographs at all so far, I can't\nverify the statements.\nEvery medium I have ever been to has mentioned the\nphotograph of himself with two or more officers and one\nmedium has described some huts near which it was taken.\nTwo have said it was in a leather case and one said on a\npostcard. One other medium mentioned the round or oval\ncase which Feda speaks of earlier and which I believe\ncontained a photograph of me.\nIt will be seen that Feda's statements, so far as the\nsitter has been able to verify them, are not accurate, and\nso far as they correspond with ascertained facts, not beyond\nchance-coincidence. The fact that the sitter has had\nreferences made by several mediums to a photograph of\nthe communicator taken wdth other officers, which she has\nbeen unable to trace, suggests that such statements are of\n\fLxxxn.] Articles Associated with a Communicator. 123\nfrequent occurrence at sittings, and unless a photograph is\naccurately described in some detail not much importance\ncan attach to these statements.\nExtract from sitting of A'pril 15, 1918.1\nFed.4. Did you receive his [the communicator's] pocliet book,\nsix inches by four and a half, two compartments ?\nIt had a photo in it and a letter written only two\ndays before, but not posted.\nSiTTEE. We have not received it.\nComment by the \u2022sitter.\nI am writing to the army for information as to his\nbelongings. We have received nothing whatever.\nAdditional note. I wote the foregoing on 16th and\n17th April, [1918] ; this part I write on 18th June, 1918.\nI received a parcel from the War Office, Woolwich, over\ntwelve months after his passing over, containing his\npersonal effects. The parcel had been under sea water\nand the old wrapping destroyed, but in it was the pocket\nbook of the size mentioned and a mass of photographic\npostcards stuck together, and above all there was the\nletter to us, quite a long and exceptional letter for him to\nwrite.\nThis incident is of some interest because the knowledge\nshown concerning the pocket book and its contents was not\npossessed by the sitter at the time of the sitting. The\ncoincidence, however, is not very striking. Most men on\nactive service would possess a pocket book of about the\nsize mentioned, and it must fairly often have happened\nthat an unposted letter was found amongst a soldier's\nbelongings after his death.\n1 The notes on this occasion were made by the sitter. Immediately\nafter the reference to the pocket book quoted here, the sitters name\nwas correctly given {see above, p. 26).\n\f124 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\n\u00a7 IV.

He's building up a letter. [Feda draws. Interpretation\nvery doubtful.] K and J, but the J isn't to do\nwith the K. This spirit has tried several times to\nget through. He's taking Feda to a town by the\nsea\u2014a place he had to be at in his earth life in\nrather an important part of his life. It's not an\nordinary sea-side place\u2014it's as it proper ships go\nthere. The coast goes in there.

As you go up from the harbour, you go up\na winding road. About the middle of the town the\nroad opens out into a square place. 1, 2, 3, l\nturnings out of that\u2014and a kind of hotel place, a\nbit to the left as you come away from the sea.\nSomething that makes a dingle and a rumble\u2014sounds\nlike trams\u2014electric trams. It's not a big town like\nLondon, much smaller\u2014it's busy place\u2014at some\ntimes it's a quieter place. Big ships goes there with\nsails and steamers. An important letter connected\nwith that place. [She draAvs in the air.] Stroke\ndown, stroke down, and one across. [The recorder\ncould not see the drawing. It was interpreted by\nthe sitter as A.]\nSitter. Quite right.\nF. When you go away from the town, it gets a bit hillier.\nOn the left as you face the sea, it's a bit rocky.\nOn the rocks they've built something out\u2014there's a\nbuilding sticking up\u2014about as high a building as\nthere is. It's built near the water. The ground\nraises a bit on the right\u2014there's a bit near the\nwater is lower, but behind it's raised up. When he\nwas there, he went a little journey, back a little\u2014\na\nsort of joining place\u2014it was rather a nuisance going\nthere. He's impressing that strongly, as if it's\nimportant. After the letter A comes a small one\n[draws].\nSiTTEE. I can't see.\nF. Round and a little loop\u2014over again\u2014this is the third\nletter\u2014and then a long letter going up.\nSiTTEE. I think I know from the first letter what the place is.\nComment by the sitter.\nJ is the first letter of [the supposed communicator's]\nname. What follows is, it seems to me, a good description\nof Alexandria where I first met the J s. I have taken\nthe trouble to verify several points with a map of the\nto\\TO, and to go over the description with Mrs. Salter\nwho thought it quite good. It is not perfectly correct\n\f126 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nbut it is a more accurate description than I could have\ngiven from memory, though I lived there for nearly a\nyear. Feda has taken the town from, to me, its most\nunfamiliar point of view, the harbour, which except on\narrival or departure I seldom visited. It is true that as\nyou leave the harbour you go along a winding road until\nyou reach the Place Muhammad Ali, from which four\nprincipal streets do start. There is a large cafe there,\nbut I cannot remember the position. There are also\nelectric trams. Alexandi'ia is an important port, and\ncertainly a busy place, and the statement \" at some times\nit's a quieter place \" is very characteristic. During the\nwinter large steamers come in weekly from Europe and\nAmerica, bringing hordes of tourists. Winter is also the\ntransport season. In the summer all this, bustle stops.\nSummer is also the time when all of the European colony\nwho can depart for Europe. The statement \" when he\nwas there he went a little journey back, a sort of joining\nplace, it was rather a nuisance going there. He's im-\npressing that strongly as if it's important \" is also a good\npoint.

At the very beginning of the sitting\non April 9, 1918, Feda observed that the communicator\nhad \" tried to communicate before, been to Feda before,\"\nbut the connexion between the two sittings was never\nclearly recognised. The extracts given below show the\nmost definite points of contact ; there was nothing in the\ntwo sittings inconsistent with the supposition that the\nsame communicator was present at each.\nExtracts from sitting of\nApril 9, 1918.\n(1a) He passed over pretty\nquickly.

Some Evidence of Apparent Communication\nFROM A Person still alive.\nThe following report of a sitting taken by Dr. L. P.\nJacks is of special interest, because, together with refer-\nences perfectly intelligible to the sitter, statements were\nmade about a supposed communicator which might have\napplied to a son of Dr. Jacks, then fighting at the front,\nand some knowledge was shown which might have been\ntaken as going some way to establish the identity of the\ncommunicator, had Dr. Jacks' son been dead at the time\nof the sitting. In point of fact, he was, and is, still\nahve. This was the first sitting Dr. Jacks had had with\nMrs. Leonard, and he sat anonymously.\nRecord of the sitting of April 5, 1918.\n^\nFeda. a young man comes who knows this gentleman. He's\nabout twenty-two, on the tall side, about medium\nbreadth, very straight, holds himself straight, got a\nstraight way of looking. His chin is a good shape,\nfirm, a tiny bit square, the jaw not heavy, but the\nchin square. The mouth is medium, the lips a\nHttle curved, his nose showing the bridge a httle bit,\nrather straight, not quite aquiline, a little bit broad\nfrom the tip of the nostrils. The eyes grey-blue ;\nthe eye-brows not much arched, brown, nicely marked,\na good forehead, square, the hair short, sticks up a\nlittle on top. He brushes it away from his forehead.\nHe brushes it sideways and back, not parted in the\nmiddle. He passed over suddenly. He's tried to\ncommunicate before. He's not building up in\nuniform, in a suit rather hke this [indicates the\nmedium's grey tweed coat and skirt]. It's one he\nused to wear in earth life, not quite at the end.\n^ Almost the whole of the record is quoted. A few words have been\nomitted here and there which have no bearing upon questions of\nevidence.\n\f134 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nHe's tried to communicate before.^ There's a lady\non the earth plane he wants to meet as well as you.^\nThere's an older lady with him in the spirit world,\nmedium build, got thin a little before she passed\nover, neatly dressed, tidy ; the face rather round\nhere [indicates the cheeks], sloping to the chin, the\nnose rather straight, the mouth gone a little thin.\nShe'd been ill for some time before she passed over.\nHer face was sunken towards the end of her earth\nlife. The chin not large, very nice shaped. Can't\nsee the eyes distinctly, the eyebrows a brownish\ncolour, not black, rather a dark brown, a little\narched ; a nice skin, but she shows herself a bit\npale. The hair is done a bit plainly, smooth to the\nside of the head, not over the ears, done towards the\ncrown of the head. Not sure if it's parted, but it\ngoes off the face, smooth back. It's going grey, but\nit had been on the dark side. Judging from her\nskin Feda thinks she'd been on the dark side. A\nvery nice smooth soft skin she'd had. She hadn't\nbeen well for some time before she passed over. She\nhad some internal weakness. She had it for some\ntime, but it hadn't got so serious till a few months\nbefore she passed over. She builds a letter like that\nnear her [Feda draws an A in the air]. She'd lived\na good deal in the country, a country house and a\ncountry town more than London.^\n' Comment by the sitter. I cannot identify him. I thought at\nfirst it was my son. Captain S. Jacks, at the front, as the de-\nscription tallies at several points. I was afraid he might have been\nkilled.

The description of the older lady fits\nmy own mother fairly well. Her name began with A. She died\n20 years previously.\nIt is worth observing that on my showing this part of the report\nto various members of my family some months after the sitting,\nthey all identified the \" spirits \" differently. My own jdentification\nof the first \"spirit\" as my son was immediately challenged in\n\fLXXXli.] Apparent Communication from Person still alive. 135\nThe young man she's interested in passed over\nsince her.

Feda see it better in a minute. {S.v. Can't quite get\nthat letter, the letter that comes after.)

He thinks you can find\nout, and a place called M close to.\nFeda get a feeUng in the head before he passed\nover. Feda get a sudden tight sort of bursting\nfeeling in the head. He felt that, not a pain, but\nmost uncomfortable. And round his chest a tight\nfeeling, as if he couldn't breathe. It didn't last\nlong. It didn't hurt. Having that feeUng in the\nhead prevented him from feeling any pain. He\nsuddenly lost consciousness and he didn't know any\nmore.\nSomething has happened since he passed over\nwhich makes him feel he may have moved after, but\nhe didn't know he did. He speaks of feeling dizzy\nbefore he passed over, and he heard a noise very\nclose, several noises. He'd been with other people a\nlittle time before, but he felt suddenly alone ,^ or\naway from the others.^\nL. P. J. Does he know how long it is since he passed over ?\nfavour of another young man whom the description fits about\nequally well. This shows how uncertain such identifications are.\n^ Comment by the sitter. B might mean Birmingham, where I\nonce lived.\n^ This description of physical symptoms at the time of death is, of\ncoxirse, wholly inapplicable to Captain Jacks, to whom Dr. Jacks thought\nat the time of the sitting reference might be intended.

But in the\nsecond part the medium seems to have tapped my mind\nabout Royce\u2014especially the article\u2014and that inclines me\nto think that she was also telepathically tapping me in\nthe first part, my mind being much preoccupied at the\ntime with anxieties about my sons and losses of young\nfriends in the war.\nThe total impression left on my mind is similar to that\nleft by many common dreams. There is the same muddle\nand incoherency at first, in which definite personalities\nseem to appear for a moment and then change into some-\nbody else, the facts getting hopelessly mixed up, the action\nof one person shading off into that of another. And then\ntowards the end the dream becomes more coherent and\ninteresting, keeping up a definite character for a time,\nwith a sudden return to nonsense (the Archdeacon, etc.)\nand a momentary reappearance of the people first on the\nscene.\n1 Comment by the sitter.

Physikalische Phaenomene des Mediumismus, Studien zur\nErforschung der TeleJcinetischen Vorgdnge. By Dr. A. v.\nScHRENCK NoTziNG. Pp. X, 201 ; 15 Plates. (Munich :\nE. Reinhardt. 1920.)\nDr. von Schrenck Notzing's remarkable work is composed of\nstudies of telekinetic movements of objects which have been\nrecorded as occurring in the mediumship of Stanislava Tomczyk,\nby Prof. Ochorowicz and himself ; of Eusapia Paladino, by\nmany investigators including himself ; and of several private,\ni.e. unprofessional, mediums recently observed in Germany by\nhimself, together with an extensive account of Dr. Crawford's\nfirst two books on the Goligher Case, and a discussion of the\nlecture on \" Supranormal Physiology and the Phenomena of\nIdeoplasty \" given by Dr. Gustave Geley to the Institut Psycho-\nlogique in the College de France in January, 1918. To explain\nthese cases, the theory advocated is that telekinetic effects are\nless developed stages of the teleplastic phenomena exhibited by\n* Eva C.,' and so fully described in Dr. v. Schrenck Notzing's\nbig book on The Phenomena of Materialisation, and like them\nare ultimately inherent in, and relative to, the medium's\nmentality. Dr. v. Schrenck Notzing supposes that the move-\nment is ardently desired and its achievement is dreamt, where-\nupon the medium's creative imagination evolves '\npseudopodia,'\nor '\nefflorescences,' out of the body, which proceed to produce\nmechanically the effects observed. Such emanations were, he\nshows, frequently described by sitters with Eusapia Paladino,\nthey are represented in the Tomczyk Case by the very fine\n.' threads,' connecting the medium's hands, shown on some of\nthe photographs, they are indicated also in the Goligher Case,\nthough Dr. v. . Schrenck Notzing had not then heard of Craw-\n\fLxxxn.] Reviews. 145\nford's photographs of '\npsychic cantilevers,' which look so\nsingularly like the 'plasma' produced by 'Eva C On the\nother hand, he differs from Crawford in wholly rejecting the\nagency of '\nspirits,' and wUl not admit that the beUefs of the\nmediums and sitters are well-founded.\nOf course at present any theory other than fraud about\nthese staggering phenomena must appear anomalous. And if\nthere was fraud, it must have been facilitated by incredible\ncarelessness on the part of the observers, and all their very\nprecise statements about the conditions of experiment, and\ntheir examination of the mediums before and after their\nperformances, must be wholly unworthy of credence. Dr. v.\nSchrenck Notzing, moreover, does not rely solely on his pre-\ncautions as regards the '\nthreads '\nseen in the Tomczyk photo-\ngraphs ; he also provides plates to show how different they\nlook, when magnified, from any natural fibre. If fraud can\ndefinitely be excluded, and at present one who has not himself\nseen the phenomena will hardly feel that they have been\nrepeated and varied sufficiently to justify this confidence, the\nfield is open for a variety of explanations, and in the actual\nstate of our knowledge the choice among them is largely a\nmatter of taste. It may be that '\nspirits '\nin themselves\nexplain nothing. Again, it may be argued that if there is a\n'\nsoul,' as a substantive entity, at all, it must have the plastic\npower of building up its body according to its idea of its\nform ; this art it cannot be supposed to have wholly lost, and\nconceivably the abnormal improvisation of temporary limbs,\nwhere its normal equipment does not suffice, may be a mani-\nfestation of it. '\nMaterialisation '\nwould thus become a quasi-\nnatural process : but, if so, it must conform to mechanical\nlaws\u2014as Dr. Cra-n'ford has argvied, and more or less shown\n\u2014\nand the difficulties of conceiving the functioning of a material-\nised limb are peculiarly great precisely on the mechanical side.\nIt is no less perplexing to read (p. 3) that \" the lively wish of\nlifting an object from a distance leads to the associated idea\nof a thread, with which the experimentjf might be performed :\nthereupon the objective phantom of a thread is brought into\nbeing by a hallucination that realizes itself in matter.\" Thus\nwe are literally required to believe that '\nwishes are horses\n'\nand mediums can ride them ; but what, pray, is an '\nobjective\nK\n\f146 F.

These queer creatures\nseem to have one foot in the world of . reality and the other in\na dream, and suggest a confusionj\/^of thought and reaUty\nworthy of the maddest idealism.

Pp. xvi, 362.\n(Stuttgart : Ferdinand Enke. 1920.)\nProf. Dessoir is one of the few psychologists who [ has had\nthe courage to face the problems of psychical research and to\nenvisage seriously the possibilities of the supernormal. Indeed\nhe appears to have done not a little actual investigation, e.g.\nwith Slade, Eusapia Paladino, and Anna Rothe, and his\nsceptical conclusions are by no means merely the expression of\na theoretic bias. His general attitude is that of a very\ncritical psychical researcher, like that of the late Frank Pod-\nmore, and even this demands a deal of courage in Germany,\nwhere authoritarianism and a priori dogmatism have always\nbeen at home, and the mental atmosphere seems still to be\nvery similar to that prevailing in England forty years ago. It\nis not surprising therefore that he should always carefully\ndisclaim any personal sympathy with '\nsuperstitions,' should\napologize for condescending to dabble in such rubbish, and\nshould castigate the misguided followers of dissenters from\nscientific orthodoxy who have made a certain impression even\non the German mind. For it is clear that in Germany also\nthere has been a pretty extensive recrudescence of superstitions,\nwhich appears to have been exploited in the interest of his\n'\ntheosophy ' or '\nanthroposophy' by Dr. Rudolf Steiner, who\ngets properly snubbed by Prot. Dessoir. On the other hand,\nhe is uniformly appreciative, and very respectful, towards the\nwork of the S.P.R., to which he] refers extensively, and admits\nthat the Piper Case, particularly, contains a residuum, when\n\fLxxxn.] Reviews. 147\nall conceivable deductions have been made, of which there is\nnot, so far, any normal explanation.

J.\nCrawford, D.Sc. Pp. vi. 161. London : John Watkins. 1921.\nIn the volume before us the late Dr. W. J. Crawford continued\nthe summary of the results which he believed he had obtained\nthrough the instrumentality of the Gohgher Circle in Belfast.\nThe two previous volumes. The Reality of Psychic Phenome-na and\nExperiments in Psychical Science dealt in a very general and\nsketchy manner with a series of experiments in telekinetic phe-\nnomena which were conducted under the most favourable circum-\nstances. In the present volume these experiments are continued\nand the book is enriched by specimens of some of the flashlight\nphotographs which have been secured of the \" plasma \"\nwhich,\nit is alleged, extrudes from the body of the principal medium,\nMiss Kathleen Goligher. Now that Dr. Crawford is no longer\nhere to defend his thesis it may seem unfair to some to critidze\nhis work in any but a commendatory spirit, but, after all, the\nbooks are unique in their fine and deserve the careful con-\nsideration of all those interested in the physical phenomena of\nspirituaHsm. On re-reading the first two volumes and then\ncomparing them with the one before us the conclusion seems\ndifficuh to avoid that these are not records of experiments\nsystematically conducted, but merely summaries of results obtained\nthrough a system of procedure concerning the details of which the\nreader is left in ignorance. We do not believe that Dr. Crawford\nomitted to record the phenomena of each seance with its appro-\npriate detail and it is to be hoped that his full notes may be\npreserved for the benefit of those who are not content with bald\nstatements of occurrences which are said to have taken place.\nIt must be remembered that the experiments outlined in these\nvolumes were principally conducted by one man in a circle of\n\f148 E. J.D. [PAET\nsome seven persons and it is only to be expected that under\nthese conditions the method of research was not one which would\nappeal to many of the more critical students of psychical phe-\nnomena. The books are, in fact, as the author himself suggests\non p. 151 of the present volume, popular expositions and not\nscientific treatises in any proper sense of that term. If this\npreliminary supposition is granted (and it seems one difficult to\nevade) it may appear an impertinence to ofier criticism of a\ndestructive rather than a constructive nature, yet it is necessary\nto counteract the opinion widely held in spiritualistic circles that\nthe books are models of scientific accuracy and therefore pro-\nportionately valuable. On the other hand even popular hand-\nbooks ought to contain those details which are essential to an\nintelligent appreciation of the matter under review. In the\npresent case Dr. Crawford has so often omitted these bare facts\nthat at times we are tempted to throw the books down and\ngive up trying to obtain any rational idea of the phenomena of\nwhich they treat. A few examples of these and certain other\npoints calling for some comment may be found interesting.\nFirstly then, the question of fraud. We do not propose to\nsay anything on this subject ourselves but to confine our remarks\nto pointing out some of the extraordinary theories apparently\nheld by the late Dr. Crawford. Let us turn to the catalogue\nof points against fraud noted in R.P.P., p. 10 seq. The first\n\" fact\n\" which shows that the phenomena are genuine is that the\nfamily are convinced spiritualists. The second is that the seances\nare looked upon as religious institutions. The fifth is that the\nmedium is a private one, and there are others equally irrelevant.\nThe springs of human conduct are far too deep to be analyzed\nin this fashion and discoveries in modern abnormal psychology\nshow that problems of motive are some of the most baffling\nphenomena with which it has to deal. Again compare the \" test\n\"\ninstituted by Dr. Crawford in order to see if the medium could\nmove her feet when tied {Psychic Structures, p. 35). He \" allowed\nher to do her utmost with her feet, but she was incapable of\ndoing anything.\" ^\nThis is surely a remarkable \"test,\" almost as remarkable as\nthe naive assumption on p. 34 when dealing with precautionary\nmeasures that the \" medium and members of the circle were just\nas interested as I was . . . in order to render the results as\n1\nCf. also p. 64 of the saint) book.\n\fLXXXII.] Reviews. 149\ncertain as possible and beyond any reasonable suspicion of doubt.\"\nThese observations do not reflect in the least on the purity and\nintegrity of the Goligher Circle. We merely present them as\nspecimens of Dr. Crawford's attitude in the face of grave per-\nplexity and we can scarcely consider such methods as likely to\nprove convincing to those who have not the opportunity of\nobserving these phenomena at first hand, or becoming personally\nacquainted with the mediums. We pass on to the lighting\narrangements. From the volumes before us it is quite impossible\nto get any real notion of the amount of light that was used at\nthe seances. \" A subdued kind of light issuing from a large\nsurface of ordinary gas flame {R.P.P., 12) : a gas jet (76., 6) :\nstrong red illumination {P.S., 33) : a red electric light (lb., 89).\nWe want to know the size, illuminating surface and quality of\nthe gas jet as well as the voltage, etc., of the electric lamp.\nYet all these elementary details are omitted. One further ex-\nample will suffice ; it is the test box (excellent device) described\non p. 88 of Psychic Structures and illustrated in Fig. 46. We\nare told neither the length, breadth, height nor thickness of the\nwood. The variety of wood employed is not given, although\nthis is a mere detail, since we do not remember that the kind of\nwood of which the seance table is constructed has been yet\ngiven. In the case of the box the size of the holes is not given,\nnor the length of the screws which secure the top piece to the\nsides. In fact, it is merely stated that a test box was employed\njust as is usually done in a summary of results obtained. A\npoint that may be considered in this connexion is the statement\non p. 93 of Psychic Structures, that when the medium wore\nhigh boots and her feet were placed in the test box they were\nso tightly wedged as to be immovable. We can understand\nthat she would have been unable to move her legs, but what\nprevents her from raising the front portion of her feet from the\nfloor of the box we are unable to say. Perhaps her power of\nmoving her feet during the sittings is in abeyance just as Mr.\nMorrison's sensibility seems so acute that when he is touched on\nthe boot he is able to describe it as something as soft as the\nflesh of a baby (p. 65).\nWe do not wish to lay too great an emphasis on points of this\nkind, as such criticism may perhaps tend to distract attention\nfrom the value which these volumes undoubtedly possess. After\nall, even assuming that they are summaries and that some of the\n\f150 E. J. D. [part Lxxxn.]\nexperiments are incomplete, tiiey contribute the ' first reasoned\nattempt to account rationally for the physical phenomena of\nspiritualism and for telekinetic phenomena in particular. The\nexperiments with clay and methylene blue indicate the possibilities\nthat may be achieved in this line of research and might themselves\nbe considerably amplified. It is a peculiar circumstance that if the\nstructures succeed in carrying about ordinary matter like clay\nand various colouring agents it is not possible to employ some\nsubstance of a viscous nature which may spread evenly over the\nmaterialized end and so render it clearly visible moving about.\nThe use of luminous cardboard also is useful in all these experi-\nments and it seems a pity that Dr. Crawford did not make more\nuse of it.\nNot the least interesting part of the volume before us is the\ncollection of photographs which have been admirably reproduced.\nJust before Dr. Crawford's death we had the opportunity of\ninspecting the much larger collection containing those specimens\nwhich Dr. Crawford thought unsuitable for publication. We\nregret their omission, as they constitute, in our opinion, one of\nthe most important links in a chain of experiments of which\nvery little is known outside well-informed circles.^ Indeed we\nmay say that the existence of these photographs and their ac-\ncumulation in the case of this and other mediums may be the\nultimate means of understanding the mechanics of these pheno-\nmena. The author of these books having passed away, it\nremains for others to carry on his work and to revise and com-\nplete his experiments. The works he has left can scarcely fail\nto be regarded in the future as the most important contributions\ntowards the study of telekinesis which have appeared up to the\ntime that their author met his untimely end.\nE.

This theory is nearly\ndead in our days, still a few investigators of more modern\ndate have accepted it in one form or other.\nAnother view was held by Braid, the father of modern\nhypnotism. He maintained\u2014at least during his first\nperiod\u2014that by visual and mental concentration the\nsubject can be put into a new state, the hypnotic, charac-\nterized by certain symptoms, which in their turn are\ncapable of being modified by physical means, e.g. by cold.\nConsequently, Braid did not believe in any fluid, nor in\nthe power of the hypnotizer's will alone to influence the\nsubject. And only later on did he attribute any im-\nportance to the imagination of the subject, or to what\nwe now would call the factor of suggestion.\nCharcot and his school ought to be classified under\nthis head, because they considered that difi^erent kinds\nof sense-stimulus, e.g. light and sound, could as such\nCertain omi.ssions and additions have been made in the paper as\nnow published. S. A.\n\f152 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [part\nproduce hjrpnosis, and because they believed that certain\nsemi-hypnotic phenomena could be obtained by magnets,\nmetals, etc. They also proclaimed the existence of definite:\nforms of hypnosis at least in regard to hysterical patients\nj\nand of hemi-lateral or half-sided hypnosis, even of hetero-i\nlateral hypnosis, or of such a state where one half of the\nbody is in one hypnotic state, the other half in another\none.\nIn our days the suggestive school reigns nearly supreme,\n|\nthat is to say, suggestion, direct or indirect, is held to'\nbe the cause and the sole necessary one not only of'\nhypnotization itself, but also of all the phenomena which;\ncan be produced during hypnosis.\n^\nThe first problem which I have tried to solve is whether\nany \" fluid \" or, to put it more broadly, whether any\nnervous effluence of some kind exists. Are all nervous\nsystems really so well isolated that a specific influence\nat a distance from one to the other cannot take place\neven under favourable conditions ?\nWe know that in hypnotizing use is sometimes made,\nespecially by the mesmerists, of passes, that is to say, the\nhypnotizer makes strokes over the skin, clothes, etc., of\nhis subject, but without touching him. The question then\nis : Can the fingers or the hands of a person\u2014whether\nmoving or kept still\u2014without any contact and after all\nknown factors of importance, such as the usual stimulation\nof the senses, expectation, suggestion, telepathy, simu-\nlation, etc., have been eliminated or at least made im-\nmaterial, and after the subject has been put in hypnosis,\nbring about certain changes in his organism, for instance\nin the skin (the dermal sensibility) or in the muscles\n(the neuro-muscular apparatus) ? It is of course better\nto begin our investigations with certain hypnotic experi-\nments such as these than to try to establish the effects i\n1 Some of Bramwell's cases, treated by hypnotic \" meaas, where no\nsjTnptoms of induced hjrpnosis were obtained and where the evidence\nas to the very remarkable therapeutic results being due to \" suggestion\n\"\nalone was by no means convincing, are from this point of view inter-\nesting (Bramwell, Hypnotism, 1906, p. 421 S.) : They seem to prove\nsome efficacy of the methods used, independent of suggestion.\n\fLxxxm.] Problems of Hypnotism. 153\nof passes on the act of hypnotizing itself, as it is in\nthis latter case much more difficult to avoid suggestions\nof various kinds.\nSensibility ; the Senses.\nIn order to eliminate the above-mentioned sources of\nerror I fix a sheet of glass by means of a stand and\n, clip above one or both of the subject's arms, and also cover\nI\nhis head completely with a black cloth. Such an arrange-\ni ment naturally excludes the possibility of thermal or\nI\nmechanical stimulation of the skin from the passes {e.g.\nby currents of air), and thus the subject cannot get any\ndermal sensations which he might use as a starting-point\nfor auto-suggestions. Of course no word is spoken.\nLet us now suppose that I make, say with my left\nhand, downward passes above the sheet of glass placed\nabove the right arm and hand of the subject, whom we\nsuppose to be in light hypnosis and therefore over -sensi-\ntive,^ and that I do not do anything at all with my\nright hand. Then, if I make say 10 to 16 passes during\nabout I minute, complete insensibility of the skin\n\u2014\nanalgesia and anaesthesia\u2014is obtained, but only beneath\nthe sheet of glass. The other parts of the body do\nnot change their over-sensitiveness, with the exception of\nthe opposite symmetrical part of the body ; in this case\nthe other left arm and hand, which become still more\nover-sensitive than before : they get what I call an\n\" extra \"-oversensitiveness (for shortness' sake called in\nthe following only : extra-sensitiveness). That is to say,\nyou can prick the right arm as much and as hard as\nyou like even with a needle, and place hot or cold metal\non it without getting any reaction, but the moment you\ntouch the skin on the left arm ever so lightly with the\npoint of a needle or with my \" algesimeter \" even at its\nlowest pressure (2 grammes) the subject reacts violently\n^ In light hypnosis three of my principal subjects show spontaneously\na hyperaesthesia, an over-sensitiveness not only in regard to the skin but\nalso in regard to the other sense-organs, and the neuro-muscular irrita-\nbility is also increased.\n\f154 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [PART\n(a dermal-muscular reflex action), and says he felt a\nsharp prick. The same extreme sensitiveness exists also\nin regard to thermal stimulation, so weak that it other-\nwise would not affect him. In point of fact, the threshold- \\\nvalues for the different skin-senses get more and more \\\nincreased on the surface above which the \u2022\ndownward\npasses are made and more and more lessened on the ;\nopposite one. (As to exact figures, see below.)\nIf I now make upward passes above the subject's\ninsensible right arm, sensibility is restored gradually till\nthe over-sensitiveness which characterises the light hyp-\nnosis comes in. If I continue the passes still further\nI obtain an ever- increasing extra-sensitiveness. That is\nto say : whilst downward passes lower the sensibility,\nupward ones heighten it.\nWhen trying to ascertain the properties of different\nsubstances in regard to their power to transmit the\neffects of the passes, I found the important fact that all\nsubstances do not behave in the same way in this respect.\nGlass and metal have been found to be transparent,\nwhilst cardboard, paper, flannel, wool, etc., are more or\nless opaque to this influence.\nThis makes the following experiment possible. Before\nthe glass-sheet in the stand and clip is placed above the\nbared skin of the subject, it is partially covered, for\ninstance, with a flannel cloth. If I now make downward\npasses above it, I find only the skin beneath the uncovered\npart of the sheet of glass insensible, the other parts\nretaining their sensibility. This combined method can of\ncourse be varied in many ways.\nFig. 1 shows the arrangement I now generally use.\nThe arms of the subject are wholly enclosed in boxes\nwith panes of glass as lids and as frontpieces.\nIf, as in this case, the subject's right arm is covered\nwith glass and, flannel, the left arm only with glass and\nI make downward passes with both hands simultaneously\n\u2014as the figure shows\u2014then only the left side becomes\nanalgesic and anaesthetic, the right arm showing the\ncorresponding extra-sensitiveness. This simultaneous metJiod\ngives of course added safety\u2014the subject in such a case\n\fFig. 1 (see p. 154).\n\f\fLXXXIII.] Problems of Hypnotism. 155\nnot even being able to know or hear on which side to\nexpect the primary effect. (I can here add, that I have,\nof course, sometimes clogged the ears of the subject but\nnevertheless obtained the usual results.)\nIn Fig. 2 the subject is in deep hypnosis, that is to\nsay, he is in a condition induced by making a lot of\ndownward passes generally over the whole body of the\nsubject when he is in light hypnosis. He then becomes\ncompletely analgesic and anaesthetic over the whole body,\nthe irritability of the neuro-muscular apparatus being also\ndiminished\u2014as we shall see later on. The subject makes\nno movements and usually does not hear or answer even\nthe hypnotiser.\nNow in this condition downward passes have no appre-\nciable effect on the skin\u2014quite as we ought to expect.\nBut upward ones have ;\nthey restore the sensibility.\nIn this experiment I use the simultaneous and combined\nmethods in this way : on both sides is a sheet of glass,\nbut the one above the subject's right arm is covered\nbeforehand with a woollen cloth. If I now make simul-\ntaneously on both sides upward passes, the sensibility on\nthe subject's left side is restored\u2014more or less according\nto the number of passes made ; the right arm remains\ninsensitive.\nThe selective absorption occurring when the combined\nmethod is used is specially well shown by the following\nexperiment, which also excludes all possibility of the\nsubject's guessing the exact nature of the arrangement.\nThe system of screens consists of a large sheet of\ncardboard which covers the whole hand (35 by 25 cm.),\nwith a piece cut out 3 cm. broad and II cm. deep, and\na sheet of glass or metal. These two sheets are placed\none on top of the other, sometimes with the glass or\nmetal sheet on top, sometimes the cardboard one, but\npreferably the latter, and are fixed in a stand over one\nj\nhand of the subject so that the gap in the cardboard\nsheet lies above one of his outstretched and spread-out\n,\nfingers. Passes are then made \u2014descending ones in light\nI\nhypnosis, ascending ones in deep hypnosis \u2014over the\nwhole system.\n\f156 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [part\nAlready 10 experiments of this kind have been carried\nout extending over several years. My choice of finger\nhas been pure chance. The examination has been done\nwith 3 kinds of stimuli, beginning on one of the end\nfingers and running through all of them, backwards and\nforwards. That finger or those fingers which twitched\nwere considered sensitive, the others not. Result : In\nseven experiments the correct finger was effected ; in\ntwo the correct finger and an adjacent one ; in one an\nadjacent finger first and then the right one.\nAs the gap was a little broader than a finger and\nno guarantee existed that the subject held his fingers\nquite still, the incorrect results may be explained in this\nway.\nWe must now turn our attention to experiments made\nwith the non-informed method, that is, a method which\ndoes not allow even the experimenter to know the arrange-\nment made use of. They are important, firstly, because\nthey give increased safety in regard to the subject's\nignorance of the arrangement ;\nsecondly, because they\ne iminate the possibility of telepathy from the experi-\nmenter being the real and sole cause of the effects obtained\nin these kinds of experiments ;\nthirdly, because when the\nexperimenter does not know what results to expect, he\ncannot make the following examination of the skm in\na way favourable to the right result.\nLet me now give you a few examples of these non-\ninformed or non-knowing experiments. They can, of\ncourse, be made in several ways. The following group\nrefers to subject No. 1.\nSitting 20. 26\/12, 1910.

During\nthe test which followed I immediately found two more or less\nround places, one fairly near the coat-sleeve and one just\nabove the ^vrist. I was astonished to find two. Only then\nDr. von Bahr showed me the brass plate from underneath, and\nthere I saw two circles stuck fast. One coincided exactly\nwith the upper sensitive circle, but the other had been situated\nsome centimetres lower down on the arm (above the wrist).\nSitting 37.

He had not expected\nany certain result himself. The result he obtained was that\nthe topmost belt\u2014corresponding fairly accurately to the match-\nbox\u2014-was stiU sensitive, but the other part of the arm and\nhand was insensible to the algesimeter (and even, as it proved\nlater on, to metal objects) : the right arm was, on the con-\ntrary, extra-sensitive.

The lid\nwas not taken off until after the examination of the skin and\nthe paraffin was found to lie above the upper part of the\nforearm. None of us knew the position of the paraffin.\nIrradiation.\nWe may now go to the phenomena of what I will\nterm irradiation. If I make more passes than are needed\nto obtain a local effect, say an anaesthesia of the left\narm, then the insensitiveness spreads to the whole of\nthe left side of the body, the whole other half becoming\nextra-sensitive. And the middle sagittal line of the body\nbecomes strictly the borderline. Thus, if I make a super-\nfluous number of downward passes over the left arm and\nexamine the left side of the fore-hand with cottonwool,\nno tickling is felt and no reaction results. But as soon\nas I pass the middle line the reflex action ensues and\nstrong tickling is felt. This inhibition or decrease of\nfunction through or by irradiation on the same half of\nthe body is proportionate to the dynamogenic increase on\nthe other half. If instead of downward passes, upward\nones are made on one half of the body beyond what is\nrequired to obtain a local effect, and an increased hyper-\nsensitiveness of that half of the body is thus obtained,\nthen the other half gets its sensibility lowered in pro-\nportion.\n\f160 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [PART\nBut this heterolateral change of function exists not only\nin regard to the dermal sensibility, but in regard to all\nthe other senses and the neuro -muscular apparatus as well.\nLet us take smell, for instance.\nFig. 4 shows an experiment where the left side has\nbeen made insensitive, the right side extra-sensitive ;\nthe right nostril was then clogged, the left one left open.\nA piece of cottonwool drenched in turpentine is neither\nsmelt nor reacted upon when held to the left nostril.\nFig. 5. The left nostril is now clogged, the right open,\nthe right side being extra-sensitive. A strong effect is\nobtained in this case, even at a distance, as is seen in\nthe figure. I have been able to obtain these results\nwith a new subject at the very first sitting I had with\nhim, this experiment being also the first of all then made.\nExact determinations of the acuity of smell on the\nextra-sensitive side have been made by Dr. Backman and\nmyself with the help of the smelling box of Zwaardemaker,\nin which mixtures of smelling substances of different\nconcentration can be evaporated.\nThe mixtures were given to the subject in irregular order,\nand pure water was also given as a control-experiment ;\nno mistakes were made by him.\nWithout giving exact figures I can say that on the\nextra-sensitive side the gustatory acuity for vinegar was\ntwice as great as in the waking condition, for benzaldehyd\nfive times as great.\nAs to the pain-sense, a pressure of 0-8 grams made with\nthe needle of Thunberg's algesimeter gave no pricking sensa-\ntions in the waking condition, only (secondary) itching\nsensations, but on the extra-sensitive side a pressure of\nonly 0-1 gram gave pricking sensations.\nWhen examining the thermal senses in a certain degree\nof lowered sensitiveness I found that a sheet of silver\nof 4 square cm., \\ mm. thick and heated to a temperature\nof 64\u00b0 Cent., gave m this condition only paradox\nsensations of cold and jiressure sensations, thus showing\nthat the warm-sense falls away before the cold-sense.\nIn point of fact the skin-senses disappear in this sequence\npain-, warmth-, cold- and pressure-sense.\n\fFig. 5 (see p. 160).\n\f\fLXXXIII.] Problems of Hypnotism. 161\nThe threshold of pressure-discrimmation is also strongly-\naffected. In waking condition the distance between two\npoints placed on the skin must be 25-35 mm. in order to\nbe distinguished as two (forearm, volarside, for subject\nNo. 1). In light hypnosis this distance can be lessened\nto 2-4 mm.\nI must put other senses aside, and turn to sight. We\nfind on the extra-sensitive side a strong increase in the\nacuity of vision far above the normal, also an expansion of\nthe fields of vision and of colour, an increased sensitiveness\nvalue for light and colour, a lengthening of the spectrum,\nan alteration in the mutual positions and lengths of the\ncolours of the spectrum and an enhanced brightness of\nthese colours, which, when extreme, leads to the subject\nseeing the whole of the spectrum as a bright white.\nThese forms of visual hjrperaesthesia are proportionate to\nthe degree of hjrper-sensibility of the skin on the same\nside and are accompanied by a corresponding decrease of\nfunction (hypoaesthesia) in the skin and eye of the other\nside. Here we find more or less strongly diminution in\nthe acuity of vision, contraction of the fields of vision\nand colour, weakness or absence of the colour-sense,\netc.\nAfter this survey let me give a few figures. Sub-\nject 1, who is emmetropic, has in the waking condition an\nacmty of vision (V.) = 0-9 ; in light hypnosis on each eye\nseparately : V. =somewhat more than 1 ; with both eyes :\nV. > 1-2 ; in light hypnosis on the extra-sensitive side\n:\nV.= l-8 at the most, and when diagrams not seen before\nby him are used. On the other eye V. is then only =0-25.\nThis phenomenon is brought out very neatly if you make\npasses, upwards or downwards, above the same arm as\nthe eye used during his reading, his ability to read\nsmaller type increasing or decreasing respectively.\nAs to the fields of vision and of colour, I shaU only\ngive two pictures showing that their extension goes\nparallel to the sensibility of the skin.\nFig. 6. The innermost field A shows the extension\nof the field of vision when subject 3 was awake. She\non one occasion, being a hysterica gravis, was then,\n\f162 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [part\nalthough awake, analgesic and anaesthetic. The middle\nfield B shows how it gets larger when I restore the il\nsensibility half-way on the same side by upward passes,\n\"\nwhich were made above her arm and through a sheet of\nglass, so that she could neither see nor hear nor feel\ntkem. The outermost field C shows its extension when\nI restored the sensibility by the same means to the\ngreatest extent possible. These examinations were made\nwith the help of a perimeter and with a white mark of\n^\n1 square centimeter.\nFig. 7 shows the fields of colour. Here I used a red\nmark. A shows the extension when the subject is anaes-\nthetic and analgesic, B when the subject is restored as\nmuch as possible. All these five fields are quite correct\nin relation to each other physiologically. Now the\nexamination itself was made by an assistant physiologist '\nwho took down the values with both the marks and in\nthe difi^erent directions irregularly and who was unaware\nof their ideal concentricity until the experiment was i\nended and the fields drawn up. ]\nFigs. 8 and 9. In order to find the threshold of the\nsense of light I used Prof. Gullstrand's photoptometer. An\nelectric lamp inside the instrument sends out its light\nthrough a window in front consisting of 900 holes, of\nwhich as many as you like can be opened or shut at\nthe time. By this means a square piece of white paper\nis illuminated in the dark room. The same subject, 3, |\nwhen nearly insensitive, was found to be able just to\nsee the white square after 35 minutes of dark-adaptation,\nif about 50 holes were opened. When the sensibility was\nhalf-way restored she needed only 13 to 19, when restored\nas much as possible 7 to 9, and when the sensibility was\nlowered as much as possible with the help of downward\npasses, as usual through a sheet of glass, 150-180 holes\n|\nwere needed. Here also the examination was made by ;\nan assistant-physiologist, who in most cases did not know\nhow many holes he exposed each time. Of course the\nnumber of holes can be transformed into different values ^\nof illumination, but this is not necessary for our purpose.\nThe given number of holes represents quite correctly the\n\fFig. 8 (see p 162).\n\fFie;.

In light hypnosis he sees\nall the colours clearer and lighter. '\nWhen, however, I\nbegin to make upward passes above his bare arm\u2014as\nusual through a sheet of glass\u2014on the same side as the\nobserving eye, the alterations mentioned before take place\ngradually and in a manner exactly parallel to the degree of\nextra-dermal sensibility which I produce by my passes.\nThus the subject sees the spectrum further and further\nout, especially at the red end. Here he sees red-brown, and\nbro-svTi so far out as to 800 And when using a kind of\nspectroscope, the anomaloscope (Nagel), where the different\nlights are seen isolated, he sees as far as about 900 mm\neven without any special dark-adaptation. At the same\ntime the colours not only become brighter and brighter,\nthey also change quality or tone. Yellow gets first\nwhitish and at last quite white, whilst the colours on\nboth sides of it, orange and red on one side, yellow-\ngreen and green on the other, get more and more yellow.\nI cannot here relate all the phases of the process, but I\nmay say that, after yellow, red and green nearly simultane-\nously are transformed into white, blue retaining its\ncolour to the last.\nIf downward passes now are made everything goes back,\nxintil the visual state characteristic for the usual light\nhypnosis is reached and then the dermal sensibility is of\ncourse equal on both sides. If I continue the downward\npasses the spectrum gets darker and darker, shrinks\nmore and more and at last only grey in different grades\nof lightness is seen\u2014the brightest part being as before\nthe place where yellow was seen : A = 575-585 ,UM.\nCan we, however, be sure that all this is not the effect\nof suggestion, imagination or simulation 1 I can only\nassert that all the statements of these subjects show a\nperfect inner consistency ; that subject No. 1 shows the\n\f164 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [part\nsame principal phenomena, that is to say, in the hyper-\naesthetic state increased length and brightness of the ,\nspectrum and also the transformation of yellow into white ;\nthat the subject also makes right statements when\ncoloured glasses, e.g. Wratten light-filters of different power\nof absorption are placed in front of the instrument ;\nthat when a single light is shown him in the anomaloscope\nand upward or downward passes are made (see Fig. 10)\nhis statements of its changes up and down are just those\nwhich he ought to make judging by his description of a\ngeneral spectrum ; and that stereoscopic tests where I\ngive the hyperaesthetic eye one kind of colour and the\nhypoaesthetic another kind, also give results which per- ;\nfectly well agree with results otherwise obtained.\nBut do not irregular results sometimes ensue ? Certainly,,\nbut I think that by now, i.e. after 10 years of research-\nwork in this field, I pretty well know the reasons why ;\nthey occur, even if I cannot always prevent these irregu- j\nlarities. The causes of irregular results are (1) changes\nin the hypnotic sleep itself\u2014if during the experiment the\nlight hypnosis changes into deep, you get a spontaneous\nchange or mixture of sensibility, which spoils the results i\nof the passes ; (2) if the subject's peculiar sensitiveness j\ntowards this nervous radiation is less than usual, you do j\nnot get the usual resvilt without increasing the number\nof passes ; if, on the other hand, it is greater than usual\n\u2014\nand this happens especially when you have worked with\na subject a long time\u2014then you get through irradiation\nthe whole side changed, instead of only getting a local\nchange as you expected. When Sir William Barrett did\nme the pleasure of attending my experiments at Upsala\nhe himself made a number of different experiments,,\nsimple and combined, of which all but one turned out\nquite regular. In this single experiment, where the\nposition of the filtering paper beneath the metal screen\nwas unknown to us, the skin beneath the paper ought\nnot to have become insensitive. However, it was so. \\\nBut we omitted to examine the condition of the dermal\nsensibility on other parts of that half of the body, simply\nbecause at that time these irradiation-phenomena did wot\n\fFig. 10 (see p. 164).\n\f\fLXXXIII.] Problems of Hypnotism. 165\noccur so much or were not known by me. The experi-\nment may of course have been wrong, but it may also\nhave been right. Because the examination of the skin\nwas made in an unsatisfactory manner, this experiment\nmust be cancelled and cannot be counted as a failure.\n(3) The opaque substances do not seem to be quite opaque\nto this influence\u2014if you go on making passes you generally\nget an effect at last, possibly depending upon the screen\nitself getting charged with the effluence and so becoming\na secondary source of force. (4) You have to reckon with\nwhat Charcot called consecutive oscillations, that is to\nsay, a change in the dermal sensibility on one side has\na tendency to transfer itself after a while spontaneously\nnot only to the other side but also back again to the\nfirst one, and so on\u2014especially when a superfluous number\nof passes are made. I have by experiment found this\nto be true. But it is a very disturbing process to\nencounter. (5) The condition of the dermal sensibility\ndepends upon the functioning of the other senses\u2014which\nI found out rather late to my regret. E.g. stimulation\nthrough light, i.e. opening of the eyes, diminishes the\nover-sensitiveness of the skin in light hypnosis.\nThe important point is therefore : do you get so many\nright results, i.e. results which agree with the direction\nof the passes and the kind of arrangements used, that\nthis percentage cannot be accounted for by chance, auto-\nsuggestion or simulation ? I am sorry that space does\nnot permit me to give complete statistics. I can only\ngive you some extracts.\nOut of 21 experiments with combined methods made\nup to a certain date and where no experimental faults\nhad been committed, 17 gave quite regular results, 2 haK-\nregular and only 2 irregular. Of these 21 experiments\n10 were made with the non-informed method. I have\nalready given the statistics for the experiments made\nwith a system consisting of a sheet of glass and a piece\nof cardboard with a gap for one finger with subject No. 1.\nOnce I placed this system above the hand and fingers\nof subject No. 2 and in a series of 10 trials I only\n'pointed towards one of his fingers. Every trial resulted\n\f166 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [PAET\nin movements and certain sensations in only that special\nfinger. In these last experiments telepathy as well as the\ngaze can play a part, however. I shall treat of this\nlater on.\nIn a series which Prof. Ohrvall made with the subject\nNo. 2 and where downward and upward passes were made\nirregularly, the subject looking the whole time in the\nanomaloscope, every downward pass resulted in a darkening\nand a change of colour in a certain direction of the light\nobserved and vice versa for the upward passes. The\nsubject had a cloth over his head and the passes were\nmade above a sheet of glass as usual. The series com-\nprised 23 trials and no irregular result was obtained.\nAs to statistics of experiments made under conditions\nunknown to the experimenter, 78 per cent, of the experi-\nments made up to a certain date showed regular results.\nHere even telepathy must be considered ruled out of the\nquestion. And in all the eleven experiments that were\ncarried out to find out whether my thoughts or my wish\ncould prevent a certain effect of passes from taking place,\nthe passes prevailed over this possible telepathic effect.\nMotility.\nWe are also able to produce and show an effect of\npasses\u2014or of pointing with the finger of the operator\n\u2014\non the neuro-muscular system.\nLet me give a few examples of this. The subject's\nwhole arm and hand have sometimes been enclosed in a\ncylinder of glass, the whole arm and hand lying, e.g. with\ntheir dorsal side upwards, the hand clenched.\nFig. 11 shows an assistant young anatomist making an\nexperiment under these conditions. He points at the long\nextensor muscle of the thumb and the result is that only\nthis is extended. The reproduction given here seems\nto show that the forefinger was extended also, but this\nwas not the case : it is the cottonwool underneath which\ncauses this illusion. On the negative you can see quite\ndistinctly that the forefinger is not extended.\nFig. 12 shows the assistant pointing at the general\n\f\f\f\fFig. 14 (see p. 1 67).\n\fliXxxni.] Problems of Hypnotism. 167\nextensor of the fingers and you see how all of them this\ntime became extended and not the thumb. These 2\nexperiments are especially interesting, because the original\nposition was the same for both.\nFig. 13 shows how the effluence can effect sinews\u2014the\noperator pointed this time with a rod of glass through\na sheet of glass at the sinew of the forefinger of the\ncommon extensor. Of course, this reaction is also to be\nconsidered as a reflex -action. I wish to point out that\nby this method you can extend any fingers you hke,\nand in an irregular order.\nIf you touch the skin and in this way exert a pressure\non the muscles, sinews or nerves, you get a stronger and\nmore immediate effect.\nFig. 14 shows this on subject No. 3. This is the effect\nof pressure with my finger on the motor spot of the long\nflexor of the thumb.\nIf pressure is exerted on a motor nerve, e.g. on n.\nfacialis, you also get a quite right effect from a physio-\nlogical point of view. This stronger effect may, however,\nas I said before, depend on the mechanical pressure in\nitself. This kind of stimulus doubtless exists, because if\n\u2022a rod is made to exert a pressure on a muscle or motor\nspot you get a distinct effect, a contraction, even if\nnobody holds the rod. The same happens if pressure is\nmade on nerves and sinews. In all these cases, however,\nauto-suggestion cannot be excluded ; on the contrary it\nmay easily enter into play. But when right results are\n\u2022obtained, as here, on subjects who know nothing of\nanatomy and physiology, they cannot, at least not the\nfirst time, essentially be the product of suggestion.\nNow this increased mechanical sensitiveness in certain\nhystero-hypnotic conditions had already been detected by\nCharcot. He called it the neuro-muscular hyper-excit-\nability, and according to him it existed only in the\nlethargic state of hypnosis. If, e.g., miisculus quadratus\nlabii superioris on both sides was excited with a rod, a\ncontraction ensued which drew the whole upper lip and\nthe nostrils upwards. But if one eye, e.g. the left one,\nthen was opened, the lethargic state changed into the\nM\n\f168 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [part\ncataleptic one on the same side, the contraction ceased,\nbut solely on this side and the left upper lip and nostril\nretook their normal position.\nAs said above, this phenomenon follows anatomical\nlaws much too closely, even the first time the contractions\ntake place, to allow of an explanation by suggestion solely.\nThis is also the opinion of many investigators, including\nsome who cannot be considered as pupils of Charcot. '\nWhat they have not understood, however, is that nervous\neffluence can play a part in these contractions.\nReflexes.\nBut if these phenomena exist, we ought also to find\nincreased tendon reflexes. In fact, Charcot had already |\nfound this to be the case.\nI have examined the knee-jerk reflex with the help\nof Sommer's reflex-multiplicator, which is shown on\nFig. 15. A string is fastened to a band, which goes round\nthe ankle. The string goes over a wheel at the top of\na support and is fastened to a registering apparatus, by\nthe help of which you can get the jerk written on the\nrevolving cylinder, when the sinew of the knee is tapped\nby the help of a hammer, falling from a certain height.\nThe figure shows also a hood, which can be let down\nin front of the subject, thus making the covering of his |\nhead unnecessary.\nAs to curves, we must content ourselves with observing\nthe immense difference between the jerk when you register\nit on the insensitive side or on the hyper- or extra-\nsensitive side of a subject in light hypnosis. Fig. 16\nshows that when the tapping was made\non the hyper-sensitive side 4 trials gave : very great effect^\nwith one excep-\ntion ;\n,, insensitive 4 ,, ,, hardly any effect\n;\nhyper-sensitive ,, again 4 ,, great effect ;\nwhen deep hypnosis was induced : 7 trials gave no effect\nto speak of.\nI\n\f\f\fLXXXIII.] Problems of Hypnotism. 169\nThese curves were taken all on the same side and as fast as\nthe changing of the hypnotic condition permitted. The\ntime-marker indicates i of a second.\nThe type of jerk is also altered on the hyper-sensitive\nside in comparison to the waking state : the swinging\ntendency is increased.\nElectric Irritability\n.\nThis is however not all : the electric irritability is in-\ncreased in usual light hypnosis and on the extra-sensitive\nside, while it is lowered in deep hypnosis. The threshold\nof stimulation of the motor spots in regard to the galvanic\ncurrent is in other words altered in one direction or\nanother.\nI will give a few figures : the threshold for the motor\nspot of m. abducens pollices brevis was found on one\noccasion, when shutting the current and when the cathode\nwas used as stimulus-electrode, to be :\nin waking-condition : 1-8 milli-ampere (M. A.) ;\nin usual light hypnosis : 1-1\nand in deep \u201e 2-25 \u201e \u201e\nOn another occasion the same motor spot needed :\nin light hypnosis and on the hyper-sensitive side :\n0-25-0-30 M.A. ;\nin waking condition immediately afterwards :\n0-50-0-55 M.A.\nOver a nerve, N. medianus, the following values were\nobtained during a sitting :\nin deep hypnosis : 4-5-5-3 M.A. ;\nin light \u201e 0-6-0-7\nThese different values show that the changes in the\nnervous irritability in the different hypnotic states not\nonly stretch themselves to the spinal column (which the\nknee-jerk-reflex proves) but also to the peripheral motor\nnerves.\nMagnetic and Electric Fields of Force.\nWe have thus seen that when the subject is in a\nhypnotic state, where his neuro-muscular apparatus shows\n\f170 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [part\na heightened sensitiveness towards nervous effluence, his\nmotor irritabihty is increased as such. But how about\nthe dermal sensibihty ? Here the same thing exists.\nNot only is the subject hyper-sensitive to ordinary\ncutaneous stimuli on those surfaces which are specially\nsensitive to the nervous effluence, but he there also shows\na specific sensitivity to certain other forms of energy\nwhich do not usually produce any effect on the dermal\nsenses. The subject, in point of fact, experiences decided\nand specific sensations in magnetic and electric fields of\npower (electro-magnets and static electricity) even if he\nis kept non-informed and all possible sources of error\nare eliminated. We can, therefore, say very generally :\nthe subject's sensitiveness towards nervous effluence is\nonly one form or aspect of a very general hyper-sensitive-\nness existing in certain hystero -hypnotic states.\nThe Effect of the Eye or of the Gaze.\nAnother factor often used when hypnotizing is the eye,\nor the gaze, and, as we know, it has been contended that\nalso here we have some sort of specific effluence in play.\nIn point of fact, if really the radiation that is found to\nemanate from the experimenter's fingers is due especially\nto the large number of peripheral nerves ending here,\nthen, when discussing the question whether also other\nparts of the body than the fingers may represent sources\nof this new form of energy, suspicion must naturally\nin the first place fall on the eye, as the whole optic\nnerve terminates and is spread out at the bottom of the\neye. A priori it can hardly be said that the different\nmedia must render such an effluence outwards impossible,\nas we have found in our experiments that materials that\nare to a certain extent analogous to them, e.g. glass, do\nnot act as a preventive screen.\nThe experiments made prove that the gaze really has\nan efi^ect on the sensibility similar to that of passes, even\nwhen conditions are just as severe, for instance when a\nsystem of transparent and non-transparent materials is\nused. When the gaze is directed at muscles or sinews\n\u2014\n\fLxxxni.] Problems of Hypyiotism. 171\neven through a pane of glass\u2014the corresponding move-\nments take place.\nRespiration.\nWe may now ask how such a function as respiration\ni\nbehaves, especially in the heterolateral hypnosis, respiration\nI of both lungs being, as is known, a function which is\nunified in a high degree.\nIn subject No. 1 the respiratory frequency is in light\nhypnosis increased from about 14 up to 30-32 per minute ;\nin deep hypnosis it can go down to 8-10. In hetero-\nlateral hypnosis the frequency lies about 22-24. The\nrespiration in deep hypnosis approaches the type that is\n; obtained in animals through section of the 10th nerve,\nN. vagxis. This might be expected, because in deep hyp-\nnosis the usual stimulation of this and other centripetal\nnerves must be diminished by the general insensibility.\nI\nThe respiration in light hypnosis, on the other hand,\nresembles the type observed when iV. vagus is stimulated\n\u2014\nthis corresponds with the general hyperaesthesia in light\nhypnosis. In the heterolateral condition you get a\nmixture or a medium between the types of light and\ni\ndeep hypnosis\u2014 in relation to frequency as well as to\nj\ntype. This is of special interest, as the heterolateral\nj\nhypnosis with insensitiveness on one half of the body and\nI hyper-sensitiveness on the other really represents a state\nwhere deep hypnosis reigns on one half of the body and\nlight hj^pnosis in an extreme degree, at least as far as\nthe sensibility of the senses and the neuro-muscular system\nis concerned, on the other half.\nThe Effects of the Thoughts of the Operator and of the\nSubject.\nMy experiments seem to prove that the non-expressed\nthoughts of the operator can bring about alterations of the\nsensibility, although the effect tends to become generalized,\ni.e. the sensibility not only of the surface thought of,\nbut also of the whole of the same side, is altered in the\nsame direction.\n\f172 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [pabt i\nOn the other hand, the power of the hypnotizer to\nwake the subject from the hypnotic condition only by j\nthought and will has been proved beyond doubt. With I\nmy three chief subjects I practically never fail in this t\nrespect. A black cloth having or not having been thrown j ]\nover the subject's head, he begins, after a certain time, ']\nvarying from 15 seconds to 2 minutes, to make move-\nments, stretch hinself, etc. He then throws away the 1\ncloth and opens his eyes, generally now nearly fully awake. (\nThe sittings generally last 2 hours and I make the experi-\nment when I like during this period of time. During 1\nmy \" willing \" I have walked about or sat still, whilst :\nother persons present have either talked or kept quiet. ,\n]\nGenerally I have kept my mouth closed (with the help \\\nof one of my hands) in order to avoid unintentional i\nwhispering. At least 50 such experiments have been made i\nby me and all but one have been successful. This shows\nclearly the legitimacy of considering telepathy as a possible ;\nsource of error in all experiments on nervous effluence, |\n:\nat least during hypnosis. I\n'\nIn all the experiments made to find out whether my '\nthought or my wish could prevent a certain effect of\npasses to take place, when willing or wishing in an\nopposite direction to that which it was expected the\npasses would act in, or when willing or wishing that no\nsuch effect would occur, the passes prevailed over this\npossible telepathic factor. When subject No. 1 is in light\nhypnosis I can, of course, alter his sensibility by the help\nof verbal suggestion. On the other hand, this subject can\neven in hypnosis only with difficulty and only to a\ncertain degree lower his sensibility by auto-suggestion alone.\nI have purposely made only a very few experiments of\nthis kind so as not to awaken in him any unpleasant\ntendencies in this respect. The important point,\nhowever, seems to me to be that experiments, made\nintentionally for the solving of this problem, have shown\nthat the subject is unable to resist the effect of the\npasses, even when he tries his utmost to do so, although\nthe effect is delayed or weakened to some extent. Eleven\nexperiments were made, and in all the result was the same.\n\fx,xxxni.] Problems of Hypnotism. 173\nConclusions and Theories.\nComing now to the conclusions I have reached, I shall\ntry to put forward my views in as condensed a form as\npossible.\nMy conclusions are :\n1. There exists a nervous effluence from the human\nhody. Other human beings of a certain type and in a\ncertain condition can be affected by it.\n2. Certain substances are almost wholly transparent to\nthis effluence, other substances absorb it more or less.\nIt can further be reflected, e.g. against a sheet of glass or\nmetal, and it can also be conducted through a rod, bent\nat right angles or twisted in some way or other. These\nresults agree with the experiments on the conductibility\nof this nervous force made by Boirac.\n3. Certain properties shown by this effluence make it\nimpossible to consider it solely as a form of some energetic\nradiation, i.e. as vibrations in a medium of some kind.\nThis is shown conclusively by Boirac's experiments, but\nalso by the following experiment made by me on a\nhysterical lady : when I or somebody else applies my or\nhis finger to her skin on a certain muscle, this muscle\nis contracted. When the lady is put into hypnosis by\nme, nobody but myself can provoke contractures in this\nway. Also if I press a metal rod to her skin, the under-\nlying muscles are contracted. But if somebody else does\nthe same thing with the same rod, nothing results\n\u2014\nunless I touch this third person with my hand. The\nsubject's eyes are of course bandaged, covered, or kept\nclosed by somebody, and it is clear that these experiments\ncan be made in such a manner that the subject by the\nhelp of her senses can get no sufficient aid to enable her\nto guess when or by whom she is touched. I once let\na physician present hypnotize the lady and then \/ could\nget no results unless I was put in actual touch with the\nhypnotizer. I have later found that Ochorowicz has made\nthe same experiment with the same results on a subject\nof his. These and other experiments, belonging to what\nwe may call the class of \" isolated rapport,\" show that\n\f174 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [PAET\nthere can be or must be at least an element of a corpus-\ncular character in this effluence.\n4. Barety's main results in regard to his principal\nsubject were, that passes made in the same direction as\nthe distribution of the nerves, i.e. in a centrifugal direction\nfor the extremities, anaesthetize the skin, contract the\nunderlying muscles, and put the subject to sleep\u2014whereas\npasses made in the opposite direction produce the opposite\neffect. These conclusions perfectly conform with my own.\n5. In explaining these different hystero -hypnotic states, we\nmay first of all say, that the hyper-sensitiveness of all the\nsenses and the hyper-irritability of the neuro-muscular\napparatus which exists in light hypnosis are secondary\ndynamic products, depending on a diminution of the\nhigher mental functions brought about by the hypnotiza-\ntion. The usual inhibitive action of the higher centres\non the lower ones is lessened and the latter thereby get\ntheir irritability increased. Turning to the process of\nirradiation, we can say that when we, e.g. make a super-\nfluous number of downward passes above an arm and\ngradually produce insensitiveness on the whole of that\nside, we are really putting that side in another hypnotic\nstate, deep hypnosis, because the state of that insensitive\nside is quite the same as the state of deep hypnosis,\nat least as far as the two can be compared. What kind\nof state the other side, the extra-sensitive side is in, is\nmore difficult to decide. It may be some kind of\nwaking state. Deep hypnosis itself is a state where the\nirritability of the whole cerebro-spinal nervous system\nseems to be lowered, but how this can be accomplished\nby purely radiative and dynamic means is a problem\nwhich calls for special experiments.\n6. In light hypnosis the conductibility of the nervous\nsystem is increased, at least in hysterical subjects ;\nor,\nfrom another point of view, the intimacy and inter-\naction between aU those parts of the nervous system\nwhich are not directly inhibited by the hypnotization is\nincreased. Let me give a further instance of this. If\nyou let subject No. 1 open his eyes during light hypnosis\nthe over-sensitiveness of the skin is diminished, the in-\n\fLXXXIII.] Problems of Hypnotism. 175\ncreased stimulation of the sense of sight evidently craving\nan increased amount of nervous energy, which conse-\nquently is taken away or drained off from other sense-\norgans. Hypnosis, especially in hysterical subjects, thus\nfacilitates in a high degree the experimental study of the\ninhibitive and dynamogenic processes in the nervovis\nsystem. We may further get to know by the help of\nthis method, as I have shown, that our organs of sense\nare capable of performing more and better work than\nthey generally do. And we may say that in ordinary\nlife every sense is subjected to a rather large amount of\nfunctional inhibition from the other senses and also from\nother parts of the nervous system.\n7. As to the process of hypnotization, I think we may\nsay that nervous effluence alone, whether from the hands\nor the eyes of the hypnotizer, can bring about hypnosis\nunder certain circumstances ; so also can telepathy alone ;\nso also can strong physical stimulation (bright lights, loud\nsounds) alone, at least in hysterical persons (fright- or\nshock-hypnosis). The contentions of Charcot and his\nschool, that such fright-hypnosis can be obtained without\nsuggestion, have by Schaffer been proved to be right.\nBy suggestion alone we can, as is well known, hypnotize,\nbut it may be that a nervous effluence or a telepathic\nimpulse is a necessary completing factor the first time.\nI must here say a word about telepathic hypnotizing\nand dehypnotizing. As Boirac has already put forward,\nthe subject generally does not know ivhy he goes to sleep\nor awakes\u2014he gets no idea from the hypnotizer's mind ;\nhe only does awake. It is not telepathy in a true sense\nconsequently : onl}^ a telepathic impulse, if I may say\nso.\nIn general practice it is probable that nearly aU these\nfactors are active, as well as others which in an indirect\nmanner contribute to induce sleepiness or fatigue, e.g.\nvisual and mental concentration (Braid), repose, etc.\n8. As to other statements of Charcot, e.g. the existence\nof hemilateral and heterolateral hypnosis, the specific\nsensitiveness in regard to magnets and the existence\nindependent of suggestion of certain characteristic features\n\f176 Dr. Sydney Alrutz. [part\nof the different hypnotic states, whichever these may be,\nI am of the opinion, judging by my own experiments,\nthat he so far was right.\n9. As to the experiments on nervous effluence made by\nthis Society, I do not think it would be the right thing\nfor me to claim space for a description of them. You\nwill get much better information if you go to the Pro-\nceedings and the Journal of your Society. However, as\nyou well know, Gurney inclined towards an explanation\nalong the lines of a nervous effluence, Mrs. Sidgwick and\nMiss Johnson tried to explain them by telepathy. I\nshould here only wish to put forward : (1) that according\nto my opinion these experiments were not differentiated\nso far that definite conclusions as to the nature of the\nforces in play can be drawn with certainty ; (2) that the\nefiect of the human gaze as a special factor was not taken\ninto consideration ; (3) that it is not perhaps quite\nlegitimate to put the problem thus :\n\" radiation or tele-\npathy,\" because both may have come into play in these\n.experiments ; and (4) that what I have called the non-\ninformed method was not used sufficiently to decide the\nquestion. However, judging from the details of the\nexperimental results, I am tempted to suppose that a\nnervous effluence really existed in at least some of these\nexperiments. But how far this may have been the case\nI am not prepared to say.\nBecause experiments of this kind can be conducted\nwith the help of methods and apparatus common to modern\npsychology and physiology ; because they can be made\nby anyone, once the subject is put in a suitable hypnotic\nstate ; and because the nervous effluence does not demand\nfor its explanation so many suppositions foreign to the\nscientific mind as real telepathy does ;\njust because of all\nthis I dare to believe that hypnotic experiments such as\nI have now put before you will perhaps more easily than\nother branches of psychical research be able to command\nthe attention of science. And there are many reasons\nwhy the attitude of science in this respect ought to be\nchanged. It must be admitted that science, whether we\ntake psychology or physiology, is not at present capable\n\fliXXXIII.] Problems of Hypnotism. 177\nof advancing in any marked degree the problem of the\nconnexion between mind and body, taking this problem\nin a real and concrete sense.

S.P.R., Vol. V., p. 253).\nExperiments closely related to those given in my article\nare described by Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S., in his book on\nPsychical Research (Home University Library), p. 198-199,\nand were made by him and Gurney in the early years of\nthe S.P.R. Sir William states that \" any particular book,\nor coin, or other object over which the hypnotizer had made\na few passes or even pointed his fingers, could be detected\nby a sensitive subject who was subsequently brought by us\ninto the room, from which the hypnotizer had m the meantime\nbeen excluded and the positions of objects then changed by\nus.\" Similar experiments were already made by Mesmer (see\nOchorowicz's article Hypnotisme et Mesmerisme in the Diction-\nnaire de Physiologie, ed. by Ch. Richet), and I have myself\nmade a few experiments which seem to prove that those\nkinds of sheets or materials which prevent the action of the\nnervous effluence from passing, m some way absorb this\nemanation and even may become secondary sources of force,\nas in Barrett's and Gurney's experiments.\nIn this connection may be considered experiments which\napparently reveal an influence on photographic plates.

Heebert Thurston, S.J.\nIt has always, I take it, formed part of the programme\nof the Society to concern itself not only with invasions\nof the individual consciousness from outside, or in other\nwords with such problems as those of communication and\ntelepathy, but also with the internal workings of the\nhuman organism and especially with the range of the\ninfluence exercised by the mind iipon the body and its\nphysical processes. Among the most remarkable pheno-\nmena of the latter kind is that of stigmatization. Perhaps\nI should explain that I refer, of course, to religious\nstigmatization, and that throughout this paper in speaking\nof stigmata I mean those physical counterparts of the\nwound marks of Christ which are alleged to have\nmanifested themselves outwardly in the hands, feet and\nside of many mystics from the time of St. Francis of\nAssisi down to the present day. It is a little unfortunate\nthat the word \" stigmata \" is commonly used by patho-\nlogists to denote the characteristic symptoms of hysteria,\nbut my readers will understand that I am here employing\nthe term in its hagiological, not in its medical sense.\nFifty years ago, when the case of Louise Lateau, the\nBelgian stigmaUsee, first began to be widely discussed,\nthe late Sir Samuel Wilks, M.D. and F.Pv.S., dealing in\nthe Guy's Hospital Reports with an alleged case of\nhaematidrosis (sweat of blood), quoted a passage from\nthe Lancet to the following effect :\n\u2014\" Louise Lateau's\nmeditations on the crucifixion, actively excited by the\nFriday, at last culminated in the flow of blood corres-\nponding to that from the wounded side. Such\n179\n\f180 Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J. [part\naffection, brooded over, would naturally enough be\nfollowed by the appearance of the other stigmata.\"\nCommenting upon this, Sir Samuel goes on :\n\u2014\" This\nis certainly a most remarkable utterance to proceed ex\ncathedra from a medical journal, for if excessive anguish\ncan cause an exudation of blood through the skin, it is\nextending our views of the influence of the mind over\nthe body to a much wider range than is generally allowed,\nand to admit that such exudation might occur at those\nspots where the whole power of the will is concentrated\nis certainly propounding a very startling doctrine.\" ^\nNo doubt this doctrine will not now be accounted quite\nso startling as it appeared to Sir Samuel in 1872.^ With-\nout definitely accepting or rejecting the view thus enun-\nciated, it will be my object iii the present paper to\nbring this theory into relation with the observed facts\nin order that we may be in a better position to decide\nhow far it can be relied upon to explain them.\nOut of some sixty cases of complete or partial stigma-\ntization with the evidence for which I have endeavoured\nto acquaint myself, we may take for our first illustration\na quite modern example from the life of Gemma Galgani.\nShe was a young girl of the middle class born near Lucca\nin Tuscany in 1878, and she died there in 1903 aged\ntwenty-five. Her life was written by her Confessor,\nPadre Germane, Passionist. An English translation of it\nhas been published with a very laudatory introduction by\nCardinal Gasquet.^ There are many things in the book\nwhich will probably strike the normal English reader as\nincredible, unnatural, or extravagant, and I should like\nto add that in certain respects I do not in any way\n^ Guy's Hospital Reports (series iii. vol. 17), 1872, p. 219.\n^ The earliest to propound the view that the stigmata were the-\nphysical effect of mental concentration seems to have been P. Pompo-\nnazzi in the sixteenth century. It was revived by A. Maury in the\nRevue des deux Mondes for 1854. (See his work La Magie et V Astrologie,\n1861, p. 385.) Since then this explanation has been adopted by many\nothers, e.g. by Sir William Barrett in his book On the Threshold of a\nNew World of Thought, p. 79.\n' Father Germanus, The Life of Gemma Galgani, London, Sands & Co.\u201e\n1914.\n\fCtEmma Galgani.\nBorn 1878, died 1903.\nBeproduced by the kind permission of Messrs.

At the age of\nfifteen she fell ill of a \" dangerous complamt \"\u2014nature\nnot specified\n\u2014\" which kept her in bed for three months.\"\nAt nineteen she developed a curvature of the spine.\nMeningitis supervened, together with a total loss of\nhearing. \" Large abscesses formed in her head, one of\nwhich seemed to make its way down through her chest\nand settled in her side. Then her hair fell off, and\nfinally her limbs became paralysed.\" ^ After more than a\nyear of acute suffering, she got up on March 3rd, 1899\n\u2014suddenly, and, as it was believed, miraculously, cured.\nFour weeks later, on Maundy Thursday, March 30th,\nGemma had her first ecstasy. \" While spending part of\nthe night in prayer,\" to copy the account she afterwards\ngave in obedience to her director, \" all of a sudden I\nlost the use of my senses. I was able with difficulty\nto stand up and lock the room door. Where was I 1\nI found myself before Jesus Crucified. He was bleeding\nall over ... I prostrated myself with my forehead to\nthe ground and there remained for several hours. I\ncame to myself with the wounds of Jesus so deeply im-\npressed on my mind that they have never since left it.\"^\nA week or two later she had a second vision in\nwhich Christ showed her again His five open wounds,\nsaying to her :\n\" Look, my child, and learn how to love.\"\nFinally, on June 8th :\n\u2014\" Jesus appeared with all His\nwounds open ; but from those wounds there no longer\ncame forth blood, but flames of fire. In an instant\nthese flames came to touch my hands, my feet, and my\nheart. I felt as if I were dying ... all vanished, and\nI found myself kneeling, but I still felt great pain in\nmy hands, feet, and heart. I rose to go to bed and\nbecame aware that blood was flowing from those parts\nwhere I felt pain.\" ^\n' The Life of Gemma Qalgani, p. 39.\n\f4\n182 Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J. [part\nThis was the beginning of the phenomenon, and her\nbiographer goes on to describe how :\n\" From this day\nforward the phenomenon continued to repeat itself on the\nsame day every week, namely on Thursday evening about\n8 o'clock and continued until 3 o'clock on Friday after-\nn'oon. No preparation preceded it ; no sense of pain or\nimpression in those parts of the body affected by it ;\nnothing announced its approach except the recollection of\nspirit that preceded the ecstasy. Scarcely had this come\nas a forerunner than red marks showed themselves on\nthe backs and palms of both hands ; and under the\nepidermis a rent in the flesh was seen to open by degrees ;\nthis was oblong on the backs of the hands and irregularly\nround in the palms. After a little the membrane burst\nand on those innocent hands were seen marks of flesh\nwounds. The diameter of these in the palms was about\nhalf an inch, and on the backs of the hands the wound\nwas about five-eighths of an inch long by one-eighth\nwide.\n\" Sometimes the laceration appeared to be only on the\nsurface ; at other times it was scarcely perceptible with\nthe naked eye ; but as rule it was very deep and seemed\nto pass through the hand\u2014the openings on both sides\nreaching each other. I say '\nseemed to pass,' because\nthose cavities were full of blood, partly flowing and partly\ncongealed, and when the blood ceased to flow they closed\nimmediately, so that it was not easy to sound them\nwithout a probe. Now this instrument was never used ;\nboth because of the reverential delicacy inspired by the\nEcstatic in her mysterious state, and because the violence\nof the pain made her keep her hands convulsively closed,\nalso because the wounds in the palms of her hands\nwere covered by a swelling that at first looked like\nclotted blood, whereas it was found to be fleshy, hard,\nand like the head of a nail raised and detached, and\nabout an inch in diameter. In her feet, besides the\nwounds being large, and livid around the edges, their\nsize in an inverse sense differed from those of her\nhands ; that is, there was a larger diameter on the instep\nand a smaller one on the sole ;\nfurthermore, the wound\n\fliXxxiii.] The Phenomena of Stigmatization. 183\nin the instep of the right foot was as large as that in\nthe sole of the left. Thus it must certainly have been\n-with our Saviour, supposing that both His Sacred Feet\nwere fixed to the Cross with only one nail.\n\" I have said that the opening of these wounds was\n\u2022effected by degrees, that is, in five or six minutes, begin-\nning underneath the skin and ending with the bursting\nasunder. At times, however, this was not the case ;\ntheir opening was then instantaneous, and came from the\n-exterior like a violent transfixing. Then it was agonising\nto see the dear martyr, thus stricken all of a sudden and\ntrembling in every fibre of her body.\" ^\nThe wound in the side, which was never seen by the\ndirector himself, but by ladies whom he commissioned to\nexamine it, was crescent shaped. It was about two\ninches long and half an inch wide. It did not bleed on\nthe Fridays alone, but any great emotion was liable to\nstart the haemorrhage afresh. The quantity of blood lost\nwas considerable. \" Those who lived with and assisted\nJier,\" her biographer writes, \" were ready to declare on\noath that from her side alone came so much blood that,\nif not stopped, it flowed down to the ground.\" But\nperhaps the most remarkable circumstance in the pheno-\nmenon was the disappearance of the wounds. \" As soon\n.as the ecstasy of the Friday was over the flow of blood\nfrom all the five wounds ceased immediately, the raw\nflesh healed, the lacerated tissues healed too, and the\nfollowing day, or at latest on the Sunday, not a vestige\nremained of those deep cavities, neither at their centres,\nnor around their edges ; the skin having grown quite\nTiniformly with that of the uninjured parts. In colour,\nhowever, there remained whitish marks, showing that\nthere had been the wound of the day before\u2014which would\n\"be opened again as at first, in five days, and closed in\n\"the same way.\n\" At the time of Gemma's death, two years after the\nmarvel of the stigmata had ceased, the marks of the\nw^ounds still remained and were then easily observable on\nher body, particularly in her feet, which in her lifetime\n^Ibid. pp. 61-62.\n\f184 Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J. [part\ncould only with great difficulty be uncovered during her\necstasies.\" ^\nBesides the stigmata, strictly so-called, Gemma GalganL\nwas also liable under the influence of strong religious ,\nemotion, e.g. when by chance she heard some blasphemous,\nutterance in the street, to experience a sweat of blood I\nand to shed tears of blood. This sweat of blood, how-\never, did not occur in her ecstasies when the stigmata,\nwere bleeding. On the other hand, in March 1901, over\nand above the ordinary stigmata, she reproduced also in\nher body the terrible effects of the scourging. She had\nat this time been given a home with a family of position-\nin Lucca, that of the Chevalier Giannini, who wished to\nafford her protection from the curiosity of importunate\nvisitors. Gemma's parents being dead, Signora Cecilia\nGiannini became to her a sort of adopted mother. It is\nshe who gives the following account of Gemma's condition,\non March 21st, 1901, being the Friday before PassiorL j\nWeek, then kept as a Feast of the Precious Blood.\n\" Her state was something indescribable\u2014wounds every-\nwhere that must have been nearly half an inch deep.\nBut after two or three days they disappeared . . . This-\nis how they were disposed ; two on one arm from two\nto three inches long, and very deep ; two on one leg,\nround and about the size of a florin ; one near the middle\nof her breast in the direction of her throat ; two very\nlarge oblong ones above the knee \" and so on\u2014a long,\ncatalogue, and the writer added : \"If you wish to form\nsome idea of it, recall to mind the large crucifix that we\nhave in the house before which Gemma was in the habit\nof praying ; she was like that. The same livid marks,\nthe same torii, open gashes in the skin and flesh, in the same\nparts of the body, equally long and deep and equally horrify- '\ning to behold. Blood came from her wounds in great\nabundance ; when she was standing it flowed to the\nground, and when in bed it not only wetted the sheets but\nsaturated the whole mattress. I measured some streams\nor pools of this blood, and they were from twenty to-\ntwenty-five inches long and about two inches wide.\" ^\n1 Ihid. p. 65 \u2022 ^ Ihid. p. 69.\n\fLXXXUT.] The Phenomena of Stigmatization. 185\nIt will be readily seen why I emphasise the fact that\nthe wounds in Gemma's body corresponded in position\nand size with those of the great crucifix before which\nshe was in the habit of praying. This evidence is the\nmore valuable because it comes from a witness who was\npersuaded that the whole phenomenon was supernatural,\nand who never suspected that she was supplying materials\nfor quite another interpretation.\nBy way of comparison with this modern example some\ndetails may be given from the contemporary biography\nof the nun Lukardis of Oberweimar, who was born about\n1276 and died in 1309. The case is conspicuous for the\ntouching and poetical feeling displayed and for the Sister's\nintense desire to be marked by what the mystics of that\nage were wont to call the Minnezeichen (tokens of love).\nLukardis had already led a hfe of rigorous austerity, and\nsomewhere about the year 1298 she seems to have been\npossessed with this ardent longing for suffering. Hence,\nsays her biogxapher, she was heard in the end according\nto her desire :\n\" For she saw in the spirit that she ought to pass\nthrough a certain door in which she found Jesus Christ\nas it were recently fastened to the cross, scored with the\nweals of the scourges and most pitifully dripping with\nblood. As she looked intently upon Him the servant of\nGod fell at His feet swooning and almost lifeless. Then\nour Lord said to her :\n' Rise up, my child, and help\nMe '\n;\nby which she understood that she ought not to\nbe content with merely calling His sufferings to mind\nbut that she was meant to helj^ Him by voluntarily\nsharing in his Passion. At Christ's word, accordingly,\nrecovering at last something of her strength, she answered\ntremblingly : ' How can I help Thee, my Lord 1\n'\nAnd\nthereupon raising her eyes she saw His right arm loosened\nfrom the cross and hanging feebly down, by which it\nseemed to her that the pain of the suffering Christ was\ngreatly intensified. So the beloved handmaiden, drawing\nnear in tender compassion, strove to tie up the arm again\nto the cross with a thread of silk, but she could not\nsucceed. Accordingly she began to hft His arm with\n\f186 Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J. [PAET\nher hands and with deep groanings to hold it in its\nplace. Then our Lord said to her :\n'\nPlace thy hands\nagainst My hands, and thy feet against My feet, and thy\nbreast against My breast, and in such wise I shall be\nso much helped by thee that My pain will be less.'\nAnd when the servant of God had done this, she felt\ninteriorly the most bitter pain of the wounds both in\nher hands and in her feet and in her breast, although\nthe wounds were not yet manifest to the outward eye.\nIt was after this that she formed the habit of knocking\nher hands together with great force so that the noise\nwas heard far and wide as from the collision of two\nplanks.\"\nThis is all so curious that I feel I shall be excused\nfor quoting still farther. Nothing could more signi-\nficantly illustrate the intensity of the mental influences\nwhich were at work, and which were at the same time\nusing physical expedients to produce the desired result.\n\" Also with regard to the hammering in of the nails\nof Christ's cross, as she carried the memory of them\ninwardly in her heart, so she represented it outwardly in\naction. For again and again, with her middle finger,\nshe would strike violently the place of the wounds in\neach palm ; and then at once drawing back her hand a\ncouple of feet (ad distantiam unius cubiti) she delivered\nanother fierce blow in the same spot, the tip of her\nfinger seeming somehow to be pointed like a nail. Indeed\nthough it appeared a finger to sight and touch, neither\nflesh nor bone could be felt in it and those who had handled\nit declared that it had the hardness of a piece of metal.\nWhen she struck herself in that way there was a sound\n(tinniebat) like the ring of a hammer falling on the head\nof a nail or on an anvil. On one occasion a person in\nauthority, thinking this kind of blow was a sham or a\nmere trick, in order to find out the truth, put his hand\nin the way. But when she had struck but once he\nliastily drew back his hand, declaring that if he had\nwaited for a second blow he would have lost the use of\nit for ever. With the same finger, at the hour of sext\nand again at none, the servant of God used to strike\n\fLxxxni.] The Phenomena of Stigmatization. 187\nherself violently on the breast where the wound came.\nThe noise that she made was so great that it echoed\nthrough the whole convent, and so exactly did she keep\nto the hour of sext and none in this practice that the nuns\nfound the sound more trustworthy than the clock. . . .\n\" Furthermore, it should be noted that the servant of\nGod, before the stigmata appeared, endeavoured, out of\nher great longing, to open the places of the wounds in\nher feet by boring them, as it were, with her big toe\n{sua majori pedica quasi fodiendo).\"\nNo doubt all this sounds very extravagant, and we\nmay suspect the writer of a good deal of exaggeration,\nbut the account abounds with psychological touches which\nare borne out by what we know of other similar ecstatics.\nMoreover, it is plain that the last thing the biographer\ndreamed of was to cast any doubt upon the supernatural\ncharacter of her mystical experiences. He tells us quite\nplainly that these practices had been persisted in for\ntwo years before the stigmata showed themselves, but he,\nnevertheless, narrates how the. wounds eventually developed\nas the result of a nocturnal vision. A most beautiful\nand delicate youth, who was himself marked with the\nstigmata, appeared to her and pressed her right hand\nagainst his right hand, saying : \"I wish thee to suffer\nalong with me.\" To this she gave consent, and on the\ninstant in her own right hand a wound was formed.\nAbout ten days later the left hand was similarly marked,\nand in course of time the feet and the side. We are\nfurther told that Lukardis, \" fearful of vain glory and\nthe adulation of men,\" hid the wounds by wearing some-\nthing in the nature of gloves, but that afterwards she\nwas supernaturally admonished to allow the marks to be\nseen \" for the glory of God and the devotion of the\nfaithful.\" The wounds, as in the case of many other\nstigmatics, bled regularly on Fridays, but not seemingly\non other days. This would seem to be the earhest\nexample in which we have definite mention of periodic\nbleeding.1\n^ See the Life of Lukardis in the Analecta Bollandiana, vol. xviii.\npp. 314-317, and cf. pp. 322, 328, 353.\n\f188 Rev.

The\nfollowing brief extracts are taken from certain notes\nwhich have been regularly kept from week to week by\nthe girl's confessor.

Gemma\nGalgani, partly, I think, from an exaggerated sense of\nmodesty\u2014when quite a child she would not allow her\nown father to kiss her\u2014had a horror of being examined\nby doctors. She told her first confessor, Mgr. Volpi,\nthat if he sent a doctor to examine her, the doctor\nwould see nothing. The confessor persisted, and the\ndoctor came one Friday when Gemma was in ecstasy\nand the stigmata were already bleeding. \" The doctor took\na towel, dipped it in water, and wiped Gemma's hands\nand forehead. The blood immediately disappeared and\nthe skin showed no signs of cicatrix, scratch or puncture^\nas if there had never been any laceration.\" ^\nFor a while the gravest suspicion of fraud naturally\nrested on the whole of these manifestations ; but the\nstigmata still continued to appear and bleed on Fridays.\nIn fact, unless we are prepared to involve the biographer\nhimself, reputed a most saintly man, together with a\ngroup of ecclesiastics including two archbishops, as also\nthe highly respectable Giannini family, with a number of\nother persons, amongst whom Cardinal Gasquet, in a\nbonspiracy of imposture, I do not see how we can\nset aside the evidence. In the presence of such an\naccount as that given by the Archbishop of Camerino, it\nseems to me that there is no middle term between either\naccepting the story as substantially accurate or accusing\nthe writer of deliberate falsehood.\n^\nSo again in the case of Padre Pio of Foggia we have\nthe suspicious circumstance that Dr. A. Bignami, Professor\n^ Life of Gemma Galgani, p. 85.

The marks can ordinarily be seen\nonly by stealth or subterfuge. Professor Bignami, who writes\nas an agnostic, rejects the hypothesis of conscious fraud,\nbelieving it incompatible with the impression of sincerity\nwhich results from any personal intercourse with Padre\nPio. He describes the marks as due to neurotic necrosis\nof the skin, but is puzzled by their symmetrical arrange-\nment, thinking, however, that this may be due to a\nphenomenon of auto-suggestion. The stigmata were not\nbleeding on the day he paid his visit. The interest of\nPadre Pio's case lies in the fact that it seems to be the\nonly well attested example of complete stigmatization in\na male subject since the time of St. Francis. But it\nmust be admitted that even in this instance the lesions\nare apparently confined to the epidermis, and though\nclearly marked, are of a very slight character. Wlien\nDr. George Festa, a distinguished Catholic doctor of\nRome, saw him four months later (November, 1919) and\nsubjected him to a thorough medical examination, he\nfound that there was a considerable and continuous\ndischarge of sanguino -serous fluid from the wound in the\nbreast. Though the use of the iodine had been discon-\ntinued, the lesions were still there and even more clearly\nmarked than at the visit of Professor Bignami.\n^\n* I have also had accounts of the case from two eye-witnesses. One\nof these, Mgr. Kenealy, Archbishop of Simla, visited Foggia in the\nsvunmer of 1920.

Far\nmore remarkable examples have been recorded in past\nages. In the canonization of Santa Maria Francesca\ndelle Cinque Piaghe her confessor. Padre Nitti, deposed\non oath that he had seen her stigmata many times\n{moltissime volte) during Lent, and that the perforation\nof her hands was such that he had made his index finger\nand his thumb meet through the hole. Saint Veronica\nGiuliani was subjected to an official examination by her\nbishop, Mgr. Eustachi, and the functionaries of the\nInquisition. The phenomena which she exhibited in\nresponse to the tests imposed by Father Crivelli were of\na nature highly suggestive of hypnotic , influence. For\nexample, the stigmata seemed always to open and bleed\nat his command. Then, in the presence of himself and\nthe Bishop, the wounds closed and reunited while they\nivaited. \" The wound,\" says the biographer, following the\nsworn statements made in the process, \" was completely\nhealed and covered with natural skin like the rest ; the\nonly thing which was left to mark the spot being a very\nslight discolouration.\" ^\nbe examined, begged so piteously to be excused from any further\ninquisition, that the Archbishop felt he could not insist ; still his testi-\nmony as to the reality of the wound-marks in the hands, which are\nalways hidden from view by mittens, is positive. My other informant,\na lady, who was able to obtain a momentary view of the palms of\nthe hands during Padre Pio's Mass, paid her visit to Foggia during\nthe April of this year, 1921. I am further indebted to the kindness\nof the Archbishop of Simla for copies of the two medical reports referred\nto above. All the witnesses agree that the marks appeal V>oth in\nthe palm and back of the hands, that they are circular and a little\nmore than two centimetres in diameter\u2014\" about the size of half-a-\ncrown. \" They are reddish -brown in colour and sharply marked ofl\nfrom the surroimding skin which is perfectly normal and without any\nsign of inflammation.

Her hands, on the Thursday, were enveloped in\ngloves and sealed up in such a way that she could not\nchafe or puncture the surface. Nevertheless, when the\nseals, which remained intact, were broken on the Friday\nafternoon, and the gloves were removed, her hands were\nfound to have bled as usual.^\nThe same glove experiment was tried with Louise\nLateau, but Dr. Warlomont, being dissatisfied with the\ntest, as he thought that friction might still be employed\nthrough the glove, had an apparatus constructed in the\nnature of a glass cylinder. In this Louise's arm was\nsealed up, it being absolutely impossible for her in any\nway to get at the hand so imprisoned. There was no\nsign of bleeding when the hand was inserted on Thursday,\n21st January, 1875, but on the Friday when the apparatus\nwas examined in the presence of medical witnesses, some\nof them anti-clericals and up to that time quite sceptical,\nthe hand was found to have bled.^ The Belgian\nAcademy of Medicine in consequence passed a resolutiou\naffirming the reality of the phenomenon, though several\nof the members still rejected any supernatural interpretation.\nBut perhaps one of the most satisfactory cases I have\n<!ome across from an evidential point of view is that of\nBlessed Diomira Allegri, a young nun at Florence, twenty-\nsix years of age. In 1677 she had a very serious illness\nfrom which, in fact, she never properly recovered. She\nwas so ill that two nuns sat up with her after she had\nlain in a sort of swoon for twenty-four hours.

Between the fingers they\nsaw a trickle of blood, and the two watchers thought the\ngesture so extraordinary that one of them went to rouse\ntwo other nv^ns who slept close by. Meanwhile she\npulled up one leg, then the other, into the attitude of\nthe figure of Christ on the cross. Finally, seeming to\nbe suffering great anguish in the side, she brought back\none hand for a moment to lift the clothes off it, saying,\n\" non piu, non piu, Gesu mio.\" Then she lay still,,\nalmost like one dead, for three hours, but after that she\nseemed to revive, looked at her hands, saw them bleeding\nand hastily hid them under the clothes. The confessor\nwas fetched to bring her communion, and he ordered her\nunder obedience to allow one of the sisters to examine\nher, he himself having seen the blood and the swelling\nin her hands. There were marks on the hands, both\npalm and back, with a trickle of blood. The feet were\nnot bleeding, but there were round bhsters both on instep\nand sole, filled with blood. On the side also was a large\noval swelling, very inflamed.\nNow these witnesses, namely the two watchers, the\nothers who were summoned, the confessor and the doctor,\nwho was sent for later, all gave evidence on oath regard-\ning these facts in the process of canonization.

First the medical antecedents of the\nmystic are bad, whether apart from or in consequence of\nthe austerities she has practised. When there are not\nstrongly marked symptoms of hystero-epilepsy, there are\ngenerally those of tuberculosis or of a scrofulous diathesis.\nSecondly, there has usually been a vivid realization of\nand concentration upon the wounds of the Passion for\nsome time before any bleeding stigmata have shown\nthemselves. In quite the majority of cases intense pain\nhas been felt for months, sometimes for years, in the\nplaces where the wounds subsequently opened. Thirdly,\nthe character and position of the wounds is very various\n(for example, some have the wound in the breast on\nthe right side, some on the left ; in some cases the\norifice is straight, in some it is triangular, in some it\nis cruciform, in a few it is crescent shaped, in a few\nothers there is more than one wound), but so far as\nwe can trace the previous conceptions of the sxibject\n\u2014\nwhich, unfortunately, is rarely possible\u2014the development\nof the stigmata follows their previous conceptions.\nEqually striking as a concomitant of the development\nof the stigmata, wherever we have the opportunity of\nstudying the subject's frame of mind, is the intensity of\nthe mental impression. One would think that if any\nimagination could produce a powerful physical effect upon\nthe body it would be such as is revealed to us in some\nof these stigmatics. We have already noted the case of\nLukardis. But there are many others, in whom the\ndesire of sharing in the suiferings of the Passion by\nenduring the pain of the wounds was very strongly\nmarked. How deep those feelings were in those mystics\nwho, in a state of ecstasy or trance, enacted all the\nscenes of the Passion ^ may be judged from a curiously\nwell authenticated Relazione formerly in the library of the\nGrand Duke of Parma :\nIn February, 1497, a number of gentlemen, twenty-one\nin all, assembled to witness the ecstasy of a certain\n^ At least a score of them could be named, begimiing with Elizabeth of\nHerkenrode in the thirteenth century.

[PART'\nStefana Quinzani who, it seems, was rapt out of herself\nin this way every Friday morning. At dawn they beheld\nher completely identified with our Lord in the scene of\nthe scourging. She stood entranced, her hands above\nher head, boimd with invisible cords to an invisible\npillar. The hands and feet never moved, but the body\nwrithed in anguish. Several of the company used all\ntheir strength to shift the position of the arms, but they\ncould not succeed. They could not so much as bend a\nfinger. She stood like this enduring in imagination the\nscourging for an hour. Her cries and moans were piteous\nbeyond description\n.\nLeaving out much detail, it is desirable to note that\nin the scene of the crowning with thorns, as it presented\nitself to her in the trance, we are told that no pen or\nhuman tongue could convey an idea of the torments,,\nsweats and spasms, she experienced. During the qviarter\nof an hour this lasted, she was bathed in perspiration from\nhead to foot. Then for a space she stood motionless in\necstasy, and during that interval, if anyone touched,,\nhowever lightly, with a thread {filo) or any other tiny\nthing (and it was an experiment which many tried) there\nwas a return of all the pains and cries and lamentations\nfor the anguish caused by the thorny crown. Then she\nseems to have thrown herself on the ground. \" The\nright arm,\" we are told, \" is extended as if the hand\nwere being really and immovably nailed and at once\nthe muscles (nervi) are seen stretched and tense, the\nveins swell and the hand grows black, and just as\nif it were indeed being fastened with a material nail\nshe utters a terrible shriek (grido) followed by piteous\nmoaning. Then the left arm is extended in a simi-\nlar manner to the right, but stretched considerably\nbeyond its natural length {assai sopra la hingagine siia\nnatumle).\"\nAfter this we have an account of the nailing of the\nfeet ; the whole body is drawn vxp except the hands,,\nwhich remain absolutely motionless, \" just as if they had\nbeen securely fastened to a piece of timber with nails of\niron.\" And here there appears a red spot on the foot\n\fLxxxiii.] The Phenomena of Stigmatization. 197\nabout the size of a marcello.^ She lay thus for some\ntime, but we have an indication of the drinking from a\nsponge, and after that the whole body is convulsed as\nthough it were pierced with the lance.\nWhat constitutes the exceptional interest of this docu-\nment is that it is signed by twenty-one witnesses, all of\nthem evidently men of position, who appended their seals.\nAmongst them was a high official of the Inquisition, who\nwas also concerned in investigating the stigmata of Saint\nLucia di Narni. Moreover, they were not content with\nsimply writing their names, but each added a few words\nof comment. Bonafinus, Archdeacon of Vicenza, for\nexample, says that he endorses everything in the state-\nment, and had seen it all mth his own eyes, but that he\nhad not noticed any red patch on the foot. Carohis\nBenzoni, doctor of both civil and canon law, also failed\nto observe the red patch on the foot. Another doctor\nutrivsque juris saw no redness, but he did think the\ninvisibly tied hands seemed blacker on accovmt of their\nswollen condition. Battista di Piacenza declared that he\nused his utmost strength in the attempt to move her\narm, and had failed ;\nfurther, he had very specially\nnoted the redness on the foot. James Figato had tried\nin vain to bend her fingers, but saw no redness. How-\never, a note is here added by himself later, to the effect\nthat on Good Friday he was present again and had a\nbetter view, and \" in particular,\" he says, \" I saw that\nreddening of the feet which I had not noticed in February. ^\n\"\nClearly all this points to the intense influence which\nan absorbing preoccupation in the Passion of Christ is\ncapable of exercising, particularly m the entranced subject.\nWe do not here find any actual effusion of blood, but\n1 The editor of the document says that a marcello was a Venetian\nhalf lira which was coined for the first time by the Doge Niccol6\nMarcello in 1473.

One may readilj' admit that similar phenomena are not at all\nuncommon in epileptic or cataleptic patients and also in the hypnotic\ntrance. But the apparent elongation of the arms seems to be a new\nfeature and the \" immobility \" spoken of suggests something more\nthan mere rigidity.\n\f198 Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J. [part\nthere was the red patch in the foot which apparently\nbecame more pronounced on some occasions than on\nothers. Those who insist upon the supernatural character\nof the stigmata lay great stress upon the difficulty\n\u2014\nsome say the impossibility\u2014of the blood exuding through\nthe skin as long as the epidermis remains intact. There\nmay be congestion of the veins and capillaries owing to\na relaxation of the control of the vaso-motor nerves\u2014this\nis a phenomenon, of course, which is illustrated every\ntime a young person blushes\u2014but it seems to be denied\nby certain physiologists that any forcing of the blood\nthrough the skin can ever take place without actual\ndisease. An author I have consulted puts it this way :\n\" There is not a single example of an internal lesion\nwhich can be attributed to suggestion alone ;\nnow, with-\nout lesion there can be no haemorrhage, since haemorrhage\ncannot take place if the epidermis or the epithelium is\nhealthy, for the very sufficient reason that both epidermis\nand epithelium are entirely destitute of blood vessels.\"\nI have not the medical knowledge which would justify me\nin forming any opinion on the point. But this I can attest :\nthat there are a number of cases on record of incipient\nstigmatization, which cause congestion of the vessels in\nhands, feet, side, forehead, etc., but which seem to stop\nshort of the actual effusion of blood. As in the Sal-\npetriere cases of dermographisme, the congested or possibly\nextravasated blood produces an intense reddening, or even\nblackening of the skin in the affected parts, but there is\noften no haemorrhage. A curious example, that of\nBlessed Magdalen de Panateriis (1503), is thus described.\nWe are told that on Good Friday \" she so completely\nshared Christ's torments that they were represented\noutwardly in her body, not only by action and gesture,\nbut by the flow of her blood. At the time of Christ's\nbloody sweat the blood showed between the flesh and the\nskin {pellem inter et carnem) on her forehead ; at the time\nof the scourging, on her arms and shoulders ; at the\ncrowning with thorns, on the head ; and finally at the\nnailing to the cross, in her hands and feet. Further, dur-\n^ Acta Sanctorum, Auctarium Octobris, p. 174.\n\fLxxxiii.] The Phenomena of Stigmatization. 199\ning the crowning, the blood was seen to stream down\nher face and to bedew the other members of her body\n{videbatiir sanguis in rivi modum faciem aliaque corporis\nmembra copiosius irrigarej.\" ^ This clearly implies that\nthe blood did exude copiously from the brow while she\nwas picturing to herself the crowning with thorns, but\napparently it was unable at other times to get through\nthe epidermis. If the statements made are accurate,\nthey would thus almost seem to imply, first that the\ndelicate epidermis of the forehead was more permeabl\nthan that of the hands and feet, and secondly that the\nintense local concentration involved in the thought of\ncrowning produced actual haemorrhage in that part,\nthough the idea of the sweat of blood, being more diffused,\ndid not.\nIn the case of Louise Lateau we know from a multitude\nof descriptions by medical observers that when the forehead\nbled there was no apparent lesion of the skin. The blood\npercolated through, stood there in beads and then the\ndrops began to run together and trickle down the face.\nThis moisture, as it showed in any quantity, was con-\nstantly wiped off by the bystanders, but almost\nimmediately it exuded again. Even a strong lens\nrevealed no proper laceration of the epidermis, the blood\napparently forced its way out through the sweat ducts.\n^\nThe curious inequality between the sexes in this matter\nof stigmatization suggests the question whether the\nfeminine epidermis may be more readily permeable than\nthe masculine ;\nthough it should perhaps be remembered,\non the other hand, that haemophilia seems to be an\nexclusively masculine disorder. Further, there is no\nadequate ground for explaining the haemorrhage of the\nstigmata, in spite of its frequently periodic character, as\n^ Acta Sanctorum, Auctarium Octobris, p. 174.\n2 Dr. Lefebvre says :\n\" When the bleeding points are examined with\na lens the blood is seen to filter through minute abrasions of the\nepidermis. Most of these are triangular in shape, like the bite, one\nwould say, of a leech, but a leech of an almost microscopic kind, for\nthese abrasions are scarcely visible to the naked eye.\" Louise Laieau\u2014\na Medical Study, Engl.

We know\ndefinitely that in a certain number of stigmatisees, for\nexample in Louise Lateaia, the ordinary processes of\nnature were not interfered with. It has also been alleged\nthat the bleeding of stigmata has begun or at any rate\nbeen continued after the age of fifty, but I must confess\nthat I do not know any instance in which this has been\nestablished upon satisfactory evidence.\nOn a review of the facts as a whole, so far as we have\nbeen able to consider them in this necessarily very rapid\nsurvey, it may be admitted that although the phenomena\nof stigmatization do seem to postulate an astoundingly\nwide range for the influence of the mind over the body,\nstill there is so far nothing which necessitates our having\nrecourse to a supernatural explanation. Cases of haema-\ntidrosis, though very rare, still do occur in ordinary\npathology. It cannot now be maintained that diapedesis\n(i.e. the oozing of blood through the unruptured wall of\nthe capillaries) does not exist in nature. Neither can\nwe say that the epidermis is always absolutely impermeable\nto the passage of blood. Whether the blood be conveyed\nby the sudoriferous or the sebaceous ducts, or in some\nother way, it does sometimes get through without any\nactual rupture of the skin. At the same time it still\nseems to be true, as Professor F. Lefebvre contended in\n1872,1 that no satisfactory parallel can be adduced to\nthe haemorrhage from the stigmata. The epidermis in\nthe palms of the hands and the soles of the feet is much\nless delicate than in other parts of the body.

There are\nno doiibt a certain number of instances of blisters pro-\nduced artificially by suggestion. Dr. J.

This Hungarian girl seems to have been one\nof the most suggestible subjects on record. We are told\nof her that a sheet of writing-paper bound on her leg\nproduced redness and a small blister on the following\nmorning. Also that the edge of a match-box and the\nedge of a medicine glass pressed on her forearm with\nthe suggestion that they were red-hot prodviced in the\nafternoon a blister and a brand wound in the form of\nthe objects named, leaving permanent scars.

Pierre Janet,\nin his book Nevroses et Idees Fixes, gives a picture of\nan excoriation of the epidermis resulting from a pemphegus\npustule occurring in his subject \"V. K.\" after a cruci-\nfixion illusion. But of a continuous or spontaneously\nrecurrent haemorrhage resulting from suggestion or occur-\nring otherwise in a hysterical patient imder medical\nobservation I have been unable to discover any trace.\nWe may perhaps fairly draw the conclusion that the\nauto-suggestion of the mystic\u2014if indeed it be auto-\nsuggestion\u2014is an immensely more powerful influence than\nhypnosis, and ceteris paribus is so far more deserving of\nstudy. However, let me admit that with regard to the mani-\nfestations hitherto described, the difference between mystical\nphenomena and hypnotic phenomena seems to be one of\ndegree rather than of kind. Very probably it is all a matter\nof vaso-motor control, but the fact that such a disorder\nas haemophilia is apparently traceable to a congenital\ndefect in the coagulating power of the blood suggests\nother possibilities that have not perhaps as yet been\nsufficiently investigated.\nWe might, then, rest content with the solution that\nthe wounds of the stigmatized mystic were produced by\nauto-suggestion, if the problem were limited to the data\nwhich we have so far been occupied in considering. But\nthis is not the end of the matter. There are other alleged\nphenomena\u2014^phenomena for which very respectable, if not\nconvincing, evidence is producible, which demand a still\nfurther extension of the range of the mind's influence over\nthe body. We are informed upon the testimony of surgeons\nof note in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that\nin the case of several stigmatized persons the tissues of\nthe heart, as revealed in a post-mortem examination,\nhave been found exhibiting unmistakable traces of\ntremendous lesions or indurations of old date,^ lesions\n^ It will be remembered that tlio blow of the lance was commonly\nsupposed by mystical writers not only to have pierced the side of\nour Saviour, but also to have reached the heart.\n\fLxxxiii.] The Phenomena of Stigmatization. 203\nwhich would under normal circumstances have rendered\nthe continuance of life impossible for more than a few\nminutes. Our first impulse would naturally be to dismiss\nthese statements as mere fairy tales, but they are not\nquite so easily disposed of. They rest, in many cases,\nupon the sworn evidence of medical men who, though\nbelonging to a less scientific age than ours, were, never-\ntheless, experienced anatomists.\nAlthough St. Theresa was never in any proper sense\nstigmatized, her history supplies a famous, even if ill-\nattested, example of the phenomenon of which I am\nspeaking. She tells us quite plainly in her autobiography\nthat she had a vision of a glorious angel who thrust a\nlong golden spear with a fiery point right into her heart.\n^\nWe have also some indication of the impression this\nincident produced upon the Saint in the fact that she\nmade it the subject of a hymn still preserved to us.\nSt. Theresa's heart was extracted after death and in it,\nwe are told, was found a wide horizontal fissure which\nmay still be seen in the heart to this day. There is\nnot, however, any satisfactory evidence that this wound\nwas not made in the operation of removal, which was\nperformed by unskilled hands.\nA better example, resting upon the testimony of several\neye-witnesses whose depositions are still preserved to us,\nis the wound in the heart of Caterina Savelli of Sezze.\nThis is a stigmatic (she died in 1691) who has escaped\nthe researches of Dr. Imbert Gourbeyre. When kneeling\nbefore the Blessed Sacrament exposed in the Jesuit\nchurch of Sezze in 1659 she saw in a trance five rays\ncome from the Sacred Host which wounded her hands,\nfeet and side. She prayed that the stigmata might not\nbecome known, and her prayer was so far heard that no\nmarks appeared on the hands, though the side remained\nopen, and blood or serum flowed from it at intervals.\nAfter death, however, the traces of wounds in the hands\nand feet became perfectly plain, and, what was most\nnoteworthy, the heart being extracted there was found\nin it a deep fissure of old date. The physician and the\n1 Autobiography, Ch. XXIX,, pp. 16 and 17.\n\f204 Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J. [part\nsurgeon, who with many ecclesiastics signed the final\nattestation, declared that without supernatural inter-\nvention it would have been impossible for anyone to\nlive with such a wound.\n^\nI have spoken at some length of the case of Diomira\nAllegri. She died nine months after that extraordinary\necstasy of the Ash Wednesday morning in which she\nreceived the stigmata. Two surgeons, held in their own\nday to be eminent men, made the post-mortem. They\nfound an aperture in the breast, of which they exactly\ndescribe the size and shape. They found the lungs in a\nvery diseased condition, but in a part of the organ which\nwas apparently sound they detected an open passage (of\nwhich again they indicate the diameter) between the\nouter wound and the heart. Finally, in the heart itself\nthey discovered a cicatrix of which they each drew a\nfigure. To quote the words of one of them :\n\" Passing\nnow to the observation of the heart, I recognised that\nthe pericardium was in its natvu'al state, but on the\noutside of the heart I found a cicatrix of a roughly oval\nshape of the size I here indicate. It was unmistakably\nmarked out, both by its texture, which was harder and\nmore resistent to the knife, and by its pallid colour,\nwhich was totally different from the substance of the\nrest of the heart.\" -\nStill more remarkable are the extraordinary things\nwhich are asserted and apparently confirmed by comjjetent\nmedical testimony concerning the heart of St. Veronica\nGiuliani. She believed that the \" instruments of the\nPassion,\" cross, scourges, pillar, ladder, nails, etc., were\nactually reproduced in miniature in the substance of her\nheart, and during her life she even drew a plan of the\narrangement of these objects. When she died, a post-\nmortem was performed by a surgeon and a physician,\nin the presence of several ecclesiastics and others. A\n' The documents will be found printed at length in G. B. Memmi,\nS.J., Vita delta Serva di Dio Suor Caterina Savclli, Rome, 1733, pp. 132-\n142.\n\" See the Summarium in the \" Positio de Virtntibus \" in the Process o\nBeatification.\n\fLxxxni.] The Phenomena of Stigmatization. 205\nformal instrument was drawn up, signed by the medical\nmen and by all present, attesting the actual discovery of\nall these symbols. They were quite hard in texture and\nclearly defined in shape, and were found in the relative\npositions previously indicated. What the evidential value\nof this document is I do not pretend to say, but it was\na sworn deposition signed by all present and it was\ntreated seriously by the officials concerned in the beati-\nfication process. The document itself is, I believe,\nreproduced in full in the printed Summarium. Unfor-\ntunately, I have hot yet been able to obtam access to\na copy.\nThere are several other examples of the same kind.\nTo show that the evidence for these extraordinary physio-\nlogical marvels is not entirely contemptible I would refer\nto an account of the shrine of St. Clare of Montefalco\nwhich is given by the late Mr. John Addington Symonds\nin the Cornhill Magazine for October, 1881 (pp. 446-447).\nMr. Symonds will not be suspected of excessive ecolasiasti-\ncism, but he states after viewing the still incorrupt body\nof the saint, who died in 1308 : \"I have rarely seen\nanything which surprised and touched me more.\" His\naccount, in any case, fully bears out the statements\nmade by eye-witnesses regarding the condition of the\nsame remains two hundred or three hundred years earlier.^\nThen he goes on :\n\" St. Clare's shrine was hung round\nwith her refics ; and among these the heart extracted\nfrom her body was suspended. Upon it, apparently\nwrought into the very substance of the mummied fiesh,\nwas impressed a figure of the crucified Christ, the scourge\nand the five stigmata. The guardian's faith in this\nmiraculous witness to her saintship, the gentle piety\nof the men and women who knelt before it, checked all\nexpressions of incredulity. ... 1 have often asked myself,\nWho then was this nun ? What history has she ? Is\nshe a rival [to St. Clare of Assisi] or a counterfeit 1\n\" But\nthe problem, suspended by lack of active curiosity at\nMontefalco, has never smce been solved. A description\n^ Several of these deaeriptions will be found cited in the Bollandist Acta\nSanctorum, August, vol. iii. p. 675.\n\f206 Rev. Herbert Tlmrston, S.J.

Or can we believe that in the hands and\nfeet of St. Francis of Assisi there were produced not only\nfissures, which went right through, but also a hard and\nhorny substance in the form of nails which were clinched\nbehind in such a manner that a finger could be inserted\nbetween the flesh and the protruding end bent back ?\nHistorically speaking, there is quite good evidence for\nthis feature, such evidence as would be considered fair\nsecurity for any fact less marvellous.\nSomewhat less astonishing than this, but still very\ncurious, are the instances of espousal rings which many\nstigmatized mystics believe to have been placed on their\nfinger by Christ our Lord in token of their spiritual\nnuptials with Him. The late Dr. Imbert Gourbeyre,\nwho has written two books on the svibject of stigmatiza-\ntion, and who was brought into personal relation with\nLouise Lateau and several other stigmatisees, was assuredly\nnot a critically-minded investigator. Still I believe his per-\nsonal good faith to have been above suspicion, and he\noccupied for thirty-six years the position of Professor at\nthe Medical School of Clermont. Amongst the subjects\nin whom he was interested was a certain Marie-Julie\nJahenny. He had the sanction, and indeed the warm\nencouragement of the Bishoj) of the diocese in making a\nspecial study of the case, and he saw the girl repeatedly,\nkeeping in touch with her during a period of some\nseventeen years.\nMarie-Julie, then about twenty-three years old, exhibited\nin successive stages the various phenomena of stigmatiza-\ntion, beginning in March, 1873. These were crowned in\nthe February of the following year by the appearance of\n\fLXXXIII.] The Phenomena of Stigmatization 207\na mystical ring, i.e. a hoop of vivid red encircling the\nring finger of her right hand. After fonr years' interval\nthis appearance was further enhanced by the addition of\nthree black points in the place where the bezel of the\nring would naturally be looked for ; but at a somewhat\nlater date the circlet was transformed into a pattern of\ndots and dashes, a facsimile of which is also given by\nDr. Imbert Gourbeyre {La Stigmatization, II. p. 86).\nThe first appearance of the ring was formally made\nknown to Marie-Julie some time beforehand, and when\nin ecstasy she spoke of these forthcoming mystic espousals\nand declared that witnesses ought to be present when\nthey occurred. The actual day was named (February 20,\n1874), and Dr. Gourbeyre explains that he had in his\npossession a letter from her confessor, the Abbe David,\nwritten in January and definitely announcing this date.\nOn Friday, February 20th, everything had occurred as\nhad been prophesied, and two days afterwards, says Dr.\nGourbeyre, I received the following letter :\nGod be praised. Yesterday we had the most consoling daj^\nimaginable. Everything previously foretold has been realised\n. . . In accordance with the directions of Monseigneur (the\nBishop) I had made arrangements beforehand. There were\nfourteen men there to act as witnesses, seven from Blain, one\nfrom Cambon, two from Gavre, three from Nantes sent from\nthe Cathedral, and one from La Fraudais (the hamlet in which\nMarie-Julie resided). At half past eight we had satisfied\nourselves that the wounds were quite dry, that the ring\nfinger of the right hand was in a healthy state, pale as death\nwithout any trace of a ring.\nAt nine o'clock all the wounds (the stigmata) began to\nbleed. At about a quarter past we perceived that the finger\nwas becoming swollen and reddening under the skin. About\na quarter to ten blood was running from the upper and lower\nsurface of the finger, and by degrees we saw the ring take\nshape. It is now clearly marked for all her life to come . . .\nMonseigneur is full of enthusiasm.^\nDr. Imbert Gourbeyre, writing in 1894, remarks :\n'Imbert Gourbeyre, La Stigmatisation (1894), vol, ii p. 116.\n\f208 Rev.

No doubt it is\npossible to discredit the evidence, which cannot in any\ncase be regarded as satisfactory. Further investigation is\ncertainly needed.

Preliminary.\nAmongst the so-called physical phenomena of spiritualism\nmaterialization is probably the rarest and the least\ncredible. Eminently suitable for fraudulent representation\nand at the same time extremely popular with the less\neducated layman, such phenomena have attracted but\nlittle attention from scientific men. When Sir William\nCrookes studied the materializations which were alleged\nto take place in the presence of Florence Cook, the\nscientific world was unmoved, except by derision, and\nindeed the data that were presented did not permit of\nany confident judgment being expressed one way or the\nother. Materializations are reported to have taken place\noccasionally in the presence of Eusapia Palladino, but in\nthe majority of these instances the appearances consisted\n\f210 A Series of Sittings tvith Eva C. [part\nof more or less complete plastic forms, and not the\nrudimentary and crude productions of the medium under\nconsideration in this report. Similar phenomena have\nbeen noticed occasionally with other mediums, but such\nappearances have been usually of a fleeting character,\nand few photographs have ever been taken of them.\nIn the present instance Eva C. is said to have materialized\nfull forms at the Villa Carmen in Algiers, and only later\nbegan to develop that peculiar form of mediumship which\nis now usually associated with her. There is little\nevidence that phenomena of this sort accompanied\nthe phantasms in Algiers, and though Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing has since his study of the case of Eva C. de-\nscribed somewhat analogous cases, we are not aware of any\nabsolutely similar phenomena being previously recorded.^\nThe elaborate investigation of this medium by Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing described in his work Materialisations-\nPhdnomene, recently translated by Dr. Fournier D'Albe\n[Phenomeyia of Materialisation, Kegan Paul, 35s.), and\nby Madame Juliette Bisson in her companion, though\nsmaller work, Phenomenes de Materialisation (Alcan), and\nthe subsequent experiments by Dr. Geley described in\nhis La Physiologie dite supra normale (Paris, 1918) have\ngiven the case of this medium peculiar significance.\nAt the time that the English seances took place she\nwas about thirty-four years of age. She first began\nher career as a medium in 1903, and in 1905 she was\ngiving materialization seances in Algiers, at some of which\nProf. Richet was present. In 1908 she came to Paris\nand began to give private sittings under the auspices\nof M. and Mme Alexandre Bisson. Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing joined the circle in 1909, and with the assistance\n^ In the seventeenth century it is sometimes recorded that hysterica\nvomited curious substances. Thus the girl Christian Shaw is said to\nhave exhibited hair and a substance resembling candle grease in her\nmouth which were rapidly withdrawn when an attempt was made to\npull them out (Sadducismus Debellatus, London, 1698, p. 4). Sucli\ncurious vomits had also been noticed in those persons who were supposed\nto be possessed (see Traicti des marques des possedez. Par P. M. Esc.\nD. en M., Rouen, 1644, pp. H seq.), and similar accounts abound in the.\nwitchcraft trials.\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. 211\nof Mme Bissoii began to insist upon those methods of\nscientific control which have more or less persisted up to\nthe present time. For a fuller account of the earlier\nhistory of the medium see the article by J\\Irs. Salter\n(Helen de G. Verrall) in Volume XXVII. of the Society's\nProceedings, pp. 333-369.\nMrs. Salter's article carries the history of Eva C. up\nto 1914. There is little of importance that need be said\nconcerning events occurring after that date. A certain\nnumber of experiments were conducted in Paris with\nvarious investigators during the period of the war, and\nDr. Gustave Geley arranged with Mme Bisson for a\nyear and a half's experimental work with two sittings a\nweek. He confirms the observations of Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing and Mme Bisson, but his detailed\nreports have not yet been published and cannot therefore\nbe examined. In 1919 representatives of the English\nSociety for Psychical Research were in communication\nwith Mme Bisson, and in April, 1920, on their invitation,\nshe kindly consented to visit England with the medium,\nthe resulting investigation being the subject of this\nreport.\n\u00a7 2. The Present Investigation.\nThe object of the present investigation was to enable\nthe phenomena of Eva C. to be studied at first hand\nby members of the Society, in the hope that the con-\nclusions of the Continental investigators might be con-\nfirmed and a basis laid for further study of the physical\nphenomena, which up till now, with the exception of\nEusapia Palladino, had been somewhat neglected by the\nSociety, owing to the great difficulty of persuading\nmediums to submit to scientific investigation, and also\nto the fact that when mediums did give sittings fraud\nwas almost invariably discovered. As criticism in this\ncountry had therefore been mainly directed upon the\nalleged fraudulent aspect of the phenomena, it was hoped\nthat by the exercise of a stringent control the possibility\nof fraudulent manipulation might be still further reduced.\n\f212 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part lxxxiv.]\nThe time at the disposal of the Society was of too short\na diiration to enable the Committee to make any elaborate\npsychological or pathological investigation. To satisfy\nthemselves as to the reality of the phenomena and at\nthe same time to endeavour to observe more closely\nthe actual formation and disappearance of the so-called\npsycho-plastic \" substance, which the earlier investigators\nhad postulated as the raw material from which the more\ncomplex phenomena were formed, was the most that\nthey could attempt during the short time that it was\npossible for Mme Bisson and the medium to remain\nin this country.\nWith a view to making all the necessary arrangements\nfor the reception of Mme Bisson and the medium and\nfor the investigation of the phenomena, the Council\nappointed a Committee of three persons with power to\nco-opt. The three original members of the Committee\nwere the Hon. Everard Feilding, Mr. W. Whately Smith\nand the Hon. Research Officer, Mrs. Salter. The co-opted\nmembers were first Mr. W. W. Baggally and Dr. V. J.\nWoolley, and later (after the ninth sitting) Mr. E. J.\nDingwall. Other persons were from time to time present\nat the sittings at the invitation of the Committee.\n\fCHAPTER I.\nGENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE SITTINGS.\n\u00a7 1. The Seance Room.\nThe room chosen by the Committee for the seances was\none of the Society's own rooms at 20 Hanover Square,\nLondon, W. The room, carpeted, but sparsely furnished,\nmeasures 15 ft. 3 ins. by 15 ft. G ins., and it was here\nthat the cabinet was set up for the seances. This\nstructure, measuring inside 5 ft. 8 ins. long, 4 ft. 3J ins.\nwide and 6 ft. 11 ins. high, was placed ^in a corner of\nthe room, one side making an angle with the window.\nFormed out of black casement cloth nailed to stout\nlaths, it was provided with a roof, and at the sides and\nback the cloth was brought under and over the bottom\nlath making a solid framework flush with the floor. In\nfront, a couple of black curtains ran along a polished\nbrass rod supported in the centre by a hook, whilst\nthe floor was covered with a black cloth extending 22|\ninches beyond the front of the cabinet.\nThe window was fitted with black light-proof shutters\nscrewed to the frame, one of which was furnished with\nhinges enabling daylight to be admitted at will. Over\nthe side of the cabinet next to the window was thrown\na dull red cloth, to exclude from the cabinet any light\nfrom the window, when the light-proof shutter was open.\nUsually, however, the only light for the experiments was\nfurnished by a clear glass electric bulb of 32 watts in a\nplum-coloured sateen bag. It was surrounded by an\nopaque screen, starting from the left front of the cabinet,\nand folded into the shape of a triangle, whence the\n213\n\f214 A Series of Sittings ivifh Eva C. [part\nlight emanated. Over the top of this triangle a light\nbine cloth was flnng. By altering the position of the\nsurrounding cloths the light from the lamp could easily\nbe increased or reduced, and this was often done at\nMme Bisson's suggestion during the course of the sittings.\nDOOR '\n\/SF.'- Sins.\nA.

Ruliy shaded light.\nTo the left-hand side of the front of the cabinet\nimmediately in front of the screen was placed a small\ntable at which the observer sat who was taking notes,\nand upon this table lay a 30 watt lamp of ruby glass\nenclosed in a red handkerchief. The light from this\nlamp was further reduced by a camera case which was\nplaced in front of it, thus preventing the light from\nfalling directly on to the front of the cabinet. Hanging\njust on a level with the top right-hand corner of the\ncabinet was a clear glass electric lamp which was removed\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 215\nimmediately tlie medium entered into trance and was\nnot again lighted till she left the cabinet at the conclusion\nof the seance. An electric torch was also provided\nfor a closer inspection of the phenomena than was possible\nwith the ordinary illumination, and this was occasionally\nmade use of by the observers as recorded in the detailed\nreport.^\nWithin the cabinet, immediately opposite the opening\nof the front curtains, with its front legs a couple of\ninches from the front line of the curtains, was placed\nthe medium's seat, a somewhat dilapidated but thoroughly\ncomfortable wicker arm-chair, the lowest part of the\nseat being 10 ins. from the ground, the back 2 ft. 1 in.\nand the highest part of the arms 11 ins. from the outer\nedges of the seat.\nImmediately opposite the cabinet and accurately focussed\nupon the medium as she sat well back in her chair were\nthe two cameras which had been kindly lent by Messrs.\nElliott and Fry, of 55 Baker St., London, and were under\nthe control of Mr. Jarraud of the same firm. We\nshould like to take this opportunity of thanking Messrs.\nElliott and Fry for their assistance and co-operation in\nthe experiments, and we desire to place on record our\nappreciation of Mr. Jarraud's kindness in giving us the\nbenefit of his experience in the course of investigations\nwhich must, at times, have seriously interfered with his own\npersonal convenience. The installation comprised firstly an\nordinary field camera fitted with a 3 B. Dalmeyer portrait\nlens which was usually focussed on the medium's shoulders\nas she sat in her customary position in the arm-chair.\nThe second camera was a Goetz-Anschutz snapshot camera\nGenerally speaking the light was such that Mr. Feilding, who usually\n\u00abat from five to eight feet from the front of the cabinet, reported\nthat he was able to distinguish the face of each sitter if he had pre-\nviously known who they were, and could see the medium's hands\noutside the curtains, though not sufficiently clearly to distinguish the\nfingers. It was therefore sufficient for the controllers, who sat as\nclose as possible to the medium, clearly to see her hands, and to\nappreciate the appearance of a \" phenomenon \" even inside the curtains\nof the cabinet, but not to see it in any detail without the help of an\nelectric torch.\n\f216 A Series of Sittings loith Eva C. [part\nwith Zeiss lens which stood a little to the left of the\nlarger portrait camera. Just behind Mme Bisson's seat\nstood the electrical and smokeless flash-light apparatus.\nThe pear for igniting the flash was connected to a long\nrubber tube which enabled it to be placed within easy\nreach of the sitters in readiness when required. On\ncertain occasions other cameras were employed, but un-\nfortunately the phenomena were too rare for the\nobservers to be able to make much use of them. Gener-\nally speaking, the Committee, whilst fully appreciating\nthe value of photographic evidence, believed that an\nattentive examination of the phenomena under the light\nof the torch would probably be of greater service than\nthe taking of a great number of photographs. As it was,\nhowever, there was such an extreme paucity of phenomena\nthat even had it been the Committee's intention to secure\na large collection of negatives it would have been impos-\nsible, but those photographs which were taken included\nsome of exceptional interest.\n\u00a7 2. Conduct of the Seances.\nBefore the arrival of the medium and Mme Bisson\nthe seance room was aired, the photographic and flash-\nlight apparatus set up, and the cabinet and arm-chair\nthoroughly examined. Paper and pencils were put in\nreadiness for the recorder, and the electric torch was\ntested and placed on one of the chairs destined for the\nobservers. The costume to be worn by the medium was\nalso examined by one or more members of the Committee,\nand the Research Oflicer's room prepared for the reception\nof Mme Bisson and the medium. On their arrival they\nwere conducted direct to this room, which immediately\nadjoined that prepared for the seances, and here the\nmedium proceeded to change her clothes and put on\nthe garments which she was accustomed to wear during\nthe sittings. These consisted of a pair of dark grey\nstockinette combination-tights, made in one piece with hose\ncomplete and fastening at the wrists and half-way up the\nback with white thread. Over the tights she usually wore\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. 217\na loose black pleated smock of coarse cotton, furnished\nwith sleeves, which fitted close to the wrists, and fastened\nat the back with a couple of buttons. Within the\nsmock was a small pocket which does not seem to have\nbeen used by the medium and which was habitually\nturned out before the seances. These garments were\nthose that the medium had been accustomed to wear\nand had been brought over from Paris by Mme Bisson.\nFrom the twentieth to the thirty-sixth seance (inclusive)\nthe medium wore over her head a fine black net veil\nsewn on to the neck of her tights.\nAfter the tights and smock had been examined the\nmedium undressed entirely, this operation being super-\nintended either by Dr. WooUey and Mrs. Salter or by\nMrs. Salter alone or by another of the ladies present\nwhen Mrs. Salter was unable to attend. The medium\nhaving put on the tights, they were sewn up by one of the\ncontrollers, the medium's mouth, nose, ears and hair were\ninspected, the smock put on and her hands held till she\nwas ready to accompany the investigators to the seance\nroom. When the signal was given, the medium, still\nholding the hands of one of the controllers and accom-\npanied by Mme Bisson and the rest of the observers,\nentered the seance room, the door of which was locked and\nbolted and the room lighted by the clear electric lamp\nhanging at the right-hand side of the cabinet. Having\ntaken her place in her chair with Mme Bisson sitting\nexactly opposite to her on a low seat, she placed her two\nhands within those of Mme Bisson, who, holding her two\nthumbs and gazing into her eyes, proceeded to hypnotize\nher. Usually after about thirty seconds the medium began\nto moan slightly, her head drooped over to one side, she\nsank back into her chair and the trance came on. Her\nhands were once more examined and then passed into the\ncare of the controllers, who sat at right-angles to her and\nclose up to the folds of the front curtain. The instant\nthat the controllers had hold of her hands the curtains\nwere drawn in front, the clear lamp put out, the recorder's\nred lamp lighted and the cloths arranged round the bulb\nhidden behind the screen.\n\f218 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nEva's condition during the sittings did not vary greatly\nexcept just before the appearance of the phenomena.\nGenerally speaking she remained quietly resting in her\nchair, there being, however, decided variations in the\npulse rates and occasionally a marked feeling of chill\nin the hands, these sometimes becoming quite cold and\nsomewhat clammy. The phenomena themselves were\nusually ushered in by an increase in the rate of respira-\ntion, by sighs and groans and often by a flow of thick\nwhite saliva which dripped from the medium's mouth.\nThe timbre of the breathing changed as the phenomena\napproached ;\nresjDiration became rapid and throaty ; the\nmedium struggled and often uttered strident cries cul-\nminating occasionally in shrieks. At this stage of develop-\nment, which Mme Bisson usually signalled by saying that\nthe medium was \" prise par les forces,'' Eva was wont to\ncall upon the observers to lend her aid by urging\nthe phenomena to show themselves. The sitters were\nadvised to call in chorus, ''Venez! venez I \" etc., and\nMme Bisson urged the medium to give herself up to\nthe forces which were possessing her. Sometimes the\nattack passed off and nothing appeared, but during our\nsittings the especially violent convulsions were almost\nalways followed by the appearance of the phenomena.\nThe medium would lean forward out of the cabinet and\nshow, for example, the end of a white object beginning\nto form itself between her lips, or she would press her\ncheek against the back of the chair, whereupon the sitters\nperceived a large Avhite packet emerging from her mouth.\nIf the phenomena were favourably placed for a photo-\ngraph, one was taken by means of the flash-light apparatus,\nand the cameras immediately prepared for another, if\nnecessary. During the continuance of the phenomena\nMme Bisson would frequently turn the torch, which she\nusually controlled, on to them, so that they could be\nmore closely examined. As this mode of examination\nseemed to agitate the medium and to cause her to shrink\nfrom the increased light, the beam was only thrown\nintermittently for periods of a few seconds at a time,\nso that really continuous observation was impossible.\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 219\nAfter the phenomena had disappeared and the medium\nhad given us to understand that she felt nothing more,\nthe seance closed and the controllers assisted lier to\nrise from her chair and leave the cabinet. The lamp\nover the cabinet was then relit, and she was conducted,\nas before, still in trance state, to the dressing room, where\nshe was subjected to exactly the same control as before\nthe seance. When she had completed her toilet she left\nthe building with Mme Bisson and did not enter it\nagain until the next sitting. Meanwhile the observers\nagain examined the cabinet, the medium's chair and her\nseance costume, when she had removed it, and after they\nhad finished, the room was locked up and the key given\ninto the charge of one of the officers of the Society.\n\u00a7 3. The Coi^trol.\nWe have already indicated above the method of control\nthat was adopted both before and after each seance. At\nthe earlier sittings, especially at the first five which were\nheld, the Committee was not altogether satisfied as to\nthe degree of strictness of control at the beginning and\nend of each seance. No blame for this, however, is to\nbe imputed to Mme Bisson, or to the medium, who\nreadily consented to the increased strictness of control\nimposed from the sixth seance onwards, the medium\nbeing completely stripped and the process of disrobing\nbeing more accura,tely observed.\nDuring the seances themselves the control was excellent\nin every way. The hands of the medium were either\nheld by the controllers at either side of her, or were\nallowed to rest on her own or upon their knees, thus\nremaining perfectly visible throughout the entire sitting.\nIt was only upon the rarest occasions that they dis-\nappeared behind the curtains, and then only for a fraction\nof a second, the controllers immediately opening the\ncurtains and again taking possession of them. It must\nindeed be said in justice to the medium that she\nappeared to do everything in her power to assist in the\nproper control of her hands and feet. The latter were\n\f220 A Series of Sittings witJi Eva G. [part\nusually placed on the floor in front of her or upon the\ncontroller's feet, but on many occasions the medium\nturned sideways in her chair, and, asking one of the\ncontrollers to hold her hands, placed both her knees\nbetween his.\nThe Committee were of the opinion that a gynaecological\nexamination of the medium before each sitting was not\nnecessary. Such an examination would have been ex-\ntremely irksome to the medium herself and it would\nhave been found difficult to insist upon it before every\nseance. So long as the control of the hands during the\nsitting was satisfactory, the introduction of objects, either\nby internal concealment or by other methods, was of\nsecondary importance. In such conditions the costume\nworn would render the extrusion of such objects, if there\nhad been any, an absolute impossibility. The main care\nof the controllers was therefore to see that the hands\nplayed no part in the possible abstraction or manipulation\nof objects which the medium had previously concealed\nabout her. This task was, as has already been said,\nsingularly simple, since the medium made no attempts to\nevade the control in any manner whatsoever. Acting\nupon these principles the Committee, whilst taking all\nreasonable precautions against the deliberate introduction\nof objects, concentrated their attention upon the control\nduring the seance and made no undue demands upon the\nmedium before and after. What this control in fact\namounted to can best be seen from a perusal of the\nfollowing accounts, which have been drawn up by those,\nwho most often exercised it.\nMrs. Salter's Account.\nReport on the method of searching adopted at the sittings\nivith Eva\nOn those occasions when I was present the method of\nsearching was as follows :\nThe medium and Mme Bisson, when they arrived, went\nstraight into the room adjoining the seance room, which had\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. 221\nbeen set apart for the purpose of the searching. Then in\nmy presence the medium stripped herself entirely and stood\nwith her arms extended, and hands open so that I might see\nshe had nothing concealed in them or in the armpits. She\nallowed me to look at her both from the front and the back.\nShe then took uji the stockinette costume, which had been\npreviously examined by at least one member of the Committee,\nand slipped her legs into it, pulling it up over her body.\nShe then pulled it over her arms and I took hold of the\ncostume by the neck and looked to see if there was anything\nin the way of a thread. I then sewed it up the back with\nwhite thread. Next I handed her the black cotton pinafore\nwhich had also been previously examined. This she slipped\nover her arms and I buttoned the two buttons at the neck.\nOn those occasions when it was expected that she would\nwear the j^inafore throughout the sitting, I sewed the cuffs of\nthe pinafore close up round her wrists, sewing them through\nto the under dress of stockinette. On one or two occasions,\nowing to the heat, it \\Yas suggested that the medium should\nbe allowed to take off the pinafore. On those occasions the\ncuffs of the pinafore were left open but the stockinette sleeves\nwere sewn tightly round her wTists. When Dr. WooUey was\npresent, he came in after the jDinafore had been put on and\nexamined the medium's hair, mouth, ears, etc. When Dr.\nWoolley was not present, I made this examination myself.\nIn dressing her hair the medium Avore nothing but a few\nordinary metal hairpins, and two small side-combs. I examined\nthese more than once and found nothing unusual about them.\nAfter the pinafore had been put on, the medium's hands w^ere\nexamined front and back, to see if there were anything in\nthe nature of a thread.\nHer hands were then taken by one of the Committee\n\u2014\nusually Dr. WooUey or Mr. Dingwall\u2014and she was led into\nthe seance room and put in her chair.\nAt the first two sittings at which I was present (April 24\nand 26) the medium showed some objection to my seeing her\nstark naked, and Mme Bisson held open the black pinafore\nbetween me and the medium till she had slijDped the stockinette\ndress over her legs. At the fourth and fifth sittings (April 28\nand 30) at Avhich a hairy substance and a hard object Avere\n\f222 A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. [part\nobserved, I was not present, and cannot say what took place.\nAt subsequent sittings Mme Bisson never came anywhere near\nthe medium when the searching was taking place, and, as\nobserved above, I had a full view of the medium absolutely\nstri^Dped. She never upon any occasion took mto the seance\nroom any of the clothing she had \\\\'orn wiien she arrived\nat 20 Hanover Square.\nAfter the sittings, on all occasions upon which any phenomena\nhad been observed, the medium was taken straight into the\ndressing room, one of the Committee holding her by the hands.\nI then cut the thread with which the two garments worn\nat the sittings were sewn up and stripped the medium. The\ngarments were then handed to one of the Committee for\nexamination. The medium then proceeded to put her ordinary\nclothes on. During the process of dressing Mme Bissou\nusually woke the medium from trance, but she never came\nnear her until after the strippmg off of the seance clothes.\nUpon those occasions when the medium wore a veil, the\nveil was sewn to the neck of her tunic after she had put on\nthe tunic and slipped the veil over her head. It was not\nthought necessary, when she wore a veil, to take her hair down\nand search it ; otherwise the method of search was the same\nas usual.\nDr. Woolley's Account.\nOn all the occasions when I was present, 1 examined the\noral cavity, ears and hair of the medium.\nHer mouth was widely open and I was able to depress her\ntongue with a spoon and also to separate the cheek from the\ngum to satisfy myself that no object was concealed in any\npart of the mouth.\nHer hair was let down and carefully felt all over ; after\nwhich I handed her her hairpins to fasten it up again.\nAt the sittings at which Mrs. Salter was not present I took\nher place in the dressing room and carried out the pro-\ncedure which she has already described, but it was only after\nabout half a dozen sittings that the search became as thorough\nas Mrs. Salter has described.\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. 223\nIn these earlier sittings I do not think that anyone saw\nthe medium completely undressed, our view being that over-\ninsistence at an early stage of the series might appear un-\nsympathetic to the medium and tend to hinder phenomena.\nOn those occasions when Mrs. Salter was present I did not\nenter the dressing room until after the medium had put on lier\nstockinette costume.\n\u00a7 4. General Account of the Phenomena.\nIt must be admitted with regret that this London\nseries of sittings was singularly lacking in phenomena\nof such a character as necessarily to enforce conviction\nof their authenticity. Not only were the larger phenomena\nas recorded by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing and Dr. Geley\naltogether absent, but on no single occasion (save for\none rather doubtful exception) did anything which pur-\nported to be a materialization appear from any other\npart of the medium's body than her mouth. In the\ninvestigations which had been previously conducted, the\nflat pseudo-hands and heads not only appeared spon-\ntaneously, but left the neighbourhood of the medium,\nand showed themselves at the parting of the curtains\nor at a distance from her in the cabinet. Again,\nthe full form phantasm, described and photographed by\nMme Bisson and Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, never appeared,\nand upon no single occasion did we have the opportunity\nof studying the fully developed and life-like human\nhands which have been noticed by former investigators.\nThis paucity of phenomena made the task of judging\nthe case impartially by no means easj^ This was all the\nmore unfortunate, since it had been hoped that the series\nof sittings held by the Society would have definitely\nestablished the validity of the phenomena concerning\nwhich grave doubts had been expressed. Circumstances,\nhowever, prevented us from attaining the wished-for\ngoal, although it is doubtful whether the fault was our\nown, or arose from other causes. Mme Bisson rather\ninclined to the view that our mentality was unfavourable,\nand seemed to imagine that the Committee was thinking of\n\f224 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nnothing but fraud, and the possibilities of trickery. Such\nan opinion was manifestly based on a misapprehension which,\nhowever, we foxnid it difficult to dispel. Whatever may '\nhave been the reasons for the meagre character of the t\nphenomena, they attained a certain degree of variety,\nand now and then were of an extremely interesting kind.\nThe saliva, which was copious and very white, was difficult\nsometimes to distinguish from the '\nsubstance '\nwhich\noften much resembled it although in a more solidified\nform. According to Mme Bisson, the appearance of the\n'\nsubstaiace,' which she regards as the materialized basis\nfrom which the formations are gradually built up, is\noften preceded by the flow of normal, although peculiarly\nthick, white saliva from the medium's mouth. The\n'\nsubstance '\nitself, however, according to the earlier\nexperimenters, does not only proceed from the medium's\nmouth, but also from the other bodily orifices and occa-\nsioiiially also from the fingers, the neck and the back.\nIn our own experiments we had unfortunately no clear\nevidence of this.\nThe phenomena proper may be roughly divided into\ntwelve groups which could, if desired, be again sub-\ndivided into various categories. These groups may\nconveniently be arranged thus :\n\u2014\nI. Small spots and patches of seemingly luminous\nsubstance which appeared on various parts of\nthe medium's body. E.g. April 26, 4.50 p.m. ;\nMay 17, 10.2 p.m.\n11. White objects of indeterminate shape. E.g. May 6,\n6.13 p.m. ;\nMay 10, 6.30 p.m. ; June 21, 10.57\np.m.\nIII. Flat whitish, yellowish or greyish disc-like objects,\nwhich usually showed themselves at the medium's\nmouth or adhering to various parts of her face.\nE.g. June 11, 11.21 p.m. ; June 21, 11.20 p.m.\nIV. Vague masses of soft, white substance closely\nresembling cream cheese. E.g. June 5, 6.3 p.m.\nThese seemed occasionally semi-liquid and may\npossibly have been sometimes saliva. Cf. April 30,\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 225\n6.18 p.m.; May 31, 6.40 p.m. ; Jmie 2, 6.14 p.m.;\nJune 24, 10.40 p.m., etc.\nV. Black substance like black thread on the medium's\ntongue. E.g. June 5, 5.46 p.m. A dark fibrous\nsubstance, April 28, 5.52 p.m.\nVI. White pointed objects, hard to the touch and\ngenerally protruding from the medium's mouth.\nOccasionally these objects resembled fingers, and\nrough nail marks were sometimes visible. E.g.\nMay 28, 5.48 p.m. (on this occasion the object\nwas seen sticking out of the mouth through the\nveil) ; June 2, 6.15 p.m. ; June 5, 5.15 p.m. ;\nJune 26, 7.45 p.m.\nVII. Dark coloured membranes and pieces of material\nresembling thick dark skin appearing in the\nmedium's mouth and in her hands. E.g. April 28,\n6.7 p.m. ; June 21, 11.35 p.m. ; June 24, 10.47\np.m. ; June 26, 6.33 p.m. and 7.49 p.m.\nVIII. Roughly drawn flat faces as if sketched in black\nor coloured crayons. E.g. May 21, 7.30 p.m. ;\nJune 21, 11.21 p.m. Cf. also June 16, 9.35 p.m.\nIX. Flat faces more perfectly formed than those\nabove, resembling photographs, and sometimes\n. coloured. E.g. on April 28 the photograph\nshowed a female face surrounded by thick fibrous\nhair. Again on May 10 the photograph showed\na similar face, though this time of a child and\napparently joined to a white hand. Cf. June 26,\n6.37 p.m.\nX. Small white flat hands of varying sizes. E.g.\nApril 26 and May 10, 6.37 p.m.\nXI. A cold breeze. June 26, 6.5 p.m.\nXII. A touch through the curtain. May 25, 5.20 p.m.\nQ\n\fCHAPTER II.\nDETAILED REPORT OF THE SITTINGS.\nSeance I.\nApril 23, 1920.\n[This was a preliminary sitting, its object being to accustom\nthe investigators to the general conditions obtaining at the\nseances of Eva C.

Mrs. S. and W. superintended the control both\nbefore and after the sitting. During the seance W.

Nothing how-\never is visible.\n4.50 p.m. Medium frees her hands, but leaves them\nvisible upon her knees. W. reports small\nspot of luminous substance on medium's\nleft shoulder.

She worked it about\nwith her mouth, lifting, replacing, and shaking it as a\ndog would. Mme B. said that she wanted it to form\ninto a head, but the medium said that it would be a\nhand. Presently she left it on her shoulder, turning her\nhead away. It was then seen to be a small fiat white\nhand as though cut out of paper. It suddenly vanished,\nnot appearing to go into her mouth. The curtain was\nnow partly closed for a moment, but Mrs. S. and W. S.\nmanaged to see, through the slit between the curtains,\nthe hand fall from her right shovilder into her lap. The\ncurtain was now again opened showing the hand lying\non her lap. It now seemed to give a series of three\njumps, and landed eventually upon the medium's left\nshoulder, being apparently moved by something from\nwithin her dress. During these phenomena the medium's\nhands were held by W. S. and W. She now leant\nforward to show it more clearly, and Mrs. S. controlled\nthe left hand which W. had previously held. The flash\nthen went off and a photograph (Plate I.) was taken.\nAlmost immediately afterwards the hand fell into her lap,\nand holding both her controllers' hands she pushed it\nforward close to W. S.'s hand, Avho did not however\nactually touch it. The phenomenon now assumed a\ndifferent appearance, resembling a piece of thick soft\ncrvimpled paper. The mode of its disappearance was not\nremembered, but W. S. says that he thinks it went into\nthe medium's left hand and he did not see it afterwards,\n\f\f\fliXXXIV.] A Series of SitBngs ivith Eva C. 231\nalthough when the hand was examined immediately after-\nwards it was found to be empty. The sitting then closed.\nThe photograph (Plate I.) on being developed showed the\ngreater part of the head of the medium inclined towards\nthe left shoulder. The rest of her body is partially obscured\nby Mme Bisson, whose right hand touches the medium's\nleft, at the same time holding back the curtain on that\nside. On the medium's left shoulder is lying what at\nfirst appears to be the plastic model of a left human\nhand, but which the observers shortly before had reported\nas appearing flat. It is lying palm downwards, the thumb\nnearest the neck, the first and second fingers separated,\nthe second and third being close together and seem-\ningly bent over a ragged piece of light coloured sub-\nstance which hangs from them. The fourth finger, widely\nseparated from the others, is thin and tapering, whilst a\nwhite thread, apparently attached to the third finger,\npasses over the fourth and is attached to a flat oblong\npiece of whitish substance extending from the middle of\nthe back of the hand backwards towards the shoulder.\nSeance IV.\nA^ril 28, 1920. \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\nPresent.

[part\n4.40 p.m. White saliva is seen upon the left shoulder.\nMme B. says that this is the '\nsubstance.'\nWhilst it is being watched it suddenly\ndisappears having been there only ten\nseconds. The medium keeps up an inter-\nmittent squeaking and humming noise which\nMme B. explains as indicating that the\nphenomena are beginning to develop.\nMme B. is asked if there is any objection\nto touching any '\nsubstance '\nwhich may\nappear. Mme B. says that the medium\nherself will allow it to be touched, though\nit should not be seized or snatched. On\nthe other hand the fact of touching it has\nthe effect of immediately stopping further\ndevelopment of the phenomenon. She ad-\nvises that the phenomenon be allowed to\ndevelop, that this occurs gradually and that\nonly at later sittings, after better results\nhave been obtained, should the substance\nbe touched. Mme B. further explains that\nif the medium's hands are in contact, the\nsubstance sometimes appears between the\nthumbs.\n4.50 p.m. W. S. and W. hold medium's hands close\ntogether.\nF.

Mme B.\nwishes however that this should not be\npermitted during the early sittings until\nthe Committee is convinced of the reality\nof the phenomenon.\nMme B. says medium hopes phenomenon will\nshow itself while her hands have been\ncontinually held, which up to now has been\nthe case.\n5.3 p.m. W. Medium draws her hands towards her\nabdomen and squeezes them together as\nif to try and pull something out.\n5.5 p.m. Owing to the length of time of the develop-\nment, Mme B. asks for the light to be\nslightly diminished.\nThe light is just sufficient for W. to see the\ntime by a watch close to the curtains.\n5.10 p.m. W.

Sitting closes.\nRemarks on Seance IV.\nThe phenomena at this seance were particularly striking\nand might have been much more so had the control been\nperfectly satisfactory at the commencement. (See Miss\nNewton's note.) The appearance of the thick, dark, fibrous\nmatter which the camera revealed later surrounding a\nsmall female face was especially interesting although\nunder the circumstances it cannot be regarded as strictly\nevidential.\nOf the three photographs taken at this sitting one only\nis suitable for reproduction (Plate II.). Of the other two\n\f\f\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 237\nthe first is merely a blurred copy of Plate II. although\ntaken from a slightly different angle, and it presents no\nnew feature, whilst the second is also too indistinct to\npermit of a successful reproduction being made. The\nplate gives an enlarged view of Eva's head, which, inclined\ntowards the left shoulder, seems partially to support a\nmass of dark fibrous-looking hair surrounding a small\nphotograph of a laughing female face. The eyes are\nalmost hidden and from the mouth appears to issue a\nragged streamer of white material which lies over the\nblack fibre. From the hairy matter and just on a line\nwith the eyes of the photograph a couple of whisker-like\nprojections protrude beyond the fibrous mass on to the\nleft arm, whilst from the lower portion of the dark\nmatter hangs what looks like a tail or plait of the same\nmaterial terminating in a sort of globular structure.\nIn the second photograph the medium is shewn holding\nthe same phenomenon in her mouth, her teeth apparently\ngripping it from behind and just above the small face.\nA part of the streamer now forms a loop, whilst another\nportion hangs down in a thick cord-like strip.\nNote by Miss Newton.\nOn this occasion, April 28, I searched the medium in\nthe dressing room and was satisfied that she was con-\ncealing nothing on her person or in the tights when she\nput the latter on. But I cannot vouch for anything\nbeyond this, for I realized later, but unfortunately not\nuntil after the seance had begun, that there had been\nopportunities, had the medium wished, for slipping some-\nthing down the neck of the tights, first, while I was\noccupied in sewing up the back of the tights and Mme\nBisson was standing in front of the medium and leaning\nclosely over her shoulder to speak to me, and secondly,\nwhen the overall, which had been brought by Mme\nBisson from the seance room, was held by her between\nme and the medium for at least a minute before the\nmedium put it on. I have no grounds for thinking that\nthe medium availed herself of these opportunities, but I\n\f238 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nrealized that it was only possible for a complete search\nto be made when two searchers were present at the same\ntime.

The\ncameras are prepared and a photograph is\ntaken. Both hands have been controlled\nthroughout.\n6.25 p.m. Mme B. says that she can see the object\nbetween Eva's legs. A round white object\nrises up into Eva's right hand. It is\ntouched by W. S., producing in the medium\na sudden spasm and for a moment the\nobject is lost to view, but it suddenly re-\nappears on her chest. A second photo is\ntaken.

She touches the\nright side of her nose with her thumb and\n. then weaves her hands about as though\nproducing threads.\n[The notes as regards the end of the sitting are incom-\nplete. W.

Before and after the seance the control was under-\ntaken by Mrs. S., Mrs. F. and W. The medium was\ncompletely stripped, the investigators being fully satisfied\nwith the result. During the sitting W. sat on the\nmedium's right holding her right hand and B. sat on her\nleft holding lier left hand.\n4.18 p.m. Seance begins. After hypnotization the pulse\nwas 100 and both strong and regular.\n4.33 p.m. Medium begins to groan and strain. Pulse 124.\n4.40 p.m. A horizontal white blur appears on the left\nshoulder and disappears. Immediately after-\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 241\nwards it reappears, but again vanishes whilst\nunder close observation by B.\n5.5 p.m. Medium announces that something is forming,\nThe curtains are opened from time to time\nbut nothing is seen.\n5.10 p.m. Medium says that it is beginning to form over\nher hands. W. and B. report that her\nhands are wet and slimy, as if moistened\nwith spittle. It was possible for some\nsaliva to have come down over her wrists.\n5.12 p.m. Medium says that something is forming on her\nright shoulder. Curtains are opened and a\nwhite streak, about three inches long, is\nseen on the top of the right shoulder.\n5.17 p.m. Medium says that she feels it on her neck\nand asks for it to be looked at. There is\nhowever nothing visible.\n5.34 p.m. Medium again says that she feels it, but on\nopening the curtains nothing is seen. Mme\nB. asks Mrs. F. to put her hand on\nmedium's left in addition to B.'s. She does\nso for some time.\n5.37 p.m. Medium again opens curtains and leans for-\nward. Nothing is yet visible.\n5.48 p.m. She presses both her hands (still held by W.\nand B.l to her forehead.\n5.51 p.m. Mme B. asks W. to hold his right hand on\nEva's forehead, the former position being\nhowever resumed immediately after.\n6.0 p.m. Medium becomes very excited. She constantly\nopens the curtains and shows her head,\nrecj[uesting Mme B. to call for the pheno-\nmena.\n[During the seances, especially just before the appear-\nance of the phenomena, the medium was accustomed to\nask the observers to call upon the phenomena (or the\n\" intelligences \" producing them) to show themselves.\nThus she would often cry out to Mme Bisson, AppelU,\nJuliette, a-ppelle,\" to which at Mme Bisson's request the\nR\n\f242 A Series of Sittings tvith Eva C. [part\nobservers would reply in chorus, \" Venez, venez, venez !\n\"\netc. These repeated requests seemed on frequent occasions\nto stimulate the medium to fresh efforts and the result\nwas sometimes that the medium was fully \" prise \" and the\nphenomena appeared.]\n6.3 p.m. The curtains are opened and the medium is\nseen with her head bowed and for a short\ntime her forehead rests upon her hands.\n6.4 p.m. Medium says that it is a hand. The curtains\nhave been opened and her head is outside,\nbut nothing is visible.\n6.13 p.m. A white object is seen on medium's chest.\nShe asks W. to put his finger into her\nmouth to see that she has no thread. It\nmoves sideways whilst his finger is there.\nF. suggests that a photograph should be\ntaken, hut Mme B. says, \" Let it develop.\"\nThe curtains are closed, but are opened\nagain a few moments after and the object\nis again seen on the chest, but it is not so\nbright or so definite in shape. It disappears\nwhilst Mrs. S., Mrs. F., W. and B. are\nlooking at it.\n6.19 p.m. Medium seems to strain a good deal and her\nrespiration is very fast.\nNothing further is seen and the sitting closes\nafter a long period of waiting.\nRemarks on Seance VII.\nThis sitting was remarkable for the number of times\nthat the medium seemed to think that the phenomena\nwere present when as a matter of fact nothing was visible\nto the observers. This is qixite a common occurrence\nduring seances with this medium, and it is possible that\noccasionally she sees forms of objects which are invisible\nto the spectators. The white object seen towards the end\nof the sitting was variously described by the observers.\nW., B. and Mrs. S. saj^ that to them it seemed to be a\n\fLXXXIV.] A Sei'ies of Sittings with Eva C. 243\npear-shaped object, about three inches in length. Mrs. F.\nsaid that to her it appeared more the shape of a cigar,\nan opinion which may well be due to her having observed\nit from a different angle of vision from that of the others,\nas she was standing up at the time and was watching the\nphenomenon from above.\nSeance VIII.\nMay 7, 1920.\nPresent. Mme B., F.. W. S., W. and operator.\nControl. Before and after the sitting W. controlled the\nmedium, whilst during the seance W.

After hypnotization the pulse\nis 124 and is regular and strong.\n6.9 p.m. A trickle of saliva is visible on her left\nshoulder.\n6.55 p.m. Pulse 116. Up till now nothing has happened.\nAfter a short period of rather stertorous\nbreathing which occurred at the beginning\nof the sitting the medium remained quite\nquiet. She says that something is there\nand keeps asking Mme B. to call for the\nphenomena.\n7.7 p.m. Medium says that she does not think that\nanything is going to happen.\n7.25 p.m. Seance closes.\nSeance IX.\nMay 10, ,1920.\nPresent.

Mme\nBisson had set up her own camera that she had brought\nfrom Paris and Dr. Woolley had brought his small stereo-\nscopic camera.\nAt the beginning of the sitting Mme Bisson related\nhow after the preceding seance the medium had been\nprise \" in the night by an influence which said that it\nhad been trying to manifest. An \" incarnation \" took\nplace, the \" control \" giving the correct name of a soldier\nwhom Mme B. had nursed in a hospital. He recalled\nhimself to her mind by speaking of a white lock of hair\nover his forehead which she well remembered. According\nto Mme B.'s account this man was quite unknown to\nthe medium.]\n4.20 p.m. Seance begins.\n4.50 p.m. Medium is not yet \" prise \" but she says that\nshe thinks that something is coming.\n4.58 p.m. Medium begins to groan slightly, and the\nstertorous breathing commences. This does\nnot last long however and she soon becomes\nquiet again. Pulse 120.\n5.21 p.m. Small amount of saliva on left side of cheek.\n5.40 p.m. Nothing further happens. Mme B. asks Mrs. S.\nand F. to take the medium's hands for a\nshort time in order to change the \" fluids.\"\nThey lean over and do so for half a minute,\nwhen the medium asks for the former\ncontrollers to take charge again.\n5.55 p.m. Further efforts and complaints on the part\nof the medium. The breathing becomes very\nrapid. She says that \" she feels it and\nthat it hurts her.\"\n6.0 p.m. Medium says that it is there, and putting her\nhead out of the curtains says, \" Look.\"\nNothing is visible.\n6.3 p.m. She says the same thing several times and\nasks to be examined. Again nothing is\nvisible. The curtains are constantly being\nopened and the hands, held since the\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 245\nbeginning of the sitting, remain always\nperfectly visible.\n6.10 p.m. Still nothing has appeared. Mme B. suggests\nthat the controllers should hold the medium's\nwrists leaving her hands free so that the\n\" fluid \" may collect between the finger\ntips. Medium however will not have it\nand insists on fully grasping the controllers'\nhands.\n6.17 p.m. As nothing has yet appeared, the observers\nsucceed in persuading Eva to adopt the\nwrist control. This is tried, but does not\nlast long, and the former method is soon\nresumed.\n6.25 p.m. Medium becomes rather excited. She breathes\nheavily and keeps on repeating, \"It is\nthere, help me ! help me !\n\"\n6.30 p.m. W. took her hand and closely looked at a\nwhite object which appeared on her thumb.\nShe then raised her hands together with\nthe object and put them to her mouth.\n[W. S. reported after the sitting that it\n' looked to him like a piece of stiff white\npaper about 2 inches long by | inch\nbroad, with sharp edges and rectangular\nin shape. W. and Mrs. S. agreed with this\ndescription, whilst B. said that he did not\nsee it at all and F. had only a partial\nglimpse from behind.]\n6.37 p.m. Small hand seen on left shoulder and photo-\ngraph taken. It was afterwards seen on the\nright shoulder and W. S. says that it looked\nas if the fingers were cut off at the knuckles\nor closed. [Mrs. S. reported after the sitting\nthat she saw this phenomenon particularly\nwell, and what struck her most was that\nat first it seemed to her like a kind of will\no' the wisp or flickering light, then suddenly\nforming into a complete hand. W. said\nthat he thought the hand was of normal\n\f246 A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. [part\nproportions. All the observers agree that\nthe hands of the medium were never released\nalthough the fingers were occasionally free.]\n6.55 p.m. Seance closes.\nRemarks on Seance IX.\nFrom the accounts of the observers during this seance\nit is difficult to determine clearh^ of what the phenomenon\nactually consisted. That the hand appears to have de-\nveloped whilst under direct observation seems to be certain\nfrom what Mrs. Salter reported after the sitting, although\nit is hard to understand exactly how this occurred.\nFortunately the photograph proved an excellent one as the\naccompanying enlarged reproduction will show (Plate IV.).\nThe medium is seen seated as usual in her chair, whilst\nher hands are held on either side by the controllers. On\nher left shoulder, towards which her head is inclined, are\nseen the four fingers of a roughly designed left hand\nwhich looks as if it were made of some inflated material.\nThe fingers appear to be jjartially webbed, and a piece\nof white material adheres to the tips of the first and\nsecond. From the root of the fourth finger hangs a\nwhite thread, whilst below, although not in any way\nattached, is another white thread seemingly looped over\na fold in the medium's dress. The back of the hand is\nnot formed, being composed of a white mass of indeter-\nminate shape, and joined to the upper part of it is a\nsmall face of a pleasant-looking child, closely resembling a\nphotograph. The hair is evidently shaded on to the\nforehead and the whole head is surrounded by a sort of\nwhitish hood which is somewhat pointed towards the right-\nhand side. It is interesting to note that the face, probably\nowing to the insufficiency of light, was not noticed by\nany of the observers during the sitting, its existence being\nmade known only by means of the photograph. The\nsecond photograph shows the same phenomenon from a\nslightly different point of view, but there are no additional\ncharacteristics worthy of notice.\n\fPlate IV\n\f\fixxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 247\nSeance X.\nMay 12, 1920.\nPresent.

A\nnoise in the throat commences which is\nfollowed by slight groaning, but subse-\nquently all is quiet again.\n5.55 p.m. Capt. B. moves from the place he occupied\nat the beginning of the seance behind\nMme B. and seats himself to the right and\nslightly behind D.\n6.10 p.m. Hands are now controlled by the wrists only:\nwhen examined the hands are found to be\nempty.\n6.15 p.m. Saliva visible on right shoulder. The little\nfingers of the controllers are now being\ngrasped by the medium.\n6.20 p.m. Medium now appears to be about to be\n\" prise,\" a kind of grumbling respiration begins.\n^6.22 p.m. Medium opens curtains and leaning forward\nshows a mass of scattered-looking liquid on\nher right breast. Mme B. says that so far\nthere is nothing because it is still liquid,\nbut perhaps the phenomena will form from\nit.\n6.25 p.m. Curtains again opened. Some saliva that\nseemed semi-luminous is visible on the right\nside of her breast (?). It quickly runs down\nproducing the effect of quicksilver.\nt6.27 p.m. Medium says that she feels the substance\ncoming from the navel.\n\f248 A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. [part\n6.30 p.m. Mrs. S. reports that on looking closely at the\nmedium's chest she saw a streak of thin\nliquid, first faint but afterwards brighter,\nappear upon the surface of the clothing.\nShe did not see any come from the mouth,\nand it looked as if the substance had oozed\nout through the tights.\n6.40 p.m. Medium has become quite quiet again, nothing\nfurther having happened.\n7.0 p.m. Medium says that she feels nothing and the\nseance is therefore closed.\nSeance XI.\nMay 13, 1920.\nPresent. Mme B., Mrs. S., F., W., B., and the operator.\nControl. Befoie and after the sitting W. and Mrs. S. During\nthe seance W. on the right of medium and B. on the left.\n[At the conclusion of the preceding sitting Mme Bisson\nhad suggested that the controllers should in the future\nleave the medium's hands free, and allow them to remain\nvisibly lying on her knees. The reason for this was that\nit was possible that constant holding of the hands absorbed\nthe \" fluids.\" During the present sitting this advice was\nacted upon when it was thought advisable, and when the\nmedium would herself permit it. It may here be observed\nthat the medium seemed obsessed by the idea that it\nwas necessary that her hands should always be held,\nand even when the controllers, in deference to Mme\nBisson's suggestion, sought to release them from their\nhold, whilst retaining them under visual observation, the\nmedium almost invariably at once seized their hands\nagain. It is important to note in this connexion that\nthe hands were fully under control from the moment\nthat the light was turned off until the eyes got sufficiently\naccustomed to the illumination for them to be able to see\nthe hands clearly. This rule was observed throughout the\nentire series of seances and will wot be mentioned again.]\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 249\n5.21 p.m. Seance begins.\n5.34 p.m. Medium's hands remain free upon her knees.\n5.44 p.m. Medium is still quiet ; her pulse is 116, and\nshe says that she thinks that something is\ncoming.\n5.45 p.m. Saliva falls on left side.\n6.5 p.m. Up till now the hands have remained visible,\nand quietly resting on her knees. She now\nasks for them to be held and begins to\ngroan a little as if she felt that the pheno-\nmena were acting upon her. Mme B. says\nthat she is certainly \" prise.''\n6.10 p.m. Medium opens the curtains, but nothing is\nvisible. The crisis gradually subsides and\nnothing appears.\n6.15 p.m. Slight resumption of the \" travail.'^\n\"\n6.20 p.m. Medium says several times that \"it is going\nto come.\"\n6.21 p.m. At this point unfortunately F. sneezes three\ntimes violently. The medium starts in terror\nand partly comes back to herself. Mme B.\nasks permission to open the curtains, and\nshowing that her hands are empty re-\nhypnotizes the medium. Her pulse is 100 and\nMme B. says that she is sleeping too deeply\nand must be recalled. Holding her hands\n(still held by W. and B.) she recalls her\nto a speaking state. When W. and B.\nhave satisfied themselves that her hands are\nempty she again places them on her knees\nwhere they are perfectly visible and her\nwrists only are held.\n6.35 p.m. The \" travail \" again begins.\n6.38 p.m. The hands which have hitherto been warm\nare reported by W. and B. to have become\ncolder.\n^ This word is used by Mme Bisson to express the physical efforts\nmade by the medium when she is about to produce phenomena, or\napparently expects to produce them. As will be seen from this report,\nthese efforts do not always have any visible result.\n\f250 A Series of Sittings with Eva G.

Mrs. S. and W. controlled before and after, whilst\ndurmg the sittmg W. sat on the right and B. on the left\nof the medium.\nIn arranging the position of the sitters we wished to place\nD. between Mme B. and B., but Mme B. asked that he\n\f252 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nshould be seated behind her with Mrs. S. and Mrs. F. on\neither side, as such an allocation of the sexes was a favourable\ncondition. As the magnesium apparatus was behind Mme B.\nand there was not room for another seat D. took his place\nto her left and only slightly behind her.\n[At the conclusion of the previous sitting Mme Bisson\nhad said that she feared that the fact that in London\nthe medium was always held by strange controllers instead\nof by herself as in Paris might partl}^ account for the\nnon-appearance of the phenomena, as the medium was\naccustomed to her control and lacked confidence without\nit. We therefore suggested that we should try the\nParis conditions, a proposition to which Mme Bisson\nobjected, since she said that success would involve her in\na natural suspicion. She then said that if we returned\nto the conditions usually obtaining at Paris, she should\ninsist on being controlled as well as the medium, and\nwith this end in view she proposed that a tulle curtain\nshould be hung l^etween the medium and the sitters. To\nthis proposition IMr. Feilding objected on the ground that\nsuch a curtain would offer a serious olistacle not only\nto seeing the phenomena, but also to touching them. In\nhopes, therefore, of meeting her views, he suggested an\noverall for Mme Bisson which she promptly accepted, and\nMrs. Feilding therefore made a tulle dress wdth sleeves\nwhich she thought would answer the purpose satisfactorily.\nWhen the finished dress was shown to Mme Bisson, she\ncriticized it saying that it ought to have been more like a\nbag, completely enclosing her head, hands and feet. A\ncompromise was however effected by her pulling up the\nsleeves of her dress, the tulle sleeves being then fastened\ntightly round her arms. The overall was then sewn\ntogether all round under her feet, so that, except for her\nhead and hands, she was more or less completely enclosed\nwithin a bag. Her hair was not examined. Before the\nsitting began she asked permission for W. and B. to\nact as controllers, as she objected to D.'s control on\nthe ground that it was too rigid {trop dur). In this con-\nnexion she also suggested that we should allow the\n\fXXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 253\nphenomena to start and not impede their ever starting\nby an unduly harsh and critical attitude. If the pheno-\nmena were permitted to begin they could be observed,\nand once this was done under good conditions she was\nsure that our mental attitude would change.]\n8.35 p.m. Seance begins. Although it had been intended\nthat Mme B. should hold the medium's\nhands after hypnotizing her, this was not\npossible as the latter insisted on laying her\nhands on W.'s and B.'s.\n9.11 p.m. Up till now the medium has been quite quiet.\nW. managed to release his hand some few-\nmoments before and the medium's hand\nhas been resting on his knee ever since,\nexcept for about two seconds, when it dis-\nappeared behind the curtain. The medium\nnow begins to moan slightly, and a little\nsaliva falls on to the front of her frock.\nD. feels it : it is wet and viscous, but he\nthinks not more so than ordinary saliva\nwould be under similar circumstances.\n9.17 p.m. B. releases his hand, leaving the medium's\nleft hand resting on her knee and perfectly\nvisible.\n9.18 p.m. Both hands still visible on knees. Notwith-\nstanding the overall Mme B. still refuses\nto take the medium's hands, as her own are\nnot enclosed in bags.\n9.37 p.m. Sahva is noticed under the left hand.

This is done, but\nnothing is visible. Immediately she says\n\" C'est fini.''\n7.45 p.m. The sitting closes.\nRemarks on Seance XVII.\nImmediately after the conclusion of the seance the\nobservers were requested to dictate their impressions to F.,\nas owing to the excitement and the difficulty of speaking\namid the general disturbance it was found to be im-\npossible to take sufficient notes whilst the phenomena\nwere in progress. The following are the accounts thus\nreceived.\nW. said that the order of the proceedings was as\nfollows : a whitish object dropped from her mouth into\nher lap. He tried to get his hand or the torch to it,\nbut by bringing her two hands (still held by the con-\ntrollers) together in front of it she prevented him from\ngetting any observation of it. She then put it into her\nmouth with her left hand, and he flashed the torch on to\nit. B. was controlling her left hand at the time and she\nbrought his hand as well as her own up to her mouth.\nThe object, when illuminated by the torch, looked like a\npiece of paper about four by three inches in size and\nfilling her mouth. It seemed to have on it a face roughly\ni\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 259\ndrawn in coloured crayons. (Mrs. S. had independently\nnoted that it seemed to her to have some colour which\nshe thought was red). The photograph was then taken.\nB. said that the first thing he saw was a white thing,\noval in shape, coming from her mouth. Suddenly she\ndropped it into her lap. He did not notice her pick it\nup, but when he looked again at her mouth there was\nsomething in it which looked quite different from what\nhe had first seen. The first object had seemed smooth\nand white, whilst the second was square in form, the\nedges being cut and serrated as if by scissors. There\nwere marks on the surface which seemed to him to have\na reddish tint, although he had not distinguished any\ndesign of a face. From the beginning of the appearance\nof the phenomena he had never let go the hand of the\nmedium for an instant.\nD. said that the first thing he saw was an irregularly\nshaped whitish object, about three and a half by two\ninches broad. He had seen it only for a couple of\nseconds, when he saw it drop on to the medium's lap.\nIt seemed to him to be smaller when it was lying on her\nlap than it was when it was in her mouth. He then\nsaw her put both her hands over it on her lap and raise\nit with them to her mouth. When she lowered them\nagain he saw in her mouth an object like a piece of\npaper bent so that its two edges were held within her\nlips. Cf. Fig. 2. He next saw a piece of white substance\nhangmg from the left side of her mouth and on its\nsurface a roughly drawn face. It appeared as though the\npiece previously bent back had now opened and fallen\nbelow her mouth. The face itself seemed to him to be\nlike Fig. 77 in Mme Bisson's book, though without the\nedges which surrounded the face on that occasion.\nMrs. S. said that she saw a white object apparently\nhanging from the medium's mouth. It fell into her lap\nFig. J.\n\f260 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nand she pulled her hands together over it and raised it\nto her mouth. Mrs. S. said that she did not see in which\nhand the medium held it, but when W. flashed his torch\non it, she distinctly saw some reddish marks, and inferred\nfrom the shape that it was probably a head although she\ncould not distinguish any features. .\nOn developing the plates exposed at this sitting (Plates\nv. and VI.) a surprise awaited the committee. The photo-\ngraphs show the medium lying back in her chair, her head\nbent forward and her chin tightly pressed against her chest.\nBetween her chin and her dress, as if gripped by the\nformer, hangs what appears to be the small photograph\nof a himian face, surrounded by a narrow frame of torn\nand ragged paper. This face, to the astonishment of the\nobservers, in no way resembled that seen by them, being\na much more finished and artistic product than that\nmomentarily revealed by the light cast from the torch.\nIn place of a rough drawing as if rudely sketched in\nchalk, appears what seems to be a photograph of a human\nface which has something calm and even dignified about it.\nThe forehead is not visible, the nose is exceptionally long,\nand a piece of the ragged edge obscures a portion of the\nmouth.\nSeance XVIII.\nMay 23, 1920.\nPresent.

This veil consisted of an ordinary piece of black\ngauze made of silk and cotton fibres, the size of the mesh\nbeing 3 mm. square. Before the seance Mrs. S. sewed\n1;his veil to the medium's tights, an opening being left\nbehind, which was later sewn up with white thread before\nshe put on her outer tunic.

F. and D. both saw the object\nin her movith and to D. the part outside\nthe veil seemed to be shorter than before.\nShe lowered her head towards her hands\nand seemed for a moment to put the object\ninto them, and we again turned the torch\nonto the phenomenon. She then appar-\nently put it back into her mouth, and\nturning her head round as far as she could\nprevented us from seeing the exact way in\n^ D.'s record written at 7.30 p.m. the same evening reads :\n\" Then again\na white object protruded from her mouth inside the veil, and then I saw it\noutside.\n\fLxxxrv.] A Series of Sittings tvith Eva C. 267\nwhich it disappeared. She then asked for\nthe veil to be examined again with the\ntorch, but the object was no longer visible.\n6.2 p.m. Eva asks for the observers to call for the\nreappearance of the phenomenon, but nothing\nis now visible.\n6.3 p.m. Eva says that she feels a pain in her chest\nand keeps plucking at her dress with her\nhands which were still held by D. Her\nbreathing, which had previously been rapid\nand panting, became suddenly inaudible and\nshe remained seated in her chair in an\nabsolutely quiescent condition. Later she\ncame to herself.\n6.15 p.m. The sitting closes.\nAfter the medium had left the cabinet F.\nand D. made a minute examination of the\nveil. In the neighbourhood of the mouth\nit was intact, but at a point about 4 inches\nbelow the neck a small space in the front\nseam which had been imperfectly sewn was\ndetected. This hole was sufficient for the\ninsertion of a forefinger, and under a differ-\nent method of control it might have been\nphysically possible to force a previously\nprepared object in and out as desired. But\nan action such as this would have neces-\nsitated the lifting of the veil (which hung\ndrooping over the seam), the discovery of\nthe opening in the darkness, and the insert-\ntion and withdrawal of the object through\nit, whilst the hands were held the whole\ntime by one of the controllers, who was\nkeenl}?^ alert for the slightest indication of\nany suspicious movement. At the discovery\nof this opening both Mme Bisson and Eva\nappeared much upset, and it was only\nwith the greatest difficulty that the medium\nwas sufficiently calmed for her to proceed\nhome. The photographs on being developed\n\f268 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nwere unfortunately so badly blurred as to\nbe worthless for the purpose of reproduction.\nThe medium had lent so far forward in.\nher chair in order to show the phenomenon\nthat she was quite out of the focus of\nboth cameras. A part of the veil is shown\ntucked into her mouth, and the object which\nhas been described above as like the pistil\nof an arum lily is seen held between the\nmedium's lips. All that part of it which is\nvisible appears to be about the size of a\nsmall finger and the part outside the veil\nappears to be about 1'. inches long. But\nowing to the blurring of the photograph,,\nit is impossible to form an exact estimate.\nRemarks on Seance XXI.\nIn this sitting, which from the evidential point of view\nwas probably one of the most interesting of the whole\nseries, the '\nmaterialized substance '\nappeared to pass\nthrough the veil without in any way injuring the meshes\nin the neighbourhood of the mouth. The fact that an\nopening in the lower seam was discovered after the sitting\nis not in our opinion one which need in any way trouble\nthe serious student. It cannot be denied that it was\nunfortunate that this opening was not noticed before the\nseance. Such mal-observation only indicates too clearly\nthat the most extreme caution is always necessary when\nconducting investigations of this nature. With regard to\nthe actual use of this opening by the medium little need\nbe said. We are quite convinced in our own minds that\nas a matter of fact Eva did not so use it, and even\nassuming that the phenomenon was brought about by\nnormal agency, we are not of opinion that the opening\ncould have been employed for its production. Before\nthe next sitting the veil was doubly sewn round the\ntights with a sewing-machine, thus making it for the\nfuture absolutely secure.\n\fXXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 269\nSeance XXII.\nMay 31, 1920.\nPresent.

The upper lip of the medium appears\nto be much thicker than the lower.\n5.30 p.jTi. Another piece of substance is now visible, about\nthree inches in length and one inch in breadth,\nwhich is lying lengthways in the medium's\nmouth inside the veil.\n5.31 p.m. The substance begins to hang down towards\nthe right of Eva's mouth.\n5.32 p.m. It is again level with the mouth, and the\nmedium says that she cannot get it through\nthe veil, because it is too soft.\n5.40 p.m. Substance is still seen within the veil, although\nit is of a different shape.\n5.45 p.m. Medium calls for the light, and the torch\nshows a part of the veil tucked into the\nmouth.\n5.46 p.m. Substance again visible in the mouth : it is\nslowlj^ withdrawn and as it disappears D.\nsays that he sees a formation like a tiny\nlittle hand (four fingers and thumb) at the\ncorner of the mouth.

Towards\n3.30 the medium appeared to be \" prise,'' but the crisis\npassed off and nothing appeared. At 4.30 I suggested\nthat we should close the sitting, but the medium refused\nsaying that \" ca va venir.\" At about 4.50 another crisis\nset in. Eva began to beg us to call for the phenomena\nto appear, and her breathing again began to be rapid and\n\" throaty.\"' At times she would call out, \"Oh, ina\nJuliette, ma Juliette, il me fera mal,\" and then she would\nutter sighs and groans finally ending in shrieks. As the\npain seemed inclined to pass off, she explained that she\nhad not the courage to allow herself to be gripped, as the\npain was more than she could bear. Some minutes later\nthe pain again came on, and Eva began to utter a series\nof strident cries finally culminating in shrieks as before.\nShe began to struggle violently, twisting her arms about\nso as to make it a matter of some difficulty to keep hold\nof her hands. Then she put her head outside the curtains\nand we saw a longish piece of substance protruding from\nher mouth. It was greyish in colour and seemed to be\nworked about between her lips. When her head again\nappeared the substance was longer and Mme Bisson threw\nthe torch full upon it. It was a strip of waxy material\nabout two and a half inches long and a half inch in\nwidth. Mme B. said that she saw a resemblance to a\nfinger and noticed a nail. I did not see this, and asked\nher to light it again. She did so, and I saw the mark\nto which she had referred. All the medium's efforts now\nseemed to be directed to getting the substance through\nthe veU. In response to her request we all cried in\nchorus, \" Sortez, sortez du voile !\n\" This however proved\nunavailing, and when the phenomenon appeared again, it\nhad changed its appearance. Between her lips there now\nshowed what has been described as a ''\npaqiiet de\n\f276 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nsubstance.'' This was an amorphous mass of material\nexactly resembling a piece of cream cheese. It was being\nworked about in the medium's mouth, and I constantly\nheard the sound of sucking as she pressed and moulded it.\nUnlike cream cheese, when bitten and pressed it did not\nseem to break up, but bent and curled round the teeth\nas chewing gum is said to do. We were enabled to\nobserve the entire process of this strange mastication, as\nMme Bisson kept the torch full upon her mouth for about\n15 seconds whilst we examined it. After a few seconds\nwe saw the substaiace being gradually drawn back into\nthe mouth. Just as one of the corners was being drawn\nin, it seemed to me to break up and form Avhat I can\nonly describe as a tiny hand (fingers and thumb), which\nappeared to wave towards us before it finally vanished.\nNo one else observed this \" hand,\" and I myself attach\nno importance to it, merely remarking on the curious\nshape of the substance and the impression that it made\nupon me at the time. After the substance had vanished\na series of strange appearances began. For example, the\nmedium opened her mouth, and by throwing a beam of\nlight into the cavity we saw her tongue covered with\nthe material in what seemed to me a semi-liquid state.\nNext time we looked in (or was it before ?) ^, we saw\nwhat Mme Bisson described as the \" substance noire.\"\nOn the medium's tongue lay what I should have described\nas a piece of black thread, but to the other sitters it did\nnot seem so plain as this. This soon vanished and the\n\" cream cheese \" appeared again.\nThe photographs were unfortunately again spoilt, as\nthe medium leant so far forward that she was completely\nout of focus. In one a long round white object rather\nlike a limp candle is seen hanging from the left-hand\ncorner of her mouth, and in the other the same object\nis seen hanging from the middle of her mouth, although\nit appears somewhat broader at the part in contact with\nher lips.\n1 The contemporary record shows tliat the black substance came\nbefore the white liquid mass on the tongue.\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. 277\nSeance XXVI.\nJune 7, 1920.\nPresent.

Upon this occasion the door to this room was\ncontinually being banged by the firm's assistants, and on\none occasion during the sitting a telephone bell suddenly\nrang, at which the medium appeared so terrified that\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 279\nshe had to be held in her chair, and was only calmed\nAvith the utmost difficulty by Mme Bisson. These\nnoises had an extremely bad effect on the production\nof the phenomena, as just when Eva was about to\nbe \" prise \", some sudden noise would startle her, and\nthe entire process would have to be begun over again.\nSubsequent sittings were therefore held in the evenings\nafter the firm's assistants had left, an arrangement which\npermitted the seance to be conducted in the most absolute\nsilence, excepting for the conversation of the sitters and\nother movements which formed an integral part of each\nseance.\nSeance XXVIII.\nJune 11, 1920.\nPresent.

She agrees to the proposal, so W.\nenters the cabinet to hypnotize the medium.\nW. returns and reports that Eva is now in a\ndeep stage of hypnosis.\nEva exhibits cataleptic contractions and stiff-\nness of arms and hands : IMme B. asks\nD. to make some passes in order to re-\nlieve it, which he does, and Avhich she also\nmakes in her turn. The contraction soon\nresolves and Eva again gives her hands\nto D.\nHands are again freed, but remain visible.\nEva says that something is hurting her eye,\nbut asks us not to look at present.\nEva leans right forward and strains violently,\nshowing her face at the opening of the\ncurtain and making repeated noises and\nloud retchings.\n11.7 p.m. Eva is at last \"pise\": D. still holds both her\nhands.\n11.15 p.m. W. leaves, having to catch a train.\n11.20 p.m. B. also leaves for the same purpose. His\nplace is taken by Sir George Beilby, and\nthe latter's seat is now occupied by F\nD'A.\n11.21 p.m. The curtains are opened and Mme B. points\nout the phenomenon. It was too dark to\nsee very distinctly, but on Eva's left shoulder,\nseemingly held up by her chin, appeared\nto be lying an object rather like a biscuit\nin shape, being round and with a rough\nsurface. From the hasty glance that the\nsitters got of the object before the curtain\nwas agaiia closed it was impossible to say\ndefinitely whether the phenomenon was inside\nor outside the veil.\n11.24 p.m. Curtains again opened, but nothing is now\nvisible.\n10.20 p.m.\n10.24 p.m.\n10.25 p.m.\n10.40 p.m.\n11.5 p.m.\n11.6 p.m.\n\f282 A Series of Sittings loith Eva C.

It appears to\nbe blackish-grey in colour.\n11.30 p.m. Eva again leans forward, and imder the light\nof the torch the object looks like a mass of\ngrey or white \" plasticine \" between her teeth.\nD. touches it and finds it soft and warm.\n11.34: p.m. The torch is again lighted and a line of white\nstuff is seen along the medium's lips which\nis probably the same substance as before.\n11.35 p.m. Eva leans forward and, opening her mouth,\nshows that there is nothing within.\n11.37 p.m. Medium again leans forward. F. D'A. said\nthat he saw a tuft of white stuff on Eva's\nleft shoulder resembling cotton wool. D.\ndid not see it, and F. and Sir G. Beilby\ncould not have seen it owing to their posi-\ntion. On further examination nothing is\nvisible, and although the medium constantly\ncalls out to be inspected, nothing further is\nseen.

The veil is intact, but the\nlittle white flecks of material are still cling-\ning to the veil and the meshes near the\nmouth seem to be covered with a whitish\nsecretion. F. and D. carefully remove the\npieces of white substance, during which the\nmedium complains of faintness and at last\nalmost falls into Mme B.'s arms. The collected\nmaterial is put into a test-tube and re-\nmoved for examination. After the tights\nhave been taken off D. removes them to\nthe Secretary's room for further examina-\ntion the following morning.\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 283\nRemarks on Seance XXVIII.\nOne of the most interesting features of this seance was\nthe appearance and subsequent collection of flecks of white\nmaterial which were observed on the veil. The micro-\nscopic and chemical examination revealed the fact that\nthese specimens were made of wood-pulp fibres similar\nto those found in cheap papers. (See Appendix I.) Mme\nBisson suggested two sources from which these specks\nmay have been derived. In the first place, she stated\nthat the medium wore certain hair papers and that a\npiece may have been chewed by the medium and thus\nhave been ejected with the \" substance.\" Secondly, she\nsaid that it was possible that Eva had eaten a piece of\ncake paper which had stuck in her teeth and had been\nejected in a similar manner. Specimens of all these\npapers were obtained and submitted to expert analysis\nwith the results set forth in the appendix. When the\nveil, was examined the next day a great many whitish\nstrands of material were found tightly adhering to the\nveil which strongly resembled the fibres found on the\nflecks themselves. In order to examine these strands at\ngreater leisure the veil was removed from the tights and\nput away until a further examination could be made.\nWith regard to the flecks themselves, the evidence is too\nscanty for any deflnite statement. If the medium con-\nstantly chews paper it is remarkable that it seems to be\nso seldom ejected with the materializations. It is, how-\never, noteworthy that Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, during\nhis experiments with this medium, on one occasion dis-\ncovered some white particles on the floor of the cabinet\nafter a seance, which on examination also proved to be\npaper. 1\nWhatever the origin of this paper may have been\n(and Dr. von Schrenck's explanation does not read very\nconvincingly), its appearance is decidedly curious, and\ntogether with the result of the examination of the other\nparticles found during our sittings needs to be carefully\nconsidered when discussing the phenomena under review.\n1 Materialisationsphdnomene, Munchen, 1914, p. 333 (Eng. trans., p. 193).\n\f284 A Series of Sittings with Eva C.

The advantages attached to its removal seemed\nto outweigh any that might be obtained from its con-\ntinued use. It had been suggested also that it should\nbe dispensed Avith on the ground that, although it evi-\ndently did not impede the production of small phenomena\ninside it, it might have a disadvantageous effect on the\nproduction of large ones, and that it would be preferable\nto get these and study them rather than run the risk\nof getting nothing more than we had had up to the\npresent.

At the conclusion of the\nsitting the observers compared notes as to\nwhat they had seen and a certain amount\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 287\nof disagreement was expressed between them.\nOwing to the rapidity with which the\nphenomena followed each other, and the\ndifficulty of simultaneously dictating impre-\nsions. it was found impossible to include\nmany of the details in the contemporary\nnotes. Mrs. Salter, who took the notes for\nthis seance, thereupon requested D. a few\ndays later to write a short account of what\nseems to have occurred, and the following\nis an extract from his reply. It is dated\nJune 19, 1920, and runs as follows :\nWith regard to the seance on June 16th some confusion\nappears to have arisen. Some of the observers seem to have\nseen four phenomena whilst others affirm that they saw only\ntliree. There is also some discrepancy in the accounts given\nas to the \" face \" which was seen upon the substance. The\nfollowing is the account of what I saw (or thought I saw)\ndrawn from the notes that I make after each sitting. In\nthis case I see that they were written down at 11.5 p.m.\nthe same night.\n(11 I first saw a piece of substance, seemingly of a greyish\ncolour, rounded and pointed and about 2| to 2f ins. long.\nThis object was lying loose in the veil towards the medium's\nleft-hand side. In appearance it reminded me strongly of\nthe other pointed pieces of substance that have been noticed\nbefore.\n(2) The next phenomenon that I saw was a flat, yellowy\ngrey object of indeterminate shape lying against the medium's\nright cheek. The torch was fixed on this appearance for so\nshort a time that I had but a fleeting glance.\n(3) The third and last phenomenon that I saw was another\nflat object similar to the last, but round lilie a large, thiir\nBath Oliver biscuit. This was seemingly hanging from the\nmedium's mouth and seemed to me to be of a waxy rather\nthan of a papery nature. Upon the surface there were\ncertain markings which gave the appearance of a \" face\n\"\nvery rudelj^ drawn, or as it seemed to me at the time, indented\non the surface. Whether this was so or not, it is impossible\n\f288 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nto say, as the torch was thro^vn upon it for too short a time\nto make absolutely sure. Mr. Baggally thought he saw a\n\"face\" on the substance which was lying against the cheek\nand net on that which came from the mouth. I naturally\nthought that 1 had transposed this \" face \" from the one to\nthe other in a lapse of memory, but Dr. F.urnier D'Albe\nsays he saw it on the object from tlie mouth in the same way\nas I thought I did. Whether Mr. Baggally saw a face on\nthe cheek phenomenon, or whether he transposed it seems\nrather difficult to determine, unless his observations are re-\ncorded in ycur contemporary notes. [It will be seen that\nthey were not.] Mme Bisson and Dr. Fcurnier D'Albe both\nsay that they saw a fourth phenomenon, namely a bib-like\nappearance under the medium's chin, but neither Mr. Baggally\nnor I apparently saw this.\nSeance XXXII.\nJune 17, 1920.\nPresent.

The sitters\nencourage the medium, urging the \" intelli-\ngence to show itself.\n\u2022^\nIn D.'s account, drawn from notes made at 12.45 a.m. on June 22,\n1920, this phenomenon is described thus :\n\" A white line of foamy\nmatter rising from the middle of the right-hand side of the nose toward\nthe eye. The medium, whilst showing it to us, declared that it was\nmoving upwards by itself, and was supported in this by Mme Bisson.\nNone of the other observers however confirmed this observation.\" From\nthe above it is evident that D. saw the white strip in a different\nposition from that described in the contemporary record. It had\napparently risen to a certain extent, although there seems to be no\nevidence that it had done so by itself as asserted by both the medium\nand Mme Bisson. What probably occurred was that the veil had\nbeen pulled up somewhat, thus giving the impression that the strip,\nwhich showed up strongly on the black mesh, was moving upwards\nby itself.\n\f292 A Series of Sittings with Eva C.

They say\nthat it was nothing but foamy matter\nadhering to the veil exactly opposite the\nnose.\nNote. D.'s record reads thus :\n\" On the medium's\nnose appeared what seemed to some of the observers to\nbe a piece of substance apparently growing out of the tip.\nMessrs. Feilding and Baggally and Mme Bisson apparently\nagree as to this, but H. and D. are of a different opinion.\nThe substance was a foamy mass of saliva adhering to\nthe veil and opposite the tip of the nose. When the veil\nfell over the nose the appearance naturally seemed part\nof the feature, but when the head was projected forwards\nI distinctly saw a space of at least half an inch between\nthe substance and the nose. Even when the veil was\naway from the nose those opposite could not see the\nspace, and this I believe caused the illusion.\"\n11.2 p.m. Eva leans forward again, but nothing is visible.\nThe torch is flashed on her, but still\nnothing is seen.\n10.45 p.m.\n10.53 p.m.\n10.55 p.m.\n10.57 p.m.\n10.59 p.m.\n\fA Series of Siitings with Eva C. 293\nMedhim constantly cries out, saying that it\nhurts her, and leans forward.

The whole process was distinctly visible, my own\neyes I should say being less than six inches from the\nmedium's mouth. Slowly being worked and pulled out of\nthe mouth was what looked like a ragged strip or strips\nof thin semi-transparent membrane of a highly elastic\nnature.

Sitting closed.\nRemarks on Seance XXXIV.\nThe thirty-fourth seance was one of the most remark-\nable of all those held by the Society. From certain\npoints of view some of the phenomena appeared exceed-\ningly suspicious and indicative of fraud or at the least\nof trance-deception. It should be said that the dis-\nappearance of the membrane was consistent with a well-\nknown method of \"vanishing objects\" which is familiar to\nmagicians. These incidents will be found fully discussed\nin the section of the report devoted to fraud (pp. 309-331)\nand we need not recapitulate them here. One point\nhowever seems to be worthy of special attention. It will\nbe remembered that during the seance of Friday, May 21,\n1920, an object was observed hanging from the medium's\nmouth upon which appeared to be drawn the outline of a\nrudely executed face in black chalk. On the photograph\nbeing taken and developed no trace of the roughly drawn\nface appears, but instead there is seen v\/hat looks like a\nsmall photograph of a man. There seem to be two\nexplanations of this curious phenomenon. Either the\nsmall photograph developed from the rough face which\nwas first observed, or it was already at the hack of it, the\nmedium turning it round between the time that the first\nface was observed and the taking of the photograph by\nthe flash. The appearance of the eye-patch in to-day's\nsitting, taken in conjunction with the rude face seen\n\f296 A Series of Sittings ivifh Eva C. [part\ninside the veil, rather leads one to suppose that the latter\nis the more probable alternative. There can be little\ndoubt that the eye patch and the face seen in the veil\nAvere the same object, the first quite naturally falling\ndown into the veil from its former position over the\neye. In this case we must assume that the eye-patch\nwas really the back of the face and what was seen in\nthe veil was the front of the same object. How far\nthese conclusions throw any light on the origin and\nnature of the phenomena it is difficult to say, it being\nmerely sufficient here to indicate briefly the circumstances\nwhich gave rise to such conjectures.\n#\nSeance XXXV.\nJune 23, 1920.\n'\nPresent.

When it was being pulled out\nsideways he noticed that in texture it was semi-trans-\nparent and that its surface seemed to be perforated by\nminute holes the size of pin-pricks. At the conclusion it\nwas brought up to the medium's mouth and vanished, the\nmouth being almost immediately opened in order to show\nthat it had disappeared.\nAnother interesting point in connection with the sitting\nwas the number of times the mediiim declared that the\nphenomena were present, when they were invisible to the\nspectators. Accepting the theory of materialization the\nincident might perhaps be accounted for by assuming tliat\nin their early stages the phenomena are cloudy or semi-\nfluidic, thus being invisible to any but the medium herself.\nDuring the process of development, the guess might be\nhazarded, these cloud-like formations slowly solidify,\nand in time become the dense material objects which\nconstitute the actual phenomena as they are observed\nby the investigators. Experiments conducted on a large\nscale would be necessary before these points could be\nfinally elucidated.\nSeance XXXVII.\nJune 25, 1920.\nPresent.

D'A. sat on the right of the medium and D.\non the left. No veil\n4.22 p.m. Seance begins.\n5.15 p.m. Eva begins to take a series of long breaths :\nshe says that the phenomena are going to\ncome. A period of quiet supervenes.\n6.5 p.m. A cold wind comes strongly out from between\nthe parting of the curtains. A crisis is\ndeveloping and the breeze continues at\nintervals. D. puts his hand down to the\nmedium's feet and notes that although the\nwind cannot be felt, there is a distinct\nsensation of cold.\n6.33 p.m. Eva holds her hands out in front of the\ncurtains and pulls out between them a\ndark-coloured substance. It looks to me\n[i.e. E. who is taking the notes] like a sort\nof dark veil. Suddenly a white thing appeared\nin the middle of the darker stuff and then\nshot out to the tips of the fingers. Mme B.\nturns the white light on to it and it now\nlooks to me like a woolly medallion or\n\" Agnus Dei,\" oval and measuring about\n2 X 1 in. A tag of wool is hanging from\nit, and under the woolly surface is a face\napparently in slight relief. The light being\nkept on, the medium made a quick gesture\ninwards, and it disappeared, the medium's\nhands Ijeing free at this moment.\nAfter the seance D. said that to him the substance\nlooked like a dark grey membrane similar to that observed\non June 24. To him and also to F. D'A., and the\noperator the substance appeared semi-porous and with\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings ivith Eva G. 303\nseveral perforations. F. D\"A. said tliat it was about an\neighth of an inch thick, and D. managed to feel it twice.\nFirst of all at an earlier stage, when it was still invisible,\nhe felt a single tough thread between the medium's haiads.\nThen at a later stage, when he touched it, it felt like a\nmembrane, but dry, rather like thin parchment.\nD.'s account, taken from notes made immediately after\nthe sitting and written out two days later, read as\nfollows :\nThe medium began to work her hands about outside\nthe curtain as if drawing something from the fingers.\nI passed my own finger through the opening between hers\nand felt what seemed like a strong, tough, elastic thread.\nOn my coming in contact with it the medium shuddered\nand drew back, the hands, however, remaining in full\nview. The drawing of the fingers now continued and I\nthen saw a greyish thread between them Avhich, when\nworked about, soon assumed the shape of an irregular\npiece of membrane. I then seemed to see what I can\nonly describe as a white flash, when the medium opened\nher hands and showed a most curious object lying between\nthem. It was something like a medallion in shape, about\n2| ins. by 1 inch in size, and as I saw it, it seemed\nmade of thick skin, dark grey in colour. On the surface\nwere two white patches, one as big as a penny, and the\nother smaller, and more oval in appearance. F. says\nthat he saw a small full face on the under surface, but\nI did not see this. We had the torch full on it till the\nmedium drew back complaining, and then it suddenly\nvanished.\n6.37 p.m. D. and F. D A. say that a white object is\nhanging from the medium's mouth. It is\nin shape rather like an icicle, about four\ninches in length and with more than one\ntag giving the appearance of a sort of\nbeard. The cameras are prepared and a\nphoto is taken. After the flash the torch\nis turned on and the object is examined.\n. It looks to me {i.e. F.) like a triangular\n\f304 A Series of Sittings with Eva G. [part\npiece of medical bandage with a tag hanging\nfrom it and attached to the medium's\nupper lip. D. saw it closer and says that\nit showed a coloured face in semi-profile\nupon it. The cheeks were pink, the eyes\nblue and the general background grey.\nF. D'A. saw only a coloured pattern, but\ndid not distinguish a face. Eva shrinks\nback in her chair. She requests an\nimmediate mouth control, which is refused\nin the hope of further development.\nD.'s account reads :\nOn opening the curtains again I saw hanging from the\nmedium's mouth two or three threads, from one of which\na whitish blob was suspended, giving a grotesque appear-\nance. A photo was taken.\nWhen I looked again, I saw a roundish-shaped object\nhanging from the medium's mouth. Torch was turned\non to it, and I saw a piece of greyish-white membrane,\nupon which was a female face. It reminded me of\nFig. 7 in Geley's book and was in colours. The cheeks\nwere pinkish red, the eyes bluish and the other features\ndrawn in dark grey or black. The face was flat and\nabout two inches by one and a quarter in size. After\nthe torch had been turned off the object vanished.\n7.45 p.m. Eva shows something within her mouth which\nshe says is a finger. The torch was not\nflashed upon it, and so it could not be seen\ndistinctly. It resembled a curved piece of\nwhite substance like a candle. The cameras\nwere again prepared and a photo was\ntaken. The object then vanished.\n7.49 p.m. A membrane appears between the medium's\nfingers whilst D. is holding her hands.\nHer fingers are quite outside the cabinet\nand the light of the torch is thrown upon\nthe material. It suddenly vanished. D.\nwas holding the medium's hands open, the\nfour fingers being between his thumb and\n\fIXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 305\nfingers, thus leaving the ends of the medium's\nfingers free. The membrane disappeared\nsuddenly whilst the hands were still being\nheld, a slight upward jerk being given by\nthe medium at the moment of the dis-\nappearance, whilst the substance was being\nplayed about with. Whilst this was going\non F. D'A. felt Eva's lips, as she had\nturned towards him for the purpose. He\nfelt nothing unusual. Mme B. says that\nthe force is extremely good and that some-\nthing ought to be able to show itself at\nthe curtain. The torch, however, has some-\nwhat impeded its development.\nD.'s account reads :\n\" The medium asked me to hold her hands, which I did,\nmy fingers being next to her palms and my thumbs on\nthe top of her hands. This allowed her fingers free play,\nand soon they began to move as before with a drawing\nmotion. A greyish thread now began to be drawn out\nfrom the fingers, and, as before, it soon formed into a\nmembrane. I touched it. It felt like a piece of soft,\nsmooth rubber. The medium half put it into my hands,\nwhilst we observed it with the torch. Whilst she was\nworking it about, she asked Dr. Fournier D'Albe to\nexamine her mouth. This he did without the torch, and\ntells me that he felt all round the medium's lips, but did\nnot come into contact with a thread of any kind. Soon\nafter, whilst I was still holding the hands, the membrane\nvanished with an upward jerk, the medium immediately\n-showing both hands empty, saying, '\nC'est fini.' The seance\nthen closed.\"\n7.57 p.m. In order to produce an effect of confidence\nin the medium the torch is put away\naltogether and we let her hear us do it,\nhoping for bigger phenomena.\n7.58 p.m. Eva groans and gives a sudden shudder\nsaying, \" it's gone !\n\" Seance closes.\nX\n\f306 A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. [fart\nRemarks on Seance XXXVIII.\nThis seance was undoubtedly the most mterestmg of all\nthose held under the auspices of the Society. In the\nvariety and character of the phenomena the sitting was\neasily the most valuable from the evidential point of view,\nalthough it was but poor when considered in comparison\nwith those formerly held in Munich and Paris. The cold\nbreeze, which was felt by all present and which is so\ncommon an accompaniment of mecliumistic phenomena, was\nnoticed for the first and only time, although it had been\nseveral times recorded by Mme Bisson and the previous\ninvestigators. The sudden disappearance of the membrane\nfrom between the fingers whilst the hands were being\nheld was an exceptionally good piece of evidence for the\nsupernormal character of the phenomena, although it\nmight have been conceivably accomplished by normal\nmeans, as discussed elsewhere. Unfortunately, the pheno-\nmena were far too small and fragmentary to furnish any\nconnected story as to their origin and development.\nThe two photographs when developed and printed\nshowed almost precisely what the observers had noticed,\nexcept that in the first photograph the face is shown\nquite clearly, whereas the sitters only saw the face after the\nphotograph had been taken (Plate VII.). The medium is\nshown leaning back in her chair, whilst her two hands are\ntightly grasping the parted curtains of the cabinet. Some\nstray locks of hair have fallen over her face, whilst from\nher mouth hangs what looks like a small flat face seen\nin semi-profile. Below is a sort of oval flap, or what\nDr. Geley calls U7i corps emhryonnaire, which is about the\nsame size as the head and in which a fold is clearly\ndiscernible. At the right edge of the flap and seemingly\nhanging down from a part of the face is a strip of dark\nsubstance which descends to about two inches below the\nneck of the tights.\nThe second photograph is unfortunately blurred and is\ntherefore not suitable for reproduction. It shows the\nmedium leaning forward slightly, whilst from her chin is\napparently protruding a white finger-like object, which is\n\fPlate VII.\n\f\fLxxxn'.] A Series of Sittings vnth Eva C. 307\nmuch bent, so that the jooi'tion which extends from about\none and a half mches from the tip is pointing downwards\ntowards the groimd.

Dingwall.\nThere have been few phenomena in the history of\npsychical research which have been more prodvictive of\nfraud than materiahzations. In the early days, when\nfull form \" phantoms \" were common in the seance rooms,\nfraud must have been extensive^ employed, as it is still\nto-day in many parts of the United States. Test\nconditions were little understood, and the necessity of a\nstringent control scarcely realized. Conditions are, how-\never, rapidly changing, not only in the general character\nof the materializations, but also in the methods of con-\ntrolling the mediums. The question of fraud, however,\nstill remains a thorny obstacle in the path of any elaborate\nscientific investigation. Scientific men are not usually\nacquainted with deceptive psychology and the scope of\nmisdirection, whilst their training in no way fits them\nto detect suspicious movements or manipulations. In\nthis connexion the phenomena of materialization offer a\nmore than usually complicated field in which the senses\nare peculiarly liable to illusions of every kind.\nAmongst those materializing mediums who have most\nunreservedly offered themselves for scientific investigation,\nEva C. is a distinguished example. I shall not attempt\nto discuss here the difficulties associated with the experi-\nments at the Villa Carmen and the identity of Bien-Boa.\nThe present series of sittings were concerned solely with\nthe later phase of Eva's mediumship, and although the\nBien-Boa case has certain points of affinity with Eva's\nlater efforts, this is not the place to discuss them. The\n309\n\f310 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\ninvestigation of Eva C.'s alleged mediumistic power can\nbe divided naturally into four main groups :\n(a) The investigations of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing.\n{h) The personal observations of her protectress, Mme\nJuliette Alexandre-Bisson.\n(c) The investigations of Dr. Geley.\n{d) The investigation of the English Society for Psychical\nEesearch.\nIn order to gauge accurately the true weight of the\nhypothesis that fraud only is at work, 1 jiropose to deal\nwith these four series of observations in order, detailing\npoints of interest as they occur, and trying to indicate the\nextraordinary difficulties which confront this hypothesis.\nBefore commencing, however, it is necessary to consider\none objection which will immediately be raised. That\nquestion is of course concerning the position of Mme\nBisson. However distasteful such a subject may be,\nit seems quite obvious that it must be met, and Mme\nBisson herself would be the first to recognize it. In the\nfirst place, it is well to state clearly the impression that\nMme Bisson made upon the S.P.R. Committee and upon\nthose of the members who were privileged to meet her.\nDeeply interested in psychic phenomena, she appeared to\nus a woman of high intellectual attainments and j)ossessed\nAvith a genuine love of scientific inquiry. A passionate\nbeliever in the genuine character of Eva's mediumship,\nher Gallic temperament appeared at times to overrule her\nscientific prudence, especially when she thought that scepti-\ncism had reached its limits. It need scarcely be said\nthat not a shred or particle of evidence exists which\nimplicates Mme Bisson in any way Avhatsoever with the\nalleged fraudulent aspect of the phenomena of Eva C.\nDuring the preceding investigations Mme Bisson had\nattended the sittings, not only as a privileged observer,\nbut as the sole director of the proceedings.\nGenerally speaking she encourages and supports Eva\nduring the sittings, the medium being so dependent on\nher that she refuses to sit unless her protectress is\npresent. Whatever we may think of these conditions,\nit seemed clear to the Committee that no sittings would\n\fxxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 311\nhave been possible unless jMme Bisson had been per-\nmitted to take her accustomed place. Such indeed\nwere the actual conditions which were accepted hy the\nSociety before the arrival of Mme Bisson and the medium\nin this country. It -will be seen that owing to some\nsuggestions offered by Mme Bisson herself, the Committee\ninstituted for a time a \"partial control of her. The\nSociety was faced with the dilemma of either having no\ninvestigation at all, or of accepting those conditions Avhich\nhad been customary with previous investigators. Of the\ntwo alternatives they chose the latter.\nIt may be thought by some that such conditions were\nxinfortunate and that certainty is never likely to be\nattained as long as either (a) Mme Bisson remains an\nobserver, or (6) she does not subject herself to that\ndegree of control that may be deemed to be necessary.\nWhatever may be the truth of this point of view, it\nmust be understood that I am here dealing primarily\n\"with the case of the medium herself.\nAs regards any part which those unacquainted with\nMme Bisson may suppose her to play, I can only record\nthat although she was not subjected to the same rigorous\ncontrol as was the medium, nothing ever arose to give\ngrounds for the slightest susj)icion, or for the supposition\nthat her role was otherwise than that of an independent\nobserver deeply interested in the phenomena and sacrificing\njnuch time, patience, and money in the study of them.\nThe Investigations of Baron von Schrenck-Notzing.\nIn the course of his researches Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing became entirely convinced as to the reality of\nEva's phenomena. The objectivity of the materializations\nwas assured by the use of photographic apparatus, and\naccording to the Baron himself fraud ^ was prevented\nthrough the stringent control he exercised. Indeed, this\n^ Although strictly speaking fraud cannot be attributed to persons\nin trance, I use the word for the sake of convenience as its meaning is\ngenerally understood. The reality of Eva's hypnotic state is, I think,\n:not generally questioned.\n\f312 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nis in reality his main argument. Because he had never\nfound anything suspicious on the medium's person during\nthe searching, \" the honesty of the medium is therefore\nnot a probability, but a certainty placed beyond all\nquestion \" {Materialisations-Phdnomene, p. 495, Eng. Trans.,\np. 275). We must now endeavour to ascertain how far\nsuch a statement is true. The point in which I\nam personally interested is as to the extent of Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing's knowledge of those methods commonly\nused by magicians (especially handcuff performers) ior\nconcealing their apparatus when in a nude condition.\nWith all due deference to Baron von Schrenck's scientific\nattainments, I cannot help asking myself whether he is\ncapable of detecting fraudulent manipulations during the\ncontrol before and after the seances. As far as I know,\nno one fully acquainted with trick methods has ever\nassisted at this all-important control, for the simple\nreason that experts in this branch of magic are rarely\nmedical men or women. The advantage of being a\nfemale medium therefore is obvious and cannot be wholly\nignored.^ During many of the sittings Dr. von Sclirenck-\nNotzing admits that the medium used her hands in order\nto arrange the phenomena and to fix them up so that\nthey could be easily observed (Eng. Trans., p. 265).\nIndeed, he even surmises that these phenomena, which\naccording to his hypothesis were formed ideoplastically\nout of the medium's own organism, have been affixed to\nthe walls and curtains of the cabinet by means of pins\n(p. 263) ! Thus on August 21, 1912, Dr. A. drew his\nattention to a whole series of pin holes on the left-hand\ncurtain and also at the back of the cabinet. Dr. von Schrenck\nis at pains to explain the existence of these pin holes,\nwhich corresponded roughly to the position of the materiali-\nzations. He points out that his photographer had pinned\na piece of newspaper to the curtain when focusing the\ncameras and that this might account for the holes. He\nalso finds refuge in his former theory that \" the con-\n1 This objection naturally applies to all investigations (our own included)\nwhere the control before and after the seances is exercised by persons\nunacquainted with the principles of misdirection.\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 313\nditions under which the sittings took place excluded the\nintroduction of pictures and other objects.\" Now the\nfirst thing that must strike even the most casual reader\nis that Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing did not discover the pin\nholes. These were found hy a visitor, Dr. A., who was\ncompelled to point them out to the Baron. If, therefore.\nDr. von Schrenck had not even succeeded in discovering\n\" groups of pin holes in pairs,\" just where materializations\nhad appeared and inside the cabinet, which he could have\nexamined at leisure, is it too much to suppose that he\nfailed to discover the pins, assuming that they had been\nsurreptitiously introduced ? I confess that I do not\nfind it difficult to assume that the pins were introduced\nby Eva before the seance and taken away again after it\nwas over. Granting that this was possible, is it too far-\nfetched a theory to suppose that certain of the materiali-\nzations were brought in and taken out by precisely those\ndeceptive movements which would be necessary under the\ncircumstances 1 The methods for concealing such objects\nare manifold and it would be impossible to detail them\nhere. But it may be understood that if it is a fact\nthat nothing is concealed where it might be easily dis-\ncovered, as, for example, under the arms, some other\nhiding place would have to be employed. A gynaeco-\nlogical and rectal examination would reveal any foreign\nbody thus concealed, but an insistence on such an\nexamination could not of course be too often made. Nor\nwould there be any need for such a control if the tights\nwere always sound and free from holes. At the seances\nheld by the Society several holes were found in the\ntights, one as big as a threepenny piece and in the\nregion of the genitals. Whether these were due to the\nwicker work of the chair tearing the material or to other\nreasons it is difficult to say, the Committee favouring\nstrongly the former explanation. When discovered (May\n23, 1920) they were sewn up with white thread, and no\nfurther ones appeared. The point, however, to be insisted\non, is how far this careful inspection and repair of the\ntights were carried on by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing and\nthe other investigators. Once the tights are sound.\n\f31-4 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\ncontrol is comparatively simple, and nothing could in any\nway be found objectionable by the medium even in its\nmost severe application.\nOn August 30, 1912, during the examination of the\ncabinet after the seance some small white particles, the\nlargest of which was the size of a pea, were found on\nthe floor, and inside tlie tights fine dust was discovered\nadhering to the material. On examination these particles\nwere found to consist of paper, the existence of which\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing explains by assuming that a\nsitter had brought them in and left them in the cabinet,\nas they gave the impression of having been crushed by\na shoe. He explains the dust in the tights (which proved\nto be composed of wood fibre) by suggesting that the\ngarment had fallen on the floor and gathered some dust.\nAs far as I know this was the only occasion when\npaper, or a product closely resembling paper, was dis-\ncovered by Dr. von iSchrenck-Notzing.\nAs will be seen from the detailed report, the S.P.R.\nCommittee found paper on no less than four separate\noccasions,^ and on at least one of these it was perfectly\nclear that the paper came from the medium's mouth.\nThe explanation given by Mme Bisson for this discovery\nis that Eva is accustomed to wear hair papers and that\na piece may have fallen into her moiith and stuck in her\nteeth. Another theory which Mme Bisson brought\nforward was that a piece of cake paper had likewise got\nstuck in the medium's teeth and had been ejected in the\ncourse of the materializing process. Whatever we may\nthiiik of these theories, it seems quite clear that there\nare some groimds for suspecting the genuine character\nof the phenomena. I shall not attempt to examine\nafresh the case of the Miroir portraits. Mrs. Salter has\nalready given a clear account of the circumstances in the\nProceedings of July, 1914, and it woidd serve no useful\npurpose to recapitulate them here. In the case of the\nhead of President Wilson, Dr. von Schrenck admits that\nthe materialization shows unmistakable signs of folding,\nand he has successfully cut out the picture and folded it\n1 On May 23, June 4, June 7 and June 11.\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 315\nlip, thus demonstrating that the creases fit accurately\n(Eng. Trans., p. 220).\nIt would be useless to criticize this incident without\nhaving seen exactly Avhat took place, and reading Mme\nBisson's account of the same occurrence will not be likely\nto assist us in coming to any satisfactory conclusion.\nThat a certain number of the materializations are derived\nin some way from the Miroir portraits seems to be an\nimdoubted fact, and this, coupled Avith the fact that the\nletters miro appeared on a part of one of the materiali-\nzations, cannot fail to arouse suspicion which it is certainly\nvery hard to allay.\n^\nBefore passing on to the experiments of Mme Bisson\nit seems necessary to discuss briefly one more incident\nwhich has been raised against the accurate observation\nof Dr. von Schrenck. On August 11, 1911, May 25,\n1912, and August 9, 1912, there is some reason to suppose\nthat Eva occasionally pretended \" that her hands were\nlying visible before her, when as a matter of fact one\nof them at least was performing functions connected with\nthe arrangement of the phenomena. I shall say nothing\nabout the ethics of these manipulations beyond stating\nthat they prove very little one way or the other. The\nimportant point to note is that on August 11, 1911,\nDr. von Schrenck apparently failed to note them until the\nphotographs gave the true state of affairs. A similar\nincident seems to have occurred in a sitting with another\nmedium (see M. von Kemnitz, Moderne Mediumforschimg,\nMiinchen, 1914, p. 56), and it is quite possible that it\noccurred on other occasions when we are told that the\nmedium's hands remained visibly lying on her knees. These\nfacts are unfortunate, and it appears to me necessar}^ to\ntake Dr. von Schrenck's testimony as to what he has\nobserved with a certain amount of reserve.\nIt ought perhaps to be pointed out that photographic enlargements\nof these heads prove conclusively that they are not sheets of paper\nactually torn from Le Miroir : the process markings, which ought to\nbe clearly visible if the heads had been illustrations from Le Miroir,\nare never visible at all, and there are other objections which have been\nfully dealt with by Dr. von Schrenck in his Der Kampf um die\n3Iaterialisationsphdnomene, pp. 74-120.\n\f316 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nIt ought, however, to be pointed out to certain\ntriumphant sceptics that to assume that the whole of the\nphenomena recorded by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing are\nfraudulent requires a series of hypotheses, which to my\nmind are almost as difficult of acceptance as the supposi-\ntion that folded packets containing botched portraits of\ncelebrities are manufactured through the teleplastic forces\nof Eva C.\nThe Observations of Mme Bisson.\nIn considering the testimony of Mme Bisson the sceptic\nfinds himself in considerable difficulty. He has either to\nstate boldly his opinion that the phenomena are fraudulent\nand that Mme Bisson's observations are worthless, or he\nhas to consider seriously whether the hypothesis of fraud\ncould jjossibly account for the occurrences that Mme\nBisson says that she has studied when alone with the\nmedium.^\nNow there is not one particle of evidence which he\ncan adduce against Mme Bisson, this lady being held in\nthe highest esteem by all who know her. There is there-\nfore a dead weight of probability against him and he has\nto fall back upon the extraordinary, although conceivable\npossibility, that Mme Bisson is herself deceived or halluci-\nnated or both. This solution is possibly easy to those\nwho are unacquainted with Mme Bisson, and who know\nlittle about deception and less about hallucination, but to\nothers the problem is not so simple.\nThe Investigations of Dr. Geley.\nThe results attained by Dr. Geley have been sum-\nmarized by him in a pamphlet published in Paris in 1918,\nand reprinted from the Bulletin of the Institut General\nPsychologique, Nos. 1-3, 1918.2 ^he full reports of Dr.\n1 I refer principally to such phenomena as those occurring for example\non September 10, 1911, October 31, 1911, or December 8 and 17, 1911.\n(See pp. 64-68; 70-71; 84-85; in Mme Bisson's book and p. 136 of\nthe Eng. Trans, of Dr. von Sohrenck's volume.)\n3 Cf. also Dr. Geley's From the Unconscious to the Conscious (London,\n1920), pp. 51 seq.\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 317\nGeley's experiments have not been published and it is\ntherefore impossible to discviss them. The same objec-\ntions apply to him as to Dr. von Schreuck-Notzing,\ninasmuch as his control before and after the seances\nmay conceivably have been favilty. Notwithstanding, Dr.\nGeley declares that he does not say merely that \" il 7i y\na pas eu de fraude,\" but \" il n'y avait jms possibilite de\nframie,'' and the data are not sufficient for us to be able\neven to criticize him. Certainly some of the phenomena\nobserved appear to me to be absolutely inexphcable on\nany theory of fraud. The following phenomenon, for\nexample, is prima facie quite inexplicable except by some\nsupernormal mediumistic faculty on the part of Eva C.\n\" Une tete apparait tout a coup, a environ 75 centi-\nmetres de la tete d'Eva, au-dessus d'elle et a sa\ndroite. C'est une tete d'homme, de dimension\nnormale, bien formee, avec ses reliefs habituels. Le\nsommet du crane et le front sont parfaitement\nmaterialises. Le front est large et haut ; les cheveux\ntallies en brosse et abondants, chatains ou noirs.\nAu-dessous des arcades sourcillieres, les contours\ns'estompent ; on ne voit bien que le front et le crane.\nLa tete se derobe un instant derriere le rideau ;\npuis reparait dans les memes conditions ; mais la\nface, incompletement materialisee, est masquee par un\nrideau de substance blanche. J'avance la main ;\nje passe mes doigts a travers les cheveux touffus et\nje palpe les os du crane, . . . Un instant apres, tout\navait disparu.\" (P. 13.)\nL^nfortunately Dr. Geley does not give the necessary\ndetails for us to be able to understand the precise con-\nditions which were obtaining when the above phenomenon\ntook place. It is clear that the head was not perfectly\nformed except in its upper part, and this Dr. Geley was\nable to feel and even press with his fingers. How this\nis to be accounted for on the hypothesis of fraud I do\nnot know, unless we assume that the observers are in-\ncapable of any accurate observation at all. Dr. Geley's\nfull reports will be awaited with interest, especially in\n\f318 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nview of the fact that the phenomena remarked by him\nappear to have been of a slightly different order from\nthose previously recorded by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing.\nThe Investigation of the English Society eoe -\nPsychical Research.\nAt the invitation of the Committee which had been\nformed to investigate the phenomena of Eva C, I was\npermitted to attend twenty-nine out of the forty seances\nheld by the Society. Of these sittings eight only were\npositive, which gave me some opportunity to study the\nphenomena at close quarters, and thus to try to solve the\nvexed question of fraud and its application, if any, in\nthe case of this medium. It will be seen from the\ndetailed reports that on many occasions I was controlling\none or both hands of the medium throughout the sitting,\nthis permitting me to examine carefully the phenomena\nwhich were produced without their aid or intervention.\nThese occurrences I now propose to examine simply from\nthe point of view of a practical \" inagician \" or illusionist,\nand I shall endeavour to show exactly how far these effects\nmight be produced through normal agency. The success\nor otherwise of this attempt may perhaps be found of\nuse in gauging the possibility or impossibility of fraudulent\nmanipulations.\nThere are two assumptions that must, I think, be made\nif we wish to hold the opinion that the phenomena of\nEva C. are fraudulently produced. They are (a) that\nthe medium possesses the power of regurgitation or\nrumination,^ and {b) that she secretes a peculiarly thick,\nwhite saliva.\nThere is, as far as I can see, no escape from accepting\nboth of these preliminary hypotheses. Regurgitation or\n^ An easier method of concealing objects is sometimes found in the\nEast. Thus in the Medical Press and Circular for 1889, Vol. II.,\np. 189, I read that amongst Indian criminals an ingenious method is\nused for hiding articles. A pouch-like recess is formed at the base of\nthe epiglottis. This is formed by means of a bullet, |^ in. in diameter,\nwhich is allowed to slide down and remain for varying periods. This\noperation is repeated many times daily until the pouch is formed. In\nthis way articles are secreted, defying all search, the pouch interfering.\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 319\nmerycism, as it is often called, is not common, but it is\noccasionally found in hysterical subjects, and is sometimes\nused for purposes of public exhibition. Thus Dr. Gulat-\nWellenburg has brought forward the case of Herman Wittich\nwho swallows frogs and fish, and when experimented upon\nproduced the same effects with rolls of chiffon and rubber\ngloves. Similar^ a Belgian used to perform these tricks\nwith balls of paper, and indeed such methods are well\nknown amongst strolling performers of a certain kind.\nDr. von Schrenck denies that Eva is a ruminant, in spite\nof some amount of evidence that points in that direction.\nAccording to his own conclusions regurgitation would not\naccount for manj- of the phenomena that he himself has\nobserved, as these did not appear to have originated in\nthe medium's mouth. During the S.P.R. investigation,\nhowever\u2014so far, at least, as concerns those sittings at\nwhich I was myself present\u2014it seemed to me that no evidence\nwas obtained excluding the hypothesis that every materiali-\nzation originated thus, and on no single occasion did we\nhave the opportunity of observing the large phenomena\ndescribed by other investigators.\nAssuming therefore the possibility of regurgitation, let\nus examine some of the phenomena, presupposing that\nthey are fraudulently produced. In this connexion I\nshall only touch upon those sittings at which I was\nmyself present, since it is obvious that I can usefully\ndiscuss only those phenomena which I myself witnessed.\nSea^ice XVII., May 21, 1920.^\nIn this case we must assume that the materialization\nwas previously prepared on a piece of thin, papery material,\nwith neither speech nor respiration. In Calcutta upwards of twenty\nprisoners were found to possess these pouches, in which jewels, money,\netc., can be easily secreted.\nOn June 28, 1920, the medium at her own request was taken to a\nlaryngologist for the purposes of examination, but the lamp connected\nwith the laryngoscope refused to work and the examination had to b&\nabandoned. The medium was, however, perfectly willing for the inspec-\ntion to be made and even demanded it. (See Appendix IT.)\n1 Before considering these remarks the reader is asked to turn back\nto the detailed report, and refresh his memory as to the phenomena\nthemselves and the order of their appearance.\n\f320 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nfolded up and swallowed. On the one side, when opened\nout, was a roughly drawn face and on the other side a\nsmall photograph was stuck, the rough edges of the paper\nforming a sort of frame round the head. Once got into\nthe mouth by regurgitation, the paper is unfolded through\nthe instrumentality of the tongue and teeth, and when\nbent in its median fold is allowed to protrude from the\nmouth, giving the appearance as noted at 7.30 p.m.\nThe front flap now falls over and the rough face becomes\nvisible. In this case we must assume that it has been\nunfolded the wrong way, so that what is seen is the back\nof the photo. Whilst the curtains are closed and the\ncameras prepared (a period in this case of seven minutes),\nthe medium turns round the paper and when the photo\nis taken it of course reveals a small photograph surrounded\nby its paper frame.\nSeaijce XXI., May 28, 1920. At this sitting occurred\nthe very remarkable phenomenon of a pointed waxy object\nwhich waiS first observed inside and then outside the veil.\nAs this occurrence might be supposed to be clear proof\nof something supernormal, it may be well if we consider\nit at some length.\nNow, supposing that the phenomena are genuine, have\nwe any reason to imagine that a \" materialized \" substance,\nhaving originated in the mouth, could come through the\nmeshes of a closely woven veil without injuring the\nstrands ? It is quite possible, of course, that it might\nissue forth in liquid or gaseous form and then solidify\noutside the veil, but, having once materialized inside, it\nseems quite unreasonable to suppose that it would then\npass through. The advantage of a veil is therefore\nobvious, and as we were assured that the materializations\noriginated from other parts of the medium's body we\nnaturally wished to see such phenomena for ourselves.\nBut nothing of the kind ever happened. Phenomena\nshowed themselves in the medium's mouth and nowhere\nelse, and except on one occasion never came through the\nveil. This occasion was on May 28, and it is this pheno-\nmenon that we are about to examine.\nA pointed, waxy object, hard to the touch, was seen\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 321\nsticking out of her mouth through the veil which had\nbeen drawn into the cavity. How are we to account for\nthis phenomenon from the point of view of fraud ?\nNow I may say at once that I do not propose to lay the\nslightest stress upon the hole in the veil which was found\nat the conclusion of the sitting. My reasons for this\nwill be found in the notes and remarks at the end of the\ndetailed report. What we have to try and discover is\nsome method by which the same effect could be produced\nby normal means. Such a solution does not in the\nleast imply that the method was actually employed on\nthis occasion. Its sole value lies in the doubt that it\ncasts on the veil as a satisfactory method of obtaining an\ninfallible proof of the genuine character of certain pheno-\nmena.\nIt seems at first quite clear that the easiest way to\nproduce such a phenomenon would be to pass the material\nthrough the meshes of the veil in a liquid state, and then\nto solidify it outside. Supposing therefore that the\nmedium had a piece of wax which would easily melt if\nheld in the mouth but would soon solidify if brought into\ncontact with the air, it seems possible that such a pheno-\nmenon might be produced. The wax might be contained\nin some insoluble receptacle and then swallowed. If it\nwere brought up by regurgitation and the veil were drawn\ninto the mouth, the container might be broken, the wax\nmelted and thus got through the meshes of the veil. By\ndrawing quick respirations through the mouth the wax\nwould be cooled and then forced slowly through the lips,\nassuming the pointed shape that was observed. Industrial\nchemists tell me that such waxes are known and might\nbe used in the way described, although I have not\nmyself tried the experiment.\nNow I can well imagine the reader thinking to himself\nthat this theory is far-fetched and grotesque, and in this\nI heartily agree with him. Yet it is, as far as I can see,\nthe only theory which could account for the phenomena\nunder the conditions observed at the sitting. It is quite\nuseless to assume that the object was brought in with\nthe medium and taken out again at the conclusion of the\ny\n\f322 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nseance. That assumption does not explain how the object\nwas seen first inside and tlien outside the veil. Nor can\nit with any degree of plausibility be maintained that\nwe were deceived or hallucinated, since under the direct\nlight of the torch both Mr. Feilding and I saw the\nobject free from the veil, and its bare point scraped\nover the Ijach of my hand. Such theories as these\nare conducive neither to the cause of honesty nor to\nthat of truth and the sooner they are discarded the\nbetter. The only refuge for the sceptic is melted wax\nor something like it, and that supposition hi itself\nrequires proof. Many of the most obstinate sceptics of\npsychical jjhenomeiia are like those persons who on going\nto a magical entertainment think that the experiments\nare explained by saying that \" they are done somehow\nwith mirrors or wires.\" Such observations explain nothing,\nand it would be far better to face the facts squarely\nthan to devise solutions which can only make the inventor\nlook ridiculous. If a medium is condemned as fraudulent,\na possible solution should at once be worked out in detail.\nOn a later occasion, when the phenomena again take place,\nthe theories should be tested until there remains no\nreasonable doubt as to the real character of the mani-\nfestations. In the present instance I had made my plans\nfor testing the wax theory if the veil was again penetrated\nby the substance. Unfortunately it was not repeated\nand so it was impossible to prove the theory either way.\nHowever, on June 5 (Seance XXV.) a similar appearance\nwas observed inside the veil. As it is necessary, assuming\nthe wax is melted, for the veil to be drawn into the\nmouth, I thought that it might be a useful test to prevent\nthis manoeuvre, which was accordingly done, and it is to\nbe noted that the substance did not on this occasion\npass through the veil. This in itself proves nothing, but\nit is an experiment which might be tried at intervals\nin the future.\nSeance XXV., June 5, 1920. This seance was especi-\nally interesting in relation to the wax theory as developed\nabove. In this case we nuist assume that the white\nobject seen at 5.15 p.m. was the piece of wax enclosed in\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 323\nits container and in a serai-solidified state. As conditions\nwere not suitable for an attempt to be made to pass it\nthrough the veil, the medium, by closing her mouth,\nbegan to melt it, and thvis when again seen at 5.46 p.m.\nit was like a piece of cream cheese in a transparent\nenvelope. This container is then broken, and we must\nnow assume that the black thread seen on the tip of the\ntongue was the ligature which had tied up the neck of\nthe transparent envelope. Once having broken the sheath\nthe wax would soon melt and spread over the tongue\nin a creamy mass as noticed at 6.3 p.m., a part being\nstill probably within the envelope which had contained it.\nSeance XXXI., June 16, 1920. At this sitting the\nphenomena came and disappeared so rapidly that there\nwas some disagreement amongst the observers as to what\nactually occurred. There seem to have been two objects,\n(a) the pointed waxy object, and (b) the flat round disc.\nAs in the sitting of June 11 there seems too little to say\nfrom the standpoint of fraud once the possibility of\nregurgitation is accepted.\nSeance XXXIV., June 21, 1920. This sitting was again\nan interesting one. The first phenomenon was the white\nsubstance which the medium and Mme Bisson asserted\nwas moving up the veil by itself. As previous investi-\ngators had decided that the teleplastic substance possessed\na mobility of its own, we were especially desirous of\nconfirming their observations. Unfortunately, however,\nthe present example of its movement was almost un-\ndoubtedly due to an illusion, and this is important as\nshowing the liability to such mistakes under the existing\nconditions. A mass of white saliva was visible on the\nveil, and by moving the head the medium was enabled\nto draw the veil up, thus giving the appearance of moving\nsaliva. As the movement of the black veil was invisible\nin the dark cabinet, the saliva alone was seen apparently\nmoving up over the surface of the veil. The next\nphenomenon, an hour later, was what at first sight\nappeared to be a remarkable elongation of the medium's\nnose. This was in reality another mass of saliva on the\nveil and just on a level with the nose. When the veil\n\f324 A Series of Sittings with Eva G. [part\nwas close to the face the mass touched it, and showed no\nbreak between the sahva and the skin, but on leaning\nforward to show the phenomenon the medium caused the\nveil to fall forwards and Mr. Houdini, Mr. Baggally, and\nmyself saw at least half an inch between the white mass\nand the tip of Eva's nose.\nThe next appearance was the curious oval patch seen\nover the medium's left eye, followed a minute after by\nthe terra-cotta red face seen sideways in the veil. If the\nphenomenon is fraudulent it is probable, as I have indi-\ncated in the detailed report, that the eye patch was the\nhack of the face and that they were not two distinct\nphenomena. In any case we have to assume that the\nobject was brought up by regurgitation and then swallowed.\nFourteen minutes after, the strip of ragged elastic substance\nappeared in the mouth, was pulled and stretched by the\nmedium's hands, and then disappeared suddenl5^ On the\nassumption of fraud the following would possibly be the\nexplanation of this phenoinenon. The substance, having\nbeen brought into the mouth, a part is gripped between\nthe teeth. It is then pulled out of the mouth and moulded\nand twisted with the hands. Rolled up between the\nfingers it is allowed to spring back into the mouth and is\nimmediately swallowed, but the mouldiiig still continues as\nif the substance were still there. Pulling the veil out, and\nstill apparently moulding the substance, the fingers are\nsuddenly opened out and the illusion of a sudden dis-\nappearance is perfect. Both Mr. Houdini and myself\nagreed that the effect could have been thus produced, and\nI think that there is little doubt as to the accuracy of our\noVjservations. How far this suggestion throws doubt upon\nthe honesty of the medium is open to question. Even if the\ndisappearance was effected as suggested, such a \" trick\n\"\ncould doubtless be interpreted as a subconscious wish to\nincrease the effect of the phenomenon, and by no means\nimplies that the whole of the manifestation was spurious.\nSuch trance-deceptions are well known and make the\ninterpretation of certain of the physical phenomena\nsingularly difficult. The important point for us to note\nis that if on this occasion the sudden disappearance of\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 325\nthe substance was effected by so subtle a device, how\nfar are we able to trust the observation of persons who\nknow nothing of such methods, and who have described\nequally puzzling phenomena which they say that they\nhave observed ?\nSeance XXXVI., June 24, 1920. At this sitting a\nsimilar piece of elastic substance was observed as on\nJune 21. This time it was openly put back into the\nmouth by the medium and did not suddenly vanish as\nbefore. When stretched out the surface showed a whole\nseries of tiny pin pricks, and in general appearance\nresembled a piece of some animal membrane such as\nmesentery.\nSeance XXXVIII., June 26, 1920. This sitting was\none of the most remarkable of all the seances that I\nattended. At 6.5 p.m. the cold breeze began and con-\ntinued for about 25 seconds. I know of no method for\nproducing this wind under the conditions obtaining at\nthe time. The medium was breathing very rapidly and\naudibly, and she could not possibly, in my opinion, have\nproduced it by her breath. A frequently reported accom-\npaniment of mediumship. the appearance of this breeze\nrather points to the conclusion that supernormal pheno7nena\ndo sometimes occur in the presence of this medium.\nThe next phenomenon was the appearance of the tough\nthread between Eva's fingers followed by the development\nof the membrane and thick, skinny, medalHon-shaped\nobject. After their sudden disappearance a beard-like\nappendage was seen hanging from the medium's mouth,\nand after the flash we saw the flat coloured face hanging\nfrom her lips. About an hour later a waxy pointed\nobject appeared in her mouth and then, whilst I was\nholding her hands, Eva produced a membrane between\nthem, which finally chsappeared whilst still being mani-\npulated. At the same time Dr. Fournier D'Albe inspected\nand felt the medium's lips to see that there was no\nthread attached to them.\nNow, if we had to account for these occurrences\nin a normal way, there are certain assumptions that\nit would be necessary to make in order to indicate the\n\f326 A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. [part\nsort of explanation that one is forced to offer if one\nwishes to adopt the hypothesis of fraud. In considering\nthis question the reader must not imagine that the\nCommittee has accepted these explanations of the pheno-\nmena. These suggestions are merely put forward in\norder to demonstrate how far the idea of fraud is capable\nof furnishing any satisfactory explanation at all.\nThe first point of importance, then, is the appearance\nof the membrane in the fingers which was observed at\n6.33 p.m. At first sight this appeared as if it had\nsprung from the tips of the fingers, and no doubt such\nphenomena have led some persons to imagine tihat the\nsubstance does in reality \" se degage \" from them. Thus\nDr. Geley speaks of the \" exteriorisation de la sidwtance\npar les doigts,\" and on March 6, 1913, a band of substance\nwas seen joining the two hands of the medium. These\nobservers seem to have no doubt that the substance has\ncome from the fingers and this opinion (which might be\nfounded in many cases upon a very simple deception),\nwas doubtless fostered by the belief that the medium's\nliands are visible throughout and do not approach her\nmouth. But is it not possible for the mouth to approach\nthe hands, when the ciu'tains are closed ? If one grips\nthe curtains and closes them, it is perfectly easy to\nbend the head down and with two fingers to withdraw\na piece of material from the mouth. On this occasion\nit is probable that this actually happened, as I tested\nthe theory at the moment that the ciirtains were closed\nby poking the fold just above the medium's hands.\nMy finger came in contact with the crown of Eva's\nhead which was evidentl}' bent down to meet her hands.\nIf, then, we assume that the membrane and medallion-\nshaped object had been brought into the mouth, they\ncould both be put into the hands as above described.\nConnected to them from the mouth might be elastic\ncords (see Fig. 131 in Mme Bisson's book), and at a\nconvenient moment the two are brought down between\nthe upper part of the legs and perhaps the medallion\nis pushed down between them. The membrane is then\nunfolded, and as the hands cover the medallion this is\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Siitings with Eva C. 327\nbrought up suddenly, a,nd the membrane flies back to\nthe mouth where it is either swallowed or retained. The\nmedallion later follows the same course, its ragged ends\nforming the \" beard \" appearance which was observed at\n6.37 p.m. The coloured face which was seen later might\nhave been the side of the medallion, which was not\nvisible as it lay in the medium's hands, ^ and could have\nbeen put out of the mouth whilst the cameras were being\nprepared.\nThe next phenomenon of importance was the appearance\nof the membrane in the fingers, whilst I was holding the\nmedium's hands. This substance might have been trans-\nferred from the mouth to the hands as before and then\nheld out just in front of the curtain. As I was holding\nEva's hands at the time, I was unable to determine the\nexistence of a thread leading to her mouth. As if\nreading my thoughts she turned her head right round\ntowards Dr. Fournier D'Albe and asked him to look at\nher mouth. The lips were closed and on feeling them he\ndetected nothing unusual. Unfortunately this test was\nnot entirely satisfactory, for the medium had placed her\nhead in one of the two positions when, if the thread had\nbeen there, it would not have been felt. It is clear that\nif her hands were in front holding an object connected\nto her mouth with a thread, the fact of twisting her head\nround at right angles would have taken the thread into\nthe extreme corner of her mouth, and so passing the fingers\nover the lips would have been useless. On discussing the\nincident with Dr. Fournier D'Albe I learnt that the lips\nwere shut and, whilst he was touching them, the mouth\nnever opened for a moment. The disappearance of the\nmembrane could be accounted for in the same way as\npreviously. The thread, by a quick upward movement\nand at the saine time l)y a strong inward breath, is\ndrawn into the mouth, bringing the membrane along\nwith it.\nThe above suggestions have been given simply as\nspecimens of the sort of foundation stones upon which the\nhypothesis of fraud must, if true, be built. It has often\n^ F. noted the fact that he saw a face under the medalHon.\n\f328 A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. [part\nbeen said that such explanations are worthless, since even\nif one magician fails to discover a method for producing\na certain phenomenon another might possibly do so.\nArguments like these exercise a profound influence on\nlaymen with sceptical minds. Even if a competent\nmagician is convinced as to the reality of certain psychical\nphenomena, they comfort themselves by saying that another\nmagician would have detected the \" trick.\" No evidence\nis therefore possible for such persons. Just as some\npeople say that spirits are responsible for all the physical\nphenomena, so do these declare that all are due to trickery.\nThe magician becomes a real wonderworker, and deception\nomnipotent. Such opinions are due to a complete mis-\nunderstanding as to the scope and limits of deception.\nThere are a vast number of things that a magician cannot\ndo. For example, at the present moment I could 7iot\nproduce a billiard ball from the ends of my fingers. The\nsimple reason for this is that the nearest billiard ball is\nin my property box at the other end of the room, and\nI could not get it without rising from my chair and\nactually fetching it. Now, if my two hands were held\nand I was put into a cabinet and the lights were turned\ndown, it would be still impossible for me to produce that\nbilliard ball unless a confederate handed it to me. If\nthe possibility of confederacy were eliminated, it would be\nan absolute impossibility to bring off the \" trick,\"\" and\nif that billiard ball then appeared between my fingers, and\nif it were photographed, it would be a supernormal pheno-\nmenon. No magician in the world could devise a method\nof producing a billiard ball if there was no billiard ball\nto produce. If the conditions are known and can be\naccurately determined at every point of the inquiry, it is\nquite possible to eUminate fraud absolutely. I have said\nelsewhere and now repeat that I consider these require-\nments were met at the S.P.R. sittings with Eusapia at\nNaples in 1908, and that therefore I am forced to the\nconclusion that Eusapia Palladino possessed genuine super-\nnormal powers. With regard to Eva C. the case is some-\nwhat different. Speaking purely for myself I cannot say\nthat I altogether rely upon the observations of her\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 329\ncontinental investigators, whilst the sittings in England\nwere too few and the phenomena too insignificant ?^to\nenable any satisfactory conclusion to be arrived at.\nIt may be convenient here to sum up the main points\nfor and against the reality of the phenomena in addition\nto those already outlined by Mrs. Salter in the Proceedings\nfor July, 1914, 'pp. 364-366.\nThe Case against the Phenomena.\n(1) It is always open to doubt whether controllers\nuntrained in methods of trickery can prevent prepared\nobjects from being brought into the seance room.\n(2) A certain number of the \" heads \" appear as if made\nof paper. Actual paper has been found upon five separate\noccasions.\n(3) Without being able definitely to say that the medium\nemployed deceptive methods for the production and\ndisappearance of the phenomena, it is notewortJiy that the\nmanipulations in question are by no means inconsistent\nwith those which would have been necessary if normal\nmethods had been employed.\n(4) The S.P.R. Committee never observed anything\nwhich led them to suppose that materializations do\nactually originate elsewhere than from the mouth. The\nsingle example in Seance XXXVIII. might be explained\nby the medium having produced the membrane from her\nmouth previously to its exhibition.\n(5) The nature of the materializations is such that an\nenormous weight of evidence would have to be adduced\nbefore their reality became a matter of certainty.\nThe Case for the Phenomena.\n(1) There is no proof whatever that the medium\npossesses the power of regurgitation or has any acquaint-\nance whatever with deceptive methods or contrivances.\nThe \" tricks \" suspected by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing and\nthe S.P.R. Committee may be merely subconscious\nattempts to increase the eftect of the phenomena.\n\f330 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\n(2) The materializations are clearly often not made of\npaper, chiffon, or any similar substance. This is evident\nfrom photographic enlargements, besides being excluded\nby the fact that on certain occasions they changed their\nshape whilst under direct observation.\n(3) The medium has never been detected in the prepara-\ntion or secretion of any article likely to be of service in\nthe seances.\n(4) If Mme Bisson and Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing be\naccepted as even moderately good observers, no amount\nof fraud could explain certain phenomena that they say\nthat they have observed.\n(5) Comparative studies show that Eva C. is not the\nonly medium producing these manifestations. Accounts\nof the phenomena with other mediums are remarkably\nsimilar to those occurring with her.\n(6) The appearance of the cold breeze rather leads one\nto suppose that mediumistic phenomena do occur in Eva's\npresence.\nFrom the above remarks it may be thought at first\nthat the case against the phenomena is so strong that the\nsubject may be at once dismissed. Such a standpoint\nwould in my opinion be entirely mistaken and would\nshow clearly that its supporter had not the smallest\nappreciation of the difficulties of judging psychical pheno-\nmena. To suppose that Eva C. possesses powers of\ndeception which she must undoubtedly wield in order to\nproduce the phenomena is an absolutely unwarranted\nassumption which has hardly a shred of evidence to\nsupport it. Although in strictly scientific work personal\nevidence and opinion count for little, they possess a\ncertain value which it would be foolish to ignore. Thus\nto suppose that Mme Bisson is an accomplice in a shame-\nless fraud which has already lasted eleven years is a\nhypothesis which can scarcely be considered probable.\nIt is, of course, possible.\nGranting her innocence, many of the phenomena become\ninexplicable and unaccountable. That an object looks\nlike a hand made out of paper, is an insufficient reason\n\fLxxxiv.] A Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. 331\nfor saying that it is such a hand, if the evidence is\nsuch as to make this improbable. If the phenomena\nare supernormal, all we can do is to take them for\nwhat they are and carefull}\" observe them. We cannot\ndictate as to the sort of phenomenon we wish to see\nand always expect to get it. Even though we may\nwant a full form phantasm and only get a botched\nportrait of President Wilson with a black eye, it does not\nfollow of necessity that the latter is so curious that its\nsupernormality may be denied a priori. For if spirits exist\ntheir actions may be as unaccountable as those of mortals,\nand in the process of influencing matter the most singular\ndistortions may be produced. If, on the other hand,\nthe materializations are non-spiritistic teleplastic products,\nas Dr. von Schrenck believes, then the portrait of Mr.\nWilson might be a dream image,'\" intentionally disguised\nthrough some obscure subconscious process. It must\nbe remembered that Eva is not by any means alone\nin producing this variety of materialization. There are\nother mediums now undergoing examination whose pheno-\nmena strongly resemble those of Eva C. The investigation\nof these mediums should be conducted with the greatest\npossible care and the results correlated with those already\nobtained. Such work would yield the most valuable\nmaterial and quite possibl}^ would result in the final\nsubstantiation of phenomena which at the present moment\nremain still doubtful and perplexing.\n\fCHAPTER IV.\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS.\nIn recording our general impres.sions we much regret that\nwe are unable to come definitely either to positive or to\nnegative conclusions. The phenomena were too scanty and\nthe sittings too few for us to be able to determine with any\ndegree of accuracy the real nature of the phenomena.\nTaken by themselves these were remarkably unimpressive.\nOn no single occasion did we observe the larger materiali-\nzations as described by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, nor\ndid the phenomena in sufficiently observed conditions\nemerge from any other part of the medium's body than\nher mouth. If we had not been acquainted with the\nwork of previous investigators we might have felt inclined\nto draw negative conclusions from our own observations.\nIt is, however, impossible to ignore the contributions of\nMme Bisson, Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing and Dr. Geley.\nEven if the phenomena we observed were few in number\nand poor in quality, they were of the same type as those\nstudied by our predecessors. The aim of our investi-\ngation was scarcely as ambitious as that which had been\npursued by Dr. von Schrenck and by Dr. Geley. Above\nall we wished to determine the reality of the phenomena,\nand to have the opportunity of studying at first hand\nthe problems associated with so called teleplastic medium-\nship. It is deeply to be regretted that it was not until\nthe thirty-eighth seance that the phenomena began to\nassume an impressive character. We believe that if the\nseances had continued for another couple of months, we\nshould have been able to come to a definite conclusion\none way or the other. We consider the evidence for\n\f[part lxxxiv.] a Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. 333\neven unconscious fravid to be of the slenderest, although\nat the same time we fully recognise the difificulty of\naccurate observation and correct deduction. We believe\nI that our own control almost unquestionably eliminated\nany fraudulent method for the production of the\nphenomena other than regurgitation, and it is unfortunate\nthat nothing occurred of sufficient magnitude to convince\nus of the impossibility of that hypothesis. Whether\nregurgitation as a basis for the phenomena is sufficient\nto explain them is a question which is open to grave\ndoubt, while it is clear that, assuming the accuracy of\ntheir observations, it is certainly insufficient to explain\nS the major phenomena described by our predecessors. Mr.\nDingwall has in his study of the sittings attempted to\nconsider what must have been the methods employed if\nthe phenomena are to be attributed entirely to trickery.\n'\nAlthough the Committee as a whole have not his qualifi-\ncations as a conjurer to estimate the possibility of the\nmethods which he finds himself driven to suggest, they\nconcur with his view that to suppose that these were in\nfact the methods employed is only a lesser strain on possi-\nbilities than the adoption of the ideoplastic hypothesis\nput forward by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing. If this\napplies to our own observations it naturally applies in a far\ngreater degree to the observations of our predecessors.\nThe student has therefore to decide whether the major\nphenomena can be explained through other fraudulent\ndevices, together with mal-observation and careless re-\nporting, or whether they can be considered as genuine\noccurrences. As our own conclusions must be strictly\nlimited to material gathered from personal observation we\ncannot enter into a discussion of that problem.\nIt only remains for us to say a few more words on the\nsubject of this report. With regard to the medium it\nmust be said that her conduct deserves the highest appro-\nbation. Patient under every control, she appeared to do\nall in her power to assist the observers in an investi-\ngation which at times, owing to the frec^uency of the\nsittings and the extreme heat which prevailed, could not\nfail to be wearisome both to the sitters and to her.\n\f334 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nMme Bisson's conduct also was deserving of much praise.\nIn spite of the fact that the phenomena were disappointing,\nshe preserved an almost unbroken demeanour of courteous\ntolerance, and was always willing to acquiesce in sugges-\ntions made by the Committee. Fully convinced herself\napparently of the genuine character of the materializations,\nshe naturally showed some impatience when she thought\nthat the doubts of the observers were founded neither upon\nlogic nor reason. Since they were unable to speak English\nwith any degree of fluency, and lacked such social companion-\nship as that to which they had been accustomed in Paris,\nit may be feai'ecl that these ladies' stay in London was\nnot as pleasant as they might have anticipated. It may\nbe possible that these difficulties, coupled with a natural\nanxiety about the issue, may have had an adverse effect\non the production of the phenomena. Further, Mme\nBisson, perceiving certain precautions taken by the con-\ntrollers in the earlier sittings before her general attitude\nand mentality were known to them, for a long time took\nsuch ostentations pains to dissociate herself from any\npossible suspicion of complicity, by refusing to touch the\nmedium or even to approach her during the experiments,\nthat unfamiliar conditions were, contrary to the expressed\nwish of tlie Committee, introduced, and may not un-\nreasonably be thought to have resulted in an inhibitory\ninfluence on the free development of the phenomena.\nThe laws governing these occurrences are not yet known, and\nalthough we think it hardly likely that the actual mentality\nof the observers can have any deleterious effect upon\nthem, it is not improbable that if their mentality is\nbelieved ])_y the medium to be hostile, and she thereupon\nbecomes suspicious and resentful, such an attitude on her\npart might altogether obstruct the free development\nof the psychic forces. In the present case it was inevit-\nable that the mental attitude of the observers was one\nof doubtful and attentive scrutiny. That it was not, as\nMme Bisson frequently supposed, one of convinced hostility,\nshould be sufficiently clear from the terms of this report ; but\nit is possible that this impression regarding it, communicated\nto the medium, may have affected the results unfavourably.\n\fLXXXIV.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 335\nI\nSumming up then our impressions, we believe that the\nonly possible hj^othesis to account hy means of trickery\nfor the phenomena that we ourselves observed would be\nI the postulation of the medium's power of regurgitation,\nfor which there is absolutely no direct evidence. While\nthe phenomena studied by others appear to have been\nof the same character, they were of so much greater\nI\nmagnitude that we are unable to hold the view that\nregurgitation is a sufficient explanation of these. To\nsuppose them all fraudulent would involve a further\nsupposition that former investigators were deceived through\na long period of years by methods of which we had no\nindication in our own experiments, a proposition which\nI\nwe have no adequate grounds for advancing. It remains\nonly therefore to state that for ourselves the phenomena\nwere not sufficient for us to determine their genuine\ncharacter, but from the evidence of others fortified by\nthe extreme difficulty of accounting reasonably by trickery\neven for certain of the phenomena observed by ourselves,\nwe feel we cannot discard the possibilitj' of their super-\nnormal character. Ho^^ever unsatisfactory our own in-\nvestigation may have been, we cannot conclude without\nsaying that in our opinio'n these phenomena deserve the\nmost careful and earnest attention that it is possible to\nbestow upon them. We have been forced to forgo any\ninvestigation into the psj^cho-pathological side of the\ncase, though we are of the opinion that the final solution\nas to the form and character of such materializations can\nprobably onh^ be arrived at through a long and patient\nstudy of the medium's own unconscious mechanisms.\nBefore, however, commencing a study of this nature, the\nvalidity of the phenomena themselves must, in our opinion,\nbe firmly established and placed beyond all doubt.\nTowards that end have our own efforts been directed, and\nhowever unsuccessful they may have been, it is to be\nhoped that they may contribute something to the study\nof this peculiar and suggestive form of mediumistic\nactivity.\n\fAPPENDIX I.\nIt will be remembered that after the twenty-eighth seance\non June 11, 1920, some small white particles were found on\nthe veil. On examination these proved to be paper and Mme\nBisson suggested that they might be accounted for by a piece\nof hair or cake paper which had lodged in the medium's\nteeth and had been ejected during the course of the material-\nizing process. Specimens of these papers were sent by Mme\nBisson and, together with the test tube specimens were sub-\nmitted to analysis. The following is the result as certified\nhy'ljDv. J. N. Goldsmith, the consulting chemist to whom\nthe specimens were sent.\n(1) Cake Paper.\nThis is a parchment paper not easih'' disintegrated.\nThe paper was teased out' in water, and dyed in a\nhot 2h per cent, solution of Congo Red, washed, dried,\nand mounted in Canada Balsam. It is a wood pulp\npaper containing many crushed fibres.\n(2) Hair Paper (Brown).\nPreparation and mounting as in the previous slide.\nThis paper is easily disintegrated. It is an ordinary\ncheap wood pulp paper.\n(3) Hair Paper (White).\nPreparation and mounting as before. This was easilj\"\ndisintegrated ; it is an ordinary cheap wood pulp paper.\nThe microscopic appearance of the portion mounted is\nnot identical with the test tube s^iecimen.\n(4) Test Tube Specimen (of Particles found on medium's veil).\nTreatment and mounting as before. The slide shows\nAvood pulp fibres similar to those found in cheap papers.\n336\n\f[part lxxxiv.] a Series of Sittings with Eva C. 337\nThis slide contains certain vegetable cells which are not\nvisible in the three previous slides ; it may be accidental,\nsometimes several slides of a paper must be made before\nall the characteristic cells can be identified, as so many\ncells are broken up in the manufacture.\nSince wood pulp papers are very common it would be\nexceedingly difficult to prove the identity of the test\ntube specimen with another sample of paper even if\nthe microscopic picture were the same. In the present\ncase the microscopic picture is not the same. As far\nas these observations go the probabilit3' is that the\ntest tube specimen is different from either of the three\npaper samples. Further work would be necessary if a\nfinal opinion is required on this point. As an ordinary\nmicroscopic examination no interest whatever would\nattach to these four specimens.\nThe Phloroglucin Test for wood pulp was tried and gave\na marked jaositive result with the Cake Paper, a very faint\npositive result Math the Brown Paper, and a negative result\nwith the White Hair Paper and with the Test Tube Specimen.\nThis test gives a pink colour with mechanical wood pulp, but\nno reaction ^dth comjDletely bleached chemical wood pulp or\nwith cotton and linen.\n\fAPPENDIX II.\nOne day the medium suggested that she should visit a\nphysician in order that a careful examination of her throat\nmight be made. Accordingly on June 28th she was taken\nto see Mr. W. M. Mollison, F.R.C.S., who proceeded to make\na careful examination of her throat and adjacent parts. His\nreport reads as follows :\n23 Devonshire Place,\nUpper Wimpole Street, W. 1,\nJune 28, 1920.\nI saw Eva C. this afternoon. Examination of her nose,\nnasopharynx, pharynx and larjaix reveals no abnormality.\nThe pharyngeal irritability is normal. Her tongue is rather\nfissured and is suggestive of dyspepsia, though as a matter of\nfact she does not have dyspepsia.\n(Signed) W. M. Mollison.\nAfter the medium's throat had been examined in the ordmary\nway she inquired if a more careful insi^ection could net be\nmade. Dr. Mollison replied that he could examine her oeso-\nphagus if she insisted, but that it was a rather painful pro-\nceeding. The medium, however, demanded the examination,\nand her throat was cocained prior to the passage of the tube.\nUnfortunately, however, the electric lamp connected with the\napparatus refused to work and the examination had to be\nabandoned.\nIt will be of interest to state that, as we have been in-\nformed, Mme Bisson has been able during the period of time\nwhich has elapsed since our experiments took place gradually\nto improve the conditions of the seances, holding them fre-\nquently in full daylight, and that, although the phenomena\n3,S8\n\f[part lxxxiv.] a Series of Sittings ivith Eva C. 339\nare of less magnitude than those reported in her book, results\nof great interest have been observed. An account of one\nof them was read by Mme Bisson at the International Congress\non Psychical Research, recently held at Coi^enhagen, and will,\nwe understand, be included in the Report which is to be\npublished of the Proceedings of the Congress.\nAs a result of the frequent suggestions that Eva C.\"s pheno-\nmena could be explained bj' regurgitation, Madame Bisson took\nher in May of this year to be examined by two radiologists,\nin order to ascertain whether there was anything abnormal in\nthe appearance or functioning of the oesojihagus and stomach.\nWith Madame Bisson's permission we print below the certificate\ngiven by the radiologists as a result of the examination.\n'\nCertificat.\nNous soussignes\n|\nLouis Beaupbez, Dodeur en medeciyie de la Faculte de Paris,\nancien interne des asiles, ancien ^repara\/ew de radiologie\na I'HSpital Broca, Medecin-Exj^ert pres les Tribuneaux,\ndemeurant a Paris, 32 rue Desaix,\net Emile Vallet, Docteur en medecine de la faculte de Paris,\nancien interne de Saint-Lazare, Chevalier de la Legion\nd'Honneur, demeurant a Paris, 72 rue Cardinet,\nCertifions avoir procede le 24 3Iai 1921 a Vexamen radiologique\nde Vcesophage et de Vestomac du medium de Madame Bisson,\nMademoiselle Eva Carriere, dgee de 34 ans, que Vun de nous\n{le Dr. Beauprez) connatt _perso>i.e^Zeme\/ii ^jowr Vavoir vue a\nplusieurs reprises chez Madame Bisson dans des seances an\ncours desquelles ce medium a donne des inaterialisations\n.\nUexamen a ete pratique a dix heures du matin, Mademoiselle\nEva Carriere etait a jeun ; nous lui avons fait ingurgiter iin\nlait de bismuth et nous avons pu constater que le passage du\nbismuth dans Vcesophage se fait d'une fagon absolument normale\net que Vcesophage ne presente aucune particularity, telle que\nretrecissement, dilatation oxi diverticule.

W. Baggally.\nMy first opinion, at the sittings held with Eva C, in the\nrooms of the Society for Psychical Research, at which I was\npresent, was that as some of the objects which made their\nappearance were seen to issue from the mouth of the medium,\nshe had the power of regurgitation. I concluded that she\nhad swallowed them before coming to the rooms and then\nregurgitated them. I was aware that there were public\nperformers like Roniski, the Russian, who swallowed gold-\nfish, frogs, etc., and then caused them to issue from his\ngullet in full view of his audiences. The phenomena of Eva C.\nI considered to be of the same character, the difference being\nthat the objects swallowed by her were smaller. But as the\nsittings continued, I had to alter my opinion as to Eva C.'s\nphenomena being a case of simple regurgitation. Elements\nof a puzzling nature presented themselves. Some of the\nobjects were of such a character that it was difficult to under-\nstand how they could have been concealed in the gullet of the\nmedium. As an example I would refer to the black material\nwhich covered the lower part of Eva's C.'s face, like a beard,\nat the sitting of 28th April, 1920, and which was subse-\nquently seen on her right hand, which ^vas at the time\nunder control. If this material had issued from her gullet\nit would be natural to suppose that it would have been\nmoist. I felt it and found it to be dry. To the touch\nit was Uke a crumpled-up, stiff, veil.\nAt the same sitting a flash-light photograph \\\\as taken\nof an object which was seen resting on the medium's right\nbreast. When the photograph was developed it showed a\nsmall female face surromided by a wide circular frame con-\n341\n\f342 A Series of Sittings with Eva C. [part\nsisting of aiDparently the same kind of material as that which\nhad been seen on Eva C.'s face and hand. It is difficult\nto understand how the medium could have concealed material\nof this nature in her gullet. This material was not seen\nto issue from, nor to re-enter her mouth, but at the seance\nof the 21st June, 1920, when Mr. DLngwall was controlling\nthe medium's hands, a substance was seen to issue from her\nmouth under perplexmg conditions.\nI will quote from my notes of this sitting :\n\"Before the sitting began Eva C, at her own sugges-\ntion, drank a cup of coffee and ate a biscuit to prove\nthat she had nothing concealed in her gullet.\n\" Eva C. asked, towards the end of the sitting, to\nbe allowed to have her hands free. This was granted\nwhile Dingwall still held her wrists. She then began to\npull something from her mouth with both her hands.\nI had a good view of this as my face was within a foot\nfrom her mouth. She kept pulling this something from\nher mouth and stretching it out in different directions.\nIt appeared to be of a grey colour of an irregular shape.\nIt suddenly vanished while I was intently watching\nit. Immediately after its disappearance Eva C. said\n'\nExamme my mouth.' This was at once done with the\nelectric torch. Nothmg was seen in her mouth. During\nthe whole time that the phenomenon occurred the strong\nlight of the electric torch was used.\"\nMadame Bisson, in her book, Les PMnomenes dits de Materia-\nlisation, refers repeatedly to the sudden manner in which\nthe objects, that present themselves at Eva C.'s seances,\ndisappear. (See pp. 290, 293, 302.)\nThe perplexing disappearance of objects was also noticeable\nat our seances, and, whatever be the method by which it\nwas brought about, it appears difficult to believe that it\nwas by the use of the medium's hands, when the way they\nwere controlled is considered. I was present at twenty-one\nsittings. I controlled Eva C.'s left hand during six of these\nsittings and her right hand during eleven. I can confidently say\nthat during the whole of these sittings the control of the\nmedium's hands by Mr. Dingwall and myself was most rigid.\n\fLxxxrv.] A Series of Sittings with Eva C. 343\nWhen the hands were not held, they were always in sight.\nNot for a moment was our attention relaxed.\nIt is to be regretted that the seances could not have been\ncontinued as, towards their end, there appeared to be increasing\nevidence of a supernormal element coming into play. It is\nalso to be regretted that no full form figures made their\nappearance at our sittings like those shown in some of the\nillustrations in Mme. Bisson\"s book. Had they done so\nwe should have been more able to form a definite opinion\nas to the real nature of Eva C.'s phenomena.\n\fTHE MODUS OPERANDI IN SO-CALLED\nMEDIUMISTIC TRANCE.\nBy (LTna) Lady Teoubeidge.\nAs a preliminary to what I am going to say about the\ntrance phenomena observable in the persons of so-called\nmediums, I am anxious to make it quite clear that\nI am' not purporting to relate any remarkable new\nevidence received for or against the theory of personal\nsurvival of bodily death, and although evidence of this\ntype received through a medium, Mrs. Leonard, will\nincidentally be mentioned, its value from that standpoint\nwill not be the reason for its inclusion in this paper. It\nis with the question of the actual modus O'permidi involved\nin the reception by certain subjects when in trance\nof impressions derived from sources apparently not avail-\nable to the same subject when in a waking state, that\nI wish to deal ; with the conditions which may affect,\nfavourably or adversely, the production of the phenomena\nwhose source is the subject of so much discussion.\nMy reason for selecting this subject is that I have a\nstrong feeling that the entire question of so-called medium-\nistic phenomena is just now at a very important stage\nin its evolution.\nIt is now nearly forty years since a few courageous\nindividuals founded the Society for Psychical Research\nfor the avowed purpose of investigating as scientifically\nas possible what had up to that time been regarded by\nmost of their contemporaries as material beneath serious\nconsideration ;\nnamely, the various reports of hallucina-\ntions, hauntings, premonitions, phantasms, and the move-\nments of inanimate objects without visible cause, which\n344\n\f[part lxxxiv.] 'Modus Operandi' in Mediumistic Trance. 345\nwere held by some of those witnessing or experiencing\nthem to point to ultra-mundane intervention, and generally,\nby those not involved in the experiences, to be due to\nindigestion, or a taste for romance.\nAlthough the work of the Society for Psychical Research\nhas from its initiation been one of steadilj' maintained\nprogression, I think, nevertheless, that it is only within\nthe last few years that one of its most definite aims has\nbeen accomplished. We may regard Mrs. Henry Sidg-\nwick's Paper on the Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance\nPhenomena as a milestone at which it behoves us to\npause and consider. Mrs. Sidgwick terminates this Paper\nby stating that study of the Piper phenomena has led\nher to the belief that in the trance state Mrs.\nPiper's \" normal powers transcend in some directions\nthose of her ordinary waking self, as is often the case\nin hypnosis. And further\u2014what makes her case of\ngreat importance\u2014she can obtain imperfectly, and for\nthe most part fragmentarily, telepathic impressions. Or\nrather, as it would perhaps be more correct to say,\nsuch impressions are not only received by her as the\nresult of her own telepathic activity or that of other\nspirits\u2014spirits of the living or maybe of the dead\u2014but\nrise partially or completely into the consciousness operat-\ning in the trance communications, and so are recognised.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick has not been the first of those seriously\nengaged upon psychical investigation to reach the con-\nviction that, after the exclusion of all conceivable fraud,\nconscious or unconscious, and taking also into consideration\ncoincidence and all known normal explanations, there\nremains among the phenomena studied by herself and her\ncolleagues a residuum which demands an explanation that\nis not as yet forthcoming. For some years past a number\nof our most distinguished members have devoted much\ntime and energy to the study of the phenomena known as\ncross-correspondences ; the automatic script involved in\nthe production of these has largely been obtained through\nthe agency of automatists whose integrity is so above all\nquestion, that the explanation of conscious fraud has not\neven required consideration. Without going into any\n\f346 (Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\ndetail, we may say that their study of the cross-corre-\nspondences has led these investigators to the same con-\nclusion as that expressed by Mrs. Sidgwick in her Paper\non the Piper Phenomena, and it will, I think, be admitted\nthat few unprejudiced and capable observers will now\ndeny the possible existence of telepathy at any rate, even\nif they do not care to go further.\nIt would be difficult to over-estimate the importance\nof such an advance from a condition of pure surmise,\nbut much remains to be done. It becomes at once\nimperative not only to proceed further, but to do so by\nthat particular road which is best calculated, perhaps\namong several available roads, to lead us to the next\nstage of the journey. The most interesting road is not\nnecessarily the best, and short cuts are as dangerous as\nthey are alluring.\nIn this matter of psychical investigation, side by side\nwith the question of the existence or non-existence of\nthe alleged phenomena, there has always appeared the\nenthralling question of what might be their source, and\ngranted the recognition of the existence of super-normal\nphenomena as an established fact, it is this question of\nthe source thereof which may now be considered by many\nserious students of Psychical Research to be the problem\nto which thev should devote themselves. -\nNow it is my conviction that another stage of the\ninvestigation should precede the attempt to ascertain the\nsource of the phenomena ; a stage quite as important, if\nless attractive to the imagination and the ambitions.\nBeing myself deeply and perhaps primarily interested in\nthe question as to whether or not the phenomena we\nare observing point to the action of entities who have\nsurvived bodily death, I am the better able to realise\nthe interest of this absorbing question to a large number\nof investigators. It is incidentally the main point upon\nwhich are based the prejudice and ill-feeling that so often\nenter into discussions of the subject of psychical pheno-\nmena as a whole, both in the Press and in other publications.\nIt is the entry of this question into the subject of Psychical\nResearch which I cannot but feel has often had a regret-\n\fLxxxiv.] ' Modus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 347\ntable effect upon the way in which the whole subject is\nregarded by many persons whose assistance, would they\ngive it, could only benefit the investigation.\nFew persons of real intelligence are stimulated to\nenquiry by being told insistently, without adequate\nexplanation, the solution of a problem before they have\nthemselves gone into its processes. And when the problem\nin question appears to be solved by two conflicting\nparties with equal conviction in two diametrically opposite\nways, it is rarely that the potential enquirer cares to seek\nfurther, or even suspects the existence of competent\npersons who are less sweeping in their judgments. Definite\npronouncements made upon an inadequate rational basis\nare powerful irritants. There also results, among many\nintelligent persons, a prejudice that involves not individual\nopinions only, or their exponents, but the entire Society\nfor Psychical Research, which, being less clamorous in its\nmethods, does not always get the merit due to it for\nits sedulously temperate and neutral policy. There are\nmany quite intelligent persons who honestly believe that\nthe Society for Psychical Research exists mainly for the\npurpose of proving or disproving personal survival of\nbodily death and communication with the departed.\nPossibly could it be made clearer that the Society for\nPsychical Research is not only equally interested in the\nproving or disproving of this important question, but is\nanxious that any conclusions on this matter should be\npostponed until more is known regarding the phenomena\ninvolved, we might gain many useful workers, trained in\nother branches of science, and save ourselves from the\nrisk of what I will call skipping a vitally important stage\nof the investigation.\nI feel strongly that, to whatever conclusions each in-\ndividual investigator may come as to the possible source\nof the phenomena, his conclusions will always be open\nto doubt, so long as he is obliged to confess an almost\ntotal ignorance of the nature of the processes whereon\nthey are based.\nI am quite aware that, in suggesting that the main line\nof investigation now to be pursued is the examination\n\f348 (Una) Lady Troiibridqe. [part\nand the attempted comprehension of the ynodus operandi\ninvolved in the production of Psychical Phenomena, I am\nsuggesting an advance into almost total darkness, and\nadvocating a course only to be paralleled by requesting\na physiological student to study practical vivisection in\na country devoid of animal life. Mediumistic trance\nphenomena of a pronounced type are rare. Where the\nfaculty exists and is recognised, it is either concealed by\nthe possessor as an undesirable peculiarity, or it is a\nvalued possession for one reason or another. Sometimes\nit is a source of religious consolation, in other cases it\nprocures interest and admiration for an individual who\nwould otherwise command neither, and sometimes it is a\nmeans of livelihood with which it would not be legitimate\nto tamper. At all events, subjects are not going to be\nplentiful, who will risk the possible diminution or loss of\nthis remarkable faculty by submitting it without reserve\nto the experimentation of operators who cannot pretend\nto foresee results.\nIn any case, with the most complaisant subject, and\nperhaps most of all with such, the scientific investigator\nis in honour bound to consider above all other things the\npossible results of his experiments upon the subject\nsubmitted to his examination, and this consideration\nvery considerably limits the field of legitirhate experi-\nment.\nBut in spite of this fact, there does appear to me\nto be one road of investigation which could be legitimately\npursued, without fear of harming the subject, and along\nwhich there comes towards us perhaps a very faint ray\nof light.i\nIn dealing with this matter I will take as an example\nthe medium Mrs. Leonard, her trance phenomena being\nthose of which I have personally had the fullest experience.\nI have sat with her either as sitter or recorder about\none hundred and eighty times, and I shall quote her\n^ This paper was written before the publication of Mr. Whately\nSmith's paper on \" A Suggested New Method of Research \" (Proc.\nS.P.R., Vol. XXXI., p. 401 ff.), and I do not therefore discuss the\ninteresting suggestions which he there makes. _\n.\n,^\n\fLxxxiv.] '\nModus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 349\nalso as being, to the best of my belief, one of the best\ntrance mediums at present alive - and in this country.\nNow, whether or no Mrs. Leonard be an intermediary\nbetween incarnate and discarnate human beings, does not\nhere concern us. A less debatable point will suffice\nfor the purpose of this paper ; Mrs. Leonard, who alter-\nnates between a very normal \" normal consciousness,\"\na slight drowsiness or haziness productive of automatic\nscript, a partially analgesic trance followed by almost\ntotal amnesia on waking, in which she shows the charac-\nteristics of a personality quite foreign to her waking self,\nand yet a fourth, also apparently a trance condition, in\nwhich she reproduces with more or less success the vocal\ncharacteristics and mannerisms of deceased persons of both\nsexes, who were never known to her during their lives, is\ncertainly a case of abnormal psychology. And from this\nfact comes m}^ postulated ray of light.\nThe abnormal psychology of Mrs. Leonard is in some\nrespects similar to that of recorded and published cases\namong patients studied by curative experts. It abounds\nin features common to many pronounced examples of\nwhat is known as Multiple Personality. In this respect,\ntherefore, there may possibly be much to be gained by\ncareful observation as to the extent to which it is possible\nto bring the abnormal psychology of Mrs. Leonard and\nother trance mediums into line with the abnormal psycho-\nlogy of those who are not, to all appearance, mediums,\nbut who only share Mrs. Leonard's peculiarities in some\nother respects. We should by this means, at any rate,\nreduce the totally unclassifiable portions of Mrs. Leonard's\nabnormal psychology to that portion wherein she definitely\ndiffers from any so far classified case. The accomplish-\nment of this much, taking into consideration how much\nyet remains hypothetical in the classification of even\nnon-mediumistic examples of multiple personality, might\nmerely lead us up a blind alley, but that is a risk which\nmust be taken by the pioneer.\nThe line of enquiry that I am suggesting is not a\nnew departure ; ever since the publication of the re-\ncords of the earliest observed and recognised cases of\n\f350 (Una) Laxly Troubridge. [part\nMultiple Personality, careful investigators of psychical\nphenomena have remarked a similarity between certain of\nthe complexes, or personalities, produced by dissociation,\nand a not unusual type of so-called \" Control \" who\ndirects the proceedings during many mediumistic trances.\nA salient example of this kind was the \" Sally \" of the\nMiss Beauchamp case recorded by Doctor Morton Prince.\nAnyone who has sat much with trance mediums, and who\nhas become familiar with the type of girl or child control\nso often met with, and who reads of Sally, can hardly\nfail to remark the analogies. If we rule out the purport-\ning production of information super-normally acquired,\nMrs. Thomson's control \" Nellie,\"' the Minnehaha control\nof Doctor Hyslop's medium Mrs. Chenoweth, and others\nof the same type have a strong family likeness to Sally,\nto the \" Leontine \" Personality of Doctor Pierre Janet's\nLeonie Case and also to a trance entity whom I have\nlately been able to study\u2014the \" Moyenne \" personality\ndeveloped under hypnosis by the young Polish medium\nMiss Tomczyk, who gave a series of test seances to the\nSociety for Psychical Research some five years ago, and\nwho is also known to us through the reports of Doctor\nOchorowicz in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques. Indeed\nMoyenne is an especially interesting case, owing to the\ndifficulty experienced in attempting to classify her even\nprovisionally as being definitely either Spirit Control \" or\n\" Secondary Personality.\" She does not fit comfortably\ninto either class, and whichever one she is placed in she\nproceeds to overflow into the other. If we classify her\nas a \" Spirit Control \" we are met by the difficulty that\nher claim to be such is not only inadequate, but is of\nrecent date. Taking into consideration the fact that of\nlate years Miss Tomczyk, in her capacity of an interesting\npsychical subject, has inevitably met and known many\nconvinced spiritualists, we need seek no further for an\nexplanation of Moyenne's rather tardy decision that she\nis a spirit invasion. She can, moreover, adduce nothing\nevidential in support of this claim, she does not tell us\nwhy she opened her career by asserting that she was\nmerely a part of Miss Tomczyk, or what reasons caused\n\fLxxxiv.] 'Modus Operandi' in Mediumistic Trance. 351\nher to change her mind on this subject ; she offers no\nproofs of identity with any person formerly incarnate,\nand any questions as to her origin, or regarding her\nsurroundings when \" away \" from Miss Tomczyk, are\neffectually and unsatisfactorily quenched by the mere\nassertion on her part that she was never incarnate at all\nas a human being, and that she is forbidden by certain\nconvenient rules to tell anything connected with her\ndiscarnate conditions, past, present or future.\nUnder these circumstances it would seem obviously the\nproper course to disregard Moyenne\\s inadequately sustained\npose of \" Spirit invasion,\" and set her down firmly, as I\nunderstand Miss Tomczyk herself is inclined to do, as\nmerely a dissociated complex. But just here we are met\nby a feature which at once tends to push her back into\nthe Spirit Control \" department ; for it is only when\nMoyenne holds sway that Miss Tomczyk is able to produce\nthose physical phenomena\u2014levitations, apparent de-\nmaterializations, apports, etc., which have been obtained\nthrough her mediumship under test conditions entirely\nsatisfactory to the investigators, to whom she uncondi-\ntionally submitted herseK.\nIf we disregard the alleged super-normal powers exhibited\nby Moyenne, she conforms in most respects admirably to\nthe recognised features of a certain type of Secondary\nPersonality. Like Sally, Moyenne is whimsical ; appealing,\noften pathetic, and often amazingly attractive. Like\nSally and Leontine, she is animated, irresponsible, noisy\nand irrepressible, and on occasion intractable. Like Sally\ntoo she exhibits genuine if sometimes misplaced humour,\nand like Sally, Leontine and also Margaret, another\nSecondary Personality of whom we will treat presently,\nMoyenne either cannot or will not sleep, and is utterly\nunscrupulous in depriving the organism she uses of that\nuninspiring but necessary restorer.\nThe mention of Margaret leads me at once to a com-\nparison which I have been making for many months past ;\nthat between Mrs. Leonard's Control Feda and the Margaret\nPersonality, who usurped such a lion's share of the daily\nlife of the girl whose case is recorded in that valuable\n\f352 (Una) Lady Troubriclge. [PAET\nwork \" The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality.\" ^\nWe will for the present ignore the claim of the author,\nDr. Walter Prince, that Margaret displayed at times\nevidences of clairvoyant or super-normal faculty, and\nrestrict ourselves to the characteristics exclusive of such\na claim in both Margaret and Feda. I have studied the\nDoris Fischer Case rather carefully, and indeed, when I\nfirst obtained it, I was at once struck by the apparent\nlikeness of the Margaret Personality;' described to the Feda\nwith whom I am so familiar.\n^\nFeda and Margaret are both of them very pronounced\nindividualities ; there are few semitones to be observed\nin either of them, a fact which facilitates comparison. It\nmust, however, be recognised that Feda is tame as com-\npared with Margaret. Nevertheless, those characteristics,\nwhich blaze in Margaret with melodramatic force, are\ngenerally observable in a modified degree in Feda. i,\nMargaret in her early stages actively hates and maltreats\nthe unfortunate Doris, and even in her later stages of\nreformation it is clear that Margaret considers the Doris\na poor thing. Feda, on her part, has not a high opinion\nof Mrs. Leonard, and though she will conscientiously, if\nrather obviously against the grain, do her any kindness\nin her power, she never, in my experience, conveys any\nimpression that she likes her. She frequently indeed\nexpresses open scorn of Mrs. Leonard's opinions, likes or\ndislikes, and speaks of her as of a not very satisfactory and\ndistinctly inferior instrument, who must be protected and\nhumoured merely because such as she is, there is none\nbetter to hand. Her instinctive antagonism for Mrs.\nLeonard is repressed, tempered by a certain recognition\nof Mrs. Leonard's good qualities which her honesty will\nnot let her deny, but the antagonism is unmistakably\nthere. Mrs. Leonard, on the other hand, while giving\nFeda full credit for her merits (like Doris, she only learns\nof the other Personality through revelations made to her\n1 This work is familiar to the Members of the Society through Dr.\nT. W. Mitchell's Paper, portions of which were read by him at the\nmeeting of the Society in July, 1919. while the entire Paper has\nsince been published in the Proceedi\/iijs, Vol. XXXI., p. 30.\n\fLxxxiv.] ' Modus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 353\nby other people), undoubtedly bestows upon Feda no\nmore than a rather patronising liking, often obscured by\ndistinct irritation. She resents actively the suggestion\nthat has been made to her by certain spiritualistic sitters,\nto the effect that Feda is her higher self, justifiably\npointing out that her normal self does not share many of\nFeda's childish weaknesses and limitations. The attitude\nof Doris towards Margaret, or so much of Margaret's\ncharacter as she could gauge by the agency of Doctor\nPrince and the letters written to her by Margaret during\nthe latter's periods of manifestation, was very similar.^\nFeda also shares with Margaret a total lack of compre-\nhension and appreciation of the accepted values. Margaret\nbeing told that a painful corn would improve if cut,\nattempted with a table knife to amputate Doris's toe.\nFeda, when a sitter accidentally singes a few hairs of\nher medium's fringe, suggests that were a bonfire made\nof the entire chevelure of Mrs. Leonard, the latter might\nreplace it to advantage by a blonde transformation more\nto Feda's taste. Margaret hacked to pieces Doris's bed,\nreducing Doris to sleeping on a chair. Feda, according\nto Mrs. Leonard, has twice presented to casual sitters\nMrs. Leonard's wedding ring, has once thrown it in the\nfire, from which a distressed sitter rescued it, and once\nordered another sitter to bestow it upon an itinerant\n1 At the time of writing the above, I had in my study of the Doris\nCase confined myself, owing to lack of time, entirely to the two first\nvolumes of that work containing Doctor Prince's Record of the case.\nIt was not until after I had witten this Paper that I found time also\nto examine the third volume in which Doctor Hyslop records his share\nof the investigation. It was, therefore, an interesting surprise to me\nto find that Doctor Hyslop has been as much struck as I was myself\nby the remarkable similarity apparent between certain aspects of so-\ncalled Multiple or Dissociated Personalities, especially as observed in\nthe Doris Case, and examples of alleged spirit controls.\nIt was in consequence of a study of Doctor Hyslop's records that I\nadded the mention of Minnehaha to the examples which I have\nquoted of \" Child Controls.\" If I have in this Paper trespassed upon\nground already marked out by Doctor Hyslop, and in some cases merely\nrepeated what he has said, I know my readers will accept my assurance\nthat I did so before I was aware of what he had written on the\nsubject, and that they will be lenient towards the efforts of a younger\nand less experienced student of Psychical phenomena.\n\f354 {Una) Laxly Tro abridge. [part\norgan grinder. This despite the fact that Mrs. Leonard\nvalues the ring and is superstitious regarding its removal\nfrom her hand. Woe betide Mrs. Leonard, however,\nshould she by accident or intent dispose of, or even\ncontemplate disposing of, any article which Feda regards\nas her own. Just as Margaret visited with fury and\ncondign punishment any attempt on the part of Doris\nto tamper with what Margaret considered hers, and even\nin the last stages of her gradual extinction leapt out to\nthis stimulus after others had ceased to affect her ; so\nFeda exhibits the least regenerate aspects of her nature\nin protecting from any encroachment by the medium any\nobject which she regards particularly as hers. While\nI was well aware that Mrs. Leonard went in fear of un-\npleasant consequences of some sort arising in the event\nof her displeasing Feda, it did not strike me till quite\nlately to ask Mrs. Leonard what exact form those\nconsequences might be expected to take. Mrs. Leonard\nthen informed me that Feda if really annoyed simply did\nnot come ; as sittings under these circumstances could\nnot take place, Mrs. Leonard's means of livelihood were\nthus removed until Feda considered the offence expiated.\nSitters frequently present trifles to Feda, during Mrs,\nLeonard's trance, and it is invariably Feda's habit to\nremark jealously upon such occasions, \" It's Feda's, not\nhers \", or words to this effect. Only if an object\nreally fails to please Feda, is it relegated to Mrs. Leonard\nas being good enough for her. Mrs. Leonard, on the other\nhand, on one occasion when I gave her in the normal\nstate a little ornament promised to Feda, explained to\nme with obvious embarrassment that she must not venture\nto thank me, lest Feda should interpret her doing so as\na claim to the gift.\nI have a record of an incident which brought into\nplay conjointly Feda's ignorance of accepted values, and\nher jealousy regarding any encroachments upon her personal\nproperty. One day, prior to a sitting, Mrs. Leonard\nasked me whether I would beg Feda to allow her to\npresent to a certain poor child, v\/ho had seen and longed\nfor it, a shilling toy which had been given to Feda ; I\n\fLxxxiv.] ' Modvs Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 355\nundertook the embassy, and obtained from Feda a\ndistinctly cold concession to the effect that the child\ncould have Feda's toy, only on condition that Mrs.\nLeonard bestowed her own valuable ruby ring upon a\ncertain young woman in domestic service designated by\nFeda as \" the cook girl \" ; Feda was emphatic that this\nlatter gift should in any case be made. It must also be\nrecorded that on receiving this message, Mrs. Leonard,\nalthough at the time she stopped short of acting upon\nit, was visibly uneasy upon the possible consequences to\nherself involved in the disregard of Feda's behests. Some\nmonths later, on my alluding to the occurrence, Mrs.\nLeonard informed me that, Feda having on several occasions\nsent her further peremptory messages by various sitters\nregarding the ruby ring, she had thought it unwise to\nresist, and had therefore bestowed her ring as directed by\nFeda.\nAnother respect in which Feda resembles Margaret is\nthat a certain delayed infantilism of pronunciation is\ncommon to both. Doctor Prince tells us in his record\nthat in this respect correction never produced upon\nMargaret any lasting improvement, and during the three\nyears that I have sat with Feda, any attempts made by\nher at correcting her verbal idiosyncrasies\u2014attempts\nevoked by the frequent hilarity which they provoke in\nsitters, an amusement which Feda is far from sharing\n\u2014\nhave been very transient. I must, however, mention\none exception. Up to November 9th, 1918, Feda\nhabitually alluded to herself as \" Feda \" ;\nsince then she\nhas maintained with few exceptions the use of the first\nperson singular, and in reply to a question put by me,\nshe informed me that this reformation was accomplished\nwith much difficulty in compliance with a sitter's request.\nBarring this one exception Feda's English, unless she\npurports to be quoting the exact words of a \" Com-\nmunicator,\" is peculiarly her own. For some reason\nunknown she seldom fails to substitute an L for an R\n(a habit which, by the way, she shares with Moyenne),\nand the recorder is occasionally put to it to find intel-\nligible spelling for her impromptu creations. At times\n\f356 (Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\nimmediate comprehension is difficult, and it took me\u2014on\none occasion which I remember\u2014several seconds to\ninterpret the first appearance of Feda's term \" asnenemyn-\nalien \" as applied to a German subject.\nLike Margaret again, she adopts and obstinately clings\nto her own perversions of the names of her acquaintance,\nboth among the living and among the purporting com-\nmunicators. She will spell out or pronounce accurately\nsuch names as \" Johnnie \" or \" Gerald \" or \" Radclylfe,\"\nbut the bearers of these names will none the less remain\nin her vocabulary as \" Twonnie,\" \" Gelly \" and \" Raddy \"\nrespectively, and one is reminded of Margaret's constant\nsubstitution of \" Papo \" for \"Papa.\"\nLike Margaret, Feda is winsome. Incomprehensible as\nit may appear, in view of the certain amount of\napparently incorrect matter which in some sittings fills\nin the gaps between the good and accurate, or merely\nunverifiable matter retailed, Feda has a deep respect for\nthe truth, and to the best of my belief conscientiously\nseeks to be truthful. Nor, in my opinion, are we qualified\nto ascribe conscious mendacity to Feda until we know\nmore of the manner in which impressions reach her, or\nof what means are available to her for the disentanglement\nor classification of the various facts which reach her\nconsciousness. However that may be, she very often\nappears scrupulously anxious to convey only what is\nstrictly accurate, and we may perhaps seek the reason\nfor this in one of her own utterances, when enlarging upon\nher duties as an honest and conscientious control. \" This\nwork is Feda's ploglession, if Feda told lies, Feda wouldn't\nplogless.\" In any case her tender conscience is recog-\nnisably akin to that which led Margaret to tell Dr.\nPrince :\n\" Papo, I think I thunk a lie.\"\nI will be quite irrelevant for a moment and make a\nfrank confession. I love Feda. Neither she nor Margaret\nwould be exactly comfortable folk to live with per-\nmanently, but Doctor Prince also loved Margaret. He\ntells us that her final disappearance left him feeling as\nthough he had lost a loved child ; he informs us that\nher last Will and Testament which he reproduces in his\n\fLxxxiv.] 'Modus Operandi' in Mediumistic Trance. 357\nrecord was duly executed by him so far as was possible,\nand it is quite unmistakable that Doctor Prince mourned\nMargaret. I am thankful that it is not my duty to\nensure Mrs. Leonard's greater advantage by attempting\nto squeeze or suggest Feda out of existence ; I should not\nlike the task.\nI will not here attempt in any detail to go into the\ncomplicated question of how far there is apparent co-\nconsciousness between the normal Mrs. Leonard and her\nvarious psychic lodgers. I will only touch upon the fact\nthat here again there are parallels to be drawn between\nher case and that of Doris Fischer. Mrs. Leonard has\nalmost total amnesia of all that occurs while Feda or any\nso-called personal control holds sway. I use the term\nalmost total amnesia, because Mrs. Leonard states that\noccasionally, especially if she allows herself to sit quiet\nand composed after awaking from trance, isolated names,\nor the impression of some subject or topic, will recur to\nher mind ; and subsequent questioning of a sitter has\nenabled her to ascertain that these fragments were\nmemories of the preceding trance.\nFeda, on her part, claims the option of being au fait,\nwhen she chooses, not only with the thoughts and life of\nMrs. Leonard, but with all that occurs at a sitting during\nthe purporting personal controls. She also claims the\npower to perceive Mrs. Leonard's dreams during the\nlatter's normal sleep. According to Feda's own statements\nshe does not by any means always exercise these powers,\nbut the analogy is there with Doris Fischer, who con-\nsciously remembered nothing of the intervals when\nMargaret or one of her other personalities were demonstrat-\ning, whereas Margaret made good her claim to an almost\nunceasing consciousness, irrespective of whether she was\nmanifesting or submerged, and another personality of the\nDoris Fischer Case, Sleeping Margaret, likewise claimed\noptional co-consciousness.\nOf course, many persons will maintain that, failing\nevidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that in both\nMrs. Leonard's case and that of Doris Fischer all the\npersonalities involved and manifesting through one organism\n\f358 (Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\nare merely different aspects of one and the same individual,\nbut, nevertheless, it appears to me that the two cases in\nthis respect also present analogies that may be worth\nstudying.\nUndoubtedly Margaret possessed and used, not to say\nmisused, the power to compel Doris, from within, to act\nsometimes according to her wishes. In some instances\nDr. Prince makes it clear that Doris was nonplussed and\ndispleased at finding herself performing actions or using\nexpressions foreign to her conscious inclination. Feda\ndoes not claim any extensive power to influence Mrs.\nLeonard in this way, but I was able to verify that upon\none occasion she did so up to a certain point. Feda\nclaimed that having seen and much coveted a yellow air-\nballoon in a Windsor shop, she compelled Mrs. Leonard\nto purchase it ; that on her way home to Datchet Mrs.\nLeonard becoming embarrassed at her childish burden,\nturned aside into a field and gave it as a plaything to\nher Pekinese who, according to Feda, \" sat on it with his\nflont and bursted it.\" Not long after receiving Feda's\naccount of this affair I obtained spontaneously from Mrs.\nLeonard full corroboration of the incident ; Mrs. Leonard\nvolunteering that she could not imagine what impulse had\nled her to buy a silly thing which she was ashamed to\nwalk home with.\nMargaret, though affectionate, was inaccessible to senti-\nment. With the exception of a certain sympathetic\ninterest which she displayed, especially during the middle\nand latter part of her existence, towards the real Doris\nand the other Personality known as Sick Doris, she knew\nnot sympathy for another's troubles. Feda also is\naffectionate and, when dealing with bereaved sitters,\nperfunctorily decorous, while discouraging emotion, but\nthis can only thinly veil her entire lack of emotional\nunderstanding of or sympathy for human sorrow. Upon\none occasion when I visited Feda accompanied by my\nfriend and fellow-worker Miss Radclyffe-Hall, in whose\ncompany I have more often than not visited Feda, and\nwhose loss would deeply pain me, Feda ejaculated with\na hilarious chuckle that it would indeed be fun for me\n\fLxxxiv.] 'Modus Operandi' in Mediumisfic Trance. 359\nwhen, having survived my friend. I should attempt post-\nmortem communication with her through Mrs. Leonard.\nThere is another aspect in which the two, while dis-\nsimilar in attainment, are as one in their desires. Mar-\ngaret, at least during her youth and prime, consistently\ndesired to usurp every possible enjoyable moment of\nDoris's daily life. Avoiding only such periods as were\nfraught with uninteresting routine, or with the painful\nconsequences of her own misdeeds, she voraciously grabbed\nthe consciousness of every available pleasure, even to the\nsugar on top of the cake, which she devoured, granting to\nDoris only the uninteresting remains. Feda's powers of\nusurpation are up to the present very much more cir-\ncumscribed. Constrained to remain submerged unless the\nmedium consciously invites her to come forth, her enjoy-\n- ment when in occupation, her reluctance to end her\nperiods of rule, her resentment when asked to abdicate\ntemporarily in favour of another control are closely\nidentical with Margaret's better realised desires.\nMany more comparisons could be made which would\nstrengthen the case for similarity between Feda and\nMargaret, but space forbids, and the above will suffice.\nThese being made we are left face to face with the\nresidual phenomena associated not only with Feda, but\nwith Mrs. Leonard's psychology as a whole. And this is\na subject that demands a study and treatment far beyond\nmy abilities ; even an adequate summary of the features\nobserved by me wherein Mrs. Leonard's case differs from\nany recorded case of dissociation which I have studied,\nand of the points wherein it offers aspects which may or\nmay not be paralleled in such cases, would be a long\naffair, and one upon which I should fear to embark even\nwere sufficient space at my disposal.\nIn venturing to mention some of what I will merely call\n\" Things that do happen \" during Mrs. Leonard's trance,\nwhich have struck me as possibly significant, and in\nfurther venturing to express here and there an opinion\nas to a possible explanation, I am only presuming upon\nmy extensive experience of Mrs. Leonard's trance, and so\nfar from expecting my opinions to be taken as being of\n\f360 {Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\nimportance, I am exclusively concerned with the hope that\nsomething I may chance to write may awaken the interest\nof persons better qualified than myself to investigate for\nthemselves with useful results.\nIn alluding to my experience of Mrs. Leonard's trance,\nand in discussing the aspects of that trance which appear\nto differentiate her case from the recorded cases of\nMultiple Personality, I must first of all admit that there\nis one trance or semi-trance state, to which Mrs. Leonard\nis apparently subject, of which I have no personal\nexperience at all. I have already mentioned this con-\ndition when enumerating her various states ; it is that\nsemi-hazy condition during which she produces script in\nvarying hand-writing, which has proved on several occasions\nto convey accurate knowledge of contemporaneous or\nrecent events occurring at a distance and normally un-\nknown to the medium. I have seen some of the script\nproduced in this manner, and in alluding to its super-\nnormal value I am relying on the opinion expressed by\nthe recipient of a letter from Mrs. Leonard of which the\nsaid script was a portion. He is a conscientious observer\nof phenomena, and I am quite satisfied that he has made\nall due allowances for chance coincidence or any other\nnormal explanation before ascribing evidential value to\nthe script.\nAs regards the manner of production of this and similar\nscripts, our only authority is Mrs. Leonard herself, as this\nphenomenon occurs only when she is alone, or in her\nhusband's presence, and then only when in the act of\nwriting personal letters to certain individuals. At some\nstage in the writing of such letters, she tells me that her\nhand appears to be controlled, and that, while she remains\nconscious to a certain extent of what is being written,\nshe none the less feels obliged while the impulse lasts\nto continue writing matter conveying no intelligible\nmeaning to her conscious mind. Two or more hand-\nwritings will sometimes be involved in one script, these\ndiffering in some cases notably from the habitual hand-\nwriting of the normal Mrs. Leonard. On one occasion,\nan initial signature appended having led the recipient to\n\fLxxxiv.] '\nModus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 361\nsuspect that the script originated from a particular source,\nI submitted the script in question to the inspection of a\nperson well acquainted with the hand-writing of the\nsuspected deceased author. The hand-writing did not tally\nwith that of the presumed signatory. Nevertheless, it\nwas this actual script which contained an unmistakable\nallusion to events quite outside Mrs. Leonard's normal\nknowledge.\nBefore passing on to the subject of Mrs. Leonard's\ntrance condition as it is generally witnessed by myself\nand the majority of sitters, I desire to point out another\nproblem which awaits solution, and in this respect I wish\nincidentally to put forward a tentative suggestion. If\nMrs. Leonard is in an abnormal state when she produces\nscript, and if we add to this state the trance condition in\nwhich Feda takes the field, have we perhaps in these two\nconditions two different hypnotic levels, namely, a relatively\nlight hypnosis in which the primary consciousness remains\npassively observant, and which is not followed by any\namnesia, and a deep somnambulism followed by almost\ntotal amnesia ? In this latter deep trance the medium,\nwhile displaying all the aspects of a not unfamiliar type\nof secondary personality, is physically to a great extent\nanaesthetic and analgesic, but would appear to be some-\nwhat hyperaesthetic of hearing. In this state also she\ngives evidence of a power of acquiring the knowledge of\nfacts without the assistance of the recognised organs of\nsense.\nIf it be a tenable hypothesis that these two conditions\nrepresent two different hypnotic levels, how then are we\nto classify another state to which Mrs. Leonard is also\nsubject ? I allude to that condition which is familiar\n-\nto only a few of Mrs. Leonard's sitters, and in which,\nwithout any apparent intermediate return to normal\nconsciousness, Feda gives way to that condition which\npurports to be Personal Control by a deceased friend or\nrelation of the sitter. This supposed phenomenon forms\na large part of the repertoire of many inferior mediums,\ndegenerating very often in their case into a kaleidoscopic\nsuccession of completely uninteresting impersonations, none\n\f362 (Una) Lady Trouhridge. [part\nof Avhich are able to put forward anything of interest as\na basis for their claim to any particular identity, and\nmany of which, under the aegis of the most exalted and\nrenowned names, give forth platitudinous prattle emanating\nfrom the hysterical sub-consciousness of the partially\neducated medium.\nIn Mrs. Leonard's case the state in which this personal\ncontrol ostensibly occurs is only witnessed by a very\nfew of her sitters, and seldom by any who have not sat\nwith her regularly during some months. Not long ago\nFeda informed me that not more than half a dozen\nentities had ever controlled Mrs. Leonard, and though\nseveral personal controls have arisen since then, their\nnumber is still, and I trust will remain, very limited.\nIn Mrs. Leonard this condition varies very markedly\nfrom the Feda state, and displays features which suggest\nto me that it is possibly yet another hypnotic level.\nIn it the motor faculties are largely in abeyance. Where\nFeda can sit erect, sway or jerk her body, wave her\narms, move her legs, and has even been known to walk\nabout the room, and where Feda's strident tones are\nfrequently audible outside the seance room, rising if Feda\nbe so inclined to a robust shout, each successive personal\ncontrol in its incipient stages struggles amid silent\nintervals to achieve a barely audible whisper. Movement,\nor indeed anj\/ control of the physical organism, is very\nlimited, and when a personal control is manifesting, the\nmedium generally either lies against the chair like a log\nor flops limply upon the sitter's shoulder. Even a much\npractised personal control achieves but a very limited\ncommand of the organism as regards motion and vocal\nenergy ; it has apparent difficulty in keeping the vertebral\ncolumn erect, and in maintaining an ordinary conver-\nsational volume of tone. The power of mental concen-\ntration appears partially wanting, and immense effort is\nrequired to produce evidential matter which would be\nfreely given by Feda.\nOn the other hand, a totally different faculty is\ndemonstrated, sometimes to a startling degree ; that of\nthe reproduction with varying success of intonations, vocal\n\fLxxxiv.] ' Modus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 363\nmannerisms and general characteristics pertaining to\ndeceased persons whom the medium had never known.\nIt is difficult to convey an accurate impression of\nthese personal controls to anyone who has never wit-\nnessed the production, through the agency of a really\nfine medium, of phenomena of this description. Any\nassertion regarding these impersonations is naturally\nopen to the suspicion that the imagination and ex-\npectation of a witness may play a very considerable\npart in the impression received. There is present in\nnearly all such cases the auto-suggestion that one par-\nticular familiar character is to be personated, and the\nsitter's mind is consciously and unconsciously attuned\nto perceive even accidental or imaginary resemblances.\nOn the other hand, where the purporting personal\ncontrol fails in the attempted impersonation, there is\nalways to hand the excuse that the medium's organism\nis bound to colour and affect to some extent any-\nthing that is received through that organism. Neverthe-\nless, in my own experience these objections have been\ncountered to a great extent by the fact that the purport-\ning personal control with which I am most familiar, that\nreferred to as the A. V. B. Control in the paper on Leonard\nphenomena by Miss Radclyiie-Hall and myself, published\nin the S.P.R. Proceedings, has in the majority of cases\nbeen witnessed by both myself and Miss Radclyffe-Hall,\nwho generally make a habit of accompanying each other\nto Leonard sittings. Under these circumstances it has\nvery often happened that the intonation of some particular\nsentence, or the reproduction of some familiar mannerism\nby the A. V. B. Control, has struck us simultaneously, and\non occasions when I have been the recorder during the\nA. V. B. Control, subsec|uent questioning of Miss Radclyffe-\nHall, before her inspection of the record, has revealed\nthat the points of resemblance which had impressed her\nwere precisely those indicated as remarkable in the record.\nAnother interesting aspect of these personal controls,\nwhich is not demonstrated in the A. V. B. Control but\nwhich I have witnessed on various occasions, is the repro-\nduction with considerable success of a male timbre of\n\f364 (Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\nvoice when the entity purporting to control the medium\nis a man. In my opinion ventriloquism, as frequently\nwitnessed by me in public exhibitions by experts, does\nnot account for this aspect of the Leonard phenomena.\nMr. Arthur Prince, the leading professional ventriloquist\nof our day, whose public performance seldom lasts more\nthan twenty minutes or half an hour, during part of\nwhich time he is speaking in his natural voice, exhibits,\nas his performance proceeds, every sign of the exhaustion\nconsequent upon the execution of a difficult feat. Despite\nthe fact that he must have carefully trained himself to\nconceal all evidences of strain, those evidences are visible ;\nthough he is carefully made up, and quite obviously at\npains to conceal the effort entailed by his performance,\nI have never seen him achieve his turn without the\nperspiration pouring down his face, necessitating the use\nof his handkerchief, and his final bow is that of a man\nwho has worked hard to earn the applause of his public.\nI have in my possession my own record of a Personal\nControl at which I was present some months ago in Mrs.\nLeonard's house at Datchet. Following upon a Feda\nControl of some length, an elderly Scotch gentleman\npurported to control the medium for forty minutes. The\nControl was, as far as my experience goes, an unusually\nstrong one. It spoke throughout most of its duration in\nrobust and fully audible tones of a surprisingly masculine\nquality, interriapted at intervals by paroxysms of coughing\nand wheezing characteristic of the bronchial asthma which\nhad afflicted the gentleman purporting to control during\nhis lifetime. The fits of coughing were very violent, con-\nveying to me the impression of unavailing efforts to\nbreak up accumulations of phlegm obstructing the bronchial\npassages. The entire effect was unquestionably that of\na masculine sufferer, and the timbre of the speaking\nvoice was not only masculine in quality, but gave every\nappearance of acquiring this quality in a normal and\neffortless manner from the larynx. Except for the wheez-\ning, I did not receive any impression of the voice being\nstrained or forced. From this control, lasting, as I have\nstated, forty minutes, Mrs. Leonard awoke to normal\n\fLxxxiv.] 'Modus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 365\nconsciousness in less than one minute. Her face showed\nno signs of perspiration or exhaustion, she entered immedi-\nately into conversation with myself without a trace of\nhoarseness, and appeared as devoid of all cough or chest\nobstruction as she had been before the sitting and\nduring the Feda Control.\nI will now briefly enumerate a few other features\nwherein these Personal Controls differ markedly from the\nFeda Control. Feda's appearance is invariably heralded\nby a few moments of mere quiescence upon the part of\nthe medium, who sits silently with closed eyes until the\nmoment when Feda begins to whisper, then to speak\naudibly, and the sitting commences. The interval which\ndivides the departure of Feda from the appearance of a\npersonal control invariably, in my experience, shows in a\nmore or less marked degree one quite distinct feature.\nFeda having announced her departure, a moment's absolute\nquiescence on the part of the medium is followed by a\nlong and steady exhalation of breath, sometimes prolonged\nto a surprising extent. I have myself compared the effect\nproduced to that which would be obtained by steady\npressure upon a partially unscrewed air-cushion, and it is\nsometimes difficult to understand how any normal lungs\ncan produce an exhalation of such duration. Mrs. Salter\nis familiar with this phenomenon, which she has witnessed\nwith interest on several occasions. I have not so far\nattempted to time this exhalation of breath with a stop-\nwatch, but it might be interesting to do so.\nBoth Miss Radclyffe-Hall and myself are of the impres-\nsion that, when under what purports to be personal control,\nMrs. Leonard's body gradually acquires a dead weight of\ntotal unconsciousness which is absent in the Feda Control,\nbut, of course, in this respect full allowance must be\nmade for the fact that in the case of the A. V. B. Control\nthe sitter is almost invariably partially supporting the\nlimp form of Mrs. Leonard. The sitter therefore becomes\ntired as the control proceeds, and would probably derive\na fictitious impression of the body gradually increasing\nin weight. Another more certainly distinctive feature of\nat least one personal control, namely, the A. V. B. Control,\n\f366 {Una) Lady Trouhridge. [part\nis a pronounced hyperaesthesia of touch affecting the\nfingers, and complained of as being actually distressful.\nFeda, on the other hand, is, as has been said, to some\nextent anaesthetic and analgesic.\nBut the peculiarity of the personal controls which to\nmy mind chiefly suggests their involving a lower hypnotic\nlevel than either the semi-conscious automatic state of\nMrs. Leonard or the Feda state, is the apparent impos-\nsibility of maintaining them for more than a short time,\nand their tendency to merge, in spite of much apparent\neffort and resistance on the part of the complex involved,\neither into the Feda state, or more usually into Mrs.\nLeonard's normally conscious condition.\nIn previously mentioning a personal control lasting\nforty minutes, I alluded to one of the longest I have ever\nwitnessed, and the purporting control in question had\nbeen developed during many months of frequent practice.\nThe A. V. B. Control, also a very fully developed one\nthrough over two years of frequent sittings, has upon\none occasion achieved a record of sixty minutes, but this\nis exceptional. Half an hour is an average duration,\nand incipient personal controls seldom manifest for more\nthan a few minutes, whereas Feda will, if encouraged or\npermitted, chatter on occasion for three hours on end,\nand quite recently has so extended her periods of occupa-\ntion that steps have had to be taken to curtail a length\nof trance considered prejudicial to Mrs. Leonard's health.\nThe personal controls, on the other hand, while conveying\nevery appearance of desiring to remain on the scene,\nare often cut off actually in the middle of a sentence,,\nthe sitter having to remain during the wane of the\ncontrol, alert to catch Mrs. Leonard's body as the final\nspark of animation departs from it, and prop her safely\ninto her chair. LTsually she returns within about one\nminute to normal consciousness, and this after a personal\ncontrol of any duration is invariably the case, but\noccasionally an incipient personal control extending over\na few minutes only will be replaced by Feda prior to the\nmedium's waking. It may be objected that the fact of\nthe personal controls invariably following upon a Feda\n\fLxxxiv.] '\nModus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 367\ncontrol would in itself be sufficient to account for the\ntendency shown by these latter to merge back into the\nprimary consciousness. With a view to ascertaining\nwhether or not this was the case, and whether a personal\ncontrol if allowed to supervene during the early part of\nthe sitting would not contrive to hold the field during\nas long a time as that generally achieved by Feda, Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall and myself upon several occasions persuaded\nFeda to allow the A. V. B. Control to supplant her soon\nafter the commencement of the sitting. The duration of\nthe A. V. B. Control under these circumstances was neither\nmore nor less than is customary on occasions when Feda\nis permitted to remain on the scene for an hour or longer.\nThe A. V. B. Control, having set in with high hopes of\nenjoying an extended period of occupation, began to wane\nas is usual after a certain time, and the only result of\nthe experiment was a considerable curtailment of the\nsittings at which this experiment was tried.\nI will now leave the subject of the personal controls\nand restrict myself to that of the state most frequently\ninvolved in the production of Mrs. Leonard's phenomena :\nthat in which Feda is the agent conveying information.\nMtmbers of the Society for Psychical Research are not\nunfamiliar with this aspect of Mrs. Leonard's phenomena.\nSome of them have actually tested Mrs. Leonard's powers\nfor themselves, and others know of them through Sir\nOliver Lodge's book Ray^nond and through the various\npapers which have been read at the meetings of this\nSociety. I will instance Sir Oliver Lodge's Paper upon\nthe incidents of \" Faunus \" and the \" Group photograph,\"\nMrs. Henry Sidgwick's recent Paper upon the book tests,\nMrs. Salter's Paper upon the results obtained during\nthree months' investigation of Mrs. Leonard's phenomena\nl)y our Society, and the two Papers upon a series of\nLeonard sittings held by Miss Radclyffe-Hall and myself,\nwhich were read before the Society by Miss Radclyffe-\nHall. From these Papers even those members who have\nnever sat with Mrs. Leonard will have attained a general\nidea of what happens during a Feda Control. Bearing\nin mind that the entire object of the sitting is invariably\n\f368 {Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\nthe conveying of evidence for personal survival of bodily\ndeath,1 we note that this aim is approached by many\nmethods. At one time Feda will devote herself to personal\ndescriptions of the appearance of the departed, at another to\npeculiarities of temperament or character which they are\nasserted to have possessed. Incidents in their past lives,\nplaces visited by them either in company with the sitter,\nalone, or otherwise accompanied, articles owned by them,\nassociations grave or humorous shared with the sitter or\nwith other relations or friends, names of communicators,\nnames of their relations or friends living or deceased,\nnicknames used in bygone years, domestic pets formerly\nin their possession and names or characteristics pertaining\nto these, anything, weighty or trivial, tragic or humorous,\nthat the sitter might be expected to recognise or to be\nable subsequently to verify, is considered by Feda as\nmatter worth retailing. Whether it be the memory of a\nbirthmark, or of a scar acquired by accident, or some\ndetail of the final illness, provided it offers features\nsufficiently distinctive to render chance coincidence unlikely,\nall is fish that comes to Feda's net, and with this much\nof her point of view I emphatically agree.\nAnother not infrequent aspect of the phenomena is the\nattempt, sometimes in my experience surprisingly successful,\nto convey a purporting communicator's knowledge of the\nactions and mental processes of persons far distant at the\ntime of the sitting, but in some way connected either by\nrelationship or intellectual or material interest with either\nthe communicator or the sitter. Together with statements\nregarding the actions and mental processes of a certain\nindividual will sometimes be given a prognosis of certain\nevents likely to result from them. In all these very\ndissimilar lines of effort there is a varying degree of\nsuccess and failure, which can be studied to a certain\nextent in the Proceedings of the Society in the various\npapers to which I have alluded ;\nspecial consideration\nshould be given to what is perhaps up to now the\n^ Mrs. Leonard sits for this object and this object only, and never\nconsents to sit with a view to supplying any information materially\nbeneficial to the sitter.\n\fLxxxiv.] '\nModus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 369\nmost ambitious type of phenomena produced by the\nagency of the Feda control, namely, the Book Tests\ndealt with in Mrs. Henry Sidgwick's Paper. It is not\nhere within my scope to attempt any estimate as to the\nextent to which the records of the Feda phenomena,\npublished and unpublished, make good their claim of\neliminating normal knowledge on the part of the medium,\nand in some instances knowledge on the part of\nany person present, or on the part of any person who\ncould reasonably be expected to be in close telepathic\nrapport with any person present at the sitting. It is,\nhowever, admissible to point out that the possibility of\nsuch comprehensive telepathic rapport has never been\nsatisfactorily proved by any experiment, and is so far\nquite as little established as any other hypothesis that\nwe may care to consider.\nI am for the purpose of this Paper only interested in\nthe possibility of obtaining a clue, not as to the source\nwhence the various impressions reach Feda, but as to\nthe manner in which they are impressed upon her con-\nsciousness. And in our enquiry we must always bear\nin mind that throughout the sittings Feda employs a\nvocabulary of very limited extent wherein erudite\npsychological terms have no place. Beyond the\noccasional emergence of such non-committal spiritualistic\nterms as \"I sense \" or \"I get an impression of,\" Feda\nis content to tell the sitter that she \" sees,\" \" hears,\"\n\"feels,\" or \"smells,\" as the case may be, though the\nmedium's eyes are invariably closed and neither the\nsights, sounds, sensations nor smells described are perceptible\nto the sitter.\nNow there are certain aspects of the Feda phenomena\nwhich leave me very doubtful as to whether these simple\nsensory terms convey any accurate analogy with the\nprocesses really involved. In any case, of course, the\nsensory impressions could only be hallucinatory, but even\nwith this reservation there are many instances in connec-\n- tion with which Feda's terminology leaves me dissatisfied.\nOur late President, Doctor L. P. Jacks, has recently\nin our Jourrial opened an interesting discussion regarding\n2 B\n\f370 (Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\nthe origin of the personal descriptions of the appear-\nance of the departed as given by mediums when in\ntrance and particularly by Feda. The point which\nexercised his mind was whether the descriptions given\napproximated to the deceased person's impression or\nmemory of his own appearance before bodily death, to\nhis actual appearance after bodily death, or to the\nsitter's memory of the personal appearance of the\ndeceased. This question remains of great interest, and\none cannot but be glad that attention has been drawn\nto this aspect of the phenomena, and that in this way\nmembers of this Society have been encouraged to con-\ntribute to the Journal any suggestions or hypotheses that\nmay occur to them. But there is another question that\nhas often arisen in my mind while listening to these\ndetailed personal descriptions, and indeed to other detailed\ndescriptions as given by Feda. If we put aside, as I\nhave tried to do throughout this paper, the question of\ntheir source or origin, in what form do they reach or are\nthey presented to Feda ?\nThis problem is one that equally requires consideration\nwhether Feda be taken to be describing a bodily or a\nspiritual actuality, the sitter's memory of a person or\nplace, or someone else's memory of the same.\nIn my experience Feda invariably prefaces her descrip-\ntions with the statement, \" Feda sees \" such an one or\nsuch a thing, or she may say, \" They are building them-\nselves up for Feda,\" or words to that effect, and she\nthen proceeds to describe what she \" sees.\" Thus far\nthe thing is simple, but it becomes sensibly less so when\nafter many months of \" seeing \" A. V. B. regularly once a\nweek and sometimes oftener, she asks one day with\nperfect nonchalance whether A. V. B. ever did her hair in\nthe one and only manner ever adopted by A. V. B., or\nwhen Feda, announcing that A. V. B. is showing her a\npicture, goes on to describe to Miss Radclyffe-Hall with\naccuracy and in great detail a portrait of Miss Radclyjffe-\nHall herself which is now in my possession. Feda\u2014until\nsubsequently questioned by me, at the termination of the\ndescription of the picture\n\u2014\nsees this picture. She tells.\n\fLxxxiv.] ' Modus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 371\nus of its colouring, of the pose of the figure and hands,\nthat the expression is serious, even, she avers, what she\nterms \" soosillious.\" She further tells Miss Radclyffe-Hall\nthat the subject of the portrait is a pale, interesting-\nlooking woman, though young in years, and that the\npicture is a striking one that Miss Radclyffe-Hall would\nlook at more than once, and that A. V. B. likes the said\npicture, but Feda, who sees this picture and is able to\ndescribe it at such length, never apparently for a moment\ngrasps the fact that the picture being described by her\nis a portrait, and a striking resemblance at that, of the\nvery familiar sitter to whom she is speaking. Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall, I am compelled to state, emphatically\ndenies having telepathically assisted Feda in her descrip-\ntion of the portrait !\nIt is such incidents as I have described above that\nhave led me to suspect that in many instances where\nFeda describes persons and objects, she uses the term\n\" seeing \" merely as a habit of speech, and that the\nprocess involved may more likely be a series of impressions\nreceived by her telepathically one at a time, or collected\nby her telepathically one by one from some mind incarnate\nor discarnate as the case may be.^ This hypothesis\nwould also account for the manner in which the descrip-\ntions are often dealt out, bit by bit, conveying to the\nrecipient or listener the impression of someone finding\nisolated pieces all connected with one jig-saw puzzle and\ndealing them out one by one with a view to their being\nfitted together by the recipient into an intelligible whole.\nIt is surely incredible that Feda or anyone else should\nsee a person minus their most striking peculiarity of\nfeatures or colouring, and yet this must frequently be\npresumed to be the case if Feda's seeing is to be accepted\nat face value. I have myself known her purport to see\nclearly a communicator whose appearance she minutely\ndescribed, giving a perfectly accurate account of his\nfeatures, complexion, expression, including the fact that\n1 A further instance which appears to support this hypothesis will be\nfound in Mrs. Salter's \" Further Report on the Phenomena of Mrs.\nLeonaid,\" Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxxii., p. 87 ff.\n\f372 (Una) Lady Troubridge. I [part\nhe was remarkably handsome and struck her as having\nwhat she most evidentially described as \"a clear look,\"\nbut she remained to all appearance in ignorance that the\nmost distinguishing features of his appearance were pre-\nmaturely snow-white hair of remarkable abundance, and\neyes of a peculiarh^ vivid blue.\nFeda's alleged hearing is open to the same criticism\nand question. Mrs. Leonard's hearing as her sight, when\nin the normal state, is good to an average degree. She\nclaims that just before a sitting when, as she would put\nit, she \" feels Feda about,\" she acquires a marked hyper-\naesthesia of hearing, and this claim is corroborated by\nher husband, but has not otherwise been tested. It\nmay, however, be remarked that Mrs. Leonard told me\nof this hyperaesthesia of hearing when asking me to warn\nprospective sitters, whom I accompanied to her house as\nrecorder, against mentioning to me any evidential matter\nafter entering the house. Mrs. Leonard said she feared\nthat she might inadvertently overhear them, even\nthough there might be several walls between her and the\nspeaker.\nTo return, however, to the subject of Feda's hearing.\nThis appears, as regards mundane matters, to be rather\nspecially acute. She will often notice and draw a sitter's\nattention to such sounds as a distant aeroplane or church\nbell which, though audible when attention is drawn to\nthem and they are listened for in silence, would not\nreach the consciousness of the sitter or recorder through\nthe more insistent sound of Feda's conversation. When,\nhowever, Feda claims to \" hear \" names or words spoken\nby the purporting communicators, her hearing appears to\nbe much less reliable, if indeed \" hearing \" be not yet\nagain her conventional word for some inexpressible means of\nperception. She will claim that a communicator is telling\nher a certain name, she will lean forward in her chair\nwith her head inclined as though concentrated upon\nlistening to some dimly apprehended sound, she will\nwhisper to herself attempted equivalents, and she will\noften abandon of her own accord the attempt to hear,\nand will resort to drawing one by one, with her finger in\n\fLxxxiv.] ' Modus Operandi ' in Mediumistic Trance. 373\nthe air, or perhaps upon the sitter's sleeve, letters that\nshe avers are being \" written \" or \" built up \" by the\ncommunicator for her to see. Sometimes she will not\nawait the completion of a word by this process, but\nhaving spelt up one syllable or two will suddenly remark,\n\" Oh, it's such and such a name.\" Sometimes, on the\nother hand, she will write up the entire word letter by\nletter, before she makes any attempt to utter it. But\neven then, it is not always the word as it would be\nphonetically pronounced from the written letters that she\nutters. Having written up a word accurately she will\non occasion pause, as though listening, and pronounce the\nword, which in some cases may be a foreign one or some\nnickname unfamiliar to her, with a correct though perhaps\nunusual emphasis on a given syllable.\nOn one occasion I remember a somewhat similar\noccurrence when, having written up the letters R.U.N.E.,\nas the pet name of a dog, she remarked that the com-\nmunicator, however, was not saying Rune, but Runie,\nand both variants of the name were accurate. Yet Feda\nappeared unable to hear either until she had gone through\nthe process of spelling up the separate letters of the\nformer variant.\nWithout going further into the question of the examples\nthat have struck me, I will merely say that I am as\ndoubtful of the face value of what Feda terms \" hearing\n\"\nas I am of that of her alleged \" seeing.\"\nThere is another aspect of the phenomena which in\nmy opinion points to a succession of mental impressions\ntelepathically conveyed in the form of isolated facts from\nsome source to the medium's mind. Be they alphabetical\nletters, a name or word, or the description of a scene\nor of a mental state, I have often received a strong\nimpression that as a description proceeded Feda knew as\nlittle as I did what would be the next brick in the\nedifice. She will often hazard an unlikely but correct\ndetail with every appearance of diffidence, in an apologetic\nmanner seeming to discount expected ridicule or expostu-\nlation from the sitter. She will make an accurate state-\nment regarding some unlikely detail and go on to comment\n\f374 {Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\non the possibility of her not having correctly apprehended\nthis particular point. Sometimes, it is true, her\ndescriptions are such as might be given by a person\ncontemplating an individual, a scene, or a picture, and\nrecounting as they came to her notice the various details\nobserved, but often the impression conveyed suggests an\nentirely different process.\nThis is especially the case when, as occasionally happens,\nwe meet with examples of compound descriptions. That\nis to say, when Feda gives us a personal description of\none individual combining the characteristics of two or\nmore persons known to the sitter, who have borne the\nsame surname or who have some point of similarity in\nappearance or circumstances, or when a communicator is\nmade to describe as one event matters occurring upon\ntwo or more occasions of a rather similar nature.\nIf we accept as possible that the facts retailed to us\nby Feda are either projected on to her brain, or are\ncollected hj her from some other mind incarnate or\ndiscarnate, then it would seem possible that the clarity\nof the impressions largely depends upon the conscious or\nunconscious faculty of concentration in the mind tapped\nor conveying the facts.\nFor convenience' sake we will at this point postulate an\nintentional communicator, either living or dead. Although\nthe evidence so far obtained for telepathy between the\nliving leaves it an open question whether or no concen-\ntration by the agent upon the idea to be conveyed\nmilitates for or against success \u2014and indeed the experi-\nments recorded in Mr. Hubert Wales' recent Paper would\nappear to show that in his case the impressions which\nreached Miss Samuels were in no case those which he had\nconsciously tried to convey \u2014nevertheless, it must not be\noverlooked that Feda definitely claims that the purporting\ncommunicators not only throughout the sittings exert\nevery faculty to impress her with those particular incidents\nor facts which they desire to convey, but she constantly\nstates that in many cases they utilise the intervals between\nsittings for the preparation of what they shall say when\nthe sitter arrives.\n\fLxxxiv.] ' Modus O'perandi '\nin Ilediumistic Trance. 375\nWhile admitting the possibility that the process is\nquite other, and that Feda merely selects from some\nsource the facts which, independent of the communicator's\nconsciousness, happen to be the most accessible to her\npercipience, we must nevertheless admit that her own\ndescription of the method employed may be the more\ncorrect ; and indeed I think the phenomena as I have\nobserved them tend to support her statements. Even\nremarkably successful telepathic experiments, such as those\nrecorded by Mr. Wales, are of a fragmentary, scrappy\nnature such as might credibly be the result of a per-\ncipient fishing in the agent's unconscious mind for any\navailable small fry of fact that may take the bait. I\ndo not think experimental telepathy has ever obtained\nthe transfer of a lengthy consecutive description of some\nincident or event entailing divers names, details and\nmemories, such as are not infrequently given by Feda.\nIt is difficult to conceive that Feda, having tapped\nin some unconscious mind a bare fact concerning some\nmemory or event, could continue for perhaps nearly an\nhour weeding the unconsciousness of the said mind and\nselecting for repetition only such mental material as\nwould bear upon the theme selected. I confess that I\nfind it easier, at any rate in the case of the lengthy and\ndetailed descriptions pertaining to one topic, to conceive\nof them as emanating intentionally and consciously from\nsome agent having to some extent the power to choose\nwhat impressions shall or shall not reach Feda.\nUpon this hypothesis it would appear that, so long as\nthe communicator can keep some given portion of his\nmind exclusively upon the one fact or event which he\ndesires to give or describe as evidence, Feda's descriptions\nwill be relatively clear and accurate. Should, however,\nthe communicator's mind wander ever so little, his irrele-\nvant thought will be as likely to reach Feda as any thought\nrelevant to the subject in hand, and when it does so will\nappear in some form in her narrative. Feda apparently\ncannot always disentangle relevant from irrevalent impres-\nsions, nor does it always appear as though the hypo-\nthetical communicator were aware of the exact extent\n\f376 {Una) Lady Troubridge. [part\nto which his unintentional thoughts may be conveyed to\nher.\nSupposing, for instance, I, being deceased, wished to\ndescribe through Feda my country residence and its\ngarden with ornamental pond, and that I should allow\nthe thought to cross my mind that upon some particular\noccasion friends came down to view the garden who had\nadmired the pond and particularly enjoyed a good supper\nof lobster salad, I might easily appear in Feda's utterances\nas a demented spirit who asserted that I had owned an\nornamental pond in which I kept lobsters and grew\nsalad ! I have known an improbability of this kind\nfollowed by indications denoting excitement on the part\nof the communicator. I have known this excitement\neither bewildering Feda, or being interpreted by her as\ndenoting the spirit's eagerness to emphasize that the\nunlikely statement is correct, and I have been unable to\nresist picturing myself as an unfortunate communicator fully\nable to gauge the extent to which my communication had\ngone wrong, and making matters worse by conveying tele-\npathically an unintelligible chaos of excitement and dismay..\nSometimes the compound description is not difficult\nto unravel, and an example of this kind occurred during\none of the sittings taken by Miss Radclyffe-Hall which I\nrecorded. The purporting communicator known as A. V. B.\napparently wished to describe one or two experiences of\na religious nature which she had undergone during her\nlifetime, and during her friendship with Miss Radclyffe-\nHall. It remains doubtful to this day whether the event\nwhich it was intended to describe was a private audience\nwith the Pope at the Vatican which A. V. B. had some\nyears before her death, or a Retreat made by her at a\nconvent shortly before she died. Features recognisable as\nbelonging to both these occurrences appeared in the\ndescriptions given by Feda, although all the points given\nwere said to be in connection with one event. Granted\nthe possibility that all these details were being obtained\nfrom the mind of the supposed communicator, I can\nhardly conceive her having been able to think of one\nof these events without also, however involuntarily, being;\n\fLxxxiv.] ' Modus Operandi '\nin Mediumistic Trance. 317\nreminded of the other. A. V. B. was not a woman\ngiven to constant religious practices. She was a good\nCathoKc, but not excitable about her religion, and the\ntwo events of which we have spoken were in many-\nyears the only two striking events of her life closely-\nassociated with the ceremonial of the Roman Catholic\nChurch. There were many points of similarity between\nthe two events, such, for instance, as the wearing of a\nspecial black dress and veil, benedictions received, a\ncertain amount of mental and spiritual preparation in-\nvolved, which might easily, had the communicator lived\nto be very old, have become confused in her own mind\nwhilst alive ; it would not, therefore, be surprising if any\nattempt to convey one or other event by a telepathic\nprocess, or by any indirect process, should result in\nconfusion of the two events.\nOccasionally, if the topic touched upon should be one\nin which Mrs. Leonard is herself interested, figments of\nher own opinions and associations will also intrude,\nrendering the compound yet more complex.\nI remarked an instance of this type of triple compound\nduring a sitting at which I recorded for our former\nPresident, Doctor L. P. Jacks. He has already in a\npublic utterance alluded, though in a somewhat disguised\nmanner, to this occurrence, bvit he neglected to mention\nthe following circumstance. The compound entity pro-\nduced by Feda of an old and a j^oung man, who both\nbore the same surname, but although related to each other\ndiffered widely in their circumstances, and at a later\nsitting were disentangled correctly as two separate persons,\ncontained at the earlier sitting elements of yet another\nbearer of the same surname. The origin of this last\nintrusion was in my opinion Mrs. Leonard's not entirely\ndormant association of the surname in question with a\ncelebrated young author killed in the War, whose Christian\nname, quite dissimilar from that of either of the two\nother entities involved in the compound, was murmured\ndoubtfuUj^ several times by Feda.\nThere are many other instances which I could quote\nas examples of \" Things which do happen \" in Mrs..\n\f378 {Una) Lady Troubridge. [part Lxxxiv.]\nLeonard's trance, and indeed in the trance of any genuine\nmedium, whether producing mental or physical phenomena,\nand which call for an explanation not as yet forthcoming,\nbut I think the examples which I have already given\nsuffice for my purpose.\nThat purpose is to urge upon all and any who may\nbe actual or potential workers in the field of Psychical\nResearch my conviction that there is a wide field for common\nwork between those who regard the observed phenomena\nas pointing to survival of bodily death, those in whose\nopinion these phenomena tend to disprove it, and those\nwho genuinely keep an open mind. Whatever may be\nthe ultimate possibilities of establishing a scientific solution\nof this all-important problem, there is in the meantime\nno lack of work that should be acceptable to any unpre-\njudiced person interested in the subject, none being able\nto foresee whither the study of the modus operandi involved\nwill lead.\n\fREVIEW\nPsychology and Psychotherapy. By William Brown, M.A.,\nM.D. (Oxon), D.Sc. (Lond.). London : Ed-\\vard Arnold,\n1921. Pp. xi, 196.\nCollected Papers on the Psychology of Phantasy. By Dr.\nConstance E. Long.

London : George Allen and LTnwin, Ltd. 1920.\nPp. 283.\nThe three books at the head of this notice are a selection\nfrom many, dealing with similar topics, which have apj^eared\nduring the last two years. They are all concerned with new\noutlooks in psychology which have grown out of the pioneer\nwork of Freud. None of the writers is a true Freudian, yet\neach of them has been greatly influenced by Freud's \"writings,\nand each of them accepts some of the conclusions at which he\nhas arrived.\nDr. Brown's attitude towards Freudian doctrine is of\nparticular interest because he was one of the first academic\npsychologists in this country to give sympathetic consideration\nto the views of the psycho-analysts and to expound their\nteachings. In pre-war days one felt that Dr. Brown was more\nfavourably disposed towards Freud's views than in this book\nhe shows himself to be, and it is permissible to think that his\npresent standpomt has been arrived at largely as a result of\nhis practical experience of the war neuroses. Like some other\neminent psychologists who had an opportunity of observing\nand treating cases of shell-shock,\" Dr. Brown readily accepts\ncertain important tenets of the psycho-analytic school such as,\n379\n\f380 Review [part\nfor example, Freud's \" theory of the cause of mental disso-\nciation, viz., that it is the result of mental conflict and involves\nrepression of emotional states \" ; but he cannot fully subscribe\nto the libido theory of the neuroses and therefore does not call\nhimself a Freudian.\nOn the psychological side Dr. Brown gives a good, although\nnecessarily brief, account of the theory of dissociation and an\nexposition of Freud's theory of dreams and of the Unconscious.\nIn a chapter on \" Theories of Emotion,\" he contrasts the\nviews of Ribot, Shand and M'Dougall with \" Freud's theory\nof instinct.\" The latter he considers vague and incomplete,\nand he thmks it suffers from lack of historical relationship\nAvith the work of expert psychologists. Not, however, until he\ntakes up the psychotherapeutic aspect of his subject do we\nclearly realize the distance which separates Dr. Brown's views\nfrom those of the psycho-analysts ; and yet the method of\ntreatment which he considers \" the most helpful therapeutic\nprocess in dealing with the majority of war psychoneuroses\n\"\nis the method which formed the historical starting point of\npsycho-analysis. This is the method of '\nabreaction '\n\u2014the\nprocess of working off repressed emotion during hypnosis\n\u2014\ndevised by Breuer forty years ago and described in these\nProceedings by Frederic W. H. Myers as far back as 1894.\n{S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. IX., p. 12.)\nDr. Brown's record of the efficacy of abreaction in the\ntreatment of the war neuroses is very interesting and instruc-\ntive ; for with the development of Breuer's method in the hands\nof Freud, and the extension of the original theory of the\ncausation of hysteria, the peculiar value of abreaction tended to\nbe lost sight of, and not much corroboration of the early work\nof Breuer and Freud has been afforded by subsequent observers.\nDr. Brown tells us that his most striking results were\nobtamed by means of abreaction during light hypnosis. He\ndoes not, however, make clear what he means by light hyp-\nnosis ; and this he should have done seeing that he gives\nexpression to somewhat heterodox opinions on the relation\nbetween suggestion and hypnosis. He does not accept those\ndegrees of hypnosis, ranging from slight somnolence to profound\n\" sleep,\" which have been universally recognized by followers\nof the Nancy School. For him hypnosis begins at the stage\n\fLXXXIV.] Review 381\n^'\nwhen the memory continuum of the patient is broken\nacross,\" and this he regards as \" a psychological phenomenon\nquite distinct from that of suggestibihty and calling for a\ndistinct explanation.\"\nBy most authors this stage is regarded as just the point\nat which light hj^pnosis ends and deep hypnosis begins, so\nthat when Dr. Brown speaks of light hypnosis he must be\nreferring to a grade or degree of what is more commonly\ncalled deep hypnosis or somnambulism. And indeed Dr. Brown\nagrees with Janet that hypnosis is the reproduction of an\nhysterical somnambulism in an hysterical subject. But if\nthat be so it is difficult to understand how Dr. BroAvn could\ncontrol the depth of the hjrpnosis so as to ensure that it was\n\" light.\" Whether it was \" hght \" or \" deep \" would depend\non the degree of dissociation accompanying the original\n\" hysterical \" somnambulism whose reproduction was brought\nabout by the hypnotising process.\nAccording to Dr. Brown there are four fundamental and\nrelatively independent i:)sychic factors at work in the cure of\nmental illness. These are (1) psycho-synthesis or re-association\nof the forgotten memories ; (2) psycho-catharsis or abreaction ;\n(3) autognosis\u2014a term introduced by Dr. Brown to indicate\na method devised by him which seems to be a mixture of\nanalysis, .suggestion, persuasion and re-education ; and (4) the\npersonal influence of the physician (suggestion). The last of\nthese four he rightly considers of the utmost importance\n\" since it is a determining condition of the effective working\nof the other three factors.\"\nIn Part IV. of this book, under the headmg \" Lessons of\nthe War,\" Dr. Brown gives an interesting account of his\npersonal experience in the treatment of war neuroses both in\nthe field and in the hospitals at home. The heading of this\nsection is perhaps misleading, for it may suggest that what is\nhere written contams new knowledge concerning the cause or\nthe cure of the psychoneuroses. But it is notorious that in\nno department of medicine has less advance been made as a\nresult of war experience than in psychopathology and psycho-\ntherapeutics. All the methods used in dealing with the\nneuroses of the war had already been in everyday use in the\ntherapeutics of pre-war days. What the war did was to\n\f382 Review [part\nincrease enormously the number of people acquainted with the\ntheory and practice of psychotherapeutics, but in no direction\ndid it lead to any important addition to our knowledge of\nthese matters.\nThe last few pages of the book a.re devoted to Psychical\nResearch. Although Dr. Brown seems to be favourably in-\nclined towards the scientific investigations into Spiritism he\nwishes to sound a note of caution,\n\u2014\" to suggest that all this\nborders very closely on the realm of pathological psychology,\nand that in such investigations you need to be quite sure that\nthe mind concerned is a normal one . . . that the states\ndescribed are not simply pathological mental states, rather\nthan something that is completely normal.\" Dr. Brown here\nseems to be harbouring a very common misconception regarding\nthe kind of evidence that is relevant and important in\nPsychical Research. To expect mediumistic phenomena to\noccur in a mind that is \" completely normal \" is almost a\ncontradiction in terms ; but whether the state of a medium's\nmind is one of normality or abnormalitj^ is surely quite irre-\nlevant and unimportant so far as the supernormality of the\nmanifestations is in question. As I wrote, in a former contri-\nbution to these pages : \"In regard to supernormal phenomena\nit does not matter in the least what the term hysteria may\nconnote. The supernormality of an automatic script has to\nbe determined by other considerations than the psychological\nstate of the aiitomatist. If it can be shown that any hysteric\nreally has the gift of clairvoyance or any other supernormal\npower, it will be just as good evidence as if he were a normal\nperson. If physical objects do move without contact in the\npresence of anyone who is said to be hysterical, it is just as\nwonderful as if they so move in '\nthe jDresence of some one\nwho is not.\" {S.P.B. Proceedings, Vol. XXVI., p. 275.)\nDr. Constance Long's Collected Papers on the Psychology of\nPhantasy are a series of essays in that \" Analytical Psy-\nchology \" which was founded by Jung, and they afford some\nindication of the lines along which Jung has departed from the\nFreudian position. Written in bright and non-technical\nlanguage, suited to the lay audiences to which most of them\nwere delivered, these papers x^ossess the advantages and clis-\n\fLXXXIV.] Review 383\nadvantages which such a mode of exposition entails. They\nare full of interest and information which cannot fail to be\nhelpful to those who come to the study of these topics for\nthe first time, but they sometimes lack the precision of\nlanguage which the serious student of the subject demands.\nThus, for example, on the second page \" the unconscious \" is\ndefined as \" all that exists in the psyche, of which we are not\naware at a given moment. . . . The unconscious, the sub-\nconscious, or the subliminal (as it is called by different authors)\ncontains all our memories from our earliest existence to the\npresent.\" On page 16 it is said :\n\" The unconscious mind is\npre-existent to the conscious mind. It is a racial possession,\ncommon to all, and is not acquired during the life-time.\" On\npage 77 we read : \"I shall use the word '\nunconscious '\nin the\nsense introduced by Freud.\"\nThese statements taken by themselves are misleading and\nincompatible one with another ; and although no one who\nreads Dr. Long's book from the beginning to the end need\nhave any doubts about her views on \" the unconscious,\"\nnevertheless the persistent use of the same term in so many\ndifferent senses must j^ro^^\u00a9 confusing to many readers.\nIt is needless, here, to describe in detail or to criticise the\ndoctrines put forward by Dr. Long. They are a faithful\nexiDosition, so far as they go, of the teachmgs of Jung, and\nour opinion of their theoretical and practical importance will\ndepend on the judgments we may have formed regarding\nJung's views as these are presented to us in the fuller exposi-\ntions afforded by his own works. As an introduction to the\nviews of the Ziirich school this book can be confidently recom-\nmended, and on the practical side it will be found to contain\nmuch acute observation and sound advice.\nPerhaps the woist thing about Mr. Tansley's book, The New\nPsychology, is its title. Over a quarter of a century ago there\nwas a \" new psychology \" from which much was expected\n\u2014\nthe so-called \" experimental psychology '\"\n; but it is now\ncommonly admitted that, as Mr. Tansley says, much of the\nadmirable work done in this field is not investigation of the\nmind at all but merely a department of physiology. There\nis already some danger that a somewhat similar fate may\n\f384 Review [part lxxxiv.]\novertake the New Psychology of to-day if we stress too much\nthe newness of it. Dr. Long tells us in her preface to the\nPsycliology of Phantasy, that a candid friend, who is an\na^cademic psychologist, bade her refrain from using such a title,\nsaying that the book had nothing to do with psychology.\nThere is the less justification for the adoption of such a\ntitle as Mr. Tansley has chosen in that his avowed aim is to\npresent a picture of the structure and Avorking of the normal\nhuman mind which combines the biological view of the mind\n\u2014as represented, for instance, in Dr. M'Dougall's well-known\nIntroduction to Social Psychology\u2014with the concepts which we\nowe mainly to Freud and Jung. It is not, therefore, a new\npsychology which Mr. Tansley presents to us, but the old\npsj'chology as it is modified by certain facts discovered by the\npsychopathologists\n.\nBoth Dr. Brown and Dr. Long, in the books under review,\nare occupied with joarts of the same subject-matter as Mr.\nTansley deals ^^ith, but both the former writers very largely\nrestrict themselves to the domain of psychopathology and\npsychotherapeutics. Mr. Tansley takes a wider outlook and\nendeavours to point out the consequences of applying the new\ndoctrines in the psychology of the normal, and to indicate\nthe bearing of these doctrines on all the problems and activities\nof human life.\nThis is assuredly a work which is necessary, but it is\ndoubtful if the time is yet ripe for its satisfactory performance.\nMany of the new views are of so tentative a character and so\nliable to revision in the light of fresh facts, that any attempt\nto incorporate them in a systematic exposition of the \" science\nof human life \" is ajDt to lead to errors which time and\nfui'ther knoAvledge would have eliminated. Nevertheless, Mr.\nTansley's attempt to do this necessary Avork here and now is\na notable achievement, and no student of contemporary psy-\nchology can afford to disregard this book.\nT. W.
