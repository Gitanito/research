I\nbelieve I prooured a new planchette for her, but that I cannot say for\ncertain. I know the planchette we used was a new one. After dinner we\nwere in the drawing-room, and Mrs. --, mother of the young lady,\nwas sitting some little di.tance off, and I think her two brothers dropped in\nfrom the dining-room whilst we had our hands on the instrument, but were\nnet near us, or in any way assisting. I was only willing to use planchette\nfor the satisfaction of the young lady, and would not allow any but a trivial\nquestion to be put to it, and proposed that we should ask\" whetherit would\nbe fine to-morrow,\" to-morrow being Sunday. I forget whether the instru-\nment ran about at all, but when we lifted it up the writing faced me, and I\nN 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical .Research.

Arthur\" if we aaked a question about the\nweather. I was at once motioned to silence by my fellow-operator, who\ncould not be induced to touch the planchette again, and looked uneaaily in\nthe direction of her mother.\nOn my retiring with her to put on my wraps before leaving the house,\nshe confided to me that my distinct pronunciation of the word Arthur waa\nvery unfortunate (or rather that it should have been written), for Arthur\nwaa a forbidden admirer of this lady's, and she had a rendezvous with him at\nchurch the next day, if fine. I believe that no impreuion waa made on the\nmamma, and that it waa fine the next day, or as plancllette observed,\nsummarising, it waa \" Arthur.\"\nH. POWBit.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SocmTY FOR PSYCHIOAL RBnAROH.\nSIR,-Though I occupied so much of your space last month, you will, I\nam sure, allow me room for a short reply to your notes on my letter.\nI mistook, it seems, one Mr. Lewis for another, and carelessly wrote\n\" Spiritual\" for\" Spiritualistic,\" and of course I ought not to have done so,\nthough the mistl\\kes do not to any appreciable extent affect the substance of\nwhat I wrote. I supposed, and perhaps not unnaturally, that Mr. Lewis\nmust have been more than an ordinary observer, since his evidence\nwas given in your Jounl4l as a set off to that of hundreds of ordinary\nobservers on the other side. And I think it is probable that the mistake led\nme to attach more importance to his letter than I should have done if I had\nnot made it.\nHowever, the Mr. Lewis who I supposed had written the letter and whom\nI spoke of aa a \"profeuional\" conjurer (it seems incorrectly), is at least a\nconjurer of some BOrt, and adds\" prof88Sor\" to his pseudonym of Hoffman.\nHe has also written several books on conjuring and magic, and may therefore\nbe looked upon as at leaat a \"clever conjurer,\" if not a prof88Sional one.\nMr. Davey has communicated to him alao \"the detailB of his methods,\" and\ntherefore my proposal that he should perform Mr. Davey's\" tricks,\" not\nbefore select witncues but in public, may fairly remain unchanged.\nI omitted what you call \u2022\u2022 the essential clause\" in that sentence of y,)urs\nwhich I quoted, or \"misquoted,\" as you say, viz., \"so far aa professional\nmediumship is concerned\"; and I did so simply because it seemed to me of\nno importance whatever to the point which I wished to insist on. The point\nwas that, even though it could be proved that Eglinton did his wonders by\ntrickery, it would not follow that young girlB and uneducated women did\ntheir wonders by trickery too; and it will not matter in the leaat to the\nargument whether those females be professional or non-professional.\nAs to young girl mediums, my evidence is what baa been before the\npublic for years. Mrs. Jencken waa a writing medium when she waa quite\na girl, and sometimes too in a language of which she herself knew nothing.\nThen, is not Mr. Theobald's maid servant the medium in whose presence\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1887.] Jowrnal of Society fen- Psychical .Re8earch. 169\nwriting is done in all sorta of places, approachable and unapproachable by\nhuman fingers 1 These and many similar caaea have been recorded in scores\nof publications and are believed by thousands, lOme 88y by millions, and as\nlong as this is 80, I cannot see what you would gain even if you succeeded in\nshowing Eglinton to be a mere impostor.\nBut perhaps I may al80 remind you that you will have to account for\nmore than his alate tricks before you have done BO. If we are to believe\nhuman testimony at all, scores of persons have seen and conversed with their\ndeceased relations and friends in his presence. Was this done by trickery\ntoo 1 If so, then Mr. Eglinton is undoubtedly the most wonderful man of\nthe age, and what motive he can possibly have for palming the feats of his\nown unexampled cleverneaa on unseen intelligences passes my power to\nimagine. You might as well argue, and indeed with far more show of reaaon,\nthat BOrne unprincipled knave wrote the plays of OthtlJ,o, J'IIlit1.3 Quar, King\nLear, Hamlet, &c., and then heartleBBly palmed them on an innocent and\nunoffending person called William Shakespeare.-I am,10urobedient servant,\nGEORGE HARPUR.\n[Mr. Harpur still seemB to be in BOme confusion about ProfeBBor Carvill\nLewis. That gentleman has never written anything in the JoornaJ\" and\nif Mr. Harpur will look at his \"Account of some 8O-called Spiritualistic\nSeances\" in the Proceedings, he will preceive that it was not published\nbecause Profes80r Lewis speaks with any special authority, but simply\nbecause he succeeded in detecting Eglinton in trickery.\nIt is disappointing to find that Mr. Harpur's previous reference to\n\"girls of 14\" who \"can write in locked slates answers to questions\nwhich they have never heard or scen and in languages which they don't\nunderstand,\" reduces itself to an allusion to the published evidence about\nMrs. J encken and Mr. Theobald's servant, who have neither of them,\n. 80 far as I am aware, written in locked slates at the age of 14 or\nsince. It would obviously take too long to diacuBB the evidence for these\ntwo mediums here, and I will therefore only say that it appears to me to\nbe inconclusive.\nIf Mr. Harpur studies American Spiritualistic literature, he will find\nthat Eglinton's materialisation seances are not 80 unique as he seemB to\nthink. The evidence for them is much the same as that for the\nmaterialiaations of some detected impostors in that country-see, for\ninstance, accounts of recent exposures of Mrs. Ross and Mrs. Wells, of\nwhich accounts may be found in the Religio-Phil080phical JO'I.I\/r'IW.Z for\nFebruary, March, and April of this year. That Mr. Eglinton, too, has\nbeen detected in palpable trickery ill materialisations is well known to\nreaders of our Journal (see Journal, Vol. II., pp. 282-284). Supposed\nrecognition of departed relatives and friends in a so-called materialised\nspirit is by no means always a satisfactory test of its genuineneBB.\nAs an instance of this, I may refer to Colonel Bundy's account of\nhow a certain Mrs. H.; sitting not more than 18 inches from the\ncurtain, recognised as her mother-in-law what was to Colonel Bundy's\neyes the unmistakable maaculine and moustached face of the medium\n(see Religio-Phil08ophical Journal, for September 9th, 1882).\nDigitized by Google\n\f170 JO'lJ\/1\"\u00a5ULl of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1887.\nMr. Harpur's BOmewhat singular explanation as to how he camo to\nmisquote what I Baid in the Proceeding. seems to show that he is still\nunder the impression that my object was to make out a case against\nSpiritualism. I can only repeat that my object in calling attention to\n.spurious phenomena is simply to purge the evidence brought forward for\nSpiritualism, as far as may be, of all that depends on fraud and\nimposture.-ED.]\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PsYC!UCAL RESEARCH.\nDEAR SIR,-I remember the visit of Messrs. Witherby and Fry at the\nrooms of the Spiritual Lyceam (not Alliance, as stated by Mr. Witherby),\nand the chief topics of our conversation. As far as my recollection goes,\nthe statements which Mr. Witherbyalltributes to me in his letter, are 1ler!\/\nnearly those I made that evening, He\u00b7 baa, however, twisted them a little\nout of their original shape to suit his fancies as a sceptic. I have no means,\nnow, to controv:ert or dispute the accuracy of his allegations. After such\na .considerable lapse of time (BOme four years), and in the absence of any\nnotes or written accounts for reference, I cannot recall in every detail what\nwas actually Baid; nor disprove what I have been charged with having\nsaid on that occasion. I have not the slightest doubt as to Mr. Witherby's\nhonesty of purpose and do not insinuate that he would make a single\nstatement he knew to be untrue; but I must nevertheless point out to\nMr. Witherby that whereas he was dealing-and as a novice-with a\nsubject in itself full of confusion and confusing terms, it is perhaps a\nlittle hazardous on his part to depend for material for his letter upon his\nmemory alone.\nMr. Witherby is certainly wrong when he writes that I made the\nassertion concerning the gradual disappearance of the drapery as being .\nan experiment or oxperience of my own. I gave it as an example\nquoted in several books I had read on the subject; which is a very\ndifferent thing. I may have spoken of analogous cases of my personal\nexperience, because I had seen its gradual formation; but the particular\ncase he mentions in his letter was a citation from a book and nothing\nmore. In fact, I do not like to be made responsible for what I never Baid,\nand can only answer for what I wrote in Light 'in several articles which bear\nmy signature. In the number for March 21st, 1885, p. 140, the following\nstatement occurs: \"The gradual disappearance may be due to other less\nmiraculous causes. . \u2022 . . The samples of spirit drapery I have\nenmined did not differ from ordinary muslin or calico sold at the linen-\ndraper's shop \"-and to this I still adhere.\nBut I will first deal with what I take to be a cardinal point in Mr.\nWitherby's letter, viz., his observation that my opinions (with regard to the\nreality of mediumistic phenomena) have undergone BOme modification.\nI fancy this must have been evident from the remarks I made in my letter\nwhich appeared in the June number of the Jowrnal. But my objections\nwere not directed against Spiritualism in its philosophical or metaphysical\naspects, but against its pretensions as a science based upon demonstrable\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1887.] Journal of Society for Psychical Besea;rch. 171\nfacts. And my contention is still that, if mediuDlB were not professional,\nthat is, dependent upon their mediumship for a living, and that if the\noccasional genuine manifestations were recorded for what they were worth,\nSpiritualism \"-would still be entitled to claim spiritual cause for some of\nits phenomena. Mr. Witherby hints that I still believe in the occasional\noccurrence of genuine cases and suggests that I should publish them. I\nfail to see what good could ensue from bringing forward any apparently\ngenuine case. I may be personally convinced of the reality of a certain\nphenomenon witnessed by other investigators or by myself. Upon what\ngrounds, may I ask, can I expect to be believed when, in arguing 'the\nprobability of its reality, I feel constrained to admit that the medium in\nwhose presence my case occurred had been previously or subsequently\ndetected in the production of spurious phenomena 1 Under such ;regrettable\ncircumstances I feel somewhat diffident as to my ability to furnish your\nreaders with a single case that could withstand even the mildest form of\nscientific criticism. And hence, 1 hope you will excuse the conciaeneaa of\nmy reply to .the different questions raised in Mr. Witherby's letter. If\nyou will grant me the neceaaary space to deal more elaborately with the\nsubject of professional mediumship, I will devote a whole chapter to each\nseparate question.\nAll I can state now is that in my present opinion the John King of which\nI spoke, is either' a phantasy created by the medium'. 80mnambulic\nconsciousness (as suggested by Dr. von Hartmann), or the medium under\n.. control\" of a disincarnated but intelligent being-\" spirit \"-the medium\nbeing influenced to act unconsciously the part of that \"spirit.\" How far in\nsuch a case the \" form\" represents the \" spirit,\" or how little of\nthe medium remains in it, I cannot now determine. I hope' to recur to\nthat hypothesis on a future occasion.\nThe names and titles of ilMnce-room spirits Buch as John King, or\nCharlie, or the Prince Imperial, are, I believe, creations of the medium's\nsomnambulic phantasy or expectations. But I must observe that under the\npresent conditions of investigation it is impossible to discriminate between\na genuine 80mnambulic case and a fraud. I imagine ~. Witherby has not\ngiven sufficient attention to the theories propounded by Dr. Eduard\nvon Hartmann.\nThe life-history of sMnce-room spirits,and the various kinds ofinformation\ngiven by them, I no longer regard in a serious sense, not even in those\ncases in which I assume the medium to have been actually in a 80mnambulic\nstate j and do not now believe in the veracity of any statement of quasi-\nmateri1llised spirits and professional mediums alike. The drawing to which\nMr. Witherby refers represents, to the best of my present knowledge, a\nportrait of the medium, slightly transformed, in his somnambulic trance.\nThe spirit of the Dutchman was, I am now almos~ certa.in, a mere fancy\nof my own, a fancy, the result of undetected imposture. But here again Mr.\nWitherby makes a mistake in his allegations, for I did not tell him that it\n(the spirit) used to visit me while I was at work. I said the voice told me it\nwas that of a .. IIpirit\" present (at the s~ce) who knew me in earth-life and\ndid often visit me at my own rooms. I ought to have added, unaware to my-\nself, because it (he) could not manifest without the medium. As regards the\nDigitized by Google\n\f172 JQ'\/J\/\u00a5\"YW,l of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1881.\ntemptation by that spirit *0 make me drink, I must refer lie> my explanationin\naletterta yourself, in which I ga~e you a narrative of what statemgntsI made\nto the before-named gentlemen. I still maintain that, as I explained to you,\npersons, especially sensitives, in the habit of frequenting ~eances with\nphysical mediums, are, at the time, and for a short period after, (half an\nhour or so) to a certain degree under hypnotic influence, a condition not\nunlike the alert state in the mesmeric subject. I will refer to this on a\nfuture occasion.\nIn the spirit of the little child (which I said stood at my side and not\n\"sat on my knee \") I have no longer any faith, because Thave, on more than\none occasion, detected the medium's daughter performingthe part of a spirit-\nchild_\nI wish it to be well understood, bV Mr. Witherby in particular, and\nSpiritualists in general, that although I have still faith in many of the\nphenomena called Spiritualistic, I have been must cruelly deceived by\nphysical mediums and their confederates. Hence, I make no apology for\nhaving changed my opinions. Nor do I, on the other hand, beg Mi'.\nWitherby's pardon for the admission that I still believe in the spiritual ongm\nof some of the phenomena. The idols are not all broken. Metaphorically\nspeaking, I should say they merely want a fresh coat of paint of a leu\nbrilliant hue. But no matter in what modest garb 1 may now offer them to\nMr. Witherby for acceptation, he will, I am afraid, not look at them. He\nwill not be contented nntil he sees me smash the things into atoms and\nscatter these atoms before the winds. May be that further disillusionment\nneceSBitates the application of. a still duller coat of paint. But until it be\ndemonstrsted by incontrovertible proof that a whole host of witneSBes to\nthese facts, including myself, have been the victims of delusion, I shall keel)\nmy idols for what I think them to be worth and still believe that there is a\nnucleus of solid facts behind the mysteries of the ~ance-room.\nI must conclude by calling Mr. Witherby's attention to the fact that at\nthe time he and his friend interviewed me I had not personally met with\nsuspicious conduct Dn the part of mediums and had not discovered premedi-\ntated frauds. The information I gave them was in perfect harmony with my\nconvictions. I must also mention that I believtl that I informed my visitors\nof the fact that, prior to my investigations, I had personally experienced such\nas yet but partly explained mysteries as clairvoyance, and other preter-\nnormal perceptions ; that the .. apparition\" of my favourite child at the\nmoment of his death was the chief cause of my meditations on the destiny of\nman; and that the books I consulted on this subject further induced me to\nsearch more direct information from the Spiritualists.\nI did not approach the subject in the mood of a miracle-hunter, nor as an\nunprejudiced sceptic hoping to be converted, far leu as an antagonist deter-\nmined to expose itB fallacies, but as a searcher after truth. Nor did I depend\nentirely upon my own powers of judgment and observation but looked for\nguidance and instruction from what is considered to be the best literatul'e on\nSpiritualism; and the arguments and theories propounded by the authors of\nthis literature were in fall ace'Jrd with my notions; they seemed to explain\nmy personal experience in every way, and hence I believed in the truth of\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1887.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 173\nthe whole of these phenomena. How could I be expected to think otherwise 1\nI had never read or heard a single. serious argument against their reality.\nWith implicit faith in mediums-for the suspicion that a person could be\n80 debased as to deceive a fellow creature in his holiest beliefs and noblest\naspirations, did not for a moment enter my mind-who can blame me for\naccepting as true that which appeared to be true 1 Not that I accuse the\nauthors and defenders of Modern Spiritualism of having wilfully misre-\npresented facts. My presentcontention is that they have, like myself, trusted\ntoo much in the bona :fides of their mediums, and have given as examples\na good many cases which were, though real to them, the mere work of\ndeception. If these authors taught me much of what is true, they uncon-\nsciously led me to accept also much of what is false.\nAnd I must here remark that, after discovering direct fraud on the part\nof mediums, I did not fail to inform those most interested in the ma.tter.\n.My first experience with a medium (then very much in favour with\nSpiritualists) included a series of exceedingly doubtful manifestations.\nI.expressed my opinion as to their apparent spuriousness, in a paper which\nI submitted to the then President of the Spiritual Lyceum. Most of my\nsubsequent discoveries of imposture were communicated to the late editor\nof Light, who took the best means in his power to prevent further impoBitioD\nby refusing these mediums advertisement in Light.\nI hope I have now fully explained my present attitude towards Modem\nSpiritualism and its alleged phenomena. Should Mr. Witherby or any of\nyour readers wish for additional information, or require a more detailed\naccount of my seance-room discoveries, I am prepared to give them all\nthe particulars of my person31 experience.-I am, dear sir, yours obediently,\n8, Primrose Hill Studios, J. G. KBULBIUlfS\u2022\n.. October 22nd, 1887.\nTo the EdiWr oj the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOB. PSYCHICAL RESBARCH.\nSm,-Mr. Myers, in his very able paper at the last General Meeting,\nappeared t() me to offer a solution in one sentence of the question of multiplex\npersonality. It was but a hint. I refer to his suggestion that development\nmay lie at the root of the matter. Leaving too altogether esoteric assump-\ntIOns on one side, the majority of civilised folk believe in the existence of\nbody and mind. The cogito ergo BUm satisfies most of us. Not a few of us\nalao have a vague belief in the existence within us (or at any rate in some\nparticular relation to U8 individually) of a something we call spirit. This\nlead8 to the guess that, as mind has been added to body, so spirit is being\nadded to mind.\nMr. Myers gave us a new definition of genius which certainly accords\nwith the use of the word as the generally accredited Latin translation of\naalJU'>\/I, though whether genius in our sense should mean spirit itself or the\naction of spirit (the unconscious stratum) on mind, as the lecturer suggested,\nphilology will hardly determine for us, as ingeni'Um. originally seems to have\nmeant an innate quality, and so inclination or even character, while the\nword spiritllll, a breathing, supports the latter view. Inspiration\u00b7would thus\no\nDigitized by Google\n\f1741 Journal of Society for Psychical Re8ea;rch.

The aVII(JI\"~\n~apo~ of Nonnus, which we find practically in the Paredlrua Spiritw of\nTertullian, is not dissimilar to the old Hesiodic idea that the aalJ'OIIu were\nthe souls of men of the golden age helping their posterity. The genius which\nServius, in a. note on Virgil, says may be 'oci 'llel rei 'llel hommiB, and which\nwe find substantiated on a coin, \"Genius Populi Romani,\" the precursor\nperhaps of the Zei~ist, is rather apart from the subject, though opening a\nvery interesting field for inquiry.\nIt is a striking fact that the interference of aalJ'OH~ was always thought\nto be supernatural, and conversely Pythagoras attributed dreams and signs\nand divination entirely to aalJ'OH~. No wonder Socrates in his defence\nconsidered his direct method superior to the indirect rule of thumb divina-\ntion of the augurs. Probably it was the supreme difficulty of being conscious\nof a second self that made the philosopher deny that his aal~fII)II was only his\nown prudence, which Nepos aaaerta it was. A word as to method. If we\nhave to be mos. stringently scientific in the study of the relation of mind to\nbody, this stringency must be redoubled when we attempt to determine the\nrelationship of a something, spirit perhaps, to mind.

R.\" in the July number of the\nJO'IM\"fItOl, suggests a point which would, I think, repay investigation in\nconnection with experimental thought-transference; and that is-how far\nthe power of visualisation in the percipient is a condition of succeaa.\n.. H. G. R.\" says that when bis experiments succeed, he instantly \/1688 the\ncard before the agent; when the triala fail, he does not see it. I have myself\nfrequently made smaJ1 experimentsin thought-transference, and have almost\ninvariably noticed that the percipient, when he makes a succeaaful \"gueaa,\"\nsays he \/J688 the card, diagram, or whatever it may be. For myself, I am so\nutterly without power of visualisation that I never understood what people\nmeant by it until I recently read Mr. Galton's Enquiri88 into Human\nFaculty, and my own experiments as percipient have invariably been total\nfailures.\nOf course, I do not wish to do more than suggest that the two thinga-\npower of visualisation and success as a percipient-may be connected; but it\nseems to me that the question is worth some inquiry, which it would not be\ndifficult to make. It would be interesting to know, first, whether the\nsucceasful percipient always .668 the object thought of, or in what way it\nenters his consciousneaa, and secondly, whether, apart from thought-trans-\nference, he poaaeaaes a power of visualisation, and to what extent.-\nI remain, &c.,\nB.W.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov\u2022\u2022 1887.] JO'IJ\/I\"IUil of &ciety for Psychical Research. 175\nTo the EdiWr of the JOURNAL OJ' THE SOOIBTY JrOB PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nDEAR Sm,-The announcement which appears in the last Journal'\nthat my daughters were detected using a code of signa.ls in BOrne thought-\ntransference experiments at Cambridge, has given me intense pain; and I\nhave no desire to excuse their misconduct, nor to extenuate their guilt, for\nwhich they now grieve quite as much as I do. But I do not believe that\nsigns, signals, and hints of any kind were used in the earlier experiments.\nIt would, of course, be impossible to Bay that a sign was never used in the\nthousands of experiments that were made, not only before scientific and\nliterary men, but in numerous drawing-rooms as an evening amusement,\ndnring the two or three years in which we were interested in the matter,\nthough I was never aware of it; but that anything like a code of signals was\naver in use during the early experiments with which I had anything to do, I\ndo not believe. \/\nTo show the positive grounds on which this conviction rests I must give\na condensed account of our first experiments. and the method in which we\nconducted them.\nHaving heard, with great scepticism, of some curious things that occurred\nat a friend's house, during the playing of the\" willing game,\" I resolved to\ntest their truth with the members of my own family, almost all of whom\nwere then_ children (in 1880). and entirely unacquainted with any experi-\nments like those of the \" willing game.\"\nBut before giving details. I may say, that after experimenting for three\nor four months I gave a l~ture .on \"Thought-reading,\" before a scientific\nsociety in Derby, which was reported in a Derby paper the same week. The\nMS. of that lecture is now before me, and from it I quote the details of our\nfirst experiments in thought-transference, which I now propose to give.\n\". \u2022 \u2022 . I made notes at the time of all that occurred, and from\nthese notes I compile the present lecture. On the first evening it was agreed\nthat the children should go out of the room in tum, remaining in another\nroom until called. And this arrangement was carried out through the whole\naeries of experiments.\n\" The first evening was spent in trying the \u2022willliig game,' as it had been\ndeacribed to me; and though many mistakes were made. the succeBBes were\nBO much in preponderance that we all began to feel there was something in\nit. It then occurred to me to dispense with \u2022contact,' to see whether it\nwas really a willing game. or a merely pushing game, and we found at once\nthat want of contact did not interfere with the results. On the second\nevening we fixed on the names of objects that were to be gueBBed, and had\nvery few mistakes. On the third evening we settled on the names of foreign\ncountries and chief towns, and had no mistake during an hour; and as,\nduring this time, fully thirty trials were made without a mistake, the ex-\nplanation must be looked for in some other hypothesis than that of chance.\nThe succeeding evenings were spent in repeating experiments with names of\ntowns, of people, and of objects-such as a pin, a match, a carpet-tack, in\nfact anything we could think of; and during au hour, whilst we made five-\nand-twenty trials not one mistake occurred. It was then suggested that they\nshould try and gueBB cards selected out of a pack whilst the gueBBer was\no 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f176 JO'U'Y\"nal of Society for P8ychical Research.

We then made &\nsimilar experimeat with a bundle of fifty photographic cards, and in fourteea\ntrials twelve were named correctly at once, the .other two on the third\nattempt.\"\nNow I wish to call attention to the fact that during the first three or\nfour evenings the successes were as great aB they ever afterwards became ;\nand that the subjec~ selected for guessing were of the most varied kinds-\nnames of persons, fancy names, of towns, and countries, and objects, &c.,\nfor which it would have been impoSsible to frame a code of signals so aB to\nconvey to the guesser the idea of the thing selected-the selection having\nbeen always made by me just at the time. Besides, when they began to guess\ncards, theTe WaB a very keen emulation amongst them aB to who should ~o the\nbest, aB in order to stimulate them I had promised to give to the one who had\nmade the highest\" score\" a halfpenny for each right guess. So that, had\nany signs been made by any one of the company, the cry of unfair play would\nimmediately have been raised; this we never heard.\nThe report of my Derby lecture having been forwarded to Professor\nBarrett, he paid us a visit at Buxton. And for more than a year afterwards\nwe were visited by numerous scientific gentlemen, to whom my house WaB\nalways open,-morning, noon, and evening, to suit their convenience. No\none WaB ever refused who brought a proper introduction; and the children\n(for children they all were at that time) were always at their disposal, and\nwilling to be placed under all sorts of conditions, not only in our own house,\nbut in their private lodgings in Buxton. .And yet, during all that time I\n,,\/ never heard they were suspected of using lIignals. Had they been in the\nhabit of doing 110, we might have expected to find them improving in their\ngueBsing, according aB \"the code\" became more perfect by practice; but\n. the very reverse WaB the CaBe. .And as I found, after the early part of 1882,\nthat their facultiAs of percipience were gradually deteriorating, I resolved to\ngive up the experiments; and it was contrary to my advice and wish that\nthey were recommenced after a lapse of five years, knowing the power of\nthe temptation, which in Bomewhat kindred matterB has proved almost\nuniversally fatal, to simulate by tricks what formerly came spontaneously and\nnaturally.\nThe laat word that I shallll&Y on this matter is this: that if the scientific\ninveBtigators, all of whom afterwards became prominent members of the\n.. Society for Psychical Research,\" could have been deceived by a few\nchildren practising a \"code of signals,\" their keenness of vision, and their\n, faculty of \"continuous observation,\" are less than I could have imagined.\nThan tho above statement I know no more, and I can lI&y no less.\nFaithfully yours,\nA.
