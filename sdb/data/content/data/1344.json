The diftinetio\"\nof the three orders, of the Clergy, the Nobility,\nand the third ~ftate, was preferved, as it ufed to\n'be in the States General \u2022.\nThe towns and boroughs, and even the villages\nwere to have their rcfpective municipalities, all\nacting on the fame Rlan, and under the direCl:ion\nofthe Provincial Adminiftrations, in their fecon-\ndary diftricts. ,\n45.\nThough at firft fight this fyfter:n appears ex~ Natural\ntremely advantageous, yet, on examination, we ~~~~~r\nfhall find, that its fole tendency was to apply Re- tem.\npublican forms, as much as circumftances would\npermit, to a Monarchical government; that its\nobject was..to cramp the authority of the Monarch,\nto clog and weaken it ; and to annihilate the power\nof his officer&, or direct agents, the intendants of\nprovmces.\nSoon was France by means of thefc a1femblies\nand their committees,\u2022or permanent offices, to bo\nfilled with ambitious men ftarting forth in the new\npolitical career ; men indeed \u00b7who, in the firft\ninftance, would have recognized the authority of\na ~ing, but who would foon have confidered them..\n{elves better informed ofthe :Wants of the people\n(be~g..nearer to .them) than his minifters, and\n\u2022 SeeD'Argesd'oll's plans, &c:. on the natarc of govern~.\nmenu. \u00b7\ntherefore\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fANTIMON AR.CHICAt CONSPIR.AC~.\\\ntherefore more fuily acquainted with the me~ of\naUeviating their diftretfes.

Each municipaiity coalefcing with the\nadminillrators, a hundred pettyRepublics tlart intd\nexifrence, ready to league againft their Sovereign,\nwho, under the title of King, would fcarcely have_\nretained the authority of a Doge.\nIn time we fhould have feen a fwarm ofpoliti-\ncafters, or petty tribunes, fallying forth from\nthefe adminiftrative bodies, who would have left\nno means untried to perfuade the populace that\n1hch a King was rather a burden than an advan-\ntage to the ftate; that it would be proper to lay\nhim afide, fince he was unneceffary; that the pro-.\nvincial and municipal adminiftrations would theri\nbe able to follow up in a more effettual manner;\nthe falutary meafures they had conceived for th~\ngood of the people : \u00b7and thus, \u00b7ftep by ftep, the\nMonarchical government would have been over-\nthrown,,anda municipal adminiftration eftablifued.,\nwith the 'freedom of which Voltaire and D'Argen.4\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 fon\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f1\\NTIMONARCHICAL CON'SPI\\UC~-\nton had been. fo fafcinated in Holland.

Priefts and\nbifhops were admitted, or rather called upon, to\n~orm a part of thefe adminiftrations, fo foreign to\ntheir facred functions, for the confpiracy had not\nyet attained fufficient force to caft them off. The\n2eal for falvation was to be fuperfeded by the wild\nambition of moving in a fphere fo contrary to\ntheir c;alling.

At\nthe period when he made his declaration neither\nthe conftitution nor the oath of apoftacy had been\ndecreed. It ha.d not as yet been propofed to plun-\nder and profane the temples, and to abolilh the\npublic worfhip. No blow had been given to the\nfymbol of Chriftianity. All was prepared and\ndaily ftarting into exifterice ; but as yet the alfem-\nbly had only trc:fpaffed againft the political autho-\nrity and the rights of their Sovereign. It was at\nthe fight of thefe firft crimes that Le Roi is re-\nproached with \u00b7the miferable effeCts of his fchool,\nand it was to this reproach he anfwered, Cf'o whom\ndo youjayjo ?

Thus\nwhile the declaration of this unhappy adept au-\nthenticates the confpiracy of the Sophifters againft\nreligion, it equally demonftrates that contriyed\nagainft the Throne.\nIt would be in vain to object that this unhappy\nman loved his King ; he calls all prefent to wit-\nnefs that he isattached to the perfon ofLewis XVI.;\nhow could he t~en join in a confpiracy againft\n.him ? But it is in vain, all is \u00b7confiftent, all is\neombined in this mind racked with remoife.

Sof!le wifhed to have aKing,\nor at leaft to preferve the appearance of one in the\nnew projected\u00b7 order of things; others, and they\nwere to carry the.day, objected to the very name\nor any appearance of Royalty, and both parties\nwere\nDigir,zed by Coogle \u00b7\n\fANTIMONARCHJCAL CONSPIRACY.\nwere unanimous in their attacks againft Royalty as\nthen exifting.

But both\nwere leagued in Rebellion, and botp confpired to\nbring about a Revolution. The repenting adept\nwanted a half Revolution, nor did he believe that\nthe people, when put in motion, would proceed\nto thofe exceffes which he detefted. He flattered\nhimfelf' ~hat the Confpiring Philofo_phers who\nftirred up the populace would. be able to diretl:\nits motions; that they would infpire this populace\nwith a proper refpe& for the perfon and even for\nthe dignity of a Prince whom he loved and re.\n' fpeCl:ed as a Frenchman and a_Courtier, while as a\nSophifter he dethroned him. This is all that his\nremorfe and his proteftations of attachment (or\nthe perfon of Lewis XVI. can indicate.

The one, \u00b7hardened in impiety and\nrebellion, preferves his fecret till that.period when\nhe thinks he may violate it without endangeri\"9\nthe fuccefs of his wicked purfuits.

He \u00b7beholds thefe men who have\nreduced him in no other light tha~ as monfters of\nrebellion. When fuch oppofite paffions, fuch\ndifferent interefts and fentiments agree in their de-\npofttions on the fame confpiracy, on the: fame\nmeans, and on the fame confpirators, truth can\nrequire no further proofs; it is evidence, it is de-\nrnonftration ftfelf.\n157 .\nSuch then is the firft problem of that Revolu- Firff fleps\ntion fo fatal to Monarchy~ Voltaire forwards it Cfo~~eira\u2022\nwith all his might in confpiring againft his God, cy c!m..\nin fpreading his doctrine of modern liberty and in pared.\nartfully attacking with his farcaftic, wit and fatire\nthe pretended defpots of his own country and of\nEurope. Montefquieu traced in his fyftems the\nfirft fteps toward that diforganizing liberty. Jean\nJaques adopts Montefquieu's principles, and en-\nlarges on their confequences.

The moft fatal attack on\nChriftianity, and on which the Sophifters had be-\nftowed their chief attention,\u00b7 was that which they\nmade with the greateft fuccefs to imbue the minds\nof the people with the fpirit of infurrettion and\nrevolt. Nothing .proves this with more certainty\nthan the care with which \u00b7they- combined their at-\ntacks againft the Throne with thofe againft the\nAltar, in that inundation ofAntichrift:ian writings\nwhich we have .feen flowing like a torrent through\neyery clafs of fociety.

Thefe writings are\niifued frQm the fame manufaCt:ory,compofed by the\nfame adepts, recommended and reviewed \u00b7by the\nfame .chiefs, fpread with the fame profufion, hawked\nabout from the .town to the\u00b7village by the fame\nagents of H~lbach's Club, fent free ofcoft to the\ncountry fchool~mafl:ers, that all cla1fes of people\nfrom the higheft to the moft indigent might im\u2022 \u00b7\nbibe the venom of their Sophiftry. As it is cer\u2022\ntain that thefe writings were the grand means of\nthe Sophifters in their confpiracy againft (;;hrift, fo\nit is equally certain, that thefe fame produtl:ions,\nmonftrous ~igefts of the principles of impiety and\nof thofe of rebellion, are irrefragable proofs that\nthefe fame Sophifters had combined the moft im-\npious of plots againft their God with the moft\nodious machinations againft all Kings.\nWhy .

The moment at length\ncomes when the poftulanr- is ordered to approach\n\u00b7 nearer to the Venerable. Then the brethren who\nhad been .armed with fwords for the occafion draw...\ning up in two lines held, their fwords..elevatcd,.\nleaning the points toward each'other, and formed\nwhat iri Mafonry is called the 41\"-&k.of.\/J.t~l., The\nc:andida~e paffes under this arch to a fort ofaltar.\n\"' - elevated\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fANTtUONAllCRICAL \u00b7CONSPlll.A.C'\u00a5.\nelevated on two fteps, at the fartheR: end of the\nLodge. The Mafter, feate<lin an arm chair, or a\nfort of thrObe, behirid this altar, pronounced along\ndifcourfe on the inviolability of the fecret which\nwas to be imparted, and on the dangtr of breaking\nthe path which the candidate was going to take*\nHe pointed to the naked fwords which were al~\nways ready to pierce the breaft of the traitor, and \u00b7\ndeclared to him that it was impoffible to efcapc\ntheir vengeance. The candidate then fwears,\n\" that rather than betny the fecret, he confents\n~' to have his head cut off, his heart and entrails\n.\" torn out, and his alhes caft before the wind.''\nHaving taken the oath. the Mafter faid the follow-\ning words to him, which the reader may eafily con-\n. ceive have not efcaped my memory, as I had ex~\npeeled them with fo much impatience, \" \u00b7My dear\n\" brother, the fecret of Mafonry confitb in thefe\ncc words, EQ.YALJTT AN.D LIBERTY; 41\/ men ar_e\n'f equal andfrte; a\/J men are brethren.\" TJle Ma-\nfter did ~ot utter another fyllable, and every body\nembraced th~ new brotber tqiUll and free. The\n~ge broke up1- an4 we gayly adjourned to a\nMafonic rc:paft.\nI was fo tar from fufi>ecting any further meaning\nin this famo'JS fecret, that I could fcarcely refram\nfrom burfting into a fit of laughter on hearing it,\n.and With the greateft fimplicity told thofe who had\n- T 4 intro,\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fintroduced me, If that was all tlleir\u00b7fccrct, livid\nknowA it a long time. \u00b7.\n~ Alld ctrtainly there was no occafwn ior being .a\nmafon to kam tl\\at man i~ not bornfor ftavtry~\nbut to enjoy a true LUerty under the empire ofthe\nlaws ; or ifthey underftand 6y Eijwity that as we\nare the children ofone \u00b7commM parellt, the c~n\u00ad\ntures ofthe fame God, we are to love and help\neach other as brethren ; fuch ttuths certainly are \u00b7\nbetter taught in the Gofpel than by the chifdilA\nrites of Mafonry. I muft fay, that though the\n\u00b7Lodge was \u00b7nurnerouOy atttnded, I did not fee a\n'fingle craftfman who gave any other interpretatiQn\nto this famous fecret. The reader will fee that it\nwas necelfary to g0 through many other degrees\n:before they were initiated into a very different\nLiberty and Equality, and even that many who\nrofe to higher degrees were never initiat'ed into\nthe ultimate fenfe of their famous fe.cret.\u00b7\n\u00b7 Let .not people be furpri~e~ that Engfiib Ma~\n{onry lhould be chiefly compofed ofgood and loyal\nfnbjefts, whofe main objed: is mutua11y to he~\n\u2022erl other on the principles\u00b7 of Equality, which\nwith them \u00b7is nothing more than Fnterniry.

I have read moft excellent difcourfes and\nletl:ures on the avoiding of abufes, in the hiftory\nof their Mafonry. \u00b7 I have there feen ~ Gran4\nMafter telling the brethren that the true Equality\nof the craft, does not authoriie the brother when.\nout of the Lodge to derogate from that refpetl: and\ndeference due to the rank which ,any perfon bears\nin the world, or their different political degrees\nand titles.

Thofe Lodges that\nwere not under the infpeffion of the Grand Orient,\nwere under a fimilar government of a Mother\nLodge, which alfo had its Grand Mailer and kept\nthe fame fort of correfpondence.\nThis part of their conftitutions was generally\nknown to' all the brethren ; but I have often re-\npeated that with refpea to the Occult Lodges they\nwere in the dark. The day was to come whe.l)\nthe greateft novice in the art was to ihow as much\nzeal as the moft profound adept. To effectuate\nthis, it was only neceffary to fill their ordinary\nLodges with hair-brained young fell~ws, ignorant\ncitizens, and even thick-headed workmen, who\nhad been previou1ly mi1led by the impious doc-\ntrines of the Sophifters, and with all thofe who\nwere carried away by that torrent of declamation,\ncalumnies, &c. direaed againft the altar, the\nthrone, and all the higher orders of fociety.\nWith filch a fpecies of brethren the Occult\nMyfteries were unneceffary, and without any fur- .\nther inftrud:ions the warhoop of Liberty and Equa-\nlity was more than fufficient to excite their enthu-\nfiafm and dirett their blows. A chief in each\nLodge, or a very few adepts in direa correfpon-\ndence with the central office of the Confpirators,\nmight eafily be informed of the day and hour on\nwhich it was neceffary that the minds of thefe un..\nderlin~ adepts fhould be .worked up to ievolu..\ntionary\u00b7\nDigitized by Coogle .\n\fAN TIMONAllCHlCAL CONSPillACY\u2022\ntionaey fury, and to point out the.objeCts and per-\nfons on whom they were to vent their rage. Nor\nwas it impoffible to organi~e thofe bands of Bri-\ngands and firebrands into Lodges, and thus diftri.-\nbute to each the different parts oflevelling butchers\nand of revolutionary executioners. Thefe Lodges,\nmultiplied throughout the ftate in the towns and\nvillages, might, under the dire&ion of the central\noffice or committee., turn out at the fame inftant\nall over the country, thoufands -and tens of thou-\nfands of adepts all enthufiaftically' arrayed under\n.the banners of Liberty and Equality, armed with\npikes, hatchets, and torches, carrying fire and de..\nfolation wherever their courfe was traced, know-\ning beforehand what victims were to be facrificed,\nwhat caftles and country houfes to be burnt, and\nwhat heads to be \u00b7carried before the triumphant\nlevellers of Liberty .and Equality ; thus preferv-\ning the moft exaCt accord in the midft of rebel-\nlion, levelling at one blow all public force, all\n.publicjuftice, diforganizing every thing and throw--\ning every thing into confufion. But, in order to\neft&lbli{h its new empire and organize its own\npower, it only had to transform its fecret dens of\nconfpiracy into Jacobin clubs~ and its grand adepts\ninto municipal officers. Thus at length, it gave\nbirth to a Revolution irrefiitible, confummated,.\n\u00b7 and irreparable even in the firft hours of its exift- \u00b7\nence~\n..\n437\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fANTIMONAlt.CHICAL CONSPlRACY..\nence~ and before any one had thought of meafures\n.to oppo1e it.\nIn thus defcribing what might have been done\nby means of that tenebrous fecrecy ofthe Ma-\nfonic government and\u00b7 Lodges, I have only anti~\n'.cipated what really was ,done by the Sophifters to\neffectuate the French Revolution. As early as\n~epufities the ye~r 1776 the central Committee of the\n1ent rom \u00b7\nthe Grand Orient inftruCl:ed the directing adepts\u00b7 to\ng~~;'\/r. prepare the Brethren for infurreCl:ion, and to vifit\nthe Lodges throughout France, to conjure them\nby the Mafonic oath, and to announce that th~\ntime was at length come to accomplifu it in th\u00a2\ndeath of tyrants.\nThe adept who was\u00b7 intrufted with the vilitation\nof the Nortbern provinces was an officer of artil\u00b7\nlety called Sinetty. His Revolutionary Apoftle\u2022\nfhip led him to Lille. The regiment of La Sarre\nwas at that time in garrifon there. The Confpi-\nrators wifhed particularly to gain profelytes among\nand make fure .of the military brethren; Sinetty\nwas far from fucce.eding according to his wifhes ;\nbut the method and plans he adopted are all that\ncan be necelfary for our object. To explain this\nmatter to our readers, we will lay before them tho\nrelation made by one of the officers of La Sarre\u00bb\nan eye-witnefs, and one of the many whom Si-\nnetty had chofen to be prefent at the rnee'ting\nwher\u00a2\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fANTIMONAR.CHICAL CONSPIRACY.\nwhere he was to difdofe the objeCt of his Apo1Ue-\n_\n.fhip.\n\" We had,\"\u00b7 faid this worthy officer to me,\n'' our Lodge. It was to us, as to moft other re-\n\" gim~nts;a mere plaything. The trials to which\n'~ the new candidates were fubjeCl:ed afforded us\n\" much amufement. The Mafonic feafts made us\ncc fpend our leifure hours agreeably, and refrdhed\n'I us from our labors. You very _\nwell underftand\n\" that our Lioer,ty and Equality was not that of the\n'.i Jacobins\u2022 . \u00b7The greateft part and nearly the\n'f whole of the offic\u00ab\"rs gave proofs of this at the\n\" Revolution. We ind~ed little thought ofany fuch\n'' Revolution when an officer of artillery called\n'' Sinetty, a famous Mafon, prefented himfelf at\n'' our Lodge. He was received as a brother. At\nH firft he did not appear particular. . A few days\n\" after Ire invited about twenty of us to meet him\n'' at a tea-gard~n called the Bonne A venture, a\n\" little out of Lille.. We thought he wifhed to\n\u00ab return the compliment ofthe fe~ft we had given '\n\" him, and expeCl:ed a common Mafonic repaft,\n\" when on a fudden he holds forth, declaring he\n\" had important fecrets to communicate from the\n\" Grand Orient. We liften to him ; but judge of\n\" our furprize when we heard him in the moft\n\" emphatic and enthufiaftic tone declare, ' That\n'\" at length the time was come, that the plans fo\n'' ably conceived and fo long\u00b7meditated by the\n\" true\n~igitized by Coogle\n\f.AWTtMONAllCHICAL CONSPillACY.\n\" .true Mafons were on the eve of \u00b7being aceorn\u2022\n\" plifhed J that the univerfe would be freed front.\ntt its \u00b7fetters; Tyrants called Kings would be van-\n\" quifhed } religious fupefftitiohs would give way\ncc to light ; Liberty and Equality would fucceed\n\u00ab to the flavery under which \u00b7the .world was op\u2022\ncc preffed ; and that man would at length be rl\u2022\n\" inflated in his rights\/ \u00b7\ncc While our orator continued thefe declama\u00b7\n\" tions we ftared at each other, as much as to\n\" fay, 'What is this madman about?'

After having laughed for fome time\n\" at what we eonceived to be the conceits of a\n\" heated brain, we forgot the fcene till the Re-\nc< volution (which convinced us but too forcibly\n\" how much we had mifconceived the man) re-\nh called it to our minds.''\nWhen I had determined on publifuing this fact,\nI knew how nece1fary it would be to authenticate\nit by the fignature ofhim to whom we are inllebt\u2022\ned for the above account ; but it may eafily be\nconceived that he did not with to have been looked\nupon as having betrayed the fecrets of the Lodge.\nFortuMttly there arenow inLondon many who were\nprefent at that meeting ; for example, the Comte\nde Martange, Mr. de' Bertrix, Mr. Le Chev\u2022 de\nMyon, all formerly officers in the regiment ot\nLa Sarre. Though I have not the honor of their\nacquaintance, and that they may be a little fur~\nprized at feeing themtelves named hereJ frill I am\naot afraid of being contradicted by them, either\nas to the miffion or the manner in which Sinetty\nfulfilled it ; and efpecially when I add that it was\ntheir attachment to their King which milled them\nwith refpeet to this defigning madman. So far\nwere \u00b7 they from any' revolutionary ideas; fo well\ndid they know the difpofitions of the French\nofficers, and fo firmly did they think the authority\nof\u00b7the King eftablifbed, that they believ~d this\nSinetty to be a madman, and all his me1fage from\nthe\n+l-1\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f\/.NTIMONAR.CHICAL CONSPIKACY.\nthe Mafter Lodge to be no more than the reverid\nof a heated brain.

This\nwas the Equality of the Monarcbijlr, who thought\nthemfelves guiltlefs rebels becaufe they were\u00b7 not\nfufficiently powerful to dirett the courfe of the re-\nbellion. As for. the laft clafs, they wifhed neither\nfor a conftitutional nor any other King.

Let\n\\ us then examine the effence of the firft two.\nTo exemplify the firft method, let us fuppofe\ni one of thofe men who have .gone through a f;.Om-\nplete courfe ofmodem -Philofophifm, who, fhould\nthey not fcoff at ChriftiaAity, woulq at leaft ~efi-\n. tate at every thing which is called religion; for \u00b7\n' the code forewarns the Infinuator, that his efforts\n, would be vain fhould he attempt to feduce Philo-\n; fophers of another ftamp, men of found judg-\n1 ment, and who would never be partizans of doc-\n; trines which could not endure the light of broad\n1 day. But when he fhall hav~ ' difcovered oneol\nI\n!.the for~er who has already pretty well imbibed\n: the principles of the f~, he will affume the cha-\n. ratter of a Philofopher well verfed in the myfteries\nof\nDigitized bvGoogle\n\fTHt ANTISOCIAL CONSPtltACT;\n~f antiquity. He will have little diflic:ulty in acc-\ningfu~h a\u00b7part, as he will find ample inU:ruttions\nin the code. To follow thofe inftrucHons faith-\nfully, he muft begin \" by defca_\nnting on the fu-\n\" preme felicity of being verfed in fciences whicb.\n\" few can approach, of walking in the paths of\ncc light while the vulgar are groping in darknefs.\n\" He myft remark, that there exift doctrine\u2022\n'\u00b7' folely tranfmitted by fecret traditions, becaute\n\" they are above the comprehenfion of common\n\" minds. In proof. of his aifertions he will cite\n\" the Gymnofophifts i~ the Indies, the Priefts of\n\" lfis in Egypt, and\u2022\u00b7thofe of Eleufis and the\n\" Pythagorean fchool in Greece.\" He will fe..\n_leB: cettain, fentences from Cicero, Seneca, Arifti-\ndes, and lfocrates ; and, left he fhould ever be taken\nunawares, he will learn thofe by heart which the\nlegiflator has carefully inferted in the code.\nThough it would be very eafy to demonftrate from\nthofe very authors, that the ancient myfteries:laid\ndown no fixed principles. on the important pointa\naf the Providence of God, and of the orig'in anti\nDTiier oft~e univerje, the lnfinuator is nevtrthelefs\nt<> quote' -thofe texts\u00b7 to prove that thete exifts !.\ntecret doB:~~-~-2!?.~~h=f~.,.~B:s, and above all \u00b7a\n&etrine calculated to render lift more agreeable, anrJ.\npt~in more jupparla!lle; and to enlarge our ideas 011\nthe majejly of God. \" Let him add, that aU the\nfages of antiquity were acquainted with thefe doc-\n.

At the fame\ntime he will hint that he has had the happinefs of\nbeing initiated into thefe doctrines, and that,\n1hould the candidate wifh it, he would do his heft\nto procure him the fame felicity ; but that it was\na fcience gradually imparted, and that cer.tain men\npoffeffed the talent ofguiding him from a diftance,\nQf leading him to the difcovery of this new world,\nand that without being ever in his prefence \u2022.\nWhen the In.finuator has by fuch language fuc\u00b7\n:ceeded in exciting the curiofity of his candidate,\nhe muft then afcertain .his opinions on fome par-\nticular articles. He will propofe the difcuffion of\ncertain queftions in writing, and of certain prin-\nciples, as the .groundwork on which they are in.\nfuture to proceed.

The fervices that he had rendered ro the\nBrethren m~y be appreciated by that which\nKnigge believed to be fo much to his honor, when\nhe fays, that nearly all the littlt good that is to be\nfoiDld in thefy}Jem ofthe 8Jf'i&l Obftrumue is to be al-\nlri!Juttd to Bode; or, in other words, every thing\n.that affimilated their fyil:eni to that of Weifuaupt.\nAfter having clofely fcrutinized his man, Knigge .\ndeclares him to be advanced in years, but ftill in\nquefi: of truth which he had not yet been able to\nfind, though he had be(n forty years a Mafon;\nhe depicb him as indifferent to all fyftems, though\npetulant, fiery, and jealous of dom,inion; and as\nloving to be flattered by Princes. \u00b7To this de\u2022\nfcription I may addfrom my German Memorials,\nthat his exterior was unpolilhed and almoft de-\nformed, which, however, did not hinder this old\nMafon from acting the part ofa wit and of a man\u00b7\noffentiment\u00b7with the Ladies\u2022. They alfo defcribe\nhim as a pedant, with an appearance\u00b7 of frank-\nnefs that Princes miftook for opennefs of \u00b7cha-\nracter; but with which they might not have been\nfo eafily duped had they known, that though he\nfought their favor, he as cordially hated them as\nhe did what he called the Mummeries of Religion,\no\/ 1efuits, and of Priejls. Such fentiments muft\nnece1farily have endeared him to the Illuminees.\nKnigge more particularly courted him on\u00b7 account\nof the great inftuence he enjoyed over the Ger-\nman\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fJUSTOiUCAL PART.\nman Mafonry. Thefe two men fcrutinized each\nother, and Knigge at length declares, that ''after\n\" many mutual explanations he . had admitted\n\" him to the degree of Scotch Knight.\"-\nHere Bode found all thofe promifes to forward\nthe vie~s of the Order, to reveal all his difcove-\nries on Mafonry to his new Superiors, to inftall\nthe Illuminees in all the principal pofts of the\nLodges, and to embezzle their funds. Nont of\ntheft obligations appear to bavt given him any Until-\nfind's; but he feared, that in the end thofe un-\nknown fuperiors would turn out to be J efuits and\nPriefts. It was neceffary, therefore, to remove\u00b7\nfuch fears, and to guarantee to him that thofe \u00b7fu-\nperiors detefted Priefts and Jefuits as much as he\ndid himfdf. \" On this condition (fays Knigge)\ncc he promifed, JjJ, To labor fot us, and, by\n\" means of the new Syftem or Code to be form-\n\" ed for Mafonry, to throw the empire over the\n\" Lodges into our hands.

'\nSuch promifes from Bode were of too much\nconfequence to be rejected by the Dluminees ; he\nwas received with open arms, and, under the cha-\u00b7\nratl:eriftic of Amtlitt.r, was ufhered into the higher\u00b7\ndegrees. We fhall foon fee how faithfully he ac-\nquitted himfdf of his promifes.\nWhile Knigge was making fuch important \u00b7ac-\nquiGtions from Mafonry, Weifhaupt was medita-\nting another plan~ that was to inftall him Mafter\nof all the Lodges of Poland. The Areopagite\nCato-Zwack received nearly at the fame time both\nKnigge's official note relative to Bode, and the\nW~- following letter from Weilhaupt: cc I have a\u00b7\nll~upt\u2022s\nv1ews on \u00ab\u2022 mind to undertake the Polonefe Conf~deration,\nM\nthefollih \" not precifely to llluminize them, but merely as\u00b7\na1ons. .\n\u2022 Original Writin:s, Vol. II.

But _rnoft certainly they\nWl!re rendered\u00b7 the dupes of his impiety before\n\u00b7 they became the fport of his confpiracies ; and\nundoubtedly the latter was but the juft puniih-\nment of the former.

Perhaps alfo, content with\nhaving laid the foundations of his confpiracy, and\nwith having arrived at that day which he ha:d lung\nfince foretold, when he could defy the powe~ of\nthe earth to deftroy his fabric; or, perhaps, fatif-\nfied at feeing he had now formed men able to pre.:\nfide over his _\nAreopage; he fimply gave his advice\non .important occafions, leaving the com~on de-\ntails, the functions of an ordinary chief, to other\nadepts.

Digitized by GoogIe\n\fHISTORICAL l'ART.\nthough the archives of the Sea: were more deeply\nconcealed than they are, yet proofs cf the plots\nwhich they are now profecuting would not be\nwanting. Their public aCtions fhall in future de-\npofe againft them in default of their fecret ar-\nchives. The adepts were known ; it was there-\nfore eafy to watch their labours and compare their\ndevices. The German writers have had the ftart\nof us in that career; hiftory, therefore, will not\nbe deftitute of demonftrative proofs.\nThe grand objett of the Illuminees, after the They at\u00b7\ndifcovery of their fecret papers, was to perfuade tempt t\n1o\nconcea\nGermany that their Order )VaS extinct; that the their ex\u00b7\nadepts had not only renounced all their illumini- iftenco.\nzing myfteries, but even all intercourfe among\n. themfelves as members of a fecret fociety. Thefe\nare not the firft Brigands or the firft Setl:aries on\nrecord that have wifhed to make the world be-\nlieve the idea of their exiftence to be chimerical~\neven at. the very time when they were moft\nactively promoting their plots and propagating\ntheir principles. But here error has belied itfelf\neven in the mouths of its moft zealous advocates.\nOn the firft appearance of thofe works that de.\nnounced to the Britifh nation at large the confpira-\ncy of the Illuminees, and thewed how they were\nprofecuting their plots in the occult Lodges of\n1'4afonry~ the zealous brethren inhabiting the-\nbank$ of the Thames called on their German allies\nfor\nDigitized by GoogIe\n\f283\nStrange\navowal\nr.:lating\nto the\n~:~l.\nANTISOCIAL CONSPIRACY ;\nfor fuccour, in order to deftroy thofe ill impref-\nfions which the Life of Zimmerman, Mr. Robifan's\nPt:oofs, and thefe Mtmoirs, were making. The\ncomplaints of the Englifh fraternity, and the an-\nfwer of their auxiliary Brother Boetiger, are in...\nferted in the German Mercury, No. 11, page 26;.\nNearly the fame anfwer has cro1fed the feas, in\norder to intonn the Englifh, through the channel\nof the Mr;rJthly Maga:~ine of January 1798,\npage 3, that whoever 1hould tur(l his refearches\ntoward Illuminifm would be- in purfuit. of a- C\n\u00b7hi-.\nmera, \" as from the \/leginninJ of lht year 1790,\n\" EVERY CONCI!RN Of TH! lttLVMINATI HAS.\n\" cEASED, and no lAdgt of FrtH~~~JjOtJS in GtrmllllJ\n\" has, fince that period, taken the leaft notice of\n\" them.

Now the confpirators think\nthat it will fuffite for their purpofe to \u00b7make the\nworld ~elieve that the idea of their exiil:ence fince\nthe year 1j9o is chimericaL This artifice alfo\n1hall be unma1ked, and nations lhall-be convinced\nthat though this sea: may have changed its form,\nyet that in fo doing it has only invigorated itfelf,\nand acquired new means of corruption.\nThe Situr Boetigtr, the ~ixotte of the Illumi- Bode, tlut '\nneeS; and-of the Brother \u00b7Bode in particular, alfo n;whchief\nmakes another avowal, viz.

U \u00b7 that\n,\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fANTfSOCIAL CONSPIRACY;\never made this \u00b7avowal ; but it perfeClly coincides\nwith the information that I had received concern-\ning\nthat he has upon us in about half a dozen Magazines and\nReviews in which he co-operates, for his dUTertations on the\nRoman Ltulies, on their toilets, and on their fans; on .Amtrictl\nand on China; on tlie Etrufian Yafts, on the .AOing if 111\n'laytr, and in lhort on many other fubjelb. But what it moft\nconcerns the Engtilh people to know, is, that the man, whofe\nauthority is fet up in favor of.the Brotherhood, is as well\nknown in Germany for his talents as a leader of faaion as he\nis for his treatifes on toilets and fans. Nor did he on the\nnews of the immortal viaory of Admiral Duncan reftrain hi\u2022\nJatobin Tage in l:is journals, or blufh at faying that it <will\n,,.\/Hftd<Whtthtr the Englilh had gained this viCtory by the in\u00b7\ntorference of heaven or of hell, whether it cam1 fr~m a\u2022rv1 \u2022\n!~tlow (von oben oder von unten); and that it was the opinion\nofmany, that it would have been a greater happinefs for th1\nE11z\/i.Jh to ha'l!t loft the !Jattle than to have gained it. Such,\nneverthelefs, is the man whom we find placed in competition\nwith, and even fet up as an authority againft the patriotifm of\nMr. Rohifon.\nThis very fame man moreover writes to inform the Englifh\nthat he is no Illuminee. He may gain credit in England;\nbut in Germany he is afked what bufinefs he had with the\nMinerva\/ Lodges if Weimar? In what quality could he pre-\ntend to inherit the papers of a chief of Illuminifm, which,\naccording to the laws.of the Sea, could only be entrufted to\nbrethren? Or for what reafon, after having been fo inti-\nmately conneCted with Bode, does he tHII continue to be the\nlaborious co-operator of the adept W1 E L ~No in the NI'VI\nGerman Mercury? .\n\u00b7 This auxiliary adept alfo writes to the Englilh, that the\nDuke of Saxe Gotha, 111 applicatiDII to him for that purpofe,\n<Would,\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\ftii.STOR.tCA.L PART.\ning this infamous Illuminee.

Frederic William, King of Pruf-\nfia, alarmed at the progrefs which thefe impious.\nand feditious writings were making, thought it\nneceffary \u00b7to put a curb on them. He publifhed\nfome new regulations, called the Editls for Reli-\n.gion. This was received by the llluminees with\nan audacity which feemed to denote that they had\nalready acqu,ired a ftrength fufficient to bid de-\nfiance to fovereigns, and both the _Prince and the\nEdict became the objects of their farcafms and\u00b7\nmoft violent declamations. \u00b7 At length appeared a\nwork attributed to Ba.hrdt, that was the acme of\ninfolence, and, through derifion, was alfo called the\nI.ts difco- Edielfor Religion.

All that tranfpired was, that\nthe plan had been really formed, and that a num- \u00b7\nher of authors, bookfellers, and perfons even who\ncould fcarcely have been fufpected, had entered\ninto the a1fociation. It is not known how far W eif-\nhaupt had contributed perfonally to it; but it ap-\npears that he twice attended at the head.quarters\nof the united brethren ; that he fpent feveral days\nwith Bahrdt; and that the moft zealous and active\nof the united brethren were alfo difciples of\nW eifbaupt. If we are to believe Bahrdt, his\nfecret was betrayed by two affociates well worthy\nof their mafter. Thefe . were two young liber-\ntines, nearly beggars, but who had the talents and\nmeannefs neceffary to become the clerks of his\nimpiety.

He .\nwas reduced to keep a coffee\u00b7houfe at Baffendorff\nnear Halle, where he ended his days as miferably\nas he had lived.

Nor was there in a fhort\ntime\u00b7a town or large village more free from this\nfpecies of literary focieties than from the Illumin-\nized Lodges ; and they were all under the direction\nof the followers of the modem Spartaau.\nBahrdt's great objed: _was, to place th~ affo-\nciates and other readers under a fort of impof-\nfibility .of procuring any other writings, or of\napplying to any other ftudies, th:m thofe of the\nSect ; and the precaution it had taken to initiate\nfo many bookfdlers proved a powerful fupport.\nThe confpiracy might have a1fumed a new fotm;\nbut it ftill continUC!d atl:ive, and its effe& became\nmore perceptible after its difcotrety. It was then\nthat the coalition appeared between the bookfellers\nand the journalifts of the Sect to fupprefs aH\nbooks that couriterafud the progrefs of Sedition\nand Impiety. It was \u00b7in vain for virtuo~s and\npious men to attempt ~o open the eyes of the\npeople ; they could fcarcely find a bookfeller or\na printer who would fell or print their works ;\nor if any had confented they would endeavour to\ndifguft the author by delays, and a hundred other\npretexts.\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fHISTORICAL PART.\npretexts. .Did the author undertake to print it at\nhis own expence, the work was .then thrown by\nin fome obfcure corner of the fhop and never\nexpofed to fale, nor would any bookf,ller attempt\nto fell it ; and the whole work would be fent back\nto the author under pretence that nobody would\nbuy it. The very exiftence of fuch works was\nnot mentioned at the fairs held in Germany for\nthe fale of books.. At other times the author\nwas irangely betrayed, the printer giving up his\n_\nmanufcript to the writers of the Setl:, and the\nrefutation (if the moll: fcurrilous abufe can de-\nferve that name) was advertifed on the back of\nthe book as foon as the firft edition !llade its ap-\npearance. Many authors might have brought\na&ions againft their printers of a fimilar nature\nto that which Doctor Stark was obliged to bring,\n\u00b7and demonftrate a fimilar connivance with the\nSetl: and breach of truft. \" At leaft it is an un-\n\" deniable faCt, that many learned writers made\n\" fruitlefs applications to different bookfellers for\n.\u00ab publications that had been fuppreffed foleJy\n\u00b7\" becaufe they gave umbrage to the Illuminees\u2022\n.\" Their letters were never fo much as anfwered;\n.

In the very ftates of the\nKing of Pruffia it was found impoffible to get this\nfovereign's .Apo\/Dgy and his Edifl for Religion fold\nin the common way. Scarcely had the author\n, fent a few copies to the bookfellers when. they\nwere all returned to him. But did the writers of\nt~e Seet,wilh to publifh the moft fcandalous dif-\nputatioqs and the moft fcurrilous abufe againft\nfovereigns and religion, or againft men in office\nor of high refpettability, the bookfellers were\nalert in felling them, the journalifts extolled their\nexcellence, and fought numerous readers for the\nauthor*.\nOn one hand, the great trade in thefe produCtions\ncarried on by the.Sea, with the certainty of felling\nthem to the literary clubs ; and on the other the\ngreat pecuniary ~ontributions made by\u00b7the rich\nbrethren, formed huge funds for the coalition.\n\u2022To thefe if\u00b7we add the fums contributed by the\nbrethren whom the SeCt had ftationed at di~erent\ncourts, in the church and the councils, either out\n\u2022 See Nachrichten yon einent gro[en aber unfichtbaren\nBunde, the Appendix, Nos. 8 and .13\u2022 and the-Journal of\nVienna. by HoJfman.\nof\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fHISTORICAL PART.\nof their own e~oluments, or the revenues of the\nchurch and Jl:ate, the reader wilJ eafily conceive\n.how well .thefe funds fufficed fo~ indemnifying\n,thofe bookfellers who had fuffered lolfes by re-\nftraining their commerce to w~rks approved of\nby the Areopage.

At the appointed time\nthe bookfeller had but to produce the lift of the\nworks he had fuppreffed or refufed to fell, with\nthe proper proofs, and he received a fum of\nmoney fufficient to indemnify him for fuch loifes.\nThe memorials which I have received from Ger-\nmany, as well as feveralletters, inform me that\n,this fund ftill exifl:s in that country; and the\nFrench Revolution has only furnilhed it with many\n.other means of enriching itfelf.\nAmong the great advantages reaped by the\nSea from this plan which had been fo well con-\ncerted, we may firft obfe~ve the irnpoffibility\nunder which authors lay of warning the public\n.againft the artifices of llluminifm. In the next\nplace, it drew over to their intereft that fwarm of\nwriters who, more hungry than honeft, are re-\n.gardlefs of truth or falfehood, provided they ob-\nt~in a good price.

After this, it is\neafy to judge of his fuppofed nullity in the pro-\ngrefs of his confpiracy. However fecret he may\nhave been in the part he was aB:ing, he could ob-\nferve but too well the approaching accomplilh- \u00b7\nment of the pre?ietion he had made fo early as\nthe fecond year 'of his Illuminifm, when he wrote\nto\n333\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\f334 ANTISOCIAL CONSPIRACY;\nto his firft adepts, \" The great obftacles are over-\n\" come; you will now fee us proceed with gigantic\ncc ftrides.\" The Sect had not been in exiftence.\ntwelve years when Germany was overrun with an\nimmenfe number of adepts and demi-adepts. It\nwas affuming a menacing afpett jn Holland, in\nHungary, and in Italy. One of the adepts called\nZIMMERMAN,' who began by being the chief of\na Lodge at Manheim, and who foon became as\u00b7\nzealous for the propagation of the Setl:, as the\nFamous ZIMMERMAN had been to counteract their\ndark qefigns, would often brag that he had founded \u00b7\n'more than a hundred of thofe confpiring clubs\u00b7\u00b7\nknown under the name of literary focieties, or of\nMafonic Lodges, during his career through Italy,\nHungary, and Switzerland. To give the fatal\nimpulfe to the world, it now only remained for the\nSect to carry its myfteries into a nation powerful\nand atHve indeed, but unfortunately more fufcep-\ntible of that effervefcence which bereaves man of\nthe power of thinking, than of that judgment>\nwhich forefees difafters; to a nation which, in its \u00b7\nardor and enthufiafm, too eafily forgets that true\ngreatnefs is rtot that courage which bids defiance\nto danger (for the vandals and barbarians can\nboaft of fuch heroes); to a nation, in 1hort, that\nhas ever been a prey to illufions, and which,\nbefore it would hearken to the councils of wifdom,\nmight in its firft fury overturn the altar and 1hiver\nthe\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fRISTOlliCAL PAllT.\nthe fcepter, returning to reafon only in time to\nweep over the ruins, and lament the devaftation\nQf which it had been the caufe.\nThis defcription unfortunately was too applical>le\nto France, which in many refpetl:s might claim the\nprimacy among nations, but was too eafl.ly led\naway by illufions.

The explofion in\nFrance might be premature; its too volatile and\nimpetuous pec;>ple might be unwilling to wait till\nother nations were properly prepared for the\ngrand objeCl: ; and W eifhaupt, in particular, was\nnot a man to be fatisfied with partial . or local in-\nfurreCl:ions, which might only ferve to put other\nSovereigns on their guard.

On the fatal day of revolution,\nand at the appointed hour, legions of brethren\nwere to fpring forth on all fides from their fecret\nreceffes, whetherLodges, Academies, or underwhat\nother denomination foever, from the North to the\nSouth, and from the Eaft\u00b7 to the Weft. All\n\u00b7 Europe, in fhort, was to be revolutionized at the\nfame inftant ; all nations were to be hurried into\na 14th of July;\u00b7 and all kings were, like Lewis\nthe Sixteenth, to awake prifoners in the hands of\ntheir own f4bject:s. Altars and thrones were fimul\u00b7\ntaneouOy to vanith from the earth. According to\nthis plan, as has juft been obfc:rved, the French\nwere to be the \u00b7laft people initiated in the myfte-\nries, as the Chiefs took it for granted, that with\ntheir na:ural impatience they would never be\nbrought to wait till the explofion could be univer\u00b7 \u00b7\nfally prepared. \u00b7\n337\nAlready, however, there exifted fome aJepts'haftmed.\nin the very heart of the kingdom.

Well acquainted\nwith the reafons that had induced the Chiefs of\nthe Order to defer the converfion of France, he\nfound means to convince them, that the time was\nnow come for the accomplifument of their views;\nthat the whole nation only waited for their new\nrevolutionary means, to btirft into an open re-\nbelli~n, for which they had been fo long prepared\nby other confpirators; and that the Illuminees\nmight moft certainly turn the fcales.

I fear that 1have\ntrat So-- myfelf prepared my readers for a Gmilar error,\nc.I. when fpeaking (in Vol. II. Chap. XIII. of thefe\nMemoirs) of-a Lodge eftablifhed in that fame\nfl:reet. I recolletl:, however, that I particularly\nmentioned them to be the Sophifiers- adherent to\nthe Duke de ]a Rochefoucault ; and none of thofe\nbelonged to the Con\/rat Social. Though I may\n. have mifiaken the fireet in which they afi'embled,\nI was not in any error with refpetl: to the perfons\nof the Confpirators. The better to difiinguilh\nthem, and that I might not confound them with\nanother fpecies of Mafons, I made the ftricreft\n. inquiries. Among other document$, I procured\na very numerous lift of the Brethren of the Social\u00b7\nContra!\/.\u2022 I therein found men who are well\n.known\n\u2022 I fuould have given this lift, but that I .:ould not fQp-\npofe that fo many Duke$, Marquilres, ancl Barons, would like\nta\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fHISTOJt.ICAL PAllT.\nknown for their attachment to royalty, and not a\nfingle one who had diftinguifhed himfelf by hia\nzeal for the revolution. I alfo found, that this\nerror (fo fcandalizing to the\u00b7 Social ContraB) ori-\nginated in a work called Le.s Majques Arraches,\npublifhed under the feigned name of JaqJUs Le\nSueur, which is nothing but a fcurrilous libel on\nperfons of the higheft refpefrability. This author \u00b7\ntransforms men whom 1 have known to be the\nmoft violent enemies to the revolution into the\nmoft zealous abettors of it. He alfo makes the\nDuke de Ia Rochefoucault, the Abbe Fauchet,\nBailly, and La Fayette, members of the Social\nContratl, though they never belonged to it. He\nplaces it under the diretl:ion of the Grand Mafter\nPhilip of Orleans, whereas it never filiated from\nany Lodge but th;lt of Edinburgh. He paints\nthe venerabl~ Cardinal of Malines in the falfed:\ncolours, as will evidently appear to every perfon\nwho is acquainted with his high reputation for\nvirtue and wifdom. On the whole, I do not\nthink that this fuppofed Le Sueur can be quoted\nto fee t\u00b7beir names made public. Belides, I am not writing\nthe hillory of the dupes, but of the confpiring brethren.-\n! thittk it, however, proper to obferve, that when the fa:de \u00b7\nratio~ of which I am about to fpeak was undertaken, they\nIt (bUhe advice of the queen) admitted feveral member~ -of .a \/}:\u2022{1\n\\llefs arilloc.ratic turn, left their Lodge fhould be fufpetled of\naritlocracy.\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fANTSSOCIAL COIIJSPIRACY;\nas\u00b7 an authority in any thing, except in what he\nfays on the reception of the Pbilalete llluminees ;\nand even there he \u00b7is moft abominable in his per~\nfonalities, and pretends to have been an aB:or in\nthe fcene when he is but the plagiary copyift of\n\u00b7Mirabeau.\nI have befides acquired a certainty, that Weif-\nhaupt's emiffaries could not have applied to men\nmore inimical to his fyftems, whether Mafonic or\nAnarchical, than the members of the Social Con-\nIrati, as by their orders the famous work writtell\nby Bonneville, Bode's great friend, was burnt in\nopen Lodge. In fhort, I have in my poffeffion\n. the original letter (or, in Mafonic language, the .\np\/ancbe tracee) written by a man with whom I was\nacquainted, and on the formal deliberation of the\nSocial Contrafl tranfinitted to feveral other lodges,\nto engage them co join in a federation for the\nfupporc of Louis XVI. againft the jacobins. It is\ntrue, that the \u00b7royalift brethren of chis Lodge\nwere the complete dupes of this projected fede-\nration, for they invited the Lodges to form an\nunion for the maintaining of the King according\nto the conftirution of 1789. Louis XVI. who\nreally wiihed to keep the oath that had been\nforced from him, to be true to the confticution,\nwas very well pleafed with the lift of the fede-\nrated Mafons; but Mr. de La Porte, then mi-\nnifter, was of a different opinion. When he faw\nthe\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fHISTOJt.JCAL P.A..T.\u00b7\nthe circular letter, and' the number of perfons wao\nhad fubfcribed it, he faid, \" It is impoffible that\n\" thefe perfons can be other than conftitutioDal-\ncc ifts, or that they can ever become ftaunch roy-\n\" alifts.\" - \" Let us begin (rejoined the agefltl\ncc of the Social Contratc) by maintaining tbe king\n~' in his prefent ftau\u00b7, and we .will afterwards find\n\" .means of re-eftabli1hing the true Mo.11archy.'\u2022\nThis anfwer may ferve as a vindication for the\nmembers of the Social Co11tra~ ; but their good\nintentions did not make their delufion the lefs\n. complete. In the firft place, they mi:bt have feeo,\nbut they did not fee, that the greater number of\nthofe who had figned the letter were men wlact\nwi!hed to continue! to enjoy their Equality and\nLiberty under a King reduced to the condition of\na mere Doge to the fovereign and legiOative peo\u00b7\nple; and that La Fayette, Bailly, and many other\nrevoJ.utionifts, would have figned this letter, with-\nout ceafing .on that ~ccount to be jacobins and re-\nbels. Neither did they reflea, that many of thofe\nconftitutional brethren would have turned againil\nthe Social Contrafl, as foon as they perceived the\nplan for reinftating the Monarch in his ancient\nrights ; nor that it was far more eafy to entice\nthefe conftitutionalifts into the moft outrageous\ndemocracy of the great club, than to bring them\nback to the principles of real monarchy. In !hort,\nthey had overlooked the vail: number <>f adepts of\ndemocracy\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fANTISOCIAL CONSPIR.ACY;\ndemocracy who would infallibly denounce them\nas traitors to Equality and Liberty, which after-\nwards proved to be the cafe. .It was to verylittle\npurpofe that the \u00b7abettors of this federation termi\u2022\nnated their letter with the following words: -\ncc This table is only for your chapter. Make dif-\n. ~' creet ufe of it. We have two Jacred interefts to\nic ~anage, that of the French Monarchy and its\n\" King, and that of Mafonry and its Members.\"\nThe interefts of Mafonry carried the day; for, at\nthe very time that the demi-adepts were fubfcrib-\ning the letter, the more profound adepts were\nfrom every quarter denouncing the federation .to\nthe great club, and the Social Contrafl was itfelf\nprofcribed.\nCertain of this faCt:, and obferving that the\nbrethren of the Social Ccntrafl-pofitively declare,\nin the table tracee (which I have before me) that\nall political and deliberating clubs Jhonld be Jup-\nprejfed; being alfo affured, .by feveral Mafons, that\nit was from the Committee of the Amis reunis that\nthe invitations were fent to go and deliberate with\nthe German deputies, I find myfelf obliged to\ndiffer with thok writers who declare the Emif-\nfaries of Illuminifm to have alighted at the Social\nContract, and who attribute to that Lodge the\npolitical committees eftabli1hed on their arrival.\nIt may very poffibly have happened, that fome\none of thefe committees may have taken its fta-\ntion\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\fUISTOR.ICAL PAR't'.\ntioh in the fame ftreet ; but certain it is, that fuch\ncommittee was not compofed of members from\nthe S1dal Contra!l. So likewife is it a mere fa-\nble that has been fpread, with regard to the in-\nfcription fuppofed to have been written by Philip\nof Orleans on the door of this Lodge, Hither each\nhings his ray oflight.

This was the land- 1.\ning-place of the travelling brethren from Lyons,\nAvignon, and Bourdeaux. The emilfaries from \u00b7\nGermany could \u00b7not find a central point better\nadapted to their new myfteries than this com-\nmittee ; and there it was that they unfolded all\nthe importance of their miffion.

But here the gates of this fecret fenate are 1hut\nagainft us. I do not pretend to penetrate the dark\nrecefs, and\u00b7 defcribe the deliberations that took\nplace on\u00b7 this occafion. Many brethren have in-\nformed me, that they remember the deputation,\nbut they fcarcely recolleCt Amtlitts-Bod~ and Bay-\nard~Bufche under any other drnomination than\nthat of the German brethren. They have feen thefe\ndeputies received in different Lodges with all the\netiquette due to vifitors of high importance ; but \u00b7\nit was not on fuch occafions that a coalition was\ndebated on, between the ancient myfteries of Ma-\nfonry and thofe of the modern Spartatus. All that\nmy memorials fay on the fubjett is, that negotia-\ntions took place ; that the deputies reported to ,\ntheir Areopage; that the negotiations lafted longer\nthan was expecced ; and that iL\"!!lS g Jeg~th de-\n\\ ~ed, ~~~w\u2022.mxft~ri~s thou_!!be introduced\ni into the French Lo_dges, but under a Mafonic\nt.&!:m_ ; a~d. ~..Jh.~lc! aU be_illuminizc:.d,\nr'!it~out-~52-~IJ.?~~~~..?!_~~\nfP.X.!i~r~~-~~~X~~...~~.!!S\u00b7 Only fuch parts\n' of Weilhaupt's code were to be fdeCl:ed as the\ncircumftances would require to haften the revo- \\\nlution.

The proof th~tt thefe\nobjects were far from contributing to the Revolution is, that\nthe Jacobins fpare no pains to dellroy .them. In a book\ncombating the Jacobins, what can induce a writer to vent\nhis fpleen againft the tenets of a Catholic? I might fay to\nmany writers who.have been guil~!f of this moft.extraordinary\nimprudence, Begin at leaft, gentlemen, by making your-\nfelves acquainted with our tenets, and then fee whether we\nare able to defend them. To others 1 would fay, For God's\nfake let us expofe our belief ourfelves, let us fay what we do\nand what we do not believe. The defence you may with the\nheft intentions fet up for us, may be more hurtful than bene-\nficial to our caufe. Mr. Robifon, no doubt, thought that he\nwas fpeaking in favour of the church of France, when he\n:faid, that that churcll had long ftnce eftablifhed its indepen-\ndenc.e of the Court of Rome. Ifby the Court of Rome \u00b7he\n.means the temporal dominion of the Pope, the French had\n\u00b7Jio great trouble in eftablilhing fuch an independence, as it\n\u00b7never-recognized any fuchdominion; ifhe means the purely\n.fpiritual jurifdietion of the Pope;, neither our Catholic Bifhops,\nClergy, nor \u00b7Laity, ever wilhed to throw it off. They all\n_\ncontinue to believe what they alw~ys have believed, that the\nP~pe, as fuccefi'or of St. Peter, has the jurifdietiqn as firft\npallor over the Church of France, as he bas.over all others.\n\u00b7\u2022 Every\no,g,tlzed by Coogle\n\fHI-STORICAL PART.\nhave reprefen,ted in differen~ coloms, had he had,\nas we have, the whole hiftory of their pretended\nEvery one knows, that this jurifdic\\ion of the fovereign\nPontiff' is held in our faith as an effential point of the bier~\narchy eftablilhed by Chrift ; but evrry one alfo knows, that\nthe jurifdielion of the Pope, as well as that of all Bifuops, is.\nnot of this world; that it does not militatll in any way with\nthe duties we owe to our fovereigns ; that it can never ab-\nfolve us from the fidelity and fubmiffion which we owe to the\nJaws of the State.

The true Jacobirt\nis not to be difcouraged by oppofition. 'the myf-\nteries infufe into the adepts a uniform, conftant,\nand relentlefs, determination to attain the grand\nobject in fpite of every obftacle ; that oath, that\nirrevocable oath of overturning the whole uni-\nverfe and fubjed:ing it to their fyftems, is the true\nprinciple whence originate their refources; this\nfires the zeal Q( the adepts, and induces them to\nmake fuch numerous facrifices ; it infpires its war-\nriors with enthufiafm ; it creates rage and fury in\nthe heart of its brigands. It is this principle\nwhich conftitutes the Sect; in that its force re-\nfides; it is the director and mover of its ac.lepts,\nwhether in arms, in the clubs, in the lodges, or\ndeliberating in the fenate. - But what inferences\nmay not nations draw from this very principle as\nto the nature of their plots ?. Does it not entitle\nus to fay, that the whole of the French revolution\nis nothing more than the offspring of that oath,\nof that premeditated determination of overturning\nthe altar,, the throne, and fociety, which the Sect\nhas infufed into its adepts?

Money being\nnece1fary for procuring arms, the chairman of the commit-\ntee applied to the Baronial Secretary, who referred him to\nthe Treafurer; and the Sunday after \u00b7(May 14) James\nDunn and Patrick Carty were arrefied in the Phoenix-\npark. Carty had; together with his father (a Chelfe:a\npenfioner} been a conftant labourer on Lord Carhampton's\n\u00b7demefne, and had a houfe rent-free.

This gave rife to inquiries, and it wa'S fotJnd .\nthat n,e. lefs t~ io.oo.fikes had been ordered for Perth,\nbefide thofe wanted for Edinburgh. It was farther difco\u2022\nvered, that this Watt was a member of the Committu of\nWays and Means ddegated from the remnants of the\nconventions that he had in this committee read a plan\n'' For feizing on the Lord Juftice Clerk, the Lords of\n\" Seffi.on, and the Lord Provoft.

Here, as on\n)and, we find oaths of f~~y;mJ ;;runion, delegates,\nand accord of fyftem pervading the whole mutiny. At\nPortfmouth it was happily quelled, in a great degree, by\nthe 20th of April; fome ftraggling 1hips would indeed\nfhow fymptoms of revolt, front time to time, both there\nand at Plymouth: at length the grea~..wtigy at she Nor~\n\u00b7~o~ on the I 2th if May, and was not fupprelfed till\nthe month of June.

No authentic document appeared on thefe trials,\n6 indeed;\nD1g1tlzed b\ny.Google\n\f[ 37 l\nindeed, that could connca this m~tiny with the fecret \u00b7\nfocieties on land; but, if we look to dates, it will be\nevident that the Correfponding Society did not view this.\ninfurre8ion of the fleet with an indifferent eye. I here\nallude to the papers that appeared on the trial of a man\nof the name of Pel\/owes, who had been a journeyman\ncarpenter before he took to the patriotic line; he was\ntried at Maidftone on the 13th of March, 1798 (his\ntrial having been deferred at his own requeft) and fen\u2022\ntenced to two years imprifonment. The account of the\ntranfa8ion given by the prifoner, as appeared in evidence,\nis as follows: \" That he lodged at a Mr. W ratten's\n\" houfe in Maidftone ; that a parcel came there on\u00b7 the\n\" rSth of May, 1797 (the fleet in full mutiny) directed.\n\" to Mr. Wratten, by a Charing-crofs coach. The wife\n\" opened the parcel ; and, as Mr. W ratten was from home,\n\" he (Fellowes) told the wife, that the papers it con-\n. \" tained belonged to one of the focieties; there was to\n\" be a meeting, he told her, on that night at the Roft\n\" and Crown ; that he would carry them there, and take\n\" the fenfe of the meeting. He accordingly did fo; r-ead\n\" one of them, and none of the fociety made any ob-\n. \" je8ion. He then laid them on the table, and the\n\" members of the fociety helped thrmfthm as they thought\n\" p~;per \" (or, perhaps, found them, as was the cafe\nwith the hand-bills in Scotland). Some of the bills were\ncarried from this meeting to another divifion of the fo-\nciety, fitting at the Cajlle Inn, under the pretence of\nknowing whether they were legal ; but, whether legal or\nnot, they were diftributed before morning among the fol-\ndiers then at Maidftone. The paper began thus:-\" To\n\" the Britith Army: - Comrades, are we not men ? Is it\n\" not high time we 1bould prove we know ourfelves to\nc 3 \" be\nD1g1tlzed by Coogle\n\f[ 38 l\n\" ~ fuch?
