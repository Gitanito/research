This was \"the only one of its kind expounding the science of geneological [sic] ties of the Twelve Tribes of the Aryan, or White Race, defining the gradations of Progress, leading to final emancipation.\"  It studied the wonders of the White or Aryan Race, the sixth great race of mankind, and the dangers of miscegenation with other, lesser races.
