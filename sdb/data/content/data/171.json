Haynes coined the term \u2018boggle threshold\u2019, which is widely used in parapsychology to indicate the point at which tolerance of an anomalous claim turns to disbelief, and which varies from one person to another. &nbsp;   Contents   \tLife and Career  \tPsychical Research   \tBoggle Threshold \tSelected Publications  \tBooks \tBook Reviews \tTranslations \tCorrespondence \tArticles   \tLiterature \tEndnotes     Life and Career\n\nRen\u00e9e Oriana Haynes was born in London on July 23, 1906. Her father was a lawyer, her mother a granddaughter of TH Huxley. She read law and history at St Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford and subsequently worked for the publishers Geoffrey Bles in London. She married Jarrard Tickell, a journalist and novelist in 1929 and started writing books at around this time. In the 1940s she worked for the British Council. She converted to Catholicism in 1942. In 1946 she became a member of the Society for Psychical Research.  Psychical Research\n\nHaynes\u2019s interest in psychical research began with vivid precognitive dreams. Some of these she described in her 1961 book The Hidden Springs: An Enquiry into Extra-sensory Perception, a study of spontaneous experiences. She was less interested in mass experiments and statistical evaluations, stating that \u2018there is undue reverence for that sacred object the computer\u20191 - a stance that was criticized by some of her colleagues.2 Some also disagreed with her tendency to dismiss the objections of psi-sceptics.3 Haynes\u2019s account of the SPR\u2019s century of research, The Society for Psychical Research 1882-1982: A History, was praised for acquainting the general public with its existence and activities, but was also criticized for being poorly documented.4\n\nHaynes served on the SPR council from 1957. In 1970 she became the editor of its quarterly Journal, holding the post until 1981.  Boggle Threshold\n\nHaynes coined the colloquial term \u2018boggle threshold\u2019, the point at which the mental discomfort caused by a new idea or claim causes a person to reject it as untrue. This has been widely used in parapsychology to refer to the variation in personal levels of resistance to paranormal claims. See Boggle Threshold.
